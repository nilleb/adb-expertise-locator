It  will  promote  economic  growth  through \nenhanced agricultural production in rural areas in general and will \nreduce farmers\u2019 exposure to variability in crop yields and to food \ninsecurity in more remote, disadvantaged, and poorer areas. The \nProject is formulated as a sector loan project and will finance \nsubprojects  that  enhance  irrigation  schemes  and  other  water \ncontrol  infrastructure  in  the  provinces  of  Pursat, Battambang, \nBanteay Meanchey, and Siem Reap. The Project will adopt an \nintegrated approach to irrigation development identifying/selecting \nschemes  with  the  use  of  an  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement (IWRM) approach in a river basin context and then \nrehabilitating them. Sustainability will be ensured by supporting \nbeneficiary  participation  in  operation  and  maintenance (O&M) \nand, progressive irrigation management transfer, and, finally, by \nattending  to  the  more  efficient  use  of  delivered  water  by \nsupporting agricultural intensification and crop diversification. The \nProject will support investments on a scale (small to medium) that \ncan  be  managed  and  maintained  by  local  beneficiary \ncommunities. The Project will also enhance the capacity of those \nassociated with the plan, design, construction, management, O&M \nof the investments, in both the private and public sectors and in \nthe beneficiary farmer communities. \n   \nRationale  The northwest region is one of the poorest and most isolated \nareas in Cambodia. Due to war and civil strife it has been left out \nof  many  development  efforts  during  the  past  decades. \nConsequently,  it  suffers  from  inadequate  investments  in \ninfrastructure,  services,  and  institutional  capacity  building. \nAgriculture is the predominant economic activity and the major \ncrop grown is rice, the staple food. Agricultural productivity is low \nand most rural areas in the northwest are exposed to food deficit \n(in some areas up to 6 months a year) even though Cambodia is, \nin average to good years, considered self-sufficient in rice.  Lack \nof water control and management and low levels of agriculture \ntechnology  constrain  yields.  Overall  availability  of  water  in \nnorthwest  Cambodia  is  limited  and  resources  need  to  be \nmanaged prudently. There is,  however, a  significant   potential to \n ", "iv \nraise agricultural production and rural incomes, and consequently \nreduce poverty in areas, where an enhanced supply of water is \nmanaged properly and where irrigated agriculture is protected \nfrom flooding. Scope exists in the project provinces to provide \nenhanced small to medium-scale irrigation schemes and other \nwater control infrastructure, thus reducing risks of crop failure, and \nto encourage farmers to invest in higher levels of technology and \nadopt improved irrigated agriculture. Improved irrigation schemes \nwill (i) reduce farmers\u2019 exposure to variability in crop yields and \ntherefore  to  food  insecurity,  especially  in  the  more  remote, \ndisadvantaged,  and  poorer  areas;  and  (ii)  raise  agricultural \nproduction and rural incomes in more advantaged areas where \nfood shortage is less of a problem and where crop diversification \nand commercially oriented agriculture can be promoted.  \n   \nObjective  The overall objective of the Project is to support the Government\u2019s \neffort to reduce poverty in rural areas of northwest Cambodia \nthrough increased agricultural production, thereby reducing food \ninsecurity  and  improving  farming  household  incomes.  The \nimmediate  objective  is  better  use  of  water  resources  and \npromotion  of  irrigated  agriculture  through  (i)  a  comprehensive \npolicy and strategic framework to be applied in developing water \nresources; (ii) a better understanding, knowledge, and application \nof the IWRM approach in a river basin context; (iii) improved water \nresource  management  through  rehabilitated/upgraded  small  to \nmedium-scale  irrigation  schemes  and  other  water  control \ninfrastructure;  (iv)  strengthened  capacity  of  communities  and \ninstitutions  to  plan,  implement,  manage,  and  maintain  such \ninfrastructure; and (v) improved agricultural support services to \nthe  beneficiary  water  users.  The  Project  will  have  three \ncomponents: \n(i) Institutional strengthening. The Project will continue previous \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) support to the Ministry of Water \nResources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) in (i) further developing \nits policy and strategy framework, particularly in finalizing a water \nresources investment strategy and preparing strategic plans and \nsubsequent annual strategic business plans; (ii) further developing \nand  refining  the  regulatory  framework  necessary  to  ensure \nsustainable management of irrigation systems and subsequent \ntransfer  to  farmer  water  user  communities  (FWUCs);  and  (iii) \nbuilding at national and provincial levels the capacity to adopt and \napply an IWRM approach in a river basin context. \n(ii)  Irrigation  infrastructure  development  and  management. \nThis component will support (i) water use studies in selected river \nbasins of the four target provinces; (ii) identification, prioritization, \nand  selection\u2014using  an  IWRM  approach  in  a  river  basin \ncontext\u2014 of 10 to 12 small to medium-scale (less than 3,000 \nhectares) irrigation subprojects; (iii) the feasibility study, detailed \ndesign  and  construction  of  the  selected  subprojects;  and  (iv) \norganization  of  the  subproject  beneficiaries  into  FWUCs,  and \ntraining  and  strengthening  these  communities  to  ensure \nsustainable management, and O&M of the rehabilitated irrigation ", "v \nsustainable management, and O&M of the rehabilitated irrigation \nschemes. \n(iii)  Support  to  irrigated  agriculture  development.  This \ncomponent  will  maximize  the  benefit  from  the  investment  by \nensuring delivery of support in improving rice production, crop \ndiversification,  integration  of  livestock  and  fisheries,  and rural \ncredit to the subproject beneficiaries by (i) assisting and training  \nthe agricultural extension services at the subproject district level, \nand (ii) fielding a cadre of irrigation extension workers to facilitate \nthe delivery of these support services within the subproject areas \nand  to  maintain  direct  and  regular  field  contact  with  the \nbeneficiaries to guide them. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is estimated at $30.9 million equivalent, \ncomprising $10.5 million (34%) as foreign exchange, and $20.4 \nmillion equivalent (66%) as local currency. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost        % \nAsian Development Bank  7.38  10.62  18.00  58 \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de \n3.10  0.64  3.74  12 \nD\u00e9veloppement \nGovernment    6.88  6.88  22 \nBeneficiaries    2.25  2.25  7 \n Total  10.48  20.39  30.87       100 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank. \nLoan Amount and Terms  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  various  currencies \nequivalent to $18.00 million from its Special Funds resources. The \nloan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, with an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) \nwill be the Executing Agency.  \n   \nImplementation  Interministerial coordination will be achieved through the project \nArrangements  steering  committee  (PSC)  established  in  2002,  currently \nfunctioning for other irrigation projects funded by ADB and Agence \nFrancaise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) and in the process of being \nelevated to the status of a national PSC. The PSC is chaired by a \nrepresentative (undersecretary of state level) from the Ministry of \nEconomy and Finance (MEF) and comprises of a national project \ncoordinator  from  MOWRAM  (undersecretary  of  state  level)  as \nsecretary, and representatives (undersecretary of state or director \nlevels) of concerned line ministries. A project management office ", "vi \nlevels) of concerned line ministries. A project management office \n(PMO)  headed  by  a  national  director  (undersecretary  of  state \nlevel)  has  already  been  established  within  MOWRAM  to \nimplement several ongoing projects of a similar nature. This PMO \nwill  assume  overall  responsibility  for  implementing the Project, \nusing  its  current  staff  and  drawing  additional  key  staff,  as \nnecessary, from relevant MOWRAM departments. A dedicated \nproject  manager  will  be  appointed  to  head  the  PMO  team \nspecifically assigned to the Project. The Provincial Department of \nWater Resources and Meteorology (PDWRAM) in each project \nprovince will set up a project implementation unit (PIU) headed by \na suitably qualified person and assisted by staff seconded from \neach  of  the  concerned  line  agencies.  A  provincial  project \ncoordination committee chaired by a provincial deputy governor \nwith representation from concerned provincial line agencies will \nensure  effective  coordination  between  the  agencies  directly \ninvolved in the project activities. \n \nMonitoring of the environmental aspects will be the responsibility \nof (i) an environment management unit (EMU) to be established \nwithin PMO at the central level, and (ii) the PIU at the provincial \nlevel,  to  which  an  environment  specialist  from  the  Provincial \nDepartment  of  Environment  will  be  seconded.  The  existing \nResettlement Unit currently established within PMO of MWORAM, \nassisted by the resettlement working groups already formed at the \nprovincial level, will implement and monitor the resettlement and \nland planning activities of the Project. The subproject beneficiary \ncommunities will form FWUCs and subordinate water user groups \n(WUGs) to be registered with commune councils. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement under the Project will be in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines for Procurement. Civil works contracts will be procured \nthrough  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  for \ncontracts estimated to cost more than $1,000,000 equivalent, and \nthrough local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures for contracts \nestimated to cost $1,000,000 or less. Vehicles, equipment, and \nmaterials will be procured by ICB where the cost is more than \n$500,000 equivalent, or by international shopping (IS) where the \ncost  is  $100,000\u2013$500,000.  Small  or  off-the-shelf  goods  and \nmaterials valued at less than $100,000 may  be procured using \ndirect purchase arrangements.  \n   \nConsulting Services  The AFD grant will finance approximately 366 person-months of \nconsulting services (133 international and 233 domestic), in the \nfields  of  project  management,  institutional  and  water  policy \ndevelopment, legal aspects, regulation on irrigation management \ntransfer, resettlement and land management, hydrology and river \nbasin  development,  water  resources  management,  irrigation \ndesign engineering and construction supervision, environmental \nmanagement,  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation, \nagriculture extension, training, community development and water \nuser formation, and rural credit. Consultants to be financed by the ", "vii \nuser formation, and rural credit. Consultants to be financed by the \nAFD grant will be engaged in accordance with AFD\u2019s procedures, \nwith ADB\u2019s endorsement of their competence and experience. \nADB will finance consulting services to carry out specific activities \nrelated to surveys and studies, preparation of detailed designs, \nand  supervision  of  construction  works.  The  Project  will  also \ncontract the services of local institutions and local or international \nnongovernment  organizations  for  community  development, \nspecialized training, and external monitoring of the resettlement \nactivities.  All  ADB-financed  consultants  will  be  selected  and \nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging domestic consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The immediate benefit from the Project is increased productivity\u2014\nBeneficiaries  a yield response of approximately 100% is realistically achievable \nthrough  improved  water  management.  This  response  will  be \nexpressed as increased household incomes for farmers with large \nareas of irrigated land. In the case of poor households, it will \nmean  improved  food  security  through  the  dry  season,  thus \nreducing the extent of localized food deficits common throughout \nthe  northwest  region.  The  greatest  benefit  will  come  from \nincreased  cropping  options  with  a  more  secure  and  better-\nmanaged  water  supply.  While  benefits  have  been  assessed \nprimarily on the incremental paddy yields for both wet season and, \nwhere possible, dry season cropping, more diversified cropping \nactivities made possible by a reliable water source will result in \nfurther  gains  in  household  incomes.  The  average  incremental \nfamily income in the sample representative subproject of the Po Pi \nDeum  scheme  is  estimated  at  $275  per  annum  from  higher \nyielding varieties of wet season rice and different vegetables. The \nProject will result in improved irrigation for nearly 35,000 hectares, \nfor  120,000  beneficiaries  in  about  15%  of  the  total  potential \nirrigation command area for the four project provinces, or about \n40% of the total area currently under irrigation. \n \nThe social development aspect of the Project extends beyond \nincremental household incomes. Farmer beneficiaries, including \npoor  and  vulnerable  sections  and  particularly  women,  will \nparticipate actively in the project activities and will be organized \nand empowered through WUGs and FWUCs group initiatives. The \nProject will have direct beneficial impacts on poverty reduction by \n(i)  improving  food  security  for  rice-deficient  households,  (ii) \nimproving  access  to  irrigation  for  poor  and  marginal  farmer \nhouseholds  with  the  construction  of  tertiary  and  quaternary \ncanals, (iii) improving the access of landless households to rice \nlands through lease of expanded irrigated land, (iv) facilitating \naccess to rural credit, (v) improving access to dry season water \nsupplies for domestic purposes, and (vi) reducing the incidence of \nwaterborne diseases with better water management. Moreover, \nthe registration of landholdings with the district administration, \nwhich  will  take  place  during  resettlement  and  the  land ", "viii \nwhich  will  take  place  during  resettlement  and  the  land \nconsolidation processes, is a legal means of assuring ownership \nand tenure. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Major potential risks include those related to (i) slow adoption of \nthe  concept  of  IWRM  to  river  basin  development  and  its \nrequirements;  (ii)  delayed  project  benefits  due  to  slow  farmer \nadoption of improved irrigated agricultural production techniques, \nwater  management  practices,  and  product  diversification \n(including  livestock  and  fisheries);  (iii)  inadequate  sustained \nmaintenance  of  the  improved  infrastructure;  and  (iv) \nunderestimation of the capital investment needed to rehabilitate \nirrigation  infrastructure.  These  risks  will  be  minimized  by  (i) \ndisseminating  and  promoting  river  and  basin  development \nconcepts  at  the  onset  of  the  Project  and  substantially \nstrengthening  the  concerned  line  agencies;  (ii)  focusing  on \nexisting irrigation schemes where resident knowledge of irrigated \nagriculture exists and where improved security and management \nof water supplies will decrease the risk management issues in \ndetermining cropping activities and testing improved methods of \nproduction; (iii) cooperating closely in ongoing programs operating \nin  the  subproject  areas  and  providing  agricultural  extension \nservices;  (iv)  involving  early  and  in  a  sustained  manner  the \nbeneficiary farmers through substantial investments in community \ndevelopment  and  human  capital  and  in  the  continuing \ndevelopment of end-user ownership; and (v) thoroughly screening  \nthe identified candidate subprojects, and adopting of an iterative \nselection  and  prioritization  process  (through  successive \ncomprehensive feasibility studies, detailed survey and design, and \ncost estimate) leading to the ultimate approval of a subproject \ninvestment before to implementing it. \n   \n ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Northwest Irrigation Sector Project. 1 \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n2.  Cambodia is one of the least developed countries in Asia with an annual  per capita \ngross domestic product (GDP) of $282 (2001), a gender development index of 0.551 (2001), \nand a human development index of 0.556 (2001) resulting in a ranking of 130th in the lowest tier \nof the medium human development category.2 About 36% of Cambodia's population live below \nthe poverty line.3 The incidence of poverty is greater in rural areas (estimated at more than \n40%) where about 90% of the country\u2019s poor are found. The characteristics of poverty differ \nacross the country, but its incidence,  however defined, is higher in the rural areas of the \nnorthwest. \n \n3.  Cambodia is predominantly an agrarian society, with agriculture accounting for 39% of \nGDP. At least 70% of the rural population directly depend on agriculture for their livelihood. The \nsector has an important role to play in reducing rural poverty, meeting the expected population \ngrowth (2.4% per year), and improving nutritional requirements. Agricultural productivity remains \nlow compared with that in other Southeast Asian countries with similar agro-climatic conditions. \nIt is constrained by soil fertility, limited access to and thus use of farm inputs (particularly quality \nseed material, fertilizers and chemicals), the uncertainty of rainfall and frequent occurrence of \ndroughts and flooding, the inability to manage extreme water flows, and a weak agricultural \nextension  service  that  limits  farmer  exposure  to  and  adoption  of  improved  production \ntechniques. Furthermore, the poor rural road network results in high transport costs; restricted \naccess to markets, market information, and credit; and generally lower farmgate prices for \nfarmers fortunate enough to generate surpluses above household requirements. Rice, the \nstaple crop of Cambodia, covers about 90% of the 2.6 million hectares (ha) cropped area, \ncontributing 46% of agricultural output and providing 70% of nutritional intake. In average to \ngood years, Cambodia is considered barely self-sufficient in rice, but this is only true nationally \nand sufficiency at provincial level varies considerably (in 2001, 13 out of 24 provinces reported a \ndeficit).4 Many rural households, especially in the northwest region, continue to suffer rice \ndeficits for up to 6 months of the year.5 \n \n4.  Cambodia is considered a \u201cwater wealthy\u201d country because of its location in the Lower \nMekong Basin and a gross water resource of nearly 50,000 cubic meters per person per year. \nHowever, with high variability in rainfall, lengthy dry seasons, and sporadic drought spells during \n                                                 \n1  The project preparatory technical assistance was provided under ADB. 2001.

Poverty Profiles of Cambodia by the Ministry of Planning in 1997 and 1999 \nboth reported overall incidences of poverty at 36%. The Government\u2019s 2001 Human Development Report,  also by \nthe Ministry of Planning, reports 40\u201345% as living below the poverty line with a daily income of $0.46\u2013$0.63.

", "2 \nthe wet season, especially in the northwest, many rural inhabitants face water shortages \nresulting in reduced crop yields and inadequate domestic supplies. Furthermore, flooding, \nespecially in the Mekong floodplain and the Tonle Sap lowlands are common during the rainy \nseason. In this current water-insecure situation and with a high portion of poor farmers being \nsubsistence producers, their approach to rice production is one of risk minimization reflected by \ntheir reluctance to accept and/or invest in innovation and changes in production patterns. \nSecured water supplies throughout the entire growing season and better water management are \ntherefore  prerequisites  for  (i)  reducing  farmers\u2019  exposure  to  variability  in  crop  yields  and \ntherefore to food insecurity, especially in the more remote, disadvantaged, and poorer areas; \nand (ii) raising agricultural production and rural incomes in more advantaged areas where food \nshortage  is  less  of  a  problem  and  where  crop  diversification  and  commercially  oriented \nagriculture could be promoted. Irrigated agriculture accounts for 54% of agricultural output and \n31% of the total rice production \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n5.  Water Sector Institutional Framework. The Government upgraded the Directorate \nGeneral of Irrigation, Meteorology and Hydrology within the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and \nFisheries (MAFF) to the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) in 1999, \nwith a mandate to plan and manage the use and conservation of Cambodia\u2019s water resources. \nWith assistance6 from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) MOWRAM has achieved steady \nprogress  toward  establishing  a  legal  and  policy  framework  (Appendix  1)  to  guide  the \ndevelopment of the water sector, including the irrigation subsector; however, further institutional \nstrengthening is required for the development of water policies and laws and improvement in the \ncapacities of institutions to implement them. \n \n6.  Competition for Water and a River Basin Perspective. Cambodia\u2019s water sector legal \nand policy framework has provision for managing water resources in a river basin perspective, \nbut this has not yet been implemented. Even though there has been little development of upper \ncatchment resources, competition among water users has been an ongoing issue, especially in \nthe northwest. In addition, competition for water is likely to increase because of urban areas, \nhydropower, irrigation, and residual stream flow requirements to maintain ecosystems and \nfisheries, especially in the Tonle Sap and Mekong River systems. Water resources planning and \nmanagement need a river basin development perspective to ensure that water is used to \nachieve the greatest net economic and social benefit, while preventing conflict and competition, \ncreating  an  environment  conducive  to  satisfying  present  and  foreseeable  demands,  and \nsustaining environmental requirements. This is best done through the adoption of an integrated \nwater resources management (IWRM)7 approach. The Government has promoted the principles \nof IWRM in a river basin context, but needs further resourcing and institutional capacity building \nto operationalize the approach. \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 1999.

Manila. \n7  Integrated water resources management is a process to improve the planning, conservation, development, and \nmanagement of water, forest, land, and aquatic resources in a river basin context, to equitably maximize economic \nbenefits and social welfare without compromising environmental sustainability. It is based on comprehensive water \nresource assessments of river basins, analysis of quantity and quality concerns for these resources and of \nopportunities for their conjunctive use, and prioritization of interdependent water resource developments. ", "3 \n7.  Irrigated Agriculture and Irrigation Infrastructure. The higher yields achieved on the \nlimited existing irrigated areas substantiate the importance of supplemental irrigation and of \nbetter water resources management. Irrigation development therefore represents, especially in \nthe northwest, a means of reducing crop failure, raising crop yields and productivity and \ncropping  intensities  (thus  securing  rice  production),  and  allowing  diversified  production \noptions\u2014all subsequently reducing rural poverty through food security and increased farm \nincomes. About 950 existing surface-fed irrigation schemes have been inventoried in 19948 \nwithin Cambodia. The potential command area was estimated at 473,000 ha, of which only \n256,000 ha were fully irrigable. Only 21% of the schemes were fully operational and a further \n14% were either nonoperational or nonoperable. Many irrigation schemes, including those that \nwere constructed during the Khmer Rouge regime in the late 1970s, were damaged after \ndecades of neglect, receiving neither routine nor periodic maintenance, and were in urgent need \nof  rehabilitation.  In  recent  times,  some  rehabilitation  initiatives  occurred  and  were  largely \nfinanced  from  external  assistance  (Appendix  2).  The  four  northwest  provinces  of  Pursat, \nBattambang, Banteay Meanchey, and Siem Reap account for 22% of the country\u2019s population \nand 33% of its agricultural land. More than 100 existing irrigation schemes identified in these \nprovinces have an estimated total potential command area of 234,000 ha, with only 85,000 ha \ncurrently irrigated.  \n \n8.  Stakeholder  Participation  in  the  Irrigation  Subsector.  In  June  2000,  MOWRAM \nissued Prakas (Instruction) 3069 that provides a framework for introducing of an irrigation \nmanagement transfer (IMT) process to increase participatory management and to rationalize the \nsharing of operation and maintenance (O&M) costs between the government and beneficiary \ncommunities. Prakas 306 covers (i) the formation, registration, and strengthening of farmer \nwater  user  communities  (FWUCs)10  and  subordinate  water  user  groups  (WUGs);  (ii)  their \nempowerment in managing irrigation schemes, particularly in collecting irrigation service fees to \ncover the cost of water delivery and scheme O&M; and (iii) the gradual and phased transfer of \nresponsibility for O&M to FWUCs and, eventually, ownership of the irrigation infrastructure. \nActual  implementation  of  Prakas  306  varies widely between provinces, districts, and even \nschemes. Only about 100 FWUCs have been formed nationwide to date and are functioning to \na limited extent only. \n \n9.  Poverty in the Northwest. Until 1998, much of the northwest was controlled by the \nKhmer Rouge and was inaccessible to both aid and development agencies. It was thus left out \nof many development initiatives (largely aid-funded) that during the past decade were directed \nto the south and east of the country nearer to Phnom Penh. The northwest provinces are among \nthe poorest in Cambodia, with average provincial poverty level ranging from 24% to 54% and \npockets of poverty reaching up to 60% and more. Official statistics report an adult literacy rate of \n68.5% for the nation and 46.2% for the northwest. That figure that is probably overstated as it \nincludes people who are only partially literate. Only 1.25% of the rural population have access to \n                                                 \n8  Halcrow et al. 1994.

Relevance of the Project to Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s Strategies. The Project is in \nline with the government\u2019s vision and development goals articulated in the Second Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan (SEDP-II) and the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS),11 \nwhich are both summarized in the sector/subsector analysis in Appendix 1. The Project is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program that supports the government's goal of \npoverty reduction through three priority areas (rural economic development, human resources \nand social development, and private sector development) and 10 sectors and subsectors.12 \nInvestment in rural infrastructure (including irrigation systems) and agricultural support services \nconstitute a major thrust in the poverty reduction partnership agreement between ADB and \nCambodia.13 The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s commitment to a multisectoral approach in \nand around the populous rural areas of the Tonle Sap14 where the majority of the poor live, and \nis closely linked to the ongoing ADB-financed Northwestern Rural Development Project15 that is \naddressing rehabilitation of the rural road network and rural infrastructure at the village level. \nSynergy has been sought with other ongoing or planned aid-financed initiatives in agriculture, \nrural development, and natural resource management.16 Finally, the Project is fully consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s water policy.17 \n \n11.  Lessons Learned.  Several past and ongoing programs (Appendix 2) implemented by \nMOWRAM have yielded relevant lessons and valuable experiences. The following key lessons \nhave  been  incorporated  into  the  design  of  the  Project:  (i)  a  river-basin approach to the \nmanagement of water resources should be taken in areas with potential scarcity of water; (ii) \nsecured and properly managed water supply that reduces production risk is a prerequisite for \neffective diffusion of improved agriculture technologies and crop diversification; (iii) to develop \nend-user ownership and promote sustainable participation in scheme management and O&M, \nbeneficiaries should actively participate at all stages of project preparation and implementation; \nand substantial investments in community and human capital development are needed, for \nwhich  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  can  play  a  crucial  role;  (iv)  rigorous \nselection/prioritization of the schemes, proper planning, and sound designs and cost estimates \nare needed to avoid underachievement and cost overruns during implementation; (v) more \ncompact and institutionalized arrangements for project implementation are better than project-\nspecific arrangements in terms of coordinated management, more efficient performance, and \nless  demand  on  scarce  managerial  staff;  and  (vi)  addressing  resettlement  and  land \n                                                 \n11  The Royal Government of Cambodia. 2002.

THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n12.  The overall objective of the Project is to support the government effort to reduce poverty \nin  rural  areas  of  northwest  Cambodia  through  enhanced  agricultural  production,  thereby \nalleviating food insecurity and improving farming household incomes. The immediate objective \nis better use of water resources and taking advantage of the potential for irrigated agriculture \nthrough (i) a comprehensive policy and strategic framework to be applied in developing water \nresources; (ii) better understanding, knowledge, and application of the IWRM approach in a river \nbasin  context,  particularly  in  predicting  and  mitigating  impacts  of  irrigation  development \n(especially the cumulative impact and interdependence of schemes in a common basin) on \nwater resources and the aquatic ecosystem; (iii) improved water resource management by \nrehabilitating/upgrading  small-  to  medium-scale  irrigation  schemes  and  other  water \nmanagement infrastructure; (iv) strengthened capacity of communities and institutions to plan, \nimplement, manage, and maintain such infrastructure; and (v) improved agricultural support \nservices to the beneficiary water users. The project framework is in Appendix 3. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n13.  To meet its objectives, the Project has three components: (i) water sector institutional \nstrengthening,  (ii)  irrigation  infrastructure  development  and  management,  and  (iii)  irrigated \nagricultural development. \n \n1.  Institutional Strengthening in the Water Sector \n14.  Water  Resources  Policy  and  Strategic  Framework.  The  Project  will  continue  to \nsupport MOWRAM in further developing a policy and strategic framework and asserting its \nstatutory leading role in the water sector with the long-term objective of enabling it to (i) plan, \nprioritize, and guide external investments in accordance with the government\u2019s sectoral policies \nand plans and promote their consistent application across all projects; and (ii) coordinate \ninteragency cooperation, especially where multiple agencies are working in the same river \nbasins. More particularly, the Project will assist MOWRAM in (i) finalizing the water resources \ninvestment  strategy  using  a  consultative  process  that  includes  all  stakeholders  (other \ngovernment agencies involved in water related investments and their provincial offices, NGOs, \ninternational  organizations,  aid  agencies,  etc.);  (ii)  organizing  and  conducting  regular \ngovernment-aid agency forums to discuss ongoing and planned investments; and (iii) further \ndeveloping its strategic development plans and subsequent annual investment plans. \n \n15.  Regulatory Framework for Irrigation Management Transfer. MOWRAM and the aid \ncommunity recognize the need for coordinated development of the policy, legal, financial, and \nadministrative  framework  for  IMT.  Particular  attention  is  required  to  clarify  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities of all IMT stakeholders; the scope and modalities for handing over irrigation \ninfrastructure and transferring O&M responsibilities, which will depend on the type and size of \nirrigation schemes; the form of legal agreements required between MOWRAM and FWUCs to ", "6 \nregulate the transfer; water use and scheme ownership rights for FWUCs; and the procedures \nfor calculating and collecting irrigation service fees. \n \n16.  Through the French Government-funded Support for the Development of Agriculture \nSector Policies Project,18 MOWRAM recently constituted an interministerial irrigation working \ngroup (Appendix 1) with the mandate to refine the national IMT policy and to prepare regulatory \ndocuments\u2014water  law  and  subdecrees\u2014and  ministerial  instructions  necessary  for  their \nimplementation. The group will also (i) develop operational guidelines for a practical process of \nFWUC establishment and registration; (ii) establish a coordination forum where lessons learned \nand experiences on FWUC matters from all government or externally funded interventions are \ncapitalized and exchanged, providing continuous feedback for national policy development; (iv) \ndevelop  and  institutionalize  a  national  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  to  assess  the \nmanagement and development of all irrigated areas; and (v) ensure that appropriate budgets \nand trained staff are made available for implementing IMT. The Project will support the group by \nproviding (i) international expertise (one water policy adviser and one IMT specialist) to assist in \nreviewing  and  improving  the  IMT  regulatory  framework,  (ii)  resources  for  organizing  and \nconducting  coordination  workshops,  (iii)  resources  to  carry  out  case  studies  on  FWUC \nexperiences within the country, and (iv) in-country study tours and field visits for the members. \n \n17.  IWRM Approach in River Basins. MOWRAM and its provincial departments have \nalready achieved an impressive record in project implementation, having benefited from ADB \ncapacity-building assistance.19 Nonetheless, a wide range of knowledge and awareness needs \nto be developed to adopt and apply an IWRM approach in a river basin context. The Project will \naddress these weaknesses. Much of the needed expertise and experience will be gained by \nMOWRAM and provincial departments of water resources and meteorology (PDWRAMs) staff \nthrough (i) focused training, guidance, and specifically designed courses in disciplines such as \nenvironmental and social impact assessment, integrated water resources planning, and river \nbasin management, to be delivered by consultants recruited under the Project; (ii) direct on-the-\njob  training  by  working  alongside  consultants  and  technical  staff  in  disciplines  covering \nengineering,  agronomy,  economics,  sociology,  hydrology,  and  environmental  impact \nassessment  during  the  preparation  of  river  basin  water  use  studies,  subproject  feasibility \nstudies, and detailed design; and (iii) formal training at international and local institutions in \nproject  management,  English  language,  and  computer  skills,  together  with  regional  and \ndomestic  study  tours.  In  addition  to  intensive  training  to  develop  individual  capabilities, \nMOWRAM and PDWRAMs require additional facilities and equipment to effectively adopt and \napply an IWRM approach in a river basin context as well as to carry out project activities and \ndevelop  their  operational  capacity.  The  Project  will  provide  for  hydrological  measuring \nequipment,  upgrading/construction  of  office  facilities,  vehicles,  equipment,  and  operational \nresources for national and provincial offices. \n \n                                                 \n18  The Support for the Development of Agriculture Sector Policies Project is financed by the French Government \nthrough the Fonds de Solidarit\u00e9 Prioritaire. The project aims to strengthen the institutional capacity of the ministries \nconcerned with the agriculture sector (mainly MAFF, Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), and MOWRAM) to \nenable them to develop well-defined sector strategies focusing primarily on poverty reduction and food security for \nthe rural population. The selected priority issues include land tenure security, irrigation management, reforestation, \nand farmers organizations. \n19 ADB. 1999.

Irrigation Development \n18.  Following a process based on criteria agreed upon with the Government (Appendix 4) \nand applying an IWRM approach in a river basin context, 10 to 12 small to medium-scale (less \nthan 3,000 ha) irrigation and/or water management subprojects  (river diversions, reservoir \nupgrading, flood control dikes, and flood spreading infrastructure,20 etc.)  will be selected in \nidentified basins of the target provinces of Pursat, Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, and Siem \nReap (the process and selection criteria for prioritizing and selecting subprojects are presented \nin Appendix 4). In the first stage of the selection process, 35 eligible subprojects (Appendix 5) \nthat include four core subprojects studied during project design were identified in the project \nprovinces. The Project will provide funds for rehabilitating and improving or constructing the \nselected subprojects, including all costs for preparation (feasibility studies and detailed survey \nand design), construction and supervision of civil works, all necessary environmental mitigation \nmeasures, and resettlement requirements (compensation under the latter will be government-\nfinanced). \n \n19.  River Basin and Water Use Studies. The Project will finance four water use studies in \nselected priority river basins of the target provinces.21 Besides providing staff of MOWRAM and \nPDWRAM with practical exposure to IWRM and river basin development concepts, the studies \nwill (i)  give an assessment of the overall water resources availability, use, and demand; (ii) \nidentify existing as well as planned water resource infrastructure and their interdependence; and \n(iii) assist in selecting for further survey and feasibility study under the Project candidate \nsubprojects that are unlikely to generate detrimental effects on downstream water users or be \nadversely affected by other planned water resources development activities. \n20.  Stand-Alone Schemes. There is also significant potential for rehabilitation of stand-\nalone small to medium-scale irrigation schemes that typically draw water from a reservoir \nsupplied by one discrete catchment. Rehabilitating such schemes is not expected to result in \nnegative downstream impacts on water availability or preclude future development possibilities. \nAmong  the  35  eligible  subprojects,  17  stand-alone  schemes  were  identified  for  further \nconsideration (Appendix 5). \n \n21.  Five core subprojects were studied to feasibility level during project preparation.22 One \n(Ponley-Banteay Meanchey) is considered suitable for proceeding to detailed design. For the \nLink  Canal  (Battambang)  and  Po  Pi  Deum  (Banteay  Meanchey)  subprojects,  additional \ninformation from the Mongkol Borei basin water use study is required before proceeding to \ndetailed survey and design. The final selection of the Link Canal subproject is also subject to (i) \nconfirmation of the development of an incremental 2,000 ha of irrigated land in the command \n                                                 \n20 Flood spreading is a flood water management practice that consists of diverting excess water overtopping the \nspillway of a reservoir embankment during high-intensity rainfall episode to a downstream network of drains that \ndistributes and eventually spreads this floodwater over an extended command area before land preparation. \n21 The Project will finance water use study for the following river basins: (i) the Mongkol Borei river located in both \nBattambang and Banteay Meanchey, (ii) the combined Boribo-Srang-Thlaemaom rivers system in Pursat, (iii) the \ncombined Daun Tri-Svey Don Keo rivers system located in both Pursat and Battambang, and (iv) the Svay Chek \nriver in Banteay Meanchey. \n22  Thlea Maom Scheme (rehabilitation of a river diversion scheme) in Pursat; Link Canal Scheme (construction of a \ntransfer canal to increase the water supply to an existing reservoir) in Battambang; Po Pi Deum Scheme \n(redesigning  an  irrigation  scheme  and  rehabilitating  key  water  control  infrastructure);  Ponley  Scheme \n(rehabilitating/upgrading a reservoir and its command area) in Banteay Meanchey; and Stung Chikraeng Scheme \n(rehabilitating/upgrading a reservoir and its command area) in Siem Reap. ", "8 \narea below the Kamping Puoy Reservoir by an Italian Government-financed project expected to \nstart  early  in  2004,  and  (ii)  additional  survey  and  design  of  a  section  of  the  reservoir \nembankment  in  need  of  rehabilitation.  The  fourth  core  subproject  (Stung  Chikraeng-Siem \nReap)23 similarly requires (i) revision of the feasibility study in view of the request of Siem Reap \nprovincial authorities to adopt a phased approach in its development, (ii) a comprehensive \nresettlement plan, (ii) an initial environmental examination (IEE) to ADB standards, and (iii) \nreconfirmation of the economic and financial analyses before the subproject can proceed to \ndetailed design. The remaining core subproject (Thlea Maom-Pursat) was rejected on grounds \nof poor economic returns as well as engineering and environmental considerations. Overall, it is \nestimated that some 10 to 12 subprojects will be implemented under the Project. This is \nestimated to result in improved water availability and management to irrigate nearly 35,000 ha,24 \ninvolving 120,000 beneficiaries on about 15% of the total potential irrigation command area for \nthe four project provinces, or about 40% of the total area currently under irrigation. \n \n22.  Resettlement. Most selected subprojects will require varying degrees of land acquisition \nand compensation for houses and other assets along new or widened canal alignments and \nenlarged reservoirs. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and \nHandbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice (1998), and in consultation with the \nInterministerial Resettlement Committee (IRC) established under the Council of Ministers, a \ngeneric resettlement framework (RF) (Appendix 6) and model resettlement plans (RPs) for the \nstudied core subprojects (Appendix 7) were prepared to guide preparation of future RPs for \neach subproject. \n \n23.  Land  Adjustment  and  Consolidation.  Rehabilitating  and  upgrading  the  irrigation \nschemes will, in most cases, rationalize and improve irrigation and drainage canals, especially \nfor tertiary and quaternary canals in the command area. This task will be achieved through a \nparticipatory resolution process involving farmers and local authorities (at commune, district, \nand village levels) and facilitated by the provincial and district staff of PDWRAM and Provincial \nDepartment of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction (PDLMUPC). The process \nwill be initiated at the detailed design stage of selected subprojects and will result in a registry of \nlandholdings  and  ownership  to  be  held  at  district  land  registration  offices,  and  provide  a \nlegitimate  entry  point  for  cadastral  survey  and  a  land  titling  certification  process  by  the \nmandated Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction (MLMUPC).25 \n \nb.  Farmer Water User Communities and Operation and Management \n24.  The Project will support government policy to achieve sustainability in irrigation by \nstrengthening  beneficiary  communities  capacity  for  management  and  O&M  of  irrigation \ninfrastructure and gradually transferring to them those responsibilities and ultimately ownership \nof the schemes. It will strengthen the capacity of PDWRAM staff in community and group \norganization, establishment of WUGs and FWUCs (consistent with the operational rules and \nregulations  developed  under  the  institutional  strengthening  component),  irrigation  scheme \n                                                 \n23  An independent feasibility study of Stung Chikraeng Scheme was commissioned by the Agence Francaise de \nD\u00e9veloppement in its capacity as potential cofinancier of the Project. \n24  Including an estimated 19,000 ha of flood spreading (footnote 23) and flood recession (paddy grown in reservoir as \nthe water level recedes) production area and an estimated 16,000 ha of irrigated command area (full control \nirrigation), of which about 5,000 ha will be double-cropped (dry season cropping). \n25  A national program of cadastral survey, registration, titling and certification of title based on the Land Law \npromulgated in August 2001 has been started by MLMUPC with the joint support of World Bank, Deutsche \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Technique Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), and the Government of Finland. The program is progressing in \neach of the project provinces and is conducted at district level by the District Land Offices under the management \nof PDLMUPC. ", "9 \nmanagement, water management, and irrigation scheduling. PDWRAM staff will also be trained \nto conduct FWUC and WUG training in management and O&M procedures, as well as in \naccounting and financial planning and reporting, conflict resolution, and mainstreaming gender \nand vulnerability issues. \n \n25.  The Project recognizes the limited resources of PDWRAM in this area and will enlist the \nprivate sector to further support the establishment and strengthening of farmer organizations. \nKey to the successful implementation of this subcomponent will be the fielding of a cadre of \nirrigation extension workers (IEWs) to supplement PDWRAM staff at field level to work with \nFWUCs and WUGs established in each subproject. The IEWs will be  engaged by qualified \nNGOs26 contracted to (i) field for each subproject scheme an irrigation extension team (IET) with \nexpertise  in  community  organization  (including  gender  development  and  mainstreaming), \nirrigation water management and agricultural production, and irrigation scheme management \nand O&M; (ii) train FWUC management and members in operational matters; (iii) assist in \nestablishing and strengthening the FWUCs, including negotiating formal agreements that outline \nimplementation and the IMT process between MOWRAM, local authorities, and FWUCs; (iv) \nassist  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)/PDWRAM  and  PDLMUPC  in  facilitating  the \nresettlement  and  land  adjustment/consolidation  process;  and  (v)  support  the  irrigated \nagricultural development component. \n \n26.  In collaboration with ongoing irrigation interventions, MOWRAM has developed initial \nguidelines and training modules. These will be used as a starting point, but will be refined and \nimproved through pilot implementation and through the outcomes of the capitalization work of \nthe interministerial irrigation working group (para. 16). \n \n3.  Developing Irrigated Agriculture \n27.  The Provincial Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (PDAFF) and their \nDistrict Agricultural Office (DAO), are responsible for providing agricultural extension services, \nbut  severely  lack  resources.  The  Project  will  (i)  provide  technical  training,  basic  office \nequipment, and mobilization support for DAOs; and (ii) field IETs (para. 25) to facilitate (as \ninterfaces) the delivery of government extension services in subproject areas. The training \nprogram will incorporate wet season and dry season paddy production, integrated farming \nsystems, improved irrigated agriculture, and on-farm water management practices. Associated \nwith the technical training, collecting market information and mechanisms for disseminating it \nwill be enhanced, using local media and market notice boards. \n \n28.  Improved Agricultural Extension.  In close coordination with other programs,27 the \nProject will assess training needs and develop an extension training program for PDAFF and \nDAO staff to complement the technical training and improve their effectiveness as extension \nstaff. Technical and extension training for target district staff will begin simultaneously with \nconstruction in each subproject. Cross visits between relevant subprojects will be an important \npart of the training for farmer representatives and IETs. At farmers level, the Project will support \nparticipatory farmer-led extension processes through FWUCs, involving members directly in \n                                                 \n26 Through the country\u2019s experience in participatory development over the past 15 years a substantial number of local \nand international NGOs as well as domestic independent experts are now skilled and experienced in participatory \nand community organization techniques.

Farmer  leaders  will  be  identified,  trained,  and  involved  in  organizing \ndemonstration plots on their own farms to be used as bases for farmer field schools and in \ncoordinating  farmer  training  and  field  days,  to  provide  opportunities  for  further  interaction \nbetween farmers and extension staff at critical periods of the growing season. \n \n29.  Improved Rice Seed Production. The Project will promote farmer involvement in seed \nproduction to increase the availability of early maturing paddy varieties and maximize the \nadvantage of improved water availability. It will train DAO agronomists in testing seed for \ngermination and purity. Selected farmers will be trained in seed production with subsequent \nregistration. To establish a seed pool, other volunteer farmers will be encouraged to multiply \nseed on their own farms using small quantities of improved seed supplied by the Project. With \ntechnical support, a seed certification procedure in each province will be developed so that \nfarmers can achieve higher prices for certified seed that they produce. \n \n30.  Improved Livestock and Fisheries. Livestock rearing si an important part of rural \nlivelihoods in terms of nutrition, and draft power. It is a means of wealth accumulation and \nreserve. Each province has a Livestock Disease Diagnostic Laboratory that is currently not \noperating at full capacity due to lack of funds. The Project will reactivate these laboratories to \nprovide improved diagnostic services. It will also train and give the village livestock assistants in \nthe project area basic veterinary kits to improve animal health services to farmers. Similarly the \nProject will support fishery initiatives, as improved control of natural waterways, rehabilitated \nirrigation canals, and better water management in paddy fields, that will allow diversifying into \nfish raising activities, thus reducing pressure on natural stocks. \n \n31.  Access to Rural Credit.  Within the framework of the feasibility study to be prepared for \neach subproject, rural credit access will be studied and a support program developed to address \nidentified constraints, with particular attention to the needs of households with female heads and \nother vulnerable households. The Project will review alternate credit options and help bridge the \ngap between formal credit institutions28 and individual FWUCs and WUGs.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n32.  The  Project  will  assist  MOWRAM  in  adopting  an  IWRM  approach  to  river  basin \ndevelopment by financing water resources assessments and water use studies in selected \npriority  basins  to  better  understand  the  link  between  water  and  land  resource  use,  the \nenvironment,  and  sustainable  development  at  the  basin  level.  The  data  will  establish  the \nparameters for prioritizing future water-related investments, a process that will be reinforced in \nselecting candidate irrigation schemes to be rehabilitated under the Project. \n \n33.  The Project will support the development of irrigated agriculture as a recognized means \nof reducing poverty in the short term in rural areas by way of (i) reducing farmers\u2019 exposure to \nvariability in crop yields and therefore to food insecurity in more disadvantaged, remote, and \n                                                 \n28 Licensed or registered microfinance institutions such as Hattha Kaksekar (Pursat, Banteay Meanchey and Siem \nReap), and Seilanithih (Pursat, Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Siem Reap) operating in the project area, the \nPRASAC Credit Association that will be operating in the project area from March 2003. The EU-financed \nECOSORN is under preparation and is expected to include a rural credit component. Several international and \nlocal NGOs are successfully implementing microfinance projects in some areas of northwestern Cambodia such  \nas Catholic Relief Services in Battambang, Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE) active in the \nnorthwest; and World Vision nationwide. On a larger scale, Acleda Bank, which is a specialized bank licensed by \nthe National Bank of Cambodia as a microfinance institution, is operating nationwide. ", "11 \npoorer areas where annual food deficits are common; and (ii) promoting economic growth \nthrough enhanced agricultural production and rural incomes in areas where food security has \nbeen  achieved  and  where  crop  diversification  (including  high-yielding  and  aromatic  rice \nvarieties) and commercially oriented agriculture can be promoted. The Project will also adopt a \nmore  integrated  approach  to  irrigation  development  that  will  begin  with  identifying  and \nprioritizing  the  schemes  using  an  IWRM  approach,  and  then  rehabilitating  them. \nSimultaneously,  sustainability  of  the  investment  will  be  ensured  by  supporting  beneficiary \nparticipation in selection, management, and O&M of the schemes and in progressive IMT. To \neffectively take on such an approach, the Project will support investments on a scale that can be \nmanaged and maintained (at least partially) by local beneficiary communities and developed as \na comprehensive agricultural system. Finally, irrigated agriculture extension services will be \nsupported  and  strengthened  to  achieve  more  efficient  use  of  the  delivered  water  and \noptimization of the investment.  \n \n34.  Given that the Government does not have the resources to engage and retain the full \nrange of skilled personnel to undertake water resource development and management within \nMOWRAM, the Project will assign certain implementation duties to more specialized entities \noutside the public sector. In the past, monitoring and supervision, and, to a certain extent, \nimplementing activities depended very much on the presence of consultants engaged through \nprojects. Consulting services envisaged here will instead focus on supporting and strengthening \nthe  capacity  of  MOWRAM  and  its  provincial  departments  to  efficiently  plan,  monitor,  and \nsupervise the works and services provided by execution partners contracted from (i) the private \nsector  (i.e.  domestic  consulting  and  construction  firms,  NGOs);  and  (ii)  specialized  local \ninstitutions and organizations. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n35.  The project cost, inclusive of contingencies and taxes and duties, is estimated at $30.9 \nmillion  equivalent,  comprising  $10.5  million  (34%)  in  foreign  exchange  and  $20.4  million \nequivalent (66%) in local currency. The Project will not finance recurrent costs, other than the \nincremental annual operating costs of management support and a part of the infrastructure \nmaintenance costs during the initial years of implementation (summary cost tables are in \nAppendix 8). \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n36.  It is proposed that ADB provides a loan of $18 million equivalent from its Special Funds \nresources to finance about 58% of total project costs, including $10.6 million equivalent of local \ncurrency. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an \ninterest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \nAgence  Francaise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  has  agreed,  in  principle,  to  provide  parallel \ncofinancing in a grant amounting to $3.7 million equivalent (about 12% of the total project cost) \nto cover the costs of a portion of consulting services. The Government will finance $6.9 million \nequivalent (about 22% of the total project cost), which includes about $2 million for taxes and \nduties,  the  balance  being  mainly  for  resettlement,  demining,  a  portion  of  structures  and \nearthworks, and part of the maintenance costs of rehabilitated infrastructure. The beneficiary \ncontribution  is  estimated  at  $2.3  million  (7%  of  total  cost)  equivalent  comprising  in-kind \ncontribution of labor for field distribution earthworks plus a share of O&M costs during project \nimplementation.  \n ", "12 \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Organization and Management \n37.  Appendix 9 presents the project management and implementation structures, and the \nimplementation process. A comprehensive analysis of the institutional framework at national \nand  local  levels  and  the  detailed  design  of  the  project  implementation  arrangements  are \npresented in Supplementary Appendix C. The Project will be implemented over 6 years (2004-\n2010) and a summary implementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n38.  Project Coordination and Management at Central Level. Successful implementation \nof the Project will require the cooperation of several ministries.29 Interministerial coordination will \nbe achieved through the project steering committee (PSC) established in 2002 and currently \nfunctioning  for  the  ADB/AFD-funded  Stung  Chinit  Irrigation  and  Rural  Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Project  and  planned  to  be  used  for  the  AFD-funded  Prey  Nup  Polders \nRehabilitation Project. This PSC is in the process of being elevated to the status of a national \nPSC and the Government intends it to continue to function beyond project implementation. It is \nchaired by a representative (undersecretary of state level) from the Ministry of Economy and \nFinance (MEF), and comprises a national project coordinator from MOWRAM (undersecretary \nof state level) as secretary and representatives (undersecretary of state or director levels) of \nconcerned ministries.30 The PSC will be responsible for overall direction of the Project and \ninteragency coordination, and will meet at least twice a year.  \n \n39.  MOWRAM will be the Executing Agency, as it is the ministry with a mandate for planning \nand  managing  the  use  and  conservation  of  Cambodia\u2019s  water  resources.  MOWRAM  has \nincreased its technical and project management skills considerably through practical experience \nin projects financed by ADB and other agencies (Appendix 2) and has satisfactorily executed \nthose  projects.  A  project  management  office  (PMO)  was  established  within  MOWRAM  to \nmanage and implement ongoing projects.31 MOWRAM will appoint a dedicated project manager \nin the PMO to head a team comprising technical and administrative staff. The PMO will assume \noverall responsibility for implementation of the Project using current PMO staff and drawing \nadditional specialist staff (on a part or full time basis as required) from relevant MOWRAM \ndepartments. The PMO will be responsible for day-to-day management issues. \n \n40.  Project  Management  and  Coordination  at  Provincial  Level.  Four  PIUs  will  be \nestablished in PDWRAM in the project provinces to be headed by a full-time provincial project \nmanager\u2014with qualifications acceptable to ADB and AFD-assisted by seconded staff from each \nof the relevant line agencies.32 Each PIU will have technical and administrative staff and access \nto PDWRAM\u2019s technical specialists from other sections as required. The PIU will be responsible \nfor day-to-day management of project activities at the provincial level. Provincial coordination \nwill be achieved through a provincial project coordination committee (PPCC) chaired by a \nprovincial deputy governor and comprising representatives (director level) of the provincial line \n                                                 \n29  MAFF, Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), MOWRAM, MLMUPC, MRD, Council for the Development of \nCambodia. \n30  MEF,  MOWRAM,  MAFF,  MOE,  MLMUPC,  MRD,  Ministry  of  Public  Work  and  Transport,  and  Council  for \nDevelopment of Cambodia. \n31  The PMO is currently managing the ADB-financed Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project (to be completed in \n2003), the Stung Chinit Irrigation and Rural Infrastructure Project (to be completed in 2007), and the World Bank-\nfinanced Flood Emergency Rehabilitation Project (to be completed in 2004). \n32  Provincial Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; Provincial Department of Land Management, Urban \nPlanning and Construction; and Provincial Department of Environment. ", "13 \ndepartments directly concerned with the Project. Similar interagency coordination arrangements \nare functioning satisfactorily under the ongoing ADB/AFD-funded Stung Chinit Irrigation and \nRural Infrastructure Project. After the screening process, all qualifying investments proposed \nunder the Project will be referred by the PIU to PPCC for approval before final ratification by \nMOWRAM, ADB, and AFD. \n \n41.  Environmental Impact Monitoring. An Environment Management Unit (EMU) will be \nestablished within the PMO and staffed by one environmental specialist (seconded from the \nMinistry of Environment [MOE]) and one sociologist. Similarly, at the provincial level, each PIU \nwill have one environmental specialist seconded from the Provincial Department of Environment \n(PDE). The EMU will be responsible for (i) guiding and monitoring the preparation of IEE \nrequired  for  each  subproject  at  feasibility  stage  in  accordance  with  the  agreed-upon \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures (Supplementary Appendix D); (ii) timely \nsubmission of IEEs to the concerned environmental agencies, ADB and AFD, for clearance \nbefore detailed design and construction begin; (iii) ensuring that recommended environmental \nmitigation measures recommended in the IEEs are incorporated into the design and civil works \ncontracts and in subsequent operations of subprojects; and (iv) ensuring that environmental \nmonitoring is adequately reported in project review and progress reporting. Seconded PDE staff \nin  PIUs  will  (i)  assist  in  preparing  individual  subproject  IEEs,  (ii)  ensure  adoption  of \nrecommended  mitigation  measures  during  construction,  (iii)  monitor  water  quality  in  all \nsubproject locations, and (iv) report environmental monitoring results to the EMU. International \nand domestic environmentalist specialists recruited under the Project will help building the \ncapacity of central and provincial environmental units.  \n \n42.  Monitoring Resettlement and Land Planning. During design preparation, resettlement \nworking groups were established in all target provinces except Siem Reap. Each group consists \nof  representatives  from  PDWRAM  (3),  PDAFF  (2),  and  PDLMUPC  (2).  Implementation \nprocedures (as detailed in the agreed-upon RF) that have been established will be continued in  \npreparing the RPs required for noncore subprojects. MOWRAM\u2019s Resettlement Unit33 will be \nresponsible for (i) supervising the provincial working groups in the landholding identification \nsurveys, socioeconomic surveys, detailed measurements for identifying affected people, and \nland adjustments/consolidations resolution process required for the RPs and that will take place \nin conjunction with the feasibility study and subsequent detailed engineering design; and (ii) \npreparing the RPs and submitting them to the IRC, ADB, and AFD for endorsement and \nsubsequent implementation through MEF. Execution of the RPs will be monitored externally \nunder  contract  to  suitably  qualified  NGOs.  One  output  of  the  boundary  identification  and \nlandholding surveys and subsequent adjustment will be a landholding registry maintained at the \ndistrict land registration offices for subsequent use in the issue of land tenure certificates and \ntitles. \n \n43.  Water Resources Multiuser Committees.  Multiuser committees for management of \nwater resources will be established at basin level where subprojects draw water from sources \nthat are used by others (e.g., interbasin transfer canals, river barrages, and medium- size \nreservoirs). Apart from actual water users, such committees will have the representatives from \nthe relevant local government (e.g., district or commune), and provincial departments. Overall \n                                                 \n33  A Resettlement Unit within MOWRAM was set up and trained under ADB. 1999.

Goods and works to be financed from the ADB loan proceeds will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works contracts estimated to cost \nmore than $1,000,000 equivalent will be awarded through international competitive bidding \n(ICB) procedures, and contracts costing $1,000,000 or less through local competitive bidding34 \n(LCB). Vehicles, equipment, and materials valued at more than $500,000 equivalent will be \nprocured through ICB, and those valued $500,000 or less through international shopping (IS). \nSmall or off-the-shelf goods and materials valued at less than $100,000 may be procured using \ndirect purchase arrangements. The contract packages are presented in Appendix 11. \n \n3.  Consulting Services \n45.  The AFD grant will be used to finance approximately 366 person-months of consulting \nservices (133 international and 233 domestic), in the fields of project management, institutional \nand  water  policy  development,  legal  aspects,  irrigation  management  transfer  regulation, \nresettlement and land management, hydrology and river basin development, water resources \nmanagement,  irrigation  design  engineering  and  construction  supervision,  environmental \nmanagement, project performance monitoring and evaluation, agriculture extension, training, \ncommunity development and water user formation, and rural credit (areas of expertise and \nstaffing schedule are in Appendix 12, and detailed terms of reference are in Supplementary \nAppendix  E).  AFD-financed consulting services will be engaged in accordance with AFD\u2019s \nprocedures. ADB will endorse the selection and engagement of the consultants based on their \ncompetence and experience. \n \n46.  Consultant financed by ADB loan proceeds will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants. ADB will finance topographic surveys, river basin studies, socioeconomic \nsurveys, environmental impact assessments, detailed engineering design, economic analyses, \nand supervision of construction works. Domestic consulting firms with access to international \nexpertise, and individual domestic consultants will carry out these activities. The firms will be \nrecruited using the quality- and cost-based selection procedures. ADB will also finance activities \nrelated to community development, specialized training, and external monitoring of resettlement \nactions.  The  activities  will  be  carried  out  by  NGOs  (domestic  and  international)  and  local \nspecialized institutions. Where the number of qualified NGOs or institutions is limited, direct \nselection  may  be  applied  with  the  prior  approval  of  ADB  and  AFD.  MOWRAM,  with  the \nassistance of the AFD-financed consultants, will prepare the detailed terms of reference and \ncost estimates for each ADB-financed consultancy contract. \n \n4.  Disbursement Arrangements \n47.  Through budgetary allocation, the Government will make available the proceeds of the \nloan  to  the  PMO  and  the  PIUs  to  pay  eligible  project  items.  To  ensure  effective  project \nimplementation  and  timely  disbursement,  the  Government  will,  immediately  after  loan \neffectiveness, open and maintain with the National Bank of Cambodia a first-generation imprest \naccount for the PMO. Concurrently, a second-generation imprest account for the PIUs will be \n                                                 \n34  Eligible bidders under LCB include provincial and national entities. ", "15 \nopened with a  recognized commercial bank, acceptable to ADB, in each of the four project \nprovinces. Opening of all five imprest accounts will be subject to the appointment of a qualified \naccountant (at MOWRAM level) and administrative staff (at PIU level) and the establishment by \nMOWRAM and four PIUs of accounting systems and internal control acceptable to ADB in \naccordance  with  the  Project  Accounting  Manual  issued  by  MEF  (23  June  1998)  and  its \namendments.  Each  imprest  account  will  be  managed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (January 2001). The initial total amount in each second-generation \nimprest account will not exceed $50,000, while the ceiling of the first generation-imprest account \nwill not $1,000,000. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedures may be used to reimburse \nexpenditures and liquidate imprest accounts for payments below the ceiling of $50,000 for the \nfirst-generation imprest account and the ceiling of $10,000 for the second-generation imprest \naccounts. \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n48.  The PIUs will submit to the PMO monthly financial reports and quarterly progress reports \ndetailing the physical and financial progress of activities against the targets and summarizing \nproject performance. In turn, the PMO will submit to MOWRAM for onward submission to the \nGovernment, ADB, and AFD consolidated quarterly progress reports (including environmental \nmonitoring)  and  a  comprehensive  annual  progress  report.  Within  3  months  of  project \ncompletion, the PMO will prepare and submit to ADB and AFD a project completion report, in \nADB standard format. \n \n49.  Within 6 months after loan effectiveness, MOWRAM will establish a simple computerized \nmanagement information system suited to project needs in the PMO for efficient monitoring, \nfinancial management, and reporting of component progress and contracts. The PMO and PIUs \nwill establish and maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify income and \nexpenditures relating to the Project. MOWRAM will compile the consolidated project accounts \nand  related  financial  statements  to  be  audited  annually  by  independent  external  auditors \nselected through LCB and acceptable to ADB and AFD. The annual audit report will include a \nseparate audit opinion on the use of the imprest accounts and statement of expenditure \nprocedure. Audited financial statements and project accounts, together with the report of the \nauditor, will be submitted to ADB and AFD within 9 months of the close of the financial year. \n \n6.  Operation and Maintenance \n50.  Irrigation infrastructure rehabilitated/constructed under the Project will require O&M35 \nduring and after the Project. In line with the Government policy on IMT, the beneficiaries\u2014 \norganized in FWUCs and WUGS\u2014will be responsible for overall O&M of the secondary and \ntertiary canal and drain systems, while the Government will be responsible for the primary canal \nand drain systems and the headworks. The Government will also be responsible for emergency \nmaintenance  of  the  overall  infrastructure.  Loan  funds,  counterpart  funds,  and  beneficiary \ncontribution will fund in part the O&M costs. Loan funds will be provided on a declining share \n                                                 \n35  Maintenance of irrigation schemes comprises of: (i) routine maintenance covering small-scale work needed on a \nroutine basis throughout the year and responsibility for which can be entirely transferred to the beneficiaries; (ii) \nperiodic maintenance covering more substantial repairs that needs to be planned when the system is shut down; \n(iii) emergency maintenance covering urgent or temporary repairs to maintain water delivery following sudden \nfailure of the system. Organization and financing of the latter two categories are usually outside the capacity of the \nbeneficiary communities. ", "16 \nover time,36 while counterpart funds and beneficiary contribution will increase proportionally to \nmeet full maintenance requirements by project completion. To ensure timely disbursement of \ngovernment counterpart funds, a maintenance account will be established in each project \nprovince to be replenished annually from a budgetary allocation (or other available national or \nprovincial sources).  Disbursement from these maintenance accounts will be jointly managed \nand monitored by the respective PDWRAMs and PIUs and regularly reviewed by the PMO, \nADB, and AFD. The accounts will be subject to a separate audit opinion (as part of the overall \nproject annual external audit). Similar arrangements will be used for participating FWUCs: \nirrigation water fees collected will be deposited to facilitate timely disbursement of beneficiary \ncontribution to maintenance. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n51.  The Project will adopt ADB\u2019s project performance management system (PPMS). A \ncomputerized management information system will be developed and implemented to monitor \nand evaluate the implementation performance and development impacts of the Project at \nvarious stages of its cycle. The system will build on the experience gained (i) in developing a \ncomputerized database system under previous ADB-financed technical assistance,37 (ii) through \nthe baseline surveys and data collected during the study of the core subprojects, and (iii) the \nbenefit monitoring and evaluation activities for other ADB-financed projects implemented by \nMOWRAM.  \n \n8.  Project Review \n52.  During the initial 3 years of the Project, ADB, AFD, and the Government will jointly carry \nout  semiannual  reviews  to  (i)  determine  if  all  proposed  implementation  arrangements  are \nappropriate and in place; (ii) assess progress in selecting the subprojects; (iii) review the \nresettlement and land adjustment program; (iv) review the study, design, and construction \nprograms; and (v) review the conduct and outcomes of the capacity building and training \nactivities. At the end of year 3, ADB, AFD, and the Government will undertake a comprehensive \nmidterm review in consultation with the PSC. Before this midterm review, the PMO will prepare \na comprehensive report identifying issues for the mission\u2019s consideration.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Financial and Economic Benefits \n53.  The immediate benefit from the Project is increased productivity\u2014a yield response of \napproximately 100%\u2014that is realistically achievable through improved water management and \navailability  and  technological  changes  in  production.  It  will  be  expressed  as  increased \nhousehold incomes from improved productivity and diversification for farmers with larger areas \nof irrigated land. In the case of poor households, it will mean improved food security and \nreduced localized food deficits that are common in the more remote areas of the northwest. The \ngreatest benefit will come from increased cropping options with a more secure water supply. \nWhile benefits have been assessed primarily on the incremental paddy yields for both wet and, \nwhere possible, dry season cropping, diversified cropping activities have been incorporated, \n                                                 \n36  For project costing purposes, the average figures of 100% for year 1 after completion of the subproject, 60% for \nyear 2, 40% for year 3, 20% for year 4, and none thereafter, for ADB\u2019s share of the O&M costs for each subproject \nhas been used. However, these figures will be revised on a case-by-case basis and in compliance with the \nagreement to be passed between the irrigation management transfer stakeholders of each particular scheme. \n37  Capacity Building in MOWRAM (footnote 33) and Northwest Irrigation Sector Project (footnote 19). ", "17 \nwhere marketing options permit, resulting in further gains in household incomes. The average \nincremental family income from higher-yielding varieties of wet season rice and vegetable \ndiversification in the sample subproject of Po Pi Deum is estimated at $275 per annum. \n \n54.  Economic analyses carried out for the core subproject show economic internal rates of \nreturn (EIRRs) between 14.3% and 17.8% (Appendix 13). The EIRRs are robust to delays in \nbenefits  and  to  increases  in  the  capital  cost  of  the  subprojects.  There  are  adequate \nopportunities for developing subprojects of a similar nature, with relatively low capital investment \nin small to medium-size command areas that will ensure reasonable financial and economic \ninternal rates of return to justify a sector approach. \n \nB.  Social Benefits and Impact \n55.  Participation. Participatory consultations initiated during project preparation and loan \nprocessing stages will continue through FWUCs and subordinate WUGs during implementation \nto ensure that (i) design of delivery and drainage canals and the associated land adjustment \nprocess have the support of all beneficiaries, and (ii) the beneficiaries progressively participate \nin managing the scheme and assume control of their share of O&M. \n \n56.  Poverty  Reduction.  The  project  provinces  are  among  the  poorest  in  Cambodia. \nAverage provincial poverty levels range from 24% to 54%, with numerous pockets of poverty \nreaching 60% and higher. The rural poor comprise marginal farmer and landless households, \nand women living in households with female heads (25% of households). Food insecurity is \nrelated to lack of secure water supplies, loss of standing crops to natural disasters, as well as \nlack of access to productive resources and employment opportunities. The Project will have \ndirect beneficial impacts on poverty reduction by (i) improving food security for rice-deficient \nhouseholds;  (ii)  improving  access  of  marginal  farmer  households  to  irrigation  through  the \nconstruction of tertiary and quaternary canals; (iii) improving the access of landless households \nto rice lands through leasing of expanded irrigated land; and (iv) over a period of time, improving \nagricultural  incomes  through  diversification  of  production.  Poor  and  vulnerable  groups, \nparticularly women, will be able to participate in FWUCs and WUGs and benefit from training in \nwater management and agricultural practices and from facilitated access to rural credit provided \nby NGOs through extension workers deployed for these activities. \n \n57.  Other Social Benefits. The social development aspect of the Project extends beyond \nfood security and incremental household incomes. It includes (i) empowering farmers through \nWUGs and FWUCs group initiatives\u2014training in group cohesion and management, participation \nof the poor and women in decision making, conflict resolution, etc., (ii) providing new economic \nopportunities in a suitable manner for beneficiaries; (iii) improving access to dry season water \nsupplies  for  domestic  purposes;  and  (iv)  reducing  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases \nresulting  from  better  water  management.  The  registration  of  landholdings  with  the  district \nadministration  during  resettlement  and  land  consolidation  processes  is  a  legal  means  of \nassuring  ownership  and  tenure.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  assessment  is \npresented in Appendix 14. \n \nC.  Environmental Impacts and Measures \n58.  An  overall  environmental  assessment  and  IEEs  for  three  representative  core \nsubprojects were carried out during project preparation (a sample summary IEE and sample full \nIEEs are in Supplementary Appendix F). Their conclusions indicate that the Project is unlikely to \nresult in any serious negative environmental impacts because (i) no subproject will be located ", "18 \nwithin a forest, wildlife reserve, or sanctuary, or within the multiple use zone of the Tonle Sap \nBiosphere Reserve; (ii) subprojects will be limited to a maximum size of 3,000 ha; and (iii) all \nsubprojects will be subject to an IEE (including an environmental management plan) to be \nreviewed and approved by MOE, ADB, and AFD before design and construction activities begin. \nEnvironmental assessment and review procedures (Supplementary Appendix D) were prepared \nin accordance with the newly approved ADB  Guidelines for Environmental Assessment  and \nhave been approved by Government. \n \nD.  Risks Assessment \n59.  The concept of IWRM to river basin development is still new in Cambodia and there is \na  risk  that  its  adoption  will  be  slow  and  not  as  comprehensive  as  desired.  Government \ncommitment is clear in its current water sector legal and policy framework and key MOWRAM \nand PDWRAMs staff have already been exposed to the concept, in both theoretical and \npractical ways during project preparation. The Project also has adequate provision for additional \ncapacity building to ensure adoption and use of the approach. \n \n60.  Slow farmer adoption of improved techniques of irrigated agricultural production, \nwater management practices, and production diversification has the potential to delay the \nproject benefits. The subprojects will rehabilitate existing irrigation schemes where a resident \nknowledge of irrigated agriculture exists. Also with improved security of water supplies, risk \nmanagement will be less an issue in determining cropping activities and testing improved \nmethods of production. In addition, extensive investment in community development will help \nfarmers\u2019  early  and  sustained  involvement  in  designing  and  implementing  on-farm irrigation \nmanagement and irrigated agricultural extension, and in the continuing development of end-user \nownership. Furthermore, the Project will work closely with programs already operating in the \nsubproject areas and agencies that have already accumulated considerable experience in rice \nfarming systems.38 \n \n61.  There is a risk that with inadequate maintenance, the anticipated increase in crop \nyields will decline to pre-investment levels. Success of the Project requires active beneficiary \nparticipation  in  O&M  and  management  of  the  schemes  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of \ninvestments  and  to  reduce  the  financial  burden  on  the  Government.  The  Project  directs \nsubstantial resources to early and sustained investment in human capital by establishing, \nsupporting,  and  strengthening  FWUCs  and  subordinate  WUGs  and  developing  end-user \nownership. This investment will also require reviewing and refining current policies, strategies, \nand regulations relating to IMT. The Project also provides for maintenance of the rehabilitated \ninfrastructure and requires the government and the beneficiaries to shoulder a substantial share \nof maintenance expenditure immediately after rehabilitation. The Government has specifically  \nassured regarding the timely availability of counterpart funds, and the Project will monitor the \nannual allocation to provincial maintenance accounts. \n \n62.  There is also a risk that a significantly greater than estimated capital investment will \neventually be needed in subproject rehabilitation. With a sector lending approach, this risk is \nsomewhat diminished and will be addressed through (i) thorough screening during identification \nof  candidate  subprojects;  and  (ii)  an  iterative  selection  and  prioritization  process  through \nsuccessive comprehensive feasibility studies, detailed survey and design, and cost estimate \nleading to ultimate approval of a subproject investment prior to implementation. \n                                                 \n38  Including the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), the Cambodian Agriculture Research Development \nInstitute (CARDI), the Cambodia-Australian Agricultural Extension Project, and AFD.

In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and MOWRAM have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will (a) before the Law on Water Resources Management is \napproved by the National Assembly, begin the work to prepare the required \nsubdecrees to define the statutes, rights, and duties of FWUCs and the process \nfor IMT; (b) not later than 12 months following approval of the Law on Water \nResources Management, promulgate and declare the Law on Water Resources \nManagement effective; and (iii) finalize and promulgate these subdecrees not \nlater  than  6  months  after  the  Law  on  Water  Resources  Management  is \npromulgated. \n(ii)  The Government will provide counterpart funds for timely project implementation. \nThe Government will make timely submissions of annual budgetary appropriation \nrequests and ensure prompt disbursement of appropriated funds during each \nproject implementation year. \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that following project completion, the infrastructure \nconstructed/rehabilitated  under  the  subprojects  will  be  maintained  in  good \nworking conditions. To this end, the Government will continue to provide funds \nthrough budgetary allocations for its share of routine O&M, and for periodic and \nemergency maintenance of such infrastructure. \n(iv)  The  Government  and  MOWRAM  will  ensure  that  (i)  the  EMU  ensure  full \ncompliance of the Project with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines, the \nGovernment\u2019s laws and regulations, and best environmental practices; and that \nthe Project will meet the mitigation and monitoring requirements described in the \nagreed  upon  environmental  assessments  and  review  procedures;  and  (ii) \nadequate budgetary provisions will be made for environmental assessment and \nreview of subprojects, implementation of mitigation measures, environmental \nmonitoring, and institutional arrangements for coordination and supervision as \nidentified in the subproject IEEs. \n(v)  The Government and MOWRAM will remove, at their own cost, all mines or \nunexploded  ordnance  suspected  to  exist  on  subproject  sites  (reservoirs, \nheadworks,  canals,  and  command  areas).  Further,  the  Government  and \nMOWRAM will engage the services of a reputable and experienced mine security \norganization, acceptable to ADB and AFD, to confirm whether the concerned \narea is clear. The Government will ensure that no subproject rehabilitation will \nstart until demining has been completed and certification to that effect has been \nobtained. \n(vi)  The  Government  and  MOWRAM  will  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement activities are implemented in accordance with all applicable laws \nand regulations and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement as set out in the \nagreed-upon resettlement framework. The Government will provide unforeseen \ncost in excess of budget estimates to meet the requirements outlined in the \nresettlement  plans.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  land  adjustment \nprogram at the tertiary and quaternary canals will not adversely affect the villages \nand individual farmers. ", "20 \n(vii)  The Government and MOWRAM will ensure that subprojects will be selected in \naccordance with the agreed upon process set out in Appendix 4. \n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  provides  full  opportunities  for \nwomen participation in the FWUCs, WUGs, and IEWs, and will implement the \ngender action plan, which has been approved by the Government and ADB, to \nreach the targets aimed at maximizing women's participation in project activities \nand benefits. \n \nB.

Prior to loan effectiveness, the following will have been completed: \n \n(i)  The national water resources policy developed by MOWRAM with the assistance \nof ADB will have been approved by the Council of Ministers. \n(ii)  A dedicated full-time project manager within the PMO, specifically assigned to \nthe Project, together with the required technical and administrative staff and \nseconded staff, with qualifications acceptable to ADB and AFD, will have been \nappointed. \n(iii)  PPCCs and PIUs will have been established and all necessary staff, including \nseconded staff, with qualifications acceptable to ADB and AFD, will have been \nappointed. \n(iv)  The Government will provide evidence that the AFD grant has been confirmed \nand all conditions precedent to its effectiveness (other than a condition requiring \neffectiveness of the ADB loan) have been fulfilled. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n65.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the  loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 12,572,000 to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Northwest Irrigation \nSector Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% \nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nTadao Chino \n  President \n17 November 2003 ", "  Appendix 1  21 \nSECTOR/SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Agriculture and Crop Production \n1.  Agriculture accounts for 39% of Cambodia\u2019s gross domestic product and is the main \nsource of livelihood of 70% of the rural population. Agricultural productivity is low compared with \nthat in other Southeast Asian countries with similar agroclimatic conditions because of, among \nothers, the highly variable rainfall, limited irrigation development, and poor performance of \nexisting irrigation facilities. Rice is the predominant crop (90% of the 2.6 million hectares [ha] \ncropped area) accounting for 46% of the economic value added in agriculture and providing \nabout 70% of the average nutritional intake (estimated at 151 kilograms of rice1). Wet season \nrice\u2013(yielding 3.2 million tons, or about 80% of total rice production) is grown between May and \nSeptember on the extensive central floodplains of the Mekong River and the lowlands around \nthe Tonle Sap under rain-fed conditions and consists predominantly of local varieties preferred \nfor domestic consumption. Because of the flat terrain and poor drainage, flooding is common \nand wet season planting begins either on well-drained areas or after the rainy season due to \nlocalized inundation. Dry season rice (0.8 million tons), consisting of high-yielding varieties, is \ngrown between December and March. It is the higher yielding and more profitable crop, most of \nwhich is marketed. In 2000, the average rice yield was 3.2 and 1.9 tons/hectare (t/ha) for dry \nand wet season crops, respectively\u2014well below levels achieved in neighboring countries. In \naverage to good years, Cambodia is considered barely self-sufficient in rice, but this is only true \nnationally; sufficiency at the provincial level varies considerably (in 2001, 13 out of 24 provinces \nreported deficits).2 Due to the limited rural road networks (resulting in high transport costs and \nrestricted access to markets) and localized droughts and flooding, many rural households, \nespecially in the northwest region, continue to suffer rice deficits for up to 6 months of the year.3 \nB.  Irrigation Subsector \n2.  Cambodia is considered as a water-wealthy country with a water availability of nearly \n50,000 cubic meters per person per year. The wet season varies considerably from year-to-year \nand it is common for extended periodic droughts to occur during the rainy season and impose \nshortages of water for domestic and agricultural purposes. The irrigated land area is currently \nestimated at 19% of the total area under food crop production (2.6 million ha), of which only \n0.26 million ha remain fully operational. Low dry season river flows (due to the deforestation of \ncatchments) and limited retention of water in upper catchments make extensive double-cropping \nimpractical over much of the country, and certainly in the northwest region. Irrigation is used \nmostly to supplement rainfall at the start and/or end of the rainy season and during drought. \nNevertheless, irrigated areas yield 54% of total agricultural production and 31% of the total rice \nproduction.  Further  development  of  irrigation  will  lead  to  agricultural  intensification,  crop \ndiversification, and improved productivity in Cambodia. \n3.  The Mekong River Commission Secretariat4 in 1994 inventoried about 950 irrigation \nschemes. Their total estimated potential command area was about 473,000 ha but they were \n                                                 \n1  Helmers, K., 1997.

Many of the schemes were constructed under the Khmer \nRouge  regime  in  the  late  1970s.  They  were  often  predominantly  inappropriate  large-scale \nschemes, poorly designed and constructed, and difficult if not impossible to maintain. Most have \nnow fallen into disrepair and no longer function efficiently, if they ever did. Other older systems \nthat worked previously have become damaged or broken down after decades of neglect. The \nirrigation schemes still in (partial) operation are, in principle, operated and maintained by the \nusers, usually smallholders who are not often keen or able to take on this responsibility. In many \ncases, support is provided either through international organizations or limited government \nresources. \n \nC.  Institutional  Framework  in  the  Water  Resources  Sector  and  the  Irrigation \nSubsector \n4.  In 1999, the Government established the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology \n(MOWRAM) (Law 0699/98 of 23 June 1999\u2013Subdecree 58 of 30 June 1999), elevating it from \nthe  General  Directorate  of  Irrigation,  Meteorology  and  Hydrology  under  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries  (MAFF).  MOWRAM  is  responsible  for  defining  water \nresources management policies and strategies, collecting and analyzing data, planning water \nresource use, regulating water use activities that have a negative impact on the resource, and \nmitigating the impact of water-related natural disasters such as floods and droughts. The \nprevious directorate focused mainly on irrigation, hydrology, and meteorology, while MOWRAM \nnow has the broader responsibilities of developing and managing water resources. \n \n5.  Apart from MOWRAM, other ministries and agencies perform water-related management \nfunctions. The Ministry of Environment (MOE), with responsibility for water quality and pollution \ncontrol in public water areas, collects data, performs administrative and licensing functions, and \nmonitors wastewater discharges. The Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) establishes rural \nvillage  wells,  and  collects  hydrogeological  data  and  submits  them  to  MOWRAM  for  the \npreparation of groundwater maps. MAFF is responsible for managing forestry resources and \nfisheries/aquaculture. The Ministry of Industry, Mine and Energy (MIME) plans industrial water \nuses  and  the  generation  of  hydropower,  constructs  and  operates  provincial  water  supply \nutilities, and manages dedicated hydropower plants. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport \nconstructs municipal sewerage systems, collects data on wastewater, and is responsible for \nriver works for navigation purposes. The Ministry of Health is responsible for the quality of \nsurface and underground water used as public supplies. The Phnom Penh Water Supply \nAuthority collects data on drinking and municipal water supplies and manages water supply \nutilities in the capital. The Cambodia National Mekong Committee coordinates water resources \nissues in the relations with the other riparian countries of the Mekong Basin. As overall manager \nof water resources, MOWRAM has responsibilities that overlap with those of other ministries \nand agencies. To address this potential conflict, agreements exist between MOWRAM and \nMAFF, MRD, and MIME to delineate their responsibilities to specific aspects of water resources \ndevelopment. The draft Law on Water Resources Management also addresses the issue of \ninstitutional duplication. \n \n6.  MOWRAM\u2019s main  areas of activity  relating to the  management of  water for  agriculture  \nare as follows: \n \n(i)  Management and development of river basins. The specific tasks are to (a) \nprepare a river basin inventory and database; (b) develop an approach to river \nbasin management and to test it in selected priority river basins; and (c) establish ", "  Appendix 1  23 \nand  promulgate  comprehensive  plans  for  sustainable  development  and \nmanagement  of  water  resources  based  on  an  integrated  water  resource \nmanagement (IWRM) approach to river basin development. \n(ii)  Irrigation  and  drainage.  MOWRAM  will  (a)  extend  the  area  served  by \nsustainable  irrigation  and/or  drainage  systems,  particularly  where  poverty \nincidence is high; (b) establish community and beneficiary participation in all \nstages of the development and management of irrigation and drainage schemes, \ndeveloping the necessary capacity in community organizations and/or the private \nsector; (c) facilitate increasing income in the irrigated agriculture subsector to \nensure continued investments in water for crop production; and (d) strengthen \nthe technical and institutional capacity of concerned departments to implement \nirrigation and drainage development. \n(iii)  Groundwater  management.  In  this  area,  MOWRAM  will  (a)  develop  and \nenhance  the  national  groundwater  information  base;  and  (b)  develop  a \ngroundwater monitoring network and research capability for groundwater-based \nirrigation in areas without surface water. \n(iv)  Mitigation of water-related hazards. MOWRAM will develop and implement a \nnational strategy to mitigate floods and droughts. \n7.  Given  these  wide-ranging  responsibilities,  MOWRAM\u2019s  operational  effectiveness  is \nconstrained  by  limited  financial  and  human  resources  as  they  progressively  reorient  their \nactivities from physical implementation to management and monitoring. The bulk of the small \nbudgetary allocation is directed at the unrealistic staff salaries with little or no allocation for \nroutine, periodic, or emergency maintenance. Most investments in rehabilitation have come \nfrom internationally funded development projects. \n8.  In  line  with  its  decentralization  and  deconcentration  policy,  the  Government  is \nincreasingly devolving responsibilities to provincial departments that answer to both their line \nministry and to provincial governors. Provincial rural development committees are a potentially \npowerful means of coordinating water-related initiatives, as activities of provincial departments \ncan be more effectively supervised at the provincial level. Similarly, commune councils and \nvillage development committees are becoming increasingly important in water-related issues, as \nthey directly communicate the needs of individuals and families for access to drinking water, \nwater for crop irrigation, or reduction of losses caused by floods and droughts. \n \nD.  National/Sectoral Policy and Strategy Framework \n9.  The Government\u2019s primary development goal is to reduce poverty, and the Second \nSocioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDP-II,  2001\u20132005;  officially  launched  in  July  2002)5 \npresents three policy objectives designed to do so: (i) foster broad-based, sustainable economic \ngrowth that will improve the livelihood of the poor, with the private sector playing the leading \nrole; (ii) promote social and cultural development by improving access of the poor to education, \nhealth, water and sanitation, power, credit, markets, information, and appropriate technology; \nand (iii) ensure the sustainable management and use of natural resources and the environment. \nSEDP-II  emphasizes  the  importance  of  agriculture  and  rural  development to achieve its \nobjectives, identifying water resources management as a key element by the (i) accelerated \nsustainable development of irrigation and drainage systems; (ii) establishment of farmer water \n                                                 \n5  The Royal Government of Cambodia. 2002.

", "24  Appendix 1 \nuser communities (FWUCs) to manage irrigation water resources more efficiently; and (iii) \norientation of research and extension toward rain-fed lowland agro-ecosystems. \n10.  In line with SEDP-II, the Government prepared a national poverty reduction strategy \n(NPRS)6 to operationalize SEDP-II by shifting the focus of poverty reduction from a series of \nprojects to an integrated budgetary support program. Under the NPRS, land and water are seen \nas the two natural resources fundamental to both economic growth and poverty reduction, \nespecially in the rural areas where people in agriculture rely on them. The NPRS recognizes \nthat water resources management and irrigation development are part of the priority actions \nrequired to implement the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. \n \n11.  With the assistance of ADB7 and the World Bank,8 MOWRAM has achieved significant \nprogress toward establishing a legal and policy framework for the water sector, including the \nirrigation subsector, and in developing a vision for national water resources and an effective \nstrategic approach to their development and management. Several major steps have been \ntaken in recent years and significant documents have been developed, including (i) a National \nWater Sector Profile (2001) that reviews and analyzes the existing situation in the water sector, \ntogether with a short- and long-term development perspective of the sector; (ii) a draft Law on \nWater Resources Management (2001) and supporting implementation subdecrees to regulate \nthe water sector management that has passed the Council of Ministers and has been submitted \nto the National Assembly for promulgation; (iii) a draft National Water Resources Policy (2001) \nto provide a basis for managing the country\u2019s overall water resources and for developing \nsubsectoral policies and strategies that has been submitted to the Council of Ministers for \ndeliberation; (iv) a draft National Water Resources Strategy (2001) that gives an extensive list of \nproposed objectives, strategies, and actions in all areas of the water sector for incorporation in \nthe NPRS; (v) a Strategic Framework for the Water Sector (2001) based on the agenda for \nactions included in the National Water Sector Profile, and a number of MOWRAM strategic and \ninvestment plans to effect it; and (vi) an Investment Strategy for the Water Resources Sector \nthat is in its early stage of preparation. \n \n12.  All those documents have direct or indirect links to and/or make considerable mention of \narrangements for developing and managing of water resources to support agriculture and crop \nproduction. The key strategies relating specifically to the irrigation subsector are summarized in \nparas. 13-16. \n13.  Water Resources Management. The aim is to prevent conflict and competition among \nwater uses and development for different purposes (irrigated agriculture, water supply and \nsanitation, hydropower, fisheries, etc.) in different areas (basin and subbasins) and create an \nenvironment conducive to the satisfaction of present and foreseeable demands consistent with \nenvironment protection by taking these steps: (i) plan water resource use and sustainable \ndevelopment for the various purposes within priority areas (basin, subbasins, and aquifers) on \nthe basis of available data and follow the principles of IWRM in river basin development; (ii) \nlicense water uses, and apply specific measures to recover costs from end beneficiaries (i.e., \nwater fees and irrigation service fees); and (iii) control groundwater abstraction and use. \n                                                 \n6  The Royal Government of Cambodia.

The target is to expand operational irrigated \nareas from 19.5% to 24% of the total cropped area by the year 2007 and thus enhance food \nsecurity, provide job opportunities, and increase rural incomes, particularly in areas with a high \nincidence of poverty. In the short and medium term, this task will involve (i) rehabilitating\u2014 \nwhere  justifiable  on  technical,  economic,  and  social  grounds\u2014existing  irrigation  schemes, \nmainly in flooded areas and priority reservoirs in lowland areas; (ii) developing cost-effective, \nshort-gestation, appropriate and effective private irrigation technologies (i.e., small low-lift pump \nsystems); and (iii) developing small-scale smallholder gravity irrigation schemes. In the medium \nto long term, infrastructure development will involve the improvement and expansion of areas \ncovered by medium-scale and large irrigation schemes in the lowland areas as the institutional \ncapacity for planning, construction, management and operation, and maintenance of such \nsystems is developed. \n15.  Financial  Sustainability  of  Irrigation  Infrastructure.  To  ensure  the  financial \nsustainability of irrigation infrastructure, arrangements for the participation of users in managing \nthe rehabilitated and newly constructed irrigation schemes will be introduced. This will require (i) \nimproving the participation of farmers, communities, stakeholders, and the private sector at all \nstages  of  the  development  and  management  of  irrigation  schemes;  (ii)  developing  a \ncomprehensive  regulatory  framework  for  beneficiary  involvement  in  participatory  irrigation \nmanagement and the technical and financial aspects of operation and maintenance (O&M) of \nirrigation facilities (including recovery of service delivery and O&M costs through introduction of \nirrigation service fees); (iii) forming and/or strengthening FWUCs and subordinate water user \ngroups to enhance cooperation among farmers in operating, maintaining, and managing the \nschemes; (iv) introducing irrigation management transfer to gradually shift O&M responsibilities \nfrom MOWRAM to FWUCs; (iv) strengthening the capacity of local government and FWUCs in \nparticipatory irrigation management, development, and  O&M; (v) promoting crop diversification; \n(vi) improving rural credit access; and (vii) implementing the land titling legislation to ensure \nsecurity of tenure and stimulate farmers to invest in O&M. \n16.  Capacity Building. To create an enabling environment for IWRM and development, the \nfollowing steps will be taken: (i) elaborate and adopt subdecrees for implementing the Water \nLaw; (ii) establish an interministerial working group (comprising MOWRAM, MAFF, MRD, and \nMOE) to guide the development of and investments in the irrigation sector (para. 17); (iii) \nstrengthen the capability within MOWRAM both at the central and at decentralized levels for all \nphases or development, rehabilitation, and sustainable management of irrigation schemes; (iv) \nstrengthen  the  database  and  information  system  of  MOWRAM  to  facilitate  integrated \nmanagement of water quantity and quality and determination of the balance between availability \nand  demand;  (v)  facilitate  increased  coordination  in  irrigation  investments  among  funding \nagencies; (vi) educate  the public about their rights, obligation, and responsibilities with regard \nto sustainable water resources management through public meetings, radio broadcasts and \nprinted materials; and (vii) promote the role of women in water resources management and \nwater services delivery. \n \nE.

Through the Support for  the  Development  of  Sector  ", "26  Appendix 1 \nPolicies Project,9 MOWRAM established an interministerial working group to refine the policy for \nsustainable management of irrigation systems by directly involving the beneficiaries and other \nstakeholders. The objectives of the working group cover four strategic areas necessary to \nensure  sustainable  management  of  the  irrigation  and  drainage  systems:  (i)  develop  the \ninstitutional  framework  (regulations  and  procedures)  for  delegating  of  management \nresponsibilities; (ii) develop the financing mechanisms, including irrigation service fee collection \nand government contributions for O&M; (iii) support government institutions through training, \nprovision of advice, audit, and other specific services, and intervention in the case of natural \ndisasters, and (iv) develop a monitoring and evaluation system for assessing the performance of \nthe concerned stakeholders (government, user communities, other public and private agencies) \nin managing irrigated areas. \n \n                                                 \n9  The Support for the Development of Agriculture Sector Policies Project is financed by the French Government \nthrough the Fonds de Solidarit\u00e9 Prioritaire. The project aims to strengthen the institutional capacity of the ministries \nconcerned with the agriculture sector (mainly MAFF, MRD, and MOWRAM) to enable them to develop well-defined \nsector strategies focusing primarily on poverty reduction and food security for the rural population.

Introduction \n1.  The  resettlement  framework  sets  out  the  policy,  principles,  procedures,  and \nimplementation mechanisms applicable to all resettlement taking place in subprojects under the \nNorthwest Irrigation Sector Project. The impact is mostly on agricultural land in the corridors of \nmain and secondary or branch canals and drains and in expanded reservoirs. Land losses in \ntertiary irrigated areas will generally be absorbed in voluntary land adjustment. \n \n2.  There is no substantial relocation of communities, but only scattered and localized \nreplacement and relocation of houses built on canal embankments or in reservoirs by relatively \npoor households that migrated into these areas in recent years. \n \n3.  The impact of resettlement is more sensitive in the project areas because of the level of \npoverty of the affected and beneficiary populations\u2014 40\u201360% of the communities affected are \nclassified as poor or very poor2 and have food deficits for several months of the year. There is \nalso a high level of landlessness, often affecting people who have settled near canals and in \nreservoirs. \nB.  Resettlement Policy and Principles \n4.  There are three major elements in current national resettlement policy and practice: (i) \nthe development of a Cambodian national policy and regulatory structure; (ii) adherence to the  \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good \nPractice (1998) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB); and (iii) enactment of the 30 August \n2001 Land Law and its subdecrees, which establish rights of land ownership and of entitlement. \nA Sub-Decree on Social Concessions gives the legal basis for allocating communal land for the \npurpose of reducing landlessness and poverty, and will be a basis for replacing land lost in the \ncontext of involuntary resettlement. \n \n5.  A resettlement plan (RP) will be prepared for each selected subproject. In preparing the \nRPs, the Executing Agency (EA) will work in consultation with the affected persons (APs), \ncommune chiefs, and district and provincial resettlement officials and will take into consideration \nthe land grants that will be available to the poor in the project districts under the Social Land \nConcessions Program. The RPs will follow ADB\u2019s requirements and draft a national policy in \nestablishing the following principles: \n \n(i)  Adequate steps will be taken to minimize the impact of project works on APs and \ntheir land and structures and to mitigate any adverse effects (i.e., by choosing for \ncanals alignment and widths that minimize impact). \n(ii)  APs and their representatives will participate fully in project design and in \nplanning and implementing resettlement. They will be consulted both over \nsubproject works and timing and over resettlement proposals, and will participate \nfully in subproject design and works and in planning and implementing \nresettlement. For this purpose an information program will be conducted before \nproject implementation; an information leaflet has already been prepared. \n                                                 \n1 The full resettlement framework (RF) is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n2 Ministry of Planning and World Food Program. 2002. Estimation of Poverty Rates at Commune Level in Cambodia. \nPhnom Penh. ", "  Appendix 6  35 \n(iii)  Specific provisions will be made in RPs to safeguard or improve the welfare of \naffected vulnerable groups, including women heads of households, the aged, the \ndisabled, the very poor, landless, and minority groups. \n(iv)  The economic and social future of people will not be unfavorably affected, and \nthey will not face a material reduction in income and living standards, or \nunnecessary social and cultural dislocation as a result of the Project. \nC.  Procedure of Compensation and Rehabilitation \n6.  Before  any  construction,  compensation  will  be  made  in  the  presence  of  AP \nrepresentatives and an external monitor (EM). The entitlements are as follows: \n \n(i)  Compensation at replacement cost for houses and other affected structures \nwithout deduction for depreciation or salvageable materials. \n(ii)  For agricultural land, compensation in the form of land for land of equal \nproductive capacity, or compensation in cash permitting purchase by APs of land \nof equal quality and productivity to that lost. \n(iii)  Replacement of premises/residential land with land of equal size acceptable to \nthe AP. \n(iv)  Replacement of commercial land with land of equal size and commercial \npotential acceptable to the APs. \n \n7.  A grievance process has been established. It will allow APs who are not satisfied that \nthe compensation, replacement of lost assets, livelihoods, and allowances due to them have \nbeen fairly provided to seek redress and to make a formal complaint. A provincial resettlement \ngrievance committee will be established and similar committees created at district, commune, \nand village levels. APs may be assisted by any nongovernment organization and by the EM, \nand can take court action for this purpose without cost to the AP. \n \n8.  Severely affected persons will be eligible for economic rehabilitation assistance including \nassistance in skills training and other allowances such as \u201cdisruption allowance\u201d or \u201ctransfer and \nsubsistence allowance.\u201d \n \n9.  The RPs will allow the Government, ADB, and an EM to monitor and evaluate the \nresettlement. \n \n10.  No distinction will be made between APs with land title, and those without title and \nwhose land rights are based on land use and occupancy. \n \n11.  APs  will  be  fully  compensated  for  all  assets  lost  as  a  result  of  any  subprojects \ninfrastructure, regardless of whether APs have formal title to the land that they occupy and use. \nIn accordance with ADB guidelines, people eligible for compensation are all those who will \nexperience negative impacts on their assets and livelihoods as a result of the Project. \n \nD.  Institutional Framework \n12.  The institutional framework for preparing and implementing RPs at the national level is \nthat of an interministerial resettlement committee (IRC), which is a committee of the Council of \nMinisters administered by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). An undersecretary of \nstate of MEF is the chairman of the IRC, with members from the Ministry of Water Resources \n ", "36  Appendix 6 \nand Meteorology (MOWRAM), other implementing ministries, the municipality of Phnom Penh, \nand governors of the provinces involved in the concerned project. \n \n13.  A resettlement unit (RU) in MOWRAM will be responsible for conducting surveys and \nconsultations and for preparing RPs. For this purpose, the RU combines forces with provincial \ndepartments  in  the  concerned  province,  headed  by  the  Provincial  Department  of  Water \nResources  and  Meteorology  (PDWRAM),  as  a  provincial  resettlement  working  group \nresponsible to a provincial resettlement subcommittee. \n \n14.  The RU will conduct internal monitoring and evaluation and report at three monthly \nintervals to the IRC and to ADB. An EM appointed by MEF will work under the supervision of \nMOWRAM\u2019s RU to monitor and evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the RPs and \nto assist APs in any grievance or dispute over resettlement and compensation. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n15.

Summary \n1.  The Ponley Reservoir is one of the core subprojects selected for funding under the \nProject and studied to feasibility level during the project preparation phase. \n2.  The subproject impact on affected persons (APs) will be due mainly to the acquisition of \nland for a corridor of impact (COI) of the canal works, on average 14 meters (m) wide, and the \nincrease in area of the reservoir. Approximately 1,062 people in 189 households will be affected \nby land acquisition for the Project. No houses are affected. A total of 91 hectares (ha) of \nagricultural land will be acquired in the canal COI and in the enlarged reservoir, requiring \nreplacement or compensation. Some land in the  reservoir will become usable for recession \ncropping. \n3.  The total cost of implementing the resettlement plan (RP) is estimated to be $63,600. \n4.  Full RPs for the Ponley Reservoir subproject and  the other core subprojects studied \nduring project preparation are presented in Supplementary Appendix H. \nB.  The Project \n5.  The Ponley Reservoir is located about 50 kilometers (km) northeast of Sisophon town in \nan isolated and backward part of Banteay Meanchey Province close to the Thai border and \nsome 20 km north of National Highway No. 6. The subproject will entail raising the level and \ncapacity of the reservoir and reconstructing sluice gates, which will directly supply water to 675 \nha of irrigated land, and for that purpose constructing two branch canals and farmer field \nsystems. The embankment road will be restored and 8 km of laterite road resurfaced to improve \nall-season access. The embankment will be extended to provide flood protection to Ponley \nCheung village, and a drinking water supply system to Ponley Cheung and another village. \nC.  Socioeconomic Profile \n6.  The Ponley reservoir subproject area and its environs are frontier country. A high \nproportion of the population are comparatively recent settlers, and scrub forest is still being \ncleared and turned into rice paddies. Ponley Cheung, the main village in the area, has a rough \nand ready atmosphere to it, with houses built of weathered wood and salvaged forest material \nrather than more permanent materials. Virtually all economic activities within the subproject area \nare agriculture based. \n7.  Socioeconomic data were gathered from three sources: (i) the 1998 National Census \nand Socioeconomic Survey; (ii) a sociological and agricultural survey of the subproject area \nconducted for the feasibility study, and (iii) a baseline socioeconomic survey of all APs. \n8.  Phnom Srok district, which includes Ponley, has the highest proportion of poor \nhouseholds, 52%, in the province of Banteay Meanchey.1 Investigations during the subproject \nfeasibility study indicated that, in the four villages surveyed in Ponley commune, the proportion \nof poor and very poor ranged from 35% in Svay Sa to 70% in Ponley Cheung itself. About 60% \nof all households are ranked by the village development committees as being either poor or very \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Planning and World Food Program. 2002.

Around 30% of households face food deficit over 6 months per year, although \nthe villages of Svay Khmau (35% of households) and Svay Sa (73% of households) have a food \ndeficit for more than 6 months of the year. \n \nD.  Resettlement \n \n1.  Objectives and Principles \n \n9.  The objectives of resettlement are to minimize the impact of project works on APs and to \nensure that their assets and livelihoods are restored to at least their level before the Project. \nResettlement will follow the principles and procedures described in the resettlement framework \n(RF) that was prepared following the draft national policy and  ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement (1995) and  Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice (1998) and \nagreed upon with the Government. A summary RF is in Appendix 6 and the full RF is  in \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n \n2.  Institutional Framework \n \n10.  At the national level, the institutional framework for preparing and implementing the RP \nis, that of an interministerial resettlement committee (IRC), which is a committee of the Council \nof Ministers administered by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). An undersecretary of \nstate  of  MEF  is  chairman  of  the  IRC.  A  resettlement  unit  (RU)  in  the  Ministry  of  Water \nResources  and  Meteorology  (MOWRAM)  is  responsible  for  conducting  surveys  and \nconsultations and for preparing the RP. For this purpose, the RU will combine forces with \nprovincial departments in the province concerned, headed by the Provincial Department of \nWater Resources and Meteorology (PDWRAM), as a provincial resettlement working group \nresponsible to a provincial resettlement subcommittee. \n \n11.  The RU will conduct internal monitoring and evaluation and report at three monthly \nintervals to the IRC and to ADB. An external monitor (EM) appointed by MEF will work under the \nsupervision of MOWRAM\u2019s RU to monitor and evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of \nthe RP and to assist APs in any grievance or dispute over resettlement and compensation. \n \n3.  Valuation and Compensation \n \n12.  Land values were provisionally determined through a survey of current market values \nand through calculation of replacement costs. MEF will liaise with the provincial resettlement \nsubcommittee  and  MOWRAM  to  consult  with  APs  and  determine  compensation  or  land \nreplacement. The EM will be a qualified valuer to assist in determining land values in any \ndisagreement over values and measurements. \n \n4.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n13.  The main risks associated with resettlement in the Ponley subproject and the means of \nmitigating them are identified in Table A7. \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 7  39 \nTable A7: Risks and Mitigating Measures in the Ponley Subproject \nMain Risk  Mitigating Measure \nPoor identification at the planning stage of the  Consultation of MOWRAM\u2019s RU with engineering \nimpact of canal and reservoir construction on  divisions and provision for topographical survey \nland, people, and property   and alignments to be coordinated with DMS early \nin project design \nPoor or poorly timed information to APs and  Strengthened information dissemination, \nothers  including information booklet and newsletters \nLoss of livelihoods because of severe land loss in  Land replacement or compensation at least at \nconditions of poverty and land shortage  market levels and other measures, including \ntraining, help in job seeking and credit, to restore \nand improve sustainable incomes \nIneffective monitoring of RP implementation  Stringent terms of reference for the EM appointed \nat the start of  the pojrect for the duration of the \nproject for all subprojects \nIneffective administration of the grievance and  Support for APs at every stage by the EM trained \ngrievance resolution procedures  to provide assessment and valuation in grievance \nresolution and arbitration \nAP = affected person, DMS = detailed measurement survey, EM = external monitor, MOWRAM = Ministry of  \nWater Resources and Meteorology, RU = resettlement unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n5.  Project Resettlement Costs \n14.  Compensation  costs  are  provisionally  calculated  on  the  basis  of  replacement  or \ncompensation for agricultural land along the canal and in the reservoir. It is expected that land \nreplacement in the irrigation area will be conducted as part of a process of farmer-to-farmer \nexchange and taking into account increased irrigated cropping areas and cropping intensities. \nThe  total  cost  of  implementing  the  RP  is  estimated  as  $63,600  and  will  come  from  the \nGovernment as counterpart financing. This cost includes $13,700 for administration, of which \n$6,000 is the cost for this specific subproject of the independent EM who will be contracted to \nmonitor and evaluate all resettlement activities of the overall Project. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "40  Appendix 8 \nTable A8.1: Expenditure Accounts Cost Summary\nItem Local Foreign Total % % Total\nCurrency Exchange Cost Foreign Base\n($'000) ($'000) ($'000) Exchange Costs\n A.

Introduction \n1.  The overall purpose of the Project is to improve water resource management through \ninstitutional strengthening, infrastructure development, and agricultural support using a sector \napproach. The purpose will be achieved through the rehabilitation of small to medium-scale \nirrigation schemes servicing a potential command area of 35,000 hectares (ha)\u201419,000 ha for \nflood spreading and/or recession cropping, 16,000 ha for wet season irrigated cropping, 5,000 \nha for dry season irrigated cropping\u2014directly affecting some 24,000 families or an estimated \n120,000 beneficiaries. As a result of (i) improved water management during the wet season, (ii) \nuse of seasonal surpluses for flood spreading and/or recession practices for better management \nof  localized  flooding,  and  (iii)  greater  retention  of  surface  runoff  in  the  upper  reaches  of \ncatchments (without having detrimental impacts on downstream users), coupled with adoption \nof improved production technologies, the Project will improve food security in rice-deficit areas \nof the northwest. Improved water security will also raise household incomes where market \naccess exists by permitting diversification into high\u2013value/high\u2013yielding rice and crops of higher \nvalue.  Economic  and  financial  analyses  were  prepared  for  three  representative  core \nsubprojects, two typifying rice-insecure situations and the other, Po Pi Deum, where the better \nurban market access justifies the production of perishable, higher-value goods. \n \n2.  The analysis attempts to quantify measurable benefits based on incremental production \nof rice (primarily), the traditional crop in the area with some diversification represented by mung \nbeans and cucurbits. Other nonquantifiable benefits are expected depending on the nature of \nthe  subproject.  Flood  management  can  give  protection  to  households;  embankments  that \ndouble as rural roads can allow better access to adjacent producing areas as well as improved \naccess to social services (health and education, etc.); improved nutritional status of households \nin areas where food deficits are common, and improved access to domestic water sources that \nsurvive the dry season are all likely to be realized under the Project. Benefits from institutional \nstrengthening initiatives are considered significant because government agencies will be able to \nbetter plan and monitor development in the  water sector. As this is a sector project, the \neconomic  analysis  presented  here  and  in  Supplementary  Appendix  I  will  be  a  model  for \nassessing and selecting potential irrigation schemes to rehabilitate to achieve both food security \nand income generation through diversification. \n \nG.  Methodology \n3.  Financial prices used in the analysis were identified through a survey of the subproject \narea and cross-checked with prices identified in other projects and other secondary sources. \nEconomic prices were derived based on the following: (i) a world price numeraire was used;1 (ii) \nvalues are expressed in constant 2002 prices to exclude inflation; (iii) the US dollar is the unit of \naccount\u2014even in rural areas of Cambodia, the dollar and Thai baht are commonly accepted \ncurrencies and the riel is used for smaller purchases; (iv) for nontraded goods and services, a \nstandard conversion factor of 0.9 and a shadow wage rate factor of 0.75 were used; (v) in the \ncase of major tradable commodities, economic values were based on border parity pricing with \nstandard methods for deriving farmgate input/output prices; and (vi) transfer payments such as \ntaxes and subsidies were excluded in calculating economic values. \n                                                 \n1  A domestic price numeraire would be equally appropriate in the northwest of Cambodia as many of the local \nvillages still suffer extended food shortages for up to 6 months a year where incremental production is likely to be \nconsumed in the local or neighboring villages. Only in the more accessible areas close to Route 5 will incremental \nproduction be marketed outside the area of production, for which ample markets, both local and export, exist. \n ", "50  Appendix 13 \n4.  In the financial and economic analyses of core subprojects (Link Canal, Po Pi Deum, \nand Ponley irrigation rehabilitation), cropping patterns and technologies in the with- and without- \nproject scenarios are detailed, based on the expected changes in land use due to improved \nwater management and/or increased availability of water for dry season cropping. The with- \nproject  cropping  patterns  and  intensities  used  are  similar  to  the  changes  experienced  in \nKompong Puoy (Battambang) and Western Baray irrigation rehabilitation (Siem Reap), and \nPRASAC (Pursat) financed by the Food and  Agriculture Organization, International Labour \nOrganization, and the European Union, respectively. Per hectare production costs and returns \nfor rice using traditional production methods\u2014broadcast and transplanting techniques\u2014were \ncompared with irrigated production using increased inputs in financial and economic terms. \nBased  on  a  net  benefit  area  that  can  be  irrigated  from  due  to  project  intervention,  the \nincremental value of production in each core subproject was calculated and compared with \nrehabilitation costs. \n \n5.  The construction cost of each subproject was estimated in financial and economic terms \nbased on designs of proposed structures and earthworks. Operation and maintenance (O&M) \ncosts  were  estimated  at  $50/ha  per  annum  for  routine  maintenance  comprising  farmers\u2019 \ncontribution ($30/ha) for secondary and tertiary canals and government contribution ($20/ha) for \nheadworks and primary canals. In addition, allowance was made for a major repair of the \ninfrastructure every 7 years after construction (periodic maintenance), generally assumed to be \nequivalent to 30% of the original earthworks and 10% of the original structure cost of the \nincremental investment.2 Both benefits and costs were expressed as cash flow streams over an \nexpected 25 years to generate net present values, together with financial and economic rates of \nreturn. Finally, sensitivity analyses were performed on the outcomes by assuming scenarios \nrelating to risk factors such as shortened project life due to poor O&M, increased construction \ncosts, decreased benefits, and a drop in the price of rice. An assessment of the Project's impact \non returns to labor also gives an indication of its potential impact on poverty reduction. \n \n6.  Data for one of the three core subprojects analyzed are given in paras. 7\u201316 and \nsummarized in Tables A13.1 and A13.2. Comparative details for the remaining core subprojects \nare presented in tabular form in Table A13.3. \n \nC.  Po Pi Deum Irrigation Rehabilitation \n7.  The Po Pi Deum subproject will rehabilitate one barrage across the Mongkol Borei River \nwith an associated intake plus delivery and drainage canals to improve wet season irrigation \nand drainage on 1,400 ha while providing 350 ha of incremental dry season irrigation in a self- \ncontained area that forms part of a larger irrigation system. \n \n1.  Subproject Benefits \n8.  Incremental crop production, net of additional production costs, forms the basis of \nquantifiable benefits for this subproject. The without-project scenario assumes 1,400 ha of \ntraditional broadcast rain-fed rice during the wet season yielding 2 tons (t)/ha. The with-project \noutput is expected to reach 3.6 t/ha (a conservative estimate) phased in over 4 years due to a \ndecrease in flood damage, better drainage, and the availability of water to finish the wet season \nrice  plus  the  introduction  of  shorter-duration,  higher-yielding  aromatic  varieties,  increased \ninputs, and land leveling. After rehabilitation, there will be sufficient water for 150 ha of dry \nseason short-duration improved aromatic rice varieties, 100 ha of cucurbits, and 50 ha of mung \n                                                 \n2  No allowance was made for emergency maintenance because this cost is unpredictable. \n ", "  Appendix 13  51 \nbeans  (representing  diversified  production),  increasing  the  cropping  intensity  to  125%. \nRehabilitation of Po Pi Deum irrigation is expected to increase production of rice by 2,900 t and \ndiversified crops by 900 t, and provide incremental on-farm employment of 104,800 days per \nyear due to the additional labor inputs required in production. Financial net crop revenue will \nincrease by $165,000 and economic net crop revenue by $214,000. These figures equate to an \naverage incremental income of $118 per annum per cropped hectare (236% increase). For the \naverage farm of 1.3 ha, the average household income will increase by $275 per annum, which \nis more than adequate to meet the irrigation service fees levied by the water user groups to \nmaintain the secondary and tertiary canal networks. \n \n2.  Subproject Costs \n9.  Subproject  costs  cover  detailed  design  and  supervision,  construction,  O&M  for \nsecondary and tertiary canals ($30/ha3 contributed by beneficiaries) plus headworks and main \ncanals ($20/ha4 by the provincial government), water user group establishment and support, \nagricultural extension programs, and resettlement (land component omitted in economic costs). \nThe total financial investment cost is estimated at $635,897. Annual O&M  costs amount to \n$42,000  plus  $28,000  for  beneficiary  and  government,  respectively,  to  meet  routine \nmaintenance while the government will incur a further cost of $120,776 every 7 years for \nperiodic maintenance. This latter amount will be accumulated progressively through annual \nbudgetary allocations ($11,500) to a provincial maintenance account as piloted in the Northwest \nRural Development Project.5 Monitoring and benefit evaluation studies to be performed after \ncompletion  of  the  subproject  and  agricultural  development  initiatives  were  included  in  the \nassessment. \n \n3.  Financial Analysis \n10.  Farmer Incentives.  An estimated 1,076 households have land in the Po Pi Deum \ncommand area.6 For the average 1.3 ha farm, incremental rice production will be 2.67 t/ha per \nyear  when  the  subproject  is  fully  operational.  That  yield  is  equal  to  the  basic  nutritional \nrequirement for a six-member household without any preference for consumption above this \nlevel. Annual farm income will increase by an average of $373.7 Of this amount, $275 is from \nincremental net crop income and the balance from increased farm employment.  That amount \nwill give adequate incentive to participate in the Project. \n \n11.  Capacity and Willingness to Pay for O&M. Annual O&M costs associated with the Po \nPi Deum investment were estimated at $50/ha, of which the farmer is expected to contribute \n$30/irrigated ha ($39 per household). Incremental net crop benefits (alone) per household are a \nmultiple of seven times this requirement, suggesting that beneficiaries have adequate capacity \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1999.  Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Capacity Building in MOWRAM. Manila. \nEstimates of O&M requirements are $30-$50/ha depending on the nature of the irrigation scheme, i.e., the \npresence of significant headworks and/or main canals. \n4  Includes an allowance for maintaining the total investment, not just incremental rehabilitation. \n5  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for the Northwestern Rural Development Project. Manila. \n6  The number of households benefiting from the subproject\u2019s benefited area was calculated by dividing the benefited \narea by the average cultivated irrigable landholding per household in the surrounding villages. \n7  Including both incremental net crop income (in which all labor inputs were counted as a cost of production) as well \nas incremental returns to family labor. For that part of the incremental labor that is drawn from the farm household \nitself, these \u201cwages\u201d comprise part of household income (in addition to net crop revenue) although the additional \ntime commitment to on-farm work may partly have an opportunity cost of work and income off the farm. \n ", "52  Appendix 13 \nand incentive to protect their benefits by contributing to O&M costs.8 Their willingness to pay will \nbe reinforced by the activities of irrigation extension teams through training. It is also relevant \nthat some beneficiaries under this subproject are the pilot farmer water user community (FWUC) \nbeneficiaries under reallocated counterpart funds from the ADB-financed agriculture sector loan9 \nto promote irrigation management and transfer for the sustained operations of the subproject. \n \n12.  Implications for FWUCs.  Annual contributions to O&M from the rehabilitated area are \nestimated at $42,000 that can be paid in cash or in kind, (labor). Assuming a cash contribution \nof $20/ha, the balance of farmer obligation for O&M amounts to about 1day a month. \n \n4.  Economic Analysis \n13.  The  Po  Pi  Deum  subproject,  assessed  over  the  25-year  life  of  the  investment,  is \nexpected to be financially viable for the beneficiary farmers and economically viable for the \ncountry. The economic net present value of the net benefit stream is $250,358 (Table A13.2), \nassuming a 12% opportunity cost of capital. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is \n17.8% and the benefit-cost ratio is  1.3:1. Sensitivity analysis focused on the perceived risks \nconfronting the Project: (i) increasing construction costs; (ii) the effective life of the investment, if \nO&M is not adequately performed and project life is subsequently reduced; (iii) the price of rice, \nas farmgate price fluctuations are considered sensitive to incremental supplies (although this \nappears to be a seasonal characteristic rather than a reflection of the saturation of the market \nthroughout the year); (iv) total benefits; and (v) the actual command area achieved. \n \n14.  Investment  Cost.  While  care  was  taken  to  accurately  estimate  the  cost  of  the \nsubproject investment (that has been revised upward since the feasibility design study), it is \npossible that actual costs may be higher than the estimate. A 20% increase in investment costs \nwill cause the EIRR to fall to 15.4%. The sensitivity factor is 0.7 and the switching value occurs \nat a 59% increase in investment cost. \n \n15.  Project Life. Project sustainability is of concern in that rural infrastructure projects often \nsuffer from poor quality of construction and/or inadequate maintenance, the latter being a \nfunction of both local perceptions and limited budgetary allocations. It was assumed that, with \nproper O&M, the Po Pi Deum subproject will last for 25 years. If the project life actually turns out \nto be only 15 years because the budgetary allocation is not made for routine and periodic \nmaintenance, the EIRR will decrease to 17.4%. The switching value of project life (shorter than \nwhich the Project will have an EIRR below 12%) is 15 years less than that assumed in the base \ncase. \n \n16.  Price of Rice. Rice is the primary irrigated crop in the subproject area and forms a \nsignificant portion of project benefits. If the rice price were to decrease (relative to other prices in \nthe economy) by 20%, the EIRR will decrease to 10.7%. The switching value occurs at a 16% \ndecrease in the farmgate price. The sensitivity (a measure of volatility) of the price effect on the \nEIRR  is  2,  indicating  some  volatility.10  Once  immediate  dietary  requirements  have  been \nsatisfied, it is likely that farmers will diversify to higher-value crops such as beans or cucurbits or \n                                                 \n8  Under the Agence Francaise de D\u00e9veloppement-assisted Preah Nup Polder Project, water service fee recovery \ncurrently stands at 68%. \n9  ADB. 1996. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for the Agriculture Sector Program. Manila. \n10 Sensitivity is the absolute value of the percent change in the EIRR divided by the percent change in the risk factor.  \nA sensitivity level for the price of rice that is greater than 1 indicates that a percent change in the rice price will \nchange the EIRR by more than 1% of its base case value, indicating a relatively high degree of volatility. \n ", "  Appendix 13  53 \nother vegetable crops, as good access to the Sisophon urban market exists via the recently \nupgraded Route 5. \n \n17.   Benefits. The economic calculations were based on realistic assumptions about the \nlevel  of  project  benefits  through  increased  yields,  etc.  If  some  of  those  benefits  do  not \nmaterialize, the economic returns of the subproject will be reduced. A sensitivity test regarding a \n20% decrease in the level of general incremental benefits indicates that the EIRR will fall to \n12.6%. The switching value is at a 22% decrease in benefits, while the sensitivity of this risk \nfactor is 1.5, indicating a low degree of volatility. \n \n18.  Subproject Command Area. If the ultimate command area is less than anticipated at \nfeasibility, the economic returns will decrease. A 20% decrease in command area will cause the \nEIRR to decrease to 13.8%. The switching value is at a 28% decrease in area and the \nsensitivity factor is 1.1, indicating that returns are relatively robust to this variation. \n \n19.  Overall, the Po Pi Deum subproject is expected to have financial and economic returns \nthat are moderately robust. The price of rice is the most significant risk factor that can have an \nimpact on the subproject\u2019s economic viability (Table A13.2). With the adoption of secured water \nsupplies, farmers will be able to change their traditional production practices to grow the higher-\npriced  and  higher-yielding  aromatic  varieties  for  which  good  market  prospects  exist \n(Supplementary Appendix A). Average incremental rice production per household in Po Pi \nDeum was estimated at 2.1 t for poor households and 4.2 t for nonpoor household. For poor \nhouseholds of 5.3 people, the figure represents 400 kg of paddy per person per year, which is \nlower than the consumption levels observed in poor households in the project area. Incremental \nproduction will be consumed locally as desired consumption levels are higher than the minimal \nnutritional requirement, or will be sold outside the region to Phnom Penh or traded across the \nporous  border  depending  on  seasonal  conditions.  Marketing  inefficiencies  caused  by \ninadequate road access are not an issue in Po Pi Deum, as good roads exist with many \nmarketing options. In more remote areas of the Project, market access is being addressed \nthrough  road  development  initiatives  (footnote  5),11  further  reducing  the  risk  from  price \nreductions. Diversified cropping activities will give even higher returns in this area with the \nintroduction of higher valued crops such as vegetables, cucurbits, and beans. \n \n5.  Nonquantifiable Benefits \n20.  Various noncrop benefits due to the subproject, are not included in the calculation of \neconomic returns. For example, the rise in local household income and food production will \nresult in improved nutrition and welfare for the population. Secondary employment and business \nopportunities  are  expected  to  increase  due  to  the  rise  in  agricultural  production.  The \nrehabilitation of the barrage will also have the added benefit of enabling further rehabilitation in \nother areas of the larger irrigation scheme. Improved water management is a prerequisite for \nthe  future  development  of  this  scheme  and  the  incremental  cost  for  that  development  is \nsignificantly less once the barrage is rehabilitated. These benefits were not included in the \noverall assessment of the Po Pi Deum subproject. \n                                                 \n11 In addition, the European Union-funded Economic and Social Relaunch of the Northern Provinces, planned for \n2004, will cover all project provinces except Pursat and will focus on developing market access. \n ", " \nTable A13.1: Po Pi Deum: Agricultural Production and Revenue in Economic Terms \n( 2010 prices in constant 2002 dollars)\nAvg 1 ha\nScheme Without the Project Farma 54\nPhysical Economic EcGornoosmsic PErcoodnuocmtioicn EcGornoosmsic ENceotn Cormopic ENceotn Cormopic        \nArea Yield Production Price Revenue Cost/ha Cost Income Income A\np\nCrops (ha) (t/ha) (t) ($/t) ($) ($/ha) ($) ($) ($) p\ne\nn\nd\nImp.

Poverty Impact \n21.  While agricultural production benefits are likely to accrue almost entirely to landowners, \nit is estimated that the poor have 277 ha, or 19.8% of the command area and can be expected \nto get a similar proportion of incremental net crop income. Overall, when combining crop \nproduction and labor income, the poor may receive 41.1% of the full local financial benefits of \nthe subproject. While the distribution among poor households is likely to be uneven, the average \nannual incremental increase in household income among the poor is expected to be $315 in \nfinancial terms, and the average incremental increase in rice production on farms of the poor to \nbe 2,11 t. The poor can also expect to benefit from the incremental crop production wage \nincome on their own land10 in addition to being hired on an actual wage basis to cover part (50% \nis  assumed  in  this  analysis)  of  the  increased  labor  needs  of  the  nonpoor  farms  in  the \nsubproject\u2019s benefited area.11 \n \n7.

Linkage to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national priority  Sector identified as National Priority in  \nin Country Poverty Analysis?    Yes  Country Poverty Partnership Agreement?  Yes \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: 90% of the poor in Cambodia are found in rural \nareas. Nearly 70% of rural households (HHs) depend on agriculture for their livelihood. A strong link exists between \nthe incidence of poverty and agricultural productivity among the large numbers of small-scale subsistence producers \nwhere food deficits of greater than 6 months each year are common. Food insecurity is an important indicator of \npoverty and communities themselves classify food-insecure HHs as poor. Water resources are a key factor in \npromoting agricultural productivity to improve food security, income generation, job creation, and the general quality \nof life in rural areas. Through the development of the water resources sector, the Project will improve the agriculture \nsector, which contributes 39% of the gross domestic product (GDP), and employs 70% of the labor force. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis       Proposed Classification:   Poverty Intervention \nWith political stability returning to the northwest as late as 1998, the region has been left out of many development \ninitiatives (largely aid-funded) until the past decade. In terms of overall poverty incidence, Siem Reap Province ranks \nsecond among the 24 provinces while Banteay Meanchey and Pursat rank 7th and 8th, respectively. Battambang \nProvince\u2019s ranking (14th) is skewed by the large urban population in Battambang township that masks the \nwidespread poverty in the southern rural districts of that province. Based on surveys in the core subproject areas \nduring project preparation, 60% of HHs live below the poverty line1 and 60% suffer food deficits as early as 4 months \nafter the annual harvest. With increasing deforestation in the area, the option of foraging, hunting, and collecting \nforest products is rapidly declining so that coping mechanisms have become less secure. Health and education \nindicators are very poor, with 11,000 people per health center and less than 20% of inhabitants completing primary \neducation. Literacy rates of 46.2% are overstated as it includes those who are only partially literate. Only 1.25% of \nthe rural population have access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Most rely on hand-dug wells and streams that \nbecome fouled during the long dry season and experience a high incidence of waterborne diseases and parasitic \ninfections. Competition for the better agricultural land has intensified with the increased political stability and mine \nclearance activities, and the extent of landless HHs is estimated at 20%, even though they may still sharecrop on \nothers\u2019 land. \nThe poor HHs are characterized by having smaller plots of land (0.2-0.5 hectare (ha) compared with an average of \n1.3 ha) or no land at all, mostly in rain-fed areas. Where irrigation exists, their plots are usually found on the outer \nextremities of schemes where the delivery of water is unreliable. Poor HHs plant traditional varieties with minimal \ninputs of animal dung, achieve well below average yields from their smallholdings, and have no access to credit. \nThey live in areas with limited access to markets because of poor rural roads and have limited employment \nopportunities other than in neighboring farmers\u2019 fields. What little land they have tends to be poorly drained and \nprone to annual flooding. They live in houses made of natural materials collected from forest areas, in conditions that \nare unhygienic, undermining health and income-earning opportunities. In most cases, physical and social exclusion \ncompound the other, resulting in a perpetual poverty cycle of poor access to basic infrastructure and services, poor \nhealth,  poor  living  conditions,  low  productivity,  and  hence  low  incomes.  Some  groups  are  more  prone  to \npoverty- HHs headed by women and HHs with elderly and disabled family members where excessive workloads are \nimposed on the remaining HH members and traditional gender-related activities such as water collection are \nreallocated. \nProject  Strategies  for  Poverty  Reduction.  While  the  Project  is  constrained  by  the  availability  of  water  in \nundertaking irrigation rehabilitation, the selection criteria adopted during project design and during implementation \nwill ensure that priority is accorded to schemes with the greatest potential to contribute to poverty reduction. The \ndevelopment  of  irrigation  water  resources  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  poverty  reduction  through  increased \nemployment opportunities as well as other social benefits. The Project will enable the poor to participate equitably in \nproject activities and benefit from them. Communities to be included in all subprojects will enter into agreements with \nthe Project to construct through community effort tertiary and quaternary canals, which will improve access to water \nfor landholdings of the marginal farmers located at distances from the canal. Such agreements will be monitored by \nthe Project and will form part of the basis for the Project undertaking construction and rehabilitation works for \nirrigation improvements. All water user groups will include representatives of marginal farmer HHs as well as landless \nHHs living and working in the area. The Project will deploy irrigation extension workers (IEWs) who will work with the \nfarmer water user groups, and will provide training and facilitation services in forming groups and decision making, in \nagriculture extension, and in diversification of income-generating activities (off-farm livelihoods activities including \nlivestock rearing and fisheries). The IEWs will facilitate the participation of the poor HHs, particularly the landless \nHHs, in the water user groups to improve their capacity to benefit from livelihood opportunities, i.e., by improving \ntheir access to water for health and hygiene, or their access to microfinance for productive activities through \n1 The expenditure required to provide one individual with a calorific intake of 2,100 calories per day \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \ntheir access to water for health and hygiene, or their access to microfinance for productive activities through \nmembership in such groups. It will also facilitate access to washing points and drinking water supplies created \nthrough the improved water resources infrastructure. Poverty reduction impacts of the Project will be monitored and \nevaluated through participatory approaches. Beneficiary groups, particularly the poor will be fully involved in \nmonitoring project outcomes, and their effectiveness in reducing poverty and vulnerability. The Project will also \nmonitor the participation of the poor in the farmer water user groups and in group- based training programs, and the \nextent to which the poor are enabled to access microfinance resources from microfinance institutions. Certainly, the \nempowerment of farmers to assume responsibility for irrigation management and transfer through water user groups \nwill address the special needs of the disadvantaged groups and will also contribute significantly to breaking the \npoverty cycle. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nInitial Stakeholder Analysis. During project preparation, a participatory approach was adopted in carrying out the \nsocial investigations using focus group discussions and participatory rural appraisals within the rural communities \nincluding women and disadvantaged  groups,  and  in  identifying  potential  subprojects  with  a  wider  group  of \nstakeholders including provincial and district administrations. During processing, stakeholder participation ensured \nthat local government staff were aware of the poverty objectives of the Project and used those criteria in selecting \neligible subprojects to be considered for financing. \nProject Participation Strategy. The strategy for participation during subproject implementation will begin at the \nfeasibility study stage with beneficiary information and awareness campaigns, and early identification of any \nresettlement requirements. Greater beneficiary participation will be required during the detailed design stage in (i) \ndetermining canal alignments; (ii) initiating the land adjustment and consolidation process that will eventually lead to \nthe development of a landholding registry to be used in the subsequent issue of cadastral titles; and (iii) initiating the \nprocess of establishing farmer water user communities (FWUCs) and subordinate water user groups (WUGs). To \nassist in this participatory process, the Project will fund irrigation extension teams (IETs) to be recruited through \nsuitably experienced mass organizations and comprising a social/community development specialist, an irrigation \nmanagement specialist and, later, an agricultural extension specialist. Once the scheme is rehabilitated, the \nparticipation of beneficiaries will continue with the IETs training and strengthening the FWUCs in view of the \nprogressive transfer of irrigation management transfer and scheme ownership. This overall participatory process will \nrequire extensive support from the IETs to identify and assist disadvantaged and vulnerable groups within the \nFWUCs and WUGs and in training them in gender awareness, group management, etc. The sustainability of the \nproject intervention will depend on the successful participation of the beneficiaries. \n \nD.  Gender and Development \nProject Gender Strategies.  Gender is closely linked with poverty in Cambodia. Rural women in general lack access \nto agricultural training and extension. They are also disadvantaged by the lack of clean drinking water supplies, and \nclean water for personal hygiene. Women bear the responsibility for domestic work and health care for sick family \nmembers. Their participation in community decision making is low. The lack of gender sensitivity among providers of \nagricultural training and extension further exacerbates the problem. Although women provide a significant amount of \nlabor in agriculture, they are hardly targeted in official training and extension programs, have limited representation in \nlocal committees and, consequently, lower access to information. HHs headed by females (about 15% of the HHs in \nthe studied core subproject areas), especially in the northwest, tend to be poorer on account of high dependency \nlevels, lack of adequate adult labor (in particular male labor for income generation), heavy work burdens, low levels \nof education of female household heads (5\u201310% lower literacy rates in the studied subproject areas), low health \nlevels, low level of access to land, and lack of capacity to undertake cultivation on account of lack of capital and \ninputs (although they are often considered as lower credit risks) among other factors.  \nThe Project will adopt gender strategies to reach out to poor women through improved access to services, inputs, \ntraining, and capital. Women beneficiaries will be helped to join WUGs and participate in all group activities. Of the \nIEWs deployed by the Project at field level, 30% will be women and will be particularly responsible for facilitating \nwomen\u2019s empowerment (decision making) and participation in project activities. All group members will be trained in \ngender issues to create at grassroots level the capacity to improve gender relations and facilitate equitable \nparticipation by the poor in project activities. Women farmers will be particularly targeted in all extension and training \nactivities\u2014including seed production, inputs supply\u2014and be selected as key farmers for demonstration activities. \nThey will also be targeted for specific training in microfinance and livelihoods diversification. Women beneficiaries will \nbe particularly involved in decision making related to the setting up of washing points and drinking water supply to \nbenefit them by reducing their drudgery and increasing their time for other activities. All project monitoring and \nevaluation will be gender responsive. Gender impacts will be measured by changes in women\u2019s access to water \nresources,  improved  crop  production,  improvements  in  income,  food  security,  other  livelihood  opportunities, \nparticipation in training, access to decision making in the groups, changes in the gender division of labor, and overall \n ", "  Appendix 14  59 \n \nparticipation in training, access to decision making in the groups, changes in the gender division of labor, and overall \nimpacts on gender and poverty and gender relations in the community. Monitoring will be participatory and the \nresults will be used to further improve implementation. \n \nA gender plan has been prepared and is presented in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \nE.  Social Issues \nSubject  Level  Strategy to Address Issue  Output \nPrepared \nResettlement  Significant   Sample resettlement plans (RPs) were prepared for core subprojects  RF and full \nand a resettlement framework (RF) to guide the preparation of an RP for  RPs for the \neach subproject during project implementation.  core \nThe RP for each subproject will be prepared, implemented, and  subprojects\nmonitored. Appointed IETs will facilitate community participation in \nselecting the final canal alignments and locating structures that will \nservice the local communities such as roads and canal bridges, aimed \nas minimizing disruption and land acquisition. Steps will be taken to \nensure adequate livelihood restoration for affected people, particularly \ndisadvantaged and vulnerable HHs. \nAffordability  Significant  The social analysis identified some 20% poor and disadvantaged HHs  No \nthat will become project beneficiaries. The financial analysis confirmed \nthat the potential benefits from improved water management will provide \nsufficient incentive to obtain their participation in scheme operation and \nmaintenance. The social support program provided through IETs will \nalso help these groups develop the necessary linkages so as to benefit \nfrom agricultural development initiatives. \nLabor  Positive  The Project will have a positive impact through jobs created for  No \nincreased agricultural production. \nIndigenous  Not  The Project will not have any significant impact on any indigenous  No \nPeoples  significant  peoples. \nOther Risks  Not  The risk of increased use of pesticides and other agrochemicals in the  No \nSignificant  project area is limited, given the small total command area contemplated \nfor intensive (dry season) cropping. However, pest management training \nwill be contracted to specialized institutions. An Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)-funded  technical  assistance  for  reducing  and  eliminating \npersistent organic pesticides in the Tonle Sap basin is planned for 2003, \nand  improvement  of  the  regulatory  system  to  ensure  quality  of \nagrochemicals traded in the market is addressed under the ongoing \nADB-funded Agriculture Sector Program and will be continued under the \nproposed Agriculture Sector Development Program.  \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R242-03 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20031119154126Z", "Title": "R242-03", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 5.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20040127152712+08'00'"}, "author_page": "  PRASAC  \u2013  Rehabilitation and Support Program for Cambodia\u2019s \nAgricultural Sector \n  PSC  \u2013  project steering committee \n  RF  \u2013  resettlement framework \n  RP  \u2013  resettlement plan \n  RU  \u2013  Resettlement Unit \n  SEDP-II  \u2013  Second Socio-Economic Development Plan \n  t/a  \u2013  ton per hectare \n  WUG  \u2013  water user group \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \n \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \nThis report was prepared by a team consisting of A.
