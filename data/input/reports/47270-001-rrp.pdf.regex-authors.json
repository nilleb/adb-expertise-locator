THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the Madhya Pradesh District Connectivity Sector Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will improve about 1600 km of major district roads in the state of Madhya \nPradesh, in line with the state\u2019s road development plan for 2013-2033. It will involve upgrading \nmajor district roads to intermediate lane-width of 5.5 m, or two lane-width of 7 m, depending on \ntraffic requirements, including reconstruction, widening and strengthening culverts and bridges, \nand maintaining the improved road assets for a period of five years after construction.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Madhya  Pradesh  is  the  second  largest  state  in  India,  with  an  area  of  about \n308,000 square km. It is among the poorer states in the country, with per capita income about \n60% of the national average. However, the gross state domestic product grew at a compound \nannual  growth  rate  of  8.8%  during  2005\u20132013,  fostered  through  a  series  of  development \nmeasures.4 These  include  developments  on  the  Delhi\u2013Mumbai  Industrial  Corridor  passing \nthrough Madhya Pradesh, 229 notified industrial areas, 19 growth centers, four notified special \neconomic  zones,  and  12  product-specific  industrial  parks.  With  a  population  of  about \n72.6 million, agriculture is the mainstay of the state\u2019s economy and about 73% of the people live \nin  rural  areas.  The  dispersed  nature  of  industrial  development  and  agricultural  production \nmeans that the road network is a critical element of the economic infrastructure.  \n \n4.  The  state  has  a  road network  of  about  127,000  km\u20144,700 km  national  highways, \n11,000 km state highways, and 20,000 km MDRs. Rural roads make up the balance. The \nnumber of registered vehicles has increased by about 10% per year, from about 3 million in \n2001 to about 8 million in 2011. Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation (MPRDC) \nprojects vehicular growth of more than 7% per year over 2011\u20132021.5 Average daily traffic has \nalso increased. More traffic will need greater road capacity to maintain service levels and better \nmaintenance. MPRDC estimates that more than $1.2 billion will be required over 2013\u20132023 to \nmeet investment requirements in the state road sector.6 \n  \n5.  The  state  is  close to  completing the  upgrade of the  state  highway  network  with  a \ncombination of budgetary allocations, previous Asian Development Bank (ADB) support, and \npublic\u2013private  partnerships.  However,  MDRs  have  received  marginal  attention,  and  major \nportions  still  need  to  be  upgraded.  The  state  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  has  now \ncommenced improvement of MDRs as a critical part of the state road network, as proposed in \nTable 1. Even after the proposed assistance from ADB, a significant length of MDRs will need to \nbe improved, for which the government of India is exploring budgetary and bilateral agency \nfinancing. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for TA 8598 IND: Preparing \nMadhya Pradesh District Connectivity Sector Project. \n4  Government of Madhya Pradesh, Department of Economics and Statistics. 2013.

ADB has assisted the state government of Madhya Pradesh with three previous loans \nfor addressing improvements to state highways,7 and ADB\u2019s loans to the central line ministry for \nthe national rural roads scheme have been used to improve rural roads in the state.8 MDRs, \nwhich constitute about 20% of the state road network, form a key link between rural roads and \nstate highways, and connect the state at the district level. Across the country, various programs \nhave been undertaken to develop national highways, state roads, and rural roads. However, \ndistrict  roads,  which  form  20%\u201330%  of  the  road  network,  have  not  had  such  a  planned \napproach. For ADB, this will be an opportunity to initiate a planned approach for district roads, \nand will be ADB\u2019s first loan for district roads in the country. Developing this network will foster \ninclusiveness by enabling larger segments of the state\u2019s population to better access markets \nand basic services. The project is consistent with the strategic objective set out in the country \npartnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 on development of the state road network focusing on lagging \nstates;  and  the  transport  sector  objective  of  increased,  more  efficient,  and  sustainable \nmovement of people and goods.9 The project is not included in the country operations business \nplan,  2013\u20132015. 10  However,  the  Department  of  Economic  Affairs  has  requested  ADB \nassistance for the project. \n \n7.  Modality. The project is prepared as a sector loan, which is well suited for the financial \nassistance because (i) the project pertains to a number of MDRs distributed across the state; \n(ii) the state has a sector development plan in place (Development Plan for State Roads in \nMadhya Pradesh, 2013\u20132033); and (iii) the state has the institutional capacity to prepare and \nimplement the sector plan and to prepare the individual road packages. MPRDC, set up under \nADB technical assistance (TA), is crucial to this capacity.11 MPRDC was incorporated in 2004, \nand designated a highway authority under the state\u2019s highway legislation to develop state \nhighways, MDRs, and other infrastructure. 12 The chief minister of Madhya Pradesh is chair of \nthe  board  of  MPRDC,  and  the  minister  for  Madhya  Pradesh  Public  Works  Department \n(MPPWD) and the chief secretary of the state are vice\u2013chairs. MPRDC has developed a strong \n                                                \n7   ADB. 2002.

MPRDC has substantive \nexperience from prior ADB loans in project design and implementation.  \n \n8.  Sample roads. Under the sector lending modality, four sample subprojects have been \nprepared:  (i)  Chitrangi\u2013Kasar  road,  (ii)  Dabra\u2013Bhitarwar\u2013Harsi  road,  (iii)  Mahua\u2013Chuawahi \nroad, and (iv) Ujjain\u2013Maksi road. These sample roads aggregate to about 188 km, about 11% of \nproposed  road  length  under  the  project,  for  which  the  project  cost  is  assessed  as  about \n$77 million. The non-sample roads will be selected and approved in line with the criteria and \nprocess outlined in the project administration manual (PAM).13 \n \n9.  Sustainable  maintenance.  To  ensure  better  construction  quality  and  better \nmaintenance  of  the  road  assets  after  construction,  the  project  will  include  a  5-year, \nperformance-based maintenance period adjunct to the construction contract. This will transfer \nsome construction quality risk and maintenance risk to the private sector, and provide better \nvalue for money to the users. While this is being done on national and state highway projects in \nthe country, this project is among the first system-wide attempt for MDRs in a state. \n \n10.  Road safety and accident response. Previous ADB loans have supported MPRDC\u2019s \nefforts  to  improve  road  safety  and  design  an  accident  response  system.  MPRDC  is \nimplementing  a  geographical  information-based,  information  technology-enabled  accident \nresponse system in the state. To make the system amenable to the first-response financial \nneeds of accident victims, MPRDC is also proposing to link insurance funds to the accident \nresponse system; this linkage will be the first such initiative in the country. MDRs improved \nunder this project will also be covered by the accident response and insurance fund structure. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the project will be improved road transport connectivity in the state of \nMadhya Pradesh. The outcome of the project will be improved road transport efficiency in \nMadhya Pradesh. \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The  project  outputs  will  be  (i)  MDRs  reconstructed  and  rehabilitated  to  all-weather \nstandards  and  designed  for  road  safety;  and  (ii)  improved  road  maintenance  and  asset \nmanagement.  About  1,600  km  of  MDRs  will  be  reconstructed  and  rehabilitated  to  an \nintermediate lane width of 5.5 m, or two-lane width of 7.0 m, depending on traffic requirements. \nContracts will include 5-year performance-based maintenance obligations. MDRs under the \nproject will be integrated into the accident response system being developed by MPRDC. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n13.  The project is estimated to cost $500 million (Table 2). Detailed cost estimates by \nfinancier and by year are included in the PAM.  \n \n   \n                                                \n13 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \nTable 2: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n  Item  Amount a \nA.

Interest during construction for the ADB loan(s) is computed at the \n5-year forward London interbank offered rate plus a spread of 0.5% and maturity premium of 0.10%. Commitment \ncharges for an ADB loan are 0.15% per year on the undisbursed loan amount.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n14.  The government of India has requested a loan of $350,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. The \ngovernment of India has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. The government of India has requested that repayment \nfollow the equal repayment option. Based on the above loan terms and repayment option, the \naverage loan maturity is 15.25 years and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per \nannum. \n \n15.  The financing plan is in Table 3. The ADB loan will finance 70% of the project cost. This \nis considered acceptable, taking into account that the state government of Madhya Pradesh has \nallocated counterpart financing for 30% of the cost. By including more roads in the loan, the \nbenefits will be spread into more areas of the state. \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \n     Ordinary capital resources (loan)  350   70 \nGovernment (state government of Madhya Pradesh)  150   30 \nTotal  500  100 \nSources: Government of Madhya Pradesh and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The executing agency for the project will be the state government of Madhya Pradesh \nacting through MPRDC. MPRDC  will implement the project through its field offices at key \nlocations, which will be responsible for day-to-day project implementation and management, \nand will assign staff to work on the project. One or two full-time project managers will be \nassigned for each contract package. The project managers will be delegated adequate technical \nand  administrative  authority  for  expeditious  project  implementation.  MPRDC  will  engage \n ", "5 \nconstruction  supervision  consultants  as  the  engineers  for  the  construction  contracts.  All \nprocurement of goods and works will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). All consultants will be recruited according to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n17.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe PAM.  \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2014\u2013April 2018 \nEstimated completion date  30 April 2018 \nManagement \n(i)   Executing agency  Government of Madhya Pradesh, acting through MPRDC \n(ii)   Implementation unit  10 project implementation units of MPRDC at Bhopal, Gwalior (2), Indore (2), \nJabalpur, Rewa (2), Sagar, and Ujjain.

ADB approved advance contracting of civil works in December 2013. During project \npreparation, MPRDC\u2019s procurement activities for the sample roads were well advanced. Based \non this, the government of India requested retroactive financing for all project components. Up \nto 20% of the loan proceeds will be eligible for retroactive financing, provided that expenditures \nare incurred on works, equipment, and consulting services for the project in accordance with \nagreed procedures and during the 12 months before the signing of the loan agreement. The \ngovernment of India and MPRDC have been informed that approval of advance contracting and \nretroactive financing does not in any way commit ADB to finance the project. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n19.  The project was prepared with the enhanced capacity of MPRDC, gained through the \nthree previous ADB loans and TA provided for capacity building. MPRDC engaged consultants \nwith its own funds to prepare detailed design documents for roads proposed for ADB financing, \nincorporating  ADB  requirements  of  economic,  social,  and  environmental  studies  into  the \nconsultants\u2019 terms of reference. ADB engaged a consultant firm under project preparatory TA to \nconduct due diligence to ensure the consultants\u2019 work complies with ADB requirements. The \nengineering design was prepared to avoid or minimize land acquisition as well as social and \nenvironmental impacts, take road safety into account, and minimize climate change risks. In \naddition, advance actions have been taken to ensure the construction can commence early. All \nof these measures have improved project readiness and will mitigate the risk of delay. \n ", "6 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  The economic evaluation of the project followed the standard practice of comparing life \ncycle road and user costs with and without the project, using the net present value with a 12% \ndiscount rate and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as decision criteria. The highway \ndevelopment and management system was used in the analysis, which focused on transport \ncost  savings.  Value  added  from  better  transport  links,  resulting  in  new  industries  and \nemployment, are captured through benefits from generated traffic. \n     \n21.  The EIRR for the sample roads evaluated is 15.6% for the Chitrangi\u2013Kasar Road, 17.6% \nfor the Mahua\u2013Chuwahi Road, 23.0% for the Dabra\u2013Bhitarwar\u2013Harsi Road, and 21.9% for the \nUjjain\u2013Maksi Road. Overall, sample roads have an EIRR that satisfies the economic efficiency \ncriteria. The sensitivity of the EIRR for the sample project roads was analyzed with respect to \nchanges  in  the  benefit  and  cost  streams.  The  following  sensitivity  cases  were  examined: \n(i) construction costs increased by 10%, (ii) vehicle operating cost and travel time savings \nreduced by 10%, (iii) construction cost increased by 10% and vehicle operating cost and travel \ntime savings reduced by 10%, and (iv) a 1-year delay in project commencement. The results \nshow the quantified economic benefits are robust to various sensitivity tests. All selected roads \nhave an EIRR above 12% in all sensitivity tests. \n \n22.  Financial sustainability. Incremental recurrent costs associated with the project are \nestimated to be 0.80% of the current maintenance budget of MPRDC and 0.03% of the overall \nMPPWD maintenance budget on an annual basis. The allocation for the annual average road \nmaintenance budget for 2010\u20132013 was Rs179 million for MPRDC and Rs4,113 million for \nMPPWD. It is reasonable to expect that funds will be available to meet the maintenance costs. \n \nC.  Governance \n23.  Institutional capacity. The executing agency, MPRDC, was incorporated in 2004 under \nthe Companies Act, 1956, and is an entity wholly owned by the state government of Madhya \nPradesh. MPRDC\u2019s board includes the highest levels of political and administrative officers in \nthe state. It has 10 divisional offices across the state. MPRDC has been the implementing \nagency for three prior ADB loans and is familiar with ADB procedures. It also manages many \npublic\u2013private partnership projects and has strong institutional capacity.   \n  \n24.  Financial  management. An assessment of MPRDC\u2019s accounting systems, financial \nreporting, and external audit procedures concluded that the capacity of MPRDC is adequate in \nproject  financial  accounting  and  in  ADB  disbursement  procedures  due  to  significant  prior \nexperience with ADB-funded projects. MPRDC follows double-entry accrual-based accounting \nand prepares financial statements in accordance with Indian accounting standards. MPRDC will \nmaintain separate project accounts and records by funding source for all expenditures incurred \non the project. Project accounts will follow accounting principles and practices prescribed by the  \naccounting laws and regulations of the government of India. Internal audit is carried out by a \nfirm  of  chartered  accountants  appointed  by  MPRDC.  External  audit  is  conducted  by \nindependent  auditors  from  the  panel  of  auditors  appointed  by  the  comptroller  and  auditor \ngeneral in accordance with auditing standards issued by the government of India. \n \n25.  Procurement.  MPRDC  has  extensive  experience  of  procurement  and  consultant \nrecruitment for ADB projects, as well as use of various forms of public\u2013private partnership for \nroad projects. Goods and works will be procured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \nAll civil works will be procured through international competitive bidding. All consulting firms will \n ", "7 \nbe recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using quality- and \ncost-based  selection,  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20.  MPRDC  has  prepared  the  bid \ndocuments and commenced procurement for the first four works contracts and for recruitment of \nthe supervision consultants for the project as part of advance action. The procurement plan for \nthe project is in the PAM. \n \n26.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government of India and MPRDC. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  Madhya  Pradesh  encompasses  an  area  of  about  308,000  square  kilometers\u2014the \nsecond largest state in India. It is one of the less developed states in India, with a human \ndevelopment index of 0.375 in 2011, which is well below the national average.14 Agriculture is \nthe main sector in the local economy. A social impact assessment found that the poor road \nconditions  were  preventing  safe  and  reliable  travel,  especially  during  the  rainy  season. \nImproved  roads  will  increase  new  economic  and  employment  opportunities  by  improving \nlinkages to commercial facilities. Rural communities will benefit by having faster and more \nreliable transport of their produce to markets and by receiving higher profit margins. Access to \npublic and social service facilities (such as government agencies, health centers, and schools) \nwill also be improved. Project beneficiaries include local residents, road users, businesses, \ncommercial services, and government workers. The project roads cover 29 districts in the state. \nAbout 48 million residents live in the project districts. Provisions are in the bidding documents \nfor the civil works contracts to comply with core labor standards.15  \n \n28.  Gender.  The  gender  indicators  for  Madhya  Pradesh  are  low  at  930  females  per \n1,000 males. The state has a lower sex ratio than the national average of 940, which is low in \ninternational comparison.15 During the social study, 17 women-only focus group discussions \nwere  held.  The  discussions  revealed  that  women  are  not  actively  engaged  in  family  and \ncommunity  decision-making  processes.  Women  indicated  that  poor  road  conditions  were \npreventing safe and reliable travel. Improved road conditions are expected to provide (i) better \naccess to health services, higher levels of education, and social interactions; and (ii) better \npublic and private transport options. Gender-sensitive features include (i) integrating road safety \nfeatures for the elderly, women, children, and people with disabilities into road design such as \nproper signage, marked crossings, and pedestrian paths at appropriate locations; (ii) giving \npreference to employing local women and vulnerable groups for road maintenance during the 5-\nyear maintenance period, and ensuring that provisions for equal wages for equal work done by \nboth male and female skilled and unskilled labor in project works are in the bidding documents; \n(iii) providing training to all staff employed in routine road maintenance, which will generate \nabout 146 person-years of employment; (iv) appointing a social and gender focal person at \nMPRDC and project implementation unit (PIU) level; and (v) building the capacity of MPRDC \nstaff on gender-inclusive design and mainstreaming gender in project preparation, consultation, \nroad construction, and maintenance. \n \n                                                \n14 Government of India, Planning Commission. 2011.

The  adult  HIV  prevalence  in India  is  0.27%  as  of 2011. New  infections \ndeclined 57% from 2000 to 2011, and AIDS-related deaths dropped 29% from 2007 to 2011.16 \nAccording to India\u2019s National AIDS Control Organisation, HIV infection is typically concentrated \namong the poor and marginalized groups (including such high-risk groups as sex workers, drug \nusers, migrant laborers, and truck drivers). Madhya Pradesh is a low-prevalence state. Based \non the poverty and social assessment, the project will not increase HIV/AIDS incidence as all \nimproved  roads  will  be  along  the  existing  corridor.  Contractors  will  carry  out  HIV/AIDS \nawareness for laborers at work sites, monitored by the construction supervision consultants.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  Involuntary resettlement. The project is categorized B according to ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). The project was developed with a view to avoid land acquisition and \ninvoluntary  resettlement  by  adopting  the  most  feasible  technical  design.  The  proposed \nimprovement  of  roads  will  occur  within  the  existing  right-of-way.  For  sample  subprojects, \nmeaningful consultation and information disclosure were undertaken during preparation. No \nland acquisition is envisaged, but 34 roadside vendors will experience temporary disruption to \ntheir livelihoods during construction. A due diligence report has been prepared for the sample \nsubprojects. The sample subprojects are representative of the kinds of impact likely to be \nencountered in non-sample roads. For the sector project, a resettlement framework has been \nprepared  in  accordance  with  the  acts  and  policies  of  the government  if India,  and  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  framework  will  guide  the  screening  and  planning  for  all \nsubsequent  subprojects  that  have  resettlement  impacts.  Displaced  persons,  if  any,  will  be \ncompensated  at  replacement  cost;  and  rates  for  different  categories  of  loss  and  special \nassistance are detailed in the framework. If any changes or additional land requirements or \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts are identified during implementation, a resettlement plan will \nbe prepared or updated. ADB\u2019s prior approval will be obtained before further implementation of \nthe relevant section of the subproject. MPRDC is experienced in implementing ADB projects. At \nthe MPRDC level, two dedicated staff will oversee the project; and at the implementation level, \neach of the 10 PIUs of MPRDC will have a social safeguard focal person. \n \n31.  Indigenous people. The project is categorized C in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. Madhya Pradesh has a significant tribal population, which constitutes more \nthan one-fifth of its total population. The state is home to 46 \u201cscheduled tribes.\u201d17 The tribal \npopulation  is  largely  concentrated  in  and around the forest  area.  All project  roads  will  be \nimproved within the existing alignment and no greenfield construction will take place. The \npoverty and social assessment survey confirmed that the socioeconomic impacts will not differ \nbetween tribal groups and non-tribal groups. Subprojects with impacts on indigenous peoples \nwill not be financed. An indigenous peoples planning framework has been prepared to guide \nscreening of the impact of non-sample subprojects.  \n \n32.  Environmental impact. The scope of works under the sample subprojects involves \nimprovement and maintenance of existing MDRs. Adequate right-of-way is available for all the \nsample subprojects and no significant, long-term, or irreversible environmental impacts are \nexpected. Therefore, the sample subprojects have been categorized B in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Initial  environmental  examination  reports  have  been \nprepared for each of the four sample subprojects in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \n                                                \n16 Government of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. 2011.

An environmental assessment and review \nframework has been prepared to guide compliance with environment safeguard requirements \nunder the Ministry of Environment and Forests of the Government of India as well as the \nSafeguard Policy Statement for the non-sample subprojects, and will be disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite. According to the environmental assessment and review framework, no category A \nsubprojects will be included under the project. Anticipated environmental impacts under the \nsample subprojects during construction entail typical road construction-related issues such as \ngeneration  of  dust,  noise,  exhaust,  waste  from  construction  and  worker  camps,  water \ncontamination,  occupational  health  and  safety,  erosion,  and  siltation.  Potential  operational \nimpacts such as noise, pollution, and safety issues caused by increased traffic are expected to \nbe insignificant. Mitigation measures to address all construction and operation-related impacts \nhave been included in the environmental management plan (EMP) prepared as part of the initial \nenvironmental examination. The EMP will form part of the bidding documents and be mandatory \nfor implementation by the contractor. Meaningful consultations have been conducted during the \nproject preparation stage, and all concerns of the affected persons and stakeholders have been \nincorporated in the initial environmental examination and EMP. A grievance redress mechanism \nhas been established to continue receiving feedback and complaints, if any, from affected \nparties and addressing them during the construction and operation stages. \n \n33.  MPRDC has implemented three ADB projects since 2002, so it is well versed with ADB \nsafeguard requirements. However, the environment and social cell within MPRDC has only one \ndedicated officer to manage both environment and social safeguards. Hence, the staffing of the \ncell  will  be  increased  by  one  additional  environment  safeguards  expert  and  two  social \nsafeguards experts, bringing the total number of staff to four. At the site level, the respective \ndivisional office of MPRDC will be the PIU. The four sample subprojects will have a total of three \nPIUs. Each PIU will have one focal person for managing environment and social safeguards. \nThe environment and social cell at MPRDC and safeguards focal person at the PIU will be \nsupported by an environmental specialist under the construction supervision consultant (CSC) \nfor regular monitoring and reporting on EMP implementation. An initial coordination-cum-training \nworkshop will be carried out by ADB and the CSC environmental specialist during the pre-\nconstruction stage for MPRDC staff, other CSC staff, and the contractors. Further training will \nbe conducted during the construction stages as necessary. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.18 The assessment indicates that the overall \nrisk assessment considering the management measures is low, and the integrated benefits and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \nTable 5: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInitial delays in  MPRDC has prepared the detailed design for the four sample roads, and has \nproject  completed safeguard related surveys and reviews. Detailed project reports (DPRs) for \nimplementation  the non-sample roads are also progressing well, and are expected to be completed by \nNovember 2014. For sample roads, consultant recruitment for construction supervision \nand procurement for works contracts has been initiated, and in progress. Procurement \nactions for non-sample roads will commence in November 2014. Project designs have \nbeen prepared to minimize land acquisition. However, because of the large number of \n                                                \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nnon-sample roads, the risk after mitigation is still medium. \nSustainability of  Engineers and construction supervision consultants will be engaged for quality checks \nroad  in accordance with contracts. ADB will undertake frequent review missions to ensure \nmaintenance  timely undertaking and quality of contracts. Ten project implementation units are \nenvisaged, distributed around the state near work sites. These units will be supported \nby three separate firms of construction supervision consultants. The introduction of 5-\nyear performance-based maintenance in works contracts will substantially increase \ncontractor accountability for construction quality. Despite these steps, quality control \nand checking will be an activity that is best addressed by field staff. The roads are \ndispersed geographically throughout this large state. Therefore, the level of risk after \nmitigation is still medium. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MPRDC = Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n35.  The Government of India, state government of Madhya Pradesh, and MPRDC have \nassured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies \nincluding  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement, \nconsulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  project  administration \nmanual and loan documents \n \n36.  The Government of India, state government of Madhya Pradesh, and MPRDC have \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement \nand project agreement.  \n \nV.
