The Central Asian republics are endowed \nwith significant energy resources, but the distribution is highly skewed. The Kyrgyz Republic and \nTajikistan have abundant hydro resources, while Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are \nrich  in  fossil  fuels.  During  the  Soviet  Union  time,  power  systems  in  Kazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan were developed and optimized to operate as \na  synchronized  regional  grid  commonly  known  as  CAPS.2 The  Coordinating  Dispatch  Center-\nEnergy in Tashkent, Uzbekistan\u2019s capital, maintains the balanced and synchronized operation of \nCAPS. Power exchange among the countries was 25.4 terawatt hours (TWh) in 1990,3 but after \nthe breakup of the Soviet Union, it sharply declined and reduced to less than 1.3 TWh in 2017.4 \n\n \n4. \nThe  electricity  systems  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and Tajikistan,  which  are largely  run  on \nhydropower generation facilities, played a vital role in CAPS by providing frequency regulation. \nTwo 500-kilovolt (kV) and eight 220 kV interconnection lines with Uzbekistan enabled Tajikistan \nto export summer surplus electricity and balance the winter deficit through imports from CAPS \ncountries.5 Historically, Tajikistan was a net importer of electricity. \n\n \n5. \nIn November 2009, in response to a grid failure in Tajikistan that led to a regional blackout \nin  CAPS  countries,  Tajikistan  was  disconnected  from  CAPS.  This  failure  was  attributed  to  an \noutdated transmission relay protection system, which failed to promptly isolate the incident within \nTajikistan, triggering cascade blackouts and affecting CAPS operations, particularly in Uzbekistan. \nThe  failure  highlighted  the  obsoleteness  of  relay  protection  infrastructure  in  Tajikistan.  The \nprotection system had not been properly maintained or replaced, compromising the integrity and \nreliability  of the grid. Well-coordinated  protection relays  and their  integrity  are  essential for  the \noperation of electricity systems, particularly the parallel operation of regional power systems.6  \n\n \n6. \nTajikistan\u2019s  isolation  had  a  substantial  impact  on  the  operations  of  CAPS  and  its  own \npower system. Because of the lack of frequency regulation from Tajikistan, CAPS dispatchers, \nparticularly in Uzbekistan, needed to maintain higher spinning reserves at thermal power plants, \nconsuming expensive fossil fuels, instead of cheaper hydro power plants. In Tajikistan, the power \n\n                                                \n1 In parallel operation, all generators of interconnected power systems have the same phase sequence.  \n2 Turkmenistan\u2019s power system had been part of CAPS during the Soviet time. It has been operating independently \nand in parallel with Iran\u2019s power system since May 2003.  \n3 Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2012. Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation: Power Sector Regional Master \nPlan, Manila (TA 7335-REG).   \n4 Power exports to Afghanistan are excluded.  \n5 Tajikistan\u2019s installed capacity was 5,713 megawatt (MW) in 2017, of which 87% was based on hydropower \n6 Since November 2009, CAPS consists of the parallel operation of the Kazakh, Kyrgyz and Uzbek power systems. \n \n\n\f2 \n\ngrid  was  not  designed  to  operate  independently,  and  urgent  investments  in  the  transmission \nsystem were needed to supply electricity to regions that previously received electricity from CAPS. \nMoreover, Tajikistan\u2019s hydropower plants spilled surplus water every summer\u23afwhich could have \ngenerated  between  3\u20135 TWh of  electricity  each year\u23afbecause of limited export  opportunities. \nOn the other hand, the lack of electricity import sources required severe rationing of power supply \nduring winter.7 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimated that efficient regional power trade \nwould have translated into annual cost savings on fuel as well as operation and maintenance of \nabout $670 million.8 \n\n \n7. \nFollowing the change of the government in Uzbekistan in 2017, the state power utilities of \nTajikistan\u23afOpen  Joint  Stock  Holding  Company  Barqi  Tojik\u23afand  Uzbekistan\u23afJoint  Stock \nHolding Company Uzbekenergo\u23afsigned a power trade agreement on 9 March 2018 for Tajikistan \nto export up to 1.5 TWh of summer surplus electricity to Uzbekistan. Barqi Tojik started exporting \nelectricity  to  Uzbekenergo  on  2  April  2018.  To  facilitate  the  immediate  power  export  from \nTajikistan, a part of Uzbekistan was isolated from its national grid and connected to the Tajikistan \npower  system,  using  existing  regional  infrastructure.  However,  this  arrangement  restricts  the \nvolume of electricity export from Tajikistan and the year-round availability of supply.9 Full parallel \noperation of the two power systems is required to remove this constraint, raise the power export \nvolume to 5 TWh per year and effect a more efficient and optimized power exchange.   \n \nTajikistan\u2019s  obsolete  protection  and interconnection  system,  however,  is  preventing the \n8. \nachievement of full parallel operation. The project will resolve this by (i) installing and upgrading \nthe  relay  protection  system  for  synchronizing  the  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan  systems,  (ii) \nincreasing  interconnection  points  between  the  two  systems,  and  (iii)  strengthening  Tajikistan\u2019s \ncapacity for stable parallel operation.  \n \n9. \nSector\u2019s financial issues. The project investment will remove the technical constraints \nfor interconnection, but the fundamental issue of Tajikistan\u2019s electricity subsector is insufficient \ncash inflow largely as a result of system inefficiency, inadequate corporate structure and low tariffs.  \nBarqi Tojik\u2019s excessive debt service obligations and foreign exchange losses on grants and loans \nfrom  ADB  and  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  financing  institutions  exacerbates  the  problem.10 \nThese have eroded the company\u2019s equity to the point of insolvency, and external auditors have \nnoted  material  uncertainty  about  Barqi  Tojik\u2019s  ability  to  continue  operating  as  a  going-concern \nsince  2016.  Consequently,  Barqi  Tojik  has  not  been  compliant  with  some  of  the  financial \ncovenants of previous ADB grants despite its successful track-record of project implementation.11 \nBarqi Tojik\u2019s financial recovery is an urgent issue for the sector\u2019s sustainability. \n\n \n\n10.  While  recovery  efforts  have  been  covenanted  in  previous  ADB  projects,  the  lack  of \nmeasures to generate significant additional revenues stymied more radical improvements. The \n\n                                                \n7 Load shedding was discontinued in the winter of 2017-2018 after full commissioning of a new 400-megawatt combined \nheat and power plant in Dushanbe.  \n8 The World Bank estimated a higher cost saving potential of $1 billion a year (World Bank. 2016. Enhancing Regional \nTrade in Central Asia. Washington D.C.).  \n9 This arrangement of isolated operation and interconnection of part of the Uzbekistan grid to Tajikistan can only work \nduring summer but not in winter (October\u2013March) because Tajikistan does not have adequate surplus electricity during \nwinter to service this isolated region of Uzbekistan. \n10 Concessional loans and grants from ADB were on-lent to Barqi Tojik for 25 years with 5% interest rate and foreign \nexchange risk fully covered by Barqi Tojik. Loans and grants from other institutions are also on-lent on similar terms. \n11 The financial covenants include a debt service coverage ratio of 1.2, self-financing ratio of 20% and operating ratio \n\nof 90%.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fcurrent biggest issue is Barqi Tojik\u2019s commercial liabilities, which continue to grow for the lack of \nits capacity to fully service them. The project will enable summer export and increase Barqi Tojik\u2019s \nincome  by  about  30%  compared  to  the  2016  level.  To  address  the  debt  issue,  Barqi  Tojik  is \nrequired by the project\u2019s legal agreement to use these funds to repay the commercial liabilities \nfirst until they are at a manageable level. Additionally, the government has agreed to continue to \nraise electricity tariffs by at least 15% per year until 2021.12  Moreover, the government will provide \nthis grant as equity to Barqi Tojik and intends to convert all previous ADB grants into equity of \nBarqi Tojik.13 The on-lending arrangement of grants was acceptable in previous projects because \nBarqi Tojik is a revenue generating entity, but the current financial challenges call for these forms \nof government support. The successful implementation of all these actions can potentially bring \nback net profits to Barqi Tojik from 2021.  \n\n \nThese financial recovery measures will also pave the way for successful sector reforms, \n11. \nwhich ADB is preparing to support as a sector development program for ADB Board consideration \nin  2019.    ADB  has  supported  Tajikistan\u2019s  electricity  subsector  reforms  extensively  since  2011 \nthrough the Sector Operations Performance Improvement (SOPI) program.14 The SOPI program \nprovides comprehensive reform initiatives, including separation of the generation, transmission \nand  distribution  businesses,  debt  restructuring,  introduction  of  a  new  cost  recovery  tariff \nmethodology, studies for investments in metering and billing infrastructure, design of a fund-flow \nmechanism with a settlement system, and development of multi-year management contracts in \ntransmission and distribution companies. As a key milestone, the government issued a decree to \nlegally separate Barqi Tojik into three companies in April 2018. A special government committee \nis finalizing  the  legal  documents for this  process.  After  unbundling, the  new  tariff methodology \nand fund flow mechanism will help manage the financial flow between sector entities. Given the \nanticipated major restructuring of Barqi Tojik, all financial recovery indicators will be included in \nthe design and monitoring framework of the sector development program.  \n\n \n12. \nFor  sector  reform  initiatives,  experience  from  previous  projects  show  that  coordinated \napproach  among  development  partners  is  key  to  successful  implementation.  ADB  is  closely \ncoordinating with partners such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank in developing the financial recovery measures \nof this project and the reform initiatives of the sector development program. \n\n \n13. \nFinally,  the  parallel  operation to be  achieved  by  the  project  will  also  allow  Tajikistan  to \nexport  electricity  to other  CAPS  countries in the future and to import  electricity  if  needed. The \ncommercial arrangements between Barqi Tojik and Uzbekenergo is only for exporting electricity \nfrom  Tajikistan  as  of  2018,  but  the  project  will  provide  the  basis  for  expanding  trade  between \nCAPS countries and improving regional resource efficiency further. \n\n \n\n14.  With these impacts, the project aligns with the focus areas of ADB intervention\u2014sector\u2019s \nlost export revenues\u2014in its Country Partnership Strategy 2016\u20132020 for Tajikistan.15 It also aligns \n\n                                                \n12 Electricity tariffs were increased by about 15% in both 2017 and 2018.  \n13 The total amount of outstanding principal of on-lent ADB grants to Barqi Tojik is about $240 million, which is about \n\n18% of all outstanding on-lent loans and grants from bilateral or multilateral financing institutions.  \n\n14 SOPI program consultants have been providing comprehensive support to Barqi Tojik\u2019s restructuring process since \n2011.

The project will \ninstall  modern  relays,  circuit  breakers,  instrumental  transformers  and  ancillary  equipment  and \nsystems  for  reliable  synchronous  operation  at  220  kV  and  500  kV  interconnection  points  with \nCAPS.  Replacing  and  upgrading  the  equipment  will  provide  capacity  to  respond  to  technical \nincidents that may cause system failure and to improve the reliability of the system.  \n\nOutputs \n\n \n17. \nOutput 2: Interconnection between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan expanded.  Two new \n500kV interconnection points at the Sugd substation in Northern Tajikistan will be established. \nThis entails the construction of about 1.5 kilometers of a 500 kV transmission line that will connect \nto the existing 500 kV transmission line between Syrdarya and Lochin substations in Uzbekistan.19 \nThis will increase the stability of the parallel operation of the two systems. \n\n \n18. \nOutput  3:  Capacity  in  Tajikistan  for  stable  parallel  operation  improved.  The \nengineering, procurement and construction contractor for the project will conduct capacity building \nof Barqi Tojik staff for using the new protection equipment and for overall grid operations. This \nwill give Barqi Tojik the knowledge tools to ensure stable grid operation. \n\n \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  ADB  has  been  one  of  the  leading  partners  of  the \n19. \nGovernment of Tajikistan in energy sector development and providing comprehensive support for \nsector reform and infrastructure investment in electricity generation and transmission. This has \nallowed  ADB  to respond  quickly  to the  government\u2019s  urgent  request for funding  to conduct  an \ninitial  assessment  of the  relay  protection  system. The result  of the  assessment  combined with \nADB\u2019s close engagement enabled the government and ADB to prepare this project within a year.  \n \nD. \n \n20. \ncategory and by financier are included in the project administration manual. 20 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $40  million.

Because  the \nUzbekistan electricity system has a much higher CO2 emission factor than Tajikistan\u2019s, the project \nis expected to reduce CO2 emissions in Uzbekistan by about 1.8 million CO2 tons for the volume \nof exported electricity from Tajikistan.21  \n \nE. \n \n23. \nthe PAM (footnote 20). \n \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated grant closing date \nManagement \n\nArrangements \nJanuary 2019\u2013August 2021 \n31 August 2021 \n28 February 2022 \n\n                                                \n21 Refer to Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nAspects  \n(i)  \n(ii)  \n(iii)  \n\nOversight body \nExecuting agency \nImplementation unit \n\nProcurement:  plant  design,  supply, \nand  install  contract  for  rehabilitation \nworks \n\nproject \n\nservices: \n\nConsulting \nimplementation consultants \nRetroactive financing and/or advance \ncontracting \nDisbursement \n\nArrangements \nMinistry of Energy and Water Resources \nOpen Joint Stock Holding Company Barqi Tojik \nProject management unit for electro-energy sector under the President of \nthe Republic of Tajikistan \nOCB with international \nadvertisement \n \nDirect contracting \nQCBS (90:10) \n\n1 contract \n \n \n1 contract \n130 person-months \n\n$14.5 million \n \n \n$14.0 million \n$3.0 million \n\nAdvance contracting and retroactive financing will not be used. \n\nThe  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, OCB = open competitive bidding, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \nThe executing agency will be the 100% state-owned power utility Barqi Tojik.22 The project \n24. \nwill be managed by a PMU that coordinates and implements power projects funded through loans \nand grants by bilateral donors and international financing institutions. The PMU has satisfactorily \nimplemented six previous ADB projects. Lessons from previous and ongoing projects show that \nthe continuation of the centralized PMU is the most effective structure of project implementation. \nOnce Barqi Tojik is unbundled through the reform process, the new transmission company will be \nthe executing agency of this project.  \n \n25. \nThe  project  requires  installation  of  an  emergency  control  system  (ECS),  which  will  be \nconnected to the  new  and existing  relay  protection  and  existing  Supervisory  Control  and Data \nAcquisition system for automated response to system incidents. This is a key component of the \nprotection functions in cases such as a major failure within CAPS needs to be contained to avoid \nspreading of the incident. Uzbekistan is equipped with a specific  ECS, and full compatibility of \nECSs at both ends of the transmission lines interconnecting two power grids is the highest priority \nfor regional grid stability. Since disconnection of Tajikistan from CAPS in October 2009, the ECS \nin  Uzbekistan  was  gradually  upgraded.  Therefore,  the  installation  of  the  same  ECS  that  is \nestimated to be $14 million is a technical requirement to interconnect Tajikistan with CAPS. \n \n26. \nTojik,  Uzbekenergo, \nSrednazenergosetproject  (Uzbek  design  institute  responsible  for  designing  CAPS),  and \nCoordinating  Dispatch  Center-Energy,  it  was  concluded  that  there  are  two  suppliers  of  this \nspecific  system  worldwide  for  its  proprietary  nature,  and  only  one  company,  DS  Group  in \nKazakhstan, meets ADB\u2019s eligibility criteria. Given this background, item (b) on standardization of \nequipment and (c) on proprietary item in clause 2.17 on direct contracting of ADB\u2019s Procurement \nRegulations is applicable to this component.  \n \n\namong  Barqi \n\nassessment \n\ndiscussions \n\nAfter \n\nand \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n27. \nIn-depth technical  due  diligence  for  the  project  was  conducted  to  develop  and  analyze \nvarious options for technical reinforcement and expansion of automated emergency control and \nmonitoring  systems,  relay  protection  and  automation,  telemetry  data  and  telecommunication \n                                                \n22 Integrity due diligence conducted on Barqi Tojik found no major issues.  \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nnetworks  in  Barqi  Tojik\u2019s  electric  power  system  to  ensure  the  required  level  of  power  system \nreliability and sustainability in the context of the system development until 2030. The technical \ndue diligence also assessed the condition of the transmission equipment in substations that are \ninterconnected  with  CAPS.  Various  cost  estimation  methods  were  used  to  obtain  up-to-date \nquotations  for  equipment.  The  project  implementation  schedule  was  prepared  considering  the \ndemand profile to minimize the impact from disconnections. \n \n28. \nADB is satisfied with the quality of the cost estimates, cost structures, appropriateness of \nthe technology, and the execution plan. Barqi Tojik\u2019s operation and maintenance staff is familiar \nwith  the  proposed  design  concepts.  The  proposed  protection  systems  are  not  different  from \nexisting  practices,  but  they  are  more  advanced  and  use  modern  technology.  The  systems  will \nrequire training to be included in the terms of reference for consultants and contractors. This is \nroutine practice for a utility when first implementing similar systems.  \n \nB. \n \nThe project requires a relatively modest investment for interconnecting two systems, yet \n29. \nthe expected returns for Tajikistan from exports to Uzbekistan can be extremely high. The sales \nprice from Tajikistan to Uzbekistan is $0.02 per kWh. Since this electricity will be generated from \nunused  existing  facilities  and  resources  in  Tajikistan  during  summer,  the  generation  cost  is \nmarginal. The export volume will increase by 3.5 TWh per year once parallel operation is enabled. \nThis amounts to about $70 million in additional revenues for Tajikistan each year, compared with \nthe estimated total project investment cost of $40 million. Against this background, the financial \ninternal rate of return of the project is 14.8%, well above the estimated weighted average cost of \ncapital of 6.2% for Barqi Tojik for the project.   \n \n30. \nThe economic analysis of the project was conducted from the perspective of Tajikistan\u2019s \neconomy and largely mirrors the assumptions of the financial analysis. Benefits accrue from the \nadditional export revenue to Tajikistan, resulting in an estimated economic internal rate of return \nof 24.1% against the economic cost of capital of 9.0%.23 These analyses show that the project is \nfinancially and economically viable.  \n \nOne of the main risks of the project is the discontinuation of the electricity trade between \n31. \nthe  two  countries.  The  analysis,  therefore,  spans  only  across  3  years  of  trade  after  project \ncompletion even though the asset life of the project investment is estimated to be 30 years.  \n \nDespite the potentially high returns from the investment, private sector participation cannot \n32. \nbe  reasonably  structured,  given  the  lack  of  an  enabling  regulatory  framework  in  Tajikistan. \nFurther,  the  electricity  trade  agreement  is  a  product  of  the  two  government\u2019s  extensive \nnegotiations. Therefore, public sector investment is the only option available for the project. \n \nC. \n \n33. \nAnticorruption measures. ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained and discussed with the Government and Barqi Tojik. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly \nor through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to \nthe  project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  are \nincluded in the grant regulations and the bidding documents. In particular, all contracts financed \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n23 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fby ADB in connection with the project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records  and  accounts  of  EAs and all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  project.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 20). \n \n34. \nFinancial  management.  Barqi  Tojik\u2019s  overall  financial  management  risk  is  substantial. \nThe  results  of  external  independent  auditing  have  improved  over  the  years;  auditors  issued  a \ndisclaimer  of  opinions  until  FY2013,  but  audit  results  have  received  qualified  opinions  since \nFY2014. However, audits for FY 2015 and FY2016 based on International Standards on Auditing \nindicate issues on valuation of inventory, revaluation of assets, records on account receivables \nand payables, and data conciliation of revenues. To address these remaining issues, Barqi Tojik \nconducted  valuation  of  assets  in  2014  and  reflected  in  the  subsequent  financial  statements. \nAssessment of receivables and payables were also completed in 2014. The financial statements \nare now reported based on the International Financial Reporting System, as required by state\u2019s \ndecrees.  Automated  accounting  system  based  on  1C  has  been  introduced  to  Barqi  Tojik.  The \nutility\u2019s 30 subordinate entities all prepare their own financial reports which are consolidated at \nthe holding company level. Barqi Tojik has established an internal audit unit at the head office, \nbut the unit\u2019s independence is limited. These key issues have been discussed between ADB and \nBarqi  Tojik  and  an  action  plan  was  agreed  with  Barqi  Tojik.  The  project\u2019s  implementation \nconsultants and the on-going SOPI project will support the implementation of the action plan. \n  \n35. \nProcurement. The procurement capacity of Barqi Tojik and the PMU was assessed, and \nit does not pose a significant risk to project implementation. Barqi Tojik works with the government \nPMU dedicated to energy sector projects, which has performed well in the implementation of on-\ngoing ADB-funded projects (para 24). The indicative procurement method for the design, supply \nand  installation  contract  for  relay  protection  will  be  open  competitive  bidding  with  international \nadvertisement. The emergency control system package will be directly contracted to a Kazakh \ncompany that provides the required system for CAPS (para 26). The implementation consulting \nfirm will be recruited using the quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) method. Procurement \n(including consulting services) will follow ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time \nto time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). \nFor  consultant\u2019s  recruitment,  quality  cost  weighting  of  90:10  will  be  used  to  ensure  quality \nimplementation of complex systems.  \n \nD. \n \nThe project\u2019s aim to improve the use of regional energy resource among CAPS countries \n36. \nwill  indirectly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  through  improved  access  to  energy,  resulting  in \nreduced  time  poverty,  improved  health  outcomes  with  the  use  of  safer  energy  sources,  and \nincreased access to income earning opportunities. Rural electricity services help non-agricultural \nenterprises  such  as  food  processing,  handicrafts  and  food  production,  and  stimulate  more \nopportunities  for  generating  cash  and  contributing  to  the  rural  economy.  Women  are \ndisproportionately  affected  by  limited  and  unreliable  access  to  electricity  because  of  their \nhousehold roles and more limited access to resources. Traditional gender roles for women such \nas cooking, washing/ironing, keeping the home warm, heating water to bathe children, or even \nhelping  children  with  their  schoolwork  at  night,  become  arduous  when  energy  resources  for \ncooking, lighting, and use of appliances are insufficient or unreliable.  The high cost of gas for \ncooking and coal for heating cause poorer households to resort to traditional fuels. Insufficient \nenergy supply also negatively impacts businesses, especially small- and home-based enterprises \nthat  women  are  typically  involved  in.  The  project\u2019s  poverty  reduction  impact  will  also  indirectly \nbenefit women by improving these conditions. ADB will actively explore opportunities to scale up \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fgender  benefits  in  the  forthcoming  sector  development  program  and  future  energy-sector \nprojects.  \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment \n\n(category  B).

Impacts were assessed during the impact assessment study and adequate mitigation \nmeasures and monitoring requirements are proposed as part of the IEE and EMP. These will be \nimplemented  through  the  EMP  and  Site-specific  Environmental  Management  Plans  (SEMP), \nwhich will be prepared by the contractor and approved by the PMU. The EMP will also require \ntraining of PMU personnel in environmental management to strengthen the safeguard capacity. \n \n40. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). Output 2 of the project involves two new 500 kV \ninterconnection points at the Sugd substation, i.e. constructing a transmission line of about 1.5 \nkm and approximately 8 towers. It is expected that the construction of the transmission lines and \ntowers  will  require  about  7  land  plots  with  900  square  meters  which  have  been  used  by  7 \nhouseholds. A land acquisition and resettlement plan was prepared to provide compensation for \nall  the  losses  caused  by  the  project.  Public  consultations  were  conducted  in  August  and \nSeptember  2018.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  is  in  place  in  accordance  with  the  land \nacquisition and resettlement plan to assist affected persons to resolve grievances and complaints. \nBarqi  Tojik  will  submit  semiannual  safeguards  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  for  review  and \ndisclosure.  No involuntary resettlement impacts are expected under output 1 and 3.
