An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  has  been \nundertaken,  and  a  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE) \nis in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \nThe proposed Rural Road Sector Project (the Project) will (i) enhance \nthe  economic  integration  of  selected  rural  communities,  which  make \nup  about  10%  of  the  total  rural  population,  through  improvement  of \nhigh  priority  rural  feeder  roads  totaling  about  220  kilometers  (km) \nconnected  to  the  national  road  network;  and  (ii)  strengthen  the \ntransport sector management capability.  \n \nTo  maximize  the  benefits  and  reach  out  to  the  majority  of  the  rural \npopulation  in  the  country,  the  Project  has  been  designed  by  actively \nmaintaining  operational    partnerships  with  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational  Cooperation  (JBIC),  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency \n(MCC), \n(JICA),  US  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation \nArmenian  Social \ninternational  Road \nAssessment Programme (iRAP), Joint United Nations Programme on \nHIV/AIDS \n(UNAIDS),  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social \nCommission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific  (UNESCAP),  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme  (UNDP),  and  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development (USAID).  \n \nFacing ongoing globalization, Armenia has progressively made efforts \nto  strengthen  the  interlinkage  between  its  economy  and  other \neconomies. The  transport  sector,  particularly  the  road  subsector,  has \nplayed  an  increasingly  important  role  in  this  process.  As  the \npredominant  transport  mode,  road  transport  is  important  for  the \nnational economy and population and serves 98% of passenger traffic \nand 66% of freight traffic. \n \nThe  majority  of  the  road  network  traverses  mountainous  terrain,  and \naltitudes  frequently  exceed  1,500  meters  (m)  above  sea  level.  Steep \ngradients,  deep  cuttings,  and  high  embankments  are  common  in \nmountainous  areas,  and  landslides  occur  frequently.  Severe  winter \nweather requires extensive efforts to maintain access. In many areas \nof  the  road  network,  high  intensity  rainfall  and  poor  road  drainage \ncause  traffic  problems  and  road  infrastructure  damage.  The  extreme \nclimate  also  causes  a  negative  impact  on  the  behavior  of  road \npavements, particularly because of freezing and thawing in the spring. \nIn Armenia, 1.2 million people (about 38% of the total population) live \n\nInvestment  Fund \n\n(ASIF), \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nthe \n\nlimiting \n\nrural  population,  and \n\nin  rural  areas,  of  which  more  than  45%  is  poor.  Poverty  has  been \nreduced  from  50.0%  in  2000  to  29.8%  in  2005  but  poverty  reduction \nhas been slower in rural areas. This is mainly because of constrained \neconomic activities\u2014primarily attributable to mountainous topography \nand  poor  transport  infrastructure\u2014imposing  high  direct  and  indirect \ntransport  costs  on \nincome \nopportunities  and  expansion  of  rural  industries.  High  transport  costs \nand  constrained  road  access  have  also  negatively  affected  non-\nincome aspects of poverty in rural areas because of limited access to \nsocial service delivery institutions. \n \nTo respond to challenges created by road infrastructure deficiency, the \nGovernment\u2019s  main  road  subsector  policy  until  2015  focuses  on  the \nrehabilitation  and  maintenance  of  existing  roads  in  line  with  the \nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The Government adopted \nthree  strategic  goals  for  its  road  infrastructure  development  for  the \nperiod 2006\u20132015: (i) maintenance and improvement of the main road \nnetwork  to  enhance  the  country\u2019s  business  competitiveness  and \nsupport the economy, (ii) improvement of the socioeconomic condition \nof the rural population through rehabilitation of rural roads in support of \nthe  PRSP,  and  (iii)  improvement  of  traffic  safety.  The  Government \nplans  to  (i) complete  the  rehabilitation  of  old  bridges  and  other \nancillary facilities along the main highways by  2010, (ii) complete the \nrehabilitation of secondary roads and bridges by 2015, (iii) meet rural \nroad  transport  demands  in  a  cost-effective  manner,  and  (iv)  ensure \nroad safety throughout all road categories.  \n \nTo  address  inefficient  infrastructure  as  one  of  the  main  causes  of \npoverty,  the  Government  has  set  rural  infrastructure  development  as \nthe  cornerstone  of  the  PRSP  and  has  prepared  rural  infrastructure \ninvestment  programs  to  reduce  rural  poverty.  In  the  road  sector,  the \nGovernment  developed  a  Lifeline  Road  Network  Program  (LRNP)  in \n2004,  with  assistance  from  the  World  Bank.  The  LRNP  will  improve \nthe access of rural communities to the national highway system in an \noptimal  manner  throughout  the  country.  It  targets  784  high  priority \nrural  feeder  roads  (secondary  and  local  roads)  totaling  about  2,700 \nkm.  \n \nUnder  the  small-scale  technical  assistance  for  preparing  the  Project, \nthe  overall  cost  of  the  LRNP  has  been  preliminarily  updated  to  an \nestimated $300 million. MCC has committed to provide $67 million for \nthe  rehabilitation  of  rural  roads  (totaling  about  940  km),  while  the \nGovernment  is  expected  to  budget  nearly  $50  million  equivalent  for \nthe  improvement  of  rural  roads  (totaling  532  km).  The  Government \nhas  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  $30.6 \nmillion  to  upgrade  rural  roads  (totaling  about  220  km).  These \ninterventions  will  complete  the  improvement  of  about  60%  of  the \nLRNP  by  2011. \nto  ADB\u2019s  resource  mobilization \nconsultations, JBIC is preparing a loan of about $50 million equivalent \nin  parallel  with  the  Project  by  using  the  sector  lending  approach \ndeveloped  by  ADB  for  the  Project.  With  JBIC  financing,  more  than \n\nIn  response \n\n\f \n\niii\n\n75% of the LRNP roads would be improved by 2011. \n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  will  have  an  additional,  positive,  long-term  impact  on  the \nfour  project  regions  and  the  income  and  non-income  dimensions  of \npoverty  in  rural  areas\u2014serving  about  10%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  rural \npopulation.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  mobility  and  improved \naccessibility  to  basic  social  service  delivery  institutions,  employment \nopportunities, and domestic and international markets for communities \nand  enterprises  in  rural  and  urban  areas  of  the  four  regions.  The \nfeeder  roads  improved  under  the  Project  will  lead  to  (i)  higher  and \nmore  frequent  quality  transport  services  available  for  road  users;  (ii) \nincreased  business  opportunities \nin  general, \nparticularly  agriculture  (including  agro-processing),  industrial,  and \nservice  sectors;  and  (iii)  more  synergetic  benefits \nfrom  close \npartnerships  in  the  road  and  other  sectors  relevant  to  the  Project. \nFurthermore,  the  Project  will  improve  transport  sector  management \nthrough the TA that will be attached to the Project. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $41.4  million,  including \ntaxes and duties of $5.8 million equivalent.  \n\n \nProject \nPlan \n\nfor  private  sector \n\nInvestment \n\nItem \n\nA.

The loan will have a \nterm  of  32  years  with  a  grace  period  of  8  years.  There  will  be  an \ninterest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter. \n \nUntil 30 June 2011 \n \n31 December 2010 \n\n \nThe  Executing  Agency  will  be \nthe  Ministry  of  Transport  and \nCommunications (MOTC). Responsibility for planning, implementation, \nand  supervision  of  the  Project  will  be  delegated  to  the  Armenian \n(ARD) \nRoads  Directorate  Non-Commercial  State  Organization \nresponsible  for  planning  and  management  of  road  construction  and \nmaintenance work for the road assets under MOTC\u2019s purview. \n \nARD  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  recruiting  consultants  for  subproject \npreparation  and  construction  supervision,  and  auditing,  (ii)  preparing \nbidding  documents,  (iii)  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  (iv)  awarding \nof  civil  works  contracts.  Within  ARD,  a  project  management  unit \nto  manage  day-to-day  coordination, \n(PMU)will  be  established \nimplementation, and administration of the Project.  \n \nProcurement  under  the Project  will be  carried  out  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nCivil  works  contracts  will  be  carried  out  by  using  international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  and \nthe  post-qualification \nmethod,  as  described  in  the  procurement  plan  for  the  Project \n(Appendix  9).  The  procurement  plan  will  be  reviewed  regularly  and \namended  at \nthe  next  18  months  of \nprocurement  activity  during  project  implementation.  The  minimum \namount of a civil works contract procured through ICB is initially set at \nmore  than  $1  million  and  will  be  reviewed  during  implementation. \nProcurement  through  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  will  be \nconducted under the Borrower\u2019s legislation on procurement, subject to \nmodification  and  clarifications  set  forth  in  the  Loan  Agreement.  The \nNCB  thresholds  are  presently  set  at  less  than  or  equivalent  to  $1 \nmillion  for  civil  works  and  less  than  or  equivalent  to  $500,000  for \ngoods. International shopping will be carried out for goods less than or \nequivalent to $100,000.  \n \nADB  has  approved  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  for \nthe  consulting  services \nfor  subproject  preparation  and  project \nsupervision, monitoring, and evaluation. Up to 20% of the loan amount \nmay  be  used  to  finance  eligible  expenditures  retroactively  for \nconsulting services that have been engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \n\nleast  annually  covering \n\n\f \n\nv\n\ntime),  and  incurred  prior  to  loan  effectiveness  but  not  earlier  than  12 \nmonths prior to loan signing. \n \n\n \n\nAbout 30 person-months of international consultants and 162 person-\nmonths of national consultants will be required to work with the PMU \nfor  subproject  preparation  (including  detailed  design;  and  technical, \nenvironmental, economic, and social/resettlement due diligence); and \nproject  supervision,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  (including  technical, \nsocial/resettlement  monitoring,  and \nenvironmental,  economic, \nevaluation). ARD will engage one consulting firm for the services. The \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  through  the  quality  and  cost-based \nselection  method,  using  the  full  technical  proposal  procedures  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The \nGovernment  requested  ADB  to  carry  out  the  selection  of  the \nconsultants,  as  it  is  not familiar  with  ADB  procedures.  Once  selected \nby  ADB,  the  Government  will  negotiate  with  the  selected  consultants \nto  finalize  the  consulting  contracts  and  will  retain  the  responsibility  to \nsupervise the consultants. \n \nThe  immediate  main  benefits  of  the  Project  include  (i)  long-term \nsustainable  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  and  travel  time \nstemming from the physical improvements, and (ii) the development of \nimproved  transport  and  road  management  systems.  The  overall \nproject economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 43.2%. \n \nThe Project will also improve the income and non-income dimensions \nof  poverty  in  rural  areas.  About  32%  of  road  users  within  the  project \nareas  are  poor  and  6%  are  classified  very  poor.  Project  benefits  will \naccrue to about 40,500 poor beneficiaries, of whom roughly 7,000 are \nvery poor. Total net benefits accruing to the poor in the project areas \nare estimated at about $24 million, of which the very poor will receive \naround $4 million. In addition, improved road infrastructure will provide \nrural  communities  with  enhanced  access  to  social  service  delivery \ninstitutions  including  hospitals,  clinics,  and  schools.  This  will  support \nthe improvement of non-income aspects of poverty.  \n \nThe  major  risks  arise  from  possible  project  preparation  delays, \nimplementation  delays,  and  low  quality  of  works.  To  minimize  these \nrisks,  the  Government  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  a  feasible  schedule \nthat  will  be  reviewed  regularly,  and  systematic  procedures  for \nsubproject  submissions  to  ADB  and  project  implementation  that  are \ndetailed in the project administration memorandum (PAM). Consultant \nsupport  will  (i) ensure  high  quality  due  diligence  for  subproject \nselection and preparation, and (ii) help ARD anticipate major factors in \nthe  critical  paths  of  project  implementation.  Furthermore,  advance \ncontracting of the consultancy services for subproject preparation and \nconstruction supervision has further minimized risks of implementation \ndelays. To ensure high quality of works under the Project, consultant \nsupport  has  been  designed \nfor  project \nto \nincluding  qualified \nsupervision,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  by \n\ninclude  provisions \n\nAdvance Contracting \nand Retroactive \nFinancing Consulting \nServices \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n \n\ninternational  and  national  road  engineers  and  pavement  specialists, \nroad  safety  experts, \ntransport  economists,  social/resettlement \nspecialists, and environment specialists.

The  Government  has  accelerated \nstrengthening  of  the  business  environment  to  promote  investment  and  exports.  The  Armenian \nTrade  and  Transport  Facilitation  Committee  was  established  in  2002  and  has  played  an  active \nrole  in  (i)  facilitating  coordination  between  the  Government,  industry,  private  sector,  and  civil \nsociety;  (ii)  eliminating  barriers  to  international  and  regional  trade;  (iii)  bringing  Armenian  trade \nand transport procedures in line with international standards; and (iv) promoting harmonization of \ntrade  and  transport  procedures  in  the  South  Caucasus.  The  committee  has  been  working  with \nsimilar  committees  in  neighboring  countries.  Internally,  issues  related  to  customs  procedures \nwere  streamlined  and  other  reforms  have  been  implemented  to  develop  private  sector  freight \ntransporters.  Armenia  has  signed  all  major  international  trade  and  transport  protocols  and \nconventions. \n \n3. \nThe  transport  sector,  particularly  the  road  subsector,  has  played  an  increasingly \nimportant role in this process. Road transport is the predominant transportation mode, supporting \nthe  national  economy  and  population  by  serving  98%  of  passenger  traffic  and  66%  of  freight \ntraffic. Growing demands for road transport have been supported by the Armenian road network \ninfrastructure  totaling  about  7,500  kilometers  (km), 2  comprising  (i)  main  highways  including \ninternational  road  transport  corridors 3  (roughly  1,560  km);  (ii)  secondary  roads  connecting \ncommunities  to  the  main  highways  (nearly  1,830  km);  and  (iii)  local  roads  serving  rural \ncommunities  (around  4,100  km).  The  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC)  is \nresponsible  for  the  main  highways  and  secondary  roads.  Responsibility  for  planning  and \nmanagement  of  road  construction  and  maintenance  work  for  the  road  assets  under  MOTC\u2019s \npurview  is  delegated  to  the  Armenian  Roads  Directorate  Non-Commercial  State  Organization \n(ARD).  Regional  governments  are  responsible  for  local  roads.  An  estimated  90%  of  main \nhighways and secondary roads are in fair or good condition, while more than 60% of rural roads \nare in very  poor or poor condition. About 84% of the rural road network is not passable during \nwinter. \n \n4. \nThe  majority  of  the  road  network  traverses  mountainous  terrain  and  altitudes  frequently \nexceed  1,500  meters  (m)  above  sea  level.  Steep  gradients,  deep  cuttings,  and  high \nembankments are common in mountainous areas, and landslides occur frequently. The severe \nwinter weather requires extensive efforts to maintain access. In many areas of the road network, \nhigh  intensity  rainfall  and  poor  road  drainage  cause  traffic  problems  and  road  infrastructure \ndamage. The extreme climate also causes a negative impact on the behavior of road pavements, \nparticularly because of freezing and thawing in the spring. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Consisting of paved roads (78%), gravel roads (19%), and earth roads (3%). \n3  Armenia  has  three  Asian  highway  routes  adding  up  to  958  km.  The  major  part  of  the  northern  sections  of  the \ninternational road transport corridors have been improved with financial assistance from the World Bank and Lincy \nFoundation,  while  the  southern  part  of  the  road  transport  corridor  has  been  partially  improved  under  World  Bank \nassistance.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n5. \nIn  Armenia,  1.2  million  people  (about  38%  of  the  total  population)  live  in  rural  areas,  of \nwhich more than 45% are poor. Poverty has been reduced from 50.0% in 2000 to 29.8% in 2005 \nbut  poverty  reduction  has  been  slower  in  rural  areas.  This  is  mainly  because  of  constrained \neconomic  activities\u2014primarily  attributable  to  mountainous  topography  and  poor  transport \ninfrastructure\u2014imposing high direct and indirect transport costs on rural population, and limiting \nincome opportunities and the expansion of rural industries. High transport costs and constrained \nroad access have also negatively affected non-income aspects of poverty in rural areas because \nof limited access to social service delivery institutions. \n \nTo  respond  to  the  challenges  created  by  the  road  infrastructure  deficiency,  the \n6. \nGovernment\u2019s  main  road  subsector  policy  until  2015  mainly  focuses  on  the  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance of the existing roads in line with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The \nGovernment adopted three strategic goals for its road infrastructure development for the period \n2006\u20132015: (i) maintenance and improvement of the main road network to enhance the country\u2019s \nbusiness  competitiveness  and  support  the  economy,  (ii)  improvement  of  the  socioeconomic \ncondition of the rural population through rehabilitation of rural roads in support of the PRSP, and \n(iii) improvement of traffic safety. The Government plans to (i) complete the rehabilitation of old \nbridges  and  other  ancillary  facilities  along  the  main  highways  by  2010,  (ii)  complete  the \nrehabilitation of secondary roads and bridges by 2015, (iii) meet rural road transport demands in \na cost-effective manner, and (iv) ensure road safety throughout all road categories.  \n \nThe  Government  has  been  firmly  committed  to  improving  its  road  safety  in  conjunction \n7. \nwith  its  road  infrastructure  improvement  programs  in  response  to  rapid  motorization. 4  It \nestablished the National Road Safety Council in 2001 and has developed a road safety program \nthat  identifies  accident  black  spots.  However,  the  situation  is  serious  and  deteriorating.  Road \naccidents have increased from 1,021 in 2001 to 1,312 in 2005. In 2005, fatalities (310 persons) \nwere 20% higher than in 2004. The death rate per 10,000 vehicles is eight times as high as in \nthe safest European countries. Of particular concern is the large number of pedestrian fatalities.  \n \nRapid motorization has also caused air pollution through vehicular emissions. Throughout \n8. \nthe country, many trucks, buses, utility vehicles, and passenger cars use liquefied natural gas as \nfuel, emitting cleaner exhaust gas than that of vehicles using gasoline or diesel. Many liquefied \nnatural gas stations serve these vehicles. However, the numbers of gasoline or diesel vehicles \nare  increasing  and  many  old  vehicles  using  such  fuels  still  exist.  Because  of  the  mountainous \ntopography, many cities and towns are located at the bottom of basins where vehicular emission \ndoes not diffuse easily. Although air pollution caused by vehicular emissions has not yet become \na  serious  health  hazard  in  the  country,  an  increasing  need  for  proactive  actions  is  considered \nnecessary, especially in the major cities. An analysis of the road subsector is in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1.  \n\nConstraints \n\n \n9. \nDespite the Government\u2019s effort to improve and restore the road network in line with its \n10-year  road  subsector  strategy  for  2006\u20132015,  the  road  subsector  has  not  been  able  to \ncontribute  significantly  to  economic  development  and  poverty  reduction  in  the  country.  This  is \nbecause  of  the  inadequacy  of  transport  infrastructure  and  transport  services  between  rural \ncommunities and centers of economic and social activities. Inadequate transport services in rural \nareas are caused by (i) mountainous, hilly, and rolling terrain; (ii) poor condition of existing roads; \nand  (iii)  high  transport  costs  on  such  roads  in  poor  condition. 5  A  cost-effective  road  asset \n\n                                                 \n4  During the last 5 years, vehicle fleets have increased by 30%. Road freight traffic grew by 38% and passenger traffic \n\nincreased by 61% during the same period, according to the National Statistics Agency. \n\n5  Poor  road  infrastructure  also  leads  to  economic  losses  and  limited  access  to  basic  services.  According  to \nWorld Bank.  2004.  Rural  Infrastructure  in  Armenia:  Addressing  Gaps  in  Service  Delivery.  Washington,  DC,  about \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nmanagement  has  to  be  developed  to  improve  road  connectivity  for  rural  communities  in  the \noptimal routes, connecting such communities to the main road network or the nearest centers of \neconomic and social activities. Additional financing, besides central government budgets, needs \nto be mobilized to reap the maximum economic and social development potential in rural areas \nthrough the improvement of road transport connectivity. \n \n10. \nIn  the  road  subsector,  the  Government  has  progressively  pursued  cost  recovery  and \nreduction  measures,  systematic  project  prioritization,  and  subsector  monitoring  activities.  To \nstrengthen the overall road subsector monitoring functions, road infrastructure management can \nbe enhanced by improving the current management system used by ARD, which is responsible \nfor  planning  and  management  of  road  construction  and  maintenance  work  for  the  road  assets \nunder MOTC\u2019s purview. Although the Highway Development and Management Model 4 (HDM4) \nwas introduced for the road asset management system, traffic data were generally a few years \nold and only very brief economic and social assessments were conducted. In 2005, to overcome \nthe  traffic  data  deficiency  problem,  ARD  introduced  automatic  traffic  counters  at  10  locations \nalong  the  six  main  highways,  which  feed  traffic  information  to  the  current  road  management \nsystem.  A  more  comprehensive  road  project  selection  and  monitoring  system  needs  to  be \ndeveloped  to  reduce  the  cost  of  maintaining  road  assets  by  the  systematic  use  of  economic \nanalysis  as  a  basis  for  selecting  the  most  appropriate  time  and  type  of  road  maintenance,  the \nuse  of  improved  road  technology,  and  timely  maintenance  interventions  commensurate  to  the \navailable resources. Such a system needs to include specific monitoring functions with respect to \ntraffic  counts  and  periodic  road  condition  surveys  over  the  road  network,  safety  measures  to \nminimize  accidents,  and  social  and  environmental  measures  to  minimize  risks  associated  with \nroad improvements. \n \nIn  2007,  the  Government  has  allocated  AMD16.16  billion,  which  is  0.6%  of  the  gross \n11. \ndomestic  product  (GDP),  for  road  maintenance.  The  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Expenditure \nFramework  for  2007\u20132009  envisages  increasing  allocations  to  operation  and  maintenance. \nProvision  for  domestic  funding  has  been  made  through  legislation  requiring  10%  of  fuel  tax \nrevenue  to  be  applied  to  routine  maintenance.  While  the  Government  has  made  efforts  to \nachieve  cost  recovery  measures  for  road  network  asset  management,  further  cost  reduction \nmeasures  need  to  be  introduced  by  competitive  bidding  procedures  for  periodic  maintenance, \nsuch as the use of performance-based contracts (PBCs).  \n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\n \n12. \nInefficient  transport  infrastructure  increases  transaction  costs,  constrains  the  economy \nfrom  realizing  its  full  potential,  and  limits  people  from  improving  income  and  non-income \ndimensions  of  poverty.  To  address  this  issue,  the  Government  has  set  rural  infrastructure \ndevelopment  as  the  cornerstone  of  its  PRSP  and  has  prepared  rural  infrastructure  investment \nprograms  to  reduce  rural  poverty.  In  the  road  subsector,  the  Government  developed  a  Lifeline \nRoad  Network  Program  (LRNP)  in  2004,  with  assistance  from  the  World  Bank.  The  LRNP  will \nimprove the access of rural communities to the national highway system in an optimal manner. It \ntargets 784 high priority rural feeder roads (secondary and local roads) totaling about 2,700 km. \n\n                                                                                                                                                            \n40% of total survey participants replied that significant volumes of agriculture produce are lost during transportation; \n18%  of  respondents  put  the  figure  at  40%,  and  24%  of  respondents  considered  that  30%  is  lost  during \ntransportation.  Poor  road  conditions  in  rural  areas  have  constrained  timely  access  to  health  and  other  social \nservices,  and  access  to  schools  (including  the  time  spent  in  education).  Bus  services  and/or  road  freight  services \nhave been reduced or stopped in some rural areas, as operators try to avoid damage to their vehicles or perceive \nhigh  vehicle  operating  costs  of  driving  on  poor/very  poor  condition  roads.  On  the  other  hand,  after  the \nLincy Foundation improved road access of the Noyemberyan area in the Tavush region located in the northeastern \npart  of  Armenia,  the  Noyemberyan  area\u2019s  agricultural  potential  has  been  developed,  and  export  of  agriculture \nproduce and processed agriculture products is taking place from this area to the Russian Federation and Georgia. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nUnder  the  small-scale  technical  assistance  for  preparing  the  Project, 6 the  overall  cost  of  the \nLRNP  was  preliminarily  updated  to  an  estimated  $300  million  at  currently  prevailing  market \nprices.  \n \n13. \nIn  2005,  MOTC  introduced  PBCs  for  routine  and  winter  road  maintenance  covering  all \nroads under MOTC\u2019s responsibility (totaling 3,393 km) for 3 years. Local authorities have carried \nout PBCs for routine and winter road maintenance along local roads. In conjunction with its rural \nroad  rehabilitation  project,  the  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation  (MCC)  will  review  PBC \nperformance  in  2007.  Through  a  regular  project  coordination  mechanism,  MCC  will  share  the \nfindings of the PBC review with ADB and the project management unit (PMU) to be established \nfor the Project. ARD has also introduced a standard provision in civil works contracts to ensure \nincorporation  of  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs)  in  construction  works. The  standard \nprovision  requires  all  contractors  to  provide  financial  resources  ranging  from  1.5%  to  10.0%  of \nthe contract amounts for EMPs. \n \n14. \nIn 2006, MCC committed to provide $67 million for the rehabilitation of rural feeder roads \n(totaling  around  940  km).  The  Government  is  expected  to  finance  nearly  $50  million  for \nimprovement  of  rural  roads  (totaling  532  km)  for  the  next  5  years  and  has  requested  ADB  to \nprovide $30.6 million to upgrade rural roads (adding up to nearly 220 km). In response to ADB\u2019s  \nresource  mobilization  consultations,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  is \nconsidering  financing  (about  $50  million  equivalent)  in  parallel  with  the  Project  by  using  the \nsector lending approach developed by ADB for the Project.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n \n15. \nDuring  project  processing,  MOTC/ARD  and  ADB  have  maintained  policy  dialogue  in \nrelation to the transport sector, particularly in relation to (i) road sector reforms and restructuring \nmatters,  (ii)  cost-effective  road  interventions,  (iii)  road  safety,  and  (iv)  pollution  and  vehicle \nemissions.  The  Government  and  ADB  have  agreed  to  continue  active  policy  dialogue  during \nproject implementation. In particular, the development of a competitive construction industry and \nlogistics industry will be needed to enjoy the full benefits of the investment in road improvements \nand to support the competitiveness of the national economy. MOTC/ARD and ADB will continue \nto  have  regular  policy  dialogue  on  these  issues.  ADB  will  review  and  assist  the  Government\u2019s \nefforts  in  key  policy  areas  that  emerge  from  the  dialogue,  and  through  the  TA  that  will  be \nattached to the Project in support of the development of the transport sector. \n \n\n4. \n\nADB Strategy and Partnerships \n\n \nADB\u2019s interim operational strategy for Armenia7 is to focus ADB interventions on (i) rural \n16. \ndevelopment, (ii) private sector development, and (iii) regional cooperation. The Project has been \nformulated in line with this strategy. \n \nIn  developing  its  support  to  the  road  subsector,  ADB  has  actively  pursued  partnership \n17. \nopportunities with external funding agencies active in the country. The Lincy Foundation, MCC of \nthe  United  States  and  the  World  Bank  are  the  major  external  financing  sources  for  the  road \nsubsector\u2014providing  the  road  subsector  with  a  total  of  nearly  $216  million  since  1995.  During \n1995\u20132004,  the  World  Bank  financed  two  loans  for  road  improvement,  including  institutional \nstrengthening  of  ARD,  a  road  safety  program,  and  institutional  support  to  MOTC.  It \ncommissioned  a  transport  sector  review 8  in  1997  and  is  actively  supporting  a  road  safety \nprogram in Armenia. The Lincy Foundation, established by the Armenian diaspora in the US, has \n\n                                                 \n6  The  small-scale  technical  assistance  was  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  ADB.  2006. \nTechnical Assistance to Armenia for Preparing the Rural Roads Rehabilitation Project I. Manila [TA 4895\u2013ARM].  \n\n7  ADB. 2006. Armenia: Country Economic Report and Interim Operational Strategy (2006\u20132009). Manila. \n8  World Bank.  1997. Republic of Armenia Transport Sector Review. Washington, DC.  \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nprovided  two  grants  for  road  improvement  of  selected  main  and  secondary  highways  and  road \nupgrading in the capital city, totaling $86.9 million during 2001\u20132003. The Government of Japan \nhas  provided  Armenia  with  a  technical  cooperation  project  and  study  totaling  about  $3  million \nequivalent  to  finance  a  landslide  survey,  and  a  grant  (about  $5.0  million  equivalent)  to  finance \nroad  construction  equipment  for  the  capital  city,  through  the  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency (JICA). JBIC is preparing a loan of $50 million equivalent for the LRNP in  parallel with \nthe  Project  by  using  the  same  subproject  selection  criteria  developed  by  ADB.  The  United \nNations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) is conducting a \npre-feasibility  study  on  the  southernmost  part  of  the  international  transport  corridor  between \nGoris  and  Kapan  (totaling  about  60  km)  with  the  potential  total  project  cost  ranging  from  $15 \nmillion to $30 million. ADB has maintained coordination with the international Road Assessment \nProgramme  (iRAP),  which  has  started  developing  a  road  safety  assessment  program  for  the \ninternational road corridors in Armenia.9 External assistance to the road subsector is in Appendix \n3. \n \n18. \nThe Government and ADB have carefully identified the subprojects to be financed under \nthe  Project  by  avoiding  duplication  and  by  systematically  planning  road  subprojects  to  achieve \nmaximum  synergy  among  the  rural  roads  rehabilitation  project  financed  by  MCC,  the \nGovernment, and the Project. Furthermore, to  maximize the benefits of the Project\u2014and serve \nadditional traffic generated from projects in the agriculture, small and medium-sized industry, and \nsocial  sectors  effectively\u2014the  Government  and  ADB  have  identified  the  subprojects  for  the \nProject, taking into consideration all major relevant projects financed by external assistance. This \nincludes the MCC-financed irrigated agriculture project ($146 million). The Project, together with \nthe  two  MCC-financed  projects  (road  and  agriculture),  will  benefit  more  than  73%  of  the  rural \npopulation  in  Armenia.  The  Armenia  Social  Investment  Fund  (ASIF),  with  assistance  from  the \nWorld  Bank,  is  implementing  community-driven  development  in  Armenia  to  reduce  non-income \npoverty  in  rural  areas.  The  World  Bank  has  so  far  completed  ASIF  I  and  II  to  finance  619 \nmicroprojects, and approved ASIF III in September 2006. Road improvement under the Project \nwill  improve  rural  communities\u2019  access  to  major  economic  activities  in  the  capital  city  and \nregional centers, as well as local social service delivery institutions supported by the Government \nand  ASIF  initiatives.  The  Armenian  Small-  and  Medium-sized  Enterprise  Market  Development \nProject financed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has mainly \nsupported the development of small and medium-sized agro-processing industries, which require \ngood  rural  roads  to  gather  agricultural  produce  and  other  inputs  and  deliver  products  to \ninternational  and  domestic  markets  efficiently.  The  Government  is  progressively  implementing \nthe National Program on the Response to the HIV Epidemic (2007\u20132011) with assistance from \nthe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). The United Nations Development \nProgramme (UNDP) is actively implementing its programs on anti-human trafficking in response \nto the recently increasing mobility of people, particularly international movements. \n\n \n5. \n\nNeed for ADB Support for the LRNP \n\n \n19. \nThe  LRNP  will  require  additional  funding  of  about  $180  million  (estimated  at  current \nprices,  net  of  MCC  and  government  commitments  totaling  about  $117  million).  The  majority  of \nthe rural population in Armenia depends heavily on road transport for their daily lives and access \nto jobs, markets, and basic social services. Failure to implement the LRNP would prolong rural \nremoteness  and  poverty  in  rural  communities,  and  exacerbate  the  outward  migration  of  labor. \nThus, the Government has requested financial support from ADB to meet part of its resource gap \nfor the LRNP.  \n\n                                                 \n9  Possibly  to  Georgia  as  well.  The  main  component  will  be  an  international  Road  Assessment  Programme  (iRAP) \nroad  assessment  of  the  international  road  transport  corridors  and  follow-up  activities  to  improve  road  safety  in \nArmenia, in conjunction with World Bank support to road safety. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n20. \nThe Project will have an additional, positive, long-term impact on the four project regions \nand income and non-income dimensions of poverty in rural areas, serving about 10% of the total \nrural population in the country. The outcome will be increased mobility and improved accessibility \nto  basic  social  service  delivery  institutions,  employment  opportunities,  and  to  domestic  and \ninternational  markets  for  the  communities  and  enterprises  in  rural  and  urban  areas  of  the  four \nregions.  The  feeder  roads  improved  under  the  Project  will  lead  to  (i)  higher  and  more  frequent \nquality  transport  services  available  for  road  users;  (ii)  increased  business  opportunities  for \nprivate  sectors  in  general,  particularly  agriculture  (including  agro-processing),  industrial,  and \nservice sectors; and (iii) more synergetic benefits from close partnerships in the road and other \nsectors  relevant  to  the  Project.  The  Project  will  improve  transport  sector  management  through \nTA that will be attached to the Project.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  main  outputs  of  the  Project  will  be  (i)  about  220  km  of  improved  rural  roads; 10 \n21. \n(ii) development of an improved transport sector management system, including a new transport \nsector strategy to strengthen the capability of MOTC; and (iii) establishment of an improved road \nasset management system to enhance the institutional capacity of ARD.   \n \n22. \nThe physical improvements envisaged under the Project will increase the percentage of \nroads  in  good  condition  from  12%  to  15%  at  the  national  level. 11  Road  roughness  will  be \nsignificantly improved from the average international roughness index of 10.9 m/km (poor) to a \nrange of 3.0\u20134.0 m/km (fair/good). Road transport costs and travel time will be reduced by more \nthan 40%. \n \n\n1. \n\nRoad Connectivity Improvement Component \n\n23. \nThis component focuses on rehabilitation of high priority rural roads totaling about 220 \nkm. The subprojects for the Project have been selected and prioritized by using the HDM4; and \ntaking  technical,  economic,  environmental,  and  social  concerns  into  consideration.  Special \nattention has been given to the integrity of the overall road rehabilitation activities supported by \nMCC,  the  Government,  and  the  Project.  The  selection  criteria  and  approval  process  of \nsubprojects  are  in  Appendix  4.  The  list  of  prioritized  subprojects  identified  for  the  Project  is  in \nAppendix 5. \n\n \n2. \n\nRoad Infrastructure Management Component \n\n \n24. \nThe  component  consists  of  (i)  overall  project  management  by  ARD\u2019s  PMU,  and \n(ii) subproject preparation and construction supervision support to the PMU. The main objectives \nof this component are to ensure (i) high quality of preconstruction work, including all necessary \ndue diligence and detailed design for the subprojects; (ii) timely and high quality implementation \nof  the  subprojects;  (iii)  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  subprojects  (covering  technical,  road \nsafety,  economic,  environmental,  and  social  aspects);  and  (iv)  annual  auditing  of  project \nexpenditures. On-the-job training by international consultants will also be conducted to improve \nARD\u2019s skills in road rehabilitation. \n \n                                                 \n10 Includes  two  road  subprojects  totaling  24.9  km  along  the  main  highways.  These  subprojects  were  included  to \n\nmaximize the benefits of rural road improvement in the Vardanis district of Gegharkunik region.  \n\n11 The  Project,  together  with  MCC  and  the  Government,  will  improve  the  share  of  good  road  condition  from  12%  to \n29% in 2011. With JBIC financing, the overall share of good roads will be further increased to about 35% during the \nsame period. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n25. \nThe  major  value  added  of  the  Project  includes  (i)  flexible  financing  and  enhanced \nresource  mobilization  for  the  LRNP  using  ADB\u2019s  sector  lending  modality  and  (ii)  maximized \nimpacts on rural poverty reduction through strong partnerships. \n  \n26. \nSector Lending Modality. The Project has been conceptualized to help the Government \nachieve  its  poverty  reduction  and  economic  development  goals  by  financing  part  of  the  LRNP, \nwhich  targets  784  high  priority  rural  feeder  roads  (secondary  and  local  roads)  totaling  about \n2,700 km. The Government has a well-developed overall road sector plan (2006\u20132015) to meet \nthe  priority  development  needs  of  the  road  subsector  and  the  Government\u2019s  PRSP.  ARD  has \nsufficient  institutional  capacity,  developed  through  the  implementation  of  two  World  Bank-\nfinanced  projects,  to  implement  the  LRNP  in  selecting  and  implementing  subprojects.  The \nGovernment\u2019s road subsector policies, developed with World Bank assistance, are appropriate. \nThus, ADB\u2019s sector lending modality is best suited to meet the financing need. In addition, ADB\u2019s \nsector lending modality, the subproject criteria, and the environmental and social frameworks will \nallow the Government to mobilize additional financing from JBIC and others for the LRNP. \n \n27. \nEnhanced  Partnerships.  The  Project  has  been  designed  to  maximize  benefits  by \nactively  maintaining  operational  partnerships  with  ASIF,  JBIC,  JICA,  iRAP,  Lincy  Foundation, \nMCC,  UNAIDS,  UNDP,  UNESCAP,  USAID,  and  World  Bank.  The  aim  has  been  to  achieve \nmaximum synergy to impact rural poverty. Although HIV/AIDS and human trafficking incidence is \nrelatively  low  in  Armenia  at  this  moment,  the  PMU  and  ADB  will  continue  to  have  proactive \npartnerships with UNAIDS and UNDP in these fields during project implementation. Further, the \nPMU  and  ADB  will  continue  to  pursue  regular  coordination  with  the  World  Bank  and  iRAP, \nregarding road safety.  \n \nD. \n \n28. \nThe project cost is estimated at $41.4 million, including taxes and duties of $5.8 million, \nand  interest  and  other  charges  on  the  loans  from  ADB  during  construction  (Table  1).

MOTC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA).  Responsibility  for  planning,  implementation, \nand  supervision  of  the  Project  will  be  delegated  to  ARD,  a  noncommercial  state  organization \nresponsible  for  planning  and  management  of  road  construction  and  maintenance  work  for  the \nroad  assets  under  MOTC\u2019s  purview.  ARD  will  be  responsible  for  recruiting  consultants  for \nsubproject  preparation  and  construction  supervision,  and  auditing;  preparation  of  bidding \ndocuments; and monitoring, evaluation, and awarding of contracts. Within ARD, a PMU12 will be \nestablished  to  manage  day-to-day  coordination,  implementation,  and  administration  of  the \nProject, while PMU\u2019s team responsible for civil works contract management at the regional level \nwill  supervise  day-to-day  civil  works  contracts.  ADB  and  PMU  will  maintain  close  coordination \nwith  JBIC,  while  they  will  also  maintain  partnership  with  other  partners  related  to  the  Project. \nProject organization and implementation arrangements are in Appendix 7. \n \nIn  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  requirements  for  externally  funded  projects, 13 a \n32. \nproject  governing  council  (PGC),  comprising  representatives  from  key  stakeholders  within  and \nexternal  to  MOTC,  will  provide  overall  oversight  and  supervision  for  the  Project.  The  PGC  will \n                                                 \n12 It is estimated that 15 staff members are required for the PMU. ARD has so far identified 9 members comprising (i) \nhead (deputy director general level), (ii) a procurement officer, (iii) an environmental officer, (iv) a financial officer, (v) \na construction officer, (vi) two construction specialists, (vii) an administrative assistant/interpreter/translator, and (viii) \na driver. Some of them have operational experience with the World Bank road projects. \n\n13 Republic  of  Armenia.  1999.  On  the  Activities  of  Project  Implementation  with  the  Proceeds  of  Loans  and  Grants \nProvided  to  the  Republic  of  Armenia  by  Foreign  States  and  International  Lending  Organizations.  Yerevan. \n(Resolution No. 765, dated 22 December 1999).  \n\n\f \n\n9\n\ncomprise 11 members: (i) minister of MOTC, (ii) first deputy minister of MOTC, (iii) first deputy \nminister  of  finance  and  economy,  (iv)  first  deputy  minister  of  justice,  (v)  deputy  minister  of \nterritorial administration, (v) five representatives from civil society, and (vi) head of the PMU. The \nPGC  meetings  will  be  held  at  least quarterly,  and  the  PMU  will  report and  seek guidance  from \nthe PGC on major procurement issues and policy decisions. The PGC will also provide a forum \nfor coordinating activities among project beneficiaries. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  3  years,  taking  the  construction  season  (May\u2013\n33. \nNovember)  in  Armenia  into  consideration.  Necessary  preparatory  work  has  been  programmed \nfor completion before the construction season. Twenty-four road links preliminarily identified for \nADB  financing  will  be  improved  through  five  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  packages, \nwhich  will  be  completed  in  2008  and  2009,  by  commissioning  them  simultaneously.  Advance \naction  on  the  engagement  of  consultants  for  subproject  preparation  and  project  supervision  is \nongoing.  Surveys  and  detailed  designs  are  expected  to  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2007  and \nsubsequent bid documentation will start in parallel with the detailed design preparation. Bidding \nand award of civil works contracts has been scheduled for completion by April 2008. The Project \nwill be completed when the contractors\u2019 liability for the repair of defects and maintenance ends in \n2010. An indicative implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n34. \nProcurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Civil  works  contracts  will  be  carried  out  by \nusing  ICB  procedures  with  post-qualification  and  as  described  in  the  procurement  plan  for  the \nProject  (Appendix  9).  The  procurement  plan  may  be  reviewed  regularly  and  amended  at  least \nannually covering the next 18 months of procurement activity during project implementation. The \nminimum  amount  of  a  civil  works contract  procured  through  ICB  is  initially  set  at more  than  $1 \nmillion  and  will  be  reviewed  during  implementation.  Procurement  through  national  competitive \nbidding  (NCB)  will  be  conducted  under  the  Borrower\u2019s  legislation  on  procurement,  subject  to \nmodification  and  clarifications  set  forth  in  the  Loan  Agreement.  The  NCB  thresholds  are \npresently set at less than or equivalent to $1 million for civil works and less than or equivalent to \n$500,000 for goods. International shopping will be carried out for goods less than or equivalent to \n$100,000. \n \n35. \nThe  country  presently  imports  bitumen  required  for  road  improvement  from  non-ADB \nmember  countries.  Restricting  bitumen  procurement  to  ADB  member  countries  may  preclude \ncivil  works  contractors  under  the  Project  from  obtaining  the  best  economic  terms,  and  may \nseriously erode economic efficiency. It is proposed that civil work contractors under the Project \nbe allowed to procure bitumen for road improvement from all countries, including from countries \nthat are not ADB members.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n36. \nAbout  30  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  about  162  person-months  of \nnational consultants will be required to work with the PMU for subproject preparation (including \ndetailed  design  and  technical,  environmental,  economic,  social/resettlement  due  diligence); \npreparation of contracts; and project supervision, monitoring, and evaluation (including technical, \nenvironmental, economic, social/resettlement monitoring, and evaluation). ARD will engage one \nconsulting  firm  for  the  services.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  the  quality  and  cost-\nbased  selection  method,  using  full  technical  proposal  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Outline  terms  of \nreference  for  the  consulting  services  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  The  Government \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nrequested  ADB  to  carry  out  the  selection  of  the  consultants,  as  it  is  not  familiar  with  ADB \nprocedures. Once selected by ADB, the Government will negotiate with the selected consultants \nto finalize the consulting contracts and will retain the responsibility to supervise the consultants. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n37. \nADB  has  approved  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  for  the  consulting \nservices  for  subproject  preparation  and  project  supervision,  monitoring,  and  evaluation.  Up  to \n20% of the loan amount may be used to finance eligible expenditures retroactively for consulting \nservices  that  have  been  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  incurred  prior  to  the  loan  effectiveness  but  not  earlier than  12  months  prior  to \nloan signing.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n \n38. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  including  the  EA  and  the  Implementing  Agency  (IA).  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the Loan Agreement and bidding documents for the Project. \nIn particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions \nspecifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  IA  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n39. \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  requires  the  Borrower  to  publish  within  2  weeks  of \nreceiving  ADB\u2019s  \u201cno  objection\u201d  in  an  English  language  newspaper  or  well-known  and  freely \naccessible website the results identifying the bid and lot numbers, and the following information: \n(i) name of each bidder who submitted a bid; (ii) bid prices as read out at bid opening; (iii) name \nand  evaluated  prices  of  each  bid  that  was  evaluated;  (iv)  name  of  bidders  whose  bids  were \nrejected and the reasons for their rejection; and (v) name of the winning bidder, and the price it \noffered,  as  well  as  the  duration  and  summary  scope  of  the  contract  awarded.  For  contracts \nsubject  to  post-review,  the  Borrower  shall  publish  the  results  no  later  than  the  date  of  contract \naward. \n \n\n7. \n\nFinancial Management \n\n \n40. \nARD\u2014the  IA  responsible  for  the  flow  of  funds,  accounting,  reporting,  and  auditing\u2014will \nhandle  the  financial  management  functions  of  the  Project.  An  assessment  of  the  financial \narrangements for the Project was undertaken in May 2007. Based on the financial management \nassessment,  it  was  established  that  ARD  has  acceptable  financial  management  arrangements: \n(i)  accounting  and  reporting  is  performed  with  the  use  of  appropriate  software,  which  was \nassessed to be a reliable and flexible system to record and report with the required details and \nformats; (ii) the bookkeeping system allows the storing of all supporting financial documentation \nrelating to the Project in a systematic manner; (iii) the internal control system is adequate; and \n(iv)  ARD  accounting  staff  have  extensive  experience  with  World  Bank  procedures  for \ndisbursement and financial management under the two road project financed by the World Bank, \nincluding  financial  management  reports.  According  to  the  World  Bank,  financial  management \nsupervisions  and  annual  audits  conducted  in  conjunction  with  the  World  Bank-financed  road \nprojects, implemented by ARD, confirmed the satisfactory financial management arrangement. In \naddition,  ARD  accounting  staff  was  given  training  sessions  on  ADB\u2019s  loan  disbursement \nprocedures during the financial management assessment (Supplementary Appendix B). \n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n41. \nThe ADB loan proceeds for the Project will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  facilitate  project \nimplementation  and  reduce  cash  flow  difficulties  in  pre-financing  project  expenditures,  advance \ndisbursement  through  the  imprest  fund  procedure  is  requested  by  MOTC,  the  EA.  An  imprest \naccount  will  be  set  up  at  a  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  upon  loan  effectiveness  and  will  be \nexclusively  used  to  finance  ADB\u2019s  share  of  eligible  expenditures.  The  imprest  account  will  be \nmanaged by ARD, the IA. The total advances to be financed through the imprest account will not \nexceed  either  6  months  of  estimated  expenditures  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is \nlower. For large civil works contracts under the Project, direct payment procedures will apply. If \nthe  Government  initially  funds  eligible  expenditures  from  its  own  resources,  reimbursement \nprocedures  will  be  used.  To  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  the  documentation  process,  the \nstatement of expenditures procedure will be used for liquidation and replenishment of the imprest \naccount  and  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $100,000  per  individual \ncontract.  Payments  in  excess  of  the  statement  of  expenditures  ceiling  will  be  reimbursed, \nliquidated, or replenished, based on the full supporting documentation process.  \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n42. \nARD, through MOTC, will submit quarterly and annual progress reports to ADB, indicating \nprogress made and problems encountered during the review periods, steps taken to remedy the \nproblems or proposed countermeasures, the proposed activities, and expected progress during \nthe following periods. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the EA will submit to \nADB  a  project  completion  report  providing  details  about  implementation,  costs,  benefits,  and \nother information that ADB may request. \n \n43. \nARD will maintain separate accounts and financial statements for the Project, which will \nbe  audited  annually  by  international  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Auditors  will  be \nselected  and  engaged  by  quality  and  cost-based  selection  or  the  consultants\u2019  qualifications \nselection method, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Annual audit \nreports will include an opinion on the use of the loan proceeds and compliance with the financial \ncovenants  included  in  the  loan  agreements,  if  any,  including  the  use  of  imprest  accounts  and \nstatement  of  expenditures  procedures.  ARD  will  provide  ADB  with  audit  reports  in  English, \ntogether with audited accounts and financial statements, no later than 6 months after the end of \neach fiscal year. \n \n44. \nThe Government was informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited accounts, which \ncovers failure to submit audited accounts and financial statements by due dates. If submission of \na  financial  statement  is  delayed  more  than  6  months  (i)  no  commitment  letter  will  be  issued,  if \napplicable;  and  (ii)  ADB  might  not  approve  new  contact  awards.  If  the  delay  is  more  than  12 \nmonths, loan disbursements may be suspended or the loans may be canceled. \n \n \n \n45. \nThe  PMU,  assisted  by  the  consultants  for  subproject  preparation  and  construction \nsupervision,  will  establish  a  systematic  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  to \nmonitor and evaluate the impacts, outcomes, outputs, and activities in relation to the targets and \nbenchmarks set for each subproject and the Project. \n \n46. \nDuring the  preparation of a group  of subprojects for implementation, ARD and ADB will \nagree  on  a  set  of  baseline  values  of  economic,  social,  environmental,  and  poverty  reduction \nimpact  indicators  for  each  subproject.  With  the  assistance  of  the  subproject  preparation  and \nproject  supervision  consultants,  ARD  will  conduct  participatory  consultations  and  necessary \nsurveys, and collect and assess data at intervals agreed with ADB. Findings of the assessments, \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n10. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\ntogether  with  ARD\u2019s  views,  will  be  submitted  as  part  of  quarterly  reports  of  ARD  to  ADB.  A \ncomplete analysis of impacts and outcomes will be performed at project completion and 3 years \nafter. \n \n\n11. \n\nStakeholder Participation and Consultations \n\n \n47. \nARD  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is implemented  with  the  active  participation  of  relevant \nstakeholders,  using  participatory  practices.  As  part  of  the  project  preparation,  more  than \n16 consultations  covering  both  environmental  and  social  issues  were  held  with  stakeholders, \nincluding  directly  affected  people,  representatives  of  local  governments,  and  the  Council  of \nElderly (key persons in the communities). Issues and activities related to project implementation \nwere  discussed  and  concerns  expressed  (especially  road  safety  and  increased  exposure  to \ncommunicable  diseases  and  human  trafficking)  have  been  integrated  in  the  project  design. \nStakeholder  consultation  and  participation  will  continue  throughout  project  implementation. \nRegular  PGC  meetings  will  systematically  give  opportunities  to  stakeholders  to  express  their \nviews and participate in the decision-making process during project implementation. \n \n\n12. \n\nProject Reviews \n\n48. \nIn addition to regular reviews by ADB, a midterm review of the project implementation will \nbe carried out during the first quarter of 2009. Representatives of ADB and the Government will \ntake  part  in  the  review,  which  will  focus  on  impacts\u2014particularly  those  relating  to  institutional, \nadministrative,  organizational,  technical,  environmental,  and  social  aspects\u2014and  poverty \nreduction. Other parameters that might negatively affect the economic viability and other relevant \naspects  will  be  assessed  during  the  review,  which  will  allow  for  any  necessary  midcourse \nadjustments. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n49. \nThe  Government\u2019s  transport  sector strategy  was  prepared  in  1997  with  assistance from \nthe World Bank.14 In the last decade, international economic integration has increasingly gained \nspeed.  New  technologies  and  expertise  have  emerged,  and  there  has  been  growing  concern \nover  risks  associated  with  mobility  improvement.  Considering  these,  the  Government  finds  a \ngreat  need  for  the  development  of  a  new  strategy  in  order  to  respond  to  transport  demands \neffectively  and  address  both  positive  and  negative  aspects  of  transport  improvement\u2014\nparticularly the road subsector, which is the predominant transport mode in Armenia. Since the \nroad  subsector  has  strong  interlinkage  with  other  transport  modes,  the  development  of  a  new \noverall  transport  sector  strategy  will  support  the  road  subsector  effectively.  The  Project  will  be \nADB\u2019s first intervention in the transport sector in Armenia, so such a transport sector strategy will \nassist ADB in developing its partnership with the Government to implement necessary reforms, \nprioritize  investment,  and  strengthen  much  needed  capacity  for  the  transport  sector,  including \ninstitutional capacity development of the Project\u2019s EA and IA. \n \nTA  will  be  provided  to  improve  transport  sector  performance  so  that  it  can  make  a \n50. \nsustainable  contribution  to  economic  development  and  poverty  reduction  in  Armenia,  which  is \nfacing  ongoing  globalization,  technological  advancement,  and  risks  associated  with  increasing \nmobility. The main purposes of the TA are to support both the development of a new transport \nsector  strategy  and  enhancement  of  the  institutional  capacity  of  MOTC  and  ARD.  The  TA  will \nassess in detail all modes of transport, and identify strategic uses of resources for priority areas \nfor  sector  development  and  operational  needs  for  a  10-year  horizon.  The  TA  will  equip  MOTC \nwith  a  new  transport  sector  strategy  comprising  a  new  vision  and  road  map,  which  will  be  the \nGovernment\u2019s key document guiding policies and investments in the transport sector, including \ntransport  facilitation  for  2009\u20132019.  Specifically,  the  TA  will  (i)  develop  a  reform  action  plan, \n                                                 \n14 World Bank. 1997. Republic of Armenia Transport Sector Review. Washington, DC. \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n(ii) develop  a  management  information  system  for  MOTC  and  ARD,  (iii)  define  a  long-term \ntransport  sector  investment  plan,  (iv)  support  international  transport  facilitation  and  logistics \nsector  development,  (v)  provide  a  capacity  building  development  plan  in  all  aspects  of  the \ntransport  sector,  and  (vi)  support  systematic  resource  mobilization  for  transport  sector \ninvestments. The total TA amount is estimated at $800,000. ADB will finance $600,000 while the \nGovernment  will  finance  $200,000.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA \nfunding program. The consultants will be recruited through the quality and cost-based selection \nmethod, using simplified technical proposal procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of the Consultants. Outline terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n51. \nThe  main  immediate  benefits  of  the  Project  include  long-term  sustainable  savings  in \nvehicle  operating  costs  and  travel  time,  stemming  from  physical  improvements  including  the \ndevelopment  of  an  improved  road  management  system.  The  overall  investments  will  increase \nmobility and accessibility to basic social service delivery institutions, employment opportunities, \nand domestic and international markets for communities and enterprises in rural and urban areas \nof  the  four  regions.  Indirect  benefits  expected  from  the  Project  include  (i)  increased  local \ncontractors\u2019  capability,  (ii)  enhanced  transport  sector  management  capability  of  MOTC,  (iii) \nimproved  road  infrastructure  management  capability  of  ARD,  (iv)  reduced  road  accidents,  (v) \nimproved awareness of risks associated with increased mobility and countermeasures, and (vi) \nincreased awareness of vehicular air pollution and countermeasures. \n \nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n52. \nEconomic  assessment  of  each  of  the  subprojects  included  in  the  Project  has  been \nperformed  based  on  the  expected  benefits  from  the  physical  improvement.  The  benefits \nconsidered are (i) vehicle operating cost savings for passenger and freight traffic resulting from \nthe  improvements  to  riding  quality,  (ii)  generated  traffic  from  the  irrigated  agriculture  project \nfinanced by MCC,15 (iii) induced traffic, and (iv) time savings. \n \n53. \nThe  overall project  economic  internal  rate of  return  (EIRR)  is  estimated  at  43.2%, while \nnet  present  value  (NPV)  is  $83.0  million.  The  impact  of  a  cost  increase  of  20%,  a  benefits \ndecrease of 20%, and a combined cost increase and benefit decrease of 20% on the EIRR and \nthe NPV are shown in Table 4. The economics of the Project are highly robust, as illustrated by \nthe switching values which would reduce NPV to zero (an EIRR of 12%): an increase of 332% in \neconomic  cost,  a  decrease  of  77%  in  project  benefits,  or  a  simultaneous  increase/decrease  of \n62%.

PBCs  will  reduce \nmaintenance costs. ARD\u2019s road subsector management capabilities will be improved over time. \nCompliance with safeguards has been pursued throughout project processing and will continue \nduring  project  implementation  to  ensure  environmental  and  social  sustainability  of  the  Project. \nThese  will  create  a  long-term  sustainable  environment  for  the  road  assets  improved  under  the \nProject. \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n55. \nRehabilitation work under the Project will generally follow the existing carriageway width, \nwhich  is  about  half  of  the  right-of-way.  The  Project  is  categorized  B  and  is  expected  to  have \ninsignificant environmental impacts during both construction and operation stages. The nearest \ndistance  from  any  of  the  subprojects  to  the  protected  areas  (national  park  or  state  reserve)  is \nmore  than  1  km.  No  ecological  or  biodiversity  impacts  are  expected.  Ten  public  consultations \ninvolving a total of 72 local stakeholders have been held and general feedback has been positive \nabout the Project, with little environmental concern. The environmental assessment and review \nprocedures  included  in  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  have  covered  the  future \nsubproject screening and selection process and criteria, and will be followed according to ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy 16  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines. 17  The  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) prepared under the IEE has included mitigation measures, monitoring \nprograms,  and  capacity-building  programs.  Environmental  impact  will  be  assessed  during \nsubproject  preparation,  and  will  be  monitored  and  evaluated  during  project  implementation. \nEMPs  and  IEEs  will  be  prepared  for  the  subprojects  based  on  the  detailed  design  and  will  be \nincluded in the standard contract documents, which require 1.5\u201310.0% of the contract values for \nEMPs.  This  process  will  be  supported  and  monitored  by  the  consulting  firm  for  subproject \npreparation  and  construction  supervision.  A  summary  IEE  (SIEE),  including  the  environmental \nassessment and review framework (EARF), is in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \nD. \n \n56. \nThe  Project  will  also  improve  income  and  non-income  dimensions  of  poverty  in  rural \nareas.  The  Project\u2019s  impact  on  poverty  has  been  quantified  by  examining  the  share  of  total \nproject net benefits that would accrue to the poor and the very poor. About 32% of road users \nwithin the project areas are poor and 6% are classified very poor. Project benefits will accrue to \nabout  40,500  poor  beneficiaries,  of  whom  roughly  7,000  are  very  poor.  A  distribution  analysis \nindicates that the Project will yield a poverty impact ratio of 0.28. Total net benefits accruing to \nthe poor in the project areas are estimated to amount to about $24 million, of which the very poor \nwill  receive  about  $4  million.  Improved  road  infrastructure  will  provide  rural  communities  with \nenhanced  access  to  social  service delivery  institutions including  hospitals,  clinics, and  schools. \nThis  will  support  improvement  of  the  non  income-related  causes  of  poverty.  The  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \nE. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impacts \n\nIndigenous People \n\nAn  initial  social  assessment  was  carried  out  during  project  processing,  covering  all \n57. \npotential  subprojects.  Detailed  socioeconomic  evaluation  of  15  communities 18  has  been \nconducted and more than six consultation meetings were held in these communities. Extensive \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2002. Environment Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n17  ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila.  \n18 With a total population of about 25,820 persons (about 20% of the total people living within the project areas) along \nfour subprojects in Gegharkunik (road link no. 2), Ararat (road link no. 17), and Kotayk (road link nos. 14 and 27). \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nInternally Displaced Persons and Refugees \n\nresearch  on  the  remaining  project  areas  has  also  been  conducted.  The  assessment  has \nconcluded  that  there  are  no  indigenous  people  living  in  the  project  areas.  Thus,  there  is  no \nindigenous peoples\u2019 issue. \n \nF. \n \n58. \nA  total  of  nearly  19,000  internally  displaced  persons  and  refugees  (IDPRs)  live  in  the \nproject areas, which constitute about 15% of the total community population. Of 19,000 IDPRs, \nabout  18,000  persons  are  refugees,  while  the  remainder  is  internally  displaced  persons.  The \nProject  will  provide  the  IDPRs  with  improved  access  to  markets,  job  opportunities,  and  basic \nsocial  services.  The  IDPRs  do  not  live  near  the  road  alignments,  so  there  will  be  no  negative \nimpact  on  the  IDPRs  during  construction.  Surveys  carried  out  during  project  preparation  have \nconcluded that negative impacts on IDPRs are very limited. As ADB\u2019s sector lending modality is \nadopted  for  the  Project,  the  internally  displaced  persons  and  refugees  development  framework \n(IDPRDF)  has  been  prepared  for  these  people  (Supplementary  Appendix  E).  The  consulting \nservices for subproject preparation and project supervision will review potential negative impacts \non these people, and prepare specific actions and development plans for IDPRs, if necessary. \n \nG. \n \n59. \nRehabilitation work under the Project will generally follow the existing carriageway widths, \nwhich  are  about  half of the  right-of-way  widths.  Thus,  no  resettlement is  expected.  It  has  been \nassessed  during  surveys  and  consultations  that  there  is  no  encroachment  to  the  subprojects. \nHowever,  since  ADB\u2019s  sector  lending  modality  has  been  used  for  the  Project,  a  resettlement \nframework  (RF)  was  prepared  to  establish  the  policies  and  procedures  for  compensation, \nrehabilitation, and resettlement of people affected by the Project. The provisions of the RF will be \napplicable in all cases where land acquisition and/or resettlement are/is required as part of the \nimplementation of a subproject. The RF builds on the laws of the Government of the Republic of \nArmenia\u2014principally  the  Constitution,  1995;  the  Land  Code,  2001;  and  the  Civil  Code,  1998\u2014\nand ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy.19 Since government legislation is not fully consistent \nwith ADB policy, the provisions of the RF will take precedence over relevant decrees currently in \nforce in Armenia wherever a gap exists between the ADB policy and Armenian laws. The RF is in \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n \nH. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\nRisks \n\n60. \nThe  major  risks  arise  from  possible  project  preparation  delays,  implementation  delays, \nand low quality of works. To minimize these risks, the Government and ADB have agreed on a \nfeasible  schedule  that  will  be  reviewed  regularly,  and  systematic  procedures  for  subproject \nsubmissions  to  ADB  and  project  implementation  that  are  detailed  in  the  project  administration \nmemorandum (PAM). Consultant support will (i) ensure high quality due diligence for subproject \nselection  and  preparation,  and  (ii)  help  ARD  anticipate  major  factors  in  the  critical  paths  of \nproject  implementation.  Furthermore,  advance  contracting  of  the  consultancy  services  for \nsubproject  preparation  and  construction  supervision  has \nrisks  of  \nimplementation delays. To ensure high quality of works under the Project, consultant support has \nbeen  designed  to  include  provisions  for  project  supervision,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  by \nincluding  qualified  international  and  national  road  engineers  and  pavement  specialists,  road \nsafety  experts, \ntransport  economists,  social/resettlement  specialists,  and  environment \nspecialists. A further risk is cost overrun, which has been reduced through (i) surveys of sample \nsubprojects to estimate more accurate costs, (ii) sufficient price and physical contingencies, and \n(iii) provision of consultants for subproject preparation and project supervision. \n \n\nfurther  minimized \n\n                                                 \n19 ADB. 1995.

The  four  major  strategic  pillars  are  (i)  the \nintroduction  of  cost  recovery  measures,  (ii)  the  adoption  of  cost  reduction  measures, \n(iii) systematic  project  prioritization,  and  (iv)  subsector  monitoring  activities.  The  major \ndevelopments and needs are as follows: \n \n\nCost  recovery  measures.  Provision  for  domestic  funding  has  been  made \nthrough legislation requiring 10% of fuel tax revenue to be applied to routine \nmaintenance. \n\nIn  2005, \n\nCost  reduction  measures. \nthe  Ministry  of  Transport  and \nCommunications  (MOTC)  introduced  performance-based  contracts  (PBCs) \nfor  routine  and  winter  road  maintenance  covering  all  roads  under  MOTC\u2019s \nresponsibility  (totaling  3,393  kilometers  [km])  for  3  years,  while  local \nauthorities  have  carried  out  PBCs  for  routine  and  winter  road  maintenance \nalong  local roads.  In  conjunction  with  its  rural  road  rehabilitation  project,  the \nMillennium  Challenge  Corporation  (MCC)  will  review  PBC  performance  in \n2007.  The  Government  has  been  keenly  pursuing  cost-effective  pavement \ninterventions. \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\nintroduced \n\n(HDM4)  was \n\nSystematic  project  prioritization.  Although  the  Highway  Development  and \nManagement  Model  4 \nroad  asset \nmanagement  system,  traffic  data  were  generally  a  few  years  old  and  only \nvery  brief  economic  and  social  assessments  were  conducted.  In  2005,  to \novercome the traffic data deficiency problem, the Armenian Roads Directorate \nNon-Commercial  State  Organization  (ARD)  introduced  automatic  traffic \ncounters  at  10  locations  along  the  six  main  highways,  which  feed  traffic \ninformation to the current road management system. A more comprehensive \nroad  project  selection  and  monitoring  system  needs  to  be  further  developed \nto  reduce  the  cost  of  maintaining  the  road  assets  by  the  systematic  use  of \neconomic analysis as a basis for selecting the most appropriate time and type \nof  road  maintenance,  the  use  of  improved  road  technology,  and  timely \nmaintenance interventions commensurate to the available resources.  \n\nEnhancement of the monitoring capacity. A new system mentioned above \nneeds  to  include  specific  monitoring  functions  with  respect  to  traffic  counts \nand periodic road condition surveys over the road network, safety measures \nto  minimize  accidents,  and  social  and  environmental  measures  to  minimize \nrisks associated with road improvements. \n\nLong-Term Road Subsector Policy (2006\u20132015) \n\n \nB. \n \n2. \nTo  respond  to  the  challenges  created  by  the  road  infrastructure  deficiency,  the \nGovernment  has  adopted  a  main  road  subsector  policy  until  2015,  focusing  on  the \nrehabilitation and maintenance of existing roads in line with the Poverty Reduction Strategy \nPaper (PRSP).  \n \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2  \n\nin \n\nfor \n\nthree  strategic  goals \n\nThe  Government  adopted \n\nThree Overall Long-Term Road Subsector Strategic Goals \n\nC. \n \n3. \ninfrastructure \ndevelopment for the period 2006\u20132015: (i) maintenance and improvement of the main road \nnetwork  to  enhance  the  country\u2019s  business  competitiveness  and  support  the  economy \nthrough  reduction \ntraffic; \n(ii) improvement of the socioeconomic condition of the rural population through rehabilitation \nof rural roads in support of the PRSP; and (iii) improvement of road safety. The Government \nhas planned to (i) complete the rehabilitation of old bridges and other ancillary facilities along \nthe main highways by 2010, (ii) complete the rehabilitation of secondary roads and bridges \nby 2015,  (iii) meet rural road transport demands in a cost-effective manner, and (iv) ensure \nroad  safety  throughout  all  road  categories.

Decision on Endorsement of the 2006\u20132008 Three-Year Development and \n2006 Rehabilitation and Maintenance Annual Work Plan of the Commonly Used State Roads of the Republic of \nArmenia. Yerevan. (Decision No. 2412-N).  \n \nD. \n \n4. \n \n\nSix Strategic Goals for Road Asset Management (2006\u20132008) \n\nThe goals are to do the following. \n\n(i) \n\nDevelop the overall road network, taking people\u2019s transport needs, economic \ndevelopment prospects, transport demand development, and road safety into \nconsideration. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25\n\n(ii) \n\nReduce transport costs and achieve speedy transport. \n\n(iii) \n\nProvide rural communities with all-weather access throughout the year, while \nminimizing negative environmental impacts. \n\n(iv) \n\nImprove road asset management. \n\n(v) \n\nImprove the quality of roads through the introduction of new technologies and \nmaterials and further development of the domestic construction industry. \n\n(vi) \n\nCreate more job opportunities in the road construction industry. \n\nNetwork and Traffic \n\n5. \nThe  Road Improvement Plan for 2006\u20132008 includes (i) main highway rehabilitation \n(150  km),  (ii)  secondary  road  rehabilitation  (340  km),  and  (iii)  rural  road  rehabilitation \n(335 km). \n \nE. \n \n6. \nThe interstate (main) network of 1,561 km connects all regions (11 regions including \nYerevan)  and  provides  international  links.  The  total  of  1,832  km  of  republican  (secondary) \nroads  connects  district  centers,  and  4,122  km  of  local  roads  provide  access  for  the  rural \npopulation. About 1,000 km of local roads are under the responsibility of regional authorities \nor local communities, the remainder being under state responsibility. Daily traffic volume on \ninterstate roads ranges from 1,000 vehicles to 25,000 vehicles. Magisterial roads (M-roads) \nleading to Georgia in the north and Iran in the south are part of the international corridors. \nThe axle load limit is 11.5 tons on interstate roads and 10.0 tons on all other roads. \n \n7. \nAfter  independence,  expenditure  on  roads  virtually  ceased  and  even  essential \nmaintenance was not carried out due to the economic difficulties. The PRSP states that the \nmain component of the road program up to 2015 should be rehabilitation and maintenance \nof  the  existing  network,  with  particular  attention  to  bridges  in  poor  condition.  Rehabilitation \nand  maintenance  has  been  largely  financed  through  external  sources.  Some  1,400  km  of \nprimary  roads  and  dozens  of  bridges  were  rehabilitated  in  1995\u20132004;  the  average \ninternational roughness index on these roads fell from 7.8 to 3.5 over the period.  \n \n8. \nThe primary road network is well developed\u2014the interstate network (main highways) \nis  fully  paved  while  about  90%  of  republican  roads  (secondary  roads)  are  paved.  ARD \nestimates  the  interstate/republican  surface  condition  to  be  15%  good,  75%  fair,  and  10% \nbad.  Since  2005,  ARD  has  had  automatic  traffic  counters  at  10  locations  on  six  M-roads. \nTraffic volumes are in Table A2.2.

In 2005, for the first \ntime, a 3-year maintenance program was adopted for 2006\u20132008. In 2007, AMD16.16 billion \n(around $50 million equivalent), which is 0.6% of the GDP, has been allocated for operation \nand  maintenance  of  the  road  network.  The  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Expenditure \nFramework  for 2007\u20132009 envisages increasing allocations to operation and maintenance. \nPresently, provision for domestic funding has been made through legislation, requiring 10% \nof fuel tax revenue to be applied to routine maintenance.  \n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27\n\n(PBCs) \n\nIn  2005\u20132008,  ARD \n\nLifeline Road Network Program \n\nintroduced  performance-based  contracts \n\nfor \n10. \nmaintenance operations on a few main and secondary roads on a pilot basis. If successful, \nsuch  contracts  will  be  applied  more  widely.  Under  the  MCC  project,  technical  assistance \n(TA) in 2007 will review PBCs\u2019 performance to date. \n \nG. \n \n11. \nThe  2,702  km  of  the  Lifeline  Road  Network  Program  (LRNP)  includes  road  lengths \nranging from 1 km to 32 km, with daily traffic volumes between 50 and 2,500. One third of \nthe length is republican road, and two thirds are local and community roads. About 60% is \nasphalt  or  bitumen  surface.  Proposed  improvement  levels  were  based  on  traffic  volume. \nImprovement of culverts, bridges, retaining walls, and drainage is a key component.  \n \n12. \nImplementation  of  the  LRNP  was  estimated  by  the  World  Bank  in  2004  to  cost \n$135 million  (for  the  improvement  of  2,677  km,  with  25  km  needing  no  action). Table  A2.3 \nprovides a  broad estimate of the cost of completion at May 2007 prices. Total financing of \nabout  $98  million  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  MCC  is  expect  to  cover \nmore  than  40%  of  the  total  length  (about  2,700  km). 1 The  Government  is  expected  to \ncomplete the rehabilitation of roads totaling more than 532 km. The balance will be 978 km \nand could be completed for about $153 million, including financing from the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC) in the amount of about $50 million equivalent. \n\n \nTable A2.3: Lifeline Road Network Program Cost to Completion \n(May 2007 Prices) \n \nMCC \n0 \n321 \n622 \n\nGovernment Balance \n0 \n122 \n856 \n\nItem \nInterstate (Main) (km) \nRepublican (Secondary) (km) \nLocal (km) \n\nADB \n25 \n78 \n120 \n\n0 \n196 \n336 \n\nTotal \nAverage Cost ($'000/km) \nBase Cost ($ million) \nADB = Asian Development Bank, km = kilometer, MCC = Millennium Challenge Corporation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n978 \n153 \n146.5 \n\n223 \n131 \n29.2 \n\n943 \n71 \n67.0 \n\n532 \n94 \n50.0 \n\nTotal \n\n0 \n759 \n1,918 \n\n2,677 \n112 \n300.0 \n\nRoad Safety \n\n \nH. \n \n13. \nSome progress has been made with the establishment of the National Road Safety \nCouncil, and the development of a road safety program that identifies accident black spots. \nHowever, the World Bank2 notes that the situation is serious and deteriorating.

Within  5  years,  with  road  network  condition  in  general  returned  to  a  fair  state, \nincentives  should  be  introduced  to  accelerate  the  replacement  of  the  oldest  vehicles.  This \nwould  improve  fuel  consumption,  reduce  pollution,  improve  safety,  and  increase  network \ncapacity.  Old  vehicles  have  poor  acceleration  and  hill  climbing  capabilities,  delaying  other \nvehicles.  Annual  testing  of  older  vehicles  against  increasingly  strict criteria,  with  possibly  a \ntrade-in bonus for scrapping, would yield large economic benefits.      \n\n \nTable A2.4: Road Accidents 2001\u20132005 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\n \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\nIncidence \nDeaths \nInjuries \n\n1,021 \n237 \n1,258 \n   Source: National Road Safety Council.

Maintenance \nshould  be  given  priority  because  of  its  much  higher  economic  return,  with  increasing \nimportance  given  to  environmental  and  social  dimensions.  An  enabling  environment  for \nprivate sector participation and state capacity to plan and contract with the private sector is \nparticularly  important.  A  sustainable  set  of  road  user  charges,  and  adoption  of  improved \ntechnologies and strong maintenance management are also required to respond to growing \ndemands for road transport. \n \nlong-term  planning  and  database \n17. \ndevelopment  have  not  been  priorities.

This \nneeds  to  be  based  on  a  range  of  economic  growth  and  regional  development  scenarios, \nsupported  by  an  improved  traffic  flow  database,  particularly  concerning  seasonal  variation \nand peak period traffic volumes. \n\nimmediate  road  subsector  needs, \n\nGiven \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n29\n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SUBSECTOR \n\n \n1. \nThe  Lincy  Foundation,  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation  (MCC)  of  the  United  States, \nand World Bank are the major external financing sources for the road subsector in Armenia\u2014\nproviding the road subsector with a total of nearly $216 million since 1995. \n \n2. \nThe  Lincy  Foundation,  established  by  the  Armenian  diaspora  in  the  US,  has  provided \ntwo  grants  totaling  $86.9  million  for  the  road  subsector:  (i)  $73.4  million  for  rehabilitation  of \n435 kilometers  (km)  of  main  highways  and  secondary  roads  during  2001\u20132003,  and \n(ii) $13.5 million  for  rehabilitation  of  22.3  km  of  streets  in  the  capital  city  during  2002\u20132003.  It \nhas  planned  to  provide  $16  million  to  improve  87.4  km  of  secondary  roads  during 2006\u20132008 \nand $20.9 million for rehabilitation of streets in the capital city totaling 7.5 km during 2004\u20132008. \nTotal financing would total $123.8 million during 2001\u20132008. As part of its assistance, the Lincy \nFoundation improved the road access of the Noyemberyan area in the Tavush region located in \nnortheastern  Armenia.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development1 reported  that \nthe  agricultural  potential  of  the  Noyemberyan  area  has  been  developed,  and  export  of \nagriculture  produce  and  processed  agriculture  products  is  taking  place  from  this  area  to  the \nRussian Federation and Georgia. \n \n3. \nThe US, through MCC, signed a millennium challenge compact with the Government of \nArmenia  (the  Government)  in  March  2006.  In  September  2006,  the  5-year  rural  development \nprogram totaling $235 million on a grant basis was officially inaugurated. The program includes \n(i) a rural road rehabilitation project ($67 million) that will improve up to 943 km of rural roads \nidentified for the Lifeline Road Network Program (LRNP), and (ii) an irrigated agriculture project \n($146 million). The rural road rehabilitation project and the irrigated agriculture project cover all \nregions except the capital city (10 regions). \n    \nDuring 1995\u20132004, the World Bank financed two loans for road improvement, including \n4. \ninstitutional  strengthening  of \nthe  Armenian  Roads  Directorate  Non-Commercial  State \nOrganization (ARD), a road safety program, and institutional support to the Ministry of Transport \nand Communications, totaling about $62 million to the road subsector. In 1997, the World Bank \ncommissioned a transport sector review.2 The World Bank is actively supporting a road safety \nprogram in Armenia and is considering a loan (about $10 million) to finance the proposed traffic \nmanagement  and  safety  project,  focusing  on  Yerevan.  A  traffic  management  study  and \npassenger transport study will be attached to the loan. \n \n5. \nThe  Government  of  Japan  (Japan)  has  provided  Armenia  with  a  study  and  technical \ncooperation  project  (totaling  about $3  million)  to  finance  a landslide survey  through  the  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA).  In  2002,  Japan  provided  a  grant  (about  $5  million \nequivalent) in 2002 to finance road construction equipment for the capital city. Since then, the \nequipment has been used extensively to maintain the road network within the capital city. \n \n6. \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation is preparing a loan of $50 million equivalent for \nthe LRNP in parallel with the Project by using the same subproject selection criteria developed \nby the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \n7. \nThe  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific \n(UNESCAP)  is  preparing  a  pre-feasibility  study  on  the  southernmost  part  of  the  international \ntransport corridor between Goris and Kapan (totaling about 60 km).  \n\n                                                 \n1  Consultation  meeting  with  the  executive  director  of  the  Armenia  Small-  and  Medium-sized  Enterprise  Market \n\nDevelopment Project held on 15 May 2007. \n\n2  World Bank. 1997.

In  respect  to  the  sample  subprojects \nreviewed  under  the  small-scale  technical  assistance,  these  requirements  were  met  during \nproject  preparation.  For  additional  subprojects,  the  requirement  will  be  met  during  project \nimplementation. \n \n3. \nBefore  starting  procurement  actions  for  the  additional  subprojects  for  inclusion  in  the \nsecond  annual  batch,  the  Armenian  Roads  Directorate  Non-Commercial  State  Organization \n(ARD), the Implementing Agency, will submit to ADB for approval, a report providing details of \ncompliance with the selection criteria (para. 1) of each newly proposed subproject in the batch. \nThe approval process for each batch of additional subprojects will be as follows:  \n \n\nwith the assistance of subproject preparation and project supervision consultants, \nARD prepares a consolidated report indicating the compliance of each proposed \nsubproject with the selection criteria, including an overall IEE for all subprojects, \nwhich  will  focus  on  any  environmental  problems  identified  and  mitigation \nrequired,  an  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment,  RP  (if

The benefits considered \nare  (i)  vehicle  operating  cost  savings  for  passenger  and  freight  traffic  resulting  from \nimprovements  to  riding  quality;  (ii)  generated  traffic  from  the  irrigated  agriculture  project \nfinanced  by  the  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation  (MCC),  as  the  Project  is  located  within  the \nimpact  areas  of  the  MCC\u2019s  irrigated  agriculture  project; 1  (iii)  induced  traffic;  and  (iv)  time \nsavings. \n \nA. \n \n2. \n\nThe parameter values for the HDM4 analysis are in Table A10.1. \n\nBasic Parameters \n\nTable A10.1: Typical Vehicle Base Data \n\nItem \nEconomic cost ($) \nFuel ($/liter) \nOil ($/liter) \nTire replacement ($ \nMaintenance labor ($/hour) \nCrew wages ($/hour)   \nNo. of passengers \nPassenger working time ($/hour) \nPassenger nonworking time ($/hour)\nWork-related trips (%)  \nAnnual km (\u2019000 km)   \nVehicle life years \nkm = kilometers. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nPassenger Car Pickup/Minibus Medium Truck\n14,117 \n0.98 \n3.92 \n71 \n4.20 \n1.26 \n10 \n1.00 \n0.30 \n40 \n30 \n8 \n\n17,647 \n0.59 \n3.92 \n112 \n5.60 \n2.80 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n40 \n12 \n\n5,940 \n0.98 \n3.92 \n56 \n4.20 \n\u2013 \n2 \n1.00 \n0.30 \n40 \n23 \n15 \n\n3. \nGenerated  and  Induced  Traffic.  Combined  generated  and  induced  traffic  have  been \nassumed  conservatively  to  be  20%  of  normal  traffic.  Generated  and  induced  benefits  are \ntypically evaluated at 50% of normal traffic benefits\u2014equivalent to a normal traffic increase of \n10%.  \n\n4. \nInternational  Roughness  Index.  Most  of  the  subprojects  are  in  very  poor  condition, \nwith  international  roughness  index  (IRI)  ranging  from  9.2  meters  per  kilometer  (m/km)  to \n20.2 m/km.  Road  rehabilitation  work  envisaged  under  the  Rural  Road  Sector  Project  (the \nProject) will improve the IRIs to less than 4 m/km. \n\n5. \nConstruction  Cost.  Financial  construction  costs  estimated  for  each  subproject  range \nfrom $6.0 million to $0.3 million and are shown in Appendix 5. Unit costs have been updated to \ncurrent prices by the Armenian Roads Directorate Non-Commercial State Organization (ARD), \nbased on the Government\u2019s monthly price list for materials and on the most recent bid data in \n2007.  Economic  costs  have  been  estimated  by  excluding  the  value-added  tax  (20%)  from  the \nfinancial costs. \n                                                 \n1 The Project is located within the MCC project areas of 5 (out of 21) irrigation schemes, with incremental increase in \n\nthe irrigated areas totaling 12,600 hectares.  \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n43\n\nTraffic Analysis \n\nB. \n \n6. \n(Table A10.2). \n\nBase  Year  Traffic  Volume.

The economic internal rate \nof  return  (EIRR)  and  the  economic  net  present  value  (NPV)  (at  a  discount  rate  of  12%)  were \ncalculated  by  comparing  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios  for  a  20-year  period  of \noperation. For the without-project case, a continued worsening of surface condition is calculated \nwithin  the  Highway  Development  and  Management  Model  4  (HDM4)  down  to  the  standard \nmaximum IRI values by pavement type. Without the Project, the deteriorated state of the roads \nwill  result  in  continued  high  transport  costs  for  the  towns/villages  and  rural  areas  they  serve, \nproviding a disincentive to marketing of local produce, communication with other areas, and use \nof newer vehicles. With the Project and other associated rural road projects, the accessibility of \nrural  areas  will  be  transformed,  providing  all-weather  access,  much  faster  travel,  and  lower \noperating costs. Economic benefits accrue in the form of lower vehicle operating costs and road \nuser time savings. Appropriate seasonal adjustments were made to the traffic counts, based on \nan assessment of the local situations. \n\nThe  economic  cost  of  the  Project  comprises  the  resource  cost  of  physical  construction \n9. \nand of an overlay, where required, during the analysis period.

However, there has been a slower pace of poverty \nreduction  in  rural  areas.  This  is  mainly  because  of  constrained  economic  activities\u2014primarily  attributable  to \nmountainous  topography  and  poor  transport  infrastructure\u2014imposing  high  direct  and  indirect  transport  costs  on  the \nrural population.  \n \nRural infrastructure development is the cornerstone of the Government\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). It \nhas  prepared  rural  infrastructure  investment  programs  with  the  main  purpose  of  reducing  rural  poverty.  In  the  road \nsector, it developed a Lifeline Road Network Program (LRNP) with assistance from the World Bank in 2004 that will \nimprove the access of rural communities to the national highway system in an optimal manner. The LRNP targets 784 \nhigh  priority  rural  roads  (secondary  and  local  roads)  totaling  about  2,700  kilometers  (km).  Under  the  small-scale \ntechnical  assistance  for  preparing  the  Rural  Road  Sector  Project  (the  Project),  the  overall  cost  of  the  LRNP  was \npreliminarily estimated at $300 million. \n \nIn 2006, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) of the United States signed an agreement with the Government \nto finance the rehabilitation of rural roads totaling about 943 km of the LLNP, with grant financing of about $67 million, \nwhile the Government has planned to rehabilitate rural roads adding up to about 532 km. In parallel, the Government \nhas requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to consider financing the rehabilitation of high priority rural roads \ntotaling about 220 km in Ararat, Armavir, Kotayk, and Gegharkunik regions. The Project is in line with the PRSP. \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                            Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention  \n                                                                                                 (geographic poverty) \n \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe Project is located in Ararat, Armavir, Kotayk, and Gegharkunik regions with a total population of nearly 1 million. \nRoughly 54% of the total rural population in Armenia lives in these four regions and about 61% (about 650,000) of the \ntotal population in the four regions live in rural areas. The incidence of poverty ranges from 30.9% to 34.5%, against \nthe national average of 29.8% in 2005.  \n \nPoor road infrastructure has also led to economic losses and limited access to basic services. According to the World \nBank,a about 40% of total survey participants replied that significant volumes of agriculture produce were lost during \ntransportation, 18% responded that 40% was lost, and 24% stated that 30% was lost. \n \nPoor road conditions in rural areas have constrained timely access to health and other social services, and access to \nschools  and  time  spent  on  education.  Bus  services  and/or  road  freight  services  in  some  rural  areas  have  been \nreduced or stopped because operators try to avoid damages to their vehicles or perceive high costs of driving on very \npoor/poor roads. \n \nThe Project will rehabilitate high priority rural roads totaling about 220 km in Ararat, Armavir, Kotayk, and Gegharkunik \nregions,  serving  71  communities  with  a  total  population  of  127,000  (about  10%  of  the  total  rural  population).  It  will \nimprove the access of these communities to (i) the capital city and regional center through the main road network; and \n(ii)  social  service  delivery  institutions,  markets,  collection  points  for  agriculture  produce  and  diary  products,  agro-\nprocessing  centers,  and  industrial  processing  areas.  As  a  result,  the  Project  will  be  able  to  offer  communities  new \nopportunities  for  industrial,  agricultural  (including  small-  and  medium-sized  agro\u2013processing  industries),  and  service \nsectors. The Project has been developed in close partnerships with the road program and agriculture programs being \n\n \n \n\nA. \n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nfinanced by MCC, Armenian Social Investment Fund (ASIF),b Armenian Small- and Medium-sized Enterprise Market \nDevelopment Project financed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), National Program \non the Response to HIV Epidemic (2007\u20132011) being implemented by the Government with assistance from the Joint \nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and UNDP\u2019s programs on anti-human trafficking. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  impact  on  poverty  has  been  quantified  by  examining  the  share  of  total  project  net  benefits  that  would \naccrue  to  the poor  and  the  very  poor.  A  distribution  analysis  conducted  during  project  preparation  indicates  that  the \nProject  will  yield  a  poverty  impact  ratio  of  0.28.  The  high  poverty  impact  ratio  reflects  a  high  incidence  of  poverty \namong  direct  beneficiaries  and  a  substantial  net  transfer  of  resources  from  the  economy  as  a  whole  to  the  project \nareas. Total net benefits accruing to the poor amount to about $24 million, of which the very poor will receive about $4 \nmillion. Some 32% of road users within the project areas are poor and 6% are classified very poor. Project benefits will \naccrue to about 40,500 poor beneficiaries, of whom roughly 7,000 are very poor. \n \nThe Project will target four regions where poverty incidence is worse than the national average. Thus, the Project is \nclassified a geographically targeted intervention. \n \n\nC.  Participation Process \n \n\n \n\n \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nAs part of the project preparation, more than 15 consultations (covering both social and environmental aspects) were \nheld  with  stakeholders,  including  directly  affected  people,  representatives  of  local  governments  and  the  Council  of \nElderly, key  persons in the communities. Issues and activities related to project implementation  were discussed and \nconcerns  (especially  road  safety  and  increased  exposure  to  communicable  diseases  and  human  trafficking)  have \nbeen  integrated  in  the  project  design.  Stakeholder  consultation  and  participation  will  continue  throughout  project \nimplementation. Armenian Roads Directorate Non-Commercial State Organization (ARD), the Implementing Agency, \nwill  ensure  that  the  Project  is  implemented  with  the  active  participation  of  all  stakeholders,  using  participatory \npractices. \n \nConsultations  (social  aspects)  with  key  players  in  the  country  and  road  sector  development  as  well  as  communities \nwithin the project areas were conducted during project preparation. Literature reviews on social and poverty analysis \nof the poverty situation in the project regions were also conducted. The key players involved in the consultations were \nthe World Bank, MCC, Lincy Foundation, ASIF, PRSP secretariat, UNAIDS, and UNDP. \n \nSix  consultations  (social  aspects)  were  held  with  representatives  of  local  government  and  the  Council  of  Elderly \n(Avagani); key persons in the communities (school principals, teachers, and agronomists); and community members in \nthe project areas (Varnenis in the Gegharkunik region; Barzdrashen and Arevshat in the Ararat region; and Numus, \nDzoraghbiur, and Mayakovsky in the Kotayk region). \n \nAll  stakeholders  and  project  beneficiaries  welcomed  the  initiatives  and  considered  that  the  Project  will  have  a \nsignificant  positive  impact  on  rural  development.  First,  they  consider  that  the  roads  are  extremely  important  for \nagricultural activities, agro-processing business, and any  other business in the communities. People also mentioned \nthat  the  delivery  of  agricultural  produce  to  domestic  and  international  markets  and  the  procurement  of  inputs  for \nagricultural  activities  and  agro-processing  business  will  be  more  efficient  with  good  roads.  Improved  rural  road \ninfrastructure  will  also  reduce  the  transportation  costs  and  damages  to  agriculture  produce.  As  a  result,  prices  of \ngoods  are  expected  to  reduce  and  volumes  of  agriculture  produce  for  sales  will  increase.  The  consultations  have \nconcluded that the Project will support improvement of the income-related Millennium Development Goals. Secondly, \nimproved road infrastructure is an important component of social development and of the quality of rural life because it \nprovides rural communities with enhanced access to social service delivery institutions including hospitals, clinics, and \nschools.  The  consultations  have  concluded  that  the  Project  will  support  improvement  of  the  non  income-related \nMillennium Development Goals.  \n \nIn accordance with the Government\u2019s requirements for externally funded projects,c  a project governing council (PGC) \nwill be established. The PGC will provide overall oversight and supervision for the Project. It comprises 11 members: \n(i)  minister  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC),  (ii)  first  deputy  minister  of  MOTC,  (iii)  first \ndeputy  minister  of  finance  and  economy,  (iv)  first  deputy  minister  of  justice,  (v)  deputy  minister  of  territorial \nadministration, (v) five representatives from civil society, and (vi) head of the project management unit (PMU).   \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n49\n\n \nPGC  meetings  will  be  held  at  least  quarterly,  and  the  PMU  will  report  and  seek  guidance  from  the  PGC  on  major \nprocurement  issues  and  policy  decisions.  The  PGC  will  provide  a  forum  for  coordinating  activities  among  project \nbeneficiaries.  \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen accounted for 53.8% of the total project survey respondents. The overall poverty rate for the project regions \nwas 33.3%; 29.7% of women are poor. The extreme poverty rate for the project regions was 5.8%; 4.6% of the women \nare very poor. Therefore, women are slightly better off than the overall population in the project regions. The majority \nof  women  in  the  project  areas  are  engaged  in  agriculture  activities  or  small-  and  medium-sized  agro-industries \n(including  cottage  agro-industries).  Reduced  travel  time  and  more  available  transport  services  will  help  improve  the \nlives  of  women  and  children,  as  improved  road  transport  under  the  Project  will  enhance  their  access  to  the  nearest \nmarkets  and  social  service  delivery  institutions  (such  as  schools,  hospitals,  and  clinics)  and  increased  employment \nopportunities. It is anticipated that greater road connectivity may have a direct and positive impact on less educated \ngirls and women by promoting their access to more education and training opportunities.  \n \nDuring the project surveys, women considered that the roads are extremely important for agricultural activities, agro-\nprocessing  business,  and  any  other  business  in  the  communities.  Secondly,  they  considered  that  improved  road \ninfrastructure is an important component of social development and of the quality of rural life because it provides rural \ncommunities with enhanced access to social service delivery institutions including hospitals, clinics, and schools.  \n \nOther  concerns  are  that  the  Project  will  increase  the  potential  of  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  and  other  sexually \ntransmitted infections because of the influx of construction workers and increased transport facilitation caused by the \nroad  improvements.  Human  trafficking  of  teenage  girls  and  women  is  an  additional  risk  related  to  increased  road \nconnectivity. These risks will be minimized and mitigated by maintaining close coordination and regular consultations \nwith the National Program on the Response to HIV Epidemic (2007\u20132011) being implemented by the Government with \nassistance from UNAIDS and UNDP\u2019s programs on anti-human trafficking to raise awareness and provide preventive \nmeasures  for  local  communities  (with  a  special  focus  on  women),  construction  workers,  and  mobile  population. \nAppropriate actions will be taken, if necessary. \n \nIn general, women as well as the remaining community members within the project areas will benefit from the Project. \nThus, a specific gender strategy has not been prepared.  \n \n \nHas an output been prepared? \na  World Bank. 2004.

Both  passenger \nand  freight  transport  services  in  the  project  areas  will \nbecome more competitive as more passenger and freight \ntransport service providers are expected to operate. As a \nresult,  more  passenger  and  freight  transport  services  will \nbecome cheaper. \n \n \nThere  are  no  significant \nthe \nobjectives  under  the  Project  is  to  maximize  benefit \ngeneration  for  the  people  of  communities  within  the \nproject  areas\u2014especially  the  poor  and  the  very  poor, \nwomen,  and  internally  displaced  persons  and  refugees \n(IDPRs)\u2014by  ensuring  that  all  applicable  labor  laws  and \nregulations  are  adhered  to  by  all  road  contractors,  and \nthat local employment is promoted to the fullest. This does \nnot  require  a  specific  plan  but  the  following  provision  will \nbe  built  into  relevant  documents  and  will  be  monitored \nunder the project  performance monitoring program. \n \nContracts  will  specifically  refer  to  maximizing  the  use  of \nlocal  labor,  require  that  legal  wages  be  paid  to  workers, \nprohibit  use  of  child \nfor  construction  and \nlabor \nmaintenance,  and  ensure  that  wages  paid  to  men  and \nwomen  are  commensurate  with  the  nature  of  work.  A \nspecific  provision  will  be  placed  in  bidding  documents  to \nnote  that  compliance  will  be  strictly  monitored  during \nproject implementation. \n \n \nThere are no indigenous people living in the project areas, \nso there is no indigenous peoples\u2019 issue.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n51\n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nPlan Required \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\nfound \n\n \n \nRoad Safety \n \nProject  beneficiaries  are  concerned  about  an  increase  in \nroad  accidents  because  of  increased  vehicle  speeds \ninduced  by  improved  road  infrastructure.  Concern  was \nexpressed by both women and men about the risk to their \nchildren commuting to school along the roads. Pedestrian \nstrips  and  other  necessary  road  safety  measures  have \nbeen incorporated in the basic design of the roads. A road \nsafety  specialist  to  be  engaged  under  the  subproject \npreparation  and  project  supervision  will  conduct  roads \nsafety  audit  of  all  the  roads  and  will  recommend  all \nnecessary road safety measures along all the roads.  \n \nInternally Displaced Persons and Refugees \n \nThe  surveys  conducted  during  project  preparation  found \nthat  nearly  19,000  IDPRs  live  in  the  project  areas,  which \nconstitute  about  15%  of  the  total  community  population. \nOf the 19,000 IDPRs, about 18,000 persons are refugees, \nwhile  the  remainder  is  internally  displaced  persons.  The \nProject  will  provide  the  IDPRs  with  improved  access  to \nmarkets, job opportunities, and basic social services. The \nIDPRs do not live near the road alignments, so there  will \nbe no negative impact on them during construction. Thus, \nthe surveys have concluded that negative impacts on the \nIDPRs  are \nIDPR \nto  be  very \ndevelopment  framework  has  been  prepared,  as  ADB\u2019s \nsector \nthe  Project. \nConsulting services for subproject preparation and project \nsupervision  will  review  potential  negative  impacts  on \nIDPRs,  and  prepare  specific  actions  and  development \nplans for them, if necessary. \n \nIncreased  Exposure  to  Communicable  Diseases  and \nHuman Trafficking \n \nThere is a risk of increasing the infection rate of HIV/AIDS \nduring \nin \nconstruction trucks and equipment are expected. There is \nalso  a  risk  that  lack  of  awareness  of  HIV/AIDS  among \nconstruction  workers  and  communities  may  make  people \nliving in the project areas (especially the poor, very poor, \nand IDPRs) vulnerable. Human trafficking of teenage girls \nand  women \nincreased  road \nconnectivity.  These  risks  will  be  minimized  and  mitigated \nby  maintaining \nregular \nconsultations with the National Program on the Response \nto  HIV  Epidemic  (2007\u20132011)  being  implemented  by  the \nGovernment  with  assistance  from  UNAIDS  (including  the \nfour  project  regions),  and  UNDP\u2019s  programs  on  anti-\nhuman \nraise  awareness  and  provide \npreventive measures for local communities (with a special \nfocus  on  women),  construction  workers,  and  mobile \npopulations.
