It is divided into three main components, with each one having different target groups \nand objectives.  \n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nComponent A uses $82 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to provide \ndollar financing to the government for relending to IDCOL to finance large private \nsector-sponsored infrastructure subprojects of at least $30 million.  \nComponent  B  provides  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  funding  of  $50  million \nequivalent to the government for relending in local currency to IDCOL to finance \nsmall  and medium-sized  infrastructure  subprojects  primarily  located  in  rural  and \nsemi-urban areas, especially in the energy sector.  \nComponent  C  provides  ADF  funding  of  $33  million  equivalent  for  IDCOL\u2019s \nongoing renewable energy program. One of the main objectives of this program \nis  to  help  provide  the  rural  population  in  off-grid  areas  with  access  to \nenvironment-friendly  electricity  by  financing  renewable  energy  systems  (RESs), \nsuch as solar home systems (SHSs), biomass and biogas installations, through a \nmicrofinance-based, direct sales program. \n\nStatus of Project Implementation \n\n \nB. \n \n4. \nAs  of  April  2011,  there  have  been  no  disbursements  under  component  A.  However,  a \nnumber of projects are expected to reach financial closure within the next few months. IDCOL is \ncurrently  reviewing  the  financing  of  3  independent  power  plants 3  recently  awarded  by \nBangladesh Power Development Board. In addition, 12 projects totaling 2,295 megawatts (MW) \nare in the pipeline. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Established by the Government of Japan. \n2  The revised design and monitoring framework is in the Appendix. \n3  Summit Group, the largest power conglomerate in Bangladesh, has recently been awarded the right to develop 3 \nlarge  independent  power  plants:  (i)  the  2  Bibiyana  gas-fired  combined  cycle  power  plants  of  341  MW  each  for \nphases 1 and 2, and (ii) the Meghnaghat 335 MW dual fuel-combined cycle power plant. In addition, the Ranhill-\nSTS-Consortium from Malaysia has won the bid to build the Bhola 225 MW gas-fired combined cycle power plant. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nUnder  component  B,  ADB  has  made  one  disbursement  of  $5  million  in  April  2010  to \n5. \nIDCOL for providing a term loan facility of Tk350 million to an information technology company \nfor the establishment and operation of a nationwide wireless broadband network. Another local \ncurrency  loan  of  Tk200  million  from  IDCOL  to  a  company  that  operates  a  nationwide \ntelecommunication  transmission  network  using  fiber  optic  technology  has  been  approved  by \nIDCOL\u2019s  board  and  will  soon  be  disbursed.  IDCOL\u2019s  current  project  pipeline  for  component  B \nconsists of several small to medium-sized, primarily gas-fired power plants. In addition, IDCOL\u2019s \nboard has approved 3 projects that will set up solar photovoltaic module assembly facilities with \na capacity ranging from 5 MW to 10 MW each. \n \n6. \nProgress  in  implementing  component  C  to  finance  access  to  environment-friendly \nelectricity in off-grid areas has been successful. As of April 2011, 97% or $32 million of the total \navailable ADF funds of $33 million have been disbursed to finance 104,273 SHSs. It is expected \nthat the unutilized amount will be disbursed in the next few months for further financing of SHSs.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nIDCOL\u2019S RENEWABLE ENERGY PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n7. \nLack  of  access  to  reliable  electricity  has  been  one  of  the  most  severe  constraints  to \neconomic growth and improved livelihoods in Bangladesh. Although 75% of the population lives \nin  rural  areas,  only  about  30%  of rural  households  have  access  to grid electricity. The  current \nelectrification rate is about 400,000 households a year and, at such a rate, it would take more \nthan  40  years  to  reach  all  households.  Against  this  backdrop,  the  power  sector  has  been \nprioritized by the government to provide universal electricity access by 2020. \n \n8. \nGiven  the  slow  pace  of  grid  extension,  the  government  strategy  emphasizes  the \npromotion  of  off-grid  renewable  energy  technologies  in  rural  areas  as  a  priority.  Thus,  off-grid \nelectrification  based  on  RESs  is  the  only  readily  available  and  cost-effective  electricity \napplications  for  millions  of  people  in  areas  without  access  to  a  conventional  energy  supply. \nSuch  applications  are  wide-ranging,  including  SHSs,  biomass,  micro-wind  power  systems  in \ncoastal areas, and mini-hydro projects in the mountainous regions. \n \n9. \nPromotion  of  renewable  energy  is  also  preferred  from  the  viewpoint  of  providing  clean \nenergy  technologies,  since  most  of  the  power  generation  in  Bangladesh  for  lighting  and \npumping water for irrigation uses kerosene and diesel. About 75% of the population also relies \non  biomass,  such  as rice  straw,  dried  leaves,  jute  sticks,  cow  dung,  or wood,  for  cooking  and \nheating.  These  sources  of  energy  cause  high  CO2  emissions  and  are  an  inefficient  use  of \nresources.  Introduction  of  efficient  renewable  energy  can  thus  have  a  positive  impact  on  the \nenvironment by reducing CO2 emissions and preventing deforestation. To accelerate the use of \nthese  energy  applications,  the  government  decided  to  mandate  IDCOL  with  the  financing  of \nSHS installations and other renewable energy applications in off-grid areas. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nIDCOL\u2019s  renewable  energy  program  provides  refinancing,  sets  technical  specifications \nfor  equipment,  develops  publicity  materials,  extends  loans,  installs  the  systems,  monitors  their \nperformance, and provides maintenance support. In particular, IDCOL provides: \n \n\nOverview of IDCOL\u2019s Renewable Energy Program \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nloans at 6%\u20138% (per annum) to participating organizations,4 which then provide \ncustomers in rural areas with financing of up to 80% of the cost of an SHS5 with a \ncapacity of 10\u2013130 watts;6  \nloans  to  companies  for  biomass  installations  in  rural  or  semi-urban  areas,  and \nfinancing  for  commercial  and  semi-commercial  biogas  plants  or  biogas-based \nelectricity plants; and \nloans and grants for solar irrigation pumps.  \n\n \nFunds  used  by  IDCOL  for  refinancing  stem  exclusively  from  donor  loans  channeled \n11. \nthrough the government. IDCOL\u2019s main responsibility is, therefore, to raise and channel funding \nin the form of loans to participating organizations and to monitor the overall performance of its \nrenewable  energy  program.  Participating  organizations,  in  a  second  step,  will  then  select \nsubproject  areas  and  potential  customers,  extend  loans,  install  the  systems,  monitor  their \nperformance, and provide maintenance support.  \n \nIn  addition  to  the  refinancing  arrangement,  donors  devised  a  grant  scheme 7  to \n12. \nincentivize  IDCOL  and  its  participating  organizations  to  increase  the  affordability  of  these \nrenewable energy applications to buyers in rural off-grid areas, where the poorer section of the \npopulation  normally  lives.  The  prices  of  SHSs  depend  not  only  on  the  institutional  capacity  of \nIDCOL and its participating organizations in operating cost-efficiently but also on world prices for \nthe various system components that are subject to demand and supply. Thus, the grant scheme \nwill  shelter  end-users  from  some  of  the  price  fluctuations  as  well  as  accelerate  use  of  the \nprogram.   \n \nC. \n \n13. \nSince IDCOL first started to finance SHSs in collaboration with the World Bank in 2002, \nthe initial target of financing 50,000 SHSs was achieved in August 2005, 3 years ahead of the \ntarget  date  and  $2  million  below  estimated  costs.  In  view  of  this  successful  program \nimplementation,  IDCOL  raised  its  target  to  finance  1,000,000  SHSs  by  2012.  As  of  October \n2010,  a  total  of  702,574  SHSs  have  been  installed  and  the  current  installation  rate  is  roughly \n\nStatus of IDCOL\u2019s Solar Energy Program \n\n                                                 \n4  IDCOL\u2019s  renewable  energy  program  is  innovative  because  it  is  implemented  through  participating  organizations, \nwhich  are  nongovernment  organizations,  microfinance  institutions,  and  private  entities.  These  participating \norganizations  select  project  areas  and  potential  customers,  extend  loans,  install  the  systems,  and  provide \nmaintenance support. Through this scheme, IDCOL can take advantage of participating organizations\u2019 grassroots \nnetworks,  which  are  vital  for  introducing  efficient  technology  to  underdeveloped  rural  areas  and  encouraging \ncommunity participation. \n\n5  SHSs  are  small  photovoltaic  systems  with  a  peak  capacity  of  between  10  watts  and  130  watts  and  comprise  a \nsolar panel, battery, charge controller, wires, and loads. The estimated technical lifetime of a solar panel for a SHS \nis about 20 years, 5\u20137 years for a battery, and 3 years for a charge controller. Maintenance and after-sales service \nare provided free of charge within the first 3 years of purchase. During this time, the systems are regularly checked \nby  participating  organization  staff  while  collecting  the  monthly  installments.  After  the  3-year  payback  period, \nmaintenance is provided by the participating organizations for a minimal monthly fee. As SHS users are owners of \ntheir systems, motivation to keep the system running will be high. As there are no further monthly installments after \nthe payback period, the payment of a small monthly service fee as well as the replacement of the battery every 5 \nyears will not be a major financial obstacle. \n\n6  SHS  are  used  mainly  by  low-  and  middle-class  households,  and  micro-  and  small  enterprises  in  off-grid  rural \nlocations  to  operate  light  bulbs,  small  electrical  appliances  like  mobile  chargers,  and  black  and  white  television \nsets. Households, and micro- and small enterprises buy SHSs either by cash or credit, but they are required to pay \na minimum 10% of the cost as a down payment. The price of a typical 50-watt SHS is about $400. \n\n7  The grant scheme consists of (i) a buy-down grant to reduce the consumer price of the SHS, (ii) a grant to IDCOL \nfor  management  and  monitoring  of  the  use  of  refinancing  loans  and  grant  components,  and  (iii)  an  institutional \ndevelopment fund available to the participating organizations to widen their outreach capacities in rural areas. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nStatus of IDCOL\u2019s Financing of Other Renewable Energy Applications \n\n30,000 SHSs per month. At this pace, it is expected that the target will be achieved by August \n2011. Therefore, IDCOL has recently revised its target to 2.5 million SHSs by 2014. \n \n14. \nAs  of  September  2010,  additional  funding  from  the  World  Bank  and  other  donors, \nincluding ADB and the Islamic Development Bank, to IDCOL\u2019s solar energy program amounted \nto  approximately  $170  million.  In  addition,  the  Global  Environment  Facility,  Global  Partnership \non  Output-Based  Aid,  and  German  development  cooperation  through  GIZ  and  KfW  pledged \ngrants worth $45.5 million.  \n \nD. \n \n15. \nBeyond  the  financing  of  SHSs,  IDCOL  finances  other  renewable  energy  applications \nsuch  as  biogas,  biomass,  solar,  and  wind  energy  installations.  IDCOL  finances  up  to  80%  of \ntotal  costs  of  renewable  energy  subprojects  by  providing  a  combination  of  debt  and  grant \nfinancing.  A  financial  analysis  for  each  subproject  determines  the  necessary  grant  and  loan \nelements, with grant financing constituting a maximum of 50% of total subproject costs for solar \nmini-grid  projects  and  40%  for  solar  irrigation  projects.  With  regard  to  biomass  and  biogas-\nbased power plants, one 250 kilowatt (kW) project is already in operation, while one biomass-\nbased power plant with a capacity of 400 kW and one biogas-based power plant of 50 kW are \nunder  construction.  One  additional  350  kW  biogas-based  power  plant  has  been  approved  by \nIDCOL\u2019s board and will start construction soon. In addition, an 11.2 kW solar irrigation pump is \nin operation and an 8.4 kW solar irrigation pump will be constructed shortly. Finally, IDCOL has \ngiven preliminary approval for the financing of 17 solar irrigation pump projects. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY GRANTS \n\nProposed Changes \n\n \nA. \n \nThe proposed changes relate to the grant funding for component C of the project, which \n16. \nfinances  RESs.  ADB  originally  intended  to  apply  for  grant  financing  from  the  Asian  Clean \nEnergy  Fund  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  and  from  the  Climate \nChange Fund in parallel with the processing of the project. However, the application process for \nfunding from these 2 sources was not completed by the time the project was approved by ADB\u2019s \nBoard  on  2  October  2008.  As  a  consequence,  the  grant  financing  is  being  processed  as \nsupplementary grants for the project. The proposed allocation of $3.3 million to the project will \nbe funded as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nGrant  cofinancing  equivalent  to  $2,000,000  will  be  provided  by  the  Asian  Clean \nEnergy  Fund 8  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility,  and \nadministered by ADB.  \nA  grant  of  $1,300,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  will  be  provided  by \nthe Climate Change Fund (CCF).9  \n\n \n17. \nThe total grant amounts will be divided into two parts to pursue distinct objectives, apply \nspecific lending modalities, and target different beneficiary groups. Part 1 will use the $2 million \nallocation  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  to  enable  participating \norganizations (through IDCOL) to provide buy-down grants and institutional development grants \nfor individual SHSs of at least 10 watts. The buy-down grant for each SHS will be $2510 and will \n                                                 \n8  Established by the Government of Japan. \n9  Established by ADB.  \n10 The proposed $25 grant provided by part 1 is in line with those provided by some of the other donors.  \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nbe  limited  to  one  such  grant  per  household.  Funds  may  be  disbursed  to  the  participating \norganizations  by  IDCOL  after  sufficient  verification  in  accordance  with  the  procedures \nestablished under component C of the project. This will enable at least 80,000 low- and middle-\nincome  households  in  IDCOL\u2019s  solar  energy  program  to  benefit  from  a  reduced  SHS  price. \nWhile  loan  financing  under  component  C  of  the  project  is  largely  exhausted,  the  proposed \nsupplementary grants will support loan financing for SHSs provided by other donors.  \n \n18. \nUnder part 2, IDCOL will use $580,000 of the allocation of $1.3 million under the CCF to \noffer  grants  under  its  direct  financing  activities  to  some  of  its  medium-scale  subprojects  using \nrenewable energy applications such as biomass, biogas, and wind energy installations in rural \nareas  with  no  access to grid  electricity.  Up to  50%  of the  total cost  of an  individual  subproject \ncan  be  financed  with  a  grant  from  part  2.  As  was  the  case  with  the  implementation \narrangements  under  component  B  of  the  project,  the  first  3  subprojects  to  receive  grant \nfinancing under part 2 will be submitted to ADB for review and approval prior to disbursement by \nIDCOL, unless otherwise agreed between ADB and IDCOL. \n \nThe remaining amount under the CCF will be provided to IDCOL to pay for the following \n19. \nexpenses  related  to  the  administration  and  monitoring  of  its  renewable  energy  program  under \npart 1:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n$357,000  as  the  program  support  administration  cost  of  IDCOL  for  the \nmanagement and monitoring on the use of the grant component\u2014this amount is \nbased on an administration cost of $4.46 per SHS11 installed.12 \n$233,000  as  an  institutional  development  fund  for  the  training  of  participating \norganization staff and their customers to widen their outreach capacities in rural \nareas.  Because  of  the  expanding  network  of  supply  and  maintenance  outlets, \nmaintenance,  services,  and  spare  parts  are  available  within  a  reasonable \ndistance from the SHS customers. Currently, the typical radius for each outlet is \naround 10 kilometers. \n$30,000 for technical inspections.13 \n$60,000  for  annual  technical  audits14 to  be  carried  out  by  an  audit  firm  for  2 \nconsecutive years. \n$40,000  for  appointing  independent  engineers 15 to  conduct  feasibility  studies, \nand appraise and monitor renewable energy projects. \n \n\n                                                 \n11 The proposed administration cost per SHS unit of $4.46 reflects a reduction of 50% from IDCOL\u2019s current rate as a \n\nresult of economies of scale achieved by the increased installation rates. \n\n12 The low interest margins that IDCOL earns in its renewable energy program are not sufficient for the company to \ncover  expenses  related  to  the  administration  and  monitoring  of  its  renewable  energy  program,  such  as:  (i) \noverhead  costs;  (ii)  salaries  and  allowances  for  IDCOL  officials  dedicated  to  the  program  and  for  its  inspectors, \nwhich  are  not  included  with  technical  inspection-related  expenses;  (iii)  financial  audits;  (iv)  committee  meeting \nexpenses; (v) promotional and logistical support; and (vi) printing and stationery. \n\n13 Technical inspection is the physical verification of SHS by technical inspectors recruited as employees by IDCOL \n\nfor this specific purpose. Their responsibility is to conduct inspections of all SHSs installed under the program. \n\n14 Technical  audits  are  conducted  by  a  third  party  appointed  by  IDCOL  on  a  competitive  basis.  Usually,  IDCOL \nconducts  technical  audits  once  a  year.  Auditors  conduct  a  detailed  technical  analysis  of  the  performance  of \ndifferent SHS components (panel, battery, charge controller, cable, and lamp) including laboratory testing of those \nitems on a random sample basis. They collect samples from the field, factory of the manufacturer, and also from \nthe participating organizations\u2019 stock. \n\n15 Independent engineers are engaged on a competitive basis to conduct feasibility studies, appraise the conceptual \nand technical design, monitor construction, and/or monitor operational performance of renewable energy projects \n(other than the solar program). \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n20. \nsummarized in Table 1. \n \n\nThe  proposed  cost  estimates  for  the  additional  SHSs  and  related  activities  are \n\nTable 1: Proposed Cost Estimates \n($) \n\n \nUnit \n\n \nTotal Costb \n\n \nTotal Costa  \n\nCost/ \nUnit \n \n \n25.00  \n \n\n \nCost Item \nBuy-down grants to individual households for the \npurchase of SHSs (through participating \norganizations) (part 1) \nDirect grants to subprojects, financed by IDCOL, \nusing renewable energy technologies (part 2) \nProgram support administration cost for IDCOL  \nParticipating organization staff and customer training \nTechnical inspections \nTechnical audits carried out by an audit firm \nIndependent engineers\u2019 costs \n \nIDCOL = Infrastructure Development Company Limited.  \na   Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, established by the Government \n\n \n580,000 \n357,000  \n233,000  \n30,000 \n60,000 \n40,000 \n1,300,000 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2,000,000 \n\n80,000 \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n2,000,000 \n \n\n4.46  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n80,000 \n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\nof Japan, and administered by the Asian Development Bank. \n\nRationale for Supplementary Grants \n\nb  Climate Change Fund, established by the Asian Development Bank. \nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding. \nSources: Infrastructure Development Company Limited data and estimates. \n \nB. \n \n21. \nThe  main  rationale  for  the  proposed  supplementary  grants  is  to  increase  the  financing \navailable to the rural poor for the purchase of an SHS which is in line with the provision of grant \nmoney  already  done  by  other  donors.  The  funds  will  subsidize  SHSs  and  other  renewable \nenergy applications in order to make them more affordable to end-users, thereby guaranteeing \nincreased  SHS  installation  rates  and  the  successful  implementation  of  alternative  energy \ngeneration  in  off-grid  areas.  This  will  assist  the  government  in  implementing  its  vision  of \nuniversal electricity access by 2020.  \n \n22. \nThe  additional  activities  under  component  C  are  consistent  with  (i)  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy and program update 2006\u20132010 for Bangladesh,16 which highlights rural electrification \nas one of the key development challenges; (ii) the original development objectives; and (iii) the \nproject\u2019s  impact,  outcomes,  and  development  effectiveness  as  well  as  the  design  and \nmonitoring framework in the Appendix. Furthermore, the renewable energy program component \ndemonstrates  satisfactory  implementation  and  is  likely  to  achieve  the  stated  development \nobjectives as highlighted in sections III C and III D on the status of IDCOL\u2019s renewable energy \nprograms. \n \nC. \n \nThe  supplementary  grants  will  (i)  provide  under  part  1  further  support  for  this  highly \n23. \nsuccessful  intervention  in  the  absence  of  sufficient  grant  funding  sources  to  achieve  the \ntargeted 2.5 million SHSs by 2014; (ii) promote clean energy technologies, which will lead to a \nreduction of greenhouse gas emissions; and (iii) contribute to poverty reduction and sustainable \ndevelopment. \n \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2005, Bangladesh: Country Strategy and Program Update, 2006\u20132010. Manila. \n\nImpact on the Project \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\n24.  With  respect  to  the  provision  of  grants  for  the  purchase  of  SHSs  under  part  1,  the \nproposed  changes  will  improve  the  access  of  low-income  households  to  clean  energy.  The \nextreme  poor  will  benefit  mostly  since  they  are  otherwise  deprived  of  access  to  reliable \nelectricity.  In  the  long  term,  a  self-sustaining  market  for  SHSs  will  be  created  in  Bangladesh, \nwhich will: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nreplace  fossil  fuel  (kerosene)  lamps  through  modern  electricity  from  renewable \nsources;  \nprovide better lighting for school children as they study in the evening;  \nprovide more security for household members, especially women and children;  \nhelp save money that is being spent on kerosene or candles; \nhelp save time needed for purchasing kerosene; and \nimprove indoor air quality and health by avoiding the burning of kerosene. \n\n \n25. \nIDCOL\u2019s  high  installation  rates  of  SHSs  and  other  renewable  energy  applications  will \nhelp  contribute  to  reduced  carbon  emissions.  IDCOL  estimates  that  each  SHS  saves  at  least \n$61.8 worth of kerosene each year, and reduces 345 kilograms of CO2 emission annually as a \nresult. Therefore, the 80,000 new SHSs to be installed through the proposed changes will bring \na  reduction  of  about  27,600  tons  of  CO2  emissions  a  year.  IDCOL  is  currently  assessing  the \ncarbon emission reductions achieved by RESs other than SHSs. \n \n26. \nThe proposed supplementary grants will facilitate additional financing of SHSs by IDCOL \nthrough the provision of 80,000 grants, thereby increasing the number of SHSs to be financed \nunder the project from the current 104,273 SHSs to at least 180,000 SHSs. As a result, IDCOL \nis more likely to meet its objective of financing 2.5 million SHSs by 2014.  \n \n27. \nCurrently,  the  overall  funding  available  to  IDCOL  is  sufficient  to  provide  financing  for \n772,321  SHSs.  In  light  of  the  current  installation  rates,  existing  funding  is  expected  to  be \ndepleted in the second quarter of 2011 and the available ADB financing under component C is \nequally expected to be fully utilized by 2011. More specifically on loan financing, IDCOL faces a \nfunding gap of roughly $408 million for the financing of approximately 1,825,000 SHSs to reach \nits goal of financing 2.5 million SHSs by 2014.  \n \n28.  Without  ADB\u2019s  proposed  grant  financing  under  part  1,  part  of  IDCOL\u2019s  SHS  program \nmay be financed without the grant element, which could cause the price of an SHS to become \nunaffordable to a large section of society, thereby leading to declining demand from customers. \nIn  addition,  customers  would  have  to  bear  administration  support  costs,  given  that  these  are \ngenerally  covered  by  grant  funding.  According  to  IDCOL\u2019s  estimates,  this  could  lead  to \nsignificantly  lower  installation  rates  and  a  customer  base  that  will  consist  primarily  of  the \nrelatively  better-off  residents  in  rural  and  urban  areas.  In  this  scenario,  IDCOL  may  miss  its \ntarget  of  installing  2.5  million  SHSs  by  2014.  Thus,  the  proposed  supplementary  funding  will \nhelp  maintain  the  current  high  installation  rate  and  assist  IDCOL  in  achieving  its  target,  while \nretaining a more inclusive customer base for SHS installations. \n \nIDCOL  has  in  its  pipeline  projects  for  other  renewable  energy  applications,  but  is  also \n29. \nshort of funding for these projects. ADB has allocated about $3 million under component C and \nthe International Development Agency has pledged loan financing of $6 million, while the Global \nEnvironment  Facility,  Global  Partnership  on  Output-Based  Aid,  and  German  development \ncooperation through KfW have contributed a total of $3.1 million in grant funding. Assuming the \nproposed  ADB  grant  financing  is  approved  under  part  2,  IDCOL  estimates  that  its  shortfall  for \ngrant financing will still be about $9.6 million and for loan financing, it will be $12 million.  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards \n\nD. \n \n30. \nEnvironmental  safeguards. The proposed project is classified as category FI. As part \nof  ADB\u2019s  earlier  assistance  under  the  original  loan,  IDCOL  has  established  an  environmental \nand social safeguards framework that will be updated to reflect the changes in connection with \nthis additional grant funding and ongoing ADB-financed capacity building efforts for the benefit \nof IDCOL\u2019s Environmental and Social Safeguards Management Unit. Given the small size and \nretail character of an SHS installation, no adverse environmental impacts are expected through \nthese  supplementary  grants.  The  only  potential  negative  environmental  impact  of  the  SHS \ndissemination  program  could  originate  from  battery-related  waste  problems.  To  limit  negative \neffects on the natural environment, IDCOL requires all participating organizations to ensure that, \nwhen batteries reach the end of their lifetime (typically 5\u20137 years), they are  collected from rural \ncustomers and returned to the battery manufacturer for recycling purposes. To assure complete \ncollection of old batteries, most participating organizations offer small amounts of money for the \nreturn of used batteries to their respective offices. IDCOL requires all battery manufacturers to \nhave  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  14001  certified  battery  recycling \nfacilities.  All  battery  manufacturers  are  in  the  process  of  obtaining  ISO  14001  certificates  in \n2011. \n \n31. \nSocial  safeguards.  The  proposed  supplementary  grants  are  classified  as  category  C. \nNo involuntary resettlement or any impact on indigenous peoples is expected as a result of this \nfinancing.  The  environmental  and  social  safeguards  framework  under  the  original  loan  will \nremain  in  place  with  respect  to  any  social  safeguard  concerns  resulting  from  this  additional \ngrant funding. \n \nE. \n \n32. \nThe cost estimates for the installation of SHSs have not changed and remain dependent \non  market  prices  and  the  institutional  capacity  of  IDCOL  and  participating  organizations  to \nreduce their operational costs.  \n \n33. \nThe original financing plan will be marginally changed since the proposed supplementary \ngrants  will  only  impact  component  C  of  PPIDF  which  will  provide  financing  for  renewable \nsubprojects.  The  project  will  complement  the  grant  funding  sources  available  to  IDCOL  for  its \nrenewable  energy  program  and  will,  therefore,  have  a  positive  effect  on  component  C.
