The  major  change  in  scope  entails  (i)  changes  in  the  eligibility  criteria  for  partner \nfinancial institutions (PFIs), (ii) expansion of the products to be guaranteed and/or risk participated \non an unfunded basis, and (iii) extension of the permissible tenor of the credit enhancement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) under the program to a maximum of 5 years. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nGlobally, about 2 billion low-income adults lack access to finance and are excluded from \nthe  formal  finance  sector.1  Lower-income  people  find  it  difficult  to  borrow  from  formal  lending \nsources  for  various  reasons,  including  small  loan  amounts,  lack  of  proper  identification,  and \nabsence of a credit history and collateral. Microfinance has been a critical tool in addressing this \nmarket gap and reducing poverty by providing financial services to low-income people, particularly \nwomen. However, microfinance institutions (MFIs) and other institutions that cater to this market \nsegment struggle to obtain sufficient commercial funding, particularly in local currency, to meet \nthe demands of their clients. \n \nTo  address this  market gap,  in 2010  the  ADB  Board of  Directors  approved  up  to $250 \n3. \nmillion to support the microfinance sector in ADB developing member countries (DMCs) through \nthe program,2 which is implemented through unfunded risk participations and guarantees. PFIs \nprovide local currency loans, with a maximum tenor of 3 years, to ADB-approved MFIs in ADB \nDMCs, thereby catalyzing private sector participation and mobilizing additional funds for the MFIs \nto onlend to low-income populations.3 The program onboarded the first PFI in 2012. As of June \n2017, the program has accredited two global financial institutions (Standard Chartered Bank and \nCitibank NA) and four local Indian institutions (IFMR Capital Finance Private Limited, RBL Bank \nLimited, Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited, and IndusInd Bank Limited). \n \n4. \nThe program currently supports 20 MFIs in Bangladesh, India, and Indonesia. Based on \nthe outstanding portfolio as of June 2017, 75% of exposure is in India, which has large unmet \ndemand for access to finance and a favorable operating environment. Based on the program\u2019s \nsuccess  and  increased  market  demand,  on  26  October  2015  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  (i) \nremoved the program\u2019s expiration date, thus including it in ADB\u2019s mainstream operations; and (ii) \nincreased the overall limit to $240 million.4 Key achievements are summarized in the table. \n \n\n                                                \n1  World Bank.

The Board initially approved the program for 5 years (i.e., until 13 December 2015). \n3  Through a minor change in scope approved on 6 May 2011, ADB expanded the program to include the issuance of \n\nguarantees. \n\n4  ADB.  2015.  Major  Change  and  Additional  Financing:  Microfinance  Risk  Participation  and  Guarantee  Program. \nManila. ADB reduced the program\u2019s overall size to $190 million in October 2012 to provide headroom for anticipated \ntransactions by ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable 1: Program Highlights (December 2010\u2013June 2017) \n\nAchievements \n\nNew loans supported \nCofinancing \nNumber of microfinance institutions funded \nBorrowers supported \nGender \nNumber of partner financial institutions \nDefault or guarantee claims \n Source: Asian Development Bank. \n\nStatus \n\n$534.97 million \n$283.43 million \n27 \n3.05 million  \nMore than 90% women clients \nTwo international, four Indian \nNone \n\n \n5. \nOne  of  the  program\u2019s  strongest  attributes  is  its  ability  to  support  MFIs  through  various \nstages of growth. ADB implemented the program in India shortly after the 2010 Andhra Pradesh \nmicrofinance  crisis,  which  tightened  market  liquidity.5  Importantly,  the  program  mobilized \ncommercial  financing  during  this  critical  period  by  sharing  credit  risk.  Since  2010,  and  with \nsubstantial improvements in regulation in India and the introduction of financial inclusion policies \nsome MFIs have grown significantly, and are now converting into small finance banks and exiting \nthe program. Several of these larger MFIs and small finance banks are now being funded directly \nby ADB outside of the program through long-term debt and equity.6 Given these developments, \nthe program has shifted to supporting small and medium-sized MFIs that cover more differentiated \nand unbanked locations in India. Although Bangladesh\u2019s microfinance sector is large, and there \nis  considerable  unmet  demand  for  financing,  program  implementation  has  been  slower  than \nexpected.  ADB  is  addressing  MFI  needs through  one  PFI  and  seeking opportunities to further \nexpand the program. Program implementation has also proven to be challenging in Indonesia, \ngiven  the  fragmented  market  composed  of  various  rural  banks,  a  few  large  microfinance \ninstitutions, and small cooperatives. Program PFIs have been selective in providing MFI loans, \nwith  low  exposure  to  date.  Given  market  dynamics,  it  is  unclear  if  exposure  will  increase \nsignificantly. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nSeveral lessons have emerged from the program\u2019s operational period and observations \nof  market  evolution  and  innovation,  particularly  in  India.  Knowledge  gained  since  program \ninception and from the performance of the MFIs involved in the program indicates that while the \nprogram structure performed well in markets such as India, innovating and expanding to other \nmarkets with differing levels of maturity will require applying other strategies and structures. \n \n7. \nKey  market  developments.  The  microfinance  sector  across  Asia  and  the  Pacific  is \ndiverse with differing levels of maturity. Different types of institutions provide financial services to \nlow-income people,  including  nongovernment  organizations,  MFIs,  and banks.7  In India,  larger \nMFIs  are  starting  to  access  capital  markets,  with  credit  enhancements  to  improve  ratings  and \n\nLessons  \n\n                                                \n5   Andhra Pradesh was a microfinance pioneer in India and the largest Indian MFI market in 2010. Rapid market growth \nand rising borrower over-indebtedness preceded the crisis. Concerns about the ability of low-income borrowers to \nservice  mounting  debts  led  the  state  government  to  introduce  the  Andhra  Pradesh  Microfinance  Institutions \n(Regulation of Money Lending) Bill in October 2010, which affected the collection of existing loans by  MFIs. The \nAndhra Pradesh crisis led to several regulatory reforms and operational improvements. \n\n6   ADB. 2016.

ADB  can  play  an  important  role  in \nsupporting some of these small, newer MFIs.  In contrast to MFIs in Myanmar, where the sector \nis still nascent, MFIs struggle to receive even basic term loan facilities. MFIs in some countries \nnow provide a range of financial products\u2014with longer tenors\u2014to meet the changing demands \nof  micro  borrowers  for  housing,  agriculture,  microenterprise,  green  finance,  9  and  savings  and \ninsurance. There has been a shift from joint liability group lending to individual lending products \nthat are often collateralized and have larger loan sizes, which is a typical sign of maturing clients.10 \nIn Bangladesh, for instance, individuals and micro and small enterprises now comprise about 25% \nof the total portfolios, indicating a clear shift in lending models. There has also been growth in \nmicrofinance lending through banks due to revised strategies or government requirements (e.g., \nin India).11   \n \n8. \nKey operational lessons. ADB program parameters need to be broadened to address \nthe changing landscape, including (i) new product structures that would enable ADB to support \nMFIs without PFIs and (ii) an increase in tenor. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n9. \nThe assistance consists of (i) additional financing to raise the program limit by up to $100 \nmillion to $340 million and (ii) an expansion in program scope (para. 1). This will support, at any \ntime  and  on  a  revolving  basis,  up  to  $680  million  of  outstanding  loans  to  low-income  groups, \nassuming ADB guarantees the default risk of up to 50% of the exposure on PFIs and/or MFIs.12 \n \nB. \n \n\nProposed Additional Financing and Change in Scope \n\n1. \n\nAdditional Financing \n\n \n10. \nPFI limits are linked to the overall program limit, and provision of additional financing of up \nto $100 million as proposed in the change in scope will enable accreditation of more PFIs and \nsupport program growth and expansion. Access to financial services remains problematic across \nmost ADB DMCs. Despite rapid progress in the rate of financial inclusion in markets such as India, \nthe  demand  for  financing  throughout  the  region  remains  vast,  especially  for  local  currency \nfinancing.13  The  estimated  annual  demand for  households in  Indian  rural  and  urban areas, for \n\n                                                \n8  In 2016, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed foreign portfolio institutions to invest in unsecured corporate debt \nand  securitized  debt  instruments  by  financial  institutions  in  India.  This  change  supports  the  expansion  of  capital \nmarket  instruments  and  the  diversification  of  funding  for  this  asset  class.  RBI.

Each \ngroup was self-selected with 5\u201310 members who would guarantee for each other if a member was unable to repay \nthe loan. The social guarantee worked well for small loan amounts. This joint liability group model was significantly \nrefined over time and in some markets, with individual lending introduced as clients matured. \n\n11 In India, RBI obligates commercial banks to lend at least 40% of their previous year\u2019s adjusted net bank credit to \nspecified  priority  sectors,  focusing  on  underserved  and  rural  borrowers.

Hailey,  D.  Brassel,  and  U.  Janett.  2016.  Micro  and  SME  Finance  Market  Outlook  2017:  A  Survey.  Zurich: \n\nresponsAbility Investments AG. SME stands for small and medium-sized enterprise. \n\n \n\n\fexample, is $36 billion.14 Bangladesh estimates a yearly unmet demand of $5 billion, Pakistan a \ndemand of $3 billion until 2020, and in Myanmar, a yearly demand of at least $1 billion (footnote \n8). This is evidenced by the low percentage of the population that has accessed credit through \nformal channels in India (approximately 15.71% of men and 11.42% of women), or has borrowed \nmoney from a financial institution (9.8% women and 10% men, in Bangladesh, 11.8% of women \nand 19.5% of men in Myanmar, and 0.3% of women and 2.6% of men in Pakistan).15 The program \nwill expand to countries with clear unmet financing demand and interest from PFIs to provide local \ncurrency  loans  to  MFIs.  Further  considerations  for  country  expansion  are  the  size  and \nperformance of the microfinance sector, and the existence of a supportive enabling environment \n(regulatory and ancillary institutions). Target markets in the near to midterm include Myanmar, \nPakistan, and Sri Lanka. \n \n\n2. \n\nChange in Scope \n\n \n11. \nPartner  financial  institution  eligibility  criteria.  The  types  of  financial  institutions  that \nprovide financing to MFIs has expanded and the entities have established track records. Changes \nto the PFI eligibility criteria are needed to include nonbank financial institutions and other licensed \ninstitutions that have (i) at least 5 years of experience in lending to MFIs and (ii) a loan portfolio \nof at least $250 million. \n \n12. \n\nExpansion of guarantee and risk participation products to include:  \n\n(i) \n\n \nGuarantee  and/or  risk  participation  in  a  partner  financial  institution\u2019s \nmicrofinance  portfolio.  ADB  guarantees  or  participates  in  the  default  risk  of  a \nPFI\u2019s wholesale lending to a particular MFI and establishes a credit limit for each \nparticipating  MFI.  However,  in  some  countries  (e.g.,  India)  loans  of  microfinance \nborrowers  (which  are  often  originated  by  MFIs  used  as  agents)  are  pooled.16 \nExisting and potential new PFI and MFI program partners have requested that ADB \nguarantee or participate in these pooled microfinance loans. It is proposed that ADB \npartially guarantee or risk participate in up to 50% of pooled microfinance loans on \nthe balance sheet of a PFI, thus reducing the risk profile of those assets for the PFI \nand encouraging further lending to the sector. This portfolio guarantee and/or risk \nparticipation  will  be  done  on  a  pilot  basis  with  existing  accredited  PFIs  and  is \nexpected to be used initially in India.17  \n \n\n(ii)  Guarantee  and/or  risk  participation  directly  to  microfinance  institutions \nwithout the participation of a partner financial institution. For countries where \nADB  does  not  have  an  accredited  PFI,  it  is  proposed  that  a  stand-alone  partial \nguarantee  and/or  risk  participation  for  approved  MFIs  be  incorporated  into  the \nprogram so that MFIs could obtain a bank loan. ADB would share up to 50% of the \n\n                                                \n14 Bharat Financial Inclusion Ltd. 2016. Annual Report 2016: Most Efficient MFI on the Globe. http://www.bfil.co.in/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2016/07/SKS.Annual.Report.2016.pdf, ($ 36 million = Rs 2.4 trillion, $1: Rs66.2031 as of 31 March \n2016) \n\n15 World  Bank.  Gender  Statistics  Databank.  http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=gender-\n\nstatistics#selectedDimension_GS_Ctry (accessed 20 September 2017). \n\n16 In India, banks also use MFIs as agents or business correspondents to originate and monitor the loan portfolio against \nspecifically defined business correspondent banking guidelines. PFIs also purchase pools of microfinance loans from \nother  banks,  which  then  form part of the  PFI\u2019s microfinance  portfolio, to  meet priority  sector  lending  targets.  The \nperformance of microfinance loans\u2014whether originated through such business correspondents, purchased by the \nPFI, or originated by the PFI itself\u2014compares well with MFIs\u2019 own balance sheet portfolio. \n\n17 A loan portfolio guarantee would guarantee against losses from a portfolio of loans made by a PFI to a target borrower \n\nsegment for which the parameters have been predefined, but the individual borrowers are not known. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\ndefault  risk  on  a  pari  passu  basis  with  the  lending  bank.  In  addition  to  sharing \nexposure with ADB, ADB\u2019s guarantee will seek to crowd in private sector banks that \notherwise  might  not  consider  lending  to  this  asset  class.  ADB  will  apply  specific \neligibility criteria for these MFIs and adjust the due diligence process  \n \n\n(iii)  Guarantee and/or risk participation for capital market instruments issued by \nmicrofinance institutions. The program has successfully nurtured smaller MFIs, \nas  illustrated  in  several  instances  in  India.  Medium-sized  MFIs  are  expected  to \naccess the capital markets to reduce their dependency on commercial borrowing, \nand  most  if  not  all  will  find  it  challenging  to  execute  transactions,  such  as  local \ncurrency  bond  issuances  or  securitizations,  as  a  result  of  a  lack  of  or  low  credit \nratings.  To  address  this  situation,  ADB  would  offer  partial  credit  guarantees  on \nbonds issued by MFIs through a debenture trustee and on securitizations to support \nMFI access to diversified funding in the capital markets. \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n \nBond issuance. For bond issuances, 18 ADB would take credit exposure \non the MFI issuing the bond. Under the proposed change in scope, ADB \nwould initially cooperate with a known arranger  or co-guarantor, such as \nIFMR Capital,19 and guarantee up to 50% of the principal bond amount.20 \nBond  issuances  typically  have  a  tenor  of  3\u20135  years,  and  ADB\u2019s  credit \nenhancements would thus need to be able to cover this period.21 \nSecuritization.  For  securitizations\u2014where  a  pool  of  microfinance  loans \nwill be sold without recourse to investors22\u2014under the proposed change in \nscope ADB would partially guarantee and/or risk participate in the junior or \nsenior notes portion of the securitization structure held by an arranger or \naccredited PFI. This option would require that ADB guarantee and/or risk \nshare  a  portion  of  a  specific  MFI  loan  portfolio,  essentially  providing  a \nportfolio guarantee. \n\n \n13. \nADB will not take the first-loss position when providing the partial credit guarantees or risk \nparticipations in these instruments. Demand for partial credit guarantees is largely in India, but \nthese offerings could be expanded elsewhere as capital markets develop in the region. \n \n14. \nExtension of tenor to up to 5 years. Under the proposed change in scope, the maximum \nloan  tenor  that  ADB  will  guarantee  or  risk  participate  in would  be  extended from  3  to  5  years. \nProducts with longer tenors include home improvement loans, with an average tenor of 3 years; \nand bond issuances, with a tenor of 5 years. ADB will limit exposure above 3 to 5 years to not \n\n                                                \n18 These are secured by 100% receivables. \n19 IFMR Capital is a key program PFI and partner since 2011. It has mobilized $4.5 billion in debt capital for MFIs in \nIndia to date. The company lends to MFIs itself, structures and arranges capital market transactions for the sector, \nand takes exposure on junior tranches. It works directly with 35 MFIs and has gathered extensive data and knowledge \non the sector. \n\n20 Selective partial guarantees for bond issuances can be without a co-guarantor. \n21 RBI.

PFIs  are  selected  against  approved  criteria  and  follow  a \nprescribed accreditation and due diligence process. After onboarding the MFIs and determining \nthe respective approval limit, ADB participates in the credit risk of the loan by the PFIs to MFIs, \nup to the agreed limit.23 The following processes would apply to the suggested changes to the \nguarantees and risk participation products: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \nPortfolio guarantee.

The  existing  accreditation,  onboarding,  and  limit  approval \nprocess will also apply to the credit enhancements of MFI bond issuances. ADB \nwill work with an experienced arranger or the PFI; depending on the structure, the \nrisk may be shared between the PFI and ADB, with ADB guaranteeing up to 50% \nof the bond issuance. ADB will work only with experienced arrangers. \nSecuritization. To partially guarantee junior or senior notes  under a securitization \nstructure, ADB will establish a portfolio limit for this specific structure under the MFI \numbrella or PFI limit, with any losses shared between the PFI and ADB. ADB will \nalso work with an arranger. \n\n \n16. \nAs one MFI may avail of several guarantee types, ADB will establish an umbrella limit for \neach MFI for better monitoring.

The  terms  of  the  risk  participation  or \nguarantee agreements with a PFI, an MFI, or a bond issuer will require the PFI, the MFI, or the \nbond  issuer  to  submit  financial  and  other  reports  at  predetermined  regular  intervals  and  as \nrequested,  including  (i)  annual  review  reports  with  audited  financial  statements;  (ii)  quarterly \ncompliance  certificates  for  financial  covenants  or  operational  highlights,  if  requested;  and  (iii) \nquarterly reporting on the microfinance loan portfolios. ADB will conduct an annual review of the \nPFIs and the MFIs under the program following the relevant staff instruction, and will monitor the \nuse of limits by each PFI and MFI monthly. \n \n18. \nResource requirements. The expansion will require additional resources to handle the \nexpansion  with  increase  in  volume  and  monitoring,  with  specific  expertise  required  for  certain \naspects  of  capital  market  transactions.  A  separate  technical  assistance  (TA)  program  will  be \nprepared to provide the required consulting inputs, with an estimated cost of up to $1 million over \na 3-year period. \n \nD. \n \n19. \nSupport  access  to  finance  for  low-income  and  women  borrowers.  There  is  a \nsignificant gap  in the  supply  of  and demand for financial  services for  people with  low-incomes \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n                                                \n23 In the case of stand-alone guarantees for MFIs, ADB will sign separate agreements with the MFI and the lender. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\n(para  10),  including  financial  products  for  income-generating  activities,  low-cost  affordable \nhousing,  and green finance. Through  broadened  parameters  of the  program,  ADB  will  support \nnew financial products aimed at the bottom of the pyramid segment. Women are one of the most \nvulnerable groups in the world\u2019s poorest populations, and a significant number remain unbanked. \nThe  program  will  continue  to  support  MFIs  and  their  clients,  most  of  whom  are  women,  and \ncontinue  a  TA  program  for  Indian  MFIs  on  responsible  finance  practices,  including  gender-\nfocused  consumer  protection  principles.24  Under  a  new  TA  program,  which  will  be  approved \nseparately, ADB will work with PFIs and/or MFIs to provide gender-focused activities, including \nfinancial literacy training and implementation of gender-focused policies. \n \n20. \nProvide  access  to  local  currency  and  support  capital  markets  development. \nCommercial banks are often not comfortable or familiar with this asset class, and their strategies \ndo not include catering to this lower-income market segment. Many MFIs in other DMCs are much \nsmaller  and  less  mature  than  those  in  India.  Banks  often  face  restrictions  on  capital  and \ncounterparty  lines  that  limit  their  possible  lending  volumes  to  MFIs.  The  program  can  help \novercome these limitations and will continue to expand its operations into new countries, making \nadditional local currency lending available to MFIs, which will in turn increase access to finance \nfor low-income populations. \n \n21. \nThe program will also support growth of capital markets and familiarity with the MFI asset \nclass. Diversified funding sources are essential for MFIs, which are usually restricted from taking \ndeposits. Most capital markets in ADB DMCs lack depth and are illiquid beyond the highest-rated \nissuances. ADB\u2019s credit enhancement will facilitate issuance of capital markets instruments by \nMFIs and widen the set of investors, particularly from the private sector. \n \n22. \nCatalyze private sector financing. Through ADB\u2019s partial guarantee or risk participation, \nprivate  sector  involvement  in  microfinance  sector  financing  has  been  and  will  continue  to  be \nfacilitated.  The  growth  of  the  microfinance  sector  has  generated  increased  interest  from  more \nprivate sector financial institutions, but risk sharing through multiple product structures is needed \nto encourage their entry into and growth in the sector. \n \nE. \n \n23. \nThe  2010  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  and  the  2015  major  change  in \nscope  and  additional  financing  for  this  program  addressed  key  risk  issues,  such  as  the \ncreditworthiness  of  the  underlying  MFIs  and  their  loan  portfolio,  the  performance  and  credit \nunderwriting skills of the PFIs, regulatory and reputation risk, geographical concentration risks, \nforeign currency risk. The proposed changes do not aim to dilute the principles of (i) working with \nPFIs  or  other  partners  that  have  capital  exposed  in  the  same  transactions  as  ADB,  and  have \ninterests  aligned  with  ADB;  and  (ii)  partnering with  institutions  with  on-the-ground  capability  to \nmonitor MFIs, and augment ADB\u2019s due diligence capability and quality. The identified risks remain \nvalid but have been updated, for example foreign currency risk as guaranteed loans, bonds, or \nother instruments are denominated in local currency and if an MFI defaults, ADB will be liable to \npay in United States dollars or local currency (if available). When a claim is paid in dollars, ADB \nwill continue to have a claim in local currency under the original guaranteed loan, bond or other \ninstruments.  The  2010  Board  approval  allowed  this  to  reduce  the  financing  cost  for  MFIs  by \neliminating foreign exchange hedging costs (footnote 2).  \n \n\nRisks \n\n                                                \n24 ADB  2016.  Technical  Assistance  to  India  for  Strengthening  Financial  Inclusion  through  Responsible  Finance \n\nPractices. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f24. \n\nThe following additional risks have also been identified: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \nCapital  market  instrument  and  portfolio  risk.  These  risks  are  related  to  the \nstructuring documentation and evaluation of the instruments, the assessment of \nthe  underlying  MFIs,  and  portfolio  credit  risks.  ADB  will  address  these  risks  by \nworking with experienced arrangers and PFIs with strong underwriting standards \nand by determining specific portfolios based on predefined parameters. \nInterest rate volatility risk. In limited cases, for example a bond guarantee with \nfloating  interest  rates,  ADB  will  be  exposed  to  interest  rate  volatility.  All  issuers \nmust have an appropriate interest rate hedging strategy in place to work with ADB \nin any of these structures. \nStand-alone guarantee risk. The credit risk of an MFI will be assessed by on-site \ndue diligence conducted by ADB, with certain additional eligibility criteria to be met \nbefore  the  MFI  could  be  supported  (e.g.,  an  external  rating  requirement). \nMonitoring will be done by the lending bank. \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Output \n\n \nA. \n \nImpact.  Strengthen  the  capacity  of  domestic  financial  institutions  to  encourage  and \n25. \nexpand  access  to banking,  insurance,  and financial  services for  all.25  This  will  be  achieved  by \nincreasing  the  amount  of  inclusive finance  available  in  ADB  DMCs,  covering  a  wider  range  of \nfinancial products for different purposes. \n \n26. \nOutcome.  Sustainable financial  inclusion  increased.  Through  a  combination  of  funding \ninstruments, partners will receive more financing for lending to the target population, and PFIs will \nbe more comfortable to lend directly to this market segment. Success in achieving the outcome \nwill be measured in terms of the increase in partners\u2019 loan portfolios, maintenance of the average \nnonperforming loan ratio, the increase in the aggregate number of ultimate borrowers. \n \n27. \nOutput. Availability of financial services for the low-income population increased. This will \nbe measured based on the increase in ADB\u2019s guarantee and risk participation volume and the \nexpansion of the program to two more countries. \n \n28. \n \nB. \n \n29. \nConsistency with  ADB  strategy  and country  strategy.  Finance  sector  development, \npoverty  reduction  and  inclusive  economic  growth  form  part  of  ADB\u2019s  10  strategic  priorities  set \nforth in the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.26 In its approach to inclusive economic growth, ADB \nwill emphasize inclusive finance by improving and expanding access to finance for the low-income \npopulation  and  for  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises.  The  expansion  of  access  to \nfinance  for  poor  women  supports  the  ADB  Gender  Equality  and  Women\u2019s  Empowerment \nOperational Plan, 2013\u20132020.27 \n                                                \n25 United  Nations  Sustainable  Development  Knowledge  Platform.

Manila. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\n \n30. \nConsistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. Inclusive finance is \none of the three pillars of ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational Plan, which was re-affirmed in its \n2017  review.28  One  component  of  the  strategic  focus  of  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment is to mobilize third-party capital credit through credit enhancement products and risk \ntransfer agreements. The program facilitates this by encouraging the private sector contribution \nto MFI financing. ADB\u2019s sovereign operations has also implemented programs to strengthen the \nenabling  environment  for  inclusive  finance  through  sector  development  programs  and  TA. \nNonsovereign and sovereign operations collaborate in countries such as Myanmar, where there \nare specific challenges in the market. \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \nThe program will continue to be classified category FI treated as C under ADB\u2019s Safeguard \n31. \nPolicy  Statement  (2009). The  business  activities  of  the  PFIs  and  MFIs  are anticipated  to  have \nminimal or no adverse environmental impacts, and are unlikely to entail impacts on involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples. The PFIs will apply ADB's prohibited investment activities \nlist  and  screening  checklist  to  exclude  projects  that  are  likely  to  be  classified  Category  A  or \nCategory B for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.29 All PFIs and \nMFIs will abide by applicable national laws and regulations, comply with national labor laws, and, \npursuant  to  the  ADB  Social  Protection  Strategy  (2001),  comply  with  internationally  recognized \ncore  labor  standards.  The  PFIs  will  review  the  MFIs  annually  and  will  include  in  their  regular \nreporting information to ADB (i) the nature of subprojects and categorization, (ii) compliance with \nsafeguards and social requirements, and (iii) compliance with applicable national and international \nlaws and standards.30 The program is classified some gender elements and will target lending to \nwomen borrowers both by number and share in the loan portfolio and report this to ADB. Each \nPFI, MFI, and co-guarantor that joins the program is subject to separate due diligence to confirm \ncompliance with ADB policies. \n \nB. \n \n32. \nAll  PFIs  have been  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing best  international  practice \nrelating  to  combating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.31  ADB  will \nensure that the risk participation or guarantee documentation includes (i) appropriate provisions \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism; and (ii) remedies for ADB \nin the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n \n33. \nsingle-investment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \n\nThe proposed additional financing is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n                                                \n28 ADB. 2017.
