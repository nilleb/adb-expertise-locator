I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on additional financing \nof up to $100,000,000 for guarantee and unfunded risk participation products offered by the \nMicrofinance  Risk  Participation  and  Guarantee  Program  to  support  (i)  expansion  into  new \ncountries and (ii) a major change in scope to broaden product offerings and facilitate market \ninnovation. The major change in scope entails (i) changes in the eligibility criteria for partner \nfinancial institutions (PFIs), (ii) expansion of the products to be guaranteed and/or risk participated \non an unfunded basis, and (iii) extension of the permissible tenor of the credit enhancement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) under the program to a maximum of 5 years. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Background \n \n2.  Globally, about 2 billion low-income adults lack access to finance and are excluded from \nthe formal finance sector.1 Lower-income people find it difficult to borrow from formal lending \nsources for various reasons, including small loan amounts, lack of proper identification, and \nabsence of a credit history and collateral. Microfinance has been a critical tool in addressing this \nmarket gap and reducing poverty by providing financial services to low-income people, particularly \nwomen. However, microfinance institutions (MFIs) and other institutions that cater to this market \nsegment struggle to obtain sufficient commercial funding, particularly in local currency, to meet \nthe demands of their clients. \n \n3.  To address this market gap, in 2010 the ADB Board of Directors approved up to $250 \nmillion to support the microfinance sector in ADB developing member countries (DMCs) through \nthe program,2 which is implemented through unfunded risk participations and guarantees. PFIs \nprovide local currency loans, with a maximum tenor of 3 years, to ADB-approved MFIs in ADB \nDMCs, thereby catalyzing private sector participation and mobilizing additional funds for the MFIs \nto onlend to low-income populations.3 The program onboarded the first PFI in 2012. As of June \n2017, the program has accredited two global financial institutions (Standard Chartered Bank and \nCitibank NA) and four local Indian institutions (IFMR Capital Finance Private Limited, RBL Bank \nLimited, Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited, and IndusInd Bank Limited). \n \n4.  The program currently supports 20 MFIs in Bangladesh, India, and Indonesia. Based on \nthe outstanding portfolio as of June 2017, 75% of exposure is in India, which has large unmet \ndemand for access to finance and a favorable operating environment. Based on the program\u2019s \nsuccess and increased market demand, on 26 October 2015 the ADB Board of Directors (i) \nremoved the program\u2019s expiration date, thus including it in ADB\u2019s mainstream operations; and (ii) \nincreased the overall limit to $240 million.4 Key achievements are summarized in the table. \n \n                                                \n1  World Bank. Global Financial Inclusion Database. http:databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=1228 \n(accessed 20 September 2017). \n2  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Microfinance Risk \nParticipation Program. Manila. The Board initially approved the program for 5 years (i.e., until 13 December 2015). \n3  Through a minor change in scope approved on 6 May 2011, ADB expanded the program to include the issuance of \nguarantees. \n4  ADB. 2015. Major Change and Additional Financing: Microfinance Risk Participation and Guarantee Program. \nManila. ADB reduced the program\u2019s overall size to $190 million in October 2012 to provide headroom for anticipated \ntransactions by ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department. \n ", "2 \nTable 1: Program Highlights (December 2010\u2013June 2017) \nAchievements  Status \nNew loans supported  $534.97 million \nCofinancing  $283.43 million \nNumber of microfinance institutions funded  27 \nBorrowers supported  3.05 million  \nGender  More than 90% women clients \nNumber of partner financial institutions  Two international, four Indian \nDefault or guarantee claims  None \n Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \n5.  One of the program\u2019s strongest attributes is its ability to support MFIs through various \nstages of growth. ADB implemented the program in India shortly after the 2010 Andhra Pradesh \nmicrofinance  crisis,  which  tightened  market  liquidity.5  Importantly,  the  program  mobilized \ncommercial financing during this critical period by sharing credit risk. Since 2010, and with \nsubstantial improvements in regulation in India and the introduction of financial inclusion policies \nsome MFIs have grown significantly, and are now converting into small finance banks and exiting \nthe program. Several of these larger MFIs and small finance banks are now being funded directly \nby ADB outside of the program through long-term debt and equity.6 Given these developments, \nthe program has shifted to supporting small and medium-sized MFIs that cover more differentiated \nand unbanked locations in India. Although Bangladesh\u2019s microfinance sector is large, and there \nis considerable unmet demand for financing, program implementation has been slower than \nexpected. ADB is addressing MFI needs through one PFI and seeking opportunities to further \nexpand the program. Program implementation has also proven to be challenging in Indonesia, \ngiven  the  fragmented  market  composed  of  various  rural  banks,  a  few  large  microfinance \ninstitutions, and small cooperatives. Program PFIs have been selective in providing MFI loans, \nwith  low  exposure to  date. Given  market  dynamics,  it  is  unclear  if  exposure  will  increase \nsignificantly. \n \nB.  Lessons  \n \n6.  Several lessons have emerged from the program\u2019s operational period and observations \nof market  evolution  and  innovation,  particularly  in  India.  Knowledge  gained  since  program \ninception and from the performance of the MFIs involved in the program indicates that while the \nprogram structure performed well in markets such as India, innovating and expanding to other \nmarkets with differing levels of maturity will require applying other strategies and structures. \n \n7.  Key market developments. The microfinance sector across Asia and the Pacific is \ndiverse with differing levels of maturity. Different types of institutions provide financial services to \nlow-income people, including nongovernment organizations, MFIs, and banks.7 In India, larger \nMFIs are starting to access capital markets, with credit enhancements to improve ratings and \n                                                \n5  Andhra Pradesh was a microfinance pioneer in India and the largest Indian MFI market in 2010. Rapid market growth \nand rising borrower over-indebtedness preceded the crisis. Concerns about the ability of low-income borrowers to \nservice mounting debts led the state government to introduce the Andhra Pradesh Microfinance Institutions \n(Regulation of Money Lending) Bill in October 2010, which affected the collection of existing loans by MFIs. The \nAndhra Pradesh crisis led to several regulatory reforms and operational improvements. \n6  ADB. 2016.

ADB can play an important role in \nsupporting some of these small, newer MFIs.  In contrast to MFIs in Myanmar, where the sector \nis still nascent, MFIs struggle to receive even basic term loan facilities. MFIs in some countries \nnow provide a range of financial products\u2014with longer tenors\u2014to meet the changing demands \nof micro borrowers for housing, agriculture, microenterprise, green finance, 9 and savings and \ninsurance. There has been a shift from joint liability group lending to individual lending products \nthat are often collateralized and have larger loan sizes, which is a typical sign of maturing clients.10 \nIn Bangladesh, for instance, individuals and micro and small enterprises now comprise about 25% \nof the total portfolios, indicating a clear shift in lending models. There has also been growth in \nmicrofinance lending through banks due to revised strategies or government requirements (e.g., \nin India).11   \n \n8.  Key operational lessons. ADB program parameters need to be broadened to address \nthe changing landscape, including (i) new product structures that would enable ADB to support \nMFIs without PFIs and (ii) an increase in tenor. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n9.  The assistance consists of (i) additional financing to raise the program limit by up to $100 \nmillion to $340 million and (ii) an expansion in program scope (para. 1). This will support, at any \ntime and on a revolving basis, up to $680 million of outstanding loans to low-income groups, \nassuming ADB guarantees the default risk of up to 50% of the exposure on PFIs and/or MFIs.12 \n \nB.  Proposed Additional Financing and Change in Scope \n \n1.  Additional Financing \n \n10.  PFI limits are linked to the overall program limit, and provision of additional financing of up \nto $100 million as proposed in the change in scope will enable accreditation of more PFIs and \nsupport program growth and expansion. Access to financial services remains problematic across \nmost ADB DMCs. Despite rapid progress in the rate of financial inclusion in markets such as India, \nthe demand for financing throughout the region remains vast, especially for local currency \nfinancing.13 The estimated annual demand for households in Indian rural and urban areas, for \n                                                \n8  In 2016, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed foreign portfolio institutions to invest in unsecured corporate debt \nand securitized debt instruments by financial institutions in India. This change supports the expansion of capital \nmarket instruments and the diversification of funding for this asset class. RBI.

Each \ngroup was self-selected with 5\u201310 members who would guarantee for each other if a member was unable to repay \nthe loan. The social guarantee worked well for small loan amounts. This joint liability group model was significantly \nrefined over time and in some markets, with individual lending introduced as clients matured. \n11 In India, RBI obligates commercial banks to lend at least 40% of their previous year\u2019s adjusted net bank credit to \nspecified priority sectors, focusing on underserved and rural borrowers.

Hailey, D. Brassel, and U. Janett. 2016. Micro and SME Finance Market Outlook 2017: A Survey. Zurich: \nresponsAbility Investments AG. SME stands for small and medium-sized enterprise. \n ", "4 \nexample, is $36 billion.14 Bangladesh estimates a yearly unmet demand of $5 billion, Pakistan a \ndemand of $3 billion until 2020, and in Myanmar, a yearly demand of at least $1 billion (footnote \n8). This is evidenced by the low percentage of the population that has accessed credit through \nformal channels in India (approximately 15.71% of men and 11.42% of women), or has borrowed \nmoney from a financial institution (9.8% women and 10% men, in Bangladesh, 11.8% of women \nand 19.5% of men in Myanmar, and 0.3% of women and 2.6% of men in Pakistan).15 The program \nwill expand to countries with clear unmet financing demand and interest from PFIs to provide local \ncurrency  loans  to  MFIs.  Further  considerations  for  country  expansion  are  the  size  and \nperformance of the microfinance sector, and the existence of a supportive enabling environment \n(regulatory and ancillary institutions). Target markets in the near to midterm include Myanmar, \nPakistan, and Sri Lanka. \n \n2.  Change in Scope \n \n11.  Partner financial institution eligibility criteria. The types of financial institutions that \nprovide financing to MFIs has expanded and the entities have established track records. Changes \nto the PFI eligibility criteria are needed to include nonbank financial institutions and other licensed \ninstitutions that have (i) at least 5 years of experience in lending to MFIs and (ii) a loan portfolio \nof at least $250 million. \n \n12.  Expansion of guarantee and risk participation products to include:  \n \n(i)  Guarantee  and/or  risk  participation  in  a  partner  financial  institution\u2019s \nmicrofinance portfolio. ADB guarantees or participates in the default risk of a \nPFI\u2019s wholesale lending to a particular MFI and establishes a credit limit for each \nparticipating MFI. However, in some countries (e.g., India) loans of microfinance \nborrowers (which are often originated by MFIs used as agents) are pooled.16 \nExisting and potential new PFI and MFI program partners have requested that ADB \nguarantee or participate in these pooled microfinance loans. It is proposed that ADB \npartially guarantee or risk participate in up to 50% of pooled microfinance loans on \nthe balance sheet of a PFI, thus reducing the risk profile of those assets for the PFI \nand encouraging further lending to the sector. This portfolio guarantee and/or risk \nparticipation will be done on a pilot basis with existing accredited PFIs and is \nexpected to be used initially in India.17  \n \n(ii)  Guarantee  and/or  risk  participation  directly  to  microfinance  institutions \nwithout the participation of a partner financial institution. For countries where \nADB does not have an accredited PFI, it is proposed that a stand-alone partial \nguarantee and/or risk participation for approved MFIs be incorporated into the \nprogram so that MFIs could obtain a bank loan. ADB would share up to 50% of the \n                                                \n14 Bharat Financial Inclusion Ltd. 2016. Annual Report 2016: Most Efficient MFI on the Globe. http://www.bfil.co.in/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2016/07/SKS.Annual.Report.2016.pdf, ($ 36 million = Rs 2.4 trillion, $1: Rs66.2031 as of 31 March \n2016) \n15 World  Bank.  Gender  Statistics  Databank.  http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=gender-\nstatistics#selectedDimension_GS_Ctry (accessed 20 September 2017). \n16 In India, banks also use MFIs as agents or business correspondents to originate and monitor the loan portfolio against \nspecifically defined business correspondent banking guidelines. PFIs also purchase pools of microfinance loans from \nother banks, which then form part of the PFI\u2019s microfinance portfolio, to meet priority sector lending targets. The \nperformance of microfinance loans\u2014whether originated through such business correspondents, purchased by the \nPFI, or originated by the PFI itself\u2014compares well with MFIs\u2019 own balance sheet portfolio. \n17 A loan portfolio guarantee would guarantee against losses from a portfolio of loans made by a PFI to a target borrower \nsegment for which the parameters have been predefined, but the individual borrowers are not known. \n ", "5 \ndefault risk on a pari passu basis with the lending bank. In addition to sharing \nexposure with ADB, ADB\u2019s guarantee will seek to crowd in private sector banks that \notherwise might not consider lending to this asset class. ADB will apply specific \neligibility criteria for these MFIs and adjust the due diligence process  \n \n(iii)  Guarantee and/or risk participation for capital market instruments issued by \nmicrofinance institutions. The program has successfully nurtured smaller MFIs, \nas illustrated in several instances in India. Medium-sized MFIs are expected to \naccess the capital markets to reduce their dependency on commercial borrowing, \nand most if not all will find it challenging to execute transactions, such as local \ncurrency bond issuances or securitizations, as a result of a lack of or low credit \nratings. To address this situation, ADB would offer partial credit guarantees on \nbonds issued by MFIs through a debenture trustee and on securitizations to support \nMFI access to diversified funding in the capital markets. \n \n(a)  Bond issuance. For bond issuances, 18 ADB would take credit exposure \non the MFI issuing the bond. Under the proposed change in scope, ADB \nwould initially cooperate with a known arranger or co-guarantor, such as \nIFMR Capital,19 and guarantee up to 50% of the principal bond amount.20 \nBond issuances typically have a tenor of 3\u20135 years, and ADB\u2019s credit \nenhancements would thus need to be able to cover this period.21 \n(b)  Securitization. For securitizations\u2014where a pool of microfinance loans \nwill be sold without recourse to investors22\u2014under the proposed change in \nscope ADB would partially guarantee and/or risk participate in the junior or \nsenior notes portion of the securitization structure held by an arranger or \naccredited PFI. This option would require that ADB guarantee and/or risk \nshare a portion of a specific MFI loan portfolio, essentially providing a \nportfolio guarantee. \n \n13.  ADB will not take the first-loss position when providing the partial credit guarantees or risk \nparticipations in these instruments. Demand for partial credit guarantees is largely in India, but \nthese offerings could be expanded elsewhere as capital markets develop in the region. \n \n14.  Extension of tenor to up to 5 years. Under the proposed change in scope, the maximum \nloan tenor that ADB will guarantee or risk participate in would be extended from 3 to 5 years. \nProducts with longer tenors include home improvement loans, with an average tenor of 3 years; \nand bond issuances, with a tenor of 5 years. ADB will limit exposure above 3 to 5 years to not \n                                                \n18 These are secured by 100% receivables. \n19 IFMR Capital is a key program PFI and partner since 2011. It has mobilized $4.5 billion in debt capital for MFIs in \nIndia to date. The company lends to MFIs itself, structures and arranges capital market transactions for the sector, \nand takes exposure on junior tranches. It works directly with 35 MFIs and has gathered extensive data and knowledge \non the sector. \n20 Selective partial guarantees for bond issuances can be without a co-guarantor. \n21 RBI. Notifications. Master Direction\u2014External Commercial Borrowings, Trade Credit, Borrowing and Lending in \nForeign  Currency  by  Authorised  Dealers  and  Persons  other  than  Authorised  Dealers. \nhttps://rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Mode=0&Id=10204#C81. As an offshore entity ADB is subject to RBI\u2019s \ndirective on external commercial borrowings, and credit enhancements need to have a minimum average maturity \nof 3 years. \n22 Securitization is the financial practice of pooling various types of contractual debt, such as microfinance loans, and \nselling their related cash flows to third-party investors as securities. It is the process by which assets are sold to a \nbankruptcy remote special purpose vehicle in return for an immediate cash payment. The cash flow from the \nunderlying assets is used to service the securities issued by the special purpose vehicle. \n ", "6 \nmore than 10% of the overall program amount. Furthermore, long tenor products will be limited to \nthose MFIs with which ADB has an existing relationship. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  Under the existing program, ADB signs risk participation and partial credit guarantee \nagreements with accredited PFIs. PFIs are selected against approved criteria and follow a \nprescribed accreditation and due diligence process. After onboarding the MFIs and determining \nthe respective approval limit, ADB participates in the credit risk of the loan by the PFIs to MFIs, \nup to the agreed limit.23 The following processes would apply to the suggested changes to the \nguarantees and risk participation products: \n \n(i)  Portfolio guarantee. ADB will establish a separate obligor limit for an accredited \nPFI to guarantee part of its microfinance portfolio, and establish a portfolio limit for \nthis specific structure under the PFI limit, with any losses shared between the PFI \nand ADB. \n(ii)  Bond  issuance.  The  existing  accreditation,  onboarding,  and  limit  approval \nprocess will also apply to the credit enhancements of MFI bond issuances. ADB \nwill work with an experienced arranger or the PFI; depending on the structure, the \nrisk may be shared between the PFI and ADB, with ADB guaranteeing up to 50% \nof the bond issuance. ADB will work only with experienced arrangers. \n(iii)  Securitization. To partially guarantee junior or senior notes  under a securitization \nstructure, ADB will establish a portfolio limit for this specific structure under the MFI \numbrella or PFI limit, with any losses shared between the PFI and ADB. ADB will \nalso work with an arranger. \n \n16.  As one MFI may avail of several guarantee types, ADB will establish an umbrella limit for \neach MFI for better monitoring. The program team will monitor the limits established with respect \nto the proposed new products, the umbrella limit, and the allocation. \n \n17.  Reporting  and  monitoring  arrangements.  The  terms  of  the  risk  participation  or \nguarantee agreements with a PFI, an MFI, or a bond issuer will require the PFI, the MFI, or the \nbond issuer to submit financial and other reports at predetermined regular intervals and as \nrequested, including (i) annual review reports with audited financial statements; (ii) quarterly \ncompliance certificates for financial covenants or operational highlights, if requested; and (iii) \nquarterly reporting on the microfinance loan portfolios. ADB will conduct an annual review of the \nPFIs and the MFIs under the program following the relevant staff instruction, and will monitor the \nuse of limits by each PFI and MFI monthly. \n \n18.  Resource requirements. The expansion will require additional resources to handle the \nexpansion with increase in volume and monitoring, with specific expertise required for certain \naspects of capital market transactions. A separate technical assistance (TA) program will be \nprepared to provide the required consulting inputs, with an estimated cost of up to $1 million over \na 3-year period. \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n19.  Support  access  to  finance  for  low-income  and  women  borrowers.  There  is  a \nsignificant gap in the supply of and demand for financial services for people with low-incomes \n                                                \n23 In the case of stand-alone guarantees for MFIs, ADB will sign separate agreements with the MFI and the lender. \n ", "7 \n(para  10),  including  financial  products  for  income-generating  activities,  low-cost  affordable \nhousing, and green finance. Through broadened parameters of the program, ADB will support \nnew financial products aimed at the bottom of the pyramid segment. Women are one of the most \nvulnerable groups in the world\u2019s poorest populations, and a significant number remain unbanked. \nThe program will continue to support MFIs and their clients, most of whom are women, and \ncontinue a TA program for Indian MFIs on responsible finance practices, including gender-\nfocused consumer protection principles.24 Under a new TA program, which will be approved \nseparately, ADB will work with PFIs and/or MFIs to provide gender-focused activities, including \nfinancial literacy training and implementation of gender-focused policies. \n \n20.  Provide  access  to  local  currency  and  support  capital  markets  development. \nCommercial banks are often not comfortable or familiar with this asset class, and their strategies \ndo not include catering to this lower-income market segment. Many MFIs in other DMCs are much \nsmaller  and  less mature  than  those  in India. Banks  often face  restrictions  on  capital  and \ncounterparty lines that limit their possible lending volumes to MFIs. The program can help \novercome these limitations and will continue to expand its operations into new countries, making \nadditional local currency lending available to MFIs, which will in turn increase access to finance \nfor low-income populations. \n \n21.  The program will also support growth of capital markets and familiarity with the MFI asset \nclass. Diversified funding sources are essential for MFIs, which are usually restricted from taking \ndeposits. Most capital markets in ADB DMCs lack depth and are illiquid beyond the highest-rated \nissuances. ADB\u2019s credit enhancement will facilitate issuance of capital markets instruments by \nMFIs and widen the set of investors, particularly from the private sector. \n \n22.  Catalyze private sector financing. Through ADB\u2019s partial guarantee or risk participation, \nprivate sector involvement in microfinance sector financing has been and will continue to be \nfacilitated. The growth of the microfinance sector has generated increased interest from more \nprivate sector financial institutions, but risk sharing through multiple product structures is needed \nto encourage their entry into and growth in the sector. \n \nE.  Risks \n \n23.  The 2010 report and recommendation of the President and the 2015 major change in \nscope  and  additional  financing  for  this  program  addressed  key  risk  issues,  such  as  the \ncreditworthiness of the underlying MFIs and their loan portfolio, the performance and credit \nunderwriting skills of the PFIs, regulatory and reputation risk, geographical concentration risks, \nforeign currency risk. The proposed changes do not aim to dilute the principles of (i) working with \nPFIs or other partners that have capital exposed in the same transactions as ADB, and have \ninterests aligned with ADB; and (ii) partnering with institutions with on-the-ground capability to \nmonitor MFIs, and augment ADB\u2019s due diligence capability and quality. The identified risks remain \nvalid but have been updated, for example foreign currency risk as guaranteed loans, bonds, or \nother instruments are denominated in local currency and if an MFI defaults, ADB will be liable to \npay in United States dollars or local currency (if available). When a claim is paid in dollars, ADB \nwill continue to have a claim in local currency under the original guaranteed loan, bond or other \ninstruments. The 2010 Board approval allowed this to reduce the financing cost for MFIs by \neliminating foreign exchange hedging costs (footnote 2).  \n \n                                                \n24 ADB 2016.

The following additional risks have also been identified: \n \n(i)  Capital market instrument and portfolio risk. These risks are related to the \nstructuring documentation and evaluation of the instruments, the assessment of \nthe underlying MFIs, and portfolio credit risks. ADB will address these risks by \nworking with experienced arrangers and PFIs with strong underwriting standards \nand by determining specific portfolios based on predefined parameters. \n(ii)  Interest rate volatility risk. In limited cases, for example a bond guarantee with \nfloating interest rates, ADB will be exposed to interest rate volatility. All issuers \nmust have an appropriate interest rate hedging strategy in place to work with ADB \nin any of these structures. \n(iii)  Stand-alone guarantee risk. The credit risk of an MFI will be assessed by on-site \ndue diligence conducted by ADB, with certain additional eligibility criteria to be met \nbefore  the  MFI  could  be  supported  (e.g.,  an  external  rating  requirement). \nMonitoring will be done by the lending bank. \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Output \n \n25.  Impact. Strengthen the capacity of domestic financial institutions to encourage and \nexpand access to banking, insurance, and financial services for all.25 This will be achieved by \nincreasing the amount of inclusive finance available in ADB DMCs, covering a wider range of \nfinancial products for different purposes. \n \n26.  Outcome. Sustainable financial inclusion increased. Through a combination of funding \ninstruments, partners will receive more financing for lending to the target population, and PFIs will \nbe more comfortable to lend directly to this market segment. Success in achieving the outcome \nwill be measured in terms of the increase in partners\u2019 loan portfolios, maintenance of the average \nnonperforming loan ratio, the increase in the aggregate number of ultimate borrowers. \n \n27.  Output. Availability of financial services for the low-income population increased. This will \nbe measured based on the increase in ADB\u2019s guarantee and risk participation volume and the \nexpansion of the program to two more countries. \n \n28.  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n29.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. Finance sector development, \npoverty reduction and inclusive economic growth form part of ADB\u2019s 10 strategic priorities set \nforth in the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.26 In its approach to inclusive economic growth, ADB \nwill emphasize inclusive finance by improving and expanding access to finance for the low-income \npopulation and for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. The expansion of access to \nfinance  for  poor  women  supports  the  ADB  Gender  Equality  and  Women\u2019s  Empowerment \nOperational Plan, 2013\u20132020.27 \n                                                \n25 United  Nations  Sustainable  Development  Knowledge  Platform.

Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. Inclusive finance is \none of the three pillars of ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational Plan, which was re-affirmed in its \n2017  review.28  One  component  of  the  strategic  focus  of  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment is to mobilize third-party capital credit through credit enhancement products and risk \ntransfer agreements. The program facilitates this by encouraging the private sector contribution \nto MFI financing. ADB\u2019s sovereign operations has also implemented programs to strengthen the \nenabling  environment  for  inclusive  finance  through  sector  development  programs  and  TA. \nNonsovereign and sovereign operations collaborate in countries such as Myanmar, where there \nare specific challenges in the market. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n31.  The program will continue to be classified category FI treated as C under ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). The business activities of the PFIs and MFIs are anticipated to have \nminimal or no adverse environmental impacts, and are unlikely to entail impacts on involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples. The PFIs will apply ADB's prohibited investment activities \nlist and screening checklist to exclude projects that are likely to be classified Category A or \nCategory B for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.29 All PFIs and \nMFIs will abide by applicable national laws and regulations, comply with national labor laws, and, \npursuant to the ADB Social Protection Strategy (2001), comply with internationally recognized \ncore labor standards. The PFIs will review the MFIs annually and will include in their regular \nreporting information to ADB (i) the nature of subprojects and categorization, (ii) compliance with \nsafeguards and social requirements, and (iii) compliance with applicable national and international \nlaws and standards.30 The program is classified some gender elements and will target lending to \nwomen borrowers both by number and share in the loan portfolio and report this to ADB. Each \nPFI, MFI, and co-guarantor that joins the program is subject to separate due diligence to confirm \ncompliance with ADB policies. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n32.  All PFIs have been advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism.31 ADB will \nensure that the risk participation or guarantee documentation includes (i) appropriate provisions \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism; and (ii) remedies for ADB \nin the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n33.  The proposed additional financing is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \nsingle-investment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \n                                                \n28 ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n29 MFIs benefiting from a stand-alone guarantee will apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list and screening \nchecklist to exclude subprojects that are likely to be classified Category A or Category B for the environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n30 In the case of MFIs benefiting from a stand-alone guarantee, ADB will conduct an annual review. \n31 This includes MFIs benefiting from a stand-alone guarantee. \n ", "10 \nD.  Assurances \n \n34.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),32 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that participating governments \nthat have yet to declare no objection to the proposed assistance will be asked to do so before the \nprogram is implemented in their country. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in \nform and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the \nBoard of Directors. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed additional financing would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve (i) the \nadditional financing of up to $100,000,000 in guarantee and unfunded risk participation products \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and (ii) the major change in scope as described in paras. \n11\u201314, for the Microfinance Risk Participation and Guarantee Program with such terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be \nreported to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n 8 November 2017 \n                                                \n32 ADB. 1966.
