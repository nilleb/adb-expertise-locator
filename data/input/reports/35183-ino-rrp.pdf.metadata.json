An initial environmental examination was undertaken. \nThe summary of findings is a core appendix.  \n \nThe  Project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  program  to  promote \nsustainable  and  community-managed  freshwater,  brackishwater \nand  marine  aquaculture  development  to  reduce  poverty  and \nincrease the food supply among poor fish-farming communities. It \nwill  focus  on  the  development  of  small-scale  and  low-cost \naquaculture production systems that are economically sound and \nenvironment  friendly,  and  that  can  be  easily  replicated  by  fish \nto  medium-scale  private \nfarmers  organizations  and  small- \nentrepreneurs.  The  Project  will  provide  technical  and  extension \nsupport  to  fish  farmers  in  order  to  ensure  successful  project \nimplementation. Such support will include innovative mechanisms \nto  assist  organized  fish  farmer  groups  with  securing  production \ninputs and marketing their final product. The Project will build the \ncapacity of the Directorate General of Aquaculture (DGA) and the \nparticipating  district  governments \nformulate  policies  and \nfor  sustainable  aquaculture  development  and \nregulations \nenvironmental  management,  and  to  support  the  needs  of  the \nbeneficiaries,  their  communities,  and  the  country\u2019s  aquaculture \nindustry as a whole. \n \nThe Project will be implemented in five districts in four provinces: \nnamely:  (i)  Langkat  in  North  Sumatera  Province,  (ii)  Ogan \nKomering  Ilir  (OKI)  in  South  Sumatera  Province,  (iii)  Karawang \nand  Sumedang  in  West  Java  Province,  and  (iv)  Buton  in \nSoutheast Sulawesi Province. \n \nAquaculture  has  been  playing  an  increasingly  significant  role  in \nfood  security, \nIndonesia\u2019s  economy  providing  household \ngenerating  valuable  foreign  exchange  and  domestic  revenues, \nboosting  international  trade  in  fish  and  aquatic  products,  and \nimproving  the  living  standards  of  poor  rural  communities  in \nIndonesia. It has been accepted as a viable alternative livelihood  \nfor  fisherfolks  engaged  in  open  sea  fishing  and  can  help  reduce \npressure on marine and coastal resources including the depleting \nfish  stock,  degrading \nfish  habitats  and  declining  marine \nbiodiversity. \n \n \n\nto \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nAllocation and On-\ngranting Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n\ninputs;  (v) \n\nHowever,  the  subsector  is  confronted  with  numerous  problems \nthat  need  to  be  addressed  urgently.  These  problems  include  (i) \nlow  growth  and  productivity  resulting  from  poor  fish-farming \nsystems  and  lack  of  good  quality  fish  and  shrimp  seed;  (ii) \nenvironmental  degradation  and  pollution  resulting  from  poor  fish-\nfarm  management and technology; (iii) lack and inaccessibility of \ncredit  for  poor  or  small-scale  fish  farmers;  (iv)  high  costs  of \nimported  production \nlack  of  social  preparation, \ninefficient  extension  services,  and  post-production  facilities  and \nmarketing  infrastructure;  and  (vi)  user  conflicts  in  open  water \nareas  among  fish  farmers  and  other  users.  All  these  problems \nhave been acting as deterrents to aquaculture by small-scale fish \nfarmers. \n \nThe  expected  impact  is  reduced  poverty  and  increased  food \nsecurity among Project beneficiaries. The outcome of the Project \nwill  be  sustainable  increase  in  fish  production  in  the  five  project \ndistricts.  \n \nThe investment cost of the project is estimated at $44.52 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $3.92 million.  \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  equivalent  to  $33.3 \nmillion  from  the  Special  Funds  resources  (ADF)  to  help  finance \nthe Project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, an interest charge of 1.00% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. The loan \nwill finance 75% of the total project cost. The remaining balance \nof  $11.22  million  equivalent  (about  25%  of  the  project  cost) will \nbe  funded  by  the  national  and  district  governments  and  project \nbeneficiaries. \n\n \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nNational and District \nGovernments \nBeneficiaries \n\nTotal \n   33.30 \n8.46 \n\n2.76 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n% \n74.8 \n19.0 \n\n6.2 \n\n100.00 \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n   44.52 \n\n    Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nThe  proceeds  of  ADB\u2019s  loan  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  will  be \navailable  to  DGA  and  district  governments  through  budgetary \nappropriations  on  an  on-grant  basis  in  accordance  with  the \nMinistry  of  Finance  Decree  No.  35/2003  and  the  Ministry  of \nFinance Regulation No. 129/PMK.07/2005.   \n \nUntil 31 December 2013 \n \n30 June 2013 \n\n\fiii \n\nof \n\ncoordination \n\ncapacity-building \n\nin  each  project  province \n\n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  a  decentralized  framework  in \nline  the  Government\u2019s  policies  and  regulations.

The  following  measures  should \nhelp minimize these risks: (i) strong commitment and involvement \nfrom  MMAF  and  DGA  management  to  support  the  Project  and \noversee  project  implementation;  (ii)  effective  capacity  building  at \ngovernment  institutions  and  community  levels;  (iii)  adoption  of  a \n\u201clearning  approach\u201d  to  project  implementation,  whereby  relatively \nnew  technologies  will  be  demonstrated  and  pilot-tested  prior  to \nfull-scale  implementation;  (iv)  the  establishment  of  linkages  and \nthe  fostering  of  close  working  relationships  among  fish  farmers \norganizations, extension staff, participating rural communities, and \nthe  private  sector;  (v)  design  and  implementation  of  an  effective \nmonitoring  and  reporting  system,  with  a  view  toward  obtaining \nprompt  feedback  and  enabling  timely  action;  (vi)  improved  \ntransparency  and  accountability  through  participating  project \nmanagement  at  the  national,  regional  and  field  levels;  and  (vii) \nstrong ownership of the Project by various stakeholders. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Sustainable  Aquaculture  Development  for  Food  Security \nand Poverty Reduction Project.1 The Design and Monitoring Framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nThe Indonesian marine and fisheries sector, which includes aquaculture, plays a major \nrole  in  the  national  economy,  contributing  25\u201330%  of  the  country\u2019s  gross  domestic  product. \nGross  output  value  from  fisheries  in  2005  was estimated  at  about  $6.3  billion,  or  about  5%  of \nthe output of the agriculture sector and 3% of the output of the entire economy. Indonesia is the \nninth largest fish producer and the tenth largest fish exporter in the world. From 1994\u20132005, fish \nproduction  increased  by  an  average  4.8%  per  year,  from  4.01  million  tons  (t)  in  1994  to  an \nestimated  6.6  million  t  in  2005,  with  66%  of  the  production  coming  from  capture  fisheries  and \nthe  balance  (34%)  from  aquaculture.  Export  revenues  reached  $1.68  billion  in  1998  and  were \nestimated at $1.91 billion in 2005. The country\u2019s exports of fish and aquatic products consist of \nshrimp, skipjack and Eastern little tuna, and other fish and aquatic species such as grouper, red \ntilapia, abalone, seaweeds, sea cucumber, pearls, and other mollusks. \n \n3. \nFish is a staple food item in the diet of Indonesian families, providing about two-thirds of \nthe total domestic animal protein supply. Among the different sources of animal protein, fish is \nstill  relatively  inexpensive  and  is,  thus,  the  main  source  of  protein  for  the  poor.  Fish  has  also \nbecome increasingly popular as a food item among higher income consumers as a result of its \npublicized health benefits. Per capita fish consumption in the country nearly doubled from a low \nof 12.8 kg/yr in 1982 to an estimated 22.67 kg/yr in 2005. From 1994\u20132005, average per capita \nfish consumption increased by about 2.67% per year. However, current per capita consumption \nis  still  lower  than  the  per  capita  animal  protein  requirement  of  26.55  kg  recommended  by  the \nFood and Nutrition Study.2  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nSector Opportunities and Issues \n\nIndonesia  has  an  abundance  of  freshwater,  brackishwater,  and  marine  resources  with \n4. \npotential for aquaculture development. It has a large variety of cultivable fish and other aquatic \nspecies  and  the  available  technology  for  aquaculture  in  fresh,  brackish,  and  marine \nenvironments.  It  has  about  26  million  ha  of  coastal/marine  and  freshwater  areas  suitable  for \naquaculture,  of  which  only  about  680,000  ha,  representing  less  than  3%  of  the  total  potential \narea,  are  currently  utilized  for  production.  Production  from  aquaculture  has  increased \ndramatically  since  the  late  1980s,  with  current  figures  for  the  major  commodities  (shrimp, \nmilkfish, tilapia, and carp) being at least double and at most four times 1988 levels. In 2005, the \ntotal  aquaculture  output  of  about  2.1  million  t  was  about  20%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  fish \nproduction. In the same year, fish and aquatic products generated combined foreign exchange \nearnings of over $2.1 billion. \n                                                 \n1   The Project was prepared under ADB 2003. Technical Assistance to the Government of Indonesia for Sustainable \n\nAquaculture Development for Food Security and Poverty Reduction. Manila (TA 4148-INO). \n\n2   Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries. 2003. Annual Report of the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries for the \n\nYear 2002.Jakarta. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nAquaculture has, therefore, been playing an increasingly significant role in ensuring food \n5. \navailability,  providing  household  food  security,  generating  valuable  foreign  exchange  and \ndomestic  revenues,  boosting  exports  of  fish  and  aquatic  products,  and  improving  the  living \nstandards  of  poor  rural  communities  in  Indonesia.  Besides  contributing  almost  one-quarter  of \nthe country\u2019s estimated total fish production, the aquaculture subsector provides employment to \nsome  2.5  million  people,  which  is  about  40%  of  the  total  number  of  people  employed  in  the \nfisheries sector. Aquaculture has absorbed much of the country's growing labor force, even if it \ndoes not generally pay well. Therefore, it has cushioned the economic hardship faced by people \nlooking for means of livelihood to support their families. \n \n6. \nAs  Indonesia's  growing  population  demand  more  fish  and  fish  products,  particularly  in \nrural  areas,  and  as  production  from  artisanal  capture  fisheries  is  maintained  at  sustainable \nlevels, aquaculture is seen as an alternative source of high-quality animal protein and livelihood, \nespecially for lower income groups. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has projected \nthat  aquaculture  may  soon  surpass  marine  capture  fisheries  in  providing  high-quality  animal \nprotein, employment, and export earnings. \n \n7. \nHowever,  the  Indonesian  aquaculture  subsector  is  characterized  by  a  number  of \nproblems that need to be addressed to sustain production levels. These problems include (i) low \ngrowth  and  productivity  resulting  from  poor  fish-farming  systems  and  lack  of  quality  fish  and \nshrimp  seed;  (ii)  environmental  degradation  and  pollution  resulting  from  poor  fish-farm \nmanagement  and  technology;  (iii)  lack  and  inaccessibility  of  credit  for  poor  or  small-scale  fish \nfarmers;  (iv)  high  costs  of  imported  production  inputs;  (v)  absence  of  social  preparation, \ninefficient extension services, and lack of post-production facilities and marketing infrastructure, \nparticularly for use by small farmers; and (v) conflicts in water use in open water areas between \nfish farmers and other users. \n \n8. \nThe  industry  suffers  from  low  productivity  as  a  result  of  technical,  economic,  and \nenvironmental  factors.  Small-scale  fish  farmers  usually  practice  extensive  culture  using  low-\nyielding, low-input, and low-level technology, and lack the technical know-how or skills to adopt \nnew  or  improved  production  methods,  techniques,  and  farming  systems.  Their  problems  are \ncompounded,  in  some  areas,  by  the  occurrence  of  fish  or  shrimp  disease,  which  in  turn  is \nusually  triggered  by  poor  environmental  quality,  pollution,  inferior  seed  quality,  and/or  poor \nhatchery and culture management. Small-scale fish farmers also lack the funds required to shift \nto  higher-density  farming  or  higher-value  commodities.  Moreover,  problems  associated  with \npoor aquaculture system management have contributed to the image of aquaculture as a high-\nrisk  industry,  making  financial  institutions  reluctant  to  provide  credit  to  meet  the  production \nneeds  of  small-scale  fish  farmers,  who  must  therefore  rely  on  their  own  labor  and  meager \nfinancial resources for their subsistence culture operations. \n \nThe various problems outlined above have resulted in low incomes, poor quality of life, \n9. \nand high incidence of poverty among small-scale fish farmers. Their incomes fall way below the \nnational average and they have limited or no access to basic social infrastructure facilities and \nservices such as health, education, water supply and sanitation, transport, and communication. \nAs a result, literacy levels are low, mortality and morbidity rates are high, and more than one-\nthird of open sea fisherfolk and fish farmers live below the poverty line. \n \n10. \nLaw  32/2004  on  Regional  Government,  which  broadened  the  authority  of  regional \ngovernments, called for the devolution of fisheries management responsibilities from the central \ngovernment  to  the  provincial  and  district  governments.  This  has  various  implications  on  the \naquaculture  sector.  First,  there  remains  much  ambiguity  in  the  definition  of  roles  and \n\n\f3 \n\n \n\nresponsibilities  of  central,  provincial,  and  district  governments,  particularly  concerning  marine \nand  coastal  management.  Second,  the  responsibility  for  aquaculture  development  and  spatial \nplanning  for  aquaculture  activities  now  lies  with  the  district  governments,  except  when  foreign \ninvestments are involved, in which case DGA\u2019s review and recommendations are required prior \nto  approval  by  the  provincial  and  district  governments  concerned.  Finally,  while  the  central \ngovernment  retains  the  responsibility  for  formulating  the  criteria  for  determining  and  changing \nthe land use of areas designated for aquaculture, it is now the district governments that make \nthe  final  decision  on  whether  or  not  to  consider  such criteria  in  the  preparation  of  their  spatial \nplans. The district governments now have the main responsibility for aquaculture development, \nand DGA\u2019s role has been limited to formulating sector policies, defining technical guidelines for \naquaculture  development,  setting  directions  for  aquaculture  research  and  development,  and \nendorsing local government projects for external funding.  \n \n11. \nThe  provincial  and  district  governments,  now  charged  with  providing  extension  support \nto fish farmers and handling a range of technical responsibilities, lack the capacity (in terms of \nknowledge,  skills,  and  resources)  to  adequately  perform  these  tasks.  They  need  to  receive \ncapacity-building  and  logistical  support  to  develop  general  policies  and  regulations  for \nsustainable  aquaculture  development,  develop  and  deliver  extension  services  to  fish  farmers, \nimprove  marketing  facilities  and  information  for  small-scale  fish  farmers,  and  create  an \ninvestment environment conducive to private sector investment in aquaculture. \n \n12. \n \n\nA detailed analysis of the sector is given in Appendix 2. \n\n2. \n\nExternal Assistance to Aquaculture Development  \n\n13.  Many  agencies  and  organizations  have  provided  technical  and  financial  assistance  for \naquaculture development in Indonesia in the last 20 years. These include ADB, FAO, Australian \nCenter for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), Network of Aquaculture Centers in Asia \n(NACA),  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  Japan  International  Corporation \nAgency (JICA), and the World Bank. \n \n14. \nADB  has  been  the  lead  agency  in  providing  much-needed  support  for  fisheries  and \naquaculture development. Since 1972, when it approved its first fisheries loan to the Indonesian \nGovernment, ADB has provided more than $648 million in loans and technical assistance grants \nto the fisheries sector (Appendix 3). Since 1982, ADB has financed eight projects that support \naquaculture development in Indonesia. Four projects,3 each implemented before 1997, focused \nmainly on the development of brackishwater shrimp culture, mainly for export.  \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB.  1982.

MMAF\u2019s  Rencana  Strategis  (2005\u20132008)  provides  for  the  sustainable  utilization  and \nmanagement  of  the  country\u2019s  marine  and  fisheries  resources  and  the  improvement  of  the \nsocioeconomic  condition  of  coastal  and  inland  communities.  In  the  aquaculture  subsector,  the \ngoal  is  development  of  competitive,  fair,  economically  viable,  and  sustainable  aquaculture \nenterprises.  More  specifically,  aquaculture  development  will  be  geared  toward  responsible, \nenvironment-friendly,  and  technology-based  aquaculture,  resulting  in  increased  fish  supply  for \ndomestic consumption, industrial use, and export, as well as improved welfare of fish farmers.  \n \nThe Government proposes to support aquaculture development through various means, \n17. \nin  particular  (i)  increasing  production  and/or  yield  through  intensification,  diversification,  or \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB.  1997.

Considerable  resources  are  required  to  implement  the  broad  range  of \ninterventions covering physical investments and capacity building. \n \n\n5. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Objectives and Strategies \n\nADB\u2019s  country  operational  strategy  for  Indonesia5 has  two  strategic  priorities:  pro-poor, \n18. \nsustainable  economic  growth;  and  social  development.  ADB  will  help  the  Government  raise \nlevels  of  economic  growth  and  social  development  by  catalyzing  public  and  private  sector \ninvestments, equitable fiscal decentralization, policy and institutional reforms, natural resources \nmanagement,  and  capacity  development.  In  the  agriculture  and  natural  resources  sector,  the \nstrategic  thrust  in  the  short-  to  medium-term  will  focus  on  growth  in  rural  economy  and \nmanagement  of  natural  resources  in  sustainable  manner,  with  the  specific  aim  to  include  the \npoor and disadvantaged section of the community as the target beneficiary, whenever possible.    \n \nThe  proposed  project  is  a  part  of  fishery  subsector  of  the  agriculture  and  natural \n19. \nresources  sector.  According  to  the  priority  classification  of  sectors/subsectors  under  ADB\u2019s \nMedium-Term Strategy II, the fishery belongs to Group III subsectors future ADB operations in \nwhich will be based on specific demand for assistance. In the world\u2019s largest archipelagic nation \nlike Indonesia, the fishery subsector has an important role in the overall economy and the well \nbeing of the 5 million fisherfolk and fish farmers. Fish is a staple in the Indonesian diet, providing \ntwo-thirds  of  the  total  animal  protein  intake.  However,  a  combination  of  complex  factors \nincluding  the  open  access  to  seas,  over  fishing  and  destructive  fishing,  and  weak  law \nenforcement have seriously affected coastal fish stock and threatened Indonesia\u2019s rich marine \nbiodiversity. The declining fish stock has reduced the fisherfolk\u2019s income levels, and the coastal \nfishing communities are among the poorest segments of society in the country.  \n \n 20.  Aquaculture  has  been  established  as  a  viable  alternative  livelihood  for  fisherfolk  which \ncould reduce pressure on marine and coastal resources, help conserve marine biodiversity, and \nmake  substantial  improvements  in  fisherfolk\u2019s  income  levels.  With  proven  technologies  that \nhave been adapted locally and 25 million hectare suitable area available for it, aquaculture has \nimmense potentials for contributing to the growth of rural economy, enhancing food security and \nreducing poverty. The proposed project forms part of the Government  program for harnessing \nthe aquaculture development potentials in the country and has been included in the Indonesia \nCountry Strategy and Program 2006-2009.  The Project will be complementary to the ongoing \nADB-funded Marine and Coastal Resource Management Project6 and Coral Reef Rehabilitation \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB.2006.

The  expected  outcomes  are \nproduction of fish and other aquatic products, and improved income, nutrition, and employment \nstatus of poor fish farmers and coastal communities. \n \nThe Project will be implemented in five districts of four provinces, namely: (i) Langkat in \n22. \nNorth  Sumatera  Province;  (ii)  Ogan  Komering  Ilir  (OKI)  in  South  Sumatera  Province;  (iii) \nKarawang  and  Sumedang  in  West  Java  Province;  and  (iv)  Buton  in  Southeast  Sulawesi \nProvince.  The  districts  meet  the  following  selection  criteria:  (i)  they  have  good  potential  for \nfurther  resource  development  and  are  in  need  of  improved  aquaculture  systems  to  raise \nproductivity  and  protect  the  environment;  (ii)  they  exhibit  high  poverty  incidence  among  the \nagricultural  population; 8  (iii)  the  district  government  is  committed  to  improving  aquaculture \nproduction and socioeconomic conditions for fish farmers; and (iv) the limited financial capacity \nof  the  district  government  constrains  further  investment  in  aquaculture.  Within  each  district, \nspecific  villages  and  fish  farmers  to  participate  in  the  project  will  be  identified  during  project \nimplementation.  The  criteria  for  selection  of  subproject  sites  and  beneficiaries  are  outlined  in \nAppendix 5. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nAquaculture Production Enhancement \n\n23. \nThe  Project  will  comprise  three  components,  namely:  (i)  aquaculture  production \nenhancement,  (ii)  aquaculture  support  services,  and  (iii)  institutional  strengthening  and  project \nmanagement. \n \n \n \n24. \nThis core component of the Project will aim at improving the production performance of \nthe  major  types  of  aquaculture  systems  in  the  project  area  through  community-based \nmanagement.  Market-driven,  sustainable  aquaculture  development  will  be  made  possible \nthrough (i) social preparation and community empowerment; (ii) fish production enhancement in \nfreshwater, brackishwater, and mariculture systems; and (iii) community-based management of \nculture-based fisheries. \n \n \nSocial  Preparation  and  Community  Empowerment.  A  social  preparation  will  be \n25. \nundertaken  to  facilitate  the  formation  of  fish  farmers  organizations  and  the  training  of  their \nmembers \nrelated \nmicroenterprises.  To  be  undertaken  with  the  assistance  of  nongovernment  organizations \ninvolve  conducting \n(NGOs)  and  community-based  organizations  (CBOs),  activities  will \nparticipatory  needs  assessments  in  order  to  identify  key  problems  of  the  communities  and \ndetermine  potential  solutions.  Needs  assessments  will  be  done  though  poverty  mapping, \n\nthe  establishment  and  management  of  aquaculture-based  or \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n7 ADB.  2002.

Training  will  also  include  modules  on  nutrition,  child  care,  and  family  financial \nmanagement.  To  enhance  the  poverty-reduction  objective  of  the  Project,  disadvantaged \ncommunities  will  be  provided  with  some  basic  social  infrastructure  (e.g.,  community  water \nsupply  facilities  and  village  pathways).  These  social  infrastructure  facilities  will  complement \naquaculture development and income-generating interventions.  \n \n26. \nFish Production Enhancement. The Project will improve the production performance of \nthe  major  aquaculture  systems  in  the  project  area  by  rehabilitating  key  public  aquaculture \nsystem  facilities  and  access  roads  to  these  facilities.  Organized  fish  farmers  will  be  actively \ninvolved  in  rehabilitation  works  through  the  provision  of  in-kind  labor.  Sustainable  aquaculture \nproduction  will  be  carried  out  by  fish  farmers  organizations  in  freshwater,  brackishwater,  and \nmarine environments using various fish, shrimp, mollusc, and seaweed species, and will cover \nthe entire range of activities from broodstock development to fry/fingerling rearing and growout. \nProposed  production-oriented  activities  under  the  Project  are  given  in  Appendix  6.  Low-input \nfish-farming practices, which are an improvement over the traditional tambak (fish pond) culture, \nwill be employed to ensure broad-based acceptance, success, and sustainability.  \n \n27. \nTo  promote  the  adoption  of  suitable,  environment-friendly,  community-based/managed \naquaculture  practices  by  fish  farmers,  the  Project  will  establish  demonstration  facilities  and/or \nmodel enterprises that may be replicated at other sites within the project area. District fisheries \nservices  will  invite  well  performing  privately  owned  fish  firms  to  provide  experts  to  prepare \nmodels  of  demonstration  facilities  and  supervise  fish  farmers  organizations  in  managing  and \noperating  these  facilities.  The  form  and  procedural  details  of  private  sector  participation  in  the \nProject will be developed in the first year of the Project.  \n \n28. \nTo  support  the  seed  requirements  of  the  fish  farmers,  the  Project  will  develop  or \nrehabilitate small community-based fish/shrimp hatcheries and nurseries. The communities will \nbe  consulted  in  the  identification  of  sites  for  hatcheries.  Materials  for  land-  or  water-based \nhatcheries  will  be  procured  with  project  funds,  but  construction  will  be  carried  out  with  labor \ncontributed by the fish farmers organizations. The district governments will support operation of \nthese hatcheries over a period of three years, after which the fish farmers organizations will own \nand  operate  them.  District  government  hatcheries  will  also  be  improved  and  upgraded,  as \nneeded, and focus on broodstock to assure the availability of quality breeders for use in private \nhatcheries and fish farms. \n \nCommunity-Based  Management  of  Culture-Based  Fisheries.  Aquaculture  involves \n29. \nraising  certain  aquatic  species  almost  exclusively  in  controlled  environments.  By  contrast,  in \nculture-based  fisheries  aquatic  species  spend  only  limited  time  in  controlled  environments \nbefore they or their seed/fry are released into open freshwater, brackishwater, or marine water \nand  allowed  to  propagate  or  grow  on  natural  foods  until  they  reach  harvestable  size.  Culture-\nbased fisheries can enhance fishery resources, replenish natural stocks whose populations have \ndeclined  through  overexploitation  or  environmental  degradation,  or  simply  maximize  the \nproductivity  of  a  water  body.  The  Project  will  support  community-managed  culture-based \nfisheries  programs  in  sites  where  extensive  open-water  areas  are  available  for  stock \nenhancement of certain species. \n \n \n \n30. \nThis  component  will  upgrade  the  production  techniques  and  quality  of  aquaculture \nproducts  through  strengthened  extension  services  and  improved  post-harvest  handling, \n\nAquaculture Support Services \n\n2. \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nprocessing,  and  marketing  techniques  in  collaboration  with  the  private  sector  and  fish  farmers \norganizations.  Activities  will  include:  (i)  provision  of  fisheries  extension  services  to  project \nbeneficiaries,  including  the  establishment  of  site-specific  demonstration  and  input  assistance \nmodules;  (ii)  upgrading  or  improvement  of  facilities  and  techniques  for  post-harvest  handling, \nprocessing,  and  marketing  of  aquaculture  products;  (iii)  expansion  of  markets  for  aquaculture \ncommodities and promoting the consumption of identified species; (iv) improving environmental \nand  fish  health  management;  and  (v)  applied  research  on  improved  species  and  culture \ntechnologies.  The  Project  will  not  include  a  credit  component  in  support  of  aquaculture \nproduction  but,  instead,  facilitate  fish  farmers  organizations  access  to  credit  by  improving  their \ncreditworthiness. A listing of available schemes which can be tapped by the project beneficiaries \nis given in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nExtension  Services.  Extension  services  provided  to  participating  fish  farmers  and  the \n31. \nprivate  sector  will  include  the  establishment  of  site-specific  demonstration  facilities  and  the \nintroduction of new aquaculture and processing technologies. Poor fish farmers will be provided \nwith  production  inputs  assistance  to  support  their  aquaculture  production  and  processing \nactivities.  Given  that  the  decentralization  process  weakened  extension  services,  community \nextension  workers  (CEWs)  will  be  recruited  by  the  district  governments  to  strengthen  the \ndistricts' fisheries extension services. The CEWs will also provide grassroots-level training to fish \nfarmers  on  the  establishment  and  management  of  sustainable  aquaculture  enterprises. \nthe  private  sector  partners  of  participating  district \nTechnical  personnel  employed  by \ngovernments  will  also  be  tapped  to  render  extension  services  to  organized  fish  farmers,  as \nrequired.   \n \nProcessing  and  Post-Harvest  Handling.  The  Project  will  support  establishment  of \n32. \nsmall-scale  facilities  for  production  of  low  cost  fish  feeds  using  locally  available  raw  materials; \nfish  and  seaweed  drying,  grading  and  packaging;  and  processing  of  fish  byproducts.  All  these \nfacilities will be established as demonstration units and managed by fish farmers organizations. \nThis  will  ensure  that  fish  farmers  maximize  returns  from  their  production  activities  and  reduce \nlosses  stemming  from  poor  or  deteriorating  fish  quality.  Facilities  and  sites  will  be  determined \nbased on specific criteria and guidelines developed jointly by DGA, district fisheries services and \ncommunities  during  project  implementation.  Training  will  be  provided  to  fish  farmers  on \noperations and maintenance of the facilities. \n \n33. \nFish  Marketing  Development.  Organized  fish  farmers,  as  well  as  private  sector \nindividuals or entities, will be provided institutional and technical assistance in the marketing of \ntheir products. Specific marketing needs will be identified and appropriate market development \nor marketing strategies will be formulated for various aquaculture commodities. Fish marketing \nand  distribution  networks  will  be  established  with  the  cooperation  of  medium-  to  large-scale \naquaculture  businesses.  Fish  collection  points  will  be  established  close  to  major  production \nareas. A market information system will be designed and installed in district government offices \nand  linked  to  DGA  to  enable  fish  farmers  and  private  enterprises  to  gain  access  to  real-time \ndata  on  market  prices,  supply  and  demand,  and  other  market-related  information  for  various \naquaculture products. To increase the consumption of freshwater fish, a multimedia marketing \ncampaign will be launched in the project provinces. Regular trade fairs will also be organized to \nfacilitate linkages between fish traders, exporters, and producers of high-value fish species. \n \n34. \nEnvironmental  and  Fish  Health  Management.  To  minimize  the  risk  of  disease \noutbreaks  and  mitigate  against  possible  adverse  impacts  of  aquaculture  activities,  the  Project \nwill  adopt  the  following  measures:  (i)  use  of  extensive  monoculture  or  polyculture  systems,  or \nrotation of milkfish and shrimp cropping in the same ponds; (ii) use of disease-resistant shrimp \n\n\f9 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nspecies in shrimp monoculture, and limiting their use to low-density culture; (iii) introduction of \nenvironment-friendly  practices  and  aquaculture  systems,  such  as  silvo-fisheries 9 ;  (iv) \nestablishment of water quality laboratories and fish health laboratories close to major production \nareas in the participating districts; (v) monitoring of the quality of fish fingerlings or prawn/shrimp \npostlarvae  used  to  stock  the  ponds,  which  will  prevent  the  possible  introduction  of  disease-\ncausing organisms into the culture environment; (vi) strict monitoring of water quality in ponds, \nsupply canals, and drain canals in order to detect early warning signs of impending fishkills or \nfish/shrimp disease occurrence; (vii) training of district fisheries personnel, CEWs, fish farmers, \nand  private  investors  on  proper  pond  and  culture  system  management  and  fish  disease \nprevention and control; and (viii) requiring medium- to large-scale private enterprises involved in \nintensive  fish  and  shrimp  culture  systems  to  incorporate  settling  or  sedimentation  tanks  in  the \ndesign  of  their  aquaculture  systems  in  order  to  mitigate  against  possible  adverse  effects  on \ndownstream water quality. \n \n35. \nApplied Research. Continued applied research to support aquaculture development will \nbe  conducted  by  the  DGA\u2019s  technical  implementing  units  and  aquaculture  centers,  MMAF\u2019s \nAgency  for  Marine  and  Fisheries  Research,  and  collaborating  academic  and  research \ninstitutions. Research activities to be supported by the Project will be designed by DGA during \nproject  implementation  and  could  include  (i)  adaptive  research  and  field  verification  trials  on \nimproved culture techniques for various species; (ii) addressing site specific technical problems \nand  issues;  and  (iii)  exploratory  research  on  other  species  with  commercial  potential.  The \noutcome of the research activities will be disseminated for future replication by fish farmers and \nthe  private  sector.  Research-extension  linkages  will  be  established  between  provincial  and \ndistrict fisheries services in order to facilitate the commercial application of research results by \nfish farmers. \n \n \n \n36. \nservices, fish farmers, and the private sector in aquaculture development.  \n \n37. \nInstitutional  Strengthening.  The  Project  will  include  the  following  activities:  (i) \ninstitutional  assessment  of  relevant  institutions  and  entities  to  determine  priority  areas  of \nstrengthening;  (ii)  development  and  launching  of  a  human  resource  development  training \nprogram  for DGA, the provincial and district fisheries services (particularly extension personnel), \nCEWs,  and  community  organizations  and  associations  (including  those  involving  women  and \ndisadvantaged groups);10 (iii) development and installation of an aquaculture information system \nin  DGA,  with  links  to  the  project  districts;  this  will  enable  the  timely  collection  and  provision  of \naccurate  data  on  aquaculture  production  and  provide  analysis  for  planning,  management,  and \nregulation  purposes;  and  (iv)  support  DGA  in  drafting  the  necessary  legal  documents  and \nregulations,  and  in  conducting  policy  dialogues  with  provincial  and  district  governments  on \nsustainable aquaculture development and environmental management.   \n \n38. \nProject Management.  In order to ensure timely and effective implementation of project \nactivities and efficient use of funds and other project resources, this component will support (i) \noperation of a project management office (PMO) in DGA and project implementation units (PIUs) \n                                                 \n9  Fishculture in coastal mangrove. \n10 As  aquaculture  is  a  largely  private  sector  endeavor,  the  Project\u2019s  capacity-building  interventions  will  include  the \nprivate sector in the participating districts. Private companies, especially those that will be involved as partners of \nthe district government in the operation of demonstration facilities and enterprises,  will be invited to participate in \nthe various training programs.  \n\nThis component aims to enhance the institutional capability of DGA, the district fisheries \n\nInstitutional Strengthening and Project Management \n\n3. \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nin the five project districts; (ii) engagement of international and national consultants to assist the \nPMO  and  PIUs  in  project  management;  (iii)  procurement  of  vehicles  and  other  equipment, \nsupplies,  and  materials  for  the  Project;  and  (iv)  establishment  of  accounting,  monitoring, \nreporting, and evaluation systems. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Targeting \n\n39. \nThe  target  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  are  poor  fish  farmers.  Project  locations  were \nselected to represent a range of agro-ecological  systems where poor farmers live, from inland \nfish  farms  to  brackish  and  marine  aquatic  areas  of  varying  population,  environmental \ncharacteristics and market access. High poverty incidence among the rural population is one of \nthe main criteria for selection of subproject sites. Project areas have few alternative sources of \nlivelihood  outside  of  aquaculture,  which  underlines  the  importance  of  developing  sustainable \neconomic  activities  for  poor  fish  farmers.  The  Project  is  aimed  at  enhancing  incomes  by \naddressing  infrastructure,  technological,  environmental,  and  market-access  constraints  for \naquaculture  development.  These  constraints,  which  are  often  interrelated,  have  caused  small \naquaculture enterprises to be abandoned in rural areas throughout Indonesia. This Project could \nthus  serve  as  a  model  for  addressing  the  needs  of  poor  fish-farming  communities  throughout \nthe  archipelago.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  improve  food  security  of  poor  consumers  by \nstabilizing the supply of affordable fish products. \n \n\n2. \n\nCommunity Participation \n\n40. \nThe  Project  calls  for  significant  community  financial  contributions  (6.2%  of  the  total \nproject costs, and more than 15% of costs related to aquaculture development activities). Most \nof  the  aquaculture  and  culture-based  fisheries  activities  will  be  directly  implemented  by \ncommunities. Such a strong community contribution and commitment should ensure the quality \nand  sustainability  of  project  interventions.  To  further  enhance  community  participation  and  the \nsustainability  of  project  interventions,  the  Project  provides  comprehensive  technical  and \nextension  support  for  fish  farmer  beneficiaries,  and  includes  innovative  mechanisms  to  assist \norganized fish farmer groups with their production inputs and market requirements. \n \n\n3. \n\nPublic\u2013Private Sector Partnership \n\nThe  Project  aims  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  investment  by \n41. \nremoving technical and infrastructure impediments to aquaculture development in project areas. \nIt  also  promotes  public-private  sector  partnerships  in  the  implementation  of  aquaculture \ndevelopment  activities,  including  provision  of  experts  to  prepare  models  of  demonstration \nfacilities and supervision of fish farms developed by the Project. Private sector participation will \naugment  and  benefit  the  operations  of  small-scale  fish  farmers  and  facilitate  small-scale  fish \nfarmers\u2019 access to markets. \n \n\n4. \n\nCapacity Building at Local Levels \n\n42. \nThe  Project  will  be  coordinated  nationally  but  will  be  implemented  under  decentralized \nmanagement.  Through  its  institutional  strengthening  activities,  the  Project  will  assist  district \ngovernments  in  building  their  technical  capacity  to  support  the  needs  of  the  beneficiaries  and \ntheir communities while also supporting the country\u2019s aquaculture industry as a whole. \n \n\n\f11 \n\n \n\nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe project investment cost is estimated at $44.52 million, including taxes and duties of \n\n43. \n$3.92 million.

A PMO will be set up within DGA. It will be staffed by a dedicated \nproject  director  and  a  project  manager,  and  required  technical,  administrative,  and  financial \nstaff. The PMO will oversee the day-to-day project implementation including (i) coordination of \nspecific  project  activities;  (ii)  preparation  of  various  project  reports  to  be  submitted  to  the \nNational  Steering  Committee  (NSC)  and  ADB;  (iii)  close  monitoring  of  project  implementation; \n(iv) central level procurement of specific goods and services; (v) selection and engagement of \nconsultants;  and  (vi)  design  and  undertaking  of  baseline,  midterm  and  project  completion \nsurveys. A PIU will be set up in each project district to implement district-level project activities, \nincluding  procurement  of  materials,  equipment  and  services,  and  to  coordinate  with  district \ngovernment  agencies  involved  in  areas  such  as  forestry,  environment,  agriculture,  rural \ndevelopment,  home  affairs,  and  cooperatives.  Each  PIU  will  comprise  a  dedicated  PIU  head \nwith  experience  and  expertise  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  the  required  technical,  administrative, \nand  financial  staff.  A  consultant  team  comprising  international  and  national  specialists  will \nprovide  technical  assistance  to  the  Project  at  the  national  and  district  levels.  The  project \norganization chart is shown in Appendix 8. \n \n47. \nDGA, with the support of relevant MMAF directorates general and academic institutions, \nwill  also  be  responsible  for  the  following  activities:  (i)  establishment  and  operation  of  an \naquaculture  management  information  system,  (ii)  development  of  aquaculture  technical  and \nenvironmental  guidelines,  (iii)  launching  human  resources  development  training  programs,  (iv) \naquaculture research, and (v) technology and information dissemination. \n  \n48. \nfor  cross-sector  coordination  and \nresponsible \nimplementation  of  the  Project\u2019s  field  activities,  including  the  provision  of  support  toward  (i) \ndesign and rehabilitation of sustainable aquaculture farming systems and post-harvest facilities; \n(ii)  launching  programs  in  hatchery  production,  culture-based  fisheries,  and  lake  and  river \nmanagement;  (iii)  aquaculture  technology  demonstration  and  extension;  and  (iv)  small-scale \ninfrastructure development in support of local aquaculture. \n\nDistrict  governments  will  be \n\n\f13 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n49. \nThe private  sector and NGOs/CBOs will be involved in supporting the following project \nactivities: (i) community organization, (ii) aquaculture systems demonstrations, (iii) project inputs \nassistance  and  market  support  to  small-scale  fish  farmers,  and  (iv)  credit  and  financial \nassistance. Participating communities will be empowered to carry out sustainable aquaculture, \nresource-management, and livelihood activities at identified sites. \n \n50. \nThe  NSC  will  provide  guidance  on the  overall  direction  of the  Project  and  inter-agency \ncoordination  to  ensure  that  project activities  are  in  line  with  government  policy  on  aquaculture \ndevelopment.  The  NSC  will  be  chaired  by  the  Director  General  of  Aquaculture  and  comprise \nsenior  officials  of  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS),  MOF,  and  a \nsecretary.  Participating  district  governments  will  be  invited  to  attend  NSC  meetings  on  issues \nrequiring  their  participation.  The  NSC  will  be  assisted  by  a  national  technical  committee \ncomprising technical staff of the NSC member agencies and the Ministry of Home Affairs, and \nheaded  by  NSC  secretary.  At  the  district  level,  a  regional  advisory  committee  (RAC)  will  be \nestablished in each project district to oversee project coordination between the various agencies \nat  the  local  level  and  liaise  with  the  NSC  as  required.  The  RAC  will  be  composed  of \nrepresentatives  of  the  participating  district  governments  and  other  agencies  and  institutions \nconcerned at the regional level. \n \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  6-year  period  (2007\u20132013).  The  Project \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n51. \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nThe PMO and PIUs11 will be responsible for the procurement of all goods, services and \n52. \nworks  under  their  respective  areas  of  supervision. 12 Goods  and  services  financed  partly  or \nwholly by ADB will be procured in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Contract \npackages  for  goods  exceeding  $500,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB).  Each  contract  costing  between  $100,000  and  $500,000  will  be \nawarded  through  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB).  Minor  equipment  and  materials  costing \nless than $100,000 will be procured through shopping. Civil works contract packages exceeding \n$1,000,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  ICB.  Contract  packages  between  $100,000  and \n$500,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  NCB.  Small  scale  civil  works  contracts  with  an \naverage value of $10,000\u2013$25,000 equivalent will follow procurement procedures for community \nparticipation  in  procurement  as  contained  in  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  A  procurement \nplan is given in Appendix 10. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n53. \nThe Project will require consulting services for a total of 672 person-months, comprising \n56  international  and  616  national  person-months.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  a \nfirm  and  will  be  selected  following  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  (QCBS)  method  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  outline  terms  of  reference \n(TOR) of consultants are in Appendix 11; the detailed TORs are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n                                                 \n11 Each PIU will be assisted by a site advisor, a national consultant with experience in, among others, procurement. \n12 Independent  observers  may  be  invited  to  sit  in  project  procurement  committees  to  strengthen  governance  at  the \n\ncentral and regional levels. \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n54. \nIn  addition,  the  Project  will  employ  NGOs  to  assist  local  communities  in  carrying  out \naquaculture  and  related  activities,  and  in  accessing  existing  local  microfinance  schemes. \nAquaculture  research,  special  studies  and  surveys,  training,  social  preparation,  community \nempowerment,  and  database  development  will  be  contracted  to  qualified  local  academic  or \nresearch  institutions  and  consulting  firms.  NGOs/CBOs  and  academic  institutions  will  be \nselected  following  the  least-cost  selection  and/or  single  source  selection  procedures  of  the \nGuidelines. \n \n\n5. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n55. \nTo  monitor  and  evaluate  the  operational  performance  of  the  agencies  and  institutions \ninvolved  and  the  benefits  obtained  from  the  Project,  DGA,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  will \nestablish  a  Project  Performance  Management  System  (PPMS)  in  the  PMO  within  one  year  of \nloan  effectiveness.  The  PPMS  will  (i)  monitor  (both  physically  and  financially)  key  activities, \nincluding  consultant  recruitment,  equipment  and  materials  procurement,  training,  surveys, \nspecial  studies,  policy  development,  and  the  drafting  of  implementation  guidelines;  (ii)  monitor \nand  rate  the  performance  of  various  stakeholders,  including  local  communities,  in  project \nactivities; (iii) monitor the Project\u2019s social, environmental, and economic impacts, and establish \nbenchmarks;  and  (iv)  introduce  mechanisms  for  adjusting  project  design  and  project \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  for  incorporating  lessons  learned  from  similar  projects  into \nproject planning. \n \n56. \nConsultants  will  support  the  PMO  in  designing  a  baseline  survey  and  midterm  and \nproject completion surveys that will help evaluate the financial, economic, and social impacts of \nthe  Project.  At  the  community  level,  participatory  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  will  be \nintroduced as part of the Project\u2019s comprehensive participatory development approach.  Special \nstudies  may  be  conducted  to  investigate  issues  related  to  project  implementation  and  impact. \nFor  periodic  monitoring,  key  indicators  will  be  developed  and  incorporated  in  the  regular \nreporting  system.  PMO  staff  will  make  regular  field  visits  to  monitor  progress.  Project  M&E \nreports  will  be  submitted  by  the  PMO  to  ADB  on  a  quarterly  basis.  Upon  project  completion, \nproject impact will be evaluated in accordance with a schedule and TOR to be mutually agreed \nupon by the Government and ADB. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \n57. \nHandbook.  An  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  Bank  Indonesia  in  the  name  of  the \nExecuting  Agency.  The  advance  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  limited  to  10%  of  the  loan \namount or 6 months projected expenditure, whichever is less. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure \nprocedure will be followed to liquidate funds advanced to the imprest account and will apply to \ncontracts not exceeding $100,000. The flow of funds is shown in Supplementary Appendix C. \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n58. \nPMO,  PIUs,  and  other  agencies  involved  in  project  implementation  will  prepare  and \nmaintain  separate  accounts  exclusively  for  the  Project  and  will  register  in  such  accounts  all \nreceipts  and  payments  for  the  Project  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and \nprocedures. The project accounts will be audited annually by an independent auditor acceptable \nto ADB. An audit opinion of the project accounts will reflect  (i) an assessment of the adequacy \nof  accounting  and  internal  control  systems  with  respect  to  project  expenditures  and  other \n\n\f15 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfinancial  transactions,  in  order  to  ensure  safe  custody  of  project-financed  assets;  (ii)  a \ndetermination  as  to  whether  the  borrower  and  project  implementing  entities  have  maintained \nadequate  documentation  of  all  relevant  transactions,  including  specific  mention  of  SOE  and \nspecial account transactions; (iii) a confirmation that expenditures submitted to ADB are eligible \nfor financing, and identification of any ineligible expenditures; and (iv)  a confirmation that loan \ncovenants and ADB requirements for project management have been complied with. The audit \nopinion needs to be submitted to ADB within six months of the end of the financial year along \nwith audited financial statements including opinion on imprest accounts and SOE. \n\n \n\n59. \nThe  Government  and  the  EA  were  informed  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  submission  of  audited \naccounts,  which  covers  failure  to  submit  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  within  the \ndue  time.  A  formal  warning  will  be  issued  for  accounts  more  than  six  months  overdue,  and \ndisbursements will be suspended for accounts more than 12 months overdue. \n \n60. \nReporting systems will be set up at the national and local levels to enable DGA, through \nPMO,  to  effectively  supervise  the  implementation  of  all  Project  activities  and  provide  timely \nadvice and support to the PIUs. PMO will be responsible for (i) collecting and consolidating all \nproject progress reports, site reports, technical reports, and financial reports; and (ii) preparing \nand submitting to ADB quarterly progress reports, the midterm project evaluation report, and the \noverall project completion report. The PIUs will be responsible for (i) preparing project progress, \ntechnical,  and  financial  reports  covering  site-specific  activities;  and  (ii)  collecting  and \nconsolidating field data and feedback from local participating agencies and contractors that will, \nin turn, be relayed to PMO. Reports will be prepared in a format acceptable to ADB13 and will be \nposted  on  a  project  Web  site  that  will  be  set  up  under  the  MMAF  Web  site.  The  PMO  will  be \nstaffed  with  experienced  officials  with  adequate  financial  management  skills  and  systems.  To \nstrengthen accountability, the PMO will be responsible for reconciling the PIUs\u2019 financial reports \nand the Project's overall financial accounts, and for posting the consolidated financial report on \nthe project Web site for stakeholder examination. At the same time, to maximize transparency at \nthe  local  level,  each  PIU  will  provide  copies  of  its  financial  reports  to  the  fish  farmers\u2019 \nassociations  and  the  NGOs  responsible  for  the  project  social  preparation  and  community \nempowerment.  These  financial  reports  will  contain  information  on  the  allocated  budget, \ncommitments, and disbursements.  \n \n\n8. \n\nMidterm Review  \n\n61. \nAt the beginning of the fourth year of implementation, a comprehensive midterm review \nof  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  to  identify  any  problems  and  constraints  encountered  and \nassess  the  need  for  mid-course  modification  of  the  project  scope  and  implementation \narrangements.  Technical  and  budgetary  changes  to  the  project  document,  arising  from  PPMS \nfindings, will also be considered.  \n \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n62. \nThe Government was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy and Policy relating to the \nCombating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require  the \nGovernment  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternal  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money  laundering \n\n                                                 \n13 The  Project  will  use  the  template  for  quarterly  reports,  which  is  now  being  developed  by  IRM  for  use  by  all  ADB \n\nprojects in Indonesia. \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\nactivities or the financing of terrorism and covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such \nactivities.  The  investment  documentation  between  ADB  and  the  Government  will  further  allow \nADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential  violation  of  these  undertakings.  In  particular,  all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the \nright  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n63. \nThe  project  design  and  implementation  arrangements  provide  for  mitigating  corruption \nrisks. The participatory management of the project with the implementation responsibility shared \nby  DGA  and  districts  governments  and  the  involvement  of  NGOs  and  CBOs  in  field  level \nactivities will improve transparency and accountability in the decision making process. The cost-\nsharing arrangement will motivate district governments and beneficiaries to strive for economy \nand efficiency in project implementation and avoid corrupt practices. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n64. \nThe  Project\u2019s  major  quantifiable  economic  benefit  will  be  increased  aquaculture \nproduction and productivity. By improving access infrastructure, promoting competitive fish and \nshrimp hatcheries and nurseries, providing post-harvest and processing facilities, and providing \nmarketing support, the Project will significantly reduce transaction costs and increase farmgate \nprices of aquaculture products. The introduction of new culture techniques or new aquaculture \ncommodities  through  pilot  demonstrations,  based  on  applied  research  results,  will  improve \naquaculture  yields.  Financial  analysis  for  five  representative  activities  (grouper  cage  culture, \nmud-crab fattening, seaweed production, carp ponds culture, and tiger shrimp cultivation) at the \nfarm level was undertaken to determine the financial viability of aquaculture in the post-project \nscenario.  All  of  the  representative  aquaculture  activities  exhibit  financial  internal  rate  of  return \n(FIRR) values significantly above the prevailing financial cost of capital of 22%, and they were \nnot  sensitive  to  major  risks  (Appendix  12  and  details  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D).  To \ndetermine the economic viability of the Project, economic internal rate of return (EIRR) values \nwere  estimated  for  representative  aquaculture  activities.  The  anticipated  EIRR  values  for \nindividual schemes ranged from 15% to 21%. \n \n65. \nThe  strengthening  of  extension  services  will  enhance  the  sustainability  of  aquaculture \nenterprises  by  improving  the  provision  of  continuous  technical  support  and  training  to  fish \nfarmers.  The  establishment  of  research\u2013extension  linkages  between  provincial  and  district \nfisheries  services  will  facilitate  the  commercial  application  of  research  results  by  fish  farmers, \nwhich in turn will lead to improvements in aquaculture productivity in project sites. Aquaculture \ntraining  and  demonstrations  for  fish  farmers  will  not  only  lead  to  establishment  of  small-scale \nenterprises, but will also provide technically educated labor for medium-scale enterprises. The \nimprovement  in  financial  returns  for  aquaculture  as  a  result  of  project  activities  should  lead  to \nmore  private  sector  participation.  In  addition,  the  Project  is  expected  to  result  in  (i) \nenvironmental benefits arising from improved aquaculture resources management at the district \nand  village  levels;  (ii)  improved  nutrition  and  health  of  rural  populations  stemming  from \nexpanded  food  supplies  and  increased  consumption  of  animal  protein;  (iii)  enhanced  inter-\nagency  and  public\u2013private  sector  linkages  through  strengthened  partnerships  in  aquaculture \ndevelopment;  and  (iv)  empowerment  of  small  fish  farmers  and  rural  communities  with \nfisheries \nknowledge  and  skills \nmanagement. \n \n\nin  community-based  aquaculture  and  culture-based \n\n\f17 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nB. \n\nSocial Measures and Impact on Poverty \n\n66. \nThe  Project  will  reduce  poverty  by  boosting  incomes,  employment,  and  food  security. \nThe  socioeconomic  survey  conducted  during  project  preparation  showed  that  poverty \nincidence14 among aquaculture households in the project districts ranges from 26% to 48%. The \ntotal  population  at  risk15 is  estimated  at  203,664,  or  60%  of  the  aquaculture  population  in  the \nproject  districts.  The  Project  is  expected  to  help  14,000  poor  households  to  increase  their \nincomes to levels above the poverty line. Not only will the Project engage about 18,000 person-\nyears  of  labor  in  aquaculture,  but  it  will  also  create  many  jobs  in  the  aquaculture  industry\u2019s \nsupply chain (transportation of goods, processing of byproducts such as fish fry and terasi, fish \ntrading, etc.). A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is given in Appendix 13.  \n \nThe  Project  will  require  minimal  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  will  not \n67. \ninvolve  significant  involuntary  resettlement  as  described  in  the  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement.  The  subproject  selection  criteria  (Appendix  5)  ensure  that  only  subprojects  with \nminimal land acquisition will be approved. Details of land acquisition will be known only after the \nsubprojects are identified at detailed design level. The Project has established a compensation \npolicy framework and procedural guidelines (Supplementary Appendix F) to be followed in the \npreparation of the needed resettlement plans. Buton district has large populations of indigenous \npeoples  and  it  is  likely  that  some  of  them  will  be  affected  once  the  subprojects  are  fully \nidentified. To guide the preparation of needed indigenous peoples development plans, DGA has \nprepared  an  indigenous  peoples development  framework  reflecting  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s \npolicy on indigenous peoples (Supplementary Appendix G).    \n \nThe  project  scope  will  meet  women\u2019s  needs  and  improve  their  socioeconomic  status \n68. \ngetting  them  more  involved  in  aquaculture,  culture-based  fisheries,  and  related  activities, \nincluding fish processing, trading, and community-based monitoring. Several gender-responsive \nactivities  dealing  with  women\u2019s  reproductive,  productive,  and  community  management  roles \nhave been incorporated into the project design. The Project will support poor women in gaining \naccess  to  resources,  technical  assistance,  and  capacity-building  efforts  for  poverty  reduction \nand food security. Women will be included in all project activities, including those dealing with \nproduction  inputs  assistance  and  training.  To  ensure  that  the  Project  addresses  gender \nconcerns women will be hired to conduct gender training to sensitize local government officials \nand  personnel  to  women\u2019s  needs.  Baseline  PPMS  surveys  and  the  midterm  and  project \ncompletion surveys will collect gender-disaggregated data. Gender indicators will be included in \nthe  PPMS  and  will  become  an  important  element  in  the  evaluation  system  for  the  PMO  and \nNGOs.  Specific  targets  for  women  participation  in  project  activities  are  given  in  Appendix  13, \nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy, Section D.  \n \nC. \n\nEnvironment \n\n69. \nThe  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  conducted  during  project  preparation \nshowed that none of the interventions are projected to have significant or adverse  impacts on \nthe environment. A few minor environmental impacts are likely as a result of factors related to \nsite  selection,  construction,  and  operation,  but  these  are  small  and  avoidable  and  could  be \nminimized  through  careful  planning  and  the  adoption  of  proper  construction  practices. \nAppropriate  environmental  safeguards  have  been  built  into  project  design  to  mitigate  against \nthese likely negative effects. A summary IEE is given in Appendix 14.  \n\n                                                 \n14 The poverty incidence rate for the districts was based on the Rp3.2 million poverty threshold. \n15  Defined as those under the poverty threshold plus those just above the poverty line. \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nD. \n\nRisks and Countermeasures \n\n \n\n70. \nThe risks that could affect project implementation and constrain the attainment of project \nobjectives  are:  (i)  institutional  inadequacies  of  DGA  and  the  district  governments;  (ii)  lack  of \ncooperation  and  coordination  between  DGA  and  the  district  governments,  and  between  the \ndistrict  fisheries  service  and  other  local  government  agencies;  (iii)  lack  of  Government \ncounterpart  funds,  (iv)  lack  of  interest  of  the  private  sector  to  participate  in  the  Project;  (v) \nreluctance  of  poor  fish  farmers  to  adopt  new  or  improved  technologies;  (vi)  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  resulting  from  more  intensive  culture  practices;  and  (vii)  misuse  of \nproject funds and facilities. \n \nThe risks arising from institutional inadequacies, lack of coordination between agencies, \n71. \nand  lack  of  counterpart  funds  will  be  minimized  by  the  (i)  the  establishment  of  NSC  and  RAC \nwith functions aimed at promoting effective coordination of project implementation; (ii) provision \nof competent project management staff by DGA and the participating district governments; (iii) \nvigorous  implementation  of  the  Project\u2019s  institutional  strengthening  component,  including  a \nmassive training program for all stakeholders; (iv) adoption  of a \u201clearning approach\u201d to project \nimplementation, whereby relatively new technologies are demonstrated and pilot-tested prior to \nfull-scale implementation; (v) establishment of close working relationships among NGOs/CBOs, \nextension staff, participating rural communities, and the private sector; (vi) provision of project \nmanagement  specialist  services  to  assist  and  support  PMO,  PIUs,  and  local  extension \npersonnel; and (vii) design and implementation of an effective monitoring and reporting system, \nwith a view to obtaining prompt feedback and enabling timely remedies.  \n \n72. \nIt is not likely that the private sector will lack interest given that the Project will provide \nvarious incentives for their participation, such as upgrades to infrastructure (e.g. access roads, \npost-harvest  processing  facilities,  and  water-quality  and  fish-health  laboratories).  The  private \nsector will also have ample opportunity to access Project support and to participate in training \nprograms to upgrade their skills in aquaculture and related fields. \n \n73. \nThe  rapid  social  assessment  surveys  performed  during  project  preparation  found  that \nfish  farmers  are  highly  interested  in  participating  in  the  Project  and  willing  to  adopt  new  or \nimproved  fish-farming  technologies  to  improve  output  and  yields.  Moreover,  the  social \npreparation  and  community  organizing  work  to  be  carried  out  by  contracted  NGOs  will  build \nupon  this  interest  and  prepare  fish  farmers  for  participation  in  the  Project.  Existing  practice  of \nmonitoring  of  development  projects  by  civil  society  organizations  will  also  help  preventing \ncorruption at the district level. Finally, the possibility of adverse environmental impacts resulting \nfrom  project  interventions  will  be  mitigated  by  a  number  of  project  design  features  including \nenvironmental  management  training,  laboratory  facilities  for  monitoring  water  quality  and  fish \nhealth,  adoption  of  low-density  culture,  and  selection  of  species  that  are  either  naturally \navailable or successfully cultured and adapted elsewhere in the country. \n \n74. \nOn  the  whole,  therefore,  the  technical  soundness  of  the  proposed  production  and \nsupport  interventions  and  the  adoption  of  participatory  approaches  and  social  preparation \nactivities in project implementation will result in the benefits exceeding the costs. \n \n\n\f19 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MMAF  have  given  the \n\n75. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe  Government  ensures,  and  will  cause  each  of  the  participating  district \ngovernments to ensure, that counterpart funds for the project implementation will \nbe  provided  on  time.  Further  the  Government,  and  the  participating  district \ngovernments,  will  make  timely  submission  of  annual  budgetary  appropriation \nrequest and ensure prompt disbursement of appropriated funds during each year \nof project implementation. \n\n(ii)  The Government, through MMAF,  and the participating district governments will \nmake  available \nthroughout  Project \nrequired  number  of  qualified  staff \nimplementation,  to  be  assigned  to  the  PMO  and  the  PIUs.  The  PMO  will  be \nheaded  by  a  dedicated  Project  Director  with  the  support  of  a  Project  Manager, \nwith experience and expertise acceptable to ADB, and supported by the required \ntechnical,  administrative  and  financial  staff.  The  PIUs  will  comprise  a  dedicated \nPIU  Head,  with  experience  and  expertise  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  the  required \ntechnical, administrative and financial staff. \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii)  Within one year of loan effective date MMAF will establish a project performance \nmanagement  system  (PPMS),  which  will  encompass  (a)  monitoring  of  physical \nand financial progress as well as economy and efficiency of key activities such as \nrecruitment  of  consultants,  procurement  of  equipment  and  materials,  training \narrangements,  conduct  of  surveys  and  special  studies,  policy  development, \ndrafting of implementation guidelines, and the like; (b) monitoring of the level and \nadequacy of participation of various stakeholders, including local communities, in \nProject  activities;  (c)  monitoring  of  the  Project\u2019s  social,  environmental,  and \neconomic  impacts,  including  the  establishment  of  benchmark  information  and \ndata;  and  (d)  setting  a  mechanism  for  making  necessary  adjustments  in  the \nproject  design  and  implementation  arrangement  and  incorporating  lessons \nlearned from similar projects  in Project planning.  \nAt  the  community  level,  participatory  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  will  be \nintroduced  as  part  of  the  Project\u2019s  comprehensive  participatory  development \napproach. The M&E will be prepared in the form and substance agreed between \nthe Government and ADB and will be submitted to ADB on a quarterly basis. \nThe Government will ensure that only subprojects and beneficiaries meeting the \neligibility  criteria  for  selection  set  out  in  Appendix  5  of  this  document  receive \nfunding under the Project. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  and  will  cause  each  of  the  participating  district \ngovernments  to  ensure  that  prior  to  the  award  of  civil  works  contracts,  it  shall \nscreen for involuntary resettlement effects to ensure that there are no losses of \nland,  income,  housing,  community  facilities  and  resources  that  would  require \ncompensation  to  be  paid  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement.  In  the  event  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  required  for  any \nactivities  funded  under  the  Project, such  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  shall \nbe  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  Compensation  Policy  Framework \nand Procedural Guidelines prepared for the Project. \nThe  Government  will  ensure,  or  will  cause  each  of  the  participating  district \ngovernments  to  ensure,  that  the  gender  action  plan,  as  described  in  the \n\n(vii) \n\n(vi) \n\n(v) \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix  13  to  this  document,  is  complied  with,  in  order  to  ensure  (a)  equal \nopportunities  for  men  and  women  in  all  project  activities,  including  aquaculture \ndevelopment,  processing,  marketing,  resource  management  and  livelihood \nprograms; (b) equal opportunity for women to access financial assistance; and (c) \nachievement of specific targets set out therein.  \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  one  PMO  staff  member  is  designated  as  the \ngender focal point, with responsibility for organizing gender training, coordinating \ngender-related activities, advising on how gender concerns can be incorporated \nin project activities, and monitoring the extent to which this is done.  \nThe site selection, design, construction and operation of the aquaculture facilities \nand  social  infrastructure  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  relevant \ngovernment  regulations  and  standards  as  well  as  the  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nPolicy  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines.  Further,  all  aquaculture \nfacilities,  social  infrastructure,  and  microenterprise  activities  will  be  subjected  to \nan environmental screening prior to their establishment. \nThe Government will ensure that all necessary measures will be taken under the \nProject  with  regard  to  indigenous  peoples  in  accordance  with  the  Indigenous \nPeoples\u2019 Development Framework and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples.  \nProject  accounts,  including  financial  statements,  SOEs,  and  imprest  account, \ntogether with disbursement documents, will be audited annually by independent \nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB  and  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  not  later  than  six \nmonths after the end of each fiscal year. \n\n(xi) \n\n(x) \n\nB. \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\n76. \nCommittees shall have been established. \n \n\nPrior  to  loan  effectiveness,  the  National  Steering  Committee  and  Regional  Advisory \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n77. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 22,352,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for the \nSustainable  Aquaculture  Development  for  Food  Security  and  Poverty  Reduction  Project  from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter;

However, the actual area devoted to aquaculture is \ncurrently  estimated  at  only  810,000  ha,  representing  less  than  7%  of  the  total  potential  area. \nNevertheless,  the  existing  aquaculture  area  is  almost  double  that  devoted  to  aquaculture  in \n1980, when there were only 316,000 ha of fishponds, 89,000 ha of rice paddies that were used \nfor  fish  culture,  and  only  2  ha  of  fish  cages.  Aquaculture  and  inland  water  capture  fisheries \ncontribute 26% to the country\u2019s total fish production. Total aquaculture production increased by \nabout  10%  per  year  between  1994  and  2005,  from  597,520  metric  tons  (t)  to  2.1  million  t. \nTechnological innovations, area expansion, and availability of suitable quality and quantity of fish \nseed drove this increase. \n \nFreshwater  Aquaculture.    This  was  the  earliest  form  of  aquaculture  in  Indonesia, \n2. \nstarting in the middle of the 19th century with the stocking of common carp in backyard ponds in \nWest Java, and subsequently expanding to other parts of Java, Sumatera, and Sulawesi islands \nin the early 20th century. However, it was only in the late 1970s when a remarkable increase in \nproduction  from  freshwater  aquaculture  was  observed\u2014a  result  of  the  introduction  of  new \nfarming  technologies,  which  contributed  to  the  availability  of  hatchery-produced  seed,  and  the \ndevelopment  of  compound  fish  feeds.  The  main  freshwater  producing  regions  are  Java, \nSumatera,  Kalimantan,  Sulawesi,  Bali,  Nusa  Tenggara,  and  Maluku-Papua,  which  altogether \nproduced some 629,635 t in 2005. Common carp is the most dominant species, with production \ncomprising about half of the total freshwater aquaculture output. The production of common carp \nin ponds, cages, and paddy fields doubled from 1988 to 2001, with the bulk (64%) coming from \nJava, where it is widely preferred by the local people. Other common culture species are tilapia \n(Oreochromis  niloticus),  gouramy  (Osphronemus  gouramy),  and  on  a  limited  scale  the \nfreshwater  prawn  (Macrobrachium  rosenbergii).  The  Asian  catfish  (Pangasius  spp.),  locally \nknown as Patin Bangkok, was recently introduced into the country, and its production has been \ngrowing rapidly, especially in Sumatera. \n \n3. \nBrackishwater Aquaculture. Milkfish (Chanos chanos) remains the primary species for \nbrackishwater aquaculture at present, with production reaching about 644,000 t in 2005, almost \ndouble the 140,000 t produced in 1997. In terms of value, however, penaeid shrimp is the prime \ncommodity,  contributing  80%  to  total  fisheries  exports.  However,  because  outbreaks  of  white \nspot  virus  resulted  in  mass  mortalities  in  ponds,  tiger  shrimp  production  stagnated  at  around \n90,000 t from 1997-2001. In the previous years, shrimp production had risen dramatically from a \nlow of 77,451 t in 1988 to a high of 167,117 t in 1997. Private farmers continue to grow penaeid \nshrimp, albeit on a much reduced scale compared with the 1980s and 1990s. The production of \ntiger  shrimp  dropped  significantly  in  recent  years.  To  compensate  for  the  drop  in  jumbo  tiger \nshrimp  production in  the  wake  of  recent  disease  outbreaks,  white shrimp  (Penaeus  vannamei) \nand  rostris  shrimp  (Litopenaeus  stylirostris),  which  are  sturdier  than  tiger  shrimp,  were \nintroduced  by  the  Government  and  are  now  successfully  farmed  in  East  Java,  Lampung,  and \nBali, where the average yield is 10 t/ha/crop. \n \n4. \nMariculture.  The main mariculture species in Indonesia are (i) high-value finfish such as \nseabass  (Lates  calcarifer),  groupers  (Epinephelus  spp.,  Cromileptes  altivelis,  Plectropomus \nspp.), and snappers (Lutjanus argentimaculatus, L. sebae); (ii) mollusks, including  oysters such \nas  the  gold-lipped  pearl  oyster  (Pinctada  maxima),  the  black-lipped  pearl  oyster  (Pinctada \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27\n\n \n\nmargaritifera),  and  the  wing  oyster  (Pteria  penguin);  clams,  turban  snails  (Trochus  miloticus), \nabalone (Haliotis assinina), cockles, and mussels (Perna viridis); seaweeds (Eucheuma cottonii, \nE.  spinosum,  Gracilaria  sp.,  Gelidium  sp.),  and  other  species,  including  sea  cucumber \n(Holothuria  sp.),  also  known  as  beche-de-mer  or  trepang.  Research  and  experimentation \ninvolving other marine species believed to have good production potential have been ongoing at \nthe different aquaculture research centers. Other candidate species for mariculture include the \nswimming crab (Portunus pelagicus), mudcrab (Scylla paramamosain), bigeye trevally (Caranx \nsexfaciatus), golden trevally (Gnathonodon speciosus), Napoleon wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus), \nand  big-fin  squid  (Seploteuthis  lessoniana).  Preliminary  results  of  the  growout  of  humpback \ngrouper  (Cromileptes  altivelis)  and  tiger  grouper  (erinephelus  fuscoguttatus)  in  cages  in \nLempuing Bay (South Sumatera) were recently made available and indicate very good financial \nreturns. \n \nB. \n\nMarkets for Indonesian Aquaculture Products \n\n5. \nMost  aquaculture  products  are  consumed  domestically,  with  a  local  demand  high  for \nmilkfish, common carp, and tilapia in Java, Sulawesi, Lampung, and inland areas of Sumatera. \nIn addition to the domestic market, aquaculture products are exported to various countries. In \n2001, shrimp produced through aquaculture comprised 76% of total shrimp exports, while crab \nproduced  through  aquaculture  comprised  46%  of  total  crab  exports  and  seaweed  produced \nthrough aquaculture comprised 88% of total seaweed exports. Other aquaculture commodities \nwith  good  export  potential  include  grouper,  tilapia,  milkfish,  channel  catfish,  and  ornamental \nfish. \n \nSupply  and  Demand  Outlook. The demand for fish products is expected to increase \n6. \nover  the  period  2006\u20132014.  The  projected  annual  demand  for  fish  was  calculated  based  on \nprojections of total population and fish consumption per capita. Applying an annual growth rate \nof  1.2%,  the  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics  (BPS)  projects  the  total  population  of  Indonesia  to \nincrease  from  216.4  million  people  in  2004  to  243.4  million  people  in  2014.  Per  capita  fish \nconsumption,  based  on  simple  regression  analysis  using  per  capita  fish  consumption  time \nseries  data  for  the  period  1993\u20132005,  is  projected  to  increase  from  22.67kg/capita  to  31.14 \nkg/capita  between  2005  and  2014.  Given  these  scenarios,  total  annual  fish  demand  is \nexpected to increase from 5.5 million t in 2005 to 7.6 million t in 2014, as shown in Table A1.1 \nbelow. \n \n7. \nEstimates  of  total  annual  fish  supply  for  the  period  2006\u20132014  were  based  on  annual \nprojections  of  total  fish  production  (i.e.,  marine  capture  fisheries,  inland  capture  fisheries,  and \naquaculture  fisheries)  and  the  difference  between  fish  exports  and  imports.  Annual  fish \nproduction  from  marine  capture  fisheries,  inland  capture  fisheries,  and  aquaculture  was \nprojected based on 1988\u20132005 time series data and the application of regression analysis. Fish \nproduction  from  marine  fisheries  is  projected  to  increase  by  7%  over  the  2005\u20132014  period, \nwhile  production  from  inland  fisheries  is  projected  to  increase  by  2%  and  from  aquaculture \nfisheries by 75% over the same period. Projections of annual fish exports and imports also relied \non  estimates  of  annual  growth  rates  derived  from  regression  analysis  (see  footnotes  in  Table \nA1.1).  The  results  of  the  projections  of  fish  exports  and  imports  indicate  that  the  country  will \nremain  a  net  exporter  of  fish  and  fish  products.  Total  fish  supply  available  for  domestic \nconsumption is expected to increase from 5.2 million t in 2005 to 6.4 million t in 2014, which is \nstill  below  the  amount  required  to  satisfy  total  demand.  The  estimated  fish  demand  gap  was \nabout 263,000 t in 2005, and is projected to increase to about 1,143,000 t in 2014. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nYear \n\n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n\nTable A2: Fish Demand and Supply Projections, 2006 \u2013 2014 \n\nProjected \nPopulationa \n(000 \npersons) \n\nProjected per \nCapita Fish \nConsumptionb \n(kg) \n\nProjected \nFish \nDemandc \n(t) \n\nProjected Fish Production \n\nMarine \n(t) d \n\nInland \n(t) d \n\nAquaculture \n(t) d \n\nTotal \n\nProjected \nFish \nExports \n(t) 4 \n\nProjected \nFish \nImports \n(t) d \n\nNet \n(Exports) \nor \nImports \n(t) \n\nProjected \nFish \nSupply  \n(t) \n\nDemand \nGap  \n(t) \n\n221,655 \n224,196 \n226,767 \n229,367 \n231,997 \n234,788 \n237,613 \n240,473 \n243,366 \n\n25.82 \n26.48 \n27.15 \n27.81 \n28.48 \n29.14 \n29.81 \n30.48 \n31.14 \n\n5,722,565  4,221,149  325,108 \n5,937,360  4,259,843  325,834 \n6,156,328  4,296,648  326,524 \n6,379,537  4,331,740  327,181 \n6,607,054  4,365,273  327,810 \n6,842,785  4,397,378  328,412 \n7,083,232  4,428,172  328,989 \n7,328,475  4,457,758  329,544 \n7,578,595  4,486,228  330,077 \n\n1,308,715 \n1,392,841 \n1,482,375 \n1,577,664 \n1,679,079 \n1,787,013 \n1,901,885 \n2,024,141 \n2,154,256 \n\n \n\n5,854,972 \n5,978,517 \n6,105,546 \n6,236,586 \n6,372,162 \n6,512,802 \n6,659,046 \n6,811,443 \n6,970,561 \n\n674,465 \n683,329 \n691,760 \n699,798 \n707,480 \n714,834 \n721,888 \n728,665 \n735,187 \n\n182,744 \n185,279 \n187,690 \n189,990 \n192,187 \n194,290 \n196,308 \n198,246 \n200,111 \n\n359,314 \n(491,721)  5,363,251 \n456,893 \n(498,049)  5,480,468 \n554,851 \n(504,069)  5,601,477 \n652,759 \n(509,809)  5,726,777 \n750,186 \n(515,293)  5,856,869 \n850,527 \n(520,544)  5,992,259 \n(525,580)  6,133,466 \n949,767 \n(530,419)  6,281,024  1,047,452 \n(535,075)  6,435,486  1,143,109 \n\na  Based on 1.2% average annual growth rate as projected by the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS). \nb  Based on time series data over the period 1993\u20142005, and regression analysis. \nc  Project population multiplied by the projected per capita fish consumption. \nd  Based on time series data over the period 1988\u20142005, and regression analysis. \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n\n2\n8\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n2\n \n\ni\n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29\n\n \n\nInfrastructure Facilities \n\nAquaculture Support Facilities and Services \n\nC. \n \n1. \n \n \n \nVarious  physical  infrastructure  facilities  and  services  are  in  place  to  support  the  local \n8. \naquaculture  industry.  First,  a  large  number  of  fish  seed  production  facilities,  fish  disease \nlaboratories,  and  technical  implementing  units  provide  support  to  field  operations.  There  are \nnumerous  public  and  private  fish  and  shrimp  hatcheries  in  various  parts  of  the  country.  Fish \ndisease  laboratories  have  also  been  established  by  the  Government  at  five  sites,  namely:  (i) \nKarawang,  West  Java;  (ii)  Indramayu,  West  Java;  (iii)  Maribaya  (Tegal),  Central  Java;  (iv) \nBangil, East Java; and (v) Pangkep, South Sulawesi. Technical implementing units reporting to \nthe  DGA  have  been  set  up  in  12  sites  to  develop  hatchery  and  fish  culture  techniques  for \ntransfer  to  the  private  sector  and  provide  fish  farmers  with  technical  support  services  in  fish \nhealth and environmental management. \n \n9. \n In 2002, there were about 12,500 small- and medium-scale processing facilities in 30 \nprovinces and about 600 industrial fish-processing plants for various fish and aquatic products. \nThe  product  is  exported  to  Asian  countries,  the  United  States,  Canada,  and  the  European \nUnion.  More  than  half  (339)  of  the  industrial  processing  plants  have  been  implementing  the \nHazard Analysis for Critical Control Point (HACCP) program for quality and safety assurance \nfor fisheries products and are eligible to export products to the EU. Ice plants and cold-storage \nfacilities are part of the functional facilities of the fishing ports, which usually have designated \nindustrial areas for handling and post-harvest activities, ice plants, and cold storage.  \n \nIn  most  district  capitals,  there  are  public  markets  with  areas  specifically  designated  for \n10. \nfish sales. In Jakarta City, there are over 200 public markets, large and small, which cater to the \nday-to-day  needs  of  the  general  public  for  seafood,  particularly  for  middle-  to  low-income \nconsumers. Muara Baru, Jakarta, has a wholesale fish market where marine fish is traded every \nnight. The wholesale fish market in Sukabumi is mainly for freshwater live fish, including fry and \nfingerlings. \n \n2. \n \n \n \n11. \nAquaculture research currently focuses on the development of methods, techniques, and \nsystems for commodities with potential for commercial production. Product-processing research, \non  the  other  hand,  centers  on  adding  value  for  fisheries  and  aquatic  products  through  the \nadvanced  processing  techniques  and  quality  improvement.  Strategic  marine  and  fisheries \nresearch  is  the  main  responsibility  of  the  Agency  for  Marine  and  Fisheries  Research  (AMFR), \nwhich  has  three  research  institutes  under  its  Research  Center  for  Aquaculture,  one  each  for \nmariculture, freshwater aquaculture, and brackishwater aquaculture. \n \n12. \nEducation  and  Training.    MMAF  has  three  institutes  of  higher  learning  under  its \nadministration:  a  fisheries  institute  in  Jakarta,  an  aquaculture  academy  in  Sidoardjo  and  an \naquaculture  academy  in  Sorong.  Seven  fisheries  high  schools  train  middle-level  fisheries \npersonnel  and  field  extension  workers.  These  are  located  in  Aceh,  Kota  Agung,  Pariaman, \nTegal,  Bone,  Pontianak,  and  Ambon.  In  addition,  there  are  five  fisheries  training  centers\u2014in \nMedan, Tegal, Banyuwangi, Bitung, and Ambon. On average, each school produces at least 40 \nfisheries graduates per year with specialization in various fields. \n \n13. \nAutonomy  Law,  both \n\nExtension.    With  the  establishment  of  MMAF  and  the  passage  of  the  Regional \nto  district \n\nfisheries  extension  services  were  devolved \n\nResearch, Training, and Extension \n\nin  1999, \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nSector Issues \n\ngovernments. Depending on the relative importance of fisheries to the local economy, extension \nservices  have  either  been  performed  by  a  separate  fisheries  service  (i.e.,  the  Dinas  Kelautan \ndan Perikanan [district fisheries service]) or have been embedded within the Dinas for livestock \nand fisheries.1 As a result of devolution of fisheries extension to the local governments, there is \nno longer a national government agency that is primarily responsible for (i) formulating fisheries \nextension  policy,  (ii)  developing  programs  and  technical  guidelines,  (iii)  providing  technical \nguidance  for  extension  workers,  and  (iv)  carrying  out  strategic  extension  activities  with  inter-\nministerial ramifications. \n \n14. \nAt the local level, governments generally lack the preparation, resources, and capacity to \ntake  on  active  extension  and  coordination  roles.  The  organizational  structures  differ  from  one \ndistrict  to  another,  but  these  structures  are  usually  weak  and  lack  responsiveness  to  evolving \nfisher/fish farmer aspirations and needs. Extension workers suffer from low morale and lack of \nmotivation  resulting  from  deficiencies  in  job  design,  appraisal,  and  incentive  systems.  Human \nresource  systems,  including  selection,  deployment,  and  promotion,  are  also  deficient.  The \nextension  systems  for  aquaculture  lack  an  integrated,  cross-sector  approach,  and  the  level  of \naquaculture  technology  entering  the  formal  extension  system  is  severely  limited  because  of \nweak  extension\u2013research  linkages.  In  addition,  budgetary,  human  resource,  and  institutional \nlimitations have severely hampered the transfer of technology to poor fishers and fish farmers.  \n \nD. \n \n15. \nIndonesia\u2019s aquaculture subsector is confronted with numerous problems, most notably: \n(i)  high  incidence  of  poverty  among  small  fish  farmers,  (ii)  environmental  degradation,  (iii)  low \ngrowth and productivity caused by poor farm management and lack of good quality seeds, (iv) \nlack  of  credit  facilities  for  poor  fish  farmers,  (v)  lack  of  post-production  facilities  and  marketing \ninfrastructure, and (vi) lack of social preparation and inefficient extension services. The financial \ncrisis of 1997 further aggravated the accessibility of credit and effectively increased the prices of \nimported inputs like feeds and chemicals. \n \n16. \nThe  industry  suffers  from  low  productivity  as  a  result  of  technical,  economic,  and \nenvironmental  factors.  Small  fish  farmers  usually  practice  extensive  culture  using  low-yielding, \nlow-input, and low-level technology, and lack the technical know-how or skills to enable them to \nadopt new or improved production methods and techniques. Their problems are compounded, in \nsome areas, by the occurrence of fish or shrimp diseases, which are usually triggered by poor \nenvironmental  quality,  inferior  seed  quality,  poor  hatchery  and  culture  management,  and  other \nfactors.  Small-scale  fish  farmers  also  lack  sufficient  funds  to  shift  to  higher-density  farming  or \nhigher  value  commodities.  Problems  associated  with  aquaculture  business  ventures  (e.g.,  low \nproduction  performance,  disease  occurrence,  and  fluctuating  prices)  have  contributed  to  the \nimage of aquaculture as a high-risk industry. Financial institutions have therefore been reluctant \nto extend credit to fish farmers\u2014especially small fish farmers. Formal financial institutions also \ngenerally require collateral and proof of ability to repay loans, which small fish farmers lack. This \nleaves small fish farmers reliant on their own labor and meager financial resources to run their \nsubsistence  culture  operations.  If  they  do  manage  to  secure  loans,  it  is  usually  from  informal \nlending sources which don't require collateral but demand usurious interest rates. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  For example, among the districts selected for inclusion in the proposed Project, only Buton has a separate Dinas \nKelautan dan Perikanan; in the others, fisheries functions are carried out by the Dinas for livestock/agriculture and \nfisheries \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n31\n\n \n\nThe combination of factors outlined above has resulted in low incomes and poor quality \n17. \nof life for small fish farmers. Their incomes fall way below the national average, and they have \nlimited or no access to basic social services such as health, education, water supply, sanitation, \ntransport,  and  communication.  Literacy  levels  are  very  low,  mortality  and  morbidity  rates  are \nhigh, and more than one-third of small farmers and fishers live below the poverty line.  \n \n18. \nAside  from  the  above  technical  and  socioeconomic  issues,  there  are  policy,  legal,  and \ninstitutional constraints hampering the further development of aquaculture. In the area of policy \nand  legislation,  the  passage  of  Law  32/2004  on  Regional  Governance,  which  called  for  the \ndevolution of a number of fisheries management responsibilities from the central government to \nthe local governments, has various implications for the sector. Firstly, there is general ambiguity \nin the definition of roles of the central, provincial, and district governments, especially as those \nroles  pertain  to  marine  and  coastal  management.  Secondly,  the  responsibility  for  aquaculture \ndevelopment  and  spatial  planning  for  aquaculture  activities  now  lies  with  the  regional \ngovernments,  except  when  foreign  investments  are  involved,  in  which  case  DGA  review  and \nrecommendation are required prior to approval by the regional government concerned. Thirdly, \nwhile  the  central  government  retains  responsibility  for  formulating  criteria  for  determining  and \nchanging the land use of areas designated for aquaculture, the regional government makes the \nfinal  decision  on  whether  or  not  to  consider  such  criteria  in  the  preparation  of  their  regional \nspatial  plans.  Fourthly,  the  local  governments  that  are  suddenly  empowered  to  handle  such \ntechnical  responsibilities  lack  the  capacity  (in  terms  of  knowledge,  skills,  and  resources)  to \nadequately perform their tasks. \n \n19. \nFinally,  and  most  importantly,  with  the  devolution  of  fisheries  extension  to  the  local \ngovernments,  a  national  government  agency  no  longer  has  primary  responsibility  for  (i) \nformulating  fisheries  extension  policy,  (ii)  developing  extension  programs  and  technical \nguidelines, (iii) providing technical guidance to extension workers, and (iv) carrying out strategic \nextension  activities  with \nlocal \ngovernments generally lack the preparation, resources, and capacity to take on active extension \ndevelopment and coordination. The result is an extension organization that is structurally weak \nand  non-responsive  to  evolving  fish  farmer  needs.  The  extension  systems  for  aquaculture  in \nparticular  lack  an  integrated,  cross-sector  approach.  The  level  of  aquaculture  technology \nentering the formal extension system is severely limited by weak extension\u2013research linkages, \ninadequate technology adoption, and inadequate technology transfer to end-users. \n\ninter-ministerial  ramifications.

These \nlessons were used in the design of the proposed Project. \n \n\nTable A4: Lessons Learned and Design Features \n\n \nMajor Lessons Learned \nAppropriate  policies,  legal  instruments, \nand  regulations  can  contribute  toward \nremoving  constraints \nto  aquaculture \ndevelopment. \n\nAccess  to  a  reliable  fish  seed  supply  is \ncritical  to  fish  farming.  Strategic  linkages \nbetween fish-breeding centers and private \nhatcheries  and  nurseries  can  enable  fish \nfarmers  to  gain  access  to  a  range  of  fish \nseed. \n\nto \n\nThe  development  of  aquaculture  cannot \nbe  sustained  without  paying  close \nattention \nresource  management, \nenvironment, and aquatic health. \n \n \nSimple \n(low-capital  operation)  multi-\nspecies  culture  is  more  suited  to  small or \ncommunity fish farmer operations and can \nare more environmentally friendly. \n \n \nHigh-density  culture  of  shrimp  and  finfish \nrequires  wastewater  treatment  and  the \nsupport  of  laboratory  services  to  monitor \nthe  quality  of  water  and  applications  of \nseed and feed. \nfinancial  capital  (credit  or \nAccess \nproduction  inputs)  is  vital  to  small-scale \naquaculture  development  and  poverty \nreduction. \n \nFish \nin \nisolated  areas  where  essential  support \nservices  and  markets  are  absent.  Rural \nfacilitates  enable  market \ninfrastructure \naccess  and  market  expansion  for  goods \nand services. \n\nfarming  cannot  be  sustained \n\nto \n\nProject Design Features \n\nin \n\nand \n\ndistrict \n\ngovernments \n\nThe  Project  will  support \nthe  Directorate  General  of \nAquaculture  (DGA)  in  removing  the  inconsistencies  in \nexisting  laws  and  regulations  related  to  the  sector  and \nclarifying  the  functions  and  responsibilities  of  central. \nProvincial \nfisheries \nmanagement under the Decentralization Act 32 of 2004. \nThe Project includes: (i) establishment of community-based \nhatcheries  and  nurseries  for  a  variety  of  fish  and  aquatic \nspecies for aquaculture; (ii) rehabilitation and upgrading of \ndistrict  government  hatcheries  to  augment  the  fish  seed \nsupply  produced  by  private  hatcheries; \nthe  district \ngovernment  hatcheries  will  also  serve  for  demonstrations \nand  research  and  development  on  broodstock  and  fish \nseed  production;  and  (iii)  establishment  of \nlinkages \nbetween  private  hatcheries,  government  hatcheries,  and \naquaculture centers in seed production technology transfer \nand research and development. \nEnvironmental  management  and  protection \nis  a  key \nobjective of the Project. A range of remedial and preventive \nmeasures \nfor  aquaculture  sustainability  have  been \nincorporated  into  project  design  under  the  environmental \nand fish health management subcomponent. \n \nThe Project promotes (i) simple, low-input, multi-species or \npolyculture systems that will not harm the environment; and \n(ii)  the  use  of  more  disease-resistant  culture  species  to \nencourage  small-scale  operators  and  poor  beneficiaries\u2019 \nproduction. \n \nThe inclusion of wastewater treatment will be mandatory for \nhigh-density \nfinfish  culture  systems.  The  Project  will \nstrengthen  aquaculture  regulation  and  monitoring,  and \nexpand laboratory services for monitoring water quality and \nfish health.  \nThe  Project  will  not  have  any  credit  schemes,  but  will \naddress credit issues by improving the credit worthiness of \nfish \nthrough \ntechnical  support,  and  linking  them  with  existing  rural \nfinance schemes that are in operation in the project area. \nThe  Project  includes  the upgrading  or new construction  of \n(i)  fishpond  dikes  and  pathways  and  (ii)  access  roads \nleading to and from the major production areas. The latter \nwill  facilitate  the  transport  of  inputs  (fish  seed,  feed, \nfertilizers, and various supplies and materials) and outputs \n(fry/fingerlings  and  marketable  fish,  shrimp,  and  other \naquatic products).  \n\nfarmers/community-based  organizations \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nMajor Lessons Learned \nSmall-scale  fish  farmers  need  access  to \nextension  services \ntheir \nproduction  and  to  well-developed  market \ninformation systems for ensuring fair price \nof the produce. \n\nimproving \n\nfor \n\nPoverty reduction begins not so much with \nlarger  cash  incomes  but  with  access  to \nimproved  housing,  basic \nclean  water, \nsocial  services,  food  security,  and  health \neducation, among others. \nPhased  approaches  are  preferable  when \ndata,  skills,  or  experience  is  lacking,  or \nwhen introducing new concepts. \n\nPrivate  sector  participation  can  augment \nand  benefit  the  operations  of  small-scale \nand  artisanal  fish  farmers  and  facilitate \nsmall fish farmers\u2019 access to markets. \n\ncommunity-based \n\nBuilding  the  capacity  of  the  Government \nand \norganizations \n(CBOs) is essential to ensuring that ample \nsupport is provided to fish farmers in their \nproduction activities. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nProject Design Features \nThe aquaculture support services component of the project \nprovides  for  specific  measures  to  address  these  issues. \nThese include (i) establishment of demonstration farms and \ntraining  of  project  beneficiaries  on  improved  species  and \nculture  technologies,  and  environmental  and  fish  health \nmanagement;  and  (iii)  development  of  a  computerized \nmarket information system at the district level and linked to \nDGA  enabling  fish  farmers  and  private  enterprises  access \nto real-time data on market prices of aquaculture products, \nsupply and demand, and other market related information.     \nThe Project will make investments in vital social amenities, \nincluding clean, safe drinking water. \n\nto \n\nThe  Project  will  make  extensive  use  of  demonstration \nintroduce  and  promote  new  aquaculture \nfacilities \nsystems  and  practices  or  new  aquaculture  species. \nContinuing technical assistance will be provided to the fish \nfarmers  by  district  fisheries  and/or  community  extension \nworkers. \nThe  formal  private  sector  will  be  encouraged  to  invest  in \naquaculture-related  activities\u2014particularly  in  the  supply  of \ninputs and the marketing of produce. Other forms of private \nsector  participation  will  be  explored  during  project \nimplementation. \nThe  Project \nresource \ndevelopment and training program that targets central and \ndistrict  governments,  fish  farmers  organizations,  and  the \nin \nprivate  sector.  The  program  will  build  capacity \naquaculture development and management, environmental \nconservation, social development, and related fields. \n\nincludes  a  massive  human \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n35 \n\nCRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF SUBPROJECT SITES AND BENEFICIARIES \n \n\n1. \nThe five project districts were selected based on the following main criteria: (i) they have \ngood  potential  for  further  resource  development  and  are  in  need  of  improved  aquaculture \nsystems to raise productivity and protect the environment; (ii) they exhibit high poverty incidence \namong  the  agricultural  population (based  on  data  and  information  from  the  Central  Bureau  of \nStatistics, 2002); (iii) the district government is committed  to improving aquaculture production \nand  socioeconomic  conditions  for  fish  farmers;  and  (iv)  the  limited  financial  capacity  of  the \ndistrict government constrains further investment in aquaculture. \n \n2. \nWithin  each  district,  subdistricts  were  selected  based  mainly  on  the  aquatic  resource \nbase  and  its  potential  for  development,  and  on  the  socioeconomic  conditions  for  local  fish \nfarmers.  Within  an  identified  subdistrict,  it  is  the  district  government  and  the  local  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  that  will,  within  a  year  of  project  launch,  identify  villages  and  fish \nfarmers eligible to participate in the Project. The general criteria for selection of subprojects are \nshown in the following box: \n \nA. Selection Criteria for Culture Species \n\n1.  Species  must  have  been  previously  cultured  in  the  country  and  not  harm  indigenous \n\nspecies in the area. \n\n2.  Its rate of growth must be sufficiently high. \n3.  It must be able to reproduce successfully under culture conditions. \n4.  It must accept and thrive on abundant and cheap artificial feeds. \n5.  It must be acceptable to the target consumers. \n6.  It should be able to support a high population density in ponds or cages. \n7.  It must have a high resistance to disease. \n8.  Seeds must be available and easy to obtain. \n\n \nB. Selection Criteria for Technology to be Adopted \n\n1.  The  technology  should  be  simple,  low-cost,  and  low-level  to  facilitate  transfer  to,  and \n\nadoption by, fish farmers and have greater chances of success. \n\n2.  More  complex  technologies  which  require  higher  capital  and  other  inputs  are  better \nsuited  to  medium-  and  large-scale  private  entrepreneurs  with  the  capability  to  engage \nthe services of technical specialists in running their operations. \n\n \nC. Criteria for the Siting of Brackishwater Aquaculture and Mariculture Subprojects \n\n1.  The subproject should not be located in environmentally critical areas, such as protected \n\nforests, marine sanctuaries, or nature reserves.  \n\n2.  The subproject should not involve the conversion of mangrove forests into fishponds. \n3.  The subproject should not involve the destruction of coastal habitats such as coral reefs \n\nand seagrass beds and associated flora and fauna. \n\n4.  Ample  attention  must  be  paid  to  site  selection,  culture  installation  design,  and  the \n\nmanagement of culture operations to preserve the integrity of the environment.  \n\n5.  Integrated  aquaculture, such  as  maintaining  of mangroves  along  fishpond  dikes  and  in \n\nnearby areas, should be encouraged for environmental conservation. \n6.  The subproject will involve minimal land acquisition and resettlement. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n3. \nThe selection of project beneficiaries will be based on criteria to be detailed during the \nfirst year of implementation. A preliminary list of selection criteria for small-scale fish farmers to \nbe  eligible  to  participate  in  the  Project  includes  the  following:  (i)  must  belong  to  \u201cpoor  income \ngroups\u201d  as  defined  in  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  and  Annual \nDevelopment Plan; (ii) must belong to organized fish farmer groups; (iii) must have some prior \nexperience  in  fish  farming;  (iv)  must  be  willing  to  undergo  training  in  improved  methods  and \npractices of aquaculture; (v) must be willing to share their new skills with other fish farmers in \nthe community; and (vi) must be willing to be supervised and monitored by project personnel. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n37 \n\nPROPOSED PRODUCTION-ORIENTED ACTIVITIES AT THE PROJECT SITES \n \n\nSpecies \n\nCommon carp  \n(Cyprinus carpio) \n\nNile tilapia  \n(Oreochromis niloticus) \n\nProduction System \n\nSeed production (hatchery and nursery) \nand growout in ponds, floating cages, and \npaddy fields \nSeed production (hatchery and nursery) \nand growout in ponds, floating cages \n\nProject Site \nSumedang \n\nSumedang  \n\nActivities \n \nProduction by fish \nfarmers organizations \n \nTraining, extension, \nand production inputs \nassistance \n\n \n\ne\nr\nu\nt\nl\nu\nc\na\nu\nq\nA\n \nr\ne\nt\na\nw\nh\ns\ne\nr\nF\n\n \ne\nr\nu\nt\nl\nu\nc\na\nu\nq\nA\n \nr\ne\nt\na\nw\nh\ns\ni\nk\nc\na\nr\nB\n\n \ne\nr\nu\nt\nl\nu\nc\ni\nr\na\nM\n\nDemonstration \n\nResearch \n\nAsian catfish  \n(Pangasius \nhypophthalmus) \nFreshwater giant prawn \n(Macrobrachium \nrosenbergii) \nAsian catfish  \n(Pangasius \nhypophthalmus) \n\nCage culture \n\nSeed production (hatchery and nursery) \nand growout in ponds; Integrated rice-\nprawn farming \nSeed production \n\nProduction by fish \nfarmers organizations \n \nTraining, extension, \nand production inputs \nassistance  \n\nMilkfish \n(Chanos chanos) \nShrimp \n \n\nShrimp \n \n\nMonoculture in ponds or polyculture with \nshrimp  \nSeed production and growout in ponds, in \npolyculture with milkfish  \n\nSeed production and growout in ponds  \n\nResearch \n\nCrab fattening in traditional ponds (tambak) \n\nSoft shell mangrove crab \n\nCrab floating cage  \n\nPond polyculture \n\nMangrove crab  \n(Scylla serrata) \nMilkfish (C. chanos) and \nshrimp  \nOyster (Crassostrea spp.)  Off-bottom culture \nCulture in tambak \nFreshwater giant prawn \n(M. rosenbergii) \nGrouper \nfuscoguttatus) \n\nCulture in tambak \n\n(Epinephelus \n\nProduction by fish \nfarmers organizations \n \nTraining, extension, \nand production inputs \nassistance  \n\nResearch \n\n(Perna \n\n(Epinephelus \n\nSeaweed  \n(Eucheuma cottonii) \nGrouper \nspp., Cromileptis altivelis) \nGreen  mussel \nviridis) \nGrouper  \n(Epinephelus spp.) \nSea cucumber  \n(Holothuria spp.)  \nSwimming crab \nAbalone (Haliotis asinina) \nLobster (Panulirus spp) \n\nRaft, longline culture \n\nSeed production (hatchery and nursery) \nand growout in cages \nRaft culture \n\nSeed production (hatchery and nursery) \nand growout in floating net cages \nStock enhancement/culture-based fisheries \n\nPen culture \nPen and cage culture   \nPen and cage culture \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank and the Government.\n\nOgan \nKomering Ilir \n\nSumedang \n\nOgan \nKomering Ilir \n\nKarawang \n \nKarawang, \nOgan \nKomering Ilir \nLangkat, \nOgan \nKomering Ilir \nKarawang \n \nOgan \nKomering Ilir \nOgan \nKomering Ilir \nKarawang \nKarawang \n\nKarawang, \nOgan \nKomering Ilir \nButon \n \nButon \n\nButon, \nKarawang \nButon, \nKarawang \nButon  \n\nButon \nButon \nButon \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\nItem \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n\nTable A7.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category  \n($ million) \n\nTotal Cost \n\n% of Total Base Cost \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n32\n31\n6\n1\n\na.

The  economic \nanalysis  provides  the  economic  rationale  of  the  Project  and  determines  its  economic  viability. \nThe financial analysis examines the financial sustainability of the selected subproject schemes \nfrom the fish farmers\u2019 point of view. \n \nA. \n\nMajor Assumptions \n\nThe economic analysis is based on the assumptions outlined in the following sections: \n\n2. \n \n\n \n\n1. \n\nPrices \n\n3. \nFinancial  benefits  and  costs  are  estimated  in  constant  2006  prices.  All  prices  are \nexpressed at the world market price level in the national currency. Financial farmgate prices are \nbased on findings of surveys undertaken during the feasibility study in 2004 and adjusted to the \ninflation rate. For this analysis, the prevailing interbank exchange rate of Rp9,000 per US dollar \nis used; opportunity cost of capital is assumed at 12%. \n \nLabor  costs  have  been  shadow-priced  at  0.65  of  the  wage  rates,  while  nontradable \n4. \ninputs  have  been  adjusted  by  the  standard  conversion  factor  (SCF)  of  0.90.  The  financial \nanalysis  considers  only  hired  labor,  while  the  economic  analysis  includes  estimations  of  both \nfamily and hired labor.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPeriod of Economic Analysis \n\nThe  economic  life  of  the  Project  is  assumed  to  be  20  years,  from  2007  to  2026.  The \n\n \n5. \nmajor project activities will be implemented over a 6-year period from 2007 to 2013.      \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Economic Costs \n\nThe economic costs of the Project are estimated at $38.82 million.1 The economic price \n\n \n6. \nof land was calculated by adjusting the prevailing market prices by the SCF.   \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Economic Benefits \n\n \n7. \nThe Project will promote the establishment and development of aquaculture enterprises \nby providing technical skills development to fish farmers, improving infrastructure and marketing \nsupport to the fish farmers, and strengthening extension services and policies and regulations \nfor aquaculture and related activities.  \n \n8. \nAquaculture products are usually purchased live by traders at the farm site. A portion of \nthese products is sold to retailers (either live or fresh) at local markets within the district. The rest \nis sold to other urban markets such as Jakarta, Palembang, Medan, Bandung, and Surabaya, or \ndirectly  to  exporters  who  ship  the  commodities  to  international  markets.  There  are,  however, \nsome  prevailing  site-specific  constraints  that  cause  inefficiencies  in  the  marketing  flow  in  the \n\n                                                 \n1   The  economic  costs  of  the  Project  were  derived  from  subtracting  the  price  contingencies  and  transfer  payments \n\n(taxes and duties) from the financial total project costs.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\ndistricts.  These  include:  (i)  the  poor  condition  of  pathways  and  farm-to-market  roads  at  farm \nsites, particularly in shrimp production areas such as OKI, Karawang, and Langkat; (ii) the large \nnumber  of  small  fish  farmers,  which  makes  it  difficult  and  costly  for  traders  to  assemble  fish \nproducts; (iii) a lack of fish receiving and marketing stations where farmers and traders can meet \nand transact business; and (v) a lack of proper seaweed-drying facilities. These constraints have \ncontributed to high procurement costs\u2014specifically transportation costs\u2014among traders, which \nhave  resulted  in  smaller  margins  relative  to  those  received  by  farmers.  In  the  \u2018without  Project\u2019 \nscenario,  it  is  assumed  that  these  factors  continue  to  constrain  aquaculture  sector  growth; \nhence,  production  levels  remain  the  same.  In  the  \u2018with  Project\u2019  scenario,  fish  production  is \nexpected to grow at 6.4% annually.  \n \n9. \nIn  the  \u201dwith  Project\u201d  scenario,  the  main  quantifiable  benefit  will  be  in  the  form  of \nincremental  aquaculture  production.  By  improving  access  infrastructure  and  fish  post-harvest \nand processing facilities, promoting competitive fish/shrimp hatcheries and nurseries to support \nseed  requirements,  and  providing  marketing  support,  the  Project  will  significantly  reduce \ntransaction costs and increase farmgate prices of aquaculture products. The introduction of new \nculture  techniques  or  new  aquaculture  commodities  through  pilot  demonstrations,  based  on \napplied research results, will improve aquaculture yields.  \n \n10. \nApart  from  aquaculture  production  benefits,  the  Project  will  generate  a  number  of \nbenefits that are not readily quantifiable. Community organizing and institutional strengthening of \ndistrict  governments  are  among  the  most  important  elements  of  project  design.  The \nstrengthening of extension services will enhance the sustainability of aquaculture by improving \nthe provision of continuous technical support and training to fish farmers. The establishment of \nresearch\u2013extension  linkages  between  provincial  and  district  fisheries  services,  which  will \nfacilitate  the  commercial  application  of  research  results  by  fish  farmers,  is  expected  to  lead  to \nadditional improvements in aquaculture productivity at project sites. The training of fish farmers \nand  demonstrations  of  various  aquaculture  systems  will  not  only  lead  to  the  establishment  of \nsmall-scale  enterprises  by  fish  farmers,  but  will  also  provide  technically  educated  labor  for \nmedium-scale enterprises. The improvements in financial returns for aquaculture enterprises as \na result of project activities should lead to more private sector participation. \n \nThe  Project  will  also  result  in:  (i)  environmental  benefits  arising  from  improved \n11. \naquaculture resources management at the district and village levels; (ii) improved nutrition and \nhealth  of  rural  populations  from  increases  in  food  supply  -  especially  in  animal  protein;  (iii) \nenhanced inter-agency and public-private sector linkages through strengthened partnerships in \naquaculture  development;  and  (iv)  empowerment  of  small  fish  farmers  and  rural  communities \nwith  knowledge  and  skills  in  community-based  aquaculture  and  culture-based  fisheries \nmanagement. \n  \nB. \n\nAssessment of Financial Returns to Fish Farmers \n\n12. \nPrior  to  being  promoted  in  the  project  sites,  the  commercial  viability  of  each  type  of \nactivity  will  be  assessed  through  site  selection  criteria.  To  determine  their  financial  viability,  a \nfinancial analysis for five representative activities at the farm level will be undertaken (grouper \ncage  culture,  mudcrab  fattening,  seaweed  production,  carp  ponds  culture,  and  tiger-shrimp \ncultivation).  All  of  the  representative  aquaculture  activities  exhibit  financial  returns  that \nsignificantly exceed the prevailing financial cost of capital of 22% (Table A12.1). Detailed fish-\nfarm budgets are presented in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n49 \n\n \nItem \n\n \n\n \n\nSensitivity  Analysis.  Sensitivity  analysis  is  undertaken  to  determine  the  effect  of \n13. \nidentified  risk  factors  that  may  have  adverse  impacts  on  the  financial  performance  of  these \nactivities. For purposes of the analysis, three major risks are considered: (i) increase in variable \ncosts  (feeds,  fish  seed,  fertilizers,  other  production  materials,  and  labor);  (ii)  decrease  in \nrevenues  resulting  from  production  shortfalls  or  a  decline  in  farmgate  output  prices  (various \nfactors could cause such a decline, such as an increase in marketing or transportation costs); \nand  (iii)  occurrence  of  disease  every  two  years  (which  would  decrease  output  10\u201350% \ndepending  on  the  cultivated  fish  species).  The  analysis  indicates  that  it  would  take  serious \nadverse  impacts  for  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  to  decline  to  the  prevailing \nweighted financial cost of capital of 22% (Table A12.1). \n \n\nTable A12.1: Financial Returns on Aquaculture Enterprises \n\nFIRR (%) \nBase \nCase \n\nSwitching Values (%) \n\nIncrease in \nVariable \nCosts \n13.5 \n41.2 \n80.9 \n\nDecrease in total revenue \n(postharvest losses, \ndecrease in price) \n10.6 \n25.4 \n23.3 \n\nFIRR (%) \nImpact of occurrence \nof disease every two \nyears \n42 \n \n29 \n\n74.9 \n13.3 \n\n29.3 \n10.3 \n\n37 \n26 \n\n47 \n66 \n39 \n\nGrouper cage culture (Buton) \nMud crab fattening (Langkat) \nCarp pond culture \n(Sumedang) \nShrimp culture (Karawang) \nSeaweed culture (Buton) \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE. \n\n50 \n44 \n\nAssessment of Economic Returns \n\n14. \n To  determine  the  economic  viability  of  the  Project,  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n(EIRR)  values are estimated for representative aquaculture activities. All costs are in constant \nyear  2005  terms.  The  project  costs,  excluding  the  price  contingencies  and  interest  during \nconstruction,  are  appropriately  apportioned  to  individual  schemes.  The  prices  of  nontradable \ngoods  were  adjusted  to  the  world  price  level  by  the  SCF.  Results  of  the  economic  analysis, \nsummarized in Table A12.2, show that EIRR values for individual schemes range from 15% to \n21%, which provide an indicative range for the Project\u2019s overall EIRR. \n \n\nTable A12.2: Anticipated Scheme Level Economic Worth \n\nScheme \n\nEIRR (%) \n\nGrouper Cage \n(Buton) \n16 \n\nMud Crab \n(Langkat) \n21 \n\nCarp Culture \n(Sumedang) \n15 \n\nTiger Shrimp \n(Karawang) \n19 \n\nSeaweed \n(Buton) \n20 \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nDistribution of Project Benefits \n\n \nF. \n \nProject  benefits  will  accrue  to  three  distinct  groups:  (i)  producers,  (ii)  associate service \n15. \nproviders,  and  (iii)  consumers.  The  Project  will  have  direct  impacts  on  producers  and  indirect \nimpacts on associated service providers of inputs such as seed, chemicals, and other supplies, \nas  well  as  on  the  transport  industry.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  contribute  to  national  food \nsecurity and provide a key source of protein to low income households. \n \n16. \nThe  selection  criteria  for  subproject  sites  and  beneficiaries  require  beneficiaries  to  be \npoor (Appendix 5). According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, the average poverty and near \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\npoverty lines for 2004 were Rp5,218,800 and Rp6,652,560, respectively. The indirect benefits of \nthe  project  accrue  to  poor  and  non-poor  households.  The  poor  provide  transportation  and \nprocessing  services.  The  non-poor  are  sometimes  owners  of  these  services.    As  the \nassessment of the feasibility of this investment and the cost-benefit analysis only consider direct \nproject  impacts,  this  assessment  of  benefits  will  focus  only  on  the  outcomes  for  direct  project \nbeneficiaries.  \n \n17. \nThe Project will directly benefit more than 14,000 households (Table A12.3). The Project \nwill  also  generate  additional  employment  opportunities  as  a  result  of  increased  demand  for \ntransportation and fish-processing activities. Returns for households will depend primarily on the \ntype of activity they adopt, which in turn will be determined by the production potential of their \narea  (Table  A12.4).  Table  A12.5  compares  pre-project  and  post-project  income  for  the  three \ngroups  of  producers.  The  majority  of  households,  which  are  involved  in  groups  2  and  3 \nproduction activities will be firmly non poor. Only group 1 households, which produce seaweed \nand engage in polyculture, will remain near poor and vulnerable to shock.  \n \n\nTable A12.3: Estimated Annual Production-Related Employment \n\nItems \n\n \n\nA.

Aside from contributing about one-fifth of \nthe  country\u2019s  estimated  total  fish  production,  the  aquaculture  subsector  has  been  providing  employment  to  some \n2.2 million  people,  representing  around  40%  of  the  total  number  of  people  employed  in  the  fisheries  sector. \nAquaculture  also  absorbs  much  of  the  growing  labor  force  that  enters  the  job  market  each  year,  cushioning  the \neconomic hardships faced by people seeking gainful employment. \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe country's  aquaculture subsector suffers from low productivity  as a result of technical, \neconomic,  and  environmental  factors.  Small-scale  fish  farmers  usually  practice  extensive \nculture,  which  gives  low  yields.  These  problems  are  compounded  by  the  high  prices  of \nimported  production \nfacilities  and  market \ninfrastructure.  In  some  areas,  there  have  been  outbreaks  of  fish  and  shrimp  disease, \nusually  triggered  by  poor  environmental  quality,  inferior  seed  quality,  and  poor  hatchery \nand culture management. Small-scale fish farmers also lack funds to shift to higher density \nfarming  or  higher-value  commodities,  and  cannot  access  credit  from  local  banks  and \nfinancial  institutions.  The  combination  of  these  factors  has  resulted  in  low  incomes  and \npoor quality of life for small-scale fish farmers. \n \nBased on results of the socioeconomic survey of selected households, the average poverty \nincidence  among  fish-farmer  households  in  the  five  project  districts  is  estimated  at  34%. \nThis figure is higher than the official Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) estimate of overall \npoverty  incidence  in  the  five  districts,  which  is  20.2%.  This  shows  that  the  aquaculture \nsector in project districts is disproportionately poor compared with other economic sectors. \nLow incomes have led to a certain amount of deprivation within fish-farming households, as \ndemonstrated  by  the  following  statistics:  (i)  66%  of  households  have  poor  access  to  and \nlow utilization of quality health care and clinical services; (ii) 61% of families lack sustained \naccess  to  a  safe  water;  (iii)  local  kids  get  an  average  of  only  5.5  years  of  schooling  (the \nfigure  is  lower  for  young  girls);  (iv)  32%  of  children  under  5  years  have  substandard \nnutritional  status;  and  (v)  more  than  50%  of  women  primarily  work  at  unpaid  jobs, \ndemonstrating a lack of income-generating opportunities in these communities.1 \n \nTo  address  the  poverty  issues  confronting  the  small-scale  fish  farmers  and  their \nhouseholds, the Project will introduce them to improved, sustainable, environment-friendly \naquaculture practices and techniques. The Project will provide small-scale fish farmers with \ntechnical  and  financial  assistance  to  launch  and  sustain  small  but  income-generating \naquaculture enterprises. Organizations of fish farmers\u2014including women fish farmers\u2014will \nbe  strengthened.  And  fish  farmers  will  improve  their  skills  and  knowledge  of  aquaculture \ntechnologies with the help of extension workers and the support of the local fisheries office. \nC.  Participation Process \n\n   No  \n   No \n\n  Yes \n   Yes               \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nIs there a participation strategy? \nThe  Project  followed  a  participatory  approach  in  its  formulation.  The  project  framework  and  overall  design  were \ndeveloped through a series of workshops, consultations, and discussions at the central, district, subdistrict, and village \nlevels. Household surveys, supplemented by focus group discussions, were conducted in sample villages where poor \naquaculture households made up the majority of respondents. The results of the workshops and consultations, as well \nas  the  local-level  household  surveys,  were  used  as  inputs  in  project  design.  Provisions  were  made  to  encourage \nparticipation in all the major project activities, especially in the refinement of the appropriate Project outputs for each \ndistrict. Most project activities at the local level will be implemented by local governments and the Dinas Kelautan dan \nPerikanan  (district  fisheries  services)  in  collaboration  with  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  and  assisted  by \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), thus enhancing local ownership of the Project. \nDuring the Project\u2019s social preparation stage, an in-depth participatory rural appraisal will be conducted in each of the \ndistricts  and  subdistricts.  The  detailed  work  plan  for  each  area  will  take  into  consideration  the  results  of  the  rural \nappraisal. Village-level planning for project implementation will be spearheaded by the CBOs, and communities will be \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n53 \n\nrepresented in decision-making structures at the local level. CBOs and organized fish-farmer groups, as well as other \ncommunity members, will be key players in the implementation of specific interventions in aquaculture production and \nmicroenterprise development.  The stakeholder analysis and participation plan are in Supplementary Appendix E. \n\nD.  Gender Development \n\nStrategy to maximize positive impacts on women: \nThe  Project  will  support  poor  women  in  gaining  access  to  resources,  technical  assistance,  and  capacity-building \nefforts  for  poverty  reduction  and  food  security.  Women  will  be  included  in  all  project  activities,  including  production-\ninputs assistance and training programs. Likewise,  women will be encouraged to participate in setting up, operating, \nand  managing  small-scale,  culture-based  fishery  enterprises.  The  strengthening  of  women\u2019s  groups  will  ensure \nequitable  opportunities  for  women  to  be  represented  and  assume  leadership  positions  in  decision-making  bodies, \nespecially  at  the  local  level.  To  assure  that  gender  concerns  are  addressed  not  only  by  the  Project  but  also  in  the \nwider  areas  of  education,  nutrition,  and  child  care,  gender  specialists  will  be  hired  to  conduct  gender  training  to \nsensitize local government officials and extension personnel of the Dinas Kelautan dan Perikanan to women\u2019s needs \nand sociocultural issues.  \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \n \nGender Participation Target \n \nComponents/Activities \n \n\nGender Approach and Target \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\nSocial Preparation and Community Empowerment \n\nAquaculture Production Enhancement \n\nLivelihood Opportunities \n\nFish Marketing Development \n\nIncremental Staffing  \n\n \nE.

Since \nthe identification of specific aquaculture production activities and the final selection of sites for \nthose  activities  will  be  made  only  during  project  implementation,  a  generic  IEE  was  prepared. \nAn  environmental  screening  of  the  project  components  and  proposed  interventions  was \nconducted to determine whether they would require an environmental impact assessment (EIA) \nor whether an IEE would suffice. The IEE was carried out in accordance with the Environmental \nAssessment  Requirements  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (2003).  The  checklists  used  for \ndetermining  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  prototype  interventions  are  provided  in \nADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Agricultural and Natural Resources Development \nProjects (1991). \n \nB. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nThe  proposed  Project  will  promote  the  adoption  of  sustainable,  community-managed \n2. \naquaculture in five districts. It will address existing problems within the Indonesian aquaculture \nindustry  and  tap  the  vast  potential  of  the  country\u2019s  aquaculture  resources,  thereby  reducing \npoverty and ensuring food security among fish-farming communities in rural inland and coastal \nareas.  The  Project  will  focus  on  the  development  and  demonstration  of  small-scale,  low-cost, \nlow-input  aquaculture  production  systems  that  are  economically  sound,  environment  friendly, \nand capable of being easily replicated by fish farmers organizations and small- to medium-scale \nprivate  entrepreneurs.  The  Project  will  promote  and \nfacilitate  partnerships  and  other \narrangements  between  small  fish  farmers  and  commercial  private  sector  operators  in  order  to \nensure  ready  markets  for  their  produce  and  easy  access  to  production  inputs.  It  will  likewise \nprovide massive technical and extension support for fish farmer beneficiaries in order to ensure \nsuccessful implementation, and include innovative mechanisms to assist organized fish farmer \ngroups with their production inputs requirement. Through its institutional strengthening activities, \nthe Project will assist DGA and the participating district governments in building their technical \ncapacity  to  support  the  needs  of  the  beneficiaries,  their  communities,  and  the  Indonesian \naquaculture industry as a whole. \n \n3. \nThe Project will be implemented in five districts in four provinces, namely: (i) Langkat in \nNorth  Sumatera  Province;  (ii)  Ogan  Komering  Ilir  (OKI)  in  South  Sumatera  Province;  (iii) \nKarawang  and  Sumedang  in  West  Java  Province;  and  (iv)  Buton  in  Southeast  Sulawesi \nProvince.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  by  DGA  and  the  participating  district  governments \nover a six-year period (2007-2012) at a total cost of about $45 million equivalent. It will comprise \nthree  components,  namely:  (i)  Aquaculture  Production  Enhancement,  (ii)  Aquaculture  Support \nServices, and (iii) Institutional Strengthening and Project Management. The main interventions \nand principal parties involved in implementation of each of these components are summarized \nin Table A14.1. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nTable A14.1: Project Components, Interventions, and Implementation Responsibilities \n\nComponent \nAquaculture \nProduction \nEnhancement \nComponent \n\nMain Interventions \n\nImplementation Responsibilities \n\n\u2022  Rehabilitation/improvement of freshwater \n\n\u2022  Communities with DFS support and NGO \n\n\u2022  Construction/establishment of fish/shrimp \n\n\u2022  Communities with support from DFS, PIUs, \n\nand brackishwater fishponds \n\nhatcheries  \n\nassistance  \n\nand CEWs \n\n\u2022  Upgrading/expansion of district \n\n\u2022  District governments, DFS, PIUs with \n\ngovernment hatcheries \n\nconsultant assistance \n\nAquaculture \nSupport Services \nComponent \n\n\u2022  Establishment of demonstration facilities \n\nfor various aquaculture production systems \n\n\u2022  Training of fish farmers \n\u2022 \n\nImprovement of environmental \nmanagement and conservation \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  Establishment of stock enhancement sites \nand community-managed, culture-based \nfisheries \nImprovement of fish/shrimp/seaweed post-\nharvest and processing facilities \n\u2022  Market development and promotion \n\u2022  Provision of production inputs assistance \n\u2022  Strengthening and provision of extension \n\n\u2022  Conduct of applied research \n\u2022  Provision of social infrastructure facilities \n\nassistance \n\nservices \n\nand services \n\n\u2022  District governments, DFS, PMO,  PIUs \n\u2022  NGOs, CBOs, DFS, CEWs \n\u2022  DFS, district governments, NGOs, \n\ncommunities, PMO, PIUs  \n\n\u2022  District governments, PIUs, NGOs with \n\nassistance from consultants \n\n\u2022  Communities with DFS support and NGO \n\nassistance \n\n\u2022  PMO, PIUs, DFS with consultant assistance \n\u2022  District governments, DFS, PIUs, with \n\nassistance from NGOs and consultants \n\u2022  PMO, PIUs, DFS, CEWs with consultant \n\n\u2022  Academic/research institutions with support \n\nfrom DGA and AMFR \n\n\u2022  DFS, PIUs, communities with assistance \n\nfrom PMO, PIUs, and consultants \n\nInstitutional \nStrengthening and \nProject \nManagement \nComponent \n \n\n\u2022  Capacity building of  DGA, district DFS, \n\n\u2022  PMO and PIU consultants with assistance \n\nand fish farmer organizations \n\nfrom NGOs \n\n\u2022  Training \n\u2022  Facility upgrading of district government \n\n\u2022  NGOs, PMO/PIU consultants \n\u2022  DFS with assistance from PMO, PIUs, and \n\n\u2022  Aquaculture policy formulation and \n\n\u2022  DGA, district government with consultant \n\nhatcheries, etc. \n\nregulation \n\nsystem \n\n\u2022  Aquaculture management information \n\n\u2022  Establishment of PMO and PIUs  \n\u2022  Consulting services, NGO services, and \n\nother service contractors \n\n\u2022  Routine project management, including \nprocurement, disbursement, and M&E, \nreporting. \n\nconsultants \n\nassistance \n\n\u2022  DGA/PMO with consultant assistance \n\u2022  DGA, district governments \n\u2022  DGA/PMO, district governments/PIUs  \n\u2022  PMO and PIUs with assistance from \n\nconsultants \n\nAMFR  =  Agency  for  Marine  and  Fisheries  Research,  CBO  =  community-based  organization,  CEW  =  community-\nbased  extension  worker,  DFS  =  district  fisheries  service,  DGA  =  Directorate  General  of  Aquaculture,  M&E  = \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  NGO  =  nongovernment  organization,  PMO  =  project  management  office,  PIU  =  project \nimplementation unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe  first  step  in  predicting  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  proposed  project  activities \nwas  to  screen  and  categorize  them  according  to  the  magnitude  and  scale  of  their  potential \nadverse  impacts  on  the  environment.

Those activities which are classified under Category C \n(unlikely  to  have  adverse  environmental  impacts)  were  no  longer  subjected  to  checklist \nscreening.  The  ADB  checklist  showed  that  most  project  activities  under  Category  B  are  not \nexpected  to  result  in  significant  adverse  impacts.  However,  there  could  be  small  or  moderate \nimpacts resulting from site selection, construction, or operation. These potential impacts and the \ncorresponding mitigation measures are summarized in Table A14.3.  \n \nD. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\n \n\nInstitutional  Arrangements.  As  the  specific  subprojects  for  implementation  under  the \n6. \nProject  have  yet  to  be  identified  and  the  subproject  sites  yet  to  be  selected,  a  preliminary \nenvironmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  (EMP)  was  prepared  as  part  of  the  IEE.  The \nEMP  includes  general  environmental  guidelines  and  criteria  for  subproject  selection,  and \nindicates the environmental management costs incorporated into the project budget. However, \nbecause environmental monitoring is an ongoing activity, and because the EMP needs to allow \nfor  future  modifications  based  on  real  time  requirements,  it  will  be  prepared  by  the  project \nmanagement  office  (PMO),  with  the  assistance  of  an  environment  specialist,  at  the  Project\u2019s \ninception stage. The EMP will be implemented by technical personnel from the PIUs and district \nfisheries services, as well as NGOs and CBOs, under the supervision of the district environment \nservice (Dinas Lingkungan Hidup) and with assistance from the environment specialist.  \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \nTable A14.3: Summary of Potential Impacts and Suggested Mitigation Measures \n\nPrototype Interventions \nRehabilitation/renovation \nor new construction of \nland-based fish/shrimp \nhatcheries, nurseries and \nrearing ponds \n\nPotential Impacts \nDuring construction:  \nDust and noise \nDuring operation:  \n(cid:131)  Disease hazards \n(cid:131)  Downstream water \n\npollution \n\nEstablishment of \nmariculture facilities (fish \ncages, seaweed, mollusk \nrafts, etc.) \n\nRelated to site \nselection: \n(cid:131)  Conflicts with other \n\nuses (e.g., navigation) \n\n \n(cid:131)  Cost of importing \nneeded feeds \n\nProper construction planning;

Environmental  screening  and  IEE  preparation  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the \nPMO  and  PIUs,  with  assistance  from  the  environment  specialist.  The  ANDAL  reports  will  be \nsubmitted for approval to the respective district environment services in the five project districts. \n \n\n8. \nWater  quality  monitoring  forms  will  be  designed  by  the  environment  specialist,  and  an \nenvironmental  monitoring  subsystem  will  be  incorporated  as  a  subsystem  of  the  aquaculture \nmanagement  information  system  (AMIS)  to  be  designed  and  installed  in  DGA.  The  results  of \nenvironmental monitoring done at the field level will be compiled at the PIUs and transmitted to \nDGA for storage and easy retrieval in the AMIS. As the PIUs will be linked to the central AMIS \ndatabase through a wide area network (WAN), data accessibility should not be a problem. \n\n \n\n9. \nEnvironmental  Monitoring.  The  monitoring  program  will  determine  the  extent  of \nvariations in the levels of environmental indicators. Baseline conditions will be measured prior to \nthe  establishment  of  project  facilities  in  an  area.  The  regular  monitoring  program  will  be \nformulated  thereafter  with  the  baseline  conditions  serving  as  minimum  parameters  to  be \nmonitored to evaluate the effects of project activities. \n \n10.  Water quality monitoring will be conducted in (i) fishponds, supply and drainage canals, \nand  surrounding  areas;  (ii)  aquaculture  production  sites  in  freshwater,  brackishwater,  and \nmarine  areas;  and  (iii)  areas  where  water  from  fishponds,  fish  processing,  and  other  village \nactivities is discharged. The following essential water quality parameters should be monitored, \nat  least  on  a  quarterly  basis:  (i)  pH;  (ii)  dissolved  oxygen;  (iii)  biochemical  oxygen  demand \n(BOD);  (iv)  nutrient  concentration  (nitrates,  nitrites,  ammonia,  phosphates);  (v)  suspended \nsolids;  and  (vi)  organochlorine  residues.  In  open  waters,  water  samples  should  be  collected \nregularly  from  sampling  sites  within  the  project  area  and  examined  in  the  laboratory.  The \nsampling frequency will vary with the type of operation. Analysis of water samples will be done \nwith  water  quality  test  kits  provided  by  the  Project  to  laboratories  in  the  participating  districts. \nPortable test kits will also be provided to local DKP technical personnel for routine monitoring of \nwater  quality  in  the  private  sector  hatcheries  and  growout  farms.  Water  quality  monitoring \nresults will be compared with both the official water quality standards established by the Menteri \nNegara Kepundudukan dan Lingkungan Hidup and the international water quality standards set \nby the World Health Organization. This is necessary to determine whether an indicator exceeds \nmaximum allowable levels. \n \nE. \n \n11. \nIn line with the participatory approach to project planning and preparation, numerous key \ninterviews, local-level consultations, focus group discussions, and national and local workshops \nwere organized and conducted at the five project sites between February and April 2004. These \nfocus  group  discussions  and  workshops  were  designed  to  determine  the  most  pressing \nconcerns  of  stakeholders  and  to  obtain  stakeholder  input  for  consideration  in  project  design. \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nConclusions  \n\nEnvironmental  issues  and  concerns  figured  prominently  into  the  discussions  and  triggered  the \nincorporation of environmental improvement measures in the project design. \n \nF. \n \n12. \nThe initial examination  of likely environmental impacts of the proposed Project showed \nthat  none  of  the  prototype  interventions  is  environmentally  critical  or  projected  to  create \nsignificant  adverse  or  negative  impacts  on  the  environment.  Only  a  few  minor  environmental \nimpacts are likely as a result of factors related to site selection, construction, and operation, but \nthese  are  small  and  avoidable  or  mitigable.  Construction-related  impacts  are  localized  and \ntemporary in nature and could be minimized through careful planning and the adoption of proper \nconstruction practices. Some potential impacts related to the operation of mariculture and land-\nbased aquaculture facilities have been identified, but environmental safeguards have been built \ninto the project design to mitigate against these likely negative effects. \n \n13. \nOverall,  the  Project  is  not  expected  to  result  in  significant  environmental  impacts. \nInstead,  the  Project  is  likely  to  bring  about  positive  benefits  in  the  form  of  (i)  increased \nproduction   of  fish, shrimp,  mollusks,  and  seaweeds  through  environment-friendly,  sustainable \naquaculture;  (ii)  enhancement  of  natural  stocks  of  fish  and  other  valuable  species,  whose \npopulations  have  been  overfished;  (iii)  improved  quality  of  fish  for  human  consumption;  (iv) \nimproved health, hygiene, and environmental sanitation among local community residents at the \nfive project sites as a result of the provision of potable water and public toilets; and (v) greater \npublic  awareness  of  the  need  for  sustainable  aquaculture  and  environmental  protection. \nTherefore, the preparation of an environmental impact assessment is not required, and this IEE \ncould suffice for the purpose of this Project. \n \n14. \nNevertheless, environmental parameters should be included among the criteria used in \nthe selection of project sites. Environmental conditions at project sites should also be monitored \nat  least  quarterly  to  determine  changes  in  the  levels  of  essential  environmental  parameters. \nSharp changes could point to a need for remedial measures. \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 October 2006) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "rupiah (Rp) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "Rp1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "$0.0001 \nRp9,105 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n", "The  exchange  rate  of  the  rupiah  is  determined  under  a  system  of  managed  float  against  the \ncurrencies of Indonesia\u2019s major trading partners.
