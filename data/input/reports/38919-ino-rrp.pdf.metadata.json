the  Tangguh  Liquefied  Natural  Gas \nProject in the Republic of Indonesia.  \n \n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \n2. \nIndonesia  started  exporting  LNG  in  1977  and  is  currently  the  world\u2019s  largest  LNG \nexporter  with  a  market  share  of  nearly  20%.  LNG  export  is  a  significant  earner  of  foreign \nexchange  for  the  country.  In  2004,  it  comprised  $7.8  billion,  or  10.8%  of  the  nation\u2019s  total \nexports.  Indonesia  has  supplied  natural  gas  for  conversion  to  LNG  from  two  primary  centers: \nArun  in  Aceh  province  and  Bontang  in  East  Kalimantan  province.  Arun\u2019s  natural  gas  reserves \nare widely recognized to be depleting, and Arun is likely to cease to be an important source of \nnatural gas by 2012 or soon thereafter. Bontang production recently experienced a shortfall due \nto operational constraints.  \n \nThe Project is expected to be the Indonesia\u2019s third primary LNG center and the largest \n3. \nprivate  sector  financing  in  Indonesia.  Following  the  discovery  of  a  total  of  seven  gas  fields  in \nBintuni Bay in Irian, the Project is being developed to implement the upstream development of \nthe  gas  fields  and  the  subsequent  processing  of  this  feed  gas  into  LNG  for  export.  In \nanticipation  of  the  development  of  this  valuable  resource  located  in  one  of  Indonesia\u2019s  most \nrugged  and  backward  regions,  in  1997  the  Project  was  named  \u201cTangguh,\u201d  which  in  Bahasa \nmeans \u201cstrong and resilient.\u201d \n \n\nIII.  BACKGROUND \n\n \nA. \n \n\nThe Liquified Natural Gas Subsector  \n\n1. \n\nOverview \n\n \nIndonesia has 2.56 trillion cubic meters (m3) of \u201cproven\u201d natural gas reserves, the 13th \n4. \nlargest  in  the  world  and  the  largest  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  The  proven  gas  reserves  are \nequivalent  to  three  times  Indonesia\u2019s  oil  reserves  and  can  supply  the  country  for  35  years  at \ncurrent  production  rates.  If  the  \u201cpossible\u201d  gas  reserves  are  included,  future  supply  could  be \nlonger than 50 years. However, not all of these reserves are commercially viable and not all of \ntheir gas is exportable, due to gas quality and distance to market.  \n \nIndonesia\u2019s  natural  gas  production  reached  73,300  million  m3  in  2004,  8th  largest  in  the \n5. \nworld and largest in Asia and the Pacific. The country\u2019s gas exports have grown 60-fold from 661 \nmillion  m3 in  1977,  when  LNG  exports  started,  to  39,600  million  m3 in  2004.  Indonesia\u2019s  natural \ngas  exports  have  traditionally  been  in  the  form  of  LNG.  Indonesia  presently  is  the  largest  LNG \nproducer in the world with nearly a 20% market share. In 2004, Indonesia\u2019s LNG was exported to \nJapan (63.3%), Republic of Korea (21.8%), and Taipei,China (14.9%).  \n \n6. \nLNG exports are the country\u2019s main energy export, and thus a principle source of revenue. \nLNG  exports  averaged  9.5%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  exports  during  1998\u20132004.  During  the  same \n\n\f 2 \n \n\n \nperiod, the contribution of LNG to the country\u2019s gross domestic product averaged 3.5%. However, \nIndonesia\u2019s  two  primary  LNG  centers,  Arun  in  Aceh  and  Bontang  in  East  Kalimantan  are \nreportedly  facing  various  production  constraints.  Arun\u2019s  gas  production  is  now  in  steady  decline \nafter peaking in 1995; 90% of Arun\u2019s gas resources are now considered depleted, and committed \nreserves will run out entirely in 2018. Bontang began experiencing LNG shortfalls in 2004 due to \nunderproduction  as  a  result  of  poor  maintenance,  accidents,  and  low  field  performance.  The \nproduction  constraints  faced  by  Arun  and  Bontang  underline  the  importance  of  developing  the \nProject,  the  third  LNG  center,  in  order  to  maintain  the  country\u2019s  leadership  in  the  world  LNG \nmarket  and  to  secure  stable  revenues  from  LNG  exports  in  the  future.  The  LNG  subsector  in \nIndonesia is described in Appendix 2. \n \n\n2. \n\nSector Regulations \n\n \n7. \nAs part of a wider program for deregulation, the Government announced reforms in the \noil and gas subsector in a letter of intent signed in January 2000. Subsequently, in 2001 then \nPresident Megawati Sukarnoputri signed a new oil and gas law providing a new framework for \nthe  oil  and  gas  industry:  Law  of  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  (Number  22  of  2001)  Concerning \nNatural  Oil  and  Gas  (the  new  oil  and  gas  law).  It  recognizes  the  importance  of  a  certain  and \ntransparent  legal  environment  in  which  to  conduct  business  activities,  and  contemplates  the \nestablishment  of  upstream  and  downstream  environments  with  an  appropriate  regulatory \nframework for each. LNG plants may be flexibly considered as either upstream or downstream \nactivities depending on their commercial objectives. Historically, all of Indonesia\u2019s LNG projects \nhave been integrated with gas production arrangements, and are thus considered an upstream \nactivity.  The  new  oil  and  gas  law  also  provides  for  the  creation  of  the Indonesian  Oil and  Gas \nUpstream Regulatory Body (BPMIGAS), a nonprofit state-owned legal entity, to be responsible \nfor upstream activities taking over rights and obligations of PERTAMINA, the former National Oil \nand  Gas  Company  of  Indonesia.  Accordingly,  PERTAMINA's  supervisory  role  in  the  upstream \nand its downstream monopoly have ceased.  \n \nB. \n \n\nAsian Development Bank Operations \n\n1. \n\nCountry Strategy \n\n \n8. \nThe new country strategy currently under preparation for Indonesia states that ADB will \nbe  guided  by  the  Government\u2019s  five  priority  areas  to  achieve  sustainable  economic  growth, \nwhich  is  needed  to  absorb  the  large  number  of  entrants  to  the  labor  market  annually  and  to \nreduce  poverty.  The  five  areas  are  (i)  job  creation  and  poverty  reduction;  (ii)  macroeconomic \nstability; (iii) increase of investments, exports, and tourism; (iv) human resource improvements; \nand (v) infrastructure development by improving the efficiency of services and increasing private \nsector participation.  \n\n \n9. \nTo support the Government\u2019s goal and drawing on lessons learned, ADB will focus on (i) \ndevelopment  of  infrastructure,  (ii)  promotion  of  decentralization,  (iii)  reduction  of  regional \ndisparities,  (iv)  enhancement  of  natural  resource  management,  and  (v)  reform  of  the  financial \nsector. \n \n10. \nADB  has  played  a  significant  role  in  the  development  of  the  gas  transmission \ninfrastructure, and in developing the regulatory capacity for the oil and gas sector in Indonesia. \nADB\u2019s Loan 1357-INO: Gas Transmission Project in Sumatra supported the construction of the \ntrans-Sumatra  gas  pipeline  that  not  only  enhanced  domestic  utilization  of  natural  gas  but  also \nestablished  an  important  segment  of  the  trans-ASEAN  gas  grid  promoting  regional  energy \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\ncooperation. 1  An  important  policy  covenant  under  the  ADB  loan  required  the  conversion  of \nPerusahaan  Gas  Negara  (PGN)  from  a  state  corporation  to  a  limited  liability  company  which \nwas  completed  in  1996.  ADB  conducted  extensive  and  high-level  policy  dialogue  on  the \nparticipation  of  the  private  sector.  As  a  result,  a  subsidiary  with  a  40%  private  sector \nparticipation was formed to own, and operate the transmission system comprising the Grissik-\nDuri line completed in 1998 and the Grissik-Sakernan-Batam-Singapore pipelines completed in \n2004  and  the  Batam  distribution  network  completed  in  2005.  ADB  has  provided  several \ntechnical  assistances  (TAs)  to  support  the  establishment  of  the  regulatory  framework  and \nrestructuring  of  the  gas  sector,  development  of  the  gas  sector  master  plan,  and  for  gas \ndistribution and utilization.2 An ongoing TA supports the development of the least cost option for \ngas supply to meet the growing energy demand in Java.3\n \n\nEnergy Sector Strategy \n\n2. \n \n11. \nADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy  supports,  as  operational  priorities,  (i)  poverty  reduction, \nincluding  by  creating  energy  infrastructure  for  sustainable  economic  growth;  (ii)  promotion  of \nprivate  sector  involvement  by  restructuring  the  energy  sector,  and  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment for the private sector; (iii) addressing regional and global environment impacts by \nsupporting measures to address acid rain problems and use of clean energy; and (iv) promotion \nof regional cooperation.  \n \n12. \nThe  Project  supports  and  contributes  to  the  promotion  of  ADB\u2019s  operational  priorities, \nparticularly  by  (i)  generating  substantial  financial  benefits  for  both  the  central  and  local \ngovernments  to  enable  sustainable  economic  growth,  which  can  reduce  poverty,  as  well  as \ndirectly assisting various poverty reduction initiatives in Irian; (ii) supporting government policy \nof  restructuring  the  oil  and  gas  subsector  with  the  largest  private  sector  investment  since  the \nfinancial crisis in 1997; (iii) supplying clean energy to countries in the region, e.g., the People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC),  where  serious  environmental  degradation  including  acid  rain  have \nresulted  from  the  overuse  of  coal  as  a  primary  fuel;  and  (iv)  promoting  regional  cooperation \nthrough increased energy trade in the region. \n\n \n3. \n\nADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations \n\n \n13. \nTo  support  the  Government\u2019s  goal  of  reducing  poverty  by  achieving  sustainable \neconomic growth, ADB proposes to revitalize its private sector operations in Indonesia to serve \nas  a  catalyst  for  the  return  of  private  sector  investments  in  infrastructure,  especially  in  the \nenergy  and  transport  sectors.  During  its  January  2005  Infrastructure  Summit,  the  Government \nidentified  91  projects  totaling  $22.7  billion  for  possible  private  sector  participation  to  enhance \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  1995.

THE PROJECT \n\nBackground \n\nA. \n \nAs part of Indonesia\u2019s economic policies of maintaining the security of LNG supply and \n14. \nencouraging the development of projects earning foreign exchange, the Project is designated as \na national project and its realization is recognized by the Government as a national priority. \n \nB. \n\nInvestors \n\n \n15. \nInterests  in  the  Project  are  held  by  subsidiaries  of  major  oil  and  gas  companies:  BP; \nChina National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC); Mitsubishi Corporation; INPEX Corporation; \nNippon  Oil  Exploration,  Ltd.;  Japan  Oil,  Gas,  and  Metals  National  Corporation  (JOGMEC); \nKanematsu  Corporation;  Overseas  Petroleum  Corporation;  and  LNG  Japan  Corporation.  The \ninvestors\u2019 corporate profiles are in Appendix 3. \n \nC. \n \n16. \nThe  Project  is  a  major greenfield  development  to  extract  natural  gas  from  gas  fields  in \nthe Berau and Bintuni bay area of Irian, and to liquefy it into LNG for shipping to export markets.  \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n\nProject Description \n\n \nEnvironment, Safety, and Health \n\n1. \n \n17. \nThe  Project  will  meet  high  standards  in  responsible  resource  development  through  the \nenvironmental  and  social  impact  assessment  (AMDAL)  process,  which  was  carried  out  during \n2000\u20132002 using Indonesian regulations and standards. Many aspects of relevant international \nstandards  were  also  considered.  The  assessments  produced  three  documents  required  under \nthe  regulation:  (i)  Environmental  and  Social  Impact  Analysis  (ANDAL),  (ii)  Environmental  and \nSocial  Impact  Management  Plan  (RKL),  and  (iii)  Environmental  and  Social  Impact  Monitoring \nPlan  (RPL).  As  the  Project  includes  components  subject  to  different  government  jurisdictions, \nthe  Central  AMDAL  Evaluation  Commission  of  the  Ministry  of  Environment  undertook  the \nAMDAL  using  an  integrated  approach.  The  environment  minister  confirmed  environmental \napproval of the Project on 25 October 2002. \n \nthe  Project  as  environmental  category  A.  The  summary \n18. \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  was  prepared  and  posted  on  the  ADB  website  on  8  July \n2005.  The  assessment  used  the  ANDAL,  RKL,  and  RPL  as  source  documents  and  includes \ninformation not required under the Indonesian system. Details of the final project design and the \nresults  of  additional  studies  undertaken  since  the  original  AMDAL  documents  were  prepared \nand are reflected in the summary environmental impact assessment. \n \nKey environmental issues include the need to protect air and water quality, and effects \n19. \non  terrestrial,  freshwater  aquatic,  intertidal,  and  marine  ecosystems.  Extensive  and  intensive \nenvironmental inputs were included in project planning. The Project, as designed, minimizes the \nrisk of adverse environmental impacts. A wide range of environmental protection measures and \n\nADB  has  classified \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nsafeguards  have  been  incorporated  to  protect  against  adverse  impacts  to  the  physical, \nbiological, and social components of the environment. With the implementation of the RKL  and \nRPL, the Project will comply fully with all Indonesian and ADB environmental requirements. The \nRPL presents emission/discharge standards based on the strictest of Indonesian, World Bank, \nand  World  Health  Organization  guidelines.  Covenants  related  to  the  RKL  and  RPL  will  be  set \nout in the financing documents. \n \n20. \nHealth  and  safety  aspects  feature  prominently  as  a  major  BP  corporate  policy.  Health \nand safety management measures are included in the construction contracts for implementation \nby the contractors. During the operation of project facilities, health and safety management will \nrigorously  adopt  standard  measures  and  practices  well-established  in  the  gas  industry.  The \nenvironmental monitoring program includes health and safety aspects to ensure the compliance \nrequired as part of the environmental management plan. \n \n\nResettlement  \n\n2. \n \nLand  acquisition  and  physical  relocation  of  127  households  from  within  the  LNG  plant \n21. \nsite was completed by mid-2004. Resettlement was undertaken in accordance with a Tangguh \nProject Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan (LARAP) which forms part of the Government \napproved  AMDAL  for  the  Project.  The  AMDAL  LARAP  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment  legislation  and  World  Bank  standards.  Amongst  other  issues,  national  and \ninternational NGOs expressed some concerns about resettlement and compensation aspects of \nthe  Project  during  the  AMDAL  process.  A  \u2018due  diligence\u2019  of  those  resettlement  activities \ncompleted  prior  to  ADB\u2019s  involvement  was  undertaken.  Some  gaps  were  identified. 4  \nSubsequently, with guidance from ADB, the Project has prepared a second LARAP referred to \nas the \u201cImplementation LARAP\u201d. This addresses gaps identified during the \u2018due diligence\u2019 and \nprovides  additional  detail  on  livelihood  restoration  for  affected  people.  The  \u2018Implementation \nLARAP\u2019 is in accordance with ADB policy and operation requirements. \n \n22. \nFor the LNG terminal, a 3,266 ha site was acquired through negotiated agreements with \nseveral  clans  of  the  Simuri  tribe,  which  held  customary  (adat)  rights  to  the  land,  and  with  the \nTanah Merah community who occupied it. A further 200 ha of land, also belonging to the Simuri, \nwas  acquired  for  a  replacement  village  and  garden  plots  for  the  Tanah  Merah  resettlers.  127 \nhouseholds (694  people)  from  the  village  of  Tanah  Merah  were  relocated  from  within  the site. \nThe  standard  of  replacement  housing,  community  facilities  and  supporting  infrastructure \nprovided to resettlers is high. ADB\u2019s due diligence study found that resettlers are very satisfied \nwith  their  replacement  living  conditions.  Well  resourced  livelihood  restoration  programs  for \naffected people are underway and will be supported by the Project until 2009. The due diligence \nassessed  the  resettlement  program  as  well  planned  and  executed,  and  in  conformance  with \nADB  requirements.  An  appraisal  mission  was  conducted  in  early  November  2005  to  review \namongst  other  matters  (i)  progress  with  resettlement  implementation;  (ii)  the  adequacy  of \naffected  people\u2019s  access  to  replacement  forest  and  coastal  resources;  and,  (iii)  relations \nbetween  clans  following  resources  reallocation.  Progress  was  assessed  by  the  Mission  as \nsatisfactory. \n \n\n                                                 \n4   Gaps with respect to ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy included: (i) lack of an explicit basis for compensation \nfor loss of use of coastal resources and fishing grounds resulting from Project safety exclusion zones; and, (ii) an \ninconsistent  approach  to  compensating  for  certain  plantations  within  the  LNG  site.    The  Project  has  included \ncommitments to address these gaps in the \u2018Implementation LARAP\u2019. \n\n\f 6 \n \n\n \nTotal  affected  population  is  249  households  (1,165  people).  This  consists  of  the \n23. \nrelocated  village  (127  households),  and  two  host  communities,  Onar  (28  households),  and \nSaengga  (94  households).  The  host  villages  will  benefit  through  renovation  of  housing  and \ninfrastructure by the project. The host communities will experience some intensification of use of \ntheir coastal resources as a result of the need to share with resettler households. All villagers \nwill  experience  some  loss  of  access  to  fishing  area  as  a  result  of  restrictions  around  the  LNG \nplant,  subsea  pipelines  and  offshore  platforms.  An  endowment  trust  and  livelihood  programs \nhave been set-up to offset livelihood coastal resources and fishing grounds affected by Project \nmarine safety exclusion zones. \n\nIndigenous Peoples Development Plan \n\n \n3. \n \nThe Project has prepared and is implementing an indigenous peoples development plan \n24. \nprepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Indigenous Peoples Policy. Two related indigenous peoples \nsafeguards  documents  were  prepared  for  the  Project.  The  first  document  is  the  Integrated \nSocial Program (ISP), which is the equivalent of an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan, to \naddress  anticipated  indigenous  peoples'  issues  and  other  social  development  issues  during \nproject construction period and transition to the project operations period (2006-2010). The ISP \nsets  out  principles  for  (i)  informing  and  promoting  participation  of  local  indigenous  peoples  in \nproject preparation and implementation; (ii) delivering benefits to local indigenous people; and, \n(iii)  safeguarding  them  from  adverse  Project  impacts.  Principal  Project  impacts  and  risks  for \nindigenous  people  have  been  identified.  The  plan  was  prepared  within  the  context  of  the \nPapuan  Special  Autonomy  Law  (1999)  which  obligates  the  Government  of  Papua  to \nacknowledge,  protect,  empower,  and  develop  the  rights  of  indigenous  communities.    Enabling \nlegislation has now been passed for formation of a Papua People\u2019s Assembly (Majelis Rakyat \nPapua)  which  includes  indigenous  representation.  The  second  document  is  the  Indigenous \nPeoples Development Framework (IPDF), which is to address unanticipated indigenous peoples \nissues  and  other  possible  social  development  issues  over  the  lifetime  of  the  Project.  IPDF  is \nrequired in recognition that (i) the project lifespan and project loan maturity extends beyond the \ncurrent  ISP  planning  period,  and  (ii)  the  long-term  socio-economic  environment,  in  which  the \nproject is being developed, is relatively unpredictable. \n \nThe ISP has the following components: (i) a diversified growth strategy (DGS) developed \n25. \nin partnership with UNDP and the Government to reduce impacts of population influx, to support \ndevelopment of a regional development plan and to increase the capacity of local government; \n(ii)  a  community  mobilization  and  development  program  developing  small  social  and  physical \ninfrastructure projects in nine villages in the immediate vicinity of the Project; (iii) a basic health \nprogram focusing on maternal and child health, malaria control, TB detection and treatment and \nHIV/AIDs  prevention;  (iv)  establishment  of  a  community-based  security  network;  (v) \nmicrofinance  and  SME  development  program  (in  collaboration  with  USAID);  and,  (vi) \nstrengthening  of  adat  institutions  and  local  civil  society.  Mechanisms  and  forums  to  facilitate \ninformation  dissemination,  consultation,  grievance  and  dispute  resolution  have  been  defined. \nISP  expenditure  to  date  is  $18.7  million.  A  further  $58.3  million  is  budgeted  for  2006-2010. \nAccording  to  IPDF,  beyond  2010  the  Project,  together  with  the  Government,  will  provide  on-\ngoing support to social-economic development initiatives based on an assessment of needs and \nrisks. \n \n\n4. \n\nDevelopment Impacts \n\n \n26. \nThe Project will build  a facility to serve as  the third LNG  primary center in Indonesia. Its \nLNG  exports  will  earn  revenue  in  foreign  currency,  which  will  be  shared  by  the  private  sector \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\ninvestors and the Government based on the PSCs. In accordance with the Indonesian Autonomy \nLaw, these revenues will be shared between the central and provincial governments. The Project \nsupports  the  Government\u2019s  goal  to  achieve  sustainable  economic  growth  to  reduce  poverty \nthrough macroeconomic stability and infrastructure development with private sector participation.  \n \n27. \nThe  Project  will  increase  the  supply  of  clean  energy  to  importing  countries  such  as  the \nPRC, which is endeavoring to reduce air pollution caused by the overuse of coal and to diversify \nenergy sources while achieving sustainable economic growth. The Project contributes to regional \ncooperation by energy trading.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDevelopment Effectiveness \n\n \nBased  on  the  standards  being  contemplated  by  ADB  for  implementation  of  the  Good \n28. \nPractice  Standards  for  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment  Operations,  the  Project  is \nassessed  and  described  within  the  design  and  monitoring,  and  development  effectiveness \nframeworks  (Appendix  1).  The  Project  is  deemed  to  be  developmentally  effective,  and  its \nperformance measurable. A brief summary discussion follows on each of the three parameters.  \n\n \na. \n\nProject Performance \n\n \nb.  \n\nEconomic Sustainability \n\n \nThe  Project  will  be  assessed  against  its  specific  investment  capital,  construction, \n29. \noperational,  and  financial  objectives.  Essentially,  effectiveness  will  be  measured  against  how \nsuccessfully  the  Project  attracts  private  sector  capital  (both  debt  and  equity);  how  the  Project \nsecures  fixed  construction  costs  and  contracting  arrangements  for  on-time  construction,  within \nbudget and within specifications; and how the Project secures suitable operational arrangements \nto  enable  optimal  production  of  LNG  for  export.  The  Project  will  be  also  measured  by  financial \nprofitability and sustainability through timely debt repayment capacity and investor returns. \n \n \n \n30. \nThe Project will be assessed, from an economic sustainability point of view, on its ability to \nprovide  Indonesia  with  new  LNG  production  and  export  capacity,  supply  LNG  at  competitive \nprices,  and  contribute  to  economic  growth  by  generating  additional  revenue  to  the  central  and \nlocal  governments.  Additional  employment  created  as  a  result  of  project  implementation  will  be \ntaken into account. The Project\u2019s successful implementation will promote the Government\u2019s sector \nreform. \n \n \n \n31. \nThe  Project  will  be  assessed  and  measured  on  how  it  contributes  to  private  sector \ndevelopment. The focus of this assessment is on the Project\u2019s commercial and financial viability, \nand  its  demonstrative  and  catalytic  effect  on  future  private  sector  investments  in  the  energy \nsector, and the broader economy as a whole. \n \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\n \nc.  \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Loan \n\nA. \n \n\n32. \n\nNature and Amount \n\n1. \n \nADB assistance for the Project will comprise a loan of up to $350 million  \n\n\f \n\nJustification for ADB Assistance \n\nThe Project merits ADB support for the following reasons: \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\nBy generating financial benefits to both central and local governments in the long \nterm, the Project, the first phase of the nation\u2019s third LNG center, will contribute \nsignificantly to the Government\u2019s goal of achieving sustainable economic growth \nand thus reduce poverty, as supported in the ADB country strategy.  \n\nThe  Project  will  supply  natural  gas  at  competitive  prices  and  promote  as  a \npriority, as the ADB energy strategy designates, environmental improvements in \nother countries such as the PRC, which are endeavoring to lessen environmental \ndegradation and broaden their energy mix. The Project will contribute to regional \ncooperation  by  energy  trade,  another  priority  designated  in  the  ADB  energy \nstrategy. \n\nSuccess of the Project will demonstrate resumption of private sector confidence \nin  Indonesia  and  in  the Government\u2019s  reform  initiatives  to  promote  deregulation \nand improve transparency in the critical energy sector. \n\n \n\nThe Project is the first phase of a large LNG project, which will contribute, in the \nlong  term,  by  increasing  energy  supply  to  alleviate  energy  price  hikes  and \nfluctuations, the main challenge that developing member countries are facing for \nsustainable economic development. \n\nBy  participating  in  the  Project,  ADB  will  indicate  its  strong  commitment  to  help \ndevelop  the  energy  infrastructure  sector  in  Indonesia,  which  requires  a  large \namount of private sector investment. \n\nADB\u2019s participation in the Project is critical to reassuring project participants (the \nGovernment,  private  investors,  LNG  purchasers,  and  financiers)  that  this \nIndonesian national project is structured, financed, implemented, and operated in \nline with international standards and best practices with critical environment and \nsocial requirements being fully satisfied. \n\nVI.  ASSURANCES \n\n \n34. \nA framework agreement relating to ADB\u2019s status, privileges, and immunities with respect \nto  its  equity  investments  and  lending  operations  in  the  private  sector  is  in  effect  between  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (the  Articles  of  Agreement),  the  Government  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no \nobjection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to  the  Project.  No  funding  will  be  disbursed  until  ADB \nreceives  such  confirmation.  In  addition,  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  loan  and  guarantee \ndocumentation on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB which will include, without limitation, \nprovisions addressing anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism matters.  \n \n \n \n\n 8 \n \n\n \n\nB. \n \n33. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nVII. \n\n  RECOMMENDATION \n\n \n35. \nI am satisfied

\nIndonesia  has  2.56  trillion  cubic  meters  (m3)  of  proven  natural  gas  reserves,  the  13th \n1. \nlargest in the world and the largest in the Asia and Pacific region. Gas reserves are equivalent \nto  three  times  Indonesia\u2019s  oil  reserves  and  can  supply  the  country  for  35  years  at  current \nproduction  rates.  If  the possible  reserves  are  included, supply  would  be  longer  than  50  years. \nAccording to the Government, over 71% of natural gas reserves are located offshore, with the \nlargest reserves found on Natuna Island (34.4%), East Kalimantan (30.2%), Irian Jaya (15.1%), \nAceh (6.8%), and South Sumatra (6.4%). However, not all of these reserves are commercially \nviable  nor  is  the  gas  exportable,  due  to  both  the  quality  of  the  gas  as  well  as  its  distance  to \nmarket.  \n \nB. \n \nIndonesia\u2019s natural gas production has steadily increased, rising to 73,300 million m3 in \n2. \n2004, the world\u2019s 8th largest and Asia and Pacific\u2019s largest, followed by Malaysia, the People\u2019s \nRepublic  of China  (PRC),  and  Australia.  Indonesia\u2019s  gas  exports  have  grown  from  661  million \nm3 in 1977, when the export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) started, to 20,342 million m3 in 1986, \na  31-fold  increase,  and  to  39,600  million  m3 in  2004,  a  60-fold  increase.  Natural  gas  exports \nfrom  Indonesia  have  traditionally  been  in  the  form  of  LNG.  Export  by  pipeline  commenced  to \nSingapore  upon  completion  of  a  subsea  pipeline  in  2001.  Indonesia  presently  remains  the \nlargest LNG producer in the world, with almost a 20% market share. In 2004, Indonesia\u2019s LNG \nwas  exported  to  Japan  (63.3%);  Republic  of  Korea  (21.8%);  and  Taipei,China  (14.9%).  While \nnatural  gas  export  by  pipelines  is  expected  to  increase,  LNG  exports  will  remain  the  majority \ndue to the geographic distance between Indonesia and large gas demand centers in the region. \nFigure A2.1 presents Indonesia\u2019s natural gas production and export during 1986-2004. \n \n\nLiquefied Natural Gas Production and Export \n\nFigure A2.1: Natural Gas Production and Export\n\n)\n3\nm\nn\no\n\n \n\ni\nl\nl\n\nmi\n(\n \nn\no\ni\nt\nc\nu\nd\no\nr\nP\n\n80,000\n\n70,000\n\n60,000\n\n50,000\n\n40,000\n\n30,000\n\n20,000\n\n10,000\n\n0\n\n1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\n\nLNG Export Natural Gas Export Marketed Production\n\nYear\n\nSource: Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n\n \n\n\f \n\n3.8\n\n2001\n\nYear\n\n \n\n14     Appendix 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n)\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\n \n\nb\n$\n(\n \ns\ne\nu\nn\ne\nv\ne\nR\n\n \nt\nr\no\np\nx\nE\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n3. \nLNG is the country\u2019s main energy export and a principle source of revenue and a major \ncontributor  to  the  economy.  In  2004,  LNG  exports  generated  revenues  of  $7.8  billion \nrepresenting 10.8% of the nation\u2019s exports and 3.1% of its gross domestic product. LNG exports \nrepresented an average of 9.5% of the country\u2019s total exports in 1998\u20132004. During the same \nperiod, its contribution to the country\u2019s gross domestic product averaged 3.5% (Figure A2.2).  \n\nFigure A2.2: LNG Export Revenues and GDP\n\n7.8\n\n6.8\n\n6.6\n\n4.4\n\n5.4\n\n5.6\n\n3.4\n\n3.4\n\n4.5\n\n3.2\n\n3.2\n\n3.1\n\n3.1\n\n6.0\n\n5.5\n\n5.0\n\n4.5\n\n4.0\n\n3.5\n\n3.0\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n)\n\n%\n\n(\n \n\nP\nD\nG\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\nSource: US Embassy Jakarta.\n\n Export Revenues ($ billion)         \n\nGDP (%)\n\n \n\nLNG Demand \n\n4. \nTo maintain reserves and production for oil and gas, Indonesia will require $49 billion of \ninvestment capital through 2020, of which more than $46 billion will be needed for oil and gas \nexploration,  processing,  and  petrochemical  installations.  However,  annual  investment  reported \nin  2001\u20132003  was  only  $1.2  billion  on  average.  Historically,  substantial  financing  for \ndevelopment of the energy sector has come from government, export credit agencies, and the \nprivate  sector  (mostly  foreign).  Among  export  credit  agencies,  Japan  Export  Import  Bank \n(presently, Japan Bank for International Cooperation) has played a leading role. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe fastest growing component of world energy consumption is expected to be natural \ngas  according  to  the  International  Energy  Agency.  Currently,  natural  gas  accounts  for  23%  of \ntotal  energy  consumption,  but  this  is  projected  to  increase  to  28%  by  2020.  The  growth  of \nnatural gas consumption in developing countries is expected to be significantly greater than in \nthe rest of the world, averaging 5.3% per year, as compared with 2.4% per year for developed \ncountries.  Gas  importing  countries  and  regions  include  Japan;  France;  Republic  of  Korea; \nSpain; Taipei,China; and the United States.  \n \n6. \nThe  largest  increments  in  natural  gas  use  are  expected  to  be  in  developing  Asia  and \nNorth  America.  Natural  gas  consumption  in  Australia,  Japan  and  New  Zealand  is  projected  to \n\n\f  \n\n   Appendix 2     15 \n\nincrease by 1.9% per year from 1999 to 2020; however, in the rest of Asia, gas consumption is \nexpected  to  increase  6.1%  per  year  over  the  same  time  period.  Among  the  developing \neconomies,  the  PRC  will  be  one  of  the  most  prominent  LNG  purchasers  in  Asia  in  the  future. \nWhile it is currently the  world\u2019s second largest energy  market, the PRC\u2019s energy  consumption \nper  capita  remains  low.  To  maintain  rapid  economic  growth  and  lessen  environmental \ndegradation, the PRC government is strongly promoting the use of natural gas. By 2020, natural \ngas is predicted to increase to 12% of the PRC\u2019s total energy mix from only 2.5% in 2000. The \nprojected increase of natural gas consumption will create a demand-supply gap for the PRC in \nnatural gas of 24 billion m3/annum by 2010, which is predicted to grow to 100 billion m3/annum \nby 2020. The PRC government plans to meet the demand-supply gap by importing LNG through \nnewly constructed LNG terminals as well as by transporting natural gas from the western region \nby pipelines. \n \nD. \n \n7. \nIndonesia\u2019s LNG production commenced in late 1970s at two primary LNG centers: Arun \nin Aceh province and Bontang in East Kalimantan province. The two primary LNG centers are \nreportedly  facing  various  production  constraints.  Arun\u2019s  gas  production  is  now  on  a  steady \ndecline after peaking in 1995. Ninety percent of Arun\u2019s gas resources are now considered to be  \ndepleted,  and  its  committed  reserves  will  run out  entirely in  2018.  As  Indonesia\u2019s  largest  LNG \ncenter,  Bontang  produces  about  20  million  tons/annum  of  LNG.  However,  Bontang  began \nexperiencing  LNG  shortfalls  in  2004  due  to  underproduction  resulting  from  poor  maintenance, \naccidents,  or  low  field  performance.  These  production  constraints  faced  by  Arun  and  Bontang \nhave underlined the importance for Indonesia of developing the Project as the third LNG center \nin order to maintain its leadership in the world LNG market and secure stable revenue from LNG \nexports in the future. \n\nEmerging Challenges \n\n \n8. \nIn  recent  years,  new  LNG  producers  in  Australia,  Malaysia,  Russia  Federation,  and \nQatar, are challenging Indonesia\u2019s leading position in the LNG market by increasing supply and \noffering  more  flexible  and  competitive  sales  contracts.  Indonesia\u2019s  LNG  exports  have  been \nunder long-term contracts between PERTAMINA and its LNG purchasers. However, Indonesia\u2019s \nkey LNG markets in Japan and Republic of Korea are exploring new sources of LNG, offering \nlower prices and more flexible contracts. In addition, these buyers are starting to rely more on \nthe spot market for their LNG supply as part of their fuel management and procurement strategy. \nConsequently,  Indonesia  is  exploring  alternative  marketing  opportunities  in  the  PRC  and  the \nUnited States. \n \nE. \n \n9. \nThe  new  Indonesian  Oil  and  Gas  Law  No.  35/2004  was  promulgated  on  14  October \n2004 replacing Oil and Gas Law 44/1960 and Law 8/1971 on PERTAMINA. It provides a new \nframework  for  the  oil  and  gas  industry.  The  law  recognizes  the  importance  of  a  certain  and \ntransparent  legal  environment  in  which  to  conduct  the  business  activity  of  Indonesia's  oil  and \ngas  industry.1  It  contemplates  the  establishment  of  upstream  and  downstream  environments \nwith  an  appropriate  regulatory  framework  for  each.  It  aims  to  (i)  open  all  sectors  of  the \npetroleum  industry  to  competition,  (ii)  lower  costs  through  increased  transparency  and \nefficiency, (iii) allow market mechanisms to determine prices, (iv) create legal certainty to raise \n\nRegulatory Frameworks \n\n                                                 \n1  Indonesia  supports  the  Extractive  Industries  Transparency  Initiative  proposed  by  United  Kingdom  Prime  Minister \n\nTony Blair. \n\n \n\n\f16     Appendix 2 \n\ninvestor confidence, and (v) end PERTAMINA\u2019s control of upstream activities and monopoly of \nthe downstream sector. \n \n10. \nUnder the new law, investors conduct (i) upstream activities under cooperation contracts \nwith  the  state-owned  implementing  agency  (BPMIGAS)  or  (ii)  downstream  activities  under  a \nbusiness  license  issued  by  the  state-owned  regulatory  agency.  LNG  plants  may  be  flexibly \nconsidered as either upstream or downstream activities depending on their commercial objectives. \nHistorically, all of Indonesia\u2019s LNG projects have been integrated with production-sharing contract \nassets, and are thus considered an upstream activity.2   \n\n \n11. \nIn January 2001, the new Fiscal Decentralization Law was promulgated. Under the new \nrevenue-sharing formulas, 15% of the Government\u2019s net oil revenues and 30% of its net natural \ngas  revenues  are  directed  to  provincial  and  district  governments.  The  Government\u2019s  net \nrevenues can be realized as profit after cost recovery and deduction of the production-sharing \ncontractor\u2019s share. Of the 15% of the Government\u2019s net oil revenue flowing to the regions, 6% \nwill go to the region of origin, 6% will be shared among the other districts in the province, and \n3%  will  go  to  the  provincial  government.  In  the  case  of  the  Government\u2019s  net  gas  revenues, \n12% goes to the region of origin, 12% will be shared among the other districts in the province, \nand  6%  will  go  to  the  provincial  government.  However,  special  autonomy  provisions  for  Aceh \nand Irian give those two provinces 70% of net oil and gas profits, with the remaining 30% going \nto the central Government. \n \n\n                                                 \n2  Noting the success of past projects and the familiarity of all parties with the upstream structure for LNG plants (both    \n\nfrom a development and a financing standpoint), the Project is pursuing an upstream designation.   \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3       17\n\nCORPORATE PROFILE OF INVESTORS \n\nBP PLC \n\n \n \nA. \n \n1. \nBP PLC (BP) is one of the world's largest integrated energy companies with operations \nin  over  70  countries.

JNOC  was  established  in  1967  as  a  state-run  company  to  promote  overseas  oil \nexploration  via  extensive  investment  programs  and  loan  guarantees  to  Japanese  exploration \nfirms. In 2002, the Japanese government adopted a policy of streamlining Japanese national oil \nand  gas  exploration  and  production.  A  principal  feature  of  this  reform  was  the  dissolution  of \nJNOC, which was completed by the end of March 2005. As required by law, JNOC disposed of \nall  of  its  shares  in  oil  and  gas  exploration  and  production  projects,  including  its  shares  in  KG \nBerau  Petroleum  Ltd.  (KG  Berau),  KG  Wiriagar  Petroleum  Ltd.  (KG  Wiriagar),  and  Nippon  Oil \nExploration  (Berau)  Ltd.  (Nippon).
