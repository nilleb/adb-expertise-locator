The  project  design  is  thus \nbased  on  least-cost  flood  mitigation  measures  coupled  with \nassistance  to  help  the  Government,  through  an  associated \ntechnical assistance (TA), identify and initiate medium- to long-\nterm comprehensive flood management. \nThe Project will provide (i) structural measures comprising least-\ncost feasible solutions to protect villages and agricultural land on \nthe Araz, Ganikh, and Mazim rivers against floods, which occur on \naverage once in 10 years, and to protect other areas against \nfloods, which occur on average once in 50 years; (ii) nonstructural \nmeasures constituting pilot community-based afforestation, flood \nforecasting  and  warning,  and  flood  zoning;  (iii)  disaster \npreparedness  and  flood  fighting  for  organizations,  physical \nfacilities, and residents through capacity building and procurement \nof  operation  and  maintenance  equipment;  and  (iv)  project \nmanagement and monitoring. The Project will cover 25 schemes \nin  12  districts  in  the  four  flood-prone  areas  inhabited \npredominantly by the poor. Poverty incidence in the project areas \nis 63% compared to 49% nationwide. \n \nRationale  Many areas are vulnerable to floods. They cause loss of life and \nproperty and reduce income-earning opportunities. Impacts are \nexacerbated by the inability of rural populations to afford personal, \ncrop, and livestock insurance. Floods worsen living standards of \nthe poor, negate any progress in reducing poverty, and can cause \nthe  non-poor  to  fall  into  poverty.  Without  protection  from \nfloodwaters, the whole rural asset base is at risk in certain areas. \nFloods  not  only  threaten  settlements  but  also  leave  layers  of \nsediment  over  agricultural  land,  seriously  diminishing  its \nproductivity.  Water  resources  control  and  management  are, \ntherefore, the critical factors underlying efforts to promote rural \ngrowth and raise rural incomes. Improved protection provided by \nthe  Project  will  not  only  secure  assets  but  will  also  allow \ndevelopment of knowledge to minimize flooding. \n ", " iv \n   \nMajor floods occurred in 1988, 1997, 1999, and 2002. Average \nannual damage from floods over 1980\u20131990 was estimated at $20 \nmillion, while the total damaged area was estimated at 1.2 million \nhectares (ha). Business assets at risk from flooding are valued at \nabout $3.7 billion. \n \nObjectives  The  Project\u2019s  objective  is  to  immediately  improve  protection \nagainst recurring floods in selected areas.  \n \nCost Estimates  The  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $29.35  million  equivalent,  of \nwhich  $8.55  million  (29%)  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and \n$20.80  million  equivalent  (71%)  local  currency  cost.  The  cost \nestimates include physical and price contingencies, and taxes and \nduties estimated at $1.03 million. \n \nFinancing Plan  ($ million equivalent) \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total    \nExchange Currency  Cost  % \nAsian  8.55 13.45   22.00  75\nDevelopment \nBank \nGovernment  0.00 7.35   7.35  25\n    Total  8.55 20.80   29.35  100\n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The proposed loan from the Special Funds resources of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  is  for  Special  Drawing  Rights \n15,366,000 ($22 million equivalent), which will have a term of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. \n \nAllocation and Relending  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  available  to  the  Executing \nTerms  Agency through budgetary appropriations. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2008 \n \nProject Completion Date  31 March 2008 \n \nExecuting Agency   State Amelioration and Irrigation Committee (SAIC) \n \nImplementation  The  high-level  project  steering  committee  established  during \nArrangements  project  preparation  will  provide  policy  guidance  and  facilitate \ninterministerial  coordination.  A  working  group  will  facilitate \noperational  coordination  at  the  district  level  and  provide \nassistance  to  the  project  implementing  units  (PIUs)  and \noperational  coordination  of  activities  involving  more  than  one \nministry. The SAIC chair will be designated as project director. A \nproject management office (PMO) will manage project activities \nand  liaise  with  ADB  and  coordinating  bodies.  The  Forestry ", "v \nDevelopment Department will implement pilot community-based \nafforestation subcomponent while the PMO will coordinate with \nthe National Meteorological Department to prepare specifications \nand evaluation procurement bids and installation of meteorological \nequipment. Two PIUs will be established, one each at Sharur and \nSheki, to implement works in Nakhchivan and greater Caucasus \nareas,  respectively,  and  maintain  liaison  with  the  PMO,  local \nadministration, and beneficiaries. The PMO will also implement \nworks in Gusar and Astara districts. It will be led by a full-time \nproject manager, and the PIUs by deputy project managers. \n \nProcurement  The Project will procure machinery, civil works, services, vehicles, \noffice  equipment,  and  materials  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement.  \n \nConsulting Services  The Project will provide 45 person-months of international and \n789 person-months of domestic consulting services to help SAIC \nmanage  the  Project,  prepare  detailed  design  and  tender \ndocuments,  award  contracts,  and  supervise  construction.  The \nconsultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to \nADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants,  using  the \nquality- and cost-based selection method. \n \nAdvance Procurement  The Government has requested approval of advance action to \nAction  recruit  consultants  and  procure  equipment  and  civil  works  to \nexpedite project implementation, considering the urgent need to \ncomplete the Project in 4 years.  \n \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  will  provide  protection  to  5  major  towns  and  43 \nBeneficiaries  villages, and support the livelihood of about 215,250 people living \non 76,790 ha of floodplains. The Project will enable communities \nto break out of the cycle of periodic asset replacement and move \nabove the poverty zone. This will be achieved by diminishing the \nrisk  and,  consequently,  losses  from  flood  damage,  and  by \nenhancing  development  opportunities  (e.g.,  higher  cropping \nintensities)  in  the  project  area  as  a  result  of  a  more  secure \nenvironment.  The  Project  will  prevent  average  annual  loss  of \n$4.83 million. Individual economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) \nfor 25 project schemes range from 11.3% to a 49.2%. The base-\ncase EIRR for the whole Project is 20.3%, which has been tested \nagainst  cost  overruns,  reduced  benefits,  and  delayed \nimplementation,  and  found  to  be  resilient.  The  Project  is \nconservatively estimated to reduce poverty among beneficiaries \nfrom 63% to 57%, and protect 16% of the non-poor population \nfrom becoming poor. \n \nThe  civil  works  and  proposed  pilot  social  forestry  project  are \nexpected to create a significant number of jobs for, and raise \nincomes  of,   potential  beneficiaries,   particularly  the  poor.  The \n ", " vi \n  Project is likely to generate employment of about 359,000 person-\ndays of unskilled labor. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The  project  design  has  taken  into  account  a  number  of  risk \nfactors whose potential economic impact has been assessed as \npart  of  the  economic  sensitivity  analysis.  The  main  risks  are \nthose  that  could  delay  implementation  and  benefits.  The \nimplementation  schedule  has  been  programmed  to  allow  for \npossible  disruption  due  to  flooding.  The  Project  has  the \nadvantage  of  having  completed  a  significant  amount  of \npreparatory work. Subprojects have not only been selected but \nalso  subjected  to  surveys,  investigations,  and  feasibility-level \ndesigns. Many schemes are small and have been packaged for \nparallel implementation. \n  Implementation  will  be  assisted  by  advance  procurement  and \nconsultant recruitment. Provision has also been made for project \nmanagement and supervision. \n \nThe risk that project activities will not be fully supported either at \nthe national or local (district) levels will be mitigated by requiring \nSAIC to ensure provision of key services, which must be in place \nbefore loan effectiveness. Local authorities welcome the Project \nsince flood damage creates major logistical problems, and the \nlocal  agencies  have  worked  closely  with  the  feasibility  study \nconsultants  and  been  involved  in  deciding  the  nature  of  flood \nmitigation measures. \n \nTechnical Assistance  An  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  of  $500,000 \nequivalent, to be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the \nJapan Special Fund, will provide services of 12 person-months of \ninternational and 44 person-months of domestic consultants. The \nTA  will  support  capacity  building  of  a  river  basin  and  flood \nmanagement planning cell, which will be established soon after \nloan effectivity. The cell will initially plan and manage basin-wide \nwater  resources  with  community  participation;  assess  water \nresources; and develop a strategic planning framework, national \nwater  policy,  and  cost  recovery  options.  Flood  management, \nshort- and long-term protection planning, flood zoning, watershed \nmanagement, selection of a flood-routing model to forecast and \nguide  reservoir  operation,  and  contingency  planning  for  flood \nfighting will be emphasized. \n \nADB will engage the consultants following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and arrangements acceptable to ADB for \nthe engagement of domestic consultants, using the quality- and \ncost-based selection method. \n \n \n ", "v\n ii", "     \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  Azerbaijan  for  the  Flood  Mitigation  Project.  The  report  also  describes \nproposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Supporting  River  Basin  and  Flood  Management \nPlanning, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated \nto me by the Board, will approve the TA. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  At the request of the Government of Azerbaijan, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \napproved a TA1 to prepare a flood mitigation project. The project preparatory TA (PPTA) was \ncarried out from February to August 2003. This document is based on consultants\u2019 reports; \nmissions\u2019  findings;  and  discussions  with  concerned  government  agencies,  potential  project \nbeneficiaries, and other external funding agencies. The project framework is in Appendix 1.  \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Azerbaijan has a population of 8.11 million, which grows at 0.38% per annum. About \n56% lives in urban areas and 44% (about 3.6 million people) in rural areas. Life expectancy is \n72 years and the adult literacy rate is 97%. \n4.  From independence in 1991 to 1995 the country experienced considerable political, \nsocial, and economic instability, one result of which was about 1 million refugees and internally \ndisplaced persons. Gross domestic product (GDP) in 1995 was only 44% of the 1990 level, and \nhousehold  expenditures  declined  by  50%.  In  1995  the  Government,  with  the  help  of  the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  and  World  Bank,  initiated  several  programs  to  achieve \nmacroeconomic stabilization, structural adjustment, and resumption of economic growth. These \nprograms terminated direct credits and have successfully stabilized the economy. The budget \ndeficit has been reduced to less than 2% of GDP, borrowing costs cut to 7%, and inflation rate \nreduced to 2% per annum. GDP has increased in seven successive years and is now higher \nthan in 1990. Foreign exchange reserves amount to $1.2 billion. \n5.  ADB2 notes that the economy continued its strong growth in 2002, mainly due to a \nrebound in foreign domestic investments in the oil sector. Since output growth resulted primarily \nfrom  an  increase  in  productivity,  wages  and  salaries  rose  substantially,  while  employment \nincreased only marginally. The average wage rose by 20.3% in nominal terms (17.1% in real \nterms), while unemployment is reported to have increased from 1.2% at end-2001 to 1.3% at \nend-2002. Results of recent labor market and household budget surveys, however, suggest that \ndespite the impressive economic growth of recent years, the actual unemployment rate remains \nat 15.8% (14.2% among men; 18.6% among women). Average per capita income is $700. \nBased on the official absolute poverty line of equivalent to $24.5 per capita per month,3 some \n49% of the population is classified as poor. Using a relative poverty line of $14.7 based on 60% \n___________________________ \n1  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to Azerbaijan for Flood Mitigation Project. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2003.

The food share in the total minimum consumption basket is calculated at 70%, which corresponds to \nthe actual food share in the household expenditure structure as reported in the Government\u2019s household budget \nsurvey results. \n ", "2 \n \nof median per capita monthly consumption levels, about 17% of the population is classified as \nextremely poor. Poverty is more widespread in urban (55%) than rural areas (42%). \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n6.  Sector  Context.  The  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy4  has  a  number  of \nelements designed to make income distribution equitable. The oil sector will not have much \nimpact on rural income levels, and growth opportunities must be created in the non-oil sector. \nThe agriculture sector is the primary engine of rural growth but is highly dependent on water \nresources control and management. Under Azerbaijan\u2019s climatic and topographic conditions, the \nability to manage water resources effectively and efficiently largely determines sector output and \nproductivity levels. Without well-managed irrigation facilities, crop yields have been halved, and \nwithout appropriate drainage systems, soils have become salinized and unable to grow crops. \nCrop production is highly dependent upon irrigation. Water losses are even higher than in the \nSoviet period, when they averaged 50% of supplies. Higher withdrawals per hectare (ha) are \nneeded to make up for these losses, which, in turn, overburden systems and accelerate their \ndeterioration. Drainage systems were never adequately developed, and salinization appeared \nquickly after irrigation networks spread in the 1970s\u20131980s. As drainage systems failed, the \nextent of heavily salinized areas doubled in the late 1990s. Tens of thousands of hectares have \nbeen  retired  in  Azerbaijan  because  they  no  longer  yield  crops.  A  detailed  water  sector \nassessment is in Appendix 2. \n7.  Rural  infrastructure  has  deteriorated  markedly  in  recent  years,  resulting  in  reduced \naccess  to  services,  lower  agricultural  productivity,  and  a  greater  risk  of  flood  damage  to \nsettlements and crops. While investment in physical infrastructure such as roads, irrigation and \ndrainage, potable water supply, power supply, telecommunications, and marketing facilities is \nessential to underpin rural growth strategies, investments in flood management are vital not only \nto protect these facilities and the associated settlement and agricultural lands but also to create \na secure environment to attract more investments. Thus, the Project will greatly facilitate rural \nand agriculture sector growth and ensure that rural populations gain secure livelihoods and \naccess to essential services. \n8.  Flood Management. Floods generally occur in spring and early summer and are caused \nby snowmelt combined with heavy rainfall. Flooding is particularly acute in the greater Caucasus \narea, which is traversed by a series of hill torrents with steep slopes, causing high velocities and \nhuge amounts of bed-material movement. The catchment areas of these hill torrents vary from \nless than 50 square kilometers (km2) to 350 km2, except for Goychay (1,480 km2). These hill \ntorrents  are  generally  dry  or  have  insignificant  flow  during  the  non-flooding  season.  The \ntopography and hydrologic conditions of these hill torrents do not support feasible reservoirs to \nattenuate their short-lived flood peaks. The Araz and Ganikh, however, are perennial rivers with \ncatchment areas of more than 50,000 km2 each. They have multipurpose reservoirs built across \nthem and drain into the Kur River. Samur, another perennial river, has a catchment area of \n3,620 km2. All rivers of Azerbaijan drain into Caspian Sea. \n9.  Major floods occurred in 1988, 1997, 1999, and 2002. Disastrous damage in the greater \nCaucasus area affected public buildings, 82 human settlements with a population of 246,000, \n138,000 ha of cultivated area, 38 kilometers (km) of highway, 22 km of power line, 95 km of gas \n___________________________ \n4  State Programme for Poverty Reduction and Economic Development (2003-2005), approved Presidential Decree, \n20 February 2003. ", "  3 \npipeline, and 65 km of irrigation canals and hydraulic structures. Average annual damage from \nfloods over 1980\u20131990 is estimated at $20 million.5 About 1.2 million ha are prone to floods. \nThe value of business assets at risk from flooding is about $3.7 billion. \n10.  Many areas are vulnerable to floods. They cause loss of life and property, and flood \ndamage reduces income-earning opportunities. Impacts are exacerbated by the inability of rural \npopulations to afford personal, crop, and livestock insurance. Flood protection is particularly \nimportant as the bulk of the rural population living in flood-prone areas has been rendered poor \nbecause of loss of assets and has little capacity to rebound after losses. Thus, floods worsen \nliving standards of the poor, negate any progress in reducing poverty, and can cause the non-\npoor to fall into poverty. Poor implementation of protected watershed area regulations results in \nillegal tree cutting and overgrazing, leading to heavy sediment loads after floods, seriously \ndiminishing agricultural productivity. Individuals and communities are also unwilling to invest in \nflood-prone areas. \n11.  In 1990 Azerbaijan adopted a national strategy for flood protection based entirely on \nstructural  measures.  The  approach  to  flood  management  is  so  limited  because of  lack  of \ncoordination among agencies and absence of an interministerial coordination body.6 Because of \ndeep  involvement  in  structural  measures,  Azerbaijan  has  gained  invaluable  experience  in \ndesigning and constructing flood protection walls, and many, particularly those close to major \ncities, have been properly designed, constructed, and maintained and are still serving their \npurpose.  However,  examples  of  poor  construction  and  neglected  maintenance  are  also \nnumerous, and the huge fleet of machinery for river channeling and flood fighting has not been \nrecouped during the last couple of decades and is suffering from inefficiency, reduced capacity, \nand increased operational costs. The inhabitants of flood-prone areas consider structures and \nchannelization as the most reliable flood protection measures. \n12.  The country has no concept of flood zoning. A law7 restricts encroachment on waterways \nand water bodies but only to protect water quality. Afforestation in watersheds\u20141,500\u20133,000 ha \nannually nationwide\u2014consists mainly of tree planting and is not done specifically to promote \nsustainability, reduce erosion, or improve the watershed hydrologic characteristics. The country \nhas no flood forecasting system, and the unreliable, ineffective flood warning system is based \non  voice  communication  from  some  ill-equipped  and  poorly  managed  hydrometeorological \nstations. \n13.  \u201cDo nothing\u201d is clearly not the least-cost option and not acceptable. Leaving settlements \nand croplands at risk has political, economic, and social consequences. Politically, such a \nstrategy would only highlight how rural communities receive fewer services and less attention \nthan urban communities. Economically, analysis of the project area concludes that the likely \naverage annual cost of damage is about $4.83 million. Added to this cost is the foregone \ninvestment that would be made in the absence of risk to assets.  \n14.  Relocating  settlements,  agricultural  lands,  and  infrastructure  is  neither  socially \nacceptable nor economically feasible. In many parts of the world, watershed management has \nproved effective in improving rivers\u2019 hydrologic characteristics, including reducing flood peaks \n___________________________ \n5  World Bank. 2003.

", "4 \n \nand sediment load, and stabilizing river channels. This option\u2019s success, however, is subject to \nagroclimatic  conditions  and  strict  enforcement  of  strong  legislative  instruments.  Above  all, \nwatershed management is a long process, requiring more than a decade to get results. Still, \nwatershed management may not completely solve the flood problem; some structural measures \nat  specific  locations  may  still  be  required.  Flood  zoning  is  a  nonstructural  measure  that \nregulates land use to minimize flood damage. However, flood zoning alone cannot provide flood \nprotection,  and  is  most  effective  when  combined  with  other  structural  and  nonstructural \nmeasures. \n15.  The  least-cost  solution,  therefore,  is  a  combination  of  structural  and  nonstructural \nmeasures, with due regard to the local conditions, to minimize damage and implementation \ncost, which must be considerably lower than the saved cost of damage. \n16.  Institutional Context. The key agency associated with flood management is the State \nAmelioration and Irrigation Committee (SAIC), which manages all irrigation, drainage, and flood \ncontrol infrastructure and activities. SAIC has a number of departments that design, implement, \nand manage various aspects of water resources. However, the departments work in isolation, \nand an institutional arrangement to facilitate integrated water resources management is lacking. \nThe Government has thus requested ADB\u2019s assistance in this regard. \n17.  An irrigation systems department (ISD), subordinate to SAIC and the local government, \ncontrols operation and maintenance (O&M) of irrigation and flood protection facilities in each \ndistrict.  However,  a  more  holistic  view  of  flood  management  incorporating  nonstructural \nmeasures requires the involvement of other agencies such as the Ministry of Ecology and \nNatural Resources (MENR) and its National Meteorological Department (NMD) as well as the \nparticipation of affected communities. The Government has established the State Commission \nfor Emergency Situations to deal with disasters such as floods and drought but not to coordinate \nflood prevention or warning. \n18.  SAIC\u2019s  2003  budget  is  about  $32.0  million,  of  which  about  $1.8  million  has  been \nallocated for flood protection in project districts, local staff salaries, equipment maintenance and \nuse,  and  flood  damage  repairs.  Allocation  is  about  50\u201360%  of  actual  requirements.  The \nGovernment does not charge specific fees for flood protection. Even for irrigation and drainage \nsystems, the irrigation service fee covers less than 5% of SAIC\u2019s total irrigation and drainage \nbudget.8 The low level of cost recovery is part of the Government\u2019s policy to keep costs of \nagriculture and irrigation to the farmers to a minimum until they can afford to gradually start \npaying higher fees. The Government has no plans to directly recover project investments from \nthe beneficiaries. \n19.  Government Plans and ADB Operational Strategy. The State Program on Poverty \nReduction and Economic Development, approved in February 2003, identified a number of \npriorities  to  help  promote  economic  growth,  create  jobs,  and  reduce  poverty.  Particular \nimportance is attached to creating jobs in the non-oil rural and agriculture sectors, which are \nconsidered promising. However, they need investment in physical infrastructure such as roads, \nirrigation systems, potable water supply, power supply, telecommunications, flood protection, \nand produce-marketing facilities. ADB\u2019s interim operational strategy is fully consistent with these \npriorities in its support for rural development and emphasis on physical infrastructure.  \n___________________________ \n8  World Bank. 2003. Project Appraisal Document on a Proposed Loan to the Republic of Azerbaijan for Irrigation \nDistribution System and Management Improvement Project. Washington DC. ", "  5 \n20.  Policy Dialogue. During project processing, the Government agreed to move away from \nthe  traditional  approach  of  structural  measures  for  flood  protection  and  to  consider  flood \nmanagement  as  a  component  of  holistic,  integrated  river  basin  management  with  strong \nbeneficiary participation, particularly of the poor and women. The Government agreed to (i) \ninclude nonstructural measures of watershed management, flood forecasting and warning, flood \nzoning, and capacity building for flood preparedness as project components; (ii) consult project \nbeneficiaries at all stages; (iii) engage local poor communities in afforestation and as unskilled \nlabor for civil works; (iv) give equal employment opportunities to women; (v) make adequate \nresources available on time for O&M of project facilities; and (vi) establish a river basin and \nflood management planning cell (RBFMPC) to initiate integrated river basin management. \n21.  External Assistance. The World Bank is the lead agency in irrigation and drainage, \ndrinking  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and  environmental  protection.9  Appendix 3  provides \ninformation  on  major  external  assistance  related  to  the  sector.  Other  multilaterals  include \nKreditanstalt f\u1ee7r Wiederaufbau (KfW), Islamic Development Bank, and European Union. The \nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID), Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe, and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have supported regional \nwatershed management. Some external funding agencies have also provided ad hoc assistance \nfor construction and rehabilitation of flood structures. ADB\u2019s proposed loan would be the first \nsystematic  assistance  to  reduce  flood  risk  and  simultaneously  provide  synergy  to  the \ninvestments by the other key agency, the World Bank.  \n22.  Lessons Learned. International experience suggests that floods are most effectively \naddressed using an optimal combination of structural and nonstructural measures. Structural \nmeasures are used worldwide as the most effective immediate protection from floods, and \nAzerbaijan has invaluable experience in designing walls to protect against hill torrents under a \nvariety of flow and sediment load conditions. The importance of sound watershed management \nhas  been  established  in  a  number  of  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  audit  reports.  Many \ncommunities have experienced increasing and severe flooding after storms or prolonged rain \npartly due to denuded forested uplands and watersheds. Similarly, the sector synthesis of post-\nevaluation findings in the irrigation and rural development sectors pointed out how lack of proper \nwatershed  management  endangers  irrigation  and  rural  development  projects.10  Flood \nforecasting and warning systems have established their usefulness during the last few decades \nand are now being used to efficiently operate water resources systems of Bangladesh, India, \nMalaysia,  Pakistan,  Peoples\u2019  Republic  of  China,  Philippines,  and  a  number  of  other  ADB \nmember countries. Flood zoning is now an integral part of land-use planning in most developed \ncountries and is becoming increasingly popular among developing countries. Post-evaluation \nexperience  in  flood  control  recommends  strengthening  integrated  river  basin  management. \nExperience  of  ongoing  World  Bank-financed  projects  in  Azerbaijan  suggests  that  projects \nshould (i) focus on one or few major activities; (ii) be flexible; and (iii) foster understanding and \nparticipation of all stakeholders, particularly beneficiaries. Projects are generally on schedule \nand cover areas in Sharur and Gusar, where local agencies\u2019 capacity has been found to be \nstrong. \n23.  The  Project  has  been  designed  on  the  basis  of  experience  of,  and  lessons  from, \nAzerbaijan and other countries. First, the overall design represents a balance between structural \n___________________________ \n9  The Government has recently requested the World Bank to help stop serious flooding from the Kur River. A $5-\nmillion proposal to construct levies on the upper reaches of the Kur and to manage the water levels in the \nMingechevir and Araz reservoirs is being considered. \n10  ADB. 1995. Sector Synthesis of Post-Evaluation Findings in Irrigation and Rural Development. Manila. ", "6 \n \nand nonstructural measures. The Azerbaijan experience has guided the design of structural \nmeasures.  In  designing,  and  determining  the  scope  of,  the  nonstructural  measures,  due \nconsideration was given to immediate needs, the existing situation, local conditions, capacity of \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies,  and  what  can  be  reasonably  achieved  during \nimplementation.  Finally,  the  associated  TA  will  initiate  planning  by  using  the  concept  of \nintegrated river basin management. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n24.  The  project  objective  is  to  immediately  and  systematically  improve  security  against \nrecurring floods in selected areas. The Project will establish and support sustainable flood \nmanagement  infrastructure,  plans,  and  practices,  and  thus  significantly  reduce  recurring \neconomic losses and help increase household incomes and improve living standards in the \nproject area. About 63% of project area beneficiaries11 are below the poverty line. The Project is \nexpected to reduce the incidence of poverty to 57%.  \n25.  The project design thus focuses on least-cost flood mitigation measures coupled with \ntangible assistance through an associated TA (para. 62) that will help the Government identify \nand initiate medium- to long-term comprehensive flood management. \n26.  Starting with a list of 67 candidate flood protection schemes, the Government narrowed \nthem down to 27 for PPTA, excluding the floodplains already protected by embankments and \nreservoirs, and the ones with committed funds. The consultant excluded from further study two \nschemes as they were downstream of a reservoir being constructed to have enough capacity to \nabsorb their flood peaks. For the remaining 25 schemes, the consultant confirmed the feasibility \nof providing flood protection using the criteria of historical damage, type and extent of threat, \nand potential for improvement. Thus, the Project will cover 25 schemes in 4 flood-prone areas in \n12  districts:  1  scheme  in  the  Araz  River  floodplain  in  Sharur,  Autonomous  Republic  of \nNakhchivan; 22 in 9 districts in the greater Caucasus area in the northwest; and 1 each in Gusar \nin the northeast and Astara in the southeast. While the greater Caucasus area is well known for \nflooding, the other three areas, although isolated, offer strong justification, including higher \neconomic  returns,  for  their  inclusion  in  the  Project.  Sharur,  important  for  its  agricultural \nproduction and as a link for trade with Turkey, is threatened by floods from the Araz. Likewise, \nAstara is an important trade link with Iran, and floods from the Astara River threaten the safety \nof the bridge on the highway leading to Iran. Flood protection in the Samur River in Gusar is \njustified to protect water resources projects funded by the World Bank and Islamic Development \nBank. Project districts are shown on the map. \nB.  Components and Outputs \n27.  The  project  components  are  structural  measures,  nonstructural  measures,  disaster \npreparedness and flood fighting, and project management and monitoring. \n___________________________ \n11 Poverty incidence is 49%. ", "  7 \n1.  Structural Measures \n28.  The  25  schemes  comprise  the  least-cost  feasible  solutions  to  protect  villages  and \nagricultural lands near the Araz, Ganikh, and Mazim rivers against floods occurring  on average \nonce in 10 years, and in other areas against floods occurring on average once in 50 years. The \nstructures\u2019 height has been determined by providing a suitable freeboard over the estimated \nflood water level. The proposed measures will protect 5 major towns and 43 villages, covering \n76,790 ha and inhabited by 215,250 people. \n29.  On  the  Araz,  which  runs  through  a  floodplain,  flood  protection  consists  of \nrehabilitation/construction of a 30 km embankment, with stone pitching in 10 km reaches which \nare under direct threat of erosion by an active channel too close to the embankment. \n30.  In the case of hill torrents, structures consist of the shortest feasible protection walls, \nvarying from 50 to 2,690 meters (m) long and generally on one side of the active channel to \nprotect specific areas without constricting the flow, altering the flow regime, or aggravating \nflooding upstream or downstream. Protective structures include concrete gravity walls, stone \nconcrete walls, reinforced concrete walls, and stone filling. Selection of the type of structure for \na specific location was based on the least-cost solution, considering slope, velocity, discharge, \nquantity, and size of the hill torrents\u2019 bed load, and availability of construction materials. All \ntogether, the 38 protection walls in 22 schemes in 11 districts are 23.0 km long, while stone \nfilling will be provided at two locations over 4.2 km. \n31.  A list of the 25 schemes together with key design parameters and selection criteria is in \nAppendix 4. The total cost of the proposed structures, including the cost of a part of consulting \nservices for surveys, design, and construction supervision is estimated at $22.69 million. \n2.  Nonstructural Measures \n32.  Nonstructural  measures  constitute  watershed  management,  flood  forecasting  and \nwarning, and flood zoning. \na.  Watershed Management \n33.  Degradation of the catchments because of poor management during the last couple of \ndecades has led to higher flood peaks and larger sediment loads. To introduce afforestation as \na tool for long-term flood management, gully stabilization, and sediment control, the Project will \nset up a pilot scheme for community-based afforestation of 550 ha of degraded areas in the \ncatchment of Kishchay hill torrent, where agroclimatic conditions are favorable and communities \nand the implementing agency are already familiar with and involved in government-financed \nafforestation. Some nurseries have species suitable for planting in the pilot area. Of the 550 ha, \n275 ha will involve rehabilitation, and 275 ha, new afforestation. MENR\u2019s Forestry Development \nDepartment (FDD) will be the subcomponent\u2019s implementing agency. The afforestation target \nhas been limited to 550 ha, keeping in view the 4-year implementation period, and the fact that \nthis is the first project of its type in the country. FDD, with project consultants\u2019 guidance, will \ndevelop a community-based afforestation program, including nursery management. As trees \ntake a long time to grow, subcomponent benefits by the end of implementation are difficult to \nquantify. Nonetheless, lessons and experience from this pilot project will be useful and can be \nreplicated in FDD\u2019s afforestation program and any future externally financed project. The total \nsubcomponent cost is estimated at $250,000. ", "8 \n \nb.  Flood Forecasting and Warning \n34.  Azerbaijan  has  no  flood  forecasting  system,  and  the  flood  warning  system  is  less \neffective because of the absence of meteorological stations at 2,000\u20132,500 m altitude, and \nmany stations and telemetric network do not function. To develop flood forecasting, improve \ndistrict administrations\u2019 warning capability, and facilitate earlier warning, the Project proposes to \nrehabilitate eight and establish five new meteorological stations in the catchment of the project \nhill  torrents  and  telemetrically  connect  them  to  their  respective  district  offices.  The \nmeteorological stations to be rehabilitated include Nakhchivan, Zagatala, Alibay, Sheki, Gabala, \nIsmailly, Quba, and Astara. They will be provided with barographs, hydrographs, thermographs, \nelectronic barometers, and telemetric systems. The new stations will also be equipped with \ntelemetric systems for automatic transmission of data and will be built at 2,000\u20132,500 m altitude \nin  the  catchments  of  Mazimchay,  Katekchay,  Talachay,  Kurmukhchay,  and  Kishchay  hill \ntorrents. NMD will help prepare specifications for procurement, evaluate the bids, and install the \nstations. They will be integrated into the NMD network for O&M. Using hydrometeorological data \ncollected from the network and an ADB-financed TA (para. 62), a suitable flood-routing model \nwill  be  selected  to  forecast  floods  and  guide  reservoir  operations.  The  total  cost  of  this \nsubcomponent is estimated at $250,000. \nc.  Flood Zoning \n35.  Flood zoning is an important nonstructural measure, which, with hardly any investment \nin physical infrastructure, helps minimize damage even from extreme flooding. ADB proposes \nthat the Government issue a resolution defining flood zones (such as prohibitive, restrictive, and \nwarning zones) and specifying land uses for each. SAIC will run an information campaign to \nraise public awareness of the hazards associated with land uses that violate the resolution\u2019s \nregulations. SAIC will also be required to demarcate flood zones for each of project area \nriver/hill torrent, considering existing land uses. To highlight the importance of flood zoning to \nmanage floods, the Government agreed to issue the resolution as a condition for loan effectivity. \nThe Government also agreed to submit to ADB a time-bound action plan to implement flood \nzones in the project area rivers/hill torrents within 1 year of loan effectivity. SAIC will work \nclosely on flood zoning with ISDs, State Committee for Land and Cartography, and MENR. \n3.  Disaster Preparedness and Flood Fighting \n36.  To prepare organizations, physical facilities, and residents to fight floods, the Project \nproposes institutional streamlining, strengthening, and building capacity of SAIC and ISDs, and \nprocurement of O&M equipment. \n37.  SAIC will, within 1 month after loan effectivity, establish an RBFMPC. The cell will \ninitially  ensure  basin-wide  planning  and  management  of  water  resources  with  community \nparticipation;  assessment  or  water  resources;  and  development  of  a  strategic  planning \nframework, national water policy, and cost recovery options. Qualified and trained staff from \nvarious SAIC units will be transferred to the cell and their capacity enhanced with support of \ninternational and domestic consultants provided under the associated TA discussed in para. 62. \nAs the capacity of the cell improves, it will undertake additional associated tasks such as \ncoordinating with international agencies; scrutinizing water resources projects, water allocation, \nand environmental protection and social measures; and addressing cost recovery. \n38.  The  Project  will  enhance  ISDs\u2019  O&M  capacity  by  providing  5  bulldozers  and  5 \nexcavators to maintain the active river channels so they do not threaten flood protection and ", "  9 \nother important infrastructure and settlements. The total cost of this equipment is estimated at \n$1.76  million.  ISDs  will  use  their  O&M  staff  and  budget  to  operate  the  existing  and  new \nequipment and excavate 600,000 m3 during the first year, 1.7 million m3 during the second year, \nand 1.7 million m3 during the third year of implementation. \n4.  Project Management and Monitoring \n39.  The Project will establish, and provide support to, the project management office (PMO) \nin SAIC, Baku; and two project implementation units (PIUs), one in Sharur, Nakhchivan, and the \nother in Sheki. Consultants will train, advise, and support PMO and PIU staff. A monitoring and \nevaluation (M&E) unit will be established in the PMO within one month after the loan becomes \neffective  to  implement  the  environmental  monitoring  program  (EMP)  recommended  in  the \nsummary initial environmental examination (SIEE, Supplementary Appendix E) prepared under \nthe PPTA to monitor the Project\u2019s environmental and social impacts. Specifically, the M&E unit \nwill  (i)  collect,  collate,  and  analyze  baseline  data  on  economic,  social,  and  environmental \naspects within the project area; (ii) monitor benefits during project implementation; (iii) evaluate \nthe Project\u2019s economic, social, and environmental impacts within the selected systems; and (iv) \nmonitor  afforestation.  The  unit  will  particularly  monitor  (i)  income  opportunities  and  other \nresources provided under the Project to the vulnerable, poor, and women; (ii) reduction in \nvulnerability of households to flood damage; and (iii) participation of women in community \nactivities. For environmental monitoring, data on the geography and morphology of active river \nchannels, quality of water and soils, and groundwater depth and quality will be collected and \nanalyzed. Project performance and M&E will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines on \nproject performance management systems. The organization chart for project implementation is \nin Appendix 5. \n40.  To monitor the Project\u2019s social and poverty impacts, during the first year of project \nimplementation the M&E unit will compile a benchmark database to provide a socioeconomic \nprofile of beneficiary communities. Key indicators will be tracked during project implementation, \nand  benchmark  and  project  completion  situations  compared.  The  total  cost  of  the  project \nmanagement and monitoring component is estimated at $0.868 million, excluding the cost of \nconsulting services. \nC.  Cost Estimates \n41.  The total project cost is estimated at $29.35 million equivalent, comprising $8.55 million \nin foreign exchange (29%) and $20.80 million equivalent (71%) in local currency. Taxes and \nduties included in the cost estimate are estimated at $1.03 million. The costs are summarized in \nTable  1  and  detailed  in  Appendix  6,  while  detailed  cost  and  financing  plan  tables  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \nD.  Financing Plan \n42.  ADB will provide a loan equivalent to $22 million from its Special Funds resources to \nfinance about 75% of the total project cost. The loan will finance the full amount of the foreign \nexchange costs estimated at $8.55 million, and about 65% of the local currency costs estimated \nat $13.45 million. The provision for local cost financing under the Loan is justified due to country \neconomic situation and project considerations. The bulk of ADB\u2019s local cost financing will be for \ncivil  works.  It  also  includes  local  consulting  services  (including  project  supervision  and \nmonitoring), office furniture and equipment, and recurrent costs. The Government will provide \nthe remaining local currency costs estimated at $7.35 million equivalent. The Borrower will be ", "10 \n \nthe Republic of Azerbaijan.

The Government will make the loan proceeds available to the Project through budgetary \nappropriations. The Ministry of Finance will make counterpart fund allocations to SAIC for the \nProject on a grant basis. This is Azerbaijan\u2019s first ADB loan, and it will be provided from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an \ninterest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management and Coordination \n44.  SAIC will be the Project\u2019s executing agency, and the SAIC chair will be designated \nproject director with overall responsibility for project implementation. A PMO will be established \nwithin SAIC to manage the Project\u2019s daily activities, and to liaise with ADB and coordinating \nbodies. The PMO will also implement project works in Gusar and Astara. The Nakhchivan and ", "  11 \nSheki  PIUs  will  implement  the  Project  in  their  areas,  and  liaise  with  the  PMO,  local \nadministration, and beneficiaries. The PMO will be led by a full-time project manager, and the \nPIUs by deputy project managers. Key staff will be selected by a panel of experts appointed by \nthe Government and approved by ADB. Staff selected will need ADB\u2019s endorsement. \n45.  The high-level project steering committee established during project preparation will \ncontinue to function during project implementation to provide policy guidance and facilitate \ncentral interministerial coordination. A working group will be established to facilitate operational \ncoordination of interministerial activities at the district level, assist the PIUs, and coordinate \nactivities involving more than one ministry. FDD will be the implementing agency for the pilot \ncommunity afforestation subcomponent while the PMO will coordinate with NMD to prepare \nspecifications  and  evaluation  of  bids  for  procurement  of  meteorological  equipment.  The \norganization chart for project implementation is in Appendix 5. \n2.  Implementation Period \n46.  The  project  will  be  implemented  in  4  years  starting  April  2004.  The  project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 7.  \n3.  Procurement \n47.  Goods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  Major  contracts  for  equipment  costing  $500,000  equivalent  or  more  will  be \nawarded through ADB\u2019s international competitive bidding procedures. Direct purchase will be \nallowed for contracts valued at $100,000 equivalent or less. \n48.  Civil works contracts costing $1 million equivalent or more will be carried out using \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures,  while  those  valued  at  less  than  $1  million \nequivalent will be carried out using local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. \nLocal contractors have the expertise, experience, and capacity to undertake these contracts. If \nworks\u2019 size, nature, and location make them unsuitable for competitive bidding, and if the ISD \nhas the facilities and capacity to implement them expeditiously and at a reasonable cost, then \nADB may agree to force-account procedures. The upper limit for a force-account works package \nwill be $50,000. The award of all civil works contracts will be subject to ADB approval. The \nindicative list of the major contract packages is in Appendix 8, while the list of equipment to be \nprocured is in Appendix 9. \n4.  Advance Procurement Action \n49.  The Government has requested ADB\u2019s approval of advance action for procurement of \nequipment  and  civil  works  to  expedite  project  implementation.  Advance  recruitment  of \nconsultants will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB, and advance procurement action will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The Government was informed that approval of advance \naction does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n5.  Consulting Services \n50.  The Project will finance 45 person-months of international and 789 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services to assist SAIC, in project management, preparation of detailed \ndesign  and  tender  documents,  contract  awards,  construction  supervision,  and  M&E.  The ", "12 \n \nGovernment will select and engage the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. International consultants will be recruited through international consulting \nfirms  selected  and  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method,  while \ndomestic  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 10. The total \ncost of consulting services is estimated at $1.435 million. \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n51.  To  expedite  project  implementation  through  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds,  the \nGovernment will establish an imprest account promptly after the loan effectiveness with an initial \ndeposit of $1 million equivalent from loan proceeds. The imprest account will be established at a \ncommercial bank acceptable to ADB, and will be managed and liquidated in accordance with \ndetailed arrangements agreed on by the Government and ADB, consistent with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure will be used to reimburse \nexpenditures and liquidate the imprest account for payments, not exceeding $50,000 equivalent \nper contract. Force-account work procedures will be used to reimburse expenditures for civil \nworks involving the use of Borrower\u2019s work force, equipment, and other resources. Although this \nwill be the first ADB-financed project to Azerbaijan, the Borrower is implementing a number of \nWorld Bank-financed projects and has acquired sufficient financial capabilities. \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n52.  SAIC will submit brief quarterly and annual reports to ADB indicating progress made and \nproblems encountered during the review period, steps taken or proposed to be taken to remedy \nthe  problems,  proposed  program  of  activities,  and  expected  progress  during  the  following \nperiod. Within 3 months of physical project completion, the Government will submit to ADB a \ncompletion report providing details about implementation, costs, benefits, and other information \nrequested by ADB.  \n53.  SAIC will maintain separate project accounts and financial statements, which will be \naudited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. A separate audit opinion on the \nuse of the imprest account and statement of expenditures procedures will be included in the \nannual audit report. The Government will provide ADB with an audited report, together with \naudited accounts and financial statements 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. \n54.  An ADB-financed study12 concluded that much remains to be done to align Azerbaijan \naccounting  and  auditing  arrangements  with  international  practices,  and  that  internationally \ncompatible arrangements can only be successfully implemented with the support of skilled \naccountancy professionals. In view of this, the Chamber of Accounts will support efforts to \nimprove the Government\u2019s accounting and reduce corruption (para. 61). \n55.  The Government was informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited accounts, \nwhich covers failure to submit audited accounts and financial statements by the due date. If the \ndelay in submitting financial statement is more than 6 months, ADB will not issue a commitment \nletter and may not approve new contract awards. If the delay is more than 12 months, loan \n___________________________ \n12 ADB. 2002. Diagnostic Study of Accounting and Auditing Practices in Selected Developing Member Countries. \nManila. ", "  13 \ndisbursements may be suspended or the loan may be canceled. More details on fiduciary \ncontrols are in Appendix 11. \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n56.  The Project provides for an elaborate system of performance M&E (paras. 39\u201340). \n57.  The Government and ADB will jointly review the Project twice yearly to monitor and \nevaluate the Project as specified in paras. 39\u201340. Particular emphasis will be given to project \nimplementation  monitoring,  including  (i)  implementation  status,  (ii)  design  and  construction \nstandards, (iii) physical progress and disbursements in relation to the implementation schedule, \n(iv)  performance  of  consultants  and  contractors,  and  (v)  status  of  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants.  Detailed  technical  effectiveness  of  the  flood  mitigation  strategy  and  protection \nmeasures  will  be  assessed  during  midterm  review  proposed  during  the  second  year  of \nimplementation. Based on the outcome of this review, an optimal design and implementation \napproach will be identified for the remaining implementation period. The midterm review will also \nevaluate (i) project progress, including design, stakeholder participation, construction quality, \nand possibilities of modifying the project scope; (ii) social and environmental impacts; (iii) future \nimplementation plans and targets; (iv) effectiveness of the project management structures and \nimplementation arrangements; and (v) institutional sustainability and progress on developing an \nadequate institutional framework. \n9.  Operation and Maintenance, and Cost Recovery \n58.  ISDs will maintain completed civil works, and O&M of project machinery. SAIC will \nensure  availability  of  adequate  budgetary  resources  for  salaries  of  the  staff,  purchase  of \nrequired  materials,  maintenance  of  civil  works,  and  O&M  of  machinery.  FDD,  which  is \nresponsible for afforestation in the pilot area, will closely monitor the afforested project area for \nproper upkeep and growth of trees through community participation management after project \ncompletion.  NMD  will  be  responsible  for  O&M  of  project  meteorological  stations  and  their \nintegration into the existing network. NMD will also ensure that data collected by these stations \nis readily available for flood forecasting and warning. \n59.  The sustainability of flood protection infrastructure depends upon the quality of annual \nmaintenance. The additional annual O&M cost of project structures is estimated at $630,000, \nwhich could be financed by (i) increasing the SAIC budget, (ii) using the current SAIC budget \nthrough reallocations as the additional requirement is less than 2%, and (iii) adding a flood \nprotection supplement to the basic land tax in affected districts. Given the public-good nature of \nthe benefits, the Government has assured that it will provide resources for adequate O&M of \nproject facilities. The imposition of a surcharge to the basic land tax was considered but was not \nfound practical now. Project districts contribute about $1.2 million annually in land tax, which is \nlevied at a variable rate ranging from $1.50/ha to $12.00/ha depending upon the quality/value of \nthe land. This tax revenue is retained by the local authorities and is not used for flood protection. \nThe  land  tax  supplement,  if  imposed,  would  increase  the  average  annual  per  household \ncontribution in the project districts from $24 to $32. The ability of households to pay this \nincrease is questionable, since 63% are below the poverty line and the current land tax recovery \nrate is about 60%. Many farm households are also under pressure to pay increased charges for \nirrigation system O&M. The main source of income is produce, which is often consumed by the \nfamily. Cash income may be as low as 30% of notional family income. The more realistic \nstrategy to ensure adequate O&M activity would be to increase the budget and community \nparticipation.  Beneficiary  communities  could  contribute  labor  if  the  responsible  agencies ", "14 \n \nprovided the materials. In effect, O&M activities would become an extension of community \nparticipation in project implementation except that labor would no longer be wage earning. Flood \nprotection would increase the value of the land, which would result in higher taxation rates and \nthus  increased  revenue.  Cost  recovery  will  be  further  examined  under  the  associated  TA \n(Appendix 12). \n10.  Governance and Anticorruption \n60.  During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to the concerned \ngovernment officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption in ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement, particularly the need for bidders, suppliers, and contractors to \nobserve  the  highest  standards  of  ethics  in  procurement  and  execution  of  ADB-financed \ncontracts, and the sanctions for fraud and corruption. Similarly, the anticorruption provisions in \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants were discussed. \n61.  A  comprehensive  anticorruption  program  is  being  developed  as  part  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s overall effort to enhance governance. To this end, the Azerbaijan Accounting \nChamber\u2014Azerbaijan\u2019s supreme audit institution\u2014has been established. It has the authority to \naudit all government bodies, including all budgetary and extra-budgetary organizations, and \nfunds and will publicly report its findings. \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n62.  An associated grant-financed TA will be provided to help establish, and build capacity of, \nRBFMPC. It will initially ensure planning and management of basin-wide water resources with \ncommunity participation; assessment of water resources; and development of strategic planning \nframework, national water policy, and cost recovery options. Flood management, short- and \nlong-term protection planning, flood zoning, watershed management, selection of a flood-routing \nmodel to forecast and guide reservoir operation, and contingency planning to fight floods will be \nemphasized. The TA will develop the cell\u2019s capacity by providing hands-on training to staff. As \nthe  capacity  of  the  cell  improves,  it  will  undertake  additional  associated  tasks  such  as \ninstitutional streamlining, coordination with other ministries and international agencies, scrutiny \nof  water  resources  projects,  water  allocation,  and  environmental  protection  and  social \nmeasures. The cell could be a precursor of a neutral apex body mandated to manage national \nwater  resources.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $635,000  equivalent,  of  which \n$500,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The TA will finance the services of 12 person-months of international and \n44 person-months of domestic consultants. Details of the TA are in Appendix 12. \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Impacts \n1.  Economic Analysis \n63.  The  Project  will  enable  communities  to  break  out  of  the  cycle  of  periodic  asset \nreplacement and move many households above the poverty line by diminishing the risk and, \nconsequently, the losses from flood damage, and enhance development opportunities (e.g., \nhigher cropping intensities) as a result of a more secure environment. Out of 76,790 ha, about \n43,515 ha inhabited by 215,250 people comprising 44,350 households will directly benefit from \nthe Project. ", "  15 \n64.  The economic analysis is based on measurable benefits, which relate primarily to the \nannualized cost of averted flood damage. The Project will prevent average annual loss of $4.83 \nmillion.  Improved  protection  will  also  allow  further  development  because  the  risk  to  such \ndevelopment  from  flooding  is  minimal.  Enhanced  development  possibilities  have  not  been \nanalyzed in detail. Nonetheless, the key elements and their order of magnitude deduced from \nthe situation in adjacent but less vulnerable areas indicate that these investments will result in \nunmeasured  project  benefits  at  least  equal  to  those  that  have  been  measured.  Economic \nanalysis  of  the  Project  has  been  undertaken  based  on  constant  2003  prices  and  price \nrelativities, and using techniques that measure public investment efficiency. Economic costs and \nbenefits were estimated using border prices for inputs and outputs. Where appropriate, these \nprices have been prepared using World Bank commodity prices for May 2003. Local costs were \nestimated using financial data adjusted by the appropriate conversion factors. \n65.  The  most  widely  applicable  conversion  factor  used  in  the  analysis  is  the  standard \nconversion factor, which represents the ratio of all prices in the domestic economy to their \ninternational comparators. Using the weighted average of import and export tariffs, excluding \nsubsidies, the standard conversion factor has been calculated as 0.95. The other important \nconversion factor is the shadow wage rate. In rural areas underemployment is significant and \nwage-earning employment highly seasonal. Therefore, the opportunity cost of unskilled labor is \nconsidered to be lower than the market rate. The shadow wage rate is estimated at 75% of the \nmarket rate. Skilled labor in rural areas has a higher market rate, and wage rates are much \nfirmer due to the shortage of technical skills outside urban centers. For skilled labor a standard \nconversion factor of 0.95 has been applied. \n66.  Project benefits (averted flood damage) have been estimated in a number of steps. First, \nthe  types  of  assets  that  have  been  and  are  likely  to  be  damaged  were  divided  into  five \ncategories: crops, housing, infrastructure, other physical assets, and indirect damage. Potential \ndamage levels against flood design parameters for each category were determined per hectare  \nand then aggregated to give a composite value per hectare for all types of damage. Second, the \nper hectare value was multiplied by the estimated protected area to give a total value of \npotential damage against flood design parameters for each scheme and for the Project as a \nwhole. The third step was to calculate the average annual cost of damage, taking into account \nflood frequency. Finally, the aggregate annual cost of damage (benefits) is matched against the \neconomic costs and an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) obtained from the net benefit \nstream. \n67.  The economic costs of project implementation have been derived from financial costs, \ntaking into account that (i) interest during construction, price contingencies, and taxes and \nduties  were  excluded;  and  (iii)  local  financial  costs  were  converted  to  economic  costs  by \napplying the relevant conversion factors. EIRRs were calculated for each scheme and for the \nProject as a whole. Individual EIRRs range from 13.3% to 49.2%. Only six out of 25 schemes \nhave an EIRR below 15%, and one below 12%. These schemes have been retained because (i) \nthey are a part of a cluster and their omission would be unfair, (ii) the EIRR shortfall is marginal \nand far outweighed by unmeasured benefits, and (iii) the schemes are small and the overall \nproject EIRR remains extremely robust. The base-case EIRR for the whole Project is 20.3%. \nThis  base  case  has  been  tested  against  cost  overruns,  reduced  benefits,  and  delayed \nimplementation. A 10.0% increase in costs reduces the EIRR to 18.2%. A 10.0% reduction in \nthe price of wheat reduces the EIRR to 19.4%, and a 10.0% reduction in benefits reduces it to \n18.0%. The EIRR is reduced to 12% when investment costs rise by 53% or benefits fall by 35%. \nA combination of 10.0% increase in costs and 10.0% reduction in benefits reduces the EIRR to ", "16 \n \n16.1%. Thus, the project EIRR is resilient to the most likely causes of lower-than-expected \nperformance. Economic analysis details are in Appendix 13. \n2.  Poverty Impacts and Social Development Strategy \n68.  In the project area, flooding is an important source of vulnerability. An estimated 215,250 \npeople will directly benefit from the Project through avoided damage to 44,350 houses on \n43,515 ha. About 79% of the population receives less than $1 per day per capita per month, \n63% have incomes below the official poverty line of $0.80 per day. About 16% of the population \nearns only $0.20 more than those officially classified as poor. A flood can easily erode this \nincremental income and make this segment of the population poor. The quantifiable benefits\u2014\naverage annual avoided damage of $4.83 million\u2014translate to 16% of average annual per \ncapita income and 6% of the annual per capita poverty threshold. The Project will also benefit \nthe poor through reduced damage to personal property, and protection of livelihood sources. \nBased on income distribution data from the household budget survey and the projected increase \nin incomes due to the Project, 6.4% of the population will benefit from increased income and \nclear the poverty threshold. The Project is thus conservatively estimated to reduce poverty \namong  beneficiaries  from  63%  to  57%  and  protect  16%  of  the  non-poor  population  from \nbecoming poor. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 14 while the \nsocial and poverty impact assessment is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n69.  The participatory approach was initiated during project design and is an ongoing activity \nthat will be further strengthened during project implementation. Participatory activities prioritize \nthe interests of the poor, women, and vulnerable groups. Community management is envisioned \nfor watershed management and flood protection structure maintenance, and will be facilitated by \ncommunity  training  and  community-based  organization  formation.  Contractors  will  hire \ncommunity residents, with appropriate representation from the poor and women, and provide \nthem with skills to maintain the Project. \n70.  The  Project  will  provide  direct  and  indirect  benefits  to  the  poor  and  vulnerable \npopulation13 primarily through avoided loss to life and property, damage resulting in reduced \nincome-earning opportunities, and foregone opportunities. Women will benefit through reduced \nflood-related work, project jobs, and improved living standards. The Project is estimated to \ngenerate 359,000 person-days of unskilled labor and will ensure employment of poor residents \nand equal opportunities and pay for women. The community watershed management program \nwill train residents, and raise their awareness of the need, to protect the watershed. The Project \nwill facilitate the formation of community-based organizations for watershed management and \nflood  protection  structure  maintenance.  The  Project  will  not  affect  indigenous  peoples  or \naffordability of goods and services. \n3.  Environmental Assessment and Monitoring \n71.  An Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) was conducted for five project schemes, with \ntwo representing 22 subschemes in the greater Caucasus area.14 The IEE has concluded that \nnone of the project schemes are in environmentally sensitive areas, and the potential negative \n___________________________ \n13 Vulnerable people in the project area (internally  displaced persons, homeless, female-headed/single-parent \nfamilies, orphans, and disabled persons) constitute 3.5% of the total population. \n14 The project schemes in the greater Caucasus area have been divided into two groups based on watershed \ncharacteristics: geology, geomorphology, soil type, climate, and vegetation. Kishchay hill torrent near Sheki (group \nA) and Damiraparanchay hill torrent near Gabala (group B) are the representative catchments. They are close to \nbig towns and could thus be subjected to maximum negative environmental impacts. ", "  17 \nproject  impacts  on  the  environment  are  localized,  short  term,  not  significant,  and  can  be \nmitigated. Therefore, a full-scale environmental impact assessment is not needed. \n72.  The proposed structures will be constructed along the rivers/hill torrents on government \nproperty and so the Project will not be engaged in land acquisition. The Project, through various \nflood management measures, will help reduce human, property, livelihood, and environmental \ndamage. The Project will have a positive impact on the project area environment particularly on \nterrestrial habitats, by improving flood control capacity, reducing flood damage, and enhancing \nthe local environment and institutional capacity for flood control. The hill torrents bring debris \nduring floods, covering vast areas and destroying valuable croplands. While protecting these \ncroplands, the proposed structures will not obstruct river flows or flooding of unprotected, mainly \nwaste, land. Therefore, the measures are not likely to significantly reduce the benefits of floods \nsuch as groundwater and wetland recharge, and addition of soil nutrients to wasteland, which \nserves as pasture. Afforestation in the watershed of Kishchay hill torrent will help check soil \nerosion,  stabilize  gullies,  reduce  silt  load,  and  improve  hydrologic  characteristics  of  the \nwatershed, and thus have a long-term positive environmental impact on the watershed and \ndownstream areas. Flood zoning will also develop awareness regarding safe land use for \ndifferent geographic areas and thus lay the foundation for proper and secure land use, which \nwill have a long-term beneficial impact. \n73.  Considering that the project works are generally small and widespread, and that skilled \nand  nonskilled  labor  is  available  locally,  construction  camps  will  generally  be  small. \nNonetheless, attention will be paid to social discipline, education, and control and safeguards in \nwastewater and solid waste disposal. Erosion of unconsolidated material in areas with bare soil, \nsuch  as  embankments  and  construction  sites,  will  be  controlled  by  planning,  staged \nconstruction, and revegetation to minimize areas that are exposed to rainfall for any length of \ntime. Careful planning and enforcement of quality control procedures during construction will \nensure protection of workers\u2019 health, avoidance of accidents, and control of environmental \npollution by noise and dust. \n74.  As per recommendation of the IEE, an M&E unit will be established in the PMO which, \namong other tasks, will implement an environmental monitoring program and recommended \nmitigation measures (para. 39). Adequate O&M measures must be used to control negative \nenvironmental impacts. The Project has been designed not to have any negative impacts on the \nenvironment, and none have been identified. The Government has assured implementation of \nthe environmental management plan (EMP) developed during project processing, and mitigative \nmeasures described in the IEE. A summary of environmental analysis is in Appendix 15. The \nsummary IEE and EMP are in Supplementary Appendixes E and F respectively. \nB.  Resettlement \n75.  Protection  structures  will  be  on  the  banks  of  hill  torrents  or  rivers  and  have  been \ndesigned to avoid involuntary resettlement. Hill torrents do not have water year-round and are \nnot used as a resource in daily life. Project design ensures that structures will be built in areas \nnot used for residential or livelihood purposes and will have no impact on access or movement. \nIn perennial rivers, design of new protection structures has avoided potential displacement. No \nsquatters live on government land where structures will be located. PPTA consultants confirmed ", "18 \n \nduring their visits to each site that structures will be built on government land, and no land \nacquisition is envisaged.15 \nC.  Risks and Safeguards \n76.  The project design has taken into account a number of risk factors whose potential \neconomic impact has been assessed as part of the economic sensitivity analysis. All have been \nshown to have modest adverse consequences. The main risks are those that could delay \nimplementation and benefits. The implementation schedule has been programmed to allow for \npossible disruption due to flooding. Although floods are short, key works will not be scheduled \nwhen flooding is a high probability. The mild winters do not normally halt construction activity, \nbut heavy snowfall may slow down construction in some schemes.  \n77.  The Project has completed a significant amount of preparatory work. Subprojects have \nbeen prepared to feasibility-level designs and packaged to implement many small individual \nschemes in parallel. The project preparatory unit\u2019s tasks include advance procurement action \n(para. 49), which will ensure avoidance of initial implementation delays. \n78.  A  further  risk  is  that  project  activities  may  not  be  fully  supported  locally.  PPTA \nconsultants thus worked closely with local agencies to select schemes and decide the nature of \nflood mitigation measures. Local authorities welcomed the Project as it will relieve them of a \nhuge logistical burden. Finally, the risk of inadequate O&M of project facilities is addressed \nthrough (i) minimal O&M requirements of the concrete structures; (ii) development of strong \nbeneficiary ownership for the structures through an information awareness campaign that will \nfacilitate early detection of potential problems and beneficiaries\u2019 undertaking minor O&M on their \nown; (iii) provision of O&M equipment; and (iv) government assurances regarding allocation of \nadequate O&M budget, and proper and timely maintenance of the structures. \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n79.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and SAIC have given following, \nwhich are incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  The Government will cause MENR to (a) conduct public awareness activities in the \nbeneficiary communities on the importance of watershed management and how it \nmitigates  flood  damage,  (b)  organize  community-based  groups  for  the \nmaintenance  of  afforested  areas,  and  (c)  employ  labor  for  afforestation  from \namong members of the local community in accordance with the eligibility criteria \nagreed on between the Government and ADB. \n(ii)  The Government will cause SAIC to conduct (a) an information campaign to raise \npublic awareness of the risks and hazards associated with violation of land-use \nregulations in various flood zones as specified in the flood-zoning resolution (para. \n35),  and  (b)  public  awareness  activities  on  maintenance  of  flood  protection \nstructures. \n___________________________ \n15 Decree 56 (March 2002), to protect water quality, prohibits occupation or use of a minimum 50 m of land on both \nsides of the rivers. With the proposed protection structures designed within 50 m of riverbanks, enforcement of the \ndecree ensures no involuntary resettlement. ", "  19   \n(iii)  The Government will submit to ADB, within 1 year of loan effectivity, a time-bound \naction  plan  to  implement  flood  zones  in  the  project  area  rivers/hill  torrents  in \naccordance with the new legislation. \n(iv)  The Government will meet the target for river channeling as specified in para. 38. \n(v)  The Government will cause SAIC to ensure close association of ISDs with the \nPMO  at  all  stages  of  project  implementation,  including  carrying  out  surveys, \ndesign, and procurement. \n(vi)  The  Government  will  allocate  on  time  adequate  staff  and  other  resources  to \nmaintain forests rehabilitated/established under the Project with participation of \nbeneficiary communities \n(vii)  The  Government  will  ensure  effective  implementation  of  legislation  to  protect \nforests and designated non-grazing land in the watersheds. \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that the project meteorological stations and related \nfacilities  are  promptly  integrated  into  the  existing  network  for  effective  flood \nforecasting and warning. \n(ix)  For  proper  flood  forecasting  and  warning,  the  Government  will  exchange \ninformation and collaboration with neighboring countries within the framework of \nintergovernmental arrangements. \n(x)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  women  are  given  equal  employment \nopportunities under the Project and (b) men and women workers are remunerated \nequally for work of equal value. \n(xi)  The Government will implement the EMP and mitigative measures given in SIEE. \n(xii)  The Government will ensure that (a) technical design for the project facilities does \nnot  require  land  acquisition  and/or  involuntary  settlement,  and  (b)  contract \npackages exclude requirements for land acquisition and/or involuntary settlement. \n(xiii)  The Government will ensure that the RBFMPC is established within one month \nafter loan effective date. \n(xiv)  The  Government  will  ensure  that,  after  completion,  the  flood  protection  works \nconstructed/rehabilitated  under  the  Project  are  appropriately  maintained  by \nrespective ISDs with the participation of the beneficiary communities. \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n80.  The Government agreed that the loan will not be declared effective unless (i) a PMO has \nbeen established in Baku and key staff appointed; (ii) PIUs have been established, one in \nSharur and the other in Sheki districts, and the key staff appointed; and (iii) the Government has \nissued a resolution defining flood protection zones to minimize flood damage and specifying \nland uses for each flood zone. \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n81.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 15,366,000 to the Republic of Azerbaijan for \nthe Flood Mitigation Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement  presented to the \nBoard. \n                  John Lintjer \n19 November 2003                   Vice-President\n ", "20 Appendix 1     \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Indicators/Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nSummary  and Risks \nGoal       \nProvide pro-poor  \u2022  Increased household incomes  \u2022  National, regional, and  \u2022  Policy environment supports \neconomic growth  \u2022  Poverty incidence in the project  district statistics, and  economic growth in the project \nthrough sustainable and  areas reduced from 63% to 57%  sample surveys  area \nintegrated flood    \u2022  No exceptionally high floods \nmanagement  during project implementation  \ninfrastructure, plans, \nand practices \nObjective       \nImmediately improve  \u2022  Prevention of average annual  \u2022  Baseline and impact  \u2022  Good working relationship \nthe level of protection  losses of $4.83 million caused by  monitoring surveys  between the State Amelioration \nagainst recurring flood  recurring floods to 5 major towns  \u2022  Monitoring and  and Irrigation Committee (SAIC) \ndamage in key selected  and 43 villages covering 76,790  evaluation reports  and irrigation systems \nareas  hectares (ha) and inhabited by  \u2022  Loan review missions   departments (ISDs) at the \n215,250 persons  \u2022  Project completion  district level \n\u2022  Incidence of flooding of crops  report  \u2022  Agriculture sector programs \nand settlements reduced    support crop intensification \n\u2022  Insurance claims reduced  \u2022  Capacity-building measures \n  are fully implemented  \nOutputs       \n1.

Water Resources Assessment \n1.  Available Water Resources \n1.  Azerbaijan  is  a  downstream  country  within  the  river  basins  that  supply  its  water \nresources. Only 30% of the country\u2019s available water supply is generated inside its borders. \nAvailable water resources average around 32.1 cubic kilometers (km3) per year, with high inter-\nyear variability. The largest rivers, the Kur and Araz, account for around 80% of total resources, \nand  their  catchment  area  covers  80%  of  the  country.1  Fresh  groundwater  reserves  are \nestimated at 4.2 km3. Substantial portions of available water resources are stored in reservoirs \n(total capacity of which is approximately 21 km3). The major reservoirs are committed to multiple \nuses, chiefly irrigation and hydropower, and also serve as buffers against droughts such as \n2002. Abundant rainfall in 2002 necessitated emergency releases, flooding the lower reaches of \nthe Kur-Araz basin. \n2.  Surface water quality is extremely poor, in part owing to upstream industrial pollution. \nThe annual discharge of pollution from Georgia into the Kur-Araz basin averages 265 million \ncubic  meters.  The  Kur  and  Araz  also  carry  considerable  sediment  (estimated  at  60,000 \nmilligrams/liter at their confluence). Groundwater quality is generally adequate except in coastal \nareas where rising sea levels have increased the salinity of aquifers. \n2.  Utilization \n3.  Water withdrawals have grown by almost 25% since 1975, to around 16.5 km3 per year, \nsuggesting that  only  51%  of  available  resources  are  withdrawn  annually.  Abstraction  from \nsurface sources comprises around 90% of water withdrawals. Withdrawals are expected to rise \nby a further 25% in the foreseeable future. Agriculture accounts for 70% of water withdrawals, \nfollowed by industry (25%) and households (5%).  \n4.  Agriculture contributes approximately 20% of gross domestic product (GDP) and 41% of \nemployment. The command area of irrigation systems is around 1.45 million hectares (ha), 75% \nof which is gravity fed and the balance in pumped systems. Most irrigated land is in the Kur-\nAraz basin, which also contains regions with a shortfall in drainage infrastructure. As irrigation \nand drainage infrastructure has been inadequately maintained since independence, conveyance \nlosses are estimated at 50\u201370%. Substantial areas went out of cultivation as irrigation systems \ncollapsed; the cultivated area in 2001 was 900,000 ha, of which 80% was planted to wheat or \ncotton. In 1999\u20132001 collective and state farms were broken up into 815,000 farm families, not \nall of whom can take full advantage of existing canals and drains. \n5.  Industry contributes 33% to GDP and 7% to employment. Industrial use of water is \nmostly for electricity generation, cotton processing, and canning enterprises. Rivers provide \n91% of water used by industry; groundwater, 4%; and the Caspian Sea, 5%. Only 6% of \nindustrial water supply is drawn from on-site sources. Around 50% of households are served by \npiped water, principally in Baku and secondary cities. The quality of piped water supplied \nappears to be low.2 Water quality in secondary cities and rural areas is difficult to assess \nbecause testing facilities are inadequate. The source of supply in rural areas includes wells, \n___________________________ \n1  World Bank. 2003. Water Resources in Europe and Central Asia. Washington DC. \n2  World Bank. 2000. Azerbaijan Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Review and Strategy. Washington DC. ", " 24 Appendix 2 \nirrigation,  and  drainage  canals.  Baku\u2019s  recently  growing  population  has  overloaded  the \nsewerage system, with consequent leakages into the groundwater. \n6.  A high percentage of water resources is committed to multiple uses\u2014a potential source \nof conflict. Agriculture and hydropower have directly conflicting demands upon water resources. \nDaily interruptions in electricity supply and a shortage of spare parts hinder the operation of \npump systems (nearly 25% of the total). Pollution from industries and drainage from cropland \nworsen  water  quality  of  aquifers  and  wells.  Other  sectors\u2019  impact  has  eliminated  90%  of \nspawning grounds, while pollution threatens fish stocks. Shipping in inland waterways has \nvirtually ceased to exist. \n7.  Water-use  efficiency  in  all  sectors  is  low.  High  conveyance  losses  suggest  that \nagricultural water withdrawals per hectare could be reduced by rehabilitating infrastructure and \nmanagement. Industrial enterprises could reduce their water consumption by an estimated 30\u2013\n50% by reequipping and establishing sound management practices. Domestic water distribution \nsystems are rundown and water losses estimated at up to 50%. \nB.  Water Resource Management  \n8.  Azerbaijan  has  signed  numerous  international  agreements  concerning  water-related \nissues, in particular with Iran and Russia. However, joint management of international water \nresources has been complicated by the hostile relationship between Azerbaijan and Armenia. \nThese  neighboring  countries  have  established  contacts  with  each  other  via  Georgia  to \ncooperate on technical issues. \n1.  Legal Framework \n9.  Since independence, the country has started to address requirements for improved \nnational water management, which include ownership of infrastructure and concept of payment \nfor use of water resources. Water management institutions are required to implement a cost \nrecovery policy and empowered to deny supply to nonpaying customers. However, the legal and \nregulatory  framework  has  several  weaknesses,  including (i)  legislation  and  regulations  are \ndeveloped  ad  hoc;  (ii)  lacunae  exist,  for  example,  concerning  the  legal  responsibility  for \nmultipurpose dams; (iii) the legislative process is prone to influence from vested interests; (iv) \nmany laws, regulations, and acts do not ensure adequate transparency and remain vague and \nsubject to manipulation by officials; and (v) little of the legal and regulatory framework is widely \navailable to, and recognized by, the general public. \n2.  Institutional Responsibilities \n10.  A number of national institutions are involved in separate aspects of water resources \nmanagement. However, national formal procedures to plan and coordinate water resources \nmanagement are lacking\u2014a weakness the Government recognizes. \n11.  Irrigation  and  Drainage.  The  most  powerful water  management  body  is  the  State \nAmelioration and Irrigation Committee (SAIC), which manages the government-owned irrigation \nand drainage infrastructure and supervises almost all irrigation and flood control activities. An \nirrigation  system  department  (ISD),  subordinate  to  SAIC,  operates  in  each  district  and  is \nresponsible  for  water  delivery.  SAIC\u2019s  operations  are  extremely  centralized  and  its \norganizational structure is outdated. The average irrigation water service charge is equivalent to \n$0.60 per thousand cubic meters. However, charges cover only 10\u201315% of the cost of operation ", "  Appendix 2  25\n \nand  maintenance  (O&M).  SAIC  has  been  successful  in  fee  collection;  in  1998\u20132001  the \npercentage of paying customers rose substantially, from 25% to 73%. The principle of cost \nrecovery is not applied to flood control structures. \n12.  Domestic Water Supply. The management of domestic water supply is shared by \nseveral  organizations,  primarily  51  district  utility  for  water  and  sewerage  operations  and \nmaintenance operating outside of Baku, and the Apsheron Regional Water Company, which \nsupplies  water  to  greater  Baku.  Rural  communities  sometimes  supply  their  own  water  in \nconjunction with a local government. Water-pricing techniques used by the district utility for \nwater and sewerage operations and maintenance, introduce substantial distortions by not, for \nexample, adequately accounting for the cost of debt service, uncollected revenue, maintenance \nexpenditures,  or  depreciation.  Under  the  tariff  structure,  industrial  enterprises  subsidize \nhouseholds. Fee collection of water utilities is poor. \n13.  Hydropower Generation. Hydropower is managed under the auspices of Azenergo \n(under the Ministry of Fuel and Energy). Azenergo is responsible for O&M and capital repairs of \ninfrastructure on hydroelectric dams. The day-to-day management of Azenergo is centralized in \nthe same manner as SAIC. \n14.  Environmental Aspects. The Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources has regulatory \nresponsibility  for  numerous  aspects  of  water  management,  including  natural  resource \nmanagement, pollution and water quality monitoring, and hydrometeorology.  \n15.  Disaster Response. At the national level, response to disasters, including flood and \ndrought,  is  the  responsibility  of  the  ad  hoc  State  Commission  for  Emergency.  Similar \ncommissions are established within local governments when necessary. Revision of the system \nfor  crisis  management  has  begun  with  assistance  from  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme (UNDP). \n16.  Local Government. Local government plays a significant role in water management. \nThe heads of local governments are almost always consulted before the appointment of the \nhead of a local branch of a national institution. Local governments have formal authority over \nwater utilities. \n3.  Instruments and Resources for Management \n17.  Data collection and monitoring are fragmented and underfunded, with results rarely \nshared. Planning often proceeds as before, utilizing outdated standards and norms. Financial \ncontrol is often lax, accounting remains based upon old standards, and application of financial \ninstruments such as water charges is nascent. Institution leaders are often unsuited to the new \ndemands being placed upon them, and most lack managerial acumen and have a weak service \norientation. \n4.  Government Flood Mitigation Strategy and Targets \n18.  In upland areas spring, snowmelt, and rainfall cause hill torrents, some of which cause \nhighly destructive localized flash floods. The Government estimates the annual cost of such \ndamage at around $9 million. No comprehensive strategy for flood management exists. It would \nbenefit infrastructure, including transport and communications.  ", " 26 Appendix 2 \nC.  Support to the Water Sector \n19.  The  World  Bank  is  the  leading  agency  in  the  water  sector,  with  approved  loans \nequivalent to $131 million to irrigation and drainage, urban drinking water supply and sanitation \nand environmental protection, and $45 million more in the lending pipeline. Other multilateral \nagencies have financed infrastructure construction and rehabilitation. \n20.  The ADB is supporting the Government\u2019s State Program on Poverty Reduction and \nEconomic Development and has initiated the poverty reduction partnership process. ADB will \ndevelop  a  country  operational  strategy  emphasizing  (i)  integrated  and  sustainable  water \nresource  management,  including  enhancing  stakeholder  participation;  (ii)  improvement  of \nfinancial efficiency and sustainability of water sector institutions; and (iii) working with local \npeople to maintain the natural environment. Developing policies, institutional frameworks, and \ncapacities of central and local governments and communities to apply these principles will be \naccorded  a  high  priority.  Specifically,  ADB\u2019s  sector  operational  strategy  might  include  the \nfollowing elements: \n(i)  Promote a national focus on water sector reform. Support the creation and \neffective operation of a neutral apex organization to provide national leadership \nin water sector reforms, including policy and legislation. \n(ii)  Foster integrated management of water resources. Support the introduction \nof  management  on  the  basis  of  river  basins  or  main  hydraulic  units  as \nappropriate. \n(iii)  Foster water conservation and service delivery improvement. Rehabilitate \nirrigation and drainage infrastructure to return land to cultivation and raise rural \nincomes. Improve urban systems to reduce household and business expenditure \nand improve health. \n(iv)  Improve system efficiencies. As public sector service provision is inefficient \nand unsustainable, systems are deteriorating. Adopt market principles to pursue \nefficiencies, but temper them to ensure the rights of the poor to water. \n(v)  Promote regional cooperation. Coordinate closely with neighboring countries \nto protect Azerbaijan\u2019s regional water interests. \n(vi)  Improve governance. Establish viable public private sector partnerships based \non decentralized management in water service provision organizations. Study the \nrelationship between poverty and poor water management, not least so that \ninvestment impacts can be properly assessed. \n21.  Within this framework, future investments, to be confirmed and defined, will be governed \nby the need to (i) provide potable water and irrigation to the rural population; (ii) mitigate the \nimpacts of flash floods and hill torrent erosion, including protection of the upper reaches of \ntributary basins; (iii) provide assistance after natural disasters; (iv) provide controlled drainage of \narable  lands;  (v)  respond  to  local  water  management  priorities;  and  (vi)  help  mitigate \ngroundwater pollution.

The group\u2019s main \ntasks will be as follows: \n(i)  Help PMO coordinate all matters related to project implementation with relevant \nministries,  project  implementation  units  (PIUs),  design  institutes,  consultants \nhired under the associated technical assistance, local administration, ADB, and \nany other associated organization. \n(ii)  Provide SAIC, PMO, and PIU staff and domestic consultants with on-the-job \ntraining in ADB guidelines and procedures, efficient project management, and \nscheduling techniques. \n(iii)  Help  the  PMO  program  project  activities,  estimate  the  financial  needs,  and \nfacilitate the timely release of required funds in adequate amounts. \n(iv)  Help the PMO ensure that (a) all periodic reports are prepared systematically and \nsubmitted on time, and reflect the real picture of project implementation; (b) \nmajor issues relating to project implementation are brought to the attention of the \nconcerned parties; and (c) necessary remedial measures are implemented. \n2.  Environmental Assessment and Monitoring \n3.  The consultant will assess the environmental impacts of construction of flood protection \nstructures on cropping systems and agriculture uses, impact of backwater effect, change in river \nmorphology and flood regimes, physical impact on routine daily chores, and sustainability. The \nconsultants will also collect all data during the first 6 months of implementation for the baseline \nsurvey, which will serve as an indicator of the situation at the beginning of the Project. The \nconsultants will also evaluate the requirements for environmental monitoring and prepare a \nlong-term environmental monitoring program at key flood protection sites. \n4.  The consultant will help PMO staff prepare an environmental assessment report for each \nscheme,  providing  information  on  baseline  environment  condition,  and  key  engineering \nindicators that have environmental implications. The report will also identify potential adverse \nimpacts related to location, design, construction, and operation; and provide specific mitigation \n   ", "40  Appendix 10 \nmeasures and financial sources. A monitoring and enforcement program will be developed to \nensure that none of the schemes have any major adverse environmental impacts. If the result \nshows that the scheme under evaluation has significant adverse environmental impacts, the \nconsultant will help prepare an additional study or a full environmental impact assessment, \nwhich will be submitted to ADB for review and approval before scheme implementation. The \nconsultant will also help in public consultation through interviews, meetings, or surveys as part \nof  environmental  assessment  for  each  scheme.  The  results  of  public  consultation  will  be \ndocumented and reflected in an environmental assessment report. \n3.  Social and Poverty Assessment \n5.  The consultants will evaluate social issues for each project component and provide a \nframework to maximize social and poverty benefits and provide monitoring indicators for social \nand poverty impacts. The consultants will collect baseline information during the first 6 months  \nof implementation, and provide training for periodic collection of indicators. The consultants will \nconduct stakeholder analysis, devise a participation strategy, and help the Government design \nmechanisms  for  community  participation,  particularly  for  the  watershed  component  and \noperation and maintenance (O&M) of flood protection structures, including design of plans to \nraise public awareness. \n4.  Project Monitoring and Evaluation \n6.  The  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialists  will  regularly  update  the  implementation \nprogress, compare it with the schedules, and provide feedback to the management on lapses, if \nany. Particular attention will be given to participation of the vulnerable, poor, and women in \nproject activities. The specialists will also work very closely on preparing plans with various \ngroups involved in project implementation. The specialists will regularly update the concerned \ngroups on critical activities and inform the groups of the implications of delays.  \nC.  Afforestation  in  the  Pilot  Area  of  Kishchay  Watershed  (international,  3  person-\nmonths; domestic, 20 person-months) \n7.  The team will study the Kishchay watershed in detail, select the pilot area, and design an \nafforestation scheme (including nursery development) at the medium heights of the watershed \narea. The team will discuss the benefits of afforestation with local communities and mobilize \nthem to participate in the pilot project. The Project will promote social forestry, and mobilize \nlocal communities to take part in watershed protection activities in the first 2 years of the pilot \nproject.  The  lessons  from  the  pilot  project  can  be  used  to  guide  future  large-scale \nimplementation.  \nD.   Construction  of  Flood  Protection  Structures  (international,  20  person-months;  \ndomestic, 685 person-months) \n8.  The consultant\u2019s team will review the work done at the feasibility stage; arrange and \nsupervise further field surveys and investigations; and prepare detailed design, conditions of \ncontract, technical specifications, bills of quantities, and tender drawings for contract award. The \ndesign team will be based at the PMO in Baku and coordinate design work with the PIUs at \nSheki and Sharur. Design activities for various work components will be as follows: \n   ", "    Appendix 10  41 \n1.  Flood Management Activities \n9.  The works comprise design, award, and supervision of field surveys and investigations; \npreparation of detail design of flood protection structures; rehabilitation of flood forecasting and \nwarning system; and allied works: \n(i)  For  field  surveys  and  investigations,  prepare  specifications  and  tender \ndocuments, evaluate proposals, award contracts, and supervise the fieldwork. \n(ii)  Prepare detailed designs for selected flood protection structures, prepare tender \ndocuments, prequalify contractors, evaluate proposals received, award contracts, \nand supervise construction works. \n(iii)  Prepare a schedule for O&M of project flood protection facilities, and prepare an \noperations manual. \n2.

Promoting Transparency through Information Dissemination \n82.  The Project will promote transparency by disseminating information to the public. \n83.  Project Briefs. These provide information on project description, objective, source of \nfinancing, loan amount, terms of the loan, and the Executing Agency, and will be used to \ndisseminate information to the public. Briefs will also provide lists of services, equipment, and \nmaterials  to  be  procured  and  information  about  their  benefits.  Briefs  will  be  published  in \nnewspapers and posted in the project management office (PMO) and project implementing units \n(PIUs), which will also act as contact points for further information. The information will be \nupdated quarterly. \n84.  Stakeholder Workshops. Periodic national and local workshops/community meetings \nwill  also  be  used  to  disseminate  information.  The  workshops  will  be  used  to  gain  the \ncommitment and support of agencies, and gain political and bureaucratic support. Notices for \nsuch meetings will be published in national and local newspapers and posted at municipality \nbuildings, schools, and hospitals. \nB.  Implementing Best Practices \n85.  The Project will implement best practices on fiduciary controls, progress monitoring, \nfinancial management, and governance as described below. An elaborate program of project \nmanagement staff training and closer supervision will be emphasized. \n86.  Financial Management. To harmonize multilateral development banks\u2019 activities, the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  benefit  from  World  Bank  financial  management \nassessments.  The  World  Bank  has  two  ongoing  projects  in  Azerbaijan,  with  the  State \nAmelioration and Irrigation Committee (SAIC) as Executing Agency. \n87.  Executing Agency. The World Bank has assessed financial management, indicating \nthat SAIC is fully capable of meeting World Bank project accounting and reporting requirements. \n88.  External Audit. For the World Bank projects, SAIC agreed to submit, within 6 months of \nthe end of each fiscal year, audited financial statements in line with the international accounting \nstandards promulgated by the International Federation of Accountants. The EA has already \ncomplied with this covenant, no significant issues have arisen, and auditing arrangements and \nfindings were found to be satisfactory. The cost of the audit is being financed from project \nproceeds. \n89.  According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Report on Observance of Standards \nand Codes, lack of external audit is a major weakness in Azerbaijan. The August 1999 law \nestablished the Accounting Chamber to perform the function of external audit, but the provisions \nof the law are very weak. The accounting chamber is also too small to perform its required \ntasks. The report also states that the external audit of annual accounts is fundamental to assure \nthe integrity of fiscal data. \n90.  Learning from the World Bank\u2019s and IMF\u2019s experience, the Project proposes that the \nselection and appointment process for auditors be in line with Guidelines for the Financial \n   ", "44  Appendix 11 \nGovernance and Management of Investment Projects Finance by the Asian Development Bank.  \nGiven the weak structure of domestic audit firms, the Project proposes to recruit a foreign-\nassociated audit firm and has included audit costs in the project costs. \n91.  Management  Information  System.  The  PMO  will  use  a  multi-currency  and  multi-\nlanguage bookkeeping software for accounting and financial reporting. The software will have \nthe capacity to undertake (i) general accounting and reporting to the local authorities, and \n(ii) project  accounting  and  presenting  project  financial  statements  and  statements  of \nexpenditures to ADB. \n92.  Procurement. The World Bank has conducted a comprehensive review of procurement, \nincluding  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  institutional  capacity,  and  enforcement  regime. \nAssessments are summarized below: \n(i)  Azerbaijan has introduced the Public Procurement Law, based largely on the \nUnited Nations Commission for International Trade Law model. The law has set \nup a three-tier review system that consists of an internal administrative review by \nthe State Procurement Agency (SPA) and judicial review. \n(ii)  The courts\u2019 ability to deal with procurement disputes is poor, thus jeopardizing \nSPA\u2019s level of confidence and overall transparency in the review process. \n(iii)  SPA  has  been  vested  with  procurement  regulatory  functions  and  shown  its \nwillingness to ensure compliance with the Public Procurement Law. \n(iv)  SPA  has  competent  and  well-trained  staff.  The  country,  however,  lacks  a \nplanned training system for procurement. \n(v)  The World Bank has assessed Azerbaijan as a medium- to high-risk country from \nthe procurement perspective and stated that an increased level of supervision by \nstaff is required to mitigate the risk. \n93.  Learning from the World Bank\u2019s assessment, the Project will undertake the following to \nimprove financial management: \n(i)  In the project administration memorandum to be prepared at project inception, \ngive details of each component and steps for project implementation along with \nthe role and responsibilities of PMO and PIUs. \n(ii)  Prepare a training plan for PMO and PIU staff and update it annually. This \nprogram will include modules for training in ADB\u2019s disbursement, procurement, \nand financial management. \n(iii)  Use a multi-currency and multi-language bookkeeping software for accounting \nand financial reporting. \n94.  Progress Monitoring. Project implementation and progress monitoring will be combined \nwith project management staff training and conducted through an increased number of review \nmissions, which will include technical experts and other financial and thematic specialists as \nrequired. \n \n   ", "  Appendix 12  45 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR \nSUPPORTING RIVER BASIN AND FLOOD MANAGEMENT PLANNING \n \n \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will support capacity building of a river basin and flood \nmanagement  planning  cell,  which  will  be  created  in  the  State  Amelioration  and  Irrigation \nCommittee (SAIC)\u2014the institution responsible for developing and managing water resources\u2014\nwithin 1 month after loan effectivity. The cell will initially ensure basin-wide water resources \nplanning and management with community participation, water resources assessment, and \ndevelopment of strategic planning framework and national water policy. Particular emphasis will \nbe given to comprehensive flood management involving development of short- and long-term \nflood protection planning; promotion of nonstructural measures, including development of flood \nforecasting; and river-routing models and their use in reservoir operation, flood zoning, and \ncontingency planning for flood fighting. The international and domestic consultants provided \nunder the TA will help the cell conduct these tasks and, in the process, develop their capacity to \nundertake similar and other related tasks independently after TA completion. These additional \ntasks will include institutional streamlining, coordination with other ministries and international \nagencies, scrutiny of water resources projects, water allocation, environmental protection, social \nmeasures, and cost recovery. The cell could be a precursor of a neutral apex body mandated to \nmanage national water resources. The cell will report directly to the SAIC chair and be staffed \nby qualified and trained specialists from various units of SAIC. \nB.  Consultants \n2.  The TA will require a total of 12 person-months of international consultants, and 44 \nperson-months of domestic consultants. The following breakdown of consultancy requirements \nis indicative and subject to revision at the consultant selection stage, allowing one specialist to \noccupy more than one position. The proposed international consultants include (i) a team leader \nand  river  basin  planning  and  policy  development  specialist  (5  person-months),  (ii)  water \nresources institution and community development specialist (3 person-months), and (iii) flood \nmanagement specialist (4 person-months). Each international consultant may have more than \none period of input. The domestic consultancy input will be in the following positions: (i) deputy \nteam leader and water resources strategic planner (9 person-months), (ii) water policy specialist \n(4 person-months), (iii) water resources institutions specialist (5 person-months), (iv) economist \n(4 person-months), (v) flood forecasting and hydrological modeling specialist (5 person-months),  \n(vi)  watershed  management  specialist  (5  person-months),  (vii)  environmental  specialist  (3 \nperson-months), (viii) social analyst (3 person-months), (ix) public education and mass media \nspecialist (3 person-months), and (x) legal adviser (3 person-months). \n3.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  engage  qualified  firms  of  international \nconsultants  with  domestic  associates  to  provide  services  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of \nreference, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants, using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod. The consultants will work closely with cell staff, relevant agencies and institutions, \nconsultants of the Flood Mitigation Project, and international agencies associated with ongoing \nprojects, particularly the World Bank. \n   ", "46  Appendix 12 \n \nC.  Description of Tasks \n4.  The TA will undertake the following broad tasks. \n1.  River Basin Planning and Policy Development \n5.  The consultant, together with the cell staff, will carry out the following tasks: \n(vii)  Assess  water  resources  with  due  consideration  to  environmental  and  social \ndimensions. \n(viii)  Appraise  the  efficiency  of  water  use  by  various  sectors;  review  conflicting \ndemands  and  coordination,  and  conflict  resolution  mechanisms;  and  identify \nareas of improvement. \n(ix)  Assess  coordination  arrangements  with  other  countries  on  shared  water \nresources and recommend ways to improve such arrangements.  \n(x)  Develop a strategic framework for the water sector, including strengthening of \nnational water policies to meet envisioned development goals. \n2.  Water Resources Institutions and Community Development \n6.  The consultant together with the cell staff will carry out the following tasks: \n(i)  Review  existing  institutional  arrangements  governing  the  planning, \nimplementation,  management,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  water \nresources projects; and identify areas of improvement, with particular regard to \ndecentralization and community participation at all stages and levels. \n(ii)  Assess  human  resources  development  needs  to  prepare  staff  to  use  an \nintegrated  approach  to  water  resources  planning.  This  is  likely  to  include \nprovision of management skills and promotion of a service orientation, and also \nshifts of personnel evaluations to evidence-based competence assessments. \n(iii)  Recommend ways to promote community participation at all stages of project \npreparation,  implementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance;  and  effective \nmeans of waging information campaigns. \n(iv)  Develop  options  to  implement  cost  recovery  (including  its  phasing  and \ninstitutional arrangement for collection) involving efficient pricing of water for \ndifferent uses and contexts, effective regulation, and appropriate education and \nawareness, and with due regard to affordability and its negative impacts, if any. \n3.  Flood Management \n7.  The tasks include the following: \n(i)  Develop  plans  for  short-term  flood  protection  strategies  and  long-term  flood \nprevention options and for their effective implementation. \n   ", "  Appendix 12  47 \n(ii)  Review hydrologic models for flood forecasting, considering information available \nfrom existing and proposed meteorological stations, and select and operate a \nsuitable model to predict flows and river stages at critical places and guide \nreservoir operation. \n(iii)  Help implement flood zoning to reduce flood damage, and propose measures to \nmake flood zoning more effective. \n(iv)  Review  and  assess  contingency  plans  against  the  failure  of  major  items  of \ninfrastructure, including ensuring that rights, duties, and procedures are clearly \ndelineated, and effective coordination facilitated among institutions. This task will \nbe carried out in liaison with the State Commission for Emergency Situations. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n8.  SAIC will be the Executing Agency for the TA, which will be guided and monitored by the \nproject steering committee established under a TA1 and which will continue to guide project \nimplementation. SAIC will ensure that the cell is expeditiously established and staffed with \nqualified, experienced specialists. SAIC, Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, and other \nconcerned agencies will fully cooperate with and support the TA team to ensure that the tasks \nperformed conform to country conditions and environment, and that adequate capacity is built in \nthe cell to enable its staff to perform their tasks independently after TA completion.  \nE.  Implementation Schedule, Reports, and Documents \n9.  The TA will commence about October 2004 and be completed about September 2005. \nThe consultants will submit an inception report 1 month after the TA starts, a midterm report 6 \nmonths after, and a draft final report approximately 10 months after. The draft final report will \nconsist of a summary volume and separate volumes on each TA subject area. About 1 month \nafter submission, the draft final report will be the subject of a tripartite meeting to discuss all \nparties\u2019 comments. Agreed-on amendments will be incorporated into the final report, which will \nbe submitted within 1 month after the tripartite meeting. \nF.  Estimated Costs \n10.  The total TA cost is estimated at $635,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 equivalent will \nbe financed by the Japan Special Fund funded by the Government of Japan.

Introduction \n1.  The  Project  will  provide  flood  protection  measures  to  the  towns  of  Ganikh,  Sheki, \nGabala, Goychay, and Ismailly, and 43 villages, with a total population of about 215,250. Of the \n25 schemes, 22 are along the southern slopes of the greater Caucasus mountains in the north \nof  the  country,  which  is  drained  by  the  Ganikh  River  and,  subsequently,  Kur  River.  The \nremaining three schemes are on the Samur River along the border with Russia, on the Araz \nRiver in Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, and on the Astara River in the southeast. The total \narea protected from flooding will be 76,790 hectares (ha). The structural features will be a \ncombination  of  embankments  (about  30  kilometers  [km])  and  different  types  of  stone  and \nconcrete walling (about 23 km). \nB.  Approach to Economic Analysis \n2.  Project  economic  analysis  was  undertaken  using  techniques  to  measure  public \ninvestment efficiency. Economic costs and benefits were estimated using prices that reflect their \nreal value. Major traded goods have been valued at border prices, and local costs estimated \nusing financial data adjusted by the appropriate conversion factors.  \n3.  The  most  widely  applicable  conversion  factor  used  in  the  analysis  is  the  standard \nconversion factor (SCF), which represents the ratio of all prices in the domestic economy to \ntheir  international  comparators.  Using  the  weighted  average  of  import  and  export  tariffs, \nexcluding subsidies, the SCF has been calculated at 0.95. \n4.  The other important conversion factor is the shadow wage rate. Rural underemployment \nis  significant  and  salaried  employment  highly  seasonal.  Therefore,  the  opportunity  cost  of \nunskilled labor is considered to be lower than the market rate. The shadow wage rate is \nestimated at 75% of the market rate or AZM9,165/day. Skilled labor in rural areas has a higher \nmarket rate, and wage rates are much firmer due to the relative shortage of technical skills \noutside urban centers. For skilled labor the SCF of 0.95 has been applied. \n5.  The economic analysis is based upon constant 2003 prices and price relativities. The \nprofitability of the proposed investment has been measured by the economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) and net present values. The exchange rate used to determine border prices has \nbeen taken as AZM4,900 to $1. \n6.  The economic analysis is based upon the measurable benefits, which relate primarily to \nthe  annualized  cost  of  averted  flood  damages.  The  enhanced  development  possibilities \nresulting from greater protection levels have not been analyzed in detail, but the key elements \nand their order of magnitude may be deduced from the situation in adjacent but less vulnerable \nareas. First, agricultural productivity will markedly increase during the 5 years after project \ncompletion due to a shift from cereals to more intensive cash crops, in response to reduced \nproduction risks. The value of agricultural output may be expected to increase by at least 30% \nduring the first 5 years after project completion and to maintain this level during the project life. \nSecond, land will shift from agriculture to infrastructure, especially housing and small enterprise \ndevelopment. Unit area asset values for housing are more than 10 times those of agricultural \nland. A conservative expectation is the transfer of land use from agriculture to infrastructure at \n1.5% per annum during the project life. Finally, these developments will require an expansion of \n   ", "50  Appendix 13 \n \npublic sector services (water supply, power, roads, and telecommunications), which will further \nincrease unit area asset values. Taken together, these investments are estimated to result in \nunmeasured project benefits at least equal to those which have been measured. \n7.  The estimates of averted flood damage have been determined in a number of steps. \nFirst, the types of assets that have been and are likely to be damaged were divided into five \ncategories: crops, housing, infrastructure, other physical assets, and indirect damage. Potential \ndamage levels against flood design parameters for each of these categories were determined \nper  hectare  and  then  aggregated  to  give  a  composite  value  per  hectare  for  all  types  of \ndamages. Second, the per hectare value was multiplied by the estimated protected area to give \na total value of potential damage against flood design parameters for each scheme and for the \nProject as a whole. The third step was to calculate the average annual cost of damage, taking \ninto account flood frequency. Finally the aggregate annual cost of damage (benefits) was \nmatched against the economic costs and an EIRR obtained from the net benefit stream. The \nfollowing sections describe the above steps in more detail. \nC.  Project Economic Costs \n8.  Project economic costs were estimated in three steps. The basis of the calculation is the \nfinancial costs of each scheme phased during construction.  \n9.  The conversion of financial costs into economic costs has taken account of the following: \n(i) interest during construction and price contingencies were removed, (ii) taxes and duties \nexcluded, and (iii) local financial costs converted to economic costs by applying the relevant \nconversion factors to labor and material costs. The total project economic costs are estimated at \nAZM124.2 billion. \nD.  Project Benefits \n10.  The calculation of project benefits is based on estimates of the cost of flood damage to \nexisting assets that will be saved as a result of the Project. These include growing crops, \nhousing, roads/railways, and other infrastructure such as power lines and telecommunications. \nThe potential inundation area (where these assets are vulnerable) has been determined by field \nsurveys using topographic maps. \n11.  The  ADB  guidelines  on  economic  analysis  of  projects  recommend  12%  as  the \nopportunity cost of capital unless nonmeasurable benefits are significant. The Project has large \nnonmeasurable benefits that would justify the inclusion of a subproject at a marginally lower rate \nas long as the overall project EIRR remains well above the opportunity cost. The nature of the \nworks means that partial flood protection benefits will accrue during project implementation (4 \nyears). The economic life of all schemes is taken as 25 years although the physical life of \nproject works will comfortably exceed this timeframe, assuming adequate maintenance.  \nE.  Economic Prices of Inputs and Outputs \n12.  The valuation of measurable benefits is based on the use of border prices for inputs and \noutputs. International border prices for wheat and fertilizers have been estimated using World \nBank  Commodity  Prices  for  May  2003.  These  have  been  adjusted  for  transport, \npackaging/storage, and handling charges to give a farm-gate valuation. For other commodities, \nfinancial prices adjusted to the farm gate and by the SCF of 0.95 have been used. The derived \n   ", "  Appendix 13  51 \nfarm-gate  prices  of  agricultural  inputs  and  outputs  are  shown  in  Tables  5  and  6  of \nSupplementary Appendix H.  \n13.  Crop damages for each scheme were calculated based on crop budgets for the  crops \ngrown in a particular area. Budgets were prepared for all crops in each scheme. For each crop, \nthe revenue received and costs incurred were calculated during the period preceding each \nmonth of the growing season. The potential crop loss from floods for each month was then \ncalculated as potential revenue minus the costs that have been incurred up to the time of flood \noccurrence. The results for all crops were then aggregated and weighted according to the \ncropping pattern. The monthly totals were then weighted according to the probability of flood \noccurrence in that month using the flood frequency as the baseline. The weighted monthly \nvalues of crop damage were then summed to give a total value of potential crop losses per \nhectare. Tables showing these calculations are in Supplementary Appendix H. \n14.  Flood damage estimates for housing and infrastructure were calculated based upon the \nincidence  of  particular  infrastructure  in  each  scheme  and  the  cost  of  replacement  of  that \ninfrastructure. The Project will affect 44,350 houses. Replacement cost varies according to \nbuilding material used. Potential damage cost per hectare reflects housing density and type. \nInevitably, the range of values is wide, reflecting the incidence and size of settlement. The per \nhectare cost of potential damage to housing at the scheme level ranges from $100 to $7,400. \nObviously,  schemes  with  substantial  settlements  will  have  a  much  higher  cost  than  those \ninvolving rural villages. The average per unit area cost for the whole Project is about $4,200/ha. \n15.  A similar calculation has been undertaken for roads/railways. Within the project area \napproximately 726 km of asphalt roads, 1,222 km of gravel roads, and 11 km of railroads are \nvulnerable to flooding. Individual scheme costs range widely, with the main towns naturally \nhaving a much higher value than rural villages. The average cost across the Project is $396/ha. \n16.  Other direct costs of inundation include damage to irrigation and water supply networks, \npower  supplies,  telecommunications,  and  livestock.  Usable  data  on  these  items  are  not \navailable. A sample of schemes were surveyed, including those with the highest and lowest \nincidence of these assets. Actual damage incurred during the most recent flood was also taken \ninto account. This approach concluded that the potential cost of damage to these assets is \napproximately  10%  of  the  combined  cost  of  estimated  damage  to  crops,  housing,  and \nroads/railways. Accordingly, a factor of 10% has been added to these costs in each scheme. \nThis low estimate reflects the low incidence of such assets in some scheme areas and their low \nvulnerability to flood damage due to the nature of their construction. \n17.  Flooding is also associated with indirect costs relating to disruption caused to everyday \nactivities such as trading (local markets and small businesses) and the immediate costs of \nclearing and cleaning affected areas. In the absence of data, these indirect costs have been \nassessed at 5% of total direct damage for each scheme.  \n18.  These various estimates of potential flood damage costs per hectare are summarized in \nTable 12 of Supplementary Appendix H, and converted into an estimated total value of potential \nlosses against flood design parameters using the inundation areas for each scheme. The \nestimated aggregate potential losses against design parameters for the Project as a whole is \n$36 million. On the basis of the hydrological data, zero damage is equated to a flood period of \n2.33 years.  \n   ", "52  Appendix 13 \n \n19.  The estimate of potential total losses has been converted into expected average annual \ndamage in any given year for all levels of inundation. The proposed flood works provide full \nprotection against the design floods. Average annual damage (annualized benefits) are derived \nby plotting total damage against flood frequency. \n20.  These average annual damage or baseline benefits are expected to increase in real \nterms following project completion, after 4 years. Annual benefits are assumed to increase by \n3% per annum for 6 years until the 10th year of the Project. Thereafter, benefits are assumed to \nremain constant in real terms. This is a very conservative assumption, taking into account the \nexpected period of protection in most areas and the likelihood that growth opportunities will \nincrease substantially.  \nF.  Economic Feasibility \n21.  The economic feasibility of the individual schemes and of the Project as a whole has \nbeen determined on the basis of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and net present \nvalue using the discounted cost-and-benefit flows over a project life of 25 years. The base-case \nEIRRs for individual schemes range from 11.3% to 49.2%. Only six schemes out of 25 have an \nEIRR of less than 15% and only one has an EIRR of less than 12%. These schemes have been \nretained because (i) they are part of a cluster and their omission would be unfair, (ii) the shortfall \nin the EIRR is marginal and far outweighed by unmeasured benefits, and (iii) the schemes are \nsmall and the overall project EIRR remains extremely robust. The base-case EIRR for the \nProject as a whole is 20.3%. The project EIRR calculation is in Supplementary Appendix H. The \nProject will benefit the agriculture, household, and public sectors. \nG.  Sensitivity Analysis \n22.  The base-case results have been tested for their resilience against a number of risks, \nincluding  cost  overruns,  reduced  benefits,  and  delayed  implementation.  The  results  of \nconventional  sensitivity  analysis,  using  single-point  values,  for  the  whole  Project  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix H. \n23.  A 10% increase in total costs reduces the project EIRR to 18.2%. A 10.0% reduction in \nthe price of wheat reduces the EIRR to 19.4% and a similar reduction in total benefits reduces it \nto 18.0%. A combination of 10.0% increase in costs and 10.0% reduction in benefits reduces \nthe EIRR to 16.1%. A one-year delay in implementation reduces whole-project EIRR to 16.9%. \nThe EIRR is reduced to 12% when investment costs rise by 53% or benefits fall by 35%. The \nanalysis also looked further at the impact of implementation delay, quality of construction, and \ninadequate funding for maintenance. The quality of construction and inadequate operation and \nmaintenance funding was simulated by assuming that the Project would attract no benefits after \n20 years and after 15. A combination of one year delay in benefits and zero benefits after 20 \nyears reduces the project EIRR to 16.0%, and the same combination with zero benefits after 15 \nyears reduces the project EIRR to 13.6%. Thus, the project EIRR is resilient to the most likely \ncauses of lower-than-expected performance. \nH.  Distribution Analysis \n24.  Based on the economic and financial analysis, a distribution analysis was undertaken. \nAgriculture will benefit from avoided crop damage; households, from avoided property damage; \nand  the  public  sector,  from  avoided  damage  to  public  infrastructure.  During  construction, \nunskilled labor will benefit from jobs. Table A13 provides the results of the distribution analysis. \n   ", "  Appendix 13  53 \nTable A13 indicates that approximately 85% of project benefits accrue to households, farmers, \nand the private sector in the project area. Households capture about half the project benefits. In \ncontrast, project costs will be met from public sector spending. The distribution of project costs \nand benefits among project stakeholders suggests the need for a review of the cost recovery \npolicy on flood protection, particularly measures that increase cost recovery from those who \nbenefit the most from the Project. This aspect will be addressed under the associated TA \n(Appendix 12). The design and implementation of such policies must have a sound basis and be \ntransparent to the concerned communities. \nTable A13: Distribution Analysis \n(AZM million) \n \nBenefits and Cost/  Financial  Economic \nProject Stakeholder  NPV  NPV \n     \nBenefits:      \n Farmers (agriculture sector)   78,566  74,638 \n Households (private sector)   113,194  107,534 \n Public Sector   29,544  28,067 \n Labor   4,755  3,373 \nCosts:      \n Public Sector: project investment costs   106,266  97,137 \n Public Sector: O&M Costs   4,755  3,373 \n    NPV =  net present value, O&M = operation and maintenance. \n    Source:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n   ", "54  Appendix 14 \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis/Poverty Partnership Agreement \n \nOne of six key strategies of the Government\u2019s State Program on Poverty Reduction and Economic Development \n(2003\u20132005) is to improve infrastructure for the poor. Infrastructure has been identified as a national priority in the \ndraft poverty partnership agreement, which was discussed with the Government in May 2003 and will be finalized after \nconfirmation of the poverty reduction targets. \n \nThe Project covers 12 districts and will benefit 215,250 people (57% urban and 43% rural) in 5 towns and 43 villages. \nOf the total project area of 76,790 hectares (ha), about 43,515 ha or 57% involve settlements while remaining is the \nagricultural area. The Project will primarily reduce the vulnerability of the poor and enhance their security, particularly \nconsidering the lack of personal, crop, and livestock catastrophe insurance or reinsurance schemes. Floods could \nfurther lower living standards of the poor, negate any progress in reducing poverty, and cause the non-poor to fall into \npoverty. Physical infrastructure and nonstructural measures will protect lives; reduce damage to property, livelihood \nsources, and social services; and provide stability required for investments and economic growth.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Classification: Pro-Poor \n \nWhile project area residents have high (although deteriorating) degrees of access to housing, basic education, and \nprimary health services, high levels of unemployment and low wages result in widespread poverty. Based on the \nparticipatory rapid assessment and on interview surveys, 63% of the project area population is estimated to have \nincomes less than the absolute poverty threshold of AZM120,000 per capita per month (or $0.80 per person per day at \n2003 exchange rates); more than half the poor live in extreme poverty, with monthly per capita incomes below \nAZM72,000 (or $0.48 per person per day). A large proportion of the population is poor, and of the non-poor, 16% have \nincomes not exceeding 25% of the poverty line.  \n \nWhile the implementation of the government poverty reduction strategy is expected to reduce poverty in the long term, \nthe project area is highly vulnerable to floods. Particularly in the northwest, it has always been under the threat of \nfloods and sediments. Over the last 10 years, of the 40 most devastating floods, 25 occurred in the project area. \nEnvironmental risks from flooding constitute an important source of vulnerability.  \n \nThe Project is expected to generate significant job opportunities and income for beneficiaries. The Project is estimated \nto generate 359,000 person-days of unskilled labor, of which at least 300,000 are envisioned to be for the poor. The \nProject will increase disposable income by reducing costs for rehabilitating personal property from flood damage. The \nProject will protect 44,350 houses and an area of 76,790 ha. Most houses (82.3%) in the affected areas are made of \nlocal materials, and although restoration costs are lower than the value of cement block houses (AZM43.7 million vs. \nAZM58.0 million), the probability of damage with each flood is also higher for houses made from local materials. \nRestoration depletes household savings and assets. Aside from monetary expenditures, households have opportunity \ncosts from foregone economic and social activities during restoration of damaged property.  \n \nBased  on  the  economic  analysis,  the  estimated  average  avoided  annual  damage  to  personal  property  and \ninfrastructure is AZM23.60 billion ($4.83 million). Prevention of crop damage and loss of livestock are particularly \nbeneficial to the rural poor, who depend mainly on these for livelihood. Flood protection will also reduce damage to \nimportant social infrastructure and prevent disruptions to vital social services such as schools, clinics, and hospitals; \nutilities such as electricity; transport; and markets. The project area has 79 kindergartens, 114 schools, 29 clinics, and \n11 hospitals that are threatened by floods. Estimated avoided damage translates to an average of AZM85,000 per \ncapita per year to project beneficiaries, which is 16% of the average annual per capita income and 6% of the annual \nper capita poverty threshold. \n \nThe estimated income increases due to the Project will reduce poverty incidence from 63% to 57%. About 79% of the \npopulation who receive less than AZM150,000 per capita per month (approximately $1 per person per day at 2003 \nexchange rates) will gain from the Project. With incomes just $0.20 per person per day more than those officially \nclassified as poor, this segment of the population could easily become poor after a flood. With the Project, however, \nincome will be less vulnerable to the adverse effects of flooding; and income increases will secure revenue streams, \npreventing the non-poor from sliding to poverty.  \n \nOther potential project benefits include an expected increase in investments due to reduced risk of crop failure, which \nmay encourage increased cropping. More investments and efficient use of land would improve yields, diversify rural \nincome, and enhance household income. With the threat of crop failure due to flooding reduced, farmers will be \nencouraged to cultivate more profitable crops. Access to land has been important in protecting the rural population \n   ", "  Appendix 14  55 \nfrom poverty, but land use has been mainly for subsistence farming. The Project could also have other benefits such \nas possible industrial and infrastructure development because it will be protected, resulting in more jobs; higher urban \nand agricultural property values; enhanced environmental benefits from the watershed management component; and \nincreased participation from the community in management of reforested areas and maintenance of flood protection \nstructures. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nMeetings were held with local officials and other stakeholders to raise awareness and gain local support. Interviews \nand surveys were conducted among project beneficiaries to obtain their views and opinions for project design and \nimplementation. The participatory approach was initiated during project design and is an ongoing activity, which will be \nstrengthened further during project implementation. The interests of the poor, women, and vulnerable groups have \nbeen prioritized in participatory activities. Key areas for community participation are discussed below. \n \nCommunity Watershed Management. A pilot project for afforestation in the Kishchay watershed to control soil \nerosion is proposed as a project component. The implementing agency will be the Forestry Development Department \n(FDD) under the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources. The component will finance the cost of nursery \ndevelopment, planting, and partial cost of cultivation (staking, watering, weeding, and pruning). Watershed protection \nwill involve the community in planting and maintaining reforested areas.  \n \nFDD will develop a watershed management plan for 550 ha in Kishchay, involving nursery management and \nafforestation through community participation. Implementing the 275 ha afforestation requires 100 persons employed \n8 months a year (March to October) for 5 years rehabilitation will require 30 persons employed for the same duration. \nTo facilitate community participation, residents of Kish, the community closest to the watershed, will be trained and \nemployed in afforestation. Nursery management for sapling production should become more efficient, and eventually a \nprivate sector activity, with small nurseries developed closer to reforestation sites and run by the community. \nReforestation will involve men and women equally.  \n \nAfforestation will ensure employment of community residents and organization of the community to manage the \nwatershed. This will be done in three stages. First, residents will be trained in reforestation. Then FDD will conduct \nenvironmental awareness activities on the importance of watershed management in mitigating flood damage, and \nhighlight the value of community participation in ensuring sustainable development. Finally, FDD will organize \ncommunity  groups  and  build  their  capacity  to  maintain  reforested  areas.  The  community  groups  will  ensure \nrepresentation from all sectors, particularly the poor and women.  \n \nBuilding Community Capacity to Maintain Flood Protection Structures. Communities can be taught to manage \nflood protection structures. The participatory rapid assessment confirms that beneficiaries have an understanding of \nthe Project and its potential benefits to households and the community. Beneficiaries have signified willingness to \nparticipate in project activities by contributing unskilled labor for construction.  \n \nTo develop skills to operate and maintain flood protection structures, the State Amelioration and Irrigation Committee \n(SAIC), the Executing Agency, will ensure that contractors employ local people to develop their skills, which can be \napplied during operation and maintenance. Contractors will discuss hiring unskilled labor with local municipality \ngovernment officials and village leaders. SAIC, in close coordination with and support from local governments, will \nimplement an awareness program to build an environment conducive to forming a network of community groups to \nmaintain flood protection structures.  \n \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nThe participatory rapid assessment shows that women in the project area are equal to men in literacy, social image, \nhousehold prestige, access to resources, and management skills. Women are as visible as men in most occupations. \nAgriculture is the major economic activity in the project area, and women engage in most operations such as sowing, \nweeding, hoeing, harvesting, and storing crop produce. Backyard livestock raising, dairy production, and nursery and \norchard operations are dominated by women. During floods, women and men have equal roles in restoration. \n \nThe Project will give women more time for biomass collection, cooking, cleaning, child care, and crop and livestock \nraising. The watershed management component will give women the same opportunity as men to participate in, and \n   ", "56  Appendix 14 \n \nbe paid for, services provided. Of the 22,000 person-days for afforestation, 11,000 are envisioned for women. \nContractors will also employ women in administrative and other work required to build flood protection structures.  \n \nE.

The Project is estimated to generate 359,000 person-\ndays  of  unskilled  labor,  of  which  at  least  300,000  are \nenvisioned to be for poor residents. Women will be employed. \nIndirect job opportunities during construction as well as direct \nand indirect job benefits from operation and maintenance of \nflood  mitigation  structures,  and  implementation  of \nnonstructural measures are anticipated. \n \nIndigenous  None    No \nPeoples \nOther Risks/  Not Significant  Vulnerable persons (internally displaced persons, homeless,  No \nVulnerabilities  female-headed/single-parent  households,  orphans,  and \n  disabled persons) constitute only 3.5% of the project area \npopulation.

An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  study  was  conducted  under  the  project \npreparation technical assistance and the summary IEE is included in Supplementary Appendix \nE. This summary IEE describes the Project and baseline environmental conditions of the project \narea, analyzes the environmental benefits and potential adverse environmental impacts, and \noutlines recommended mitigation and monitoring measures. \n2.  As each scheme under the structural measures component will be designed during \nproject implementation, an environmental management plan (EMP) has been developed to \nguide  the  environmental  assessment  of  schemes  with  structural  measures  and  facilitate \ninstitutional arrangements and compliance with environmental requirements of Azerbaijan and \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB). The EMP specifies the type of schemes to be assessed; \nthe  procedure  of  environmental  assessment  to  be  carried  out  (including  responsibilities, \nprocedure  for  environmental  assessment,  and  environmental  criteria  of  scheme \nimplementation);  and  institutional  arrangement  and  monitoring  program  during  project \nimplementation. The EMP is provided in Supplementary Appendix F. \nB.  Description of the Project \n3.  The Project takes a comprehensive approach to flood control and prevention, including \nnonstructural (watershed management, flood forecasting and warning, and flood zoning) as well \nas  structural  interventions.  The  Project  has  four  components:  (i)  structural  measures, \n(ii) nonstructural  measures,  (iii)  disaster  preparedness,  and  (iv)  project  management  and \nmonitoring. \n4.  The Project will cover the four areas regularly devastated by floods from rivers and hill \ntorrents: Araz, greater Caucasus, Gusar, and Astara. Of 25 schemes, 22 are in the greater \nCaucasus  area,  and  1  each  in  Araz,  Gusar,  and  Astara.  Flood  protection  consists  of \nrehabilitation/construction of 30.0 kilometers (km) of embankment with stone pitching in 10.0 km \nreaches under direct threat of erosion on the Araz River, and stone pitching covering 4.2 km in \nthe Ganikh River. The structures proposed for hill torrents include 38 protection walls in 22 \nschemes with a total length of 23 km. The proposed measures will protect five major towns and \n43 villages, covering 76,790 hectares (ha) inhabited by 215,250 persons. The total project cost \nis estimated at $29.35 million. The Project is planned to start in early 2004 and be completed in \n2008. \nC.  Description of Environment \n1.  Physical and Ecological Resources \n5.  In the greater Caucasus area, hill torrents have gravelly sandy beds with slopes of 1:8 in \nthe western and central part, and 1:20 in the eastern side. The main rock groups are limestone, \nsand  stone,  clayey  shales,  and  clays.  Average  annual  rainfall  ranges  from  760  to  950 \nmillimeters (mm). In Araz, the arid climate is harsh, with very hot summers (up to 43 \u00b0C) and \nvery cold winters (down to\u201330\u00b0C). The average annual rainfall is about 220 mm. In Gusar, the \nwatershed area of the Samur River is of volcanic origin, and the soils are mountain meadow \nbrown. Temperatures range from \u201328\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C, with approximately equally distributed rainfall \nof 570 mm annually. In Astara, the rocks are of volcanic origin and the main types of soils are \n   ", "58  Appendix 15 \n \nmountain meadow, yellow, and meadow. The climate is subtropical. Temperatures range from  \n\u201313\u00b0C to 36\u00b0C. Average annual rainfall is 1,280 mm. \n6.  The wildlife resources in the project area are scarce. Vegetation cover, together with \nhuman disturbances, provides a few habitat variations in feed, shelter, and protection. Rare \nspecies, including snow leopard, brown bear, and Caucasus deer, are practically extinct.  \n2.  Socioeconomic Conditions and Quality of Life Values \n7.  Project  area  residents  earn  their  livelihood  mostly  from  agriculture  and  rain-fed \ncultivation. The main crops grown in this area are wheat and maize. A significant part of the \narable land is under orchards. The project area does not have any major industry, while some \nsmall-scale processing factories exist. Livestock production has been increasing rapidly since \nindependence and is now fundamental to the agro-pastoral system. Sheep, goats, cattle, and \nbuffalo constitute the main wealth of the rural population. Production of wool is substantial and \nmuch of it is exported. The poor in the project area are more protected than the urban poor. \nPublic health in five project areas is affected mainly by drinking water supplies. Public health \nfacilities,  including  sanitation,  are  generally  in  good  shape.  Water-borne  diseases  are  not \nprevalent in any of the four project areas, where people have access to basic school education. \nHowever, recreational facilities are very limited.  \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n8.  The proposed structures will be constructed along the rivers/hill torrents on government \nproperty  so  the  Project  will  not  be  engaged  in  land  acquisition.  No  scheme  will  be  in \nenvironmentally sensitive areas. Workers will be trained to follow environmental and safety \nregulations and to use the best available practice to minimize environmental impacts during \nconstruction  and  operation.  The  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  environment, \nparticularly terrestrial habitats, by improving flood control capacity, reducing flood damage, and \nimproving the local environment and institutional capacity for flood control.  \n1.  Araz  \n9.  The Project will construct a 30 km embankment with stone pitching in 10 km reaches on \nthe Araz River. Most of the Project comprises rehabilitation of existing embankment. Where no \nembankment exists, a new embankment will be constructed. The proposed embankment will \nprotect large agricultural and populated areas from flooding while still keeping enough velocity \nand waterway not to cause sediment deposition that will raise the riverbed and flood upstream \nand downstream areas. Embankment rehabilitation/construction will not obstruct the use of river \nwater or damage aquatic life. \n10.  Small-scale construction camps will be established at the sites. Attention will be paid to \nproper collection and disposal of waste, including establishment of waste disposal systems, and \nconstruction of temporary toilets with small treatment devices, and sanitary pit latrines. Solid \nwaste from construction sites, such as blocks and steel bars, will be recycled, and excavated \nsoil and stone will be used to level the ground or fill up the lowland. Soil erosion will be \ncontrolled by proper planning and staged construction to minimize exposing areas to rainfall for \nany length of time. A new embankment will be provided with reasonable fertile topsoil and \nplanted with vegetation cover. This area receives less rainfall than others, and erosion will be \neasier to manage. Planning, training, and quality control will ensure workers\u2019 health and safety, \nand minimize environmental problems such as noise, dust, waste oil, and grease. \n   ", "  Appendix 15  59 \n2.  Greater Caucasus Area \n11.  The hill torrents do not have water year-round and are not, therefore, used as a water \nsource for daily life. The project area has no wetlands or forests. The interventions will not \nobstruct the natural flow of water. The area has no aquatic life that should not be disturbed. \nFlood protection structures are designed to avoid backwater effect that may deposit sediments, \nraise  the  riverbed,  and  cause  floods  upstream.  The  works  are not expected  to  aggravate \nproblems downstream. \n12.  The Project will not involve any significant earthwork on sloping lands. Major earthwork \nconsists of excavation (about 4 meters deep) for the foundations of concrete walls, and the \nexcavation area will not be exposed to prolonged rainfall. Excavated material will be used for \nbackfilling so no surplus material will require disposal. Skilled and unskilled labor is available \nlocally for construction so large-scale construction camps need not be established. Attention will \nbe  paid  to  proper  collection  and  disposal  of  wastes,  however,  including  construction  of \ntemporary toilets with small treatment devices, and sanitary pit latrines. Planning, training, and \nquality control will ensure workers\u2019 health and safety, and minimize environmental problems \nsuch as noise, dust, waste oil, and grease.  \n3.  Gusar  \n13.  The  Samur  flows  along  the  border  with  Russia  and  is  a  perennial  stream.  The \ninterventions are upstream of Kirik village and existing flood protection structures and will not \nobstruct the use of river flows. Flood protection structures will avoid any backwater effect that \nmay deposit sediment, raise the riverbed, and cause floods upstream. The proposed works are \nnot expected to aggravate problems downstream. The project area has no wetlands. \n14.  Skilled and unskilled labor is available locally for construction so large-scale construction \ncamps need not be established. Attention will be paid to proper collection and disposal of \nwastes, however, including construction of temporary toilets with small treatment devices, and \nsanitary pit latrines. Planning, training, and quality control will ensure workers\u2019 health and safety, \nand minimize environmental problems such as noise, dust, waste oil, and grease. \n4.  Astara  \n15.  The proposed interventions are very near international boundaries. Barbed wire on the \nAzerbaijan side limits access to the Astara Hill Torrent.  Flood protection structures will avoid \nany backwater effect that may deposit sediment, raise the riverbed, and cause floods upstream. \nThe proposed works are not expected to aggravate problems downstream. The project area has \nno wetlands. \n16.  The flood protection structures will be constructed close to Astara town. Planning and \ncontrol measures will minimize noise (no construction during night) and dust (sprinkling water in \ndry season) during construction. Skilled and unskilled labor is available locally for construction \nso large-scale construction camps need not be established. Soil erosion will not be a problem \nas works will be minor. \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n17.  A project management office (PMO) will be established within the State Amelioration and \nIrrigation Committee to manage project activities on a daily basis. A monitoring and evaluation \n   ", "60  Appendix 15 \n \n(M&E) unit with three staff members will be established within the PMO. One responsibility of \nthe M&E unit will be to implement the environmental monitoring program, including monitoring of \neffects and compliance and checking of several key indicators to track environmental changes, \nincluding flooding regime, river hydrology, morphology, sedimentation, bank erosion/cutting, \nquality of river water, groundwater fluctuations, ecology, and value of life. The M&E unit will also \nmonitor dust, noise, and other construction waste during project implementation. The M&E \nprogram will start well in advance of detailed project design for each scheme and will extend 2 \nyears after project completion. \nF.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n18.  The project preparatory technical assistance consultants had a team of environmental \nand  community  development  specialists  who  liaised  closely  with  the  beneficiaries.  A \ncomprehensive questionnaire was developed and meetings were held in May and June 2003 to \nassess the views of project area residents. The solutions of earthen embankment and stone \npitching at various locations to check the river embankment were discussed, and the public in \ngeneral, satisfied with these solutions, was strongly in favor of the Project. \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n19.  The IEE screening process shows that the Project will not (i) require any resettlement, \n(ii) result in any unwarranted loss of natural ecosystems or any significant adverse impacts on \nenvironment, (ii) cause any additional hazards to endangered species, or (iv) increase the \naffluent-poor income gap. The Project will promote a sense of security among low-income \nproject  area  residents,  significantly  reduce  flood  damage,  and  improve  the  project  area \neconomy. \nH.  Conclusions \n20.  The IEE has shown that the Project will have minor adverse environmental impacts and \nhow  they  can  be  kept  at  acceptable  levels  by  implementing  mitigation  measures  and  the \nmonitoring program. Therefore, a full environmental impact assessment will not be required. \n \n \n   "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R274-03 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20031129161049Z", "Title": "R274-03", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 5.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20040301111126+08'00'"}, "author_page": "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 November 2003) \n \nCurrency Unit \u2013  Azerbaijan manat (AZM) \nAZM1.00 =  $0.000204 \n$1.00 =  AZM4,911 \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \nADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \nEA  \u2013  executing agency \nEIRR  \u2013  economic internal rate of return \nEMP  \u2013  environmental management plan \nFDD  \u2013  Forestry Development Department \nFFW  \u2013  flood forecasting and warning \nGDP  \u2013  gross domestic product  \nIEE  \u2013  initial environmental examination \nIMF  \u2013  International Monetary Fund \nISD  \u2013  irrigation systems department \nMENR  \u2013  Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources \nM&E  \u2013  monitoring and evaluation \nNMD  \u2013  National Meteorological Department \nO&M  \u2013  operation and maintenance \nPIU  \u2013  project implementation unit \nPMO  \u2013  project management office \nPPTA  \u2013  project preparatory technical assistance \nRBFMPC  \u2013  river basin and flood management planning cell \nSAIC  \u2013  state amelioration and irrigation committee \nSCF  \u2013  standard conversion factor \nSPA  \u2013  State Procurement Agency \nTA  \u2013  technical assistance \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \nThis report was prepared by a team consisting of A.
