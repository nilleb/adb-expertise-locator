The  urban  centers  have  major  deficiencies  in\ninfrastructure  and  delivery  of  services  in  subsectors  given\nhigh  priority  by  the  provincial  government  under  its\nProvincial  Spatial  Development  Framework  and  Strategy\nand  sector  investment  needs  program.  The  Project  also\naims  to  improve  the  capacity  of  local  governments  to\nprovide, operate, and maintain essential urban services in\nline with the Government's devolution program.\n\nUrban centers in the NWFP are experiencing rapid growth\nand  rising  demand  for  improved  urban  services.  Current\ndeficiencies  in  basic  infrastructure  are  inhibiting  human\ndevelopment  and  economic  growth,  and  severely\nconstraining  the  potential  for  urban  areas  to  play  a  more\nsignificant  role  in  economic  growth  of  the  province.  The\nGovernment\u2019s  proposed  devolution  policy  will  place  new\ndemands  on  local  governments  to  improve  financial  and\ninstitutional capacity and human resource management.\n\ntogether  with \n\nInvestment  Plan, \n\nto  be  developed \n\nNWFP's  Urban \nthe\nGovernment\u2019s  poverty  reduction  initiatives  and  greater\ndevolution of power and responsibility to local governments\nto  provide  and  finance  urban  infrastructure  and  municipal\nservices,  all  require  support.

Recently  the  Government  initiated  a  policy  of  devolution  of\nresponsibility for development to local governments and communities. The mobilization of local\nresources  and  improved  management  of  existing  urban  infrastructure  and  services  are\nparamount to achieving these objectives. To achieve this goal, the Government has requested\nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  in  developing  the  economic  potential  of  urban\ncenters in NWFP by improving existing infrastructure, and developing the required institutional\ncapacity of local governments. The Appraisal Mission1 was undertaken from 14\u201323 June 2000.\nThis  report  is  based  on  the  consultant\u2019s  reports  prepared  during  an  ADB-financed  technical\nassistance  (TA),2  and  the  Mission\u2019s  understandings  with  both  the  federal  and  provincial\ngovernments,  and  with  senior  town  officials  and  community  groups.  The  linkage  between  the\nproject objectives, inputs, and outputs are shown in the project framework in Appendix 1.\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\n1.\n\nTrends and Conditions\n\n3.\nPakistan\u2019s population, estimated at 135 million in 1999, is growing at about 2.3 percent\nper annum. The urban population of about 47 million, estimated to be growing at 5 percent per\nannum,  accounts  for  approximately  35  percent  of  the  total.  This  high  rate  of  urban  growth  is\nexpected to continue in the foreseeable future, in view of the country\u2019s relatively high birth rate,\nmigration  from  rural  areas  in  search  of  employment,  and  industrial  and  commercial  growth  in\nurban centers. By 2020, the urban population is expected to almost triple to around 115 million,\naccounting for about 50 percent of the total population. The annual national per capita income is\nabout $483. The 1998 United Nation Development Programme human development index ranks\nPakistan 138th among 174 countries and classifies it as a medium human development country.\nHowever,  this  ranking  is  lower  than  Pakistan's  rank  in  real  gross  domestic  product  per  capita,\nindicating  that  more  emphasis  should  be  placed  on  human  development.  The  infant  mortality\nrate is about 85 per 1,000 live births, and life expectancy is estimated at 63 years for men and\n62 years for women. Despite significant progress during relatively high economic growth in the\n1980s,  poverty  incidence  remains  high,  with  an  estimated  one  quarter  to  one  third  of  the\npopulation living below the poverty line.3\n\n                  \n\n1 The  Mission  comprised  W.  A.  Costin,  Sr.  Urban  Development  Specialist  and  Mission  Leader;  V.  S.  Rekha,\nCounsel;  and  S.  A.  Khan,  Sr.  Project  Implementation  Officer,  Pakistan  Resident  Mission.  The  Pakistan  Resident\nMission provided guidance and support to the Mission.\n\n2 TA  2940-PAK: North-West Frontier Province Urban Development Project,  for  $1.15  million,  approved  on  12\n\nDecember 1998.\n\n3 Poverty is defined in terms of deprivation of a minimum bundle of the basic necessities of human life such as food,\n\nbased on a consumption of 2,550 calories per day, clothing, and nonfood requirements.\n\n\f2\n\n4.\nHigh urban growth, combined with slow development of the urban sector, has resulted in\nuncontrolled  and  unplanned  development  of  the  cities  and  towns,  deteriorating  urban\nenvironment, and deficiencies in all forms of urban services, including water supply, sewerage,\nroads,  drainage,  and  solid  waste  management.  Lack  of  urban  planning,  land-use  control,  and\nconstruction regulations, coupled with limited skilled human resources and financial capacities,\nin almost all urban centers, has constrained the ability of governments to meet the overall needs\nof  urban communities. Many slums  have emerged in urban centers. NWFP is no exception to\nthis phenomena. NWFP, with a total population of around 17 million, and an urban population of\napproximately 3 million, has an annual population growth rate of some 3.5 percent. In 1993/94\npoverty  incidence  was  estimated  to  be  approximately  17.7  percent,  with  poverty  incidence  in\nurban  areas  accounting  for  around  15  percent.  By  2020,  the  urban  population  in  NWFP  is\nexpected to be 5.6 million. The current NWFP administrative boundary contains 7 divisions with\n24 districts and 46 classified urban centers; populations in each range from a few thousand to a\nmillion  in  the  capital  city  of  Peshawar.  Appendix  2  provides  a  list  of  the  urban  centers,  their\nadministration  classification,  population  and  growth  rate,  and  per  capita  incomes  as  of  1998.\nApproximately half the towns in the province have populations ranging from 25,000 to 100,000.\nAverage household size is 7.7 persons, with an average of 1.2 families per household.\n\n5.\nLevels of urban services within NWFP urban centers can be generally characterized as\nlow,  especially  in  comparison  with  many  other  South  Asian  countries.  Coverage  and  service\nlevels  vary  greatly  from  town  to  town.  While  most  of  the  towns  have  a  water  supply  system,\ncoverage  of  households  with  access  to  water  supply  ranges  from  25  to  83  percent  of  the\npopulation.  Due  to  lack  of  maintenance  and  poor  initial  construction,  water  losses  in  existing\npiped systems are in excess of 40 percent. Service levels in the sanitation sector are low; only\nfour  towns  in  the  province  have  piped  sewerage  systems.  However,  a  large  percentage  of\nhouseholds have individual sewage disposal systems, consisting mainly of pit latrines, and to a\nlesser extent, septic tanks. These systems are often in poor condition with overflows discharged\ninto open canals and drainage networks, and infiltrating the surrounding groundwater aquifers.\nDrainage  systems  in  the  towns  are  dependent  on  open  canals  serving  as  both  drainage  and\nsewage  collection  points.  Secondary  and  tertiary  drainage  systems  are  virtually  nonexistent.\nWhile  limited  solid  waste  collection  systems  exist  in  most  of  the  towns,  waste  is  commonly\ndisposed  of  in  open  fields  and  unsanitary  dump  sites.  While  urban  road  networks  are\nreasonably  extensive,  they  are  all  in  extremely  poor  condition  and  maintenance  is  totally\ninadequate.  Municipal  facilities  such  as  public  markets,  bus  shelters,  slaughterhouses,  and\ncommunity buildings are inadequate to meet the demands of the public. The existing standards\nand provision of urban infrastructure and services are generally insufficient to support sustained\nhuman development and economic growth in the urban centers.\n\n2. \n\nSector Institutions, Infrastructure, and Finance\n\na. \n\nUrban Sector Institutions\n\n6.\nResponsibility  for  urban  development  and  environmental  management  is  distributed\namong various government organizations: local authorities, urban councils, cantonment boards,\nand departments handling public health engineering, communication and works. Details on the\nsector  institutions  are  provided  in  Appendix  3.  The  NWFP  Local  Government  Ordinance  was\npromulgated  in  August  2001  and  as  many  of  the  functions  are  being  devolved  from  the\nprovincial  to  the  local  government  level,  a  number  of  government  organizations  are  being\nreorganized  and  renamed.  As  many  as  24  federal,  provincial,  and  local  government  agencies\nare involved in urban development in NWFP. As a result, some functions, such as undertaking\nurban  development  projects,  are  duplicated  by  several  agencies,  while  many  other  functions,\nsuch  as  urban  planning,  land-use  control,  construction  regulation,  and  operation  and\nmaintenance  (O&M)  of  completed  urban  facilities,  are  left  without  adequate  attention.  The\n\n\f3\n\ninstitutional framework through which urban areas are administered and developed is complex.\nFundamental  shortcomings  are  the  separation  of  the  budgeting  role  from  the  urban\ndevelopment planning role, and the absence of a clear framework for urban land-use planning.\nAs a result, towns have no form of development control. In the absence of medium-term plans\nand budgets, the discontinuity created by perpetual political change prevents the realization of\nany urban development strategy.\n\n7.\nTwo  main  ministerial  departments  are  largely  responsible  for  the  provincial  institutional\nframework. The Local Government, Elections, and Rural Development Department (LGERD) is\nresponsible  for  the  administration  of  local  councils.  Originally  exclusively  responsible  for  local\ngovernment administration, LCB has become increasingly involved in supporting local councils\nfor  planning,  finance,  and  infrastructure  engineering.  The  Physical  Planning  and  Housing\nDepartment (PPHD) is the main department responsible for land-use planning, and guiding and\ncontrolling  urban  growth  and  development.  The  Provincial  Urban  Development  Board  within\nPPHD  is  a  semiautonomous  body,  created  to  formulate  policies  on  urban  area  development.\nPart  of  its  powers  are  delegated  to  local  area  authorities,  through  the  establishment  of\ndevelopment  authorities  in  the  main  urban  centres  (Dera  Ismail  Khan,  Hazara,  Kohat,\nMalakand, Mardan, and Peshawar). A separate project management unit headed by a director\ngeneral was established under the Provincial Urban Development Board to implement the ADB-\nsupported Second Urban Development Project (SUDP).4 The unit is also the counterpart agency\nfor other urban development initiatives, in particular for the Community Infrastructure Project, an\ninfrastructure  upgrading  project  being  implemented  in  55  rural  and  urban  low-income\ncommunities  in  NWFP  and  funded  jointly  by  the  World  Bank,  Swiss  Agency  for  Development\nand Cooperation, and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).\n\n8.\nCentral  to  all  planning  at  the  provincial  level  is  the  Planning  and  Development\nDepartment  (PDD),  headed  by  the  additional  chief  secretary.  It  holds  overall  responsibility  for\nplanning  and  development  of  all  NWFP  sectors,  including  policy  and  procedures,  and  plays  a\nkey  role  by  coordinating  the  preparation  of  annual  budgets  of  the  Provincial  Annual\nDevelopment Programme. In this capacity, PDD reviews investment proposals for development\nfrom all line departments, and prepares recommendations to the NWFP government, as part of\nthe  plan  approval  procedure.  Most  issues  relevant  to  urban  infrastructure  fall  under  the\nresponsibility of the additional secretary holding the PPHD portfolio.\n\n9.\nLine departments are responsible for the delivery of major urban infrastructure projects.\nThe  Public  Health  Engineering  Department  is  mandated  to  plan  and  construct  water  and\nsewerage works in urban areas.  Once completed, water supply schemes are generally handed\nover  to  local  councils.  The  Communication  and  Works  Department  is  responsible  for  the\nconstruction, repair, and O&M of provincial roads (and associated roadside drains), bridges, and\ntunnels  in  the  province.  In  many  cases,  to  maintain  sections  of  the  national  highway  network,\nwork is contracted by the National Highway Authority. Urban (local) roads are the responsibility\nof  local  councils,  although  this  may  also  be  subcontracted  to  the  Communication  and  Works\nDepartment for practical purposes.\n\nUrban local government5 in Pakistan is presently through local councils administered by\n10.\nLCB.  Local  councils  currently  include  the  Peshawar  Municipal  Corporation,  29  municipal\n\n                  \n\n4  Loan 1004-PAK: Second Urban Development, for $66.0 million, approved on 14 December 1989.\n5 While the role and position of urban local government has changed due to the NWFP Local Government Ordinance\npromulgated in August 2001, with devolution of power to local governments, and the creation of district assemblies,\nthe  change  will  be  more  in  terms  of  political  form  and  financial  autonomy  than  in  administrative  powers  and\nfunction; laws, rules, and regulations will be amended as required.\n\n\f4\n\ncommittees (MCs),6 and 16 town committees. All towns under the proposed Project are classed\nas MCs. The MCs are grouped in categories, depending on the level of revenue, irrespective of\nthe population size. LCB allocates staffing levels according to category, not to population size.\nThe MCs are given a range of mandated functions. In addition to the provision of basic urban\nservices  and  infrastructure,  responsibilities  include  drawing  up  master  plans  and  site\ndevelopment  plans,  and  a  form  of  building  control.  The  MCs  generally  do  not  have  adequate\nnumbers  of  skilled  staff  or  local  revenue.  Typical  staff  in  an  MC,  depending  on  its  size  and\ncovering  administrative,  financial,  and  engineering  units,  comprise  an  administrator,  chief\nofficer,  various  levels  of  clerks,  accounts  officer,  accountant,  tax  officer,  collectors,  municipal\nengineer,  subengineer,  sanitary  inspector,  sanitary  supervisor,  and  a  number  of  sanitary\nworkers. Maintenance of urban infrastructure is given low priority. Urban populations have little\nconfidence in local government, and are reluctant to pay existing taxes and charges because of\npoor service delivery.\n\n11.\nPlanning  legislation  for  local  councils  is  included  in  the  NWFP  Local  Government\nOrdinance (1979), which mandates the preparation of master plans. However, under the NWFP\nUrban  Planning  Ordinance  (1978),  the  Provincial  Urban  Development  Board,  through  its  local\narea authorities, is delegated to prepare local area plans; this falls under a different provincial\ndepartment. Current legislation does not recognize the concept of structure plans as a means to\nprovide  a  medium-term  framework  for  urban  land-use  planning  that  is  immune  to  political\nchange.\n\n12.\nElections for local councils were suspended in 1996, and towns are administered by an\nadministrator appointed by the secretary, LGERD. The administrator is presently supported by\nofficers heading four main departments. The main departments relevant to urban services and\ninfrastructure  are \nfor  sanitation  (solid  waste\nmanagement,  drainage,  and  vaccination);  (ii)  Water  Supply  Department:  responsible  for  water\nsupply,  fire  fighting,  and  street  watering;  and  (iii)  Building  and  Works  Department:  responsible\nfor  roads,  general  municipal  works,  building  control,  gardens,  roadside  drains,  and  street\nlighting.\n\nthe  (i)  Health  Department:  responsible \n\nb.\n\nUrban Infrastructure\n\n13.\nCore  areas  of  most  urban  towns  suffer  from  inadequate  infrastructure  and  poorly\nmanaged  services.  Town  centers  often  lack  adequate  markets  and  other  community  facilities,\nand  the  number  of  low-income  households  living  in  slum  and  squatter  settlements  is  steadily\nincreasing. To meet growing pressures and demands, urban development has usually occurred\nwith little or no effective environmental controls and with forms of urban governance that do not\nmatch  the  responsibilities.  Little  attention  has  been  given  to  the  environmental  and  social\nimplications  of  such  rapid  urban  expansion,  including  availability  of  water  resources,  job\nopportunities,  human  hygiene,  social  integration,  and  personal  security  and  safety  of  the\nresidents.  Rapid  urban  expansion  without  effective  governance  means  that  in  virtually  every\nurban center a substantial proportion of the population is at risk from environmental, social, and\neconomic  threats.  A  survey  undertaken  by  the  TA  consultants  indicates  that  water  supply,\nsanitation, and solid waste are the major concerns of town communities; road improvement and\nstorm-water  drainage  are  also  highly  ranked.  While  37  percent  of  households  have  individual\nhouse connections to piped water systems, 2 percent rely on community standpipes, 37 percent\non wells, and 24 percent on other sources. Problems concerning water supply generally relate\nto  the  lack  of  distribution  systems  and  the  quality  and  intermittent  supply  of  water,  often\navailable  less  than  six  hours  per  day.  The  quality  of  drinking  water  is  often  low  due  to  aging\n\n                  \n\n6  Municipal  Committees  means  a  participating  Tehsil  Municipal  Administration  set  up  under  the  NWFP  Local\nGovernment  Ordinance,  2001,  including  any  successsor(s)  thereof,  functioning  at  the  local  government  level  of\nNWFP.\n\n\f5\n\ndistribution systems, lack of local treatment facilities, and contaminated water sources in some\nurban  centers.  Sanitation  facilities  are  generally  insufficient  with  40  percent  of  residents  either\nconnected  to  piped  sewerage  systems  or  dependent  on  individual  septic  tanks,  with  the\nremainder  using  pit  latrines,  bucket  latrines,  fields,  or  streams.  Wastes  from  septic  tanks  and\nlatrines  are  disposed  of  in  drains  and  open  areas,  creating  unhygienic  conditions  and\ncontaminating  the  shallow  water  aquifers.  The  lack  of  treatment  of  wastewater  and  its  direct\ndisposal  into  waterways  not  only  affects  groundwater  quality,  but  also  depletes  aquatic\nresources,  and  pollutes  surrounding  water  bodies.  Approximately  27  percent  of  solid  waste  is\nregularly  collected  by  municipal  authorities,  with  the  waste  being  disposed  of  in  open  areas,\nwithout any proper treatment and protective measures. The remaining solid waste is disposed of\nby residents along roads and in open spaces and nearby water courses. No waste classification\nsystem  exists,  and  hazardous  waste  is  mixed  with  domestic  waste.  Town  road  networks  are\ngenerally  adequate  but  their  condition,  width,  and  quality  of  maintenance  are  inadequate.\nDrainage problems are often associated with poor flow conditions due to inadequate drain sizes\nand \nis  common,  causing  health  hazards  and\nenvironmental  degradation.  Details  of  the  existing  infrastructure  and  services  in  the  urban\ncenters is given in Appendix 4.\n\ninsufficient  coverage.  Stagnant  water \n\nc. \n\nFinance\n\nThe  financial  capacity  of  local  government  is  at  an  early  stage  of  development.  The\n14.\naverage  revenue  of  the  MCs  in  NWFP  in  1998/99  was,  excluding  Peshawar,  PRs15  million\n($0.3  million),  with  revenue  ranging  from  PRs4  million  to  PRs52  million.  The  octroi  tax,  which\nwas abolished in 1999, was the principal source of revenue, accounting for between 30 and 50\npercent of MC revenue. Net revenue obtained from the octroi tax, a local tax, has been replaced\nwith a grant from the federal Government using revenue from the general sales tax. While this\nchange  has  been  revenue  neutral  for  individual  local  governments,  it  has  resulted  in\nsubstantially  different  rates  of  federal  Government  grants  to  local  governments,  ranging  from\nPRs30  to  PRs260  per  capita  in  a  sample  of  towns.  Hence,  the  level  of  the  federal  grant  has\nconsiderable influence on MC financial resources. While the federal Government has no plans\nto  reform  the  grant,  the  current  unequal  distribution  may  be  corrected,  so  relatively  greater\nassistance is provided to poorer localities. The grant could also be provided on a matching basis\nlocal  resource  mobilization.  Such\nto \ndevelopments would have a significant impact on individual local government income.\n\nlocally  derived  municipal \n\nto  encourage \n\nincome \n\n15. Water rates typically account for about 10 percent of municipal revenue. Cost recovery\nfor water supply is poor, with revenue being a little under half of O&M costs. Water tariffs are set\nby the NWFP government at a uniform rate for all towns, with the current monthly rate of PRs60\nper household set in 1995. Municipal collection efficiency for water charges is about 70 percent.\nThe NWFP Finance Department is currently proposing that the charge be increased to PRs85\nper household per month, which will restore most of the decline in the real value of the current\nrate that has occurred due to inflation.\n\n16.\nThe  immovable  property  tax  is  administered  by  the  NWFP  Excise  and  Taxation\nDepartment with the local town governments receiving 85 percent of the revenue collected. The\ntax  base  was  changed  in  1997  to  a  scaled  flat  rate  related  to  property  land  area;  this  should\nprovide  a  robust  tax  base.  However,  revenue  from  the  tax  falls  far  short  of  its  potential.  It\nprovides  an  average  of  about  5  percent  of  municipal  income,  but  varies  considerably  with  the\ncollection efficiency for individual towns ranging from almost zero to about 40 percent. Revenue\nfrom the combination of the grant from the federal Government, water sales, and the property\ntax  account  for  over  half  of  MC  income,  but  is  largely  beyond  their  control.  The  MCs  gain  the\nremainder of their income from a range of sources; the most significant are a tax on transactions\nat cattle sales, charges for the use of bus terminals, and rent for municipal properties. Few local\n\n\f6\n\ngovernments impose charges for solid waste collection. Weak institutional capacity of the local\ngovernments and the low willingness by the general public to pay for services, which they have\ntraditionally  expected  the  Government  to  provide  free  of  charge,  has  limited  resource\nmobilization by local governments.\n\nA little over half of MC expenditures are for staff. O&M expenditure is limited, and capital\n17.\nexpenditure accounts for only 12 percent of total municipal expenditure. Total investment by the\nMCs  and  town  committees  in  NWFP  during  1996/97  to  1998/99  averaged  PRs62  million  per\nannum (in 1999 prices), equal to PRs22 per capita per year.\n\n18.\nLocal governments need to increase the mobilization of finances if they are to undertake\nbasic  O&M  functions,  and  invest  in  infrastructure  and  human  resource  development.\nConsiderable  potential  exists  to  increase  local  government  revenue,  especially  from  the\nimmovable property tax and charges for water supply. However, increasing income from these\ntwo  sources  is  largely  dependent  on  the  provincial  government.  The  need  for  private  sector\nparticipation in urban development is being increasingly recognized. Many towns in NWFP have\nstarted  contracting  out  the  collection  of  water  tariffs  and  local  taxes  to  private  operators.  The\nscope of private sector participation can be expanded, in part by withdrawing local government\nfrom commercial property activities.\n\nThe  finance  function  of  local  governments  has  traditionally  had  a  relatively  low  profile,\n19.\nand  consequently  demand  has  been  low.  The  current  system  of  accounting  is  simple,  is\nundertaken  almost  exclusively  using  paper-based  systems,  and  has  the  limited  objective  of\nsecuring  the  stewardship  of  cash.  The  taxation  and  financial  management  functions  are\nadministered  through  separate  finance  and  taxation  departments  in  each  local  government.\nManagement  information  and  budgeting  are  undertaken  at  a  basic  level  only.  LGERD  obtains\nconsiderable  information  on  local  government  finance,  but  makes  little  use  of  it.  A  previous\nstudy7  proposed  that  a  more  comprehensive  accounting  system  based  on  double-entry\naccounting  principles  and  improved  budgeting  and  management  information  systems  be\nadopted. The proposal, which has not yet been implemented, remains appropriate. The NWFP\nFinance Department is currently reexamining the proposal, with a view to implementing it.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n1.\n\nFederal Programs and Strategies\n\nAlthough  progress  was  made  in  reducing  poverty  during  the  1970s  and  1980s,\n20.\napproximately 30 percent of the population still live in poverty and the incidence of poverty has\nbeen  increasing  over  the  past  decade.  The  Pakistan  Poverty  Alleviation  Fund,  established  in\n1997 to finance income-generating projects, microenterprises, and infrastructure projects at the\ncommunity level, mainly through nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and the private sector,\nhas  recently  commenced  its  lending  activities.  In  April  1999,  the  Government  released  a  draft\nfederal  poverty  strategy  with  the  major  objectives  to  (i)  provide  employment  opportunities;  (ii)\npromote sustainable economic growth; (iii) sustain growth using people friendly strategies that\npromote  labor  intensive  employment  and  provide  access  to  microfinance;  (iv)  expand  and\nimprove the quality of social services; (v) foster the development of community organizations to\ncreate social capital; (vi) focus on women as productive partners in development; (vii) mobilize\ngovernment  support  organizations,  especially  NGOs;  (viii)  create  safety  nets  for  the  poor;  and\n(ix)  support  the  evolution  of  an  integrated  approach  that  will  create  synergy  through  existing\ninterventions.  While  strategy  implementation  is  presently  uncertain  due  to  the  indefinite\npostponement of the 1999 Pakistan Development Forum, where the policy was to be presented,\nthe  National  Poverty  Alleviation  Program  with\nthe  Government \n\nlaunched \n\nrecently \n                  \n\n7 TA 1248-PAK: Urban Financial Management and Accounting, for $700,000, approved on 19 December 1989.\n\n\f7\n\nimplementation  commencing  in  March  2000.  The  program,  which  emphasizes  stimulating\nemployment opportunities and providing basic essential infrastructure and services to rural and\nlow income urban areas, is now ready to commence implementing projects based on approved\nselection  criteria  for  poverty-related  projects.  The  type  of  projects  that  can  be  considered  are\nidentified  under  various  subsectors,  with  those  relating  to  low-income  urban  communities\nconsisting  of  water  supply  systems,  sewerage  and  solid  waste  management,  drainage,\nprovision of civic facilities, and maintenance of existing infrastructure. Each individual project will\ngenerally  not  exceed  a  cost  of  $100,000  equivalent,  and  importance  will  be  given  to  involving\nvarious  communities  and  associated  organizations \nin  project  selection,  planning,  and\nimplementation.  A  first  tranche  of  PRs600  million  (approximately  $12  million)  was  released  to\nNWFP,  and  the  selection  and  approval  of  nominated  projects  is  ongoing.  The  distribution  of\nfunds will be based on 40 percent for farm to market roads, 10 percent each for water supply\nschemes  and  sanitation  projects,  10  percent  for  projects  specifically  involving  women,  and  30\npercent for other eligible sectors. In each district, 25 percent of the projects will be selected in\nmarginalized areas.\n\nTo  address  the  present  institutional  shortcomings,  particularly  the  delivery  of  basic\n21.\nservices and facilities to the general public, the Government recently announced a program to\ndevolve  power  and  responsibility  based  on  a  bottom-up  methodology,  that  is  people-centered\nand  customer  service-oriented.  The  devolution  program,  contained  in  the  Local  Government\nOrdinance and promulgated in August 2001, is having significant impacts on the present system\nof local government, both administratively and financially. The local government design is based\non five fundamentals: devolution of political power, decentralization of administrative authority,\ndeconcentration  of  management  functions,  diffusion  of  the  power-authority  nexus,  and\ndistribution of resources to the district level. The present civil service is being transformed from\nrulers  to  service  providers,  while  bringing  about  greater  levels  of  accountability.  Women  are\nassured one-third representation on all union councils. The current fiscal transfer system from\nthe  federal  to  the  provincial  government  is  not  subject  to  political  approval,  is  not  based  on  a\ntransparent  formula,  is  highly  discretionary,  and  does  not  involve  the  district  governments.\nUnder  the  new  Local  Government  Ordinance,  more  transparent,  predictable,  and  equitable\nformulas are being established to determine fiscal transfers and grants from the province to the\ndistrict  level.  At  the  same  time,  district  and  local  governments  will  be  encouraged  to  generate\ngreater financial resources from their own constituencies, and to be less dependent on grants\nfrom  federal  and  provincial  governments.  At  this  initial  stage,  the  district  administrations  have\nbeen  established  within  existing  line  departments,  however,  this  administration  system  is\nenvisaged  to  gradually  move  to  a  more  corporate  form  of  governance  driven  by  a  greater\nentrepreneurial  approach.  This  will  involve  introducing  a  customer-service  orientation,  results-\nbased management using achievement indicators, and staff performance evaluations based on\nmonitoring  by  committees.  In  the  long  term,  service  contracts  will  be  introduced  that  are\nrenewable on the basis of performance and visible results in the improvement of the quality of\nlife of the general public.\n\n22.\nIn  response  to  the  World  Conservation  Strategy  launched  in  1980,  in  1992  the  federal\nGovernment approved the National Conservation Strategy. Based on this strategy, in 1996 the\nNWFP cabinet approved the Sarhad Provincial Conservation Strategy. The strategy, developed\nusing  extensive  public  consultations,  sectoral  meetings,  and  thematic  workshops,  reflects\nprovincial aspirations for sustainable development and a commitment package containing major\npolicy statements, law reform initiatives, structural improvements, and new programs to achieve\nthe  strategy  objectives.  The  specific  objectives  are  to  (i)  address  the  fundamental  social\nproblems that are the underlying cause of environmental degradation; (ii) conserve, rehabilitate,\nand undertake sustainable development of natural resources; (iii) protect the living environment;\n(iv) develop high-quality environmental protection mechanisms including appropriate legislation,\ndevelopment  planning  mechanisms,  environmental  quality  standards,  and  participatory  and\n\n\f8\n\nregulatory  institutional  arrangements;  (v)  improve  the  institutional  and  financial  capacity  of  the\nNWFP  government  to  achieve  sustainable  development;  (vi)  protect  and  conserve  the  cultural\nheritage;  (vii)  increase  community  participation  in  environmental  management;  and  (viii)  raise\npublic  awareness  and  understanding  of  conservation  and  sustainable  development.  The\nstrategy defines priority areas for action, including (i) governance and capacity development; (ii)\npoverty  reduction  and  population;  (iii)  NGO,  communication  and  education;  (iv)  urban\nenvironment and sustainable cities; (v) sustainable industrial development; (vi) natural resource\nmanagement and biological diversity; and (vii) cultural heritage and sustainable tourism.  While\nimplementation of some of these initiatives has commenced, the full realization of the objectives\nmust  be  viewed  over  the  long  term.  The  strategy  provides  a  sound  basis  for  sustainable\ndevelopment in NWFP.\n\n23.\nThe Eighth Five-year Plan (1993/94-1997/98) identified poor quality management as one\nof  the  major  problems  of  the  social  sector,  and  recommended  enhancing  the  absorptive\ncapacity  of  the  system  through  effective  institutional  reforms.  The  plan  called  for  deliberate\nfocus  on  the  empowerment  of  communities  and  NGOs;  and  identified  poverty  reduction,\npromotion  of  good  governance,  and  environmental  protection  as  its  major  development\nobjectives.  With  limited  achievements  under  the  plan,  and  in  recognizing  the  need  for\ninstitutional  reform  and  improved  governance  at  the  provincial  and  local  governments,  the\nNWFP  government,  approved  on  4  September  1999  the  Action  Plan  for  Restructuring  and\nStrengthening  Local  Government.  In  general,  the  thrust  of  reforms  is  from  the  bottom-up.  The\nemphasis  on  improving  the  capacity  of  local  urban  councils  and  municipalities  is  intended  to\npercolate  up  through  the  system  and  influence  the  role  and  responsibilities  of  the  provincial\ngovernment. The plan identifies the need for changes in organizational culture. Recognizing the\nunacceptable  state  of  urban  services  within  towns,  and  with  the  objective  of  establishing  an\nenvironment in which the delivery of public services can be improved and sustained, the NWFP\ngovernment  recently  established  an  interdepartmental  working  group  to  assess  the  problems\nand  to  develop  recommendations  for  institutional  reforms.  In  line  with  the  recent  Government\ninitiative  to  undertake  greater  devolution  and  decentralization  of  responsibilities  to  the  local\ngovernments,  part  of  the  NWFP  government\u2019s  overall  restructuring  plan  is  to  improve\ngovernance,  including  restructuring  civil  administration,  consolidating  existing  administrative\narrangements,  identifying  surplus  staff  of  public  service  entities,  enhancing  tax  collection,  and\nincreasing  decentralization  and  devolution  of  administrative  and  financial  authority  and\nresponsibility to the provincial, district, and local levels. Cost recovery will be a main policy and\nstrategy  item,  and  incremental  user  tariffs  will  need  to  be  enforced  to  meet  the  entire\nexpenditure for effective O&M of completed projects.\n\n2.\n\nNWFP Urban Sector Framework and Investment Needs\n\na.\n\nSector Framework\n\n24.\nNWFP  developed  the  Provincial  Spatial  Development  Framework  and  Strategy  for\n2000/01-2019/20,  with  a  provincial  five-year  plan  (2000/01-2004/05).  Details  of  the  framework\nare  given  in  Appendix  5.  The  objectives  of  the  framework  and  strategy  identify  a  number  of\npolicy  issues  and  service  standards  that  form  the  overall  guiding  parameters  for  future  NWFP\nurban development initiatives. Under governance, the devolution of powers and responsibilities\nfor planning, implementation, and management of urban development to local government units\nis the overall objective. This will be supported by strengthening local governments to enhance\ntheir  capacity  to  carry  out  the  devolved  powers.  With  the  absence  of  any  real  development\nplanning tools, the development and implementation of urban structure plans will be undertaken\nto  guide  and  control  land  use,  and  provide  a  basis  for  development  and  building  control.  To\nensure  enforcement  of  the  plans,  and  to  provide  the  necessary  legal  basis  for  their\nimplementation,  the  structure  plan  will  be  codified  within  the  legislative  framework.  The\n\n\f9\n\napplication  of  appropriate,  affordable  (least  cost),  and  balanced  service  standards  will  be  the\nguiding principle when planning and delivering urban services. These standards will be applied\nin  the  process  of  investment  planning,  prioritizing,  and  budgeting  for  the  development  of\ninfrastructure facilities. To ensure sustainability of urban infrastructure facilities, and to meet the\npriorities  and  aspirations  of  the  urban  communities,  the  focus  will  be  on  participatory  planning\ntechniques involving community-based organization (CBOs). The sector strategy will emphasize\nreducing  existing  environmental  degradation  in  urban  towns  using  a  combination  of  physical\ninfrastructure interventions, improved planning, community awareness programs, and enhanced\nO&M  programs.  Strengthening  the  capacity  of  local  governments  to  raise  local  revenues,  to\ncover  at  least  the  full  cost  of  O&M  of  services,  will  be  fundamental  to  any  urban  investment\nprograms.\n\n25.\nUrban  centers  in  NWFP  vary  widely  in  the  quality  and  coverage  of  basic  urban\ninfrastructure  and  services.  The  government  has  formulated  targets  for  the  provision  of  these\nbasic needs, as a guide for planning and prioritizing investments in the urban centers. Given the\nwide  disparities  in  infrastructure  provision,  a  range  of  target  standards  has  been  defined,\nmarked by low and high levels of service, with these targets to be reached by 2010. In addition,\nperformance indicators were defined, as a basis for monitoring and evaluating project success.\n\n26.\nIn  the  project  towns,  from  25  to  83  percent  of  urban  household  currently  have  a  piped\nwater supply. Quality varies greatly with availability as low as 1-3 hours per day. Reducing the\nincidence  of  unaccounted  for  water  and  illegal  connection  is  a  focus  of  the  strategy.  The  low\ntarget for 2010 is to achieve 50 percent coverage of the urban population, while the high target\nis 75 percent. Performance indicators include reaching the low target for 2010: installing water\nmeters  in  50  percent  of  households,  improving  the  quality  of  service  by  adopting  key\nperformance  indicators  (water  quality,  pressure,  hours  of  service),  reducing  unaccounted  for\nwater losses, and increased available revenue to be spent on O&M.\n\nNone of the proposed project towns have piped sewerage. Although many towns have\n27.\nexpressed interest in full piped sewerage schemes with sewage treatment, such schemes are\nnot considered realistic at the current levels of municipal income and available skills.  Targets\naim  to  improve  the  coverage  of  proper  septic  tanks  (high:  75  percent,  low:  40  percent),  and\nimprove  septic  tanks  maintenance  by  introducing  a  septic  tank  maintenance  service.  Whether\nthis service will be operated by the MC or contracted out to a private operator will depend on the\nMC's capacity. Performance indicators specify achieving the 2010 low target: the existence of a\nfunctioning septic tank cleaning service, and evidence of the installation of a septic tank for new\nbuildings.\n\n28.\nThe  central  problem  of  the  degraded  living  environment  in  all  towns  is  related  to  the\ncondition  of  the  secondary  and  tertiary  drainage  systems,  which  invariably  carry  fecal  waste.\nTargets  for  drainage  improvement  are  difficult  to  express  in  quantitative  terms.  Rather,\nimprovements are aimed at routine cleaning and rehabilitation of the existing systems, including\nthe construction of road culverts. Performance indicators are formulated as an increase of real\nrevenue spent on drainage system maintenance.\n\n29.\nCoverage of domestic and commercial solid waste collection in the project towns ranges\nfrom  16  to  38  percent.  These  figures  do  not  indicate  the  adequacy  of  the  waste  disposal\nmethods. Targets are formulated as a percentage of population served (low: 40 percent, high:\n60 percent) and as a fraction of the market waste collected (low: 80 percent, high: 90 percent).\nPerformance  indicators  define  that  solid  waste  disposal  should  be  operated  by  the  private\nsector,  with  the  use  of  formal  disposal  sites  by  2005,  and  achievement  of  the  low  coverage\ntargets by 2010.\n\n\f10\n\n30.\nRoad  maintenance  in  urban  areas  has  been  inadequate  for  many  years.  The  MCs  are\nresponsible  for  most  roads  and  associated  roadside  drains  within  their  urban  areas,  with  the\nexception of provincial and national roads. The existing road conditions are quantified in terms\nof the investment (PRs per capita) required to reach a predefined high and low standard. Values\nrange from PRs400/capita to PRs2,000/capita to reach a low standard, and PRs1,300/capita to\nPRs5,000/capita  to  reach  a  high  standard  of  road  pavement.  Targets  are  expressed  as  a\npercentage  of  roads  in  urban  areas  paved  (low:  50  percent,  high:  90  percent).  Performance\nindicators  specify  achieving  the  2010  low  target:  increased  real  revenue  spent  on  road\nmaintenance, as well as traffic management issues addressed in local plans.\n\nb.\n\nSector Investment Needs\n\n31.\nSector investment needs are based on actions needed to redress seriously deteriorated\ninfrastructure  and  to  expand  infrastructure  to  service  expected  population  growth.  The  urban\npopulation is expected to increase from 3.0 million in 1998 to 3.8 million in 2005, with average\npopulation  growth  of  3.4  percent  per  annum.  An  investment  of  about  PRs4.8  billion  (in  1999\nprices)  is  needed  in  NWFP  during  2000/01-2004/5  for  remedial  work  on  existing  urban\ninfrastructure. A further PRs13.8 billion is needed to provide the desired level of service to the\nincreased  urban  population  by  2004/05.  Total  needed  investment  until  2004/05  is  therefore\nPRs18.6 billion, equal to an average of PRs3.1 billion per year (PRs835 per capita per year). If\nrecent  average  annual  investment  in  urban  infrastructure  by  the  local  and  provincial\ngovernments of about PRs0.4 billion continues, the financing gap will be PRs2.7 billion per year\nif  future  targets  are  to  be  achieved.  This  represents  an  ambitious  capital  investment  program\nthat  will  be  difficult  to  implement  in  its  entirety.  Accordingly,  desired  investment  projects  will\nneed to be prioritized to ensure that the maximum benefit is obtained from the available finance;\nand  an  acceptance  that  the  desired  targets  will  be  difficult  to  achieve.  Details  of  the  sector\ninvestment needs are shown in Appendix 6.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n32.\nADB  has  been  involved  in  the  urban  sector  in  NWFP  since  1989  with  one  loan  ($66.0\nmillion) and three TAs ($2.2 million). The loan,8 the SUDP, which was closed on 31 December\n1999,  included  road  construction,  sewerage  treatment  plants,  water  supply,  drainage,  slum\nupgrading,  and  solid  waste  management  in  seven  provincial  towns.  The  TAs  provided\nassistance  with  urban  finance  and  management,  and  feasibility  studies  for  priority  investment\ncomponents  in  selected  towns,  with  policy  recommendations  for  institutional  restructuring  and\nfinancial  management.  Another  major  external  assistance  to  the  urban  sector  in  NWFP  is  the\nCommunity  Infrastructure  Project,  for  the  provision  of  infrastructure  upgrading  for  55  rural  and\nurban  low-income  communities.  The  project  commenced  in  1994,  and  was  financed  by  the\nWorld  Bank,  the  United  Nation\u2019s  Children  Fund,  and  Swiss  Agency  for  Development\nCooperation. Details on external assistance to the urban sector in Pakistan is given in Appendix\n7.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n33.\nPortfolio  performance  has  been  constrained  by  a  number  of  generic  macro  and  micro\nissues,  including  (i)  legal  and  administrative  issues  relating  to  processing  procedures  and\nrequirements,  (ii)  coordination  difficulties  and  procedural  issues,  (iii)  technical  and  project\nmanagement issues, and (iv) counterpart funding constraints and timely release. These issues\nresult  in  implementation  delays,  with  often  negative  financial  and  economic  consequences.  In\naddition,  noncompliance  with  specific  covenants,  delay  in  consultant  recruitment,  minimal\nbeneficiary participation, poor O&M of completed facilities, low financial and economic rates of\n\n8   Loan 1004-PAK(SF), Second Urban Development Project, for $66.0 million, approved on 19 December 1989.\n\n                  \n\n\f11\n\nreturn, and frequent changing of senior project management staff diminishes accountability and\ntransparency, and undermines project sustainability.\n\nAn important lesson derived from the Karachi Urban Development Project9 is that urban\n34.\nupgrading  is  complex,  and  a  piecemeal  approach  involving  a  few  selected  problems  is  not  an\noptimal solution. Urban upgrading should be designed from a plan that integrates all aspects of\nurban infrastructure, and involves the participation of the ultimate beneficiaries. The institutional\ncapacity to implement the project must be present, and the financial framework must be in place\nto  ensure  long-term  sustainability  of  the  upgrading.  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  audit  report\nconcluded  that  the  Karachi  Urban  Development  Project  was  unsuccessful,  with  the  main\nidentified  weakness  being  in  the  design.  Appendix  8  provides  details  of  lessons  learned  from\nprevious projects in the sector.\n\nto  select  participating \n\nThe design of the proposed Project takes this experience into account, in particular to (i)\n35.\nimplement  subprojects  at  the  local  level  to  develop  greater  ownership;  (ii)  use  a  competitive\nenvironment \n(iii)  support  subproject\nimplementation  and  sustainability  by  obtaining  financial  contributions  from  participating  towns,\nand  enhancing  the  collection  of  taxes  and  fees  from  project  beneficiaries;  and  (iv)  develop  a\nmonitoring  system  to  ensure  effective  implementation  and  accrual  of  benefits  to  the  target\ngroups.\n\ntowns  and  subprojects; \n\nE.\n\nADB's Sector Strategy\n\n36.\nADB's  operational  strategy  for  Pakistan  supports  human  resource  development  and\nsocial  infrastructure  requirements,  as  well  as  programs  to  respond  to  the  policy  environment,\nincluding  increased  priority  for  macroeconomic  management  and  support  for  economic\nstabilization and restructuring. With ADB\u2019s emphasis on poverty reduction, and the challenge to\ndeliver  basic  services  to  the  people,  resources  must  be  effectively  used,  especially  to  reduce\npoverty  in  an  environment  of  effective  economic  management,  good  governance,  and  strong\npolicy  commitment.  The  main  focus  of  ADB  assistance  to  the  urban  sector  will  be  on\nenvironmental  aspects  and  the  needs  of  the  poor,  and  will  broadly  cover  (i)  institutional\nrestructuring  emphasizing  eliminating  overlapping  functional  responsibilities,  professionalizing\nurban  management,  developing  staffing  policies,  and  devolving  service  delivery;  (ii)  private\nsector  involvement  in  the  delivery  of  selected  urban  services;  (iii)  budgeting  and  finance,  and\nincreased  cost  recovery  and  municipal  revenue;  and  (iv)  increased  community  participation.\nCapacity  building  efforts  will  be  pursued  for  institutional  strengthening  of  provincial  and\nimplementation\nmunicipal  urban  management  and  operations, \ncapabilities, \nIdentified  strategic\nconsiderations  for  the  urban  sector  include  (i)  establishing  service  levels,  affordability,  and\nbeneficiaries'  willingness  to  pay;  (ii)  implementing  cost  recovery;  (iii)  minimizing  environmental\nimpacts;  (iv)  targeting  low-income  groups;  (v)  integrating  health  service  provision;  and  (vi)\nsupporting community participation.\n\nfinancial  management,  and  environment  management. \n\nincluding  planning  and \n\n37.\nThe  demand-oriented  planning  approach  is  considered  best  practice,  and  requires\ninvolving  beneficiaries  in  design,  technology  choice,  implementation,  and  operations;  and\nallowing  flexibility  in  project  design  and  service  levels.  This  project  participatory  design\nmethodology  is  central  to  ADB's  sector  development  strategy.  While  in  urban  areas  sector\ninterventions  are  tied  to  measures  to  conserve  environmental  resources,  public  sector\nmanagement capacity and accountability remain major constraints to satisfactory social sector\ndevelopment.  Improving  existing  service  delivery  mechanisms  is  essential  to  achieving\nsustainability and will be used to encourage private sector participation and NGO involvement.\n\n9 Loan 793-PAK(SF): Karachi Urban Development, for $55.20 million, approved on 14 October 1986.\n\n                  \n\n\f12\n\nPublic sector management requires decentralizing decision-making authority, policy reforms for\nlocal revenue generation capacity, and cost recovery for urban services.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nSince commencement of its assistance to the urban sector in the mid-1980s, ADB has\n38.\ncontinuously  discussed  issues  and  policies  in  the  sector  with  the  Government,  particularly  (i)\nimproving governance; (ii) enhancing service delivery; (iii) ensuring financial and administrative\nautonomy  for  urban  service  providers;  (iv)  implementing  cost  recovery  and  sound  financial\nmanagement;  (v)  institutionalizing  community  participation;  and  (vi)  providing  greater  equity  in\nthe  delivery  of  municipal  services,  particularly  for  the  low  income  and  disadvantaged  groups\nwithin  the  community.  ADB  has  noted  with  concern  the  lack  of  progress  made  in  the  NWFP\nurban  sector  to  strengthen  the  planning,  management,  and  financing  capacity  of  local\ngovernments. The Urban Sector Policy Action Plan outlines a clear set of objectives and tasks\nfor NFWP over the next five years to improve governance, financial strengthening, and resource\nmobilization, O&M, rehabilitation capability, and environmental protection. These objectives fully\ncomplement the Government\u2019s devolution initiatives.\n\n39.\nIn  view  of  the  current  limited  capacity  of  local  government  for  forward  planning  and\nraising  financial  resources,  ADB's  investment  in  the  sector  will  be  (i)  strictly  limited  to  high-\npriority  basic  needs  of  the  urban  poor,  (ii)  linked  with  capacity  building  programs  for  urban\nfinancial  management  and  urban  development  planning,  and  (iii)  simultaneous  with  programs\naimed  to  strengthen  the  municipal  capacity  for  community  participation.  ADB  recognizes  the\noverriding importance of continuous training and education, taking into account the basic levels\nof  skills  and  awareness  in  small  urban  communities  in  NWFP.  The  federal  Government  has\ndeveloped new initiatives to devolve power and responsibility to local governments, and reduce\npoverty.  Given  this  background,  the  urban  policy  for  NWFP  is  formulated  to  support  the\nGovernment\u2019s devolution and poverty reduction initiatives.\n\n1.\n\nDecentralization and Devolution\n\n40.\nThe  Government\u2019s  policy  of  decentralization  and  devolution  is  critical  to  developing  a\ngreater local responsibility. Unless greater accountability at the local level can be developed and\nmanagement  improved,  efficient  and  cost-effective  services  to  the  community  cannot  be\nachieved.  The  mobilization  of  local  resources  and  improved  management  of  existing\ninfrastructure and services are paramount to achieving these objectives.\n\n41.\nThe federal Government has agreed that the Project will support these objectives by (i)\nstrengthening the managerial, financial, and technical capacity of the MCs by giving them more\nresponsibility,  and  upgrading  the  capability  and  capacity  of  their  staff;  (ii)  providing  adequate\nstaff,  equipment,  and  procedures  to  enable  the  MCs  to  increase  resource  mobilization,\nsuccessfully implement and sustain subprojects, and improve the management and delivery of\nexisting urban infrastructure and services; and (iii) providing a training program for the MCs and\nprovincial staff to develop their technical proficiency. The Government has made a commitment\nto  aim  at  greater  continuity  in  the  appointment  of  key  professional  and  administrative  staff  in\nlocal councils.\n\n2.\n\nThe Urban Poor\n\n42.\nThe  Government  is  committed  to  providing  support  for  low-income  groups,  and\nresponding to their needs in prioritizing development programs and evaluating the performance\nof  urban  services  that  will  affect  them.  ADB  has  encouraged  the  urban  poor  to  participate  in\nthese processes to ensure the effective implementation of projects that meet user needs, and to\nenhance  equity  and  sustainability  in  urban  service  provision.  ADB  has  also  encouraged  the\n\n\f13\n\nGovernment to ensure that the benefits of activities intended to support the poor are delivered to\ntarget  beneficiaries.  The  Project,  through  it\u2019s  basic  human  needs  approach,  with  emphasis  on\nproviding improved services to lower income groups within the urban community, is designed to\nsupport these objectives.\n\n3.\n\nUrban Planning and Development Control\n\n43.\nADB recognizes that the absence of a clear legal and institutional framework for urban\nland-use  planning  and  development  control  is  a  crucial  deficiency  when  improving  urban\nmanagement.  The  concept  of  structure  plans  as  a  guide  for  medium-term  planning  is  (i)  not\npresent in current legislation, and (ii) little known as a professional planning tool for urban sector\nstaff.  Revision  of  the  legislative  and  institutional  framework  to  allow  for  an  improved  basis  of\nplanning will require broad discussion and agreement at federal and provincial levels, and can\ntherefore not be achieved in the short term. ADB will therefore continue to support government\nin its aims to make practical improvement at the local level, by introducing the concepts of urban\nplanning  to  urban  government  staff  as  part  of  its  capacity  building  program.  Simultaneously,\nADB  will  continue  its  involvement  in  the  longer-term  review  of  the  legislative  and  institutional\nframework of NWFP's urban sector. Under the Project, each participating town will be required\nto have an up-to-date base map, with the outline of an urban structure plan as a guide for future\ndevelopment.  The  Project  will  provide  support  for  the  development  of  structure  plans  that  will\nultimately form the basis for improved municipal management and enhanced implementation of\nthe immovable property tax system.\n\n4.\n\nCommunication between Local Government and Communities\n\nBoth ADB and the Government recognize the current reluctance of the urban population\n44.\nto contribute to urban services through taxes or charges, largely because they lack confidence\nin local government to deliver any form of services to the benefit of the population. The drive to\nraising more local revenues by collecting taxes and charges can only succeed if government is\nseen to improve the quality of its services.  This will require improved communication between\ncivic society and local government, as well as an improved understanding by local government\nstaff  on  their  responsibility  to  provide  service  to  the  urban  population.  The  Project  will\nemphasize developing forms and mechanisms for community participation that are appropriate\nto  the  sociocultural  and  political  environment  of  urban  communities.  The  development  of\nsustainable  partnerships  between  community  groups  and  local  government  will  be  a  key\nobjective of the Project to develop effective and lasting channels of communication.\n\n5.\n\nMunicipal Capacity for Community Participation\n\n45.\nADB  is  committed  to  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  increase  participatory\nplanning in urban management and development. To achieve this in government structures with\nlittle direct exposure to such techniques, ADB recognizes the need to understand the problems\nthat local government will experience in planning and implementing participatory processes, the\noptions  for  resolution,  and  the  nature  and  extent  of  capacity  building  required.  In  program\npreparation,  three  primary  areas  will  be  identified  where  a  better  understanding  as  well  as\nimmediate  action  is  required:  (i)  the  nature  of  participation  and  partnerships  with  poor\ncommunities,  (ii)  the  mechanisms  for  establishing  community  participation,  and  (iii)  the\ninstitutional change necessary to integrate participatory processes with current operations.\n\n\f14\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n46.\nUrban  areas  in  NWFP  are  experiencing  rapid  growth,  and  demand  for  improved  urban\nservice is increasing. Current deficiencies in basic infrastructure are inhibiting economic growth,\nand  severely  constraining  the  potential  for  urban  areas  to  play  a  more  significant  role  in\nNWFP\u2019S economic growth. To meet the growing pressures and demands, urban development\nhas usually occurred with little or no environmental controls and with forms of governance that\ncannot begin to meet the responsibilities. High urban growth combined with slow urban sector\ndevelopment has resulted in uncontrolled urban sprawl; deteriorating urban environments; and\ndeficiencies in all forms of urban services, including water supply, sewerage systems, drainage,\nsolid  waste  management,  roads,  and  community  facilities.  Lack  of  urban  planning,  land-use\ncontrol,  and  construction  regulations  in  almost  all  urban  centers  in  NWFP  has  resulted  in\nunplanned, ad hoc town developments, with the emergence of many slum areas.\n\nAlthough  on  average  39  percent  of  NFWP\u2019S  urban  population  have  access  to  piped\n47.\nwater supply, the quality of drinking water is often low due to the aging distribution system, lack\nof  local  treatment  facilities,  and  contaminated  water  sources  in  some  urban  centers.  System\nlosses are high and supply irregular, often providing for less than six hours per day. Sewerage\nsystems  and  drainage  networks  are  totally  insufficient  in  most  towns,  particularly  in  the  low-\nincome  settlements,  where  localized  flooding  causes  unhygienic  conditions  and  seriously\nimpacts  on  the  living  conditions  of  the  residents.  In  most  urban  towns,  clinical,  industrial,  and\ncommercial  sewage  is  discharged  into  open  drains  and  canals  without  treatment.  Wastewater\nfrom leaking sewers, unlined drainage canals, septic tanks, and open ponds percolates into the\nsoil  and  contaminates  the  shallow  water  aquifers  from  which  most  people  draw  their  drinking\nwater.  Solid  waste  management  in  the  majority  of  urban  towns  is  at  best  rudimentary.\nApproximately 50 percent of the total generated solid waste is collected and the remainder is left\nuncollected  and  disposed  of  in  waterways  and  open  fields.  This  results  in  blocked  drainage\nsystems, flooding, and environmental pollution.\n\n48.\nOf the 46 classified urban centers in NWFP, 7 towns participated in the SUDP leaving a\nremainder  of  39  urban  centers  to  be  considered  for  the  proposed  Project.  Towns  will  be\nselected for inclusion in the Project based on a series of assessments of key factors that include\n(i) administrative status (headquarters of either a division, district, or tehsil), (ii) availability of a\nbase map of the town, (iii) population size greater than 20,000 persons, (iv) population growth\nrate,  (v)  level  and  availability  of  social  infrastructure,  (vi)  capability  and  interest  of  the  local\ngovernment,  and  (vii)  economic  potential.  Of  the  24  urban  centers  meeting  the  criteria  for\nadministrative status and population size, seven towns that meet all the criteria were selected\nas first-phase towns under the Project.\n\n49.\nThe  Project  is  formulated  as  a  sector  loan  based  on  the  NWFP  government\u2019s  overall\nlong-term sector requirements for 2001-2020. It will support the Government\u2019s poverty reduction\ninitiatives,  as  well  as  the  forthcoming  devolution  of  power  and  responsibility  to  the  local\ngovernments for the provision and financing of urban infrastructure and municipal services. The\nProject  incorporates  several  strategic  features  and  incentives  for  participation  in  the  Project\nincluding  (i)  promotion  of  policy  reform  in  the  sector,  particularly  financial  management  and\nresource generation at the local government level; (ii) priority to investments that meet the basic\nneeds  of  urban  communities;  (iii)  local  community  participation  and  ownership;  and  (iv)  equity\nparticipation by local governments in the investment packages.\n\n50.\nThe Project meets the criteria for adopting a sector lending modality. A workable urban\nsector framework and strategy exists, and LGERD has the legal mandate for administration of\n\n\f15\n\nthe  local  governments,  for  planning,  finance,  and  infrastructure  development.  In  addition,\nLGERD  has  the  lead  responsibility  for  implementing  the  Government\u2019s  devolution  and  poverty\nreduction  programs.  The  Project  will  also  support  ADB's  urban  sector  strategic  objectives,\nespecially  for  use  of  participatory  approaches,  institutional  development,  devolution  of  service\ndelivery,  targeting  of  low-income  communities,  financial  equity,  and  cost  recovery.  The\nGovernment  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  the  criteria  for  town  participation,  selection  of\nsubprojects, and appraisal standards.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n51.\nThe  overall  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  support  the    (i)  devolution  of  responsibility\nand  authority  to  local  governments  by  expediting  the  policy  reform  process  in  the  sector;  (ii)\ndecentralization  of  economic  growth  to  reduce  provincewide  disparities;  and  (iii)  reduction  of\nurban  infrastructure  deficiencies  in  urban  areas.  The  Project\u2019s  specific  objectives  are  to  (i)\ndemonstrate  effective  interventions  in  urban  services  management  that  can  be  replicated,  (ii)\nstimulate  a  progressive  shift  of  responsibilities  to  urban  local  governments  for  financing  and\nmanagement  of  urban  services,  and  (iii)  improve  management  and  resource  mobilization\ncapacities of urban local governments.\n\n52.\nThe  Project  covers  up  to  24  urban  centers  in  NWFP,  classified  as  MCs  (excluding  7\nurban  centers,  including  Peshawar,  included  under  the  SUDP),  with  a  total  population  of\napproximately 1.0 million, or around 32 percent of the overall provincial urban population. The\nProject gives priority to seven of these centers, which are generally representative of the urban\nsector,  including  Charsadda,  Hangu,  Haripur,  Mansehra,  Takht  Bhai,  Timargara,  and  Swabi,\nwith  a  total  project  population  of  around  400,000.  Each  of  the  seven  centers  has  an  outlined\nstructure  plan,  five-year  investment  plan,  urban  profile,  and  detailed  feasibility  studies  of\nproposed subprojects.\n\nThe  Project  has  two  main  components:  (i)  urban  development,  including  infrastructure\n53.\nimprovements and community development and participation; and (ii) institutional development,\nincluding  project  implementation  support,  municipal  finance  capacity  building,  and  incremental\nadministrative support. A description of these components follows and summary of the prepared\nsubprojects is given in Appendix 9.\n\n1.\n\nUrban Development Component\n\nThe  urban  development  component  comprises \n\nimprovements  and\n54.\ncommunity  development  and  participation,  and  includes  town-specific  investments  in  one  or\nmore  infrastructure  improvement  subprojects,  and  formation  of  CBOs.  The  component  will\ncomplement the Government's initiatives under its Poverty Alleviation Program.\n\ninfrastructure \n\na.\n\nInfrastructure Improvements\n\n55. Water  Supply.  Subprojects  will  be  designed  to  improve  the  service  quality  of  existing\nschemes,  and  increase  revenues  through  a  combination  of  leak-detection  programs  and  the\nconversion of illegal connections to registered accounts. Where necessary, distribution systems\nwill be extended to, or improved for, poorly served areas. Priority will be given to servicing low-\nincome areas. Consideration will be given to installing water meters in towns that have achieved\na  secure  24-hour  supply  system,  and  that  can  demonstrate  the  technical  and  management\ndiscipline required to run a meter-based billing system.\n\n56.\nSewerage and Sanitation. Subprojects will aim to improve the disposal of human waste\nby  increasing  the  use  of  small  sewerage  schemes  with  local  treatment,  encouraging  the\ninstallation  of  adequately  designed  individual  and  communal  septic  tanks,  and  improving  the\n\n\f16\n\nmaintenance  of  septic  tanks  by  introducing  septic  tank  maintenance  services.  Whether  this\nservice  will  be  operated  by  the  MC  or  contracted  out  to  a  private  operator  will  depend  on  the\nMC\u2019s capacity, and realistic projections of the potential revenue resulting from service charges.\n\n57.\nDrainage.  Subprojects  will  focus  on  routine  cleaning  and  rehabilitation  of  existing\nsystems,  with  particular  emphasis  on  the  interconnection  of  isolated  stretches  of  drainage\nchannels into a fully integrated drainage network. Priority areas will be high-density, low-income\nareas,  where  project  intervention  will  result  in  a  marked  improvement  of  living  conditions.\nInvestments  in  new  works  will  focus  on  establishing  drainage  networks  including  suitable\noutfalls. Drainage subprojects will all include the establishment of maintenance procedures and\nsystems,  and  where  necessary,  supported  by  the  provision  of  basic  drainage  cleaning\nequipment.\n\nthereby \n\nrequiring  community  support \n\nSolid  Waste  Management.  Subprojects  will  aim  at  minimal  investment  for  collection\n58.\nsystems, \nthe\nconcentration of waste to neighborhood collection points. Emphasis will be placed on increasing\nthe cash contribution from commercial establishments. Where waste collection equipment is to\nbe  provided  under  the  subproject,  it  will  be  based  on  practicality  and  affordability,  and\nappropriate  to  the  particular  urban  environment.  Waste  disposal  sites  and  new  landfill\ndevelopments will be supported contingent upon the identification of suitable disposal sites that\nmeet established environmental guidelines and controls.\n\nthrough  waste  minimization  and \n\n59.\nRoads and Local Access. Subprojects in the road sector will rehabilitate and improve\nthe  main  urban  road  network  by  resurfacing  and  widening  within  the  existing  right-of-way.\nImproved  access  to  the  town  center  and  local  neighborhoods  will  increase  economic\nopportunities  by  attracting  investment.  Road  projects  include  the  improvement  of  associated\nroadside  drains.  Part  of  the  subproject  will  involve  traffic  management  measures  to  improve\ncirculation  in  congested  town-center  areas,  through  junction  improvement  and  introducing\nrestrictions on parking and roadside vending. Other subprojects will include the extension of the\nroad network, and opening up new areas for controlled development.\n\nb. \n\nCommunity Development and Participation\n\nThis  subcomponent  will  aim  to  develop  organizational  and  human  capacity  within  local\n60.\ngovernment  for  participatory  processes  targeted  at  poverty  reduction  and  basic  needs\nprograms.  During  project  preparation,  a  socioeconomic  survey  was  undertaken  in  the  seven\nfirst-phase  towns,  along  with  public  hearings,  group  interviews,  and  a  selected  household\nsurvey.  In addition, consultations with NGOs and CBOs were initiated during the various town\nmeetings. Where possible, households headed by women were interviewed to develop a better\nunderstanding of their problems and perceived priorities. Urban sector policies in the past were\nfragmented and resulted in a serious erosion of public trust in state mechanisms and their ability\nto  provide  sustainable  public  facilities  and  services  to  urban  communities.  As  a  consequence,\nthe increase in self-help initiatives and in new partnerships between communities, NGOs, and\nthe private sector is significant. Under the Project, CBOs will be established, where they do not\nexist within the participating town, and mechanisms established to develop greater partnerships\nbetween the communities and local governments. For existing CBOs, these relationships will be\nstrengthened,  with  greater  focus  on  this  partnership  role,  and  the  development  of  better\nmunicipal management.\n\n2.\n\nInstitutional Development Component\n\n61.\nThe  institutional  development  component  consists  of  project  implementation  support,\nmunicipal finance capacity building, and incremental administration support, all linked to support\nthe Government\u2019s devolution program, while building the capacity of urban local governments.\n\n\f17\n\na.\n\nProject Implementation Support\n\n62.\n  Involvement  in  the  Project  will  encourage  the  MCs  to  take  a  more  active  role  in\nplanning,  preparing,  designing,  and  managing  the  implementation  of  development  initiatives\nwithin  their  area,  to  the  benefit  of  their  constituency,  largely  consisting  of  the  urban  poor.\nCommitment  to  such  involvement  is  required  for  participation  in  the  Project.  The  MCs  will  be\nhelped to establish, from within their own ranks, a project implementation team (PIT) dedicated\nto  project  preparation  and  implementation.  The  management  of  the  entire  project  cycle  is  the\nprimary  responsibility  of  the  MC,  with  the  Project\u2019s  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  and  its  TA\nteam taking a guiding and monitoring role.\n\nb.\n\nMunicipal Finance and Capacity Building\n\nIn recognition of the critical importance of improved financial performance and increased\n63.\nrevenue collection by the MCs, a specific component of the Project\u2019s institutional development is\ndedicated  to  improving  municipal  financial  management,  by  introducing  improved  accounting\nprocedures and management information systems. With greater devolution of power to the local\ngovernment  levels,  especially  for  the  management  of  urban  services,  along  with  greater  fiscal\nautonomy,  the  development  of  improved  financial  management  systems  and  enhanced\nresource  generation  is  critical  to  the  long-term  sustainability  of  the  urban  centers.  With  the\nassistance of the consultants, the MCs will develop and implement a computerized accounting\nsystem;  improved  financial  management  and  information  systems,  including  budgeting,\nresource  mobilization,  and  enhanced  O&M  of  existing  assets;  and  improved  billing  and\ncollection systems.\n\nc.\n\nIncremental Administration Support\n\n64.\nIncremental  administrative  support  for  project  implementation  is  required  for  the\nprovincial  and  local  governments.  A  PCU,  consisting  of  LGERD  staff,  will  be  responsible  for\nprovincial  coordination,  planning,  and  management  of  project  activities.  A  team  of  12\nprofessional  staff,  representing  various  disciplines,  and  administrative  support  staff,  will  be\nrequired.  At  the  local  level,  a  PIT  will  be  established  in  each  participating  town  to  oversee\nsubproject  planning,  design,  and  implementation;  and  maintain  close  linkages  with  associated\nNGOs  and  CBOs.  One  of  the  major  objectives  of  this  subcomponent  is  to  develop  greater\nownership at the town level.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n65.\nThe Project is estimated to cost $30.0 million equivalent, with foreign exchange costs of\nabout $8.7 million, or about 29 percent of the total project cost, including $0.5 million for interest\nduring  construction.  Local  currency  costs  are  $21.3  million  equivalent,  or  about  71  percent  of\nthe total project cost. The cost of the infrastructure component includes civil works, equipment\nand  materials,  survey,  and  detailed  design  and  supervision.  Table  1  provides  summary  of  the\nproject costs.\n\n\f18\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nItem\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrencya\n\nA.

The  loan  will  cover  98\npercent  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  component  of  the  Project  and  58  percent  of  the  local\ncurrency  cost,  excluding  taxes.  The  Borrower  will  be  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan.  The\nBorrower will pass on loan funds to NWFP on the same terms and conditions as those between\nADB and the Borrower. The Borrower will assume the foreign exchange risk on the loan. NWFP,\ntogether  with  the  participating  MCs,  will  cover  the  remaining  31  percent  of  the  project  cost,\napproximately  $9.2  million  equivalent,  which  includes  (i)  $7.4  million  equivalent  from  NWFP,\nincluding  $0.25  million  in  foreign  currency  cost  for  funding  the  international  municipal  finance\nmanagement  advisor  position  of  13  person-months  under  the  Institutional  Development\nComponent; and (ii) $1.8 million equivalent from the MCs for incremental administration. ADB's\nfinancing  of  local  currency  expenditure  is  justified  by  the  nature  of  the  Project,  which  will\nimprove the living and health conditions of the people in the project areas by upgrading existing\nunsanitary conditions, improving water supply services, and preventing damage to property and\ndisruption  of  lives  caused  by  localized  flooding.  Communities  will  contribute  to  the  cost  of\nimplementing and sustaining sanitation and drainage subprojects where practicable. A summary\nof the financing arrangements is shown in Table 2.\n\n67.\nThe MCs will be required to finance the incremental administration cost associated with\ntheir  involvement  in  the  Project,  and  a  minimum  of  20  percent  of  the  cost  of  town-specific\nsubproject  capital  works  costs,  increasing  to  a  maximum  of  50  percent  based  on  the  MC\u2019s\ncurrent  and  projected  financial  capacity  at  the  time  of  subproject  approval,  through  subloans\nusing project funds. This loan proportion takes account of the MCs\u2019 financial capacity, including\nability  to  impose  user  fees  for  full  cost-recovery  purposes.  Tripartite  subsidiary  project\nagreements, including grant and subloan components, will be entered into between the NWFP\nDepartment of Finance, LGERD, and the participating MCs. Subloans to the MCs will be at an\ninterest rate of 7 percent per annum, with a grace period of 3 years and repayment of principal\nover  a  subsequent  12-year  period.  The  subsidiary  project  agreements  will  include  standard\nterms  and  conditions  for  implementation  of  the  subproject,  and  will  be  supported  by  a  loan\nagreement between the NWFP Department of Finance and the Ministry of Finance. As subloans\n\n\f19\n\nare  repaid,  the  NWFP  Department  of  Finance  has  the  opportunity  to  relend  funds  to  other\nproject MCs and other local governments for investment in urban infrastructure, thus enhancing\nthe sustainability of future urban sector investment by local governments. Funds will be repaid\nto the Ministry of Finance, according to its debt service obligations on the ADB loan. Details of\nthe proposed financing arrangements are shown in Appendix 10.\n\nSource\n\nADB\n\nNWFP Government\n\nMunicipal Committees\n\n         Total\n\nTable 2: Financing Plana\n($ million)\nForeign\n\nLocal\n\nExchange\n\nCurrency\n\n8.5\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n8.7\n\n12.3\n\n7.2\n1.8b\n21.3\n\nTotal\n\nCost\n\n20.8\n\n7.4\n\n1.8\n\n30.0\n\nPercent\n\n69\n\n25\n\n6\n\n100\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, NWFP = North-West Frontier Province.\na   Excludes beneficiary contributions to sanitation subprojects.\nb   Based on cost of incremental administration by MCs.\n\nE.\n\nExecuting Agency\n\n68.\n\nThe Executing Agency for the Project will be the NWFP government through LGERD.\n\nF.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nImplementing Agencies\n\n69.\nA  project  steering  committee  will  be  established  prior  to  loan  effectiveness  to  oversee\nthe Project, and to be chaired by the Secretary LGERD, with committee members consisting of\nrepresentatives  from  DOF,  PDD,  WSD,  and  departments  handling  the  functions  of  PPHD,\nPHED and environmental concerns. The steering committee will meet at least twice a year and\nas often as required.\n\n70.\nThe  PCU,  established  in  LGERD  before  loan  negotiations,  will  (i)  prepare  the  overall\nproject implementation plan and the consolidated annual work plan, (ii) coordinate and appraise\nsubproject  proposals,  (iii)  provide  technical  support  and  supervision  functions  for  subproject\nimplementation,  (iv)  plan  and  coordinate  activities  to  improve  local  government  financial\nmanagement, (v) plan and guide community participation, (vi) advise on terms of reference and\nconsultant  selection \nfacilitate  project\ncoordination,  (viii)  prepare  consolidated  progress  reports  and  documentation,  (ix)  organize\nproject  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  activities,  and  (x)  prepare  the  project\ncompletion report. The PCU\u2019s large agenda of activities range from the continual monitoring of\nMC participation criteria to providing technical support and supervisory functions for subproject\nimplementation.  The  PCU  will  be  headed  by  a  Project  Director  from  LGERD  and  have  12\nprofessional staff, supported by international and domestic consultants.\n\nfor  design  and  supervision  of  subprojects,  (vii) \n\n71.\nAt  the  local  government  level,  PITs  will  be  established  within  each  participating  MC  to\nmanage subproject implementation. Procurement of goods and services for all subprojects will\nbe  initiated  by  the  PITs  and  will  be  ratified  by  a  local  bid  evaluation  committee,  including\nrepresentation from the MC, PCU, and district councils. Each PIT will comprise four professional\nstaff,  identified  from  the  MC\u2019s  permanent  professional  cadre,  and  managed  by  a  senior\nengineer. Details of the project organization are given in Appendix 11.\n\n\f20\n\n2. \n\nParticipation in the Project\n\na. \n\nCriteria\n\nUrban  towns  to  be  included  in  the  Project  will  need  to  show  willingness  to  provide\n72.\ntechnical  staff  to  manage  and  implement  the  subprojects,  and  adequate  financial  capacity  to\nservice  debt  requirements.  Subprojects10  will  be  identified  and  prepared  through  a  subproject\nplanning  and  appraisal  process  under  which  user  demands,  and  financial,  economic,  and\naffordability  considerations  are  fully  integrated  with  technical,  environmental,  social,  and\ninstitutional factors. Least-cost technical solutions will be a focus of the subprojects. A total of 11\ncore subprojects were prepared during the TA; these subprojects are representative of the high\npriority  urban  infrastructure  improvements  in  accordance  with  the  needs  of  the  first-phase\nparticipating  urban  towns,  and  in  the  context  of  the  town\u2019s  development  plans.  Based  on  the\ncurrent  financial  and  management  capacity  of  the  first-phase  towns,  the  proposed  core\nsubprojects include water supply, sewerage and drainage, solid waste management, and road\nimprovements. Their financial internal rates of return range from 6 to 17 percent.\n\n73.\nEntry participation of MCs in the Project will be conditional on (i) setting up a PIT from\nthe existing staff cadre, consisting of at least a senior qualified municipal engineer, bookkeeper,\nclerk,  and  senior  officer  to  be  assigned  as  a  community  liaison  officer;  (ii)  undertaking  to\nimplement  an  updated  improved  accounting  system  and  management  information  systems  to\nbe  provided  under  the  Project;  (iii)  committing  to  increase  revenues  to  implement  proposed\nsubprojects; (iv) agreeing to finance a minimum of 20 percent of subproject capital works cost,\nand up to a maximum of 50 percent based on the current and projected financial capacity; (v)\nhaving an up-to-date base map, with the outline of an urban structure plan as a guide for future\ndevelopment; and (vi) providing evidence of preparedness to implement an improved municipal\nfinance and accounting procedures.\n\nb.\n\nSubproject Selection and Preparation\n\n74.\nSubprojects will be located in participating project towns throughout NWFP, and will be\nsmall to moderate in value (most will be between $100,000 and $1 million equivalent). Priority\nsubproject investments will be identified by the MCs; feasibility studies will be prepared by the\nPIT,  appraised  by  the  PCU,  and  approved  by  ADB.  Management  action  and  financial  plans\nprepared  by  the  MCs  upon  acceptance  into  the  Project  will  be  updated  as  required  to  ensure\nthat  the  MCs  implement  actions  required  to  continue  development  of  long-term  technical  and\nfinancial capacity. This process will ensure that the proposed investments are focused, respond\nto  local  basic  needs  and  demand  for  services,  designed  to  appropriate  standards,  suitably\njustified, and sustainable. Prior to approval of any subproject, the MC will have undertaken the\nfollowing  actions  to  improve  its  financial  capacity:  (i)  register  all  water  connections;  (ii)  ensure\nthat  the  immovable  property  tax  register  has  been  updated;  (iii)  identify  potential  municipal\nincome at least for water fees and immovable property tax, and current and potential collection\nefficiencies;  (iv)  develop  a  time-bound  action  plan,  in  coordination  with  the  provincial  urban\nsector policy action plan, to increase revenue at least from water fees and immovable property\ntax; and (v) agree to implement a program of user fees for solid waste collection and cleaning of\nseptic tanks.\n\nRequests for subprojects with outline project description, and rationale will originate from\n75.\nthe MCs. Successful subprojects will provide basic urban services and needs, be directly aimed\nat  poverty  reduction  and  improving  economic  opportunities,  and  have  a  low  investment  with\nemphasis  on  improved  processes  for  rehabilitating  and  maintaining  existing  municipal  assets.\n\n10 A subproject is defined as an urban infrastructure investment package in a single subsector.\n\n                  \n\n\f21\n\nAggregate  investment  for  subprojects  per  town  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  $1  million.\nFollowing  confirmation  that  the  proposed  subproject(s)  meet  the  agreed  eligibility  criteria  for\nfunding under the Project, the MC through its PIT will proceed with subproject preparation, with\ntechnical guidance from the project staff at the PCU when required. Subproject appraisal reports\nwill  include  (i)  the  rationale,  scope,  target  beneficiaries,  design  standards,  cost,  and\nimplementation  and  procurement  arrangements;  (ii)  environmental  clearances,  and  social,\neconomic,  and  financial  justification;  (iii)  evidence  of  technical,  managerial,  and  financial\nperformance of the MC to demonstrate that it will be able to cover O&M costs and debt service\nassociated  with  the  proposed  subproject;  and  (iv)  identification  of  actions  to  update  the  MC\u2019s\nmanagement and financial action plan to take into account the proposed subproject. Feasibility\nstudies will be documented in standardized subproject appraisal reports.\n\n76.\nFollowing  approval  by  ADB,  the  MC  will  sign  a  subsidiary  project  agreement  with  the\nDepartment of Finance, and with LGERD as a party to the agreement, regarding the loan and\ngrant component of the subproject. This agreement will describe any conditions and covenants\nthat  must  be  satisfied  by  the  MC  before  or  during  subproject  implementation.  Prior  to  signing,\nthe first subsidiary project agreement will be submitted to ADB for approval.\n\nc.\n\nCommunity Participation\n\n77.\nParticular  emphasis  will  be  given  to  developing  forms  and  mechanisms  for  community\nparticipation  that  are  appropriate  to  the  sociocultural  and  political  environment  of  urban\ncommunities  in  small  towns  in  NWFP.    Lessons  can  be  learned  from  the  successful\nestablishment of CBOs as a means to plan and deliver small-scale infrastructure improvements\nwithin the Community Infrastructure Program in NWFP.  While these were predominantly in rural\nareas,  important  lessons  can  nevertheless  be  drawn.  Participatory  techniques  need  to  be\ndesigned to improve communication between community groups and government, and to make\ngovernment more responsive to the priority needs of its constituency.\n\nThe community participation component of the program will be planned and designed by\n78.\nthe community development adviser as part of the institutional development team to the PCU.\nFor project towns, mechanisms need to be established to organize and mobilize communities to\nparticipate  in  improving  delivery  of  urban  services  in  general,  and  in  the  project  activities  in\nparticular. The form, nature, and mechanism of this participation will vary depending on the type\nof subproject, and the interests, willingness, and skills of the community. The integration of the\nparticipatory  processes  with  current  operations  will  be  a  focus  of  the  community  participation\ncomponent.\n\n79.\nThe  Project  will  include  one  or  more  NWFP-based  NGOs  to  establish  sustainable\ngovernment-community  partnerships  in  the  development  of  effective  and  lasting  channels  of\ncommunication. The NGO activities will be coordinated by the community development adviser\nin  the  PCU.  The  objectives  of  the  NGO  involvement  will  be  to  (i)  jointly  determine  the\nappropriate  nature  and  extent  of  community  participation;  (ii)  assist  with  formulating  suitable\nmechanisms for government-community interaction; and (iii) develop organizational and human\ncapacity  within  local  government  for  participatory  processes  aimed  at  poverty  reduction  and\nbasic needs activities.\n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n80.\nTo  support  Project  implementation,  396  person-months  of  consulting  services  (36\nperson-months  international  and  360  person-months  domestic)  will  be  required,  covering  (i)\nproject  management  support  to  the  PCU  and  PITs,  including  subproject  preparation  and\nappraisal,  and  capacity  building  for  subproject  implementation  by  local  government  agencies\n(214 person-months); and (ii) capacity building for municipal financial management to the MCs,\n\n\f22\n\nto improve accounting systems and increase local revenues (182 person-months). Consultants\nwill support staff within LGERD and the MCs. The consultants will be engaged through a firm in\naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  In  addition,  one  or  more\nNWFP-based  NGOs,  to  be  recruited  by  the  government,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  and  in\naccordance  with  guidelines  established  in  PDD  for  NGO  recruitment,  will  be  involved  in  the\nprocess of establishing sustainable government-community partnerships, for the development of\neffective and lasting channels of communication. Outline terms of reference for consultants are\ngiven in Appendix 12.\n\n4. \n\nProcurement\n\n81.\nProcurement will generally be carried out by the MCs under the guidance of the PCU. All\nprocurement will follow ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Since most of the project sites will be\nsmall  and  scattered,  the  Project  is  not  likely  to  attract  international  civil  works  contractors.  All\ncivil  works  subprojects  are  expected  to  be  less  than  $1.0  million  and  will  therefore  be\nundertaken through local competitive bidding in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB.\nEach  subproject  should  be  procured  as  a  single  contract.  Where  the  contract  value  exceeds\n$1.0 million, the contract will be procured through international competitive bidding procedures.\nEquipment items that are locally available and cost more than $50,000 equivalent and less than\n$100,000  equivalent  may  be  procured  through  local  competitive  bidding,  while  items  costing\nless  than  $50,000  may  be  procured  through  direct  purchase  in  accordance  with  procedures\nacceptable  to  ADB.  International  shopping  will  be  followed  for  materials  and  equipment\npackages  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $100,000  but  less  than  $500,000  equivalent,  while\nmaterials  and  equipment  packages  costing  in  excess  of  $500,000  equivalent  will  be  procured\nthrough international competitive bidding procedures. All procurement will be channeled through\nthe PCU for concurrence prior to submission to ADB for approval.\n\n5. \n\nDisbursement\n\n82.\nTo  ensure  the  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds  and  to  expedite  project  implementation,\nand subject to ADB\u2019s assessment of the accounting systems and internal control of LGERD, an\nimprest  account  will  be  established  in  LGERD  promptly  after  loan  effectiveness.  The\nestablishment  and  operation  of  the  imprest  account  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan\nDisbursement Handbook. The initial deposit to the imprest account will be based on estimated\nexpenditures  for  the  first  four  months  of  project  implementation,  but  will  not  exceed  the\nequivalent  of  $200,000.  ADB's  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  may  be  used  for\nreimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  to  the  imprest  account.  The\nstatement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  applicable  to  contracts  amounting  to  $50,000  or\nless.\n\n6. \n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\n83.\nResponsibility  for  O&M  of  the  project  facilities  will  rest  with  the  MCs.  Communities  will\nalso  play  an  important  role  in  O&M,  particularly  for  solid  waste  management  and  drainage\nmaintenance,  where  community  involvement  and  active  participation  is  critical.  Routine\nmaintenance  in  urban  centers  in  NWFP  has  deteriorated  over  recent  years,  as  a  result  of\ninadequate funding, ill-defined responsibilities, and lack of a service-oriented perception/attitude\nin  local  government.  The  emphasis  placed  in  the  institutional  development  component  of  the\nProject  to  improve  financial  management  and  increase  MCs\u2019  resource  generation  is  largely\naimed  at  reversing  this  trend.  Project  guidance  and  monitoring  by  the  PCU  will  focus  on\nevidence  of  tangible  improvement  in  O&M.  Increasing  community  awareness  of  the  MCs\u2019\nconstitutional responsibility for O&M will apply pressure to council staff to improve performance,\n\n\f23\n\nwhile  simultaneously  identifying  a  role  for  community  groups  in  neighborhood  maintenance.\nSubproject agreements will emphasize adequate O&M of subprojects as a condition for financial\nsupport.\n\n7.\n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n84.\nBy their nature, only solid waste disposal, drainage, and road improvement subprojects\ncan  be  expected  to  require  any  land  acquisition,  and  even  this  will  be  minimal.  During  project\npreparation,  no  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  was  identified  for  core  subprojects.  The\napproval  of  subproject  appraisal  reports  will  be  conditional  on  the  inclusion  of  a  detailed\ntimetable  for  land  acquisition  that  is  acceptable  to  ADB.  Resettlement  of  people  is  unlikely.  If\ninvoluntary resettlement is unavoidable, a resettlement plan will be prepared by the MC, with the\nassistance of the project consultants and in consultation with the community. The resettlement\nplan,  which  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  the\nHandbook on Resettlement, 1998, will be submitted to ADB for its review and approval as part\nof the subproject appraisal report.\n\n8. \n\nPublic-Private and Community Partnerships\n\n85.\nSome  of  the  subprojects  proposed  appear  suitable  for  private  sector  involvement  with\nO&M.  In  particular,  the  solid  waste  management  and  the  septic  tank  desludging  service\npromoted  as  part  of  the  Project  are  primary  targets  for  private  sector  operation.  However,\ncurrent conditions in MCs are not immediately conducive to effective public-private partnerships.\nThe  present  record  on  cost  recovery  of  basic  services  by  collecting  fees  and  charges  is  such\nthat local entrepreneurs are unlikely to be interested in assuming service contracts. In addition,\nthe  MCs  have  had  little  or  no  experience  in  formulating  or  effectively  managing  private  sector\nservice contracts.\n\nThe  potential  for  community  partnerships  in  the  delivery  of  urban  services,  the  form  of\n86.\nparticipation developed, and the role of each partner will be influenced by the complexity of work\nto  be  undertaken  and  the  degree  to  which  the  community  feels  ownership  of  the  work  being\ncarried out.  The array of service types (water, sanitation, solid waste, etc.), the scale of these\nservices  (primary,  secondary,  or  tertiary),  and  stage  of  their  implementation  (planning,\nconstruction,  or  maintenance)  create  a  range  of  opportunities  for  participation.  Therefore,\nservice  delivery  must  be  disaggregated,  to  consider  the  potential  roles  of  partners  at  the\ndifferent levels and to integrate these into a practical implementation proposal.\n\n9. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n87.\nThe Project will be implemented over six years, beginning in early 2002, with completion\nby  31  December  2007.  The  Project  is  expected  to  be  undertaken  in  three  phases,  with  three\nbatches  of  provincial  towns.  Phase  1  will  involve  seven  towns,  with  subprojects  already\nappraised, and ready for detailed design and implementation. Subprojects for phases 2 and 3\nwill include groups of about five towns that come on stream in years 2 and 3, at approximately\n18-month  intervals.  The  six-year  implementation  period  is  considered  appropriate,  given  the\nlarge number of subprojects, the geographic spread of the Project, and the institutional capacity\nof the local governments. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 13.\n\n\f24\n\n10.\n\nMonitoring and Reporting\n\na.\n\nMidterm Review\n\n88.\nA midterm review will be carried out within three years of loan effectiveness. The review\nwill  include  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  the  project  implementation  arrangements,  with\nprogress  checked  against  the  designed  targets,  consultations  with  community  groups,  and  a\nreview of the institutional and policy development aspects.\n\nb.\n\nProject Performance Monitoring System\n\n89.\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  a  comprehensive  performance  monitoring  program\nacceptable  to  ADB  is  implemented  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  technical  performance  and\nsocial  and  economic  benefits  of  the  Project,  especially  to  the  poor  and  women.  The\nperformance monitoring indicators and procedures will be tested with respect to data availability\nand  other  constraints,  revised  if  necessary,  and  institutionalized  as  part  of  the  Project\u2019s\nmanagement  information  system.  Participating  towns  will  be  responsible  for  undertaking\nperiodic monitoring and assessment of the performance monitoring activities for subprojects. To\nmeasure  the  project  impacts  on  the  beneficiaries,  particularly  marginalized  groups  within\nparticipating towns, accurate baseline information must be established at the commencement of\nsubproject  implementation,  with  this  information  being  the  basis  for  determining  the  resulting\nimpacts.  Monitorable  indicators  will  consist  of  (i)  institutional  development  indicators  covering\nrevenue generation and financial management, along with O&M; (ii) subproject implementation\nindicators  for  the  various  categories  and  types  of  urban  infrastructure,  including  levels  of\ncoverage  and  service  delivery;  and  (iii)  sectoral  impact  indicators,  covering  economic  growth,\npublic health, and community participation aspects.\n\nc.\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\n90.\nThe  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project\nimplementation. The progress reports, to be prepared by the PITs and consolidated by the PCU,\nwill provide a narrative description of project progress during the period, any modifications to the\nproject  schedule,  problems  and  difficulties  experienced,  and  a  description  of  the  work  to  be\ncarried out in the next period. The progress reports will provide summary financial accounts for\nthe Project consisting of project expenditures during the quarter, year-to-date expenditures, and\ntotal  expenditures  to  date.  The  PCU  will  address  the  institutional  and  policy  development\naspects of the Project, and maintain separate accounts for the Project. Detailed annual project\naccounts and statements of the imprest account will be submitted to ADB in audited form within\n9  months  of  the  close  of  the  fiscal  year.  The  auditor  appointed  to  audit  the  accounts  will  be\nacceptable  to  ADB.  LGERD  will  submit  to  ADB,  within  three  months  of  physical  completion  of\nthe  Project,  a  project  completion  report  that  will  cover  the  details  of  project  implementation,\ncosts,  BME  activities  and  results  at  that  time,  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  and  other\ninformation that may be requested by ADB.\n\nd.\n\nManagement and Financial Action Plans\n\n91.\nThe  need  to  define  a  base  from  which  improved  financial  and  technical  management\ncapabilities  of  the  MCs  can  be  developed  is  essential  for  long-term  sustainability  of  urban\ninfrastructure provision. The means of subsequent management improvement will only flow from\nfuture  actions  of  (i)  the  MCs;  (ii)  the  NWFP  Government  through  its  influence  on  water  tariffs\nand collection of the immovable property tax; and (iii) support and changes in the environment\nin which the MCs operate, and promoted as a result of the devolution initiatives of the federal\nGovernment.  Financial  management  performance  will  continue  to  be  critical  to  MC  capacity\n\n\f25\n\nthroughout  and  beyond  the  project  period.  Continuous  improvement  will  be  required  for  the\nproduction  of  management  information  and  annual  account  preparation;  production  of  regular\ncash  flow  statements;  liability  identification;  and  most  critically,  regular  review  of  tariffs  and\ncharges and collection efficiency. To improve their financial capacity to contract loans, the MCs\nmust (i) ensure that revenue growth is incorporated into their charging policy, and (ii) exercise\ndiscipline  in  formulating  future  expenditure  plans  against  the  background  of  known  financial\nliabilities. Participating MCs will be required to report to the PCU on implementation of financial\nmanagement action plans, and in the event of shortfalls, will discuss and agree on interventions\nnecessary to achieve the original targets.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\n92.\nThe  Project  will  address  environmental  and  social  issues  related  to  identifying,\npreparing, and implementing subprojects, and will take steps to alleviate negative environmental\nand  social  aspects.  Sample  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  of  selected  prepared\nsubprojects identify positive impacts on the environment. Initial environmental examinations will\nbe  prepared  for  all  subprojects  in  accordance  with  relevant  Government  regulations  and  ADB\nguidelines, and documented in the subproject appraisal reports. The Environmental Protection\nAgency, originally located within PDD, and created in October 1992, was upgraded and made a\nregular attached department on 4 November 1993. The agency, headed by a director general, is\nresponsible  for  enforcing  environmental  laws  and  standards  across  all  departments  and\norganizations within the province. In addition, an environment section was commissioned within\nPDD on 20 January 1992. This section is responsible for developing environmental plans and\npolicies,  and  integrating  environmental  concerns  in  development  planning.  Environmental\nimpact  assessments  of  public  sector  projects,  will  be  reviewed  by  the  environment  section  to\nensure  that  environmentally  damaging  projects  are  not  approved.  Initial  environmental\nexaminations will be prepared initially at the local government level and, if necessary, through\nthe department for environment at the provincial level.\n\n2.\n\nSocial\n\n93.\nSocial  measures  will  be  incorporated  into  the  preparation  of  subprojects  by  consulting\nwith  beneficiary  groups,  particularly  women  and  the  poor,  CBOs,  and  NGOs  to  ensure\nmaximum participation of such groups in subproject identification, preparation, implementation,\nand O&M of completed subprojects. CBOs are by far the most important community group as\nthey  generally  represent  low-income  communities  and  are  found  in  most  of  the  urban  towns.\nCBOs represent a community structure in low-income neighborhoods that can be tapped during\nproject  implementation.  In  project  towns  where  CBOs  do  not  exist,  NGOs  recruited  under  the\nProject will assist in establishing CBOs. Sample perception surveys carried out in the first-phase\nproject towns provide an assessment of public perceptions of urban infrastructure, urban service\ndelivery, community priorities, absorptive capacity, willingness to pay, and gender issues.\n\nEach  PIT,  in  association  with  NGOs  and  CBOs,  will  develop  and  implement  a\n94.\ncoordinated public information, education, and participation program with the participating local\ngovernments. The program, which will be sustained over the duration of the Project, will focus\non (i) the proper use of the facilities; (ii) the benefits of good hygiene and public health; and (iii)\nleaders  and\ncommunity  participation \nspokespersons, including women, to determine existing and future needs and to establish day-\nto-day activities for adequate O&M of public facilities.\n\nthrough  a  consultative  process  with  community \n\n\f26\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses\n\n1.\n\nAnalyses\n\n95.\nIndicative economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) and financial internal rates of return\n(FIRRs)  for  a  representative  range  of  subprojects  are  shown  in  Appendix  14.  The  evaluations\nindicate (i) an EIRR of 17 percent for road improvements, based on savings in vehicle operating\ncosts  and  personal  travel  time  savings;  (ii)  an  FIRR  of  6  percent  for  sanitation  improvements,\nbased on indications of willingness to pay; (iii) an FIRR of 7 percent for solid waste, based on\nindications of willingness to pay and reduced O&M costs to clear drains; and (iv) an FIRR of 11\npercent for improved water supply, based on increased revenue from tariffs. An analysis of the\nsensitivity of the results of the evaluations to changes in key variables (including a 10 percent\nincrease in capital costs, a 10 percent reduction in benefits, a delay of one year in subproject\nbenefits,  and  combinations  of  these  changes)  indicates  that,  with  the  exception  of  the  road\nimprovement project, the EIRRs and FIRRs fall to generally very low levels.\n\n96.\nGiven  the  subprojects'  focus  on  public  good,  and  the  external  socioeconomic  and\nenvironmental  benefits  that  will  accrue  from  them,  but  which  cannot  be  quantified  fully  in\nfinancial  or  economic  terms,  the  EIRRs  and  the  FIRRs  of  the  sample  subprojects  indicate  the\npotential  for  returns  from  the  investments  to  be  reasonable.  In  the  sensitivity  analysis  for  the\nsubprojects,  the  lowest  EIRR  and  FIRR  were  both  4.1  percent,  with  the  FIRR  exceeding  the\nweighted average cost of capital of 2.5 percent incurred by the MCs to implement subprojects.\n\n2.\n\nFinancial Projections for Urban Towns\n\n97.\nThe seven first-phase MCs currently have positive, though modest, cash balances. The\ntowns have generally achieved a small excess of revenue over expenditure in recent years, but\nall  incurred  a  deficit  in  1997/98  due  to  unusually  large  increases  in  expenditure.  With  modest\nreserves,  the  towns  have  limited  capacity  to  operate  deficits,  and  thus  keep  their  income  and\nexpenditure  broadly  in  balance.  From  1996/97  to  1998/99,  the  MCs  were  able  to  undertake\ndevelopment  expenditure  that  was,  on  average,  equal  to  15  percent  of  their  total  outlays.\nHowever, the modest financial turnover of the MCs resulted in total capital outlays for the seven\ntowns of only PRs5 million per annum. Achieving a sustainable increase in investment in public\ninfrastructure through the Project by participating MCs will require a substantial increase in their\nrevenue  to  finance  the  incremental  administrative  cost  of  implementing  subprojects,  improved\nO&M,  and  eventually,  debt  service  on  subloans.  This  will  be  supported  by  implementation  of\nimproved  accounting  and  financial  management  procedures  by  MCs  through  the  municipal\nfinance capacity building component of the Project.\n\n3.\n\nCost Recovery, Subsidies, and Sustainability\n\n98.\nSurveys indicate only limited willingness by the community to pay for improved services\n(about PRs11 per household per month for improved drainage and sanitation, and PRs25 per\nhousehold per month for improved water supply), despite current high levels of morbidity due to\nwaterborne diseases. The community development and participation component of the Project\nis  designed  to  increase  public  understanding  and  ownership  of  subprojects  to  improve  the\ncapacity to impose higher charges to improve cost recovery.\n\n\fB. \n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n27\n\n99.\nThe  urban  infrastructure  and  community  development  components  of  the  Project  will\nimprove  living  conditions,  the  local  environment,  and  the  provision  of  services  needed  by\nhouseholds and businesses in up to 24 MCs with a current total population of about 1.0 million.\nThe  direct  beneficiaries  of  improvements  in  urban  infrastructure  and  services  include  people\nwho will gain access to new services, and people for whom existing services will be improved.\nIn  addition,  indirect  benefits  related  to  improved  solid  waste  management,  environmental\nsanitation, and drainage will accrue to the general population living in the towns covered by the\nProject.  The  involvement  of  the  public  in  subprojects  will  complement  and  reinforce  the\nimmediate economic and health benefits associated with water supply, drainage, sanitation, and\nsolid waste management components of the Project by ensuring sustainability and ownership.\n\nThe  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases  is  high  in  towns,  with  about  80  percent  of\n100.\nhouseholds surveyed in the initial project towns reporting that a member of the household had\nbeen ill during the month prior to the survey. Improved access to water supply and solid waste\nservices  will  save  time,  raise  public  health  standards,  and  reduce  the  physical  burden  for\nwomen and children, who are mainly responsible for carrying water and garbage. The sanitation\nand  drainage  components  will  raise  public  health  standards  by  diverting  effluent  to  suitable\noutfalls away from residential areas and by increasing the treatment of effluent. Improved health\nstandards  will  reduce  the  number  of  school  days  and  workdays  lost  to  illness  and  medical\nexpenditures.  The  drainage  components  will  reduce  the  risk  of  flood  damage  to  property,  and\nhealth  risks  resulting  from  flooding  and  stagnant  water.  Road  subprojects  will  ease  traffic\ncongestion,  facilitate  access  and  mobility,  improve  road  safety,  and  reduce  the  level  of  air\npollution and noise.\n\nThe Project will consider and address the needs of, in particular, the urban poor, women\n101.\nand  children.  The  selection  criteria \nimplementation\narrangements,  will  ensure  that  subprojects  are  targeted  to  primarily  benefit  these  groups.  The\ncommunity  development  and  participation  component  of  the  Project  will  maximize  community\ninvolvement, by both beneficiary groups and CBOs, in subproject identification, preparation, and\nimplementation,  and  will  increase  the  awareness  of  MC  staff  of  their  responsibilities  and\ncommunity  expectations.  This  will  be  critical  for  the  ultimate  success  of  the  Project  and  the\nsustainability of the benefits it delivers (Appendix 15).\n\nfor  subprojects,  and  design  and \n\n102.\nThe  Project  will  improve  the  living  conditions  of  up  to  400,000  residents  in  about  26\nurban  centers  and  will  enhance  the  quality  of  life  and  health,  improve  the  environment,  and\ncreate conditions conducive to sustained urban development and economic growth. The Project\nwill  contribute  to  a  reduction  in  mortality,  morbidity,  and  poverty,  and  the  loss  of  amenity\nassociated  with  environmental  degradation  in  the  urban  centers,  among  all  segments  of  the\ncommunity,  especially  among  slum  inhabitants  and  poor  groups,  particularly  women  and\nchildren, who are estimated to make up 15 percent of the urban population. The Project will also\nsupport  improvements  to  the  capacity  of  local  governments,  improving  their  financial  and\noperational management and planning, including local resource generation.\n\nC. \n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n103.\nTwo notable sources of substantially increased income are the immovable property tax,\nwhich  is  entirely  the  responsibility  of  the  NWFP  government,  and  water  charges,  the  rates  for\nwhich are set by the NWFP government. The MCs and the NWFP government have indicated a\nwillingness to implement actions to increase MC revenue. Immediately required actions are to (i)\ninitiate incremental increases in water charges over the first two years of project implementation\nto PRs85 per household per month; (ii) identify and regularize illegal water connections; and (iii)\n\n\f28\n\nprepare  a  clear  tax  base  for  the  immovable  property  tax,  to  identify  potential  income  from  the\ntax,  and  to  implement  a  plan  to  significantly  increase  revenue  from  the  tax,  especially  in  MCs\nwhere current collection efficiency is below 10 percent. The real level of the water rate will need\nto be increased by about 5 percent per annum so that expenditure on O&M can be increased\nand full cost recovery for water services eventually achieved.\n\n104. Surveys indicate only limited willingness by the community to pay for improved services\ndespite high levels of morbidity due to waterborne diseases. Increased confidence in MC ability\nto  deliver  improved  water,  drainage,  sanitation,  and  waste  disposal  services,  and  enhanced\nunderstanding  of  the  benefits  of  these  improvements  are  needed  to  boost  the  community\u2019s\nwillingness  to  pay  for  the  benefits  that  will  accrue.  The  community  development  and\nparticipation component of the Project is designed to support this process. The potential exists\nto  add  a  surcharge  to  water  charges  or  the  immovable  property  tax  to  recover  the  cost  of\nproviding improved drainage, sanitation, and waste disposal services. Specific charges can be\nimposed  for  solid  waste  disposal  from  concentrated  sources  of  waste  such  as  markets,\ncommercial areas, and industrial sites.\n\n105.\nFinancial  projections  for  the  seven  MCs  initially  proposed  for  inclusion  in  the  Project\nindicate a capacity and general willingness to generate sufficient revenue to meet incremental\nadministration  and  O&M  costs,  and  debt  service  associated  with  subprojects  implementation.\nThe principal sources of additional revenue are the immovable property tax and water charges,\nand  revenue  from  charges  for  infrastructure  and  services  resulting  from  subprojects.  The\nfinancial  projections  indicate  the  potential  for  the  MCs  to  service  subloans,  with  the  minimum\ndebt service coverage ratio being an acceptable 3.1. If a substantial increase in income from the\nimmovable property tax and water charges cannot be achieved the ability for MCs to undertake\nimproved O&M and to service subloans will be jeopardized.\n\n106. A proposed incremental increase in the cost of water over the first two years of project\nimplementation  from  PRs60  to  PRs85  per  household  per  month  is  expected  to  increase  the\naverage level of O&M costs in the seven first-phase project towns from the current 46 percent to\n60  percent  after  allowing  for  an  increase  in  O&M  costs  to  a  more  adequate  level.  The  higher\nrate  of  PRs85  per  household  per  month  is  equal  to  2  percent  of  average  25th  percentile\nhousehold income of PRs4,500 per household per month, which suggests that the real level of\nwater tariffs could still be increased, while still ensuring adequate access to water by low income\nhouseholds.  However,  continuing  real  increases  in  recurrent  expenditure  are  needed  to  bring\nO&M to a level that will enable current water supply systems to be sustained over the long term.\nAccordingly,  full  cost  recovery  for  water  supply  systems  is  unlikely  to  be  achievable  during\nproject  implementation.  However,  where  water  meters  are  installed,  water  charges  should  be\nadjusted  to  achieve  full  cost  recovery  within  three  years;  higher  charges  can  be  imposed  for\nusers of large quantities of water while ensuring that low income groups have access to water at\nan affordable rate.\n\n107.\nThe lack of a tradition of user charges for sanitation, drainage, and solid waste disposal\nmakes it difficult to achieve full cost recovery for these services. Moreover, under ADB\u2019s policy\non subsidies, moderate cost subsidy can be provided for these services because of their pubic\ngood  features  and  the  positive  externalities  that  result  from  their  presence.  User  charges  for\nsolid waste collection and sanitation will be initiated for the Project, albeit at a low level initially\nand  with  real  increases  in  charges  over  time  as  household  income  rises  and  community\nacceptance  of  the  approach  increases.  In  the  meantime,  the  immovable  property  tax  provides\nthe  most  effective  means  to  finance  the  cross-subsidy  for  those  services  where  full  cost\nrecovery  is  not  achieved;  the  tax  is  mildly  progressive  and  is  used  in  many  countries  as  a\nmeans  to  finance  urban  services  such  as  drainage  and  solid  waste  collection.  This  reinforces\nthe critical need to increase the collection efficiency for the immovable property tax.\n\n\f29\n\nThe  public  good  features  and  the  positive  externalities  of  the  subprojects  justify  the\n108.\nprovision  of  a  maximum  of  80  percent  of  the  cost  of  subprojects  as  a  grant,  with  the  MCs\nborrowing the remaining minimum 20 percent of the cost of the capital works of the subprojects.\nThe  NWFP  government  and  MCs  will  also  finance  incremental  administration  and  O&M  costs\nfor  subproject  implementation  and  debt  service  obligations  from  their  own  resources,\nsupplemented  by  enhanced  user  charges.  The  community  development, \ninstitutional\ndevelopment, and municipal finance capacity building assistance provided under the Project will\nimprove  financial  management  and  community  understanding;  this  should  enable  subsidies  to\nbe reduced and O&M improved, thereby ensuring project sustainability.\n\nD. \n\nRisks\n\nto \n\nrelating \n\n(ii)  uncertainties \n\nThe  major  risks  associated  with  the  Project  include  (i)  NWFP  government  borrowing\n109.\ncapacity; \nimplementation  of  devolution  of\nthe  effective \nresponsibilities  to  the  local  governments,  (iii)  limited  institutional  capacity  of  the  local\ngovernments to respond to additional devolved responsibilities, and (iv) low financial capacity of\nthe  MCs  resulting  in  fewer  participating  urban  towns  and  subprojects  than  projected.  The\nProject involves a significant degree of policy initiatives. It will be implemented through the local\ngovernments, and with extensive community participation to develop project ownership, leading\nto greater accountability at the local level. The major project risks have been minimized and will\nbe adequately responded to by the Project.\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard\n\n110.\nassurances incorporated in the legal documents.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe NWFP government, in line with the Government\u2019s devolution program (Local\nGovernment  Plan  2000),  will  implement  the  time-bound  Urban  Sector  Policy\nAction  Plan,  and  will  advise  ADB  on  an  annual  basis  of  actions  taken  to\nimplement the plan.\n\nExisting  block  water  tariffs  within  the  MCs  will  be  incrementally  increased  over\nthe first two years of project implementation, from the present level of PRs60 per\nhousehold per month, to PRs85 per household per month, along with measures\nto improve collection of water charges.\n\nThe  NWFP  government  will  agree  to  the  full  application  of  the  immovable\nproperty tax in all participating MCs, as a condition of participation in the Project,\nalong with an incremental increase in the existing tax base.\n\nThe  NWFP  government  will  ensure  that  each  participating  MC  will  have\nestablished a PIT prior to acceptance in the Project.\n\nEach participating MC will be required to commit a minimum of 20 percent, and\nup  to  a  maximum  of  50  percent,  based  on  the  MCs  current  and  projected\nfinancial capacity at the time of subproject approval, of the total cost of the capital\nworks of each subproject to be implemented within their respective town.\n\n(vi) \n\nParticipating  MCs  will  prepare  management  and  financial  action  plans  for  their\ntechnical and financial management strengthening, which will show that they can\n\n\f30\n\nmeet their obligations, including the cost of O&M of subprojects and debt service,\nto ensure long-term sustainability, as a criteria for participation in the Project.\n\n(vii) \n\nThe  federal  Government  will  continue  to  accord  priority  to  schemes  and\nprograms aimed at poverty reduction and community participation.\n\n(viii)  The federal Government will ensure and cause the NWFP government to ensure\nthat the PCU and MCs maintain separate accounts and reports in relation to the\nProject and subprojects that are to be included in the reports and accounts to be\nsubmitted to ADB.\n\nVII.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the\n111.\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  16,136,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  North-West\nFrontier Province Urban Development Sector Project, with a term of 32 years, including a grace\nperiod  of  8  years,  and  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the\ngrace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are\nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreement\npresented to the Board.\n\n16 October 2001\n\nTADAO CHINO\n     President\n\n\f31\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber\n\n             Title\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\n1, 2\n\n2, 4\n\n2, 6\n\n5, 13\n\n8, 24\n\n10, 31\n\n10, 32\n\n11, 34\n\n15, 53\n\n19, 67\n\n19, 71\n\n22, 80\n\n23, 87\n\n26, 95\n\n32\n\n36\n\n37\n\n42\n\n46\n\n48\n\n50\n\n51\n\n54\n\n59\n\n60\n\n61\n\n67\n\n68\n\n72\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nProject Framework\n\nSector Institutions\n\nUrban Centers in North-West Frontier Province\n\nExisting Infrastructure and Services in Urban Towns\n\nUrban Sector Policy Action\n\nUrban Sector Public Investment Need\n\nExternal Assistance to the Urban Sector\n\nLessons Learned\n\nSummary Description of Prepared Subprojects\n\nFinancing Arrangements\n\nProject Organization Chart\n\nOutline Terms of Reference for Consulting Services\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses of Typical Subprojects\n\nSupplementary Appendixes\n(available on request)\n\nExisting Socioeconomic Characteristics in Urban Towns\n\nDesign Standards and Levels of Service\n\nDetailed Project Costs\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nSummary Initial Environmental Examination\n\nFinancial Projections of Municipal Communities\n\nSocial Aspects and Affordability\n\n27, 101\n\n\f32\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nTargets\n\nMonitorable Mechanisms\n\nRisks/Assumptions\n\nDesign\n1.

Roles  and\nresponsibilities are complex and frequently overlapping. \n\n2.\nIn the smaller towns in North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), the crucial shortcoming of\nprovincial and local governments is the failure to prepare and be guided by any form of plans.\nAny development plan is subject to cancellation or amendment with a new administration. The\nconcept of structure plans, reflecting national and local urban policies and acting as a guide for\nmedium-term urban development and investment plans, is unknown, not recognized in current\nlegislation, and generally not understood. Development control is effectively absent, making the\nenforcement of any policies and programmes impossible.\n\nB.\n\nLegal Framework\n\n1.\n\nRelevant Legislation \n\n3.\nNWFP  Urban  Planning  Ordinance  1978. The  ordinance  prescribes  the  establishment\nof  a  provincial  urban  development  board  (PUDB),  within  the  Physical  Planning  and  Housing\nDepartment (PPHD), to give, formulate, and amend long-, medium-, and short-term policies for\ndevelopment  of  NWFP  urban  areas  (so-called  development  policies).  PUDB  is  empowered  to\nestablish  local  area  authorities  (LAAs),  to  undertake  detailed  planning  and  implementation,\nincluding  fundamental  tasks  of  land-use  planning,  development  control,  and  building  control.\nPUDB  is  financed  by  annual  development  grants  from  the  provincial  government,  loans  from\nfinancial  institutions,  and  profits  from  development  activities.  The  ordinance  permits  any\nplanning  agency  (PDD,  PUDB,  LAAs,  division,  district,  or  urban  area)  to  adopt  land\ndevelopment regulations.\n\n4.\nNWFP  Local  Government  Ordinance  1979.  The  ordinance  describes  the  duties  and\nresponsibilities of local councils (LCs) and includes broad provisions for municipal committees\nto  produce  master  plans  and  other  development  regulations  for  their  urban  areas,  as  well  as\nbuilding regulations. The ordinance provides for LCs to prepare development plans for selected\nschemes. No specific mention is made of zoning as a means of land-use planning and control,\nbut  the  ordinance  does  assign  the  responsibility  for  the  development,  expansion,  and\nimprovement of an area within the municipality. \n\n5.\nPUDB  Land  Development  Regulations,  1980.  The  regulations  define  matters  to  be\nprovided  within  urban  development  planning  schemes  (UDPS)  and  the  type  of  UDPS.  The\nregulations include detailed procedures for preparing schemes, and allows PUDB and LAAs to\nmake zonal plans showing the purpose for which any areas can be primarily used.\n\nLocal  Council  (Budget)  Rules  (1980).  The  rules  prescribe  budget  procedures  and\n\n6.\nfinancial organisation to be adopted by all councils.\n\n7.\nNational Reference Manual for Planning and Infrastructure Standards (1986).  The\nmanual, produced for the then Ministry of Housing and Works, Environment and Urban Affairs\nDivision, defines standards and targets for the provision of a wide range of (urban) services.\n\n8.\n\nEighth Five Year Plan (1993\u20131998). The plan provides targets relevant for urban areas\n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 3, page 2\n\nincluding (i) access to clean water for all; (ii) access to sewerage facilities to all urban areas; (iii)\nincrease in tertiary roads; (iv) provision of town development schemes. A national urbanization\npolicy followed by provincial urbanization policies and a framework for regional development of\nnew towns will be formulated with policy implementation during the plan period. \n\nThe Ninth Five-Year Plan (1998\u20132003). Not yet published, an early draft gives priority\n9.\nto effective and increased involvement of local bodies in planning, developing and maintaining\nwater supply and sanitation programs.\n\n2.\n\nProcedures\n\nThe  current  sequence  of  procedures  governing  the  planning  and  implementation  of\n\n10.\ndevelopment projects within urban areas can be outlined as follows:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\ndirective  is  issued  by  the  provincial  government  (PDD,  CM),  through  the  chief\nsecretary, to the respective line department;\nor  an  alternative  until  recently:  proposals  for  investment  into  development\nprojects as generated by members of national or provincial assembly (no longer\nactive);\nthe line departments prioritize the proposals;\nline  department  prepares  project,  prepares  PC-I  or  PC-II  for  submission  to  the\nprovincial government (PDD); and\nPC-I sent to PDD for review and concept clearance, and to PDWP for approval\n\nC.\n\nInstitutional Framework\n\n1.\n\nProvincial Government Departments\n\n11.\nNWFP is divided into seven divisions, each headed by a commissioner. Each division is\ndivided into 24 districts, controlled by deputy commissioner. Each district is divided into tehsils,\npresently  controlled  by  an  assistant  commissioner.  Within  the  district,  certain  areas  are\ndesignated  as  urban  areas,  administered  by  a  town  council  (either  a  municipal  corporation\n(Peshawar),  municipal  committees,  or  town  committees).  Under  the  Local  Government\nOrdinance,  promulgated  in  August  2001,  the  organization  of  local  government  has  been\nrestructured  into  three  levels:  district,  tehsil,  and  union,  with  devolution  of  power  to  local  level\ngovernments,  and  the  creation  of  district  assemblies.  The  plan  integrates  the  rural  with  the\nurban  local  governments,  into  one  coherent  structure,  in  which  the  district  administration  is\nanswerable  to  an  elected  chief  executive  of  the  district.  Citizen  monitoring  by  elected\nrepresentatives,  the  civil  society\u2019s  involvement  with  development,  and  a  system  of  effective\nchecks and balances, completes the hard core of the political structure and system of the local\ngovernment.\n\n12.\nThe NWFP government (headed by the chief minister and the chief secretary) includes\nseveral  departments  (each  headed  by  a  secretary)  involved  with  the  development  of  urban\nareas.  A  summary  of  the  functions  and  responsibilities  of  the  main  departments  follows.    In\naddition, several derived agencies and boards reporting to the main urban planning department,\nthe  PPHD,  play  important  roles  in  implementing  development  programs,  particularly  those\nsupported by international funding.\n\n13.\nPlanning  and  Development  Department.  Headed  by  an  additional  chief  secretary,\nPDD  has  overall  responsibility  for  planning  and  development  of  all  sectors  in  the  province,\n\n\f39\n\nAppendix 3, page 3\n\nincluding policy and procedures. It has a key role, through its coordination function, in preparing\nand  reviewing  annual  budgets  of  the  provincial  annual  development  program  (ADP).  PDD\nreviews  development \nline  departments,  and  prepares\nrecommendation  to  the  NWFP  government,  as  part  of  the  plan  approval  procedures.  Most\nissues relevant to urban development fall under PPHD additional secretary and the respective\nchief. \n\ninvestment  proposals \n\nfrom  all \n\n14.\nProvincial  Development  Working  Party  (PDWP).  Headed  by  an  additional  chief\nsecretary  (development),  the  PDWP  includes  secretaries  of  provincial  departments  involved\nwith  development  as  members.  The  party  is  responsible  for  reviewing  project  proposals  for\ninclusion in annual plan and five-year plans. It has authority to approve provincial schemes up\nto  PRs100  million  per  scheme.  Projects  above  this  value  need  to  be  approved  at  the  federal\nlevel, by the Central Development Working Party (CDWP).\n\n15.\nLocal  Government,  Elections,  and  Rural  Development  Department  (LGERD).\nLGERD  is  mandated  to  administer  the  NWFP  Local  Government  Ordinance  (1980).  Its  Local\nCouncil Board manages activities relevant to local councils and reports directly to the secretary,\nLGERD.\n\n16.\nPhysical Planning and Housing Department.  PPHD has primary responsibility for the\nplanning  and  implementation  of  physical  infrastructure,  by  implementing  the  NWFP  Urban\nPlanning Ordinance. PPHD is responsible for land-use planning, guiding and controlling urban\ngrowth  and  development,  and  planning  and  implementing  projects  related  to  civic  facilities.\nPPHD  is  also  responsible  for  area  development  schemes,  new  townships,  improvement  of\nslums, utilities and urban services, and rehabilitation of public and private housing. \n\n17.\nProvincial  Urban  Development  Board.  PUDB  is  a  semiautonomous  body,  with  the\nsecretary, PPHD as its managing director. PUDB is entrusted with the formulation of policies for\ndeveloping  urban  areas  and  securing  compliance  by  government  departments  and  agencies.\nPUDB  has  delegated  part  of  its  powers  on  urban  development  to  6-7  urban  development\nauthorities  (those  of  Dera  Ismail  Khan,  Hazara,  Kohat,  Malakand,  Mardan,  and  Peshawar).  In\naddition,  it  includes  the  project  management  unit,  established  to  implement  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank-supported Second Urban Development Project.\n\n18.\nDevelopment Authorities (DAs).  Under the legislative framework of the NWFP Urban\nPlanning  Ordinance  1980,  PUDB  established  local  development  authorities  (for  Dera  Ismail\nKhan,  Hazara,  Kohat,  Malakand,  Mardan,  and  Peshawar)  to  undertake  detailed  planning  and\nimplementation of development plans within a designated area. In practice, the DAs have been\nprimarily  involved  in  providing  serviced  land  for  residential,  commercial,  or  industrial\ndevelopment.    Infrastructure  within  such  schemes  is  to  be  provided  by  the  DAs,  and\nsubsequently  handed  over  to  local  councils.  However,  frequently  councils  are  reluctant  to\naccept responsibility for such maintenance, as no revenue is linked with the greater operational\nresponsibility. DAs in NWFP seem to have all but abandoned their infrastructure development\nrole.\n\nProject  Management  Unit  (PMU).    Established  to  implement  the  Second  Urban\n19.\nDevelopment  Project  (SUDP)  and  headed  by  a  director  general.  The  PMU  was  made  the\ncounterpart  agency  of  other  urban  development  initiatives,  in  particular  of  the  Community\nInfrastructure  Project  (CIP)  (supported  by  World  Bank,  Swiss  Agency  for  Development\nCooperation, and United Nations Children's Fund, as a spin-off of the Shelter for Low Income\nCommunities Project,  originally under the National Housing Authority (NHA). The PMU is now\ndivided into two units, for the SUDP and for CIP.\n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 3, page 4\n\n20.\nPublic  Health  Engineering  Department  (PHED).  PHED  is  responsible  for  the\ndevelopment of water supply systems in urban and rural areas.  Once completed, urban water\nsupply schemes are usually handed over to the municipal committees (MCs) for operation and\nmaintenance. PHED prescribes water tariffs. Currently, PHED in collaboration with Kreditanstalt\nf\u00fcr Wiederaufbau is experimenting with installing water meters in selected (small) towns (Baffa,\nKulachi, Lachi, Nawan Killi, Nawan Shaher, Thal, and 11 villages). Setting metered water rates\nis the responsibility of the local council managing the system.\n\n21.\nCommunication  and  Works  Department  (CWD).  CWD's  main  relevance  for  urban\ninfrastructure and services is its mandate to construct, repair, operate, and maintain provincial\nroads  (and  associated  roadside  drains),  bridges,  and  tunnels  in  the  province.  It  is  often\ncontracted  by  the  National  Highways  Authority  (NHA)  to  maintain  sections  of  the  national\nhighway network. Urban roads are the responsibility of local councils, although this may also be\nsubcontracted to CWD for practical purposes. \n\n22. Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA). This is a national institution, with\nprovincial  delegations,  with  a  board  responsible  for  the  provincial  area.  In  addition  to  its\nresponsibilities  in  managing  national  water  resources,  WAPDA  generates,  transmits,  and\ndistributes electric power to households. WAPDA is responsible for reading meters and billing\nconsumers.\n\nSui  Northern  Gas  Pakistan  Ltd.    This  company  is  responsible  for  transmission  and\n23.\ndistribution  of  natural  gas  to  householders;  an  increasing  number  of  NWFP  towns  are  getting\nconnected with individual metered gas connections.\n\nCantonment Board.  Part of the Pakistan Army, a cantonment board is responsible for\n24.\nplanning,  developing,  and  maintaining  urban  infrastructure,  services,  and  civic  amenities  such\nas health and schools. Currently, there are nine boards in NWFP. A cantonment board can be\nopened or closed according to the defence needs of the country. \n\n2.\n\nUrban Local Government\n\n25.\nUrban local government in Pakistan was provided by local councils administered by the\nLocal  Council  Board  (LCB)  within  LGERD.  Local  councils  include  the  Peshawar  Municipal\nCorporation, 29 MCs, and 16 town committees. All project towns are classed as MCs. MCs are\nclassified in categories, depending on the level of revenue1 (Class A: >PRs15 million; Class B:\nbetween  PRs5  million  and  PRs15  million)  and  Class  C  (<  PRs5  million).  No  direct  correlation\nexists  between  these  categories  and  the  size  of  the  urban  population.  Staffing  levels  as\nassigned by LCB are a function of category, not of urban population. \n\n26.\nThe MCs have a range of mandated functions, compulsory and optional. In addition to\nthe  provision  of  basic  urban  services  and  infrastructure,  the  MCs  are  also  responsible  for\ndrawing up master plans and site development plans, and a form of building control. MCs are,\nwith  some  exceptions,  short  of  skilled  staff,  and  do  not  have  adequate  local  revenue.\nMaintenance  of  urban  infrastructure  is  given  low  priority.  Urban  populations  have  little\nconfidence in local government, and are reluctant to pay existing taxes and charges. \n\n27.\nElections for local councils were suspended in 1996, and towns have been administered\nby  an  administrator,  appointed  by  the  secretary,  LGERD.  The  administrator  is  supported  by\nofficers heading four main departments. The main MC departments relevant to urban services\n\n                                                          \n1 Definition of revenues categories before the abolition of octroi.\n\n\f41\n\nAppendix 3, page 5\n\nand  infrastructure  are  (i)  health  department:  responsible  for  sanitation  (primarily  solid  waste\nmanagement  (on  average  78  percent  of  budget  in  project  towns),  drainage  (21  percent),  and\nvaccination (<1 percent)); (ii) water supply department: responsible for water supply, firefighting,\nand  street  watering;  (iii)  building  and  works  department:  responsible  for  roads,  general\nmunicipal works, building control, gardens, roadsides, and street lighting. Table A3 provides an\noverview  of  the  allocation  of  responsibilities  in  urban  planning  and  management  for  various\nsectors.  With  the  promulgation  of  the  Local  Government  Ordinance  in  August  2001,  the\nadministrative  system  is  being  changed,  with  the  replacement  of  the  administrator  by  a  duly\nelected council representing all segments of the community. However, the existing infrastructure\nand  service  delivery  departments  will  remain,  with  changes  only  in  their  laws,  rules,  and\nregulations.\n\nTable A3: Allocation of Urban Planning and Management Responsibility\n\nSector\n\nPlanning & Design\n\nImplementation /\nenforcement\nPPHD\n\nOperation &\nmaintenance\nNot applicable\n\nPreparation of\nstructure plans\nDevelopment control\nLand management\nWater supply\n\nPPHD;\nthrough LAAs\nPPHD\nPPHD\nPHED\n\nDrainage\n\nMC \u2013 Health\nDepartment\nSewerage / sanitation MC \u2013 Health\nDepartment\nMC \u2013 Health\nDepartment\n\nSolid waste\nmanagement\nRoads & access:\n    National\n    Local\n\nNHA\nMC \u2013 Building &\nWorks Department\nWAPDA\nSNGPL\nMC\n\nPPHD\nPPHD\nPHED\n\nMC \u2013 Health\nDepartment\nMC \u2013 Health\nDepartment\nMC \u2013 Health\nDepartment\n\nNHA / CWD\nMC\n\nNot applicable\nNot applicable\nMC \u2013 Water supply\ndepartment\nMC \u2013 Health\nDepartment\nMC \u2013 Health\nDepartment\nMC \u2013 Health\nDepartment\n\nCWD\nMC\n\nElectricity\nGas\nFire\nCWD  =  Communication  and  Works  Department,  LAA  =  local  area  authorities,  MC  =  municipal  committees,  NHA  =\nNational  Highways  Authority,  PHED  =  Public  Health  Engineering  Department,  PPHD  =  Physical  Planning  and\nHousing Department, SNGPL = Sui Northern Gas Pakistan Ltd., WAPDA = Water and Power Development Authority.\n\nWAPDA\nSNGPL\nMC\n\nWAPDA\nSNGPL\nMC\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 4, page 1\n\nEXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES IN URBAN TOWN\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.\nInformation  about  the  quality  and  extent  of  the  existing  infrastructure  and  services  in\nurban areas in North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), and the seven phase 1 towns (the project\ntowns) in particular, is mainly drawn from Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance\n(TA),  namely  Urban  Infrastructure  Needs  Assessment,1  and  NWFP  Urban  Development\nProject.2  These  studies  concerned  larger  towns,  thus  the  quality  of  service  in  the  remaining\n(smaller, more remote) towns in NWFP will be less than described in this section. Responsibility\nfor  the  installation  or  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  infrastructure  covers  a\nnumber of provincial and local government agencies, as well as individual households. Table A4\nprovides  a  summary  of  quantitative  data  on  the  provision  of  infrastructure  and  services  in  the\nseven first-phase project towns.\n\nB.\n\nInfrastructure Sectors\n\n1.\n\nWater Supply\n\n2.\nThe  provision  of  piped  water  supply  in  the  project  towns  at  present  ranges  from  25-83\npercent of urban households. Takht Bhai and Swabi have only 8 percent coverage, due to the\nnoncommissioning  of  existing  Public  Health  and  Engineering  Department  (PHED)  schemes.\nThe figures hide a wide range of quality differences, with hours of service per day as low as 1-3\nhours. Community taps (standpipes) are not common in NWFP, with a maximum of 6 percent\n(Charsadda,  Mansehra)  of  the  population  dependent  on  such  taps  as  their  main  source  of\nwater.\n\n3.\nPHED is usually responsible for the major part of the design and construction of water\nsupply schemes, from source development, treatment, transmission, storage, and primary and\nsecondary distribution. Tertiary distribution and house connections are the responsibility of the\nlocal  council.  Upon  completion,  the  scheme  is  handed  over  to  the  local  councils  for  operation\nand  maintenance.  Billing  is  also  the  responsibility  of  local  councils,  although  at  rates  set  by\nPHED. Water meters have not yet been introduced in the project towns, but a Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr\nWiederaufbau supported program of meter installation is under way elsewhere in urban NWFP.\nScheme  designs  usually  follow  a  standard  design,  without  a  great  deal  of  site-specific  detail.\nCapacity of tubewells, reservoirs, and transmission mains follows standard designs.\n\nThe fundamental problem with most piped water supply schemes is the high incidence\n4.\nof  leakage  (from  the  distribution  system),  wastage  (water  wasted  from  house  connections\nthrough  faulty  fittings,  continuously  open  taps,  and  overflowing  house  reservoirs),  and  illegal\nconnections,  leading  to  low  system  pressures  and  low  water  quality.  Hours  of  operation  are\noften  severely  limited  (down  to  two  or  three  hours  per  day),  sometimes  to  reduce  the  high\nelectricity  costs  of  running  tubewells.  Discontinuous  supply  not  only  leads  to  low  system\npressure  and  thereby  allowing  entry  of  polluted  water  into  the  system,  but  also  encourages\nconsumers  to  leave  their  taps  open  for  when  the  water  returns,  leading  to  high  wastage.\nAlternative  supply  to  the  piped  supply  usually  consists  of  wells,  for  as  much  as  70  percent  of\nhouseholds.  Most  wells  are  open  shallow  wells,  with  water  drawn  using  buckets.  Only\nCharsadda has a significant (20 percent) portion of the population using wells with handpumps.\n\n                                                          \n1 TA 1249-PAK: Urban Infrastructure Needs Assessment, for $600,000, approved on 19 December 1989.\n2 TA 2940-PAK: North-West Frontier Urban Development Project, for $950,000, approved on 12 December 1997.\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\n2.\n\nStorm-Water Drainage\n\n5.\nThe central problem of the degradation of the living environment in all towns is related to\nthe  condition of the  secondary and tertiary drainage system, which invariably also function  for\ncarrying  fecal  waste.  All  storm-water  drains  are  contaminated  with  wastewater  and  are\neffectively open sewers.  Surveys (1993) show that the majority of drains in the project towns\nare lined, with roughly 25 percent in good condition, the remainder in average or poor condition.\nEven  lined  drains  may  not  function  adequately  as  they  are  seldom  part  of  an  interconnected\nnetwork,  with  adequate  slope  and  profile.  Maintenance  of  the  drainage  network  is  the  MC's\nresponsibility. Performance on drainage maintenance varies, but is generally poor.\n\n3.\n\nSewerage and Sanitation\n\nNone  of  the  project  towns  have  piped  sewerage.  The  majority  of  households  are\n6.\nreported to have a septic tank, although the definition of a septic tank and simple cesspit with or\nwithout  a  soakpit  is  not  clear.  Survey  data  are  therefore  not  consistent.  Septic  tanks  in  town\ncenters are old and not designed to present standards, i.e., with two or three chambers. None of\nthe local councils in any of the towns offer a septic tank desludging service. Thus, septic tanks\ndo not offer any form of treatment and the effluent quality is little better than that of raw sewage.\nA  significant  percentage  of  households  (as  high  as  75  percent  in  some  towns)  still  practice\nunacceptable human waste disposal methods (open air, bucket latrine, drain).\n\n4.\n\nSolid Waste\n\n7.\nCoverage for the collection and disposal of domestic and commercial solid waste in the\nproject towns ranges from 2-50 percent, typical coverage is around 25 percent. Collection can\nbe  from  individual  households  or  from  strategic  locations  such  as  neighborhood  collection\npoints. These figures do not provide an indication of the adequacy of the disposal methods of\nthe  waste.  Final  disposal  is  generally  as  simple  as  dumping  in  low-lying  areas,  without\nsubsequent compaction or coverage. A major problem is the reluctance of the population to pay\ncharges for solid waste management services, which therefore remains seriously underfunded.\nThe  volume  of  domestic  waste  generated  is  still  relatively  low,  as  a  result  of  limited  cash\neconomy  in  the  smaller  towns  of  NWFP.  No  specialized  services  exist  for  the  disposal  or\ntreatment of special waste such as hospital waste.\n\n5.\n\nRoads\n\nMajor  roads  (national  and  provincial  network)  are  maintained  by  Communication  and\n8.\nWorks Department; the national roads by National Highways Authority. These are generally in\ngood  condition,  with  widths  of  7  meters.  Local  roads  and  access  roads  in  urban  areas,  and\nassociated roadside drains, are the responsibility of the local council. The network is generally\nadequate in coverage, but poor in terms of road pavement quality and maintenance condition.\nMany  roads  are  still  unpaved,  without  adequate  drainage,  with  wastewater  over  the  road\nsurface. In old town centers, access is often via narrow lanes, not suitable for vehicular access.\n\nTraffic  problems  exist  in  most  town  centers,  largely  the  result  of  encroachment  of\n9.\ncommercial activities and uncontrolled parking. Another aspect of traffic is the wide disparity in\nvehicle speed and acceleration, with the still widespread use of human or animal traction.\n\n\fTable A4: Existing Infrastructure - Quantitative Data\n\nUnit\n\nCharsadda\n\nHangu\n\nHaripur\n\nMansehra\n\nSwabi\n\nTakht Bhai\n\nTimagara\n\nItem\n\n1.

In general, portfolio performance has been constrained by a number\nof generic macro and micro issues, including (i) legal and administrative issues relating\nto processing procedures and requirements, (ii) coordination and procedural issues, and\n(iii)  counterpart  fund  constraints  and  timely  release.  These  issues  resulted  in\nimplementation  delays,  with  often  negative  financial  and  economic  consequences,  as\nwell as noncompliance with specific covenants, delays in consultant recruitment, minimal\nbeneficiary  participation,  poor  operation  and  maintenance  of  completed  facilities,  and\nlimited institutional capacity. The following information provides specific lessons learned\non Pakistan urban projects.\n\n1.\n\nKarachi Urban Development Project\n\nUrban  upgrading  is  complex  in  nature;  a  piecemeal  approach  to  a  few  selected\n2.\nproblems  is  not  an  optimal  solution.  Urban  upgrading  should  be  designed  from  a  plan\nthat  integrates  all  aspects  of  urban  infrastructure,  and  involves  the  participation  of  the\nultimate  beneficiaries:  The  institutional  capacity  to  implement  the  project  must  be\npresent, and the financial framework must be in place to ensure long-term sustainability\nof the upgrading. The absence of any one of these elements will eliminate any chance\nfor project success.\n\n3.\nThe  implementation  schedule  of  integrated  urban  development  projects  in\nmegacities like Karachi should be realistic and provide adequate time allowance for staff\ntraining  for  new  executing  agencies,  as  well  as  for  stoppages  from  unforeseen\nexigencies as peace and security problems.\n\n4.\nWhen a major outstanding problem is identified at appraisal, its resolution should\nbe a precondition for loan negotiations or at least for Board consideration.  Otherwise, it\ncould \ninevitably  delays  project\nimplementation.\n\nto  suspension  of  contract  awards,  which \n\nlead \n\nThe  upgrading  of  sewerage  treatment  capacity  needs  to  be  synchronized  with\n5.\ninflow of sewage available for treatment. Future financing of sewerage treatment plants\nshould ensure that properly connected sewers deliver an adequate level of sewage for\ntreatment upon completion.\n\n6.\nThe main weakness of Karachi Urban Development Project was its design. This\nwas a direct result of the absence of project preparatory technical assistance (TA) early\nin  the  design  stage  of  this  complex  undertaking.  A  TA  would  have  identified  the\ninstitutional shortcomings of the executing agencies, provided estimates of willingness\nto  pay  of  katchi  abadi  residents  for  leases,  and  provided  appropriate  designs  for  the\nphysical  components  of  the  project.  Moreover,  the  results  of  such  a  TA  would  have\n\n                                                          \n1 Loan  793-PAK(SF):   Karachi Urban Development Project,  for  $55.2  million,  approved  on  14  October\n1986; Loan 1001-PAK(SF) and 1002-PAK: Karachi Sewerage Project, for $85.0 million, approved on 14\nDecember  1989;  and  Loan  1004-PAK(SF):  Second  Urban  Development  Project,  for  $66.0  million,\napproved on 14 December 1989.\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 8, page 2\n\nbeen available for discussion with the beneficiaries and other project stakeholders, thus\nincreasing project ownership during the design stage and the chances of its success.\n\n7.\nIn December 1999, ADB conducted a project performance and audit report and\nconcluded  that  the  project  was  unsuccessful.  The  project  did  not  meet  its  original\nobjectives.  The  main  identified  weakness  was  in  Project  design.  In  addition,  the  long\nimplementation  delays  resulted  from  some  major  issues  that  should  have  been\nresolved prior to implementation, especially the financial solvency of the implementing\nagencies, which ultimately impacted on the sustainability of the project components.\n\nto  be  strengthened,  particularly \n\nADB's  project  administration  needs \n\n8.\nfor\nmonitoring  financial  and  institutional  aspects  of  a  project.  Loan  covenants  must  be\nclosely monitored and enforced during implementation. Financial covenants need to be\nmore  precise  in  their  intentions.  Weak  and  vague  covenants  tend  to  not  be  complied\nwith,  resulting  in  little  institutional  reform.  Moreover,  financial  covenants  should  be\nbased  on  a  firm  economic  rationale.  In  the  case  of  cost  recovery,  a  clear  relationship\nshould exist between the beneficiary of a service and the ultimate payer for the service.\nThis is not the case for solid waste disposal and sewage services. Because of the large\npositive  externalities  generated  by  these  services,  consideration  should  be  given  to\nfinancing these services out of general revenues.\n\n2.\n\nKarachi Sewerage Project\n\n9.\nThe  appraisal  cost  estimates  for  the  Karachi  Sewerage  Project  were  based  on\npreliminary  designs  and  the  Sindh  government\u2019s  standard  unit  rates,  which  led  to  cost\nescalation  at  tendering.  This  factor  combined  with  the  withholding  of  contract  awards\nand nonavailability of part of the land for the Mauripur sewerage treatment plant led to a\nneed  to  reformulate  the  plant  layout  and  downsize  the  project.  This  experience\nunderlines  the  need  to  complete  detailed  design,  use  a  reliable  cost  base,  and  obtain\npossession of key project sites before loan approval.\n\n10. When  reformulation  leads  to  significant  scope  reduction  of  a  project,  then  the\ndimensions  and  the  expected  benefit  stream  of  the  revised  project  should  be  clearly\nindicated.  Absence of relevant information leads to difficulties in evaluating completion\nand measuring benefits.\n\nBeneficiary participation was limited during project implementation as it was not\n11.\nenvisaged  at  appraisal.  This  has  led  to  some  dissatisfaction  among  residents  in  one\nlocality  served  by  the  project.  The  Karachi  Water  and  Sewerage  Board  (KWSB)  now\nrecognizes  the  importance  of  beneficiary  involvement  and  has  made  serious  efforts  to\naccommodate beneficiary concerns in the Korangi Wastewater Management Project.\n\n12.\nGiven  the  continued  need  for  large  investments  to  meet  growing  demands  for\nwater  and  sewerage  services  in  Karachi,  KWSB  has  recognized  the  need  for  private\nsector participation in its activities. However, the process is tied up in a legal stalemate.\nKWSB needs to seek innovative solutions to this stalemate.\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 8, page 3\n\n3. \n\nSecond Urban Development Project\n\n13. While this loan was closed on 31 December 1999, no project completion report\nhas been completed, and no formal assessment of project performance and associated\nproblems and issues relating to its implementation. However, a number of issues can be\nreadily  identified  from  the  project:  (i)  delays  in  land  acquisition,  (ii)  minimal  community\ninvolvement in the project, (iii) lack of ownership by the municipal and town committees\nin the project towns, (iv) limited financial contribution by the towns, (v) lack of counterpart\nbudget and untimely release, (vi) delay in consultant recruitment, (vii) frequent turnover\nof  senior  staff  of  the  Project  Management  Unit,  particularly  at  the  position  of  director\ngeneral, and (vii) limited implementation of institutional reforms. While the Project can be\nconsidered  a  success  in  so  far  as  it  implemented  significant  capital  works  subprojects,\nconcern  is  noted  at  the  capacity  of  the  Project  towns  in  operating  and  maintaining  the\nassets,  due  to  lack  of  budget  and  limited  institutional  capacity,  as  well  as  the  financial\ncapacity  of  the  Project  towns  to  meet  their  debt  service  obligations  under  the  various\nsubsidiary  loan  agreements.  The  design  of  the  Project  could  be  considered  over\nambitious considering the financial capacities of the participating towns.\n\nB. \n\nIncorporating Lessons Learned to Project Design\n\n14.\nThe  lessons  from  the  experience  of  the  previous  urban  projects  undertaken  in\nPakistan have been incorporated into the project design to minimize recurrence of past\nproblems and issues. Particular emphasis has been given to assessing the financial and\ninstitutional capacities of the towns that are likely to participate in the Project. In addition,\nthe  proposed  subprojects  will  be  small  and  use  least-cost  design  solutions.  The\nmaximum amount of any subproject will be PRs50 million. Community participation will\nbe  a  focus.  Without  the  participation  of  community-based  organizations  throughout  the\nInstitutional\nwhole  project  cycle, \nstrengthening of the local government units, where the Project will be implemented, has\nbeen  given  priority,  particularly  to  financial  management  and  resource  mobilization.\nOwnership at the local government level must be a focal point of any urban project, and\nthis  aspect  has  been  carefully  incorporated  into  the  project  design.  The  participating\ntowns  will  be  required  to  nominated  a  core  group  of  staff  to  be  involved  in  project\nimplementation, with this core group forming the basis for a permanent urban unit within\nthe  respective  municipal  committee.    In  addition,  an  equity  share  of  a  minimum  of  20\npercent for each subproject, and up to a maximum of 50 percent, depending on the MCs\nfinancial capability, will be required from each participating town. The Project will support\nthe Government\u2019s devolution initiatives and poverty reduction programs.\n\nlong-term  sustainability  will  be \n\njeopardized. \n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 9, page 1\n\nSUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF PREPARED SUBPROJECTS\nFOR THE URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT COMPONENT\n\n1.\nThe urban infrastructure component consists of town-specific investment in one or more\ninfrastructure  subprojects.  The  infrastructure  subprojects  include  five  different  categories.\nSubproject appraisal studies were conducted for priority projects in the phase 1 project towns:\nCharsadda,  Hangu,  Haripur,  Mansehra,  Swabi,  Takht  Bhai,  and  Timargara.  Details  of  these\nsubprojects  are  summarized  in  Table  A9.  Details  of  some  of  those  subprojects  have  been\nrevised to reflect the commitment to basic needs and poverty reduction type subprojects, and to\nmatch both financial and institutional capabilities. \n\nA.\n\nWater Supply Subprojects\n\n2.\nWhile  statistics  on  percentage  of  the  population  connected  to  piped  water  supply\nsystems in North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) towns may seem high, the performance of the\nschemes  is  often  poor,  with  the  main  deficiencies  including  high  leakage,  low  pressure,  many\nillegal  connections,  and  very  limited  hours  of  service.  Strategies  are  aimed  at  reducing  the\nincidence  of  unaccounted  for  water  and  illegal  connections.  Subprojects  will  be  designed  to\nimprove the quality of the service provided by existing schemes, and simultaneously increasing\nrevenues  through  a  combination  of  leak-detection  programs  and  the  conversion  of  illegal\nconnections to registered accounts. These measures should improve system pressures and the\nquality of the water as supplied. Where necessary, distribution systems will be extended to or\nimproved for poorly served areas. Priority will be given to servicing low-income areas. \n\nConsideration  will  be  given  to  installing  water  meters  in  towns  that  have  achieved  a\n3.\nsecure  24-hour  supply  system,  and  that  can  demonstrate  the  technical  and  management\ndiscipline  required  to  run  a  meter-based  billing  system.  Lessons  will  be  learned  from  the\nexperience gained on the KfW-supported program of installing water meters now under way in\nBaffa, Kulachi, Lachi, Nawan Killi, Nawan Shaher, Thal, and 11 villages.\n\nB.\n\nSewerage and Sanitation Subprojects\n\nThe  construction  of  full  piped  sewerage  schemes  with  treatment  is  unlikely  to  be\n4.\naffordable  or  manageable  in  project  areas.  Targets  are  therefore  aimed  at  improving  the\ndisposal  of  human  waste  by  increasing  the  use  of  small  sewerage  schemes  with  local\ntreatment, encouraging the installation of adequately designed individual and communal septic\ntanks,  and  improving  the  maintenance  of  these  tanks  by  introducing  septic  tank  maintenance\nservices. Whether this service will be operated by the municipal committee (MC) or contracted\nout  to  a  private  operator  will  depend  on  the  capacity  of  the  respective  MC,  and  realistic\nprojections on the potential revenue resulting from service charges. The drainage component,\nas  described  in  the  following  section,  will  also  contribute  to  improving  sanitary  conditions  as\nmost storm-water drains are currently contaminated with human waste.\n\nC.\n\nDrainage Subprojects\n\n5.\nThe central problem of the degradation of the living environment in all towns is related to\nthe condition of the secondary and tertiary drainage systems, which invariably also carry fecal\nwaste.  Improvement  subprojects  are  aimed  at  routine  cleaning  and  rehabilitating  existing\nsystems,  with  particular  emphasis  on  interconnecting  isolated  stretches  of  drainage  channels\ninto  a  full  network.  Priority  areas  will  be  high-density,  low-income  areas,  where  interventions\nshould result in marked improvement of living conditions. Investments in new works will focus\non  establishing  drainage  networks  including  suitable  outfalls.  Drainage  subprojects  will  all\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\ninclude  setting  up  maintenance  procedures  and  systems,  where  necessary  supported  by  the\nprovision of (manual) equipment for channel clearing.\n\nD.\n\nSolid Waste Management Subprojects\n\nThe  collection  and  disposal  of  solid  waste  is  recognized  as  one  of  the  first\n6.\nresponsibilities of fledgling local authorities. However, current reluctance of the urban population\nin small towns in NWFP to pay all but minimal charges for a municipal waste collection service\nmeans  that  system  improvements  must  be  low  cost.  Waste  volumes  generated  are  relatively\nlow because of limited cash economies in up-country NWFP. Therefore, subprojects are aimed\nat minimal investment for collection systems, thereby requiring community support to minimize\nwaste  and  concentrate  waste  at  neighborhood  collection  points.  Emphasis  will  be  placed  on\nincreasing the cash contribution from commercial establishments, especially from wet markets.\nCollection  equipment  will  be  chosen  to  be  affordable,  maintainable,  and  appropriate  to  the\nparticular  urban  environment.  Disposal  management  will  include  equipment  and  operation\nsystems to compact and cover waste.\n\nE.\n\nRoads and Local Access Subprojects\n\n7.\nSubprojects in the road sector will seek to rehabilitate and improve the main urban road\nnetwork by resurfacing and widening within the existing right-of-way. Improved access to town\ncenters, and in particular to local neighborhoods, will enhance accessibility for all members of\nthe  community  as  well  as  increase  economic  opportunities  by  attracting  investment.  Road\nsubprojects  include  improving  associated  roadside  drains.  Part  of  the  subproject  will  involve\ntraffic  management  measures  to  improve  circulation  in  congested  town-center  areas,  through\njunction  improvement  and  introducing  restrictions  on  parking  and  roadside  vending.  Other\nsubprojects will include the extension of the existing road network system to low income areas,\nwhere present access is virtually nonexistent.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 9, page 3\n\nTable A9: Summary of Subprojects Prepared for Phase 1 Project Towns\n\nName/Subproject\n\nPresent Condition\n\nRationale\n\nScope\n\nCharsadda\nSolid Waste\nManagement\n\n\u2022  Only 12-16 percent of\nwaste collected\n\n\u2022  Most waste of\n\n\u2022 \n\ndomestic nature\nInadequate collection\nand disposal\nequipment\n\n\u2022  Uncontrolled dumping\n\nSubproject should\nincrease the fraction of\ndomestic and commercial\nwaste collected from the\nurban area, and dispose of\nit in a more\nenvironmentally\nacceptable manner at\nimproved landfill site\n\nSwabi\nRoad Improvement\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nImprovement to main\nurban road networks\nImproved traffic\nmanagement\n\n\u2022  Three provincial\n\nroads functioning as\narterial roads to\nSwabi town center\n\u2022  Mixture of fast and\n\nslow-moving vehicles\n\n\u2022  All commercial\n\nactivities along main\nroads; no parking\nspace; on road\nloading/unloading\n\u2022  All combined leading\nto frequent gridlock\nsituation\n\nMansehra\nWater Supply on\nGravity Flow\n\n\u2022  System suffering\nfrom high losses\n\u2022  Polluted surface\nwater source\n\u2022  High cost for\nelectricity for\ndeepwell pumps\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nImproved quality of\nsupply and quality of\nwater\nIncreased fraction of\npumped and treated\nwater actually\ndelivered and sold to\nconsumer\n\n\u2022  Pilot composting scheme:\ncivil works, equipment\n\n\u2022  Community self-help\n\ncollection and disposal:\ncivil works, small\nequipment\n\n\u2022  Sanitary landfill sites:\n\n\u2022 \n\ndevelopment of disposal\nsite and basic operational\nequipment\nImproved collection,\ntransport, and disposal:\nprovision of basic\nequipment\n\n\u2022  Resurfacing, upgrading\n\u2022  Road widening\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\nImproved roadside drains\nImproved traffic\nmanagement\n\n\u2022 \n\nIntroduction of 5,500\nwater meters\n\n\u2022  Leak detection and repair\nscheme: reduce from 55\npercent to 30 percent\n\u2022  Management assistance:\n\nprepare operation\nmanual, training,\nintroduction of billing and\npayment systems, set-up\nmanagement information\nsystem\n\n\fTakht Bhai\nRailway Crossing\n\n57\n\nAppendix 9, page 4\n\nName/Subproject\n\nPresent Condition\n\nRationale\n\nScope\n\nSanitation\n\n\u2022  No piped sewerage\n\n\u2022  Sanitation\n\nSewerage and\nDrainage\n\n\u2022  No piped sewerage\n\n\u2022  Subproject will provide\n\n\u2022  Construction of\n\nsystem\n\n\u2022  High incidence of\n\nopen drains carrying\nraw sewage\n\n\u2022  Narrow crossing\n\nleading to congestion\nthroughout the day\n\n\u2022  Reduced traffic\n\ncapacity because of\nencroachment\n\n\u2022  Unsafe conditions for\n\npedestrians\n\n\u2022  Present crossing ill-\ndesigned and\ndangerous\n\n\u2022  Train three times per\n\nweek\n\nsystem\n\n\u2022  High incidence of\n\nunsanitary methods\nof disposal of human\nwaste (pit latrine,\nbucket systems,\ndrain, open space)\n\u2022  PHED to rehabilitate\ncombined drainage\nnetwork\n\nimprovements should\nimprove functioning of\nexisting facilities by\nthe providing\nmaintenance\nequipment; and by\nimproving the flow of\nthe existing network\n\n\u2022  A new crossing will\nimprove traffic flow,\nreduce economic\nlosses caused by\ncongestion, and\nreduce nuisance for\nresidents and road\nusers\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n(Re)construction of drains\n(40 hectares)\n(Re)construction of septic\ntanks (18 communal)\n\u2022  Development of sludge\n\ndrying site with\nassociated infrastructure\n\u2022  Provision of desludging\nand maintenance\nequipment (handtools,\netc.)\n\n\u2022  Relocation of \n\nencroaching commercial\nestablishments to be\ncompleted before\nsubproject processing\n\u2022  Civil works on railway\n(removal and clearing\nballast), and on roads\n\ntransport and\ntreatment of\nwastewater. \nSecondary and tertiary\ndrains will be improved\nthrough the PHED-\ninitiated rehabilitation\nscheme.

The Government will assume the\nforeign  exchange  risk.  In  addition,  the  NWFP  Government  will  provide  $250,000,  in  foreign\ncurrency,  to  finance  the  cost  of  the  international  municipal  financial  management  advisor\nposition of 13 person-months, as included under the Institutional Development Component.\n\nAll  disbursements  for  subprojects  will  be  made  by  the  project  coordination  unit  upon\n2.\nendorsement of pertinent project implementation teams and municipal committees (MCs). MCs\nwill be required to borrow an amount equal to a minimum of 20 percent of the subproject cost,\nand  up  to  50  percent  depending  on  the  MCs  financial  capacity.  The  MCs  will  sign  subloan\nagreements  with  DOF  for  the  loan  portion  of  the  subproject  cost,  using  standard  terms  and\nconditions established by DOF, including an interest rate of 7 percent and repayment period of\n15 years, and a three-year grace period during which interest payments only will be payable. No\ninterest  will  accrue  on  subloans  during  the  construction  of  subprojects  because  of  the  small\nscale of the loans and the short implementation period. Subject to the demand for loans in the\nfuture,  DOF  may  retain  principal  repayments  made  by  the  MCs  for  relending  subject  to  its\nobligations to repay funds to MOF to enable MOF to meet the Government\u2019s obligations to ADB.\n\nThe Government will seek the approval of ADB for any significant change to the terms\n3.\nand  conditions  of  the  loan  agreement  between  DOF  and  MOF.

SOs are likely to operate from the offices of the MC.\n\nUpon appointment by the PCU, the NGOs will select teams of SOs for the phase 1 project\n11.\ntowns.  The NGO will be responsible for the selection process, according to outline job descriptions\nand  qualification  requirements  as  specified  by  the  PCU.    Before  the  start  of  their  involvement,\ncandidate  SOs  will  be  trained  at  the  provincial  level  under  guidance  of  the  senior  community\ndevelopment adviser (CDA), who has overall responsibility for the planning and implementation of\nthe community development process. The training will focus on clarifying the role of the SOs in the\nprocess, nature, and objectives of the overall Project; some fundamentals on urban services and\ninfrastructure; and the functioning and organization of (urban) local government and the municipal\ncommittee in particular. Experience can be drawn from other successful community-based projects\nin NWFP on appropriate forms of organizing and training large groups of SOs.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 12, page 5\n\n12.\nDuring  the  course  of  the  Project,  senior  SOs  will  be  selected  based  on  experience  and\norganizational  aptitude  to  take  on  a  wider  role  in  administration,  training,  and  dissemination  of\ncollective  experience.  During  the  course  of  the  Project,  some  organizational  structure  will  evolve\nwithin the group of SOs, with more experienced SOs assuming a regional management role, and\nliaison for practical purposes between town teams and the central PCU.\n\n13.\n\nTasks for the SOs include the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nReceive training and orientation at the PCU on the project framework and\nthe overall developmental objectives;\nBecame  familiar  with  available  relevant  socioeconomic  data  from  earlier\nstudies  and  surveys  on  project  town:  social  profile,  priorities  on  service\nprovision, records on fee payments (data to be provided by the PCU);\nMap  population  groups  in  project  town  assigned;  inventory  social  groups\nand  existing  CBOs;  report  on  functioning  of  existing  CBOs,  record  nature,\npurpose, composition, and method of operation;\nGain  insight  on  the  operation  of  the  MC;  plan,  organize,  and  conduct\nexploratory  meetings  with  key  municipal  staff,  explaining  objectives  of\ninvolvement in the development program;\nMaintain  close  coordination  with  the  PIT,  in  particular  with  the  community\nliaison  officer  (CLO)  within  the  team,  and  keep  informed  on  planning\nprocess; train the CLO, jointly define role and method of operation;\nThrough  interviews  and  from  observation,  assess  the  level,  purpose,  and\nmechanism of current interaction between MC and the population, whether\nas individuals, representative organizations, or lobby groups;\nPlan, prepare, and conduct a series of joint meetings or workshops between\nCBOs  (representatives)  and  MC  staff,  to  discuss  mutual  expectations  and\npriorities  on  respective  roles  in  town  management,  and  on  means  to\nimprove constructive communication and collaboration; discuss and identify\npotential roles of communities in planning and delivering urban services and\ninfrastructure;  achieve  joint  understanding  on  common  objectives;  explore\nand identify common benefits;\n\n(ix) \n\nlevels, \n\n(viii)  Plan, prepare, and conduct meetings, workshops, and training seminars for\nto  discuss  actual  and  assigned  role  and\nMC  staff  at  all \nresponsibilities  of  local  government  in  service  delivery  and  improve\nperformance;\nPlan,  organize,  and  deliver  public  awareness  campaigns  for  specific\nsubprojects;  improve  awareness  among  communities  on  impact  of  their\nliving  environment  and  family  health;  explain  reason  for  and  benefit  of\ncertain  sanitation  improvements  and  need  for  charges  to  maintain  certain\nservices; and\nAct  as  liaison  and  catalyst  between  communities  and  other  sources  of\nsupport  in  other  sectors,  such  as  health,  education,  and  employment\ngeneration;  and  provide  guidance  on  how  to  access  other  support\nprograms.\n\n(x) \n\n14.\nEstimates for the input of SOs (Table A12.4) are based on (i) a team of one female and\none male SO per project town; (ii) for the entire period of the project, including initial planning,\nsubproject  selection  and  appraisal,  bid  preparation  and  evaluation,  and  implementation  of\nsubprojects,  estimated  as  approximately  three  year;  and  (iii)  for  a  total  of  17  project  towns.\nActual inputs per town are bound to vary, as may be total number of participating towns.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 12, page 6\n\n15.\nAdditional  input  is  identified  for  senior  management  time  of  the  NGO(s)  involved,\nreflecting planning, organization, and management at the provincial level between the NGO and\nthe PCU.

Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) and financial internal rates of\nreturn (FIRRs), as appropriate, were prepared for representative subprojects in accordance with\nthe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of\nUrban Development Sector Projects.  EIRRs  were  prepared  for  road  and  drainage  subprojects\n(Table A14.2), and FIRRs for solid waste disposal and water supply subprojects (Table A14.3).\n\n2.\nFinancial evaluations were based on current fees paid by consumers and indications of\nwillingness to pay for improved services, determined on the basis of a socioeconomic survey of\nhouseholds.  However,  the  surveys  generally  indicated  a  low  willingness  to  pay,  apparently\nreflecting doubts by potential beneficiaries about the capacity of government to deliver effective\nprojects and an underestimation of the impact of projects on their lives. Economic evaluations\nwere based on the domestic price numeraire, and exclude taxes (at a rate of 10 percent) and\nother  market  distortions  (with  a  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.85).  A  shadow  exchange  rate\nfactor was applied to tradable components of the project costs. Projects were assessed over a\n20-year evaluation period, with allowance made for the residual value of assets at the end of the\nevaluation period. The evaluations were undertaken using constant 1999 prices, and took into\naccount incremental operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. The minimum acceptable EIRR\nshould be 12 percent, and FIRRs for subprojects should exceed the real weighted average cost\nof  capital,  which  is  estimated  at  2.5  percent.  However,  the  community  development  and\nparticipation  component  of  the  Project  is  designed  to  increase  public  understanding  and\nownership  of  subprojects,  and  thus  improve  beneficiary  perception  of  the  effective  delivery  of\nservices  and  understanding  of  the  benefits  that  will  result.  The  higher  willingness  to  pay  that\nshould  result  will  increase  the  value  of  the  subprojects,  which  are  conservatively  based  on\ncurrent willingness to pay.\n\nA.\n\nDrainage and Sanitation\n\n3.\nStorm-water  drainage  subprojects  involve  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  existing  drains,\nand  some  development  of  new  drains,  to  establish  an  interconnected  network  with  suitable\noutflow arrangements. The subprojects will reduce the incidence of inundation, which is severe\nin some towns with flat terrain, and reduce the incidence of erosion in towns where the terrain\nleads  to  rapid  runoff  of  storm  water.  The  former  will  result  in  reduced  damage  to  property,\nimproved quality of life, and health benefits. These benefits will be reflected, to some extent, in\nincreased  property  values  following  implementation  of  the  subprojects.  Drainage  subprojects\nwill reduce property damage, social dislocation and health impacts, and economic dislocation.\nThe value of such benefits will often be difficult to explicitly identify and value, but willingness by\nbeneficiaries  to  pay  for  the  benefits  will  normally  provide  an  indication  of  their  value.  It  is\nprobable that some of the social benefits from reduced flooding and environmental benefits from\nreduced erosion may not be fully  reflected through indications of willingness to pay. This may\nwarrant acceptance of subprojects that have lower EIRRs but where unquantifiable social and\nenvironmental benefits are expected to be major benefits. No pure drainage subprojects have\nbeen prepared for the initial project towns, and hence no evaluation has been undertaken.\n\nSanitation improvements will generally involve the provision of individual and communal\n4.\nseptic tanks, which, in conjunction with drainage subprojects, will result in diversion of outflows\nfrom  septic  tanks  and  household  wastewater  away  from  residential  areas  and  for  outflow  to\noccur in suitable locations. The improved sanitary conditions that will result will provide health\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 14, page 2\n\nbenefits  and  savings  in  medical  expenditure.  Socioeconomic  surveys  for  the  project  towns\nindicate only limited current willingness by the community to pay for improved services, at about\nPRs11  per  household  per  month  for  improved  drainage  and  sanitation.  This  occurs  despite\ncurrent  high  levels  of  morbidity  due  to  waterborne  diseases,  with  63  percent  of  households  in\nthe initial project towns reporting illness in the household in the month before the survey. The\nprincipal illnesses were malaria (26 percent), diarrhea (23 percent), and typhoid (14 percent), all\nof which are related to poor water management.\n\n5.\nA  financial  evaluation  was  prepared  for  the  component  of  a  subproject  in  Takht  Bai,\nwhich would provide treatment of wastewater and removal via improved secondary and tertiary\ndrains, which will reduce exposure of residents in the urban area to contaminated wastewater.\nBased on the currently expressed willingness to pay, the FIRR for the subproject is estimated at\n6.1 percent (Table A14.2). This FIRR would increase substantially if community perceptions of\nthe merits of the subproject were improved and the willingness to pay increased accordingly.\n\nB.\n\nSolid Waste Disposal\n\n6.\nSolid waste subprojects involve development of new disposal sites, procurement of units\nfor the collection of solid waste, and improved treatment of solid waste. The subprojects have\nenvironmental and health benefits that warrant acceptance of a hurdle rate that is less than the\nopportunity  cost  of  capital  associated  with  the  Project.  Socioeconomic  surveys  for  the  project\ntowns indicate a negligible current willingness by the community to pay for improved services.\n\nA financial evaluation was prepared for a subproject to develop an improved system of\n7.\nself-help  collection  and  disposal  of  solid  waste  in  Charsadda  through  community  mobilization,\nthe  purchase  of  relevant  collection  and  disposal  equipment,  and  development  of  a  waste\ndisposal site. Socioeconomic surveys for the project towns indicate a low current willingness by\nthe  community  to  pay  for  improved  urban  services,  but  the  community  development  and\nparticipation  component  of  the  Project  are  expected  to  improve  beneficiary  perception  of  the\neffective delivery of waste collection services and understanding of the benefits that will result.\nThe  combination  of  a  current  willingness  to  pay  of  PRs11  per  household  per  month  and  a\nreduction in the cost of maintaining drains because of the reduced quantity of waste disposed of\nin  drains  results  in  an  FIRR  for  the  subproject  of  7.1  percent  (Table  A14.3).  This  FIRR  would\nincrease  substantially  if  community  perceptions  of  the  merits  of  the  subproject  were  improved\nand the willingness to pay increased accordingly.\n\nC.\n\nWater Supply\n\n8.\nWater  supply  subprojects  will  generally  involve  rehabilitation  of  and  extensions  to\nexisting systems to improve the quantity and quality of water supply, and reduced technical and\nadministrative  losses.  Reductions  in  physical  losses  of  water  and  wasted  water  will  allow\nadditional  water  to  be  supplied  to  new  consumers  without  the  need  to  increase  the  supply  of\nraw water. A financial evaluation was prepared for a water supply subproject in Hangu to reduce\nphysical water leakage, improve the water distribution system, and introduce water meters. The\nbenefits  of  the  subproject  will  be  to  release  current  water  that  can  be  sold  to  new  customers.\nBased on projected water tariffs (PRs85 per household per month, which is equal to 2 percent\nof average 25th percentile household income of PRs4,500 per household per month, with a 5\npercent per annum real increase in the water tariff), the FIRR for the subproject is estimated to\nbe 10.6 percent (Table A14.3).\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 14, page 3\n\nD.\n\nRoads\n\n9.\nRoad improvements will include improvements to the surface and alignment of existing\nroads, widening of existing roads, and to a lesser extent, construction of new streets. Benefits\ninclude savings in vehicle operating costs (VOCs) and personal travel time (business purposes),\nand increased accessibility for development. The last of these benefits is reflected in higher land\nvalues, but is excluded because of the risk of double-counting the benefits, and the difficulty of\naccurately  depicting  increases  in  land  value  that  can  be  attributed  to  improved  accessibility.\nSavings in VOCs resulting from road improvements take into account the effect of higher travel\nspeed  and  reduced  road  roughness  on  VOCs  as  derived  by  the  Ministry  of  Communications.\nSavings in personal travel time were based on trips for work purposes only. Incremental O&M\ncosts were estimated at 0.4 percent of the capital cost of subprojects, plus an allowance of 20\npercent  of  the  capital  cost  every  seven  years  for  resurfacing.  The  economic  life  of  road\nimprovement subprojects is 20 years.\n\nAn economic evaluation was prepared for the subproject to improve an at-grade railway\n10.\ncrossing  in  Takht  Bai  to  improve  traffic  movement  and  reduce  delays.  The  crossing  is  heavily\nused, and the improvement results in an EIRR of 17 percent (Table A14.2). Savings in VOCs\naccount  for  40  percent  of  the  benefits;  and  savings  in  personal  travel  time  account  for  the\nremaining benefits. Overall, the road subprojects in the central areas of towns are expected to\nhave high EIRRs because of the concentration of traffic in those areas and the poor quality of\nexisting roads. Rehabilitation of existing roads will also generally have higher EIRRs because of\nthe considerable savings in travel time and, in particular VOCs, which can result from relatively\nmodest expenditure. New roads to developing areas at the periphery of towns are likely to have\nlower EIRRs, but may be warranted in some circumstances.\n\nTable A14.1:  Summary of Economic Benefits of Subprojects\n\nBenefit\nHealth & Environment\n Reduced waterborne diseases\n Reduced fly/mosquito breeding\n Decreased infant mortality\n Less sick time off from work\n Improved school attendance\n Savings in medical costs\n Improved hygiene standards\n Pollution abatement\n Fewer road accidents\nInfrastructure and Financial\n Expanded land use and availability\n Increased land/property values\n Increased MC revenue\n Reduced MC O&M costs\n Reduced damage to crops/livestock\n Reduced road maintenance costs\n Reduced vehicle operating costs\n\nSolid\nWaste\n\nWater\nSupply\n\nRoads\n\nDrainage\n\nSanitation\n\nMedium\nHigh\nMedium\nMedium\nMedium\nMedium\nHigh\nHigh\n\nHigh\nHigh\nMedium\nMedium\nMedium\nMedium\nHigh\nHigh\n\nLow\nLow\nMedium\nHigh\nLow\n\nHigh\nHigh\n\nMedium\nMedium\nMedium\nHigh\nHigh\n\nHigh\nHigh\nMedium\n\nHigh\nHigh\nMedium\nMedium\nMedium\nMedium\nHigh\nHigh\n\nHigh\nHigh\nMedium\nMedium\nHigh\nHigh\nMedium\n\nMedium\n\nMedium\nHigh\n\nMedium\nHigh\nMedium\nLow\n\nHigh\nHigh\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 14, page 4\n\nSolid\nWaste\n\nWater\nSupply\n\nRoads\n\nDrainage\n\nSanitation\n\nBenefit\n Reduced travel time\n Improved accessibility of markets\n\nSocioeconomic Development\n Improved municipal service levels\n Improved trade and business\n Employment impacts\nMedium\n Reduced household maintenance\nHigh\n Improved living standards\n Greater productivity of MC staff\nHigh\nMC = municipal committees, O&M = operation and maintenance.\n\nHigh\nHigh\nMedium\nHigh\nHigh\nHigh\n\nHigh\nHigh\n\nHigh\nHigh\n\nHigh\nHigh\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nHigh\n\nHigh\nMedium\n\nHigh\nHigh\nMedium\nMedium\nHigh\nHigh\n\nHigh\n\nMedium\nHigh\n\nTable A14.2:  Summary of Economic Evaluations\n\nComponent/Location\n\nRoad Improvement, Takht Bai\nSanitation and Drainage Rehabilitation, Takht\nBai\n\nBase\nCase\n\n17.3\n6.1\n\nCase 2\n(Benefit\n\u201310%)\n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return  (%)\nCase 4\nCase 1\n(1+2)\n(Capital\nCost\n+10%)\n15.7\n5.4\n\nCase 3\n(Delayed\nBenefits\n1 year)\n14.2\n4.6\n\n15.3\n5.2\n\n13.9\n4.6\n\nCase 5\n(1+2+3)\n\n12.6\n4.1\n\nTable A14.3:  Summary of Financial Evaluations\n\nComponent/Location\n\nSolid Waste Improvement, Charsadda\nWater Supply, Hangu\n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return (%)\n\nBase\nCase\n\n7.1\n10.6\n\nCase 1\n(Capital\nCost\n+10%)\n6.0\n9.5\n\nCase 2\n(Benefit\n\u201310%)\n\n5.6\n9.2\n\nCase 3\n(Delayed\nBenefits\n1 year)\n5.4\n8.7\n\nCase 4\n(1+2)\n\nCase 5\n(1+2+3)\n\n4.6\n8.2\n\n4.1\n7.5\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 15, page 1\n\nSOCIAL ASPECTS AND AFFORDABILITY\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSocial  development  concerns,  including  gender,  poverty,  and  community\n1.\nparticipation,  have  been  incorporated  into  all  stages  of  project  preparation.  Gender,\npoverty, and public welfare issues were the bases of approaches used in socioeconomic\nand urban data collection during the project preparatory technical assistance, particularly\nin the design of the household perception survey and the survey of current services and\nsocial  and  physical  infrastructure  in  the  initial  project  towns,  and  in  the  sector  and\nsubsector assessments. Social and economic issues influenced the selection and design\nof the urban infrastructure, community development, and participation components of the\nProject. The involvement of the public in subprojects will complement and reinforce the\nimmediate  economic  and  health  benefits  associated  with  water  supply,  drainage,\nsanitation,  and  solid  waste  management  components  of  the  Project  by  ensuring\nsustainability and ownership.\n\nB.\n\nSocioeconomic Profile of Urban Households\n\nThe average household size in the initial project towns is 7.7, with an average of\n\n2.\n1.2 families per household.\n\n3.\nAverage household monthly income is estimated to be PRs9,800, with the 25th\npercentile  and  medium  income  at  PRs4,400  and  PRs7,100  respectively  (Table  A15.1),\nindicating a substantial unequal distribution of income in the community. About two thirds\nof  income  for  both  average  and  25th  percentile  income  households  is  spent  on  food,\nclothing,  rent,  electricity,  fuel,  and  water,  with  only  0.4  percent  of  income  for  both\ncategories of household spent on water. The amount spent on water is only 4 percent of\nthat spent on electricity and fuel.\n\n4.\nHousehold  ownership  is  high,  at  86  percent  of  households,  with  an  average  of\none  fifth  of  houses  being  katcha  (permanent  mud-formed  structures).  Flooding  is  a\nproblem  for  many,  with  17  percent  of  households  reporting  that  floodwater  enters  their\nhomes. The supply of services to households includes a low 26 percent for solid waste\ncollection, 37 percent have piped water supply, and 40 percent have a septic tank. The\ncurrent moderate residential density away from town centers alleviates the difficulties of\nthese service levels. However, high average population growth of 3.6 percent per annum\nwill increase the need for higher levels of service in the future.\n\nC.\n\nGender\n\n5.\nThe  ratio  of  women  in  urban  households  in  the  initial  project  towns  is  low  in\ncomparison with demographic norms, with an average of only 93 women for every 100\nmen  in  urban  households.  Women  also  remain  almost  exclusively  tied  to  household\nactivities,  wives  make  up  only  3  percent  of  employed  household  members,  compared\nwith  husbands  at  86  percent,  children  at  8  percent,  and  other  household  members,  3\npercent.\n\nWomen in Pakistan bear primary responsibility for management of the domestic\n6.\nenvironment,  including  water  collection  and  solid  waste  disposal.  Children  also\nparticipate  significantly  in  these  activities.  Women  will  therefore  benefit  directly  from\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 15, page 2\n\nproject  activities  that  improve  sanitary  conditions  in  the  immediate  surrounding  area  of\nhomes  (improved  removal  of  wastewater  and  solid  waste  collection).  Women  will  also\nbenefit  from  drainage  projects  that  reduce  the  incidence  of  flooding  of  houses  and  the\ndamage and dislocation that results.\n\nD.\n\nAffordability to Beneficiaries\n\n7.\nA review of the components and subcomponents included in the Project reveals\nthat  the  direct  and  indirect  repayment  burdens  imposed  on  beneficiaries  are  generally\naffordable  to  all  benefiting  social  and  income  groups.  The  affordability  implications  for\nparticular subcomponents are discussed in the following subsections.\n\n1.\n\nImmovable Property Tax\n\n8.\nCurrent collection of the immovable property tax varies considerably between the\ninitial  project  towns,  ranging  from  PRs0  to  PRs41  per  capita  per  annum,  equal  to  a\nmaximum of 0.03 percent of average household income and 0.08 percent of first quartile\nincome  households,  and  generally  a  markedly  lower  share  for  most  urban  residents.\nSubstantial increases in revenue from the immovable property tax are expected only in\ntowns where rates are low at present. Hence, the need to increase resource mobilization\nthrough  the  immovable  property  tax  should  not  generally  present  a  burden  to\ncommunities.  The  immovable  property  tax  is  mildly  progressive  because  very  small\nallotments (of less than approximately 38 square meters) pay no tax, although this effect\nis diminished by a relatively higher rate of tax for small to medium-size allotments (5-10\nmarla) than for larger properties. The Tax could be made more progressive by ensuring\nthat the unit tax rate rises with property size.\n\n2.\n\nWater, Drainage, Sanitation, and Solid Waste Charges\n\n9.\nSurveys  indicate  only  limited  current  willingness  by  the  community  to  pay  for\nimproved  services  (e.g.,  about  PRs11  per  household  per  month  for  improved  drainage\nand  sanitation  services,  and  PRs26  per  household  per  month  for  improved  water\nsupply). This occurs despite current high levels of morbidity due to waterborne diseases,\nwith  63  percent  of  households  in  the  initial  project  towns  reporting  illness  in  the\nhousehold  in  the  month  before  the  survey.  The  principal  illnesses  were  malaria  (26\npercent),  diarrhea  (23  percent),  and  typhoid  (14  percent).  Proposed  subprojects  will\ncontribute  to  a  reduction  in  these  water-related  illnesses  by  improving  the  removal  of\nwastewater and solid waste, and reducing the unnecessary presence of still water. The\ncommunity  development  and  participation  component  of  the  Project  is  designed  to\nincrease  public  understanding  and  ownership  of  subprojects,  and  thus  improve\nbeneficiary  perception  of  the  effective  delivery  of  services  and  understanding  of  the\nbenefits that will result.\n\n10.\nA proposed increase in the cost of water, on an incremental basis over the first\ntwo years of the project implementation, of PRs85 per household per month, will result in\na  tariff  that  is  equal  to  2  percent  of  average  25th  percentile  household  income  of\nPRs4,400  per  household  per  month,  which  indicates  that  continuing  real  increases  in\nwater tariffs (which will be offset to some extent by rising household income) can occur,\nwhile  still  ensuring  adequate  access  by  low  income  households  to  water.  Similarly,\ncharges for removal of solid waste and for drainage and sanitation improvements should\nbe affordable to beneficiary communities.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 14 October 2001)\n", "Currency Unit\nPRs1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013\n=\n=\n", "Pakistan Rupee/s (PRe/PRs)\n$0.01210\nPRs82.6255\n", "Pakistan  maintains  a  market-based  exchange  rate  system.
