A wide range of \nactivities of support to rural communes by the Government, with or \nwithout international assistance, have significantly been enhanced and \nmade possible by the type of outputs that CCDP has produced and that \nthis  project  is  aimed  at.  The  Project  has  three  components: \n(i) Commune Council Facilities, which will enable about 235 commune \ncouncils to build local assembly premises, enabling them to function, \nand  institutionalizing  their  role;  (ii)  Civil  Registration  System \nDevelopment, to build on Cambodia\u2019s achievement in collecting hard-\ncopy  civil  registration  (CR)  records  over  2003\u20132006,  by  creating  a \nmodern,  computerized  national  CR  system;  and  (iii)  Capacity \nDevelopment, to continue building awareness, understanding, and the \nconcept  of  decentralization  and  deconcentration,  public  service, \ndemocratic rights, and responsibilities. \n   \nRationale  Cambodia has historically been a highly centralized state. The long-\nterm  institutional  reform  process  of  decentralization  and \ndeconcentration  (D&D)  of  government  decision  making  and  public \nservice delivery, begun in 2001, is the single most significant state-\nbuilding development in the country since the 1993 Constitution. \n \nThe  creation  of  a  local  level  of  elected  administration\u2014commune \ncouncils\u2014and  the  first  commune  council  direct  elections  in \nFebruary 2002  have  now  led  to  the  preparation  of  a  new  legal \nframework  for  the  district,  provincial,  and  new  urban  authorities. \nComprehensive new legislation for the entire subnational administration \nis to be submitted to the National Assembly in the first half of 2007. This \nlegislation (the Organic Law) will be supported by an implementation \nprogram of D&D, designed for a decade, with a preparatory and initial \nstage  expected  to  run  through  2007\u20132008.  This  will  include  the \nestablishment  of  an  implementation  authority,  together  with  its ", "ii   \nstructures, systems, and procedures. A transition phase, to run from \n2009 to 2012, is expected to expand the concrete transfer of service \ndelivery functions from line ministries to the newly created subnational \nauthorities.  \n \nLocal  administration  in  Cambodia  is  expected  to  be  accorded  an \nincreasing  level  of  responsibilities.  However,  serious  constraints  in \ninstitutional and physical capacity persist for most of the country\u2019s 1,621 \ncommune councils. Commune councils (i) plan and implement small-\nscale  local  infrastructure  projects  for  community  development, \n(ii) resolve household and local disputes and  issues (for example, land \nmanagement and irrigation), (iii) allow government participation in the \narticulation of local issues, (iv) provide CR facilities, and (v) keep civil \nrecords and the electoral database.  \n \nAlthough commune councils cannot, because of their small size and \nresources,  take  on  more  service  delivery  functions,  they  are  the \ndemocratically elected foundation of the new district, provincial, and \nmunicipal authorities now being created. CCDP has made important \nprogress in addressing weaknesses in the facilities of communes and \nhas contributed to improving their capacity, but most of the country\u2019s \n1,621 commune councils continue to lack (i) a fixed facility to meet as a \ncouncil or with their constituents, or for keeping documentation and \nequipment, severely limiting their effectiveness in local development; \n(ii) awareness of democratic rights and responsibilities and of public \nservice obligations; (iii) a system for storing and updating CR records \ncollected in 2003\u20132006; and (iv) institutional relationships among and \nbetween councils, and linkage to district and provincial government.   \n \nCCDP has made an important contribution to strengthening commune \ncouncils operationally. A specially commissioned process review by the \naudit  company  KPMG  has  confirmed  the  effectiveness  and \nsustainability of the methodology of CCDP and of this project.  \n   \nImpact and  Impact.  Overall  consolidation  of  the  new  institution  of  elected  local \nOutcome  government.  For  local  public  administration,  the  Project  will \n(i) effectively  contribute  to  improving  the  living  standards  of  local \ncommunities; (ii) strengthen the accountability, reach, responsiveness, \nand  transparency  of  subnational  public  sector  administration  and \nservice  delivery;  and  (iii)  strengthen  men\u2019s  and  women\u2019s  voice  and \nparticipation in local affairs and public service delivery.  \n \nOutcome.  The  Project  will  (i)  enable  more  commune  councils  to \noperate  effectively,  (ii)  develop  the  national  CR  system,  and \n(iii) strengthen  voter  understanding  of  democratic  rights  and \naccountabilities.  These  outcomes  will  provide  essential  support  for \ninstitutionalizing  more  accountable  local  government  and  gender-\nresponsive forms of local government and public service delivery.   \n   \nProject Investment  The investment cost of the Project is $9.78 million, including taxes and \nPlan  duties. The grant proceeds will not be used to finance taxes and duties.  ", "  iii\nFinancing Plan  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide Asian Development \nFund grant financing of $7.8 million to be implemented over 30 months. \nThe Government will contribute $1.98 million in the form of counterpart \nstaff,  salaries,  accommodation,  equipment  for  operation  and \nmaintenance, land, and taxes and duties. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  January 2007 to December 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The  Ministry  of  Interior  (MoI),  through  its  Department  of  Local \nArrangements  Administration (DoLA) and Office of Civil Registration (OoCR), will be \nthe main Implementing Agency for this project. A Project Technical Cell \nwill be established within MOI. Component 1, Commune Facilities, will \nbe  implemented  by  the  prioritized  commune  councils,  with  central \nsupervision by DoLA and support from one international consultant (the \nproject team leader) and three national consultants. Component 2, Civil \nRegistration System Development, will be implemented by the OoCR, \nwith support from DoLA, a long-term national consultant, and the project \nteam leader. Component 3, Capacity Development, will be implemented \nby  DoLA\u2019s  capacity-building  office  with  support  from  two  full-time \nnational consultants for capacity building and gender, and one short-\nterm international consultant.   \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Interior \n   \nConsulting Services  International: 25 person-months \nNational: 241 person-months \nConsultants will be engaged by the Executing Agency according to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Individual consultants will \nbe  recruited  for  the  following  fields  of  expertise:  engineering  and \narchitecture, capacity building, data management, accounting, gender \nmainstreaming, and mass media. \nConsultants for impact evaluation studies will be engaged through a \nfirm using the Quality- and Cost-based Selection method. \n   \nProcurement  The commune councils will procure works, goods, and services through \nshopping for component 1, as the small value and scattered nature of \nthe procurement is not likely to attract international bidders. Certain \ncommunes  in remote locations, which would find difficulty attracting \ncontractors,  may  carry  out  procurement  through  community \nparticipation. Machinery and office equipment will be procured through \nnational competitive bidding where the cost is equal to or more than \n$100,000 and through shopping where the cost is less than $100,000.  \n   \nTechnical  Technical assistance (TA) will be provided to promote gender equity in \nAssistance  local  governance.  It  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  elected  women \ncouncilors and women and children focal points in six target provinces \nby activating women networking forums in districts and communes. The \nforums are intended to provide women with opportunities to share their ", "iv   \nexperience and self-learning, promote mutual support and networking, \nbuild  confidence,  increase  visibility,  and  improve  work  performance. \nThe  TA  is estimated  to  cost  $236,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  finance \n$200,000  equivalent,  to  be  funded  from  the  Gender  Development \nCooperation  Fund.  The  national  nongovernment  organization  (NGO) \nWomen for Prosperity will be recruited for a period of not more than 12 \nmonths  to  implement  the  TA  activities.  The  national  NGO  will  be \nretained through single-source selection, according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants. The services are expected to begin in the \nsecond half of 2007, or 18 months after the Project takes effect, and to \nbe completed 1 year later, in 2008. Supplies and materials under the TA \nwill be procured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n   \nProject Benefits and  Component 1: Commune Facilities. Local-assembly premises will be \nBeneficiaries  made  available  to  about  235  commune  councils,  thus  providing \nadequate working facilities for elected councilors and their constituents \nand helping to establish the newly introduced institution of elected local \ngovernment in Cambodia.  \n \nComponent 2: Civil Registration System Development. The whole \npopulation  (especially  women  and  children)  will  be  able  to  prove \nentitlements based on official birth, death, and marriage documentation. \nMore comprehensive and accurate information provided by the system \nwill also allow better informed government planning and policy making.  \n \nComponent 3: Capacity Development. The training fund will support \ntraining  for  elected  commune  councilors,  clerks,  and  government \nofficials  in  concepts  of  local  democracy  and  accountability,  council \ntasks,  roles,  and  services.  The  mass  media  fund  will  support  the \ndissemination of key messages on local democracy, participation, and \naccountability through TV, radio, and village theaters.  \n \nGender issues will be addressed in all component activities. A full-time \ngender specialist will be engaged to strengthen the gender content of all \ntraining and mass media activities and to ensure that the \u201csoon to be \napproved\u201d  DoLA  gender  strategy  and  gender  action  plan  is \nimplemented.   \n \nThe  Project  as  a  whole  will  contribute  to  strengthening  the  new \ninstitution of elected local government in Cambodia. Democracy and \ngreater participation will benefit the poor and women by promoting more \nefficient  and  accountable  service  delivery  and  thus  more  equitable \ngrowth  opportunities.  Commune  democracy  has  been  the  most \nimportant development since the 1993 Constitution in deepening and \nbroadening  democratization  in  Cambodia.  Commune  democracy  will \nshortly begin to affect the other subnational tiers and more service \ndelivery  agencies  as  a  result  of  current  draft  legislation  to  create \nindirectly elected district and provincial councils. The benefit of greater \npopular voice, participation, transparency, and thus accountability over \nresources and services managed by provincial and district governments \nis potentially very substantial. \n ", "  v\nBenefits Evaluation. The Project will lay down an analytical framework \nand  a  data  collection  mechanism  for  the  impact  evaluation  of  its \ncommune council facilities component, to be done at a later date. The \nevaluation  method  will  combine  the  methods  of  propensity  score \nmatching and double differences, using commune and household data. \nThe  data  will  be  collected  through  three-stage  surveys  (province, \ncommune, and household), with sample households from each sampled \ncommune  stratified  by  poverty  level  (poorest,  middle  income,  and \nrichest). The total sample will comprise 100 project communes and 100 \nnonproject  communes,  with  15  households  to  be  surveyed  in  each \nsampled commune. The baseline survey will be done at the start of the \nProject. A similar survey will be done at project completion. ADB will \nwork with DoLA to develop a specific design for the surveys. This data \ncollection mechanism will be funded under the Project. \n   \nRisks and  Corruption  is  a  project  risk.  Construction  funds  could  be  misused, \nAssumptions  materials used could be defective or of poor quality, or inferior design \nstandards could be applied. This risk will be mitigated by (i) project \ndesign, which sets rigorous quality specification and control standards, \nincluding  an  operations  manual  for  constructors;  (ii)  quality  checks \nbefore,  during,  and  after  construction  by  a  permanent  project  team \nformed for this purpose; (iii) standardized designs, which facilitate cost \nmonitoring  and  control;  (iv)  very  tight  cost  margins,  which  minimize \nopportunities to overstate costs; and (v) moral suasion resulting from \nthe  high  status  accorded  to  the  construction  of  commune  council \nbuildings under the Project.\n \n \nThere is also the risk that the local administration will still have weak \ncapacity by the time the responsibilities and resources are turned over, \nor that the commune councils will not be sufficiently responsive to their \nconstituents\u2019  needs.  The  capacity  development  component  of  this \nproject,  in  conjunction  with  diverse  activities  of  other  development \npartners, is aimed at mitigating capacity gaps. This risk will be mitigated \nby (i) the public awareness campaign funded by the Project, (ii) the \nactions of other donors, and (iii) the competitive political process at the \nlocal level, which is expected to make local officials more sensitive to \nthe needs of their communities because of electoral accountability.   \n \nThere  is  moreover  a  risk  that  the  process  of  decentralization  and \ndeconcentration  will  be  mismanaged,  incompletely  implemented,  or \nsubstantially delayed. There is the risk as well that after the functions \nare  transferred,  not  enough  resources  will  be  provided  and  local \ngovernments will therefore remain weak. This uncertainty goes beyond \nthe scope of this project, but it is partly mitigated by the Government\u2019s \ncommitment to its reform agenda, as evidenced most recently by the \npreparation  of  a  draft  Organic  Law  for  Deconcentration  and \nDecentralization and the preparation of an implementation framework \nfor  this  purpose.  It  is  further  mitigated  by  the  participation  of  other \ndevelopment  partners  working  with  the  Government  to  address  key \nimplementation issues. ", "vi   \nAs before, there is always the risk of possible capture of the local \ngovernment by the rich and powerful, or of local councils not operating \nopenly and democratically. However, available assessments perceive a \npositive effect of local democratic processes in reducing the risk of elite \ncapture and financial abuse. As referred to above, local development \nprojects  appear  to  be  free  from  elite  capture,  according  to  past \nassessments, and are seen to benefit the majority rather than the few. \nAlso, the public does not see its councils as adversely affected by \npartisan politics and dispute mediation is the main councilor activity, \napart from administrative tasks. ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Commune Council Development Project 2 (CCDP2). The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for the Capacity Development of \nFemale Commune Council Networks, and if the Board approves the proposed grant, I, acting \nunder authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.   Rationale and Analysis \n \n2.  Public administration reform and local governance are key areas of Asian Development \nBank (ADB) support under the current country strategy and program (CSP) for the Kingdom of \nCambodia  2005\u20132009.1 This  Project  is  a  follow-up  to  the  Commune  Council  Development \nProject (CCDP), which was approved by ADB in 2002 to assist the Government in ensuring that \nin the medium term all commune councils would have the facilities and basic equipment to \nfunction effectively.2 The CCDP has been successfully implemented.3 Commune councils are \nrecognized as playing an essential role in the promotion of democratic practices and in the \nsocioeconomic development of rural Cambodia. However, as in 2002, many communes do not \nhave office facilities or operate in temporary and dilapidated wood structures, and thus have \nseriously impaired capacity to positively influence the welfare of local communities.  \n \n3.  Commune Councils. Cambodia is an overwhelmingly rural country. More than 80% of \nthe population lives in rural areas and poverty incidence ranges from 40% to 60% (Cambodia \nCSP 2005\u20132009). Cambodia has 1,621 communes and sangkats. Of this total, 1,510 are mostly \nrural communes in the 20 provinces, and 111 are urban sangkats in the four municipalities \n(mostly in Phnom Penh). Commune councils are the lowest level of public administration in \nCambodia.  The  Commune  Administration  Act  2001  gave  councils  \u201clocal  affairs\u201d  duties  to \nmaintain security and public order; manage public services; promote welfare, economic, and \nsocial development; protect and conserve the environment; and promote tolerance and mutual \nunderstanding. The 2002 subdecree decentralizing powers, roles, and duties set out two broad \nroles  for  commune  councils:  promoting  development  and  achieving  greater  democracy. \nHowever, these powers are discretionary and supplementary: councils are not responsible for \npolice, education, health, and other major services. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. January 2005. Country Strategy Program 2005\u20132009, Kingdom of Cambodia.  \n2  ADB RRP CAM-1953 (ADB. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a \nProposed  Loan  and  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Commune  Council \nDevelopment Project. Manila) approved on 12 November 2002. This project is cofinanced by ADB, the Swedish \nInternational Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), and the Royal Netherlands Embassy. ADB provided $10 \nmillion equivalent through Loan 1953-CAM (Special Funds [SF]), Sida gave a grant of $3 million equivalent, and \nthe Government of the Netherlands gave a grant of $2.4 million equivalent. The Government contributed $2 million \nin kind. The CCDP is executed by the Ministry of Interior (MoI) through its Department of Local Administration \n(DoLA). The CCDP has four components: commune facilities, capacity building, orthographic mapping, and civil \nregistration. This project was prepared with assistance from TA-CAM: 4739. The CCDP assisted in furnishing 519 \ncommunes with proper offices. \n3  The November 2004 midterm review (MTR) of CCDP, subsequent ADB reviews, and the performance review \nconducted in March 2006 during the design phase of this follow-up project indicate successful performance across \nall components. ", "2   \n4.  The  councils  each  have  7  to  15  elected  councilors,  depending  on  the  size  of  the \ncommune. In the first commune and sangkat elections (February 2002) 11,261 commune and \nsangkat councilors were elected (8.5% were female and 10.2% were from ethnic minorities) for \na term of 5 years. The second commune and sangkat elections will be in April 2007. The \ncouncilors receive a small monthly stipend. Only one staff member of the council, the council \nclerk, is a Ministry of Interior (MoI) employee. The councils\u2019 main revenue source is a formula-\nbased allocation from the Government, the commune fund (currently about $12,000 yearly for \neach commune, on the average). About two thirds of each council\u2019s commune fund allocation is \nmainly used in small-scale rural infrastructure, and the rest goes to the council\u2019s administrative \ncosts.  The  small  average  size  of  communes  and  sangkats  is  a  major  constraint  on  their \npotential capacity as direct service providers. Being small, however, also means that councils \nare close to the people. Councilors can therefore play a key role in services such as the \nresolution of family and other disputes, and the maintenance of local peace and order. Councils \nalso support the implementation of the Land Law 2001: they conduct land use planning, resolve \nlocal plot disputes, and monitor illegal use. They have been given direct responsibility for two \nimportant state infrastructure services: civil registration (CR) (of births, deaths, and marriages) \nand maintenance of the electoral database. All councils are also involved in planning, allocating, \nand implementing local infrastructure and other rural development investments financed from \nthe Commune and Sangkat Fund. \n \n5.  The  most  comprehensive  independent  study  of  commune  and  sangkat  council \nperformance to date, commissioned by the Asia Foundation,4 found that citizens are generally \nsatisfied with the performance of their councils, and that the resolution of commune issues has \nimproved since the introduction of elected councils. Citizens are aware of commune council \nfunctions. Local development projects appear to be free from elite capture and are seen to \nbenefit the majority rather than the few. The study found that dispute mediation is the main \ncouncilor activity, other than administrative tasks, and that commune councilors are now as \nlikely to be involved in dispute resolution as village chiefs. Councilors are reportedly approached \nby local residents (5 to 10 each day) for help in resolving local disputes, mostly about land or \nirrigation, and family disagreements. Overall, the study findings were positive about the growing \nrole, mandate, and competence of the commune councils. \n \n6.  Rationale for Supporting Commune Councils. Supporting commune councils is a \npriority because, first, they are directly entrusted with basic state infrastructure (CR) and support \nfor land registration, processes that are vital in giving people greater access to essential justice \nadministration,  such  as  the  protection  of  property  rights,  and  other  fundamental  services \nprovided by the state. Councilors\u2019 effectiveness in resolving disputes, supporting essential land \ntitling and management processes, and planning and implementing small-scale infrastructure is \nessential in sustaining increases in agricultural productivity, the determinant of living standards \nin rural Cambodia. The role of the councils in spreading the benefits of civil and land registration \n(and other state-building processes) is crucial in increasing the outreach and effectiveness of \npublic services to the rural population (targeting of education and health-care efforts, and of \nagriculture policy instruments). Commune councils, by serving as a stable institutional platform \ncloser to the people, also greatly enhance the above-mentioned outreach and effectiveness of \npublic services provided by other tiers of subnational administration to the communes. Most \n                                                 \n4  Kim Ninh and Roger Henke. 2005. Commune Councils in Cambodia: A National Survey on their Functions and \nPerformance. The Asia Foundation (May). The field research in April to June 2004 canvassed the perceptions of \n1,416 voter-age citizens and 708 councilors across the country. \n ", "  3\nimportantly,  public  and  collective  direct  feedback  on  the  quality  of  these  services  to  the \ncouncilors is crucial for sustained improvement. \n \n7.  Although commune councils will have limited direct control over service delivery, in a \ncountry with little history of local participation and empowerment, it is crucial to develop the \nrepresentative \u201cvoice of the people\u201d on the quality of local services provided by higher levels of \nsubnational  public  administration.  Besides  providing  direct  feedback  on  public  services, \ncommune councils can be more fundamentally empowered as a result of the ongoing plans for \ndecentralization and deconcentration (D&D). The relevance of supporting commune councils for \nthis reason is implicitly recognized in the current CSP for Cambodia with a firm commitment to \nassist the Government in ensuring that in the medium term all commune councils will have the \nbasic  conditions  to  function  effectively.  However,  ADB  and  the  Government  have  also \nrecognized that the effect on local economic development from supporting commune councils \ndepends heavily on the pace of overall D&D. In other words, the effectiveness of the direct \nfunctions of the commune councils and of their scrutiny of subnational public services depends \non whether public service functions are indeed being decentralized and deconcentrated to the \nprovinces and districts. \n \n8.  Decentralization and Deconcentration. In June 2005, to establish the objectives and \nprinciples  for  all  the  required  changes  in  public  management  structures  in  Cambodia,  the \nGovernment  approved  the  Strategic  Framework  for  Decentralization  and  Deconcentration \n(SFDD).  The  SFDD  is  intended  to  frame  all  policies,  legal  instruments,  and  operational \nprocedures of ministries and institutions of the Government regarding the management and \ndistribution of responsibilities and resources to the provincial, municipal, district and khan, and \ncommune and sangkat levels. Organic laws that are now being prepared will constitute the \nbasic legal framework for implementing these major changes in public administration. A draft of \nthe new Organic Law under preparation since April 2006 is now being translated and is to be \nsubmitted to the National Assembly in early 2007. The proposals in the draft Organic Law are \nexpected  to  be  submitted  to  the  National  Assembly  by  early  2007,  to  create  unified \nadministrations  and  indirectly  elected  councils  (elected  by  the  commune  and  sangkat \ncouncilors) in provinces, districts, municipalities, and khans (urban districts). This is a major step \nforward in increasing the potential for voice and participation, and in structurally improving \nsubnational governance.  \n \n9.  In essence, with the future implementation of the Organic Law, authority for providing \nsome public services will be delegated to the provincial and district administrations, enabling \nthese to effectively avoid the current overlapping and duplication of those functions with line \nministries; and democratic mechanisms of scrutiny and accountability of government will be \nestablished as these unified administrations will be accountable to the newly created respective \ncouncils. As local administration in Cambodia undergoes significant changes, the commune \ncouncils will be awarded with an increasingly important role in subnational affairs. However, \ndeep deficiencies in institutional, physical, and human capacity persist, threatening to jeopardize \nthe potential effectiveness of the reforms. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "4   \nB.   Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n10.  Deep Deficiencies. As noted in the ADB\u2019s CSP 2005\u20132009: \n \nWhile the holding of commune elections was an important first step, further efforts \nare needed to expand opportunities for citizens to influence and participate in \ngovernment.  Currently  the  commune  councils  control  very  limited  resources, \nresulting in low levels of implementation of services and investment. They still lack \nthe  authority,  administrative  capacity,  and  financial  resources  to  accelerate \ndevelopment at their level, and have limited means for dispute resolution. (para. \n23, CSP 2005\u20132009, Kingdom of Cambodia, ADB, January 2005) \n \n11.  In this context, since early 2003, ADB has financed CCDP to tackle these problems. \nMuch has been achieved since then. CCDP has provided offices\u2014\u201cmini-parliament\u201d premises\u2014\nfor 519 councils with no accommodation, which act as a powerful visible symbol of the primacy \nof  local  democracy.  Council  communication  capacity  has  improved  since  the  provision  of \ntypewriters,  a  province-district-commune  radio  network  for  remote  areas,  and  some \nmotorcycles. All five provincial local administration units (PLAUs) were provided with refurbished \noffices and now have adequate working facilities. Training has strengthened councilor and \nofficial  understanding  of  democratic  concepts  and  procedures.  The  largest-ever  public \nawareness campaign in Cambodia has given councilors, staff, and the public a better grasp of \nthe key concepts of local democracy. Up-to-date photomaps with a scale of 1:40,000 have been \ncreated for most of the country and are accessible, greatly increasing the efficiency of land \nregistration, land-use planning, and boundary demarcation. The first CR process (births, deaths, \nand marriage formalization), which is the basis of many civil and gender rights, is almost \ncomplete. \n \n12.  Despite clear progress, however, the Government faces major challenges in sustaining \nits efforts to upgrade the capabilities of the communes. First, many councils still do not have a \nfixed meeting place, and must meet as a council or with constituents in local pagodas, schools, \nrestaurants,  or  houses.  Second,  embedding  key  concepts  of  local  democracy\u2014including \npopular mandate, legitimate opposition, councilors as local advocates and service providers\u2014\nrequires  sustained  efforts  to  build  capacity.  Third,  strengthening  the  councils\u2019  important,  if \nlimited, service delivery roles in maintaining CR and the electoral register, providing small-scale \ninfrastructure and rural development investments, maintaining social harmony, and tackling land \nand familial disputes is a major and continuing task. Fourth, the relationships among many small \ncouncils, and their linkages to the administrations of districts and provinces, and to line ministry \nservices deconcentrated to subnational tiers, still need reform.5 Fifth, the amount of public \nresources that the Government and other donors can mobilize to support commune councils is \ncannot fund the needs of all communes, for example, the construction of offices. \n \n13.  ADB Support to Commune Councils. The opportunity for ADB support rests on two \nfactors. First, building on recognized success and lessons learned is a sound approach. The \nreview of the implementation performance of the CCDP in March 2006 (Appendix 2) endorsed \nthe findings of the November 2004 midterm review (MTR), which highlighted CCDP\u2019s successful \n                                                 \n5  For more details on the D&D reform and performance of commune councils, see Appendix 1 (Sector Analysis) and \nthe report Ninh, Kim, and Roger Henke. 2005. Commune Councils in Cambodia: A National Survey on their \nFunctions and Performance. Phnom Penh: The Asia Foundation (May). \n ", "  5\nimplementation performance.6 The field survey done as part of the CCDP review of March 2006 \nfound that the support provided by CCDP is highly appreciated by councilors and clerks, district \nand provincial officials, and enjoys strong support from government at the highest level. Second, \nalthough  several  donors  are  trying  to  address  the  need  for  support  at  subnational \nadministration, there are no available resources for the specific areas of focus of CCDP and \nADB. Indeed, ADB has developed a clear comparative advantage in the provision of council \nfacilities, in support for public awareness media campaigns, and in the CR drive.  \n \n14.  Donor Coordination. Donor coordination to support this long-term reform agenda has \nevolved  around  two  parallel  issues.  First,  for  a  number  of  years,  a  common  and  sizable \nimplementation mechanism for aid projects developed in the early 1990s\u2014Seila\u2019s Partnership \nfor Local Governance (PLG)\u2014has been systematically used by different donors. Through this \nimplementation mechanism, important support has been given to the commune and sangkat \nfund. Also, many forms of subnational public service delivery have had important benefits from \npublic service provided through some of the projects being implemented through Seila\u2019s PLG \nand capacities developed from the systematic use of public officials as consultants in Seila\u2019s \npermanent  structures.  With  the  D&D  reforms  being  announced,  and  with  the  increasing \nacknowledgment of the consequences of such a sizable parallel structure of governance, Seila \nfaces the challenge of reorganizing its structure. This process has been rendered complex in \nthe absence of a concrete long-term definition of the changes ahead. The second issue is in \nregard to the Government\u2019s requirement for all donor support to subnational administration to be \ncoordinated  along  government  strategies.  The  objective  is  twofold:  to  prioritize  donor \ncoordination along a common framework (the Government\u2019s) of objectives without creating \nparallel  structures  of  governance,  and  to  minimize  disruption  to  ongoing  implementation \narrangements for delivering support to subnational levels (all the ongoing projects through \nSeila). ADB has aligned its support to the sector with government mechanisms, while providing \nassurances to development partners that it will align itself with the new framework once this is \nfinalized and agreed on between the Government and its development partners.  \n \n15.  Gender  and  Development.  In  the  past  few  years,  Cambodia  has  experienced \nsubstantial progress in promoting gender sensitivity in local governance. Laws, regulations, and \nprocedures that articulate the need to foster gender-sensitive analysis and consultative local \nplanning processes are in place. Annual budget allocations for gender mainstreaming in the \nnational  and  provincial  governments  have  been  provided.  Much  of  the  funding  has  been \ninvested in an ambitious national gender awareness training program and, as a result, the level \nof  gender  awareness  has  increased  among  government  officials  and  elected  commune \ncouncilors.  \n \n16.  Gender mainstreaming efforts have also had a significant effect on commune councils. \nWomen  in  the  villages  are  increasingly  expressing  their  needs  in  the  commune  planning \nprocess. Evidence suggests that gender issues across a broad range of sectors are being \nraised  in  the  commune  plans.  The  issues  include  economic  and  agricultural  support, \nreproductive health, HIV/AIDS, literacy, vocational skills training, and violence against women. \n                                                 \n6  Some recent comparisons on the efficiency of implementation of infrastructure projects claim that under a pooled \nsystem like Seila - whereas a number of fixed donors shoulder the bulk of overall overhead costs of the system \n(consultants, supplementation, administrative overheads) - an infrastructure project would be asked to shoulder \nonly an average of $1.00 in overheads to deliver $4.70 in investments for commune and province authorities. \nUnder the CCDP, it has taken $1.00 in overhead so far to deliver an average of $12.00 of infrastructure. Under \nCCDP2, because less funds will be devoted to infrastructure, it will take $1 in overhead to deliver $8 of \ninfrastructure. ", "6   \nHowever, assistance has tended to focus on building the capacity of the commune council in \ngender mainstreaming and less on direct investment in services prioritized by women.7  \n \n17.  While the Government was largely successful in fostering commitment and action to \npromote  equality  and  women\u2019s  participation  in  commune  council  affairs,  significant  areas \ncontinue to require attention, including the lack of empowerment and self-esteem of women \ncouncilors. The 2007 elections will provide an important opportunity to have more women as \ncommune councilors and to further advance gender equity in the next phase of D&D reform. In \nthis context, the need for continuous support for empowering newly elected women councilors \nand  women  and  children  focal  points  (WCFPs)  to  effectively  perform  their  roles  and \nresponsibilities in commune councils is critical and forms the rationale for the proposed gender \ndesign features of CCDP2. \n \nC.  Lessons  \n \n18.  Gender Mainstreaming: Capacity Building and Mass Media. A key lesson learned \nfrom the review of implementation of the CCDP is the importance of mainstreaming gender \nissues. Addressing gender issues is necessary to ensure equality of public participation, but \nwas not explicitly recognized as either an issue or an objective of the CCDP in its original \ndesign.  Gender issues loom large in the daily work of the communes in a variety of contexts, \nnot least in relation to their important focus on mediation of domestic disputes and oversight of \nCR. The use of the training and mass media funds under the CCDP, as redesigned under \nimplementation, has contributed significantly to sensitizing both men and women to the issues \nof women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights. Thus, the CCDP review found that it would be highly beneficial \nto assist the Department of Local Administration (DoLA) in strengthening the detailed content \nand key messages in training and mass media materials. This finding has the strong support of \nthe Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs, which has played an active role on the National Committee for \nSupport to Commune-Sangkat Councils.  \n \n19.  Commune councils are well placed to give voice to women councilors, clerks, and \ncitizens, and strengthen the undisputed importance of birth and marriage registration for gender \nrights. Concomitantly, there has been important progress on the DoLA gender strategy and \ngender action plan (GAP) over the past year (see Appendix 2, paras. 22 to 25). Both the \nNovember 2004 MTR and the ADB Gender Study of CCDP (Gender Equality Results in ADB \nCambodia,  Cambodia  Country  Report,  ADB,  February  2006)  recommended  strengthening \ngender mainstreaming through both project and stand-alone TA support. \n \n20.  Protection of Civil Registration Records. The Cambodia country study, within the \nmulticountry  ADB  study  Establishing  Legal  Identity  for  Social  Inclusion,8 makes  important \nrecommendations  for  the  future  development  of  Cambodia\u2019s  CR  system.  These  include: \nconsolidating the legal identity regime, reducing local abuse of the CR fee regime, simplifying \nprocesses, and increasing resources. It is crucial at this point in time to directly address a key \nrecommendation of the study to \u201cSecure all civil registration and legal identity documents...to \n                                                 \n7  Helen  Brereton  for  Partnership  for  Local  Governance  and  edited  by  Michael  Wild.

In addition to keeping paper records, all legal identity information \nshould be standardized and computerized.\u201d It is also now crucial to directly address the study's \nrecommendation to \u201cRaise awareness through a public relations campaign to familiarize the \npublic with the benefits associated with legal identity.\u201d \n \n21.  Integrated  Project  Structure.  The  MTR  and  the  CCDP  review  in  March  2006 \n(Appendix 2)  had  positive  conclusions  about  the  project  management  structure.  However, \naccording  to  the  results  of  the  review,  the  main  identified  weakness  in  the  Project  is  the \noperation of the four components largely in isolation from each other. Overall a silo culture has \ndominated, and interesting lessons have not been shared among components. The absence of \na  unified  organogram  and  management  structure  for  the  TA  team  in  the  report  and \nrecommendation of the president (RRP) caused difficulties for ADB management in the initial \nstages of the Project. That weakness needs to be remedied by integrating project teams into the \nGovernment\u2019s management structure.  \n \n22.  Efficiency and Accountability in the Flow of Funds. Appropriate structuring of the \nflow of funds contributes to project efficiency as well as to accountability. The CCDP experience \nin the use of special bank accounts for the construction of the second batch of commune \ncouncils is deemed to be very positive. This process is advantageous for many reasons. It gives \ncommune councils greater control over their finances, facilitates and speeds up transfers of the \nblock grant, and allows transfers to be done individually by commune, and not necessarily in \nprovincial batches, as had to be done in the first phase of CCDP (commune bank accounts, \ntransfers from the imprest account, bank reports to the project under the special arrangement, \nand the 11-stage payments from the block grant in the MoI\u2013commune council block grant \nagreement are all in US dollars). Also, financial monitoring is sharply improved, since the bank \nbranch is fully able to provide monthly statements on all commune-held accounts. \n \n23.  Imprest  Account.  An  audit  of  the  CCDP  including  its  financial  management, \nprocurement, and anticorruption measures, which was completed in 2004, provided valuable \nlessons on the appropriateness of the project design, as well as recommended improvements. \nA key observation was the delay in project implementation arising from the less than optimal \nsize of the imprest account. The audit recommended that raising the imprest account to 20% of \nproject  size  would  have  major  benefits  in  ensuring  that  each  batch  of  commune  council \nconstruction would be completed on time, and allowing the construction of additional council \nfacilities from the resulting cost savings. \n \n24.  Donor  Coordination.  Coordination  with  other  donor  partners  around  capacity \ndevelopment\u2014and particularly in relation to training\u2014is essential. Capacity development for \nsubnational public administration, including training for female councilors and clerks, is now an \nacutely congested and uncoordinated area of donor support. All of Cambodia\u2019s major donors \nare supporting the training of subnational administration in different ways. One reason for the \ncreation of the new implementation authority for the Organic Law, led by the deputy prime \nminister and co-minister of the Ministry of Interior, and the April 2006 independent study of \ndonor support is to bring these diverse donor support efforts within a single government-led \nframework. Appendix 3 describes the identified official aid projects in this field at present (not \nincluding  the  numerous  current  nongovernment  organization  contributions,  many  of  them \nfinanced by official donors). Notable among current official support programs are the diverse \ntraining and other activities in all communes and sangkats (with a gender mainstreaming focus \nfor  the  past  6  years)  financed  by  Seila\u2019s  PLG  donors  including  UNDP,  Sweden,  United ", "8   \nKingdom, Denmark, World Bank, Canada, International Fund for Agricultural Development, and \nUNICEF; the large program of the European Union support in 2006; ongoing work by Deutsche \nGesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  GmbH  and  the  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development, and Plan International\u2019s Local Administration and Reform Project. \nThese programs reach more than 500 communes.  \n \n25.  In the immediate term, the only practicable means of coordination and avoidance of \nduplication, overlap, and waste of resources in relation to training is for training resources to be \nused only to contribute to the development and financing of activities included in the annual \nDoLA training plan. An independent study on forms of implementation for donor support to the \nrural area9 submitted to the Government highlights the disruptive effects of the current lack of \ncoordination of donor presence on commune councils\u2019 accountability (to their citizens) and \navailable time to perform their duties. It is hoped that there will be some progress toward \nestablishing  a  coherent  framework  for  capacity  development  support  to  subnational \nadministration over the life of this project under the guidance of DoLA. An evaluation concern for \nthe implementation of CCDP\u2019s mass media fund, noted in the CCDP review (Appendix 2), was \nthat, because the core messages of decentralization were not sharply defined beforehand for \ncouncilors, officials, or the public, the publicity campaign did not always result in clear messages \nbeing internalized.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n26.  The Project is envisaged to (i) contribute effectively to improving the living standards of \nlocal communities; (ii) strengthen the accountability, reach, responsiveness, and transparency \nof subnational public sector administration and service delivery; and (iii) strengthen citizens\u2019 \nvoice and participation in local affairs and public service delivery. The Project will enable more \ncommune  councils  to  operate,  develop  the  national  CR  system,  and  strengthen  voters\u2019 \nunderstanding  of  democratic  rights  and  accountabilities.  These  outcomes  will  help \ninstitutionalize democratic, accountable, and gender-inclusive forms of local government and \npublic service delivery (see the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 4). \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n27.  Component 1: Commune Councils Facilities. The output of component 1 will be new \ncouncil premises for about 235 commune councils, providing the latter with adequate meeting \nand  operating  facilities,  symbolic  of  the  role  and  significance  of  local  democracy  in  the \ncommune. The next 235 or so councils on the Government\u2019s priority list will be selected from \namong the next highest councils on the provincial listing, prepared through the independent \nformula-based needs and prioritization assessment used under CCDP. In October 2002, the \nNational Committee for Support to Commune-Sangkat Councils agreed on a weighted-factor \nformula for prioritizing communes within the CCDP budget allocated to each province. The \nfactors  are:  existence  and  condition  of  the  commune  office,  commune  population,  and \ncommune poverty ranking. The formula-based priority ordering will be recalculated using the \nrecently available commune population data, gathered before the 2007 local elections. The total \n                                                 \n9 Rainer Rohdewohld and Douglas Porter. 2006. Independent Study of Donor Support for Decentralization and \nDeconcentration. Phnom Penh. \n ", "  9\nnumber of commune councils potentially requiring support is 1,006 (excluding the 519 assisted \nunder CCDP and the 20 urban communes in the provinces).  \n \n28.  The prioritized communes will be surveyed, detailed designs and estimates completed, \nand  contracts  and  block-grant  agreements  prepared.  These  contracts  and  block-grant \nagreements will be based on the fully detailed Implementation Handbook developed under \nCCDP,10 and will include requirements such as availability and ownership of unoccupied land for \nthe new council office, procurement and tendering guidelines, use of locally hired supervising \ntechnicians, and the staged-payment scheme. The average cost for each office at current \nmaterial prices is $19,500. The calculation of the block grant for each council is based on the \nmodel design selected, priced at current local prices within the commune, and with a 7% \nmarkup  for  contractor  overhead  and  margin.  Any  overall  savings  on  this  component  from \nchanges in unit cost will be used to finance additional offices from the provincial priority lists. \nFinancial  transfer  arrangements  will  use  selected  commune  councils\u2019  specially  contracted \ndeposit accounts at private commercial bank local branches, rather than the provincial treasury \nchannel, as in the first phase of CCDP. \n \n29.   Initial orientation and training meetings will be held in the provinces of the prioritized \ncouncils, leading to procurement and construction. The implementation phase, covering all \nworks in the provinces in each of three zones covering the whole country, will be supervised by \nthe  three  contracted  architect  engineers.  No  operation  and  maintenance  problems  are \nanticipated, as the quality of the completed commune council facilities visited during the design \nphase survey continues to be excellent. An independent study on CCDP component 1 noted \nthat the commune facilities subcomponent is recognized as innovative in Cambodia and has \ngained a reputation for being successful, particularly because of the quality of the buildings, the \ndisbursement  rate,  the  Implementation  Handbook,  and  the  current  transfer  system.11 The \nproject implementation schedule (Appendix 5) is based on four batches of communes being \nimplemented in parallel. This is designed to minimize implementation time and maximize the \ncost efficiency of the Project. To achieve this efficiency gain over CCDP, the ceiling of the \nimprest account will be 20% of the grant amount.  \n \n30.  Gender. In response to the requests of senior officials from the Ministry of Women\u2019s \nAffairs to allow female councilors and the Commune Committees for Women and Children \n(established  in  2004)  priority  use  of  the  commune  premises,  the  standard  MoI\u2013Commune \nCouncil Block Grant Agreement will be amended to include this requirement. In very remote \ncommunes  where  no  contractor  is  prepared  to  bid,  component  1  will  use  the  Community \nParticipation in Procurement method, in which the commune council is authorized, after failure \nof the bidding process, to split the works into smaller contract packages (a lump-sum labor \ncontract; materials; and construction management). During the initial survey of each location, \nthe project engineers will discuss the need for, and practicability of, latrines with the council. \n                                                 \n10  The Implementation Handbook includes all the plans, drawings, and design details needed to construct the council \noffice. It specifies all the necessary contract and procurement procedures and forms required by the councils, and \nthe amounts payable to contractors for the 11 stages of construction and the five stages of timber works. The \n11-stage payment process is directly linked in the Implementation Handbook to the detailed drawings and technical \nguidance for the works in each step. \n11  KPMG  and  Asian  Development  Bank.  Commune  Council  Development  Project.  Commune  Facilities \nSub-Component 1-1: Assessment of Financing and Implementation System. Draft Report. 28 July 2006. The \nKPMG report recommends an increase in the percentage of the ADB advance to avoid implementation delays and \nto reduce unnecessary administrative work, including additional overhead costs incurred as a result of extensions \nrequired for the implementation period. The implementation system for component 1 of this project is nearly \nidentical to that used by CCDP and is independently endorsed by KPMG. ", "10  \nWhere no sex-segregated latrines are easily and publicly available in the commune center, and \nwhere it is confirmed that water is available throughout the year, sex-segregated toilets will be \nincluded in the standard design. The future operation and maintenance costs of the council \npremises  are  the  responsibility  of  the  commune  council.  The  administrative  portion  of  the \ncommune and sangkat fund transfer is sufficient to fund such costs. \n \n31.  Component 2: Civil Registration System Development. The output of component 2 is \na  sustainable  computer-based  CR  system  with  secured  hard-copy  records  and  a  central \nsearchable and extendable database. This component builds on the recommendations and \nlessons on the future development of Cambodia\u2019s CR system, as indicated by the ADB study \nEstablishing Legal Identity for Social Inclusion, referred to earlier.12 The major activities in \nimplementing component 2 will be to: secure storage facilities for one copy of all CR record \nbooks within the MoI in Phnom Penh; arrange for one copy of all complete CR books to be \ntransferred to MoI, and filed and indexed accurately; recruit (by the Government) additional staff \n(male and female with a minimum of first year university education or its equivalent) for the \nOffice  of  Civil  Registration  (OoCR)  to  manage  the  CR  system  in  perpetuity;  develop  the \nsoftware and hardware specifications and systems for the central database; write, pilot, and test \nsoftware programs; procure computers, servers, scanners, and other necessary hardware; train \nOoCR staff and operators in equipment use and data entry; and formalize data-entry quality \ncontrol procedures and protocols. Once these elements are in place, scanning and data entry, \nwith checking and quality control, should begin in 2008. \n \n32.  A system for collecting, updating, and analyzing CR records of births, deaths, and \nmarriages is an essential element of any country\u2019s demographic infrastructure. Because they \nestablish documentary evidence of parentage, marriage, age, origin, and family structure, CR \nrecords are also the essential foundation for human, gender, and child rights, as these will \nensure  the  conservation  of  vital  records  and  thus  promote  legal  certainty,  transparency, \nprotection  of  women\u2019s  and  children\u2019s  property  and  inheritance  rights  from  abuse,  and \npredictability  in  accessing  basic  social  services  and  productive  resources.  The  MoI  has \nexpressed its long-standing concern to preserve the hard-copy CR records, which are now \nstored in 180 district offices and provincial courts, many of them threatened by humidity, floods, \nand deterioration, and to establish a modern computerized system for cataloging, accessing, \nand updating the records. This component effectively tackles the most urgent task of halting the \ndeterioration of the collected records.  \n \n33.  Component  3:  Capacity  Development.  The  output  of  component  3  is  trained \ncouncilors,  clerks,  and  government  officials  and  a  24-month  mass  media  campaign.  The \ncomponent includes two funds: a training fund to support activities included in DoLA\u2019s annual \ntraining plan, and a mass media fund to continue and develop the public awareness work \nlaunched by CCDP. The major implementation activities financed from the training fund are: \nsupporting DoLA\u2019s  Capacity  Building  Office  (CBO),  with  other  DoLA  capacity  development \nproviders, to prepare the annual training plan; identifying the items in the annual training plan to \nbe supported by the training fund; reviewing and strengthening the content and methodology of \ntraining modules and materials for consistency with laws and concepts of local democracy; \n                                                 \n12  MoI is updating the 2000 CR sub-decree, to harmonize the CR legislation with the current National Identity Card \nand Household Book systems. Plan International has committed to provide the necessary legal TA to achieve this. \nFor this reason, this item is not budgeted under this component. If for any reason Plan International cannot provide \nthis support, assistance may be offered to MoI from within this component or the project contingency (or both) with \na minor change in scope. \n ", " 11\nreviewing and strengthening the gender content and methodology of training modules and \nmaterials; contracting  training providers and monitoring implementation, with the DoLA CBO \nand  in  the  component  management  information  systems  (MIS);  undertaking  small-sample \nimpact studies, including gender-disaggregated data. The new councilors, to be elected in the \n1 April 2007 commune elections, will require orientation and systems training, and the growth in \nscope of training topics in the DoLA training plan requires financing support. The major national \ntraining programs in the 2006 DoLA annual training plan are: monitoring and evaluation for \nfinance  and  administration,  conflict  resolution,  domestic  violence,  natural  resources  and \nenvironmental management, health and education, child rights and protection, and facilitation \nskills. \n \n34.  Mass Media Fund: Mainstreaming Gender. The major activities for the implementation \nof the mass media fund are: developing, with DoLA, the key local democracy messages\u2014\nincluding local democratic roles and accountabilities, commune council services, legal identity \nand  CR,  and  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  women  councilors  and  of  WCFP\u2014to  be \npromulgated through public awareness campaigning; outlining a 24-month multimedia public \nawareness campaign; identifying and procuring experienced local providers for each media \ntype; reviewing and strengthening the content and methodology of draft media materials for \nconsistency  with  key  local  democracy  messages;  reviewing  and  strengthening  the  gender \ncontent and methodology of the draft media materials; and commissioning small-sample impact \nstudies, including gender-disaggregated data, of the effect of each element of the awareness \ncampaign. The mass media fund will be used for producing, broadcasting, and evaluating \ndecentralization and local democracy messages, using a mix of media (theater, TV, radio, \nposters, leaflets).  Component  3  builds  on  the  experience  and  achievements  of  the  CCDP \ncapacity-building component, and addresses its identified weaknesses (see Appendix 2). The \nlatter  relate  to  the  need  for  long-term  capacity  development  assistance,  mainstreaming  of \ngender, and integrating training activities with DoLA\u2019s training plan. In addition, the consultants \nwill give priority to developing an appropriate system for planning the use of the two funds, and \nfor reporting what has been achieved with the finances disbursed, including full sex segregation. \nThe component will supplement the activity-monitoring data in the MIS with commissioned \nsmall-sample evaluations of the effect of activities financed from both the training and mass \nmedia funds. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n35.  The Project has five special features. First, it follows up the successfully implemented \nCCDP. Second, this support is premised on a long-term commitment to support incoming \ndecentralization reforms in Cambodia. Third, the Project is a further ADB contribution to key \nelements of state building in a historically fractured country. Fourth, gender is mainstreamed \ninto  all  activities  of  the  Project.  In  addition, the  TA  provided  with  the  Project  is  aimed  at \nstrengthening the capacity of elected women councilors and WCFPs in six targeted provinces. \nFinally, the Project will assist the implementation of DoLA\u2019s gender strategy. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "12  \nD.

Contingenciesa  0.71 \n      Total (A+B)  9.78 \na  The  provision  is  10%  for  price  and  physical  contingencies  of  the  base  cost  portion  funded  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank. This percentage is fully justified by the experience of the Commune Council Development \nProject  (CCDP).  For  financial  contingencies,  all  contracting  and  payments  are  in  US  dollars.  Notably,  for \ncomponent 1, which is the majority of the Project, all transfers to commune accounts with a commercial bank and \nall reporting are in US dollars. The block grant for each commune council is calculated at local commune prices, as \ndescribed in the project description above. Because component 1 finances many small discrete items (commune \ncouncil premises) any significant increase in unit price is simply met through a reduction in the number that can be \nfinanced. In CCDP, the contingencies budget line was used to finance the second batch of 95 council offices. This \nis an inefficient way to operate, however, since it requires the three supervising architect engineers to revisit \ncompleted provinces to oversee a small number of second-batch works. \nSource: Appendix 6, based on Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n36.  The total project cost is $9.78 million, including taxes and duties, and contingencies. The \ndetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 6. \n \nE.  ADF IX Grant Component \n \n37.  As a poor, debt-distressed country, Cambodia is eligible for Asian Development Fund IX \n(ADF) grant financing of up to 50% of its ADB lending program, as spelled out in ADF IX \nDonor\u2019s Report: Development Effectiveness for Poverty Reduction. It is recommended that ADB \nprovide  the  Project  with  $7.8  million  grant  financing  from  ADF  IX  grant  facilities.  Specific \njustification includes the Project\u2019s support for local democratic development, and full alignment \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  July  2004  Rectangular  Strategy 13  objectives  of  promoting  good \ngovernance  and  decentralization  and  deconcentration  reforms,  as  reiterated  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s National Strategic Development Plan for 2006\u20132010.14 \n \nF.  Financing Plan \n \n38.  The Government has requested a grant of $7.8 million, or 80% of the total cost of the \nProject, from the ADF to help finance the Project. The Government\u2019s contribution from local \nsources will be $1.98 million, or 20% of the total project cost. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n13 Royal Government of Cambodia. 2004.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.  Project Management \n \n39.  The MoI will be the Executing Agency (EA) and with the support of the DoLA will be \nresponsible for the execution of the Project. The Project will not create a separate project \nmanagement unit, but will work within the MoI structure. The following organogram sets out the \nstructure of project management: \n \nOrganization for Project Management     \n           \n                                                                 \n \nProject Director \n(Director General MoI/GDLA) \n \nProject Manager \n(Director DoLA) \nProject \nAdministrator/coordinator\n(DoLA)\n   \nDoLA Project Accountant  DoLA Local  \nTA: 1 l-t National  Finance Specialist \nC1 \u2013 Commune Facilities  C2 \u2013 Civil Reg\u2019n System  C3 \u2013 Capacity Building \n(DoLA)  (DGA/OoCR)   (DoLA) \nTA: 1 C1 Manager + 3  TA: 1 l-t National TA: 2 l-t National + 1 p-t Int\u2019l\n DGA =   Department of General Administration, DoLA = Department of Local Adminsitration, GDLA = General \n Department of Local Administration, MoI = Ministry of Interior, OoCR = Office of Civil Registration, TA = technical \nassistance.\n \n40.  A Project Technical Cell (PTC) will be established within MoI before the effective date.15 \nThe  PTC  will  consist  of  a  project  director,  a  project  manager,  a  project  administrator-\ncoordinator, and five other MoI staff. The director general of the General Department of Local \nAdministration (GDLA) will be appointed project director, the director of DoLA will be appointed \nproject manager, and a senior staff member of DoLA will be appointed project administrator and \n                                                 \n15 The purpose of this arrangement is to establish clear responsibility for project implementation, but without creating \na separate ADB project management unit and office within DoLA. With seven decentralization support projects \ncurrently working within DoLA, there is a risk of balkanization into separate donor-led fiefdoms, as has happened in \nother  ministries  in  Cambodia.  This  arrangement  is  very  similar  to  that  which  worked  well  for  CCDP  (see \nAppendix 2). ", "14  \ncoordinator. Of the five MoI staff, four will be appointed from DoLA and one will be appointed \nfrom the OoCR. The four DoLA staff will be separately responsible for component 1, component \n3, project accounting and Local Finance issues. The staff from OoCR will be responsible for \ncomponent 2. The Project Manager with the support of the project administrator and coordinator \nwill lead project implementation and will prepare and submit reports to the project director, who \nwill in turn report to ADB; liaise with the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF); and ensure \nthat all Project activities are in line with ADB procedures and guidelines. The PTC will receive \nsupport from a team of consultants, consisting of a project team leader, an accountant, and a \nfew other national consultants.  \n \n41.  The project team leader will work closely with the project administrator and coordinator. \nComponent 1 will be implemented by commune and sangkat councils with support from DoLA \nand  the  component 1  consultant  team.  Component  2  will  be  implemented  by  OoCR,  with \nsupport from a long-term national consultant, the project team leader, the project administrator, \nthe DoLA project accountant, and consultant accountants. Component 2 implementation will be \ncoordinated throughout with the other civil registration partners: Plan International and the \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund. Component 3 will be implemented by CBO, with support from \ntwo full-time national consultants and one part-time international consultant.  \n \n  2.  Implementation Period \n \n42.  The Project implementation period is 2.5 years (30 months). The Project is expected to \nstart in January 2007, to be completed by 30 June 2009, and to be closed by 31 December \n2009.   \n \n  3.  Procurement \n \n43.  Civil  works,  goods,  and  related  services  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. Procurement of all equipment and services will be managed by the \nproject  administrator,  with  support  from  the  project  team  leader,  DoLA,  and  consultant \naccountants. Civil works and goods that relate to component 1 will use the same procedures \ndeveloped under CCDP. The facilities subsidy will be transferred as a block grant (an average \nof $19,500 for each commune) to each selected commune, and works will be procured through \nprocedures defined in the CCDP\u2019s Implementation Handbook (as amended from time to time) \nby the commune council procurement committee (within the limits of the fixed actual current \nlocal cost of the model design selected). All equipment, goods, and services that relate to \ncomponents 2 and 3 will be procured through national competitive bidding (NCB) if the value is \nequal to or more than $100,000 and through shopping if the value is less than $100,000. \nProcurement carried out through NCB will be in line with the Government\u2019s procurement manual \ndated 19 September 2005 for externally financed projects and programs in Cambodia. The \ndetailed procurement plan is in Appendix 7. \n \n  4.  Consulting Services \n \n44.  A total of 266 person-months of consulting services will be required: 25 person-months \nof  international  consultants  (9%)  and  241  person-months  of  national  consultants  (91%). \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  by  the  EA  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Supplementary Appendix A. \nThe consultants will have the following fields of expertise: engineering and architecture, capacity \ndevelopment, data management, accounting, gender mainstreaming, mass media, and impact \n ", " 15\nevaluation studies. Consultants for impact evaluation studies will be engaged through a firm \nusing the quality- and cost-based selection method. For other fields of expertise, consultants will \nbe recruited individually. For individual consultants, the EA will rank at least three consultants \nand recommend the highest-ranked individual to ADB. \n \n  5.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n45.  The Government was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) and policy relating \nto  the  combating  of  money  laundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require  the \nGovernment to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational best practice standards to prevent corruption or money-laundering activities or the \nfinancing of terrorism, and covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The \ndesign  of  the  Project benefited  from  an  audit  and  review  by  KPMG  of  the  CCDP  project \nmethodology,  including  a  review  of  financial  management,  procurement,  and  potential \ncorruption issues. As a result, the proposed Project contains a number of financial control \nmechanisms to minimize the risk of fund misappropriation or misuse, especially the potential \nrisks in component 1. The documentation and substantiation requirements of the Project will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. The \nsuccessful monitoring system of CCDP will be continued, including the matching of physical \ncompletion of each phase of construction (certified by the project team) with each account\u2019s \ndisbursement rate (through the monthly financial statements), with improvements recommended \nby a recent audit or review, for example, the centralization of all this information with the PTC by \nthe  Project\u2019s  accountant.  Annual  financial  audits  will  be  made,  and  financial  reporting \nmechanisms will be integrated with the MIS, in support of the quarterly reporting mechanisms. \nOther detailed anticorruption features include standardized quality- and cost-control measures \nand the use of a specialized team to inspect all construction phases (para. 19). \n \n  6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n46.  The Government will open a dollar imprest account for the project with the National Bank \nof Cambodia immediately after loan effectiveness. The account will be established, managed, \nreplenished,  and  liquidated  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2001),  as \namended from time to time. MEF will delegate the administration of this account to the EA. The \nadvance will be deposited into the imprest account on the basis of the projected expenditures \nfor the next 6 months, while maintaining an imprest account ceiling of 20% of the grant amount. \nStatement of expenditures (SoE) procedures may be used to liquidate and replenish the imprest \naccount for eligible expenditures not exceeding $80,000 for a single payment. For component 1, \nthe block-grant funds will be transferred directly from the imprest account to the commune \ncouncils\u2019 bank account, which will be opened by each of the commune councils at private \ncommercial bank local branches located nearest their commune.16 For components 2 and 3, \n                                                 \n16 Similar to what was agreed on for the second batch of 95 commune facilities under CCDP. The letter, Reference \nNo. 5260, dated 24 August 2005, addressed to the deputy prime minister and co-minister of MoI from His \nExcellency Keat Chon, Finance Minister, requested the opening of a commune account at the ACLEDA Bank for \nthe construction of the commune offices under CCDP/ADB Loan No.: 1953-CAM (SF). The MEF agreed in \nprinciple to the request of MoI. If a unified funds flow mechanism is decreed by the Government as a result of its ", "16  \ndisbursements will be made from the imprest account to contractors and implementors. The \nimprest  account  and  SoE  records  will  be  audited  during  the  annual  audit  process.  These \narrangements will be described in detail in the project administration manual (PAM).  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n47.  The  DoLA  project  accountant  will  be  trained  and  mentored  by  a  full-time  national \nconsultant  accountant.  Working  together,  the  DoLA  project  accountant  and  the  consultant \naccountant  will  be  responsible  for  maintaining  all  Project  accounts,  documenting  local \nexpenditure, and preparing quarterly and annual financial reports. These will be approved by the \nproject manager and the project director and submitted to ADB. Accounting for the Project will \nbe separate from other financial accounts of MoI. The accounting system will be according to \nthe  Financial  Management  Manual  issued  by  MEF  in  September  2006.  Audits  of  project \naccounts  will  be  carried  out  by  international  audit  companies  established  in  Cambodia, \naccording  to  international  financial  reporting  standards  and  international  audit  standards.17 \nCertified copies of the annual audits will be submitted to ADB, in English, within 9 months after \nthe close of each year (in view of the scattered nature of component 1, a reporting period of less \nthan 9 months would be unrealistic). The independent external auditing services will be financed \nfrom the grant proceeds. DoLA will draft quarterly and annual progress reports on project \nimplementation, with support from the project team leader and other consultants, for the project \nmanager and project director, and ADB. The quarterly and annual progress reports will be \nsubmitted to ADB and MEF within 30 days of the end of each quarter. Project staff will draft a \nproject completion  report  for  submission to  the  project  manager  and  project  director.  This \ncompletion report will be submitted to ADB not later than 3 months after the physical completion \nof the Project. \n \n  8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n48.  The quarterly and annual reports will accord with the indicators for the outcomes and \noutputs specified in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 4). They will be as concise \nand factual as possible, and in a format acceptable to ADB.18 These reports will also monitor the \nsignificant risk for outcomes of the design and monitoring framework. The Project will lay down \nan  analytical  framework  and  a  data  collection  mechanism  for  an  impact  evaluation  of  its \ncommune council facilities component to be undertaken at a later date.19 The baseline survey \nwill be conducted at the start of the Project and a repeat survey will be conducted at project \ncompletion. ADB will work with DoLA to develop a specific design of the surveys. This data- \ncollection mechanism will be funded under the Project.  \n                                                                                                                                                          \npublic financial management reform, this disbursement arrangement may be reviewed by both the Government \nand ADB. \n17 CCDP was audited by KPMG in 2003 and 2004. Neither the audit reports nor the management letters for both \nyears raised any matters of significant concern in terms of the Project\u2019s financial management, procurement, \naccounting, or record keeping systems, or compliance with required procedures. The audit for 2005 is ongoing.  \n18 These reports will cover: factual information on progress against target (sex-disaggregated where appropriate), \ntechnical and financial; brief written commentary on progress against target, including note of any problems \nencountered during the quarter; remedial measures taken or proposed; and activities proposed for the following \nquarter. \n19 The evaluation method will combine the methods of propensity score matching and double differences, using \ncommune and household data. The data will be collected through surveys designed in three stages (province, \ncommune, and household) with sample households stratified by poverty level (poorest, middle income, and richest) \nselected from each sampled commune. The total sample will comprise 100 project communes and 100 nonproject \ncommunes, with 15 households to be surveyed in each sampled commune. \n ", " 17\n \n9.  Project Review \n \n49.  About 15 months after Project start-up, around March 2008, an MTR will be carried out \nby  ADB  and  the  Government.  The  MTR  will  identify  changes  since  appraisal;  assess \nimplementation  performance;  review  compliance  with  covenants  and  assurances;  identify \nproblems and constraints; and make recommendations. The recommendations will include the \nuse  and  allocation  of  the  contingencies  budget  line.  One  person-month  of  international \nconsulting services and 1 person-month of national consulting services have been budgeted \nunder the Project for the MTR. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n50.    A TA grant will be provided and implemented simultaneously with the Project. The TA \nis estimated to cost $236,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $200,000 equivalent, to be funded \nfrom the Gender and Development Cooperation Fund, which is administered by ADB. The will \nbe support the advancement of gender equity in local governance. It will strengthen the capacity \nof  elected  women  councilors  and  WCFPs  in  six  target  provinces  by  activating  women \nnetworking  forums  within  districts  and  communes.  The  forums  will  provide  women  with \nopportunities  to  share  their  experience  and  self-learning,  promote  mutual  support  and \nnetworking, build confidence, increase visibility, and improve work performance. A qualified \nnational  nongovernment  organization,  the  Women  for  Prosperity,  will  be  recruited  through \nsingle-source selection for a period not exceeding 18 months to implement the TA activities (see \nAppendix 8 for the justification). The services are expected to begin in the second half of 2007, \nor 3 months after the Project takes effect, and to be completed 1 year later, in 2008. Equipment, \nsupplies,  and  materials  under  the  TA  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines. The detailed TA description and cost estimates are in Appendix 8. The EA will be \nDoLA.   \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits \n \n51.  The Project will enable local administration to function effectively and increase civil \nsociety\u2019s participation in local public affairs. The benefits of component 1 are an extension of \nthose  already  evident  for  519  commune  councils,  as  described  in  the  CCDP  review  of \nMarch 2006. Benefits will accrue to different groups. First, elected councilors and the clerk in the \nprioritized communes will benefit from having working space, storage, and meeting rooms of \ndifferent sizes. This is in sharp contrast to the current norm of councilors variously attempting to \nrun council business from a wooden shack, pagoda, school, or the chief\u2019s house. Second, \nnational and provincial officials needing to work in a beneficiary commune will have appropriate \nmeeting facilities, at a universally familiar location, at their disposal. Most importantly, the whole \npopulation  of  Cambodia  will  benefit  through  the  powerful  physical  symbol  which  the  new \npremises  provide,  and  the  extent  to  which  this  contributes  to  firmly  embedding  the  new \ninstitution of local democracy in Cambodia. The use of traditional Khmer-style architecture, \ncoupled with the familiar symbols of peace and prosperity (as used on the National Assembly \nbuildings), conveys the significance and status of the local democratic process.  \n \n52.  The  benefit  of  component  2  is  its  contribution  to  providing  Cambodia  with  another \nessential piece of state-building infrastructure: a modern computerized CR system. This will be ", "18  \nof benefit to the whole population over time. It will provide households with the documentation \nnecessary to prove citizenship, place of origin, parentage, age, marital status, inheritance, and \nentitlement to land and property. Women will particularly benefit from the legal foundation for \nmarriage, divorce, property rights, inheritance, and parentage. Children will benefit through the \nability to establish age, parentage, and place of origin. Cambodia will benefit from having up-to-\ndate information on citizenship and improved data on demographic trends. Over time, this \nsystem is expected to be merged with, and simplify, current systems of household books and \nidentity cards. This component will help conserve and build on the remarkable achievement of \nthe past 3 years: the very successful, first-ever CR (births, death, and marriage formalization) \nprocess. \n \n53.  The training fund will directly benefit new and previously elected commune councilors, \nas well as clerks. PLAUs and other officials will benefit from modern, cost-effective training in \nbasic concepts of local democracy and accountabilities, and in the key tasks they are expected \nto perform. More efficient, aware, and committed commune councils will bring benefits to their \nelectors. Considering the evaluation evidence from CCDP component 2, the 24-month mass \nmedia  campaign  will  benefit  most  of  the  population  by  introducing or  reinforcing  essential \ndemocratic  concepts  and  practices.  Not  yet  firmly  defined  and  embedded  in  popular \nconsciousness are critical concepts such as legitimate opposition, elector rights, voluntarism in \ncouncil  operations,  the  respective  roles  and  legitimacy  of  councilors  and  officials,  greater \nrecognition of gender equality issues, strengthened capacity of women to serve more effectively \nin the commune councils, the functions of the different council committees, the relationship \nbetween the chief and other council members, the appropriate role of political parties, and the \nrelationship  between  the  council  and  provincial  line  departments.  The  population  will  also \nbenefit from the information provided about the role of local councils in direct service delivery \nand local development.   \n \n54.  The  combined  outcome  of  the  three  components  of  this  Project\u2014enabling  more \ncommune councils to operate effectively, developing the national CR system, and strengthening \nrelated  capacities\u2014will  be  a  further  strengthening  of  the  institutions  of  open,  participatory \ndemocracy  on  which  poverty  reduction,  human,  and  gender  rights  depend.  The  ultimate \nbeneficiaries  will  be  the  whole  population  and  the  development  process  in  Cambodia. \nCommune democracy has unequivocally been the most important development since 1993 in \ndeepening  democratization  within  Cambodia,  moving  the  country  away  from  its  historically \nhierarchic, centralized, and elite-dominated past. The anticipated creation of indirectly elected \ndistrict and provincial councils (elected by commune councils) means that the new institution of \ncommune democracy will shortly begin to affect other subnational tiers and thus most service \ndelivery in Cambodia. The potential benefits of greater popular voice and accountability over \nresources and services for provinces and districts are substantial. \n \n55.  Environment and Social Safeguards. The Project does not envisage any adverse \nenvironmental effect from the construction of the new commune council facilities. Based on \nADB\u2019s Operations Manual, Section F1, an environmental impact assessment at the level of \ninitial environmental examination is not required. The Project will comply with the applicable \ngovernment requirements for building, safety, and sanitary permits, and with the building code. \nThe Project will not have any resettlement impact. For component 1, as part of the criteria for \nblock-grant approval, commune councils will be required to confirm that the land used for the \nfacilities is registered in their ownership, and not being used or occupied for economic or \nresidential purposes. These undertakings will be checked by the three supervising contracted \n ", " 19\narchitect engineers during their initial site visits, according to the appropriate screening criteria \nfor land selection, review, and clearance procedures to be included in the PAM. No land \nacquisition or resettlement is required for components 2 and 3 of the Project. \n \nB.  Risks \n \n56.   Several sources of risk can be identified. Corruption is one of these. Construction funds \ncould be misused, materials could be defective or of poor quality, and substandard designs \ncould be applied. This risk will be mitigated by the project design, which establishes a rigorous \nquality specification and control, including an operations manual for constructors; quality checks \nbefore, during, and after construction by a permanent project team created for this purpose; by \nthe specification of standardized designs to facilitate cost monitoring and control; by very tight \ncost  margins,  which  minimize  opportunities  to  overstate  costs;  and  by  the  moral  suasion \nresulting from the high status accorded to construction of commune council buildings under the \nProject. \n \n57.  There is also the risk that capacity of local administration will still be weak by the time \nthe  responsibilities  and  resources  are  turned  over,  or  that  the  commune  councils  are  not \nresponsive enough to their constituents\u2019 needs. The capacity development component of this \nproject,  in  conjunction  with  diverse  activities  of  other  development  partners,  is  aimed  at \nmitigating capacity gaps. The final risk will be mitigated by the public awareness campaign \nfunded by the Project, by the actions of other donors, and by the competitive political process at \nthe local level, which is expected to make local officials more sensitive to the needs of their \ncommunities because of electoral accountability. \n \n58.  There is a risk as well that the process of D&D is either mismanaged or not fully \nimplemented. Further, there is the risk that even when functions are transferred, adequate \nresources  will  not  be  provided  and  local  governments  will  therefore  remain  weak.  This \nuncertainty goes beyond the scope of this project, but is partly mitigated by the Government\u2019s \ncommitment to its reform agenda, as evidenced most recently by the preparation of the draft \nOrganic law for Deconcentration and Decentralization and the preparation of an implementation \nframework  for  this  purpose.  This  risk  is  further  mitigated  by  the  participation  of  other \ndevelopment partners working with the Government to address key implementation issues. As \nbefore, there is always the risk of possible capture of the local government by the rich and \npowerful,  or  of  local  councils  not  operating  openly  and  democratically.  However,  available \nassessments perceive a positive effect of local democratic processes in reducing the risk of elite \ncapture and financial abuse. Local development projects appear to be free from elite capture \nand are seen to benefit the majority rather than the few. The public does not see their councils \nas adversely affected by partisan politics, although more than one third of councilors do.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n59.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the Ministry of Interior have \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n ", "20  \n(i)  The  Government  will  provide  its  counterpart  contributions  for  the  Project \nimplementation on time and ensure prompt availability of the contribution during \neach year of project implementation. \n(ii)  The Government and MoI will ensure that only commune councils listed as \npriority in the provincial listing, prepared based on the formula-based needs and \npriority assessment as agreed between the Government and ADB will receive \nfunding under component 1. \n(iii)  The  Government  and  MoI  will  ensure  that  the  arrangements  agreed  under \nCCDP, whereby commune councils can use a special account maintained with a \nprivate  commercial  bank  for  managing  their  block  grant  transfers,  will  be \ncontinued for this project. \n(iv)  To  ensure  the  smooth  transfer  of  the  block  grants  to  each  of  the  selected \ncommune  councils,  immediately  upon  approval  of  the  block  grants  and  the \nsigning  of  the  Block  Grant  Agreement,  each  of  the  commune  councils  will \nestablish a bank account at a local branch of a commercial bank acceptable to \nADB. \n(v)  The  Government  and  MoI  will  ensure  that  each  of  the  commune  councils \nimplementing activities under component 1 will be responsible for ensuring that \nthe  Government\u2019s  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy (2002), and best environmental practices are incorporated into all project \ndesigns and implementation.  \n(vi)  The Government and MoI will not approve any block grant that entails land \nacquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement  including  land  donation.  They  will  not \napprove  any  block  grant  that  involves  involuntary  resettlement  according  to \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). To be eligible for block grants \nthe commune councils are required to confirm that the land used for the facilities \nis titled and registered in their ownership, and not being used or occupied for \neconomic or residential purposes. These undertakings will be checked by the \ncontracted architect engineers during their initial site visits. \n(vii)  To ensure that women benefit equally from the Project and interventions avoid \ngender bias, the Government and MoI will ensure that the Project will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998). The \nGovernment will further ensure that the agreed gender action plan (GAP) for this \nProject is implemented in a timely manner over the entire project period, and that \nadequate resources are allocated for this purpose. Implementation of the GAP \nwill be closely monitored, and the progress will be reported in the quarterly \nreports to ADB. \n(viii)  The  Government  and  MoI  will  ensure  that  the  Department  of  General \nAdministration Office of Civil Registration will recruit additional and sufficient \nnumber  of  young  and  educated  male  and  female  staff,  with  a  minimum  of \nuniversity education, to be trained to manage the computerized civil registration \ndatabase in perpetuity. \n(ix)  Although  the  Project  does  not  envisage  any  adverse  impact  on  indigenous \npeoples, the Recipient and MoI will ensure that the Project will be prepared and \nimplemented in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), in \norder to increase the quality and access of information through the mass media \nactivities received by indigenous peoples. \n \n \n ", " 21\nB.  Conditions for Grant Effectiveness \n \n60.  Prior to loan effectiveness, the following will have been completed: \n \n(i)  The director general of MoI\u2019s General Department of Local Administration will \nhave been appointed as the project director; \n(ii)  The director of DoLA will have been appointed as the project manager; \n(iii)  A senior staff from DoLA will have been appointed as the project administrator \nand coordinator; and \n(iv)  The  project  technical  cell  (PTC)  consisting  of  the  project  director,  project \nmanager, project administrator and coordinator and five other staff of MoI will \nhave been established. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n61.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, recommend that the Board \napprove a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $7,800,000 to the Kingdom of Cambodia from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, on terms and conditions substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the Board, for the Commune Council \nDevelopment Project 2. \n \n \n \n \n                Liqun Jin \n                Vice President \n \n \n \n14 November 2006", "22  Appendix 1 \nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n1.  Overview. Cambodia is traditionally a centralized society. The long-term institutional \nreform process of decentralization and deconcentration (D&D) of public decision making and \nservices delivery was started in 2001 with the creation of the commune councils, and with the \ndirect elections for these councils in February 2002. This process has been the single most \nsignificant  state-building  development  since  the  1993  Constitution.  It  is  implicitly  aimed  at \nstrengthening three key conditions of state effectiveness: organizational design, structure of the \npolitical system, and legitimization. Draft legislation (Organic\u2014or constitutional\u2014Law) to reform \nthe entire subnational state structure (provinces, districts, and communes in rural areas and \nmunicipalities; khans and sangkats in urban areas) is now being reviewed within government \nand  is  expected  to  be  submitted  to  the  National  Assembly  in  2007.  This  draft  legislation \nanticipates the formation of new councils, elected by commune councilors, in provinces and \ndistricts, and the progressive devolution of responsibility for delivering major services from line \nministries to \u201cunified administrations\u201d in provinces and districts. Important new opportunities thus \nopen up for increased accountability through greater democratic scrutiny of service provision.1 \n \n2.  Subnational Structure. After the Paris peace talks in 1991, Cambodia\u2019s new 1993 \nConstitution created a national structure of administration comprising 20 provinces with 171 \ndistricts, and four municipalities (Phnom Penh, Kep, Pailin, and Sihanoukville) with 14 khans. At \nthe lowest tier of state administration are the commune and sangkat. Cambodia has 1,621 \ncommunes and sangkats. Of these, 1,510 are (mostly rural) communes in the 20 provinces, and \n111 are urban sangkats in the municipalities, most of them in Phnom Penh.2 Until 2002, all \nthese subnational entities were run by appointed governors, accountable upward to the Ministry \nof Interior (MoI). Public services are delivered by vertically accountable line ministries, with \nminimal operational linkage with the provincial, district, or commune authorities. \n \n3.  Elected  Commune  Councils  and  Functions. Elections for the first 5-year council \nmandate were held in February 2002. The second mandate commune and sangkat council \nelections will be in April 2007.3 The electoral system specified in the commune election law is a \nparty-slate system, which ensures that councilors from different political parties are represented \non  each  council,  and  learn  to  work  together.  In  terms  of  mandated  responsibilities,  the \nCommune Administration Act 2001 gave councils \u201clocal affairs\u201d duties to maintain security and \npublic order; manage public services; promote welfare, economic, and social development; \nprotect and conserve the environment; and promote tolerance and mutual understanding. The \n2002 subdecree decentralizing powers, roles, and duties to commune and sangkat councils set \nout two roles for them: to \u201cpromote and facilitate the development of the commune-sangkat by \ninvoking assistance, and mobilizing capacities\u201d (article 11); and to \u201cpromote and coordinate the \n                                                 \n1  The ongoing enactment of supporting legal framework for this lowest level of local administration is moving in \ntandem with the conceptualization of the decentralization and deconcentration program. The preparatory and initial \nstage of this long-term process will run through 2007\u20132008, with major tasks being the establishment of the \nimplementation authority, and its structures, systems, and procedures. A transition phase, from 2009 to 2012, will \nthen expand the concrete transfer of basic national and subnational functions, duties, and resources.  \n2  The average commune or sangkat had about 8,000 residents in 1998. However, there is a large variance around \nthat average: 35% of communes and sangkat had fewer than 5,000 people, while 20% had more than 10,000. \nThere is a similarly large variance in the size of districts and provinces. The number of districts varies from 5 in \nMondolkiri to 16 in Kampong Cham. The number of communes varies from 21 in Mondolkiri, where communes are \nparticularly large and thinly populated, to 173 in Kampong Cham. \n3  Instead of a state-appointed chief, communes and sangkats are now managed by a chief who is the elected leader \nof a multiparty council with 5 to 11 members, depending on the size of the commune. Of the 11,261 commune and \nsangkat councilors elected in February 2002, 8.5% are female and about 10.2% are from ethnic minorities. They \nare elected for a 5-year term and receive a small monthly stipend from government. \n ", "Appendix 1  23\nprocess of democracy in the commune-sangkat\u201d (article 12). However, the powers provided by \nboth the act and the sub-decree are essentially discretionary and supplementary, since councils \nare not responsible for the delivery of major services and have highly constrained human and \nfinancial resources.4      \n \n4.  Commune Council Resources. Only one member of the council staff, the council clerk, \nis an MoI employee.5 The council\u2019s main revenue source is a formula-based allocation from the \nCommune Fund, established by Government in the 2001 legislation. The average commune \nallocation from the Commune Fund is $12,000 a year for each commune. Two thirds of this \namount is for commune development (in practice, mainly small-scale rural infrastructure) and \none third is for the council\u2019s administrative costs.6 Option studies for increasing local revenue \nare under way, although current indications are that the buoyant forms of revenue may become \navailable only in urban areas over the medium term. Local taxes on agricultural land and \nproduction have been effectively ruled out for the foreseeable future.    \n \n5.  Commune Council Performance. The most comprehensive independent study to date \nis that commissioned by the Asia Foundation7 over April to June 2004. This study canvassed \nperceptions of 1,416 voter-age citizens and 708 councilors across the country. The study found \nthat citizens are generally satisfied with the performance of their councils, and that commune \nperformance had improved after the introduction of elected councils.8 Overall, the study was \npositive about the growing role, mandate, and competence of councils, and the local democratic \nprocess and functioning.   \n \n6.  Government\u2019s Management and Commitment. From 2001, support to this process \nwas  managed  by  the  National  Committee  for  Support  to  Communes-Sangkats  (NCSC), \nestablished by Royal Decree. NCSC was chaired by MoI, and the NCSC secretariat was the \nMoI\u2019s Department of Local Administration. Government commitment to D&D has continued to \n                                                 \n4  In practice, the small average size of communes means that councils are relatively close to the people and \ncouncilors  have  come  to  play  a  major  role  in  local  dispute  resolution  (notably  over  land  and  the  local \nimplementation of the 2001 Land Law, and over intra- and interfamily difficulties). Councils\u2019 role in maintaining local \nharmony has become increasingly significant, tending to replace the traditional role of the village chief. All \ncommunes have been involved in planning, allocating, and implementing local infrastructure and other rural \ndevelopment investments financed from the development portion of the Commune Fund. Councils have formal \ndelegated responsibility for two important whole-population services: civil registration (of births, deaths, and \nmarriages) and maintenance of the electoral roll. \n5  The clerks were recruited by MoI in 2001 in an impressive process designed to ensure that only younger, well-\neducated staff were engaged. Councils\u2019 have minor fee-based income. \n6  The government procedures and provincial and district support arrangements for planning, procurement, and \nfinancial management of the development part of the Commune Fund were developed under the Seila Program, \nbased  in  the  Council  for  the  Development  of  Cambodia  (responsible  for  donor  resource  mobilization  and \ncoordination). Seila has been very important to the success of subnational reform by attracting donor resources to \nsupplement  the  Commune  Fund;  attracting  similar  funds  for  use  by  provincial  and  district  authorities;  and \nmaintaining provincial and district delivery capacity. \n7  Ninh, Kim and Roger Henke. 2005. Commune Councils in Cambodia: A National Survey on their Functions and \nPerformance. Phnom Penh: The Asia Foundation. May.  \n8  Citizens are aware of commune council functions. Local development projects appear to be free from elite capture \nand are seen to benefit the majority rather than the few, although there are concerns over the transparency of \ncouncil  planning  and  budgeting  committees.  Roads  and  schools  are  the  most  commonly  desired  local \ndevelopments. There  is  concern  that  councils  are  not  sufficiently  active  or  empowered  to  manage  natural \nresources. The public does not see their councils as adversely affected by partisan politics, but more than one third \nof councilors do. The study found that dispute mediation is the main councilor activity, other than administrative \ntasks. Local conflicts involving youth gangs, land, and domestic conflict are common, and commune councilors are \nnow as likely to be involved in dispute resolution as village chiefs. Three quarters of the public and 95% of \ncouncilors say that locally mediated dispute resolutions are respected, although problems of corruption, nepotism, \npartiality, and lack of knowledge and resources among councilors are seen as continuing problems. ", "24  Appendix 1 \nstrengthen since 2001 and features prominently in published plans and priorities.9 In August \n2006,  a  Royal  Decree  establishing  the  National  Committee  for  the  Management  of \nDecentralization  and  Deconcentration  Reform  (NCDD)  was  issued.  NCDD  takes  over  and \ncontinues the work of the NCSC, formerly also responsible for decentralization; of the Inter-\nMinisterial  Committee  created  in  2004  to  oversee  the  development  of  wider D&D  reforms \nconcerning provinces and districts; and of the Seila Task Force interministerial committee, \nresponsible for the Seila Program.  \n \n7.  Donor  Support  Arrangements.  The  pattern  of  donor  support  for  subnational \nadministration in Cambodia has had a contentious history and has caused significant difficulties \nboth for the Government and for the concerned donors. The core problem has been one of \ncompeting  power  centers  within  government,  each  resourced  and  incentivized  by  different \ndonors. In essence, since 1980, MoI has had clear responsibility for the subnational structure of \ngovernment.  In  parallel,  however,  the  successor  to  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme\u2019s (UNDP\u2019s) CARERE rehabilitation program, the interministerial Seila task force \nchaired  by  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance,  and  its  Seila  Program\u2014including  the \nsecretariat  based  in  the  Council  for  the  Development  of  Cambodia  (CDC)  and  its \nimplementation network in all provinces\u2014has developed high capacity and innovative drive in \nrelation to subnational affairs, in large part from the major donor resources it has been able to \nattract. Key political decisions over 2005\u20132006 led to the reassertion of MoI\u2019s responsibility for \nsubnational affairs; the June 2005 Strategic Framework for reform; and the drafting of the \nOrganic Law and the August 2006 Royal Decree, which, among other elements, confirms the \nabolition and merging of the Seila Program. The resolution of the historic tensions in donor \nsupport  to  subnational  administration  is  now  clearly  in  view.  The  approach  set  out  in  the \nstrategic framework was presented to donors at the Eighth Consultative Group meeting in \nMarch 2006. An independent study of donor support to subnational administration, begun in late \n2005, was submitted to the Government in April 2006. The Government responded at the end of \nMay, specifying that donors would be required to approve a \u201cgovernment-donor agreement on \nsupport  for  D&D,\u201d  but  could  channel  support  flexibly  through:  the  central  implementation \nauthority (after the approval of the Organic Law), the line ministries, basket funding, or specific \nproject arrangements. In September 2006, the indications were that the Seila Program would \nformally  end  in  2006,  but  that  the  key  functions  it  provides\u2014notably  in  planning  and \nmanagement of commune, district, and provincial funds\u2014would continue, but reporting to MoI \nand the NCDD.  \n \n8.  ADB Support. ADB and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GTZ) \n(and part of UNDP) are the only agencies providing support through MoI rather than through Seila and \nCDC. The Commune Council Development Project and the Commune Council Development Project 2 \nare both clearly focused on supporting the commune councils. The correct Executing Agency for that \npurpose was, and remains, MoI. The outcome of the developments since mid-2005 is that donors \nwishing to continue to support subnational administration will also be required do so through MoI and \nNCDD, and that donor harmonization will be achieved around the legally mandated government entity. \n                                                 \n9  Notably in the governance action plan; the National Poverty Reduction Strategy; the July 2004 Rectangular \nStrategy for Growth, Employment, Equity, and Efficiency; and the National Strategic Development Plan for 2006\u2013\n2010. The recent changes following the publication of the June 2005 Strategic Framework for Decentralization and \nDeconcentration Reforms (Strategic Framework) leave no doubt about government leadership in reforming the \nsubnational structure of governance. The Strategic Framework set out a four-phase implementation plan for \ndemocratic subnational reform: a preparatory phase leading to the adoption of the new local government legislation \n(the Organic Law), followed by initial, transition, and transformation phases for implementing the new law over the \nfollowing decade. \n ", "   Appendix 2  25 \nREVIEW OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMMUNE COUNCIL DEVELOPMENT \nPROJECT (MARCH 2006) AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PHASE II \n \n1.  This  appendix  provides  a  short  summary  of  the  review  of  the  performance  of  the \nCommune Council Development Project (CCDP) through 31 March  2006, and enumerates the \nimplications for the design of a second-phase project. The review was made by the project \npreparatory technical assistance design team in April 2006 and is presented in Supplementary \nAppendix  C.  CCDP  has  not  been  formally  reviewed  since  the  midterm  review  (MTR)  in \nNovember 2004. The results of the MTR, and of the two Asian Development Bank (ADB) review \nmissions in June and November 2005, were also considered during this review.  \n \nA.  The Commune Council Development Project \n \n2.  Following  identification  in  late  2001  and  preparation  during  2002,  the  ADB  Board \napproved financing for the Government\u2019s CCDP on 3 December 2002. The Project supports the \ndevelopment of democratic local government in Cambodia. The Project is executed by the \nMinistry of Interior (MoI) through its Department of Local Administration (DoLA). It is externally \nfinanced  by  ADB  ($10  million  loan),  the  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation \nAgency  ($3  million  grant1),  and  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands  ($2.4  million).  The \nGovernment contribution is $2 million in kind. The Project has four components: commune \nfacilities; capacity building; photo mapping, and civil registration (CR). The loan took effect on \n13 March 2003. The estimated completion date is now December 2006. \n \nB.  Component 1-1: Commune Facilities \n \n3.  The purpose of this component was to consolidate the introduction of local democracy in \nCambodia by providing distinctive, cost-effective \u201ccommune-parliament\u201d buildings to larger and \npoorer rural communes with poor council premises or none. In line with the perceived need for a \nsingle nationally recognizable style for local government premises, the component\u2019s contracted \narchitects developed a model office design that was distinctively Khmer, with a covered area for \nlarge meetings and four small offices for councilors, small meetings, and safekeeping of council \ndocuments and equipment. The buildings were designed to be a culturally meaningful symbol of \nlocal democracy, and to engender civic pride and support for the councils and the democratic \nprocess on which they are founded (Report and Recommendation of the President [RRP], para. \n71). Commune councils were required to select a plot of land for the new facility, which was \ncentrally located in the commune, and which was not currently occupied, legally or illegally. The \nsite selection and absence of any occupancy was checked by the project engineers during their \ninitial visit. No problems in relation to the non-occupancy requirement were found in any of the \n519 communes included in this component. The component is implemented by one DoLA staff \nmember, four contracted national architects and engineers, and one part-time international \ntechnical assistance (TA) consultant. Commune eligibility was determined through a needs \nassessment and prioritization formula including terms for commune population, poverty rating, \nand the existence of a commune office and its condition.2 The component uses an innovative \n                                                 \n1  The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency grant was increased to $3.57 million following the \nMTR in November 2004. \n2  The four municipalities are excluded from C1-1: the eligible councils are those in the 20 rural provinces (RRP \npara. 16). Commune councils select from three model designs (for dry land, on pillars for flood-prone areas, or a \nwooden model for mountainous provinces). Councils are free to make further minor modifications around the \nstandard model chosen. Commune councils are responsible for selecting their own supervising technician, for local ", "26  Appendix 2 \n(for Cambodia and ADB) block-grant transfer mechanism. The use of model designs with known \nquantities of materials and labor enables transfers of the actual local-price cost of the building \nselected  (plus  7% contractor  overhead)  to  the  commune  account,  held  with  the  provincial \ntreasury (and now with ACLEDA Bank). Payments are withdrawn by the contractor in stages (up \nto 11), according to progress achieved. The average construction time is 6 months. In total, the \nProject is financing the construction of new council offices in 519 communes.  \n \n4.  Assessment and Implications for Phase II. Several insights of this review are of direct \nrelevance to Phase II: \n \n(i)  Commune-level interviews from the field survey and other visits indicate that the \nbuildings are making a significant contribution both to consolidating the status \nand reputation of elected councils, and to creating a more appropriate working \nenvironment. Ninety-five percent of councils (54 out of 57) interviewed in the field \nsurvey said the office accommodation is appropriate to their needs.3 Eighty-two \npercent of offices (47 out of 57) are used every day, and all at least twice a week. \nEven skeptics of this subcomponent during the 2002 design phase now agree \nthat \u201cplace\u201d matters in consolidating a new institution, and appreciate the value-\nfor-money of this component.   \n(ii)  There is strong support for this component from the Ministry of Interior (MoI) and \nfrom the highest level of government. \n(iii)  Further evidence of the relevance and appropriateness of the distinctive Khmer \ndesign comes from the growing imitation of the design for new sangkat buildings \nby Phnom Penh Municipality, and by the Cambodia People\u2019s Party in at least two \nprovinces.  \n(iv)  The  construction  quality  is  consistently  high,  as  a  result  of  high  council \nownership, rigorous independent inspections, and popular awareness that poor-\nquality work has to be replaced before certification. The field survey assessed \nthat for the 57 councils with offices, none of the works was of poor quality. Just \nover half (30 out of 57) were assessed as excellent, scoring over 75%, and the \nbalance  were  assessed  as  (scoring  between  50%  and  75%)  but  with  some \nweaknesses, usually in finishing or painting. In terms of sustainability, the field \nsurvey found that 70% of councils with new offices (40 out of 57) have included a \nmaintenance item in the council budget. \n(v)  The methodology adopted has generated high ownership by the council, evident \nin  council  views,  the  building  quality  achieved,  and  the  additional  features \n(commonly  latrines,  boundary  walls,  tiles,  murals,  plants)  added  with  local \nresources, by the majority of councils. This ownership is of course the pivotal \nfactor determining the future operation and maintenance of the building.  \n(vi)  The rate of implementation has been high, because of the innovative block-grant \ntransfer methodology. The main constraint has been the 10% imprest limit in the \nLoan Agreement.4 \n                                                                                                                                                          \ntendering, and for all stages of construction, guided by the comprehensive Implementation Handbook developed by \nthe CCDP component 1 team. \n3  Some councils are concerned that the open-plan concept in the model design makes use of the large room difficult \nin stormy weather. This issue was discussed at length, by the National Committee for Support to Commune-\nSangkat Councils (NCSC) among others, during the preparation of the model designs. The consensus was that the \n\u201ctransparent operation\u201d design concept should override the bad-weather benefits of a closed structure. \n4  ADB procedures are flexible with respect to the allowable imprest advance (ADB. 2001. Loan Disbursement \nHandbook. Manila, page 38, para. 10.10). There is a strong case for a higher advance for phase II, which would \nfurther speed up the rate of implementation. \n ", "   Appendix 2  27 \n(vii)  The economy of the buildings is high, as a result of determining each commune\u2019s \nblock grant by pricing actual quantities at local prices.  \n(viii)  The  reports  on  the  project  audits  (by  KPMG)  in  2003  and  2004  expressed \ncomplete satisfaction with the methodology adopted.5   \n(ix)  The efficiency of the subcomponent is high, with just four full-time contracted \narchitects supervising works across the whole country. \n(x)  The principal agent, contractual, nature of the subcomponent is appropriate for \nrelations between different tiers of elected government.

Component 1-2: Communications and Component 4 Procurement \n \n5.  By March 2006, 15 provinces had been covered under this component, with installation \nwork ongoing in Pursat, Kratie, Mondolkiri, Preah Vihear, and Prey Veng. Most of the equipment \nhad  been  procured  and  distributed,  and  installation  of  the  province-district-commune  radio \nnetwork was ongoing. Repeaters are being installed in four provinces to enable communes to \nconnect directly to the province. A combined total of $42,233 (under the commune and district \nradio contracts) had yet to be disbursed, pending the satisfactory completion of the network. \nOverall, the contractor\u2019s performance was adequate.  \n \n6.  The results of the field survey showed that all the communes that were scheduled to \nreceive a radio (51 out of 51) had received one. Of the 51 radios, 30 were base-station radios \nand 21 were mobile handset radios. Eighty-four percent (43 out of 51) are in good working \norder.  Sixty-eight  percent  (35  out  of  51)  of  the  councils  that  received  radios  can  now \ncommunicate readily with the province, and 82% (42 out of 51) with the district. Some radios are \nnot operating because of ongoing work on the system, the short-battery life of some mobile \nradios, or some lightning damage. Of the councils with working radio communications, 69% (29 \nout of 42) say they use it every day, and 93% (39 out of 42) at least twice per week. \n \n7.  All  43  of  the  communes  visited  that  were  scheduled  to  receive  a  motorcycle  had \nreceived one. All except one motorcycle are in good working order. In 70% (30 out of 43) of the \nvisited  councils  that  received  motorcycles,  the  bike  is variously  used  by  the  chief,  other \ncouncilors, and the clerk. In 28% (12 out of 43), the bike is used only by the chief. The councils \nthat did not receive a motorcycle are anxious to have one. All communes visited (106 out of \n106) had received a typewriter. In 85% of these communes (90 out of 106), the typewriter is \nused by the clerk or the councilors (or all of them). The typewriter is used at least twice a week \nin 71% of the communes (75 out of 106), and every day in just under half of the communes \n(51106). However, maintenance and spare-part problems were reported by almost two fifths of \nthe councils (41 out of 106). In communes close to conurbations, councils commonly prefer to \nuse local computer shops rather than their typewriters.       \n \n8.  Assessment and Implications for Phase II. The relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, \nand benefits of the equipment provided are good overall. Overall, the equipment procurement \nprogram has undoubtedly enhanced local government functioning. There is clearly no need to \n                                                 \n5  Both the 2003 and 2004 audit reports and management letters raise no matters of significant concern on any \nCCDP procedure or component. ", "28  Appendix 2 \nrepeat much of the phase I equipment procurement (radios, cupboards, typewriters, provincial \nlocal administration unit [PLAU] furniture) in phase II. Only 21% of communes (325 out of 1,510, \nexcluding sangkats) were supplied with motorcycles and the prime equipment demand for \nphase II is for more council motorcycles. The evidence from the field survey is that, if funds \nallow it, a second batch of motorcycles would be well used by the recipient councils. \n \nD.  Component 1-3: Provincial Facilities \n \n9.  The Project aimed to refurbish PLAU offices in five provinces. This subcomponent is \ncompleted and all facilities have been handed over. The renovations are appreciated by the \nstaff  and  the  provincial  authorities  concerned.  All  PLAUs  now  have  broadly  adequate \naccommodation. \n \nE.  Component 2-1: Training Fund \n \n10.  The project budget allocated $990,000 to a training fund to finance National Committee \nfor Support to Commune-Sangkat Councils (NCSC) training programs for councilors, clerks, and \nlocal and national officials.6 DoLA staff have been trained in information technology skills and \nthe English language. A total of 22 DoLA staff received funding support for the completion of the \npart-time  master  in  business  administration  (MBA)  course  of  the  National  University  of \nManagement, and were set to graduate in 2006. Two education and development workshops on \ncapacity building and human resource management were organized for DoLA staff in 2006. In-\nhouse management courses will continue monthly to the end of the year. The component plans \nto  continue  to  support  national  training  for  commune  councilors  and  clerks,  district  and \nprovincial staff, governors, deputy governors, and DoLA staff over the rest of 2006. An impact \nstudy of national training for councilors and clerks, mainly concerning commune development \nfund implementation, was published in September 2004.7 The study found that cascade training \n(using provincial and district master trainers) is effective and probably more cost-effective than \nthe use of NGOs; there has been no formal evaluation of the effect of training provided; clerks \nand council chiefs have received more training than councilors; despite training, all councils \nstudied  continue  to  require  external  assistance  in  commune  fund  implementation  tasks; \nunderstanding  of  training  materials  is  generally  low;  and  demand  for  refresher  courses \ncontinues. \n \n11.  The study thus tends to confirm other field findings that the implementation process for \nthe commune fund remains difficult for councilors to absorb and implement without continuing \nprovince and district staff support. The election of new councilors after the 2007 local elections \nwill increase training demand. More seriously, with commune development fund investment \ncurrently averaging about $8,000 a year for each commune, the outcome of this training supply \nessentially  enables  each  commune  to  select  and  implement  a  single  small  development \n                                                 \n6 As of the end of March 2006, expenditure from the training fund was $488,000 (49%). For the rest of 2006, support \nis planned for courses in conflict resolution, domestic violence, health, child rights, and facilitation skills. These are \nbudgeted at $227,000. If all the courses are completed, expenditure from the training fund would amlount to 72% \nby project closure. By March 2006, the training fund had financed 10 national training programs, mainly on \nplanning and implementation of Commune Fund procedures, for different groups of commune councilors and \nclerks. In 2006, the emphasis of commune-level training has been shifting toward training in governance, health, \ndomestic violence, child rights, and child protection. Three courses have been financed for PLAU and other \nprovincial staff in facilitation skills and PLAU structure and function. \n7  Turner, Mark. 2004. Study to Assess Effectiveness of the NCSC National Training Program. Phnom Penh. Final \nreport.  University of Canberra, for DFID-Sida Permanent Advisory Team, SPM Consultants, Oxford Policy \nManagement.  \n ", "   Appendix 2  29 \ninvestment each year.8 Hence, despite the apparent benefit of a cascade training system, the \nmore fundamental concern is the effect and cost-effectiveness of training courses devoted to \nenabling communes to select a single small investment item each year, which, the evidence \nsuggests, is not readily internalized and requires continuing refresher training, and ongoing \nsupport from province and district staff. The effect of governance and domestic violence training \nfor councilors, or of training for PLAU staff, has not been evaluated to date. The computer and \nlanguage training for DoLA is appreciated and is evident in the growing competence of DoLA \n(see Project Management below). The part-time MBA program, completed by 22 DoLA staff in \n2006,  is  highly  appreciated  and  has  contributed  to  the  department\u2019s  growing  overall \ncompetence.9   \n \n12.  Assessment and Implications for Phase II. The absorption rate of this subcomponent \nhas been relatively low to date. It currently appears that less than three quarters of the training \nfund may be disbursed at project closure. Further, it is not easy to ascertain exactly how many \npeople have been trained, or in what topics. The subcomponent has lacked an effective MIS \nthroughout. Only one evaluation (not financed by the Project) of some training activities is \navailable to date. The training of DoLA staff is appreciated and has been beneficial. The \ndevelopment of indigenous materials by the local consultant hired in 2005 is expected to be of \nbenefit in increasing the effect of future training. The capacity development concept adopted by \nsubcomponent 1-1 for the implementation of a relatively complex management and financial \ntask (through the provision of a detailed and visual manual; two 1-day, no-cost provincial \nseminars; and occasional supervisory and mentoring visits) has not been assessed for its \napplicability to other commune functions. Similarly, the effective capacity building\u2014with low-\noverhead training and supervision costs\u2014developed under component 4,10 does not appear to \nhave affected the DoLA or the approach of component 2 to capacity building and training.  \n \n13.  If training resources are available for phase II, the absorption rate suggests that a \nsmaller  quantum  than  in  CCDP  would  be  warranted.  The  available  evidence  is  that  until \ngovernment  moves  to  reform  and  simplify  the  current  methodology  for  planning  and \nimplementing the commune development fund, further expenditure on training in this area would \nbe of limited benefit and cost-effectiveness. Training for councilors old and new on roles and \nresponsibilities, representation, advocacy, dispute settlement, and rights issues, as under the \n2006 DoLA may be more useful. Commune clerks have received more training than councilors \nto date. However, they are young (mostly 25 and 26), educated at least to grade 12 (footnote \n11), and are thus more educable than the average councilor. Further training for DoLA and \nPLAU staff would therefore be warranted. \n \nF.  Component 2-2: Public Awareness \n \n14.  The project budget included $800,000 for financing public awareness activities. By the \nend of March 2006, $563,000 (70% of the budget) had been committed through contracts with \n                                                 \n8  If the commune development fund were sufficient to enable a choice of, say, half a dozen small investments a year \nfor each commune, this would require a total annual investment of about $78 million (6 x $8,000 x 1,621). This \nwould be about the same annual size as the financed elements of the Government\u2019s Public Investment Program \n2006\u20132008 for the entire rural development and agriculture sectors combined.   \n9  Anecdotal reports are that DoLA is now one of the best-educated and -trained departments in government. \n10  By early 2006, communes were assessing their own registration performance in districts, and districts in provinces, \nsupported by monthly visits from just two Plan International/United Nations Volunteers, covering the whole country. \nAuthentic capacity to collect registration data and review why the progress of a particular commune was good or \npoor in a given month has been widely achieved across the country. ", "30  Appendix 2 \nthree national nongovernment organizations (NGOs).11 Fifty-nine percent of the budget had \nbeen disbursed, with activities continuing. In 2004/2005, the first round of drama education \nfinanced community theater performances in 504 communes, film performances in 240, and \nloudspeaker announcements in 240. One million leaflets and 25,000 T-shirts were distributed. \nThe contractor, NICFEC, estimates that more than 2 million people were reached.  NICFEC \ninterviewed  3,000  people  after  the  drama  performances  and  found  that  about  56%  had \nunderstood the key messages. This is an encouraging finding in that it reflects increased \nunderstanding by the general public, including the poor and less literate. A second phase of \ndrama shows, covering 260 communes, ran from March to the end of July 2006. This second \nphase comprised 180 drama shows and 80 films, publicized through radio and television. During \n2004, six TV spots were produced, which were broadcast on seven channels over 5 months in \n2005 (television currently reaches about 70% of the population). New TV spots were broadcast \nbetween June and October 2006.12 The drama, TV, and radio campaigns were all prepared and \nmanaged by experienced national NGOs. All scripts and content were discussed and cleared \nbeforehand with DoLA and the NCSC capacity-building subcommittee. DoLA has produced five \neditions of a decentralization newsletter for distribution to commune councils to date. The mass \nmedia campaign has included extensive mention of the importance of CR, in support of the \nregistration campaign financed under component 4 of the Project.  \n \n15.  Assessment  and  Implications  for  Phase  II.  The  volume  and  diversity  of  public \nawareness activities, and the achieved population coverage, have been high. Verbal material \nand the use of community drama\u2014which increases scope for post-performance discussion and \ndebate\u2014have been appropriate for Cambodia. The drama education campaign for 2004\u20132006 \nis the largest ever implemented in the country, and the approach is being adopted by other \ndecentralization-support projects. National NGOs and media channels are relatively low-cost \nproviders, and high coverage is economic to achieve. No independent impact evaluation has \nbeen conducted, but the available evidence is that the campaign has been highly beneficial in \nincreasing awareness of the existence and role of elected local government. The field survey \nfound that 55% of councils visited (58 out of 106) had seen the drama shows. Almost all had \nseen TV spots (100 out of 106) and heard radio coverage (102 out of 106). Importantly, all the \n106 councils interviewed in the field survey said that they found the mass media coverage \ninteresting and useful. This is an encouraging finding about the potential of mass media to reach \nand inform councilors about their roles.   \n \n16.  The messages in the drama, TV, and radio spots are broadly the same, but experienced \nindependent observers have commented that the key decentralization messages do not always \nstand out in the six TV spots or the drama scripts they reviewed. The difference between the \nrole and legitimacy of elected councilors and NGOs tends to be blurred; the role of councilors as \nrepresentatives of the public, rather than of government is not distinct, although the role of \nfemale councilors comes over strongly; the potential for council advocacy over failures in public \n                                                 \n11  The three contractors are Neutral and Impartial Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia (NICFEC), \nmainly for commune dramas, $490,151; Action IEC (Information Education Communication), mainly for TV spots, \n$52350; Women\u2019s Media Centre, mainly for radio spots, $20,073. \n12 A three-part film, lasting 1 hour in total, has been produced for broadcast on three TV channels later in 2006. A \nquestion-and-answer call-in radio program was held monthly through 2005. DoLA staff were present to answer \nphoned-in questions. In January\u2013June 2006, the format was adapted to include call-in question-and-answer time \nand interviews with different participants in the decentralization process, with staff from DoLA, PLAUs, and \ncouncilors involved. Phone calls from commune councilors seeking clarification on their role and work are common. \nFour information spots on decentralization were broadcast on three radio channels in 2005. In January\u2013May 2006, \nthe intensity was increased to five spots on four channels. \n ", "   Appendix 2  31 \nservice supply and quality is not developed; some TV images tend to give the impression of \ncouncilors as \u201cthe new bosses\u201d rather than \u201cservants of the people\u201d; the new council premises \nthat were financed under component 1-1, and that act as a visible symbol of the permanency \nand status of elected local government, have yet to appear in the TV spots.13 This apparent lack \nof clarity in some of the message tends to be confirmed by the NICFEC post-performance \nsurvey finding that only just over half of the audience had internalized clear messages from the \ndrama shows. The promulgation of mixed messages is not surprising.  DoLA has yet to develop \na strong narrative (\u201csix core messages\u201d) on the key roles of councilors, and the contracted \nNGOs are relatively new to this field. For a phase II, it is desirable to develop and agree on a \nsmall  core  of  clear  messages  and  to  ensure  that  these  are  promulgated  and  repeated \nthroughout the campaign using different media. \n \nG.  Component 2-3: Technical Assistance \n \n17.  This component initially included 30 person-months of TA to analyze capacity-building \nneeds; ensure the effective planning and use of the training fund; help manage the public \nawareness fund; strengthen NCSC liaison with major service ministries; and help MoI develop a \ndecentralization  policy,  the  legal  system  and  procedures,  and  gender  analysis  and \nstrengthening. The volume of TA was increased following the MTR in November 2004, and the \nextension  of  the  Project  to  the  end  of  2006.14 In  2005,  commune  administration  training \nmaterials were reviewed for legal accuracy and draft guidance materials on the Land Law 2001 \nwere prepared. A draft for the new Commune Boundary Prakas was prepared in conjunction \nwith the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning, and Construction (MoLMUPC) (see \ncomponent 3 below). \n \n18.  Assessment and Implications for Phase II. The effect of the Project\u2019s TA support on \nthe decentralization policy process has been modest overall, other than the important support \nfor  training  and  public  awareness  campaigns,  and  assistance  with  drafting  the  commune \nboundary demarcation prakas. Competent and professional outputs have been produced, but it \nis hard to discern their effect on policy or procedural development. The evidence is that the \nlong-term and trusted TA provided by CCDP\u2019s sister projects financed by Deutsche Gesellschaft \nf\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  GmbH  (GTZ)  and  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme has been the more valued and influential source of TA to DoLA. For phase II, the \nprovision of decentralization and legal TA will need careful assessment in the light of future \nsupport provided through other agencies. \n \nH.  Component 3: Photo Mapping \n \n19.  The project budget included $1.1 million for photo mapping, implemented by MoLMUPC. \nThis was part of a joint initiative with the World Bank and the GTZ-financed Land Management \nAdministration Project (LMAP) and the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to \nproduce up-to-date digitized ortho maps for the whole country. Digitized ortho maps are a key \n                                                 \n13  One of the new TV spots broadcast in June 2006 featured the new council offices. \n14 In addition to supporting the implementation of the training fund and public awareness campaign, eight papers on \ndecentralization in Cambodia have been produced. The outputs in 2004 under the legal TA have been: a review of \ndecentralization legislation and an analysis of gaps in the law; preparation of prakas on council staff hiring, village \nchiefs, and the Commune Fund Board; reviews of the role of NCSC and DoLA; agency function delegation; the role \nof councils in the Social Land Concession Sub-Decree; and a draft curriculum on the council role in land \nmanagement issues and dispute resolution. A joint prakas was drafted on procedures to improve the accuracy of \ncommune boundary maps. ", "32  Appendix 2 \nelement of the national infrastructure and sharply increase the ease and efficiency of land \nallocation, land-use planning, and boundary demarcation. The division of the country among the \nthree financiers is shown in the figure below. At the end of March 2006, the only expenditure \nwas $366,000 from the initial $528,000 contract for the overflying and mapmaking of about one \nthird of the country, including the Ton Le Sap Sihanoukville and northwest areas, as shown on \nthe map. The flying was largely completed in 2004. Aerial photography (at a 1:40,000 scale) of \n55,000  square  meters  (about  500  communes),  followed  by  development,  contact  printing, \ncreating 55 global positioning system ground-control points (for map correction), and scanning \nare entirely completed.    \n \n20.  The creation of digital mosaics and the ortho photos is 80% completed. Some blocks \nhad to be reflown because of cloudy conditions and unclear photographs. These flights were \ncomplete by the end of February 2006. The MoLMUPC quality control team has made three \nmonitoring trips to Bangkok to assess progress by the contractor, as well as ongoing quality \ncontrol work based in MoLMUPC. The ortho maps now available are already being used for \nland registration by LMAP. The hard-copy commune copies will be printed and distributed as \npart of the forthcoming commune boundary demarcation exercise. There is now good progress \non committing the balance of the funds. First, tender evaluation of bids to prepare ortho photos \nfrom the area photographed through JICA financing in 2002 is under way. This task is expected \nto take 4 to 5 months to complete, after contract letting. Second, a $265,000 program to \ndemarcate province, district, and commune boundaries15 was approved in early 2006. A draft \nMoI and MoLMUPC prakas on the procedure has been prepared and the Project\u2019s MoLMUPC \nco-coordinator has developed a sound plan to map about 1,000 communes, using the available \northo  photos,  with  procedures  to  cope  with  the  multiple  scenarios  of  disputed  commune \nboundaries,  many  of  which  also  cross  district  and  provincial  boundaries.  A  team  of  two \nMoLMUPC staff members from each province will be responsible for working with communes to \nagree on boundaries. A committee structure at national, provincial, and district levels is being \ncreated  to  arbitrate  boundary  disputes  that  cannot  be  solved  directly  by  the  communes \nconcerned, and that affect higher-tier administrative boundaries.       \n \n21.  Assessment  and  Implications  for  Phase  II. The ortho maps produced under this \ncomponent  are  already  in  use.  They  simplify  and  expedite  the  vital  processes  of  land \nregistration, allocation of social and economic concessions, land-use planning, and boundary \ndemarcation. Because they are photos, rather than maps, ortho photos are relatively easy for \nuntrained councilors and citizens to understand and use.  The initial contract to photograph and \ndigitize the ADB part of the country was well executed, and obtained well below estimate. The \nNovember 2004 MTR recommended rapid action to commit the remaining budget. This has \nproceeded rather slowly, and contracts are only being drawn up, 12 to 15 months later, for the \ntwo important activities selected for financing from the balance. This delay is in part because of \nthe time required to establish the demarcation committee structure in provinces and districts, the \nlimited staff time available, internal changes within MoLMUPC for the implementation of the \ncomponent, and the low volume of TA committed to the design. Despite the delays, however, it \nis encouraging that boundary demarcation continues to be an authentic nationally led initiative. \nThe importance of boundary demarcation is undisputed, and if funds are available for phase II, \n                                                 \n15  Cambodia currently has no formalized administrative boundaries, even for provinces and districts. Commune \nboundaries exist only as penciled sketch maps, hurriedly collected in 2001, before the first council elections.  \nFormalizing boundaries and jurisdictions is an essential part of state building and underpins basic functions such \nas addressing, registering, and compiling the electoral roll; planning land use, measuring the local revenue base; \nand clarifying the jurisdiction of different tiers of local administration and line-ministry service. \n ", "   Appendix 2  33 \nthe priority use is continued support for completion of the demarcation exercise, including \nextension to all communes. The MoLMUPC is anxious that this should include marker posts. \nMoLMUPC is also interested in training urban and rural commune and sangkat councils in the \nuse of ortho photos for land-use planning. \n \nI.  Component 4: Civil Registration \n \n22.  The project was the main financier of the Government\u2019s civil registration (CR) drives over \n2003\u20132006,  in  partnership  with  Plan  International  and  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund \n(UNICEF). Commune and sangkat councils are responsible for the collection of birth, death, and \nmarriage certificates. In addition to their role in the country\u2019s demographic infrastructure, CR \nrecords  are  an  essential  component  of  human  and  gender  rights,  providing  documentary \nevidence of parentage, marriage, age, and family structure. The first task confronting the MoI\u2019s \nOffice of Civil Registration was to clear the near-universal backlog of non-registration. CCDP \nintroduced a \u201cmobile team\u201d methodology and performance incentives ($5 for every 100 forms \ncompleted)  for  the  field  teams.  This  incentive  was  pivotal  in  achieving  remarkably  fast \nregistration progress. The NGO Plan International, which has extensive experience in CR in \nother  countries,  became  a  significant  cooperating  partner  and  provided  important \nimplementation support, including mobilizing a team of field-based United Nations volunteers, \nlogistical support, monitoring and facilitation, and a supportive media campaign, partly financed \nfrom component 2-2. By the end of March 2006, component 4 expenditure (excluding the radio \nand equipment budget and expenditures transferred to component 1) was $1.51 million out of a \nrevised budget of $2.01 million (75%). Birth registration has risen, from about 2% in 2003 to \n74% in March 2006. With about 9 million CR registrations recorded to date, this CR campaign \nhas been one of the fastest in the world.16 \n \n23.  Assessment and Implications for Phase II. The clearing of the registration backlog \nwas highly impressive. The component was fortunate to have support from Plan International \nand UNICEF, and the partnership of these organizations with the Government, ADB, and the \nRoyal Netherlands Embassy has been a striking success. However, MoI\u2019s frequently expressed \nconcern that there are millions of hard-copy CR records sitting in 180 district offices, threatened \nby humidity, floods, and deterioration is clearly a serious matter. MoI has repeatedly requested \nsupport with digitizing and cataloging the records collected. A means to preserve and facilitate \naccess to the CR records collected to date, as part of a sustainable national system, must be a \npriority for phase II. \n \nJ.  Gender \n \n24.  The majority of the project components are concerned with helping provide the essential \nhard and soft infrastructure for councils to function (buildings, typewriters, radios, ortho maps, \nand a national CR system).17 There is greater opportunity to ensure that project resources \nbenefit  women  in  component  2,  through  the  training  and  awareness  funds.  Only  8.5%  of \ncouncilors  are  female,  and  the  DoLA  training  plan,  which  is  partly  financed  through \ncomponent 2, has had a strong gender focus toward this group. The current DoLA training plan \n                                                 \n16 By June 2006, the total number of birth certificates collected had passed the 10 million milestone. \n17\nThe ADB gender assessment questions whether latrines should have been included in the standard design for \ncouncil offices. The RRP notes that \u201cOther elements have been considered for addition to the model designs \nincluding: more offices, a water pump and well, latrines, a kitchen, fencing and gates, and a surrounding garden\u201d \n(para. 14). These were rejected because of the high opportunity cost. In the outturn, all communes visited either \nhave latrines nearby (all council offices are in the commune center) or have built them from their own resources.  ", "34  Appendix 2 \nincludes training for female councilors and clerks in representation, health, education, child \nrights, and child protection. The local training consultant hired by CCDP in 2005 is developing \ntraining materials for a course in the prevention and control of domestic violence. These courses \nare designed both to provide knowledge and to empower recipients. The gender emphasis in \nDoLA\u2019s work has been strengthened as a result of several gender TA inputs, including the long-\nstanding Partnership for Local Governance\u2013Seila gender-mainstreaming emphasis and inputs \nfrom UNICEF, the long-term GTZ TA, and CCDP\u2019s own work. \n   \n25.  A DoLA gender strategy is under development, with financial and TA support from GTZ.  \nA gender awareness course for DoLA staff was completed in 2005. The DoLA gender strategy \nand action plan is being developed in a participatory manner, by a core team made up of two \nstaff members from each of the six DoLA offices. A first draft was completed in November 2005 \nand  a  second  draft  in  March  2006.  The  component  2  international  consultant  and  the \nCambodian Resident Mission gender specialist were involved in the preliminary discussions.18 \nFollowing the recommendation of the November 2004 MTR, terms of reference were agreed on \nfor a national gender consultant in June 2005. The position was advertised and short-listed, and \ncandidates were interviewed later in the month. No suitable candidate was identified and the \nposition was re-advertised, but only one more application was received. It was decided that, in \nview of the progress on the production of the DoLA gender strategy, with GTZ support, the \nposition would not be advertised again. In November\u2013December 2005, ADB undertook a gender \nanalysis of CCDP.19 The study recommended that a gender action plan be developed and a \ngender specialist be employed to review the project components and the gender implications of \ncapacity building, training materials, target groups, course attendance, and the gender content \nof public awareness activities. The report recommended that the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs \n(MoWA) have a formal advisory role in CCDP planning and implementation. \n \n26.  Assessment and Implications for Phase II. Elected commune councils, formalized \nrights to land, and a national CR system are invaluable new institutions for advancing women \nand children\u2019s rights and interests. However, the majority of project support toward these is \nconcerned with providing the basic necessities for councils and the land and CR systems to \nfunction. The Project has made two unsuccessful attempts to hire a gender consultant, as \nrecommended in both the MTR and ADB gender analysis reports. The market for such skills is \nknown to be tight in Cambodia. If funds are available for further training activities in phase II, it \nwould be desirable to make a further attempt to hire a suitably qualified and experienced \nnational  consultant.  In  the  interim,  it  is  notable  that  the  national  materials  development \nconsultant is developing a course to strengthen domestic violence awareness and skills, which \nare a common element of councilors\u2019 day-to-day work. In the absence of a gender consultant, \nthe  international  component  2  capacity-building  consultant  has  reviewed  and  strengthened \ntraining materials related to gender, education, health, and child rights. The component 2-2 \npublic awareness campaign also includes strong positive gender messages in the drama, TV, \nand radio shows.  \n \n27.  Work  on  the  DoLA  gender  strategy  and  action  plan  is  now  well  under  way.  The \nMarch 2006 draft is a considerable advance on the November 2005 draft. It is important to \nrecognize the potential benefits of the participatory, consciousness-building approach adopted \nby the two (female) GTZ consultants concerned. In view of the fact that DoLA and the PLAUs \n                                                 \n18  ADB has also financed a 1-year program of support to the NGO Women for Prosperity, for the development of \nwomen councilors. \n19 Published in ADB. 2006. Gender Equality Results in ADB Cambodia: Cambodia Country Report. Manila. February.  \n ", "   Appendix 2  35 \nare overwhelmingly staffed by men, this approach is arguably wise, and it may be a mistake to \nsee rapid production of an \u201cideal\u201d strategy as the key goal. The gender strategy and action plan \nare expected to be completed during 2006, and will be an important guide to the implementation \nof phase II. \n \nK.  Project Management \n \n28.  The MTR contained positive statements about project management: \u201cOverall, project \nmanagement has performed very well. Modest changes to designate and train a deputy Project \nCoordinator;  to  designate  Component  Coordinators;  to  clarify  the  role  and  designation  of \nInternational  TA  advisors  are  proposed\u201d.  The  evidence  is  that  the  sound  management \nperformance noted in the MTR has continued to date. The Project had an overall in-country \nexpenditure rate of 84% as of the end of March 2006, and, as described, all four components \nare broadly delivering the results expected. One indicator of the relative performance achieved \nby  project management  is  the  turnover  ratio,  which  provides  an  indicator  of  disbursement \nperformance.20 At the end of 2005, CCDP\u2019s turnover ratio was 3.49, and much the highest \nwithin  the  ADB  Cambodia  portfolio.  The  average  of  the  other  15  projects  in  the  portfolio \n(excluding CCDP) was 0.88. This high performance is mainly explained by the fast-disbursing \ncomponent 1-1, which accounts for almost two thirds of the in-country budget, but it is also an \nindicator of project management\u2019s overall commitment and capacity.  \n \n29.  DoLA  has  continued  to  expand,  which  is  a  sound  indicator  of  the  Government\u2019s \ncontinuing commitment to decentralization. By March 2006, DoLA had a staff complement of 59, \nfour of them women, as against 25 (with no women) in 2002. Recruitment policy has continued \nto favor young, relatively well-educated staff. As noted, the staff training supported by the \nProject has been beneficial and appreciated. The May 2002 prakas, which organized DoLA into \nsix offices, has not been amended and DoLA\u2019s structure and management has continued \nunchanged to date. The project technical cell (PTC) concept, with five staff members from \ndifferent DoLA offices taking responsibility for the project, headed by a co-coordinator (and \ndeputy co-coordinator from 2005), but without a project management unit, continues to work \nwell. The PTC approach has helped keep the Project from becoming an \u201cADB enclave\u201d within \nDoLA.21 The addition of a capable contracted accountant has been very valuable, in terms of \nthe quality of financial and control and reporting achieved, and particularly in coping with the \nvery heavy load of separate expenditures incurred under the component 4 incentive-driven \nregistration approach. ADB responsibility for the Project was delegated from Manila to the \nCambodia Resident Mission in January 2005. The project staff members say that, after the \ninitial learning phase, delegation and greater ease of face-to-face and telephone discussion \nhave been of benefit to implementation. It would be desirable for this arrangement to continue \nfor phase II. \n \n30.  Assessment  and  Implications  for  Phase  II.  Overall,  the  project  management \narrangements have worked well. The generally good performance across all components is an \nindicator of the overall competence of project management to date. The management team, and \nkey individuals within it, has acquired experience over the 3 years of implementation. They are \nnow familiar with ADB procedures and requirements, and English skills have improved. The \n                                                 \n20  The annualized imprest turnover ratio is defined as the ratio of total liquidation over the time-weighted average fund \nbalance for 12 months. \n21  Many ministries in Cambodia have been effectively balkanized into donor fiefdoms and projects. The CCDP RRP \nwas explicitly aimed at avoiding this, in part through the PTC concept. ", "36  Appendix 2 \nmain identified weakness in the Project is that the operation of the four components largely in \nisolation  from  one  another.  The  component  2  public  awareness  campaign  provided  some \nsupport to component 4, but overall a silo culture has dominated, and interesting lessons, \nparticularly in capacity building and devolved management approaches, have not been shared. \nFurther, the absence of a unified organogram and management structure for the TA team in the \nRRP caused difficulties for ADB management at the initial stages of the project. For phase II, it \nwill be important to clarify the management structure, particularly within the TA team. It would \nalso be desirable for the key implementers of each component to regularly meet (also with other \nDoLA staff and TA). \n \n31.  In early 2006, a decision was made to locate the 4-year $20 million ADB Ton Le Sap \nSustainable Livelihoods Project (TLS-SLP) within DoLA. DoLA will be the Executing Agency, \nand will be responsible for implementing component 1 of the project, which is much the largest \nand most demanding. DoLA has no experience in implementing rural development projects, and \nMoI is concerned about the additional load this project will impose on the department.22 There \nwas an intention to make the key CCDP implementors, notably the co-coordinator and deputy \nco-coordinator, responsible for TLS-SLP. In view of the size, complexity, and establishment-\nphase  load  of  TLS-SLP,  this  would  have  been  highly  prejudicial  to  the  implementation  of \nphase II. In a meeting on 4 April 2006, MoI and DoLA stated that they intended to have the \ncurrent CCDP co-coordinator continue in that role into phase II, and to give responsibility for the \nimplementation  of  TLS-SLP  to  the  deputy  co-coordinator.  In  sum,  the  generally  positive \nassessment of DoLA in the 2002 CCDP RRP (Appendix 7: DoLA \u2013 organizational assessment) \nhas been well-realized in practice. DoLA, the PTC arrangement, and the key implementing staff \nhave developed commendably and are well prepared to implement a second phase of support \nfor decentralization. The compromise arrangement proposed by MoI for handling the TLS-SLP \nappears sound. Overall, the prospects for successful implementation of phase II appear very \npositive. \n \n \n                                                 \n22  TLS-SLP is larger than all the other, mainly TA-support, projects within DoLA, combined.  \n ", "                                      \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n \nThe donor partner contributions to decentralization and strengthening the operations of sub-national authorities at April 2006 are as \nfollows.

In  Cambodia,  the  adoption  of  the  Law  on  Commune/Sangkat  Administration  and \nManagement and the election of commune councils (2002) marked a first significant step in the \nimplementation of decentralization. Women represented only 16% of candidates. A total of \n11,257 commune councilors were elected in 1,621 communes, but, of these, only 951 (8%) \nwere women. Only about one third of commune councils have a woman councilor.1 This was a \nsource of concern for the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs (MoWA), and in 2003 it was decided that \neach commune council should have a women and children focal point (WCFP) to be in charge \nof women\u2019s and children\u2019s affairs.2 The need to support women councilors and WCFPs in \nbecoming effective partners of commune councils was identified by the MoWA in its Gender \nMainstreaming Evaluation Report (2005). In 2006, the Set Koma (Children\u2019s Rights) Project of \nthe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) was approved. Its intent was to strengthen the \ncapacity  of  provincial  and  district  women\u2019s  affairs\u2019  officials  to  train  WCFPs  and  women \ncouncilors in organizing and facilitating forums for elected women councilors and WCFPs, and \nestablishing gender networks at the district and commune level. The forums were envisaged to \nprovide a viable setting for interaction and lateral learning between and among WCFPs and \nfemale commune councilors on critical needs and constraints faced in the fulfillment of their \nroles and responsibilities, and the identification of practical modalities to address identified \nneeds and constraints. In Cambodia, while the Government has been largely successful in \nfostering commitment and action toward promoting gender equality, some areas still require \nattention. These include the chronic under-participation of women in the commune councils and \nthe lack of empowerment and self-esteem of women councilors and WCFPs. \n \nA.  Technical Assistance Impact, Outcome, Outputs, and Components \n \n2.  The technical assistance (TA) will support the advancement of gender equity in the next \nphase of decentralization and deconcentration reform. It will strengthen the capacity of elected \nwomen councilors and WCFPs in six target provinces by activating women networking forums in \ndistricts  and  communes.  The  forums  will  provide  women  with  opportunities  to  share  their \nexperience  and  self-learning,  promote  mutual  support  and  networking,  build  confidence, \nincrease  visibility,  and  improve  work  performance.  The  target  provinces  include:  Kompong \nChhnang,  Pursat,  Battambang,  Banteay  Mean  Chey,  Siemreap,  and  selected  districts  of \nKompong Thom not covered by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund.

The  training  of \ntrainers (TOT) will focus on the development of facilitation skills and techniques \nand  thematic  contents  with  respect  to  the  role  and  functioning  of  commune \ncouncils. \n                                                 \n1  Before the commune election in February 2002, MoWA and several nongovernment organizations advocated a \n30% quota for women. Party leaders publicly agreed that it would be very important to have greater political \nparticipation from women, but rejected a quota system. \n2  Now by law (art. 19 of Subdecree 22) every council must appoint a woman councilor to be in charge of women\u2019s \nand children\u2019s affairs. A council that does not have a female elected member should appoint a woman from the \ncommune to undertake this task.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: \nCambodia is historically a centralized, hierarchical, elite-driven society. It is widely believed that increased popular \nvoice, accountability, and participation are important drivers of increased equity in the use of national resources, and \npoverty reduction. The 2001 decision to create elected commune government for the first time in the nation\u2019s history \nhas created significant opportunities to strengthen participation and popular voice over time. The Strategic Framework \nfor Decentralization and Deconcentration Reforms (June 2005), the subsequent discussion at the Eighth Consultative \nGroup meeting of the Government and donors in March 2006, and the publication of the implementation framework for \nthe first preparatory phase for subnational democratic development in June 2006 indicate a deepening commitment to \nmore influential and participatory local government. By supporting local public administration reforms in an integrated \nway with the ongoing long-term institutional process of decentralization and deconcentration of public administration, \nthe Project will make a direct contribution to meeting the difficult challenge of refocusing many aspects of government \nand public services delivery, and giving an increasingly larger role to commune councils in Cambodia. Local public \nadministration has been recognized to play an essential role in the promotion of democratic practices and in the \ncountry\u2019s socioeconomic development. It can potentially increase local voice and representation in issues such as \nland-use rights, common property and natural resources use, and scrutiny of public service delivery by higher levels of \nsubnational public administration. All this contributes to the efficiency of private capital accumulation and reduction of \nvulnerabilities in local economic activity. \n \nIn the Commune Council Development Project (CCDP), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), together with the \nSwedish International Development Cooperation Agency and the Government of the Netherlands, has developed an \nimportant niche of support for the decentralization process. Many other donors have sought to use communes as a \nmeans of delivering rural development interventions through the Seila Program, the Commune Fund, and other \nbilateral and NGO projects. CCDP has focused directly on the core capacities and functions of commune councils, \naside from their role as implementers of their commune development funds. The assessment of the CCDP review in \nMarch 2006 is that such a focused approach has been both successful and appreciated by a wide spectrum of \nstakeholders from the central Government to the general public. The effects of having distinctive and appropriate \ncouncil premises, better council communications, training and public awareness raising, commune photomapping, and \na nascent national civil registration (CR) system are increasingly clear in terms of consolidating the local democratic \nprocess and essential local state building. Commune democracy has been one of the most important developments \nsince 1993 in deepening the democratization process in Cambodia. Building on the achievements of CCDP, the three \ncomponents of this Project\u2014enabling more commune councils to operate effectively, developing the national CR \nsystem, strengthening popular understanding of democratic rights and accountabilities\u2014are designed as a further \ncontribution to strengthening the institutions of open, participatory democracy at subnational levels, on which poverty \nreduction, human, and gender rights depend.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nAll three components are concerned with national system strengthening and awareness development toward a more \nopen, participatory, and accountable system of subnational governmental functioning. All three components have \ngood potential to contribute to increased poverty reduction over time, but no specific poverty analysis is required or \nappropriate for a system-development investment of this type. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No \n \nThe Review of CCDP (Appendix 2) reports the views and perceptions of the public, councilors, clerks, and officials \nabout the four components and the subcomponents of CCDP. The component selection for this project builds on the \nexperiences of CCDP, and particularly on the effects and benefits of the different elements of CCDP as perceived by \ndifferent stakeholder groups. \n ", "Appendix 9          57 \n     \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe project purpose (outcome and impact) is to increase democratic participation by consolidating and embedding the \nlocal democracy reforms launched by the Government in 2001. The impact on national participation systems will \nincrease over time, following the Government\u2019s plans to increase the remit of elected commune councilors to serve as \nmembers of district, municipal, and provincial councils. \n \nThe quality of participation in a democracy depends in part on the quality of the electoral system. There is evidence \nthat participation has been improving steadily over time. In the 1993 national elections, 4.8 million people voted. This \nnumber increased to 5.4 million in 1998 and 6.3 million in 2003. In the 2002 commune elections, 5.2 million people \nvoted. Following the national elections in 2003, the National Election Commission (NEC) introduced a new registration \nsystem, based on a permanent voter list, updated by commune councils every year. By December 2005, the number \nof registered voters had reached 6.7 million. Together with other procedural changes in the NEC, and in the electoral \nprocess, the evidence is that the quality of democracy\u2014and thus of national participation\u2014is steadily improving. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize benefits for women: \n \nThe democratic elections for the 1,621 commune councils that were held for the first time in 2002 (and that will be held \nagain in 2007) provided an unprecedented opportunity for women in Cambodia (51%\u201352% of the population) to have \nan equal voice in appointing their representatives (the councilors). In terms of direct political participation, and as a \nconsequence of the political competition process between parties, 16% of the candidates for that election were \nwomen. However, of the total of 11,257 commune councilors that were elected in the 1,621 communes, only 951 (8%) \nwere women. This suggests that the distribution of skills within communes is biased against women. Before the \ncommune  election  in  February  2002,  the  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s  Affairs  (MoWA)  and  several  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) advocated a 30% quota for women. Party leaders publicly agreed that women deserve greater \npolitical participation but rejected a quota system. Only about one third of commune councils have a woman councilor. \nIn 2003, at the suggestion of MoWA, it was decided that each commune council should have a women and children \nfocal point (WCFP). This was seen as necessary, given that the majority of commune councils had no female elected \nrepresentatives. Now by law (Art. 19 of Sub-decree 22) every council must appoint a woman councilor to be in charge \nof women\u2019s and children\u2019s affairs. If a council does not have a female elected member, it should appoint a woman \nfrom the commune for this task. While the Government was largely successful in fostering commitment and action \ntoward promoting equality, some areas continue to require attention. These include the chronic under-participation of \nwomen within commune councils\u2019 affairs and the lack of empowerment and self-esteem of women councilors. The \n2007 elections will provide an important opportunity to promote more women as commune councilors and to further \nadvance gender equity within the resulting public administration processes and structures. In this context, the need for \ncontinuous support for empowering newly elected women councilors and WCFPs in effectively performing their roles \nand responsibilities is critical and forms the rationale for the proposed gender design features within the Commune \nCouncil Development Project 2 (CCDP2). \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n \nThe CCDP2 gender action plan outlines relevant gender design features in each of the project components, to be \ncomplemented by gender design features in the attached technical assistance (TA) document. Component 1 supports \nwomen\u2019s participation in the construction of commune council facilities, and recognizes the need for women\u2019s \ninvolvement in decisions related to the location, design, and construction features of the proposed infrastructure. \nPriority use of the commune facilities by the Commune Committee for Women and Children (2004) was agreed and \nwill be reflected in the block-grant agreements. Component 2 will establish a computerized national CR system, which \nwill ensure the conservation of vital records, thus promoting legal certainty, transparency, protection of women\u2019s and \nchildren\u2019s property and inheritance rights from abuse, and predictability in accessing basic social services and \nproductive  resources.  The  support  for  gender-responsive  recruitment  practices  within  the  Ministry  of  Interior \nconstitutes an additional design feature of CCDP2. Gender will be mainstreamed in the design of the Department of \nLocal Administration\u2019s (DoLA\u2019s) annual capacity-building plan (2007\u20132009) and media awareness campaign, and the \ndevelopment of relevant training modules in gender and governance, in collaboration with DoLA, targeting the specific \nneeds and constraints faced by MoWA\u2019s provincial and district department staff. Other gender design features include \nthe recruitment of a full-time gender consultant to strengthen the gender content of DoLA\u2019s training programs and \nmass media campaigns. The required impact assessments of component 3 will require the establishment of sex-\ndisaggregated baseline data for the monitoring and evaluation of project activities. The past 5 years have seen a \nsteady increase in the number of civil society organizations involved in gender and decentralization initiatives \npromoting advocacy and policy making nationally, and promoting women\u2019s leadership and participation in communes \n ", "58  Appendix 9 \n \nand villages. In this context, CCDP2 will benefit from the skills and expertise of the NGO Women for Prosperity and \nestablish forums and sustainable networks of elected women councilors and WCFPs in six selected provinces. \n \nE.
