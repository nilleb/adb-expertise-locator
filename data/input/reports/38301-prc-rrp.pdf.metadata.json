An initial environmental examination was completed.  \n \n\nEnvironment \nAssessment \nProject Description  The  Project  will  improve  dryland  farming  in  Gansu,  Henan,  and \nShandong  provinces,  and  is  located  in  the  transition  zone  from  the \nnortheastern to the central western plains along the middle reaches of \nfarm \nthe  Yellow  River.  The  Project  will  benefit  about  600,000 \nhouseholds  and  improve  the  production  capacity  of  about  120,000 \nhectares (ha) in 27 counties, cities, and districts. The Project will adopt \na  farm-to-market,  value-chain  approach  that  creates  value  for  poor \nfarmers,  local  agroenterprises,  and  consumers.  It  will  introduce  high-\nvalue horticulture crops and improved crop and livestock management, \nfarm  technologies,  and  cultivation  practices.  Organic  fertilizers  and \nagrochemicals  will  be  more  effectively  used  and  the  quality  of  farm \nproduce  improved  through  support  services  provided  by  participating \nprivate agroenterprises. These include soil-testing facilities, agricultural \nextension  and  technology  transfer  centers,  organic  fertilizer  facilities, \nmachinery  service  centers,  seed  production  centers,  agricultural \nproduce  information  centers,  product-testing  centers,  and  expanded \nhorticulture markets. \n \nThe  Project  will  develop  about  29  partnerships  between  private \nagroenterprises  and  farmers  using  contract  farming  arrangements  to \nstrengthen  farm  productivity,  and  food  production  and  processing \ncapacity  to  take  advantage  of  growing  domestic  and  international \nmarkets. Sustainable production and processing partnerships according \nto  the  \u201cdragon-head\u201d  concept  will  be  used  to  develop  crops  and  other \noutputs  that  are  processed  and  marketed  by  the  enterprise.  The \ndragon-head agribusiness structure is a successful, vertically integrated \nenterprise model that has demonstrated the capacity to contract with a \nlarge number of farmers to improve rural incomes through value-chain \nlinkages  and  efficiencies,  access \nto  higher-value  markets,  and \nemployment opportunities.  \n \nThe agroenterprises were selected using strict selection criteria and due \ndiligence assessment of financial, economic, environmental, and social \nfactors.  They  will  be  provided  with  long-term  financing  to  expand  their \nfood processing and marketing operations. \n \nFarmers  will  diversify  and  modify  their  existing  traditional  cultivation  of \nlow-yielding  and  low-value  food  crops  to  higher-yielding  and  higher-\nvalue  crops.  Their  partnerships  with  profitable  and  expanding \n\n\fii \n\nRationale \n\nto  expand  environment-friendly \n\nimproved  provincial  and  county  project \n\nagroenterprises  will  ensure  them  higher  prices  for  their  outputs, \npremium  prices  for  quality,  and  a  guaranteed  price  at  harvest  time. \nFarmers\u2019 average income will increase by an estimated 15%\u201325% as a \nresult  of  the  Project.  Technological  improvements  include  (i) adopting \nhigh-yielding  varieties  and  improved  animal  breeds;  conservation \nagriculture  techniques  such  as  returning  crop  residues  to  the  soil, \nminimum  tillage,  and  soil  conservation  measures;  water-harvesting \ntechniques  such  as  storage  tanks,  lined  wells,  and  small  check  dams; \nand  water-saving  technologies  such  as  drip  irrigation,  sprinklers,  and \npipes; (ii) minimizing the use of chemical fertilizers and replacing them \nwith  organic  fertilizers,  and  minimizing  the  use  of  pesticides  and \nherbicides;  (iii)  reducing  postharvest  losses  with  the  use  of  advanced \npostharvest  and  processing  equipment;  (iv)  intercropping  within  tree \ncrops; and (v) upgrading vegetable greenhouses and vineyards.  \n \nLocal  government  support  services  will  work  with  enterprises  and \nfarming  and  processing \nfarmers \npractices. Local governments will provide project management that will \nsupport \nimplementation, \nmonitoring, evaluation, and national project coordination. The Executing \nAgency,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  (MOA),  the  three  provincial  project \nmanagement  offices  (PMOs),  and  the  county  PMOs  were  extensively \ninvolved  in  project  preparation,  including  applying  the  criteria  for \nselecting  the  agroenterprises  and  partnerships  with  farmers.  These \ninstitutions  will  receive  training  to  continue  applying  the  criteria  and \nfinancial  administration,  and  to  effectively  monitor  the  performance  of \nthe  agroenterprises  and  local  government  support  services,  and  the \ndelivery of financial and economic benefits to farmers. Training will also \nbe  provided  on  imprest  account  management,  project  implementation, \nand project performance management. \n \nMost  of  the  population  in  the  project  area  depend  on  agriculture,  and \nare  poor  and  vulnerable.  All  of  the  farms  are  very  small,  averaging \nabout 0.28 ha. The average rural household income is only two thirds of \nthe  national  average.  About  60%  of  household  income  in  the  project \narea  is  from  farming,  and  rural  unemployment  and  underemployment \nare significant. Farmers have limited access to markets and technology \nto  diversify  into  higher-value  crops.  Over  the  years,  poor  farming \npractices have accelerated land and water resources degradation. As a \nresult,  farm  productivity  poses  a  threat  to  the  environment  including \nland  and  other  natural  resources.  Sustainable  farming  is  under  threat \nwith  ever-decreasing  water  resources.  This  has  caused  declining  soil \nfertility  and  productivity,  increasing  farm  input  costs,  and  decreasing \nfarm  incomes.  The  correlation  between  land  degradation  and  the \nincidence of poverty is strong. Implementation of simple water and land \nconservation  practices  can  improve  fertility  and  stop  land  degradation. \nSustainable  farming  practices  need  to  be  strengthened  and  support \nprovided  for  undertaking  higher  value  on-farm  and  off-farm  activities, \nincreasing  agricultural  productivity  and  farm  incomes,  and  reducing \npoverty by linking farmers to local agroenterprises. \n  \nIn  the  project  area,  all  of  the  participating  enterprises  have  already \nfarmers.  The \nestablished  effective  relationships  with  smallholder \n\n\fiii \n\ncontract  farming  approach  has  been  successfully  adopted  and  has \nhelped  farmers  secure  cheaper  inputs  and  produce  higher-quality \nproducts at premium prices. In this business model, an enterprise links \nwith  a  production  base  of  contracted  farmers  (either  direct  or  through \nagents) and farmer associations.  \n \nThe Project has strong commitment from the stakeholders to introduce \nsustainable  farming  practices  including  the  use  of  contract  farming \nthrough  local  enterprises,  to  adopt  a  farm-to-market,  value-chain \napproach; and to strengthen agriculture extension services. It also has \na  wider  demonstration  and  replication  impact  within  and  to  other \nprovinces  to  address  rural  development  issues  including  sharing \nexperiences  and  improving  the  adoption  of  lessons.  This  approach  is \nfully  consistent  with  the  PRC\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan  to  promote \nconservation  agriculture,  crop  diversification,  use  of  improved  crop \nvarieties,  and  soil  and  water  conservation.  Overall,  the  Project  will \npromote sustainable farming practices and technologies to address land \ndegradation and reduce poverty. \n \nThe expected impact of the Project will be reduced rural poverty in the \nproject area of Gansu, Henan, and Shandong provinces with increased \nincomes  and  livelihood  opportunities  from  the  sustainable  use  of  land \nand  water  resources.  The  expected  outcome  is  increased  agricultural \nproductivity through the adoption of sustainable farming practices in the \nproject area to support higher-value, on-farm and postharvest activities. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $204.69  million \nincluding taxes and duties of $9.36 million. \n \nA loan of $83,000,000 from the ordinary capital resources of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have \na  25-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum  on  undisbursed  funds,  and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project \nagreements.  The  Spanish  Cooperation  Fund  for  Technical  Assistance \nwill provide a grant of $350,000 equivalent, to be administered by ADB, \nfor strengthening the implementation capacity of implementing agencies \nand \nfor \nthe  project  performance  management  system  required \nsuccessful implementation of the Project. \n\n \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank Loan \nSpanish Cooperation Fund for Technical \nAssistance \nNational Government \nProvincial and County Governments \nAgroenterprises \nFarmers \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n($ million) \n83.00 \n0.35 \n\n0.90 \n9.01 \n97.83 \n13.60 \n204.69 \n\n% \n\n40.55 \n0.17 \n\n0.44 \n4.40 \n47.80 \n6.64 \n\n100.00 \n\n \n\nImpact and \nOutcome \n\nProject Investment \nPlan  \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n\nThe Borrower is the PRC.

MOA  has \ndesignated the Foreign Economic Cooperation Center to be the central \nPMO  for  the  Project.  Provincial  and  county  leading  groups  have  been \nconstituted and are functioning. The provincial governments will be the \nprovincial  executing  agencies,  and  the  county,  city,  and  district \ngovernments will be the implementing agencies for all project activities. \nMOA  will  be  in  charge  of  overall  coordination  and  monitoring  of  the \nProject.  The  3  provincial  and  27  county  PMOs  will  supervise \nimplementation  activities.  MOA  will  provide  technical  guidance  and \nbackstopping  to  the  PMOs.  Major  tasks  of  the  provincial  and  county \nPMOs include (i) overseeing implementation of all components, outputs, \nand  activities;  (ii)  drawing  up  annual  work  programs  and  budgets  in \nconsultation with MOA; (iii) supervising compliance of procurement with \nADB  guidelines;  (iv) maintaining  consolidated  accounts \nincluding \ndeveloping  a  system  to  track  all  financial  transactions  with  enterprise \nsubborrowers;  (v) preparing  and  submitting  applications  to  ADB  for \nwithdrawing  funds  under  the  loan;  and  (vi)  monitoring  physical  and \nfinancial progress including benefit flows to intended beneficiaries, and \nsubmitting  these  along  with  monitoring  reports  to  MOA  and  ADB.  The \nkey role of the national and provincial governments will be to ensure (i) \nthat  participating  farmers  receive  technical  and  financial  support  in \norder  to  realize  the  intended  benefits  in  terms  of  productivity  and \nincome  increases  through  favorable  contracts  and  prices  with  the \nenterprises,  and  (ii)  that  poverty  is  reduced  in  the  project  area.  The \nprovincial  and  county  agencies  (finance  bureaus,  agriculture  bureaus, \nand  environmental  protection  bureaus)  will  assist  the  PMOs.  The \nagroenterprises  will  work  with  farmers  and  farmer  associations  to \ndevelop  the  production  areas  or  bases  and  upgrade  processing \nfacilities,  and  will  be  responsible  for  all  marketing  activities.  The \nimplementation  capacity  of  the  institutions  and  enterprises  involved  is \nconsidered  adequate  given  their  current  staffing,  incremental  staffing \nplans,  previous  implementation  experience  with  externally  financed \nprojects  and  providing  financial  support  to  agroenterprises,  previous \ntraining, and planned training under the Project. \n\n\f \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting \nServices \n\nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\nfarmer \n\nThe  Project  will  be  complemented  by  a  cofinancing  grant  of  $350,000 \nfrom the Government of Spain to finance part of the farmer support and \nlocal  government  monitoring  activities.  The  grant  will  also  strengthen \nthe capacity of the implementing agencies and the project performance \nmanagement  system  for  successful  implementation.  The  grant  will \npromote the delivery of  support services to improve yields,  agricultural \nproductivity,  and  environment-friendly  practices  on  an \nindividual \nhousehold  and  farmer  group  basis,  including  conservation  agriculture \nand  water  harvesting,  and  collection  technologies.  Implementation \nmethods  will  draw  on  proven  participatory  and  holistic  approaches, \nincluding participatory watershed management, group-based extension \nfield  schools,  and  successful  examples  of \nservices  and \nagroenterprises  working  with \nfarming \nfarmers  using  contract \nrelationships.  \n \nAll  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance \nwith  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime). Contracts for goods estimated to exceed $1 million and contracts \nfor  works  estimated  to  exceed  $10  million  will  be  procured  using \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Contracts  for  goods  and \nworks  estimated  to  be  less  than  the  international  competitive  bidding \nvalues  but  more  than  $100,000,  will  be  procured  through  national \ncompetitive bidding procedures in accordance with the PRC Tendering \nand  Bidding  Law,  1999,  subject  to  modifications  agreed  with  ADB. \nContracts  for  goods  and  works  estimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less  will \nbe procured using shopping procedures. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all \nprocurement documents and contracts. \n \nThe cofinancing grant from the Spanish Cooperation Fund for Technical \nAssistance will cover the costs of consultants; international and national \nexperts  will  be  recruited  through  a  firm  using  the  quality-  and  cost-\nbased  selection  method  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20.  This  will \ncover  (i)  the  preparation  and  delivery  of  training  (about  50  short \ncourses)  to  farmers  and  agriculture  technicians  in  the  project  area  on \nparticipatory  soil  and  water  management,  and  sustainable  agriculture \nlocal \n(by \ninstitutions  in  Gansu,  Henan,  and  Shandong  provinces  to  facilitate \nadoption of sustainable agriculture in collaboration with training course \ndelivery;  and  (iii)  training  materials.  The  national  and  provincial \ngovernments  will  provide  office  and  training  facilities,  domestic  travel, \ncounterpart agency support service staff, and materials and equipment \nto  demonstrate  sustainable  agricultural  technology.  The  provincial \ngovernments,  agroenterprises,  and  farmer  communities  will  cover  the \ncosts  of  implementing  sustainable  agriculture  action  plans  produced \nfrom the training. All recruitment will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nThe  major  direct  benefits  of  the  Project  are  (i)  increased  crop  and \nhorticulture development for about 120,000 ha of degraded and eroded \nland or areas susceptible to erosion; (ii) increased production of wheat, \nwheat products, corn, cornstarch, cotton seed, and associated products \n(oil cake and oil), vegetables, organic vegetables, and grapes for wine \n\ninternational  and  national  consultants);  (ii)  support \n\nto \n\nv \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nfamily \n\nincome  will  be \n\nincreased  by  15%\u201325%  at \n\nand juices; (iii) qualitative improvements for fruits, Chinese dates, sweet \npotatoes,  pepper  and  garlic,  mushrooms,  ginko,  high-value  herbs, \nconcentrated  soybean  and  peanut  products,  and  vegetable  seed; \n(iv)  additional  production  of  pork,  piglets,  processed  beef,  milk,  wool, \neggs, honey, and animal feed; (v) construction of markets and storage \nfacilities  for  perishable  and  semiperishable  commodities  and  packing \nmaterials,  and  production  of  organic  fertilizers  and  farm  machines  and \ntools; and (vi) establishment of village information centers. \n \nThe major beneficiaries will be about 600,000 farm households, whose \naverage \nfull \ndevelopment.  During  construction  and  operation  of  the  food  and \nlivestock-related  processing  lines,  the  Project  will  create  about  34,200 \njobs  including  about  9,000  jobs  for  the  poor.  Families  from  the  project \narea  will  be  given  preference,  women  in  particular,  for  employment  by \nthe  agroenterprises.  The  financial  internal  rates  of  return  for  the \npartnerships of agroenterprises and farmers range from 14% to 25.5%. \nThe Project\u2019s estimated economic internal rate of return is about 36%. \n \nThe major environmental benefits will be realized through improved and \nincreased agricultural productivity and farming practices that (i) improve \nsoil nutrition and quality, (ii) reduce wind and water erosion of soil, and \nreduce  water  runoff,  (iii)  increase  water  retention  in  fragile  soil,  and \n(iv) reduce soil salinity. \n \nThe  repayment  risk  will  be  shared  by  the  provincial  governments, \nparticipating  county  governments,  and  agroenterprises.  The  local \ngovernments have guaranteed the repayment of disbursed loan funds. \nIn  case  of  repayment  default,  the  provincial  governments  agree  to \ndeduct  amounts  due \nthe  county \ngovernments. The local governments have a strong incentive to partner \nwith  successful  private  commercial  agricultural  companies  to  channel \ninputs to farmers and link farmers\u2019 outputs to the market. \n \nTo  mitigate  the  risk  of  crop  losses  due  to  climate  change  and  other \nnatural disasters, the provincial governments will design and implement \nagricultural  risk  mitigation  schemes  to  provide  needed  compensation \nand relief to the participating farmers against crop and livestock losses \ndue to natural disasters.  \n \nThe financial risk associated with financing the participating enterprises \nhas  been  substantially  mitigated  through  the  stringent  selection  of  the \nparticipating enterprises. The historic and future financial management \nassessments  and  other  due  diligence  reviews  complement  risk \nmitigation efforts. Market and demand analyses were conducted and all \nthe  agroenterprises  have  been \nto  have  well-established \nfound \nmarkets\u2014both domestic and international. \n \nExtensive  training  and  capacity  improvement  activities  will  be  an \nintegral  part  of  project  implementation.  Measures  are  designed  to \nstrengthen financial management capacity and mitigate residual control \nrisks.  Training  courses  on  good  agriculture  practices  in  the  PRC \n(ChinaGAP), which aim to address food quality and safety issues, were \n\nthe  public  budgets  of \n\nfrom \n\n\fconducted  during  project  preparation.  All  participating  enterprises \nexpressed  their  interest  in  pursuing  ChinaGAP  certification,  which  will \neventually  match  standards \nfor  certified  producers  employing \nGLOBALGAP.

The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \n2. \nIn  August  2005,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  project  preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  formulate  the  Project.1 This  report  is  based  on  the  findings  of  the \nTA,  government  feasibility  study  reports,  findings  of  ADB  missions,  and  discussions  with \nGovernment officials and stakeholders.  \n \nA. \n \n3. \nIn the PRC, demand for agricultural products, especially higher-value horticulture crops \nand  livestock,  has  risen  sharply  in  recent  years  as  a  result  of  increasing  incomes  and \nurbanization. Since 2000, world commodity and agricultural prices have increased sharply due \nto  (i)  high  rates  of  global  growth  and  food  demand,  (ii)  increased  use  of  biofuel  in  developed \ncountries (e.g., corn prices in the United States have doubled in the last 2 years), (iii) increased \noil and fuel prices, and (iv) droughts and animal diseases.2 Prices of pork and other agricultural \nproduce have also sharply increased in the PRC. The share of agriculture in the gross domestic \nproduct declined from more than 25% in the 1980s to about 11% in 2006. Poverty is higher in \nrural  areas,  particularly  in  rain-fed  and  dryer  areas.  Consumers  spend  about  30%  of  their \nincomes  on  food.  As  a  consequence,  increasing  demand  and  higher  prices  for  high-quality \nproducts  represent  an  excellent  opportunity  for  farmers  and  agroenterprises  to  capitalize  on \nmarket  opportunities.  The  Government  policy  to  develop  the  sector  is  emphasized  in  the  New \nSocialist  Countryside  Policy 3  and  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP)  (2006\u20132010).  Objectives \ninclude  (i)  improving  farm  and  off-farm  income  opportunities;  (ii) increasing  grain  production, \nand developing agribusiness and farmer organizations; and (iii) adopting standards and capacity \nto  address  environmental  issues.4 Growth  in  agroenterprises  provides  opportunities  for  people \nto  leave  farming  for  off-farm  employment,  and  facilitates  more  sustainable  farm  structure  and \npractices  by  reducing  population  pressure  on  the  land.  Higher-quality  products  for  the  market \nrequire  supply-side  strengthening;  efficiency  gains;  and  improved  prices  to  farmers  through \nbetter coordination with enterprises, market agents, support services, and financial resources.  \n \n4. \nThe PRC has some of the worst land degradation in the world, with more than 40% of its \nland area (3 million\u20134 million square kilometers) adversely affected. The dryland area is about \n350 million hectares (ha) or about 70% of total farmland (about 40% of the total land area) and \nis characterized by (i) low water resources and high dependency on rainfall, (ii) soil infertility and \nlow  yields,  and  (iii)  degraded  lands  and  environment.  The  vast  western  region  accounts  for \nabout 70% of the country and has a population of more than 350 million, including many of the \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2005.

February (WRS-05-01). \n\n\f 2 \n\nmost  poor  and  vulnerable.  A  strong  correlation  exists  between  land  degradation  and  the \nincidence  of  poverty.  To  respond  to  the  increasing  threat,  the  Government  significantly \nexpanded  its  programs  to  combat  land  degradation  including  agricultural  technology  transfer \n(conservation  agriculture,  improved  varieties,  and  mechanization),  reforestation,  closure  of \nforest and grazing areas, and soil and water conservation. A sector review is in Appendix 2. \n \n5. \nFor  traditional  smallholder  farmers,  market  access  has  become  increasingly  difficult. \nMillions of very small-scale farm households are unable to compete\u2014to respond to changes in \ndomestic demand and to withstand pressure from international markets\u2014without changing their \nproduction  and  trading  structures.  Evidence  from  the  PRC  and  elsewhere  of  socioeconomic \nbenefits  provides  a  strong  development  rationale  for  strengthening  processor\u2013farmer  linkages \nthrough  contracts,  alliances,  and  other  relationships. 5  Contract  farming  offers  a  means  to \nefficiently connect small-scale farmers and large-scale food processing firms. The Government \nrecognizes  this  and  is  implementing  programs  and  incentives,  such  as  credit  support  and  tax \nreduction  for  agribusinesses  involved  in  contract  farming.  Contract  farming  has  grown  rapidly \nover  the  past  10  years,  initially  in  the  economically  advanced  coastal  provinces.  Now,  it  is \nspreading  rapidly  into  underdeveloped  areas  of  central  and  western  PRC.  The  increase  in \ncontracting  between  agroenterprises  and  farmers  is  part  of  the  vertical  integration  trend \nexperienced in agribusiness worldwide as both partners seek to minimize transaction costs and \nsupply  uncertainty.  The  agribusiness  model  has  proven  potential  to  improve  farm  incomes.  A \nsurvey6 of  more  than  1,000  PRC  farmers  found  that  only  20%  were  involved  in  contracts,  but \nthat 76% would like to be involved in contract farming if offered the opportunity.  \n \nB. \n \n \n \n6. \nThe project area encompasses overstressed, fragile, and degraded dryland areas along \nthe Yellow River in three provinces: Gansu in the severely eroded western loess plateau, Henan \nin the central region, and Shandong in the northeastern plains. The Project will support 27 rural \nand poor counties, cities, and districts in the three provinces. Of the total 811,000 ha of arable \nland in the three provinces, about 324,000 ha (40%) are classified as degraded. In Gansu, 60% \nof  its  total  281,000  ha  are  degraded;  in  Henan,  36%  of  328,000  ha  are  degraded;  and  in \nShandong, about 25% of the total 201,000 ha are degraded. Rainfall in this semiarid climate is \nconcentrated  between  July  and  September,  severe  erosion  and  floods  occur  during  the  wet \nseason, and water shortages during the dry season. The fragile nature of the soil, deforestation, \novergrazing, and removal of crop residues for fuel and fodder have resulted in the project area \nhaving some of the most degraded land in the country. \n \n7. \nThe project area has about 2.8 million farm households. Of these, 1.3 million (48%) are \nin  Henan,  721,000  (26%)  in  Gansu,  and  719,000  (26%)  in  Shandong.  The  average  per \nhousehold farm area is about 0.28 ha, ranging from 0.39 ha in Gansu, to 0.25 ha in Henan, and \n0.28 ha in Shandong. The traditional rain-fed wheat and  corn cropping system is dominant on \nflatland and terraced hillsides, augmented by fruits, vegetables, and livestock. Small farm size, \nlow and decreasing yields, limited access to technology, and a failure in the formal rural finance \nmarket  for  long-term  credit  are  key  constraints  in  the  cycle  of  rural  poverty  and  land \ndegradation. Farmers are highly vulnerable to the impact of land degradation, and natural and \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nProject Area  \n\n1. \n\n                                                 \n5  Da  Silva,  Carlos.  2005.

Land  degradation  results  in  declining  productivity, \nincreasing farm input costs, and decreasing farm incomes.  \n \nThe key problems affecting the project area include (i) low agricultural productivity and \n8. \nsustainability, \ninputs, \n(iii) vulnerability of farmers to price fluctuations and natural disasters, and (iv) lack of adequate \nworking  capital  and  long-term  financing  for  agroenterprises.  Farming  on  steep  slopes  has \nbecome  common  due  to  the  combined  effect  of  population  expansion  and  poor  regulations. \nUneven  rainfall  and  farming  on  slopes  have  caused  an  increase  in  the  scope  and  intensity  of \nwater  runoff  and  soil  erosion,  and  a  decline  in  the  capacity  to  regulate  water  and  hold  soil.  A \nproblem tree analysis is in Appendix 3.  \n \n9. \nExisting public sector extension services provided through local government agriculture \nbureaus  have  limited  outreach  and  do  not  deliver  adequate  technical  advice  appropriate  to \nfarmers' needs. In the townships, the ratio of technicians to farmers is around 1 to 2,100. They \nlack sufficient resources to provide effective service delivery, and have limited access to up-to-\ndate  research  and  extension  information.  Supply  chains  are  increasingly  being  organized  for \nproduct quality, uniformity, timely delivery, certification, and traceability. Without organized and \neffective  extension  services  and  linkages  to  enterprises,  farmers  will  be  forced  to  sell  their \nproduce  to  secondary  channels  with  no  price  premiums.  The  PRC's  major  commercial  banks \nand  financial  institutions  concentrate  lending  in  urban  areas  and  nonagriculture  sectors. \nFarmers (especially women) and small agribusinesses are disadvantaged in terms of access to \nformal  credit.  Most  farm  expenditures  are  financed  by  farmers'  savings,  and  most  loans  are \nobtained from informal sources (e.g., relatives, friends, moneylenders, and pawnbrokers). Small \nand medium-sized agroenterprises lack access to finance. In 2004, they received less than 10% \nof  total  bank  lending.  The  failure  of  the  financial  sector  to  effectively  support  agricultural  and \nagribusiness development means that market opportunities\u2014and the associated introduction of \nmore  economically  and  environmentally  sustainable  agricultural  production\u2014are  not  being \nrealized. Under the Project, agroenterprises will be provided with long-term financing, and as is \ntheir current practice, will provide agricultural inputs to farmers on extended terms, recoverable \nat harvest time. \n \n\n2. \n\nRealization of Market Opportunities \n\n \n10. \nTo  address  concerns  about  food  quality  and  safety,  and  promote  good  agricultural \npractices, the PRC initiated the ChinaGAP program, which will eventually match the standards \nof  certified  producers  supplying  European  markets  also  known  as  GLOBALGAP. 7 This  will \ncomplement  compliance  with  international  standards  already  achieved  by  agroenterprises \nthrough hazard analysis, critical control point, and International Organization for Standardization \ncertification. \n \n11. \nImprovements  in  farm  productivity  and  sustainability  will  require  significantly  better \naccess by farmers to stable markets and improved support services. Through contract farming \narrangements, agroenterprises can provide farmers with improved market and price incentives, \nwhile  at  the  same  time  securing  their  own  raw  material  supplies  to  enable  them  to realize  the \ngrowing  market  potential \nfood  products.  However,  agroenterprises  are \nconstrained by limited access to investment finance for the necessary expansion in processing \ncapacity.  Access  of  farms  to  support  services  is  currently  limited  by  low-quality  extension \n                                                 \n7  Due  to  its  expanding  international  role  in  establishing  good  agricultural  practices,  EurepGAP  announced  the \n\nfor  processed \n\nchange in its title and logo to GLOBALGAP in September 2007. \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nservices,  including  the  limited  outreach  of  agricultural  information  services.  The  public  sector \nneeds to improve the quality of and access to such services. The opportunity exists to improve \nboth  the  quality  and  outreach  of  advisory  and  information  services  through  public\u2013private \npartnerships  in  which  local  and  more  readily  accessible  and  sustainable  private-sector-led \nservices are established through linkages to existing public sector systems. \n \n\n3. \n\nPolicies and Strategies  \n\n \nThe  Government\u2019s  11th  FYP  shifts  the  emphasis  of  economic  and  social  development \n12. \npolicies  away  from  the  growth  orientation  of  previous  plans,  and  instead  emphasizes \nsustainability, based on broader and more inclusive rural development and social programs in \nthe context of an increasingly market-oriented economy. The objective of the FYP is to achieve \ngreater  balance  between  (i)  urban  and  rural  areas,  (ii)  geographic  regions,  (iii) economic \nsectors, (iv) economic and social development, and (v) economic growth and protection of the \nenvironment.  Continuing  the  emphasis  on  development  of  the  agriculture  sector,  in  January \n2006  the  Government  published  its  strategy  calling  for  greater  efforts  to  address  the  rural \nproblems  of  about  900  million  rural  people  by  increasing  the  importance  of  grain  production, \nproduct safety, infrastructure, support services including research and extension, social welfare, \nand  governance  (footnote  3).  The  strategy  emphasizes  that  (i)  \u201cdragon-head\u201d  enterprises 8 \nshould  work  in  partnership  with  farmers  to  share  benefits,  (ii)  small-scale  water  projects  in \nmountainous areas should combat drought through rainwater harvesting, and (iii) water-saving \nirrigation  should  be  developed.  ADB\u2019s  strategic  objectives  and  operations  (as  reflected  in  the \n2008\u20132010  country  partnership  strategy) 9  are  consistent  with  the  11th  FYP.  ADB\u2019s  future \noperations in the PRC will focus on rural development, environment, energy conservation, urban \ndevelopment,  and  regional  cooperation.  ADB  will  mobilize  more  resources  and  develop \ndiversified  instruments  to  meet  the  demand  for  balanced  development  among  regions,  and \nbetween rural and urban areas. \n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n \n13.  Within the project area, external assistance has included projects in the agriculture and \nnatural  resources  sector,  with  numerous  projects  financed  by  the  World  Bank  including  \n(i)  Henan  Agriculture  Development  Project  (1991),  (ii)  Gansu  and  Xinjiang  Pastoral \nDevelopment Project (2003), (iii) Smallholder Cattle Development Project (1999 in 4 provinces), \n(iv)  Agricultural  Support  Services  Project  (1993  in  19  provinces),  (v)  Agriculture  Technology \nTransfer  Project  (2005  in  5  provinces),  and  (vi)  Shandong  Agricultural  Development  Project \n(1989).  In  addition,  the  ongoing  Henan  Afforestation  Project  financed  by  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational  Cooperation  includes  the  establishment  of  protection  forest  and  tree  crops \n(orchards),  timber  cultivation,  and  capacity  building.  The  ongoing  Henan  Province  Small \nHousehold  Project,  financed  by  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW,  includes  the \nintroduction  of  soil  and  water  conservation  methods  to  support  farmers  affected  by  mountain \nclosures  and  grazing  bans.  ADB's  West  Henan  Agriculture  Development  Project 10  was \nimplemented in July 2001 and included livestock development, water resource development and \na  water  supply  plant,  horticulture  development,  upgrading  of  information  for  farmers,  and \ntraining  of  extension  workers  and  farmers.

ADB\u2019s  Capacity  Building  to  Combat  Land  Degradation  Project,12 the  first  project \nunder  the  PRC\u2013Global  Environment  Fund  Partnership  on  Land  Degradation  in  Dryland \nEcosystems,  is  ongoing  in  six  provinces  and  autonomous  regions:  Gansu,  Inner  Mongolia, \nNingxia,  Qinghai,  Shaanxi,  and  Xinjiang.  Major  projects  in  the  sector  supported  by  external \nassistance are in Appendix 4. \n \n\n5. \n\nLessons  \n\nis  supported  by  major  stakeholders  with  effective \n\n \n14. \nA sustainable rural development approach can reduce the rural\u2013urban income gap and \nlift  the  poor  out  of  poverty  if  the  project  (i)  provides  low-income  rural  producers  in \nenvironmentally  fragile  areas  with  higher  incomes  through  market-driven  opportunities,  and  \n(ii) \ninstitutional  mechanisms  and \narrangements. Success factors in previous ADB,13 World Bank, and other international finance \ninstitution  projects  include  (i)  flexibility  in  design  that  allows  stakeholders  to  revise  planned \nactivities to respond to market demand; (ii) high private sector participation and the freedom to \noperate on a commercial basis; (iii) strong ownership by project stakeholders including private \nenterprises,  farmers,  and  local  government  implementing  agencies  (IAs);  (iv) capacity  building \nin  advisory  and  other  support  services  to  facilitate  the  adoption  of  new  technologies  and \npractices, in particular among small-scale and poor farmers; (v) effective project management, \nmonitoring, and evaluation; (vi) participatory strategies such as simple watershed management \napproaches  and  solutions  to  land  degradation  problems  with  farmers\u2019  involvement;  and  (vii) \npromotion of sustainable farming techniques on marginal land. \n \n15. \nSome of the important lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in dryland management include \n(i)  poverty  can  encourage  nonsustainable  agriculture  and  other  income-generating  activities, \nand vice versa; (ii) soil and water management are critical to improving yields, productivity, and \nsustainable  activities;  (iii)  livestock  management  is  important  to  discourage  destructive  open \ngrazing  practices; and (iv) institutional  arrangements  must  be  in  place  to  educate farmers  and \nrural inhabitants on best practices. All project provinces, counties, cities, and districts have had \nexperience implementing similar projects. The outputs and lessons from this assistance can be \nshared with Gansu, Henan, and Shandong provinces. In the evaluation of operations in the rural \ndevelopment and natural resources sector in the PRC, ADB's 2007 country assistance program \nevaluation14 identified  several  issues  relevant  to  the  Project:  (i)  in  the  past,  ADB\u2019s  commercial \nactivities,  such  as  agro-industrial  and  agroprocessing  projects,  tended  to  be  less  successful \nbecause  they  relied  on  the  capacity  of  untested  private  enterprises;  (ii)  the  PRC  has  been \nreluctant  to  borrow  for  agricultural  projects  on  ordinary  capital  resources  terms  due  to \ninsufficient financial rates of return  and difficulty servicing  debt; and (iii) failure of onlending to \n                                                 \n11 ADB.  2002.

The  project  completion  report  for  the  Fujian  Soil  Conservation \nand  Rural  Development  Project 15  cites  a  number  of  problems  common  to  such  projects, \nincluding (i) changing market trends; (ii) location problems in relation to raw material supply; and \n(iii) inappropriate financing terms that (a) failed to reflect agroenterprise cash flow and required \nloan repayments to start immediately (prior to full operation of the facilities installed with project \nloan  funds);  (b)  included  an  interest  spread  for  the  finance  bureau,  which  drove  the  resulting \nend-borrower  interest  rate  above  domestic  market  rates;  and  (c)  neglected  the  need  for \narrangements for complementary working capital finance to be in place. The project completion \nreport  for  the  Hainan  Agriculture  and  Natural  Resources  Development  Project16 identifies  the \nmajor  failure  of  the  Project  as  being  due  to  the  establishment  of  four  new  private  enterprises \nspecifically for project implementation that were not well established and managed. The major \nrecommendations are (i) project design should be demand-driven, and (ii) sufficiently strong and \nexperienced agroenterprises should be included. \n \n16. \nThe  project  design  addresses  these  issues  by  identifying  agroenterprises  that  satisfy \nfinancial,  economic,  environmental,  and  social  criteria.  Their  investments  proposed  under  the \nProject  were  analyzed  during  project  preparation  and  found  to  be  viable.  This  removes \nresponsibility for investment appraisal from local finance bureaus that are not qualified for such \ntasks.  The  agroenterprises  concerned  have  (i)  a  strong  record  of  success  in  food  processing \nwith  at  least  5  years  experience;  (ii)  well-established  domestic  and  international  markets,  and \nsound  marketing  experience  and  strategies  to  respond  to  shifting  market  trends;  and  \n(iii)  upstream  linkages  with  farmers  within  their  locality  to  ensure  a  stable  supply  of  raw \nmaterials.  They  are  private  sector  entities  rather  than  state-owned  enterprises,  which  are \ntypically inefficient and poorly managed. The project completion report for the Fujian project also \nnotes that agroenterprises provide job opportunities more suitable for women (footnote 15). In \naddition,  a  recent  ADB  evaluation  study 17 shows  that  successful  poverty  reduction  involves \nlinking the poor to commercial value-adding enterprises, and generating off-farm employment. \n \nAn  ADB  TA  report18 identifies  similar  lessons,  specifically  that  viable  enterprises  can \n17. \nreceive commercial funding without the need for subsidies or special considerations. However, \nwhere financial market failure exists, development partners and governments can address this \nby  creating  specific  financial  facilities  (loans,  equity,  and  guarantees)  that  assist  private \nagroenterprises.  Long-term  capital,  in  particular,  is  needed  because  of  the  lead  time  to  full \nproduction  of  agroenterprises.  Because  of  the  lead  time,  the  provision  of  long-term  capital \nshould not be subsidized. Under the Project, the terms and conditions of such financing will be \nrelated to a realistic repayment schedule for each participating agroenterprise. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n18. \nThe  expected  impact  of  the  Project  is  reduced  rural  poverty  in  27  counties,  cities,  and \ndistricts  of  Gansu,  Henan,  and  Shandong  provinces,  with  increased  incomes  and  livelihood \nopportunities  resulting  from  sustainable  use  of  land  and  water  resources.  This  impact  will  be \nmeasured through increases in per capita net income and reduced number of poor in the project \n                                                 \n15 ADB.  2003.

An essential aspect of the sustainability of the Project\u2019s impact will be a reduction in the \nrate  of  farmland  degradation.  The  impact  is  expected  to  benefit  rural  households  in  poor \ncounties, cities, and districts experiencing continuous degradation of agricultural land resources. \n \nThe outcome of the Project will be increased agricultural productivity through adoption of \n19. \nsustainable \nthe  project  area.  Through  partnerships  between \nagroenterprises,  farmers,  and  local  governments,  the  Project  will  facilitate  farmer  access  to \nfinance,  technology,  and  markets  so  that  higher-value  agricultural  products  can  be  produced \nusing sustainable agricultural practices\u2014including conservation agriculture\u2014which will improve \nfarm  incomes  while  reducing  the  rate  of  land  degradation.  The  expansion  of  agroprocessing \nenterprises  will  increase  rural  value-added  and  off-farm  employment  opportunities,  and \ncontribute  to  increasing  rural  incomes.  Agroenterprises  will  experience  increased  sales  of \nprocessed  products  into  existing  and  new  domestic  and  export  markets.  This  will  ensure  their \nsustainability  and  the  stability  of  market  outlets  and  prices  for  farmers.  Viable  partnerships \nbetween  agroenterprises  and  farmers  will  help  improve  the  security  of  food  supply  within  the \nproject area and reduce the risk of food scarcity of vulnerable populations. \n \n20. \nA holistic approach to addressing constraints in production, processing, and provision of \nsupport services and investment finance will address natural resource degradation and promote \nlong-term  sustainability  and  profitability  of  higher-value  agricultural  production  and  processing. \nThis  approach  is  fully  consistent  with  national  and  local  economic  and  social  development \npolicies and the 11th FYP, which builds upon the work of earlier plans to promote soil and water \nconservation,  crop  diversification,  and  investment  in  sustainable  agricultural  technologies. \nPromoting  poverty  reduction  and  environmental  sustainability  continues  to  be  one  of  ADB\u2019s \nmajor strategic thrusts. \n \nB. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nAgroenterprise and Farm Partnership Improvements \n\n \n21. \nThe  principal  output  of  the  Project  is  the  promotion  of  financially  and  environmentally \nsustainable  agriculture  in  dryland  areas  through  partnerships  between  private  agroenterprises \nand smallholder farmers. Poverty is seen as a cause of land degradation (and vice versa), and \nimproved  access  to  inputs,  technologies,  technical  advice,  training,  and  income  opportunities \nwill enable farmers to adopt appropriate and sustainable farming practices. To enable farmers to \nimprove incomes and agricultural practices, the Project will link them to growing  markets. The \nProject will also result in productivity improvements. \n \n\na. \n\nSubcomponent 1A: Enhanced Agricultural Production  \n\n \nThe Project will develop about 29 partnerships between agroenterprises and farmers to \n22. \nstrengthen  food  production,  processing  capacity,  and  competitiveness  in  Gansu,  Henan,  and \nShandong  provinces  to  take  advantage  of  growing  domestic  and  export  markets.  The  Project \nwill focus on 27 counties, cities, and districts in the three provinces (7 in Gansu, 12 in Henan, \nand 8 in Shandong). The counties, cities, and districts in Gansu are all located in Tianshui city \nand municipality. The Project helps scale up the contract farming mechanism and the inclusion \nof three provinces does not add complexity to project management for either agroenterprises or \nprovincial  government  IAs.  By  working  with  farmers,  the  participating  agroenterprises  will \ndirectly  benefit  about  600,000  farm  households  and  improve  the  production  capacity  of  about \n120,000  ha.  These  enterprises  are  currently  working  with  another  850,000  farm  households \nusing  contract  farming  arrangements.  Farmers  will  convert  their  existing  cultivation  of  low-\n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nyielding  and  low-value  food  crops  to  higher-value  crops  for  the  market  and  their  own \nconsumption.  \n \n23. \nThe  current  partnerships  are  based  on  the  principles  of  contract  farming  in  the  PRC. \nFarm  households,  usually  in  a  contiguous  land  area,  work  under  contract  on  an  individual \nhousehold  basis  with  an  agroenterprise  to  produce  agricultural  outputs  at  a  guaranteed  price \ndependent  on  a  specified  quality.  The  agroenterprise  provides  inputs  to  the  farmers  (such  as \norganic  fertilizer,  planting  material,  and  irrigation  equipment),  and  the  cost  of  these  inputs  is \ndeducted  from  the  value  of  the  output.  Written  contracts  are  typically  used  for  new  farm \nhouseholds,  but  informal  contracts  are  the  norm  when  the  two  parties  have  a  long-term \nrelationship and trust. The contracts are usually for one season and are considered fair based \non  indications  of  the  responsibilities  of  the  parties  and  a  guaranteed  price  subject  to  quality \nstandards. The contract price is typically 10%\u201315% above wholesale market prices because of \nthe  higher  quality  of  the  output  supplied  directly  to  the  agroenterprise  for  processing  and  final \nproduct marketing and sale. The contracts are legal and honored by local courts for arbitration. \nIn  addition  to  agricultural  inputs,  agroenterprises  currently  provide  support  services  to \ncontracted  farmers  in  the  form  of  technical  advice  and  training  to  improve  yields,  production, \nand quality. Public sector extension services and training are also provided on a limited basis to \nleading farmers, and are generally considered to be deficient in the project area. The Project will \nimprove  the  support  services  provided  to  farmers  by  agroenterprises  and  public  sector \nextension agents. \n \n24. \nThe enterprises were chosen on the basis of application of agreed selection criteria from \na long list of about 150 enterprises; and include financial and economic performance data based \non audited statements, and environmental and social criteria. Appendix 5 contains the details of \nthe  selection  criteria  and  the  due  diligence  analysis.  Sustainable  production  and  processing \npartnerships  according  to  the  dragon-head  concept  will  be  used  to  develop  crops  and  other \noutputs, which are processed and marketed by the enterprise. Examples of enterprise activities \ninclude food crops, horticulture crops, and small livestock products processing. The enterprises \nwill be provided with long-term financing to expand their food processing, quality assurance, and \nmarketing operations. Farmers will benefit from the partnerships with profitable and expanding \nagroenterprises through higher prices for their outputs and improved yields and production. No \nland  acquisition  will  be  needed;  all  production  and  processing  expansions  will  be  on  existing \nfarm and agroenterprise land. \n \n\nb. \n\nSubcomponent 1B: Private Support Services to Farmers  \n\n \n25. \nThe Project will support strengthening of farmers\u2019 knowledge and capabilities to develop \nstrong, business-oriented approaches that are provided directly from the agroenterprises. This \nwill  complement  agricultural  extension  services  provided  by  the  public  sector  (para.  27\u201329). \nFarmers will receive agricultural extension advice, new technologies, improved access to inputs, \nand increased market access by working in partnership with participating agroenterprises. The \nagroenterprises  and  county  project  management  offices  (PMOs) \nlow-income \nhouseholds requiring strengthened knowledge and capabilities. The small and uniform farm size \nthat characterizes the project area is not viewed as a major constraint to successful adoption of \nscale-neutral  technologies.  The  average  farmer  income  will  increase  by  about  15%\u201325%. \nTechnological  improvements  include  adoption  of  (i)  improved  seeds,  varieties,  and  breeds; \n(ii) conservation  agriculture  techniques  such  as  returning  crop  residues  to  the  soil  and \nminimizing  tillage;  (iii)  water-saving  technologies  such  as  drip  irrigation,  sprayers,  and  pipes;  \n(iv) use of organic fertilizer and minimizing the use of chemical fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide;  \n(v)  advanced  postharvest  and  processing  equipment;  (vi)  intercropping  with  tree  crops  and \n\nidentified \n\n\fgrape  vineyards;  and  (vii)  upgraded  vegetable  greenhouses.  An  element  of  this  commercially \nbased relationship will be that these service facilities will be sustainable after project completion \nwithout  reliance  on  any  government  funding,  and  function  on  a  revenue-generating,  cost-\nrecovery basis.  \n \n26. \nTo  increase  competitiveness,  the  Project,  through  the  agroenterprises,  will  provide \nadvisory  service  and  input  support  to  farmers.  Infrastructure  provided  by  agroenterprises  to \nimprove  agricultural  productivity  and  product  quality  will  include  establishing  and  improving \nthree  agricultural  extension  and  technology  transfer  centers  in  Henan,  two  organic  fertilizer-\nmixing facilities in Henan and Shandong, one expanded manufacturing plant and 30 machinery \nservice stations in Henan, one seed production center in Shandong, three agricultural produce \ninformation centers in Henan and Shandong, one agricultural product testing center in Henan, \nfour expanded fruit and vegetable markets in Gansu and Henan, and four farmer associations in \nHenan  and  Shandong.  These  outputs  will  be  an  integral  part  of  the  relationship  between \nenterprises  and  farmers,  both  individually  and  through  voluntary  participation  in  farmer \nassociations. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Support and Management \n\n \n\na. \n\nSubcomponent 2A: Public Sector Support to Farmers \n\n \n27. \nLocal government support services will work with agroenterprises and farmers to expand \nenvironment-friendly  farming  practices.  This  will  improve  access  to  advisory  services  and \ntraining for farmers operating on a project production basis. Farmer training will be undertaken \nby  the  extension  staff  of  provincial  and  county  agriculture  bureaus  assisted  by  lead  farmers \nselected  from  villages  where  production  bases  are  located.  The  staff  and  lead  farmers  will  be \nprovided  with  training  in  improved  practices  relevant  to  (i)  financially  and  environmentally \nsustainable  crop  cultivation  techniques  and  farm  management,  and  (ii)  development  of  advice \nand training for delivery skills. This will allow training to cover the proposed 66,200 households, \nwith up to 80,000 farmers trained annually by the end of the Project, including both project and \nnonproject farmers. The provincial governments currently implement agricultural risk mitigation \nmeasures  to  assist  farmers  in  the  event  of  natural  disasters  (e.g.,  snowstorms,  floods,  and \ndrought) through the provision of compensation (cash and in-kind inputs), training, and services. \nIn  addition  to  minimum  price  supports,  agroenterprises  assure  contract  farmers  a  guaranteed \nminimum price at the time of harvest or upon delivery. Also, the public sector provides farmers \nwith training in improved farming practices (such as organic cultivation methods) and testing of \nproducts  at  market  centers  to  ensure  safety  and  quality.  These  measures  will  be  provided  to \nfarmers under the Project using counterpart funds. \n \n\nb. \n\nSubcomponent 2B: Demonstration of Sustainable Farming Practices \n\n \n28. \nThe  Project  will  be  complemented  by  a  $350,000  grant  from  the  Spanish  Cooperation \nFund for Technical Assistance to demonstrate sustainable farming practices (Appendix 6). The \ngrant  will  strengthen  the  implementation  capacity  of  IAs  and  the  project  performance \nmanagement  system  required  for  successful  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  provincial \ngovernments will finance improvements of existing office and training facilities, training materials \nand  equipment  to  demonstrate  improved  agricultural  technologies,  and  counterpart  staff.  The \ngrant  will  improve  sustainable  farming  practices  to  increase  farm  productivity,  reduce  land \ndegradation,  adopt  sustainable  land  management  practices,  assess  the  impact  of  climate \nchange on land degradation (particularly in Gansu  province), and improve water conservation. \nThe grant administered by ADB will support the delivery of support services to improve yields, \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nagricultural  productivity,  and  environment-friendly  practices  on  an  individual  household  and \nfarmer-group  basis,  including  conservation  agriculture,  water  harvesting,  and  collection \ntechnologies. Implementation methods will draw on proven participatory and holistic approaches \nincluding  participatory  watershed  management,  group-based  extension  services  and  farmer \nfield  schools,  and  successful  examples  of  agroenterprises  working  with  farmers  using  the \ncontract farming relationships.  \n \n\nc. \n\nSubcomponent 2C: Project Management \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n29. \nLocal  governments  will  establish  and  provide  adequate  project  management  support \ncomplete  with  logistics  facilities  and  technical  staff  for  effective  provincial  and  county  project \nimplementation.  MOA,  the  Executing  Agency;  the  three  provincial  PMOs;  and  the  27  county \nPMOs responsible for project implementation were extensively involved in preparing the Project, \nincluding  applying  the  criteria  for  selecting  the  agroenterprises  and  partnerships  with  farmers. \nThey  have  experience  in  implementing  externally  and  government-financed  programs  and \nprojects in the sector. All agencies involved in the Project, including the agroenterprises, have \nreceived  annual  training  from  the  Government  on  technological  improvements,  project \nmanagement,  and  financial  management.  During  project  implementation,  the  PMOs  will \nundertake monitoring of key impact, outcome, and output indicators. Counterpart financing will \nbe used to provide (i) training to these institutions in the application of criteria for agroenterprise \nparticipation  in  the  Project,  (ii)  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  performance  of \nagroenterprises  and  local  government  support  services  under  the  Project,  and  (iii)  effective \ndelivery  of  financial  and  economic  benefits  to  farmers.  ADB  will  provide  training  on  imprest \naccount  management,  project  implementation,  and  project  performance  management.  The \nproject  staff  will  undertake  awareness  workshops  on  mobilizing  farmers  and  disseminating \ninformation relating to the Project. \n \nC. \n \n30. \nEnvironmental  and  Social  Benefits.  The  Project  will  generate  significant \nenvironmental and social benefits. It addresses rural poverty and agricultural land degradation \nin  an  integrated  and  financially  sustainable  manner,  in  which  farmers  receive  benefits  from \nmeasures to reduce land degradation and improve agricultural productivity, and share the costs \nof conservation measures. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics \nis  successfully  applying  this  model  in  the  PRC  to  promote  congruence  between  poverty \nreduction  and  environmental  improvement.  The  institute  received  earlier  ADB  TA19 to  promote \nthe watershed development approach with farmers and local governments in the PRC and other \ncountries.  The  Project  focuses  on  poorer  dryland  areas  where  impacts  on  incomes,  poverty \nreduction,  and  agricultural  productivity  can  be  expected  to  be  high.  Improvements  to  the \nenvironment  will  be  realized  through  improved  and  increased  agricultural  productivity,  and \nfarming practices that (i) improve soil nutrition and quality; (ii) reduce wind and water erosion of \nsoil,  and  reduce  water  runoff;  (iii)  increase  water  retention  in  fragile  soil;  and  (iv)  reduce  soil \nsalinity. The lesson from this model will be adopted in the Project. \n \nPublic\u2013Private  Partnerships.  The  Project  will  strengthen  existing  public\u2013private \n31. \npartnerships  between  county  agriculture  bureaus,  agroenterprises,  and  farmers  in  the  delivery \nof key farm support services in extension, information, and soil and water analysis to increase \ncompetitiveness and improve management and operations. The Project will reduce poverty and \nprovide  environmental  benefits  without  reliance  on  grants  or  subsidies.  The  public\u2013private \npartnership  model  provides  a  channel  through  which  an  integrated  package  of  financial, \n                                                 \n19 ADB.  2002.

Manila (TA 6067-REG). \n\n\f \n\n11\n\ntechnical, and market support can be provided to farmers during implementation, and with little \nincremental  requirement  for  public  funds.  The  public\u2013private  partnership  between  farmers, \nagroenterprises, and local government agencies is a special feature of the Project, utilizing the \ntried and tested application of contract farming on a large scale. Such partnerships are key to \nsecuring  the  regular  supply  of  crops  and  livestock  products,  improving  productivity,  and \nensuring adequate incomes to farmers and enterprises. \n \n32. \nContract  Farming. The Project will build upon the existing concept of the dragon-head \nenterprise  to  develop  mutually  beneficial  partnerships  between  farmers,  farmer  groups, \nenterprises,  and  local  governments  (footnote  8).  Although  only  eight  (28%)  agroenterprises  in \nthe Project qualify as dragon heads due to their relatively small size, all participating enterprises \nfollow  the  dragon-head  model  and  have  sufficient  capacity  to  expand  operations  with  farmers \nunder  the  Project.  The  Project  will  introduce  long-term  financing  to  enterprises  and  easier \naccess  to  public  sector  support  services  to  contracted  farmers.  Farmers  and  enterprises  may \nhave  (i)  a  sales  contract  to  minimize  price  risks,  (ii)  shareholding,  and  (iii) provision  of  farm \ninputs  to  be  repaid  in  kind  (farm  produce).  By  working  in  several  provinces,  the  Project  will \nenable greater sharing of experiences and lessons. The Project has strong national, provincial, \ncounty, and village government support. \n \n33. \nContract farming has been successfully practiced in the PRC for the last 10 years. The \nProject  will  promote  the  contract  farming  approach  through  the  establishment  of  production \nbases  linked  to  agroenterprises.  This  has  the  potential  to  provide  farmers  with  higher  product \nprices  and  incomes,  compared  with  those  of  farmers  not  engaged  in  contract  farming.  It  will \nimprove  farmer  access  to  stable  market  outlets  increase  farm  incomes,  and  provide  a  stable \nsupply of consistent quality raw materials to  agroenterprises to satisfy market demand. Farm\u2013\nmarket linkages will be enhanced and transaction costs for farmers and agroenterprises will be \nreduced.  To  ensure  that  the  poor  and  households  headed  by  women  also  benefit  from  the \nProject, ways of providing incentives to include them in farmer associations and informal groups \nwill be explored.  \n \nD. \n \n34. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $204.69 million including taxes and duties of \n$9.36 million, physical and price contingencies, interest, and other charges.

The  flow  of  funds  and  onlending \narrangements are shown in Appendix 8. \n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n37.  MOA  will  coordinate  and  supervise  all  implementation  activities  through  the  existing \nNational  Project  Coordination  committee,  comprising  representatives  of  MOA,  MOF,  and  the \nNational  Development  and  Reform  Commission.  MOA  has  designated  the  Foreign  Economic \nCooperation  Center  to  be  the  central  PMO  for  the  Project.  MOA  will  be  responsible  for \ninterfacing with ADB, MOF, and the National Development and Reform Commission. MOA will \nbe in charge of overall coordination and monitoring of the Project. Provincial and county leading \n\n\fgroups  have  been  constituted  and  are  functioning.  The  provincial  governments  will  be  the \nprovincial executing agencies, responsible for supervising and monitoring project activities. The \ncounty,  city,  and  district  governments  will  be  the  IAs  for  all  project  components  and  will \nsupervise  implementation  activities.  MOA  will  provide  technical  guidance  and  backstopping  to \nthe  provincial  executing  agencies  and  will  coordinate  implementation  of  the  grant  provided  by \nthe Spanish Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance. \n \n38. \nThe  provincial  and  county  PMOs  currently  guide  the  provincial  and  county  leading \ngroups  to  oversee  project  implementation  and resolve  issues.  These leading  groups  comprise \nstaff  of  the  PMOs  and  finance,  agriculture,  environmental  protection,  and  poverty  reduction \nbureaus. The IAs\u2019 major tasks include (i) overseeing implementation of all components, outputs, \nand activities; (ii) developing annual work programs and budgets in consultation with MOA; (iii) \nsupervising  compliance  of  procurement  with  ADB  guidelines;  (iv)  maintaining  consolidated \naccounts  including  developing  a  system  to  track  all  financial  transactions  with  enterprise \nsubborrowers; (v) preparing and submitting applications to ADB for withdrawing funds from the \nloan account; (vi) monitoring physical and financial progress including benefit flows to intended \nbeneficiaries,  and  submitting  reports  to  provincial  executing  agencies;  and  (vii)  ensuring \nadequate  and  timely  counterpart  financing.  A  major  role  of  the  national  and  provincial \ngovernments will be to ensure that participating farmers receive the intended benefits in terms \nof  productivity  and  income  increases  through  favorable  contracts  and  prices  with  the \nenterprises,  and  that  poverty  is  reduced  in  the  project  area.  The  provincial,  municipal,  and \ncounty agencies (finance bureaus, agriculture bureaus, and environmental protection bureaus) \nwill assist the PMOs. The organization chart is in Appendix 9. \n \nThe  agroenterprises  will  implement  the  activities,  working  with  farmers  and  farmer \n39. \nassociations  to  establish  and  develop  the  production  areas  or  bases  and  processing  facilities, \nand will be responsible for all marketing activities. Farmer associations are voluntary groups of \nfarmers  working  together  to  improve  agricultural  productivity,  product  quality,  and  marketing \nbased on available market information. Therefore, farmers can work in partnership directly with \nagroenterprises and indirectly through farmer associations, although contracts are only between \nagroenterprises  and  individual  farmers.  Farmer  associations  elect  their  own  officers  and  are \nself-financing.  The  implementation  capacity  of  the  institutions  and  enterprises  involved  is \nconsidered adequate given their current staffing, incremental staffing plans, previous experience \nwith  externally  financed  projects  and  providing  financial  support  to  agroenterprises,  and \nprevious  training  and  planned  training  under  the  Project.  The  agroenterprises  were  selected \nusing agreed selection criteria and all have at least 5 years experience in their current activities. \nThe county, city, and district governments will provide loans ranging from about $0.7 million to \n$8.6 million to the agroenterprises (Appendix 5). \n \n40. \nAn  agreement  will  be  entered  into  between  each  participating  enterprise  and \nparticipating  farmers.  Many  of  these  contracts  are  already  in  place,  facilitating  early  project \nimplementation.  Under  the  agreement,  a  participating  enterprise  will  be  responsible  for  \n(i)  undertaking,  in  collaboration  with  participating  farmers,  the  necessary  work  to  establish \nproduction  and  install  farm  infrastructure  and  equipment;  (ii)  providing  seedlings,  fertilizers, \npesticides, and technology and guidance to participating farmers in production and postharvest \nactivities,  with  associated  fees  agreed  to  by  participating  farmers  and  the  participating \nenterprise; and (iii) purchasing the outputs produced by participating farmers, at the higher rate \nof  the  prevailing  market  price  or  the  protected  price  agreed  at  the  beginning  of  each  year. \nParticipating farmers will be obliged to (i) carry out land improvement work under the guidance \nof the participating enterprise, (ii) ensure high-quality production stipulated by the participating \nenterprise,  (iii)  sell  produced  outputs  to  the  participating  enterprise  in  accordance  with  the \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\nagreement,  and  (iv)  repay  the  cost  of  the  inputs  and  goods  provided  by  the  participating \nenterprise by deducting the charges from the payment made by the participating enterprise for \nthe  participating  farmers'  outputs.  In  addition,  contracts  between  agroenterprises  and  county \nagriculture  bureaus  will  be  developed  for  the  provision  of  technical  support  services  for  farm \nproduction  and  enterprise-processing  activities.  All  provincial  and  county  agencies  and \nenterprises \ntechnological \nimprovements,  project  management,  and  financial  management.  The  Project  will  provide \nadditional training. \n \n\nthe  Project  have \n\nreceived  annual \n\ntraining  on \n\ninvolved \n\nin \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  from  June  2009  to  June  2014.  An \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n41. \nimplementation schedule is presented in Appendix 10. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nAll  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's \n42. \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Contracts for goods estimated \nto  exceed  $1  million  and  contracts for  works  estimated  to exceed  $10  million  will be  procured \nusing international competitive bidding procedures. Contracts for goods and works estimated to \ncost  less  than  the  international  competitive  bidding  values  but  more  than  $100,000  will  be \nprocured  through  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  in  accordance  with  the  PRC \nTendering  and  Bidding  Law,  1999,  subject  to  modifications  agreed  with  ADB.  Contracts  for \ngoods  and  works  estimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less  will  be  procured  using  shopping \nprocedures.  More  details  are  provided  in  Appendix  11.  The  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement documents \nand contracts. \n \nIn  accordance  with  ADB  procedures,  an  assessment  was  made  of  the  procurement \n43. \ncapacity  of  MOA  and  other  project  agencies.  The  assessment  concludes  that  the  IAs  have \nadequate procurement experience in domestic-  and ADB-financed projects, but that MOA and \nimplementing  agency  staff  require  training  on  ADB  procurement  procedures  and  requirements \nto  ensure  compliance  with  ADB  procurement  guidelines.  MOA  and  implementing  agency  staff \nwill attend ADB-sponsored courses and seminars on procurement and project implementation. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n44. \nThe cofinancing grant from the Spanish Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance will \ncover  the  costs  of  consultants  comprising  about  5  person-months  of  international  and  about \n25 person-months of national experts to be recruited through a firm using the quality- and cost- \nbase  selection  method  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20.  This  will  cover  (i)  preparation  and \ndelivery of training (about 50 short courses) to farmers and agriculture technicians in the project \narea  on  participatory  soil  and  water  management,  and  sustainable  agriculture;  (ii)  support  to \nlocal  institutions  in  Gansu,  Henan,  and  Shandong  provinces  in  collaboration  with  the  training \ncourse delivery; and (iii) training materials. The national and provincial governments will provide \noffice  and  training  facilities,  domestic  travel,  counterpart  agency  support  service  staff,  and \nmaterials  and  equipment  to  demonstrate  sustainable  agricultural  technology.  The  provincial \ngovernments,  agroenterprises,  and  farmer  communities  will  cover  the  costs  of  implementing \nsustainable agriculture action plans produced from the training. All recruitment will follow ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Details  are  in \nAppendix 6. \n\n\f5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n45. \nThe  Government  and  the  provinces  requested  retroactive  financing  since  many  of  the \nagroenterprises  are  ready  to  start  project  implementation  with  contracted  farmers.  The \nGovernment was advised that retroactive financing could only apply up to 20% of the ADB loan \nwith respect to expenditures incurred not earlier than 12 months before the signing of the loan \nagreement. All contracts proposed for advanced action and retroactive financing, relating to the \nexpansion  of  production  bases  and  operation  of  the  PMOs,  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  national  and \nprovincial  governments  were  advised  that  approval  of  this  request  does  not  commit  ADB  to \nfinancing the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n46. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the Government, MOA, \nprovincial  governments,  and  IAs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  though  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan and grant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency,  provincial \ngovernments,  IAs,  and  agroenterprises;  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n47. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  facilitate  project \nimplementation and flow of funds, three imprest  accounts for the loan (one for each province) \nwill be set up in commercial banks acceptable to ADB upon loan effectiveness, managed by the \nprovinces.  The  initial  advances  to  be  deposited  will  not  exceed  either  6 months  of  estimated \nexpenditures or 10% of the loan proceeds allocated to the provinces, whichever is lower. The \ndirect payment procedures will apply for large contracts. If the Government initially funds eligible \nexpenditures  from  its  own  resources,  the  reimbursement  procedure  will  be  used.  To  expedite \nfunds flow and simplify the documentation process, the statement-of-expenditure procedure will \nbe used to liquidate and replenish the imprest accounts and reimburse eligible expenditures not \nexceeding $100,000 per individual payment from agroenterprise to supplier or contractor under \ncivil works and goods contracts. The payments in excess of the statement-of-expenditure ceiling \nwill  be  reimbursed,  liquidated,  or  replenished  based  on  the  full  supporting  documentation \nto  agroenterprises  on  a  needs  basis.  The \nprocess.  Finance  bureaus  will  disburse \nagroenterprises  will  be  responsible  for  repayments  to  the  IAs,  and  will  provide  collateral  to \nsecure  loans  from  their  respective  implementing  agency.  The  IAs  will  be  responsible  for \nrepayment to provincial governments. A financial management assessment of MOA and the IAs \nis presented in Supplementary Appendix B. The assessment concludes that they satisfy ADB\u2019s \nfinancial  management  requirements  for  executing  and  IAs  and,  as  government  offices  in  the \nhierarchy under MOF, they have satisfactory financial management capability. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n48.  MOA  and  the  PMOs  involved  in  project  implementation  will  maintain  separate  records \nand  accounts  that  identify  goods  and  services  from  the  loan  proceeds,  financing  resources \nreceived, expenditures incurred, and use of local funds. These accounts will be established and \nmaintained  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and  internationally  accepted \naccounting  standards.  The  provincial  governments  will  review  and  consolidate  these  accounts \nand  have  them  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  practices  by  the \nGovernment\u2019s sovereign audit agency or other auditors acceptable to ADB. The audit report will \ninclude  a  statement  verifying  whether  or  not  the  funds  disbursed  by  ADB  were  used  for  the \npurposes  for  which  they  were  provided,  as  well  as  the  auditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  use  of  the \nimprest accounts and statement-of-expenditure procedures. Copies of the audited accounts and \nauditor\u2019s  report  will  be submitted  to  ADB  within  6  months  after  the  end  of  each  financial  year. \nMOA  will  prepare  consolidated  semi-annual  reports  indicating  progress  made,  problems \nencountered  during  the  period,  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems,  and  a \nproposed  program  of  activities  with  progress  expected  for  the  next  reporting  period.  Within  3 \nmonths of physical completion of the Project, MOA will submit a completion report to ADB that \ndescribes  achievements  in  relation  to  the  Project\u2019s  expected  impact,  outcome,  and  outputs. \nEnterprises  participating  in  the  Project  and  in  receipt  of  loan  funds  will  have  their  accounts \naudited  and  their  financial  statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  international  financial \nreporting  standards  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Enterprises  will  make  their  financial \nstatements available to the provincial governments within 3 months of the end of each financial \nyear. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n49. \nTo  monitor  the  progress  of  the  Project  in  achieving  the  planned  outcome  and  outputs, \nMOA  and  the  three  provincial  executing  agencies  will  develop  a  project  performance \nmanagement system (PPMS) to establish benchmark indicators to assess project performance \nand impact. The PPMS will be designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial action \nregarding  project  design,  schedules,  activities,  and  development  impacts.  It  will  include \nindicators  proposed  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework,  and  adopt  the  following  agreed \nindicators  as  a  minimum:  (i)  physical  progress  of  agroenterprise  implementation  (production \nbase and processing capacity expansion); (ii) changes in crop and livestock varieties and yields \ncompared  with  present;  (iii)  types  and  application  rates  of  fertilizers  and  agrochemicals \ncompared with present; (iv) increases in farm incomes; (v) reduction in poverty incidence, and \ngender  and  social  development;  and  (vi)  reduction  in  degraded  land.  The  IAs  in  consultation \nwith each participating agriculture bureau and agroenterprise will develop comprehensive PPMS \nprocedures to systematically generate data on inputs and outputs of project activities; and the \nphysical,  socioeconomic,  and  environmental  indicators  to  measure  project  impacts.  Within  the \nPPMS  framework,  the  IAs  will  confirm  achievable  targets,  refine  monitoring  and  recording \narrangements, and establish systems and procedures no later than 6 months after the start of \nthe Project. They will be responsible for analyzing and consolidating the reported data through \nthe  management  information  system,  and  for  reporting  the  outcome  to  ADB  through  quarterly \nprogress reports. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \nIn  addition  to  regular  monitoring,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly  review  project \n50. \nperformance  at  least  once  a  year.  The  review  will  assess  implementation  performance  and \nachievement  of  progress  toward  project  outcomes  and  outputs,  financial  progress,  and  issues \n\n\fand constraints affecting implementation. It will include development of a time-bound action plan \nfor  resolution  of  issues  and  constraints.  ADB  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a  midterm \nreview to assess implementation status and take appropriate measures, including modification \nof scope and implementation arrangements, and reallocation of loan proceeds, as appropriate, \nto achieve the Project\u2019s outcomes and impact. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nFarm Incomes \n\n \nA. \n \n51. \nFarm incomes will increase due to (i) the adoption of improved production technologies, \nincluding  quality  seed;  shifts  in  cropping  patterns  to  include  high-value  crops;  judicious  use  of \nagrochemicals  (fertilizers  and  pesticides);  use  of  organic  fertilizers;  increase  in  irrigation \nefficiencies;  improved  water  and  soil  conservation;  and  reduction  of  postharvest  losses;  and \n(ii) premium  prices  received  from  improved  quality  of  outputs.  The  incremental  income  flows \nwere derived from financial analysis of farm investments, which indicated appreciable returns to \ninvestment.  The  value  of  incremental  output  was  adjusted  for  the  associated  costs  and \nrevenues accruing to households that qualified for a premium on quality. \n \n52. \nIn addition to the qualitative improvements, project beneficiaries will produce additional \nquantities of 100,000 tons (t) of wheat, 80,000 t of wheat products, 10,000 t of corn, 30,000 t of \ncornstarch,  30,000  t  of  cotton  seed  and  associated  products  (oil  cake  and  oil),  80,000  t  of \nvegetables,  18,000  t  of  organic  vegetables,  and  11,000  t  of  grapes  for  wine  and  juices. \nQualitative  improvements  will  be  realized  for  80,000  t  of  fruits,  17,000  t  of  Chinese  dates, \n30,000 t of sweet potatoes, 18,000 t of pepper and garlic, 2,500 t of mushrooms, 540 t of ginko, \n700 t of high-value herbs, 5,000 t each of concentrated soybean proteins and peanut products, \nand  1,000  t  of  quality  vegetable  seed.  The  Project  will  also  support  additional  production  of \n24,000 t of pork, 12,000 t of piglets, 3,000 t of processed beef, 6,000 t of milk, 3,000 t of wool, \n3,000  t  of  eggs,  2,000  t  of  honey,  and  100,000  t  of  animal  feed.  To  facilitate  production  and \nmarketing  of  farm  produce,  the  Project  will  support  the  construction  of  markets  and  storage \nfacilities for about 3,700 t of perishable and semiperishable commodities, and packing materials; \nand 120,000 t of organic fertilizers, farm machines, and tools. \n \n53. \nAt  present,  about  850,000  farm  households  are  supplying  their  farm  produce  to  the \nprocessors and other marketing concerns. With project support, about 600,000 additional farm \nhouseholds  are  expected  to  benefit  with  the  formalized  contract  arrangements  in  terms  of \naccess  to  improved  production  packages,  increased  productivity,  improved  quality  of  output, \nreduced postharvest losses, and assured fair prices. The total value of additional production of \nprocessed  output  is  estimated  as  CNY3.2  billion,  which  will  entail  an  estimated  additional \nincome of CNY600\u2013CNY700 per year per farm household. \n \nB. \n \n54. \nThe  investments  by  participating  enterprises  under  the  Project  include  establishment, \nmodernization,  and  refurbishment  of  processing  lines;  and  technical  support  and  services  to \ncontracted  farmers  for  the  supply  of  improved-quality  raw  materials.  The  adoption  of  farming \nimprovements  and  associated  investments  by  farmers  is  contingent  on  access  to  improved \ninputs, technical and financial support, and assured fair prices. The Project will provide these to \nthe  contracted  farmers  under  the  partnership  arrangements  through  the  existing  extension \nservices  and  participating  enterprises.  The  contracted  farmers  will  be  paid  predetermined  fair \nprices for the output. Farmers and the enterprises will reasonably share the value added by the \n\nFinancial Analysis of Agroenterprises \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\nProject.  Integration  of  farmers\u2019  inputs  with  the  support  services  and  other  investments  of \nenterprises  will  increase  benefits  to  farmers.  Considering  this  feature  of  the  Project,  each \nparticipating agroenterprise's financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is calculated on the basis of \nintegrating activities of constructing a processing plant and associated production base, as well \nas providing support services.  \n \n55. \nThe FIRRs, computed on an after-tax basis, range from 15% to 22% for the partnerships \nin Henan province, 17% to 25% for the partnerships in Shandong province, and 14% to 25.5% \nfor  the  partnerships  in  Gansu  province.  The  FIRR  results  compare  favorably  with  respective \nweighted  average  costs  of  capital,  estimated  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the \nFinancial  Analysis  and  Management  of  Projects  (2005),  using  the  relative  proportions  of  each \nsource  in  total  agroenterprise  financing  and  their  relative  cost.  For  agroenterprise  equity \nfinancing, a rate of 12% is assumed. The resulting weighted average cost of capital is 6.72%. \nThe analysis suggests that the investments are financially viable.  \n \n56. \nThe sensitivity analysis shows that the FIRRs are relatively robust to adverse changes in \nproject costs and delays in project implementation. However, the FIRRs show a relatively high \nsensitivity  to  changes  in  yields  and  output  prices.  Special  attention  will  have  to  be  given  to \nfactors that may affect yields, and quality of crops and livestock in the project area, such as the \nquality of infrastructure works; maintenance of facilities; and utilization of appropriate crop and \nlivestock production techniques, which will be channeled through technical support and farmers \ntraining in the project area. Strong demand in domestic and international markets suggests that \nthe risks of declines in revenues of this magnitude are small. The past performance and existing \nmanagement  capacity  of  the  agroenterprises  are  sufficient  to  maintain  the  operating  and \nfinancial efficiencies. Based on projected financial statements over the 20 years of the analysis, \nall agroenterprises satisfy financial performance criteria and have satisfactory debt\u2013equity, debt \nservice coverage, current, and quick ratios. The financial analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \nC. \n \n57. \nFarm  output  is  expected  to  increase  by  20%\u201325%.  This  will  be  realized  through  the \nadoption  of  improved  farm  technologies  and  practices  that  will  lead  to  (i)  increased  yields  of \ngrains and cotton; vegetables and fruit crops; and other high-value crops such as condiments, \nherbs,  medicinal  plants,  mushrooms,  livestock,  dairy,  and  poultry  products;  (ii)  savings  in  the \nuse  of  agricultural  inputs;  and  (iii)  reduction  of  postharvest  losses.  In  addition,  higher \nproductivity will be realized through higher efficiencies from conserved water and soil resources. \nThe use of inorganic fertilizer is expected to decrease by 20%\u201325% and the use of pesticides by \n25%\u201330%. The use of organic fertilizer is expected to increase by 40%\u201350%. Overall, net farm \nproduction costs are expected to increase, given the larger volume of organic fertilizers that will \nbe applied. However, this will be offset by increased value of outputs and increased prices for \nhigh-quality production. \n \n58. \nThe Project will generate both direct and indirect benefits. Direct economic benefits are \nderived  from  increases  in  farm  productivity  and  diversification  of  cropping  patterns  to  higher-\nvalue  food,  vegetable,  and  fruit  crops;  increased  livestock  products;  and  increases  in  the \nproduction  and  marketing  of  processed  products.  Indirect  economic  benefits  are  derived  from \nthe environmental benefits, which will be realized  through improved and increased agricultural \nproductivity and farming practices that (i) improve soil nutrition and quality; (ii) reduce wind and \nwater  erosion  of  soil,  and  reduce  water  runoff;  (iii)  increase  water  retention  in  fragile  soil;  and \n(iv) reduce soil salinity. \n \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n\fin  accordance  with \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nAn  environmental  assessment  was  conducted \n\nTo  estimate  the  Project\u2019s  economic  viability,  the  financial  investment  costs  including \n59. \nphysical  contingencies,  were  converted  to  economic  costs  by  adjusting  taxes  and  duties,  and \napplying conversion factors to the shares of foreign costs, unskilled and skilled labor, and other \ncosts.  The  resultant  values  represent  the  economic  capital  costs  of  the  Project  using  the \ndomestic  price  numeraire.  All  other  local  currency  costs  are  assumed  to  equal  their  economic \ncosts, after deducting taxes and duties. The Project\u2019s estimated economic internal rate of return \naggregated  for  all  the  partnerships  is  about  36.4%,  including  project  management  costs.  The \neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  for  the  individual  partnerships  exceed  the  economic  cost  of \ncapital, which is assumed to be 12%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the returns to the overall \nProject,  farming  operations,  and  partnerships  are  generally  robust;  while  the  distribution \nanalysis shows a balanced distribution of economic and financial net present value between the \nagroenterprises and farmers. The detailed economic analysis is presented in Appendix 12. \n \nD. \n \n60. \nthe  PRC\u2019s \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  system  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  Initial \nand  summary  environmental  examination  reports  were  prepared  including  environmental \nmanagement  plans  (Supplementary  Appendixes  E  and  F).  Benefits  to  the  environment  will \ninclude  (i)  improved  soil  nutrition  and  quality;  (ii)  reduced  water  runoff,  and  wind  and  water \nerosion  of  soil;  (iii)  increased  water  retention  in  fragile  soil;  and  (iv)  reduced  soil  salinity.  The \npossible adverse environmental impacts will be prevented or minimized to an acceptable level if \nthe  environmental  management  plan  set  out  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  and  the \nGovernment's environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are effectively implemented.  \n \nE. \n \n61. \nDespite  the  increasing  number  of  rural  residents  migrating  to  urban  areas  for  jobs, \nconsiderable  surplus  labor  exists  in  the  project  area.  Rural  underemployment  in  the  three \nproject  provinces  is  high,  estimated  at  27  million  (3.7  million  in  Gansu,  13.1  million  in  Henan, \nand 10.2 million in Shandong). Off-farm income accounts for 40% of per capita net income and \nis  increasingly  important  with  more  than  25%  of  rural  laborers  not  fully  employed  in  farming. \nWith the Project, a total of about 128,000 households in Gansu, 218,000 in Henan, and 254,000 \nin  Shandong  will  be  engaged  in  improvements  and  expansion  of  farm  production  bases.  This \namounts to about 2.4 million rural residents. Females comprise about 50% of the population in \nthe  project  area.  The  Project  is  expected  to  generate  a  total  of  about  34,200  new  jobs  in  the \nagroenterprises. Currently, more than 40% of employees working in agroprocessing are female, \nand the ratio may increase with the Project as agroprocessors state that women are preferred \nas they tend to maintain product quality standards better than men. \n \nF. \n \n62. \nThe project area covers 27 counties, cities, and districts in three provinces. In 2006, the \naverage  farm  income  in  the  project  area  was  CNY2,247,  63%  of  the  national  average  of \nCNY3,587.  Institutional  constraints  (farmer  fragmentation  and  lack  of  bargaining  power)  mean \nrising grain prices benefit grain dealers more than farmers, who also face rising farm input costs \nand  continuing  land  degradation.  Poverty  in  the  project  area  is  high  (27%,  including  39%  in \nHenan,  21%  in  Shandong,  and  20%  in  Gansu),  and  6%  of  residents  live  in  absolute  poverty \nthe  Government.  Rural \nqualifying \nunderemployment  is  high.  Off-farm  income  accounts  for  40%  of  per  capita  net  income  and  is \nincreasingly  important.  The  rural\u2013urban  income  ratio  was  about  35:65  in  2006  and  the  gap  is \n\nliving  guarantee  payments \n\nPoverty Impact \n\nfor  minimum \n\nEmployment \n\nfrom \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\n\f 20 \n\nGender and Development \n\nexpected to widen. With the Project, a total of about 600,000 farm households and about 34,200 \nnewly employed agroprocessing workers will directly benefit. With few assets and average farm \nsize of only about 0.28 ha, farmers are highly vulnerable to the impacts of land degradation and \nnatural  or  economic  shocks,  and  have  little  or  no  ability  to  cope  with  the  costs  and  risks  of \nchanging  to  more  sustainable  farming  practices.  They  have  little  ability  to  negotiate,  either  in \nterms  of  prices  paid  for  inputs  or  produce  prices  on  the  open  market.  Strengthening  vertical \nrelationships between agroenterprises and farmers can improve farmers\u2019 access to higher-value \nmarkets, technologies, and employment opportunities; and improve transfer efficiencies, supply \nsecurity, and quality control for the enterprise. The per capita income of the project beneficiaries \nis  expected  to  increase  by  CNY122\u2013CNY2,190  per  year  depending  on  the  nature  of  the \npartnership  with  the  agroenterprise.  Agroprocessing  workers  on  average  earn  more  than \nCNY6,000  per  year.  On  average,  real  per  capita  income  of  the  participating  households  will \nincrease by about 25%, moving poor households out of poverty and reducing their risk of sliding \nback into poverty. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 13. \n \n63. \nOf  the  27  project  counties,  cities,  and  districts  one  county\u2014Zhangjiachuan\u2014is  a  Hui \nautonomous county. In fact, Hui minority members make up 70% of the population. To ensure \nthat  the  Hui  benefit  from  the  Project,  three  existing  enterprises  were  selected  in  the  county \nunder  one  partnership.  All  three  enterprises  are  owned  by  Hui  and  about  70%  of  the  existing \ncontracted farmers are Hui. An additional 6,000 farm households will benefit from the expansion \nof these three enterprises. For Zhangjiachuan County, MOA and the implementing agency have \nagreed  to  encourage  the  contracting  of  Hui  households,  especially  the  poor  and  women,  and \nwill monitor progress and report the results to ADB. \n \nG. \n \n64.  Women in the project area undertake a greater share of farming work than men, both as \nlaborers  and  farm  owners,  as  men  have  higher  rates  (10%\u201320%)  of  seasonal  migration \ncompared  to  women  (3%\u20139%).  However,  women  tend  to  lag  men  in  terms  of  (i) education;  \n(ii)  direct  access  to  farm  inputs,  new  technologies,  and  skills;  and  (iii) representation  and \ndecision-making roles in public affairs. Project activities will ensure that project benefits accrue \nequitably to men and women by (i) ensuring equitable access to technology, advice and training, \ninformation,  markets,  and  employment  in  agroenterprises  and  farm  production;  (ii)  ensuring \nwomen\u2019s  representation  in  project  management,  advisory  services,  and  farmers  groups;  and  \n(iii) strengthening collaboration between project management and relevant organizations, such \nas local branches of the All-China Women\u2019s Federation and local poverty reduction offices, and \nlearn from their experiences in the field. A gender action plan is in Appendix 14. \n \nH. \n \nThe  Project  does  not  require  any  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement.  All \n65. \nproduction  expansion  will  be  on  existing  farm  and  agroenterprise  land.  In  addition,  ethnic \nminorities make up less than 1% of the target population and the Project will benefit them. No \nadverse effects are expected on their livelihoods or cultural heritage. \n \nI. \n \n66. \nThe repayment risk will be shared by the provincial governments, participating city and \ncounty  governments,  and  enterprises.  The  local  governments  guarantee  the  repayment  of \ndisbursed  loan  funds.  In  the  case  of  repayment  default,  the  provincial  governments  agree  to \ndeduct amounts due from the public budgets of the city and county governments.  As a result, \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\nResettlement  \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nthe  local  governments  have  a  strong  incentive  to  partner  with  successful  private  commercial \nagricultural companies to channel inputs to the farmers and link farmers\u2019 outputs to the market. \nTo  mitigate  the  risk  of  crop  losses  due  to  climate  change  and  other  natural  disasters,  the \nprovincial  governments  will  design  and  implement  agricultural  insurance  schemes  to  provide \nneeded compensation to the participating farmers against crop losses due to natural disasters. \nGansu,  Henan,  and  Shandong  provinces  will  implement  the  risk  mitigation  schemes  in \naccordance with ongoing schemes in Henan province being assisted by ADB TA.20 \n \nFinancial  risks  associated  with  the  participating  enterprises  have  been  substantially \n67. \nmitigated  through  the  stringent  selection  of  the  participating  enterprises.  The  financial \nmanagement  assessment,  financial  analysis  and  projections,  and  other  due  diligence  review \ncomplement  the  risk  mitigation  efforts.  Financial  projections  for  the  participating  enterprises \nindicate  that  except  for  the  initial  1\u20133  years  when  the  processing  capacity  will  not  be  fully \nestablished due to project construction, these participating enterprises will be able to satisfy all \nkey financial performance ratios, which are comparable with market leaders in the PRC. As one \nof  the  assurances,  these  ratios  will  be  covenanted  in  the  legal  document.  In  addition,  the \nparticipating  enterprises  will  be  prohibited  from  declaring  a  dividend  if  such  payment  would \ncause the covenanted ratios to fall below the specified minimum values.  \n \n68. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  indicates  that  the  local  governments  have \naccumulated  considerable  experience  from  ADB-  and  World  Bank-financed  projects  and  are \nfamiliar with ADB\u2019s requirements for the preparation and processing of withdrawal applications \nand financial management of ADB-financed projects. The financial management systems of the \nparticipating  enterprises  meet  the  requirements  for  undertaking  their  respective  activities. \nProject  implementation  will  involve  training  and  capacity  improvement  activities.  Mitigation \nmeasures  are  designed  to  strengthen  financial  management  capacity  and  mitigate  residual \ncontrol  risks,  and  include  (i)  recruitment  of  well-trained  project  management  and  accounting \nstaff, (ii) preparation of a project financial management manual, (iii) well-designed and focused \ntraining by ADB\u2019s resident mission, (iv) establishment of a management information system to \nmonitor the execution of contract farming, and (v) strengthening of the control and accountability \nmechanism.  \n \nThe  major  impetus  for  the  adoption  of  improved  farm  technologies  and  cultivation \n69. \npractices will be the provision of incentives for farmers in the form of secure market outlets and \nprices. The same is true for the output from agroenterprise processing plants. Market analysis \nindicates that the market share obtained by Chinese exporters will continue to grow. However, a \nnumber of related factors pose a risk in this respect: (i) Chinese processed food products must \ncontinue  to  satisfy  market  preferences,  and  comply  with  national  and  international  quality \nstandards;  (ii)  demand  may  be  negatively  impacted  if  Chinese  agricultural  imports  in  major \nmarkets  fail  to  meet  international  quality  and  safety  standards;  (iii)  importing  countries  may \nimpose  adverse  trade  measures  against  Chinese  products;  and  (iv) appreciation  of  the  yuan \nmay  increase  the  cost  of  Chinese  exports  compared  to  those  of  competitors.  The  Project  is \ndesigned to mitigate these risks to the extent possible by including agroenterprises that have an \nestablished record of supplying products that meet stringent international standards. In addition, \nduring implementation, agroenterprises and project agencies will promote improvement of farm \ncultivation  and  product  quality  standards  including,  for  example,  collaboration  with  ChinaGAP \nand other standards agencies to facilitate raw material traceability and enhance quality. \n \n \n                                                 \n20 ADB.  2007.

The  provincial  governments  will  continue \nagricultural risk mitigation measures to assist farmers participating in the Project \nin the event of natural disasters through provision of compensation, training, and \nservices.  \n\nEnvironmental  and  social  safeguards.  The  provincial  governments,  IAs,  and \nparticipating  enterprises  will  ensure \nimplementation  procedures \n(including prior ADB approval requirements) agreed upon with ADB are followed \nincluding environmental and social safeguard requirements in the Government's \nEIAs.  \n\nthat \n\nthe \n\nThe  provincial  governments,  IAs,  and  participating  enterprises  will  ensure  that \ncivil  works  contractor  specifications  include  (a)  provisions  relating  to  the \nenvironment  including  obligating  contractors  to  carry  out  the  mitigating  and \nmonitoring  measures  specified  in  the  relevant  government  EIA,  and  (b) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\frequirement  for  contractors  to  estimate  costs  for  all  such  mitigating  and \nmonitoring measures. \n\n(viii)  The  provincial  governments,  IAs,  and  participating  enterprises  will  ensure  that \nthe  activities  do  not  result  in  involuntary  resettlement,  and  any  land  acquisition \nthat may be required is adequately compensated in line with a resettlement plan \nprepared  in  accordance  with  applicable  PRC  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n\nThe provincial governments and IAs will cause the participating enterprises and \nfarmers  to  operate,  maintain,  and  monitor  all  project  facilities\u2014including  water \ntreatment  plants  and  associated  pipelines,  wastewater \ntreatment  plants, \nwastewater collection systems, and solid waste systems\u2014in strict conformity with \n(a)  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  including  national  and  local  regulations \nand  standards  for  environmental  protection,  health,  labor,  and  occupational \nsafety; (b) ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002); and (c) the environmental mitigating \nand monitoring measures detailed in the applicable government EIAs. \n\nThe provincial governments will cause IAs and participating enterprises to ensure \nthat  annual  environmental  reports  are  submitted  to  ADB,  commencing  from  the \nstart of project implementation until 1 year after the commencement of operation \nof the project facilities.

Objectives  include  improving  farm  and  off-\nfarm  income  opportunities,  increasing  grain  production,  developing  agribusinesses  and  farmer \norganizations, and adopting standards  and  capacity  to  address  environmental  issues.2 Growth \nin  agroenterprises  provides  opportunities  for  people  to  leave  farming  and  enter  off-farm \nemployment,  facilitating  more  sustainable  farm  structure  and  practices  by  reducing  population \npressure  on  the  land.  Higher-quality  products  require  supply-side  strengthening,  providing \nefficiency  gains  and  improving  prices  to  farmers  through  better  coordination  with  enterprises, \nagents, support services, and access to financial resources. \n \n\n2. \n\nAgricultural Finance \n\n \n2. \nProject  area  agribusinesses  need  financing  to  develop  processing  and  increase  raw \nmaterial  supply.  The  Agricultural  Development  Bank  of  China  provides  agricultural  enterprises \nwith overdrafts or similar short-term funds suited for seasonal working capital but not for long-\nterm working capital and fixed assets. Lending in rural areas is a low priority for banks as they \nundergo reform and serve the more readily accessible urban markets, which require a smaller \ninvestment  in  branches  compared  to  the  customer  base.  A  successful  approach  is  to  provide \ncredit  through  district  offices  of  the  provincial  financial  bureaus  to  farmers  who  are  linked  to \nagroenterprises  or  farmer  organizations  with  marketing  contracts. 3  The  county  or  district \nfinancial  bureau  takes  responsibility  for  ensuring  repayment  of  loans  to  selected  small  farmer \ngroups, which provide joint security and liability. However, use of financial bureaus is a stopgap, \nwhich does not address the fundamental market failure. \n \n\n3. \n\nAgriculture and Land Degradation \n\n \n3. \nPredominant farming systems involve wheat, corn, and livestock on very small and often \nfragmented plots, with minor higher-value crops such as vegetables and fruit. Demand for crop \nresidues for fuel and fodder means the return to the soil is not sufficient to control erosion and \nmaintain  fertility.  Several  aspects  of  land  degradation  are  highly  visible  and  well-recognized \nsuch  as  (i)  deeply  gullied  slopes,  (ii)  river  sediment  and  dust  storms,  and  (iii)  increasing \ndesertification.  Large  erosion  gullies  not  only  cause  problems  in  terms  of  soil  loss  and  land \nmovement,  but  also  divide  fields  into  small  units,  difficult  to  access  by  farm  machinery. \nTraditional removal of crop residue and inappropriate cultivation reduce soil organic matter and \nincrease erosion of the most fertile surface soil. Surveys showed soil organic matter is less than \n1%, compared to the recommended 10%.4 This leads to poor fertility and soil structure, a need \nfor higher fertilizer rates, decreased water infiltration, greater water runoff and erosion, and poor \ncrop  emergence  thereby  damaging  soil  and  reducing  water  availability.  A  solution  requires \nbuilding  farmers\u2019  awareness  and  knowledge  of  sustainable  agricultural  practices,  services  for \nto  conservation  agriculture \nfertilizer  recommendations  based  on  soil  analysis,  access \n\n                                                 \n1  Communist Party of China Central Committee. 2006.

The  traditional  rain-fed  wheat  and  corn \ncropping system is dominant on both flatland and terraced hillsides; and the fragile nature of the \nsoil,6 deforestation, overgrazing, and removal of crop residues for fuel and fodder have resulted \nin the project area being some of the most degraded land in the country. Poverty in the project \narea  is  high  (27%),  6%  of  residents  live  in  absolute  poverty,  qualifying  for  minimum  living \nguarantee  payments  from  the  government.  Rural  underemployment  is  high.  The  rural\u2013urban \nincome ratio was about 35:65 in 2006 and the gap is expected to widen. Poverty and land data \nfor the project area is show in Table A2. \n \n\nTable A2: Poverty and Land Data for the Project Area \n\nProject Area \nPopulation \nPopulation in poverty  \nPoverty population (%) \nProject area in absolute poverty (%) \nAverage farmer income per year (CNY) \nArable land (hectare) \nArable land classified as degraded (%) \n\nGansu \n2,168,700    \n432,000 \n\nHenan \n 3,931,300  \n1,543,600 \n\nShandong \n2,108,500       8,208,500     \n2,408,500     \n\n432,900 \n\nTotal \n\n20.0\n6.1\n\n1,664     \n\n281,305 \n60 \n\n39.0\n9.0\n2,805  \n328,200 \n36 \n\n21.0 \n2.5 \n\n2,271 \n201,442 \n25 \n\n27.0\n5.9\n\n2,247     \n\n810,947 \n40 \n\nAgricultural Production \n\n   Source: Provincial project management offices, township statistics.  \n\n \n \nC. \n \n5. \nGenerally,  production  systems  are  labor-intensive  with  a  high  proportion  of  skilled \nlaborers required. Harvesting, grading, packing, and storage costs account for 65%\u201370% of all \nproduction costs. The use of other inputs varies; for example, access to irrigation depends on \nlocation,  with  supplementary  irrigation  not  available  in  some  areas.  When  combined  with \nmeasured  fertilizer  application,  supplementary  irrigation  reduces  negative  environmental \nimpacts, and can increase yields by 15%\u201320%. Water-saving flood irrigation, water-saving canal \nirrigation, and basin irrigation can save 50%\u201380% of water compared with flood irrigation, which \nis  the  main  method  used  at  present.  Basin  irrigation  uses  approximately  one-fifth  as  much  as \nother water-saving methods, and one sixth as much as flood irrigation.  \n \nFertilizer use is based on a variety of application methods and rates. Farmers use both \n6. \nsingle  nutrient  and  compound  fertilizers,  but  fertilizer  application  is  not  based  on  scientific  soil \nand leaf analyses. Experience in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) indicates that fertilizer \napplication  based  on  the  results  of  soil  analysis  can  reduce  fertilizer  use  by  up  to  30%,  while \nincreasing  fertilizer  efficacy  by  5%\u201310%.  The  use  of  organic  fertilizer  can  reduce  the  use  of \ninorganic  fertilizer  by  30%\u201350%,  with  beneficial  environmental  effects.  However,  almost  all \nfarmland within the project area is currently fertilized using chemical and compound fertilizers. \nAgroenterprises typically inspect the crops grown for quality and safety safeguards, and provide \nfree testing. \n \n\n                                                 \n5  Township is the administrative unit that is more representative of the project area than larger county or provincial \n\nboundaries. \n\n6  Windblown  dust  (loess)  from  ice  age  erosion  of  the  Tibetan  Plateau  deposited  a  deep,  weakly  structured,  and \n\nerosion-prone soil over much of the northern parts of the country. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nIn  recent  years,  the  PRC's  reputation  in  maintaining  food  quality  and  safety  standards \n7. \nhas frequently been called into question. During the first 4 months of 2007, for example, some \n300 Chinese food shipments were stopped by the United States Food and Drug Administration. \nTo  address  these  concerns,  the  PRC  initiated  ChinaGAP,  a  program  to  promote  good \nagricultural  practices.  ChinaGAP  was  launched  in  April  2006  and  will  eventually  match \nstandards  laid  down  for  certified  producers  supplying  European  markets  (GLOBALGAP).7 The \nChinaGAP pilot program covers 14 provinces including Henan.  \n \nD. \n \n\nAgroenterprises and Farmers \n\n1. \n\nContract Farming  \n\n \n8. \nMillions  of  very  small-scale  farm  households  in  the  PRC  are  unable  to  compete\u2014to \nrespond to changes in domestic demand and withstand pressure from international markets\u2014\nwithout changing their production and trading structures. Evidence from the PRC and elsewhere \nindicates  a  need  to  strengthen  processor\u2013farmer  linkages  through  contracts,  alliances,  and \nother relationships.8 Contract farming offers a means to efficiently connect small-scale farmers \nand large-scale food processing firms.  \n \n9. \nContract farming in the PRC has grown rapidly over the past 10 years. Initially, contract \nfarming developed in the economically advanced coastal provinces. Now, it is spreading rapidly \ninto underdeveloped areas of the central and western PRC. The agribusiness model has proven \npotential to improve farm incomes.9 Driven by their need for quality standardized raw materials, \nand efficient and more secure supply chains, firms contract farmers to join them in production \nsystems  that  often  involve  the  transfer  of  new  technology,  training  and  technical  assistance, \ncredit  for  inputs,  and  access  to  new  and  higher-value  markets.  Surveys  found  that  farmers \nidentify price stability and market access as key advantages to contracts, while firms consider \nimproved product quality the critical incentive to exercise contracts. \n \nAssessment  of  contracts  and  discussion  with  farmers  and  enterprises  during  project \n10. \npreparation  found  that,  in  general,  contract  performance  is  dependent  on  the  contract  being \nclear  enough  to  ensure  mutual  understanding  by  each  party  of  contract  specifications.  In  the \nproject  area,  the  district  department  of  commerce  provides  protection  for  both  parties \nimplementing a contract on three levels (i) firms must submit contract forms for assessment and \npreapproval prior to signing by farmers; (ii) copies of preapproved contracts signed by farmers \nand enterprises are lodged with the department, which confirms any individual variations to the \npreapproved form; and (iii) any dispute is arbitrated by the department. \n \n11. \nA recent survey of more than 1,000 farmers found only 20% had written contracts with \nagroenterprises,  but  that  76%  of  farmers  would  like  to  be  involved  in  contract  farming  if  they \nwere  offered  the  opportunity  (footnote  9).  Of  those  farmers  with  contracts,  most  (60%)  had \nnever had a conflict with the other party in their contract; 35% had infrequent conflict about price \nand  quality,  which  was  resolved  by  negotiation  between  farmer  and  processor;  and  only  2% \nwere resolved in court. Contracts were written or verbal. Verbal contracts are used primarily by \nagents and written contracts are used by firms. Verbal contracts tend to be in mature industries, \nsuch as beef, where price determinants are commonly understood and a historical relationship \n\n                                                 \n7  Due to its expanding international role in establishing good agricultural practices, EurepGAP announced the change \n\nin its title and logo to GLOBALGAP in September 2007. \n\n8  Da Silva, Carlos. 2005.

Firms prefer written contracts that clearly specify rights \nand responsibilities for both parties and are common in new industries such as for processing \ncrops  where  quality  specifications  and  standardized  practices  are  required  for  processing \nsystems and standards certification. Project support to agroenterprises will provide smallholder \nfarmers the contract opportunities they want and need to continue their livelihoods.  \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Dragon-Head Model \n\n \n12. \nSince  the  1990s,  the  Government  developed  a  particular  variant  of  the  vertically \nintegrated  contract  farming  model,  which  is  generally  referred  to  as  \u201cdragon  head.\u201d  In  this \nmodel,  the  largest  and  strongest  agribusiness  enterprises  are  given  support  to  accelerate \ndevelopment of sustainable commercial partnerships between the enterprise and farmers. ADB \nhas  supported  this  model  in  a  series  of  projects  since  199510 and  it  is  now  a  well-established \nand  demonstrated  variant  of  the  vertically  integrated  contract  farming  model.  This  state  and \nprovincial status entitles the firm to reduced taxes and other benefits. In exchange for their role \nin rural development, the dragon-head firms receive support from all levels of government and, \nsince 2002, financing from the Agricultural Development Bank of China. Criteria for  the  award \ninclude  economic  strength,  operating  scale,  technology  and  management,  and  potential  to \nimprove farm incomes (footnote 9). Smaller enterprises can avail of local privileges but do not \nhave access to development funds. \n \nAt  present,  eight  agroenterprises  in  the  project  area  are  designated  as  dragon-head \n13. \nsize,  although  most  conform  to  the  vertically  integrated  model  including  a  few  hundred \nagroenterprises  certified  to  specific  standards.  The  benefits  of  the  contract  farming  model\u2014\nminimizing  transaction  costs  in  light  of  uncertainty,  asset  specificity,  and  market  failures  in \nchanging  food  systems\u2014is  the  commercial  rationale  for  farmers  and  agroenterprises  to \nstrengthen  their  vertical  integration.  Evidence  of  socioeconomic  benefits  from  the  PRC  and \nelsewhere  provides  a  strong  development  rationale  strengthening  processor\u2013farmer  linkages \nthrough contracts and other forms of vertical integration (footnotes 8 and 9). \n \n14. \nOnly  three  enterprises  (9%)  meet  the  national  requirements  for  their  region  (mostly  in \nHenan,  which  targeted  larger  enterprises)  and  only  four  enterprises  (14%)  can  meet  the \nprovincial  criteria  (mostly  in  Gansu  province,  which  has  the  lowest  size  criteria).  An  additional \nprovince (5%) could meet the local municipal criteria.11 Return on assets would exclude a few. \nEach  enterprise  meets  the  project  financial  criteria 12 but  government  dragon-head  criteria  are \neven stricter. Overall, 77% of sponsors do not meet national or provincial dragon-head criteria, \nand 71% are unable to meet even the municipal criteria in terms of size. Despite their inability to \nmeet  the  requirements,  the  agroenterprises  provide  contract  support  and  market  access  to \nabout 850,000 farm households and more than 2 million family members.  \n\n                                                 \n10 The dragon-head concept was significantly developed in ADB. 1995.

project activities were reviewed in the context of the selection criteria. A key \n1. \naspect of the Project is to extend the demonstrated success of the vertically integrated model to \npoorer rural areas. This requires partnerships with smaller enterprises. To counter the risks this \ninvolves particular emphasis is placed on due diligence of the sponsor and the criteria applied \nare significantly stricter than in conventional Asian Development Bank (ADB)-supported projects \ndealing with large enterprises. During project preparation, the participating provinces proposed \nabout  150 potential  partnerships  between  agroenterprises  and  farmers.  Selections  from  these \nlists were made in partnership with provinces and other stakeholders by applying the following \ncriteria.  \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial and Economic Criteria. The following criteria apply: \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  partnerships  are  financially  sound  and  cost-effective  as  determined  by  a \nfinancial and economic analysis with \n(a) \n\na  minimum  financial  internal  rate  of  return  higher  than  the  weighted \naverage cost of capital, and \na minimum economic internal rate of return of 12%. \n\nnet profits in each year, \ndebt\u2013equity ratios in each year not exceeding 1.5,1 \ndebt service cover of not less than 1.5,  \ncurrent ratios in each year not less than 1.5, and \nquick ratios of not less than 0.8. \n\n(b) \nThe agroenterprise has shown audited accounts for 3 years showing \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \nProjected  financial  statements  show  viable  operation  for  not  less  than  the \nproposed loan period with financial ratios of \n(a) \n(b) \n\ndebt\u2013equity ratios in each year not exceeding 1.5, \ncurrent  ratios  in  each  year  after  commencement  of  production  not  less \nthan 1.5, \nquick ratio of not less than 0.8, and \ndebt service cover not less than 1.5 in any year during the loan period. \n\n(c) \n(d) \n\n(iv)  Most labor employed by the agroenterprise is local. \n(v) \n\nAn  assured  supply  of  raw  materials  is  within  a  reasonable  distance  of  the \nprocessing facility. \nThe agroenterprise promotes economic growth in poor areas and gives priority to \npoor farmers to produce agricultural outputs needed by the processing facilities.  \n\n(vi) \n\n3. \n\nSocial Criteria. These include the following: \n\n(i) \n\nThe partnership supports poverty reduction efforts of the national and provincial \ngovernments.  \n\n(ii)  Water  and  land  rights  are  owned  or  leased  and  operated  by  the  participating \n\nbeneficiaries for project-supported activities.  \n\n                                                 \n1  Debt\u2013equity ratio is defined as total liabilities divided by equity. Debt service coverage ratio is net operating income \ndivided  by  annual  debt  service.  Current  ratio  is  current  assets  divided  by  current  liabilities.  Quick  ratio  is  current \nassets less inventory divided by current liabilities. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nLow-income  households  are  identified  and  selected  as  much  as  possible  in \npartnership  with \nthe  county  project  management  office,  sponsoring \nagroenterprise, farmers association, local village leaders, rural poverty reduction \noffices, and other community-based organizations. \n\n(iv)  Women are given preference in participation and employment opportunities.  \n\n4. \n\nEnvironmental Criteria. The criteria include the following: \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe proposed activities are assessed pursuant to the laws and regulations of the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  the  Environment  Policy  (2002)  of  the  ADB, \nand  the  initial  environmental  examination  to  be  approved  by  the  appropriate \ngovernment authorities and ADB. \nActivities do not entail new clearing of forestland or seek to replace any natural \necosystem with designed agricultural systems and rural infrastructure. \nNo development, including  operation  of  new  processing  lines,  will  have  a  water \ndemand  that  jeopardizes  ongoing  use  at  existing  volumes  of  existing  users \nincluding downstream and shared reservoir users. \nAn  environmental  impact  assessment  report  prepared  for  each  activity  and \nsubmitted  to  an  authorized  environmental  protection  agency  for  review  and \napproval, includes an environmental management plan with mitigation measures \nand financial sources as a prerequisite for approval of funding. A monitoring and \nenforcement  program  ensures  that  project  activities  have  no  major  adverse \nenvironmental impacts. \nPublic  consultation  is  part  of  the  environmental  assessment  for  each  activity \nbased  on  public  involvement  procedures  and  guidelines  of  the  PRC  and  ADB's \nEnvironment Policy. \n\n \nDue Diligence Analysis \n\nB. \n\n \n\n5. \nThe  financial  criteria  were  applied  to  the  last  3  years  of  audited  accounts  of  each \nagroenterprise  to  confirm  profitability  and  soundness  of  financing  (Table  A5).  In  some  cases, \nagroenterprises did not fully meet all the financial criteria and were subjected to a more detailed \nreview. In some cases, a specific ratio can be misleading. For example, substantial repayment \nof short-term debt may produce an apparently \u201cpoor\u201d debt service ratio or the indicated problem \ncould already be corrected. Also, poor quick ratios may be corrected by refinancing short-term \ndebt with longer-term debt and equity. Where these exceptions are selected to participate in the \nProject, the reasons are clearly stated in the financial statements (Supplementary Appendix C). \nThe  financial  management  capacity  of  every  enterprise  was  reviewed  in  the  context  of  the \ncomprehensive financial management assessment (Supplementary Appendix C). \n \nTable  A5  presents  the  worst  performance  scenario  of  each  enterprise  against  each \n6. \nfinancial criterion for the project period and subsequent 20 years of operation. Parallel outputs \nof  the  model  provide  the  basis  for  cost  estimates  and  financial  plans  in  Appendix  7,  and  the \nfinancial and economic analyses in Appendix 12. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n

DEMONSTRATING SUSTAINABLE FARMING PRACTICES \n\n \n1. \nThe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  has  made  several  regional  and  national \nassessments of the cost and other impacts of land degradation. In 1999, total direct costs were \nestimated  at  $7.7  billion  about  4%  of  the  gross  domestic  product,  while  indirect  costs  were \n$31 billion.1 Regional impacts were greatest in the western region, and assessments show that \nwhile the return to farmer investment in soil conservation in the Yangtse valley is high, this is not \nso  in  the  project  area  (Yellow  River  and  the  loess  region)  and  external  assistance  is  needed. \nPoverty and land degradation are closely correlated. The root causes relate to decreasing land \nper  capita,  poverty  in  fragile  environments,  top\u2013down  application  of  policies  without  local \nparticipation, and sector-driven management initiatives. In farm communities in the project area, \ncauses include improper farming practices on steep slopes, overgrazing, neglect of community \nconservation practices under the new rural system, and use of biomass for household energy. \n \n2. \nNo  simple  solution  is  available.  The  management  of  dryland  project  areas  must  be \ncoordinated  by  the  farmers  and  other  stakeholders  in  a  way  that  makes  clear  sense  to  them. \nPromoting farmers\u2019 understanding and technical ability to cope with the linkages between land \nuse,  soil  fertility,  and  water  is  critical.  A  large  body  of  evidence  shows  that  any  activity  must \ninvolve  a  bottom\u2013up,  participative  approach  for  problem  identification,  selection  of  appropriate \ntechnologies, and planning and implementation of solutions.2 The key to sustainable farming in \nproject areas is to manage land, water, technical, physical, and financial resources in concert. \nImplementing this requires institutional support. \n \n3. \nFarmers  often  view  water  as  the  most  valuable  resource.  Erratic  precipitation  means \nfarmers cannot depend solely on rainfall. Surface water is intermittent rather than consisting of \nperennial streams, and sparse vegetative cover means water may be lost in flashfloods when it \nrains. Surface erosion reduces farm productivity; but worse, deep gullies destroy or isolate fields \nfrom draft animals and machinery. Gully erosion indicates advanced land degradation. Loss of \nfertility is less visible yet almost as severe in impact. However, sustainable farming is possible \nusing a range of techniques including \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nconservation  agriculture  including  cultivation  technology  that  incorporates  crop \nresidues back into the soil and restores soil organic matter, which reduces runoff, \nimproves  the  soil\u2019s  capacity  to  hold  water  and  nutrients,  and  improves  crop \nemergence; \nvegetation  management  and  intercropping  that  can  conserve  existing  water \nsupplies and increase the yield of water for storage;  \nefficient irrigation, mulching, and selection of crops and varieties with inherently \nlow consumptive use that can extend existing water supplies; \ndiversification  from  low-value  and  high-risk  crops  to  alternatives  providing \nopportunities for substantial change to more sustainable farming; \nwater  harvesting  systems  that  are  best  suited  for  livestock,  greenhouses,  and \nsmall-scale  farming,  consisting  of  roofs,  rock  outcrops,  paved  roads,  storage \ntanks, lined wells, underground tanks, and small dams; \nlateral  diversion  and  terracing  that  slow  rainfall  runoff  and  allow  for  diversion \nwatercourses; small earth dams may be constructed across gullies or streams to \nstore water; \n\n                                                 \n1  L.

The objective of the grant is to improve sustainable \nfarming  practices  that  address  land  degradation  and  water  conservation.  The  grant  may  also \nprovide  support  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  implementing  agencies  and  the  project \nperformance  management  system  required  for  successful  implementation  of  the  Project.  The \ngrant  will  be  implemented  in  parallel  with  the  Project\u2019s  activities  involving  agroenterprises  to \nstrengthen opportunities for contracted farmers to adopt new sustainable farming practices and \ntechnologies.  Under  the  Project,  agroenterprises  will  contract  additional  farmers  to  supply \nalternative  and/or  incremental  farm  production.  By  promoting  the  adoption  of  sustainable \nfarming  practices,  the  grant  will  enhance  environmental  outcomes,  strengthen  long-term  rural \npoverty reduction, and reduce supply-chain risks for enterprises. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nImplementation methods will draw on proven participatory and holistic approaches such \nas participatory watershed management and farmer field schools, and build on the interests of \nagroprocessors  through  their  contract  farming  and  other  vertical  relationships.  The  grant  will \nprovide about 40\u201350 sessions of 3- to 5-day training courses to (i) raise farmers\u2019 and agriculture \ntechnicians\u2019  awareness  and  priorities  for  soil  and  water  issues;  (ii)  explain  technologies  and \nsustainable  land  and  farming  practices  using  specialist  resource  persons;  and  (iii)  facilitate \nfarmers,  agroenterprises,  and  local  authorities  to  develop  and  implement  action  plans.  The \nsubjects  covered  will  include  (i)  conservation  agriculture  including  minimum  soil  tillage,  crop \nrotation,  permanent  soil  coverage,  and  specialized  farm  machinery;  (ii)  reduced  soil  erosion \nusing  various  techniques;  (iii)  improved  use  of  organic  fertilizer  and  integrated  pest \nmanagement; and (iv) water harvesting techniques. The grant may also be used to assess the \nimpact of climate change  on  land  degradation.  The  costs  of  implementing  action  plans  will  be \nborne  by  farmers  (including  in  kind  as  labor),  agroenterprises  (such  as  new  varieties  and \nmachinery  services),  and  local  authorities  (including  technical  support  services,  government \nprograms,  and  subsidies  for  biogas  digesters).  The  grant  will  provide  specialist  expertise  for \n\n                                                 \n3  Zhong Li, Yin D., Zhang Y., Zhu H, Yang G., T. Rego and S.P.

Several  PRC  institutions \nand agencies have relevant technical expertise and experience to support the grant. 4 \n \n6. \nThe  grant  will  support  on-farm  activities  associated  with  the  agroenterprises  in  Gansu, \nHenan, and Shandong provinces. The large area and number of farmers mean the grant will be \nspread  thinly  and  therefore,  must  be  carefully  focused  and  coordinated  to  maximize \ncollaborative  application  of  government,  agroenterprise,  and  farmer  resources.  Farmers \norganized  in  groups  will  be  represented  by  leaders  and  other  representatives.  In  line  with  the \nemphasis  on  the  western  region,  Gansu  province  will  be  given  priority  in  training  courses. \nImplementation must be coordinated closely with implementation of agroenterprise activities and \nfund allocation will be based on the number of farmer production bases being supported by the \nProject. Thus, market structures and other off-farm activities are excluded from support. \n \nThe cofinancing grant from the Spanish Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance will \n7. \ncover  the  costs  of  consultants  comprising  about  5  person-months  of  international  and  about \n25 person-months of national experts to be recruited through a firm using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method (80:20). This will cover (i) the preparation and delivery of training (about \n50 short courses) to farmers and agriculture technicians in the project area on participatory soil \nand water management, and sustainable agriculture; (ii)  support  to  local  institutions  in  Gansu, \nHenan,  and  Shandong  provinces  to  facilitate  the  adoption  of  sustainable  agriculture  in \ncollaboration  with  the  training  course  delivery;  and  (iii)  training  materials.  The  national  and \nprovincial  governments  will  provide  office  and  training  facilities,  domestic  travel,  counterpart \nagency  support  service  staff,  and  materials  and  equipment  to  demonstrate  sustainable \nagricultural  technology.  The  provincial  governments,  agroenterprises,  and  farmer  communities \nwill  cover  the  costs  of  implementing  sustainable  agriculture  action  plans  produced  from  the \ntraining.  All  recruitment  will  follow  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n\n                                                 \n4  For example, the Gansu Grassland Ecological Research Center. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nItem\nA.\n\n \n\n \n\nDETAILED INVESTMENT AND FINANCING PLANS\n\nTable A7.1:  Detailed Cost Estimates by Project Component and Province\n($ million)\n\nAgroenterprise and Farm Partnerships\n\n1.

The analysis for the farms assesses the financial viability of the \nproposed  crop  diversification,  improved  environment-friendly  production  technologies,  and \nqualitative improvements of output. The economic payoff to the overall Project is estimated for \nthe  partnerships,  which  includes  incremental  costs  needed  to  provide  project  support  and \nmanagement. \n \n2. \nFor  the  farming  operations,  the  main  direct  benefits  are  from  incremental  production \nrealized  from  (i)  improved  yields;  (ii)  changes  in  the  cropping  pattern  and  crop  diversification, \nwith  introduction  of  high-value  crops  and  fruit  trees;  and  (iii)  quality  of  outputs  that  receive \nhigher  contracted  prices.  This  will  be  achieved  through  intensive  technical  support  from  the \ncounty  agriculture  extension  services,  growers  association,  and  principally  from  technical \nsupport  from  the  contracting  agroenterprise.  The  agroenterprises  will  assist  the  growers  in \nprocuring quality and improved inputs; and in investing in farm tools and machinery, irrigation-\nrelated  equipment  and  civil  works,  and  other  farm  structures  and  civil  works.  These  include \nstores,  poles,  and  wires  for  vineyards;  iron  structures;  and  plastic  sheets  for  greenhouse  or \ntunnel farming. Crop budgets for benefiting farms will increase incomes significantly from crop \ndiversification (Supplementary Appendix D). \n \n3. \nThe  supported  agroenterprises  were  analyzed  with  respect  to  financial  and  economic \nviability. The financial and economic returns for each agroenterprise are shown in Appendix 5. \nThe agroenterprises will benefit from expansion in their production capacity, reduction in output \nwastage  and  postharvest  losses,  and  value  addition  through  improved  quality  production  for \ndomestic and international markets. Generally, the expansion of processing units will take 2\u20133 \nyears. The gestation period for reaching full development for the agroenterprises varies from 3 \nto 5 years. Hence, farm and enterprise production is assumed to attain full development during \nproject implementation. However, fruit crops would reach full development stage in 7\u201310 years. \nThis is accounted for in projecting the incremental cost and benefit streams. \n \nIn  addition  to  the  direct  benefits,  the  Project  will  generate  various  positive  externalities \n4. \nand nonquantifiable benefits. The main benefits include environmental improvement, as a result \nof  arresting  land  degradation  and  loss  of  topsoil  from  erosion;  utilization  and  conservation  of \nscarce  water  resources;  proper  disposal  of  agroenterprise  waste;  and  judicious  use  of \nagrochemicals.  The  expansion  in  farm  productivity  and  introduction  of  high-value  crops,  fruit \ntrees, and livestock will generate significant on-farm and off-farm employment in processing and \nmarketing. The realization of higher incomes by participating farmers will encourage and induce \nnonparticipating farmers to adopt better production practices. This will help stabilize prices and \ncompetition in the market; generate employment for the service sector; and increase household \nincomes,  living  standards,  and  rural  quality  of  life.  The  financial  and  economic  analyses  were \nconducted in accordance with the  Financial  Analysis  and  Management  of  Projects  (2005)  and \nGuidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects (1997) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nAssumptions \n\nDemand Analysis \n\nA. \n \n5. \nThe  financial  and  economic  analyses  are  based  on  the  following  assumptions \n(i) constant 2008 prices and constant exchange rate of $1 = CNY7.74, the rate prevailing at the \ntime  of  data  collection;  (ii)  25-year  period  of  analysis;  (iii)  estimated  investment  costs  for  the \nproduction  bases  and  agroenterprises  based  on  market  prices  delivered  at  the  site  plus \nprovision  of  contingencies;  (iv)  3-year  construction  period  with  productive  capacity  being \ngradually  built  up  within  each  partnership;  (v)  productive  life  of  equipment  is  10  years  and \nreplacement costs are reflected in the cost streams, while salvage values are included in benefit \nstreams;  (vi)  for  the  economic  analysis,  valuation  of  economic  costs  and  benefits  uses  the \ndomestic  price  numeraire;  (vii)  financial  costs  of  traded  goods  are  adjusted  to  their  respective \neconomic  values  using  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.01;  the  shadow  wage  rate  for \nunskilled labor is estimated at 0.80 of the prevailing wage rate; and the conversion factors for \nskilled labor, other costs, and benefits are estimated to be 1.0; (viii) financial investment costs, \nincluding  physical  contingencies,  are  converted  to  economic  values  by  deducting  taxes  and \nduties and applying relevant conversion factors to the investment components, including foreign \ncosts, unskilled and skilled labor, and other costs (the resulting values represent the economic \ninvestment  costs  of  the  Project  according  to  the  domestic  price  numeraire);  and  (ix) all  other \nlocal currency economic costs are assumed to equal their financial costs after deducting taxes \nand duties. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nThe  Project  will  support  (i)  production  of  processed  and  unprocessed  farm  produce;  \n(ii)  supply  of  farm  inputs  including  seeds,  organic  fertilizers,  packing  material,  and  farm \nmachinery;  and  (iii)  additional  marketing-related  infrastructure  such  as  marketplaces  and \nstorage capacity. The major agricultural production activities in the project area include wheat, \ncorn,  cornstarch,  cotton,  vegetables,  grapes,  other  fruits,  sweet  potatoes,  mushrooms,  herbs, \nsoybeans, peanuts, animal feed, pork, beef, milk, wool, eggs, and honey. Project beneficiaries \nwill produce an additional 100,000 tons (t) of wheat, about 80,000 t of wheat products, 10,000 t \nof corn, 30,000 t of cornstarch, 30,000 t of cotton seed and associated products (oil cake and \noil), 80,000 t of vegetables, 18,000 t of organic vegetables, and 11,000 t of grapes for wine and \njuices. Qualitative improvements will be realized for 80,000 t of fruits, 17,000 t of Chinese dates, \n30,000 t of sweet potatoes, 18,000 t of pepper and garlic, 2,500 t of mushrooms, 540 t of ginko, \n700 t of high-value herbs, 5,000 t each of concentrated soybean proteins and peanut products, \nand  1,000  t  of  quality  vegetable  seed.  The  Project  will  also  support  additional  production  of \n24,000 t of pork, 12,000 t of piglets, 3,000 t of processed beef, 6,000 t of milk, 3,000 t of wool, \n3,000  t  of  eggs,  2,000  t  of  honey,  and  100,000  t  of  animal  feed.  To  facilitate  production  and \nmarketing of farm produce, the Project will support the construction of markets (25,000 square \nmeters);  construction  of  storage  facilities  for  about  3,700  t  of  perishable  and  semiperishable \nof  \n(100,000 \ncommodities \n120,000 t of organic fertilizers, farm machines, and tools. \n \n7. \nInformation on supply, demand, prices, and market competition were collected for each \nof  the  29  partnerships.  The  sector  analysis  is  presented  in  Appendix  2,  further  analysis  was \ncarried  out  using  surveys,  focus  group  discussions,  and  field  visits  to  confirm  the  demand  for \nproject  outputs.  Three  partnerships  were  selected  for  in-depth  analysis  based  on  their \ngeographic  location  and  product  type  including  (i)  cattle  and  sheep  production  under  the \nZhangjiangchuan  sustainable  agricultural  partnership  in  Gansu  province,  (ii)  sweet  corn \nproduction under the Anyang\u2013Yuehe sweet corn partnership in Henan province, and (iii) peanut \nprocessing under the Linshu\u2013Changlin peanut partnership in Shangdong province.  \n\npacking  materials \n\nproduction \n\nboxes); \n\nand \n\nand \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n53 \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n \n8. \nThe  analysis  shows  that  unmet  demand  for  production  is  significant  because  of  rising \nincomes in the country; change of food consumption patterns, particularly for livestock and dairy \nproducts;  and  growing  export  demand.  At  present  the  agroprocessing  enterprises\u2019  production \ncapacities  are  constrained  to  meet  growing  demand  in  the  markets.  Given  the  sustained \ncompetitive  and  comparative  advantage,  opportunities  for  expansion  are  significant.  The \nincremental  production  under  the  Project  for  each  partnership  is  small  so  that  no  significant \nimpact  is  expected  on  either  domestic  or  international  prices.  Furthermore,  the  Project  will \nsupport  the  adoption  of  improved  farm  production  technologies,  shift  to  higher-value  crops, \nexpansion in value-addition infrastructure, improvement in the quality of outputs, and reduction \nin  postharvest  losses  (storage  facilities  and  marketing  infrastructure)  that  will  strengthen  the \ncompetitiveness of the farmers and agro-enterprises in the markets. \n \nC. \n \n9. \nCrop budgets were estimated for both with- and without-project situations for traditional \ncrops.  The  introduced  higher-value  crops  will  result  in  significantly  higher  gross  margins.  In \nGansu province, the entire area under wheat will likely be replaced with higher-value crops. Also \nin Henan province, almost the entire area under traditionally grown crops\u2014wheat and corn\u2014will \nbe substituted by high-value crops. In Shandong province, the Project will result in higher crop \nintensities  of  existing  crops.  Higher  incomes  are  expected  to  be  realized  from  better  crop \nhusbandry and adoption of technology packages. \n \n10. \nThe  investments  of  participating  enterprises  under  the  Project  include  establishment, \nmodernization,  and  refurbishment  of  processing  lines;  and  technical  support  and  services  to \ncontracted  farmers  for  the  supply  of  improved  quality  raw  materials.  The  adoption  of  farming \nimprovements and associated investment by farmers is contingent on access to improved inputs, \ntechnical  and  financial  support,  and  assured  fair  prices.  The  Project  will  provide  these  to \ncontracted farmers under the partnership arrangements through the existing extension services \nand participating enterprises. The contracted farmers will be paid predetermined fair prices for \nthe  output.  Following  this  partnership  approach,  the  value  added  by  the  Project  will  be \nreasonably  shared  by  farmers  and  the  enterprises.  Integration  of  farmers\u2019  inputs  with  the \nsupport services and other investment of enterprises is important to increase benefits to farmers. \nConsidering this feature of the Project, each participating agroenterprise's financial internal rate \nof return (FIRR) is calculated on the basis of integrating the activities of constructing processing \nplants and associated production base, as well as provision of support services. The FIRRs of \neach partnership are shown in Table A5 in Appendix 5. \n \n11. \nThe FIRRs, computed on an after-tax basis, range from 15% to 22% for the partnerships \nin Henan province, 17% to 25% for the partnerships in Shandong province, and 14% to 25.5% \nfor the partnerships in Gansu province. The FIRR results compare favorably with the respective \nweighted  average  costs  of  capital,  estimated  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the \nFinancial  Analysis  and  Management  of  Projects  (2005),  using  the  relative  proportion  and \nrelative  cost  of  each  source  in  total  agroenterprise  financing.  For  agroenterprises,  12%  equity \nfinancing is assumed, with a resulting weighted average cost of capital of 6.72%. The analysis \nsuggests that the investments are financially viable.  \n \n12. \nThe sensitivity analysis shows that the FIRRs are relatively robust to adverse changes in \nproject costs and delays in project implementation. However, the FIRRs show a relatively high \nsensitivity to changes in yield and output prices. Special attention will have to be given to factors \nthat may affect yields, and quality of crops and livestock in the project area such as the quality \nof infrastructure works, maintenance of facilities, and utilization of appropriate crop and livestock \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nproduction techniques, which will be channeled through technical support and farmer training in \nthe project area.  \n \nD. \n \nAnalysis of the project returns based on economic costs and benefits was carried out to \n13. \nevaluate  the  economic  viability  of  the  overall  Project.  This  is  based  on  the  analysis  of  each \npartnership.  Economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  are  presented  in  Table  A12  for  the \nenterprise  partnership  aggregated  for  each  province.  Based  on  this,  the  overall  economic \nviability of the Project is estimated by adding the project management costs incurred by county, \nprovincial,  and  national  PMOs.  Sensitivity  analysis  assesses  the  vulnerability  of  the  EIRRs  to \nunanticipated increases in costs and decreases in benefits. \n \nThe  estimated  EIRR  for  the  partnerships  in  Gansu  province  is  estimated  at  33.7%, \n14. \nfollowed by 34.9% in Henan province, and 80.8% in Shandong province. The combined EIRR \nfor the three provinces is estimated at 37.1%. With the addition of project management costs, \nthe  EIRR  for  the  Project  is  estimated  at  36.4%.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe  Government\u2019s  agriculture  and  rural  policy  objectives  include  improving  farm  and  off-farm  income  opportunities  through \nsupport to agribusiness, farmers, and environmental issues. The policy recognizes that increasing farm incomes and reducing \nland  degradation  requires  sector  restructuring,  access  to  technology,  and  coordination.  The  Government\u2019s  11th  Five-Year \nPlan  prioritizes  agriculture  and  sustainable  rural  development  through  the  New  Socialist  Countryside  Policy.  The  country \npartnership strategy (2008\u20132010) outlines the Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy to support the Government\u2019s ongoing \npoverty  reduction  efforts.  Nationally,  poor  people  mostly  live  in  the  central  and  western  provinces  that  lag  the  eastern \nprovinces in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. In these regions, poverty is mostly rural and strongly correlated to \naccess to land and incidence of land degradation. The Government sees agribusiness as a means of reducing rural poverty. \nThe  Project  comprises  an  investment  package  that  will  strengthen  sustainable  enterprises  and  farmers  by  improving \nprocessing  and  value-adding  capacity,  product  and  management  system  standards  accreditation,  access  to  higher-value \nmarkets,  and  access  to  finance  and  strengthened  support  services.  By  strengthening  the  vertical  linkages  between \nagroenterprises  and  farmers,  low-income  and  poor-farm  households  will  access  higher-value  markets  and  off-farm  income, \nreduce  marketing  costs,  and  reduce  vulnerability  through  contract  farming  arrangements.  Contracts  and  alliances  between \nfarmers  and  agroenterprises  include  provision  of  farmer  training  in  sustainable  technologies  to  produce  and  deliver  high-\nquality, high-value produce. \nB. \n1.  Key Issues  \nPoverty in the project area remains significant by world benchmarks. Based on the provincial poverty classification of CNY825 \n($115)  per  person  per  year,  about  27%  of  project  area  residents  are  poor;  6%  are  in  living  severe  poverty  and  receive \nminimum  living  guarantee  payments  from  government,  compared  to  2.5%  nationally.  A  social  and  poverty  assessment  was \ncarried out for the project area in compliance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations \n(1993).  Poverty  analysis  was  undertaken  using  a  field  survey  of  180  rural  households  and  within  12  representative  rural \ncommunities covering the three project provinces. Institutional consultation was undertaken regarding ongoing programs and \nexperiences  with  rural  development  and  poverty  reduction.  The  assessment  confirmed  disparate  growth  rates  between \nsectors resulting in large income inequities between rural and urban households and between groups of  rural  dwellers.  The \nassessment concludes that rural poverty is worst in areas with hilly land, marginal soils, and difficult access to markets and \nsupport services. Poverty is linked closely to limited land per capita, declining productivity, low education, increased migration \nfor work, households headed by women, increased dependence on straw and crop residues for heating, and limited off-farm \nwork. Average rural incomes are 30% of urban incomes, creating incentives for urbanization for those who are able to move. \nMost  poor  farmers  have  no  other  choice  of  income.  The  underlying  causes  for  rural  poverty  include  (i)  high  population  and \nsmall landholdings; (ii) disasters, degraded land, and unsustainable farming practices; (iii) reliance on farm income and limited \noff-farm  job  opportunities;  (iv)  increasing  costs  for  inputs  to  maintain  yields  (fertilizer,  machinery,  and  irrigation);  (v)  lack  of \naccess  to  improved  technology,  working  capital,  and  higher-value  products  and  markets;  and  (vi)  limited  agriculture  sector \nintegration.  The  analysis  concludes  that  poverty  is  linked  strongly  to  insufficient  land  per  capita  and  other  assets  including \nworking capital and technology, which prevent poor rural households from building capacity to exit poverty. These underlying \ncauses of rural poverty support the need for a strategy that includes facilitating rural labor to move into off-farm employment. \n \n2. Design Features \nA  key  design  feature  builds  on  the  findings  of  a  recent  ADB  evaluation  of  poverty  exit  achievements,  which  highlights  the \nsuccess of linking the rural poor to commercial value-adding enterprises and associated off-farm  employment  opportunities. \nThe  Project  applies  this  by  supporting  enterprises  located  in  the  project  areas  and  applying  poverty-targeting  criteria  for \nsupport. \nC. \n\nPoverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \u2014 Not applicable \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nFindings of Social Analysis \n\nA. \nThe project area has about 2.8 million farm households. Of these, 1.3 million (48%) farm households are in Henan province, \nfollowed by 721,000 (26%) in Gansu province, and 719,000 (26%) in Shandong province. The average household farm area is \nabout 0.28 hectares (ha), ranging from 0.25 ha in Henan, to 0.28 ha in Shandong, and to 0.39 ha in Gansu. Of these, only \nabout  600,000  farm  households  will  participate  in  the  Project.  Agriculture  in  the  project  area  is  almost  entirely  based  on \nsmallholder  farming.  Most  farmers  growing  cereal  and  horticulture  crops  still  use  traditional  farming  practices.  They  have \nlimited  access  to  markets  or  the  technology  required  to  introduce  more  economically  and  environmentally  sustainable \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n57 \n\npractices  and  diversify  into  higher-value  crops.  As  a  result,  farm  productivity  and  incomes  are  low.  The  persistence  of \ntraditional  farming  practices  presents  a  major  threat  to  the  project  area's  natural  resource  base  through  water  use,  soil \nerosion,  and  overuse  of  fertilizer  and  agrochemicals.  Environmental  concerns  are  exacerbated  by  the  dependence  of  rural \ncommunities on wood and coal for household fuel and negatively impacts on household living conditions and health.  \n \nFarmers  (especially  women)  and  small  businesses  are  disadvantaged  in  terms  of  access  to  formal  credit.  Most  farm \nexpenditures  are  financed  by  farmers'  savings,  and  most  loans  are  obtained  from  informal  sources  (e.g.,  relatives,  friends, \nmoneylenders,  and  pawnbrokers).  The  small  size  and  short  term  of  most  agricultural  finance  preclude  investment  in  assets \nthat  have  a  long  payback  period.  The  failure  of  the  financial  sector  to  function  effectively  in  support  of  agricultural  and \nagribusiness  development  means  that  market  opportunities\u2014and  the  associated  introduction  of  more  economically  and \nenvironmentally sustainable agricultural production\u2014 are not being realized. \n\nConsultation and Participation \n\nB. \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nThe  project  design  process  used  local  experts  to  carry  out  multistakeholder,  multisector  analysis.  Project  consultation  with \nstakeholders,  beneficiaries,  and  directly  affected  people  was  undertaken  during  project  design.  A  participatory  and \nconsultative  methodology  was  adopted  to  undertake  the  social  analysis  and  rural  livelihood  survey  during  the  project \npreparatory technical assistance. It involved (i) a formal questionnaire survey of 180 households, (ii) discussions with project \nstakeholders, (iii) key informant interviews in rural communities, (iv) a series of stakeholder workshops with the provinces and \nthe  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  (v)  interviews  with  key  government  staff  and  nongovernment  organizations,  (vi) interviews  with \nethnic minorities, and (vii) interviews with women. Detailed discussions  were  maintained  using  both  sector  and  cross-sector \nworking groups that included the provincial project management offices (PMOs) and their expert groups, project implementing \nagencies  and  associated  state-owned  enterprises,  design  institutes,  academics,  and  safeguard  agencies  including \nenvironment  and  poverty  reduction  officials  under  the  leadership  of  the  PMOs.  The  work  of  the  working  groups  was \ncollectively discussed and reviewed through a series of stakeholder workshops. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during project implementation and  monitoring? \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n Yes    \n\n No    (If a C&P plan was not prepared, explain why). \n\nDuring  project  implementation,  the  participation  of  stakeholders  including  beneficiaries  will  continue  to  be  built  through \nparticipatory planning and implementation processes. Equitable participation of women and the poor in decision-making and \nplanning of agribusiness activities will be important to ensure successful project outcomes. For example, agroenterprises will \nstrengthen  farmer  groups  and  negotiate  contractual  arrangements  with  organizations,  farmer  agents,  and  individuals.  The \nPMOs  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  enterprises  target  poor  rural  areas  and  prioritize  employment  of  local  people  and \nwomen. The use of demonstrations linked to farmer associations, contract farming systems, and outreach programs will adopt \na highly participatory approach to rural livelihood improvement. \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nNo specific C&P plan was prepared but consultation and participation activities have been and will be the cornerstone for the \nproject  design,  preparation,  and  implementation.  Social  development  specialists  in  the  provincial  PMOs  have  been  and  will \ncontinue to be involved in the process to ensure that thorough consultation and participation of stakeholders take place with \nawareness-raising activities for multiple stakeholders including local governments, agroenterprises, and farmer beneficiaries. \nC. \n1.  Key Issues \nGender  roles  are  determined  by  a  combination  of  cultural  factors,  occupations,  environmental  conditions,  education,  and \nemployment opportunities. In the project area, income inequalities create incentives for rural males to migrate periodically to \nurban  labor  markets  resulting  in  a  degree  of  feminization  of  agriculture.  Female  participation  in  training,  employment,  and \ncontract  farming  opportunities  will  be  implemented,  and  agroenterprises  will  favor  women  for  incremental  employment  in \nproject-supported expansion of agroprocessing capacity. In addition, the Project is promoting on-farm opportunities preferred \nby women, with lighter manual labor and/or based at the household such as rabbit farming, walnut growing and preprocessing, \nand farm mechanization tailored to women\u2019s needs. \n \n2.

Gender-sensitive  indicators  are  included  in  the \nproject  performance  management  system  especially  for  key  areas  such  as  employment  and  income  generation,  access  to \nagricultural  inputs,  technology,  information  and  marketing,  and  women\u2019s  representation  in  decision-making  processes  and \nstructures. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\n58 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nIssue \n\n \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\n \nNo impact \n\n \nIndigenous Peoples \n \n\n \nLimited impact \n\nAny new facilities will be built on land owned \nthe  agroenterprises  or  state,  and \nby \ntherefore  will  not  trigger  any  involuntary \nresettlement. \n\nto \n\nimprove \n\nOnly  Gansu  province  has  a  Hui  ethnic \nminority.

As a result of this feminization \nof  farming,  women  gain  status  and  opportunity  by  making  more  management  decisions  and \nhandling  household  finances,  but  they  may  also  have  a  greater  burden  of  heavy  work.  They \nmay  have  less  access  to  new  farming  technologies  and  training,  and  less  representation  and \ndecision-making in public affairs as they tend to have less education.  \n \n2. \nThe  survey  found  that  women  want  to  reduce  the  burden  of  cultivation  and \nmechanization by adopting conservation agriculture and installing biogas digesters. The Project \nsupports  biogas  and  mechanization  through  service  providers  and  also  the  Henan  Haofeng \nagromachinery  company,  which  manufactures  a  range  of  lighter  equipment  tailored  to  the \nstrength and weight of women. The survey found that more than 40% of employees working in \nagroprocessing  are  female,  and  agroprocessors  stated  they  prefer  women  since  they  tend  to \nmaintain  product  quality  standards  better \nthan  men.  Project-supported  agroprocessing \nenterprises  will  increase  employment  for  women.  Training  in  new  crops,  technologies,  and \npractices  given  by  agroenterprises  to  contracted  farmers  will  target  women,  especially  in \nprocessing  crops  where  the  firm  needs  to  ensure  standardized  high-quality  production.
