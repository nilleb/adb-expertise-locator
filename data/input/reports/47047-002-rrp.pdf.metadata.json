The  project  will  serve  as  a  demonstration  of  an \nintegrated approach for environmental restoration of overexploited groundwater aquifers through \nimproving allocation of water resources, improving retention of storm water, and rehabilitating the \nwater environment. The project will protect groundwater quantity and quality in Weifang and Zibo \nprefectures  and  safeguard  a  sustainable  groundwater  source  for  the  agriculture  sector,  and \ncontribute to improving food security in the PRC.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nFalling  groundwater  tables  as  a  result  of  over  extraction  of  groundwater  is  a  major \nconcern in the PRC, particularly in the northern parts of the country. The PRC heavily depends \non  extraction  of  groundwater,  with  an  estimated  20%  of  its  annual  water  supply  coming  from \ngroundwater, reportedly ranging from 110 billion cubic meters (m3) to 150 billion m3 per year. The \nlargest  groundwater  user  is  the  agricultural  sector  (60%),  with  domestic  and  industrial  usage \nsharing  the  remaining  40%.  There  are  more  than  100  large  cones  of  groundwater  depression \nwith an estimated total area of 150,000 square kilometers in the PRC. In the NCP, the total area \nof the cone of groundwater depression already extends to 70,000 square kilometers. \n \n4. \nWeifang and Zibo prefectures in Shandong Province also depend heavily on groundwater, \nespecially for its intensive and high-value agricultural production. Domestic and industrial water \nuse,  although  still  less  than  agricultural  water  use,  is  also  on  the  rise  as  a  result  of  the  rapid \neconomic  development  in  the  area.  The  project  area,  covering  Changle  and  Huantai  counties, \nand Gaomi, Qingzhou, and Shouguang cities, is the main vegetable producer for Beijing and has \na high concentration of greenhouses. The greenhouses that use drip irrigation require fresh and \nsediment-free water, which, in most cases, is provided from shallow groundwater sources. As a \nresult  of  extensive  groundwater  abstraction,  the  project  area  has  become  the  largest \noverexploited  aquifer  in  Shandong  Province,  and  the  second  largest  in  the  PRC. 3 In  some \ndownstream areas, agricultural production stopped due to lack of suitable water sources. Some \nof the industrial or domestic water users that are still using groundwater are encouraged by the \ngovernment to switch to surface water.4 \n \nCurrent  groundwater  recharge  of  both  shallow  and  deep  groundwater  resources  is \n5. \ninsufficient  to  recover  from  the  excessive  pumping  during  the  dry  periods.  Seasonal  rainfall \nfluctuates  widely,  with  an  average  of  70%  of  the  rainfall  occurring  from  June  to  September, \nfollowed by drought during the rest of the year. Flooding occurs during the summer months, but \nstorm waters flow to the sea unutilized. The pattern of irregular rainfall is expected to worsen as \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Shandong \n\nGroundwater Allocation and Protection Project (TA 8423-PRC).  \n\n3  The overexploited area of the Weifang\u2013Zibo aquifer covers approximately 5,422 square kilometers. \n4  Usage of shallow (unconfined) groundwater causes overexploitation of groundwater sources that are used by many \n\nfarmers. The use of deep (confined) groundwater causes land subsidence. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\na  result  of  climate  change,  and rainfall  is  predicted  to  decrease.  Excessive  groundwater  usage \nalso occurs because of lack of pricing of the resource, a weak licensing and permitting system, \nand insufficient abstraction metering and groundwater level monitoring. \n \nThe  consequences  of  the  current  unsustainable  groundwater  utilization  are  serious:  (i) \n6. \npumping costs have increased; (ii) groundwater quality is deteriorating due to seawater intrusion \nand environmental pollution; (iii) domestic water supplies and agricultural (particularly vegetable) \nproduction  are  at  risk;  and  (iv)  the  project  area  is  suffering  from  significant  financial  and \neconomic damages caused by land subsidence. Seawater intrusion and upconing has extended \n35  kilometers  inland  from  the  coast,  and  some  areas  have  already  experienced  subsidence  of \nmore than 2 meters.5 The process of land subsidence is irreversible, and urgent action is needed \nto avoid worsening. \n \n7. \nAcknowledging the serious concerns, the PRC Government selected Shandong Province \nas  a  demonstration  province  for  modernized  water  administration.  The  Shandong  Provincial \nGovernment  (SPG)  has  already  taken  multiple  initiatives  to  address  water  scarcity  in  the  NCP, \nincluding  promoting  water  productivity  and  reuse,  and  introducing  regulations  on  groundwater \npumping.  Several  water-saving  technologies,  such  as  drip  irrigation,  are already  widely  used  in \nthe project area.6 The results have been successful, but more efforts are needed to fully address \nthe  risk  of  further  decline  of  groundwater  levels  in  the  NCP. 7 The  national  government  has \nconstructed the South\u2013North Water Transfer Project, which started providing additional water for \nShandong  Province  in  2014.  The  diverted  water,  which  is  mainly  intended  for  domestic  and \nindustrial  use,  will  not  be  sufficient  to  mitigate  the  current  overexploitations  of  the  groundwater \nresources in the NCP.  \n \n8. \nLessons  learned  from  past  and  ongoing  support  for  the  water  sector,  including  the \npreparation  of  policy  recommendations  for  the  PRC\u2019s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan,  2016\u20132020, \nshow  that  there  is  still  lack  of  good  examples  of  implementing  integrated  water  management \napproaches and increasing water productivity in the PRC. Most counties in the project area lack \n(i)  integration  of  good  international  practices  to  provide  new  alternatives  for  groundwater \nconservation, (ii) adequate implementation of water-saving strategies and regulatory stipulations, \nand  (iii)  introduction  of  up-to-date  water  environmental  monitoring  technologies.  Existing \ngovernment programs also lack the support to link efficient and reduced groundwater usage with \nthe retention of surface and storm water to increase groundwater recharge and water availability \nfor water-scarce areas. \n \nThe project will be the first Asian Development Bank (ADB) supported major investment \n9. \nin the PRC that specifically focus on groundwater resources protection, recognizing the strategic \nimportance  of  these  resources.  Moreover,  the  project  will  support  the  development  and \nintroduction of economic policy instruments, critical to controlling groundwater usage. The project \nwill  contribute  to  the  PRC\u2019s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan,  2016\u20132020,  which  pursues  regionally \nbalanced  and  environmentally  sustainable  growth;  and  the  PRC\u2019s  first  National  Plan  to  Protect \nthe  Safety  of  Groundwater  Resources,  2011\u20132020. 8  The  project  will  support  the  PRC  in \n\n                                                 \n5  Process by which saline water underlying freshwater in an aquifer rises upward into the freshwater zone as a result \n\nof pumping water from the freshwater zone. \n\n6  In Shouguang City, which is among the worst affected in the project area, two-thirds of the farmers reportedly apply \n\n7  The amount of groundwater usage in Shandong Province declined from 13.4 billion m3 in 2001 to 8.9 billion m3 in \n\ndrip irrigation already. \n\n2012. \n\n8  On  10  October  2011,  the  PRC  Government  approved  the  National  Plan  to  Protect  the  Safety  of  Groundwater \nResources, 2011\u20132020. The adoption of the plan is an important step to mobilize additional financial resources to \n\n \n\n\fImpact and Outcome \n\nachieving  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals,  in  particular  Goal  2:  End  hunger,  achieve  food \nsecurity  and  improved  nutrition  and  promote  sustainable  agriculture  and  Goal  6:  Ensure \navailability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. The project is in line with \nthe country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC of ADB in supporting the government\u2019s \noverarching  strategic  goal  by  focusing  on  environmentally  sustainable  growth.9 The  project  will \ncontribute to ADB's Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 to (i) increase water productivity across \nthe range of users; (ii) embed integrated water resources management, including improved risk \nmanagement,  to  mitigate  floods,  droughts,  and  other  water-related  disasters;  and  (iii)  expand \nknowledge and capacity development that uses technology and innovation more directly.10  \n \nB. \n \nThe  impact  will  be  a  sustained  groundwater  supply  for  the  agriculture  sector  in  the \n10. \nWeifang\u2013Zibo  area.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  conservation  and  sustainable  use  of \ngroundwater  resources  in  Weifang  and  Zibo  prefectures.  The  project  will  serve  as  a \ndemonstration  of  different  integrated  approaches  for  environmental  restoration  and  improved \nmanagement  of  overexploited  groundwater  areas.  The  project  will  promote  the  integration  of \ninnovative  demonstration  activities  like  (i)  groundwater  recharge  through  water  harvesting  and \nstorage  in  smart  greenhouses;  (ii)  demonstration  of  comprehensive  water  management \ninformation  systems;  and  (iii)  capacity  development  in  water  resources  management,  including \nwater resource policy and regulation, water pricing, and water markets. \n \nC. \n \nThe project will have three outputs: (i) groundwater recharged and conserved, (ii) surface \n11. \nwater  allocation  improved  and  monitored,  and  (iii)  capacity  development  for  water  resources \nmanagement  enhanced.  Demonstration  activities  will  be  implemented  in  Changle  and  Huantai \ncounties,  and  Gaomi,  Qingzhou,  and  Shouguang  cities  in  Weifang  and  Zibo,  which  are \nrepresentative for critical water-scarce conditions in intensive agricultural production bases in the \nWeifang\u2013Zibo area. \n \n12. \nOutput  1:  Groundwater  recharged  and  conserved.  Output  1  will  support  the \nintroduction  of  groundwater  recharge  technologies  in  the  project  area  to  increase  shallow \ngroundwater  recharge  and  reduce  usage  of  deep  groundwater.  Output  1  will  have  two \ncomponents: (i) rehabilitation and construction of about 880 hectares of wetland areas, including \ncanals,  which  will  contribute  to  the  recharge  of  shallow  groundwater  resources; 11  and  (ii) \ntechnological innovation for monitoring shallow groundwater recharge in Huantai County. Under \ncomponent 1, two wetland areas will be rehabilitated in Huantai County and Shouguang City to \nimprove  the  reservoir  and  ecological  functions  of  the  wetlands,  and  increase  shallow \ngroundwater  recharge  through  the  canal  network.  These  wetland  areas  currently  suffer  from \nwater  shortages  and  are  not  operational.  Component  2  includes  the  development  of  a \ncomprehensive  management \nresources  monitoring  and \nmanagement  in  Huantai  County,  including  monitoring  and  dissemination  of  groundwater  levels, \n\ninformation  system \n\nfor  water \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                                                                                                                            \nprotect groundwater resources in the PRC. On 16 April 2015, the government also announced an associated action \nplan  that  includes  a  list  of  measures  to  tackle  water  pollution,  with  the  aim  of  improving  the  quality  of  the  water \nenvironment  around  the  country  by  2030.  With  regards  to  groundwater,  the  plan  envisages  that  by  2020, \ngroundwater overdraft will be reduced and the aggravated pollution of groundwater will be preliminarily controlled. \n9  ADB.  2016.

The management information system will be developed to complement \nan  existing  urban  water  supply  management  system.  The  existing  system  will  be  expanded  to \ninclude monitoring of water resources, data analysis, optimizing the allocation of water resources, \nwater regime forecasting, and decision-making support for flood control. \n \n13. \nOutput  2:  Surface  water  allocation  improved  and  monitored.  Output  2  will  improve \nwater allocation and monitoring to increase water availability in water-scarce parts of the project \narea  and  indirectly  reduce  the  pressure  on  groundwater  resources.  The  output  will  have  three \ncomponents:  (i)  improvement  of  surface  water  allocation,  (ii)  retention  of  storm  water,  and  (iii) \nestablishment  of hydrological facilities  in  Changle  County. Through the  improvement  of surface \nwater  resources  allocations, the  exploitation  of groundwater  can  be reduced.  Component  1  will \nsupport  Gaomi  and  Qingzhou  cities  and  Huantai  County  to  rehabilitate  surface  water  flow \nsystems and construct connections between the wide network of small rivers, canals, and small-\nsized  reservoirs  that  exist  in  the  Weifang\u2013Zibo  area.  The  connections  will  enable  the  local \ngovernments to supply areas with additional surface water resources to reduce the pressure on \ngroundwater resources. Similarly, component 2 will support Changle County and Gaomi City to \nincrease  their reservoir  capacity  for  improved  storage  of surface  water. It  is  envisaged that  the \ntotal storage capacity of the Nanzhai and Juchenghe reservoirs will be increased from 3.7 million \nm3  per  year  to  8.3  million  m3  per  year.  Output  3  will  support  Changle  County  to  establish \nprecipitation and flow monitoring capabilities in the Nanzhai Reservoir watershed.  \n \nOutput  3:  Capacity  development  for  water  resources  management  enhanced. \n14. \nOutput  3  will  have \ninstitutional \nstrengthening  of  ADB\u2019s  project  management  procedures,  and  (ii)  project  management. \nComponent  1  will  provide  support  for  and  training  on  groundwater  policy  and  new  approaches \nand \nincluding  wetland  management,  water-saving \ntechnologies  for  the  agriculture  sector  such  as  smart  greenhouses,  the  establishment  of  a \ngroundwater trading system through pilot water user associations, and an integrated circuit card-\ncontrolled water usage system to be developed in Huantai County for monitoring and managing \ngroundwater demand for agricultural and rural water users. Knowledge products will be prepared \nto  document  the  experiences  and  achievements.  Component  1  will  also  support  capacity \ndevelopment  and  training  of  staff  from  the  SPG  and  local  governments  in  ADB  project \nmanagement  procedures, technical  design  and  implementation,  and  safeguard  supervision  and \nmonitoring.  Component  2  will  provide  overall  project  implementation  support  for  staff  from  the \nSPG and cities and counties, including the implementation of land acquisition and resettlement. \n \nD. \n \n15. \n \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \n16. \nresources to finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 \nyears,  will  follow  the  straight-line  method, 12 will  have  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  on  undisbursed  funds  (the  interest  and  other  charges \nduring construction will be capitalized), and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan  and  project  agreements.  The  average  maturity  is  15.25  years,  and  the  maturity  premium \npayable to ADB is 0.10% per annum.

The Water Resources Research Institute is not affiliated with the Shandong Water Resources \nDepartment. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \nDue  diligence  assessed  the  project\u2019s  technical  feasibility  and  sustainability.  The  SPG\u2019s \n21. \ndomestic feasibility studies are technically sound and provide sufficient information on the design \nfeasibility.  International  and  national  consulting  services  will  provide  the  necessary  technical \nsupport  to  ensure  that  international  best  practices  are  integrated  into  the  final  detailed  design \nand applied during construction and implementation. The SPG confirmed that it will (i) continue \nthe  implementation  of  its  ongoing  water  saving  and  conservation  programs  for  the  agriculture, \nindustry,  and  urban  sectors  to  reduce  groundwater  extraction;  and  (ii)  facilitate  the  process  of \nintroducing  water  pricing  and  water  rights  trading.  The  SPG  will  also  continue  its  programs  to \nclose  industrial  well  fields  to  protect  groundwater  resources  in  the  project  area.  The  SPG  will \nensure  adequate  water  allocation  and  management  for  the  Judian  and  Mata  lake  areas  and \nmaintain adequate water levels. \n \nClimate  change.  A  climate  risk  vulnerability  assessment  was  conducted  to  identify  the \n22. \nthreat  that  climate  change  presents  to  project  viability,  assuming  a  design  life  of  30\u201340  years. \nThe  project  area  may  be  subject  to  increasing  frequency  and  duration  of  winter  drought, \nvariability  in  precipitation,  and  flood  severity  in  summer.  Flood  volumes  and  higher  flows  could \nexceed the capacity of embankments, channels, pipelines, and the two project pump stations. To \nguard against this, (i) all structures will be constructed to a flood protection standard of one in 20 \nyears or one in 50 years, and (ii) embankments will be designed to be porous for infiltration. The \nproject  is  oriented  to  strengthen  resilience  to  climate  risks  in  the  following  ways:  (i)  increased \nstorm  water  retention  and  improved  water  monitoring  and  allocation  will  strengthen  water \nsecurity, (ii) channel rehabilitation will improve water flows and reduce flood risk, and (iii) training \nin water conservation and wetland management will help secure the freshwater resources of two \nlarge wetlands in the project area. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe  economic  analysis  indicated  that  the  project  is  economically  viable,  with  an  overall \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  of  20.6%  and  an  economic  net  present  value  of  CNY788.3 \nmillion. The analysis also confirmed economic viability of all components, with economic internal \nrates  of  return  ranging  from  18.7%  to  23.8%.  Sensitivity  analysis  showed  that  the  project  is \nrobust to negative scenarios examined such as increase in investment costs, revenue reduction, \nand increase in operation and maintenance cost.  \n \n24. \nFinancial analysis was conducted with respect to (i) financial sustainability of the project, \nand  (ii)  financial  management  capacity.  Financial  sustainability  of  the  project  was  assessed \nbased  on  fiscal  impact  of  (i)  counterpart  funds  during  the  project,  and  (ii)  operation  and \nmaintenance  cost  and  the  loan  repayment  obligation.  The  analysis  confirmed  financial \nsustainability of the project, as the project will have substantially limited fiscal impact for the SPG \nand project county and city governments.14  \n \n \n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                 \n14  For  the  SPG,  and  the  project  county  and  city  governments,  such  expenditure  will  be  far  less  than  5%  of  their \n\nrespective fiscal expenditures. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nfinanced  by \n\nGovernance \n\ninternational  development \n\nC. \n \n25. \nThe financial management assessment indicated pre-mitigation risk as \u201clow.\u201d The SWRD, \ngiven  its  experience  with  donor-funded  projects  including  the  ongoing  ADB  Risk  Mitigation  and \nStrengthening  of  Endangered  Reservoirs  in  Shandong  Province  Project, 15  will  take  overall \nresponsibility for financial management of the project. The SWRD's sound financial management \ncapacity  is  sufficient  to  support the  implementing  agencies for the financial  management  of the \nproject.  Nonetheless,  training  on  project  financial  management,  particularly  ADB  disbursement \nprocedures and reporting and audit requirements, will be provided to strengthen the capacity of \nthe implementing agencies. \n \n26. \nThe  procurement  capacity  assessment  indicates  that  the  SWRD (the  executing  agency) \nand  the  five  city  and  county  governments  (the  implementing  agencies)  (i)  have  established \narrangements  for  handling  procurement,  including  bid  document  preparation,  tender  invitation, \nbid  evaluation,  contract  award,  construction  supervision,  and  contract  performance  monitoring; \nand  (ii)  will  engage  a  professional  procurement  agency  experienced  in  managing  procurement \ninstitutions.  The  Shandong  Finance \nprocesses \nDepartment  and  SWRD  have  experience  with  implementing  ADB-financed  projects.  Given  the \nlack of experience by the five city and county governments in managing ADB-financed projects \nand their lack of familiarity with ADB policies, guidelines, and procedural requirements, training in \nproject management will be provided under the loan. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the SPG, SWRD, and the five city and county governments. It has also been explained that, \nin  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  2011,  the  audit  reports  for  the  project  will  be \nuploaded on ADB\u2019s website. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the project administration manual (footnote 13). \n \nD. \n \n28. \nGender  and  social  development.  About  4.0  million  people  will  benefit  directly  and \nindirectly from the improved  water management in the project area. The project is classified as \nhaving  some  gender  elements,  and  includes  gender  design  elements  to  guide  the  project  in \ncontributing to gender equality. A social and gender action plan has been prepared to (i) promote \nthe accrual of project benefits by women; (ii) promote the participation of beneficiaries in project \nimplementation, in particular through participation in community awareness-raising activities and \nin training, and through preferential treatment in employment; and (iii) foster public participation, \nsuch as through awareness-raising programs and activities in schools, to make all beneficiaries \naware of potential contributions to water conservancy. Public consultations on agricultural water \nuse will promote broad acceptance on reformed agricultural water management. Implementation \nof  the  social  and  gender  action  plan  will  be  monitored  throughout  project  implementation, \nincluding  the  collection  of  sex-disaggregated  data  on  project  activities.  Poor  and  vulnerable \nhouseholds will be made better off through inclusion in cash-transfer programs under the social \nand gender action plan. \n \n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                 \n15  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance  Grant  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Risk  Mitigation  and  Strengthening  of  Endangered \nReservoirs in Shandong Province Project. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nE. \n \n29. \nEnvironment  (category  A).  The  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  report,  which \nincludes an environmental management plan (EMP), follows ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009).16 The  EIA  is  consistent  with  the  five  domestic  EIAs  approved  during  June  2014\u2013March \n2015 by the Shandong Environmental Protection Department. Public consultations involved key \nstakeholders,  including  affected  people  and  local  government  agencies,  and  the  outcomes  are \nintegrated  in  the  project  design.  The  draft  EIA  was  publicly  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  9 \nMarch 2015. The SPG, through the PMO, will be responsible for implementation and compliance \nwith  the  EMP,  including  inspection,  monitoring,  reporting,  and  initiating  corrective  actions  or \nmeasures. The PMO will implement a grievance redress mechanism and have final responsibility \nfor handling any disputes. The PMO is experienced in ADB project implementation, although this \nis  the  first  ADB-funded  project  for  the  five  project  cities  and  counties.  To  support  EMP \nimplementation, loan implementation consultants and a capacity development program are part \nof the project design. \n \nThe  project  is  expected  to  achieve  environmental  benefits,  including  stabilizing  of \n30. \ngroundwater  levels,  recharge  of  the  Weifang\u2013Zibo  aquifer,  reduced  land  subsidence,  improved \nchannel  flows  and  flood  capacity,  wetland  management,  improved  water  security  for  over  4 \nmillion  people,  and  improved  water  quality.  Anticipated  construction  impacts  are  from  the \nplanned dredging and embankment (temporary damage of in-channel habitats, elevated turbidity, \nlocalized impacts to aquatic fauna, and odor from dredged sediment); air, dust, noise, vibration, \nand  erosion  impacts;  and  occupational  and  community  health  and  safety.  Potential  operational \nrisks  include  inadequate  maintenance  of  project  structures,  including  embankments  and  noise \nemissions from two pump stations. The risk of indirect, cumulative, and/or induced impacts has \nbeen  assessed.  Mitigation  measures  are  described  in  the  EMP.  These  include  the  use  of \nspecialized  dredging  machinery,  timing  of  dredging,  design  of  embankment  habitats,  and  post-\nconstruction  monitoring  of  aquatic  invertebrates.  The  EIA  concludes  that  effective  EMP \nimplementation,  together  with  the  prescribed  training,  will  result  in  residual  impacts  within  the \nlimits of the PRC standards defined in the EMP. \n \n31. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C)  and  involuntary  resettlement  (category  A).  The \nproject does not involve any distinct ethnic minority community and thus does not trigger ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) indigenous peoples requirements. With regard to involuntary \nresettlement, the project will have the following impacts: (i) 1,408 mu of collective village land will \nbe permanently acquired and 1,029 people from 255 households on contracted village lands will \nbe affected; (ii) 310 households with 1,167 people will be displaced physically and resettled to a \nresettlement  site;  and (iii)  temporary  land  acquisition, mostly for  land  disposal  and  construction \nfacilities,  will  occupy  9,422  mu  of  collective  village  land  for  1  or  2  years,  affecting  7,297 \nhouseholds.17 About 430 households with 1,720 people will be significantly impacted, all of which \nare  in  the  Changle  Nanzhai  Reservoir  component  under  the  project.  Five  resettlement  plans \nhave  been  prepared  to  mitigate  the  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  and  to  ensure  displaced \npeople are successfully resettled and rehabilitated; the plans have been prepared after extensive \nconsultation  with  affected  villages  and  farmers.  The  resettlement  plans  contain  the  required \nelements, such as compensation standards, an entitlement matrix, a livelihood restoration plan, a \nbudget,  an  implementation  schedule,  external  and  internal monitoring,  and  a grievance redress \nmechanism.  The  total  costs  for  resettlement  are  estimated  at  CNY291.51  million  and  are  fully \nincluded in the project budget. The implementing agencies for resettlement have experience with \n\n                                                 \n16  Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17  A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nlocal  regulations  and  procedures,  and  have  been  familiarized  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009)  requirements.  A  resettlement  implementation  consultant  and  an  external \nmonitor will also be engaged. \n \nF. \n \n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.18 The  overall  risk  rating  is  medium.  Adequate \nmitigation measures are in place, which are expected to ensure that the integrated benefits and \nimpacts outweigh the risks and associated costs.  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nDelays \nsynchronization between agencies. \n\nin  project  coordination  and \n\nunfamiliar  with  ADB \n\nGovernments of project counties and cities \nare \npolicies, \nprocedures,  and  requirements  for  project \nimplementation \nDelays  in  resolving  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  issues  (in  particular  for  the \nNanzhai Reservoir in Changle County) \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: ADB. \n \n\nMitigating Measures \nEnsure  that  the  Shandong Water  Resources  Department assumes  the \noversight  role  to  guarantee  adequate  coordination  among  the  (i)  two \nmunicipal  governments  and  five  city  and  county  governments;  and  (ii) \nother  key  departments  in  water  resources  management,  notably  the \nEnvironment Protection Department and Agricultural Department. \nProvide  training  during  project  implementation  to  city  and  county \ngovernments\u2019  staff  on  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and  policies  and  ensure  early \nengagement  of  the  procurement  agency  and  project  implementation \nconsultant. \nClose monitoring and reporting of resettlement implementation through \na  professional  supervision  agency,  support  from  an  implementation \nconsultant,  and  use  of  an  external  monitor.
