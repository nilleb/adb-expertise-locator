THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Shandong Groundwater Protection Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed loan for the Shandong Groundwater Protection Project will contribute to \nproviding  sustained  groundwater  supply  for  the  agriculture  sector  in  Weifang  and  Zibo \nprefectures in the North China Plain (NCP). The project will serve as a demonstration of an \nintegrated approach for environmental restoration of overexploited groundwater aquifers through \nimproving allocation of water resources, improving retention of storm water, and rehabilitating the \nwater environment. The project will protect groundwater quantity and quality in Weifang and Zibo \nprefectures and safeguard a sustainable groundwater source for the agriculture sector, and \ncontribute to improving food security in the PRC.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Falling  groundwater tables  as  a result  of  over  extraction  of groundwater  is  a major \nconcern in the PRC, particularly in the northern parts of the country. The PRC heavily depends \non extraction of groundwater, with an estimated 20% of its annual water supply coming from \ngroundwater, reportedly ranging from 110 billion cubic meters (m3) to 150 billion m3 per year. The \nlargest groundwater user is the agricultural sector (60%), with domestic and industrial usage \nsharing the remaining 40%. There are more than 100 large cones of groundwater depression \nwith an estimated total area of 150,000 square kilometers in the PRC. In the NCP, the total area \nof the cone of groundwater depression already extends to 70,000 square kilometers. \n \n4.  Weifang and Zibo prefectures in Shandong Province also depend heavily on groundwater, \nespecially for its intensive and high-value agricultural production. Domestic and industrial water \nuse, although still less than agricultural water use, is also on the rise as a result of the rapid \neconomic development in the area. The project area, covering Changle and Huantai counties, \nand Gaomi, Qingzhou, and Shouguang cities, is the main vegetable producer for Beijing and has \na high concentration of greenhouses. The greenhouses that use drip irrigation require fresh and \nsediment-free water, which, in most cases, is provided from shallow groundwater sources. As a \nresult  of  extensive  groundwater  abstraction,  the  project  area  has  become  the  largest \noverexploited aquifer in Shandong Province, and the second largest in the PRC.3 In some \ndownstream areas, agricultural production stopped due to lack of suitable water sources. Some \nof the industrial or domestic water users that are still using groundwater are encouraged by the \ngovernment to switch to surface water.4 \n \n5.  Current  groundwater  recharge  of  both  shallow  and  deep  groundwater  resources  is \ninsufficient to recover from the excessive pumping during the dry periods. Seasonal rainfall \nfluctuates widely, with an average of 70% of the rainfall occurring from June to September, \nfollowed by drought during the rest of the year. Flooding occurs during the summer months, but \nstorm waters flow to the sea unutilized. The pattern of irregular rainfall is expected to worsen as \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Shandong \nGroundwater Allocation and Protection Project (TA 8423-PRC).  \n3  The overexploited area of the Weifang\u2013Zibo aquifer covers approximately 5,422 square kilometers. \n4  Usage of shallow (unconfined) groundwater causes overexploitation of groundwater sources that are used by many \nfarmers. The use of deep (confined) groundwater causes land subsidence. \n ", "2 \na result of climate change, and rainfall is predicted to decrease. Excessive groundwater usage \nalso occurs because of lack of pricing of the resource, a weak licensing and permitting system, \nand insufficient abstraction metering and groundwater level monitoring. \n \n6.  The consequences of the current unsustainable groundwater utilization are serious: (i) \npumping costs have increased; (ii) groundwater quality is deteriorating due to seawater intrusion \nand environmental pollution; (iii) domestic water supplies and agricultural (particularly vegetable) \nproduction  are  at  risk;  and  (iv)  the  project  area  is  suffering  from  significant  financial  and \neconomic damages caused by land subsidence. Seawater intrusion and upconing has extended \n35 kilometers inland from the coast, and some areas have already experienced subsidence of \nmore than 2 meters.5 The process of land subsidence is irreversible, and urgent action is needed \nto avoid worsening. \n \n7.  Acknowledging the serious concerns, the PRC Government selected Shandong Province \nas a demonstration province for modernized water administration. The Shandong Provincial \nGovernment (SPG) has already taken multiple initiatives to address water scarcity in the NCP, \nincluding promoting water productivity and reuse, and introducing regulations on groundwater \npumping. Several water-saving technologies, such as drip irrigation, are already widely used in \nthe project area.6 The results have been successful, but more efforts are needed to fully address \nthe risk of further decline of groundwater levels in the NCP.7 The national government has \nconstructed the South\u2013North Water Transfer Project, which started providing additional water for \nShandong Province in 2014. The diverted water, which is mainly intended for domestic and \nindustrial use, will not be sufficient to mitigate the current overexploitations of the groundwater \nresources in the NCP.  \n \n8.  Lessons  learned  from  past  and  ongoing  support  for  the  water  sector,  including  the \npreparation of policy recommendations for the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, \nshow that there is still lack of good examples of implementing integrated water management \napproaches and increasing water productivity in the PRC. Most counties in the project area lack \n(i)  integration  of  good  international  practices  to  provide  new  alternatives  for  groundwater \nconservation, (ii) adequate implementation of water-saving strategies and regulatory stipulations, \nand  (iii)  introduction  of  up-to-date  water  environmental  monitoring  technologies.  Existing \ngovernment programs also lack the support to link efficient and reduced groundwater usage with \nthe retention of surface and storm water to increase groundwater recharge and water availability \nfor water-scarce areas. \n \n9.  The project will be the first Asian Development Bank (ADB) supported major investment \nin the PRC that specifically focus on groundwater resources protection, recognizing the strategic \nimportance  of  these  resources.  Moreover,  the  project  will  support  the  development  and \nintroduction of economic policy instruments, critical to controlling groundwater usage. The project \nwill contribute to the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, which pursues regionally \nbalanced and environmentally sustainable growth; and the PRC\u2019s first National Plan to Protect \nthe  Safety  of  Groundwater  Resources,  2011\u20132020.8 The  project  will  support  the  PRC  in \n                                                \n5  Process by which saline water underlying freshwater in an aquifer rises upward into the freshwater zone as a result \nof pumping water from the freshwater zone. \n6  In Shouguang City, which is among the worst affected in the project area, two-thirds of the farmers reportedly apply \ndrip irrigation already. \n7  The amount of groundwater usage in Shandong Province declined from 13.4 billion m3 in 2001 to 8.9 billion m3 in \n2012. \n8  On 10 October 2011, the PRC Government approved the National Plan to Protect the Safety of Groundwater \nResources, 2011\u20132020. The adoption of the plan is an important step to mobilize additional financial resources to \n ", "3 \nachieving the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food \nsecurity  and  improved  nutrition  and  promote  sustainable  agriculture  and  Goal  6:  Ensure \navailability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. The project is in line with \nthe country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC of ADB in supporting the government\u2019s \noverarching strategic goal by focusing on environmentally sustainable growth.9 The project will \ncontribute to ADB's Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 to (i) increase water productivity across \nthe range of users; (ii) embed integrated water resources management, including improved risk \nmanagement, to mitigate floods, droughts, and other water-related disasters; and (iii) expand \nknowledge and capacity development that uses technology and innovation more directly.10  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The  impact  will  be  a  sustained groundwater  supply  for  the  agriculture  sector  in  the \nWeifang\u2013Zibo  area.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  conservation  and  sustainable  use  of \ngroundwater  resources  in  Weifang  and  Zibo  prefectures.  The  project  will  serve  as  a \ndemonstration of different integrated approaches for environmental restoration and improved \nmanagement of overexploited groundwater areas. The project will promote the integration of \ninnovative demonstration activities like (i) groundwater recharge through water harvesting and \nstorage  in  smart  greenhouses;  (ii)  demonstration  of  comprehensive  water  management \ninformation systems; and (iii) capacity development in water resources management, including \nwater resource policy and regulation, water pricing, and water markets. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  The project will have three outputs: (i) groundwater recharged and conserved, (ii) surface \nwater allocation improved and monitored, and (iii) capacity development for water resources \nmanagement enhanced. Demonstration activities will be implemented in Changle and Huantai \ncounties,  and  Gaomi,  Qingzhou,  and  Shouguang  cities  in  Weifang  and  Zibo,  which  are \nrepresentative for critical water-scarce conditions in intensive agricultural production bases in the \nWeifang\u2013Zibo area. \n \n12.  Output  1:  Groundwater  recharged  and  conserved.  Output  1  will  support  the \nintroduction  of  groundwater  recharge  technologies  in  the  project  area  to  increase  shallow \ngroundwater  recharge  and  reduce  usage  of  deep  groundwater.  Output  1  will  have  two \ncomponents: (i) rehabilitation and construction of about 880 hectares of wetland areas, including \ncanals,  which  will  contribute  to  the  recharge  of  shallow  groundwater  resources;11 and  (ii) \ntechnological innovation for monitoring shallow groundwater recharge in Huantai County. Under \ncomponent 1, two wetland areas will be rehabilitated in Huantai County and Shouguang City to \nimprove  the  reservoir  and  ecological  functions  of  the  wetlands,  and  increase  shallow \ngroundwater recharge through the canal network. These wetland areas currently suffer from \nwater  shortages  and  are  not  operational.  Component  2  includes  the  development  of  a \ncomprehensive  management  information  system  for  water  resources  monitoring  and \nmanagement in Huantai County, including monitoring and dissemination of groundwater levels, \n                                                                                                                                                         \nprotect groundwater resources in the PRC. On 16 April 2015, the government also announced an associated action \nplan that includes a list of measures to tackle water pollution, with the aim of improving the quality of the water \nenvironment  around  the  country  by  2030.  With  regards  to  groundwater,  the  plan  envisages  that  by  2020, \ngroundwater overdraft will be reduced and the aggravated pollution of groundwater will be preliminarily controlled. \n9  ADB. 2016.

The management information system will be developed to complement \nan existing urban water supply management system. The existing system will be expanded to \ninclude monitoring of water resources, data analysis, optimizing the allocation of water resources, \nwater regime forecasting, and decision-making support for flood control. \n \n13.  Output 2: Surface water allocation improved and monitored. Output 2 will improve \nwater allocation and monitoring to increase water availability in water-scarce parts of the project \narea and indirectly reduce the pressure on groundwater resources. The output will have three \ncomponents: (i) improvement of surface water allocation, (ii) retention of storm water, and (iii) \nestablishment of hydrological facilities in Changle County. Through the improvement of surface \nwater resources allocations, the exploitation of groundwater can be reduced. Component 1 will \nsupport  Gaomi  and  Qingzhou  cities  and  Huantai  County  to  rehabilitate  surface  water  flow \nsystems and construct connections between the wide network of small rivers, canals, and small-\nsized reservoirs that exist in the Weifang\u2013Zibo area. The connections will enable the local \ngovernments to supply areas with additional surface water resources to reduce the pressure on \ngroundwater resources. Similarly, component 2 will support Changle County and Gaomi City to \nincrease their reservoir capacity for improved storage of surface water. It is envisaged that the \ntotal storage capacity of the Nanzhai and Juchenghe reservoirs will be increased from 3.7 million \nm3 per year to 8.3 million m3 per year. Output 3 will support Changle County to establish \nprecipitation and flow monitoring capabilities in the Nanzhai Reservoir watershed.  \n \n14.  Output  3:  Capacity  development  for  water  resources  management  enhanced. \nOutput  3  will  have  two  components:  (i)  policy  development  support  and  institutional \nstrengthening  of  ADB\u2019s  project  management  procedures,  and  (ii)  project  management. \nComponent 1 will provide support for and training on groundwater policy and new approaches \nand  techniques  in  water  management,  including  wetland  management,  water-saving \ntechnologies  for  the  agriculture  sector  such  as  smart  greenhouses,  the  establishment  of  a \ngroundwater trading system through pilot water user associations, and an integrated circuit card-\ncontrolled water usage system to be developed in Huantai County for monitoring and managing \ngroundwater demand for agricultural and rural water users. Knowledge products will be prepared \nto  document  the  experiences  and  achievements.  Component  1  will  also  support  capacity \ndevelopment  and  training  of  staff  from  the  SPG  and  local  governments  in  ADB  project \nmanagement procedures, technical design and implementation, and safeguard supervision and \nmonitoring. Component 2 will provide overall project implementation support for staff from the \nSPG and cities and counties, including the implementation of land acquisition and resettlement. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plan \n \n15.  The project is estimated to cost $344.03 million (Table 1). \n \n16.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 \nyears, will follow the straight-line method,12 will  have an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year on undisbursed funds (the interest and other charges \nduring construction will be capitalized), and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements. The average maturity is 15.25 years, and the maturity premium \npayable to ADB is 0.10% per annum. The financing plan is in Table 2.  \n \n                                                \n12 This is based on the loan terms and the government\u2019s choice of repayment option and dates. \n ", "5 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

The SPG will also continue its programs to \nclose industrial well fields to protect groundwater resources in the project area. The SPG will \nensure adequate water allocation and management for the Judian and Mata lake areas and \nmaintain adequate water levels. \n \n22.  Climate change. A climate risk vulnerability assessment was conducted to identify the \nthreat that climate change presents to project viability, assuming a design life of 30\u201340 years. \nThe  project  area  may  be  subject  to  increasing  frequency  and  duration  of  winter  drought, \nvariability in precipitation, and flood severity in summer. Flood volumes and higher flows could \nexceed the capacity of embankments, channels, pipelines, and the two project pump stations. To \nguard against this, (i) all structures will be constructed to a flood protection standard of one in 20 \nyears or one in 50 years, and (ii) embankments will be designed to be porous for infiltration. The \nproject is oriented to strengthen resilience to climate risks in the following ways: (i) increased \nstorm  water  retention  and  improved  water  monitoring  and  allocation  will  strengthen  water \nsecurity, (ii) channel rehabilitation will improve water flows and reduce flood risk, and (iii) training \nin water conservation and wetland management will help secure the freshwater resources of two \nlarge wetlands in the project area. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  The economic analysis indicated that the project is economically viable, with an overall \neconomic internal rate of return of 20.6% and an economic net present value of CNY788.3 \nmillion. The analysis also confirmed economic viability of all components, with economic internal \nrates of return ranging from 18.7% to 23.8%. Sensitivity analysis showed that the project is \nrobust to negative scenarios examined such as increase in investment costs, revenue reduction, \nand increase in operation and maintenance cost.  \n \n24.  Financial analysis was conducted with respect to (i) financial sustainability of the project, \nand (ii) financial management capacity. Financial sustainability of the project was assessed \nbased  on  fiscal  impact  of  (i)  counterpart  funds  during  the  project,  and  (ii)  operation  and \nmaintenance  cost  and  the  loan  repayment  obligation.  The  analysis  confirmed  financial \nsustainability of the project, as the project will have substantially limited fiscal impact for the SPG \nand project county and city governments.14  \n \n \n \n                                                \n14  For the SPG, and the project county and city governments, such expenditure will be far less than 5% of their \nrespective fiscal expenditures. \n ", "8 \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  The financial management assessment indicated pre-mitigation risk as \u201clow.\u201d The SWRD, \ngiven its experience with donor-funded projects including the ongoing ADB Risk Mitigation and \nStrengthening  of  Endangered  Reservoirs  in  Shandong  Province  Project,15 will  take  overall \nresponsibility for financial management of the project. The SWRD's sound financial management \ncapacity is sufficient to support the implementing agencies for the financial management of the \nproject. Nonetheless, training on project financial management, particularly ADB disbursement \nprocedures and reporting and audit requirements, will be provided to strengthen the capacity of \nthe implementing agencies. \n \n26.  The procurement capacity assessment indicates that the SWRD (the executing agency) \nand the five city and county governments (the implementing agencies) (i) have established \narrangements for handling procurement, including bid document preparation, tender invitation, \nbid evaluation, contract award, construction supervision, and contract performance monitoring; \nand (ii) will engage a professional procurement agency experienced in managing procurement \nprocesses  financed  by  international  development  institutions.  The  Shandong  Finance \nDepartment and SWRD have experience with implementing ADB-financed projects. Given the \nlack of experience by the five city and county governments in managing ADB-financed projects \nand their lack of familiarity with ADB policies, guidelines, and procedural requirements, training in \nproject management will be provided under the loan. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the SPG, SWRD, and the five city and county governments. It has also been explained that, \nin line with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy 2011, the audit reports for the project will be \nuploaded on ADB\u2019s website. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the project administration manual (footnote 13). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.  Gender  and  social  development. About 4.0 million people will benefit directly and \nindirectly from the improved water management in the project area. The project is classified as \nhaving some gender elements, and includes gender design elements to guide the project in \ncontributing to gender equality. A social and gender action plan has been prepared to (i) promote \nthe accrual of project benefits by women; (ii) promote the participation of beneficiaries in project \nimplementation, in particular through participation in community awareness-raising activities and \nin training, and through preferential treatment in employment; and (iii) foster public participation, \nsuch as through awareness-raising programs and activities in schools, to make all beneficiaries \naware of potential contributions to water conservancy. Public consultations on agricultural water \nuse will promote broad acceptance on reformed agricultural water management. Implementation \nof  the  social  and  gender  action  plan  will  be  monitored  throughout  project  implementation, \nincluding the collection of sex-disaggregated data on project activities. Poor and vulnerable \nhouseholds will be made better off through inclusion in cash-transfer programs under the social \nand gender action plan. \n \n \n                                                \n15  ADB. 2010.

The environmental impact assessment (EIA) report, which \nincludes an environmental management plan (EMP), follows ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009).16 The EIA is consistent with the five domestic EIAs approved during June 2014\u2013March \n2015 by the Shandong Environmental Protection Department. Public consultations involved key \nstakeholders, including affected people and local government agencies, and the outcomes are \nintegrated in the project design. The draft EIA was publicly disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 9 \nMarch 2015. The SPG, through the PMO, will be responsible for implementation and compliance \nwith the EMP, including inspection, monitoring, reporting, and initiating corrective actions or \nmeasures. The PMO will implement a grievance redress mechanism and have final responsibility \nfor handling any disputes. The PMO is experienced in ADB project implementation, although this \nis  the  first  ADB-funded  project  for  the  five  project  cities  and  counties.  To  support  EMP \nimplementation, loan implementation consultants and a capacity development program are part \nof the project design. \n \n30.  The  project  is  expected  to  achieve  environmental  benefits,  including  stabilizing  of \ngroundwater levels, recharge of the Weifang\u2013Zibo aquifer, reduced land subsidence, improved \nchannel flows and flood capacity, wetland management, improved water security for over 4 \nmillion  people,  and  improved  water  quality.  Anticipated  construction  impacts  are  from  the \nplanned dredging and embankment (temporary damage of in-channel habitats, elevated turbidity, \nlocalized impacts to aquatic fauna, and odor from dredged sediment); air, dust, noise, vibration, \nand erosion impacts; and occupational and community health and safety. Potential operational \nrisks include inadequate maintenance of project structures, including embankments and noise \nemissions from two pump stations. The risk of indirect, cumulative, and/or induced impacts has \nbeen  assessed.  Mitigation  measures  are  described  in  the  EMP.  These  include  the  use  of \nspecialized dredging machinery, timing of dredging, design of embankment habitats, and post-\nconstruction  monitoring  of  aquatic  invertebrates.  The  EIA  concludes  that  effective  EMP \nimplementation, together with the prescribed training, will result in residual impacts within the \nlimits of the PRC standards defined in the EMP. \n \n31.  Indigenous peoples (category C) and involuntary resettlement (category A). The \nproject does not involve any distinct ethnic minority community and thus does not trigger ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) indigenous peoples requirements. With regard to involuntary \nresettlement, the project will have the following impacts: (i) 1,408 mu of collective village land will \nbe permanently acquired and 1,029 people from 255 households on contracted village lands will \nbe affected; (ii) 310 households with 1,167 people will be displaced physically and resettled to a \nresettlement site; and (iii) temporary land acquisition, mostly for land disposal and construction \nfacilities,  will  occupy  9,422  mu  of  collective  village  land  for  1  or  2  years,  affecting  7,297 \nhouseholds.17 About 430 households with 1,720 people will be significantly impacted, all of which \nare in the Changle Nanzhai Reservoir component under the project. Five resettlement plans \nhave been prepared to mitigate the involuntary resettlement impacts and to ensure displaced \npeople are successfully resettled and rehabilitated; the plans have been prepared after extensive \nconsultation with affected villages and farmers. The resettlement plans contain the required \nelements, such as compensation standards, an entitlement matrix, a livelihood restoration plan, a \nbudget, an implementation schedule, external and internal monitoring, and a grievance redress \nmechanism. The total costs for resettlement are estimated at CNY291.51 million and are fully \nincluded in the project budget. The implementing agencies for resettlement have experience with \n                                                \n16  Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17  A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n ", "10 \nlocal  regulations  and  procedures,  and  have  been familiarized  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009)  requirements.

Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.18 The overall risk rating is medium. Adequate \nmitigation measures are in place, which are expected to ensure that the integrated benefits and \nimpacts outweigh the risks and associated costs.  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDelays  in  project  coordination  and  Ensure that the Shandong Water Resources Department assumes the \nsynchronization between agencies.  oversight role to guarantee adequate coordination among the (i) two \nmunicipal governments and five city and county governments; and (ii) \nother key departments in water resources management, notably the \nEnvironment Protection Department and Agricultural Department. \nGovernments of project counties and cities  Provide  training  during  project  implementation  to  city  and  county \nare  unfamiliar  with  ADB  policies,  governments\u2019 staff on ADB\u2019s guidelines and policies and ensure early \nprocedures, and requirements for project  engagement of the procurement agency and project implementation \nimplementation  consultant. \nDelays in resolving land acquisition and  Close monitoring and reporting of resettlement implementation through \nresettlement issues (in particular for the  a professional supervision agency, support from an implementation \nNanzhai Reservoir in Changle County)  consultant,  and  use  of  an  external  monitor.
