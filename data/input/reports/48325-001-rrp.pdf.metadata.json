Studies  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  World  Bank  indicate \nthat,  under  a  business-as-usual  scenario\u2014in  which  half  of  installed  capacity  comprises  coal-\nfired  plants\u2014annual  GHG  emissions  from  power  generation  will  increase  from  less  than  30 \nmillion tCO2e  in 2007 to about 140 million tCO2e in 2030, an increase of  over 400%.3 Almost all \nthe coal and petroleum required to run the power plants is imported, which exposes the country \nto price volatility and fuel shortages. The resulting uncertainty regarding the availability and cost \nof  fuel  makes  it  challenging  to  invest  in  job-creating  energy-intensive  industries  (e.g., \nmanufacturing). \n \nThe Philippines is a leader in deploying conventional renewable energy. It is the second-\n3. \nlargest  producer  of  geothermal  energy  globally;  geothermal  and  hydropower  combined \ncontribute roughly 25% of the installed capacity in Luzon. To promote development of emerging \nrenewable  energy  (wind,  solar,  biomass,  and  ocean  sources),  the  Government  of  the \nPhilippines signed into law the Renewable Energy Act in December 2008, with the objective of \npromoting energy self-reliance and reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels for electricity \ngeneration.4 The Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that the country\u2019s untapped renewable \nenergy potential from emerging renewable energy sources is about 250,000 megawatts (MW). \nThe  DOE  is  targeting  about  2,870  MW  of  additional  installed  capacity  from  these  sources  by \n2030.5 To  encourage  investment  in  the  sector,  the  Renewable  Energy  Act  (i)  provides  fiscal \nincentives  to  emerging  renewable  energy  projects;6 (ii)  requires  distribution  utilities,  electricity \ncooperatives, and retail energy suppliers (collectively,  \u201cCollection Agents\u201d) to source a certain \npercentage  of  their  fuel  requirements  from  renewable  energy  sources;  (iii)  makes  offtake \nagreements  unnecessary,  by  stipulating that  emerging  renewable  energy  projects  benefit from \npriority  (a)  connection  to  the  transmission  and  distribution  system,  and  (b)  purchase  and \ntransmission  of,  and  payment  for,  electricity  sold  through  the  grid;  and  (iv)  provides  that \nrenewable  energy  projects  would  be  eligible to  receive  a fixed  tariff under  a feed-in-tariff (FIT) \n\n                                                           \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Senate Economic Planning Office. 2013. GHG Emissions at a Glance. Manila (March). \n3  ADB. 2009. The Economics of Climate Change in Southeast Asia: A Regional Review. Manila (April 2009); \n  World  Bank.  2009.  An  Assessment  of  Low-Carbon  Interventions  in  the  Transport  and  Power  Sectors  in  the \nPhilippines. Results from Asia Pacific Energy Research Centre. 2006. Energy Demand and Supply Outlook 2006. \nTokyo  also points to similar carbon dioxide emission trends.  \n\n4  At the end of 2011, 49% of the Philippine\u2019s installed generating capacity was supplied by coal and oil, and just 1% \n\nby emerging renewable sources. \n\n5  National Renewable Energy Program. \n6  These incentives include (i) a 7-year income tax holiday, (ii) duty free importation of capital equipment, (iii) special \n\nrealty tax rate, and (iv) 0% value-added tax. \n\n\f2 \n \n\nsystem.  However,  since  the  Renewable  Energy  Act  was  passed,  very  little  investment  in \nrenewable energy plants has been made due to delayed implementation of the FIT scheme. On \n27  July  2012,  the  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (ERC)  announced  the  FIT  rates  and \ninstallation targets for each type of renewable energy source. A tariff of P8.53 per kilowatt-hour \nwas set for wind power, with an initial installation target of 200 MW.  \n \n4. \nFollowing passage of the Renewable Energy Act in 2008, ADB has been approached by \nrenewable  energy  developers  for  potential  financial  support,  including  for  the  project.  The \nfollowing factors make the project a particularly attractive candidate for ADB support: (i) it has a \nstrong  sponsor  with  a  successful  track  record  of  developing,  financing,  constructing,  owning, \nand  operating  power-generation  projects  in  the Philippines;  (ii)  based  on  wind  mapping  by the \nUnited  States  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory,  the  areas  with  the  highest  potential  for \nenergy generation in the Philippines include the Ilocos region where the project is located7\u2014the \nproject will be the second wind farm in the country, with a capacity almost five times that of the \n33 MW Bangui Bay wind farm; (iii) it will contribute to diversification of the Luzon Grid fuel mix, \nwhich  currently  relies  heavily  on  imported  fossil  fuels;  and  (iv)  it  helps  satisfy  growing  power \ndemand without the use of fossil fuel-fired power plants, thereby avoiding an increase in GHG \nemissions commensurate with the increase in overall power generation. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n5. \nThe components of the project are (i) installation of 50 3.0 MW wind turbine generators \n(WTGs)  and  ancillary  plant  equipment;  (ii)  construction  of  a  115-kilovolt  transmission  line, \napproximately 42 kilometers (km) in length; and (iii) construction of a substation in Burgos and \nthe expansion of an existing substation in Laoag City, Ilocos Norte. Construction of the project \nwas undertaken in two phases.8 The project was commissioned in November 2014.  \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsors \n\n6. \nEBWPC  is  a  special-purpose  vehicle  incorporated  in  the  Philippines  specifically  to \ndevelop,  construct,  operate,  and  maintain  a  150  MW  grid-connected  wind  power  plant  in \nBurgos,  Ilocos  Norte.  EBWPC  is  directly  and  wholly  owned  by  EDC Wind  Energy  Holdings,  a \nPhilippines  holding  company  created  to  hold  all  of  the  wind  power  projects  of  the  Energy \nDevelopment  Corporation  (EDC).  EDC Wind  Energy  Holdings  is  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of \nEDC, which in turn is indirectly owned by the Lopez Holdings Corporation. EDC, a publicly listed \ncompany in the Philippines, is the largest geothermal energy producer in the country and also \nthe  largest  integrated  steam  and  geothermal  power  producer  in  the  world.  It  operates  eight \ngeothermal steamfield projects that supply steam to 12 company-owned and subsidiary-owned \ngeothermal power plants with an aggregate installed capacity of 1,164 MW. EDC also partially \nowns and operates two hydropower plants with a combined installed capacity of 132 MW.  \n \n\n                                                           \n7  D.  Eliot.  2000.  Philippines  Wind  Energy  Resource  Atlas  Development.  Golden,  Colorado:  National  Renewable \n\nEnergy Laboratory. \n\n8  The first phase consists of the installation of 29 WTGs with a generation capacity of 87 MW, and the construction \nof  the  transmission  line  and  substation.  Phase  2  consists  of  the  installation  of  an  additional  21  WTGs  with  a \ngeneration capacity of 63 MW. \n\n\f3 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\nThe government is promoting the increased environmental sustainability of the country\u2019s \n7. \nenergy mix by supporting alternative energy sources. The project supports this goal by reducing \nwaste, GHG emissions, and air pollutants compared with a conventional power plant. Improved \nair  quality  and  a  smaller  carbon  footprint  will  provide  healthier  and  more  sustainable  living \nconditions for the people of the Philippines. \n \n8. \nThe  project  will  increase  energy  security  and  reduce  exposure  to  commodity  and \nexchange rate risk. This will help the country reduce its exposure to price volatility and the risk \nthat  fuel  supplies  will  be  unavailable,  thereby  improving  the  investment  climate  for  capital-\nintensive industries that generate employment. \n \n9. \nFurthermore, the project is located in a rural area that will benefit from additional income \nand  employment  resulting  from  the  project\u2019s  construction  and  operation.  The  project  will \nprioritize the hiring of qualified local residents during construction and operation. \n \n10. \nFinally, the DOE anticipates that there will be a generation shortfall in the Luzon Grid of \nabout  200\u2013450  MW  by  2017.9 This  project  will  help  mitigate  the  long-term  power  generation \nshortfall faced by Luzon consumers. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n11. \nThe  project  outcome  is  demonstration  of  the  feasibility  and  sustainability  of  large-scale \nprivate  sector  wind  farms  in  the  country  under  the  new  FIT  regime,  which  will  help  the \nPhilippines accelerate and expand private sector investment in renewable energy infrastructure. \nThe project will also help to meet the government\u2019s target of 200 MW of wind power capacity. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \n \nC. \n\nThe output is the installation and operation of a 150 MW wind farm. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n13. \nThe project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which supports ADB\u2019s investment in \ninfrastructure  to  meet  growing  energy  demands  in  the  region  through  renewable  energy. 10 \nUnder  Strategy  2020,  ADB  infrastructure  operations  will  promote  a  larger  role  for  the  private \nsector in infrastructure financing. This project, which is developed, owned, and operated entirely \nby the private sector, is consistent with that policy. \n \n\n                                                           \n9  C.

Strategy  2020:  The  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  2008\u20132020. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132016  for  the  Philippines  aims  to  help  the \n14. \ncountry  achieve  high,  inclusive,  and  sustainable  growth. 11 The  country  partnership  strategy \nsupports infrastructure development, including development of renewable energy. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with the Energy Policy \n\n15. \nThe project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which requires energy operations to \nbe  aligned  with  ADB's  overall  strategy,  which  emphasizes  energy  security,  facilitating  a \ntransition to a low-carbon economy, universal access to energy, and achieving ADB's vision of a \nregion free of poverty.12  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nThe ADB assistance consists of a direct loan of up to $20 million, without a government \n\n16. \nguarantee. The direct loan will be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n17. \n\nADB\u2019s support for the project is justified based on the following: \n(i) \n\nADB\u2019s long involvement in energy sector development in the Philippines13 makes \nit a credible and effective facilitator of discussions related to the implementation \nof the country\u2019s FIT system. ADB is in a unique position to identify challenges to \nFIT system implementation, as faced by developers and other practitioners, and \nto communicate these through the public sector policy dialogue on the regulatory \nframework and sector management. \nThe  international  investment  community  is  generally  hesitant  to  invest  in  the \ncountry given its historically uncertain regulatory and political environment. ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement  and  strong  relationship  with  the  government  will  provide  comfort  to \ninternational investors, increase commercial bank participation, and help ensure \nthe government\u2019s long-term commitment to the sector. International investors are \nimportant  for  the  project  because  they  can  provide  US  dollar  funding,  which  is \nneeded to match the US dollar-linked component of the FIT. \nThe  innovative  financing  structure  of  the  project  can  be  replicated  by  other \nprivate  sector  investors  to  finance  the  development  and  construction  of \nrenewable energy projects in the country. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \n18. \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \n                                                           \n11 ADB. 2011.

The  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  project  have  been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. These environmental impacts are \ngenerally  site-specific,  reversible,  and  mostly  occur  during  the  construction  stage  where \nmitigation  measures  can  be  readily  designed  and  implemented.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination as well as an environmental management plan and monitoring program have been \nprepared.  Because  the  project  is  already  under  construction,  an  environmental  and  social \ncompliance  audit  was  completed  and  appropriate  measures  to  comply with  ADB  requirements \nwere put in place. Information disclosure and consultations with affected people were conducted \nin accordance with ADB requirements. The institutional capacity and commitment of EBWPC to \nmanage  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  impacts  are  deemed  adequate.  EBWPC  will \nregularly submit environmental safeguards monitoring reports, including reports on the progress \nin implementing corrective actions relating to social safeguards. \n \n19. \nincorporated in the project design.  \n \n20. \nOther social dimensions. Based on the review and assessment of existing operations, \nhuman resource policies, and the current procedures for labor procurement and management, \nthe audit confirms that EBWPC\u2019s policies conform to national labor laws and regulations on the \nprotection of rights and the interests of women. EBWPC requires its contractors to engage local \nlabor,  including  women.  ADB  will  ensure  that  investment  documentation  includes  provisions \nrequiring  the  borrower  to  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and  to  take  specific  measures \n(including in relation to contractors) in line with internationally recognized core labor standards \nand in compliance with ADB\u2019s social protection strategy.14 \n \nB. \n\nThe  climate  change  risk  has  been  assessed,  and  measures  to  address  the  risk \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nEBWPC was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \n21. \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe proposed ADB loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\n\n22. \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 15  the \n23. \nGovernment  of  the  Philippines  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the \nproposed  assistance  to  EBWPC.
