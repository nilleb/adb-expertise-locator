This  will  be  achieved  through  stronger  business \ndevelopment infrastructure, better access to market information, and broader access to finance.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale  \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  Maldives  has  been  confronted  in  recent  years  with  several  challenges  that  had  a \nsevere  impact  on  the  economy.  In  December  2004,  the  ravages  of  the  tsunami  destroyed,  in \nrelative  terms,  a  higher  share  of  natural  infrastructure  in  the  Maldives  than  in  any  of  the  other \nstricken  economies.  In  2007,  the  country  was  mired  in  its  own  fiscal  crisis  linked  to  excessive \nspending and acute structural distortions in the economy, which was further compounded by the \nslowdown in tourism after the global crisis. In 2008, the Maldives managed a difficult transition to \ndemocracy,  which,  in  the  interim  and  given  the  resulting  uncertainty,  led  to  capital  outflow  and \nlimited investment in the economy.   \n \nWhile  much  effort  has  focused  on  rebuilding  the  economy,  the  government  is  now \n4. \nconcentrating on the pursuit of more inclusive growth to rectify some pressing shortcomings such \nas the lack of economic opportunities outside of Mal\u00e9 and the skewed concentration of \u2015enclave\u2016 \neconomic  activity  in  the  resorts-based  tourism  industry.  Political,  administrative,  and  economic \ndecentralization will support this goal, and greater availability of credit is an important platform to \npromote financial inclusion and engender economic and employment opportunities. \n \n5. \nThe  Maldives  has  an  overall  unemployment  rate  of  15.4%,  and  youth  unemployment  is \neven  higher  at  around  25%.  Income  disparities  between  Mal\u00e9  and  the  atolls  are  large  and \nincreasing.  The Gini coefficient  has  remained  almost constant  over  time  at  around  0.4,  which is \nnotably  higher  than  that  in  neighboring  countries.  Over  time  inequality  between  Mal\u00e9  and  the \natolls has steadily increased. MSME development has been prioritized by the government as one \nof the key solutions toward fostering greater economic inclusion, and the lack of access to finance \nas the  most  significant  impediment  to  the  promotion  and  development  of  MSMEs.  As  part  of  its \nearlier  effort  to  support  inclusive  growth  through  private  sector  development,  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  technical  assistance  loan  in  2008  for  the  Private  Sector \nDevelopment Project (PSDP) to support MSMEs in the Maldives.2 \n \n6. \nAchievements under the Private Sector Development Project. MSME development is \npart of the development strategy for the Maldives under the 7th National Plan, 2006\u20132010. Until \n2011, there was no official definition of MSMEs in the Maldives. Furthermore, the local banks had \nno  direction  or  guidelines  on  how  to  assist  MSMEs.  The  major  achievements  under  the  PSDP \ninclude (i) establishment of a central business development service center (BDSC) and two field \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Technical Assistance \n\nLoan to the Republic of the Maldives for the Private Sector Development Project. Manila.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nfor  more \n\ntraining,  and  counseling \n\n(v)  completion  of  business \n\nBDSCs; (ii) establishment of a cost-sharing facility (CSF) (SDR0.6 million), a line-of-credit facility \n(LCF)  (SDR1.8  million),  and  a  credit  information  bureau  (CIB),  and  a  feasibility  study  on  a \ncentralized  movable  asset  registry  (now  referred  to  as  secured  transaction  registry  [STR]); \n(iii) provision of business counseling and mentoring for over 500 entrepreneurs; (iv) start-up of 55 \nthan \nnew  MSMEs; \n4,000 beneficiaries,  41%  of  whom  were  women;  (vi)  launch  of  a  BDSC  web  portal  to  promote \nBDSC services and dissemination of information related to MSME registration and CSF and LCF \napplication procedures; and (vii) public\u2013private partnership (PPP) capacity building that included \ndeveloping  a  PPP  framework  and  piloting  three  PPP  initiatives.  Around  60  MSMEs  in  fisheries, \ntourism, arts, and handicrafts have benefited from the LCF, which helped expand their business \noperations, develop their capacity for accessing finance from the banks, and formalize the MSME \nsector through registration.3 \n \nRemaining  challenges.  The  success  of  the  PSDP 4  led  to  further  demand  from \n7. \nstakeholders  for  continued,  demonstration-based  support.  The  PSDP  resulted  in  the  market \ndemanding  additional  and  more  sophisticated  business  development  services  (BDS).  Further \nwork is needed to (i) improve the quality and depth of BDS on offer; (ii) add a range of new BDS; \nand  (iii)  expand  the  geographic  coverage  of  BDS  to  ensure  countrywide  availability.  Even \nconservative  assessments indicate  a large  unmet credit  demand  of  $15 million\u2013$30 million from \nMSMEs. Despite the PSDP\u2019s success in improving access to finance, considerable work remains \nto  be  done  to  bridge  this  gap.  Given  the  stringent  collateral  requirements  imposed  by  banks,  a \nmechanism for reviewing collateral requirements will need to be developed.5 Similarly, a credible \nmechanism  to  record  movable  assets  that  can  serve  to  meet  strict  collateral  requirements  will \nneed  to  be  provided.  The  use  of  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  innovations \nreduces  transaction  costs  for  financing,  which  opens  up  new  markets  for  MSME  products  and \nservices, and better targets MSMEs, especially in geographically dispersed islands. Furthermore, \nthe  Maldives  faces  significant  energy  challenges  since  imported  diesel  meets  nearly  80%  of  its \nenergy requirements.6  \n \n8. \nLessons.  As  recommended  by  the  Independent  Evaluation  Department\u2019s  country \nassistance  program  evaluation,7 continued  engagement  with  a  sector  and  a  long-term  focus  will \nenable  better  policy  dialogue,  improve  sector  outcome,  and  increase  development  impact.  The \nPSDP is a pilot project that could not cover some areas (e.g., establishment of the STR due to the \nlimited  resource  envelope  and  providing  sufficient  time  for  the  STR  project  feasibility  study). \nAccordingly,  although  the  PSDP  has  been  successful  within  its  limited  scope  and  resources, \nfurther  support  is  essential  for  continued  and  sustainable  credit  delivery.  To  bolster  project \ndelivery, any further assistance should be provided in a phased manner and should address both \nthe  supply  and  demand  sides  of  MSME  development.  The  assistance  should  also  focus  on \ndelivering the elements of the MSME Act that the government has submitted to Parliament. The \nMaldives country  partnership  strategy (CPS),  2007\u20132011  followed  a sequential  approach  of  first \n\n                                                \n3  SDR1.8 million  was  allocated to  the  LCF  and  SDR0.6 million  to  the  CSF corresponding  to  $2.84 million and $0.95 \nmillion,  respectively,  as  of  February  2012.  As  of  29  February  2012,  the  Bank  of  Maldives  (BML)  has  awarded \ncontracts  under  the  LCF  for  a  total  of  $2.15  million  (75%)  and  disbursed  $0.7  million  (25%),  and  the  Ministry  of \nEconomic  Development  (MED)  has  awarded  contracts  for  $0.82  million  (86%)  and  disbursed  around  46%  of  total \nCSF. The BML and MED confirm that the balance will be sanctioned by the end of April 2012.  \n\n4  ADB. 2011. Evaluation Study: The Maldives. Manila. \n5  Lack of collateral is cited as a critical inhibitor for access to finance for MSMEs, and the collateral requirements are as \n\nhigh as 120% of the value of the loan. Only houses and boats can be submitted as collateral. \n\n6  The government has announced a program to generate at least 60% of its electricity from solar energy by 2020 as \none of the key objectives under its pledge to be carbon neutral by 2020. Awareness raising, demonstration, and the \nidentification of opportunities for renewable energy in an MSME context, especially through PPP, are imperative.  \n\n7  ADB. 2011. Country Assistance Program Evaluation: The Maldives. Manila. \n\n\f \n3 \n\nproviding  much-needed  capacity  development  assistance  and  intervention  to  improve  the \nenabling environment for private sector development; and thereafter, resuming investment lending \nin  the  CPS  priority  sectors  of  energy,  transport,  and  MSME  development.8 The  project  is  fully \naligned  with  CPS  and  the  objectives  of  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Operational  Plan  and  has  been \nclosely coordinating with the development partners.9  \n \n9. \nWork  under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  indicated  that  the  major \nconstraints identified at the launch of the PSDP had been largely addressed.10 However, there is \nan unfinished agenda from the PSDP in terms of setting up the STR, creating a credit guarantee \nscheme,  extending  BDS  across  the  country,  and  increasing  credit  lending  under  the  LCF.  The \nproposed  project  will  focus  on  financial  inclusion;  hence,  it  is  important  to  extend  the  coverage \nand  the  outreach  of  the  PSDP  in  solving  MSME  issues  such  as  limited  market  access,  lack  of \ninternal  capacity,  and  the  high  cost  of  financing,  transportation,  and  power.  Some  key  lessons \nfrom  the  PSDP  include  the  need  for  (i)  continued  institutional  strengthening,  (ii) market-oriented \nskills  development  for  MSMEs,  (iii)  sustainability  of  the  initiatives  taken  under  the  PSDP,  (iv) a \nstrong and independent project management unit, and (v) an organizational change management \nprocess involving stakeholders. These lessons are embedded in the project design. \n \nB.  \n \nThe impact will be a more inclusive and broad-based MSME sector. The outcome will be a \n10. \nfurther expanded and strengthened MSME sector. For this purpose, the project will strengthen the \nbusiness  environment  and  support  infrastructure  for  doing  business  with  better  knowledge, \ngreater access to financing, and expanded business opportunities for MSMEs. \n \nC.  \n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\nincluding  business \n\nincubator  programs;  (iii)  strengthening \n\nComponent 1: Business Support Infrastructure Built (Demand Side) \n\n1. \n \n11. \nComponent  1  will  increase  MSME  access  to  BDS  and  support  institutional  capacity \nbuilding  for  BDSCs  by  (i)  expanding  BDSCs\u2019  geographical  coverage  to  all  seven  provinces; \n(ii) introducing  new  BDS, \nthe \ninstitutional, operational, infrastructure, and human resource capacity of the expanded BDSCs to \nbetter  support  demand  of  MSMEs;  and  (iv)  transitioning  the  BDSCs  under  a  corporate \ngovernance development plan into a viable and privately managed BDS delivery network.11  \n \nimplementation  capacity  strengthened  and  enabling \n12. \nenvironment  for  MSME  development  improved. Output  1  will include capacity  building  of  the \nMinistry  of  Economic  Development  (MED),  Maldives  Monetary  Authority  (MMA),  and  Bank  of \nMaldives (BML), and setting up project management units (PMUs) at these entities. Output 1 will \nalso  strengthen  the  legal  framework  for  (i) broader  access  to  finance;  and  (ii)  commercial  laws \npertaining to MSMEs, including new e-commerce and data protection laws. Furthermore, women \nin the  Maldives,  particularly those in  the  outer islands,  are excluded from  participation  in MSME \n\nOutput  1:  Program \n\n                                                \n8  ADB. 2007.

This  component  will  support  energy  sector  links  to  value  chain  business  opportunities  with \npotential for MSME participation, and also focus on ensuring continuity of facilities established under the PSDP and \ncoordination with various government efforts.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\ndevelopment  due  to  traditional  stereotyping  of  their  role,  and  the  reluctance  of  young \nentrepreneurs to engage in traditional activities such as fisheries and agriculture. To increase their \nparticipation,  interventions  envisaged  would  include  exercises  to  build  marketable  skills,  and \nspecial provisions such as earmarking part of the LCF for this segment.  \n \n13. \nOutput 2: Business development service centers and business incubator programs \nstrengthened. The project will strengthen the capacity of the BDSC network, broaden the range \nof products and services offered, improve the capacity of BDSCs to better serve business needs \nof  MSMEs,  and  increase  BDSC  operational  performance  and  business  profitability.  Two  BDSC-\noperated business incubator facilities\u2014one in the north and the other in the south\u2014will work with \nselected  MSMEs  under  business  partnership  agreements.  MSME  selection  will  be  based  on \ntransparent selection criteria.12 \n \n14. \nOutput  3:  Credit  guarantee  scheme  initiated.  A  consultancy  will  be  provided  for  (i) \ndesigning  and  making  credit  guarantee  schemes  operational  toward  reducing  the  collateral \nrequirement  for  MSMEs,  (ii)  initiating  a  credit  guarantee  fund  to  diminish  the  risk  incurred  by \nlenders  and  ease  access  to  credit  for  MSMEs  without  sufficient  collateral  to  meet  bank \nrequirements; and (iii) undertaking a public awareness campaign to explain the key features of the \nfund.  Following  a  preparatory  consultancy,  the  fund  will  start  with  the  capital  contributed  by  the \ngovernment, and a new entity will be established to manage the fund.  \n \n\n2.    Component 2: Access to Finance Improved (Supply Side) \n\n \n15. \nComponent 2 will improve MSME access to finance by (i) adding to the LCF to meet the \nhuge  credit  demand  from  MSMEs,  (ii)  extending  the  CIB  to  improve  information  quality  and \nreduce credit risk, and (iii) establishing an STR database on fixed and movable assets.  \n \n16.   Output 1: Line-of-credit facility expanded. An additional LCF of $8.5 million will be built \nwith feedback from MED and BML on the implementation of the pilot LCF, which was set up under \nthe PSDP to promote a culture of lending to MSMEs with less restrictive collateral requirements \nand  cash-flow-based  financing.13 Of  this,  $1.5  million  will  be financed  by  ADB  and  $7  million  by \nthe Islamic Development Bank (IDB). The government will relend the $1.5 million to BML through \na  subsidiary loan agreement,  detailing the  terms  and conditions  of  onlending  by BML to  eligible \nMSMEs  according      to      the      eligibility      criteria14     mutually      agreed      by      ADB      and      the \ngovernment.15 The loan term will  not  exceed 15  years, including  a  3-year grace period, with the \n\n                                                \n12  The  project  will  continue  to  support  the  CSF  established  under  the  PSDP  and  it  will  be  funded  by  IDB.  The  CSF \nmanagement will be as per procedures defined in the CSF manual developed under the PSDP.  Please see Project \nAdministration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) for a list of selection criteria. \n\n13 During the pilot LCF, more than 100 applications were submitted across the country. Based on the expected demand \nand a financing gap estimated from the pilot, an additional $8 million\u2013$10 million is required. To provide BML with an \nincentive for onlending to MSMEs with less restrictive collateral arrangement, MOFT provides an 80% guarantee for \ndefaulting subloans. BML bears the remaining risk to ensure diligence in its lending activities.  \n\n14 Eligible MSMEs are selected on the basis of sectors identified by the government for accelerated growth based on \nnational priorities. During the PSDP, fisheries, agriculture, tourism, arts and handicrafts were identified as the priority \nsectors. Projects which required financing between Rf0.5-1 million were considered eligible. Preference was given to \nenterprises operating in the Bazaar Islands and to young entrepreneurs. \n\n15 The terms and conditions of onlending will define the required degree of dilution of collateral and the interest rate to \nbe charged by BML for the loans extended to the MSMEs. The rate of interest charged by the government to BML will \nreflect  the  cost  of  raising  funds  in  Mal\u00e9.  The  interest  rate  for  onlending  to  MSMEs  in  the  pilot  LCF  was  linked  to \nprevailing Treasury bill rates and was fixed at 6.84% per annum. \n\n\f \n5 \n\ngovernment retaining the right to close the LCF.16 MOFT will cause BML to ensure that qualified \nenterprises  procure  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services  in  accordance  with  procurement \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB. 17  BML  has  experience  with  development  banking  and  an \nadequate  number  of  professional  staff  to  administer  the  expanded  LCF,  as  shown  in  the \nsuccessful  implementation  of  the  pilot  LCF.  BML  will  be  required  to  satisfy,  and  remain  in \ncompliance with, the eligibility criteria throughout the project period.18  \n \n17. \nOutput 2: Credit information bureau enhanced. Established under the MMA, the CIB is \na central repository of credit histories (positive and negative) of borrowers. Output 2 will (i) expand \nthe  membership  (including  telecommunication  and  utility  companies;  and  other  nonbank  credit \nproviders  such  as  insurance  companies,  student  loan  providers,  and  other  public  and  private \ncredit  providers);  (ii)  develop  new  reporting  and  credit  scoring  products,  including  customized \nproducts  to  meet  individual  member\u2019s  information  needs;  and  (iii)  raise  public  awareness  about \nthe need for building a credit track record, explaining the role of the CIB in lending decisions, and \nassisting the development of a positive credit reputation. \n \nOutput 3: Secured transaction registry established. In line with a feasibility study under \n18. \nthe  PSDP,  an  STR  will  be  established  under  the  MMA  to  help  MSMEs  with  sound  business \nfinancials  to  secure  credit  against  movable  assets  and  thus  facilitate  access to  finance  for  such \nenterprises  even  if  they  do  not  have  adequate  collateral.  Output  3  will  include  (i)  as-is  and \nrequirement  analysis,  and  technical  specification  based  on  internationally  acceptable  best \npractices; and (ii) establishment of an online and publicly searchable STR recording the interests \nof  financiers  in  assets,  and  helping  credit  providers  to  take  security  over  movable  property,  and \nfind out pre-existing charges against assets and priority position of multiple charges on assets. \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Technologies for Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprise \nDevelopment Established (Market Development)  \n\n \nComponent  3  will  enable  the  use  of  ICT  to  promote  information  and  knowledge  sharing \n19. \nbetween  MSMEs  and  with  the  government;  and  implementation  of  a  pilot  ICT  project  to \n(i) demonstrate the viability of solar energy as a cost-effective energy option; (ii) create a platform \nfor delivery of e-governance services, such as e-commerce and e-payment through citizen service \ncenters (CSCs); and (iii) create a revenue stream for BDSCs to increase their contribution to the \ngross  domestic  product.  To  ensure  the  feasibility  of  the  proposed  CSCs,  an  initial  study  on  the \nproposed location and methodology will be conducted. \n \nOutput  1:  Micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprise  portal  and  judgment  debt \n20. \ndatabase  created.  Output  1  will  improve  access  to  information  and  knowledge  sharing  through \nan MSME portal through which MSMEs will be able to get information on any aspect of the project \nand lodge grievances on any problems faced. Judgment debts against MSMEs, awarded by the \ncourts,  need  to  be  centrally  captured  to  give  a  financial  picture  of  the  MSMEs  to  the  banks. \nCurrently, the judgment debt records are kept manually and no central database exists. Creation \nof the judgment debt database will provide a central repository of all judgment debts. \n\n                                                \n16 Project  Administration  Manual  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  Onlending  will  be \nundertaken  through  an  independent  credit  risk  assessment  by  BML,  and  onlending  agreements  will  be  signed \nbetween BML and the sub-borrowers. MOFT will bear the foreign exchange risk. \n\n17 To  be  acceptable,  such  procurement  procedures  should  (i)  be  in  accordance  with  established  private  sector  or \ncommercial  practices;  (ii)  be  appropriate  under  the  circumstances;  and  (iii)  comply  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date). \n\n18 In line with  the ADB Operations Manual section on financial intermediation loans (OM D6), BML meets all eligibility \ncriteria for financial intermediaries, as shown during PSDP implementation. Furthermore, BML builds staff capacity for \nmobilizing domestic resources through various training programs. Details are in the Project Administration Manual. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n21. \nOutput 2: Citizen service centers established. One option for making BDSCs financially \nsustainable  is to  expand  the current  BDSCs  to serve  as CSCs.  It will  provide  an  opportunity  for \nthe BDSCs to conduct training programs for MSMEs, and also be critical for ensuring sustainable \nrevenue generation after project implementation. Under the project, it is proposed to set in place a \nsuitable risk-sharing mechanism  between  public  and  private sectors to establish  the  CSCs  on a \nPPP format.19 Furthermore, solar power technology will be considered in establishing the CSCs.20  \n \nD. \n \n22. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $21.02  million  equivalent  (Table  1).  ADB  financing  of \n$10.02 million will be used for outputs 1\u20133. IDB will provide parallel cofinancing of $10.30 million \nequivalent  under  istisna\u2019a 21 loan  terms,  which  will  be  used  to  operate  the  LCF,  LCF-related \ncapacity  building,  and  the  CSF.22 The  government  will  provide  counterpart  financing  of  $0.70 \nmillion equivalent.  \n \n\n \nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem  \n\nA.

The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of \n1.0%  per  annum  during the  grace  period  and 1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  and such  other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft financing and project agreements.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n19 The CSCs will be structured on a PPP arrangement, for which the appropriate format will be worked out during due \n\ndiligence. \n\n20 Consideration  will be  given  to  powering  the  CSCs using solar  energy  to  demonstrate  the  use of  renewable  energy \n\nand lower energy costs for BDSCs and CSCs.  \n\n21 Istisna\u2019a is a Shari\u2019ah (Islamic law) mode of financing widely used by Islamic banks, and its  terms can be up to 20 \n\nyears, including a grace period of up to 5 years.  \n\n22 Since  implementation  of  the  ADB  components  will  require  a  substantial  period,  the  ADB  portion  of  the  LCF \n($1.5 million)  will  be  implemented  upfront.  Before  IDB\u2019s  LCF  starts,  the  ADB-funded  $1.5  million  will  need  to  be \nsanctioned under the project by BML.

Due to lack of experience by project \nimplementation  units,  some  projects  are  completed  with  delays  of  3\u20134  years,  undermining  their \ndevelopment  effectiveness.  Against  this  background,  three  PMUs  were  established  under  the \nPSDP. Their performance was satisfactory and they played an integral part toward the successful \nimplementation  of  government  projects.  Accordingly,  PMUs  will  be  set  up  at  MED,  MMA,  and \nBML, and their project directors will be assisted by consultants. \n \nB. \n \n26. \nBased  on  the  economic  analysis,  the  project  is  expected  to  have  several  economic \nbenefits: (i) $5 million increment in the gross domestic product (GDP) by 2016 as local sourcing of \neconomic  activity  gains  from  broader  access  to  credit,  (ii) a  more  positive  balance  of  payments \nthrough an assumed 10% increase in exports and 20% reduction in imports, (iii) tax revenues of \napproximately  $2.4  million,  (iv)  minimum  $12  million  of  add-back  to  GDP  through  a  reduction  in \nnonperforming  assets,  and  (v)  $15  million  incremental  turnover  in  the  MSME  sector.  Other \neconomic  benefits  include  lower  government  payroll  expenditure  as  MSMEs  generate  jobs, \nincreased lending appetite of banks and additional funds available for credit, and a robust finance \nsector  with  better  credit  judgment  resulting  from  access  to  information  through  the  CIB  and \nestablishment of the STR.  \n \n27. \nA financial analysis was carried out in accordance with ADB guidelines. All financial costs \nand benefits have been expressed in nominal terms. Cost streams used to determine the financial \ninternal rate of return (i.e., capital investment, and operation and maintenance) reflects the cost of \ndelivering  the  estimated  benefits.26 Besides  the  returns  expected  from  the  CIB  as  a  result  of \nexpanded  membership  and  increased  sale  of  reports,  interest  income  owing  to  fewer \nnonperforming assets and interest savings owing to less foreign debt have been included in the \nrevenue stream.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  nearly  12%  compares  favorably  with  the \nstandard  cost  of  capital  of  slightly  above  4%,  indicating  substantive  financial  viability  for  the \nproject. Nonquantifiable financial  benefits, increased capacity  of MSMEs,  better  access to credit \ninformation, and other related benefits are not included.  \n \nC. \n \n28. \nFinancial management and procurement capacity assessment, undertaken during the fact-\nfinding  mission  in October  2011,  indicates  that MOFT  and the  three implementing  agencies can \nmanage loan  proceeds  during  project  implementation.  The  PMUs  at  the  implementing  agencies \nhave experience in financial management and procurement in accordance with ADB requirements, \n \n \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n26 With operation  and maintenance  cost taken as  10%  of  the  infrastructure cost, the  total  operation  and maintenance \nexpenditure beyond the project period is estimated at $0.39 million. The depreciation rate is assumed at 15%. The \nincremental turnover of the MSME sector as a result of the project is estimated at $15 million on account of  a new \nloan injection. Given the tax\u2013GDP ratio of 15.7% (2009 World Bank data), the tax revenue by the end of the project \nperiod is estimated at $2.4 million, with 50% to be accrued by the third  year and 100% by  the fourth  year, beyond \nwhich it is assumed to stay static.  \n\n\f \n9 \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nand a satisfactory track record from the PSDP.27 Planned mitigating measures include adopting a \nsequential  approach  in  line  with  lessons  from  the  PSDP,  strengthening  the  PMUs  through \nmonitoring  consultants\u2019  performance,  and  capacity  building  interventions.  During  the  fact-finding \nmission,  ADB  also  conducted  an  evaluation  of  BML  and found  that  it  is  eligible to  operate  as  a \nfinancial  intermediary.  The  manuals  and  processes  that  are  in  place  under  the  PSDP  for \nadministration  of  the  various  interventions  would  also  significantly  contribute  to  risk  mitigation. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the \nproject administration manual.  \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  will  target  population  groups  across  the  country  and  will  lead  to  the \n29. \ndevelopment  of  new  and  existing  MSMEs,  thereby  generating  jobs,  particularly  among  women \nand the youth. The services provided by the BDSCs are aimed at increasing the competitiveness \nof MSMEs and supporting export promotion.  \n \n30. \nTo ensure gender mainstreaming, the project will support interventions designed to boost \nentrepreneurship  and  build marketable  skills for women and  the  youth. Interventions  will  include \npublic  awareness,  capacity  building  and  training,  research  and  studies  for  gender  issues,  and \npriority in accessing business development services. A gender action plan will be implemented to \nensure  inclusiveness  in  the  project  and  to  meet  the  unique  needs  of  women  and  vulnerable \ngroups,  the  views  of  which  will  be  solicited  with  respect  to  any  proposed  legislation  or  legal \namendments. The use of temporary special measures to increase women\u2019s participation in MSME \ndevelopment will be encouraged. By supporting less-developed areas of the country, the project \nwill help minimize geographical inequality and contribute to balanced regional development, and \nultimately contribute to improving the Gini coefficient.  \n \nE. \n \n31. \nThe project is categorized as \u2015FI treated as C\u2016 for environment, involuntary resettlement, \nand  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  unlikely  to  have  any  adverse  environmental  impact. \nRather,  it  will  explore  nonconventional  energy  sources  for  MSMEs  to  reduce  their  carbon \nfootprints. MSME action under the additional LCF will only be for subprojects or activities that (i) \nare  not  included  in  the  list  of  prohibited  investment  activities  set  out  in  Appendix  5  of  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009); and (ii) have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts in \naccordance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  in  compliance  with  Maldivian  laws  and \nregulations. 28  The  project  is  required  to  comply  with  applicable  government  environmental \nregulations  and  standards.  No  involuntary  resettlement  and  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  are \nanticipated.    \n\nSafeguards \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n \n32.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  pertain  to  (i)  political  transition  and  changes  in  the \n\n                                                \n27 Since  the  project  is  an  extension  of  the  PSDP  and  the  tasks  envisaged  under  both  are  similar  in  nature,  similar \ngovernance and corruption risks are expected for both projects. The key governance risk pertains to interference in \nproject  management.  All  risks  arise  from  the  possibilities  of  influencing  the  objective  sanction  of  credit  through  the \nLCF, misuse  of  the  LCF,  lack  of  engagement  of  participants,  deficiencies in  the  operation  of  and  resultant  gaps  in \ninformation generated by the CIB and the proposed STR, and inability of beneficiaries to meet expectations. \n\n28 The LCF guidelines will include a set of subloan eligibility criteria as set out in the PAM and financing agreement. The \nscreening  checklist  will  be  developed  by  the  project  management  consultants  at  MED,  and  training  for  relevant \nsafeguard capacity development will be provided to staff at MED and bankers at BML.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\ncomposition  of  the  senior  counterparts,29 (ii)  lack  of  internal  capacity  for  project  implementation \nand  management,  (iii)  capacity  issues  in  the  judiciary  to  enforce  legal  reforms  coupled  with \nabsence  of  political  will  to  implement  the  required  legal  reforms,  and  (iv)  interference  in  the \nselection  of  beneficiaries  under  the  project.  Adequate  risk  mitigation  measures  have  been \nenvisaged  through  a significant  grant  input, which will support capacity  development  and set  up \nthe  PMUs  as  a  separate  output.  The  risk  of  interference  has  been  mitigated  through  detailed \ndocumentation  of  procedures  for  the  granting  of  benefits.  As  the  risks  can  be  mitigated  to  a \nmanageable level, the intended benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.30  \n \n\nIV. \n\n ASSURANCES \n\n \n33. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, \nprocurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described \nin  project \nadministration  manual  and  loan  documents.  The  government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n34. \nConditions  for  Disbursement.
