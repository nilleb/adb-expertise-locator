It  is \nalso  experiencing  a  rapid  influx  of  business  and  tourism  since  the  country  has  become  an \nappealing  new  destination  for  investment  and  sightseeing.  However,  the  steady  increase  of \ninternational visitors and the surge in demand for hotel rooms, long-term accommodation, and \noffice  space  are  currently  overwhelming  Yangon,  the  country\u2019s  largest  commercial  city  and \ntransit hub. Chronic underinvestment in tourism and business infrastructure has left the city with \ninadequate  and  insufficient  working  and  living  spaces,  which  inhibits  economic  growth,  job \ncreation,  and  foreign  investment.  The  country  requires  an  estimated  $146 billion  in  urban \ninfrastructure investment for its large cities during 2010\u20132030; of this, almost 60% is required for \nresidential housing ($87 billion) and more than 10% ($17 billion) for commercial space.3 \n \n3. \nThe current project comprises the revitalization of an emerging central business district \nin Yangon,  including  hotel,  retail,  office,  and residential  space;  and  a  district  cooling  plant  and \nnetwork to serve the locality.4 It is being developed by Yoma Strategic Holdings, First Myanmar \nInvestment (FMI), Mitsubishi Corporation, and Mitsubishi Estate. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  is  providing  loan  and  equity  investment  in  parallel  with  the  International  Finance \nCorporation (IFC). The current project will help reduce the acute shortage of business, tourism, \nand  residential  infrastructure  in  Yangon,  and  enable  commercial  activity  and  the  import  of \ncapital, skills, and technology that the country requires to transition to a modern economy. \n \nThe  concentration  of  business  and  tourism  activity  in  Yangon  will  put  increasing \n4. \npressure on public utilities and the environment. Yangon has a hot tropical monsoon climate in \nwhich  daytime temperatures  hover  around  30\u00b0C.  Accordingly,  air  conditioning  is  an  expensive \nnecessity  for  businesses  and  tourism,  and  accounts  for  a  significant  percentage  of  electricity \nconsumption,  especially  during  peak  periods.  The  current  project  includes  the  country\u2019s  first \ndistrict  cooling  plant,  which  will  provide  sustainable,  efficient,  reliable,  and  essential  cooling \nservices.  The  plant  will  use  state-of-the-art  technology  to  significantly  reduce  electricity \n\n                                                \n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2014.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \nProposed  Loans,  Equity  Investment,  and  Guarantee  to  the  Republic  of  the  Union  of  Myanmar  for  the  Yangon \nUrban Renewal and District Cooling Project.

New York. \n4  The overall development also includes the restoration and adaptive reuse of the former headquarters of the British \nBurma  Railway  Company,  a  Victorian  building  built  in  1877  that  is  currently  in  a  dilapidated  state.  Although  the \nrestoration will not be part of the ADB or IFC financing, it will be a centerpiece to the overall development. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nconsumption for cooling compared with conventional air conditioning. The plant will help reduce \nthe  strain  on  Yangon\u2019s  electrical  grid,  reduce  power  plant  fuel  consumption,  provide  cost \nsavings to end-users, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \n \nThe Board approved the current project on 26 June 2014 (footnote 1). On 9 June 2015, \n5. \nthe ADB Investment Committee approved the extension of the Board approval validity period by \n1 year (until 26 June 2016).  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nImpact.  The  overall  project  will  increase  business  and  tourism,  while  preserving  and \n6. \nprotecting  Myanmar\u2019s  heritage.  Tourism  is  an  important  part  of  the  Myanmar  economy  and \nprovides immediate employment and income generation for the poor. \n \nOutcome. The overall project outcome will be sustainable tourism and business growth \n7. \nin Yangon. The overall project will also raise tax revenues, improve foreign exchange earnings, \ncreate  opportunities  for  small  and  medium-sized  business,  and  increase  the  sourcing  of  local \ngoods and services, all of which contributes to economic growth and poverty alleviation. \n \n8. \nOutputs.  The  overall  project  outputs  will  be  that  3.9  hectares  of  integrated  urban \nrenewal  development  in  central  Yangon  is  built  and  operating,  and  that  an  energy-efficient \ndistrict  cooling  system  is  installed.  The  overall  project  will  play  an  important  role  in  supplying \nbasic  tourism  and  business  infrastructure  in  Yangon,  which  will  support  productivity,  job \ncreation, and sustainable economic growth. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n9. \nConsistency  with  Strategy  2020  and  the  country  strategy.  ADB  assistance  for  the \ncurrent  project  is  aligned  with  Strategy  2020,  which  supports  environmentally  sustainable, \nprivate-sector-assisted  development  to  meet  growing  energy  demand  in  the  region  and  to \novercome  critical  infrastructure  shortages.  Strategy  2020  also  focuses  support  on  livable  and \nsustainable  cities  that  reduce  the  carbon  footprint,  and  on  low-income  and  fragile  countries.5 \nThe  assistance  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  interim  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132014  for \nMyanmar, which was extended to 2016 and supports environmentally sustainable development \nby  integrating  environmental  considerations  into  projects  for  promoting  green  and  climate-\nresilient growth.6 The interim strategy also aims to accelerate economic growth; create income \nopportunities; and create a supportive environment for the private sector, in particular for small \nand medium-sized enterprises. \n \n10. \nConsistency  with  the  sector  strategy.  The  current  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnergy  Policy  and  its  Urban  Operational  Plan,  2012\u20132020,7 which  both  stress  environmental \nsustainability  and  private  sector  participation,  including  specific  investments  in  district  cooling. \nThe current project is consistent with (i) the Urban Development and Water Sector Assessment, \n\n                                                \n5  ADB.  2008.

In  a  country  with  limited  financing  options\u2014owing  to  its \nlong  absence  from  international  lending  markets,  lack  of  a  track  record,  and  nonexistence  of \nlocal long-term financing\u2014multilateral assistance for large-scale projects is indispensable. \n \nADB assistance will help reduce the acute shortage of business infrastructure in Yangon \n14. \nand revitalize the city\u2019s emerging central business district of Yangon, and help the city become \nmore competitive and environmentally sustainable. \n \nADB  assistance  will  help  Myanmar  capitalize  on  its  untapped  tourism  potential,  which \n15. \ncan have a significant role in economic growth and poverty reduction through direct and indirect \nemployment. Tourism is the most labor-intensive industry after agriculture, offering unskilled and \nsemiskilled opportunities in urban and rural areas, as well as gender equality\u201440% to 50% of \nall tourism workers in Myanmar are women. \n \n16. \nADB assistance provides a timely opportunity to help institute environmental and social \nsafeguards and best industry practices during early sector development. The project will adopt \nADB  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies,  setting  a  standard  for  subsequent  projects. \nMany Asian cities have experienced rapid urban growth, albeit at a heavy cost: sprawl, pollution, \nand congestion. The overall project will incorporate sound practices and investments in energy \nefficiency  and  leapfrog  technologies  (such  as  district  cooling  plants)  as  well  as  modern \nwastewater  treatment  systems.  Improving  the  quality  of  life  and  mitigating  climate  change  will \nhelp bolster Yangon as a vibrant and livable city with sustainable commerce and tourism. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n17. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  overall  project  is \nclassified  as  category  B  for  environment  and  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous  peoples.  The  change  in  scope  has  limited  impact  on  the  safeguard  categorization \nsince the increase in floor area is achieved through more efficient use of space, and not from an \nincrease in the structural footprint or project site. The potential environmental and social impacts \nof  the  overall  project  were  identified  and  effective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and \ncompensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. The \ninstitutional  capacity  and commitment  of  Yoma, FMI,  Mitsubishi  Estate, Mitsubishi  Corporation \nto manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n\n\f5 \n \n\nThe project has prepared an initial environmental examination to cover all aspects of the \n18. \nproject  following  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement. 13  The  initial  environmental  examination \nincludes  an  environmental  and  social  management  plan  to  adequately  manage  potential \nimpacts during construction and operation, such as noise, dust, water quality and quantity, solid \nand  liquid  waste,  hazardous  waste,  exposure  of  workers  to  occupational  health  and  safety \nhazards, and cultural heritage conservation. The project is developing internal risk management \nprocedures and assigning a director of risk management and compliance to be responsible for \noverall environmental and social risk management. To minimize and mitigate potential impacts, \nthe current project will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with \nrequirements; \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nthe  World  Bank  Group\u2019s  general \nenvironmental, health, and safety guidelines; and national environmental laws and regulations. \n \nThe 3.9-hectare project site is located in the city core of Yangon on land belonging to the \n19. \nMRT. The site has been leased to  Mee Ya Hta International Hotel since 1993, and the overall \nproject  is  not  expected  to  have  impacts  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples. \nDue diligence confirms that (i) no informal settlers or vendors use the project area, and (ii) the \ncurrent  project  area  and  surroundings  have  no  record  of  settlements  of  ethnic  groups  or \nindigenous  peoples.  The  existing  structures  on  the  site  are  (i)  Myanmar  Railway  Building,  (ii) \nFMI  Centre,  (iii)  Grand  Mee  Ya  Hta  Executive  Residence,  (iv)  Zawygyi  House,  and  (v)  two \nabandoned residential buildings. With the exception of the Myanmar Railway Building, which will \nbe  architecturally  restored  and  converted  to  a  boutique  hotel,  the  other  buildings  will  be \ndemolished.  The  Grand  Mee  Ya  Hta  Executive  Residence  was  vacated  in  October  2013.  The \nFMI  Centre  (an  office  and  commercial  complex)  and  Zawygyi  House  (a  restaurant)  will  be \nvacated  by  2017,  after  providing  at  least  6 months\u2019  notice  to  existing  tenants.  The  project \nengaged  stakeholders  in  the  surrounding  communities  during  the  project  design.  A  grievance \nredress mechanism to deal with public complaints is in place. Consultations carried out as part \nof the initial environmental examination did not identify any outstanding grievances. \n \nDuring  construction,  civil  works  contractors  are  expected  to  provide  work  opportunities \n20. \nfor 2,500 local community residents. During operation, significant employment will be created for \nlocal  residents  in  the  offices  and  commercial  establishments.  In  addition,  about  900  staff, \nexpected to be mostly local, will be employed in the hotels and serviced apartments. \n \n21.  Measures to benefit women or facilitate their involvement in construction and operation \nof  the  project  were  incorporated  in  the  project  design  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nGender  and  Development  (1998).  The  overall  project  is  classified  as  having  some  gender \nelements,  and  Meeyahta  will  work  toward  incorporating  the  following  measures  in  the  project: \n(i) prioritize hiring of women for 40% of the jobs created in hospitality and retail; and (ii) conduct \nskills  training  programs  for  locally  hired  staff  in  hospitality  areas,  with  at  least  40%  of \nparticipants  to  be  women.  The  project  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to \nADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally \nrecognized  core  labor  standards.14 The  borrower  will  report  regularly  to  ADB  on  (i)  its  (and  its \ncontractors\u2019) compliance with such laws and (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and \nconsultation with affected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.15 \n\n                                                \n13 The sections on project description and implementation schedule in the Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) for \nthe current  project, dated February 2014, will be updated to reflect the  overall project's NFA and implementation \nschedule. The environmental and social management plan, included as part of the IEE,  is adequate to handle the \npotential  environment  and  social  impacts  during  construction  and  operation.  In  line  with  the  disclosure \nrequirements outlined in the Safeguard Policy Statement, the updated IEE will be disclosed on ADB's website. \n\n14 ADB. 2003. Social Protection.
