The Project will be \nopen to all eligible DMCs that might need emergency or additional \nsupport for the avian influenza epidemic.  \n \nThe  Project  has  four  components,  to  be  implemented  over  2.5 \nyears:  (i)  regional  capacity  building,  (ii)  regional  coordination,  (iii) \navian  influenza  response  facility,  and  (iv)  project  management. \nGiven  the  need  for  flexibility  and  rapid  response,  subprojects  will \nbe  developed  during  project  implementation  according  to  the \nneeds. \n \nThe Project, implemented in close coordination with other national \nand  international  initiatives,  will  improve  capacity  for  regional \nsurveillance  and  regional  and  national  response  to  emerging \ndiseases. \n \nThe  potential  impact  of  an  influenza  pandemic  is  substantial  and \ncould  halt  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Experts  fear \nthat  the  highly  pathogenic  avian  influenza  virus  A  H5N1  may \nmutate and cause a human influenza pandemic. All countries are \nat  risk.  Addressing  the  risk  or  at  least  reducing  the  potential \nimpact  of  an  influenza  pandemic  is  a  regional  public  good.  The \nProject  will contribute  to  overall  efforts  to combat  avian  influenza \nand  other  emerging  diseases.

The  Project  will \nhelp establish systems to prevent and control emerging diseases, \nwhich will be useful even if the epidemic does not escalate. \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  help  significantly  control  and  reduce  the \nspread of H5N1 avian influenza among poultry, and increase the \nregion's preparedness for a potential human influenza pandemic, \nthereby  preventing  or  mitigating  social  and  economic  disruptions \nin  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region.  This  will  be  achieved  by  helping \nDMCs  prevent  or  rapidly  control  infection-at-source  among  birds \nby  strengthening  systems  and  incentives  for  early  detection, \nreporting  and  controlling  avian  influenza  outbreaks,  and  rapidly \ncontaining and managing cases of human influenza caused by the \nH5N1  virus.  The  Project  will  also  help  prepare  the  region  for  a \npossible  pandemic  by \ninteragency \ncollaboration,  regional  cooperation  in  sharing  information,  and \nupgrading  of  national  capacities  through  strengthened  regional \nnetworks. \n \n \n\nsupporting \n\nregional \n\nComponent \nA.

An  avian  influenza  secretariat  to  administer  the \nProject will be established in the Gender, Social Development and \nCivil  Society  Division  of  the  Regional  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment.  \n \nADB,  acting  through  the  avian  influenza  secretariat,  will  be  the \nExecuting Agency for the Project. \n \nProcurement  by  international  organizations,  including  ASEAN, \nFAO,  and  WHO,  will  be  done  according  to  their  procurement \nto  ADB.  ADB  will  pay  standard  and \npolicies,  acceptable \nreasonable  administrative  charges  to  implementing  international \norganizations. Participating DMCs and ADB will identify a national \nimplementing  agency  (or  agencies)  for  procurement,  following \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  the  processes  outlined  in \nADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy.  Subject  to \nagreement  by  the  participating  DMCs  and  ADB,  international \nshopping procedures or local competitive bidding, with procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB,  may  be  used  for  contracts  of  $200,000  or \nmore, and direct purchase for contracts worth less than $200,000. \nTo  ensure  a  balance  between  protection  of  intellectual  property \nrights,  equity,  quality,  and  economy,  all  implementing  agencies \nwill  use  FAO  and  WHO  guidelines  (as  appropriate)  to  procure \npharmaceutical and laboratory products.  \n \nGiven  the  need  to  coordinate  closely  with  other  international \norganizations, to respond quickly to changing needs of the region, \nand to facilitate work with potential cofinanciers, the procurement \nof goods and services shall be open to suppliers in member and \nnonmember  countries,  subject  to  approval  by  the  Board  of \nDirectors. \n \nMost  consultants  will  be  contracted  by  participating  international \norganizations  or  by  participating  DMCs.  ADB  will  contract  \nconsultants for project administration and, if requested, may also \ncontract consultants directly for the use of DMCs and international \norganization.  The  Project  will  finance  an  estimated  651  person-\nmonths  of  consulting  services  through  components  1,  2,  and  4. \nAdditional  consultants  may  be  recruited  under  component  3. \nrecruitment \nInternational  organizations  will  use \ninternational \nprocedures,  acceptable \n\ntheir  own \nrecruit \n\nto  ADB, \n\nto \n\n\f \n\n \n\nv\n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries  \n\nis \n\nthis \n\nthreat.

Consultants  may  be \nrecruitment \nindividuals  and  firms  from  member  and  nonmember  countries, \nsubject to the approval by the Board of Directors. \n \nRegional Public Goods. Controlling avian influenza is a regional \npublic  good.  The  actions  of  individual  countries,  although  critical, \nare  not  sufficient  to  end  the  risk  that  avian  influenza  poses  to \nanimals  and  humans.  Only  by  cooperating  can  countries \nfocus  on \neffectively  combat \nstrengthening  the  regional  response  to  avian  influenza,  including \nreinforcing \ninformation  and \nexpertise, and facilitating risk pooling and stockpiling.  \n \nTechnical  Capacity  Building.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  the \nlong-term  strengthening  of \nthe  epidemiological  surveillance \nsystem  and  to  national  and  regional  preparedness  for  outbreaks \n(including \nof  zoonosis  and  other  communicable  diseases \ntraditional,  reemerging,  and  emerging  diseases).  The  Project  will \nsupport training in animal and human health, which will be useful \nafter the current outbreak of avian influenza.  \n \nSocial  Benefits.  Controlling  the  spread  of  avian  influenza  in \npoultry  flocks  will  significantly  improve  the  welfare  of  rural \nhouseholds  in  the  region.  The  epidemic  is  harming  small-scale \npoultry  farmers  and  threatens  the  livelihoods  of  many  poor  and \nnear-poor  households.  Reducing  the  risk  of  the  further  spread  of \nthe  disease  through  improved  farming  methods  and  biosecurity, \nand  helping  establish  sustainable  schemes  to  compensate  and \nassist  small-scale  and  backyard  poultry  owners  will  help  mitigate \nthe negative impact of avian influenza. A related human influenza \npandemic would slow down poverty reduction. The livelihoods and \nhealth  of  poor  households  would  be  most  at  risk.  The  poor  have \nlimited  access  to  the  health  system  and  would  probably  delay \nusing health services, which might result in a more severe illness \nthat could send them deeper into poverty. Therefore, prevention of \na human influenza epidemic will more than proportionately benefit \nthe poor.  \n \nEconomic  Benefits.  The  Project,  in  coordination  with  other \nglobal,  regional,  and  national  initiatives,  will  lower  the  probability \nof  an  H5N1-related  pandemic  occurring  and  will  minimize  the \neconomic impact if one does occur. Estimates show that the cost \nof  such  a  pandemic  would  be  $100  billion\u2013$300  billion  for  Asia \nand the Pacific region (excluding Japan).  \n \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  regional  cooperation,  transparency, \nexchange  of  information,  expertise,  and  response  capacity. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nvi \n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nfoster \n\nregional \n\ntrust  and  cooperation  will  help \n\nIncreased \nintegration and economic growth.  \n \nEpidemiological  Uncertainty.  H5N1  avian  influenza  remains  a \nzoonosis  (an  animal  disease  that  may  affect  humans),  affecting \npoultry and wild birds but rarely transmitted to humans. The three \ninfluenza  pandemics  of  the  20th  century  also  originated  among \nbirds, caused by an avian virus that mutated into a virus that was \ntransmitted  efficiently  among  humans.  There  is  no  certainty  that \nthis will occur with the H5N1 virus, although experts believe that a \npandemic\u2014caused  by  a  mutated  H5N1  or  another  strain  of \ninfluenza  virus\u2014is  inevitable.  Influenza  pandemics  can  vary \nwidely  in  virulence  and  efficiency  in  spreading  among  humans. \nThey may affect different age groups differently. The efforts of the \nProject  to  control  H5N1  influenza  may  appear  ineffective  if  this \nparticular virus never mutates into a human virus or if the related \nhuman  influenza  pandemic  is  mild.  The  Project  however  will \nstrengthen  regional  cooperation  and  health  systems  and  better \nprepare  the  region  for  emerging  or  reemerging  communicable \ndiseases.  \n \nDonor  Coordination.  Because  the  threat  of  a  human  influenza \npandemic  is  global,  interest  is  growing  in  supporting  measures \nagainst  H5N1  avian  influenza.  Many  bilateral  and  multilateral \nagencies  have  offered  assistance  to  governments,  which  also \ndevelop their own initiatives. Given these multiple partners, efforts \nmight be duplicated and governments may not have the capacity \nto manage the offered assistance. The Project\u2019s primary goal is to \ndeveloping \nimprove \npreparedness  plans  and  surveillance,  to  allow  countries  to  take \nfull advantage of global support.  \n \nLow Demand. Avian influenza is a major concern of governments \nthroughout  the  world.  However,  they  may  lose  interest  as  the \nH5N1 virus evolves or as some other event takes center stage. As \na result, ADB may commit significant resources and not be able to \nreallocate  them  to  other  priorities.  In  designing  the  Project,  ADB \nhas  shown  significant  flexibility  and  it  would  be  able  to  quickly \nadjust  the  Project.  The  Project  is  short,  which  assures  the  quick \nreturn of unused funds for other uses. \n\ncoordination, \n\nincluding \n\nregional \n\nin \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  the  proposed  \ngrants  to  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  Secretariat,  the  Food  and \nAgriculture  Organization  of  the  United  Nations  (FAO),  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO), \nand participating developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor the Prevention and Control of Avian Influenza in Asia and the Pacific Project. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nAvian influenza A H5N12 poses a major development challenge to Asia and the Pacific \n2. \nregion.  This  highly  pathogenic  virus  has  infected  poultry  in  many  Asian  countries  and  has \nbecome  endemic  in  large  parts  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  Indonesia,  and  Viet \nNam. The virus has now been detected in birds and humans in Turkey and has spread to parts \nof Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia.  Experts believe that the virus could mutate \nor reassort and develop a new subtype that is easily transmittable among humans, leading to an \ninfluenza  pandemic.  Every  case  of  animal-to-human  transmission  gives  the  virus  another \nchance to mutate into a human-to-human transmissible virus.  \n \nWHO  uses  a  series  of  six  phases  of  pandemic  alert  to  classify  the  seriousness  of  the \n3. \nthreat  and  to  determine  whether  to  launch  progressively  more  intense  control  and  prevention \nactivities. Determining the phases and deciding when to move from one phase to another may \nbe triggered by several factors, including the epidemiological characteristics of the disease and \nthe  circulating  influenza  viruses.  As  of  1  March  2006,  the  world  has  been  in  phase  3:  a  new \ninfluenza virus against which humans have no immunity is circulating, but it is not yet spreading \nfrom  humans  to  humans.  WHO  considers  the  world  to  be  the  closest  to  a  global  influenza \npandemic since 1968.3 \n \n4. \nThe region faces three types of threats from H5N1 influenza. First, the virus is already \nendemic  and  virulent  in  poultry  in  many  countries,  putting  at  risk  the  poultry  industry  and  the \nlivelihoods  of  many  small-scale  producers.  Second,  the  health  of  poultry  workers  and  their \nfamilies is at risk. It is difficult for humans to contract avian influenza in its current form, and the \nnumber of reported human cases has been low and mostly confined to those in close contact \nwith poultry. However, once contracted, avian influenza has proven highly dangerous: about half \nthe people reported to be infected have died. Third, the H5N1 virus could mutate into a form that \nis  easily  transmissible  among  humans,  creating  a  pandemic  that  would  put  at  risk  the  lives  of \nmillions of people across the globe and halt the region\u2019s economic progress.  \n \n5. \nIn  response  to  this  mounting  threat  and  to  growing  requests  for  support  from  DMCs, \nADB has entered into partnership with ASEAN, FAO, and WHO to develop a flexible and urgent \nresponse.  The  Project  will  support  regional  activities  to  contain  the  spread  of  avian  influenza \n                                                 \n1  Support  for  the  preparation  of  this  Project  was  provided  by  RETA  6108  (ADB.  2003.

It will complement country-level support. The major outbreaks \namong birds and all human cases to date have occurred in Asia. Controlling the outbreaks will \nhelp protect populations in Asia and the Pacific region and beyond.  \n \n6. \nPrevention of avian and human influenza is a public good. No country, on its own, can \ncombat  its  spread.  Migratory  birds  are  carriers  of  the  disease  and  may  infect  domestic  birds, \nraising  the  risk  of  the  virus  reappearing  where  it  has  been  eliminated.  Migratory  flocks  can \nspread  the  virus  widely  and  have  carried  it  to  Africa,  Central  Asia,  Europe,  and  South  Asia. \nCountries  are  closely  interlinked  through  globalization  and  cannot  shut  down  their  borders  to \npotential carriers of human influenza. Thus, all countries have an interest in ensuring that each \ncountry can respond suitably and effectively.  \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nBackground \n\n7. \nSocial  and  Economic  Impact.  In  the  past  2  years,  avian  influenza  has  affected  birds \nthroughout Asia, significantly dislocating the poultry sector. In the Mekong subregion alone, the \noutbreak is estimated to have cost about $580 million through March 2005, excluding the loss \ncaused  by  trade  restrictions.4 FAO  has  estimated  the  total  cost  of  the  outbreak  at  around  $10 \nbillion.5 Many  countries  have  had  to  cull  large  numbers  of  poultry  to  control  the  spread  of  the \nvirus. Poultry is a major source of income and nutrition for many rural households in Asia. The \nloss of poultry to disease and culling has pushed many families into poverty. The international \ntrade  in  poultry  products  has  been  greatly  harmed  and  the  exports  from  a  number  of  major \npoultry-raising countries severely reduced.  \n \n8. \nHuman  Impact.  As  of  1  March  2006,  WHO  confirmed  174  human  cases,  with  94 \nfatalities.6 Humans  primarily  contract  avian  influenza  from  close  and  direct  contact  with  birds \n(mostly  poultry),  with  few  confirmed  cases  of  human-to-human  transmission. 7 Although  the \nH5N1  virus  would  have  to  mutate  or  recombine  with  existing  human  influenza  viruses  to \nfacilitate  human-to-human  transmission,  experts  are  worried  about  the  high  mortality  rate  in \nhumans  and  the  virus\u2019  efficiency  in  spreading  among  different  bird  populations.  Appendix  2 \noutlines the epidemiology of influenza and its impact on human health.  \n \n\n2. \n\nHuman Influenza Pandemic \n\n9. \nHistorical  Context.  Influenza  is  highly  contagious  and  spreads  easily  across  borders \namong  humans.  Seasonal  influenza  is  a  common  disease  affecting  a  large  number  of  people \nevery year. The mortality rate tends to be low, with mainly the very young, the elderly, and other \nvulnerable populations at risk. Still, in a typical year, 600,000 to 1.5 million die worldwide from \nseasonal influenza. Humans develop immunity against the virus, and vaccines are available, but \nthe virus changes slightly every year and the vaccine needs to be adapted. Every year, WHO, \nwith the assistance of collaborating centers, defines the content of the annual vaccine, using the \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB. 2005.

Avian Flu A (H5N1) Infection in Humans. New England Journal of Medicine. 353: 1374\u20131385.  \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nmost likely strains of the virus in the following influenza season. Periodically, a completely new \nstrain  appears,  against  which  the  annual  vaccine  will  not  protect.  The  influenza  outbreaks \ncaused  by  new  strains  are  often  more  virulent,  with  a  higher  case  fatality  rate.  Developing, \nproducing, and distributing a vaccine against a new strain normally takes 4 to 6 months.  \n \n10. \nThe 20th century saw three influenza pandemics, in 1918\u20131919, 1957\u20131958, and 1968\u2013\n1969. The 1918\u20131919 pandemic, commonly called the \u201cSpanish flu\u201d was one of the worst health \ncatastrophes  ever.  An  estimated  50  million  to  100  million  people  died,  representing  a  fatality \nrate of 2.5% to 5.0%.8 This rate was unusually high because of several factors, at the end of the \nFirst World War, including the (i) poor public health conditions, (ii) low nutritional levels, (iii) large \nmovements  of  populations  as  troops  were  demobilized,  and  (iv).lack  of  medication  to  treat \nsecondary  bacterial  infections  (antibiotics  were only  released  on  the  pharmaceutical  market  in \n1939). The two other influenza pandemics killed substantially fewer people, about 1 million to 3 \nmillion  people.  All  three  influenza  pandemics,  generally  believed  to  have  originated  in  Asia, \nwere caused by mutated or recombined avian viruses. \n \nConsequences of a Pandemic. It is not possible to predict how and when an influenza \n11. \nvirus will mutate and how virulent the new strain will be. It appears difficult for human to catch \nH5N1  from  animal-to-human  transmission  as  relatively  few  people  have  been  infected. \nHowever, each human infection give the virus the opportunity to mutate (as happened with the \nSpanish  flu)  or  recombine  with  seasonal  human  influenza  virus  strains  (as  happened  with  the \nother two pandemics), and thereby spread more easily among humans. Although it is difficult to \npredict  the  virulence  of  a  new  human-to-human  transmissible  influenza  virus,  WHO  estimates \nthat from 2 million to 7 million people could die worldwide from an influenza pandemic. This is \nequivalent to a mortality rate of 0.03% to 0.12% and is the basis for planning in many countries. \nHowever, others point to the high pathogenicity of the H5N1 virus and project a mortality of 180 \nmillion to 360 million (mortality rates of 3% to 6%) or even higher.9  \n \nThe  world  has  changed  significantly  since  the  last  pandemic  in  1968.  Economies  are \n12. \nmuch  more  interlinked,  information  flows  more  freely,  and  the  movement  of  people  has \nincreased dramatically. The world is much more vulnerable to economic shocks. The outbreak \nof SARS10 in 2003, for example, ultimately infected only some 8,000 people, with a case fatality \nrate of around 10%, concentrated in a few, mostly Asian, countries. Because of the strong world \nreaction, however, several economies were severely affected. The region lost around $18 billion \nin economic output.11 Since the actual health consequences were minimal, this cost was largely \ncaused by the outbreak\u2019s psychological impact on demand. The public\u2019s reaction to outbreaks of \nfoot-and-mouth  disease \n(bovine  spongiform  encephalopathy)  and \nmad  cow  disease \ndemonstrate a marked tendency to overreact to public health threats.  \n \n13. \nThe impact  of an influenza pandemic would be even  worse. Using the SARS outbreak \nas  a  model,  an  ADB  study  has  estimated  that  an  outbreak  consistent  with  the  WHO  baseline \ncould  cost  the  region  $297  billion  in  1  year  and  would  throw  the  world  into  economic \nrecession.12 This is largely because consumption would slow down; trade of services, including \n\n                                                 \n8  Barry,  J.  2005.  1918  Revisited:  Lessons  and  Suggestions  for  Further  in  Inquiry.

This  type  of  outbreak  would  lead  to  around  3  million \ndeaths in Asia, the equivalent of 45.6 million life years lost, causing lost income of $267 billion. \nAnother 20.8 million life years would be lost because of temporary incapacity. If the international \ncommunity can contain the panic, the economic consequences would be substantially reduced.  \n \n\n3. \n\nStrategy for Combating Avian and Human Influenza \n\n14. \nGovernments and development partners agree that the rapid control and containment of \navian  influenza  should  remain  a  global  priority.  To  coordinate  the  response  to  this  emerging \nchallenge, a number of high-level international meetings have been held. A major meeting took \nplace in WHO headquarters in Geneva on 7\u20139 November 2005, with representatives from most \nWHO  member  countries,  bilateral  donors,  and  international  agencies.  The  meeting  identified \npriority interventions to control avian influenza and improve preparedness for a possible human \ninfluenza pandemic. \n \n15. \nContaining  Infection  at  Source.  There  is  wide  agreement  that  the  best  strategy  to \nprevent  a  pandemic  is  to  contain  the  threat  at  source,  when  it  still  affects  mainly  the  bird \npopulations.  This  involves  (i)  enhancing  biosecurity  in  the  poultry  sector  to  prevent  new \ninfections of birds, (ii) timely notification and verification of avian influenza outbreaks in domestic \nand  wild  birds,  and  (iii)  rapid  containment  through  culling  and  vaccination.  In  the  long  term, \ncountries in the region should improve the safety of poultry farming and marketing. In the short \nterm,  early  warning  and  surveillance  systems  for  animal  diseases  are  critical.  With  livestock \nfarmers,  especially  in  backyard  poultry  farming,  at  the  frontline,  providing  appropriate \ncompensation  is  an  important  incentive  to  ensure  their  active  participation.  Transparent  and \nimmediate  reporting  by  authorities  is  essential,  as  is  the  sharing  of  virus  samples  to  rapidly \nidentify the virus subtype and prepare a human vaccine. \n \n16. \nPreparing for a Human Influenza Pandemic. While working on the primary strategy of \nminimizing the threat at source, countries and international partners also committed to prevent \nor delay13 a human influenza pandemic. This requires coordinated national, regional, and global \nefforts  to  quickly  detect  mutations  of  the  circulating  avian  influenza  viruses  and  to  limit  the \noutbreaks. The international community identified five key strategic actions:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nReduce  human  exposure  to  the  H5N1  virus  through  risk  communication  and \nstrengthened collaboration between animal and human health services. \nStrengthen  an  early  warning  system  by  supporting  systems  for  sensitive \nlaboratory  confirmation,  real-time  risk  assessments,  and \ndetection,  rapid \nimmediate communication. \nIntensify  rapid  containment  measures  by  supporting  rapid  field  investigation, \ncontact  tracing  and  monitoring,  stringent  infection  control,  and  intervention  with \ninternational  stockpile  following  the  first  signs  that  the  virus  is  transmitting  from \nhumans to humans. \nBuild capacity to cope with a pandemic by developing national plans, testing and \nrehearsing them, and developing the capacity to implement them. \nAccelerate  vaccine  development  and  expand  production  capacity  by  enhancing \ncoordination  with  the  pharmaceutical  industry,  strengthening  real-time  scientific \ndata,  accessing  global  expertise,  and  providing  incentives  to  the  industry  to \nproduce sufficient quantities of vaccines. \n\n                                                 \n13  Delaying or slowing down the spread of a pandemic will save millions of lives by buying time to develop a vaccine. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n4. \n\nRegional and National Needs  \n\n17. \nAvian influenza has already had a  significant economic impact, and a pandemic would \nseverely tax the capacity of most public health systems in the region. To control the spread of \navian influenza and to prevent and mitigate a pandemic, significant new national, regional, and \nglobal resources are needed (Appendix 3).  \n \n18. \nRegional technical agencies need to be strengthened so that they can effectively support \ncountries in the current pre-pandemic stage. Greater regional cooperation is needed in sharing \ninformation  and  training,  and  strengthening  networks  for  epidemiological  surveillance  and \nlaboratory testing. If a pandemic breaks out, national and regional emergency response teams \nand stockpiles of essential drugs and equipment will be needed. After an outbreak, countries will \nneed support for recovery.  \n \n19. \nIn  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region,  largely  corresponding  to  ADB\u2019s  DMCs,  FAO  has \nestimated  an  unmet  need  of  around  $18.6  million  for  regional  activities  and  $29.0  million  for \nsupport  to  regional  reference  laboratories.  WHO  has  estimated  regional  needs  of about  $37.0 \nmillion for human health activities. These estimates exclude global activities. Since most of the \ncases of avian influenza (in birds and humans) have been in the region, a large part of global \nsupport will likely directly benefit it.  \n \n20. \nEstimations of national demand for resources are still speculative, as the spread of avian \ninfluenza is still not clear. The World Bank has estimated that countries in East and South Asia \nwill  need  around  $711  million  and  have  an  internal  capacity  to  finance  30%  to  50%  of  this \namount.  Central  Asia  will  likely  need  around  $45  million  and  could  finance  $10  million  to  $15 \nmillion. These figures probably underestimate the needs of the health sector and perhaps also \nthe needs of the animal health system in a country where avian influenza becomes endemic.  \n \n\n5. \n\nInternational Response  \n\n21. \nGovernments  and  international  organizations  have  committed  significant  technical  and \nfinancial resources to fight avian influenza among birds and to prevent or halt its spread among \nhumans.  Appendix  4  outlines  international  support  for  fighting  avian  and  human  influenza. \nInternational  agencies  are  developing  global,  regional,  and  national  financing  and  monitoring \nframeworks.  In  January  2006,  a  major  conference  was  held  in  Beijing  to  pledge  support  for \nglobal, regional, and national pandemic preparedness plans.  \n \n22. \nAt  the  Beijing  conference,  development  partners  pledged  about  $1.9  billion,  including \nsupport that has been disbursed and support that is in the pipeline. Some of the support is from \nmultilateral financing agencies such as ADB, the World Bank, and the European Commission, \nand  from  bilateral  sources,  including  development  agencies  and  national  technical  agencies, \nsuch  as  the  Center  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  of  the  United  States  and  France's \nPasteur Institutes.  \n \n\na. \n\nInternational and Regional Organizations \n\n23. \nAsian  Development  Bank.  ADB  has  been  active  in  the  health  sector  in  a  number  of \ncountries in Asia and the Pacific region, including by supporting national and regional efforts to \ncontrol communicable diseases and by strengthening health surveillance and food safety. ADB \nhas pledged about $470 million for avian influenza prevention and control, including $68 million \nin  grants,  in  two  regional  projects  (including  $10  million  cofinancing  from  the  Government  of \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nJapan).  ADB  has  also  offered  about  $400  million  in  loans.  The  loan  amount  includes \nrestructuring  existing  loans  to  save  money  and  expedite  new  loans.  The  grant  projects  are \nlargely  for  regional  activities  although  they  do  finance  some  national  activities.  ADB  has  a \nnumber of ongoing projects and activities that will support efforts to control avian influenza.  \n \nThe Greater Mekong subregion14 has been the center of the outbreak of avian influenza \n24. \nand  is  the  focus  of  much  of  ADB\u2019s  attention.  The  Communicable  Disease  Control  (CDC) \nProject 15 is  a  key  regional  initiative.  It  focuses  on  improving  regional  coordination  and  the \nprovision  of  regional  public  goods.  It  supports  disease  control,  strengthens  laboratories,  and \nfocuses on controlling avian influenza. \n \n25.  World  Bank.  In  partnership  with  FAO  and  WHO,  the  World  Bank  leads  donor \ncoordination and resource mobilization. Its initial estimates of financial needs have been used to \nsolicit donor assistance. It established a finance facility that will offer concessionary or market-\nbased lending to countries, depending on country eligibility. This $500 million facility, approved \nin  January  2006,  will  serve  as  the  main  source  of  funds.  The  World  Bank  is in  the  process  of \nestablishing  a  multi-donor  trust  fund  to  provide  grant  assistance.  The  fund  has  received \ncommitments  from the European Commission and several other development partners.  \n \n26. \nFood  and  Agricultural  Organization  and  World  Organization  for  Animal  Health \n(OIE).  FAO  and  OIE  are  working  together  to  control  avian  influenza,  containing  infection  at \nsource  through  progressive  control  of  H5N1  avian  influenza  and  its  eradication  from  poultry \nflocks in Asia. Immediate actions include preparing emergency plans and establishing regional \nnetworks on surveillance, diagnostic, and disease information. Control measures include culling, \nbiosecurity, quarantine, and movement control, combined with strategic vaccination of domestic \npoultry.  FAO\u2019s  medium-term  strategy  is  to  help  countries  establish  disease-free  zones, \nprogressively  confine  the  disease  to  defined  areas,  and  ultimately  eradicate  the  disease  from \nremaining compartments of infected domestic poultry in the region by promoting healthy farming \npractices, wide-scale vaccination in the predominantly commercial and backyard poultry sectors, \nand strict post-vaccination monitoring.  \n \n27.  World  Health  Organization.  WHO  is  focusing  on  mitigating  the  impact  of  avian \ninfluenza  on  human  health  and  preventing  a  pandemic.  WHO  has  advocated  influenza \npandemic preparedness planning for all countries and recommended increased surveillance of \nthe H5N1 virus. Before the pandemic, interventions should aim to gather better intelligence on \nthe H5N1 virus, particularly on mutations in the virus genome and changes in the epidemiology \nof influenza outbreaks that may signal increased transmissibility of the virus. If an influenza virus \ncauses  a  pandemic  (a  new  strain  highly  transmissible  among  humans),  WHO's  strategy  will \ncontain  or  delay  the  spread  of  the  virus  at  the  source. 16 If  a  pandemic  begins,  WHO  will \ncoordinate  international  actions  to  reduce  morbidity,  mortality,  and  social  disruption.  WHO  is \nsupporting pre-pandemic research to guide response measures. It is working closely with FAO \nand  OIE  to  coordinate  activities  and  technical  advice.  It  is  also  promoting  risk  communication \nstrategies. \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n14 Cambodia,  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  Myanmar,  Thailand,  Viet  Nam,  and  Yunnan  Province  and  the \n\nGuangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the PRC.  \n\n15 ADB.  2005.

ASEAN members17 have been at the center \n28. \nof the avian influenza epidemic. The ASEAN Secretariat is developing its capacity to coordinate \na regional response to public health threats. It is supporting efforts to share information on avian \ninfluenza and is working with development partners to improve regional coordination.   \n \n\nb. \n\nCountry Responses \n\n29. \nFAO, WHO, and other technical agencies emphasize that all countries and regions must \ndevelop  comprehensive  plans  that  integrate  interventions  related  to  animal  and  human  health \nand  strengthen  surveillance  systems  and  response  mechanisms.  Countries  should  also \nconsider  possible  disruptions  to  essential  services  in  case  of  a  pandemic.  These  plans  can \nbecome  the  basis  for  coordinated  financial  and  technical  support  from  bilateral  donors  and \ninternational agencies. \n \n30. \nAlthough most countries in Asia and the Pacific region have plans to prevent a pandemic \nby  containing  avian  influenza  among  poultry,  and  to  manage  a  influenza  pandemic  if \ncontainment fails, the plans\u2019 quality and realism vary greatly. As recommended by the technical \nagencies, most of these plans have been prepared jointly by ministries of health and agriculture. \nCapacities to implement the plans also vary greatly. Most plans are not adequately resourced \nand most countries need more support to refine their strategies and to develop the technical and \nlogistical capacity to implement them.  \n \n31. \nRegional Support. Japan is supporting national and regional initiatives directly through \nbilateral support and through a number of international and regional organizations. In particular, \nJapan  is  helping  establish  regional  stockpiles  for  antiviral  drugs  and  protective  personal \nequipment. It is providing $10 million to ADB to support regional activities, and $5 million to the \nWorld  Bank  for  its  grant  facility.  Japan  is  directly  supporting  FAO  and  WHO  and  is  also \nproviding  significant  support  to  UNICEF 18 /WHO  in  the  area  of  community-based  risk \ncommunication. In total, Japan has contributed around $135 million. Beyond its commitment to \nshare  information  with  the  international  community,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  has  pledged \n$10 million, mainly to support neighboring countries. Australia is providing around $75 million at \nthe national and regional levels.  \n \n32. \nEurope. The European Union member states have been active in international support \nagainst  avian  influenza.  The  European  Commission  is  planning  to  provide  \u20ac80  million  to  the \nWorld Bank\u2019s grant facility, of which \u20ac35 million is destined for Asian countries (including Central \nAsia)  and  \u20ac20  million  for  vaccine  research  and  development.  Individually,  member  states  are \npledging a total of $260 million for national, regional, and global support. A significant part of the \nEuropean countries' assistance will be allocated through international organizations.  \n \nNorth America. The United States is the largest single contributor, with commitments of \n33. \n$334 million to fight avian influenza nationally,  regionally, and globally. This includes research \nand  development,  and  support  to  improve  animal  and  human  health,  offered  by  a  variety  of \ngovernment departments and agencies. Canada, the only non-Asian country that was affected \nby SARS, is contributing around $30 million, focused largely on Asia. \n \n\n                                                 \n17 Brunei,  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  Malaysia,  Myanmar,  Singapore,  Thailand,  and \n\nViet Nam. All members, except Brunei, are also ADB members.  \n\n18 United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Challenges and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Challenges \n\nHealth  experts  think  that  the  world  is  at  the  greatest  risk  now  of  a  human  influenza \n34. \npandemic  since  1968.  Although  it  is  not  clear  that  the  current  H5N1  will  lead  to  the  next \npandemic,  it  does  appear  to  be  only  a  matter  of  time  before  a  new  influenza  virus  emerges. \nCoordinated  action  is  needed  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  the  avian  influenza  outbreaks  and \nprevent a pandemic from this dangerous subtype.  \n \n\na. \n\nLimited Government Surveillance Capacity  \n\nTracking  and  diagnosing  diseases  require  established  field  and  laboratory  systems. \n35. \nLocal  capacity  is  needed  to  monitor  infectious  diseases  among  animals  and  humans.  This  is \nlikely to be the responsibility of different agencies. Laboratories need to have adequate systems \nto  collect,  transport,  and  test  specimens,  and  they  require  adequate  biosafety  and  waste \ndisposal  systems.  Most  developing  countries  have  only  limited  resources  for  epidemiological \nand laboratory surveillance and response, and public health is largely under-funded. Countries \nwill  need  significant  support  from  international  organizations  to  strengthen  their  animal  and \nhuman health systems.  \n \n\nb. \n\n Evolving Regional Cooperation \n\n36. \nOne  of  the  major  lessons  from  the  SARS  outbreak  is  the  importance  of  regional \ncooperation  in  public  health.  The  countries  of  Asia  and  the  Pacific  Region  have  committed \nthemselves to strengthen the exchange of information and to coordinate public health activities. \nHowever, this is a relatively new area and there is little experience on how to organize regional \ncooperation in the health sector. International organizations have generally focused on country-\nlevel  activities  but  do  have  some  experience  in  this  area.  Strengthening  their  capacity  will \nrequire additional resources and support.   \n \n\nc. \n\nUncertain Nature of the Threat \n\n37. \nAvian  influenza  has  already  done  significant  harm  to  the  region\u2019s  poultry  industry. \nHowever, the course of the H5N1 virus is uncertain. Although the H5N1 virus has proved to be \nhighly  virulent  for  humans,  it  does  not  spread  easily  among  humans  in  its  present  form.  The \nappearance,  through  mutations  or  reassortment,  of  a  new  influenza  virus  easily  transmissible \namong humans and thus causing a new pandemic, is considered likely, and H5N1 is a serious \ncandidate. But the time frame for such transformation is difficult to predict. The epidemiological \nproperties  of  this  new  pandemic  strain  cannot  be  known,  which  makes  it  difficult  to  design  an \nadequate public health response. National health systems may overreact and over prepare, or \nfind that they are overwhelmed by the virus.  \n \n38. \nAuthorities  need  to  pursue  a  dual  strategy  to  prevent  mutation  or  reassortment  of  the \nH5N1  virus  and,  at  the  same  time,  to  prepare  for  a  human  influenza  pandemic.  Regional \norganizations  can  play  an  important  role  in  planning  and  coordination,  training  and  capacity \nbuilding, and stockpiling of critical commodities.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nd. \n\nLow Preparedness for a Pandemic \n\n39. \nHealth systems in the region are unprepared for a pandemic. Health workers will need \nadequate protection (protective gear, vaccination). A large portion of the population may need to \nbe  vaccinated.  Sick  people  should  receive  antiviral  treatments  such  as  oseltamivir  (Tamiflu\u00ae), \nand  antibiotics  to  treat  secondary  infections.  For  most  cases,  specialized  equipment  (such  as \nventilators)  will  be  needed.  Many  Asian  countries  have  underinvested  in  health,  and  public \nspending  on  health  is  lower  than  in  other  regions.  The  last human  influenza  pandemic  was  in \n1968 and the last severe pandemic was in 1918. As a result, health workers, especially at the \nlocal level, at the frontline, have limited experience with influenza pandemics, and training lags \nin many countries.  \n \nInternational  organizations  can  play  an  important  role  in  coordinating  activities  and \n40. \nplanning for a pandemic. Exchange of information, materials and experience, harmonization of \npublic health measures, and regional training activities will be essential to control a pandemic. \nCoordination is important because a pandemic will spread quickly across borders. Procurement \ncan be facilitated regionally for some goods and supplies. Medications and vaccines often have \nsignificant  economies  of  scale,  and  pooling  orders  may  substantially  reduce  the  cost. \nEstablishing  regional  stockpiles  also  makes  economic  sense  as  it  allows  countries  to  pool \nlimited resources to establish a system of rapid response to a human influenza outbreak. \n \n\ne. \n\nAppropriate Incentives for Farmers \n\n41.  When  combined  with  other  measures,  culling  diseased  flocks  plays  a  major  role  in \npreventing the spread of avian influenza at its source. Culling has significant benefits for society \nbut  a  high  cost  for  farmers,  giving  them  little  incentive  to  participate  voluntarily.  Governments \nmay  try  to  force  culling,  but  farmers  often  attempt  to  subvert  it  by  hiding  part  of  their  flock  or \nslaughtering poultry before the cull.  \n \n42. \nEstablishing  appropriate  and  adequate  compensation  for  farmers  is  complex.  Planners \nmust carefully weigh the incentives that they are creating through the compensation mechanism. \nA  system  that  it  is  too  generous  will  encourage  excessive  culling  and  encourage  farmers  to \nrestock  their  farms  too  quickly  in  hope  of  additional  payments.  However,  if  payments  are  not \nsufficient, the system will have limited impact.  \n \n43.  Many  countries  lack  systems  to  accurately  register  and  map  farms  and  conduct  an \nadequate poultry census. Governance issues and the limited capacity of animal health services \nalso  limit  the  capacity  to  set  up  a  compensation  system.  The  resources  needed  are  likely  to \nexceed  what  is  available  in  most  countries,  even  with  significant  international  support. \nSupplementary Appendix A discusses the issue of compensation in greater detail.  \n \n\nf. \n\nInformation Gap \n\n44. \nProper  communication,  including  timely  and  accurate  reporting  of  new  outbreaks,  is \nessential  to  control  an  epidemic.  One  key  lesson  from  the  SARS  outbreak  of  2003  was  the \nimportance of managing information. The public and even health care providers lacked correct \ninformation.  Information  was  not  shared  openly  and  transparently  with  the  public  or  with  the \ninternational community, which led many to overreact. \n \n45. \nRisk  communication  requires  special  attention.  The  public  needs  clear,  regular,  and \nreliable  information  to  understand  governments'  efforts  to  control  outbreaks  and  to  prevent \n\n \n\n\fpanic.  Civil  society,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  other  community  groups  can  help \nfacilitate the flow of information and should be closely involved. The risk communication strategy \nshould  aim  appropriate  messages  at  different  groups,  including  farmers  and  poultry  workers, \nhealth  workers,  animal  health  workers,  public  officers,  and  the  public.  Providing  accurate \ninformation, in appropriate language, is a public good and one that will likely require government \nintervention.  The  international  community  can  support  national  governments  with  accurate \ninformation and recommendations on how to craft a risk communication campaign.  \n \n\n2. \n\nStrategic Context \n\n46. \nAvian  influenza  directly  threatens  economic  growth,  a  key  determinant  of  poverty \nreduction. Economic analysis shows that in the short run, growth in East and South Asia would \nlikely be halted during a pandemic and many countries would go into recession. Beyond this, a \npandemic  would  shake  the  confidence  of  local  and  international  investors,  which  could  cause \nlong-term economic harm. A pandemic may reverse the accumulation of human capital, which \nwould  hinder  long-term  poverty  reduction.  It  would  strain  weak  social  protection  and  health \nsystems in most countries. \n \n47. \nThe  avian  influenza  epidemic  has  important  regional  implications.  Without  cooperation, \nthe efforts of any individual country are likely to be ineffective. ADB is committed to promoting \nregional  cooperation  and  developing  regional  public  goods.  ADB  is  well  placed  to  support  a \nregional response because of its presence in the region, access to regional networks, ability to \nprovide  and  mobilize  significant  financing,  and  experience  with  similar  issues.  Institutional \nstructures  for  surveillance  and  response  and  disaster  management  in  the  DMCs  of  the  region \nneed to be strengthened. The region will continue to face a risk from avian influenza as well as \nother health threats with increasing frequency. \n \nC. \n\nRationale for a Regional Approach \n\nADB  will  help  member  countries  respond  to  the  challenge  of  avian  influenza  by \n\n48. \nsupporting regional activities. The rationale for a regional approach is as follows: \n \n\n1. \n\nDisease Prevention and Control as Public Good \n\n49. \nInvesting in public health and disease prevention generates many positive externalities \nand has many characteristics of a public good. Disease prevention and control benefit the entire \npopulation and, for many interventions, it is not possible to restrict the benefits or to charge the \nbeneficiaries. The market, on its own, will not provide the optimal level of public health services, \nwhich is why public intervention is strongly justified. \n \nEach  country  can  individually  take  action,  but  the  influenza  virus  can  easily  cross \n50. \nborders  even  with  a  sophisticated  national  response.  Countries  benefit  from  coordinating \nsurveillance and response activities to ensure that capacity is good throughout the region. If one \ncountry lacks capacity, it will undermine the efforts of other countries. Regionally, all countries \nbenefit  from  coordinating  and  establishing  a  set  of  common  standards  for  activities  such  as \nculling  diseased  flocks,  quarantining  sick  individuals,  and  informing  the  public  (communication \nstrategy).  This  justifies  a  regional  response,  coordinated  and  financed  through  regional  and \ninternational organizations, to help countries protect public health. \n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n2. \n\nRisk Pooling \n\n11\n\n51. \nThe course of avian influenza is highly uncertain. Many experts expect a pandemic, but \ndo  not  know  when,  where,  and  how  severe  it  will  be.  Over  the  last  three  centuries,  there  has \nbeen  a  pandemic  about  every  30  years.  Each  has  been  different  in  duration,  severity,  and \nvulnerable  population.  Preparing  for  a  pandemic  that  may  not  materialize  is  expensive, \nespecially  for  poor  countries,  and  is  likely  to  include stockpiling of  antiviral  drugs  (for  mortality \nreduction  and  for  prophylaxis),  personal  protective  equipment  (masks,  gloves,  etc.),  vaccines, \nand laboratory equipment and supplies.  \n \n52.  Working  together  regionally,  countries  can  pool  stockpiles  and  use  them  when  and \nwhere they are needed most. As under an insurance scheme, instead of each country having a \nlarge stockpile, a regional stockpile can be placed in one or more central locations and be made \navailable  as  needed.  This  requires  a  clear  set  of  criteria  for  accessing  it.  A  quick  decision-\nmaking structure is needed, as is a strong logistical system to ensure the safe storage and rapid \ndelivery  of  goods.  International  technical  agencies,  particularly  WHO,  are  studying  the  most \nappropriate stockpiling mechanisms. \n  \n\n3. \n\nReduced Transaction Costs and Economies of Scale \n\nThrough  regional  actions,  countries  can  reduce  the  transaction  costs  of  many  key \n53. \nactivities.  Health  surveillance  will  be  enhanced  if  the  systems  can  feed  into  each  other  and \nprovide advanced warning. Regional training is more economical than national training as larger \ngroups can be covered. This is especially important for specific areas of knowledge where each \ncountry  might  need  only  a  few  specialists.  Training  of  trainers  can  be  enhanced  through \nexchanges  to  allow  staff  to  see  what  works  and  what  does  not  work  in  neighboring  countries. \nCountries  can  pool  their  resources  to  enter  into  purchasing  agreements  with  drug  and \nequipment suppliers. By guaranteeing to purchase a certain amount of drugs and vaccines for \nexample,  prices  will  be  cheaper.  Large  orders  will  help  develop  production  capacity  as \nproducers  are  more  confident  about  the  returns  on  investment.  These  actions  will  reduce  the \ntransaction  cost  for  all  participating  countries  and  help  ensure  that  middle-  and  low-income \ncountries have adequate access to supplies. \n \nD. \n\nLessons and Strategic Approach \n\n1. \n\nLessons  \n\n54. \nADB\u2019s  experience  in  working  with  regional  and  international  organizations  has  been \nlargely  positive.  These  organizations  have  significant  technical  strength  and  generally  have \ngood  relations  with the technical  implementers at  the  national  level,  such  as  line ministries.  In \nthe  health  sector,  ADB  has  worked  well  with  WHO  globally  and  regionally.  While  international \norganizations  have  significant  technical  competence,  they  often  need  support  in  financing  and \nimplementing  large  projects.  ADB\u2019s  strategic  partnership  with  technical  agencies  can  help \nbridge  this  gap.  Both  ADB  and  other  international  organizations  have  complicated  rules  for \nprocurement,  contracting  of  consultant  services,  and  project  implementation.  These  are  often \nnot compatible. From the outset, ADB should try to understand the fiduciary responsibilities of \nother agencies and identify ways of aligning them with its own.  \n \nADB  has  been  working  with  DMCs  to  develop  regional  response  to  public  health \n55. \nconcerns,  such  as  HIV/AIDS  and  communicable  disease  control.  This  support  has  included  a \nmix  of  support  to  national  governments  and  to  relevant  international  organizations.  ADB  has \n\n \n\n\ffound  that  this  mix  provides  a  good  balance  and  encourages  DMCs  to  play  an  active  role  in \nregional dialogue.  \n \n56. \nOne  of  the  most  relevant  lessons  comes  from  ADB\u2019s  work  in  supporting  SARS  control \nefforts in 2003. ADB supported WHO regionally and offered to support affected countries with \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  resources  (grants)  and  restructured  loans.  ADB\u2019s  support  to  WHO \nwas timely. Although WHO was the lead technical agency, it had limited resources, often tied to \nspecific  initiatives.  Besides  financial  support,  ADB  provided  WHO  with  important  logistical \nsupport  and  facilitated  high-level  access  outside  the  health  sector.  This  combination  improved \nthe  effectiveness  of  both  organizations\u2019  activities  to  control  the  spread  of  SARS  and  is  an \nimportant precedent for both organizations.   \n \n\n2. \n\nGuiding Principles for Regional Support \n\nADB will be guided by the following principles:  \n\n57. \n \nEffective  Coordination. Several international agencies and development partners plan \n58. \nto  support  a  response  to  avian  influenza  in  the  region.  ADB  will  closely  coordinate  its  support \nwith other partners to ensure synergies and avoid duplication. ADB will be guided by FAO/OIE \nand  WHO  to  ensure  technical  consistency.  ADB  will  work  with  others  to  ensure  complete \nregional coverage. \n \n59. \nResults  Orientation.  ADB\u2019s  objective  is  to  help  countries  control  and  prevent  avian \ninfluenza.  ADB  will  support  only  those  regional  activities  that  have  demonstrable  significant \nimpact on national efforts and will work to ensure that regional activities are properly linked to \nnational strategies and activities.  \n \n60. \nFlexibility.  Interest  in  and  commitment  to  fighting  avian  influenza  is  growing.  The \ndisease  and  its  risk  to  human  and  animal  health  are  evolving.  A  rapid  response  to  avian \ninfluenza  has  to  be  flexible  in  design  and  implementation.  ADB  will  ensure  that  its  operations \nare sufficiently flexible to meet the changing needs, including working closely with implementing \npartners to harmonize procedures.   \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n61. \nThe Project is part of the international effort to respond to the threat of highly pathogenic \navian  influenza  and  to  prepare  for  a  possible  human  influenza  pandemic,  thereby  helping \nprevent,  or  at  least  mitigate,  possible  major  social  and  economic  disruptions  in  Asia  and  the \nPacific  region.  The  Project  will  improve  national  and  regional  capacity  for  surveillance  and \nresponse  to  emerging  diseases.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  in  close  coordination  with \nother national and international initiatives. \n \n62. \nThe Project will support regional cooperation activities related to information sharing and \ncommunication,  laboratory  services,  and  public  health  procedures.  The  Project  will  support \nregional  capacity  to  respond  to  a  potential  pandemic.  The  Project,  designed  in  close \ncoordination  with  governments,  ASEAN,  FAO,  WHO,  and  other  regional  partners,  will  be \nimplemented in a harmonized way with other national and international initiatives. \n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n13\n\n63. \nThe  Project  has  four  components,  to  be  implemented  over  2.5  years:  (i)  regional \ncapacity building, (ii) regional coordination, (iii) avian influenza response facility, and (iv) project \nmanagement.  Appendix  5  shows  the  linkages  between  project  components  and  the  strategic \nactions to combat avian and human influenza.  \n \nC. \n\nGrantees and Beneficiaries \n\n64. \nThe Project will benefit DMCs in Asia and the Pacific Region. It will provide grant support \nto  international  organizations  to  support  regional  capacity  building  activities  and  to  strengthen \nthe avian influenza prevention and control activities of various DMCs. \n \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Regional Capacity Building  \n\n65. \nThe Project will strengthen the capacity of international organizations to support national \nactivities to control avian influenza, and to prevent, if possible, or prepare for, a human influenza \npandemic. Although the financing will be channeled through international organizations, support \nwill focus on activities that directly benefit DMCs and support their national efforts. \n \n\na. \n\nContaining Infection at Source \n\n66. \nThe Project will help contain avian influenza at source by strengthening the capacity of \nFAO  and  ASEAN  Secretariat  to  provide  adequate  support  to  DMCs\u2019  activities  related  to  avian \ninfluenza and the animal health sector. The Project will finance consultants and the procurement \nof equipment, supplies, drugs, and services for animal health interventions. The Project will help \nstrengthen  animal  health  services  in  the  region  and,  among  others,  (i)  develop  and  refine \nnational plans and capacities for containing avian influenza, (ii) develop policies and systems for \nanimal  quarantine  and  vaccination,  and  (iii)  develop  guidelines  for  culling  poultry  flocks  and \nestablishing  compensation  mechanisms.  The  financing  will  support  FAO\u2019s  regional  emergency \nresponse  team,  the  Emergency  Center  for  Transboundary  Animal  Diseases  (ECTAD).  This \nsupport will focus on the ECTAD regional unit in Bangkok and elsewhere in the region. \n \n\nb. \n\nPreventing Human Infection and Preparing for a Potential Human \nInfluenza Pandemic  \n\nThe  Project  will  help  prepare  the  region  for  a  potential  human  influenza  pandemic  by \n67. \nstrengthening WHO\u2019s regional capacity to support countries. The Project will finance consultants \nand the procurement of equipment, supplies, drugs, and services to help prevent and control a \npandemic. Support will be oriented to countries\u2019 needs to protect human health and will, among \nothers,  include  activities  to  (i)  develop  and  rehearse  pandemic  preparedness  plans,  (ii) \nstrengthen surveillance and case management, and (iii) advise on drugs and medical supplies \nfor human influenza outbreaks.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Regional Coordination  \n\n68. \nThe  Project  will  help  strengthen  regional  coordination  and  communication  among \ncountries  on  emerging  and  communicable  diseases  among  animals  and  humans.  Regional \navian  influenza  communication  and  planning  networks  will  be  developed  and  expanded,  and \nresearch  and  surveillance  networks  strengthened  to  coordinate  veterinary  and  biomedical \nanalysis  and  research.  The  Project  will  finance  national  advocacy  and  public  information \n\n \n\n\fcampaigns.  Appendix  6  contains  details  of  regional  activities.  Funding  in  component  2  can  be \nallocated  to  international  organizations  or  directly  to  participating  DMCs  when  they  have \nsufficient  capacity  (government  agencies,  academic  institutions,  or  the  private  sector)  to \nadminister the component themselves, without the support of international organizations.  \n \n\na. \n\nImproved Technical Coordination \n\n69. \nThe  Project  will  help  improve  coordination  between  affected  countries.  It  will  help \nestablish  networks  to  share  epidemiological  and  other  scientific  information,  diagnostic \nproblems and solutions, and laboratory specimens and samples; develop regional research and \ndevelopment  projects  related  to  emerging  diseases;  and  strengthen  regional  reference \nlaboratories if requested, and coordinate responses to avian influenza and emerging diseases. \nSpecifically, this subcomponent will increase technical exchanges of staff and researchers, and \nregional efforts to develop and manufacture human and animal influenza vaccines and drugs.  \n \n\nb. \n\nRapid Field Response and Containment Capacity \n\n70. \nThe  Project  will  help  establish  a  cadre  of  national  and  international  professionals \nresident in the region, who can be rapidly mobilized to respond to a human influenza pandemic. \nSelected  from  different  countries  in  the  region,  they  will  be  trained  to  lead  a  pandemic \ncontainment response on short notice (Appendix 6). The Project will strengthen communication \nnetworks in the region to ensure early warning of emerging diseases. \n \n\nc. \n\nRisk Communication \n\n71. \nThe  Project  will  help  DMCs  develop  and  implement  risk  communication  strategies  on \navian  influenza  and  emerging  diseases,  ensuring  regional coordination and  consistency  in  the \nmessages.  In  particular,  it  will  support  broad  civil  society  involvement  (mass  media, \nnongovernment  organizations,  and  community  workers)  in  public  communication  campaigns \nand  mass  education  programs  on  avian  influenza.  Messages  will  help  the  public  distinguish \nbetween  avian  influenza,  seasonal  influenza,  and  influenza  pandemic.  The  Project  will  ensure \nthat  information  campaigns  consider  the  language  and  culture  of  the  target  populations.  This \neffort  will  support  and  complement  ongoing  activities  currently  being  jointly  developed  by \nUNICEF and WHO. \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Avian Influenza Response Facility  \n\n72. \nThe Project will expeditiously and flexibly help meet the changing needs of the evolving \nepidemic  by  creating  an  avian  influenza  response  facility  (AIREF).  The  Project  will  (i)  provide \ncritical  and  urgent  financing  to  contain  an  avian  influenza  outbreak,  (ii)  meet  urgent  needs  for \nresponding  to  human  influenza  outbreaks  in  a  pandemic  or  pre-pandemic  scenario,  and  (iii) \nsupport regional stockpiling. Support for regional stockpiles will complement existing efforts by \npartners  to establish  stockpiles  and  will  constitute  only  a small  part  of  the  overall  contribution. \nCriteria for accessing AIREF financing, and operational details are in Appendix 7. \n \n73. \nAIREF  financing  will  be  made  available  to  participating  DMCs  or  international \norganizations, as needed. DMCs will be able to access this funding through a simple application \nprocedure. While all DMCs are eligible to receive financing through this component, priority will \nbe given to those that are at greatest risk from avian influenza, following criteria established by \nADB and in consultation with WHO and FAO/OIE. A steering committee, headed by the Director \nGeneral  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  (RSDD),  will  guide  AIREF \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nimplementation.  Based  on  inputs  from  FAO,  WHO,  and  other  technical  agencies,  the  steering \ncommittee  will  decide  when  to  allocate  resources.  To  ensure  flexibility  in  resource  allocation, \nADB  may  transfer  the  resources  to  its  resident  missions,  country  offices,  or  regional  offices \nunder the country director\u2019s authority. Resources may also be transferred directly to an imprest \naccount established by DMCs, following procedures described in paragraph 102.  \n \n74. \nAIREF  may  provide  additional  support  to  WHO,  FAO,  ASEAN,  and  other  international \norganizations  (if  they  enter  into  a  grant  agreement  with  ADB).  International  organizations  may \nrequest urgent financing for activities related to avian influenza prevention and control, such as \ntraining  workshops,  enhancement  of  regional  response  teams,  and  emergency  support  for \ncountry offices.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Management \n\n75. \nThe  Project  will  be  supervised  by  an  avian  influenza  secretariat  located  within  ADB, \nincluding equipment and supplies required for project management. The secretariat will include \na  small  number  of  consultants.  Project  resources  will  be  used  for  workshops  and  meetings  to \ncoordinate with participating DMCs and international organizations. The secretariat will support \nregional and national coordination with other partners, as well as project auditing and financial \nmanagement  services.  ASEAN,  WHO,  and  FAO  will  manage  their  own  operations  in \naccordance with their own procedures, subject to agreement with ADB. This will allow ADB to \nfocus on project coordination.  \n \nD. \n\nAsian Development Fund IX Grant  \n\n76. \nA $25 million Asian Development Fund (ADF) grant will support the activities proposed \nin the Project, through international organizations and eligible DMCs actively involved in avian \ninfluenza  prevention  and  control.  ADF  IX  includes  a  grant  program  to  combat  HIV/AIDS  and \nother  infectious  diseases.  Grants  can  also  be  made  to  a  regional  institution  for  reasons  of \nefficiency  and  to  promote  public  goods.  As  international  organizations  involved  with  ADB \nmember countries and concerned with the economic development of Asia and the Pacific region, \nASEAN acting through the ASEAN Secretariat, FAO, and WHO satisfy the criteria for receiving \nADF  funds  for  the  ultimate  benefit of  ADF  borrowing  DMCs.  The  rationale  and  purpose  of  the \ngrants are outlined in Appendix 8. \n \nE. \n\nSpecial Features  \n\n1. \n\nRegional Cooperation \n\n77.  Most  initiatives  to  control  avian  influenza  are  specific  to  countries.  However,  infectious \ndiseases  cannot  be  stopped  from  spreading  across  borders  without  regional  cooperation,  and \nthere is a significant gap in funding to improve regional technical capacity and readiness. The \nProject  adopts  a  regional  approach  because  avian  influenza  control  is  a  regional  public  good, \nand  individual  governments  will  need  significant  support  from  regional  organizations  to  plan, \nmanage, and implement programs to respond to a pandemic. Regional collaboration will enable \neach  country  to  draw  on  the  expertise  and  experience  of  other  countries;  joint  planning \nexercises  will  support  action  to  solve  multi-country  issues;  and  pooled  resources  will  enable \neach  country  to  respond  more  effectively  to  avian  influenza  outbreaks  that  are  beyond  their \nindividual capacity.  \n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nFlexible Implementation \n\n78. \nThe  Project  is  being  designed  in  coordination  with  other  national  and  international \ninitiatives  and  will  be  used  for  regional  activities  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and \nEmergency  Assistance  Policy.19 ADB  will  apply  its  guidelines  and  procedures  flexibly  to  lower \nthe transaction costs of project implementation and significantly reduce the time for procurement \nand disbursement. Many of these features have been incorporated in the project design and in \nthe grant agreements, after consultation within ADB and with the implementing agencies.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPreventive Action \n\n79. \nThe Project will directly contribute to the global effort to reduce the risks of an influenza \npandemic  and,  in  the  medium  term,  to  control  emerging  diseases.  Actions  will  be  taken  to \nreduce  the  prevalence  of  influenza  among  birds  and  to  quickly  address  influenza  outbreaks \namong  humans.  The  Project  will  support  international  efforts  to  contain  the  spread  of  an \noutbreak and mitigate its impact.  \n \n\n4. \n\nComplementarity with International Efforts \n\n80. \nADB  is  helping  interested  countries  control  avian  influenza  by  using  savings  under  the \nongoing projects. This Project will work closely with these initiatives. In 2003, in response to the \nSARS outbreak, ADB financed a team of communicable disease specialists based in the WHO \nWestern  Pacific  Regional  Office  in  Manila.20 The  Project  will  build  on  these  relationships.  The \nProject  will  also  complement  two  investment  projects  focusing  on  strengthening  the  human \nhealth surveillance system, the Preventive Health System Support Project in Viet Nam and the \nRegional Communicable Disease Control Project for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). \n \n81. \nADB will play an important role in improving regional coordination in Asia and the Pacific \nRegion. Currently, FAO, the World Bank, and WHO are leading global efforts to combat avian \ninfluenza.  This  role  was  recognized  at  the  Beijing  Conference,  with  the  regional  development \nbanks focusing on financing and coordination at the regional level. ADB will provide coordination \nfor  many  regional  activities,  serving  as  a  link  among  the  regional  offices  of  FAO  and  WHO, \nDMCs,  and  other  international  organizations.  ADB  also  brings  important  links  to  economic \nministries (such as the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning, and the Central Bank) in many \ncountries. ADB has experience implementing projects and activities with Ministries of Agriculture \nand Health on a large scale in many DMCs which few other technical agencies have. ADB also \nhas extensive experience with regional cooperation initiatives, such as the GMS  Program and \nother  similar  regional  and  sub-regional  initiatives.  ADB  will  build  upon  this  experience  in \ncoordinating project activities.  \n \nF. \n\nCost Estimates  \n\n82. \nThe Project is estimated to cost $38 million.

Access to ADF \nfunds for this purpose is permitted by Section 3.02 of the Regulations of the Asian Development \nFund. As the disease poses a risk to the entire region, which will benefit from the public good \naspects  of  the  Project,  DMCs  not  eligible  for  ADF  resources  must  be  included  in  the  Project \nactivities. JSF and TASF funds will be used to finance eligible activities in all participating DMCs. \nADB\u2019s  policy  of  not  extending  financing  to  countries  in  non-accrual  status  does  not  affect \n                                                 \n21 ADB.1966.  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank.  Manila.  (Article  11  Recipients  and  Methods  of \n\nOperations. Reprinted with corrections June 2002).  \n\n \n\n\fregional and subregional ADF IX grant financing provided for projects at regional level in which \nbenefits  are  indivisible.  DMCs  that  are  in  non-accrual  status  will  only  receive  support  through \ninternational  organizations  under  this  Project  and  the  Project  will  not  directly  finance  DMCs  in \nnon-accrual status. 22 \n \n86. \nFor  several  activities  from  components  1  and  2  of  the  Project,  ADB  will  provide  grant \nfinancing  directly  to  ASEAN  through  ASEAN  Secretariat,  FAO,  and  WHO  for  the  benefit  of \nDMCs. Before conducting activities in a DMC, each participating international organization shall \nreceive  confirmation  from  ADB  as  Executing  Agency  that  the  DMC  does  not  object  to  ADB \nfinancing  project  activities  in  its  territory.  ADB  will  seek  no-objection  letters  from  all  eligible \nDMCs.23 For some activities under component 2, financing can be provided directly to interested \nDMCs.  For  component  3,  ADB  will  provide  grant  financing  directly  to  eligible  and  participating \nDMCs  or  to  participating  international  organizations,  depending  on  their  needs.  All  grants  will \nhave  terms  and  conditions  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  out  in  the  draft  grant \nagreements presented to the Board.  \n \nThe Project will use funds from ADF, JSF, and TASF in conformity with applicable rules \n87. \nand regulations. For activities carried out by international organizations (through components 1, \n2, and 3), the Project will pool financing from all three sources. The proper use of ADF funds will \nbe ensured through the following: (i) each international organization receiving funds under the \nProject will be required to issue a certificate confirming that the ADF funds have been used for \nthe  benefit  of  ADF-  eligible  borrowers  only;  and  (ii)  funds  from  ADF,  TASF  and  JSF  will  be \ndisbursed based on the agreed percentages. These measures will ensure that ADF IX funds are \nonly  used  for  the  benefit  of  ADF-eligible  borrowers.  DMCs  that  receive  financing  directly  from \nthe Project (through components 2 and 3) will receive funds only from one source in accordance \nwith standard practices and the nature of the support. The activities under components 1 and 2 \n(and  some  activities  under  component  3)  of  this  Project  are  considered  eligible  for  financing \nfrom  TASF.    While  TASF  funds  are  typically  used  for  technical  assistance,  the  Regulations  of \nthe TASF permit the use of TASF funds for financing the types of activities under components 1 \nand 2 (and some activities under component 3) of the Project.24  The Government of Japan has \nagreed that JSF resources can be used to finance activities under the Project. \n \nInternational  organizations  have  already  contributed  substantial  resources  to  support \n88. \ntheir  own  efforts  to  combat  avian  influenza,  and  development  partners  are  contributing \nadditional  resources  that  will,  in  many  cases,  complement  ADB\u2019s  support.  ADB\u2019s  support  to \nparticipating DMCs will complement their own efforts to control avian influenza and implement \ninfluenza pandemic preparedness plans. Tables A9.1 and A9.2 (Appendix 9) provide additional \ninformation on the allocation of resources to eligible countries.  \n \n\n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2004. ADF IX Grant Programs: Instructions to Staff. Manila. Particularly paragraph 19.  \n23 ADB.1966. Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank. Manila. Article 14(iii) stipulates that ADB will not   \n\nfinance activities in the territories of a member country if that member objects to such activities.  \n\n24 Section 1.01 of the Regulations of the TASF states, \u201cThe purposes of the Fund shall be to provide financing for the \ntechnical assistance and related operational activities of the Bank pursuant to the provisions of these Regulations.  \nSection 3.01 of the Regulations of the TASF states in pertinent part, \u201cthe resources of the Fund may be used, alone \nor  in  combination  with  any  other  resources  available  to  the  Bank,  for  financing  the  cost  of  expert  services  and \nrelated  facilities  required  for  technical  assistance  or  related  operational  activities  (including  staff  training  and \ndevelopment for developing member countries) to be carried out by the Bank.\u201d \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nH. \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nExecuting  Agency.  Consistent  with  the  Project\u2019s  regional  approach  and  the  need  for \n89. \nrapid implementation and fund disbursement, the Project will be administered by ADB directly, \nthrough  a  small  avian  influenza  secretariat  established  in  RSDD.  The  secretariat  will  ensure \noverall project supervision and provide strategic guidance to implementing agencies. It will also \nhandle the Project\u2019s administrative aspects and coordinate closely with ASEAN, FAO, and WHO. \nAppendix  10  outlines  the  Project\u2019s  management  structure.  This  arrangement  will  be  reviewed \nperiodically and may be adjusted. \n \nImplementing Agencies. ASEAN Secretariat25, FAO, and WHO will implement most of \n90. \nthe  activities  under  components  1  and  2,  in  coordination  with  ADB.  They  will  implement  the \nproject  activities  in  accordance  with  their  organizational  focus  and  capabilities.  Each \ninternational organization will have its own project management structure.  \n  \n91. \nComponent 3 will be managed directly by ADB through the avian influenza secretariat, \nand  financial  resources  will  be  transferred  as  needed,  including  to  ASEAN,  FAO,  and  WHO, \nparticipating  DMCs,  and  other  international  organizations.  Financial  management  and  control \nprocedures  will  be  established  by  ADB.  The  ADB  country  and  regional  directors  may  be \nauthorized  by  the  steering  committee  to  directly  procure  equipment,  services,  and  supplies. \nThey  may  also  disburse  emergency  funds  to  governments  for  high-priority  activities  such  as \nsurveillance in an area with an outbreak or support for quarantine enforcement. \n \n92. \nSteering  Committee.  A  steering  committee  will  coordinate  project  activities.  The \nsteering committee will be headed by the director general, RSDD, and will have as members the \ndirectors general of ADB\u2019s five regional departments, the Strategy and Policy Department (SPD) \nand  the  Chair  of  the  Health  Sector  Community  of  Practice.  The  steering  committee  will  meet \nformally  every  3  months  to  guide  project  implementation,  policy  dialogue,  and  building  of \nregional  capacity  and  cooperation.  In  case  of  an  emergency,  the  steering  committee  may  be \ncalled to meet on short notice to ensure quick ADB action. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 30 months, from March 2006 to August 2008.  \n\n93. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n94. \nProcurement  by  international  organizations,  including  ASEAN,  FAO,  and  WHO,  will  be \ndone  according  to  each  agency\u2019s  procurement  policies,  acceptable  to  ADB.  To  ensure  a \nbalance  between  protecting \nintellectual  property  rights,  equity,  quality,  and  economy, \nparticipating  international  organizations  will  use  FAO  and  WHO  guidelines,  as  appropriate,  to \nprocure  pharmaceutical  and  laboratory  products.  ADB  will  help  pay  standard  and  reasonable \nadministrative charges to implementing international organizations.  \n \n\n                                                 \n25 The  grant  agreement  for  the  Project  will  be  signed  with  ASEAN  Secretariat,  which  is  mandated  to  provide  for \ngreater efficiency in the coordination of ASEAN organs and for more effective implementation of ASEAN projects and \nactivities. \n \n\n \n\n\fA participating DMC and ADB will identify a national implementing agency (or agencies) \n95. \nfor  procurement,  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  the  processes  outlined  in \nADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Subject to agreement by the DMC and ADB, \ninternational  shopping  procedures  or  local  competitive  bidding,  with  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB,  may  be  used  for  contracts  of  $200,000  or  more.  Direct  purchase  may  be  used  for \ncontracts worth less than $200,000. This allows more flexibility to meet the DMC\u2019s needs. The \nDMC  will  use  FAO  and  WHO  guidelines,  as  appropriate,  to  procure  pharmaceutical  and \nlaboratory products, subject to agreement by ADB.  \n \n96. \nGiven  the  importance  of  responding  quickly  to  the  region\u2019s  changing  needs,  and  of \nfacilitating  work  with  potential  cofinanciers  and  with  international  organizations  with  a  diverse \nmembership, the procurement of goods and services will be permitted form both ADB member \nand non-member countries.26 \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services and Training Activities \n\ninternational \n97.  Most  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  by  participating \norganizations  or  by  participating  DMCs.  ADB  will  engage  some  consultants  for  project \nadministration and may also contract, if requested, consultants directly for the use of DMCs and \ninternational  organizations.  The  Project  will  finance  an  estimated  651  person-months  of \nconsulting  services  through  components  1,  2,  and  4.  Additional  consultants  may  be  recruited \nunder  component  3.  Appendix  11  summarizes  consulting  services  and  outline  terms  of \nreference.  \n \nInternational organizations will use their own recruitment procedures, acceptable to ADB, \n98. \nto  recruit  consultants  (firms  and  individuals).  ADB  financing  will  support  short-  and  long-term \nconsultants  in  international  organizations.  ADB  financing  may  only  be  used  for  staff  directly \nsupporting  the  objectives  and  goals  of  this  Project.  As  much  as  feasible  and  based  on  ADB's \nassessment  of  their  capacity,  implementing  agencies  in  DMCs  will  select  and  engage \nconsultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants or other procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Consistent with ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, ADB will \nensure that selection and engagement of consultants is done flexibly and on time. If requested \nby  international  organizations  or  DMCs,  ADB  may  recruit  consultants  directly  to  work  with  the \ninternational organization or DMC. \n \n99. \nGiven  the  importance  to  respond  quickly  to  changing  needs  of  the  region,  and  to \nfacilitate  work  with  potential  cofinanciers  and  with  international  organizations  with  a  diverse \nmembership, the selection and engagement of consultants will be permitted from ADB member \nand nonmember countries.27 \n \n\n                                                 \n26 Pursuant  to  Chapter  III,  Article  14  (ix)  of  ADB\u2019s  Charter,  the  Board  of  Directors,  may  by  a  vote  of  Directors \nrepresenting  not  less  than  two  thirds  of  the  total  voting  power  of  members,  permit  procurement  of  goods  and \nservices  from  ADB  non-member  countries  in  appropriate  circumstances.  If  the  required  affirmative  vote  of  the \nBoard  of  Directors  is  not  obtained,  goods  and  services  for  the  Project  will  be  procured  only  from  ADB  member \ncountries. \n\n27 Pursuant  to  Chapter  III,  Article  14  (ix)  of  ADB\u2019s  Charter,  the  Board  of  Directors,  may  by  a  vote  of  Directors \nrepresenting  not  less  than  two  thirds  of  the  total  voting  power  of  members,  permit  procurement  of  goods  and \nservices  from  ADB  non-member  countries  in  appropriate  circumstances.  If  the  required  affirmative  vote  of  the \nBoard  of  Directors  is  not  obtained,  goods  and  services  for  the  Project  will  be  procured  only  from  ADB  member \ncountries. \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\n100.  The  Project  will  support  training  and  capacity  building,  organized  by  international \norganizations  or  DMCs.  They  will  prepare  training  plans  in  consultation  with  ADB  and  will \nensure that training is open to all qualified candidates. Appendix 12 provides an indicative list of \ntraining activities.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n101.  Quick  disbursement  is  the  key  to  effective  and  timely  response.  For  international \norganizations,  ADB  funds,  which  combine  ADF,  JSF,  and  TASF,  will  be  drawn  down  on  the \nbasis  of  up  to  12  months\u2019  estimated  expenditure,  subject  to  substantiation  of  previously \ndisbursed funds. ADB will specify the percentage for each fund that should be allocated to each \ninternational  organization.  At  the  time  of  each  drawdown,  the  international  organizations  shall \nsubmit to ADB a written application indicating, among other things, a forecast of the use of such \nfunds.  The  amounts  to  be  drawn  down  shall  subsequently  be  replenished  against  (i)  the \nstatement of expenditures; and (ii) the submission of a financial report, as agreed in the grant \nagreement.  The  total  drawdown  shall  not  exceed  the  amount  agreed  by  the  international \norganizations and ADB.  \n \n102.  For  expenditures  executed  by  DMCs  under  components  2  and  3,  ADB  will  provide \nadvances  to  the  implementing  agencies,  as  agreed  by  ADB,  and  each  agency  will  establish \nimprest  accounts  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  upon  Project  effectiveness,  if \nrequired.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  be  no  more  than  12 \nmonths\u2019 estimated expenditures. Replenishment of advances will be supported by a statement \nof  expenditures,  and  ADB  may  require  invoices  and  receipts,  as  indicated  in  the  grant \nagreement. Total disbursement will be up to the maximum amount agreed by the implementing \nagency  and  ADB.  Only  ADF-eligible  DMCs  may  receive  allocations  from  ADF  funds  in \ncomponent 3. Detailed arrangements for establishing and operating the imprest account will be \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook,28 as amended from time to time.  \n \n\n6. \n\nFinancial Management, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n103.  Financial  Management. ADB has extensive experience administering TA projects and \nhas supervised numerous investment projects. ADB uses internationally recognized procedures \nfor  accounting  and  auditing,  has  an  internal  audit  function,  and  hires  an  independent  external \nauditor annually. FAO and WHO operate under sound and internationally recognized accounting \nand financial principles. ADB has collaborated with both on TA projects and is implementing an \ninvestment project with WHO.  \n \n104.  Accounts  and  Auditing.  The  Project  will  apply  sound  accounting  and  auditing \nstandards according to internationally accepted practices. Funds managed directly by ADB will \nbe subject to same audit and reporting requirements as other resources managed by ADB.  \n \n105.  ASEAN acting through ASEAN Secretariat, FAO, and WHO will carry out audits on time, \nusing their own established procedures, acceptable to ADB, and submit to ADB certified copies \nof  audited  project  accounts,  financial  statements,  and  the  auditor\u2019s  reports.  Implementing \nagencies  in  participating  DMCs  will  also  provide  ADB  with  an  audited  report,  following \ninternationally  accepted  practices.  They  will  submit  to  ADB  certified  copies  of  audited  project \naccounts, including the imprest accounts, statements of expenditures, and financial statements, \nthe  auditor\u2019s  reports  and  opinions,  and  a  management  letter  together  with  a  report  of  actions \n\n                                                 \n28 ADB. 2001. Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\ntaken to improve financial management. The cost of auditing in DMCs may be financed by the \nProject.  \n \n106.  Anticorruption  Measures.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy29 are included in the \ngrant  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  contracts  financed \ndirectly  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  all contractors,  suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nCofinancing \n\n107.  ADB is in active dialogue with a number of potential co-financiers to mobilize additional \nsupport.  Such  cofinancing  may  include  grants  and  loans  and  may  benefit  from  ADB  credit \nenhancements, including ADB guarantee instruments. ADB has typically sought Board approval \nto administer loan or grant funds from cofinanciers only when cofinancing commitments are in \nplace.  In  light  of  the  need  for  expediency  and  efficiency  in  ADB's  response,  Management \nrequests  Board  approval  of  the  administration  of  any  cofinanced  funds  obtained  from \ndevelopment  partners  after  Board  approval.  Approval  of  such  cofinanced  funds  will  be \nconfirmed  and  approved  by  Management,  and  reported  to  the  Board  in  accordance  with  the \nstandard reporting procedures. This procedure will be adopted only if additional funds provided \nby  cofinanciers  will  not  materially  alter  or  fundamentally  affect  the  Project\u2019s  objectives, \npurposes,  and  scope.  Any  proposed  cofinancing  that  will  materially  affect  the  Project\u2019s \nobjectives, purpose, or scope will be processed as a major change of scope and circulated to \nthe Board in accordance with ADB procedures.  \n \n\n8. \n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Finance \n\n108.  The  Project  will  support  advance  procurement  action  and  retroactive  financing  to \nrespond  to  the  region\u2019s  urgent  needs.  In  particular,  ADB  will  support  preparation  of  bidding \ndocuments,  opening  of  tenders,  and  award  of  contracts,  as  required  by  international \norganizations; retroactive financing of contracts of goods and services; and advance consultant \nrecruitment  and  reasonable  retroactive  financing  for  international  organizations  in  contracting \nconsultants  for  project-financed  activities.  Retroactive  financing  is  expected  to  be  minor.  For \nASEAN, WHO and FAO, it may cover expenses 3 months before grant effectiveness and in no \ncase may exceed 10% of the total amount allocated to an international organization. ADB has \nexplained to participating international organizations that advance action does not commit ADB \nto  finance  the  expenditure  or  the  Project  and  that  retroactive  financing  is  only  available  after \napproval by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors.  \n \n109.  ADB  may  also  support  advanced  procurement  and  retroactive  finance  for  participating \nDMCs. In this case, ADB will agree to support the procurement decision of the DMCs before the \nformal  signing  of  the  grant  agreement.  Retroactive  financing  may  cover  expenses  3  months \nbefore grant effectiveness and in no case may exceed 10% of the total amount allocated to a \nDMC. ADB will explain to the DMCs that advance action does not commit ADB to finance the \nexpenditure under the Project and that retroactive financing is available only after the signing of \nthe grant agreement.  \n\n                                                 \n29 ADB. 2005. Anticorruption Policy. Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f23\n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n110.  ADB will carry out project performance monitoring and evaluation in accordance with the \nbaseline indicators and the monitoring targets that have been incorporated into the design and \nmonitoring  framework  (Appendix  1).  A  document  on  lessons  identified  will  be  prepared  upon \nproject completion. As the avian influenza threat is changing, indicators may also be modified. \nThe  avian  influenza  secretariat  will  monitor  the  overall  avian  influenza  situation  and  provide \nperiodic updates to ADB management.  \n \n\n10. \n\nReporting and Project Review \n\n111.  When  the  Project  becomes  effective,  the  avian  influenza  secretariat  will  prepare  a \nquarterly progress report summarizing (i) key activities that have been carried out and planned, \n(ii) outcomes and impact of project activities, (iii) delays and problems encountered and actions \ntaken  to  resolve  them,  and  (iv)  coordination  with  other  organizations  and  programs.  Within  3 \nmonths of physical project completion, the secretariat will prepare a project completion report. \nOne year after effectiveness, ADB will review implementation and its impact. The Project may \nbe reoriented based on current conditions.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n112.  Regional Public Good. The Project will promote regional cooperation as a public good. \nThe  Project  will  focus  on  strengthening  the  regional  response  to  avian  influenza,  including \nstrengthening  links  among  countries,  sharing  information,  and  promoting  risk-pooling  and \nstockpiling of first-line goods. It will also help improve regional disease surveillance.  \n \n113.  Capacity  Building.  Although  the  Project  is  being  developed  to  meet  the  immediate \nneeds of the region to fight avian influenza, this will also build up long-term regional capacity in \nanimal  health  and  public  health.  Training supported  by  the  Project  will  be  valuable  even  if  the \nH5N1  virus  does  not  mutate  into  a  human  influenza  virus.  Zoonosis,  the  animal-to-human \ntransmission  of  disease,  is  a  constant  and  increasing  health  concern,  and  surveillance  and \nresponse capacity needs to be strengthened.  \n \n114.  Social  Benefits.  The  H5N1  epidemic  is  harming  small-scale  poultry  farmers  and \nthreatens  the  livelihoods  of  many  poor  and  near-poor  households.  Reducing  the  spread  of \nhighly  pathogenic  avian \ninfluenza  among  poultry  and  helping  establish  sustainable \ncompensation schemes for culling diseased flocks will significantly improve the welfare of rural \nhouseholds.  \n \n115.  A  human  influenza  pandemic  would  significantly  increase  poverty.  Poor  households \nwould be most at economic risk. Their access to the health system is limited and a catastrophic \nillness  would  send  them  deeper  into  poverty.  It  may  also  force  many  households  to  sell \nproductive assets to pay for health care. The poor are more likely to die from illness. Appendix \n13 contains the Project\u2019s summary poverty reduction and social strategy. \n \n116.  Economic  Benefits. The Project will help prevent or delay an influenza pandemic and \nmitigate  its  impact.  A  pandemic  would  cost  $100  billion\u2013$300  billion  for  the  Asia  and  Pacific \nregion  (excluding  Japan).  The  Project,  in  coordination  with  global,  regional,  and  national \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\finitiatives,  will  lower  the  probability  of  a  pandemic  and  minimize  its  economic  impact.  The \nProject is economically well justified. Appendix 14 contains the Project\u2019s economic analysis.  \n \nB. \n\nProject Risks \n\nit  generally  supervises \n\nin  administering  TA  projects, \n\n117.  Epidemiological  Uncertainty.  H5N1  is  an  avian  virus  rarely  transmitted  to  humans. \nInfluenza  pandemics  are  the  result  of  avian  viruses  mutating  into  a  form  that  could  be \ntransmitted efficiently among humans. There is no guarantee that this will occur with the H5N1 \nvirus. Pandemics can vary widely in virulence and efficiency in spreading, and they may affect \ndifferent  age  groups  differently.  If  the  outbreak  is  mild,  the  Project  may  provide  more  support \nthan  the  region  needs.  However,  if  the  outbreak  is  more  severe  than  expected,  the  Project\u2019s \nsupport  may  not  be  sufficient.  ADB  is  prepared  to  offer  additional  resources  through \nuncommitted loan resources and is preparing stand-by arrangements. Building regional capacity \nfor  disease  surveillance  and  response  will  remain  an  important  benefit  of  the  Project  with  or \nwithout a pandemic. \n \n118.  Direct  Administration.  ADB  will  play  a  central  role  in  administering  the  Project.  The \nrationale  for  this  approach  is  clear\u2014reducing  the  number  of  steps  for  procurement  and \ndisbursement  and  avoiding  delays.  However,  it  also  carries  risks.  While  ADB  has  broad \nexperience \ninvestment  projects. \nDisbursement may be slow as both ADB and international organizations adapt to the features of \nthe Project. ADB will work closely with several strong international organizations and establish \nan  avian  influenza  secretariat  to  oversee  the  Project.  It  will  also  use  simplified  procedures,  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy.  The  Project  was  also \ndesigned with significant internal consultation to ensure that ADB\u2019s administrative requirements \nwill not delay Project implementation.  \n \n119.  Donor  Coordination.  There  is  growing  interest  in  supporting  the  fight  against  avian \ninfluenza.  A  large  number  of  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies  have  offered  assistance  to \ntechnical agencies and governments, which also have their own initiatives. Duplication is a risk, \nand  governments  may  not  have  the  capacity  to  manage  the  offered  assistance.  One  of  the \nprimary  goals  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  regional  coordination,  including  developing  and \nimplementing  preparedness  plans  and  surveillance  activities,  to  allow  countries  to  take  full \nadvantage of support.  \n \n120.  Low Demand. While avian influenza is a major concern of governments throughout the \nworld, they may shift priorities and lose interest if the H5N1 virus becomes less pathogenic or \ndisappears  or  if  some  other  event  takes  center  stage.  ADB  may  commit  significant  resources \nthat may not be used for other priorities. Due to its flexible design, it would be easy to quickly \nadjust the Project. The Project is short, which also assures the quick return of project funds if \nthey are not fully used.  \n \nC. \n\nOverall Assessment  \n\n121.  A pandemic would have substantial impact and could halt economic growth and poverty \nreduction.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  overall  efforts  against  avian  influenza.  It  will  fill  an \nimportant  niche  regionally  by  supporting  coordination  and  regional  activities.  Because  the \ncourse of avian influenza is so uncertain, the Project does have risks. However, the Project is \njustified based on its important contribution to the fight against avian influenza, and to regional \ncapacity building against emerging diseases. \n \n\n24 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\nV. \n\nASSURANCE \n\n122. \nIn addition to the standard assurances, ASEAN Secretariat, FAO, and WHO have each \ngiven  the  following  assurance,  which  is  incorporated  into  the  legal  documents:  the  Project  is \nexpected  to  have  no  significant  impact  on  environment,  resettlement,  indigenous  people,  or \nother vulnerable groups. If emerging needs require new Project activities during implementation \nthat may have an impact on environment, resettlement, indigenous people, or other vulnerable \ngroups, ASEAN Secretariat, FAO, and WHO will each inform ADB and will prepare and submit \nto ADB for approval plans, before requesting financing for that particular activity.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed grants would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \n\n123. \nADB and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\nthe  grants  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $38,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund, Technical Assistance Special Fund \nand  Japan  Special  Fund)  for  the  Prevention  and  Control  of  Avian  Influenza  in \nAsia and the Pacific Project including: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n \n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nthe  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $6,490,000  to  the  Food  and \nAgriculture Organization, from the Asian Development Fund ($4,488,000), \nthe  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  ($231,000),  and  the  Japan \nSpecial  Fund  (equivalent  of  $1,771,000),  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the \ndraft Grant Agreement presented to the Board; \n\nthe  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $12,479,000  to  the  World \nHealth Organization, from the Asian Development Fund ($8,630,000), the \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  ($445,000),  and  the  Japan  Special \nFund (equivalent of $3,404,000), and such other terms and conditions as \nare  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Grant \nAgreement presented to the Board; \n\nthe grant not exceeding the equivalent of $338,000 to the Association of \nSoutheast  Asian  Nations  Secretariat,  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund \n($234,000),  the  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  ($12,000),  and  the \nJapan  Special  Fund  (equivalent  of  $92,000)  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the \ndraft Grant Agreement presented to the Board; \n\nthe  grants  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $18,693,00030 to  be  provided \nto  eligible  and  participating  developing  member  countries  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  and  international  organizations  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  ($11,648,000),  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund \n($2,312,000),  and  Japan  Special  Fund  (equivalent  of  $4,732,000),  and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with \nthose set forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the Board;  \n\n                                                 \n30 This amount also includes the costs of project administration by the Asian Development Bank, through the avian \n\ninfluenza secretariat. \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fthe administration by ADB of loans or grants in accordance with the proposal set \nout  in  paragraph  107  of  this  Report  for  the  Prevention  and  Control  of  Avian \nInfluenza  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  Project,  to  be  provided  by  any  development \npartner  or  cofinancier  on  a  loan  or  a  grant  basis,  after  the  date  of  the  Project\u2019s \nBoard approval; and \n\nby a vote of the Directors, representing not less than two thirds of the total voting \npower  of  the  members,  that  goods  and  services,  including  consulting  services, \nfor the Project be procured from ADB member and nonmember countries.

For \n1. \nmost patients, fever, headache, extreme tiredness, dry cough and sore throat, runny nose and \nmuscle aches will last 2 to 5 days and most will recover within one to two weeks. But in the very \nyoung,  the  elderly  and  people  with  chronic  diseases,  influenza  poses  a  serious  risk,  at  times \nleading  to  death.  Influenza  usually  requires  only  symptomatic  treatment.  Antibiotics,  which \ncannot  attack  the  virus,  are  used  only  to  treat  complications  (pneumonia,  bronchitis,  ear \ninfections) due to secondary infections caused by bacteria. Antiviral drugs now exist, which are \nuseful  adjuncts  in  prophylaxis  and  treatment  for  more  vulnerable  people,  and  help  reduce \ninfluenza-related hospitalization and mortality  \n \n2. \nEpidemics of influenza typically occur every year, during the winter months in temperate \nregions and spread rapidly around the world in seasonal epidemics. The flu every year infects a \nsignificant portion of the population (ranging from 5% to 20%, depending on the strain), leading \nto  the  death  of  a  small  percentage  (600,000  to  1.5  million  people  worldwide,1 but  imposing  a \nconsiderable economic burden. Studies, usually done in the context of the cost-effectiveness of \nvaccination in high income countries, have shown that regular flu outbreaks are quite costly in \nterms  of  lost  productivity  and  additional  medical  care.2 Advances  in  public  health  and  curative \nmedicine  and  the  developments  of  vaccines  have  greatly  reduced  the  impact  of  ordinary \n(seasonal) flu outbreaks. Antiviral medications have been developed and shown to be effective, \nwhen taken soon after the onset, in reducing the length of illness and in lessening its symptoms. \nThey are also generally effective as prophylaxis in healthy adults after exposure to a potential \ninfection. They also appear to be effective for high-risk populations and children.3 There are two \nclasses of antiviral drugs, the adamantane derivatives and the neuraminidases inhibitors. Some \nresistance to antiviral drugs has appeared but neuraminidases inhibitors \u2014zanamivir (Relenza\u00ae) \nand oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae) \u2014 remain effective when taken correctly and timely.  \n \n3. \nInfluenza  A  and  B  are  the  two  types  of  influenza  viruses  that  cause  epidemic  human \ndisease.4 The  most  dangerous  outbreaks  are  \u201cType  A\u201d  caused  by  Influenza  A  viruses,  which \ncan  also  infect  other  mammals  (pigs,  horses,  cats)  and  birds.  They  are  responsible  for \nepidemics and pandemics (all pandemics viruses are type A). Influenza B only affects humans \nand is responsible for sporadic outbreaks of illness. Influenza A viruses are further categorized \ninto subtypes on the basis of two surface antigens: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). \nThere are 16 different H antigens and 9 different N antigens that have been identified to date, \nused to name the viruses (such as \u201cH1N1\u201d, \u201cH3N2\u201d, \u201cH7N7\u201d, and \u201cH5N1\u201d). The influenza viruses \nare  further  separated  into  groups  on  the  basis  of  other  antigens,  and  these  different  groups \n(strains) may have different pathogenicity, even if they are classified in the same HN type. \n \n4. \nThe influenza viruses are very unstable, and when the virus replicate, there are frequent \nsmall  mutations  resulting  in  antigenic  changes  (i.e.,  antigenic  drift)  resulting  in  new  influenza \nviruses.5 Immunity  to  the  surface  antigens  (H  and  N)  reduces  the  likelihood  of  infection  and \nseverity of disease if infection occurs. But immunity against one influenza virus type or subtype \n\n                                                 \n1   In the United States, 200,000 people are hospitalized and 36,000 people die on average due to the flu every year.  \n2   Meltzer,  M.,  Cox,  N.,  and  Fukuda,  K.  1999.

The \nseasonal (annual) epidemics of influenza are due to minor changes in the virus, which allow it to \nescape  the  immunity  that  humans  have  developed  after  previous  infections  or  vaccinations. \nLaboratory-based  surveillance  of  the  virus  facilitates  regular  update  of  vaccines  based  on  the \nmost recent strains of the virus. The annual vaccine contains the most likely strains of the virus \nwhich  probably  will  attack  the  next  year.  The  contents  of  the  flu  vaccine  is  determined  every \nyear  by  WHO.  But  when  a  major  change  occurs  in  the  virus  (i.e.,  antigenic  shift),  no  one  will \nhave immunity against the infection because it is a completely new virus. If this new virus has \nalso the capacity to spread from person-to-person, a pandemic will occur.  \n \nB. \n\nAvian Influenza  - A H5N1 \n\nAvian  influenza  viruses  normally  infect  only  birds  (including  chicken,  ducks,  geese, \n5. \nquails,  and  wild  birds),  and,  occasionally,  pigs  and  other  mammals.  Wild  birds,  especially \nwaterfowls, are a natural reservoir of the viruses and some species may be healthy carriers of \ninfluenza  viruses.  Domestic  poultry  (especially  chicken)  are  vulnerable  to  infection  that  can \nrapidly  reach  epidemic  proportions.  The  disease  in  birds  has  two  forms,  a  mild  illness  barely \nnoticed  and  a  \u201chighly  pathogenic  avian  influenza\u201d  (HPAI),  which  is  extremely  contagious  and \nrapidly  fatal  for  the  birds.  Mutations  or  reassortment  of  the  bird  flu  virus  into  new  and  more \naggressive strains occur regularly and have already caused several severe avian flu outbreaks \nin  the  past,  some  of  them  causing  human  fatalities.  In  1997  in  Hong  Kong,  China,  18  people \nwere infected and 6 died, and in the Netherlands in 2003 several people were infected and one \ndied.  In  both  cases  as  well  as  in  other  similar  outbreaks,  spread  of  the  virus  was  stopped  by \nimmediately culling the whole population of infected chickens.  \n \n6. \nThe present avian influenza outbreaks caused by the H5N1 strain, which first appeared \nin Hong Kong, China in 1997, started in December 2003. H5N1 has spread widely in East Asia \nand has now reached Africa, Europe, the Middle East and South Asia. In Asia, particularly in the \nMekong region, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and in Indonesia, H5N1 is now endemic \nand  firmly  established.  Since  2003,  up  to  150  million  birds  have  died  or  been  culled.  As  of  1 \nMarch  2006,  WHO  confirmed  174  cases  and  94  fatalities. 6  To  date,  most  known  human \ninfections have been in Asia, largely among farm workers. While the microeconomic impact of \nthe avian flu epidemic can be severe among farmers with little access to safety nets because of \nthe losses from chicken deaths and culling, the economic impact at the macroeconomic level is \nexpected to be minor.7 However, this will be true only if avian flu remains confined to animals. \nBut  another  scenario  is  possible,  when  H5N1  virus  acquires  the  capacity  to  easily  be \ntransmissible, passing directly from human to human, and becomes responsible for a pandemic. \n  \n7. \nPatients  typically  suffer  high  fever  and  multiple  symptoms  including  diarrhea,  vomiting, \nabdominal  pain,  and  bleeding  in  gums  and  teeth.  Unlike  in  a  typical  influenza  outbreak,  most \npatients  contract  viral  pneumonia,  which  is  not  responsive  to  antibiotic  treatments.  Current \nprotocols  recommend  prompt  treatment  with  antiviral  neuraminidase  inhibitors  for  both  adults \nand children. However, antiviral neuraminidase inhibitors appear to be only partially effective in \nfighting the infection. They do not cure the patient but they may increase the survival rate and \nlower  the  possibility  of  transmission.  In  addition,  osltamivir  is  recommended  as  post-exposure \nprophylaxis. \n \n                                                 \n6  Taken  from  the  World  Health  Organization\u2019s  Epidemic  and  Pandemic  Alert  and  Response  webpage,  available  at \n\nhttp://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/pandemic/en/index.html, accessed on 23 February 2006.  \n\n7  Asian  Development  Bank.

A  pandemic \n9. \ncan  start  when  three  conditions  have  been  met:  a  new  influenza  virus  subtype  emerges;  it \ninfects humans, causing illness; and it spreads easily among humans. The virus can improve its \ntransmissibility among humans via two principal mechanisms. The first is reassortment, in which \ngenetic  material  is  exchanged  during  co-infection  of  a  human  or  pig.  Reassortment  between \nhuman and avian viruses could result in a fully transmissible pandemic virus, announced by a \nsudden  surge  of  cases  with  explosive  spread.  The  second  mechanism  is  a  more  gradual \nprocess  of  adaptive  mutations,  whereby  the  capability  of  the  virus  to  bind  to  human  cells \nincreases  during  subsequent  infections  of  humans.  Adaptive  mutation,  expressed  initially  as \nsmall  clusters  of  human  cases  with  some  evidence  of  human-to-human  transmission,  would \nprobably give the world some time to take defensive action.88 \n \nThe  most  severe  influenza  pandemic  occurred  in  1918\u20131919,  responsible  for  40\u201350 \n10. \nmillion deaths worldwide. This pandemic, commonly known as the Spanish Flu, was caused by \nthe  influenza  A/H1N1  virus,  recently  shown  to  be  an  avian  influenza  virus  that  jumped  the \nspecies barrier directly to humans.99 The other two influenza pandemics of the 20th century, in \n1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) were both due to avian influenza viruses that recombined with \nhuman strains. While it is not clear where the 1918 strain originated, the 1957 and 1968 strains \nboth originated in Asia. The severity of the Spanish Flu was due, in part, to the circumstances \n(first  World War  1914\u20131918),  including  extremely  poor  sanitary  conditions  in  the  trenches  and \npoor  nutrition.  It  spread  quickly  with  the  demobilization  of  soldiers  at  the  end  of  the  war.1010 \nToday,  vaccines,  antibiotics  and  antiviral  drugs  will  be  available.  Still,  WHO  and  the  CDC \nestimate that a pandemic is likely to result in 2 million to 8 million deaths globally, with a very \nhigh  economic  cost,  particularly  for  low  income  countries  where  health  care  resources  are \nalready constrained. If an influenza pandemic starts, WHO warns: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nGiven the large movements of goods, services, and people, the virus may spread \nrapidly, leaving little or no time to prepare. \nAntiviral drugs and antibiotics, and pandemic vaccines when developed, will be in \nshort  supply  and  unequally  distributed.  It  will  take  several  months  before  any \nvaccine becomes available. \nMedical  facilities  will  probably  be  rapidly  overwhelmed.  Moreover,  widespread \nillness  may  result  in  shortage  of  personnel  to  provide  essential  community \nservices. \n\n                                                 \n8   http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/avian_faqs/en/. \n9   Taubenberger,  J.,  Reid,  A.,  Lourens,  R.,  Wang,  R.,  Jin,  G.,  and  Fanning,  T.  2005.

As  of  February \n2006, the global level of alertness is at stage 3.  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Influenza Pandemic Stages \n\nInterpandemic Period \n\nPhase 1  No new influenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans. An influenza virus \n\nsubtype that has caused human infection may be present in animals. If present in \nanimals, the risk of human infection or disease is considered to be low. \n\nPhase 2  No new influenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans. However, a \n\ncirculating animal influenza virus subtype poses a substantial risk of human disease. \n\nPandemic Alert Period \n\nPhase 3  Human infection(s) with a new subtype, but no human-to-human spread, or at most \n\nrare instances of spread to a close contact. \n\nPhase 4  Small cluster(s) with limited human-to-human transmission but spread is highly \nlocalized, suggesting that the virus is not well adapted to humans. \n\nPhase 5  Substantial Pandemic Risk: Larger cluster(s) but human-to-human spread still \nlocalized, suggesting that the virus is becoming increasingly better adapted to \nhumans, but may not yet be fully transmissible. \n\nPandemic Period \n\nPhase 6  Pandemic: increased and sustained transmission in general population. \nSource: Adapted from World Health Organization. 2005.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n11 World  Health  Organization. \n\nwww.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza on 21 November 2005.  \n\n2005.

Countries  benefit  from  the  preventive  actions  taken  in \nneighbor  countries  and  likewise  suffer  when  neighboring  countries  ignore  the  risk  of  avian \ninfluenza. All countries benefit from public health actions carried out by agencies at the regional \nlevel. No country, on its own, will be able to control avian influenza completely.  \n \n2. \nThe  cost  of  fighting  avian  influenza  can  be  divided  into  several  levels.  First,  there  are \nneeds at the country level, for the efforts of national and local governments, and at the regional \nand  global  levels,  to  support  multi-country  initiatives.  Financing  multi-country  initiatives  is \nimportant  because  of  the  economies  of  scale  in  joint  work  and  the  need  for  multi-country \ncoordination.  Second,  while  efforts  to  fight  avian  influenza  must  multisectoral,  they  can  be \nbroadly  divided  into  efforts  into  (i)  efforts  to  control  avian  influenza  in  the  bird  population,  (ii) \nefforts  to  prevent  the  disease  from  mutating  into  a  human-transmissible  influenza,  and  (iii) \nefforts  to  mitigate  and  recover  from  an  influenza  pandemic.  Finally  there  is  a  time  element. \nAvian  influenza  poses  an  immediate  challenge  to  the  region  and  requires  immediate  action, \nusually  in  the  next  2  years.  The  current  outbreak  of  avian  influenza  has  also  highlighted  the \nimportance of increased investment to improve animal and human health.  \n \n3. \nAssessing the region\u2019s needs for avian influenza prevention and control are complicated \nby the great uncertainty about the future course of the disease and the risk that it presents to \nhuman  health.  With  guidance  from  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  and  the  Food  and \nAgriculture  Organization  (FAO),  the  World  Bank  has  made  an  initial  needs  estimate  at  the \ncountry  level.1 ADB  has  worked  closely  with  FAO  and  WHO  in  understanding  their  regional \nneeds for avian influenza control.  \n \nB. \n\nCountry Needs \n\n4. \nCountry  needs  can  be  divided  into  several  major  components.  First,  coordination  and \ncommunication are essential, as the lack of information can substantially increase the economic \nimpact  of  any  disease  outbreak  as  local  authorities  and  the  public  tend  to  overreact.  Second, \nsurveillance and early warning systems have to be strengthened both for animal health and for \nhuman  health.  Third,  countries  need  to  strengthen  their  response  capacity  to  avian  influenza \noutbreaks. Finally, there is a need to strengthen national health systems, both in their capacity \nto respond to local outbreaks and in surge capacity to address generalized epidemics. Animal \nand human health systems will have to finance a wide range of items, ranging from laboratory \nequipment to protective clothing to overtime payments for staff.  \n \n5. \nThe World Bank\u2019s initial estimates for East Asia, Southeast Asia (including the Mekong \nRegion), the Pacific, and South Asia show that the developing countries require $711 million for \nthe next 2 to 3 years for their avian influenza prevention and control programs. The World Bank \nestimates that these countries collectively can finance, without external support, between $240 \nmillion to $380 million. Central Asian and Caucasus countries probably need an additional $45 \nmillion, with financing capacity in the range of $10 million to $15 million.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   World  Bank.  2005.  Avian  and  Human  Influenza:  Financing  Needs  and  Gaps.  Accessed  on  12  January  2006  on \n\nwww.worldbank.org/avianflu. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n35 \n\n These probably underestimate the total need in the region. The estimates tend to focus \n6. \nheavily  on  needs  for  animal  health  and  underestimate  the  potential  needs  in  several  major \npoultry  producing  countries.  Although  the  needs  of  the  health  system  are  factored,  there  is \nreason  to  expect  that  they  are  several  times  higher  than  what  is  contained  in  the  World  Bank \nestimates.  For  example,  initial  ADB  estimates,  based  on  influenza  models  developed  by  the \nCenters for Disease Prevention and Control in the United States suggest total health care costs, \nshow health care costs in the range of $10 billion during an influenza pandemic. While most of \nthis  cost  would  be  borne  by  households,  it  suggests  significant  costs  to  the  governments  in \naffected regions.  \n \nC. \n\nRegional Needs \n\nEven  with  additional  finances,  the  capacity  of  many  countries  to  implement  avian \n7. \ninfluenza  control  activity  is  limited.  Although  most  countries  are  developing  pandemic \npreparedness  plans,  the  quality  of  these  plans  varies  greatly.  To  ensure  that  the  additional \nresources  are  used  efficiently,  governments  will  need  support  from  technical  agencies  to \nsupport their capacity.  \n \n8. \nFAO  and  WHO  are  the  two  main  technical  agencies  in  avian  influenza  prevention  and \ncontrol  activities.  They  serve  both  as  coordinating  agencies,  working  with  governments  to \nensure  that  information  is  shared  and  responses  are  consistent,  and  as  technical  resource \ncenters, providing technical support to implementation.  \n \n9. \nAlthough  international  agencies  tend  to  have  large  budgets,  these  budgets  are  largely \ntied to pre-existing programs and there is little room for reallocating resources among programs. \nLikewise,  much  of  the  staff  is  assigned  to  programs.  Both  FAO  and  WHO  have  allocated \nsignificant  amounts  of  their  discretionary  and  emergency  response  budgets  to  focus  on  avian \ninfluenza and they have made estimates of their additional resource needs at the regional level.  \n \n10.  Much  of  the  support  provided  to  international  organizations  will  benefit  countries, \nparticularly  poorer  countries.  Support  at  the  regional  level  makes  sense  due  to  the  significant \neconomies  of  scale  that  are  generated  for  large  scale  procurement  and  training.  In  addition, \ninternational organizations can target countries that most need support, which gives additional \nflexibility in the face of uncertainty.  \n \n11. \nThere  are  a  number  of  key  needs  that  can  be  best  organized  at  the  regional  level. \nEstablishing regional stockpiles of drugs and medical equipment and supplies allows the region \nto  prepare  strategically  for  a  human  influenza  outbreak.  By  preparing  a  stockpile,  health \nauthorities  can  respond  quickly  to  a  new  influenza  cluster  and  take  actions  to  prevent  further \noutbreak. Since initial outbreaks are likely to be limited geographically, assembling stockpiles at \nthe regional level introduces important economies of scale.  \n \n12. \nin  strengthening  pandemic \npreparedness.  Organization  of  regional  training  increases  the  access  of  animal  and  human \nhealth  workers  to  specialist  training  that  can  be  offered  economically  in  their  own  country. \nRegional networking (through workshops, communication systems, and the like) also plays an \nimportant role in enhancing the exchange of information.  \n \nFood and Agricultural Organization. FAO, in cooperation with the World Organization \n13. \nfor Animal Health (OIE), focuses on controlling avian influenza. They provide technical support \nto governments, in the form of training, support for laboratories, and the provision of technical \n\nis  a  critical  element \n\nThe  exchange  of \n\ninformation \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nspecialist.  FAO  also  can  provide  emergency  response  funds  to  help  countries  with  avian \ninfluenza  outbreaks.  FAO  has  made  estimates  of  its  needs  at  the  global  level,  referring  to \nresources used at its headquarters that are not assigned to any particular region, and regional \nlevel  resources,  for  activities  and  networks  done  at  the  regional  level  and  the  needs  of  FAO\u2019s \nregional  offices.2 Central  to  FAO\u2019s  needs  is  the  Emergency  Centre  for  Transboundary  Animal \nDisease (ECTAD), which serves a multidisciplinary response unit. ECTADs will be established \nat both the global and regional levels. FAO will provide support to regional laboratories that will \nprovide support to country level laboratories.  \n \n14. \nBased on the needs for 2 years, and following the FAO estimates, regional needs are at \nleast $18.6 million, factoring in only support provided at the regional level (largely implemented \nby FAO\u2019s Bangkok office). FAO also proposes to strengthen regional reference laboratories for \ntesting for avian influenza, with an expected cost of $29 million. Part of this cost is focused on \nAsia and the Pacific region.  \n \n15. \nThe  World  Health  Organization.  Globally,  WHO  is  divided  into  six  regions  that  have \nsignificant  autonomy.  The  Western  Pacific  Regional  Office  (WPRO),  with  its  headquarter  in \nManila, and South East Asia Regional Office (SEARO), based in Delhi, cover most of the Asia \nand  Pacific Regional  Office.  Afghanistan,  Pakistan,  and  the  Central  Asian  countries  are  in  the \nEastern Mediterranean Regional Office (EMRO) and in the European Regional Office (EURO). \nMost  resources  are  allocated  through  regional  offices,  with  WHO  headquarter  focusing  on \nmaintaining consistency and regional coordination.  \n \n16. \nSupport for regional activities in WPRO and SEARO require approximately $26.0 million. \nThis  includes  regional  cooperation  activities,  such  as  regional  response  teams  and  rapid \ninterventions, risk communication and information sharing, and establishing regional stockpiles. \nSupport for EMRO and EURO that is likely to benefit countries in Asia and the Pacific region is \napproximately $11.0 million, for similar activities. One important component of WHO\u2019s support is \nthe Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GORAN), which aims to improve the sharing \nof information and enhance transparency.  \n \n17. \nOther  Organizations. A  number  of  other  organizations  and  networks are  active  at  the \nregional  level.  The  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  is  proposing  to  increase \nsubregional  coordination  in  both  the  areas  of  animal  and  human  health  and  to  improve  the \norganization\u2019s  own  capacity  to  respond  outbreaks  in  the  future.  The  Asia-Pacific  Economic \nCooperation  is  sponsoring  a  number  of  events  to  raise  business,  government,  and  public \nawareness on avian influenza.  \n \n\n                                                 \n2 FAO. 2005.

Since  the  disease  spreads  quickly  across  international  borders,  there  has \nbeen a great deal of international attention focusing on controlling its spread and reducing the \nrisk  of  human  influenza  pandemic.  The  international  community  has  been  mobilized  and  is \ncommitting  significant  resources  to  prevent  and  control  avian  influenza.  Since  the  situation  is \nrapidly evolving and there is a growing realization that a risk of a pandemic is real, the global \nresponse is also changing.  \n \n2. \nThe international community has organized a series of international meetings to discuss \nthe  threat  posed  by  avian  influenza  to  animal  health  and  the  potential  of  human  influenza \npandemic. These meeting have discussed strategy, response, and financing needs. A general \nconsensus has been met about the future direction of action. These meetings have also served \nto develop a sense of urgency and a high level of commitment for combating the challenge of \navian influenza and preventing a human pandemic. \n \n3. \nThere is wide agreement that the best strategy would be to minimize the threat at source \nthrough prevention of the spread of the avian influenza virus. This would entail timely notification \nof avian influenza outbreaks in domestic and wild birds and rapid containment through poultry \nculling  and  vaccination  as  indicated.  Early  warning  and  surveillance  systems  for  animal  and \nhuman  influenza  are  critical  to  an  effective  response,  and  include  provision  of  appropriate \ncompensation  to  livestock  farmers,  especially  for  backyard  poultry  farming.  The  window  of \nopportunity  to  prevent  a  pandemic  is  short.  The  experience  of  SARS1 shows  that  transparent \nand immediate reporting is essential, as is the open sharing of virus samples to facilitate rapid \nidentification of the virus subtype and, when needed, preparation of an effective human vaccine. \n \n4. \nIt has generally been acknowledged that at present many governments are not ready to \ncope with avian influenza outbreaks, much less a human pandemic. Increasing preparedness is \nvital in every country and in every region. As the disease can easily cross borders, it has been \nrecognized  that  there  is  a  need  for  all  countries  and  regions  to  develop  comprehensive  plans \nthat  integrate  interventions  related  to  animal  and  human  health.  These  plans  should  also \nconsider  possible  disruptions  to  essential  services  in  case  of  a  pandemic  and  strengthen \nexisting  surveillance  systems  and  response  mechanisms.  The  international  community  has \nproposed that these plans can become the basis for coordinated financial and technical support \nfrom bilateral donors and international agencies, with current plans for a major meeting focusing \non financing needs in January 2006.  \n \n5. \nBecause  of  the  evolving  nature  of  support,  it  is  difficult  to  accurately  measure  the \ncontribution  of  each  financier.  Contributions  have  been  made  to  international  organizations, \nprimarily  the  Food  and  Agricultural  Organization  (FAO)  and  the  World  Health  Organization \n(WHO), directly to governments in affected countries, and through existing and bilateral disease \ncontrol programs. Significant resources have been pledged, subject to the design of the project. \nMany of the resources have been committed in kind, including expert visits, training fellowships, \nand  the  donation  of  equipment  and  supplies.  It  appears  that  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region  have \n\n                                                 \n1 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nreceived most of the contributions. Below is a summary of some of the major contributions and \npledges to date, based estimates from the FAO2 and ADB staff review.  \n \n6. \nAsian  Development  Bank.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided \nemergency  assistance  to  the  governments  of  Cambodia,  Lao\u2019s  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic \n(Lao PDR), and Viet Nam through a regional technical assistance program of around $200,000. \nIt  is  also  supporting  a  communicable  disease  response  team  based  at  WHO  that  has  been \ninstrumental in supporting surveillance and response of affected countries. ADB has committed \n$68  million  in  new  health  projects  that  can  be  \u201cretrofitted\u201d  to  support  avian  influenza  control \nactivities, at least $75 million in additional resources from project savings and reallocations, and \nan additional $300 million in new loans, if requested by affected countries.  \n \nA  grant  for  Regional  Communicable  Diseases  Control  Project  for  the  countries  of \n7. \nCambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam was approved on 21 November 2005 for $30 million. The \nProject  will  strengthen  the  regional  capacity  to  control  emerging  and  endemic  communicable \ndiseases  within  the  framework  for  regional  collaboration.  It  will  (i)  strengthen  national \nsurveillance and response systems, (ii) develop models of communicable diseases surveillance \nand control in different provinces based on local priorities, and (ii) improve regional collaboration \nin  communicable  diseases  control  (CDC)  and  health  system  development.  The  targeted \nprovinces  are  important  for  CDC  in  terms  of  regional  connectivity,  high  burden  of  infectious \ndiseases, and the level of vulnerable populations. \n \n8. \nAustralia.  The  Government  of  Australia  has  been  one  of  the  largest  contributors  to \navian  influenza  prevention  and  control  activities.  As  of  October  2005,  it  has  allocated  around \n$19.2  million,  largely  through  regional  organizations  and  international  technical  organizations \nsuch  as  WHO  and  FAO.  Support  has  included  equipment,  experts,  and  supplies.  It  has  also \nintensified training of national experts to strengthen the technical capacity of affected countries. \nThis  includes  support  at  the  regional  level  and  at  the  country  level.  Indonesia  has  been  the \nlargest single recipient of support. In January 2006, it committed around $75 million.  \n \n9. \nGermany.  The  Government  of  Germany  has  provided  around  $7  million  (as  of  May \n2005), largely to support the implementation of the global strategy. Germany has also provided \nsupport  at  the  country  level,  largely  through  trusts  funds  at  FAO.  Germany  plans  to  allocate \naround  $28  million  to  support  scientific  research  and  pandemic  preparedness,  largely  in \nSoutheast Asia.  \n \nJapan. Japan has been very active in providing regional and national support, working \n10. \nwith  governments  and  international  organizations  such  as  ADB  and  the  World  Bank.  It  has \ncommitted  $10  million  to  ADB  for  its  regional  project  and  more  than  $4  million  to  other \norganizations,  through  existing  trust  funds.  This  aid  has  largely  focused  on  Viet  Nam  and \nregional  activities.  Japan  has  also  provided  significant  support  in  kind.  In  January  2006  it \ncommitted  around  $135  million,  including  a  contribution  to  the  World  Bank\u2019s  multi-donor  trust \nfund.  \n \nUnited  States.  Working  mainly  at  the  regional  level,  the  Government  of  the  United \n11. \nStates  has  provided  substantial  support  to  international  organizations  and  directly  through \nsupport  from  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \n\n                                                 \n2   FAO/OIE/WHO  \u201cGlobal  Strategy  for  the  Progressive  Control  of  Highly  Pathogenic  Avian  Influenza  (HPAI)\u201d \nAvailable at http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/subjects/documents/ai/HPAIGlobalStrategy31Oct05.pdf, accessed on 24 \nNovember 2005. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n39 \n\nincludes  support \n\nto  strengthen  community,  national,  and  regional \nDevelopment.  This \nsurveillance  systems  and  the  provision  of  protective  gear.  The  United  States  has,  to  date, \ncommitted around $13 million.  \n \nCanada.  Directly  affected  during  the  SARS  epidemic  in  2003,  the  Government  of \n12. \nCanada rapidly reacted to reduce the threat of emerging infectious diseases in Southeast Asia \nand  China.  Through  the  Public  Health  Agency  of  Canada,  the  Government  has  prepared  the \nCanada-Asia  Regional  Emerging  Infectious  Diseases  (CAREID)  project.  The  project,  financed \nby  a  CD  15.0  million  grant,  aims  at  strengthening  regional  and  national  capacity  in  emerging \ninfectious  disease  surveillance  and  response  and  in  epidemic  preparedness,  in  close \ncollaboration with WHO. Both CAREID and the ADB project have adopted a regional approach \nto strengthen capacity. Both projects are complementary, with the ADB project also addressing \nemergency and unexpected needs.  \n \n13. \nThe  World  Bank.  The  World  Bank  has  been  active  in  providing  support  for  avian \ninfluenza  since  2004.  This  support  includes  substantial  assistance  to  Viet  Nam  (including  a \ngrant  from  Japan)  of  around  $6  million  and  the  organization  of  regional  level  activities  and \nconferences.  The  World  Bank  has  prepared  an  avian  influenza  finance  facility,  which  was \napproved  in  January  2006  for  $500  million  that  will  serve  as  the  main  source  of  funds  for \ninterested  countries.  Several  countries  have  expressed  interest  in  utilizing  the  resources  from \nthis facility and the World Bank is preparing several country-specific projects. The World Bank \nhas also established a multi-donor grant trust fund to provide grant assistance.

The  prevalence  of  avian  and  human \ninfluenza will be reduced by (i) strengthening national capacities for containing and preventing \navian  and  human  influenza  outbreaks;  (ii)  enhancing  regional  cooperation  and  communication \nthrough  support  to  regional  networks,  information  exchange,  and  risk  communication  strategy; \nand  (iii)  supporting  regional  stockpiles  of  drugs  and  equipment.  Regional  activities  will  be \nimplemented  by  regional  partners  that  have  a  network  of  technical  expertise  in  place,  namely \nAssociation  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN),  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  (FAO), \nand World Health Organization (WHO). This appendix outlines details of activities in Component \n2:  Regional  Cooperation.  The  indicative  activities  in  this  appendix  are  taken  from  WHO  and \nFAO proposals1 submitted to ADB at the time of project preparation. \n \nA. \n \ninfluenza  pandemic \n2. \npreparedness  plans,  additional  efforts  are  required  to  strengthen  activities  to  address  regional \nissues  (e.g.,  management  of  borders,  establishment  of  regional  networks,  etc.).  Support  to \nregional networks help to (i) control or prevent the virus or disease in already infected regions in \nAsia, and prepare regions at new risk of the virus or disease as it spreads beyond the region. \nRegional  networks  help  support  coordination  of  early  warning,  and  disease  surveillance  and \ndisease diagnosis at subregional levels. The Project will support WHO and FAO in developing \nand  strengthening  regional  activities  under  this  subcomponent.  Subcomponent  2.1  seeks  to \nimprove coordination between affected countries and technical agencies for regular exchange of \nepidemiological information, laboratory specimen, and supplies.  \n \n\nSubcomponent 2.1: Improved Technical Coordination \n\nindividual  countries  prepare  or  update \n\ntheir  human \n\nWhile \n\na. \n\nStrengthening Laboratory Networks \n\n3. \nRegional Laboratory  Networking  (WHO). The purpose of this activity is to strengthen \nlaboratory  capacity  by  developing  and  maintaining  a  regional  laboratory  network  to  support \ndiagnosis and antiviral resistance monitoring. The Project will support WHO activities that lead \nto improved capacity building at the regional level. A list of indicative activities includes:  \n \n\nDevelopment  of  standard  operating  procedures  (SOPs).  A  regional  meeting  to \nagree  on  guidelines  and  SOPs  concerning  specimen  collection,  storage, \ntransport, testing, and reporting of results. Participants include national laboratory \nheads,  international  influenza  reference  laboratories,  representatives  from \ninternational airlines and courier services.  \nCosts to cover the international shipment of specimens, such as courier services, \npurchase of appropriate packing materials and containers. \nDevelopment  of  training  material  and  training  courses  for  national  laboratory \nprofessionals.  Training  courses  to  ensure  uniformity  in  testing  techniques  and \nfacilitating  the  establishment  of  a  network  of  laboratory  personnel.  Participants \ninclude  laboratory  technicians  from  Asia  ad  the  Pacific  region  to  develop \ncommon  protocols.

The purpose of this activity is to support regional networks of national diagnostic \nlaboratories and epidemio-surveillance teams for the control and prevention of avian influenza. \nThe  presence  of  H5N1  virus  in  Southeast  Asia  continues  to  threaten  the  poultry  industry  and \npublic  health  of  humans.  It  puts  at  risk  other  regions  that  come  in  contact  with  infected  birds \nthrough  trade  or  migratory  flyways.  Coordination  is  needed  at  many  level,  including  field  and \ncentral/national  level,  among  veterinary  diagnostic  laboratories  and  epidemiology  teams. \nRegional  networks  provide  technical  support  to  national  staff  to  help  improve  the  quality  of \nsurveillance and diagnosis. One national laboratory and one epidemio-surveillance team will be \nchosen to lead the regional group. According to FAO, this approach has proven to be successful \nin other circumstances, such as the rinderpest eradication campaigns in Asia and Africa.  \n \n5. \n \n\nThe Project will help support FAO activities aimed at \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nthe  OIE-FAO \n\nthe  support  of \n\npromoting  and  coordinating  harmonized  regional  approaches  for  early  detection \nand reporting through regional coordination centers;  \ndeveloping and implementing a proficiency testing system for national veterinary \nInternational  Reference \nlaboratories  with \nLaboratories and Collaborating Centers for Avian Influenza (OFFLU);  \nestablishing  sustainable  networks,  bringing  together  veterinary  officials  and \nexperts  from  the  national  diagnostic  laboratories  and  epidemio-surveillance \nteams and build their capacity to support the above;  \ndeveloping  data  analysis  and  disease  intelligence  capacity  in  order  to  better \nunderstand  the  epidemiology  of  the  disease  and  prepare  risk  maps  to  allow \nimplementation of targeted surveillance and control programs; and  \napplying improved epidemiological capacity to revise strategies and improve the \neffectiveness of disease control activities.  \n\n \n6. \nSpecific  activities  include  development  of  linkages  with  regional  organizations  and \nnational  and  international  animal  health  organizations,  conducting  strategic  and  technical \nmeetings,  providing  training  tools  and  training,  procuring  equipment,  information  and  data \ncollection and management, enhancing exchange of information and sharing of lessons learned \nin influenza control, supporting the planning for national avian influenza control and emergency \npreparedness, and support for the implementation of avian influenza control programs \n \n7. \nSpecific  activities  might  include  workshops,  institutional  capacity  building,  training, \nstudies,  information  sharing  with  international  agencies,  and  recommendations  to  regional \norganizations  and  survey  design  institutes.  The  Regional  Support  Unit  for  East  Asia  will \ncoordinate  activities  and  ensure  that  an  appropriate  level  of  technical  assistance  is  provided. \nIndicative areas for study include trade impacts of outbreaks in the region, structure of poultry \nmarkets, livelihoods, poverty and gender impacts of control measures adopted, direct costs of \ncontrol  measures  adopted,  assumptions  underlying  control  strategies  including  perceptions  of \nrisk and veterinary services capacity, and/or potential benefits over time from control measures. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n43 \n\nSubcomponent 2.2: Regional Field Response and Containment Capacity \n\nB. \n \n8. \nSubcomponent 2.2 seeks to (i) strengthen rapid field response and containment capacity \nat the regional level, and (ii) support pandemic influenza preparedness through information and \ncommunication technology (ICT).  \n \n9. \nRapid  Response  and  Containment  (WHO).  The  importance  of  rapid  response \ncapabilities for infectious diseases and other emergencies is highlighted by the recent emerging \ninfectious  diseases  and  preparations  for  future  infectious  diseases.  Pooling  of  experience, \nexpertise  and  resources  is  essential  for  cost-effectiveness  given  the  great  deal  of  uncertainty \nabout the future course of avian influenza at present. Global tools, such as the Global Outbreak \nAlert  and  Response  Network  (GOARN)  and  the  International  Health  Regulations  (IHR),  have \nbeen developed to facilitate more effective international responses. While some recent outbreak \nresponses for avian influenza have proceeded well, others have been relatively disjointed.  \n \n10. \n \n\nThe Project will support WHO activities aimed at  \n\nstrengthening regional and national capacities for surveillance, rapid containment \nof  avian  influenza  breakouts,  human  influenza  surveillance,  case  identification \nand management through training; and  \nimproving  coordination  between  countries  and  technical  agencies  for  regular \nexchange of epidemiological information, laboratory specimens, and supplies.  \n\nSpecific activities might include the following: \n\nStrengthening  WHO/GOARN  capacity  and  readiness  to  support  countries \nthrough  field  teams  and  national  responders.  This  requires  (a)  developing \nstandard operating procedures for technical guidelines and operational protocols; \n(b)  conducting  a  training  course  for  cadre  of  100  national  and  international \noutbreak response; and (c) undertaking a field exercise. \nAdapting a field information management system (FIMS) to deliver accurate and \nconsistent  information  to  public  health  staff  on  the  epidemiology,  investigation, \ntreatment and control of outbreaks of avian influenza infection in humans.  \nDeveloping WHO/GOARN virtual networks for epidemiology, social mobilization, \nclinical management and logistics for support to countries and field teams. \nImplementing  field  logistics,  mobility  and  communications  to  support  rapid \noutbreak  response  in  field  operations  (e.g.,  delivery  of  emergency  medical \nsupplies, vaccines and antivirals). \nDeveloping  SOPs  for  procurement  and  mobilization  of  vaccine  and  supplies, \ndrugs  and  medical  equipment,  deployment  of  specialist  outbreak  response \nequipment, outbreak response logistics capacity and field experience. \nAccelerating  the  expansion  of  GOARN  partnership  and  developing  regional \nSOPs (e.g., trigger mechanisms and capacity for rapid response).  \n\n12.  WHO,  in  partnership  with  individual  countries,  will  rely  on  its  network  of  country  and \nregional  offices,  and  headquarters  to  implement  a  global  public  health  response  to  a  possible \nhuman  influenza  pandemic.  WHO  proposes  to  form  regionally-based  acute  infectious  disease \nresponse teams, which will be mobilized when a country requests assistance from WHO.  \n \n13. \nICT for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (WHO). Preparing for a pandemic of avian \ninfluenza requires that resources and capacities are organized to be able to meet the expected \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n11. \n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nhealth  threats  of  people  in  affected  or  at-risk  countries.  ICT  is  a  core  function  and  service  for \nemergency  response;  therefore,  consideration  should  be  given  in  preparing  the  following \nareas\u2014telecommunications, facilities, equipment, systems, and staffing.  \n \nNetwork  Connectivity.  Reliable  data  and  voice  communications  tools  are  helpful  to \n14. \ndeliver  preventative  programs,  which  rely  heavily  on  health  experts  sharing  information  and \nknowledge. Different modes of communication (e.g., data, email, voice and video conferencing) \nwill  help  deliver  key  messages  in  countries  and  the  region;  and  thus,  assist  in  managing  and \ncontaining  a  possible  pandemic.  The  WHO  has  been  developing  and  implementing  a  network \nover the past 2 years to help guarantee connectivity during times of emergency. This network \nhas connected some 82 countries worldwide, and there are plans to reach another 60 over the \nnext 6 months. This network provides data, voice, and video.  \n \nC. \n \n15. \nrisk \ncommunication  efforts  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  Region.  The  Project  will  support  DMCs  and \ncomplement  ongoing  UNICEF  program  aimed  at  ensuring  timely  (i)  sharing  of  information \namong the ministries of health and WHO in accordance with IHR provisions and other agreed \nprotocols \ninterventions,  and  (ii)  accurate \ndissemination of information to the general public to aid in adapting appropriate behaviors and \nminimize  unnecessary  adverse  consequences  on  the  health  and  economies  of  affected \npopulations. Two indicative activities are included: \n \n\nRisk  Communication  Strategy.  Subcomponent  2.3  seeks \n\nSubcomponent 2.3: Risk Communication \n\nimplementation  of  appropriate \n\nto  enhance \n\nto  assist \n\nin \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nTranslation  into  local  dialects,  reproduction  and  distribution  of  advocacy  materials, \nguidelines and other IEC materials to ensure quality of translated materials, reduced \nburden on countries, and appropriateness for target groups. \nDevelopment  of  generic \nrisk \ncommunication  material.  Prototype  material  for  risk  communication  will  also  be \ndeveloped  and  disseminated  to  individual  countries  for  development  of  country-\nspecific material according to their risk communication strategy. \n\nrisk  communication  strategy  and  prototype \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n45 \n\nOPERATIONAL DETAILS OF SUPPORT FOR AVIAN INFLUENZA RESPONSE FACILITY \n\n \nA. \n\nThe Fund \n\nThe  Project  will  support  in  a  flexible  manner  emerging  initiatives  to  control  both  avian \n1. \nand human influenza. Component 3 will have a $14.5 million to allow ADB to respond quickly to \nthe emerging needs of developing member countries. This will be used to address emergency \ntechnical needs for preventing and controlling avian and human influenza in developing member \ncountries. Due to the evolving nature of the epidemic and considerable uncertainties associated \nwith  the  epidemic,  the  use  of  the  Avian  Influenza  Response  Facility  (AIREF)  has  been  kept \nflexible. AIREF will be used for the following type of activities: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nEmergency needs for containing avian influenza outbreaks,  \nEmergency needs for responding to human influenza outbreaks, and  \nSupport for regional stockpiles of essential drugs and equipment, \n\n1. \n\nEmergency Containment of Avian Influenza Outbreaks \n\n2. \nThe global strategy to control avian influenza and prevent a human influenza pandemic \nstarts  with  the  controlling  the  infection  at  source  and  effectively  containing  avian  influenza \noutbreaks  among  poultry.  The  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  (FAO)  and  the  World \nOrganization  for  Animal  Health  (OIE)  recommend  culling  of  all  domestic  birds  in  those  areas \nwhere  a  Highly  Pathogenic  Avian  Influenza  (HPAI)  virus  is  suspected  or  has  been  identified. \nStrict measures of control are also required, including quarantine of the affected area. In some \ncircumstances, when the HPAI virus (in this case, H5N1) is entrenched and avian influenza has \nbecome endemic, poultry vaccination is the alternative.  \n \n3. \nEmergency  containment,  either  through  culling  of  poultry,  quarantine,  or  emergency \nvaccination  of  poultry  requires  planning  and  preparedness.  As  soon  as  an  avian  influenza \noutbreak  is  reported,  the  Governments  have  to  deploy  teams  to  contain  it.  Window  of \nopportunity for effectively containing the outbreak is usually small. However, even  when plans \nare  ready,  there  may  be  delays  in  undertaking  containment  measures  due  to  lack  of  training, \npoor  planning,  and  lack  of  financial  resources  to  implement  the  plan  and  cover  logistics  and \noperational  costs.  The  AIREF  will  cover  these  emergency  needs,  on  the  request  of  the \nGovernment, through government agencies, participating international organizations, and other \npartners.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEmergency Containment of Human Influenza Outbreaks \n\n4. \nHuman influenza pandemic is likely to start within small clusters with limited human-to-\nhuman  transmission  but  the  spread  will  remain  localized  for  sometime  during  which  virus  will \nadapt  to  humans.  This  corresponds  to  phase  4  (highly  localized  clusters)  and  phase  5  (larger \nclusters, still localized) of the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) global surveillance system. In \nthese circumstances, WHO considers that the countries will have a window of about 20 days to \nstop  a  human  influenza  pandemic.  It  is  important  that  countries  be  ready  to  react  and  that \npreparedness  action  plan  be  developed  in  details,  with  clear  instructions  for  all  stakeholders. \nHowever, it will be critical that cash flow impediments do not delay the rapid implementation of \nthe  plan  at  the  onset  of  limited  human-to-human  transmission.  The  AIREF  with  rapid \ndisbursement  mechanisms  will  ensure  that  cash  is  immediately  available  to  the  countries  that \nneed it in emergency. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n3. \n\nRegional Stockpiles \n\n5. \nProcurement  and  stockpiling  of  essential  drugs  and  equipment  at  the  regional  level  to \nfight  a  possible  human  influenza  pandemic  is  a  cost-effective  option.  Given  the  uncertainties \nabout the timing, geographical coverage, length and severity of the epidemic, all countries may \nnot ultimately need the drugs and some may eventually need only a limited quantity. Therefore, \nit  may  not  be  cost-effective  for  each  country  to  stockpile  large  quantities  of  drugs  and \nequipments.  A  regional  arrangement  for  the  supply  of  essential  drugs  and  equipment  is \nconsidered a cost-effective option. Moreover, smaller countries may find it difficult to effectively \nnegotiate with pharmaceutical companies on their own and obtain the necessary drugs, supplies \nand equipment for fighting the epidemic. A regional arrangement for collective bargaining with \npharmaceutical companies has a better chance of succeeding.  \n \n6. \nWHO is planning to establish such a regional stockpile. At this stage, regional stockpile \nof  antiviral  drugs  (Oseltamivir  or  Tamiflu\u00ae),  essential  antibiotics,  and  personal  protective \nequipment are being considered. Stockpiling of other items may also be considered, according \nto  recommendations  of  technical  agencies  (WHO  and  FAO).  Logistics,  supply  arrangements, \ncriteria  and  mechanism  for  deploying  the  stocks  are  being  worked  out  to  ensure  safe  storage \nand  quick  delivery  of  drug  and  equipment  as  soon  as  an  outbreak  is  reported.  Advance \npurchase  contracts  with  suppliers  will  be  used  to  ensure  delivery  on  demand  and  save  on \ntransportation  and  storage  costs.  Financing  needs  for  regional  stockpiles  are  expected  to  be \nlarge.  AIREF  will  be  able  to  finance  only  part  of  these  needs  and  will  contribute  to  larger \nregional initiatives.  \n \nB. \n\nManagement of AIREF \n\nAIREF will receive $9.7 million from Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants1, $0.6 million \n7. \nfrom  the  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund,  and  $4.2  million  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund \n(JSF).  The  support  from  ADF  will  only  be  used  for  ADF-eligible  countries  and  will  focus  on \nproviding  a  range  of  support  to  these  countries,  including  the  purchase  of  drugs,  medical \nsupplies,  and  equipment.  It  may  also  support  the  financial  needs  of  the  animal  and  human \nhealth  system  to  ensure  that  there  is  adequate  support  for  their  operation.  Other  countries, \nwhich  are  not  eligible  for  ADF-financing,  will  receive  support  from  TASF  and  JSF  largely  for \ntechnical  capacity  building  activities,  such  as  training,  support  for  planning,  and  contracting \nexperts.  TASF  and  JSF  may  also  support  activities  in  ADF-eligible  countries,  in  particular  for \nactivities that largely involve technical capacity building.  \n \n8. \nThe steering committee comprising the heads of all regional departments and Strategy \nand  Policy  Department  and  chaired  by  the  director  general  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department will supervise the implementation and use of AIREF and provide the \noverall  policy  guidance.  The  steering  committee  will  decide  when  a  country  or  the  region \nbecomes  eligible  for  use  of  emergency  resources  under  AIREF.  The  steering  committee  will \nreport  to  the  ADB  management  committee.  The  steering  committee  will  meet  at  least  once \nevery  3  months  and  may  be  called  to  meet  more  often,  by  the  chair.  Each  member  of  the \nsteering committee shall nominate at least one alternate to ensure that the steering committee \ncan meet in the case of an emergency at short notice.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1 Through the Asian Development Fund\u2019s support for the prevention of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n47 \n\nThe  AI  secretariat  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  Project  and \n\nADB\u2019s  avian  influenza  secretariat  will  provide  the  necessary  advice  to  the  steering \n9. \ncommittee when requested or needed. The avian influenza (AI) secretariat may also call upon \nother ADB staff's expertise according to the needs. \n \n10. \nadministrative tasks. \n \n11. \nRequest  for  funds  to  procure  drugs,  supplies  or  equipment  for  stockpiling  will  be \ntransmitted  to  the  AI  secretariat  for technical  review  and  assessment.  The  steering committee \nwill  take  the  final  decision.  The  AI  secretariat  will  consolidate  its  review  assessment  within  2 \ndays  of  receiving  the  request  from  the  concerned  country  or  regional  agency.  The  steering \ncommittee will decide within 2 days of receiving the secretariat assessment. \n \n12. \nThe secretariat will also decide about allocation of funds to the affected countries up to \n$100,000.  For  amounts  more  than  $100,000,  the  decisions  will  be  made  by  the  steering \ncommittee. \n \n13. \nThe  secretariat  will  prepare  a  monthly  report  to  inform  the  management  about  the \nprogress  of  the  Project  and  utilization  of  AIREF.  A  midterm-review  of  the  AIREF  will  be \nundertaken in December 2006, and changes in the use of funds, eligibility criteria, and fund flow \narrangements may be made, as appropriate. \n \nIf emerging needs require new Project activities during implementation that may have an \n14. \nimpact  on  environment,  resettlement, \nindigenous  people,  or  other  vulnerable  groups, \nimplementing  partners  will  each  inform  ADB  and  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  for  approval \nappropriate  impact  assessment  and  mitigating  plans,  before  requesting  financing  for  that \nparticular activity. This shall be included in new or amended grant agreements.  \n \nC. \n\nFund Flow Arrangements \n\n15. \nFor supporting regional stockpiles, the funds will be transferred to the identified technical \nagency (likely to be WHO), based on a specific request from the agency. ADB will ensure that \nappropriate  logistics  and  supply  arrangements  are  in  place  before  the  release  of  funds. \nAgreements  on  procurement  arrangements,  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  also  be  reached  with  the \nresponsible technical agency. \n \n16. \nfollowed: \n \n\nFor  the  emergency  containment  of  outbreaks,  the  following  arrangements  will  be \n\nDepending  on  the  need,  resident  missions  may  be  authorized  to  approve  and \ndisburse a specified amount by the steering committee based on specific request \nfor emergency assistance from the Government or technical agency.  \n\nThe  AIREF  support  will  be  primarily  used  for  logistics  and  operational  purpose, \nsuch as purchase of gasoline and per diem for emergency team to visit outbreak \nareas, etc. \n\nThe  AIREF  can  also  be  used  for  the  procurement  of  goods  and  supplies.  The \nsteering committee may authorize country directors to procure the needed goods \nand supplies, if appropriate. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\n(v) \n\n(iv)  WHO and FAO will also be involved, as appropriate, and kept informed. \n\nDetailed guidelines will be developed to ensure that the AIREF responds to only \nemergency needs for activities in line with national plans for containing avian and \nhuman  influenza.  All  the  Governments  and  technical  agencies  will  be  informed \nthe process for seeking support from AIREF. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n49 \n\nGRANT RATIONALE AND PURPOSE \n\nRationale \n\n \n \n \nThe  Project  will  receive  financing  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  $38 \n1. \nmillion from its Special Funds resources (ADF IX Grant Program). ADF has allocated 2% of its \nresources  (an  estimated  $140  million)  to  reduce  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  and  other  infectious \ndiseases  for  ADF-eligible  countries.  ADF  grant  financing  for  HIV/AIDS  and  other  infectious \ndiseases is available to all ADF-eligible DMCs. \n \nA. \n \nAvian  influenza  is  a  highly  communicable  disease  that  spreads  among  domestic  and \n2. \nwild  bird  population.  Although  it  has  spread  to  humans,  it  does  not  easily  transmit  among \nhumans.  However,  if  the  virus  mutates  or  recombines  with  a  human  influenza  virus,  it  could \neasily spread among humans. Avian influenza is a major risk to the human and economic health \nto  the  region.  If  it  spreads  unchecked,  it  could  seriously  harm  the  region\u2019s  poverty  reduction \nagenda and potentially lead to the loss of several years of progress.  \n \n3. \n The  Project  will  contribute  to  efforts  to  reduce  the  risk  from  avian  influenza.  This \nincludes  support  for  prevention  activities  and,  in  the  case  of  pandemic  influenza,  efforts  to \ncontrol  and  minimize  the  spread  of  the  virus.  Both  of  these  activities  will  contribute  to  the \nregion\u2019s  efforts  to  reach  the  Millennium  Development  Goals.  Limiting  the  spread  of  avian \ninfluenza  will  protect  the  livelihoods  of  millions  and  halting  the  spread  of  a  human  influenza \npandemic will directly impact on the health and welfare of everybody in the region. The Project \nis regional in nature and will focus in supporting regional public goods.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThese are the following:  \n \n\nThe  Project  has  four  components,  all  of  which  will  receive  finance  from  ADF  grant. \n\nProposed Grant Activities \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nComponent  1:  Regional  Capacity  Building.  This  component  will  support \nregional  and  international  organizations  in  the  efforts  to  support  countries \nrespond to avian influenza.  \nComponent  2:  Regional  Coordination.  This  component  will  support  efforts  to \nimprove  the  region\u2019s  efforts  to  improve  coordination  in  research,  surveillance, \nand  prevention  activities.  It  will  also  support  efforts  to  improve  communication \nand the transparent sharing of information.  \nComponent  3:  Avian  Influenza  Response  Facility.  This  component  will \nprovide  support  that  can  be  used  flexibly  to  meet  the  region\u2019s  needs  for  avian \ninfluenza  prevention  and  control.  The  Project  will  respond  to  request  made  by \ndeveloping  member  countries  for  support  and  to  regional  and  international \norganizations for support of new initiatives.  \nComponent 4: Project Management  \n\n(iv) \n \nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nC. \n \n5. \nand monitoring framework (Appendix 1).  \n\nGrant-supported activities will be monitored through the indicators in the Project\u2019s design \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \n\nTable A9.1: Financing Plan by Source \n($ \u2018000) \n\nADF \nGrant \n\nTASF \nGrant a \n\nJSF \nGrant \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n \n\nSubtotal (3) \n\nSubtotal (1) \n\n     3,501 \n     5,276 \n     8,777 \n\n     1,352 \n     3,156 \n          -  \n     4,508 \n\nAvian Influenza Response Facility \n \n\nRegional Coordination  \na. \nb. \nc. \n \n\nSupport Containing Infection-at-Source \nSupport for Preventing for Potential Pandemic \n \n\nBase Costs \nRegional Capacity Building \na. \nb. \n \n\nImproved Technical Coordination \nRapid Field Response and Containment Capacity \nRisk Communication \nSubtotal (2) \n \n\n \n \n         187  \n        281  \n         468  \n \n \n        772  \n         768  \n         200  \n      1,740  \n \n \n         600  \n \n \n \n      2,808  \n \n \n \n           33  \n         159  \n         192  \n \n      3,000  \n \nADF = Asian Development Fund, JSF = Japan Special Fund, TASF = Technical Assistance Special Fund. \na   No country may receive more than $2 million from TASF or JSF (combined) directly from this Project.  \nb   Based on the international cost escalation factors for 2005\u20132009. \nc   Estimated at 6.0% of Project Costs of components 1,2, and 4.  \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nContingencies \nPrice Contingencies b \nPhysical Contingencies c \nSubtotal \n\nProject Management  \n \n \nSubtotal \n\n       205 \n     1,010 \n     1,215 \n\n       800 \n       800 \n   23,785 \n\nSubtotal (4) \n\n     9,700 \n\n   25,000 \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     1,400 \n     2,110 \n     3,511 \n\n     5,088 \n     7,668 \n   12,756 \n\n        541 \n     1,262 \n            -  \n     1,803 \n\n     2,665 \n     5,186 \n        200 \n     8,051 \n\n     4,200 \n\n     9,514 \n\n   14,500 \n            -  \n        800 \n        800 \n   36,107 \n\n          82 \n        404 \n        486 \n\n        320 \n     1,573 \n     1,893 \n\n   10,000 \n\n   38,000 \n\n  \n \n\n \nItem \nA. \n1. \n \n \n \n \n2. \n \n \n \n \n \n3. \n \n \n4. \n \n \n \n \nB. \n1. \n2. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n51 \n\nTable A9.2: Financing Plan by Destination \n($\u2019000) \n \n\n \nItem \nFood and Agriculture Organization \nWorld Health Organization \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations \nAsian Development Bank \n\nTotal \n\nADF \nGrant a \n         4,488 \n         8,630 \n            234 \n       11,648 \n       25,000 \n\nTASF \nGrant b \n         231 \n         445 \n          12 \n      2,312 \n3,000\n\nJSF \nGrant \n     1,771  \n     3,404  \n          92  \n     4,733  \n   10,000  \n\nTotal \n\n \n     6,490 \n   12,479 \n       338 \n   18,693 \n   38,000 \n\nADF = Asian Development Fund, JSF = Japan Special Fund, TASF = Technical Assistance Special \nFund. \na  ADF grants may only be allocated directly to ADF-eligible countries.

identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?  \n\n Yes \n No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?  \n\n Yes \n No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Asia and the Pacific Region: \n \nPoverty  reduction  in  the  region  has  been  due  to  rapid  economic  growth  and  significant  human  capital  investment \n(e.g.,  health  and  education). A  human  influenza  pandemic  in  the  region  could  slow  down,  and  even  stagnate,  the \nrate of economic growth in the region. A pandemic could lead to poor human and animal health, a rise in deaths, \nand a subsequent loss of livelihoods and income. The Project  will make an important contribution to minimize the \nprobability of an outbreak of new strain of human influenza through support of preventive activities. It will also help \nto mitigate the harm caused by such an outbreak by supporting efforts aim to control and minimize the spread of the \nvirus. The Project contributes to the region\u2019s ongoing efforts towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nTargeting Classification: Targeted intervention  \nThe region has seen a substantial reduction in poverty over the past two decades, built on rapid economic growth \nand significant investment in human capital. A pandemic in the region threatens to reverse this process. The avian \ninfluenza  (AI)  outbreak  has  already  affected  the  livelihood  of  small-scale  poultry  farmers  in  the  region.  In  the \nMekong  subregion  alone,  the  outbreak  is  estimated  to  have  cost  about  $580  million  in  the  poultry  sector  through \nMarch  2005,  excluding  the  loss  due  to  trade  restrictions.  The  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  (FAO)  has \nestimated  the  total  cost  of  the  outbreak  around  $10  billion.  In  case  the  virus  mutates  or  combines  with  a  human \ninfluenza virus, the spread of  AI in humans  and  possible  human influenza pandemic could  disrupt, if not stall, the \ncurrent rate of economic growth in the region. The impact on the economy could include higher unemployment rates \nand reduced wages, and an increase in poverty. Households, especially those engaged in the poultry sector, would \nsuffer immediate loss of livelihoods and subsequent decline in household income. Many families might be caused to \nsell  their  productive  assets  or  dip  into  their  savings  to  pay  for  medical  care  of  sick  family  members.  The  cost  of \nhealthcare associated with prevention and treatment could strain weak social protection and health systems in many \ncountries.  The  loss  of  income  from  those  who  are  unable  to  work  and/or  might  subsequently  die  will  also  have  a \nlong-term impact on declining household incomes. The burden of caring for sick family members could increase for \nwomen  and  young  girls.  The  poor  and  disadvantaged,  in  particular,  have  less  access  to  both  public  and  private \nhealth services, suffer from a higher burden of disease, and face an increased risk of becoming further marginalized \nwhen faced with high cost of medical care, loss of economic livelihoods, and in household income.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \n A stakeholder analysis was undertaken to help identify key project stakeholders, their project-related interests and \nthe  ways  in  which  they  affect  project  feasibility  and  success.  Primary  stakeholders  include  regional  technical \npartners, line ministries involved in health and agriculture, preventive health staff and veterinarians at different levels \n(e.g.,  national,  provincial,  district,  lower  community  levels  such  as  communes),  and  communities.  Secondary \nstakeholders  include  country  offices  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  technical  partners.  An \ninterdepartmental  avian  influenza  (AI)  task  force  was  established  to  (i)  assess  the  impact  of  AI  under  different \nscenarios,  (ii)  assess  the  needs  of  further  ADB  assistance  among  member  countries,  and  (iii)  further  develop \npreparedness  planning  in  the  region.  The  Task  Force  consulted  internally  within  ADB,  and  externally  with \ngovernments,  regional  and  country  partners,  and  technical  agencies.  The  establishment  of  a  stockpile  for  drugs, \nequipment and supplies will help ensure coordination among development partners and countries in the allocation of \nessential  technical  assistance  and  supplies.  Information  on  the  AI  is  posted  on  the  ADB  website  for  public \ninformation and knowledge exchange.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \n.A participation strategy is integrated into the overall Project design. A project cell will be established within ADB\u2014AI \nsecretariat\u2014to provide technical feedback and manage administration tasks. A project steering committee, chaired \nby  the  director  general  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department,  will  comprise  the  directors \ngeneral  of  all  five  regional  operational  departments  and  the  Strategy  and  Policy  Department.  ADB  will  coordinate \ninternally with a project steering committee and will liaison with regional technical partners, ADB resident mission or \nits  equivalent,  regional  cooperation  agencies,  and  other  international  partners.  In  order  for  the  Project  to  be \nresponsive to the needs of the region and country, consultations with key stakeholders in the government and in the \nfield of human and animal health will continue during implementation. The project will strengthen coordination and \nsurveillance  activities  of  human  and  animal  health  experts.  Support  to  regional  technical  partners  will  involve \nconsultations with communities, including assistance in the development of compensation guidelines for money lost \n\n Yes  \n\n Yes \n\n No  \n\n No \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n59\n\n \n\ndue to poultry deaths.  \nIn addition, coordination with other agencies and mass organizations working with vulnerable communities will help \ndeliver risk communication strategies planned under component 2. The Project will improve information, education, \nand communication (IEC) materials and behavior change communication (BCC) efforts for target populations at risk \nor affected by AI. The importance of providing good quality of care through frontline health staff will help ensure the \nappropriateness of services for different at-risk or affected groups.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \nIn  the  region,  women  often  comprise  more  than  half  of  the  region\u2019s  population.  The  burden  of  disease  profile  for \ndisadvantaged  groups,  especially  women,  remains  heavily  influenced  by  common  communicable  and  infectious \ndiseases,  and  by  morbidity  and  mortality  associated  with  childbearing.  Preventive  health  staff  and  laboratory \ntechnicians  are  often  women.  In  the  poultry  sector,  the  division  of  labor  between  men  and  women  differ.  In  Hong \nKong, the influenza cases reported in 1997 indicated that women are at higher risk than men as more were market \nworkers, poultry packers, and health workers. There was little gender differential among those who sought hospital \nhealth care in Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam from 2004\u20132005. \n \nThe Project will invest in strengthening the capacity of regional technical experts to enhance capacity of preventive \nhealth  staff  and  veterinarians  in  surveillance  activities  and  delivering  preventive  and  curative  care.  Where \nappropriate,  courses  and  guidelines  will  disaggregate  the  impact  of  AI  and  human  influenza  on  women  and  men. \nWomen and men rely on the poultry sector for different activities for some this is a primary source of livelihood, and \nfor  others,  poultry  rearing  and  trade  may  just  supplement  income.  Preventive  education  materials,  i.e.,  IEC \nmaterials, will be prepared for use in specific communities and will take into consideration special needs related to \nethnicity and gender. The Project will also support equal opportunity for training of qualified women.  \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\n \nE.  Social Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\n \n\nItem \n\nResettlement \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\nAffordability \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\nLabor \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None  \n\n \n\n \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n \n\nThe  Project  is  not  likely  to  support  any  construction  or \nrehabilitation of civil  works. Any change in project in project \ndesign  will  require  consultation  with  ADB  to  ensure  that \nadequate social safeguards are maintained.  \nIssues pertaining to affordability are not expected to arise in \nthe  Project.  The  Project  will  build  capacity  of  regional \ntechnical partners to better respond to a possible outbreak of \nthe  virus,  and  contain  against  a  possible  pandemic.  The \nproject  will  also  support  better  monitoring  and  reporting \nactivities,  including  effective  risk  communication  strategies. \nThe Project may lower the cost of essential medical services \nduring a pandemic outbreak, thus increasing access.  \nLabor  is  not  a  potential  issue.  The  Project  helps  to \nstrengthen the current capacity of regional technical partners \nand  the  preventive  animal  and  human  health  systems  to \nbetter  respond  to  avian  influenza.  The  Project  supports \ntraining activities at the regional level, which will enhance the \ncapacity  of  animal  and  human  health  workers.  Preference \nwill be given to qualified women and ethnic minorities. \nNo negative impact expected. During implementation, steps \nwill  be  taken  to  ensure  that  animal  and  human  health \ncenters  take  into  account  the  needs  of  ethnic  minorities \n(e.g., \nfrontline  health \npersonnel,  and  training  guidelines)  will  be  developed  or \nimproved  to  reflect  ethnic  minority  cultural,  economic  and \nlanguage needs.

Efforts to prevent it \nand  to  mitigate  its  impact  are  good  economic  investments.  They  are  classic  examples  of \ninvestments that are public goods and have a high degree of externalities. The Project is part of \na  larger  global  effort  to  lessen  the  impact  of  avian  influenza.  Governments  and  international \norganizations are making a major effort to coordinate their activities and to ensure that there is \nadequate financing. Given the public good nature of this investment, it is difficult or impossible \nto attribute success in the battle against avian influenza to any single project or investment.  \n \nA. \n\nProject Objectives \n\nThe overall objective of the Project is to lessen the risk of a potential outbreak of a new \n2. \nstrain  of  flu  by  reducing  the  risk  of  mutation  and  by  lessening  the  impact  of  an  outbreak.  The \nProject is part of a larger, world-wide campaign to fight a potential flu pandemic. Asia is at the \ncenter of an avian influenza outbreak\u2014the disease appears to be endemic in the domestic bird \npopulation  of  many  countries  in  the  region  and  it  is  likely  that  any  mutation  to  a  human-\ntransmitted  flu  will  occur  in  Asia  as  well.  The  Project  is  targeted  at  low-  and  middle-income \ncountries  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region,  however  it  will  positively  benefit  all  countries.  The \nProject  focuses  on  two  major  activities,  halting  the  spread  of  the  disease  in  the  animal \npopulation and reducing the impact of a human influenza pandemic if the disease does develop.  \n \nB. \n\nRationale for Investment \n\nRegional  Public  Good. Investing in public health is a good example of a public good. \n3. \nDisease  prevention  and  disease  control  benefits  the  entire population  and  it  is  not possible  to \nrestricts the benefits or charge the beneficiaries for the service. The market, on its own, will not \nprovide adequate public health services. This provides strong justification for public intervention. \nGovernments,  acting  individually,  can  effectively  focus  on  public  health  in  their  own  country. \nHowever,  migratory  birds  (an  important  disease  reservoir)  can  easily  cross  borders  and \ncontinue  to  spread  the  disease  to  disease-free  domestic  poultry  populations.  Likewise,  in  an \nincreasingly  globalized  world,  it  is  difficult  to  control  the  entry  of  infected  people.  Without \ncoordination and joint action, the impact of actions of individual countries will be lessened. This \nrequires public health action at the regional level to complement and coordinate country actions.  \n \n4. \nThe  Project  will  support  governments  in  developing  their  technical  capacity  to  support \nculling  of  disease  poultry  herds.  This  is  an  example  of  an  activity  with  a  high  externality. \nFarmers  do  benefit  from  culling  but  the  cost  of  culling  for  them  far  outweighs  their  individual \nbenefit. However, the country as a whole benefits enormously from a well implemented culling \nprogram.  Without  government  action  (by  mandate  and  possibly  with  economic  incentives), \nculling will not happen. However most governments have little technical capacity for culling and \nneed substantial support in designing and implementing a meaningful program.  \n \n5. \nEconomies of Scale and Risk Management. On average, there has been a pandemic \nflu  outbreak  every  30  years.  History  has  shown  that  it  is  not  possible  to  predict  the  timing, \nvirulence,  and  impact  of  a  flu  pandemic.  Some  outbreaks  have  been  mild,  with  low  fatalities, \nwhile  others  have  spread  quickly  and  left  a  large  number  of  dead.  It  is  not  efficient  for  each \ncountry  to  stockpile  expensive  equipment  and  drugs  for  a  pandemic  outbreak  that  may  not \noccur  or  may  be  milder  than  predicted.  Poor  countries  do  not  have  the  resources  and  have \nother  priorities.  Likewise,  it  is  difficult  for  producers  to  predict  the  demand  for  drugs  and \nvaccines  and  they  may  not  have  sufficient  supply  capacity.  Goods  can  be  stockpiled  at  the \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n61 \n\nregional level and distributed where and when they are needed, similar to an insurance scheme. \nCountries can also form purchasing alliances and make advance orders to ensure that suppliers \nhave  adequate  production  capacity  in  the  case  of  an  outbreak.  Since  it  is  in  each  country\u2019s \nindividual  interest  to  see  the  outbreak  controlled  in  other  countries,  participation  in  this  sort  of \nscheme is well justified on economic grounds.  \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Impact of a Flu Outbreak \n\nIn evaluating the cost of disease, health economists have traditionally looked at several \n6. \ndifferent  types  of  costs. 1 First  is  the  direct  cost  of  the  disease,  which  includes  the  cost  of \ntreatment paid by the patient and the second health care system. Second, is the indirect cost, \nwhich  includes  the  economic  loss  due  to  morbidity  and  mortality.  This  also  includes  the \nsecondary  impact  of  the  disruption  in  commerce  due  to  the  outbreak.  Finally,  is  the  intangible \ncost,  consisting  of  the  cost  associated  with  the  pain  and  suffering  of  a  disease.  Few  studies \nhave been to quantify all of these costs and often a partially is presented.  \n \nAt the present, there is no indication of how severe a human pandemic would be. History \n7. \nprovides little guidance as each pandemic outbreak has had quite different impacts. Consistent \nwith  earlier  estimations,  the  economic  analysis  uses  a  20%  attack  rate  and  0.1%  total  fatality \nrate.2 In human terms, this would lead to the death of around 3 million Asians and a total 600 \nmillion  cases  of  influenza.3 A  common  technique  to  quantify  loss  due  to  disease  is  known  as \ndisability adjusted life years (DALY), which sums the lost of life due to early mortality with the \nloss of good health due to temporary incapacity. Assuming the disease incapacitates people for \nan average of 2 weeks, a human pandemic would cost 49.6 million DALYs in lost lives and 20.8 \nmillion  DALYs  lost  to  incapacity.  This  can  be  moneterized.  The  loss  of  life  is  equivalent  to \n$267.2 billion in foregone income that the victims would have earned had they not succumbed \nto disease. The lost in income due to sickness is around $14.2 billion.  \n \nRecent  experience  with  SARS  and  other  diseases  show  that  concerns  about  public \n8. \nhealth  can  have  a  major  impact  on  the  economy  that  goes  beyond  the  direct  effect  of  the \ndisease on human health. The analysis examined two scenarios for the psychological impact of \na  potential  pandemic  outbreak.  The  first  scenario  assumed  a  relatively  short  reaction  for  two \nquarters, limited to Asia. The second scenario assumed a longer reaction, lasting four quarters, \nand  worldwide  impact.  In  both  scenarios,  two  exogenous  shocks  were  introduced,  (i)  a  3% \ndecline in domestic consumption during the period of impact and (ii) 60% to 70% decline in the \nexport  of  services  during  the  period  of  impact.  The  shocks  were  modeled  using  the  Oxford \nEconomic  Forecasting  Global  Model,  a  commercial  available  model  that  simulates  different \neconomic  scenarios  for  planning  purposes.4 Under  these  assumptions  in  scenario  1,  the  total \neconomic impact would be $99.2 billion. For scenario 2, it would be $282.7 billion. Tables A14.1 \nand  A14.2  present  the  demand  shocks  for  a  number  of  key  countries.  They  also  include  the \nsupply shock due to the loss of workers from death and incapacity.  \n \n9. \nTwo  principle  factors  explain  the  large  difference  between  the  two  estimates.  First,  the \nlonger  duration  of  the  shock  increases  the  impact  cumulatively,  creating  a  greater  impact  on \ntrade  and  investment  and  leading  to  a  greater  decline  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP). \n\n                                                 \n1   World Health Organization. 2000.

Technical  Assistance  for  Preparing \n\nthe Regional Communicable Disease Control Project. Manila) to perform the estimation.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\n  Appendix 14 \n\nSecond, with more countries affected by the demand shock, the multiplier effect is substantially \ngreater.  The  effect  of  each  country  cutting  back  on  consumption  and  trade  affects  all  other \ncountries.  In  this  way,  controlling  the  psychological  impact of  an  avian  influenza  outbreak  is  a \npublic good as much as controlling the epidemiological impact of the disease.  \n \n\nTable A14.1: Two Quarters of Demand Contraction, only in Asia \n\nEstimated Reduction in Annual \nGDP Growth, 2006  \n(percentage point) \nDemand Shocka  Supply Shockb \n\n \n\nEstimated Reduction in Annual GDP \nLevels, 2006 ($ billion) \n\n \n0.4 \n\n \n1.3 \n\n \n6.6 \n\n \n21.4 \n\nSupply Shock  \n\n9.2 \n1.5 \n \n1.5 \n\n  Demand Shock  \n \n \n\nCountry \nEast Asia \nPeople\u2019s  Republic \nof China \nHong Kong, China \nRepublic of Korea \nSouth Asia \nIndia \nSoutheast Asia and Mekong \nIndonesia \nMalaysia \nPhilippines \nSingapore \nThailand \n \na Reduction in consumption, trade in services, and investment. \nb Reduction in the labor due to incapacity and mortality. \nc East and South Asia, excluding Japan.  \nSource:  Bloom,  De  Wit,  and  Carangral-San  Jose.  2005.

At the present, the virus is largely present in bird populations and is not easily \nspread among humans. The Project is only one small part of larger package of assistance being \norganized by governments and international organizations for the same purpose. At the present, \nit is not possible to say what the probability is of a mutation to a human-to-human transmissible \nvirus and how virulent such a flu virus will be.  \n \n11. \nThe Project\u2019s potential impact can  be measured in terms of its contribution in reducing \nthe risk of an outbreak (an H5N1 human influenza pandemic). For example, suppose there is a \n50% chance that the virus will not mutate (and thereby cause a pandemic) and that there will be \nno  further  economic  impact  and  a  50%  chance  that  the  virus  will  mutate  and  cause  the \neconomic harm outlined in scenario 2. In this case, it is possible to calculate the expected value \nof  the  economic  impact.  There  is  a  50%  chance  that  it  is  $0  and  50%  chance  that  it  is  $297 \nbillion. Thus the expected value of the economic impact is $148.5 billion. The Project may alter \nthe probability of the human-to-human transmission of the virus. For example, if the activities of \nthe project lower the probability of the virus mutating by 0.1%, it will change the expected value \nof the economic impact to $148.2. This implies a savings of $300 million. The total cost of the \nProject is $28 million, implying a very high rate of return.  \n \n12. \nThis sort of analysis can be repeated for a combination of probabilities and scenarios to \nshow  under  what  circumstances  the  Project  will  have  a  positive  economic  impact.  Using  the \nexpected  value  of  economic  impact  and  two  scenarios  (\u201cpandemic\u201d  and  \u201cno  pandemic\u201d),  the \nactually  probability  of  the  pandemic  makes  no  difference  in  calculating  the  contribution  of  the \nProject. Only the Project\u2019s contributions to reducing the probability of a pandemic and the cost \nof a pandemic (in monetary terms) affect the calculation. If the Project contributes to reducing \nthe  probability  of  a  pandemic  by  0.04%  and  if  the  pandemic  costs  more  than  $100  billion,  the \nProject will generate returns of $40 million, which are quite good given the Project\u2019s cost of $28 \nmillion.  \n \n13. \nThis  sort  of  analysis  is  a  simplification.  In  addition  to  the  possibility  of  reducing  the \nprobability of a pandemic, the Project also aims to mitigate the impact of a pandemic should it \noccur.  The  Project  will  make  a  contribution  to  the  region\u2019s  capacity  to  limit  the  spread  of  a \npandemic.  The  approval  of  this  Project  and  similar  projects  may  also  contribute  to  reducing \npublic  perception  of  the  danger  of  avian  influenza,  lessening  the  psychological  impact  of  a \npandemic outbreak.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6\n4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n5\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n\nDescription \n\nYear \n\nYear2 \n\nQ1 \n \n\nQ2 \n \n\nQ3 \n \n\nQ4 \n \n\n  \n\n  \n\nQ1 \n \n\nQ2 \n \n\nQ3 \n \n\nQ4 \n \n\nYear3 \n\nQ1 \n \n\nQ2 \n \n\nComponent 1: Support to Country Responses through \nRegional Agencies \n  \n\n  \n  \n   1.1.
