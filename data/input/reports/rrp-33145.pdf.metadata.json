The Government\nhas  formulated  and  has  begun  implementing  a  wide-ranging\nstructural reform program (SRP), embracing public service and\neconomic reforms.\nThe quality of public sector management in PNG has deteriorated\nover  the  past  decade.  As  is  strongly  emphasized  by  the\nGovernment,  poor  governance  is  the  root  cause.  The  public\nsector\u2019s capacity for designing and implementing sound policies\nand to manage its responsibilities has been eroded.\nA  broad  consensus  has  arisen  that  the  situation  must  be\nreversed. The Government has committed itself to a program of\nreform to restore the integrity of the public service. Beginning in\n2000, the Government has drawn up a comprehensive plan of\naction for public sector reform, and implementation is under way.\nImproving performance in the public sector is a main pillar in the\nGovernment\u2019s  SRP,  alongside  concurrent  measures  to  sustain\nmacroeconomic  stability  and  remove  barriers  to  private  sector\ndevelopment. For the SRP to succeed, it will be important for the\nGovernment  to  demonstrate  improvements  in  services  to  the\ngeneral public, particularly front-line services to urban and rural\npoor communities. The actions under the PSP are essential for\nachieving the needed reorientation of the public service.\nObjective and The PSP will support, as part of the broader reform agenda of the\nScope Government, policy reform measures in four areas: (i) building a\nperformance-oriented  public  service,  (ii)  reorienting  personnel\nmanagement systems and processes, (iii) strengthening probity\nand  oversight  agencies,  and  (iv)  improving  delivery  of  major\nservices.  The  PSP  focuses  on  improved  human  resource\nmanagement; civil service administration; policy changes across\nthe public sector; general management systems at government\nlevel; strengthening of the probity and oversight agencies; and\nimprovement of service delivery, particularly for basic services, at\nthe national and provincial levels.\nClassification Thematic: Good governance\nEnvironmental Category  C.  The  environmental  implications  of  the  PSP  are\nAssessment minimal.", "ADB Assistance\nProgram Loan A loan of $70 million from the ordinary capital resources of the\nLoan Amount and Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided under ADB\u2019s\nTerms LIBOR-based lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term,\nincluding a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate determined in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a\ncommitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, a front-end fee of\n1.0  percent,  conversion  options  that  may  be  exercised  in\naccordance with the terms of the draft Loan Agreement, the Loan\nRegulations, ADB\u2019s Conversion Guidelines, and other terms and\nconditions set out in the draft Loan Agreement.\nProgram Period The PSP period will be from December 2001 to December 2003.\nand Tranching The loan will be released in two tranches. The first tranche of\n$35 million, including provision for capitalizing the loan front-end\nfee  and  for  cost  recovery  of  project  preparatory  technical\nassistance, will be made available upon loan effectiveness. The\nsecond  tranche  of  $35  million  is  expected  to  be  released  by\nSeptember  2002,  but  may  be  released  earlier,  depending  on\nsatisfactory implementation of the agreed conditions.\nExecuting Agency The Department of Treasury will be the Executing Agency for the\nloan,  with  the  Department  of  Prime  Minister  and  National\nExecutive Council responsible for implementation.\nProcurement The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed against a broad range\nof imports. The proceeds of the loan will only be used to finance\nitems produced and procured in ADB member countries, except\nineligible items specified in the negative list. Procurement under\nthe loan will follow normal commercial practice by the private\nsector, or standard Government procedures for procurement by\nthe  public  sector,  except  that  goods  commonly  traded  on  the\ninternational commodity market will be procured in accordance\nwith procedure appropriate to the trade.\nCounterpart Funds Counterpart funds to be generated from the proceeds of the loan\nwill be used to support the Government\u2019s SRP. An indicative use\nof  the  funds  has  been  agreed,  including  direct  structural\nadjustment  costs  such  as  retrenchments  and  beginning  to\nimplement  service  improvement  plans,  as  well  as  reducing\nexpensive public debt.\nRisks and Safeguards Three major risks have been identified: (i) inadequate political\ncommitment, (ii) resource constraints affecting sustainability, and\n(iii) capacity constraints affecting implementation of the reforms.\nWhile  these  will  remain  risks,  the  PSP  proposes  mitigating\nmeasures to manage the risks and minimize the impact on the\ncountry\u2019s reform initiatives.", "iv", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Independent State of Papua New Guinea (PNG) for the Public Service Program\n(PSP).\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. From the beginning of 1998, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been in dialogue\nwith  the  PNG  Government  concerning  its  request  for  assistance  to  improve  public  sector\nperformance in PNG. However, the developing macroeconomic crisis slowed progress. In July\n1999, a new government came to power, providing an opportunity for ADB and the other\ndevelopment agencies involved in PNG to assist the Government to reform the economy and to\nreorient the public sector. In 1999, the Government formulated its structural reform program\n(SRP).  At  the  November  1999  Consultative  Group  Meeting,  the  Government  reiterated  its\nintention to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, as\nwell as from ADB and other agencies. The Government finalized agreements with IMF in April\n2000 and with the World Bank in June 2000; these agreements led to ancillary agreements for\nassistance with, notably, Australia, the European Union, and Japan. The IMF and World Bank\nprograms are targeted at addressing fiscal and balance-of-payments issues, financial sector\nreform,  and  privatization  of  state-owned  enterprises.  The  Government  requested  ADB\nassistance for public sector reform. A technical assistance (TA) was approved in October 1999\nfor preparing a governance and public sector reform program.1 The budgets for 2000 and 2001,\nprepared with IMF and World Bank assistance, identified funding gaps for structural adjustment\nexpenditures. The Government has requested ADB financing through a policy-based program\nloan for the PSP, as a part of its overall SRP.\n3. A fact-finding mission was fielded during 13 February-1 March 2001, a follow-up mission\nduring 16-28 July 2001, and an appraisal mission during 3-22 September 2001.2 This report is\nbased on the findings of the missions and consultations with key officials in Government and\nrepresentatives of aid agencies. The program framework is in Appendix 1. The national policy\nagenda and reform priorities of the Government are summarized in the development policy\nletter from the Prime Minister (Appendix 2), which includes the policy matrix for the ADB loan,\ngiven in Appendix 3.\nIII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\nA.  Development Objectives, Strategy, and Plans\n4. The primary development challenge in PNG is poverty alleviation. Most of the people of\nPNG are poor by regional and international standards. The human development index (HDI)\nscore for 1998 of 0.542 placed PNG in 133rd position on a list of 174 developing countries.\nAmong Pacific island countries, PNG was last on the HDI scale. In 1996, 31 percent of the\npopulation lived below the international poverty line of $1 per capita per day; 37 percent were\nbelow the country-specific poverty line in that same year. Around 17 percent of the population\ncould not meet the basic requirement of 2,200 calories per day per adult equivalent, even if they\n                  \n1  TA  3280-PNG:  Governance and Public Sector Reform,  for  $600,000,  approved  on  16  October  1999;\nsupplementary  financing  of  about  $381,000  was  provided  from  the  Australian  Agency  for  International\nDevelopment (AusAID), approved on 26 October 2000.\n2 The appraisal mission comprised S. van der Tak, Mission Leader; R. Siy, Manager; and O. Tiwana, Counsel.", "2\nspent all their income on food. These statistics place PNG among the poorer countries in the\nworld.\n5. Income distribution is also a concern. The richest 10 percent of the population account\nfor 36 percent of consumption, while the poorest 50 percent account for only 20 percent.\nGrowth, led by a capital-intensive minerals sector, has supported increasing consumption by an\nurban elite. Accordingly, the vast majority of the poor (93.5 percent) live in rural areas. The\nurbanized National Capital District has a poverty rate of 25.8 percent, and accounts for just 3.8\npercent of the poor.\n6. Poverty also has a gender dimension. Across nearly all indicators, women fare worse\nthan men. Indeed, PNG is one of the few countries in the world where women have a lower life\nexpectancy than men. Women are responsible for a disproportionately large amount of work in\nthe rural sector, but are generally under represented in senior positions in the public and private\nsectors.\n7. However, the data point to promising approaches for alleviating poverty. In about three-\nquarters of poor households, there has been little, if any, human capital investment. Almost 52\npercent of the poor live in households whose head never attended school. Likewise, girls'\nenrollment rates are significantly influenced by the educational level of adult females in the\nhousehold. The incidence of poverty is also linked to the ability to earn cash to pay for nonfood\nitems (such as school fees) and to permit savings for times of economic difficulty. Where\nhousehold heads earn cash income from wage employment or a business, poverty rates are\nmuch  lower.  Poverty  alleviation  therefore  requires  improved  access  to  services,  such  as\ntransport, education, and health, particularly in rural areas.\n8. In  PNG,  the  formal  safety  net  is  provided  by  provident  funds;  these  systems  are\ntherefore limited to wage earners. Provident funds in PNG have performed poorly and are\ncurrently the focus of reform efforts. Informal social safety nets (the wantok systems) provide\nincome transfers, labor exchange, and sharing of gardening and child care to those within the\nsame clan or tribe. However, these systems are less effective in communities with high poverty\nrates, where people therefore have less of a surplus to share with others.\n9. In recent years, PNG's ability to address rising poverty has been constrained mainly by\neconomic policy shortcomings and political instability. The current Government has moved\ndecisively to address these fundamental constraints.\n10. On the political side, the Government is taking measures to improve stability. In late\n2000, the Parliament passed a bill to strengthen the role of political parties, and to reduce the\npotential for switching, thus reducing the political horsetrading that has long been a feature of\nPNG. Government has also endorsed a fundamental change in the electoral system, from the\npresent first-past-the-post system to a system of limited preferential voting, which will help\nensure that members of parliament have a wider constituency.\n11. The Government recognizes that the root cause of PNG\u2019s weak economic performance\nis  poor  governance,  characterized  by  a  decline  in  public  institutions\u2019  performance,  poor\ntransparency  of  policy  making,  and  political  interference  in  policy  implementation.  These\nweaknesses are being addressed through a wide-ranging SRP.\n12. The Government\u2019s first priority has been to minimize fiscal deficits in order to reduce the\nrate of increase of indebtedness and to help restore stability and integrity to the economy and", "3\nbanking system by delivering a reasonably balanced budget. The Government\u2019s commitment to\nthe SRP is evident from the strict fiscal constraints it has adopted. The 2000 and 2001 budgets\nhave essentially been balanced, apart from repayment of arrears and a modest provision for\nstructural  reforms.  Within  the  constrained  overall  expenditure  ceiling,  the  Government  has\nprioritized expenditure on health, education, peace and order, agriculture, and infrastructure\nmaintenance\u2014no  other  sectors  have  received  increased  allocations.  No  new  external\ncommercial  borrowing  is  envisaged.  Central  bank  financing  of  the  budget  also  has  been\neliminated.  Under  a  new  central  banking  act  (March  2000),  the  central  bank\u2019s  role  was\nredefined, ensuring its independence and limiting its financing of government activities to short-\nterm liquidity management. The resulting imposition of harder fiscal discipline constitutes what\nwill be a long lasting improvement in governance.\n13. PNG has had a substantial overhang of short-term domestic debt, with the resulting high\ndebt service constraining public spending on public services. The Government has been retiring\nthis domestic debt as quickly as possible, in part by improving its management of net assets. As\na central plank of its program, the Government also has been converting domestic short-term\ndebt  into  long-term  concessional  foreign  debt,  thereby  freeing  up  budget  resources  and\nreducing the pressure on domestic credit to the private sector. The Government has also been\nconducting a successful program of clearing up arrears, and ensuring that new arrears are\navoided (the temporary cash flow difficulties in 2001 have resulted in some build-up again of\narrears).\n14. To conclude, the framework for the programs, including the fiscal sector management\ninitiative, must be viewed against the Government's comprehensive SRP (para. 2), which aims\nto (i) promote good governance; (ii) sustain macroeconomic stability; (iii) improve public sector\nperformance in the core areas through privatization, reduce the involvement of the public sector\nwhere  its  performance  has  been  poor  and  where  the  private  sector  can  improve  service\ndelivery; and (iv) remove barriers to investment and economic development.\nB.  Recent Economic Performance and Prospects\n15. In  1995,  following  a  balance-of-payments  crisis,  the  Government  embarked  on  a\ncomprehensive structural adjustment program. Until mid-1997, the tightening of macroeconomic\npolicies  achieved  some  success  in  bringing  down  inflation,  rebuilding  foreign  exchange\nreserves, and fostering a recovery of output. However, there was little success in achieving the\nbroad structural reform agenda. Beginning in late 1997, the economy was battered by a series\nof adverse exogenous shocks, including a prolonged drought that affected mining output as well\nas agricultural production, and the regional financial crisis, which caused steep declines in the\nprices of, and demand for, PNG\u2019s principal export commodities. The macroeconomic effects of\nthese  shocks  were  exacerbated  by  weak  monetary  policy  and  deteriorating  budget\nmanagement. The deterioration of governance, marked by increasing political interference in\nimplementation of public policy, further undermined private sector confidence. The situation was\ncompounded by a breakdown in relations with the external development partners.\n16. A broader legacy of the performance through the 1990s is a stagnating standard of living\nand social indicators for the population. Based on 1996 poverty data, over 37 percent of the\npopulation falls below the poverty line. The situation of the poorest quartile has not improved\nsince 1984, and developments since 1996 have worsened the disparities. Low educational\nachievements, inadequate delivery of basic services, especially in rural areas, and inadequate\ninfrastructure and institutional support exacerbate the situation. The results of the 2000 census", "4\nindicate that the population has been growing more rapidly than expected, with the likely result\nthat per capita incomes have been overestimated.\n17. A new government took office in July 1999 with a mandate to stabilize macroeconomic\nconditions, improve the governance of public institutions, and restore relations with international\nfinancial institutions and bilateral partners. The Government launched a reform program aimed\nat stabilizing the economy and creating the conditions for growth led by the private sector. The\nGovernment took measures to rein in the growing fiscal deficit and tightened monetary policy\nduring the second half of 1999. The Government adopted an adjustment program focused on\nsound fiscal management and reforms to improve the governance, transparency, and efficiency\nof the public sector. The Government was successful in reestablishing dialogue and agreement\nwith the international community, with immediate results. Aided by an $80 million bridging loan\nfrom the Australian government and the release of a $25 million program loan tranche from\nADB,3 together with a turnaround of some commodity prices, the central bank was able to\nrecoup  a  significant  amount  of  reserves  by  early  2000.  The  Government  also  reached\nagreements on support from IMF in March 2000 and with the World Bank in June 2000, together\nwith linked financial packages from Australia, Japan, and other sources.4\n18. Real gross domestic product (GDP) declined by 1.8 percent in 2000, although the\nexternal  current  account  surplus  widened  and  inflation  declined.  Mineral  production  was\ndepressed by the start of a secular decline in oil production due to depletion of oil reserves.\nNonmineral output contracted, in part due to fiscal restraint and tight credit conditions. The\noverall Government deficit was reduced substantially to 1.3 percent of GDP (below targets),\nlargely because of improved mineral tax revenue. However, there were delays in fulfilling IMF\nand World Bank target conditions. A shortfall in external financing led the Government to resort\nto domestic financing. Nevertheless, for the year as a whole, net domestic financing declined as\na share of GDP. Although the kina depreciated by 13.7 percent against the United States dollar\nby year end, the rate of inflation declined to 10 percent by year end (compared to the target of 5\npercent).\n19. Economic conditions continued to be difficult in the first half of 2001. The economy\nremains stagnant, with oil output and nonmineral activity declining. Uncertainties in the relations\nwith multilateral institutions in the early part of the year, and unrest in the military in March,\ncontributed to pressures on the kina. Market interest rates remained high. Delays in the receipt\nof external financing led to fiscal pressures and a temporary breach of the limit on central bank\nlending to the Government. The pressures eased somewhat as the authorities secured early\nrelease of the second tranche of a budgetary support loan from Australia (tied to satisfactory\nassessment of progress by IMF) and the release of a World Bank loan tranche in July 2001.\nNevertheless the situation remains tight.\n                  \n3  Loan 1516-PNG/1517-PNG[SF]: Health Sector Development Program, for $50 million, approved on 20 March\n1997.\n4  A 14-month IMF stand-by Arrangement (SBA) of SDR85.5 million was approved by the IMF Executive Board on 29\nMarch 2000; this program has just been successfully completed, with all four reviews being approved by the IMF\nBoard (the first time that an IMF program has been completed in PNG and a fairly rare achievement). The World\nBank approved a structural adjustment loan (SAL) on 13 June 2000 in the amount of $90 million. The initial tranche\n($35 million) and the floating tranche ($20 million) have been released, based on satisfactory compliance thus far;\nthe release of the final tranche of $35 million will be contingent on several key policy actions, including amendment\nof forestry legislation, completion of audits of major state enterprises, and reforms in the National Provident Fund.\nAmong the other major contributions, the Government of Australia provided a loan of $110 million, the Government\nof Japan a $50 million loan, and the European Union a grant of E10.4 million.", "5\nIV.  THE PUBLIC SECTOR\nA.  Background, Constraints, and Issues\n20. Political  and  public  service  governance  shortcomings  in  PNG  worsen  inherent\ndevelopment  problems,  and  political  instability  compounds  inadequate  development\nmanagement. Corruption, political patronage, and weak public administration have undermined\nthe professional ethos of the public service. These factors are major constraints to the efforts to\nalleviate poverty in PNG. The extent of poverty is a direct consequence of sustained low levels\nof investment and poor quality of services in rural areas, particularly in such key sectors as\nagriculture, education, and health. Public services have deteriorated steadily over the past two\ndecades and have reached unacceptably low levels. In a 1996 survey, the PNG population\nexpressed its collective dissatisfaction. The poorest quartile of the population was the most\ndissatisfied with the state of government services. Lowest performance ratings were given to\nservices in the Highlands and Momase/North Coast Regions where the majority of the poor live.\n21. The Government acknowledges the validity of this public perception. Key policy makers\naccept that the core functions of the public sector have not been fulfilled efficiently or effectively\nand that this failure of past governments has adversely affected the poor most of all. This\nrecognition has led the Government to feature good governance and public service performance\nimprovement as key objectives of its reform program. Clearly, efforts at sound macroeconomic\nmanagement and structural adjustment have little meaning unless they enhance public services\nand result in higher living standards for the population. The following sections describes the\nfeatures of the Government's SRP and the major policy actions that have been planned or\ncompleted under the SRP.\nB.  Government Expenditure and Economic Management\n22. The Government has transformed economic management. The exchange rate, interest\nrates,  and  liquidity  management  are  now  market  based.  The  Government  has  devoted\nconsiderable  attention  to  strengthening  fiscal  management,  improving  transparency,  and\nreestablishing  proper  procedures.  Government  departments  are  reporting  all  spending\ncommitments, with development budget warrants integrated with the recurrent budget warrants.\nMonthly cash flow reports are produced. Expenditure controls have been enhanced and the use\nof trust accounts essentially stopped. Substantial arrears incurred by previous governments\nhave been cleared during 1999 and 2000.\n23. The Government is fully committed to strengthening the policy framework of government\nexpenditure. The Government has explicitly based its national budgets on its development\nobjectives,  with  the  development  policy  framework  central  in  budget  formulation.  More\nfundamentally,  the  Government  is  moving  toward  a  multi-year  approach  to  expenditure\nplanning. As part of the process, the tools of financial management are being strengthened, with\nexternal assistance, including from ADB.5\n24. In 1999, the Government started a review of the tax system to strengthen the fiscal base\n(with ADB TA for mining and hydrocarbons taxes6). The recommendations were introduced in\nthe 2001 budget. The purpose was to ensure that PNG\u2019s personal and corporate taxes were\ncompetitive, with a view to encouraging investment.\n                  \n5 Loan 1703-PNG: Financial Management, for $25.8 million, approved on 21 October 1999.\n6 TA 3444-PNG: Review of Mining and Hydrocarbon Tax Regimes, for $325,000, approved on 19 May 2000.", "6\n25. The Government has taken steps to improve the management of its debt, in particular\ndomestic debt, which had ballooned to unsustainable levels. The responsibility for domestic\ndebt management has been transferred from the central bank to the Department of Finance and\nthe Department of Treasury, and the practice of paying an administratively determined interest\nrate on the central bank\u2019s holdings of public debt has been eliminated, increasing sensitivity to\nmarket conditions. Cash balances are being reduced. The Mineral Resources Stabilization\nFund, originally intended to smooth the use of mineral revenues, has been abolished and the\nfunds used to reduce domestic debt.\n26. In the area of monetary policy, the new central banking legislation has established full\nindependence of the central bank. Financial sector reform has been wide ranging, with new\nlegislation focused on the need for enhanced regulation and supervision of banks and other\nfinancial  institutions.  The  life  insurance  and  superannuation  industries  are  now  under  the\nsupervision of the central bank. Special audits of the National Provident Fund and, to a lesser\nextent, of the Public Officers Superannuation Fund, revealed difficulties. The Government has\ntaken timely action to address the National Provident Fund problems, including instituting an\nindependent commission of inquiry, and addressing cash flow problems. With World Bank\nassistance, a plan of action has been drawn up, including suitable recapitalization.\n27. Another objective of the Government\u2019s SRP is to remove barriers to investment and\ndevelopment. In this regard, as a main pillar of the Government\u2019s strategy to improve the\nefficiency of the public sector, the Government has embarked on a program of privatization. The\nobjective is to improve service delivery and efficiency, allowing the Government to concentrate\non  its  core  responsibilities  and  reduce  its  debt.  A  privatization  commission  has  been\nestablished. The institutional, legal, and regulatory frameworks are being strengthened. Special\nteams are working on the legal review and due diligence work. Assistance in the design and\nimplementation of the privatization strategy is being provided primarily by the World Bank and\nan international advisory group. Additional financing is required for the continuing preparations.\nAlthough  there  were  some  initial  delays,  implementation  of  the  privatization  strategy  is\nprogressing.\n28. To liberalize and promote trade, the Government has been implementing a seven-year\ntariff  reform  program,  with  most  tariffs  having  been  replaced  by  a  value-added  tax.  The\ninvestment policy is being reviewed with a view to simplifying the regulatory structure. A review\nof competition policy is under way, with a view to reducing restrictions. Financing is required for\nits ongoing operations. A notable focus has been to improve fisheries management, with ADB\nassistance.7\nC.  Government Objectives and Strategy\n29. The Government is introducing measures to strengthen governance and public sector\nmanagement. Under difficult circumstances, it has (i) contained the fiscal deficit and reversed\nthe  decline  in  macroeconomic  indicators,  (ii)  reestablished  national  and  local  planning\nprocesses, (iii) strengthened public procurement processes, (iv) made progress in privatizing\nstate-owned enterprises, and (v) introduced wide-ranging reforms in key sectors. However, the\ntransformation of the public service is a complex and long-term task. The PSP is only the initial\nstage in an effort that will likely require a decade or more of sustained government attention and\nexternal assistance.\n                  \n7 TA3604-PNG: Coastal Fisheries Management and Development, for $340,000, approved on 20 December 2000.", "7\n30. In broad terms, the PSP seeks to set in place some of the initial conditions to facilitate,\nmotivate, and induce a gradual transformation of culture, systems, and management in the\npublic service. Part of that change process has started, with clear statements of vision and\ngoals from senior officials in the Government. The PSP seeks to take this initiative a step further\nby  introducing  a  number  of  policy  and  institutional  measures  in  key  agencies.  Initial  and\nindicative indicators and performance targets have been developed for the longer term (see the\nprogram  framework,  Appendix  1).  However,  a  precise  and  specific  plan  of  actions  and\nresources required for the longer term is desirable, and the lessons regarding ownership and\nthe need to evolve a fit with local culture and capacities must be reflected. Such a plan cannot\nbe a rigid blueprint; it has to be shaped by an iterative process of introducing change, evaluating\noutcomes, and planning next steps. Accordingly, while the broad objectives can be set for an\ninstitutional change process, it is difficult to detail the actions and reforms needed, beyond about\nthe next 1-2 year period. The process requires careful monitoring, constant assessments of\nimplementation capacities and responses to recent interventions, and regular consultations with\nkey people regarding the way forward. For this reason, the PSP covers only an implementation\nperiod of about 2 years, with limited specificity of further milestones in the reform program. The\nPSP and the medium-term framework encompass four broad dimensions for introducing change\nin the public service.\n31. The first dimension involves measures to strengthen the performance orientation of the\npublic service. As an initial step, departments are required to define their outputs and to prepare\ncorporate plans and budgets with these objectives and outputs in mind. Public access to these\nperformance targets is expected to enhance transparency and accountability. The efforts to\ndefine departmental outputs and report on accomplishments may, in the early stages, be off the\nmark or less than satisfactory. However, the exercise is expected to raise awareness of the\nobligation of the public service to deliver results. At later stages, attention will need to shift to\nestablishing  cost-effective  measures  for  monitoring  and  measuring  performance,  and  to\nproviding  appropriate  incentives,  through  the  budget  process,  to  reward  higher  performing\ndepartments. While the focus will be on national-level departments initially, the process will\nneed eventually to cover provincial governments as well.\n32. The  second  dimension  involves  policy  actions  to  reorient  personnel  management\nsystems and to ensure that such systems and processes are fair, transparent, merit based, and\ninsulated  from  arbitrary  action  of  politicians.  Personnel  management  processes  are  being\nreviewed and revised. A key step is the integration of human resource management and payroll\nsystems to ensure accurate information, permit national human resource planning, and reduce\nwaste (by eliminating overpayments of salaries and benefits); the payroll and human resource\nmanagement system will be fully consistent with the financial management systems being\nconcurrently developed. Further enhancements, beyond the PSP, will include capacity building\nat all levels of the public service to enable smooth implementation of processes for personnel\nmanagement, particularly at provincial and local government levels.\n33. The third dimension covers governance institutions closely related to the public service.\nThe  Ombudsman  Commission  and  the  Auditor  General's  Office,  under  the  PSP,  will  be\nstrengthened to enable them to perform their mandates. The steps beyond the PSP will depend\non the outcome of the review of central agencies and the parallel exercise to clarify and\nstrengthen  the  functions  and  relationships  of  other  key  central  agencies,  including  the\ndepartments of national planning and monitoring, justice and attorney general, and provincial\nand local level government.", "8\n34. The  fourth  dimension  involves  sector-specific  activities  to  improve  frontline  service\ndelivery. The PSP will cover pilot efforts in four provinces involving four basic services (health,\neducation, agriculture, transport infrastructure). The activities beyond the PSP are expected to\nprovide for replication in other provinces.\nD.  External Assistance to the Sector\n35. From 1998, ADB has been in policy dialogue with the Government regarding possible\nmeasures to improve public sector performance. However, the emerging macroeconomic crisis\nat  that  time  prevented  any  meaningful  progress.  The  opportunity  to  provide  substantial\nassistance on public service issues emerged when the new Government came to power in July\n1999. Following a request from the Government to support its structural reform intentions, ADB\nprovided a TA grant in October 1999 on governance and public sector reform. Since then, ADB\nhas been in close consultation with key multilateral (primarily IMF and the World Bank) and\nbilateral  funding  agencies  on  reform-related  issues  in  order  to  ensure  complementarity  of\nassistance and to avoid duplication or conflict in policy advice. IMF and World Bank assistance\nprograms continue to be targeted at fiscal and balance-of-payments issues, financial sector\nreform, and privatization of state-owned enterprises. In line with the Government\u2019s request, ADB\nhas focused on reform of the public service. Australia, the European Union, and Japan have\nancillary  assistance  programs  linked  to  progress  on  the  IMF  and  World  Bank  programs.\nAccordingly, ADB\u2019s program is well-focused and complements the assistance on structural\nreform provided from other sources.\nE.  ADB's Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n36. ADB\u2019s strategy for PNG, prepared in 1998, focuses on reducing poverty by improving\ngovernance,  developing  the  private  sector,  and  improving  social  indicators.  The  strategy\nsupports a mix of longer term systemic change and direct poverty interventions.\n37. Poor governance and weak public sector management have been the country\u2019s main\ndevelopment problems. For this reason, all ADB project loans, whether they cover national or\nsectoral issues, include support for strengthening governance and administration. The support\ninvolves measures to enhance public sector financial management, to build capacities of line\nagencies and provincial governments that provide essential services, and to strengthen central\nagencies and governance institutions.\n38. Past ADB assistance in support of public service reforms has drawn the following major\nconclusions: (i) governments need to have strong ownership of policy reforms, (ii) interventions\nhave to take account of local culture and capacities, (iii) effective institutionalization requires\ncareful sequencing or reforms, and (iv) external advisers and consultants need to be used\njudiciously to avoid creating dependency. The PSP has been designed with these key principles\nin mind.\nV.  THE PROGRAM\nA.  Rationale\n39. The quality of public sector management in PNG has deteriorated over the past decade.\nAs is strongly emphasized by the Government, weak governance is the root cause of the\nproblem. The public sector\u2019s capacity for designing and implementing sound policies and to\nmanage its responsibilities has been eroded.", "9\n40. A broad consensus has arisen that the situation must be reversed. The Government has\ncommitted itself to a program to restore the integrity of the public service. Beginning in 2000, the\nGovernment has drawn up a comprehensive plan of action for public sector strengthening, and\nits  implementation  is  now  under  way.  The  development  policy  letter  given  in  Appendix  2\nprovides the national picture and the broad structural adjustment agenda of the Government.\n41. Improving performance in the public sector is a major objective in the Government\u2019s\nSRP, alongside measures to sustain macroeconomic stability and remove barriers to private\nsector  development.  It  is  important  for  the  Government  to  demonstrate  improvements  in\nservices  to  the  general  public,  particularly  front-line  services  to  urban  and  rural  poor\ncommunities. The actions under the PSP are essential for beginning the needed reorientation of\nthe public service, which will require medium-term effort.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n42. The main objective of the loan is to support the Government\u2019s policy reform agenda and\nfinance  short-term  adjustment  costs  associated  with  the  PSP  to  ensure  effective\nimplementation. The PSP will support, as part of the broader development agenda of the\nGovernment, policy reform measures in four areas: (i) building a performance-oriented public\nservice,  (ii)  reorienting  personnel  management  systems  and  processes,  (iii)  strengthening\nprobity and oversight agencies, and (iv) improving delivery of major services. Accordingly, the\nPSP focuses on improved human resource management, civil service administration, policy\nchanges across the public sector, general management systems at the whole of government\nlevel, strengthening the probity and oversight agencies, and improving service delivery for basic\nservices, at the national and provincial levels. The kind of reforms envisaged will take time to\nachieve, and implementation will continue long after the release of ADB funds.\nC.  Policy Framework and Actions\n43. Appendix 1 gives a comprehensive development of the program framework and the\nactions to be supplied under the PSP. These are divided into four components or set of\nactivities as described below.\n1. Building a Performance-Oriented Public Service\n44. In  past  attempts  to  reform  the  public  service,  political  support  and  central  agency\nleadership and coordination have been missing. However, the current Government has moved\nto ensure that the appropriate mechanisms and processes at the central level are in place to\ncontrol the strategic direction of the reform program. Along these lines, the Government has\ntransformed the policy making process. At the level of the National Executive Council (NEC),\nwhich is the cabinet, a streamlined system of committees has been put in place to make sure\nthat Government agencies are fully consulted on policy matters relevant to their mandate,\nemphasizing  the  need  for  proper  coordination  between  the  bureaucratic  and  the  political\ndecision making levels. A thorough review of the functioning of the NEC secretariat resulted in a\nmajor overhaul of cabinet processes. The roles of NEC, the NEC secretariat, central agencies,\nand  line  departments  have  been  clarified.  Procedures  regarding  policy  submissions  and\ndecision making have been strengthened. All decisions taken by NEC are now widely publicized\n(subject to national security considerations), greatly improving transparency.\n45. To  improve  coordination,  the  Government  has  established  the  Central  Agencies\nCoordination Committee (CACC) to oversee and coordinate the reform program. The CACC\ncomprises the permanent heads of the central agencies: Department of the Prime Minister and", "10\nNational  Executive  Council  (PMNEC),  Department  of  Treasury,  Department  of  Finance,\nDepartment  of  National  Planning  and  Monitoring,  Department  of  Personnel  Management\n(DPM), and the Department of Justice and Attorney General. The CACC has been meeting\nregularly  to  review  the  reform  program  and  for  general  policy  development  matters.  A\nsecretariat  has  been  formed  to  support  the  activities  of  CACC;  its  capacities  are  being\nstrengthened.  In  related  efforts,  the  Government  has  been  reviewing  the  roles  and\nresponsibilities  of  the  central  agencies,  with  a  view  to  developing  a  new,  more  effective\nconfiguration of central government functions.\n46. The NEC has made a significant policy commitment to build a results-oriented culture in\nthe public service, beginning at the highest levels of Government, and has directed the central\nagencies to work together to establish management systems and procedures to ensure that\nstaff incentive systems are sensitive to performance. To help coordinate this task, the NEC\nestablished the Public Sector Reform Management Unit (PSRMU) to provide guidance. The\nNEC has also approved the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct of the Public Service, and a\nrevised general order on its application will be issued shortly by the Department of Personnel\nManagement.\n47. Several key reform actions are planned in the coming year to deliver the message that\nthe Government is determined to achieve significant improvement in results to the public. First,\nPMNEC will be vested with the responsibility for performance monitoring and evaluation of\ndepartment heads and departments. That responsibility is currently with DPM, which does not\nhave the resources or the political clout to handle this task effectively. Second, the Chief\nSecretary will be assigned disciplinary powers over all department secretaries and provincial\nadministrators.  Third,  the  NEC  will  require  department  heads  in  future  to  submit  annual\nperformance plans and annual performance (accomplishment) reports to PMNEC. At the same\ntime, the 2002 budget circular (released at the end of August 2001) requires the annual budget\nsubmissions to be accompanied by annual performance targets and outputs of the agencies\nconcerned. Fourth, all departments will be required to submit annual updates of corporate plans\nand annual performance reports, which are also to be available to the public and the media.\nInitial submissions of these documents to the CACC will begin in mid-2002 for central agencies\nand major service departments (health, education, and works and transport). Finally, at the staff\nlevel,  a  strengthened  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  (and  associated\nimplementation plan) is being prepared for approval by the CACC.\n2. Reorienting Personnel Management Systems and Processes\n48. The  professionalism,  integrity,  and  independence  of  the  public  service  has  been\nundermined over the past decade as a result of arbitrary decisions. The capacity of the public\nservice to deliver on its responsibilities has been compromised. Departments and agencies\nhave lost a spectrum of skills that are required in an effective public service.\n49. A  detailed  improvement  plan  for  managing  and  developing  public  service  human\nresources has been developed. The aim is to improve human resource management by (i)\nreestablishing  the  Public  Services  Commission  (PSC)  as  an  independent  and  competent\ngovernance agency for the public service; (ii) reconstructing the DPM as a central agency\ncapable of providing the human resource development strategic management for the CACC and\nthe wider public service; and (iii) reforming the Institute of Public Administration to produce,\ntrain, and develop the next generation of skilled and professional public servants.", "11\n50. A detailed plan for public sector human resources management and development has\nbeen prepared covering organizational redesign, capacity building, strategic policy analysis, and\nimplementation. The intention is to professionalize the public service. Merit-based recruitment\nand selection procedures are being introduced. A senior executive service system has been\nendorsed to improve the preparation and capacity of the senior ranks\u2014this will include a\nmentoring  system  and  training  programs.  A  new  protocol  for  the  selection,  retention,\ntermination, and transfer of departmental heads is being introduced to improve stability, ensure\nobjectivity in personnel decisions, and prevent arbitrary or irregular action (from the political\nlevel) with respect to the executive corps of the civil service. The General Orders are also being\nrevised to ensure consistency with principles of fairness, nondiscrimination, due process, and\ntransparency.  Training  systems  are  being  strengthened,  with  improved  resourcing  and\nmanagement. The PSC is being strengthened with increased resources and greater powers; in\nparticular, PSC's decisions will be made binding. An immediate aim is to reduce the large\nbacklog of unresolved PSC cases.\n51. Inadequate  personnel  control  systems  and  procedures  have  undermined  efforts  to\nreduce public service employment and control payroll costs in recent years. The process of\ntransferring activities to provincial governments has contributed to slowly increasing aggregate\npublic  sector  employment.  The  Government  is  committed  to  reversing  this  trend.  The\nGovernment has maintained a hiring freeze throughout the public sector since 1999, except in\nsome  priority  areas,  including  health,  education,  and  law  enforcement.  A  new  payroll  and\nhuman  resource  management  system  is  being  introduced;  it  will  improve  costing  and\nforecasting, and help eliminate fraudulent payments. The payroll and human resource system is\nbeing closely linked with the new budget and expenditure control systems. Employee status,\nremuneration and benefits are being verified in coordination with the introduction of the new\nhuman  resource  management  and  payroll  system  which  will  help  eliminate  erroneous\npayments. Retrenchments are being carried out on a carefully selected basis with a view to\nreducing the payroll cost while maintaining suitable levels of service delivery.\n3. Strengthening of Probity and Oversight Agencies\n52. For the process to be sustainable, the public service needs to be open, transparent, and\naccountable  to  the  community.  For  this  reason,  the  key  oversight  organizations  (Auditor\nGeneral's Office, Department of Justice and Attorney General, and Ombudsman Commission)\nare  being  strengthened.  Their  effective  functioning  can  also  help  to  deter  corruption  and\narbitrary action. Detailed action plans have been developed, and work has begun to implement\nthem. The action plans include measures to ensure that the agencies receive a budget that will\npermit them to carry out their mandates.\n53. The Auditor General\u2019s Office has a key role in ensuring the financial accountability of the\nGovernment. The implementation of the action plan to strengthen the Auditor General\u2019s Office\nwill  help  in  the  timely  completion  of  the  audits  of  the  2000  and  2001  accounts  of  the\nGovernment. Moreover, the effectiveness of the Auditor General\u2019s Office is being enhanced by\ncontracting out part of the audit work program to private firms. In 2001, under a contract with a\nprivate  auditing  firm,  the  financial  and  control  systems  of  the  Department  of  Health  were\naudited, resulting in significant recommendations for reducing wastage and tightening controls\nin local government funding, personnel management, procurement, and distribution systems.\nBecause  of  the  success  of  the  audit,  a  similar  independent  audit  of  the  Department  of\nEducation\u2019s financial and control systems will be conducted, also under the auspices of the\nAuditor General\u2019s Office. The Government intends to continue outsourcing to permit the backlog", "12\nof unaudited accounts, including those for statutory bodies and certain Government agencies, to\nbe cleared in the next 1-2 years.\n54. For  both  the  Ombudsman  Commission  and  the  Auditor  General\u2019s  Office,  a  major\nweakness was the inadequacy of budget resources. Funding was increased substantially in the\n2000  and  2001  budgets.  The  2002  budget  for  the  two  agencies  will  ensure  the  resource\nrequirements identified in the action plans. The Department of Justice and Attorney General is\nalso being strengthened under a program funded by the Australian Agency for International\nDevelopment (AusAID); special attention, in this regard, is being given to building the capacity\nof  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  so  it  can  work  in  tandem  with  the\nombudsman to prepare and process complaints to bring erring public officials to account in the\ncourts.\n4. Improving Delivery of Major Services\n55. Preliminary functional and expenditure reviews of selected Government departments\nand agencies began in 2000, with external assistance, notably from ADB. Each department\u2019s\nhuman resource requirements and administrative performance were evaluated, with a view to\nidentifying areas for improved organization of roles and functioning, for possible savings, where\nadditional resources are needed, and where other nongovernment agents might perform better.\n56. As a result of these initial reviews, 1,380 civil servants have been retrenched during\n2001, and a further 1,400 have been identified for retrenchment together with some 2,000\u2013\n2,250 soldiers. Further retrenchments are likely to be identified through the functional and\nexpenditure  review  process.  A  training  program  for  retrenched  public  servants  is  being\ndeveloped. Care is being given to ensure that the retrenched staff and positions are those that\nare redundant or are not required for the delivery of major services to the public.\n57. A key focus of the reforms being supported under the PSP is strengthening the delivery\nof the key basic services\u2014health, education, primary industry, transport infrastructure. This will\ninclude supply of services by churches and other nongovernment agencies, as well as direct\nsupply by Government. The emphasis is to improve the processes and procedures. Working at\nthe provincial level, initially in four pilot provinces, and bringing together key decision makers at\nnational and provincial levels in a dialogue with the two central agency functions (human\nresource  management  and  finance),  service  improvement  plans  have  been  developed  to\naddress  key  issues  (including  the  effect  on  churches  and  other  nongovernment  service\nproviders). Common themes emerge: (i) inadequate supplies, equipment, and systems; (ii)\ninadequately  qualified  personnel;  (iii)  inadequate  infrastructure;  (iv) inadequate  coordination\namong service providers (public and nongovernment); and (v) poor community awareness of\nservice delivery issues. The solutions comprise improvements in staff capacities and processes\nthat  can  be  introduced  with  little  additional  resources  and  structural  and  infrastructure\nimprovements that will require additional resourcing. The 2001 budget and general Government\nplans provide for substantially increased funding of local services. The emphasis under the PSP\nis to improve the processes by which the existing human and other resources are used to\ndeliver needed services. To facilitate the procedural and process improvements, the Service\nImprovement Support Group has been established centrally to provide advisory support to line\nagencies and provincial agencies. Complementing the work at the provincial level, for each of\nthe  basic  services,  initial  service  improvement  plans  have  been  developed.  The  ongoing\nfunctional and expenditure reviews will lead to longer term plans of action aiming at more deep-\nseated reforms in the way services are delivered at provincial and national levels.", "13\n58. The  emphasis  in  each  agency  is  to  improve  service  delivery  through  focus  on\nperformance. Each of the central line agencies will develop and publish service standards for all\nservices, cost the resources necessary to provide the standards of service, develop an internal\npolicy  development  capacity,  develop  a  continuous  improvement  support  facility,  establish\nperformance reporting data, and set monitorable targets for the central services. Each central\nline agency will second facilitators to the Service Improvement Support Group, and they will be\ntrained in continuous improvement techniques and then apply these techniques starting with\ncentral agencies and moving to the provinces. Each pilot province will establish teams to map,\nbenchmark,  and  improve  priority  services;  develop  simple  reporting  systems;  and  coach\ndeliverers  to  improve  service  quality.  Each  pilot  province  will  establish  service  quality\nimprovement teams in the provincial administrations. These teams will concentrate on priority\nservices, coaching district and provincial teams in improving their productivity. Award programs\nwill be established to recognize and reward high performing staff and service delivery units.\nD.  Social and Environmental Issues\n1. Social Impact\n59. The poverty impact of the PSP is discussed in Appendix 4. In summary, implementation\nof the PSP and the funding support provided by the PSP loan will result in improved public\nservice delivery. Higher and more focused public spending will provide greater access to key\npublic services by the poor in four provinces. Hence, the major positive impact on the poor of\nthe PSP is increased access to basic public services.\n60. In addition, there will be indirect positive impact through the labor market, by enabling\nmore private sector activity. This in turn will increase the chances of higher economic growth\nand employment creation. The increased demand is likely to benefit those in formal employment\nprimarily, and may generate some employment in the informal sector.\n61. The loan will support the Government's efforts to maintain a stable macroeconomic\nenvironment while implementing the SRP. It will cover short- and medium-term adjustment costs\nduring 2001-2003. It will augment foreign reserves and thus alleviate any speculative pressure\non the currency that could lead to depreciation and higher prices. On the other hand, the easing\nof the constraint on public expenditure will increase aggregate demand, which will increase the\ngeneral price level. The net effect cannot be predicted, but is unlikely to have a significant\nimmediate impact on poverty. In the medium to long run, the structural adjustments are likely to\nresult in improved productivity and a positive supply response with a beneficial impact on\npoverty.\n62. The PSP loan may increase the likelihood of a nominal appreciation of the currency,\nwhich could have a negative effect on the poor insofar as they are net producers of traded\ngoods and net consumers of nontraded goods. Against this, the PSP underpins the provision of\nbasic services at zero or nominal charges, thus benefiting the poor. The net effect of relative\nprice shifts is difficult to predict, but is in any case substantially overshadowed by the positive\nimpact on the availability of public goods and services with the PSP.\n63. The impact on transfers through direct Government programs is largely covered by the\npoverty impact assessment matrix category of access of the poor to nonmarketed public goods\nand  services.  In  addition,  however,  the  PSP  will  enhance  the  capacity  to  formulate  and\nimplement public works programs in which the poor are given work.", "14\n64. Accordingly, the PSP will have a significant positive impact on the poor because of the\npositive effect of basic public services. The public service will become performance oriented,\nand public expenditure on the services essential to poverty alleviation will increase. The direct\npositive  effect  will  be  reinforced  by  the  indirect  positive  effects  of  a  better  governance\nenvironment and improved public administration on economic growth.\n65. The CACC will retain the responsibility for overall coordination of the PSP, while the\nPSRMU established by the NEC will be responsible for coordination on a daily basis. General\nmonitoring  of  PSP  implementation  will  be  undertaken  by  ADB  in  partnership  with  the\nGovernment on a regular basis\u2014formal joint reviews by ADB and PSRMU will be undertaken\nevery six months, supplementing PSRMU reports every three months. For assessing the PSP\u2019s\nimpact on poverty, key performance indicators will be the share of public expenditure allocated\nto basic service provision in rural areas (details of this allocation are available for the health\nsector  and  are  being  developed  for  education),  and  the  extent  of  client  satisfaction  with\nprovincial service delivery as revealed in surveys. A system of client satisfaction surveys will be\nestablished under the program, to be contracted out to qualified commercial organizations.\nResults of the latter are to be documented in the reports of line ministries to CACC. Ultimately,\nprogress in reducing poverty may be evaluated through regular poverty analyses based on\ncomparable household survey data.\n2. Environmental Issues\n66. The PSP is classified as Category C by ADB\u2019s environmental classification system. Its\nenvironmental  impact  is  expected  to  be  minimal.  The  PSP  does  not  deal  directly  with\nenvironmental concerns. Other funding agencies, particularly AusAID and the World Bank, are\nproviding  assistance  and  supporting  reforms  to  deal  with  resource  and  environmental\nmanagement  issues,  notably  in  the  forestry  sector,  where  there  remain  significant  issues.\nHowever, the corruption-reducing effects of the PSP should be of particular benefit in the\nforestry sector.\nVI.  THE PROPOSED LOAN\nA.  Amount of Loan and Source of Funds\n67. It is proposed that ADB provide from its ordinary capital resources a loan of $70 million\nto support the PSP, as part of the Government\u2019s SRP. The amount of the loan is based on the\ncost of the ongoing structural adjustment, including direct costs of the PSP, and reflects the\nimportance and urgency of the reforms, the state of the public finances in PNG, and the\navailability of funding for the Government\u2019s overall program. The loan and its proposed use\nhave been included in the Government\u2019s agreement with IMF. The loan funds will be released in\ntwo tranches. The first tranche of $35 million will be made available when the loan becomes\neffective; the net amount disbursed will reflect amounts due to ADB, including the front-end fee\non the loan and recovery of project preparatory TA costs. The second tranche of $35 million will\nbe made available when all conditions for release of the second tranche have been fulfilled, as\nspecified  in  the  policy  matrix.  This  is  targeted  for  September  2002;  however,  should  the\nconditions be satisfied earlier, then the second tranche may be released earlier.\nB.  Interest, Maturity, and Disbursement Period\n68. The loan will have a maturity of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest\nrate determined in accordance with the ADB\u2019s lending facility based on the London interbank\noffer  rate  (LIBOR);  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75  percent  per  annum;  a  front-end  fee  of", "15\n1.0 percent  (which  will  be  capitalized  in  the  loan  and  deducted  from  the  first  tranche);\nconversion options that may be exercised in accordance with the terms of the draft Loan\nAgreement,  the  Loan  Regulation,  and  ADB\u2019s  Conversion  Guidelines;  and  other  terms  and\nconditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the\nreasons for PNG\u2019s decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of\nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) assurance that these choices were PNG's own independent\ndecision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  of  ADB.  The  loan  is\nexpected to be disbursed over a 10-month period, with PSP implementation continuing until the\nend of 2003.\nC.  Implementation Arrangements\n69. To ensure appropriate, high-level, and effective coordination during implementation of\nthe PSP, the CACC will be tasked with overall coordination, in consultation with the heads of the\nconcerned agencies. The Government has established a secretariat to support CACC activities\nand  will  provide  the  secretariat  with  necessary  staff  and  resources,  acceptable  to  ADB,\nthroughout PSP implementation. The Department of Treasury will be the Executing Agency for\nthe PSP (with primary responsibility for the loan and loan funds). PMNEC will be responsible for\nthe PSP and its overall implementation. Key agencies to be involved in PSP implementation will\nbe DPM, the Department of Finance, and the Department of National Planning and Monitoring.\nThe implementation will be coordinated on a day-to-day basis by the PSRMU and will be\nundertaken by all concerned agencies. External assistance for implementation will be provided\nunder the PSP.\nD.  Disbursement and Procurement\n70. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed against a broad range of imports with the\ncounterpart funds generated to be used to support the costs of PSP implementation and related\nadjustment costs. The proceeds of the loan will be used only to finance the foreign exchange\ncosts of items produced and procured in ADB member countries except the ineligible items\n(Appendix 5) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The Government\nwill submit with each withdrawal request a certification that the value of total net eligible imports\nis expected to be equal to or greater than the amount of the ADB projected disbursements\nunder the PSP loan in a given period, and that the required withdrawal will be used to finance\neligible items procured in accordance with the loan agreement provisions. ADB will have the\nright to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government's\ncertification. Procurement using loan funds will be based on normal commercial practice by the\nprivate sector, except that goods commonly traded on international commodity markets will be\nprocured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade. ADB will continue to ensure\nthat  standard  public  and  private  procurement  procedures  used  in  PNG  are  adequate  in\ncompetition and efficiency.\nE.  Counterpart Funds\n71. Counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the PSP will be used to finance local\ncounterpart costs related to the implementation of the PSP and the SRP during 2001\u20132003. An\nindicative allocation of use of the funds has been agreed. The Government will ensure that\nsufficient counterpart funds are made available to meet the costs associated with implementing\nthe PSP. The PSP funds will enable the Government to continue its retrenchment program\n(initially  $13  million)  including  the  costs  of  repatriation,  begin  implementing  the  service\nimprovement  plans  and  departmental  functional  review  recommendations  ($8 million),  and\nbegin implementing the new payroll and human resource management system ($4 million). It", "16\nwill also help finance the Government\u2019s ongoing program of privatization and regulatory and\ncompetition reviews ($12 million), and other structural reform activities ($3 million). Any amounts\nnot  needed  for  these  direct  structural  adjustment  costs  will  be  used,  as  agreed  by  the\nGovernment and ADB, to enable the Government to continue its program of retiring the most\nexpensive (mostly domestic) public debt and arrears. This program of expenditures is fully\nconsistent with the agreed IMF and World Bank programs.\nF.  Monitoring and Tranching\n72. ADB will carry out periodic reviews of progress in implementing the PSP. Formal reviews\nwill be undertaken jointly by ADB and the PSRMU (with CACC supervision) every six months.\nThe Government will keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions that are with\nother multilateral and bilateral aid agencies and that have implications for implementation of the\nSRP. The representatives of the Government, ADB, and other major funding agencies for the\nSRP will meet at least every six months to review implementation of the overall SRP and the\nPSP. The meetings will continue after the closing of the loan and will cover at least the PSP\nperiod to the end of 2003. A key focus of monitoring will be performance on the broad policy\nreforms; external assistance is to be made available as required, both under the PSP and in\nseparate initiatives.\n73. In addition to quarterly progress reports on PSP performance (to be prepared by the\nPSRMU), the Government will submit a program completion report to ADB within three months\nof the loan closing date. This report will evaluate the implementation of the policy reform\nmeasures under the PSP, their impact on the economy, lessons learned during the PSP period,\nand further reforms and assistance required in the medium term.\n74. The loan funds will be released in two tranches of equal size. The tranche release\nconditions are contained in the policy matrix (Appendix 3). The first tranche ($35 million), from\nwhich the loan front-end fee and project preparatory TA costs will be deducted, will be made\navailable after loan effectiveness (expected December 2001). The second tranche ($35 million)\nwill be disbursed upon compliance with second tranche conditions. The second release is\ntargeted for September 2002. However, at Government request, the release could be advanced,\nif release conditions have been satisfied.\nVII.  PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA.  Benefits\n75. The PSP will help the Government's efforts to place the economy on a sound and\nsustainable path and to begin to establish an effective and efficient public service, capable of\ndelivering basic services. The PSP will help begin to improve the effectiveness of the public\nservice  by  introducing  a  performance  orientation  and  accountability  mechanisms,  and  by\nhelping to streamline procedures. The PSP will help to achieve fiscal balance by trimming the\nsize of the public service, including measures to mitigate harmful impacts by financing the\ncompensation packages for retrenched public servants. Reduction in expensive public debt will\nreduce debt servicing. The PSP will help revitalize the operations of the public service by\nreforming personnel management, and introducing stronger and more effective human resource\ndevelopment mechanisms. The PSP will also be instrumental in assisting the Government to\nrestore the integrity of public institutions.", "17\nB.  Poverty Impact\n76. Implementation of the PSP and the funding support provided by the PSP loan will ensure\nimproved public service delivery. In particular, access by the poor in four provinces to key public\nservices will increase as a result of more focused public spending. Hence, the major positive\nimpact on the poor will be increased access to basic public services.\n77. In addition, the PSP will have some indirect positive effects through the labor market.\nWith public service and governance reforms, the private sector will be able to increase its\nactivity.  This  in  turn  will  help  accelerate  economic  growth  and  consequently  contribute  to\nemployment creation. Public spending will then increase, and will increase the demand for labor\nindirectly. The increased demand is likely to primarily benefit people in formal employment, and\nmay generate employment for people in the informal sector.\n78. In regard to relative price movements, the provision of the PSP loan may increase the\nlikelihood of a nominal appreciation of the currency, which could have a negative effect on the\npoor who are net producers of traded goods and net consumers of nontraded goods. However,\nthe PSP loan will support the provision of publicly-supplied services at zero or nominal charges,\nthus benefiting the poor. The net effect of relative price shifts is difficult to predict, but will in any\ncase be substantially overshadowed by the positive impact on the availability of public goods\nand services under the PSP. In addition, the PSP will encourage a greater capacity to formulate\nand implement public works programs that provide job opportunities for the poor.\n79. In sum, the PSP will have a significant positive impact on the poor because of a direct\npositive effect on the provision of basic public services. The public services will improve as\nmanagement  focuses  on  performance  and  public  expenditure  on  the  services  essential  to\npoverty alleviation is increased. The direct positive effect will be reinforced by the indirect\npositive effects of a better governance environment and improved public administration on\neconomic growth.\nC.  Risks\n80. A  major  risk  relates  to  the  adequacy  of  agency  capacity  and  human  and  budget\nresources. Improving this capacity is the long-term goal of the reform process. The risk has\nbeen mitigated by specifically targeting PSP activities to begin the necessarily long process of\nstrengthening public sector management and achievement. Consultants will be used to help in\nparticular reform tasks where Government capacities are insufficient.\n81. Another risk to the successful implementation of the PSP is that adversely affected\ngroups may seek to undermine the content and the timing of the reforms. Such risks have been\nmitigated by the strong commitment of senior officials to continue with the reforms. The most\nimmediately affected are those being retrenched, whose potential resistance is to be mitigated\nby appropriate compensation.\n82. There are also risks relating to the sustainability of the measures. These have been\nminimized by restricting the recurrent implications of the reform measures as much as possible,\nand by focusing the PSP on priority restructuring needs. The loan will not be used to finance\nexisting recurrent budget requirements.", "18\nVIII.  ASSURANCES\n83. In addition to the conditions for tranche releases and the standard assurances, the\nGovernment has assured ADB that\n(i)  the policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Loan Agreement,\nas described in the Government's development policy letter of 14 November\n2001 and the policy matrix, will continue in effect for the duration of the PSP, and\n(ii)  it will promptly adopt the other policies and take the other actions included in the\nPSP,  as  described  in  the  policy  matrix,  and  ensure  that  these  policies  and\nactions continue in effect for the duration of the PSP.\n84. It  was  also  agreed  that  the  Government  and  ADB  will  continue  their  dialogue  on\nproblems and constraints encountered during the implementation of the PSP and of the broader\nSRP, including difficulties encountered in the monitoring process. The Government has assured\nADB that it will keep ADB informed of policy discussions concerning the SRP undertaken with\nother international and bilateral agencies as ADB may reasonably request, and will provide ADB\nwith the opportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals.\nIX.  RECOMMENDATION\n85.

Introduction\n1.  Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian\nDevelopment Bank1 identifies good governance, social development, and sustainable economic\ngrowth as the three pillars of an effective poverty reduction strategy.

The  governance  environment\ndeteriorated significantly; there was little, if any, progress as measured by social development\nindicators; and economic growth slowed down as the effects of external economic shocks were\ncompounded by macroeconomic mismanagement.  Over 37 percent of the population was\nbelow the national poverty line in 1996.\n2.  The Government that won office in July 1999 formulated the Structural Reform Program\n(SRP) 2000 with the key objectives of promoting good governance, sustaining macroeconomic\nstability,  improving  public  sector  performance,  and  removing  barriers  to  investment  and\neconomic development.  The proposed Public Service Program (PSP) will play a pivotal role in\nthe achievement of good governance and improved public sector performance in PNG, and\nthereby  will  promote  the  broad-based  economic  growth  and  social  development  that  are\nessential if poverty is to be reduced. The PSP will build a performance orientation in the public\nservice that emphasizes service delivery, transparency, and accountability. It will ensure the\nsupportive  strengthening  of  personnel  management  systems  and  processes;  and  it  will\nstrengthen  the  key  governance  agencies  (the  Auditor  General's  Office  and  Ombudsman\nCommission). The PSP will make delivery of major services at national and subnational levels\nmore predictable and effective. Service improvement plans for health, education, agriculture,\nand transport infrastructure will be formulated and implemented in four rural provinces\u2014one\nfrom each of PNG\u2019s four regions. This improvement in public service delivery to rural areas is\nthe major means by which PSP will alleviate PNG\u2019s serious poverty problem.\nB.  Poverty Analysis\n3. Most of the people of PNG remain poor by regional and international standards, though\nsome  economic  and  social  progress  has  been  made  since  independence.  The  human\ndevelopment index (HDI), as measured by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),\nrose from 0.325 in 1970 to 0.507 in 1995, with life expectancy rising from 40 to 54 years.2  The\nHDI score for 1998 of 0.542 placed PNG in 133rd position on a list of 174 developing countries.\nAmong Pacific Island countries, PNG ranked last on the HDI scale.3  In the area of health, there\nwas some evidence of regress in the 1990s.4\n4.  The human poverty index for PNG is at the level of Burundi and Mali, which are among the\nmost poverty afflicted nations in the world.  On the evidence from a 1996 household survey, 31.0\n                                                          \n1 R179-99: Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific\u2014The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development\nBank, 19 October.\n2  UNDP. 1998.

Pacific Human\nDevelopment Report 1999: Creating Opportunities. Suva, Fiji. In the former report, the HDI is calculated using real\ngross domestic product (GDP) per capita in purchasing power parity dollars. In the latter report, real GDP per\ncapita in dollars converted at market exchange rates is used, thus generating lower GDP per capita and HDI\nnumbers.\n4  UNDP. 1998.

Using a slightly\nhigher country-specific poverty line, 37.5 percent of the population is living in poverty, with their\naverage consumption level being two-thirds of the poverty line consumption level of 461 kina\n(1996 prices) per adult equivalent per year.6  Approximately 17 percent of the PNG population\ncannot meet the basic requirement of 2,200 calories per day per adult equivalent, even if they\nspend all their income on food.\n 5. Poverty coexists with wealth. The richest 10 percent of the population account for 36\npercent of consumption, whereas the poorest 50 percent account for just 20 percent. The Gini\ncoefficient of 0.461 is high by comparison with countries of similar income levels. This is in large\npart a reflection of the dualistic pattern of growth since independence. Growth has been led by a\ncapital-intensive minerals sector generating state revenues that substantially have been used to\nsupport  consumption  by  an  urban,  public  sector  elite.  The  vast  majority  of  the  population\ncontinues to depend on semi-subsistence activities. Per capita real gross domestic product in the\nnonmining economy grew at the average rate of just 0.2 percent per annum during 1978\u20131998,\ncompared with an aggregate per capita growth rate of 1.1 percent.\n6.  Poverty in PNG has an important regional dimension. The vast majority of the poor (93.5\npercent) live in rural areas. The Momase/North Coast Region exhibits the highest incidence of\npoverty, with 45.8 percent of the population living below the poverty line. Poverty rates in the\nregions of Papua/South Coast, the Highlands, and the New Guinea Islands are 33.2 percent, 35.8\npercent, and 33.6 percent, respectively. Momase/North Coast and the Highlands together account\nfor 73.8 percent of the poor. The urbanized National Capital District has a poverty rate of 25.8\npercent, and accounts for just 3.8 percent of the poor.\n7.  Comparisons of poverty rates at the provincial level are not possible because of lack of\ndata, but provincial human poverty and human development indexes have been calculated and\nare presented in Table A4.1. These show that poverty and low levels of human development are\nespecially problematic in two north coast provinces (west and east Sepik), and the five highlands\nprovinces (Eastern Highlands, Enga, Simbu, Southern Highlands, and Western Highlands).\n8. Poverty and low levels of human development also have an important gender dimension\n(Table A4.1). Although improving over time, the gender-related development index is lower than\nthe overall HDI at the national level and for all provinces, demonstrating that women\u2019s life\nexpectancy, income, and educational levels are universally below men\u2019s. Indeed, PNG is one of\nthe few countries in the world where women have a lower life expectancy than men. While\nwomen  are  under  represented  in  senior  positions  in  the  private  and  public  sectors,  the\nprofessions, and politics, they do a disproportionately large amount of work in the rural sector.7\n9.  Most poor households are located in relatively inaccessible rural areas, and exhibit some\nnotable characteristics that suggest areas of potential poverty-alleviating interventions.  Almost\n52 percent of the poor live in households whose head has never attended school. The poverty\n                                                          \n5  The World Bank. 1999.

A further 23 percent of the poor live in households\nwhose head has not been educated beyond grade 6. The poverty rate for these households is\n41 percent. Clearly, there has been little, if any, human capital investment in three quarters of\nthe poor households. Girls\u2019 enrollment rates are significantly influenced by the education level of\nadult females in the household, so that there is a vicious circle of low enrollments-low levels of\nschooling-low enrollments that will be broken most effectively by targeted intervention. The\nincidence of poverty is also linked to the ability to earn cash income to pay for nonfood items, to\nvary and improve diets, and to permit savings for times of economic difficulty (e.g., drought).\nAlmost 17 percent of the poor population live in households whose heads earn no cash income,\nrelying entirely on subsistence production (and perhaps gifts of cash). The poverty rate for these\nhouseholds is 47 percent. Almost 8 percent of the poor are in households whose main source of\ncash income is hunting, gathering, and fishing. The poverty rate for these households is 57\npercent. Poverty rates are also above the national average for households that earn cash\nincome  from  tree  crops  (44.0  percent)  and  commercial  agriculture  (42.7  percent).  These\nhouseholds account for 42.5 percent and 19.0 percent of the poor population, respectively.\nWhere household heads earn cash income from running a business or wage employment,\npoverty rates are much lower (at 25 percent and 17 percent, respectively). Although the latter\nhouseholds collectively account for 29 percent of PNG\u2019s total population, they account for only\n14 percent of the poor population. In general, increased provision of opportunities for earning\nsecure cash incomes is needed to reduce the incidence and severity of poverty.\n10.  Both  the  extent  of  income-earning  opportunities  and  the  ability  to  respond  to  such\nopportunities are determined to a significant degree by access to the basic public services of\ntransport,  utilities,  health,  and  education.  The  PNG  population  as  a  whole  expressed\nconsiderable dissatisfaction with access to services in 1996, and it is highly likely that the\ndegree of dissatisfaction increased during the late 1990s as a result of a widely-acknowledged\ndeterioration  in  service  provision.  Table  A4.2  shows  that  the  poorest  25  percent  of  the\npopulation is the most dissatisfied quintile overall, and that dissatisfaction is highest in the\nHighlands  and  Momase/North  Coast  regions  where  the  majority  of  the  poor  live.  Poverty\nalleviation requires improved service delivery to rural areas.\n11. PNG has an informal social safety net system (the wantok system) that provides for\nincome transfers in cash and kind, labor transfers, and sharing of gardening and child care.\nHowever, the system is limited in its effectiveness in communities with very high poverty rates,\nand when whole communities are affected by natural disasters (such as volcanic eruption in\nRabaul). Disaster relief is provided through the Government\u2019s National Disaster and Emergency\nService, and by a number of nongovernment organizations, though both suffer from human and\nfinancial resource constraints. The formal social safety net provided by provident funds is limited\nto wage earners, and has been weakened by the past poor performance of the funds.\nC. Assessing the Impact of Reforms under the PSP\n12. A full assessment of the impact of the PSP on poverty requires comparing the situation\nwith and without the PSP. Conceptually, the only rigorous means of assessing the without-PSP\nscenario is to use a social accounting matrix, computable general equilibrium model, or a\ncombination of the two. However, theoretical issues and practical problems limit the operational\nusefulness of this approach. Such models do not cope well with reform measures such as\ninstitutional change in the public service because these are difficult to express quantitatively.\nInstead, analysis must be largely qualitative and supplemented where possible by selective\nquantification. ADB\u2019s Poverty Impact Assessment matrix is used as a means of organizing and\nsummarizing this analysis (Table A4.3).", "52 Appendix 4, page 4\nTable A4.1: Provincial Development, 1996\nHuman Poverty Human Development Gender-Related\nProvince Index Index Development Index\nWest Sepik 60.0 0.262 0.234\nSouthern Highlands 56.7 0.274 0.244\nWestern Highlands 55.5 0.282 0.261\nSimbu 54.1 0.320 0.298\nEastern Highlands 53.9 0.325 0.297\nEnga 52.4 0.283 0.243\nEast Sepik 47.3 0.304 0.282\nMadang 43.4 0.336 0.313\nGulf 40.0 0.331 0.312\nManus 39.4 0.421 0.393\nMorobe 39.3 0.389 0.330\nNew Ireland 36.6 0.396 0.376\nOro (Northern) 36.5 0.386 0.356\nWestern 32.2 0.472 0.381\nWest New Britain 31.9 0.394 0.368\nEast New Britain 31.8 0.431 0.395\nMilne Bay 31.4 0.420 0.387\nCentral 30.9 0.408 0.384\nNational Capital District 14.5 0.758 0.506\nNational 43.7 0.363 0.318\nNotes: Data for Bougainville Province are not available.

The PNG Government acknowledges the validity of the public perception that the core\nfunctions of public sector management have not been fulfilled efficiently or effectively in the past", "53 Appendix 4, page 5\ndecade, and accepts that this government failure has adversely affected the rural poor most of\nall.  Revenue  administration,  public  expenditure  management,  and  public  administration\ndeteriorated in the 1990s as corruption and political patronage undermined the professional\nethos of the public service. As shown in Table A4.2, while there is widespread dissatisfaction\nwith public service delivery, the dissatisfaction is most intense in the poorest rural regions.\nThere is a clear and positive correlation between the level of consumption and the degree of\nsatisfaction with access to health care, education, and transport facilities.\n14.  In the absence of the PSP and associated loan funds, the provision of public services\nwill remain inefficient and unresponsive to the needs of society, and the short- and medium-term\nbudget  constraint  on  public  expenditure  will  be  tighter  than  with  the  PSP.  The  general\nimprovement in the governance environment that is necessary to stimulate private sector-led\neconomic growth will not occur; and there will be no improvement in service delivery to rural\nareas  through  either  increased  public  spending  and/or  an  effective  reallocation  of  public\nspending.\n15.  As observed in ADB\u2019s study of poverty in the Pacific, \u201cpublic sector expenditure is one of\nthe keys to ensuring that the poor and underprivileged have equality of opportunity\u2026to transport\ninfrastructure that provides the rural population with access to markets, health services, and\neducation; to water and sanitation; to communication networks\u2026; to power that provides the\nlight necessary to study...\u201d8 Without the PSP and a program loan, access to these services by\nthe rural poor will not improve. Indeed, with the population growing at over 3 percent per annum,\naccess is likely to deteriorate if public spending neither increases sufficiently nor becomes more\neffectively targeted. Hence, in the poverty impact assessment matrix, the major negative impact\non the poor of the without-PSP scenario is reduced access to basic public services.\n16.  In addition to the major negative impact, there will be some indirect negative effects\nthrough the labor market. Without public service and governance reforms, there will be no\nimprovement  in  the  enabling  environment  for  the  private  sector.  This  in  turn  will  limit  the\nchances  of  accelerated  economic  growth  and  consequent  employment  creation.  Public\nspending  will  be  relatively  constrained,  reducing  demand  for  labor  indirectly,  and  perhaps\ndirectly if some public service downsizing is needed to maintain aggregate fiscal discipline.\n17.  The current administration is firmly committed to maintaining a stable macroeconomic\nenvironment, and has introduced legislation that ensures the central bank is independent and\nmay conduct sound monetary and exchange rate policies. This commitment is not likely to be\ndiminished without the PSP, but the absence of a program loan could make fulfillment of the\ncommitment more difficult. In particular, the economy will be more vulnerable to speculative\ncapital outflows that placed downward pressure on the currency, and thus upwards pressure on\nthe general price level. On the other hand, the constraint on public expenditure imposed by the\nlack of a program loan would have a deflationary effect. The net effect cannot be predicted,\ngiven the inherent uncertainty surrounding currency speculation.\n18.  In regard to relative price movements, the absence of a program loan may, as noted in\nthe previous paragraph, increase the likelihood of a nominal depreciation of the currency. To the\nextent that such a depreciation is not offset by inflation, and to the extent that the poor are net\nproducers of traded goods and net consumers of nontraded goods, there may be a positive\nimpact. However, this assumes there are no supply-side constraints, when in fact these seem to\nbe severe. In addition, within the nontraded goods sector, the absence of a program loan may\n                                                          \n8  ADB. 2001. Poverty: Is it an Issue in the Pacific?

If this were to\nhappen, the poor would be losers. The net effect of relative price shifts is difficult to predict, but\nis in any case substantially overshadowed by the impact on the availability of public goods and\nservices without the PSP.\n19.  The impact on transfers through direct government programs is largely covered by the\nPIA  matrix  category  of  access  of  the  poor  to  nonmarketed  public  goods  and  services.  In\naddition, however, without the PSP, the diminished capacity to formulate and implement public\nworks programs in which the poor are given work will further diminish.\n20.  In sum, without the PSP, the poor will suffer significant adverse impact because of a\ndirect negative effect on the provision of basic public services. The public service will remain not\nfocused on the clients, and public expenditure on the services essential to poverty alleviation\nwill be constrained. The direct negative effect will be reinforced by the indirect negative effects\nof continued poor governance and inefficient public administration on economic growth.\n2. With the PSP and a Program Loan\n21. With the PSP, actions contained in the PSP program framework (Appendix 1) and policy\nmatrix (Appendix 3) will be fully implemented and the $70 million program loan will be fully\ndisbursed in the fiscal years 2001 and 2002.  Public service delivery in general will improve, and\nspecifically in rural areas in health, education, agriculture, and transport infrastructure. The loan\nwill ease a severe budget constraint, permitting higher public expenditure on these key poverty-\nreducing services.\nTable A4.3: Poverty Impact Assessment Matrix\nScenario 1: Without the PSP Scenario 2: With the PSP\nChannel Type of Effect\nDirect Indirect/Macro Nonpoor Direct Indirect/Macro Nonpoor\nLabor Market NA N N NA P P\nPrices NA Indeterminate NA NA Indeterminate NA\nAccess for Poor (non- N- major NA N P- major NA P\nmarketed public\nservices)\nTransfers N NA NA P NA NA\nTotal Net Effect Adverse: Positive:\nAnti-Poor Pro-Poor\nReduced Improved\naccess to access to\npublic services public services\nNotes: N=negative, NA=not applicable or no effect, P=positive.\nSource: ADB.

A skilled, motivated, and efficient public service with a professional ethos and a focus on\nservice delivery is a necessary condition for good governance. It is also necessary for the\nefficient  and  effective  production  of  public  goods  and  services  and  the  formulation  and\nimplementation of economic and social policy.9 PSP is a crucial element in the move toward\nsuch a public service. Section one of the policy matrix presents the policy actions aimed at\n                                                          \n9  Schiavo-Campo, Salvatore, Giulio de Tommaso, and Amitabha Mukherjee. 1997.

Within the context of a medium-\nterm public sector reform plan, these actions focus on establishing strong linkages between\nbudget  appropriations  and  organizational  performance,  particularly  in  the  major  service\ndepartments  of  health,  education,  and  transport  and  works.  Performance  monitoring  and\nevaluation and reporting systems for staff and departments are integral components of the\nreform program. Departmental performance plans and reports are to be publicly available, and a\ncode of ethics and business conduct for the public service is to be enforced.\n23.  Section two of the policy matrix presents the policy actions that will be taken to ensure\nthat personnel management systems and processes are aligned with the requirements of a\nperformance-oriented  public  service.  These  actions  center  on  capacity  building  in  the\nDepartment of Personnel Management and the Public Service Commission, and the integration\nof human resource management and payroll systems.\n24. Section three of the policy matrix presents the policy actions aimed at promoting good\ngovernance in the public sector. These include strengthening the Auditor General\u2019s Office and\nthe Ombudsman Commission, and auditing of key service departments.\n25. Section four of the policy matrix details the policy actions that will improve the delivery of\nmajor public services, especially in rural areas. In the context of a functional and expenditure\nreview  of  central  agencies  and  key  national  line  departments,  the  Central  Agencies\nCoordination Committee (CACC) will require a quantified results-oriented budget submission\nfrom all government departments and agencies, starting in 2002. CACC has established a\nService Improvement Support Group at the national level, and provincial service improvement\ncoordinators  have  been  appointed  in  Milne  Bay,  Morobe,  West  New  Britain,  and  Western\nHighlands  provinces.  Service  improvement  plans  will  be  formulated  for  the  four  national\ndepartments of health, education, agriculture and livestock, and works and transport; and they\nwill be implemented in these four provinces as the first step in improving public service delivery\nnationwide.  CACC  will  approve  and  disseminate  service  charters  specifying  performance\nstandards that clients can expect; and will demand reports on actual performance in provincial\nservice delivery. These reports must include results from client satisfaction surveys.\n26. Implementation of the PSP and the funding support provided by the program loan will\nensure improved public service delivery. In particular, there will be greater access to key public\nservices by the poor in four provinces as a result of higher and more focused public spending.\nHence, in the PIA matrix, the major positive impact of the PSP on the poor will be increased\naccess to basic public services.\n27. In addition to the major positive impact, some indirect positive effects will occur through\nthe labor market. With public service and governance reforms, private sector will be able to\nincrease its activities. This in turn will increase the chances of accelerated economic growth and\nconsequent  employment  creation.  Public  spending  will  be  higher  than  without  the  PSP,\nincreasing demand for labor indirectly. The increased demand is likely to benefit those in formal\nemployment primarily, but also may generate employment for those in the informal sector.\n28.  The loan will support the Government's efforts to maintain a stable macroeconomic\nenvironment  while  implementing  the  Structural  Reform  Program.  It  will  cover  short-  and\nmedium-term adjustment costs during 2001-2003. It will augment foreign reserves and thus\nalleviate speculative pressure on the currency that could lead to depreciation and thus higher\nprices. However, the easing of the constraint on public expenditure will increase aggregate", "56 Appendix 4, page 8\ndemand, which by itself will increase the general price level. The net effect cannot be predicted,\nbut is unlikely to be significant in terms of its impact on poverty.\n29.  In regard to relative price movements, the provision of a program loan may increase the\nlikelihood of a nominal appreciation of the currency. To the extent that such an appreciation is\nreal, there may be a negative effect on the poor insofar as they are net producers of traded\ngoods and net consumers of nontraded goods. Against this, the loan will help provide publicly-\nsupplied services at zero or nominal charges, thus benefiting the poor. The net effect of relative\nprice shifts is difficult to predict, but will be substantially overshadowed by the positive impact of\nthe availability of public goods and services under with the PSP.\n30.  The impact on transfers through direct government programs is largely covered by the\nPIA  matrix  category  of  access  of  the  poor  to  nonmarketed  public  goods  and  services.  In\naddition,  however,  under  with  the  PSP,  the  Government  will  have  a  greater  capacity  to\nformulate and implement public works programs in which the poor are given work.\n31. In summary, with the PSP will have a significant positive impact on the poor because of\na direct positive effect on the provision of basic public services. The public services will become\nclient oriented and performance oriented, and public expenditure on the services essential to\npoverty alleviation will increase. The direct positive effect will be reinforced by the indirect\npositive effects of a better governance environment and improved public administration on\neconomic growth.\nD. Monitoring PSP Implementation and Evaluating Outcomes\n32. The CACC will retain the responsibility for overall coordination of the PSP, while the\nPublic Sector Reform Management Unit established by the National Executive Council will be\nresponsible for coordination on a daily basis. General monitoring of PSP implementation will be\nundertaken by ADB in partnership with the Government on a regular basis. For assessing the\nPSP\u2019s impact on poverty, key performance indicators will be the share of public expenditure\nallocated to basic service provision in rural areas, and the extent of client satisfaction with\nprovincial service delivery as revealed in surveys. Results of the latter are to be documented in\nthe reports of line ministries to CACC. Ultimately, progress in reducing poverty will have to be\nevaluated through regular poverty analyses based on comparable household survey data.", "57 Appendix 5\nINELIGIBLE ITEMS\n1.
