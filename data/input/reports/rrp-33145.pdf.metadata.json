The Government\nhas  formulated  and  has  begun  implementing  a  wide-ranging\nstructural  reform  program  (SRP),  embracing  public  service  and\neconomic reforms.\n\nThe quality of public sector management in PNG has deteriorated\nover  the  past  decade.  As  is  strongly  emphasized  by  the\nGovernment,  poor  governance  is  the  root  cause.  The  public\nsector\u2019s  capacity  for  designing  and  implementing  sound  policies\nand to manage its responsibilities has been eroded.\n\nA  broad  consensus  has  arisen  that  the  situation  must  be\nreversed.  The  Government  has  committed  itself  to  a  program  of\nreform  to  restore  the  integrity  of  the  public  service.  Beginning  in\n2000,  the  Government  has  drawn  up  a  comprehensive  plan  of\naction for public sector reform, and implementation is under way.\n\nImproving performance in the public sector is a main pillar in the\nGovernment\u2019s  SRP,  alongside  concurrent  measures  to  sustain\nmacroeconomic  stability  and  remove  barriers  to  private  sector\ndevelopment. For the SRP to succeed, it will be important for the\nGovernment  to  demonstrate  improvements  in  services  to  the\ngeneral  public,  particularly  front-line  services  to  urban  and  rural\npoor  communities.  The  actions  under  the  PSP  are  essential  for\nachieving the needed reorientation of the public service.\n\nThe PSP will support, as part of the broader reform agenda of the\nGovernment,  policy  reform  measures  in  four  areas:  (i) building  a\nperformance-oriented  public  service,  (ii)  reorienting  personnel\nmanagement  systems  and  processes,  (iii)  strengthening  probity\nand  oversight  agencies,  and  (iv)  improving  delivery  of  major\nimproved  human  resource\nservices.  The  PSP \nmanagement;  civil  service  administration;  policy  changes  across\nthe  public  sector;  general  management  systems  at  government\nlevel;  strengthening  of  the  probity  and  oversight  agencies;  and\nimprovement of service delivery, particularly for basic services, at\nthe national and provincial levels.\n\nfocuses  on \n\nObjective and\nScope\n\nClassification\n\nThematic:\n\nGood governance\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nCategory  C.  The  environmental  implications  of  the  PSP  are\nminimal.\n\n\fADB Assistance\n\nProgram Loan\nLoan Amount and\nTerms\n\nProgram Period\nand Tranching\n\nA  loan  of  $70  million  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  the\nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s\nLIBOR-based  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,\nincluding a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate determined in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nfacility,  a\ncommitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, a front-end fee of\n1.0  percent,  conversion  options  that  may  be  exercised  in\naccordance with the terms of the draft Loan Agreement, the Loan\nRegulations,  ADB\u2019s  Conversion  Guidelines,  and  other  terms  and\nconditions set out in the draft Loan Agreement.\n\nlending \n\nThe PSP period will be from December 2001 to December 2003.\nThe  loan  will  be  released  in  two  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of\n$35 million,  including  provision  for  capitalizing  the  loan  front-end\nfee  and  for  cost  recovery  of  project  preparatory  technical\nassistance,  will  be  made  available  upon  loan  effectiveness.  The\nsecond  tranche  of  $35  million  is  expected  to  be  released  by\nSeptember  2002,  but  may  be  released  earlier,  depending  on\nsatisfactory implementation of the agreed conditions.\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nThe Department of Treasury will be the Executing Agency for the\nloan,  with  the  Department  of  Prime  Minister  and  National\nExecutive Council responsible for implementation.\n\nProcurement\n\nThe proceeds of the loan will be disbursed against a broad range\nof imports. The proceeds of the loan will only be used to finance\nitems  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  except\nineligible  items  specified  in  the  negative  list.  Procurement  under\nthe  loan  will  follow  normal  commercial  practice  by  the  private\nsector,  or  standard  Government  procedures  for  procurement  by\nthe  public  sector,  except  that  goods  commonly  traded  on  the\ninternational  commodity  market  will  be  procured  in  accordance\nwith procedure appropriate to the trade.\n\nthe \n\nCounterpart funds to be generated from the proceeds of the loan\nwill be used to support the Government\u2019s SRP. An indicative use\nincluding  direct  structural\nof \nadjustment  costs  such  as  retrenchments  and  beginning  to\nimplement  service  improvement  plans,  as  well  as  reducing\nexpensive public debt.\n\nfunds  has  been  agreed, \n\nThree  major  risks  have  been  identified:  (i)  inadequate  political\ncommitment, (ii) resource constraints affecting  sustainability,  and\n(iii)  capacity  constraints  affecting  implementation  of  the  reforms.\nWhile  these  will  remain  risks,  the  PSP  proposes  mitigating\nmeasures  to  manage  the  risks  and  minimize  the  impact  on  the\ncountry\u2019s reform initiatives.\n\nCounterpart Funds\n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\n\fi\n\nv\n\n\f1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\nloan  to  the  Independent  State  of  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  for  the  Public  Service  Program\n(PSP).\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFrom the beginning of 1998, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been in dialogue\n2.\nwith  the  PNG  Government  concerning  its  request  for  assistance  to  improve  public  sector\nperformance in PNG. However, the developing macroeconomic crisis slowed progress. In July\n1999,  a  new  government  came  to  power,  providing  an  opportunity  for  ADB  and  the  other\ndevelopment agencies involved in PNG to assist the Government to reform the economy and to\nreorient  the  public  sector.  In  1999,  the  Government  formulated  its  structural  reform  program\n(SRP).  At  the  November  1999  Consultative  Group  Meeting,  the  Government  reiterated  its\nintention to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, as\nwell as from ADB and other agencies. The Government finalized agreements with IMF in April\n2000 and with the World Bank in June 2000; these agreements led to ancillary agreements for\nassistance with, notably, Australia, the European Union, and Japan. The IMF and World Bank\nprograms  are  targeted  at  addressing  fiscal  and  balance-of-payments  issues,  financial  sector\nreform,  and  privatization  of  state-owned  enterprises.  The  Government  requested  ADB\nassistance for public sector reform. A technical assistance (TA) was approved in October 1999\nfor preparing a governance and public sector reform program.1 The budgets for 2000 and 2001,\nprepared with IMF and World Bank assistance, identified funding gaps for structural adjustment\nexpenditures.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  financing  through  a  policy-based  program\nloan for the PSP, as a part of its overall SRP.\n\n3.\nA fact-finding mission was fielded during 13 February-1 March 2001, a follow-up mission\nduring 16-28 July 2001, and an appraisal mission during 3-22 September 2001.2 This report is\nbased  on  the  findings  of  the  missions  and  consultations  with  key  officials  in  Government  and\nrepresentatives of aid agencies. The program framework is in Appendix 1. The national policy\nagenda  and  reform  priorities  of  the  Government  are  summarized  in  the  development  policy\nletter from the Prime Minister (Appendix 2), which includes the policy matrix for the ADB loan,\ngiven in Appendix 3.\n\nIII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Objectives, Strategy, and Plans\n\n4.\nThe primary development challenge in PNG is poverty alleviation. Most of the people of\nPNG  are  poor  by  regional  and  international  standards.  The  human  development  index  (HDI)\nscore  for  1998  of  0.542  placed  PNG  in  133rd  position  on  a  list  of  174  developing  countries.\nAmong  Pacific  island  countries,  PNG  was  last  on  the  HDI  scale.  In  1996,  31  percent  of  the\npopulation lived below the international poverty line of $1 per capita per day; 37 percent were\nbelow the country-specific poverty line in that same year. Around 17 percent of the population\ncould not meet the basic requirement of 2,200 calories per day per adult equivalent, even if they\n\n                  \n\n1  TA  3280-PNG:  Governance  and  Public  Sector  Reform,  for  $600,000,  approved  on  16  October  1999;\nsupplementary  financing  of  about  $381,000  was  provided  from  the  Australian  Agency  for  International\nDevelopment (AusAID), approved on 26 October 2000.\n\n2 The appraisal mission comprised S. van der Tak, Mission Leader; R. Siy, Manager; and O. Tiwana, Counsel.\n\n\f2\n\nspent  all  their  income  on  food.  These  statistics  place  PNG  among  the  poorer  countries  in  the\nworld.\n\n5.\nIncome distribution is also a concern. The richest 10 percent of the population account\nfor  36  percent  of  consumption,  while  the  poorest  50  percent  account  for  only  20  percent.\nGrowth, led by a capital-intensive minerals sector, has supported increasing consumption by an\nurban  elite.  Accordingly,  the  vast  majority  of  the  poor  (93.5  percent)  live  in  rural  areas.  The\nurbanized National Capital District has a poverty rate of 25.8 percent, and accounts for just 3.8\npercent of the poor.\n\n6.\nPoverty  also  has  a  gender  dimension.  Across  nearly  all  indicators,  women  fare  worse\nthan men. Indeed, PNG is one of the few countries in the world where women have a lower life\nexpectancy than men. Women are responsible for a disproportionately large amount of work in\nthe rural sector, but are generally under represented in senior positions in the public and private\nsectors.\n\nHowever, the data point to promising approaches for alleviating poverty. In about three-\n7.\nquarters of poor households, there has been little, if any, human capital investment. Almost 52\npercent  of  the  poor  live  in  households  whose  head  never  attended  school.  Likewise,  girls'\nenrollment  rates  are  significantly  influenced  by  the  educational  level  of  adult  females  in  the\nhousehold. The incidence of poverty is also linked to the ability to earn cash to pay for nonfood\nitems  (such  as  school  fees)  and  to  permit  savings  for  times  of  economic  difficulty.  Where\nhousehold  heads  earn  cash  income  from  wage  employment  or  a  business,  poverty  rates  are\nmuch  lower.  Poverty  alleviation  therefore  requires  improved  access  to  services,  such  as\ntransport, education, and health, particularly in rural areas.\n\n8.\nIn  PNG,  the  formal  safety  net  is  provided  by  provident  funds;  these  systems  are\ntherefore  limited  to  wage  earners.  Provident  funds  in  PNG  have  performed  poorly  and  are\ncurrently  the  focus  of  reform  efforts.  Informal  social  safety  nets  (the wantok systems)  provide\nincome transfers, labor exchange, and sharing of gardening and child care to those within the\nsame clan or tribe. However, these systems are less effective in communities with high poverty\nrates, where people therefore have less of a surplus to share with others.\n\n9.\nIn recent years, PNG's ability to address rising poverty has been constrained mainly by\neconomic  policy  shortcomings  and  political  instability.  The  current  Government  has  moved\ndecisively to address these fundamental constraints.\n\n10.\nOn  the  political  side,  the  Government  is  taking  measures  to  improve  stability.  In  late\n2000, the Parliament passed a bill to strengthen the role of political parties, and to reduce the\npotential for switching,  thus reducing the political horsetrading that has long been a feature  of\nPNG. Government has also endorsed a fundamental change in the electoral system, from the\npresent  first-past-the-post  system  to  a  system  of  limited  preferential  voting,  which  will  help\nensure that members of parliament have a wider constituency.\n\nThe Government recognizes that the root cause of PNG\u2019s weak economic performance\n11.\nis  poor  governance,  characterized  by  a  decline  in  public  institutions\u2019  performance,  poor\ntransparency  of  policy  making,  and  political  interference  in  policy  implementation.  These\nweaknesses are being addressed through a wide-ranging SRP.\n\n12.\nThe Government\u2019s first priority has been to minimize fiscal deficits in order to reduce the\nrate of increase of indebtedness and to help restore stability and integrity to the economy and\n\n\f3\n\nbanking system by delivering a reasonably balanced budget. The Government\u2019s commitment to\nthe SRP is evident from the strict fiscal constraints it has adopted. The 2000 and 2001 budgets\nhave  essentially  been  balanced,  apart  from  repayment  of  arrears  and  a  modest  provision  for\nstructural  reforms.  Within  the  constrained  overall  expenditure  ceiling,  the  Government  has\nprioritized  expenditure  on  health,  education,  peace  and  order,  agriculture,  and  infrastructure\nmaintenance\u2014no  other  sectors  have  received  increased  allocations.  No  new  external\ncommercial  borrowing  is  envisaged.  Central  bank  financing  of  the  budget  also  has  been\neliminated.  Under  a  new  central  banking  act  (March  2000),  the  central  bank\u2019s  role  was\nredefined, ensuring its independence and limiting its financing of government activities to short-\nterm liquidity management. The resulting imposition of harder fiscal discipline constitutes what\nwill be a long lasting improvement in governance.\n\nPNG has had a substantial overhang of short-term domestic debt, with the resulting high\n13.\ndebt service constraining public spending on public services. The Government has been retiring\nthis domestic debt as quickly as possible, in part by improving its management of net assets. As\na  central  plank  of  its  program,  the  Government  also  has  been  converting  domestic  short-term\ndebt  into  long-term  concessional  foreign  debt,  thereby  freeing  up  budget  resources  and\nreducing the pressure on domestic credit to the private sector. The Government has also been\nconducting  a  successful  program  of  clearing  up  arrears,  and  ensuring  that  new  arrears  are\navoided  (the  temporary  cash  flow  difficulties  in  2001  have  resulted  in  some  build-up  again  of\narrears).\n\n14.\nTo  conclude,  the  framework  for  the  programs,  including  the  fiscal  sector  management\ninitiative, must be viewed against the Government's comprehensive SRP (para. 2), which aims\nto (i) promote good governance; (ii) sustain macroeconomic stability; (iii) improve public sector\nperformance in the core areas through privatization, reduce the involvement of the public sector\nwhere  its  performance  has  been  poor  and  where  the  private  sector  can  improve  service\ndelivery; and (iv) remove barriers to investment and economic development.\n\nB. \n\nRecent Economic Performance and Prospects\n\n15.\nIn  1995,  following  a  balance-of-payments  crisis,  the  Government  embarked  on  a\ncomprehensive structural adjustment program. Until mid-1997, the tightening of macroeconomic\npolicies  achieved  some  success  in  bringing  down  inflation,  rebuilding  foreign  exchange\nreserves, and fostering a recovery of output. However, there was little success in achieving the\nbroad structural reform agenda. Beginning in late 1997, the economy was battered by a series\nof adverse exogenous shocks, including a prolonged drought that affected mining output as well\nas agricultural production, and the regional financial crisis, which caused steep declines in the\nprices of, and demand for, PNG\u2019s principal export commodities. The macroeconomic effects of\nthese  shocks  were  exacerbated  by  weak  monetary  policy  and  deteriorating  budget\nmanagement.  The  deterioration  of  governance,  marked  by  increasing  political  interference  in\nimplementation of public policy, further undermined private sector confidence. The situation was\ncompounded by a breakdown in relations with the external development partners.\n\nA broader legacy of the performance through the 1990s is a stagnating standard of living\n16.\nand  social  indicators  for  the  population.  Based  on  1996  poverty  data,  over  37  percent  of  the\npopulation  falls  below  the  poverty  line.  The  situation  of  the  poorest  quartile  has  not  improved\nsince  1984,  and  developments  since  1996  have  worsened  the  disparities.  Low  educational\nachievements, inadequate delivery of basic services, especially in rural areas, and inadequate\ninfrastructure and institutional support exacerbate the situation. The results of the 2000 census\n\n\f4\n\nindicate that the population has been growing more rapidly than expected, with the likely result\nthat per capita incomes have been overestimated.\n\n17.\nA new government took office in July 1999 with a mandate to stabilize macroeconomic\nconditions, improve the governance of public institutions, and restore relations with international\nfinancial institutions and bilateral partners. The Government launched a reform program aimed\nat stabilizing the economy and creating the conditions for growth led by the private sector. The\nGovernment  took  measures  to  rein  in  the  growing  fiscal  deficit  and  tightened  monetary  policy\nduring  the  second  half  of  1999.  The  Government  adopted  an  adjustment  program  focused  on\nsound fiscal management and reforms to improve the governance, transparency, and efficiency\nof the public sector. The Government was successful in reestablishing dialogue and agreement\nwith the international community, with immediate results. Aided by an $80 million bridging loan\nfrom  the  Australian  government  and  the  release  of  a  $25  million  program  loan  tranche  from\nADB,3  together  with  a  turnaround  of  some  commodity  prices,  the  central  bank  was  able  to\nrecoup  a  significant  amount  of  reserves  by  early  2000.  The  Government  also  reached\nagreements on support from IMF in March 2000 and with the World Bank in June 2000, together\nwith linked financial packages from Australia, Japan, and other sources.4\n\n18.\nReal  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  declined  by  1.8  percent  in  2000,  although  the\nexternal  current  account  surplus  widened  and  inflation  declined.  Mineral  production  was\ndepressed  by  the  start  of  a  secular  decline  in  oil  production  due  to  depletion  of  oil  reserves.\nNonmineral  output  contracted,  in  part  due  to  fiscal  restraint  and  tight  credit  conditions.  The\noverall  Government  deficit  was  reduced  substantially  to  1.3  percent  of  GDP  (below  targets),\nlargely  because  of  improved  mineral  tax  revenue.  However,  there  were  delays  in  fulfilling  IMF\nand World Bank target conditions. A shortfall in external financing led the Government to resort\nto domestic financing. Nevertheless, for the year as a whole, net domestic financing declined as\na share of GDP. Although the kina depreciated by 13.7 percent against the United States dollar\nby year end, the rate of inflation declined to 10 percent by year end (compared to the target of 5\npercent).\n\n19.\nEconomic  conditions  continued  to  be  difficult  in  the  first  half  of  2001.  The  economy\nremains stagnant, with oil output and nonmineral activity declining. Uncertainties in the relations\nwith  multilateral  institutions  in  the  early  part  of  the  year,  and  unrest  in  the  military  in  March,\ncontributed to pressures on the kina. Market interest rates remained high. Delays in the receipt\nof external financing led to fiscal pressures and a temporary breach of the limit on central bank\nlending  to  the  Government.  The  pressures  eased  somewhat  as  the  authorities  secured  early\nrelease  of  the  second  tranche  of  a  budgetary  support  loan  from  Australia  (tied  to  satisfactory\nassessment  of  progress  by  IMF)  and  the  release  of  a  World  Bank  loan  tranche  in  July  2001.\nNevertheless the situation remains tight.\n\n                  \n\n1997.\n\n3  Loan  1516-PNG/1517-PNG[SF]:  Health Sector Development Program,  for  $50  million,  approved  on  20  March\n\n4  A 14-month IMF stand-by Arrangement (SBA) of SDR85.5 million was approved by the IMF Executive Board on 29\nMarch 2000; this program has just been successfully completed, with all four reviews being approved by the IMF\nBoard (the first time that an IMF program has been completed in PNG and a fairly rare achievement). The World\nBank approved a structural adjustment loan (SAL) on 13 June 2000 in the amount of $90 million. The initial tranche\n($35 million) and the floating tranche ($20 million) have been released, based on satisfactory compliance thus far;\nthe release of the final tranche of $35 million will be contingent on several key policy actions, including amendment\nof forestry legislation, completion of audits of major state enterprises, and reforms in the National Provident Fund.\nAmong the other major contributions, the Government of Australia provided a loan of $110 million, the Government\nof Japan a $50 million loan, and the European Union a grant of E10.4 million.\n\n\f5\n\nA. \n\nBackground, Constraints, and Issues\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PUBLIC SECTOR\n\ninstability  compounds \n\nPolitical  and  public  service  governance  shortcomings  in  PNG  worsen  inherent\n20.\ndevelopment  problems,  and  political \ninadequate  development\nmanagement. Corruption, political patronage, and weak public administration have undermined\nthe professional ethos of the public service. These factors are major constraints to the efforts to\nalleviate poverty in PNG. The extent of poverty is a direct consequence of sustained low levels\nof  investment  and  poor  quality  of  services  in  rural  areas,  particularly  in  such  key  sectors  as\nagriculture, education, and health. Public services have deteriorated steadily over the past two\ndecades  and  have  reached  unacceptably  low  levels.  In  a  1996  survey,  the  PNG  population\nexpressed  its  collective  dissatisfaction.  The  poorest  quartile  of  the  population  was  the  most\ndissatisfied  with  the  state  of  government  services.  Lowest  performance  ratings  were  given  to\nservices in the Highlands and Momase/North Coast Regions where the majority of the poor live.\n\n21.\nThe Government acknowledges the validity of this public perception. Key policy makers\naccept that the core functions of the public sector have not been fulfilled efficiently or effectively\nand  that  this  failure  of  past  governments  has  adversely  affected  the  poor  most  of  all.  This\nrecognition has led the Government to feature good governance and public service performance\nimprovement as key objectives of its reform program. Clearly, efforts at sound macroeconomic\nmanagement and structural adjustment have little meaning unless they enhance public services\nand  result  in  higher  living  standards  for  the  population.  The  following  sections  describes  the\nfeatures  of  the  Government's  SRP  and  the  major  policy  actions  that  have  been  planned  or\ncompleted under the SRP.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Expenditure and Economic Management\n\n22.\nThe Government has transformed economic management. The exchange rate, interest\nrates,  and  liquidity  management  are  now  market  based.  The  Government  has  devoted\nconsiderable  attention  to  strengthening  fiscal  management,  improving  transparency,  and\nreestablishing  proper  procedures.  Government  departments  are  reporting  all  spending\ncommitments, with development budget warrants integrated with the recurrent budget warrants.\nMonthly cash flow reports are produced. Expenditure controls have been enhanced and the use\nof  trust  accounts  essentially  stopped.  Substantial  arrears  incurred  by  previous  governments\nhave been cleared during 1999 and 2000.\n\n23.\nThe Government is fully committed to strengthening the policy framework of government\nexpenditure.  The  Government  has  explicitly  based  its  national  budgets  on  its  development\nobjectives,  with  the  development  policy  framework  central  in  budget  formulation.  More\nfundamentally,  the  Government  is  moving  toward  a  multi-year  approach  to  expenditure\nplanning. As part of the process, the tools of financial management are being strengthened, with\nexternal assistance, including from ADB.5\n\n24.\nIn 1999, the Government started a review of the tax system to strengthen the fiscal base\n(with  ADB  TA  for  mining  and  hydrocarbons  taxes6).  The  recommendations  were  introduced  in\nthe  2001  budget.  The  purpose  was  to  ensure  that  PNG\u2019s  personal  and  corporate  taxes  were\ncompetitive, with a view to encouraging investment.\n\n                  \n\n5 Loan 1703-PNG: Financial Management, for $25.8 million, approved on 21 October 1999.\n6 TA 3444-PNG: Review of Mining and Hydrocarbon Tax Regimes, for $325,000, approved on 19 May 2000.\n\n\f6\n\n25.\nThe  Government  has  taken  steps  to  improve  the  management  of  its  debt,  in  particular\ndomestic  debt,  which  had  ballooned  to  unsustainable  levels.  The  responsibility  for  domestic\ndebt management has been transferred from the central bank to the Department of Finance and\nthe Department of Treasury, and the practice of paying an administratively determined interest\nrate on the central bank\u2019s holdings of public debt has been eliminated, increasing sensitivity to\nmarket  conditions.  Cash  balances  are  being  reduced.  The  Mineral  Resources  Stabilization\nFund,  originally  intended  to  smooth  the  use  of  mineral  revenues,  has  been  abolished  and  the\nfunds used to reduce domestic debt.\n\n26.\nIn  the  area  of  monetary  policy,  the  new  central  banking  legislation  has  established  full\nindependence  of  the  central  bank.  Financial  sector  reform  has  been  wide  ranging,  with  new\nlegislation  focused  on  the  need  for  enhanced  regulation  and  supervision  of  banks  and  other\nfinancial  institutions.  The  life  insurance  and  superannuation  industries  are  now  under  the\nsupervision of the central bank. Special audits of the National Provident Fund and, to a lesser\nextent,  of  the  Public  Officers  Superannuation  Fund,  revealed  difficulties.  The  Government  has\ntaken  timely  action  to  address  the  National  Provident  Fund  problems,  including  instituting  an\nindependent  commission  of  inquiry,  and  addressing  cash  flow  problems.  With  World  Bank\nassistance, a plan of action has been drawn up, including suitable recapitalization.\n\nAnother  objective  of  the  Government\u2019s  SRP  is  to  remove  barriers  to  investment  and\n27.\ndevelopment.  In  this  regard,  as  a  main  pillar  of  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  to  improve  the\nefficiency of the public sector, the Government has embarked on a program of privatization. The\nobjective is to improve service delivery and efficiency, allowing the Government to concentrate\non  its  core  responsibilities  and  reduce  its  debt.  A  privatization  commission  has  been\nestablished. The institutional, legal, and regulatory frameworks are being strengthened. Special\nteams  are  working  on  the  legal  review  and  due  diligence  work.  Assistance  in  the  design  and\nimplementation of the privatization strategy is being provided primarily by the World Bank and\nan international advisory group. Additional financing is required for the continuing preparations.\nAlthough  there  were  some  initial  delays,  implementation  of  the  privatization  strategy  is\nprogressing.\n\nTo liberalize and promote trade, the Government has been implementing a seven-year\n28.\ntariff  reform  program,  with  most  tariffs  having  been  replaced  by  a  value-added  tax.  The\ninvestment policy is being reviewed with a view to simplifying the regulatory structure. A review\nof competition policy is under way, with a view to reducing restrictions. Financing is required for\nits ongoing operations. A notable focus has been to improve fisheries management, with ADB\nassistance.7\n\nC. \n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy\n\n29.\nThe  Government  is  introducing  measures  to  strengthen  governance  and  public  sector\nmanagement.  Under  difficult  circumstances,  it  has  (i)  contained  the  fiscal  deficit  and  reversed\nthe  decline  in  macroeconomic  indicators,  (ii)  reestablished  national  and  local  planning\nprocesses,  (iii)  strengthened  public  procurement  processes,  (iv)  made  progress  in  privatizing\nstate-owned enterprises, and (v) introduced wide-ranging reforms in key sectors. However, the\ntransformation of the public service is a complex and long-term task. The PSP is only the initial\nstage in an effort that will likely require a decade or more of sustained government attention and\nexternal assistance.\n\n7 TA3604-PNG: Coastal Fisheries Management and Development, for $340,000, approved on 20 December 2000.\n\n                  \n\n\f7\n\nIn broad terms, the PSP seeks to set in place some of the initial conditions to facilitate,\n30.\nmotivate,  and  induce  a  gradual  transformation  of  culture,  systems,  and  management  in  the\npublic  service.  Part  of  that  change  process  has  started,  with  clear  statements  of  vision  and\ngoals from senior officials in the Government. The PSP seeks to take this initiative a step further\nby  introducing  a  number  of  policy  and  institutional  measures  in  key  agencies.  Initial  and\nindicative indicators and performance targets have been developed for the longer term (see the\nprogram  framework,  Appendix  1).  However,  a  precise  and  specific  plan  of  actions  and\nresources  required  for  the  longer  term  is  desirable,  and  the  lessons  regarding  ownership  and\nthe need to evolve a fit with local culture and capacities must be reflected. Such a plan cannot\nbe a rigid blueprint; it has to be shaped by an iterative process of introducing change, evaluating\noutcomes,  and  planning  next  steps.  Accordingly,  while  the  broad  objectives  can  be  set  for  an\ninstitutional change process, it is difficult to detail the actions and reforms needed, beyond about\nthe  next  1-2  year  period.  The  process  requires  careful  monitoring,  constant  assessments  of\nimplementation capacities and responses to recent interventions, and regular consultations with\nkey people regarding the way forward. For this reason, the PSP covers only an implementation\nperiod of about 2 years, with limited specificity of further milestones in the reform program. The\nPSP and the medium-term framework encompass four broad dimensions for introducing change\nin the public service.\n\n31.\nThe first dimension involves measures to strengthen the performance orientation of the\npublic service. As an initial step, departments are required to define their outputs and to prepare\ncorporate plans and budgets with these objectives and outputs in mind. Public access to these\nperformance  targets  is  expected  to  enhance  transparency  and  accountability.  The  efforts  to\ndefine departmental outputs and report on accomplishments may, in the early stages, be off the\nmark  or  less  than  satisfactory.  However,  the  exercise  is  expected  to  raise  awareness  of  the\nobligation  of  the  public  service  to  deliver  results.  At  later  stages,  attention  will  need  to  shift  to\nestablishing  cost-effective  measures  for  monitoring  and  measuring  performance,  and  to\nproviding  appropriate  incentives,  through  the  budget  process,  to  reward  higher  performing\ndepartments.  While  the  focus  will  be  on  national-level  departments  initially,  the  process  will\nneed eventually to cover provincial governments as well.\n\n32.\nThe  second  dimension  involves  policy  actions  to  reorient  personnel  management\nsystems and to ensure that such systems and processes are fair, transparent, merit based, and\ninsulated  from  arbitrary  action  of  politicians.  Personnel  management  processes  are  being\nreviewed and revised. A key step is the integration of human resource management and payroll\nsystems to ensure accurate information, permit national human resource planning, and reduce\nwaste (by eliminating overpayments of salaries and benefits); the payroll and human resource\nmanagement  system  will  be  fully  consistent  with  the  financial  management  systems  being\nconcurrently developed. Further enhancements, beyond the PSP, will include capacity building\nat  all  levels of the public  service to enable smooth implementation of processes for personnel\nmanagement, particularly at provincial and local government levels.\n\n33.\nThe third dimension covers governance institutions closely related to the public service.\nThe  Ombudsman  Commission  and  the  Auditor  General's  Office,  under  the  PSP,  will  be\nstrengthened to enable them to perform their mandates. The steps beyond the PSP will depend\non  the  outcome  of  the  review  of  central  agencies  and  the  parallel  exercise  to  clarify  and\nstrengthen  the  functions  and  relationships  of  other  key  central  agencies,  including  the\ndepartments  of  national  planning  and  monitoring,  justice  and  attorney  general,  and  provincial\nand local level government.\n\n\f8\n\nThe  fourth  dimension  involves  sector-specific  activities  to  improve  frontline  service\n34.\ndelivery. The PSP will cover pilot efforts in four provinces involving four basic services (health,\neducation, agriculture, transport infrastructure). The activities beyond the PSP are expected to\nprovide for replication in other provinces.\n\nD. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n35.\nFrom  1998,  ADB  has  been  in  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  regarding  possible\nmeasures to improve public sector performance. However, the emerging macroeconomic crisis\nat  that  time  prevented  any  meaningful  progress.  The  opportunity  to  provide  substantial\nassistance on public service issues emerged when the new Government came to power in July\n1999. Following a request from the Government to support its structural reform intentions, ADB\nprovided a TA grant in October 1999 on governance and public sector reform. Since then, ADB\nhas  been  in  close  consultation  with  key  multilateral  (primarily  IMF  and  the  World  Bank)  and\nbilateral  funding  agencies  on  reform-related  issues  in  order  to  ensure  complementarity  of\nassistance and to avoid duplication or conflict in policy advice. IMF and World Bank assistance\nprograms  continue  to  be  targeted  at  fiscal  and  balance-of-payments  issues,  financial  sector\nreform, and privatization of state-owned enterprises. In line with the Government\u2019s request, ADB\nhas  focused  on  reform  of  the  public  service.  Australia,  the  European  Union,  and  Japan  have\nancillary  assistance  programs  linked  to  progress  on  the  IMF  and  World  Bank  programs.\nAccordingly,  ADB\u2019s  program  is  well-focused  and  complements  the  assistance  on  structural\nreform provided from other sources.\n\nE. \n\nADB's Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n\n36.\nADB\u2019s  strategy  for  PNG,  prepared  in  1998,  focuses  on  reducing  poverty  by  improving\ngovernance,  developing  the  private  sector,  and  improving  social  indicators.  The  strategy\nsupports a mix of longer term systemic change and direct poverty interventions.\n\n37.\nPoor  governance  and  weak  public  sector  management  have  been  the  country\u2019s  main\ndevelopment  problems.  For  this  reason,  all  ADB  project  loans,  whether  they  cover  national  or\nsectoral issues, include support for strengthening governance and administration. The support\ninvolves  measures  to  enhance  public  sector  financial  management,  to  build  capacities  of  line\nagencies and provincial governments that provide essential services, and to strengthen central\nagencies and governance institutions.\n\nPast ADB assistance in support of public service reforms has drawn the following major\n38.\nconclusions: (i) governments need to have strong ownership of policy reforms, (ii) interventions\nhave  to  take  account  of  local  culture  and  capacities,  (iii)  effective  institutionalization  requires\ncareful  sequencing  or  reforms,  and  (iv)  external  advisers  and  consultants  need  to  be  used\njudiciously to avoid creating dependency. The PSP has been designed with these key principles\nin mind.\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nV. \n\nTHE PROGRAM\n\n39.\nThe quality of public sector management in PNG has deteriorated over the past decade.\nAs  is  strongly  emphasized  by  the  Government,  weak  governance  is  the  root  cause  of  the\nproblem.  The  public  sector\u2019s  capacity  for  designing  and  implementing  sound  policies  and  to\nmanage its responsibilities has been eroded.\n\n\f9\n\nA broad consensus has arisen that the situation must be reversed. The Government has\n40.\ncommitted itself to a program to restore the integrity of the public service. Beginning in 2000, the\nGovernment has drawn up a comprehensive plan of action for public sector strengthening, and\nits  implementation  is  now  under  way.  The  development  policy  letter  given  in  Appendix  2\nprovides the national picture and the broad structural adjustment agenda of the Government.\n\n41.\nImproving  performance  in  the  public  sector  is  a  major  objective  in  the  Government\u2019s\nSRP,  alongside  measures  to  sustain  macroeconomic  stability  and  remove  barriers  to  private\nsector  development.  It  is  important  for  the  Government  to  demonstrate  improvements  in\nservices  to  the  general  public,  particularly  front-line  services  to  urban  and  rural  poor\ncommunities. The actions under the PSP are essential for beginning the needed reorientation of\nthe public service, which will require medium-term effort.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nthe  PSP \n\nThe main objective of the loan is to support the Government\u2019s policy reform agenda and\n42.\nto  ensure  effective\nfinance  short-term  adjustment  costs  associated  with \nimplementation.  The  PSP  will  support,  as  part  of  the  broader  development  agenda  of  the\nGovernment,  policy  reform  measures  in  four  areas:  (i)  building  a  performance-oriented  public\nservice,  (ii)  reorienting  personnel  management  systems  and  processes,  (iii)  strengthening\nprobity  and  oversight  agencies,  and  (iv)  improving  delivery  of  major  services.  Accordingly,  the\nPSP  focuses  on  improved  human  resource  management,  civil  service  administration,  policy\nchanges  across  the  public  sector,  general  management  systems  at  the  whole  of  government\nlevel, strengthening the probity and oversight agencies, and improving service delivery for basic\nservices,  at  the  national  and  provincial  levels.  The  kind  of  reforms  envisaged  will  take  time  to\nachieve, and implementation will continue long after the release of ADB funds.\n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\n43.\nAppendix  1  gives  a  comprehensive  development  of  the  program  framework  and  the\nactions  to  be  supplied  under  the  PSP.  These  are  divided  into  four  components  or  set  of\nactivities as described below.\n\n1.\n\nBuilding a Performance-Oriented Public Service\n\n44.\nIn  past  attempts  to  reform  the  public  service,  political  support  and  central  agency\nleadership and coordination have been missing. However, the current Government has moved\nto  ensure  that  the  appropriate  mechanisms  and  processes  at  the  central  level  are  in  place  to\ncontrol  the  strategic  direction  of  the  reform  program.  Along  these  lines,  the  Government  has\ntransformed  the  policy  making  process.  At  the  level  of  the  National  Executive  Council  (NEC),\nwhich is the cabinet, a streamlined system of committees has been put in place to make sure\nthat  Government  agencies  are  fully  consulted  on  policy  matters  relevant  to  their  mandate,\nemphasizing  the  need  for  proper  coordination  between  the  bureaucratic  and  the  political\ndecision making levels. A thorough review of the functioning of the NEC secretariat resulted in a\nmajor overhaul of cabinet processes. The roles of NEC, the NEC secretariat, central agencies,\nand  line  departments  have  been  clarified.  Procedures  regarding  policy  submissions  and\ndecision making have been strengthened. All decisions taken by NEC are now widely publicized\n(subject to national security considerations), greatly improving transparency.\n\n45.\nTo  improve  coordination,  the  Government  has  established  the  Central  Agencies\nCoordination  Committee  (CACC)  to  oversee  and  coordinate  the  reform  program.  The  CACC\ncomprises the permanent heads of the central agencies: Department of the Prime Minister and\n\n\f10\n\nNational  Executive  Council  (PMNEC),  Department  of  Treasury,  Department  of  Finance,\nDepartment  of  National  Planning  and  Monitoring,  Department  of  Personnel  Management\n(DPM),  and  the  Department  of  Justice  and  Attorney  General.  The  CACC  has  been  meeting\nregularly  to  review  the  reform  program  and  for  general  policy  development  matters.  A\nsecretariat  has  been  formed  to  support  the  activities  of  CACC;  its  capacities  are  being\nstrengthened. \nthe  roles  and\nresponsibilities  of  the  central  agencies,  with  a  view  to  developing  a  new,  more  effective\nconfiguration of central government functions.\n\nthe  Government  has  been  reviewing \n\nIn  related  efforts, \n\n46.\nThe NEC has made a significant policy commitment to build a results-oriented culture in\nthe public service, beginning at the highest levels of Government, and has directed the central\nagencies  to  work  together  to  establish  management  systems  and  procedures  to  ensure  that\nstaff  incentive  systems  are  sensitive  to  performance.  To  help  coordinate  this  task,  the  NEC\nestablished  the  Public  Sector  Reform  Management  Unit  (PSRMU)  to  provide  guidance.  The\nNEC has also approved the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct of the Public Service, and a\nrevised  general  order  on  its  application  will  be  issued  shortly  by  the  Department  of  Personnel\nManagement.\n\n47.\nSeveral key reform actions are planned in the coming year to deliver the message that\nthe Government is determined to achieve significant improvement in results to the public. First,\nPMNEC  will  be  vested  with  the  responsibility  for  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  of\ndepartment heads and departments. That responsibility is currently with DPM, which does not\nhave  the  resources  or  the  political  clout  to  handle  this  task  effectively.  Second,  the  Chief\nSecretary  will  be  assigned  disciplinary  powers  over  all  department  secretaries  and  provincial\nadministrators.  Third,  the  NEC  will  require  department  heads  in  future  to  submit  annual\nperformance plans and annual performance (accomplishment) reports to PMNEC. At the same\ntime, the 2002 budget circular (released at the end of August 2001) requires the annual budget\nsubmissions  to  be  accompanied  by  annual  performance  targets  and  outputs  of  the  agencies\nconcerned. Fourth, all departments will be required to submit annual updates of corporate plans\nand  annual  performance  reports,  which  are  also  to  be  available  to  the  public  and  the  media.\nInitial submissions of these documents to the CACC will begin in mid-2002 for central agencies\nand major service departments (health, education, and works and transport). Finally, at the staff\nlevel,  a  strengthened  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  (and  associated\nimplementation plan) is being prepared for approval by the CACC.\n\n2.\n\nReorienting Personnel Management Systems and Processes\n\n48.\nThe  professionalism,  integrity,  and  independence  of  the  public  service  has  been\nundermined over the past decade as a result of arbitrary decisions. The capacity of the public\nservice  to  deliver  on  its  responsibilities  has  been  compromised.  Departments  and  agencies\nhave lost a spectrum of skills that are required in an effective public service.\n\n49.\nA  detailed  improvement  plan  for  managing  and  developing  public  service  human\nresources  has  been  developed.  The  aim  is  to  improve  human  resource  management  by  (i)\nreestablishing  the  Public  Services  Commission  (PSC)  as  an  independent  and  competent\ngovernance  agency  for  the  public  service;  (ii)  reconstructing  the  DPM  as  a  central  agency\ncapable of providing the human resource development strategic management for the CACC and\nthe  wider  public  service;  and  (iii)  reforming  the  Institute  of  Public  Administration  to  produce,\ntrain, and develop the next generation of skilled and professional public servants.\n\n\f11\n\nA  detailed  plan  for  public  sector  human  resources  management  and  development  has\n50.\nbeen prepared covering organizational redesign, capacity building, strategic policy analysis, and\nimplementation.  The  intention  is  to  professionalize  the  public  service.  Merit-based  recruitment\nand  selection  procedures  are  being  introduced.  A  senior  executive  service  system  has  been\nendorsed  to  improve  the  preparation  and  capacity  of  the  senior  ranks\u2014this  will  include  a\nmentoring  system  and  training  programs.  A  new  protocol  for  the  selection,  retention,\ntermination, and transfer of departmental heads is being introduced to improve stability, ensure\nobjectivity  in  personnel  decisions,  and  prevent  arbitrary  or  irregular  action  (from  the  political\nlevel) with respect to the executive corps of the civil service. The General Orders are also being\nrevised  to  ensure  consistency  with  principles  of  fairness,  nondiscrimination,  due  process,  and\ntransparency.  Training  systems  are  being  strengthened,  with  improved  resourcing  and\nmanagement. The PSC is being strengthened with increased resources and greater powers; in\nparticular,  PSC's  decisions  will  be  made  binding.  An  immediate  aim  is  to  reduce  the  large\nbacklog of unresolved PSC cases.\n\n51.\nInadequate  personnel  control  systems  and  procedures  have  undermined  efforts  to\nreduce  public  service  employment  and  control  payroll  costs  in  recent  years.  The  process  of\ntransferring activities to provincial governments has contributed to slowly increasing aggregate\npublic  sector  employment.  The  Government  is  committed  to  reversing  this  trend.  The\nGovernment has maintained a hiring freeze throughout the public sector since 1999, except in\nsome  priority  areas,  including  health,  education,  and  law  enforcement.  A  new  payroll  and\nhuman  resource  management  system  is  being  introduced;  it  will  improve  costing  and\nforecasting, and help eliminate fraudulent payments. The payroll and human resource system is\nbeing  closely  linked  with  the  new  budget  and  expenditure  control  systems.  Employee  status,\nremuneration  and  benefits  are  being  verified  in  coordination  with  the  introduction  of  the  new\nhuman  resource  management  and  payroll  system  which  will  help  eliminate  erroneous\npayments.  Retrenchments  are  being  carried  out  on  a  carefully  selected  basis  with  a  view  to\nreducing the payroll cost while maintaining suitable levels of service delivery.\n\n3.\n\nStrengthening of Probity and Oversight Agencies\n\n52.\nFor the process to be sustainable, the public service needs to be open, transparent, and\naccountable  to  the  community.  For  this  reason,  the  key  oversight  organizations  (Auditor\nGeneral's Office, Department of Justice and Attorney General, and Ombudsman Commission)\nare  being  strengthened.  Their  effective  functioning  can  also  help  to  deter  corruption  and\narbitrary action. Detailed action plans have been developed, and work has begun to implement\nthem. The action plans include measures to ensure that the agencies receive a budget that will\npermit them to carry out their mandates.\n\n53.\nThe Auditor General\u2019s Office has a key role in ensuring the financial accountability of the\nGovernment. The implementation of the action plan to strengthen the Auditor General\u2019s Office\nwill  help  in  the  timely  completion  of  the  audits  of  the  2000  and  2001  accounts  of  the\nGovernment. Moreover, the effectiveness of the Auditor General\u2019s Office is being enhanced by\ncontracting out part of the audit work program to private firms. In 2001, under a contract with a\nprivate  auditing  firm,  the  financial  and  control  systems  of  the  Department  of  Health  were\naudited,  resulting in significant recommendations for reducing wastage and tightening controls\nin  local  government  funding,  personnel  management,  procurement,  and  distribution  systems.\nBecause  of  the  success  of  the  audit,  a  similar  independent  audit  of  the  Department  of\nEducation\u2019s  financial  and  control  systems  will  be  conducted,  also  under  the  auspices  of  the\nAuditor General\u2019s Office. The Government intends to continue outsourcing to permit the backlog\n\n\f12\n\nof unaudited accounts, including those for statutory bodies and certain Government agencies, to\nbe cleared in the next 1-2 years.\n\n54.\nFor  both  the  Ombudsman  Commission  and  the  Auditor  General\u2019s  Office,  a  major\nweakness was the inadequacy of budget resources. Funding was increased substantially in the\n2000  and  2001  budgets.  The  2002  budget  for  the  two  agencies  will  ensure  the  resource\nrequirements identified in the action plans. The Department of Justice and Attorney General is\nalso  being  strengthened  under  a  program  funded  by  the  Australian  Agency  for  International\nDevelopment (AusAID); special attention, in this regard, is being given to building the capacity\nof  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  so  it  can  work  in  tandem  with  the\nombudsman to prepare and process complaints to bring erring public officials to account in the\ncourts.\n\n4.\n\nImproving Delivery of Major Services\n\n55.\nPreliminary  functional  and  expenditure  reviews  of  selected  Government  departments\nand  agencies  began  in  2000,  with  external  assistance,  notably  from  ADB.  Each  department\u2019s\nhuman  resource  requirements  and  administrative  performance  were  evaluated,  with  a  view  to\nidentifying areas for improved organization of roles and functioning, for possible savings, where\nadditional resources are needed, and where other nongovernment agents might perform better.\n\n56.\nAs  a  result  of  these  initial  reviews,  1,380  civil  servants  have  been  retrenched  during\n2001,  and  a  further  1,400  have  been  identified  for  retrenchment  together  with  some  2,000\u2013\n2,250  soldiers.  Further  retrenchments  are  likely  to  be  identified  through  the  functional  and\nexpenditure  review  process.  A  training  program  for  retrenched  public  servants  is  being\ndeveloped. Care is being given to ensure that the retrenched staff and positions are those that\nare redundant or are not required for the delivery of major services to the public.\n\nA key focus of the reforms being supported under the PSP is strengthening the delivery\n57.\nof the key basic services\u2014health, education, primary industry, transport infrastructure. This will\ninclude  supply  of  services  by  churches  and  other  nongovernment  agencies,  as  well  as  direct\nsupply by Government. The emphasis is to improve the processes and procedures. Working at\nthe provincial level, initially in four pilot provinces, and bringing together key decision makers at\nnational  and  provincial  levels  in  a  dialogue  with  the  two  central  agency  functions  (human\nresource  management  and  finance),  service  improvement  plans  have  been  developed  to\naddress  key  issues  (including  the  effect  on  churches  and  other  nongovernment  service\nproviders).  Common  themes  emerge:  (i)  inadequate  supplies,  equipment,  and  systems;  (ii)\ninadequately  qualified  personnel;  (iii)  inadequate  infrastructure;  (iv) inadequate  coordination\namong  service  providers  (public  and  nongovernment);  and  (v)  poor  community  awareness  of\nservice delivery issues. The solutions comprise improvements in staff capacities and processes\nthat  can  be  introduced  with  little  additional  resources  and  structural  and  infrastructure\nimprovements that will require additional resourcing. The 2001 budget and general Government\nplans provide for substantially increased funding of local services. The emphasis under the PSP\nis  to  improve  the  processes  by  which  the  existing  human  and  other  resources  are  used  to\ndeliver  needed  services.  To  facilitate  the  procedural  and  process  improvements,  the  Service\nImprovement Support Group has been established centrally to provide advisory support to line\nagencies  and provincial agencies. Complementing the work at the provincial level, for each of\nthe  basic  services,  initial  service  improvement  plans  have  been  developed.  The  ongoing\nfunctional and expenditure reviews will lead to longer term plans of action aiming at more deep-\nseated reforms in the way services are delivered at provincial and national levels.\n\n\f13\n\nThe  emphasis  in  each  agency  is  to  improve  service  delivery  through  focus  on\n58.\nperformance. Each of the central line agencies will develop and publish service standards for all\nservices, cost the resources necessary to provide the standards of service, develop an internal\npolicy  development  capacity,  develop  a  continuous  improvement  support  facility,  establish\nperformance  reporting  data,  and  set  monitorable  targets  for  the  central  services.  Each  central\nline agency will second facilitators to the Service Improvement Support Group, and they will be\ntrained  in  continuous  improvement  techniques  and  then  apply  these  techniques  starting  with\ncentral agencies and moving to the provinces. Each pilot province will establish teams to map,\nbenchmark,  and  improve  priority  services;  develop  simple  reporting  systems;  and  coach\ndeliverers  to  improve  service  quality.  Each  pilot  province  will  establish  service  quality\nimprovement  teams  in  the  provincial  administrations.  These  teams  will  concentrate  on  priority\nservices, coaching district and provincial teams in improving their productivity. Award programs\nwill be established to recognize and reward high performing staff and service delivery units.\n\nD. \n\nSocial and Environmental Issues\n\n1.\n\nSocial Impact\n\n59.\nThe poverty impact of the PSP is discussed in Appendix 4. In summary, implementation\nof  the  PSP  and  the  funding  support  provided  by  the  PSP  loan  will  result  in  improved  public\nservice  delivery.  Higher  and  more  focused  public  spending  will  provide  greater  access  to  key\npublic services by the poor in four provinces. Hence, the major positive impact on the poor of\nthe PSP is increased access to basic public services.\n\nIn  addition,  there  will  be  indirect  positive  impact  through  the  labor  market,  by  enabling\n60.\nmore  private  sector  activity.  This  in  turn  will  increase  the  chances  of  higher  economic  growth\nand employment creation. The increased demand is likely to benefit those in formal employment\nprimarily, and may generate some employment in the informal sector.\n\n61.\nThe  loan  will  support  the  Government's  efforts  to  maintain  a  stable  macroeconomic\nenvironment while implementing the SRP. It will cover short- and medium-term adjustment costs\nduring 2001-2003. It will augment foreign reserves and thus alleviate any speculative pressure\non the currency that could lead to depreciation and higher prices. On the other hand, the easing\nof the constraint on public expenditure will increase aggregate demand, which will increase the\ngeneral  price  level.  The  net  effect  cannot  be  predicted,  but  is  unlikely  to  have  a  significant\nimmediate impact on poverty. In the medium to long run, the structural adjustments are likely to\nresult  in  improved  productivity  and  a  positive  supply  response  with  a  beneficial  impact  on\npoverty.\n\n62.\nThe  PSP  loan  may  increase  the  likelihood  of  a  nominal  appreciation  of  the  currency,\nwhich  could  have  a  negative  effect  on  the  poor  insofar  as  they  are  net  producers  of  traded\ngoods and net consumers of nontraded goods. Against this, the PSP underpins the provision of\nbasic  services  at  zero  or  nominal  charges,  thus  benefiting  the  poor.  The  net  effect  of  relative\nprice shifts is difficult to predict, but is in any case substantially overshadowed by the positive\nimpact on the availability of public goods and services with the PSP.\n\n63.\nThe impact on transfers through direct Government programs is largely covered by the\npoverty impact assessment matrix category of access of the poor to nonmarketed public goods\nand  services.  In  addition,  however,  the  PSP  will  enhance  the  capacity  to  formulate  and\nimplement public works programs in which the poor are given work.\n\n\f14\n\nAccordingly, the PSP will have a significant positive impact on the poor because of the\n64.\npositive  effect  of  basic  public  services.  The  public  service  will  become  performance  oriented,\nand public expenditure on the services essential to poverty alleviation will increase. The direct\npositive  effect  will  be  reinforced  by  the  indirect  positive  effects  of  a  better  governance\nenvironment and improved public administration on economic growth.\n\n65.\nThe  CACC  will  retain  the  responsibility  for  overall  coordination  of  the  PSP,  while  the\nPSRMU established by the NEC will be responsible for coordination on a daily basis. General\nmonitoring  of  PSP  implementation  will  be  undertaken  by  ADB  in  partnership  with  the\nGovernment  on  a  regular  basis\u2014formal  joint  reviews  by  ADB  and  PSRMU  will  be  undertaken\nevery six months, supplementing PSRMU reports every three months. For assessing the PSP\u2019s\nimpact on poverty, key performance indicators will be the share of public expenditure allocated\nto  basic  service  provision  in  rural  areas  (details  of  this  allocation  are  available  for  the  health\nsector  and  are  being  developed  for  education),  and  the  extent  of  client  satisfaction  with\nprovincial service delivery as revealed in surveys. A system of client satisfaction surveys will be\nestablished  under  the  program,  to  be  contracted  out  to  qualified  commercial  organizations.\nResults of the latter are to be documented in the reports of line ministries to CACC. Ultimately,\nprogress  in  reducing  poverty  may  be  evaluated  through  regular  poverty  analyses  based  on\ncomparable household survey data.\n\n2.\n\nEnvironmental Issues\n\n66.\nThe  PSP  is  classified  as  Category  C  by  ADB\u2019s  environmental  classification  system.  Its\nenvironmental  impact  is  expected  to  be  minimal.  The  PSP  does  not  deal  directly  with\nenvironmental concerns. Other funding agencies, particularly AusAID and the World Bank, are\nproviding  assistance  and  supporting  reforms  to  deal  with  resource  and  environmental\nmanagement  issues,  notably  in  the  forestry  sector,  where  there  remain  significant  issues.\nHowever,  the  corruption-reducing  effects  of  the  PSP  should  be  of  particular  benefit  in  the\nforestry sector.\n\nA. \n\nAmount of Loan and Source of Funds\n\nVI. \n\nTHE PROPOSED LOAN\n\n67.\nIt is proposed that ADB provide from its ordinary capital resources a loan of $70 million\nto support the PSP, as part of the Government\u2019s SRP. The amount of the loan is based on the\ncost  of  the  ongoing  structural  adjustment,  including  direct  costs  of  the  PSP,  and  reflects  the\nimportance  and  urgency  of  the  reforms,  the  state  of  the  public  finances  in  PNG,  and  the\navailability  of  funding  for  the  Government\u2019s  overall  program.  The  loan  and  its  proposed  use\nhave been included in the Government\u2019s agreement with IMF. The loan funds will be released in\ntwo  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of  $35  million  will  be  made  available  when  the  loan  becomes\neffective; the net amount disbursed will reflect amounts due to ADB, including the front-end fee\non the loan and recovery of project preparatory TA costs. The second tranche of $35 million will\nbe made available when all conditions for release of the second tranche have been fulfilled, as\nspecified  in  the  policy  matrix.  This  is  targeted  for  September  2002;  however,  should  the\nconditions be satisfied earlier, then the second tranche may be released earlier.\n\nB. \n\nInterest, Maturity, and Disbursement Period\n\n68.\nThe loan will have a maturity of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest\nrate  determined  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  lending  facility  based  on  the  London  interbank\noffer  rate  (LIBOR);  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75  percent  per  annum;  a  front-end  fee  of\n\n\f15\n\n1.0 percent  (which  will  be  capitalized  in  the  loan  and  deducted  from  the  first  tranche);\nconversion  options  that  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  draft  Loan\nAgreement,  the  Loan  Regulation,  and  ADB\u2019s  Conversion  Guidelines;  and  other  terms  and\nconditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the\nreasons for PNG\u2019s decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of\nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) assurance that these choices were PNG's own independent\ndecision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  of  ADB.  The  loan  is\nexpected to be disbursed over a 10-month period, with PSP implementation continuing until the\nend of 2003.\n\nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\nTo  ensure  appropriate,  high-level,  and  effective  coordination  during  implementation  of\n69.\nthe PSP, the CACC will be tasked with overall coordination, in consultation with the heads of the\nconcerned agencies. The Government has established a secretariat to support CACC activities\nand  will  provide  the  secretariat  with  necessary  staff  and  resources,  acceptable  to  ADB,\nthroughout PSP implementation. The Department of Treasury will be the Executing Agency for\nthe PSP (with primary responsibility for the loan and loan funds). PMNEC will be responsible for\nthe PSP and its overall implementation. Key agencies to be involved in PSP implementation will\nbe DPM, the Department of Finance, and the Department of National Planning and Monitoring.\nThe  implementation  will  be  coordinated  on  a  day-to-day  basis  by  the  PSRMU  and  will  be\nundertaken by all concerned agencies. External assistance for implementation will be provided\nunder the PSP.\n\nD. \n\nDisbursement and Procurement\n\n70.\nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  against  a  broad  range  of  imports  with  the\ncounterpart funds generated to be used to support the costs of PSP implementation and related\nadjustment  costs.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  used  only  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange\ncosts  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries  except  the  ineligible  items\n(Appendix 5) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The Government\nwill submit with each withdrawal request a certification that the value of total net eligible imports\nis  expected  to  be  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  ADB  projected  disbursements\nunder the PSP loan in a given period, and that the required withdrawal will be used to finance\neligible  items  procured  in  accordance  with  the  loan  agreement  provisions.  ADB  will  have  the\nright  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Government's\ncertification. Procurement using loan funds will be based on normal commercial practice by the\nprivate sector, except that goods commonly traded on international commodity markets will be\nprocured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade. ADB will continue to ensure\nthat  standard  public  and  private  procurement  procedures  used  in  PNG  are  adequate  in\ncompetition and efficiency.\n\nE. \n\nCounterpart Funds\n\nCounterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the PSP will be used to finance local\n71.\ncounterpart costs related to the implementation of the PSP and the SRP during 2001\u20132003. An\nindicative  allocation  of  use  of  the  funds  has  been  agreed.  The  Government  will  ensure  that\nsufficient counterpart funds are made available to meet the costs associated with implementing\nthe  PSP.  The  PSP  funds  will  enable  the  Government  to  continue  its  retrenchment  program\n(initially  $13  million)  including  the  costs  of  repatriation,  begin  implementing  the  service\nimprovement  plans  and  departmental  functional  review  recommendations  ($8 million),  and\nbegin  implementing  the  new  payroll  and  human  resource  management  system  ($4 million).  It\n\n\f16\n\nwill  also  help  finance  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  program  of  privatization  and  regulatory  and\ncompetition reviews ($12 million), and other structural reform activities ($3 million). Any amounts\nnot  needed  for  these  direct  structural  adjustment  costs  will  be  used,  as  agreed  by  the\nGovernment  and  ADB,  to  enable  the  Government  to  continue  its  program  of  retiring  the  most\nexpensive  (mostly  domestic)  public  debt  and  arrears.  This  program  of  expenditures  is  fully\nconsistent with the agreed IMF and World Bank programs.\n\nF. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching\n\n72.\nADB will carry out periodic reviews of progress in implementing the PSP. Formal reviews\nwill be undertaken jointly by ADB and the PSRMU (with CACC supervision) every six months.\nThe  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  outcome  of  policy  discussions  that  are  with\nother multilateral and bilateral aid agencies and that have implications for implementation of the\nSRP.  The  representatives  of  the  Government,  ADB,  and  other  major  funding  agencies  for  the\nSRP  will  meet  at  least  every  six  months  to  review  implementation  of  the  overall  SRP  and  the\nPSP.  The  meetings  will  continue  after  the  closing  of  the  loan  and  will  cover  at  least  the  PSP\nperiod  to  the  end  of  2003.  A  key  focus  of  monitoring  will  be  performance  on  the  broad  policy\nreforms;  external  assistance  is  to  be  made  available  as  required,  both  under  the  PSP  and  in\nseparate initiatives.\n\nIn  addition  to  quarterly  progress  reports  on  PSP  performance  (to  be  prepared  by  the\n73.\nPSRMU), the Government will submit a program completion report to ADB within three months\nof  the  loan  closing  date.  This  report  will  evaluate  the  implementation  of  the  policy  reform\nmeasures under the PSP, their impact on the economy, lessons learned during the PSP period,\nand further reforms and assistance required in the medium term.\n\n74.\nThe  loan  funds  will  be  released  in  two  tranches  of  equal  size.  The  tranche  release\nconditions are contained in the policy matrix (Appendix 3). The first tranche ($35 million), from\nwhich  the  loan  front-end  fee  and  project  preparatory  TA  costs  will  be  deducted,  will  be  made\navailable after loan effectiveness (expected December 2001). The second tranche ($35 million)\nwill  be  disbursed  upon  compliance  with  second  tranche  conditions.  The  second  release  is\ntargeted for September 2002. However, at Government request, the release could be advanced,\nif release conditions have been satisfied.\n\nVII. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA. \n\nBenefits\n\n75.\nThe  PSP  will  help  the  Government's  efforts  to  place  the  economy  on  a  sound  and\nsustainable  path  and  to  begin  to  establish  an  effective  and  efficient  public  service,  capable  of\ndelivering  basic  services.  The  PSP  will  help  begin  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  the  public\nservice  by  introducing  a  performance  orientation  and  accountability  mechanisms,  and  by\nhelping to streamline procedures. The PSP will help to achieve fiscal balance by trimming the\nsize  of  the  public  service,  including  measures  to  mitigate  harmful  impacts  by  financing  the\ncompensation packages for retrenched public servants. Reduction in expensive public debt will\nreduce  debt  servicing.  The  PSP  will  help  revitalize  the  operations  of  the  public  service  by\nreforming personnel management, and introducing stronger and more effective human resource\ndevelopment  mechanisms.  The  PSP  will  also  be  instrumental  in  assisting  the  Government  to\nrestore the integrity of public institutions.\n\n\fB. \n\nPoverty Impact\n\n17\n\n76.\nImplementation of the PSP and the funding support provided by the PSP loan will ensure\nimproved public service delivery. In particular, access by the poor in four provinces to key public\nservices  will  increase  as  a  result  of  more  focused  public  spending.  Hence,  the  major  positive\nimpact on the poor will be increased access to basic public services.\n\n77.\nIn  addition,  the  PSP  will  have  some  indirect  positive  effects  through  the  labor  market.\nWith  public  service  and  governance  reforms,  the  private  sector  will  be  able  to  increase  its\nactivity.  This  in  turn  will  help  accelerate  economic  growth  and  consequently  contribute  to\nemployment creation. Public spending will then increase, and will increase the demand for labor\nindirectly. The increased demand is likely to primarily benefit people in formal employment, and\nmay generate employment for people in the informal sector.\n\n78.\nIn regard to relative price  movements, the provision of the PSP loan may increase the\nlikelihood of a nominal appreciation of the currency, which could have a negative effect on the\npoor who are net producers of traded goods and net consumers of nontraded goods. However,\nthe PSP loan will support the provision of publicly-supplied services at zero or nominal charges,\nthus benefiting the poor. The net effect of relative price shifts is difficult to predict, but will in any\ncase  be  substantially  overshadowed  by  the  positive  impact  on  the  availability  of  public  goods\nand services under the PSP. In addition, the PSP will encourage a greater capacity to formulate\nand implement public works programs that provide job opportunities for the poor.\n\n79.\nIn sum, the PSP will have a significant positive impact on the poor because of a direct\npositive  effect  on  the  provision  of  basic  public  services.  The  public  services  will  improve  as\nmanagement  focuses  on  performance  and  public  expenditure  on  the  services  essential  to\npoverty  alleviation  is  increased.  The  direct  positive  effect  will  be  reinforced  by  the  indirect\npositive  effects  of  a  better  governance  environment  and  improved  public  administration  on\neconomic growth.\n\nC. \n\nRisks\n\nA  major  risk  relates  to  the  adequacy  of  agency  capacity  and  human  and  budget\n80.\nresources.  Improving  this  capacity  is  the  long-term  goal  of  the  reform  process.  The  risk  has\nbeen mitigated by specifically targeting PSP activities to begin the necessarily long process of\nstrengthening public sector management and achievement. Consultants will be used to help in\nparticular reform tasks where Government capacities are insufficient.\n\n81.\nAnother  risk  to  the  successful  implementation  of  the  PSP  is  that  adversely  affected\ngroups may seek to undermine the content and the timing of the reforms. Such risks have been\nmitigated  by  the  strong  commitment  of  senior  officials  to  continue  with  the  reforms.  The  most\nimmediately affected are those being retrenched, whose potential resistance is to be mitigated\nby appropriate compensation.\n\nThere  are  also  risks  relating  to  the  sustainability  of  the  measures.  These  have  been\n82.\nminimized by restricting the recurrent implications of the reform measures as much as possible,\nand  by  focusing  the  PSP  on  priority  restructuring  needs.  The  loan  will  not  be  used  to  finance\nexisting recurrent budget requirements.\n\n\f18\n\nVIII.  ASSURANCES\n\nIn  addition  to  the  conditions  for  tranche  releases  and  the  standard  assurances,  the\n\n83.\nGovernment has assured ADB that\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Loan Agreement,\nas  described  in  the  Government's  development  policy  letter  of  14  November\n2001 and the policy matrix, will continue in effect for the duration of the PSP, and\n\nit will promptly adopt the other policies and take the other actions included in the\nPSP,  as  described  in  the  policy  matrix,  and  ensure  that  these  policies  and\nactions continue in effect for the duration of the PSP.\n\n84.\nIt  was  also  agreed  that  the  Government  and  ADB  will  continue  their  dialogue  on\nproblems and constraints encountered during the implementation of the PSP and of the broader\nSRP, including difficulties encountered in the monitoring process. The Government has assured\nADB that it will keep ADB informed of policy discussions concerning the SRP undertaken with\nother international and bilateral agencies as ADB may reasonably request, and will provide ADB\nwith the opportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals.\n\nIX. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n85.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the\nArticles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board approve the loan of $70,000,000 to\nthe  Independent  State  of  Papua  New  Guinea  for  the  Public  Service  Program  from  ADB\u2019s\nordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased loan facility, an amortization period of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years, and\nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  the  draft  Loan\nAgreement presented to the Board.\n\n19 November 2001\n\nMYOUNG-HO SHIN\nVice-President\n\n\f19\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber Title\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nProgram Framework\n\nDevelopment Policy Letter\n\nPolicy Matrix\n\nPoverty Impact Assessment\n\nIneligible Items\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\n20\n\n26\n\n43\n\n49\n\n57\n\n1, 3\n\n1, 3\n\n1, 3\n\n13, 59\n\n15, 70\n\n\f20\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nPROGRAM FRAMEWORK\n\nNarrative Summary\n\nIndicators and Targets\n\nGoal\nImproved living\nstandards for population\nof Papua New Guinea\n\nMonitoring\nMechanisms\n\nKey Assumptions\nand Risks\n\n1.

In  Papua  New  Guinea\n(PNG)  during  the  1990s,  these  pillars  were  weakened.  The  governance  environment\ndeteriorated significantly; there was little, if any, progress as measured by social development\nindicators; and economic growth slowed down as the effects of external economic shocks were\ncompounded  by  macroeconomic  mismanagement.    Over  37  percent  of  the  population  was\nbelow the national poverty line in 1996.\n\n2. \nThe Government that won office in July 1999 formulated the Structural Reform Program\n(SRP) 2000 with the key objectives of promoting good governance, sustaining macroeconomic\nstability,  improving  public  sector  performance,  and  removing  barriers  to  investment  and\neconomic development.  The proposed Public Service Program (PSP) will play a pivotal role in\nthe  achievement  of  good  governance  and  improved  public  sector  performance  in  PNG,  and\nthereby  will  promote  the  broad-based  economic  growth  and  social  development  that  are\nessential if poverty is to be reduced. The PSP will build a performance orientation in the public\nservice  that  emphasizes  service  delivery,  transparency,  and  accountability.  It  will  ensure  the\nsupportive  strengthening  of  personnel  management  systems  and  processes;  and  it  will\nstrengthen  the  key  governance  agencies  (the  Auditor  General's  Office  and  Ombudsman\nCommission). The PSP will make delivery of major services at national and subnational levels\nmore  predictable  and  effective.  Service  improvement  plans  for  health,  education,  agriculture,\nand  transport  infrastructure  will  be  formulated  and  implemented  in  four  rural  provinces\u2014one\nfrom each of PNG\u2019s four regions. This improvement in public service delivery to rural areas is\nthe major means by which PSP will alleviate PNG\u2019s serious poverty problem.\n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis\n\n3.\nMost  of  the  people  of  PNG  remain  poor  by  regional  and  international  standards,  though\nsome  economic  and  social  progress  has  been  made  since  independence.  The  human\ndevelopment index (HDI), as measured by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),\nrose from 0.325 in 1970 to 0.507 in 1995, with life expectancy rising from 40 to 54 years.2  The\nHDI score for 1998 of 0.542 placed PNG in 133rd position on a list of 174 developing countries.\nAmong Pacific Island countries, PNG ranked last on the HDI scale.3  In the area of health, there\nwas some evidence of regress in the 1990s.4\n\n4. \nThe human poverty index for PNG is at the level of Burundi and Mali, which are among the\nmost poverty afflicted nations in the world.  On the evidence from a 1996 household survey, 31.0\n\n                                                          \n1 R179-99:  Fighting  Poverty  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific\u2014The  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  of  the  Asian  Development\n\nBank, 19 October.\n\n2  UNDP. 1998.

Pacific Human\nDevelopment Report 1999: Creating Opportunities. Suva, Fiji. In the former report, the HDI is calculated using real\ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita  in  purchasing  power  parity  dollars.  In  the  latter  report,  real  GDP  per\ncapita  in  dollars  converted  at  market  exchange  rates  is  used,  thus  generating  lower  GDP  per  capita  and  HDI\nnumbers.\n\n4  UNDP. 1998. Papua New Guinea Human Development Report 1998. Office of National Planning, Government of\n\nPapua New Guinea, Port Moresby.\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\npercent of the PNG population live below the international poverty line of $1 per capita per day.5\nThis incidence of poverty is high compared to countries with similar income levels. Using a slightly\nhigher  country-specific  poverty  line, 37.5  percent  of  the  population  is  living  in  poverty,  with  their\naverage  consumption  level  being  two-thirds  of  the  poverty  line  consumption  level  of  461  kina\n(1996  prices)  per  adult  equivalent  per  year.6    Approximately  17  percent  of  the  PNG  population\ncannot  meet  the  basic  requirement  of  2,200  calories  per  day  per  adult  equivalent,  even  if  they\nspend all their income on food.\n\nPoverty  coexists  with  wealth.  The  richest  10  percent  of  the  population  account  for  36\n 5.\npercent  of  consumption,  whereas  the  poorest  50  percent  account  for  just  20  percent.  The  Gini\ncoefficient of 0.461 is high by comparison with countries of similar income levels. This is in large\npart a reflection of the dualistic pattern of growth since independence. Growth has been led by a\ncapital-intensive minerals sector generating state revenues that substantially have been used to\nsupport  consumption  by  an  urban,  public  sector  elite.  The  vast  majority  of  the  population\ncontinues to depend on semi-subsistence activities. Per capita real gross domestic product in the\nnonmining economy grew at the average rate of just 0.2 percent per annum during 1978\u20131998,\ncompared with an aggregate per capita growth rate of 1.1 percent.\n\n6. \nPoverty in PNG has an important regional dimension. The vast majority of the poor (93.5\npercent)  live  in  rural  areas.  The  Momase/North  Coast  Region  exhibits  the  highest  incidence  of\npoverty,  with  45.8  percent  of  the  population  living  below  the  poverty  line.  Poverty  rates  in  the\nregions of Papua/South Coast, the Highlands, and the New Guinea Islands are 33.2 percent, 35.8\npercent, and 33.6 percent, respectively. Momase/North Coast and the Highlands together account\nfor  73.8  percent  of  the  poor.  The  urbanized  National  Capital  District  has  a  poverty  rate  of  25.8\npercent, and accounts for just 3.8 percent of the poor.\n\n7. \nComparisons  of  poverty  rates  at  the  provincial  level  are  not  possible  because  of  lack  of\ndata,  but  provincial  human  poverty  and  human  development  indexes  have  been  calculated  and\nare presented in Table A4.1. These show that poverty and low levels of human development are\nespecially problematic in two north coast provinces (west and east Sepik), and the five highlands\nprovinces (Eastern Highlands, Enga, Simbu, Southern Highlands, and Western Highlands).\n\nPoverty and low levels of human development also have an important gender dimension\n8.\n(Table A4.1). Although improving over time, the gender-related development index is lower than\nthe  overall  HDI  at  the  national  level  and  for  all  provinces,  demonstrating  that  women\u2019s  life\nexpectancy, income, and educational levels are universally below men\u2019s. Indeed, PNG is one of\nthe  few  countries  in  the  world  where  women  have  a  lower  life  expectancy  than  men.  While\nwomen  are  under  represented  in  senior  positions  in  the  private  and  public  sectors,  the\nprofessions, and politics, they do a disproportionately large amount of work in the rural sector.7\n\nMost poor households are located in relatively inaccessible rural areas, and exhibit some\n9. \nnotable characteristics that suggest areas of potential poverty-alleviating interventions.  Almost\n52 percent of the poor live in households whose head has never attended school. The poverty\n                                                          \n5  The World Bank. 1999.

A  further  23  percent  of  the  poor  live  in  households\nwhose head has not been educated beyond grade 6. The poverty rate for these households is\n41 percent. Clearly, there has been little, if any, human capital investment in three quarters of\nthe poor households. Girls\u2019 enrollment rates are significantly influenced by the education level of\nadult females in the household, so that there is a vicious circle of low enrollments-low levels of\nschooling-low  enrollments  that  will  be  broken  most  effectively  by  targeted  intervention.  The\nincidence of poverty is also linked to the ability to earn cash income to pay for nonfood items, to\nvary  and  improve  diets,  and  to  permit  savings  for  times  of  economic  difficulty  (e.g.,  drought).\nAlmost 17 percent of the poor population live in households whose heads earn no cash income,\nrelying entirely on subsistence production (and perhaps gifts of cash). The poverty rate for these\nhouseholds is 47 percent. Almost 8 percent of the poor are in households whose main source of\ncash  income  is  hunting,  gathering,  and  fishing.  The  poverty  rate  for  these  households  is  57\npercent.  Poverty  rates  are  also  above  the  national  average  for  households  that  earn  cash\nincome  from  tree  crops  (44.0  percent)  and  commercial  agriculture  (42.7  percent).  These\nhouseholds  account  for  42.5  percent  and  19.0  percent  of  the  poor  population,  respectively.\nWhere  household  heads  earn  cash  income  from  running  a  business  or  wage  employment,\npoverty  rates are much lower  (at  25  percent and 17 percent, respectively). Although the latter\nhouseholds collectively account for 29 percent of PNG\u2019s total population, they account for only\n14  percent  of  the  poor  population.  In  general,  increased  provision  of  opportunities  for  earning\nsecure cash incomes is needed to reduce the incidence and severity of poverty.\n\n10. \nBoth  the  extent  of  income-earning  opportunities  and  the  ability  to  respond  to  such\nopportunities  are  determined  to  a  significant  degree  by  access  to  the  basic  public  services  of\ntransport,  utilities,  health,  and  education.  The  PNG  population  as  a  whole  expressed\nconsiderable  dissatisfaction  with  access  to  services  in  1996,  and  it  is  highly  likely  that  the\ndegree of dissatisfaction increased during the late 1990s as a result of a widely-acknowledged\ndeterioration  in  service  provision.  Table  A4.2  shows  that  the  poorest  25  percent  of  the\npopulation  is  the  most  dissatisfied  quintile  overall,  and  that  dissatisfaction  is  highest  in  the\nHighlands  and  Momase/North  Coast  regions  where  the  majority  of  the  poor  live.  Poverty\nalleviation requires improved service delivery to rural areas.\n\nPNG  has  an  informal  social  safety  net  system  (the  wantok  system)  that  provides  for\n11.\nincome  transfers  in  cash  and  kind,  labor  transfers,  and  sharing  of  gardening  and  child  care.\nHowever, the system is limited in its effectiveness in communities with very high poverty rates,\nand  when  whole  communities  are  affected  by  natural  disasters  (such  as  volcanic  eruption  in\nRabaul). Disaster relief is provided through the Government\u2019s National Disaster and Emergency\nService, and by a number of nongovernment organizations, though both suffer from human and\nfinancial resource constraints. The formal social safety net provided by provident funds is limited\nto wage earners, and has been weakened by the past poor performance of the funds.\n\nC.\n\nAssessing the Impact of Reforms under the PSP\n\n12.\nA full assessment of the impact of the PSP on poverty requires comparing the situation\nwith and without the PSP. Conceptually, the only rigorous means of assessing the without-PSP\nscenario  is  to  use  a  social  accounting  matrix,  computable  general  equilibrium  model,  or  a\ncombination of the two. However, theoretical issues and practical problems limit the operational\nusefulness  of  this  approach.  Such  models  do  not  cope  well  with  reform  measures  such  as\ninstitutional  change  in  the  public  service  because  these  are  difficult  to  express  quantitatively.\nInstead,  analysis  must  be  largely  qualitative  and  supplemented  where  possible  by  selective\nquantification. ADB\u2019s Poverty Impact Assessment matrix is used as a means of organizing and\nsummarizing this analysis (Table A4.3).\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 4, page 4\n\nTable A4.1: Provincial Development, 1996\n\nProvince\n\nHuman Poverty\nIndex\n60.0\n56.7\n55.5\n54.1\n53.9\n52.4\n47.3\n43.4\n40.0\n39.4\n39.3\n36.6\n36.5\n32.2\n31.9\n31.8\n31.4\n30.9\n14.5\n43.7\n\nHuman Development\nIndex\n0.262\n0.274\n0.282\n0.320\n0.325\n0.283\n0.304\n0.336\n0.331\n0.421\n0.389\n0.396\n0.386\n0.472\n0.394\n0.431\n0.420\n0.408\n0.758\n0.363\n\nWest Sepik\nSouthern Highlands\nWestern Highlands\nSimbu\nEastern Highlands\nEnga\nEast Sepik\nMadang\nGulf\nManus\nMorobe\nNew Ireland\nOro (Northern)\nWestern\nWest New Britain\nEast New Britain\nMilne Bay\nCentral\nNational Capital District\nNational\nNotes: Data for Bougainville Province are not available.

Revenue  administration,  public  expenditure  management,  and  public  administration\ndeteriorated  in  the  1990s  as  corruption  and  political  patronage  undermined  the  professional\nethos  of  the  public  service.  As  shown  in  Table  A4.2,  while  there  is  widespread  dissatisfaction\nwith  public  service  delivery,  the  dissatisfaction  is  most  intense  in  the  poorest  rural  regions.\nThere  is  a  clear  and  positive  correlation  between  the  level  of  consumption  and  the  degree  of\nsatisfaction with access to health care, education, and transport facilities.\n\nIn  the  absence  of  the  PSP  and  associated  loan  funds,  the  provision  of  public  services\n14. \nwill remain inefficient and unresponsive to the needs of society, and the short- and medium-term\nbudget  constraint  on  public  expenditure  will  be  tighter  than  with  the  PSP.  The  general\nimprovement  in  the  governance  environment  that  is  necessary  to  stimulate  private  sector-led\neconomic  growth  will  not  occur;  and  there  will  be  no  improvement  in  service  delivery  to  rural\nareas  through  either  increased  public  spending  and/or  an  effective  reallocation  of  public\nspending.\n\nAs observed in ADB\u2019s study of poverty in the Pacific, \u201cpublic sector expenditure is one of\n15. \nthe keys to ensuring that the poor and underprivileged have equality of opportunity\u2026to transport\ninfrastructure  that  provides  the  rural  population  with  access  to  markets,  health  services,  and\neducation;  to  water  and  sanitation;  to  communication  networks\u2026;  to  power  that  provides  the\nlight necessary to study...\u201d8 Without the PSP and a program loan, access to these services by\nthe rural poor will not improve. Indeed, with the population growing at over 3 percent per annum,\naccess is likely to deteriorate if public spending neither increases sufficiently nor becomes more\neffectively targeted. Hence, in the poverty impact assessment matrix, the major negative impact\non the poor of the without-PSP scenario is reduced access to basic public services.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  major  negative  impact,  there  will  be  some  indirect  negative  effects\n16. \nthrough  the  labor  market.  Without  public  service  and  governance  reforms,  there  will  be  no\nimprovement  in  the  enabling  environment  for  the  private  sector.  This  in  turn  will  limit  the\nchances  of  accelerated  economic  growth  and  consequent  employment  creation.  Public\nspending  will  be  relatively  constrained,  reducing  demand  for  labor  indirectly,  and  perhaps\ndirectly if some public service downsizing is needed to maintain aggregate fiscal discipline.\n\n17. \nThe  current  administration  is  firmly  committed  to  maintaining  a  stable  macroeconomic\nenvironment,  and  has  introduced  legislation  that  ensures  the  central  bank  is  independent  and\nmay conduct sound monetary and exchange rate policies. This commitment is not likely to be\ndiminished  without  the  PSP,  but  the  absence  of  a  program  loan  could  make  fulfillment  of  the\ncommitment  more  difficult.  In  particular,  the  economy  will  be  more  vulnerable  to  speculative\ncapital outflows that placed downward pressure on the currency, and thus upwards pressure on\nthe general price level. On the other hand, the constraint on public expenditure imposed by the\nlack  of  a  program  loan  would  have  a  deflationary  effect.  The  net  effect  cannot  be  predicted,\ngiven the inherent uncertainty surrounding currency speculation.\n\n18. \nIn regard to relative price movements, the absence of a program loan may, as noted in\nthe previous paragraph, increase the likelihood of a nominal depreciation of the currency. To the\nextent that such a depreciation is not offset by inflation, and to the extent that the poor are net\nproducers  of  traded  goods  and  net  consumers  of  nontraded  goods,  there  may  be  a  positive\nimpact. However, this assumes there are no supply-side constraints, when in fact these seem to\nbe severe. In addition, within the nontraded goods sector, the absence of a program loan may\n\n                                                          \n8  ADB. 2001. Poverty: Is it an Issue in the Pacific?

If  this  were  to\nhappen, the poor would be losers. The net effect of relative price shifts is difficult to predict, but\nis in any case substantially overshadowed by the impact on the availability of public goods and\nservices without the PSP.\n\n19. \nThe  impact  on  transfers  through  direct  government  programs  is  largely  covered  by  the\nPIA  matrix  category  of  access  of  the  poor  to  nonmarketed  public  goods  and  services.  In\naddition, however, without the PSP, the diminished capacity to formulate and implement public\nworks programs in which the poor are given work will further diminish.\n\n20. \nIn  sum,  without  the  PSP,  the  poor  will  suffer  significant  adverse  impact  because  of  a\ndirect negative effect on the provision of basic public services. The public service will remain not\nfocused  on  the  clients,  and  public  expenditure  on  the  services  essential  to  poverty  alleviation\nwill be constrained. The direct negative effect will be reinforced by the indirect negative effects\nof continued poor governance and inefficient public administration on economic growth.\n\n2.\n\nWith the PSP and a Program Loan\n\n21. With the PSP, actions contained in the PSP program framework (Appendix 1) and policy\nmatrix  (Appendix  3)  will  be  fully  implemented  and  the  $70  million  program  loan  will  be  fully\ndisbursed in the fiscal years 2001 and 2002.  Public service delivery in general will improve, and\nspecifically in rural areas in health, education, agriculture, and transport infrastructure. The loan\nwill ease a severe budget constraint, permitting higher public expenditure on these key poverty-\nreducing services.\n\nChannel\n\nLabor Market\nPrices\nAccess for Poor (non-\nmarketed public\nservices)\nTransfers\nTotal Net Effect\n\nDirect\nNA\nNA\nN- major\n\nN\n\nTable A4.3: Poverty Impact Assessment Matrix\n\nScenario 1: Without the PSP\n\nScenario 2: With the PSP\n\nIndirect/Macro Nonpoor\n\nIndirect/Macro Nonpoor\n\nN\nIndeterminate\nNA\n\nNA\nAdverse:\nAnti-Poor\n\nReduced\naccess to\npublic services\n\nType of Effect\n\nN\nNA\nN\n\nNA\n\nDirect\nNA\nNA\nP- major\n\nP\n\nP\nNA\nP\n\nNA\n\nP\nIndeterminate\nNA\n\nNA\nPositive:\nPro-Poor\n\nImproved\naccess to\npublic services\n\nNotes: N=negative, NA=not applicable or no effect, P=positive.\nSource: ADB.

It  is  also  necessary  for  the\nefficient  and  effective  production  of  public  goods  and  services  and  the  formulation  and\nimplementation  of  economic  and  social  policy.9  PSP  is  a  crucial  element  in  the  move  toward\nsuch  a  public  service.

Within  the  context  of  a  medium-\nterm  public  sector  reform  plan,  these  actions  focus  on  establishing  strong  linkages  between\nbudget  appropriations  and  organizational  performance,  particularly  in  the  major  service\ndepartments  of  health,  education,  and  transport  and  works.  Performance  monitoring  and\nevaluation  and  reporting  systems  for  staff  and  departments  are  integral  components  of  the\nreform program. Departmental performance plans and reports are to be publicly available, and a\ncode of ethics and business conduct for the public service is to be enforced.\n\nSection two of the policy matrix presents the policy actions that will be taken to ensure\n23. \nthat  personnel  management  systems  and  processes  are  aligned  with  the  requirements  of  a\nperformance-oriented  public  service.  These  actions  center  on  capacity  building  in  the\nDepartment of Personnel Management and the Public Service Commission, and the integration\nof human resource management and payroll systems.\n\n24.\nSection  three  of  the  policy  matrix  presents  the  policy  actions  aimed  at  promoting  good\ngovernance in the public sector. These include strengthening the Auditor General\u2019s Office and\nthe Ombudsman Commission, and auditing of key service departments.\n\n25.\nSection four of the policy matrix details the policy actions that will improve the delivery of\nmajor  public  services,  especially  in  rural  areas.  In  the  context  of  a  functional  and  expenditure\nreview  of  central  agencies  and  key  national  line  departments,  the  Central  Agencies\nCoordination  Committee  (CACC)  will  require  a  quantified  results-oriented  budget  submission\nfrom  all  government  departments  and  agencies,  starting  in  2002.  CACC  has  established  a\nService  Improvement  Support  Group  at  the  national  level,  and  provincial  service  improvement\ncoordinators  have  been  appointed  in  Milne  Bay,  Morobe,  West  New  Britain,  and  Western\nHighlands  provinces.  Service  improvement  plans  will  be  formulated  for  the  four  national\ndepartments of health, education, agriculture and livestock, and works and transport; and they\nwill be implemented in these four provinces as the first step in improving public service delivery\nnationwide.  CACC  will  approve  and  disseminate  service  charters  specifying  performance\nstandards that clients can expect; and will demand reports on actual performance in provincial\nservice delivery. These reports must include results from client satisfaction surveys.\n\nImplementation  of  the  PSP  and  the  funding  support  provided  by  the  program  loan  will\n26.\nensure improved public service delivery. In particular, there will be greater access to key public\nservices by the poor in four provinces as a result of higher and more focused public spending.\nHence,  in  the  PIA  matrix,  the  major  positive  impact  of  the  PSP  on  the  poor  will  be  increased\naccess to basic public services.\n\n27.\nIn addition to the major positive impact, some indirect positive effects will occur through\nthe  labor  market.  With  public  service  and  governance  reforms,  private  sector  will  be  able  to\nincrease its activities. This in turn will increase the chances of accelerated economic growth and\nconsequent  employment  creation.  Public  spending  will  be  higher  than  without  the  PSP,\nincreasing demand for labor indirectly. The increased demand is likely to benefit those in formal\nemployment primarily, but also may generate employment for those in the informal sector.\n\n28. \nThe  loan  will  support  the  Government's  efforts  to  maintain  a  stable  macroeconomic\nenvironment  while  implementing  the  Structural  Reform  Program.  It  will  cover  short-  and\nmedium-term  adjustment  costs  during  2001-2003.  It  will  augment  foreign  reserves  and  thus\nalleviate  speculative  pressure  on  the  currency  that  could  lead  to  depreciation  and  thus  higher\nprices.  However,  the  easing  of  the  constraint  on  public  expenditure  will  increase  aggregate\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 4, page 8\n\ndemand, which by itself will increase the general price level. The net effect cannot be predicted,\nbut is unlikely to be significant in terms of its impact on poverty.\n\n29. \nIn regard to relative price movements, the provision of a program loan may increase the\nlikelihood of a nominal appreciation of the currency. To the extent that such an appreciation is\nreal,  there  may  be  a  negative  effect  on  the  poor  insofar  as  they  are  net  producers  of  traded\ngoods and net consumers of nontraded goods. Against this, the loan will help provide publicly-\nsupplied services at zero or nominal charges, thus benefiting the poor. The net effect of relative\nprice shifts is difficult to predict, but will be substantially overshadowed by the positive impact of\nthe availability of public goods and services under with the PSP.\n\n30. \nThe  impact  on  transfers  through  direct  government  programs  is  largely  covered  by  the\nPIA  matrix  category  of  access  of  the  poor  to  nonmarketed  public  goods  and  services.  In\naddition,  however,  under  with  the  PSP,  the  Government  will  have  a  greater  capacity  to\nformulate and implement public works programs in which the poor are given work.\n\nIn summary, with the PSP will have a significant positive impact on the poor because of\n31.\na direct positive effect on the provision of basic public services. The public services will become\nclient  oriented  and  performance  oriented,  and  public  expenditure  on  the  services  essential  to\npoverty  alleviation  will  increase.  The  direct  positive  effect  will  be  reinforced  by  the  indirect\npositive  effects  of  a  better  governance  environment  and  improved  public  administration  on\neconomic growth.\n\nD.\n\nMonitoring PSP Implementation and Evaluating Outcomes\n\n32.\nThe  CACC  will  retain  the  responsibility  for  overall  coordination  of  the  PSP,  while  the\nPublic  Sector  Reform  Management  Unit  established  by  the  National  Executive  Council  will  be\nresponsible for coordination on a daily basis. General monitoring of PSP implementation will be\nundertaken by ADB in partnership with the Government on a regular basis. For assessing the\nPSP\u2019s  impact  on  poverty,  key  performance  indicators  will  be  the  share  of  public  expenditure\nallocated  to  basic  service  provision  in  rural  areas,  and  the  extent  of  client  satisfaction  with\nprovincial service delivery as revealed in surveys.
