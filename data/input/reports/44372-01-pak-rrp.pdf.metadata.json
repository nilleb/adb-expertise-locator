The  reconstruction  targets  transport  (roads  and bridges)  and  irrigation \nfacilities,  including  drainage  and  flood  protection.  The  project  follows  priorities  described  in  a \ndamage and needs assessment report (DNA)2 prepared by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand  the  World  Bank  in  2010,  in  close  coordination  with  federal  and  provincial  government \nagencies  and  several  development  partners  (including  agencies  from  the  European  Union, \nGermany,  Japan,  the  United  Kingdom,  and  the  United  States).  The  project  is  aligned  with  the \nflood  reconstruction  plan  recently  prepared  by  the  Planning  Commission.  The  project  focuses \non  the  transitional  phase  of  emergency  response  for  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of \npriority infrastructure.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nDamage. The floods  of mid-2010  affected  20 million  people  and caused  1,600 deaths. \nBasic transport infrastructure and irrigation facilities were badly damaged. The same happened \nto health and education centers, housing, agriculture, livestock, fisheries and livelihoods. Eighty \nof  the  110  districts  across  Balochistan,  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa,  Punjab,  and  Sindh  were  all \nseriously  affected.  About  one  fifth  of  the  country  was  under  floods.  The  total  damage  is \nestimated at $10 billion.  \n \nGovernment\u2019s response. The government\u2019s response followed three phases: (i) rescue \n4. \nand  relief,  (ii)  early  recovery  (temporary  restoration),  and (iii)  reconstruction  and rehabilitation. \nThe  first  phase  was  handled  by  national  agencies.  The  work  was  swift  and  well-coordinated, \nespecially by the National Disaster Management Authority. External assistance (financial and in-\nkind)  was  mobilized  quickly  and  from  a  wide  range  of  sources,3 including  the  United  Nations \n(UN)  and  leading  nongovernment  organizations.  The  UN  launched  a  $2-billion  appeal,  raising \n$1.3  billion.  This  first  phase  of  the  response  is  now  practically  over  with  most  of  the  affected \npeople back in their villages, except small pockets of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and parts of Sindh.  \n \n5. \nEarly  recovery  phase  started  immediately  after  the  floods  subsided.  The  government\u2019s \nplan was to quickly and effectively restore services, and provide temporary housing and grants \nfor restoring agriculture and basic livelihoods. This second phase involved federal and provincial \ngovernments  and  major  national  organizations,  including  those  from  the  private  sector.  The \nscale of work delayed the permanent reconstruction works (third phase) but this was necessary \nand inevitable. The early recovery response was structured primarily on an unconditional cash \ntransfer  program  targeting  some  20  million  people  displaced  by  floods.  This  program  was \ncomplemented  by  an  appeal  to  international  donors  to  extend  new  or  additional  financial \nresources  in  the  form  of  grants,  channeled  through  the  national  budget.  The  objective  was  to \nreact quickly through quick-disbursing facilities. The support under the program itself amounts to \nPRs40,000  per family,  with a first tranche of  PRs20,000 made  available soon after  the floods. \n\n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 ADB and World Bank. 2010. Pakistan Floods 2010: Preliminary Damage and Needs Assessment. Islamabad. \n3 ADB provided a $3 million grant from the Asia Pacific Disaster Relief Fund for the first phase requirements. \n\n\f2 \n\nThe  remaining  PRs20,000  have  been  directed  at  families  with  damaged  houses.4 About  $340 \nmillion have already been disbursed by the government for this purpose (from its own budget) \nand an additional $600 million  were pledged by international donors including Italy, the United \nKingdom, the United States, and the World Bank at the Development Forum held in Islamabad \nin  December  2010.  Several  of  these  donors  (including  the  World  Bank)  are  now  close  to \ncompleting  due  diligence  work,  as  well  as fiduciary  and  fund  flow  arrangements,  in support  of \nthe program. ADB is not part of this cash transfer program but, at the time of the floods, pledged \n$2  billion  (over  a  4-year  period) to  help  with the  emergency, focusing  on restoration  of  priority \nservices and  related  infrastructure reconstruction\u2014often the more  complex  and difficult  part  of \nthe effort to finance. The World Bank pledged $1 billion. ADB also proposed the establishment \nof  a  trust  fund  to  raise  grant  money  from  donors  interested  in  the  reconstruction  phase.  ADB \nexpanded  its  Trade  Finance  Program  to  Pakistan  by  $500  million,  providing  extra  cover  to \nemergency  imports  during  the  reconstruction  period  and  beyond.  The  focus  by  ADB  on \ninfrastructure is based on the government\u2019s request, its experience and track record in this area. \nHousing, livelihoods, and other early recovery operations were to be handled by the government \nand World Bank in collaboration with other donors.   \n \n6. \nThe  third  phase  of  the  response  focuses  on  the  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of \npriority physical assets. Work is underway in all provinces but the task is well short of being fully \naccomplished.  Sindh  is,  by  far,  the  worst  affected  province,  with  Punjab  and  Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa  following  suit.  Balochistan  has  much  less  damage  than  the  others.  Fund \nmobilization and initial reconstruction, including the rebuilding of schools and medical facilities, \nare fairly advanced in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but less so in Sindh. This is mainly on \naccount  of  an  earlier  start  by  the  two  provinces  and  a  more  successful  fund-raising  program \nfrom  donors and internal  reallocation.  A  number of these donors  had a  presence  in  these  two \nprovinces  before  the  floods.  This  made  the  approval  and  channeling  of  funds  easier,  adding \nnew money via the existing programs. The scale of the damage and the corresponding financial \nburden on Sindh has been higher from the outset. While Sindh was as responsive as the other \nprovinces, its reconstruction was likely to lag because of scale and time. The floods spread into \nSindh after subsiding elsewhere. Some parts of the province still have standing water today.  \n \n7. \nFunding for the third  phase  has  become  an  issue. The  national  and provincial  budgets \nwere  tapped  to  deal  with  first,  second,  and  part  of  the  third  phase  of  the  response.  However, \nthese  budgets  are  constrained.  Third  phase  investments  are  also  more  substantial  and  take \nlonger  to  execute.  Further,  although  bilateral  agencies  were  generous  and  timely  with  their \nresponse,  most  tend  to  traditionally  focus  first  on  relief  and  early  recovery  work.  Multilateral \nbanks are traditionally more active in the longer-term reconstruction effort. However, the funding \noffered  by  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  at  the  start  of  the  disaster  was  not  taken  up  by  the \ngovernment at the time, due to two considerations: (i) priority to relief and early recovery, and (ii) \nemphasis  on  raising  as  much  new  grant  money  first  as  possible.  Although  the  decision  not  to \nproceed with multilateral bank finance has delayed third phase reconstruction work, in general \nterms,  the  response  to  the  floods  by  the  government  during  the  first  two  phases  can  be \nconsidered  responsive.  This  required  the  resources  and  time  of  many  agencies.  There  is  no \ndoubt  that  the focus  on relief  and  early  recovery  saved  many  lives.  The urgent task  now  is  to \nplan, organize, and execute well the rehabilitation and reconstruction of damaged infrastructure \nboth  in  terms  of  the  immediate  needs  of  restoring  critical  priority  infrastructure  (focus  of  the \nproject)  and  other  longer-term  reconstruction  needs.  In  this  sense,  the  emergency  situation  is \nstill very much a reality. \n \n\n                                                \n4 Although the DNA recommended PRs100,000 for each of the 1.2 million damaged or destroyed houses and higher \n\nsubsidy for another 400,000 damaged houses requiring multi-hazard resistant reconstruction. \n\n\f3 \n\n8. \nDamage  and  needs  assessment.  The  DNA  was  completed  within  three  months  by \nOctober 2010. The most immediate and medium-term requirements are estimated at just below \n$9  billion  (Table  1).  The  Council  of  Common  Interests, 5  chaired  by  the  Prime  Minister  of \nPakistan and comprising chief ministers of all provinces, approved the DNA in November 2010. \nThe  council  mandated  that  the  DNA  be  implemented  by  the  Planning  Commission  at  the \nnational  level,  and  by  planning  and  development  departments  in  provinces.  An  independent \nNational  Oversight  Disaster  Management  Council  with  representation  from  civil  society  was \ntasked with progress monitoring and reporting. Transport and irrigation combined are the largest \nitems in terms of needs (close to $3.3 billion). Housing follows with $2 billion. Education needs \nare  around  $500  million.  Agriculture  and  livelihoods  together  account  for  $1.5  billion. With  the \nexception of irrigation, the floods hit Sindh the hardest. \n \n\nTable 1: Short- and Medium-Term Reconstruction Needs in Major Sectors  \n($ million) \n \nPunjab \n\nKhyber \nPakhtunkhwa \n\n \nBalochistan \n\nOther \nRegions \n\n \nFederal \n\n \nSindh \n\n \nTotal \n\nRegion/Subsector \n\n321  \n\n443  \n\n635  \n\n1,678  \n\n2,189  \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n\n70  \n46  \n\n203  \n56  \n\n271  \n51  \n\n675  \n211  \n\n520  \n600  \n\n616  \n19  \n\n3  \n28  \n30  \n\n2,356  \n982  \n\n16  \n53  \n488  \n\n2  \n15  \n310  \n\n49  \n505  \n2,206  \n2,817  \n8,915  \n\n22  \n269  \n1,012  \n\n5  \n140  \n365  \n  \n832  \n\nTransport \nIrrigation, drainage, \nand flood sector \nHealth \nEducation \nHousing  \nOther sectors \n     Total \nSource: ADB and World Bank. 2010.

National  roads  and  bridges  were  the  worst  affected, \nfollowed  by  more  than  20%  of  the  provincial  road  network  damaged  in  Sindh  and  Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa.  About  793  kilometers  (km)  of  national  highways  (7%  of  the  network),  including \nbridges,  need  urgent  repair  to  ensure  their  stability  and  public  safety.  About  24,000  km  of \nprovincial  highways  and  many  smaller  access  roads  (representing  12%  of  the  total  provincial \nroad network) are in bad shape.  \n \nIrrigation  infrastructure.  About  90%  of  crop  production  in  the  country  is  based  on \n10. \nirrigated agriculture. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the most affected, followed by Sindh, Punjab and \nBalochistan. The damages resulted from breaches in flood embankments along the Indus River. \nIn  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa,  over  5,700  irrigation  structures  were  broken  and  a  major  headworks \nwashed away. In Sindh, the major command area was inundated, affecting water sources to 1.5 \nmillion hectares. Punjab\u2019s irrigation system damage was less extensive. However, its impact on \nthe country\u2019s overall agriculture output is substantial since Punjab accounts for 72% of the total \ncrop area and 74% of the national production.  \n \n11. \nAgriculture  and  livelihood.  Over  2.1  million  hectares  of  standing  crop  (slightly  less \nthan 10% of total cultivable land), about 1.5 million livestock and 10 million poultry perished. The \nfloods also destroyed water sources, food and seed storages. The wheat planting season was \nmissed in some parts and, for land planted, the next harvest may only be in the spring of 2012. \nWomen  earning  income  from  livestock,  harvesting  and  home-based  industries  were  badly \naffected. The agriculture sector is expected to shrink 2% in 2011. An estimated 6 million people \nare already temporarily unemployed. About 25% of the affected population is still dependent on \n\n                                                \n5  Formed  in  2010  to  coordinate  Federal-Provincial  fiscal  and  administrative  relations,  among  other  matters  of \n\ncommon interest. \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n4\n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nfood  aid.  About  1.7  million  households  with  houses  partly  or  completely  damaged  are  being \nhelped by the government. \n \n12. \nThe borrower\u2019s request. The government has requested ADB in February 2011 for an \nemergency assistance loan (EAL) with a 3-year implementation period to be completed before \nMarch 2014, for restoring priority infrastructure. The government\u2019s request was processed in 8 \nweeks, compared to 12 weeks provided for EAL processing after a disaster. ADB\u2019s Operations \nManual6 states that a proposed EAL must have an implementation period set normally up to  2 \nyears for natural disasters and may be exceptionally extended for, at most, two additional years \nwhen the level of destruction and dislocation are deemed extreme. Since the flood was one of \nthe largest in world history, the proposed 3-year project implementation period is reasonable.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe  project  impact  will  be  economic  and  social  recovery.  The  outcome  will  be  the \nrestoration  and  reconstruction  of  critical  infrastructure  to  safer  standards  to  restore  livelihoods \nand access to markets. This affects people and businesses.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs  \n\n14. \nThe project will rehabilitate and reconstruct national and provincial roads and bridges, as \nwell  as  irrigation,  flood  protection  and  drainage  infrastructure  in  the  Province  of  Sindh.  The \nfocus  by  ADB  on  these  two  areas  follows  a  government  request.  It  takes  into  account  work \nalready  underway  in  other  areas  of  the  country  and  the  finance  already  raised  from  other \ndevelopment partners. These two sectors fit well with ADB\u2019s own project experience and track \nrecord in Pakistan. The two sectors are also priorities under the country partnership strategy.7 \n \n15. \nThe project will rehabilitate or reconstruct 793 km of national highways and bridges and \n800 km of provincial roads and bridges in eight districts in Sindh\u2014where required\u2014to safer and \nbetter  standards.  These  investments  will  reestablish  interregional  connectivity.  Where  justified \nand  cost  effective,  selected  infrastructure  will  be  upgraded  to  better  standards  (build  back \nbetter).  The  project  will  improve  1.5  million  hectares  of  agricultural  land  by  restoring, \nstrengthening, and resectioning various flood protection embankments, and rehabilitating main \ncanals,  distributaries,  minor  canals  and  drainage  infrastructure.  The  National  Disaster \nManagement Authority is developing a multi-hazard risk map and related management plan. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe investment proposed under the project is estimated at $722 million.  \n\n16. \n \n\nTable 2: Indicative Sector Investment Requirements for the Project \n($ million) \n\n  \n\n Item \n\n \n\nFederal \n\nSindh \n\nTotal \n\nBase Cost \n\nIrrigation and flood infrastructure \n\nA. \n1  Roads and bridges \n \n \n2 \nSubtotal (A) \nB. \nC. \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nContingencies \nTaxes, Duties, and Financing Charges \nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n256 \n\n256 \n39 \n22 \n317 \n\n118 \n209 \n327 \n49 \n29 \n405 \n\n374 \n209 \n583 \n88 \n51 \n 722 \n\n                                                \n6 ADB. 2004.

The ordinary capital resources loan will have a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace  period  of  8  years,  an  annual  interest  charge  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15% \nper year (the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the OCR loan), \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The ADF \nloan will have an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum (interest during construction to be \ncapitalized in the ADF loan), a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years; repayment \nof  principal  at  2%  per  annum  for  the  first  10  years  after  the  grace  period  and  4%  per  annum \nthereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements.  The  government  will  contribute  $72  million  out  of  its  own  resources  towards  the \nproject to cover taxes,  duties, financing  charges and will  also finance the  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  costs.  The  ADF  loan  will  be  exclusively  used  to  finance  civil  works  under  the \nirrigation sector component in Sindh. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for \nits  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n\nTable 3: Financing Plan \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank  \n\nOrdinary capital resources loan \n\nAsian Development Fund loan \n\nFederal and provincial governments \n\n     Total \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n650 \n\n600 \n\n50 \n\n72 \n\n722 \n\n90.0 \n\n83.0 \n\n7.0 \n\n10.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n18. \nPrinciples. The project will follow five principles: speed, efficiency, building back  better \nand  safer,  transparency,  and  accountability.  The  National  Highway  Authority  (NHA)  and  the \nSindh  PDD  are  the  project  executing  agencies.  The  implementing  agencies  are  NHA  at  the \nnational level, and the Works and Service Department, and Irrigation Department of the Sindh \nProvince.  The  project  will  be  implemented  over  three  years.  Details  are  in  the  project \nadministration manual (PAM).8   \n \nSubprojects.  A  list  of  likely  subprojects  is  provided  in  the  PAM.  Each  of  these \n19. \nsubprojects will undergo extensive reviews and third party validation including technical audit for \ndesign and  construction supervision.  Criteria to be  met  include adherence to safeguards rules \nand  technical  and  economic  viability.  A  special  committee  at  each  implementing  agency  will \napprove individual subprojects. After this approval, the subprojects (including those retroactively \nfinanced)  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  post  review  in  the  case  of  contracts  costing  below  $5 \nmillion, and prior review for contracts costing above $5 million. \n \nProject management and supervision. The procurement of goods, works and services \n20. \nwill  follow  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy,  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \n                                                \n8  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n4\n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nGuidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Experience  shows  that  efficiency, \nstreamlined  decision-making,  and  sound  communications  among  all  players  are  key  success \nfactors  in  emergency  situations. The  proposed  implementation  arrangements  are  backed  by \nstrong fiduciary oversight and grievance redress mechanisms for both people and contractors. \nIndependent consultants will be hired and placed in all the implementing agencies to help with \nthis  work.  Procurement  specialists  hired  under  the  TA  for  each  implementing  agency  will  be \nrepresented  in  the  contract  awards  and  bid  approval  committees  (as  observer)  to  ensure \ntransparency.  Key  project  implementation  data  will  be  placed  in  a  dedicated  website.  The \nFederal  and  Sindh  Public  Procurement  Regulatory  Authorities  will  provide  additional \ntransparency.  Project  management  consultants  (PMCs)  will  be  appointed  to  oversee  the \npreparation  of  designs, bidding  documents,  evaluations  of  proposals, the awards,  negotiations \nand later the execution of contracts. Audits will be conducted on a regular basis. The Pakistan \nResident Mission of ADB will oversee the implementation of the emergency program and launch \nreview missions every 3 months during the first year. A project unit will be set up in the resident \nmission to help with this work. ADB headquarters staff will also monitor and support the work. \n \n21. \nThree consulting firms or consortia will be recruited to work with the three implementing \nagencies  as project management  consultant  (PMC). Their recruitment  will follow  quality-based \nselection or quality and cost-based selection methods (with a 90:10 weight between quality and \ncost).  The  PMC  will  be  awarded  part  \u2015time\u2016-  and  part  \u2015performance\u2016-based  \u2015hybrid  contracts\u2016. \nThe  project  unit  in  the  resident  mission  will  engage  individual  consultants  to  advance  project \nimplementation  work  (e.g.,  organizational  arrangements,  preparation  of  bidding  documents  for \ncontractors,  and  the  selection  of  consultant  firms  to  help  each  implementing  agency).  The \nobjective  is  to  maintain  momentum  and  be  ready  with  contract  awards  as  soon  as  possible. \nTerms of reference for experts to work in this unit are in the Technical Assistance.9 The project \nunit  will  fast-track  the  hiring  of  firms  and  individuals  by  allowing:  (i)  national  shortlists  and \nsimplified technical proposals up to $1.5 million; (ii) shortlist of three firms for contracts less than \n$0.5  million;  and  (iii)  subject  to  ADB  agreement,  single  source  selection  if  comparative \nadvantage of the firms is fully justified.  \n \n22. \nProcurement  of  works  and  goods.  Both  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  and \nnational  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures  will  be  used  to  engage  contractors  and \nsuppliers.  In  the  case  of  national  and  provincial  roads  and  irrigation,  subprojects  will  be \nconsolidated as much as possible to open the way for ICB. Smaller and dispersed subprojects \nwill be undertaken through local contractors. Bids will be invited on bill of quantities worked out \nfor  each  package  using  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  For  higher  value  and  more \nunique works (bridges), NCB will be applied, including direct contracting with ADB\u2019s agreement. \nOther  concessions  under  the  emergency  procedure  could  also  apply  mainly  to  (i)  reduce  the \nbidding period of NCB to a minimum of 14 days and ICB to a minimum of 21 days, (ii) increase \nNCB threshold to $10 million, (iii) accept insurance bonds (NCB only) and security declaration \nagainst  performance  and  bid  securities,  and  (iv)  relax  conditions  for  bidder  qualifications  and \njoint venture arrangements. Details are provided in the PAM.  \n \nAdvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing.  Advance  contracting  was  approved \n23. \nby  Management  for  works  to  ensure  serviceability  of  key  infrastructure  and  fast  track \nprequalification  of  contractors,  and  consultants  to  help  with  project  management.  Retroactive \nfinancing  will  be  allowed  with  an  overall  cap  of  30%  of  the  total  loan  and  applicable  only  to \neligible  expenditures  incurred  after  the  emergency  (7  August  2010)10 and  not  more  than  12 \n\n                                                \n9 Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10  Based on ADB\u2019s assessment of the floods and local capacity to respond to the disaster. \n\n\f7 \n\nmonths before the date of the loan agreements. Contracts subject to retroactive financing will be \nreviewed  by  ADB.  Single  bid  contracts  will  not  qualify  for  retroactive  financing.  On  an \nexceptional  basis,  ADB  will  consider  retroactive  financing  of  contracts  that,  in  addition  to  the \nselection criteria provided in the PAM, have been procured using Pakistan engineering council \ncategories  and  qualification  criteria  and  pricing  close  to  the  engineers\u2019  estimates  (details \nprovided  in  PAM).  This  arrangement  is  applicable  only  to  contracts  awarded  before  31  May \n2011  and  could  apply  to  all  implementing  agencies.  In  general,  retroactive  financing  will  be \nsubject  to  ADB  review  establishing:  (i)  the  soundness  of  the  procurement  process,  (ii)  price \nverification  of  awarded  contracts  against  market  norms,  and  (iii)  random  physical  sampling  on \nprogress.  \n \nDisbursement.  Disbursement  arrangements  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \n24. \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Imprest accounts will be opened by NHA and \nthe Works  and  Services  Department  and  Irrigation  Department  of  Sindh  under  the  OCR  loan, \nbut the maximum ceiling of these imprest accounts \"in aggregate\" will not, at any time, exceed \nthe estimated ADB-financed expenditures to be paid from the imprest account over the next  6 \nmonths period or 10% of the loan amount, whichever will be lower. A separate imprest account \nwill  be  opened  by  the  Irrigation  Department  of  Sindh  under  the  ADF  loan  to  finance  eligible \nsubprojects. Statement of expenditure procedure subject to a limit of $100,000 equivalent will be \nused  for  the  liquidation  and  replenishment  of  the  imprest  accounts,  as  well  as  for \ndisbursements. \n \n25.  Monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  executing  agencies  that  will  provide  ADB  with  (i) \nquarterly  progress  reports  in  a  format  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  reporting \nsystem,  (ii)  consolidated  financial  reports,  and  (iii)  consolidated  6  monthly  and  annual  audit \nreports.  The  executing  agencies  will  be  supported  by  consultants.  Each  executing  agency  will \nset  up  a  project  performance  monitoring  system,  similar  to  the  one  used  by  ADB.  All  project \ninformation  will  be  posted  on  websites, \nfunds  use,  audits, \nreconstruction  plans,  procurement,  contract  awards,  selection  criteria,  and  grievance  redress. \nAn ADB  inception  mission  will  be fielded  on  effectiveness, followed  by  quarterly  reviews.  ADB \nCentral  Operations  Services  Office  and  Controller\u2019s  Department  will  participate  in  these \nmissions as required. The scope of the review is provided in the PAM.  \n \n\ninformation  on \n\nincluding \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n26. \nA  capacity  development  TA  of  $4  million,  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV), is proposed. This will finance 20 person-months \nof  international  consultants  and  600  person-months  of  national11 consultants  (footnote  9).  The \nservices will first help the implementing agencies during the first 6 months of the project (ahead \nof  the  project  management  consultant  engagement).  The  overall  objective  is  to  help  (i)  key \ngovernance  functions  (monitoring,  reporting  and  evaluation,  coordination,  bidding  document \npreparation,  contracting  modalities,  contract  management  arrangements,  internal  and  external \ncommunications);  (ii)  put \nfinancial \nmanagement, information system and audit functions; and (iii) support environmental and social \nsafeguards, including assistance for developing resettlement, environmental, gender plans, and \ntheir implementation and monitoring. \n \n\nfiduciary  arrangements  comprising  sound \n\nin  place \n\n                                                \n11 The consultants will be supported by 1,000 person-months of field and support staff for data collection and surveys \n\nfinanced by the Technical Assistance.  \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n4\n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n27. \nStandard  economic  and  financial  assessments  will  be  undertaken  for  all  subprojects \nduring the implementation. All project investments are expected to be economically viable. They \nwill restore basic infrastructure and, in the process, improve the welfare of affected people and \nbusinesses. The investments will improve connectivity, as well as trade, agriculture production, \nand access to social services.   \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n28. \nFinancial  management,  control  procedures,  and  audits.  Country-level  financial \nmanagement,  accounting  and  auditing  standards  generally  meet  the  requirements  set  out  in \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects \nfinanced by ADB (2002) and Operations Manual.12 Public sector accounts are also maintained \nin  accordance  with  the  New  Accounting  Manual,  which  itself  is  compliant  with  International \nPublic  Sector  Accounting  Standards.  Project  accounts  will  be  audited  by  the  Department  of \nAuditor General of Pakistan. The Department of Auditor General of Pakistan already conducts \naudits in accordance with the auditing standards of International Organization of Supreme Audit \nInstitutions. \n \n29. \nA  financial  management  assessment  of  the  executing  agencies  and  implementing \nagencies  was  conducted.  Gaps  include  financial  reporting  and  internal  controls.  This  is \nespecially the case with provincial implementing agencies. External consultants will be engaged \nto  help  bridge  these  gaps  (terms  of  reference  shown  in  the  PAM).  The  consultants  will  also \nensure  that  proper  internal  controls  are  in  place  and  provide  monthly  internal  audits  reports. \nADB will follow up with periodic due diligence on internal controls and accounting systems at the \nlevel  of  each  implementing  agency.  This  work  will  begin  within  the  first  six  months  of  loan \neffectiveness. Individual consultants will be recruited for this purpose (footnote 8). \n \n30. \ndesign and construction supervision. \n  \n31. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998 as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  executing  agencies.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and anticorruption measures are described in the PAM. \n \n32. \nComplaints redress mechanism. The executing agencies will set up grievance redress \nmechanisms with outreach for all subprojects funded by ADB. The objective is to deal effectively \nwith  complaints  and  facilitate  access  provincial  level  ombudsmen.  Service  benchmarks  and \nprotocols  will  be  established  under  the  grievance  redress  system,  and  all  information  on  the \ncomplaints will be published on a dedicated website. \n \nC. \n\nTechnical  Audits:  All  subprojects  will  go  through  a  comprehensive  technical  audit  for \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n33. \nThe  floods  have  exacerbated  an  already  difficult  poverty  situation  in  many  parts  of \nPakistan.  The  recent  and  still  ongoing  economic  crisis  has  eroded  welfare  in  several  places. \nUnemployment  is  high  and  inflation  is  rising.  Poverty  is  likely  to  increase  because  of  floods. \nQuick  assistance  for  livelihood  restoration  is  vital  for  millions  of  affected  households.  The \nreconstruction of infrastructure can provide such lifelines. Many in isolated areas are still relying \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 2003. Project Accounting, Financial Reporting, and Auditing. Operations Manual. OM J7/BP. Manila. \n\n\f9 \n\non  airlifted  food  supplies.  The  floods  caused  a  large-scale  displacement  of  people,  and  urban \nmigration  is  likely  to  increase.  Pre-existing  gender  inequalities  have  worsened  and  will \ndeteriorate  further  unless  their  participation  in  the  reconstruction  is  ensured.  A  gender  action \nframework  was  developed  under  the  project  to  deal  with  gender  concerns.  A  summary  social \nand poverty reduction plan was prepared, highlighting project contributions to poverty reduction.  \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n34. \nEnvironment and social. The project is categorized as A for involuntary resettlement, B \nfor environment, and C for indigenous people. Based on the indicative list of subprojects, except \nfor  three  subprojects  of  national  highways,  all  reconstruction  works  are  within  existing \nalignments. Resettlement plans were not possible for a widely spread portfolio, as subprojects \nwill be confirmed during implementation. A land acquisition and resettlement framework and an \nenvironmental  assessment  review  framework  have  been  prepared.  These  comply  with  the \napplicable  national  and  provincial  laws,  and  the  regulations  extended  by  the  Pakistan \nEnvironment  Protection  Act  1997.  The  project  will  follow  strictly  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009), the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004), and other applicable \nADB  operations  manuals.  These  frameworks  describe  the  compliance  requirements.  The \nrelevant  implementing  agencies,  supported  by  expert  consultants,  are  responsible  for \ncompliance  with  these frameworks,  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  the  loan  and  project \nagreements. \n \n35. \nFor  national  roads,  the  rapid  environmental  assessment  checklist  will  be  applied  to  all \nsubprojects.  Since  the  project  is  an  EAL,  the  disclosure  requirements  for  draft  environmental \nimpact  assessments  for  subprojects  in  category  A  will  be  changed  from  the  120  days  prior  to \nADB  Board  of  Directors  approval  to  120  days  prior  to  release  of  funds  for  subproject.  This \nallows  subprojects  to  be  initiated  before  the  onset  of  the  monsoon  rains.  Due  to  the  limited \nenvironmental  impacts  in  the  irrigation  and  transport  sectors,  the  environmental  assessment \nand  review  framework  includes  a  sector  approach  to  the  preparation  of  initial  environmental \nexaminations.  This  approach  ensures  a  faster  approval  without  compromising  compliance \nstandards.  An  environmental  management  plan  will  be  prepared  for  each  subproject  including \nregular inspections by ADB. \n \nGender. Social and gender development consultants will be hired to implement a gender \n36. \naction  framework.  Separate  gender  action  plans  will  be  prepared  for  subprojects  with  gender \nmainstreaming content. The consultants will also design a livelihoods program for communities \nand a gender-sensitive grievance mechanism with outreach to women groups, including through \nthe  federal  ombudsman.  The  social  and  gender  consultants  working  with  the  provincial \nauthorities  will  facilitate  the  implementation  and  monitoring  of  these  gender  action  plans.  The \ngender  specialist  based  at  the  resident  mission  will  assist  with  the  gender  mainstreaming  and \nmonitoring under the project. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan13 provides  details  on  key  risks.  The \n37. \nmost important risk is inadequate leadership and poor organization of the reconstruction work. \nAnother  risk  is  low  fiduciary  oversight.  There  is  also  a  risk  of  poor  contractor  performance. \nLeadership and organizational problems are mitigated through the involvement of experienced \nagencies and the deployment of international and local project management advisors. ADB has \nlearned lessons from the earthquake reconstruction of 2005 and the project design incorporates \nmany  of these. The  preparatory  work  related  to contractor  bids  and  contract  awards  are  to  be \n                                                \n13 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n4\n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nsupported  by  PMC.  Governance  and  fiduciary  risks  will  be  contained  through  the  strong \ncommitment  of  national  and  provincial  agencies,  as  well  as  close  involvement  and  review  by \nADB of contracts as described in the loan agreement. Close oversight on contract performance \nwill  be  kept  with  quarterly  review  missions.  Measures  also  include  placement  of  TA-financed \nprocurement  specialists  on  each  procurement  committee  as  observers.  To  ensure  proper \ninternal  controls  in  each  implementing  agency,  an  independent  internal  audit  review  and \nreporting will be carried out by individual consultants hired under the TA. All information on the \nproject, including matters on governance and safeguards compliance, as well as all complaints \nfrom  affected  people  and  contractors,  will  be  published  on  websites  and  addressed  through  a \ndedicated  grievance  redress  mechanism.  Contractor  performance  risks  are  to  be  mitigated  by \nthe inclusion of sizable penalties.   \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n38. \nThe government has assured ADB that the implementation of the project will conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  and  procedures,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  safeguard  frameworks,  social  and  gender, \nprocurement, financial management, and disbursement. The government has agreed with ADB \non covenants set out in the loan and project agreements. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n39. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  loan  of  $600,000,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Flood \nEmergency  Reconstruction  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with \ninterest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board; \n \nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR31,704,000  to  the  Islamic \nRepublic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Flood  Emergency  Reconstruction  Project  from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1%  per \nannum;  for  a  term  of  40  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  10  years  with \nrepayment  of  principal  at  2%  per  annum  for  the  first  10  years  after  the  grace \nperiod and 4% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements presented to the Board; and \n \nthe provision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $4,000,000 \nto the Government of Pakistan for the Capacity Building for the Flood Emergency \nReconstruction Project as described in paragraph 26 above. \n\nC.
