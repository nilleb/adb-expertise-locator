I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) proposed \nloans to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Flood Emergency Reconstruction Project, and \n(ii)  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  for  the  Flood  Emergency \nReconstruction Project.1  \n \n2.  The project will finance the rehabilitation and reconstruction of facilities damaged during \nthe floods in mid-2010. The reconstruction targets transport (roads and bridges) and irrigation \nfacilities, including drainage and flood protection. The project follows priorities described in a \ndamage and needs assessment report (DNA)2 prepared by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand the World Bank in 2010, in close coordination with federal and provincial government \nagencies and several development partners (including agencies from the European Union, \nGermany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). The project is aligned with the \nflood reconstruction plan recently prepared by the Planning Commission. The project focuses \non the transitional phase of emergency response for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of \npriority infrastructure.  \n \nII.  THE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Damage. The floods of mid-2010 affected 20 million people and caused 1,600 deaths. \nBasic transport infrastructure and irrigation facilities were badly damaged. The same happened \nto health and education centers, housing, agriculture, livestock, fisheries and livelihoods. Eighty \nof  the  110  districts  across  Balochistan,  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa,  Punjab,  and  Sindh  were  all \nseriously  affected.  About  one  fifth  of  the  country  was  under  floods.  The  total  damage  is \nestimated at $10 billion.  \n \n4.  Government\u2019s response. The government\u2019s response followed three phases: (i) rescue \nand relief, (ii) early recovery (temporary restoration), and (iii) reconstruction and rehabilitation. \nThe first phase was handled by national agencies. The work was swift and well-coordinated, \nespecially by the National Disaster Management Authority. External assistance (financial and in-\nkind) was mobilized quickly and from a wide range of sources,3 including the United Nations \n(UN) and leading nongovernment organizations. The UN launched a $2-billion appeal, raising \n$1.3 billion. This first phase of the response is now practically over with most of the affected \npeople back in their villages, except small pockets of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and parts of Sindh.  \n \n5.  Early recovery phase started immediately after the floods subsided. The government\u2019s \nplan was to quickly and effectively restore services, and provide temporary housing and grants \nfor restoring agriculture and basic livelihoods. This second phase involved federal and provincial \ngovernments and major national organizations, including those from the private sector. The \nscale of work delayed the permanent reconstruction works (third phase) but this was necessary \nand inevitable. The early recovery response was structured primarily on an unconditional cash \ntransfer program targeting some 20 million people displaced by floods. This program was \ncomplemented  by  an  appeal  to  international  donors  to  extend  new  or  additional  financial \nresources in the form of grants, channeled through the national budget. The objective was to \nreact quickly through quick-disbursing facilities. The support under the program itself amounts to \nPRs40,000 per family, with a first tranche of PRs20,000 made available soon after the floods. \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 ADB and World Bank. 2010. Pakistan Floods 2010: Preliminary Damage and Needs Assessment. Islamabad. \n3 ADB provided a $3 million grant from the Asia Pacific Disaster Relief Fund for the first phase requirements. ", "2 \nThe remaining PRs20,000 have been directed at families with damaged houses.4 About $340 \nmillion have already been disbursed by the government for this purpose (from its own budget) \nand an additional $600 million were pledged by international donors including Italy, the United \nKingdom, the United States, and the World Bank at the Development Forum held in Islamabad \nin December 2010. Several of these donors (including the World Bank) are now close to \ncompleting due diligence work, as well as fiduciary and fund flow arrangements, in support of \nthe program. ADB is not part of this cash transfer program but, at the time of the floods, pledged \n$2 billion (over a 4-year period) to help with the emergency, focusing on restoration of priority \nservices and related infrastructure reconstruction\u2014often the more complex and difficult part of \nthe effort to finance. The World Bank pledged $1 billion. ADB also proposed the establishment \nof a trust fund to raise grant money from donors interested in the reconstruction phase. ADB \nexpanded its Trade Finance Program to Pakistan by $500 million, providing extra cover to \nemergency  imports  during  the  reconstruction  period  and  beyond.  The  focus  by  ADB  on \ninfrastructure is based on the government\u2019s request, its experience and track record in this area. \nHousing, livelihoods, and other early recovery operations were to be handled by the government \nand World Bank in collaboration with other donors.   \n \n6.  The third phase of the response focuses on the reconstruction and rehabilitation of \npriority physical assets. Work is underway in all provinces but the task is well short of being fully \naccomplished.  Sindh  is,  by  far,  the  worst  affected  province,  with  Punjab  and  Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa  following  suit.  Balochistan  has  much  less  damage  than  the  others.  Fund \nmobilization and initial reconstruction, including the rebuilding of schools and medical facilities, \nare fairly advanced in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but less so in Sindh. This is mainly on \naccount of an earlier start by the two provinces and a more successful fund-raising program \nfrom donors and internal reallocation. A number of these donors had a presence in these two \nprovinces before the floods. This made the approval and channeling of funds easier, adding \nnew money via the existing programs. The scale of the damage and the corresponding financial \nburden on Sindh has been higher from the outset. While Sindh was as responsive as the other \nprovinces, its reconstruction was likely to lag because of scale and time. The floods spread into \nSindh after subsiding elsewhere. Some parts of the province still have standing water today.  \n \n7.  Funding for the third phase has become an issue. The national and provincial budgets \nwere tapped to deal with first, second, and part of the third phase of the response. However, \nthese budgets are constrained. Third phase investments are also more substantial and take \nlonger to execute. Further, although bilateral agencies were generous and timely with their \nresponse, most tend to traditionally focus first on relief and early recovery work. Multilateral \nbanks are traditionally more active in the longer-term reconstruction effort. However, the funding \noffered by ADB and the World Bank at the start of the disaster was not taken up by the \ngovernment at the time, due to two considerations: (i) priority to relief and early recovery, and (ii) \nemphasis on raising as much new grant money first as possible. Although the decision not to \nproceed with multilateral bank finance has delayed third phase reconstruction work, in general \nterms,  the  response  to  the  floods  by  the  government  during  the  first  two  phases  can  be \nconsidered responsive. This required the resources and time of many agencies. There is no \ndoubt that the focus on relief and early recovery saved many lives. The urgent task now is to \nplan, organize, and execute well the rehabilitation and reconstruction of damaged infrastructure \nboth in terms of the immediate needs of restoring critical priority infrastructure (focus of the \nproject) and other longer-term reconstruction needs. In this sense, the emergency situation is \nstill very much a reality. \n \n                                                \n4 Although the DNA recommended PRs100,000 for each of the 1.2 million damaged or destroyed houses and higher \nsubsidy for another 400,000 damaged houses requiring multi-hazard resistant reconstruction. ", "3 \n8.  Damage and needs assessment. The DNA was completed within three months by \nOctober 2010. The most immediate and medium-term requirements are estimated at just below \n$9  billion  (Table  1).  The  Council  of  Common  Interests,5 chaired  by  the  Prime  Minister  of \nPakistan and comprising chief ministers of all provinces, approved the DNA in November 2010. \nThe  council  mandated that the  DNA  be  implemented  by  the  Planning  Commission  at the \nnational level, and by planning and development departments in provinces. An independent \nNational Oversight Disaster Management Council with representation from civil society was \ntasked with progress monitoring and reporting. Transport and irrigation combined are the largest \nitems in terms of needs (close to $3.3 billion). Housing follows with $2 billion. Education needs \nare around $500 million. Agriculture and livelihoods together account for $1.5 billion. With the \nexception of irrigation, the floods hit Sindh the hardest. \n \nTable 1: Short- and Medium-Term Reconstruction Needs in Major Sectors  \n($ million) \nRegion/Subsector    Khyber        Other   \nFederal  Pakhtunkhwa  Punjab  Sindh  Balochistan  Regions  Total \nTransport  616   520   271   675   70   203   2,356  \nIrrigation, drainage,  19   600   51   211   46   56   982  \nand flood sector \nHealth  0  16   5   22   2   3   49  \nEducation  0  53   140   269   15   28   505  \nHousing   0  488   365   1,012   310   30   2,206  \nOther sectors     2,817  \n     Total  635   1,678   832   2,189   443   321   8,915  \nSource: ADB and World Bank. 2010.

National roads and bridges were the worst affected, \nfollowed by more than 20% of the provincial road network damaged in Sindh and Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa. About 793 kilometers (km) of national highways (7% of the network), including \nbridges, need urgent repair to ensure their stability and public safety. About 24,000 km of \nprovincial highways and many smaller access roads (representing 12% of the total provincial \nroad network) are in bad shape.   A\np\n  p\ne\n10.  Irrigation infrastructure. About 90% of crop production in the country is based on  n\nd\nirrigated agriculture. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the most affected, followed by Sindh, Punjab and  4ix \nBalochistan. The damages resulted from breaches in flood embankments along the Indus River.   \nIn Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, over 5,700 irrigation structures were broken and a major headworks \nwashed away. In Sindh, the major command area was inundated, affecting water sources to 1.5  3\n \nmillion hectares. Punjab\u2019s irrigation system damage was less extensive. However, its impact on \nthe country\u2019s overall agriculture output is substantial since Punjab accounts for 72% of the total \ncrop area and 74% of the national production.  \n \n11.  Agriculture and livelihood. Over 2.1 million hectares of standing crop (slightly less \nthan 10% of total cultivable land), about 1.5 million livestock and 10 million poultry perished. The \nfloods also destroyed water sources, food and seed storages. The wheat planting season was \nmissed in some parts and, for land planted, the next harvest may only be in the spring of 2012. \nWomen  earning  income  from  livestock,  harvesting  and  home-based  industries  were  badly \naffected. The agriculture sector is expected to shrink 2% in 2011. An estimated 6 million people \nare already temporarily unemployed. About 25% of the affected population is still dependent on \n                                                \n5 Formed in 2010 to coordinate Federal-Provincial fiscal and administrative relations, among other matters of \ncommon interest. \n ", "4 \nfood aid. About 1.7 million households with houses partly or completely damaged are being \nhelped by the government. \n \n12.  The borrower\u2019s request. The government has requested ADB in February 2011 for an \nemergency assistance loan (EAL) with a 3-year implementation period to be completed before \nMarch 2014, for restoring priority infrastructure. The government\u2019s request was processed in 8 \nweeks, compared to 12 weeks provided for EAL processing after a disaster. ADB\u2019s Operations \nManual6 states that a proposed EAL must have an implementation period set normally up to 2 \nyears for natural disasters and may be exceptionally extended for, at most, two additional years \nwhen the level of destruction and dislocation are deemed extreme. Since the flood was one of \nthe largest in world history, the proposed 3-year project implementation period is reasonable.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The project impact will be economic and social recovery. The outcome will be the \nrestoration and reconstruction of critical infrastructure to safer standards to restore livelihoods \nand access to markets. This affects people and businesses.  \n \nC.  Outputs  \n14.  The project will rehabilitate and reconstruct national and provincial roads and bridges, as \nwell as irrigation, flood protection and drainage infrastructure in the Province of Sindh. The \nfocus by ADB on these two areas follows a government request. It takes into account work \nalready underway in other areas of the country and the finance already raised from other \ndevelopment partners. These two sectors fit well with ADB\u2019s own project experience and track \nrecord in Pakistan. The two sectors are also priorities under the country partnership strategy.7 \n \n15.  The project will rehabilitate or reconstruct 793 km of national highways and bridges and \n800 km of provincial roads and bridges in eight districts in Sindh\u2014where required\u2014to safer and \nbetter standards. These investments will reestablish interregional connectivity. Where justified \nand cost effective, selected infrastructure will be upgraded to better standards (build back \nbetter).  The  project  will  improve  1.5  million  hectares  of  agricultural  land  by  restoring, \nstrengthening, and resectioning various flood protection embankments, and rehabilitating main \ncanals,  distributaries,  minor  canals  and  drainage  infrastructure.  The  National  Disaster \nManagement Authority is developing a multi-hazard risk map and related management plan. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n16.

The government has requested (i) a loan of $600 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources (OCR), and (ii) a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR 31,704,000 (equivalent \nto $50 million) from ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources (Asian Development Fund [ADF]) to help \nfinance the project. The ordinary capital resources loan will have a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace  period  of  8  years,  an  annual  interest  charge  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% \nper year (the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the OCR loan), \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The ADF \nloan will have an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum (interest during construction to be \ncapitalized in the ADF loan), a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years; repayment \nof principal at 2% per annum for the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% per annum \nthereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements. The government will contribute $72 million out of its own resources towards the \nproject to cover taxes, duties, financing charges and will also finance the land acquisition and \nresettlement costs. The ADF loan will be exclusively used to finance civil works under the \nirrigation sector component in Sindh. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for \nits decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \nTable 3: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource \n($ million)    (%) \nAsian Development Bank   650    90.0 \nOrdinary capital resources loan  600    83.0 \nAsian Development Fund loan  50    7.0 \nFederal and provincial governments  72    10.0 \n     Total  722    100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nA\n  p\np\nE.  Implementation Arrangements  e\nn\nd\nix\n18.  Principles. The project will follow five principles: speed, efficiency, building back better  4 \n \nand safer, transparency, and accountability. The National Highway Authority (NHA) and the \nSindh PDD are the project executing agencies. The implementing agencies are NHA at the \n5\nnational level, and the Works and Service Department, and Irrigation Department of the Sindh   \nProvince.  The  project  will  be  implemented  over  three  years.  Details  are  in  the  project \nadministration manual (PAM).8   \n \n19.  Subprojects.  A  list  of  likely  subprojects  is  provided  in  the  PAM.  Each  of  these \nsubprojects will undergo extensive reviews and third party validation including technical audit for \ndesign and construction supervision. Criteria to be met include adherence to safeguards rules \nand technical and economic viability. A special committee at each implementing agency will \napprove individual subprojects. After this approval, the subprojects (including those retroactively \nfinanced) will be submitted to ADB for post review in the case of contracts costing below $5 \nmillion, and prior review for contracts costing above $5 million. \n \n20.  Project management and supervision. The procurement of goods, works and services \nwill follow ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, as well as ADB\u2019s Procurement \n                                                \n8  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nGuidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Experience  shows  that  efficiency, \nstreamlined decision-making, and sound communications among all players are key success \nfactors in emergency situations. The proposed implementation arrangements are backed by \nstrong fiduciary oversight and grievance redress mechanisms for both people and contractors. \nIndependent consultants will be hired and placed in all the implementing agencies to help with \nthis work. Procurement specialists hired under the TA for each implementing agency will be \nrepresented  in  the  contract  awards  and  bid  approval  committees  (as  observer)  to  ensure \ntransparency. Key project implementation data will be placed in a dedicated website. The \nFederal  and  Sindh  Public  Procurement  Regulatory  Authorities  will  provide  additional \ntransparency.  Project  management  consultants  (PMCs)  will  be  appointed  to  oversee  the \npreparation of designs, bidding documents, evaluations of proposals, the awards, negotiations \nand later the execution of contracts. Audits will be conducted on a regular basis. The Pakistan \nResident Mission of ADB will oversee the implementation of the emergency program and launch \nreview missions every 3 months during the first year. A project unit will be set up in the resident \nmission to help with this work. ADB headquarters staff will also monitor and support the work. \n \n21.  Three consulting firms or consortia will be recruited to work with the three implementing \nagencies as project management consultant (PMC). Their recruitment will follow quality-based \nselection or quality and cost-based selection methods (with a 90:10 weight between quality and \ncost). The PMC will be awarded part \u2015time\u2016- and part \u2015performance\u2016-based \u2015hybrid contracts\u2016. \nThe project unit in the resident mission will engage individual consultants to advance project \nimplementation work (e.g., organizational arrangements, preparation of bidding documents for \ncontractors, and the selection of consultant firms to help each implementing agency). The \nobjective is to maintain momentum and be ready with contract awards as soon as possible. \nTerms of reference for experts to work in this unit are in the Technical Assistance.9 The project \nunit will fast-track the hiring of firms and individuals by allowing: (i) national shortlists and \nsimplified technical proposals up to $1.5 million; (ii) shortlist of three firms for contracts less than \n$0.5  million;  and  (iii)  subject  to  ADB  agreement,  single  source  selection  if  comparative \nadvantage of the firms is fully justified.  \n \n22.  Procurement of works and goods. Both international competitive bidding (ICB) and \nnational  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures  will  be  used  to  engage  contractors  and \nsuppliers.  In  the  case  of  national  and  provincial  roads  and  irrigation,  subprojects  will  be \nconsolidated as much as possible to open the way for ICB. Smaller and dispersed subprojects \nwill be undertaken through local contractors. Bids will be invited on bill of quantities worked out \nfor each package using bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. For higher value and more \nunique works (bridges), NCB will be applied, including direct contracting with ADB\u2019s agreement. \nOther concessions under the emergency procedure could also apply mainly to (i) reduce the \nbidding period of NCB to a minimum of 14 days and ICB to a minimum of 21 days, (ii) increase \nNCB threshold to $10 million, (iii) accept insurance bonds (NCB only) and security declaration \nagainst performance and bid securities, and (iv) relax conditions for bidder qualifications and \njoint venture arrangements. Details are provided in the PAM.  \n \n23.  Advance contracting and retroactive financing. Advance contracting was approved \nby  Management  for  works  to  ensure  serviceability  of  key  infrastructure  and  fast  track \nprequalification of contractors, and consultants to help with project management. Retroactive \nfinancing will be allowed with an overall cap of 30% of the total loan and applicable only to \neligible expenditures incurred after the emergency (7 August 2010)10 and not more than 12 \n                                                \n9 Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10  Based on ADB\u2019s assessment of the floods and local capacity to respond to the disaster. ", "7 \nmonths before the date of the loan agreements. Contracts subject to retroactive financing will be \nreviewed  by  ADB.  Single  bid  contracts  will  not  qualify  for  retroactive  financing.  On  an \nexceptional basis, ADB will consider retroactive financing of contracts that, in addition to the \nselection criteria provided in the PAM, have been procured using Pakistan engineering council \ncategories  and  qualification  criteria  and  pricing  close  to  the  engineers\u2019  estimates  (details \nprovided in PAM). This arrangement is applicable only to contracts awarded before 31 May \n2011 and could apply to all implementing agencies. In general, retroactive financing will be \nsubject to ADB review establishing: (i) the soundness of the procurement process, (ii) price \nverification of awarded contracts against market norms, and (iii) random physical sampling on \nprogress.  \n \n24.  Disbursement.  Disbursement  arrangements  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Imprest accounts will be opened by NHA and \nthe Works and Services Department and Irrigation Department of Sindh under the OCR loan, \nbut the maximum ceiling of these imprest accounts \"in aggregate\" will not, at any time, exceed \nthe estimated ADB-financed expenditures to be paid from the imprest account over the next 6 \nmonths period or 10% of the loan amount, whichever will be lower. A separate imprest account \nwill be opened by the Irrigation Department of Sindh under the ADF loan to finance eligible \nsubprojects. Statement of expenditure procedure subject to a limit of $100,000 equivalent will be \nused  for  the  liquidation  and  replenishment  of  the  imprest  accounts,  as  well  as  for \ndisbursements. \n \n25.  Monitoring  and  evaluation. The executing agencies that will provide ADB with (i) \nquarterly progress reports in a format consistent with ADB\u2019s project performance reporting \nsystem, (ii) consolidated financial reports, and (iii) consolidated 6 monthly and annual audit \nreports. The executing agencies will be supported by consultants. Each executing agency will \nset up a project performance monitoring system, similar to the one used by ADB. All project \ninformation  will  be  posted  on  websites,  including  information  on  funds  use,  audits, \nreconstruction plans, procurement, contract awards, selection criteria, and grievance redress. \nAn ADB inception mission will be fielded on effectiveness, followed by quarterly reviews. ADB \nCentral  Operations  Services  Office  and  Controller\u2019s  Department  will  participate  in  these \nA\nmissions as required. The scope of the review is provided in the PAM.   p\np\ne\n  n\nd\nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  ix\n4 \n \n26.  A capacity development TA of $4 million, to be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV), is proposed. This will finance 20 person-months  7\n \nof international consultants and 600 person-months of national11 consultants (footnote 9). The \nservices will first help the implementing agencies during the first 6 months of the project (ahead \nof the project management consultant engagement). The overall objective is to help (i) key \ngovernance functions (monitoring, reporting and evaluation, coordination, bidding document \npreparation, contracting modalities, contract management arrangements, internal and external \ncommunications);  (ii)  put  in  place  fiduciary  arrangements  comprising  sound  financial \nmanagement, information system and audit functions; and (iii) support environmental and social \nsafeguards, including assistance for developing resettlement, environmental, gender plans, and \ntheir implementation and monitoring. \n \n                                                \n11 The consultants will be supported by 1,000 person-months of field and support staff for data collection and surveys \nfinanced by the Technical Assistance.  \n ", "8 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n27.  Standard economic and financial assessments will be undertaken for all subprojects \nduring the implementation. All project investments are expected to be economically viable. They \nwill restore basic infrastructure and, in the process, improve the welfare of affected people and \nbusinesses. The investments will improve connectivity, as well as trade, agriculture production, \nand access to social services.   \n \nB.  Governance \n28.  Financial  management,  control  procedures,  and  audits.  Country-level  financial \nmanagement, accounting and auditing standards generally meet the requirements set out in \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects \nfinanced by ADB (2002) and Operations Manual.12 Public sector accounts are also maintained \nin accordance with the New Accounting Manual, which itself is compliant with International \nPublic Sector Accounting Standards. Project accounts will be audited by the Department of \nAuditor General of Pakistan. The Department of Auditor General of Pakistan already conducts \naudits in accordance with the auditing standards of International Organization of Supreme Audit \nInstitutions. \n \n29.  A  financial  management  assessment  of  the  executing  agencies  and  implementing \nagencies  was  conducted.  Gaps  include  financial  reporting  and  internal  controls.  This  is \nespecially the case with provincial implementing agencies. External consultants will be engaged \nto help bridge these gaps (terms of reference shown in the PAM). The consultants will also \nensure that proper internal controls are in place and provide monthly internal audits reports. \nADB will follow up with periodic due diligence on internal controls and accounting systems at the \nlevel of each implementing agency. This work will begin within the first six months of loan \neffectiveness. Individual consultants will be recruited for this purpose (footnote 8). \n \n30.  Technical Audits: All subprojects will go through a comprehensive technical audit for \ndesign and construction supervision. \n  \n31.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998 as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  executing  agencies.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and anticorruption measures are described in the PAM. \n \n32.  Complaints redress mechanism. The executing agencies will set up grievance redress \nmechanisms with outreach for all subprojects funded by ADB. The objective is to deal effectively \nwith complaints and facilitate access provincial level ombudsmen. Service benchmarks and \nprotocols will be established under the grievance redress system, and all information on the \ncomplaints will be published on a dedicated website. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n33.  The floods have exacerbated an already difficult poverty situation in many parts of \nPakistan. The recent and still ongoing economic crisis has eroded welfare in several places. \nUnemployment is high and inflation is rising. Poverty is likely to increase because of floods. \nQuick  assistance  for  livelihood  restoration  is  vital  for  millions  of  affected  households.  The \nreconstruction of infrastructure can provide such lifelines. Many in isolated areas are still relying \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2003. Project Accounting, Financial Reporting, and Auditing. Operations Manual. OM J7/BP. Manila. ", "9 \non airlifted food supplies. The floods caused a large-scale displacement of people, and urban \nmigration  is  likely  to  increase.  Pre-existing  gender  inequalities  have  worsened  and  will \ndeteriorate further unless their participation in the reconstruction is ensured. A gender action \nframework was developed under the project to deal with gender concerns. A summary social \nand poverty reduction plan was prepared, highlighting project contributions to poverty reduction.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n34.  Environment and social. The project is categorized as A for involuntary resettlement, B \nfor environment, and C for indigenous people. Based on the indicative list of subprojects, except \nfor  three  subprojects  of  national  highways,  all  reconstruction  works  are  within  existing \nalignments. Resettlement plans were not possible for a widely spread portfolio, as subprojects \nwill be confirmed during implementation. A land acquisition and resettlement framework and an \nenvironmental  assessment  review  framework  have  been  prepared.  These  comply  with  the \napplicable  national  and  provincial  laws,  and  the  regulations  extended  by  the  Pakistan \nEnvironment  Protection  Act  1997.  The  project  will  follow  strictly  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009), the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004), and other applicable \nADB  operations  manuals.  These  frameworks  describe  the  compliance  requirements.  The \nrelevant  implementing  agencies,  supported  by  expert  consultants,  are  responsible  for \ncompliance with these frameworks, the Safeguard Policy Statement, and the loan and project \nagreements. \n \n35.  For national roads, the rapid environmental assessment checklist will be applied to all \nsubprojects. Since the project is an EAL, the disclosure requirements for draft environmental \nimpact assessments for subprojects in category A will be changed from the 120 days prior to \nADB Board of Directors approval to 120 days prior to release of funds for subproject. This \nallows subprojects to be initiated before the onset of the monsoon rains. Due to the limited \nenvironmental impacts in the irrigation and transport sectors, the environmental assessment \nand review framework includes a sector approach to the preparation of initial environmental \nexaminations.  This  approach  ensures  a  faster  approval  without  compromising  compliance \nstandards. An environmental management plan will be prepared for each subproject including \nA\nregular inspections by ADB.  p\np\n  e\nn\n36.  Gender. Social and gender development consultants will be hired to implement a gender  dix\naction framework. Separate gender action plans will be prepared for subprojects with gender  4 \n \nmainstreaming content. The consultants will also design a livelihoods program for communities \nand a gender-sensitive grievance mechanism with outreach to women groups, including through \n9\nthe  federal  ombudsman.  The  social  and  gender  consultants  working  with  the  provincial   \nauthorities will facilitate the implementation and monitoring of these gender action plans. The \ngender specialist based at the resident mission will assist with the gender mainstreaming and \nmonitoring under the project. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n37.  The risk assessment and risk management plan13 provides details on key risks. The \nmost important risk is inadequate leadership and poor organization of the reconstruction work. \nAnother risk is low fiduciary oversight. There is also a risk of poor contractor performance. \nLeadership and organizational problems are mitigated through the involvement of experienced \nagencies and the deployment of international and local project management advisors. ADB has \nlearned lessons from the earthquake reconstruction of 2005 and the project design incorporates \nmany of these. The preparatory work related to contractor bids and contract awards are to be \n                                                \n13 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nsupported  by  PMC.  Governance  and  fiduciary  risks  will  be  contained  through  the  strong \ncommitment of national and provincial agencies, as well as close involvement and review by \nADB of contracts as described in the loan agreement. Close oversight on contract performance \nwill be kept with quarterly review missions. Measures also include placement of TA-financed \nprocurement  specialists  on  each  procurement  committee  as  observers.  To  ensure  proper \ninternal  controls  in  each  implementing  agency,  an  independent  internal  audit  review  and \nreporting will be carried out by individual consultants hired under the TA. All information on the \nproject, including matters on governance and safeguards compliance, as well as all complaints \nfrom affected people and contractors, will be published on websites and addressed through a \ndedicated grievance redress mechanism. Contractor performance risks are to be mitigated by \nthe inclusion of sizable penalties.   \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n38.  The government has assured ADB that the implementation of the project will conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  and  procedures,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures, the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), safeguard frameworks, social and gender, \nprocurement, financial management, and disbursement. The government has agreed with ADB \non covenants set out in the loan and project agreements. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, under the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove \n \n(i)  the  loan  of  $600,000,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Flood \nEmergency Reconstruction Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 32 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board; \n \n(ii)  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR31,704,000  to  the  Islamic \nRepublic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Flood  Emergency  Reconstruction  Project  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per \nannum;  for  a  term  of  40  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  10  years  with \nrepayment of principal at 2% per annum for the first 10 years after the grace \nperiod and 4% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements presented to the Board; and \n \n(iii)  the provision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $4,000,000 \nto the Government of Pakistan for the Capacity Building for the Flood Emergency \nReconstruction Project as described in paragraph 26 above. \n \nC.
