Overall \npoverty  rates  average  about  27%,  but  are  considerably  higher  in  more  isolated  areas,  where \npoverty  levels  may  be  50%\u201360%.  One  of  the  main  reasons  for  these  high  levels  of  poverty  is \nlimited  access  to  productive  assets  and  infrastructure  (such  as  irrigation  water  systems),  and \nphysical  isolation.  The  project  will  focus  on  improving  small-  to  medium-scale  irrigation  and/or \ndrainage systems, rural roads, and district and commune markets. The project will include 40\u2013\n45  subprojects.  Rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  rural  infrastructure  is  expected  to  have  a \npositive impact on the lives and livelihoods of the population in the project area, providing easier \naccess to inputs (including irrigation water), markets, health services, higher levels of education, \nand employment opportunities, while reducing production and marketing costs.3  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \nThe majority (84%) of the population of the northern mountain provinces live in sparsely \n3. \npopulated  villages,  dispersed  where  land  is  suitable  for  agriculture.  The  incidence  of  poverty \nremains  consistently  higher  than  in  other  parts  of  Viet  Nam.  While  poverty  has  been  reduced \nnationwide, from 28.9% in 2002 to 16.0% in 2006, and 11.0% in 2008, equivalent figures in the \nnorthern  mountain  provinces  were  47.9%  in  2002,  32.3%  in  2006,  and  27.0%  in  2008.  These \nfigures  reflect  the  more  difficult  environment  and  terrain,  and  the  lack  of  commercial \nopportunities, arable land, and water resources. Poverty rates among some ethnic minorities in \nthe  project  area  are  70%\u201380%  due  to  lower  levels  of  access  to  rural  infrastructure,  limited \nopportunities  for  commercial  activity,  relatively  lower  education  and  skill  levels,  and  low \npopulation densities. \n \n4. \nThe  15  northern  provinces  are  comparatively  underdeveloped  in  national  terms;  this  is \nreflected  in  the  physical  infrastructure.  While  the  government  and  international  development \npartners  have  invested  in  rural  infrastructure  since  1995,  a  huge  backlog  of  unimproved \ninfrastructure  remains.  Much  of  the  existing  infrastructure  is  in  poor  condition  due  to  age, \ninadequate design and construction, and insufficient maintenance. Nationwide, only two- thirds \nof  the  3  million  ha  provided  with  irrigation  facilities  is  currently  being  irrigated.    In  the  project \narea, irrigation schemes supporting over 200,000 ha are in need of rehabilitation. Within these \nschemes, of the 50,000 kilometers (km) of primary and secondary irrigation canals, only 16,270 \nkm  or  32%  are  lined,  leaving  the  majority  in  need  of  lining  to  reduce  water  loss.  Improving \nirrigation  water  management  is  critical  to  food  security  in  the  face  of  increased  food  demands \nand the effects of climate change. \n \nIn  the  case of  rural  roads,  only  11.0%  in  the  Northeast  and  6.6%  in  the  Northwest  are \n5. \neither concrete-surfaced or sealed. This compares with 44.5% in the more developed region of \nthe  Red  River  Delta  and  28.0%  in  the  South  Central  Coastal  region.  The  north  has \n\n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The provinces are: Bac Giang, Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Dien Bien, Ha Giang, Hoa Binh, Lai Chau, Lang Son, Lao Cai, \n\nPhu Tho, Son La, Thai Nguyen, Tuyen Quang, Vinh Phuc, and Yen Bai. \n\n3   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\nleading \n\ninvestments \n\nterrains,  where \n\ntheir  deterioration \n\nincomes.  However, \n\nthereby  enhancing  household \n\npredominantly  earth  and  gravel  roads,  which  are  particularly  unsustainable  in  hilly  and \nto \nintense  rainfall  accelerates \nmountainous \nunaffordably high maintenance and repair costs. Furthermore, the distances faced by northern \ncommunities to the nearest all-weather road are much higher than elsewhere, averaging 4.4 km \nin  comparison  to  1.7  km  in  the  Red  River  Delta.  Distances  are  a  key  obstacle  to  accessing  a \nrange  of  services,  including  health  services.  For  example  only  23%  of  communities  in  the \nNorthwest  have  access  to  a  doctor  compared  with  a  national  average  of  60%.  The  quality  of \ntransport  infrastructure  is  crucial  to  reaching  medical  attention,  an  especially  important \nconsideration for the welfare of women and children. \n \n6. \nIn this environment, rural infrastructure is not only a necessary prerequisite to stimulate \nprivate  investment  but  it  provides  a  foundation  for  rural  development.  Irrigation  development \nenhances  agricultural  productivity  and  provides  options  for  farmers  to  diversify  production  into \nin \nhigher-value  goods, \nagriculture  leading  to  surpluses  will  not  be  made  if  the  produce  cannot  be  cost-effectively \nmoved.  Rural roads enhance access to markets, commercial opportunities, and input supplies \nfor  agricultural  production,  while  also  providing  access  to  education  and  health  services. \nFurthermore, many members of northern farming households are seeking off-farm employment \nto offset the cyclical costs and unpredictable returns of farming. Access to off-farm employment \nopportunities also requires good transport facilities.  \n \nThe government\u2019s draft socioeconomic development plan 2011\u20132016 indicates the intent \n7. \nto  prioritize  upgrading  rural  infrastructure  to  serve  the  dual  objective  of  social  and  economic \ndevelopment. This includes upgrading irrigation for water supplies, aquaculture, double cropping \nin paddy areas, and the expansion of irrigated areas for cash crops. It also includes developing \nrural transport to move agricultural surpluses and improve social conditions. The project design \nis  therefore  based  on  (i)  an  identified  demand  to  rehabilitate  and  upgrade  priority  rural \ninfrastructure  to  reduce  the  high  and  persistent  poverty  levels  in  the  northern  mountain \nprovinces,  thereby  improving  access  to  productive  resources,  services  and  socioeconomic \nopportunities,  (ii)  the  government  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  strategies  of  providing \nrural infrastructure as a means to achieve poverty reduction as described in the government\u2019s \nnational  socioeconomic  development  plan  and  other  related  documents,  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and program,4 and (iii) the successful design, implementation experience, and \ninfrastructure  projects.  Lessons  were \nrelevant \nincorporated  from  six  successfully  completed  ADB  projects  implemented  by  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Rural Development (MARD), particularly the Rural Infrastructure Sector Project,5 \nwhich had similar objectives and outputs to the proposed project.  \n \nB. \n\nfrom  earlier  ADB-funded  rural \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nlessons \n\n8. \nThe  intended  impact  of  the  project  is  to  bring  about  sustained  socioeconomic \ndevelopment in the 15 northern mountain provinces of Viet Nam, while the intended outcome is \nto increase access to, and use of priority rural infrastructure by the poor and ethnic minorities in \nthe project area.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n9. \nThe  outputs  will  be  (i)  rehabilitated  and  upgraded  priority  rural  infrastructure  in  all \n15 participating  provinces,  and  (ii)  improved  institutional  and  local  capacities  for  project \nmanagement and for rural infrastructure use and sustainability.  \n \n                                                 \n4   Government of Viet Nam, Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2006.

The  final  list  of subprojects  will  be  determined  after  the  feasibility  studies, \nusing  rigorous  eligibility  safeguard,  technical,  economic,  and  social  criteria.8 The  top  priority \nsubprojects feature irrigation and drainage schemes with an aggregate command (or drainage) \narea  of  approximately  12,400  ha  and  road  links  of  an  aggregate  length  of  approximately  600 \nkm. \n \n\n2. \n\nImproved Capacities for Project Management and for Rural Infrastructure \nUse and Sustainability  \n\n \n11. \nCapacity building activities will cover line agency staff and other stakeholders involved in \nproject implementation as well as those people responsible for the operation and maintenance \nof  infrastructure  managed  by  the  DARDs.    They  will  be  implemented  through  (i)  training \nworkshops  at  national  and  provincial  levels;  (ii)  the  preparation  of  training  materials    and  the \ndelivery of the same; (iii) overseas study tours to better appreciate how implementation issues \nare dealt with in other countries of the region; (iv) the provision of consulting services to support \nproject  implementation  and  to  oversee  the  training  program;  (v)  follow  up  training  impact \nsurveys  to  assist  in  improving  the  impact  of  the  training  methods,  and  (vi)  on-the-job  training \nduring implementation activities. \n \n12. \nThis  component  will  equip  project  implementation  staff  with  the  necessary  skills  and \nknowledge  of  government  and  ADB  procedures  to  recruit  the  various  consulting  services, \nmanage  construction  contracts,  satisfy  progress  reporting  obligations  to  the  government  and \nADB, and conduct sound financial management of imprest accounts. It will also provide support \nto meet incremental staff costs, vehicles, office equipment, air and land travel, per diem, office \noperating  costs,  and,  where  necessary,  the  rehabilitation  of  government  office  facilities  for \nproject use.  \n \n13. \n In addition, it will include the training of staff from agencies responsible for the operation \nand  maintenance  of  the  improved  infrastructure  using  whole-life  asset  management  planning. \nThe project will support the development of a district database of infrastructure assets managed \nby  the  DARDs  and  assistance  in  the  preparation  of  whole-life  maintenance  plans.  Capacity \nbuilding  activities  will  also  include measures  to  increase  road  safety  awareness  for  vulnerable \nroad users along rehabilitated and upgraded rural roads.  \n \nD. \n \n14. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $138 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n                                                 \n6   Such  activities  will  include  intensified  agriculture  extension  activities,  market  training  (including  numeracy  and \n\nlanguage training) and the provision of footpaths and trails leading off from subproject roads. \n\n7  List of Eligible Subprojects (Appendix 2).  \n8   Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nContingenciesc \n\nBase Costb \n1. \n2. \n3. \n \n\nRural infrastructure improvement \nCapacity building \nProject management \nSubtotal (A) \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \n \nC. \n  \na  Includes taxes and duties of $12.054 million to be financed from government resources. \nb  In mid-2010 prices. \nc  Physical contingencies computed at 5% for all expenditure categories, except civil works given the sector approach \nbeing applied.

The regular Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan will have a \n32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe loan agreement. The ADF hard-term loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period \nof 8 years, and an interest rate of 2.2% per annum. \n \nADB\u2019s  total  contribution  to  the  project  cost  will  thus  be  $108.00  million,  78.3%  of  total \n16. \nproject cost. The bulk of the proceeds of these loans (excluding the funds for national capacity \nbuilding and project coordination) will be passed to the 15 participating provincial governments \nby the national government as a grant.  \n \n17. \nThe balance of the project cost, $30.00 million equivalent, or 21.7% of total project cost, \nwill  be  funded  by  the  government  from  its  own  budget  and  will  cover  taxes  and  duties,  staff \nsalaries, and the recruitment of national safeguard consultants for subproject feasibility studies, \ndetailed design, bidding document preparation, and construction supervision. Taxes and duties \non  civil  works,  and  vehicles  and  equipment  to  be  used  in  the  provinces  will  be  funded  by  the \nparticipating provinces.

Each  DARD  will \nestablish a provincial project management unit (PPMU). The PPMUs will be responsible for the \nday-to-day  management  of  subproject  implementation  in  the  provinces,  and  will  carry  out \nfeasibility studies and implement the subprojects.  \n \nThe  project  will  coordinate  closely  with  existing  local  administrations,  using  the \n20. \ncommune people's committee as the point of liaison. PPMUs will work in close cooperation with \ncommune  personnel,  who  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring coordination  of  day-to-day  activities \nbetween the project and commune authorities. This will include organizing public consultations \nand  also  providing  assistance  to  the  commune  supervision  board  to  ensure  commune \nparticipation in subproject design and implementation.9 A budgetary allocation has been made \nto assist in meeting facilitation and coordination costs in each of the participating districts where \nsubprojects are to be implemented. \n \n21. \nThe subprojects will be implemented in two phases. In the first phase, each province will \nimplement their top two priorities. In the second phase, remaining resources will be allocated to \nthe  provinces  for  the  construction  of  additional  subprojects  as  they  successfully  complete  first \nphase  subprojects.  Better  performing  provinces  will  have  a  chance  to  implement  additional \nsubprojects.  Further \nimplementation \nprocedures  and  feasibility  criteria  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in  detail  in  the \nproject administration manual.10  \n \n\nimplementation  arrangements \n\nincluding  subproject \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n(i)   Executing agency \n(ii)   Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iii)   Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\n \n\nAdvance action \n\nDisbursement  \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \nJanuary 2011\u2013December 2016 (6 years) \n31 December 2016 \n\nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development \nProvincial  people\u2019s  committees  for  Bac  Giang,  Bac  Kan,  Cao  Bang,  Dien  Bien,  Ha \nGiang,  Hoa  Binh,  Lai  Chau,  Lang  Son,  Lao  Cai,  Phu  Tho,  Son  La,  Thai  Nguyen, \nTuyen Quang, Vinh Phuc, and Yen Bai provinces \nCentral project management unit to be located in Ha Noi (30 staff) \nProvincial project management units to be located in each provincial capital (minimum \n10 staff each) \nNational competitive bidding \nShopping \nGovernment procedures \n\n150 contracts \n48 contracts \n425 contracts \n\n$93.47 million \n$2.00 million \n$10.89 million (wholly funded \nfrom the government\u2019s own \nresources) \n$4.00 million \n\n347 person-\nmonths \n7 contracts \n\nQuality- and cost-based \nselection (80:20) \nConsultants\u2019 qualification \nselection \nConsultant selection procedures for loan implementation consultants will be \nundertaken up to the short-listing stage prior to loan effectiveness. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nupon between the government and ADB. \n\n$0.60 million \n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n \n                                                 \n9   The commune supervision boards will include at least one women\u2019s representative. \n10  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical  \n\nA. \n \n22. \nThe  subprojects  involve  the  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of existing  rural  infrastructure. \nThe technology for undertaking such works is within the capacity of the provincial government \nagencies  assigned  to  implement  them,  although,  due  to  the  mountainous  terrain,  greater \nattention  to  design  and  implementation  quality  will  be  needed.  The  focus  of  the  civil  works \nimplementation  will  be  on  quality  rather  than  maximizing  coverage,  and  designs  will  be  based \non appropriate standards to ensure sustainability.  \n \n23. \nThe  main  policy  concern  for  rural  infrastructure  is  the  issue  of  sustainability.  The  key \nproblem  with  achieving  sustainability  is  the  lack  of  maintenance  capacity,  including  defined \norganizational responsibilities and accountability, as well as a stable and adequate flow of funds. \nThe  government  has  a  financing  mechanism  for  irrigation  maintenance.  However,  it  does  not \ngenerate adequate funds. To make full use of the limited funds, the capacity building component \nincludes training in operation and maintenance for the end users of the upgraded infrastructure \nand an asset management initiative for irrigation schemes. This will lead to a more efficient and \ncost-effective use of the funds. Operation and maintenance budgets are inadequate to cover all \nroads  under  provincial  responsibility.  However,  the  participating  provinces  have  committed  to \nproviding  funds  for  maintenance  of  the  roads  to  be  upgraded  by  the  project.  Also,  to  reduce \nfuture  maintenance  burdens  the  project  aims  at  initial  robust  design  and  ensuring  good \nconstruction quality. In the near future, the government plans to establish a road fund that will \ninclude a dedicated percentage for rural roads. The project will register the road improvements \nwith  the  provincial  departments  of  transport  to  ensure  their  inclusion  in  the  maintenance \nprogram. The project will coordinate with the local districts and communes to establish market \nmanagement arrangements for market improvements. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nBased  on  the  economic  analysis  of  two  representative  subprojects  (irrigation  and  rural \n24. \nroads),  the  project  will  generate  a  satisfactory  economic  return  from  the  investments.  Better \nwater  management  and  infrastructure  will  lead  to  incremental  productivity  increases  and \ndiversification into produce that yield higher returns. Rehabilitated rural roads will reduce vehicle \noperating  costs,  reduce  travel  times  between  destinations,  and  induce  increased  crop \nproduction  due  to  higher  farm-gate  prices  for  agricultural  produce  and  improved  access  to \nproduction  inputs.  The  estimated  economic  internal  rates  of  return  for  the  representative \nsubprojects  are  13.0%  for  irrigation  and  13.4%  for  rural  roads.  In  each  case,  the  benefits  are \nrobust  to  commodity  price  decreases,  to  decreasing  utilization  rates  and  to  increased \ninvestment cost.  \n \n25. \nFinancial benefits to households will be significant in terms of the opportunities created. \nIndividuals  will  not  contribute  to  investment  costs  but  will  only  contribute  direct  inputs  to \nproduction, and will enjoy the direct and indirect benefits. The distribution analysis confirms that \nthe poor will benefit significantly and proportionally from subproject investments.11 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n26. \nAll procurement to be financed by ADB loan funds will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). MARD has indicated that \nit  will  ensure  that  all  accounts  administered  by  the  CPMU  and  PPMUs  are  consolidated  and \naudited  annually  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  project  will  strengthen  the  capacities  of \nCPMU and  PPMU staff  in financial management procedures to allow the efficient operation of \n\n                                                 \n11  Economic and Financial Analysis (Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\nadvance  accounts  and  the  reporting  of  financial  performance  to  the  government  and  ADB. \nImplementation of the project will be consistent with the government\u2019s requirement for provincial \nimplementation  under  national  coordination.  Where  possible,  the  involvement  of  district  and \nlower level administrations and communities will be sought to effect their participation in design \nand  construction  monitoring.  The  project  will  also  establish  a  website  to  (i)  disclose \nimplementation  progress  and  bid  notifications  and  their  results,  and  (ii)  provide  a  grievance \nmechanism against any corrupt practice. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MARD. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual.12 \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n28. \nPoverty  levels  among  direct  beneficiaries  of  subprojects  range  from  25%  to  60%.  The \nmajority  of  subprojects  have  a  poverty  level  of  over  40%,  compared  with  an  overall  national \nfigure of 11% in 2008. As evidenced by past successful ADB interventions, improving access to \nresources,  inputs,  services  and  market  opportunities,  the  project  is  expected  to  have  a \nsignificant  impact  in  reducing  poverty  throughout  the  subproject  areas  and  beyond.  Direct \nbeneficiaries  will  include  residents  in  the  subproject  areas.  The  rural  road  improvements  will \nalso  generate  indirect  beneficiaries  by  increasing  the  overall  catchment  area  and  efficiency  of \nthe rural transport networks. The project is classified as \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming\u201d under \nADB\u2019s gender mainstreaming categories. The majority of women in the project area are active in \nagriculture but also undertake about 80% of domestic chores. The project will provide women in \nthe target communities with improved infrastructure that will enable increased productivity and \nincomes, empowerment through participation in project decision-making, reduced work burdens, \noff-farm  income  earning  opportunities,  and  improved  access  to  educational,  health  and  social \nservices. To ensure benefits accrue to women, a gender action plan has been prepared.13  \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\n29. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  is  unlikely  to  cause  significant  environmental \ndamage since the subprojects are mainly limited to improving existing infrastructure. Moreover, \nsubprojects  have  been  screened  to  exclude  those  that  may  cause  significant  damage.  The \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  provides  guidance  for  the  government  to \ncarry out an appropriate level of environmental assessment and to take measures to deal with \nthese impacts.14  \n \n30. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  No  resettlement  is  expected  because  the \nmajority of infrastructure, irrigation, and roads will be improved along existing rights of way. As a \nresult, the main concern will be the provision of compensation for roadside trees, crops or small \nstructures. The  absence  of  major  resettlement issues  was one  of  the eligibility  criteria  used  in \nselecting  subprojects.  The  government  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  a  resettlement  framework \nalong  with  procedures  and  an  outline  format  for  a  resettlement  plan. 15  Compensation, \nallowances,  operation  and  administration  costs,  surveys,  monitoring,  and  reporting  will  be \nfinanced  from  government  counterpart  funds.  A  qualified  institution  or  firm  acceptable  to  ADB \nwill be contracted by the government to conduct independent external monitoring and evaluation \nof the resettlement process and impacts. \n \n\n                                                 \n12  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n13  Gender Action Plan (Appendix 2). \n14  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (Appendix 2). \n15  Resettlement Framework (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n31. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  B).  Ethnic  minorities  are  expected  to  be  among  the \nmajor  beneficiaries  of  the  project.  The  government  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  an  indigenous \npeoples planning framework. For most subprojects, where the majority of beneficiaries are from \nethnic minorities and where subproject impacts are expected to be wholly positive, measures to \nimprove  the  welfare  of  indigenous  peoples  and  protection  of  their  rights  are  included  in  the \nsubproject design. In other subprojects, combined resettlement and ethnic minority development \nplans  will  be  prepared.  An  important  aspect  of  the  project  will  be  the  use  of  the  commune \nsupervision  board  to  ensure  local  peoples\u2019  participation  in  subproject  design  and  construction \nsupervision. This will ensure that specific local concerns among ethnic minorities are addressed \nduring implementation. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n\nThe integrated benefits and impacts of the project are expected to outweigh the costs. \n32. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.16  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nLimited economic development \npotential in subproject areas \n\nInsufficient operation and \nmaintenance leading to \npremature asset deterioration \n\nMitigating Measures \nSubprojects have been prescreened to ensure technical and initial \neconomic viability during the preparation phase. Feasibility studies \nincluding economic and financial analyses will be undertaken prior to \nimplementation.  \n\nParticipating provinces have committed to provide adequate operation \nand maintenance funding as a condition for selection of subprojects. \nRobust designs and good quality control will reduce the maintenance \nburden. Maintenance capacity building will be supported for irrigation \nsubprojects. The project will have close coordination with the authorities \nresponsible for management of the road improvements. \n\nCatastrophic climatic events \ninterrupting implementation or \ndamaging infrastructure \n\nThe use of robust designs and good construction quality control will \nreduce the vulnerability of the rural infrastructure to catastrophic climatic \nevents. \n\nLimited implementation \ncapacities at the provincial \nlevel to meet all ADB and \nproject requirements. \n\nProject preparatory TA will provide start-up support, and loan \nimplementation consultants will provide capacity building and training. \nThe implementation will be phased, rewarding better-performing \nprovinces in the second phase with additional resources. This will be an \nincentive for good performance and delivery. \n\nSource: Project design and monitoring framework \u2013 Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n33. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and loan documents. \n \n34. \nset forth in the loan agreements. \n \n\nThe  government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are \n\n                                                 \n16 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2) \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n35. \nAs  a  condition  of  disbursement  of  funds  to  individual  provinces,  the  government  has \nagreed that no disbursement shall be made to a province until a PPMU has been established \nwithin the DARD of that province.  \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n36. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR54,116,000  to  the  Socialist \nRepublic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Sustainable  Rural  Infrastructure  Development \nProject  in  Northern  Mountain  Provinces  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources \n(regular terms), with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreements presented to the \nBoard; and \nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR17,159,000  to  the  Socialist \nRepublic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Sustainable  Rural  Infrastructure  Development \nProject  in  Northern  Mountain  Provinces  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources \n(hard-term facility), with an interest charge at the rate of 2.2% per annum; for a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nagreements presented to the Board. \n\n \n \n \n \n \nC.
