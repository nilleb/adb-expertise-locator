By  the  end  of  2010,  the  primary  energy \ndemand  in  the  PRC  had  increased  to  more  than  3.00  billion  tons  of  standard  coal  equivalent \n(btce), compared to 1.39 btce in 2000. The PRC relies heavily on carbon-intensive coal, which \nprovided  about  70%  of  its  primary  energy  in  2010.3 Electricity  generation  and  heat  supplies \naccount for about half of the total coal consumption in the PRC. The  Government of the PRC \nhas recognized the challenges posed by the rapid rise in energy consumption and  associated \nemissions. It has committed to achieve 40%\u201345% carbon intensity reduction by 2020 compared \nwith  2005,  primarily  by  targeting  energy  intensity  reductions.4 During  the  Eleventh  Five-Year \nPlan,  2006\u20132010  the  energy  intensity  was  reduced  by  19.06%  compared  with  a  target  of \n20.00%.  During  the  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015  the  PRC  has  set  a  further  energy \nintensity reduction target of 16%, an 8% reduction of sulfur dioxide (SO2), and a 10% reduction \nof nitrogen oxide (NOx). Heilongjiang province has set corresponding targets of reducing energy \nintensity by 16.0%, SO2 emission by 2.0% (10,000 tons [t]), and NOx emission by 3.1% (23,000 \nt) by 2015 compared to 2010.5  \n \nThe  PRC  is  the  second-largest  district  heating  market  in  the  world,  the  Russian \n4. \nFederation  being  the  largest.  Because  of  the  large  demand,  1 3   provinces,  3  autonomous \nregions,  and  two  cities  have  adopted  centralized  heating. 6 The  DHS  coverage  area  is \ncontinuously  expanding  to  keep  pace  with  the  rapid  economic  growth  and  urbanization. \nBetween  2003  and  2010,  centralized  heating  coverage  in  the  PRC  increased  from  1.9  billion \nsquare meters (m2) to 4.4 billion m2. However, DHS still covers only 30% of the total floor area \n\n                                                 \n1  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2010.  Technical \nAssistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing Heilongjiang Energy Efficient District Heating Project. \nManila. \n\n2  The cities included in the project are Harbin, Jiagedaqi, Jiamusi, Jixi, Qitaihe, Raohe, Tongjiang, and Yichun. \n3  China Statistics Press. 2010. China Energy Statistical Year Book. Beijing. \n4  Carbon  intensity  is  the  amount  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  per  unit  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  Energy \nintensity  is  the  amount  of  energy  consumed  per  unit  of  GDP.  In  the  PRC,  the  energy  intensity  is  generally \nmeasured in tons of coal equivalent per CNY10,000 of GDP.  \n\n5  State  Council.  2011.  Circular  of  the  State  Council  on  Issuing  the  Comprehensive  Work  Plan  for  Energy \n\nConservation and Emission Reduction during the Twelfth Five-Year Plan Period, Decree No. 26. Beijing. \n\n6  The  provinces  are  Anhui,  Gansu,  Hebei,  Heilongjiang,  Henan,  Hubei,  Jiangsu,  Jilin,  Liaoning,  Qinghai,  Shaanxi, \nShandong, and Shanxi. The autonomous regions are Inner Mongolia, Ninxia, and Xinjiang. The cities are Beijing \nand Tianjin. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ncompared to coverage of about 60% in European countries. Coverage is particularly low in low-\nincome urban areas.  \n \n5. \nHeilongjiang  is  an  underdeveloped  inland  province  in  the  northeastern  region  of  the \nPRC.  Heating  service  in  Heilongjiang,  where  temperatures  fall  below  \u201340\u00b0C  and  the  heating \nseason lasts for up to 6 months, meets one of the basic human needs and provides essential \nsupport  to  socioeconomic  activities.  Northeastern  provinces,  including  Heilongjiang,  are  a \nsource  of  transboundary  air  pollution  such  as  acid  rain.  The  centralized  heating  area  in \nHeilongjiang has increased from 199 million m2 in 2003 to 384 million m2 in 2010. By 2015, the \nprovince plans to increase the district heating coverage area by another 200 million m2, which \nwill cover up to 70% of the cities and counties in the province. Many existing heating systems in \nthe province are old and inefficient, and lack modern emission control equipment. Combustion \nefficiency of existing small heat-only boilers of 55% in many cities is far below the 87% that can \nbe achieved in modern combined heat and power (CHP) plants or large heat-only boilers.  \n \n6. \nThe  existing  inadequate  coverage  of  district  heating  in  low-income  urban  areas  in \nHeilongjiang compels households to use coal stoves for heating, and these are a major cause of \nindoor  air  pollution  and  respiratory  diseases.  The  poor  indoor  air  quality  in  households  has  a \ndisproportionately  high  effect  on  women  and  children,  who  spend  most  of  their  time  indoors. \nThere  were  18  cases  of  carbon  monoxide  (CO)  poisoning  and  10  fire  accidents  caused  by \nhousehold  stoves  from  2008  to  2010  in  the  project  areas.  Emissions  from  existing  small  and \ninefficient  neighborhood  boilers,  most  of  which  lack  emission  control  equipment,  also  worsen \noutdoor air quality and cause significant cumulative harm to public health. Providing cleaner and \nreliable district heating services to households and other community areas will (i) reduce cases \nof  respiratory  diseases  through  improved  indoor  and  outdoor  air  quality,  reduce  CO  poisoning \nby  providing  safer  district  heating  services,  and  improve  the  medical  environment;  (ii)  improve \nliving conditions; (iii) reduce heating expenditure by switching from individual household stoves \nand decentralized heating systems to centralized energy efficient heating systems; (iv) provide a \nbetter  schooling  environment  during  the  winter;  and  (v)  increase  incomes  through  job \nopportunities  created  during  construction  and  operation.  Women  and  vulnerable  people \nconnected to the modern district heating networks will enjoy a cleaner, safer living environment. \n \nThe  project  will  target  selected  cities  where  the  poverty  ratio  is  as  high  as  8.7% \n7. \n(compared to the national average of 7.7%) and district heating coverage is particularly low. The \nproject will demonstrate that significant expansion of energy efficient DHSs to an additional 27 \nmillion  m2  (270,000  households)  can  be  introduced  without  increasing  net  emissions.  The \nproject will remove small, inefficient, and polluting neighborhood coal-fired boilers and coal-fired \nhousehold stoves; and construct centralized district heating networks where heat is supplied by \nhighly energy efficient CHP plants and large boilers, thereby reducing the overall carbon and air \npollution footprints of district heating. \n \n8. \nThe  project  is  closely  aligned  with  Strategy  2020,  where  moving  developing  member \ncountries  onto  low-carbon  growth  paths  by  improving  energy  efficiency  has  been  identified  as \none  of  the  key  means  of  achieving  environmentally  sustainable  growth. 7  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Energy Policy prioritizes projects on energy efficiency and access to \nenergy  for  all,  including  district  heating,  for  energy  efficiency  improvement  and  access  to \nmodern  cleaner  heating  services  for  all.8 The  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015  for  the \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB.  2008.

On further evaluation, natural gas was considered unfeasible due to limited supply \nin  the  project  area.  There  are  no  renewable  energy  sources  available  that  are  technically  and \nfinancially  viable  with  incremental  cost  and  reasonable  time  frame  in  the  project  area.  CHP \n\n                                                 \n14 Install a supervisory control and data acquisition system, which allows for regulation of the temperature and flow of \n\nhot water automatically based on actual heat consumption and outdoor temperature.  \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nplants (with thermal efficiencies of 90% or higher) and large coal-fired boilers (with combustion \nefficiency of 87% or higher) with post-combustion emission control devices to meet the national \nstandards in reducing air emissions were found to be the least-cost feasible option to meet the \nheating  requirements  reliably  in  the  project  cities.  The  circulating  fluidized-bed  combustion \ntechnology  was  selected  among  available  technologies  for  all  the  heating  plants  under  the \nproject  as  it  has  higher  combustion  efficiency,  lower  NOx  emission,  and  lower  desulfurization \ncost. Compared to the existing small and inefficient heating boilers (42% combustion efficiency), \nnew  heating  boilers  improve  thermal  efficiency  to  87%  and  reduce  associated  carbon  dioxide \nand  other  emissions.  Small  heating  boilers  owned  by  the  implementing  agencies  will  be \ndecommissioned after heating networks are connected to the new heat sources. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n17. \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  calculated  for  each  subproject.  The \nfinancial analysis of the subprojects indicates FIRRs of between 8.6% and 9.9%, which for each \ncase is higher than the corresponding weighted average cost of capital. The overall FIRR for the \nwhole project is 9.5%, compared with the weighted average cost of capital of 2.3%. Sensitivity \nanalysis shows that the project is likely to be sustainable under various adverse scenarios. \n \n18. \nThe economic benefits of the upgraded district heating supply include improved heating \nefficiency  and  environment.  The  calculations  reflect  all  the  project-related  costs,  benefits  from \ncost  savings  from  alternative  fuels  and  efficiency  improvements,  plus  local  and  global \nenvironmental benefits. Analyses for each subproject indicate economic internal rates of return \n(EIRR)  without  environmental  benefits  ranging  from  12.5%  to  20.6%.  The  EIRR  of  the  whole \nproject without environmental benefits is 17.9%, which is more than the 12.0% economic cost of \ncapital.  The  analyses  for  each  subproject  indicate  EIRRs  with  environmental  benefits  ranging \nfrom  16.4%  to  25.3%.  The  EIRR  of  the  whole  project  with  environmental  benefits  is  21.1%, \nwhich is more than the 12.0% economic cost of capital. Therefore, the project is economically \nfeasible.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  project  is  likely  to  be  sustainable  under  various \nadverse scenarios.  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nFinancial management assessment was conducted for the implementing agencies.15 All \n19. \ncompanies  have  large  shareholder  equity,  which  can  support  more  debt  financing  from \ncommercial  banks.  The  assessment  indicates  that  accrual  based  accounting  and  the  PRC \nbusiness  accounting  standards  are  followed.  The  accounting  procedures  used  by  the \nimplementing  agencies  are  aligned  with  the  regulations  and  policies  issued  by  the  Ministry  of \nFinance, and are considered effective and adequate for the project. The executing agency has \nexperience in implementing several projects financed by ADB, and has a good track record in \nfinancial management of those projects.16  \n                                                 \n15 Financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  under  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  in  2011. \nFinancial Management Assessment of the Implementing Agencies (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2).  \n\n16  The Heilongjiang provincial government is administering four ADB loans: ADB. 2005.

Implementing agencies lacking experience in conducting international competitive \nbidding will be trained in various aspects of procurement and project management (para. 11).  \n \n21. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  Heilongjiang  provincial  government  (HPG).  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in paras. 57 and 58 of the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nSocial  benefits. The project will directly benefit more than 1.63 million urban residents \n22. \nof the project cities, about half of whom (0.81 million) are female and 37,000 of whom are from \npoor  households,  and  provide  direct  benefits  to  174,625  children  in  314  schools  and  patients \nand medical staff in 108 hospitals. The project will  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nreduce  cases  of  respiratory  diseases  through  improved  indoor  and  outdoor  air \nquality,  reduce  CO  poisoning  by  providing  safer  district  heating  services,  and \nprovide  a  better  medical  environment  by  providing  cleaner  and  reliable  heating \nservices to hospitals;  \nimprove living conditions through adequate and reliable heating services;  \nreduce  heating  expenditure  by  switching  from  individual  household  stoves  and \ndecentralized heating systems to centralized energy efficient heating systems;  \nprovide  a  better  schooling  environment  during  the  winter  by  providing  cleaner \nand reliable heating services; and  \nincrease  income  through  job  opportunities  created  during  construction  and \noperation (3,413 jobs during construction and 1,339 during operation). \n\n \nLabor  retrenchment. A total of 2,075 boiler workers (520 full-time and 1,555 seasonal \n23. \nworkers)  will  be  affected  by  the  closure  of  around  470  small  coal-fired  boilers.  A  labor \nretrenchment and reemployment plan was prepared to safeguard the livelihoods of the affected \nworkers.18 All  of  the  520  full-time  workers  under  the  Jiagedaqi,  Jiamusi,  Yichun  City\u2013Xinqing, \nand Yichun City\u2013Tangwanghe subprojects will be transferred to the operation and maintenance \nof  heat  exchange  stations.  The  temporary  seasonal  workers  will  be  informed  by  the \nimplementing  agencies  of  the  status  of  boiler  closures  before  the  end  of  the  final  heating \nseason.  Since  they  are  contractual  seasonal  workers,  the  implementing  agencies  are  not \nobliged to retain them and provide employment assistance. However, if the workers would like \nto  work  at  the  heat  supply  plants  as  seasonal  workers,  they  are  eligible  to  participate  in  the \ntechnical  training  for  potential  new  positions.  Those  who  have  completed  the  training  course \nmay be hired on a contractual or permanent basis depending on vacancies and proficiency. \n \n24. \nGender  impact.  The  project\u2019s  impact  on  women  includes  (i)  access  to  cleaner,  safer, \nand reliable heating system; (ii) reduced domestic chores related to space heating (1 hour per \nday);  (iii)  reduced  incidence  of  respiratory  diseases  related  to  indoor  air  pollution;  and                    \n(iv)  reduced  incidence  of  CO  poisoning  and  accidental  fires.  There  are  some  areas  to  be \nimproved  to  make  the  project  more  gender  responsive,  such  as  raising  awareness  on  energy \n\n                                                 \n17 Procurement  Capacity  Assessment  Report  and  Recommendations  (accessible  in  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\n18 Labor Retrenchment and Reemployment Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nAppendix 2.) \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nconservation  focusing  on  women,  and  improving  gender-responsive  customer  orientation  in \nheating service delivery. \n \n25. \nA gender action plan was prepared to maximize the project benefit on women, safeguard \npoor households headed by women, increase the participation of women in the district heating \nindustry, and monitor the project impact on women.19 Under the project  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\njob opportunities will be promoted for women as heating bill collectors, targeting \n50% as women;  \nheating  assistance  will  be  ensured  for  the  1,300  poor  households  headed  by \nwomen  by  subsidizing  70%  of  the  heating  tariff  (by  the  local  government)  and \nwaiving connection fees (by the heating companies);  \nenergy  conservation  awareness  campaigns  will  be  organized,  targeting  about \n800,000 women (100% of the women in subproject areas) in partnership with the \nwomen\u2019s federation;  \na targeted session on women and district heating will be held in the knowledge-\nsharing  workshop  between  private  and  state-owned  district  heating  companies; \nand \na  separate  session  on  women  and  district  heating  will  be  held  at  the  regional \nconference on district heating. \n\nSafeguards \n\n22 and 22,819 t of particulate matter.  \n\n \nE. \n \n26. \nEnvironmental  benefits.  The  project  results  in  substantial  environmental  benefits  by \nreplacing  around  470  small,  old,  and  inefficient  heating  boilers  and  275,166  household  stoves \n(equivalent to about 1,014 megawatt thermal) with energy efficient CHP or heating boilers, and \nrehabilitating heating pipes to reduce heat losses. The net reduction in annual coal consumption \nis estimated at 418,889 t, which results in the reduction of 1 million t of carbon dioxide,20 4,500 t \nof SO2,21 1,961 t of NOx\n \n27. \nThe  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environment  and  C  for  involuntary  resettlement \nand  indigenous  peoples.  The  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  of  the  project  include              \n(i) soil erosion during construction, (ii) increased noise and dust affecting local residents during \nconstruction,  (iii) inappropriate  storage  of  hazardous  materials  and  wastes  during  operation,             \n(iv)  safety  risks  to  community  members  and  workers  during  construction  and  operation,  and               \n(v)  flue  gas  emissions  during  operation.  Specific  potential  adverse  impacts  caused  by  the \ndemolition of small boilers are (i) wastes such as equipment and building materials, and (ii) dust \nand noise from demolition of boiler houses and chimneys. The initial environmental examination \n(IEE) concludes that the potential adverse environmental impacts can be adequately mitigated \nthrough appropriate mitigation measures, as outlined in the project environmental management \nplan (EMP) presented in the IEE, and the project will result in environmental and socioeconomic \nbenefits that significantly outweigh potential negative impacts. \n \n28. \nThe  HPG  and  the  implementing  agencies  shall  ensure  that  the  project  is  designed, \nconstructed,  and  operated  in  accordance  with  relevant  PRC  national  and  local  environmental \nlaws,  regulations,  procedures,  and  guidelines;  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009);  and \n\n                                                 \n19 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 ADB  will  support  the  efforts  of  obtaining  clean  development  mechanism  benefits  through  its  technical  support \n\nfacility.  \n\n21 Equivalent to 45% of provincial reduction target. \n22 Equivalent to 8.5% of provincial reduction target. \n\n\f9 \n\nSpecial Features \n\nthe  EMP. 23 The  HPG  will  ensure  the  boilers  constructed  under  the  project  comply  with  both \nPRC  flue  gas  emissions  standards  stipulated  in  the  Emission  Standard  of  Air  Pollutants  for \nCoal-burning,  Oil-burning,  Gas-fired  Boilers  (GB  13217-2001)  and  in  the  World  Bank\u2019s \nEnvironmental,  Health,  and  Safety  Guidelines  for  Thermal  Power  Plants. 24  Environmental \nmonitoring  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  biannually  during  construction,  and  then  annually \nduring operations. The EMP including mitigation measures, a monitoring plan, and institutional \narrangements  will  be  updated  during  engineering  design  and  incorporated  in  the  bidding \ndocuments  and  civil  works  contracts.  The  project  has  fully  complied  with  the  ADB  information \ndisclosure and meaningful consultation requirements. \n \nF. \n \nHeating service delivery in Heilongjiang is primarily by state-owned enterprises (SOEs). \n29. \nAlthough  the  heating  subsector\u2019s  high  growth  rate  provides  significant  opportunity  for  private \nsector  participation,  this  has  been  slow  primarily  because  of  (i)  high  investment  costs  but \nmarginal returns due to low heating tariffs; (ii) reluctance of local financial institutions to provide \ndebt  financing,  particularly  in  remote  urban  areas  with  smaller  consumer  bases,  because  of \nperceived high risks; and (iii) the small number of private companies with the required technical, \nfinancial, and managerial capacity to operate such utilities. Weak customer orientation in service \ndelivery  by  SOEs  causes  low  tariff  collection  rates.  Modernization  of  state-owned  heating \ncompanies and capacity strengthening in critical areas of financial management, tariff collection, \nand customer service can help to increase the viability of heating businesses.  \n \nThe project will provide affordable financial support to two private enterprises25 and play \n30. \na catalytic role in mobilizing commercial financing. To benefit from good business practices of \nprivate  sector  enterprises,  knowledge-sharing  sessions  will  be  organized  between  private \nenterprises and SOEs to draw suggestions on reforms to the business environment. A regional \nconference on district heating with the likely participation of neighboring northern provinces and \ncountries  (i.e.,  Japan,  Republic  of  Korea,  and  member  countries  of  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic  Cooperation)  fostering  regional  cooperation  through  knowledge  sharing  will  be \norganized by the HPG using the proposed loan. All of these activities will help increase private \nsector development and subregional cooperation.  \n \nG. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.26 \n \n\n                                                 \n23 ADB. 2009.
