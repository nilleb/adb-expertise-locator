This  will  be\nachieved  by:  (i)  strengthening \nfor\nsustainable  planning  and  management  of  marine  and\ncoastal  resources,  (ii)  improving  the  availability  of  and\naccess  to  quality  spatial  and  biodiversity  information  and\ndata  useful  for  resource  planning,  (iii)  improving  the  legal\nand  regulatory  framework  in  resource  management  and\nit,  and  (iv)  undertaking  small-scale\ncompliance  with \nand\nsocioeconomic \ninvestments \nenvironmental conditions in selected coastal habitats.\n\nlocal  capacity \n\nimproving \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nCategory  B\nAn initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken,\nand the summary IEE is included as a core appendix.\n\n: Marine and coastal resources provide important support to\nIndonesia's  economy,  and  are  of  national  and  global\ntheir  rich  biological  diversity.\nimportance  because  of \nHowever,  current  management  efforts  do  not  adequately\nmeet  the  objectives  for  protection  and  sustainable  use  of\ncoastal  resources.  Resource  use  and  exploitation  have\nresulted  in  widespread  environmental  degradation.  The\npresent situation can be largely attributed to lack of (i)  an\nto  coastal  zone  planning  and\nintegrated  approach \nmanagement,  (ii)  information  and  data  on  which  to  base\nresource  management  decisions,  (iii) \nin\nlocal  government  and\nresource  allocation,  and \ncommunity  involvement  in  resource  management.  The\npressure  on  marine  and  coastal  resources  has  been\nexacerbated  by  financial  and  economic  crises.  Resource\ndepletion  and  environmental  degradation  have  adversely\naffected  coastal  communities,  particularly  the  artisanal\nfishers.\n\ntransparency \n\n(iv) \n\nThe recent political changes have ushered in a new phase\nfor  natural  resources  management  and  environmental\nprotection. The Government has initiated a decentralization\nprocess  whereby \nresource  management\nresponsibilities  are  being  devolved  to  local  governments,\nwhich will have a larger share of revenues under new fiscal\narrangements.  The  process \nthe  sense  of\nownership  of  resources  at \nlevel,  provides\nopportunities for community participation, and enhances the\nprospect  for  transparency  in  resource  allocation.

At  the  request  of  the  Government,  an  ADB  Loan  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited\nIndonesia from 27 March to 18 April 2000, followed by an Appraisal Mission2 from 17 July to 8\nAugust    2000.  This  Report  is  based  on  the  findings  of  the  ADB  Missions,  a  review  of  various\nstudies  including  the  feasibility  studies  of  the  Project,  the  Mangrove  Rehabilitation  Project,3\nNatural  Resources  and  Environmental  Management  Sector  Project,4  and  National  Biodiversity\nInformation  Network  Project,5  and  discussions  with  national  and  regional  government  officials\nconcerned,  members  of  civil  society,  and  coastal  and  small  island  communities.  The  project\nframework is in Appendix 1.\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1.\n\nMarine and Coastal Resources Sector\n\n3.\nIndonesia  is  the  world\u2019s  largest  archipelagic  nation,  with  a  marine  area  of  5.8  million\nsquare kilometers (km2), comprising 3.1 million km2 of territorial and archipelagic seas and 2.7\nmillion  km2  of  exclusive  economic  zone.  In  contrast,  its  landmass  totals  only  1.9  million  km2.\nWith a coastline covering 81,000 km and 17,508 islands, Indonesia is truly a maritime continent,\nwith a vast mass of water surrounding small pockets of land. The marine and coastal areas are\nrich in  natural  resources  consisting of rich and diverse living aquatic resources and significant\nreserves  of  oil,  gas,  and  other  minerals.  Indonesia\u2019s  marine  waters  cover  important  maritime\nroutes and offer opportunities for development of maritime service industries. In 1997, the total\nproduct  of  coastal  and  marine  economic  activities  was  estimated  at  some  25-30  percent  of\nIndonesia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), providing employment for about 20 million people.\n\n                  \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n4 \n5 \n\nTA 2958-INO: Marine Resources Evaluation Management and Planning Project, for $600,000, approved on 19\nDecember 1997.\nThe  Mission  comprised  M.J.  Rahman,  Senior  Project  Specialist/Mission  Chief;  N.  Bestari,  Project  Economist;\nP.N. King, Sr. Project Specialist (Natural Resources); P. Spantigati, Programs Officer; O. Tiwana, Counsel; and\nR. Montgomery, Poverty Specialist/Staff Consultant.\nTA Loan 1251-INO, for $8.08 million, approved on 9 September 1993.\nTA 3234-INO: Natural Resources and Environmental Management, for $380,000, approved on 30 July 1999.\nTA 2822-INO: National Bidoversity Information Network, for $700,000, approved on 11 July 1997.\n\n\f2\n\nDespite  the  importance  of  coastal  and  marine  waters  to  Indonesia\u2019s  economy  and\n4.\nenvironment, this resource has not been managed sustainably. Resource use and exploitation\nhave led to extensive coastal zone degradation \u2014 loss of mangrove forests, destruction of coral\nreefs,  depletion  of  fish  stocks,  water  pollution,  soil  erosion,  and  biodiversity  loss.  About  30\npercent of Indonesia\u2019s 4.3 million hectares (ha) of coastal mangrove forests, a biologically and\neconomically important ecosystem, has been lost since the mid-1960s. The loss is mostly due\nto  forestry  concession  operations,  and  conversion  to  fishponds,  rice  fields,  industrial  estates,\nand  settlements.  The  rapid  loss  of  mangrove  cover  has  exacerbated  shoreline  erosion,  led  to\ndestruction of natural habitats for demersal fish and shrimp, increased the occurrence of saline\nwater  intrusion  into  freshwater  aquifers,  and  affected  the  livelihood  of  coastal  fishers.  Most  of\nthe coral reefs are rapidly deteriorating, mainly because of intensive human activities, such as\ncoral  mining,  blast  and  cyanide  fishing,  sedimentation,  tourist  activities,  coastal  development,\nand pollution. Using a measure of live coral cover, a national survey in 1994 found that only 30\npercent  remained  in  good  to  excellent  condition.  Since  1994,  global  warming  and  associated\ncoral  bleaching,  plus  increased  reliance  on  coastal  fishing,  have  further  damaged  the  nation\u2019s\nreefs.  Since coral reefs are habitats of about 90 percent of the fish caught by the coastal fishers\nin  the  country,  their  degradation  results  in  rapid  decrease  of  fisheries  production  in  coastal\nareas.\n\n5.\nThe  coastal  environment  has  also  been  affected  by  land-based  activities.  Watershed\ndeforestation and erosion have led to increased sedimentation in estuaries, adversely affecting\nnavigation  routes,  mangrove  forests,  coral  reefs,  and  fisheries  resources.  Industrial  and  urban\nwastes  and  runoff,  containing  chemicals  and  pesticides  from  agricultural  land,  have  polluted\ncoastal waters and impaired the ecological functions of coastal habitats as nursery and breeding\ngrounds for marine aquatic resources.\n\n6.\nThe degradation of aquatic habitats, accompanied by overfishing, has depleted fisheries\nresources.  An  ADB-assisted  study6  confirmed  serious  depletion  of  fisheries  resources  in  the\ncoastal regions of Sumatra, North Java, and the straits of Malacca and Makassar. Although the\noverall  current  marine  capture  fisheries  harvest  level  at  3.08  million  tons  (t)  is  believed  to  be\nbelow the estimated maximum sustainable yield of 4.5 million t,7 catches of certain commercial\nspecies such as shrimp have exceeded their sustainable yield levels.\n\n7.\nDegradation of coastal and marine resources poses a serious threat to Indonesia\u2019s rich\nand unique marine biodiversity. Indonesia has about 20,000 species of mollusks, 2,000 species\nof  crustaceans,  6  species  of  sea  turtles,  30  marine  mammal  species,  and  over  8,500  fish\nspecies. No comprehensive survey has been carried out in recent years to assess the current\nstate  of  these  living  aquatic  resources,  but  it  is  believed  that  continued  stress  threatens  the\nexistence of many species. To protect marine biodiversity, the Government planned to identify\nand  designate  30  million  ha  for  marine  conservation  by  the  year  2000;  but  only  2.5  million  ha\nhas  so  far  been  identified  and  is  being  conserved.  Major  impediments  in  establishing  marine\nreserves  were  lack  of  understanding  of  conservation  values  among  the  planners  and\nimplementors in an inappropriate former Ministry of Forestry and Estate Crops (MOFEC).\n\nNatural  resources  degradation  and  environmental  problems  in  the  coastal  zone  have\n8.\naffected  the  livelihood  of  coastal  people,  particularly  artisanal  (small-scale)  fishers.  Artisanal\nfishing is the occupation of last resort for many poor people in the country due to the population\ngrowth, decreased availability of farmland, and open access to sea. Consequently, the number\n\n                  \n\n6 \n7 \n\nTA 2053-INO: Coastal Environmental Management Planning, for $1.2 million, approved on 3 January 1994.\nPriyonod, B.E. and B. Sumiono, 1996. Sustainable Exploitation of Coastal Fish Stocks in Indonesia.\n\n\f3\n\nof  coastal  fishers  increased  by  more  than  50  percent  over  the  past  decade.  Because  of  a\ndeteriorating  fisheries  resource  base,  fish  catch  per  unit  of  effort  has  been  steadily  declining,\nadversely  affecting  incomes.  The  average  income  of  coastal  fishers  is  below  the  average\nnational level. Various studies show that the coastal fishing communities are among the poorest\nsegments of society in the country. They lack access to basic social infrastructure such as clean\nwater,  sanitation,  health  care,  roads,  and  transportation,  and  fail  to  benefit  from  formal  credit\nfacilities because they lack credit history and collateral.\n\n2.\n\nPlanning and Management Framework\n\na. \n\nLegal Framework\n\nThe Indonesian Constitution requires that natural resources be managed to achieve the\n9.\ngreatest possible benefit for the people.  A number of relevant laws drafted with the assistance\nof  international  experts  were  passed  by  the  legislature.  Among  them  are  (i)  Forestry  Act  of\n1967, (ii) Environment Act No. 4 of 1982, (iii) Fisheries Act No. 9 of 1985, (iv) Conservation of\nLiving  Resources  and  their  Ecosystems  Act  No.  5  of  1992,  (v)  Spatial  Planning  Act  No.  24  of\n1992;  and  (vi)  Environmental  Management  Act  No.  23  of  1997.  In  addition,  Indonesia  is  a\nsignatory  to  a  number  of  international  declarations  on  natural  resources  and  environmental\nmanagement,  and  issued  laws  ratifying  some  of  these  declarations.  They  include  (i)  UN\nConvention of the Law of the Sea (1982); (ii) International Maritime Organization laws on marine\npollution (1969, 1971, 1989); and (iii) UN Convention on Biodiversity (1992). These laws have\nbeen  supplemented  by  regulations  setting  out  basic  sector  policies,  for  example,  on  mining,\nfisheries,  forestry,  and  environment.  Also,  there  are  customary  local  laws  governing  the\nallocation and use of natural resources, but these laws are hardly observed.\n\n10.\nThe  many  agencies  involved  in  the  multiple  use  of  marine  and  coastal  areas  are  not\nproperly  coordinated.  Many  resource  management  issues  were  addressed  by  ministerial\ndecrees,  which  covered  only  part  of  the  solution  because  the  ministry  concerned  had  limited\njurisdiction. Often these ministerial decrees concerning marine space were inconsistent with one\nanother  and  hence  difficult  to  implement.  Spatial  Planning  Act  No.  24  of  1992  was  aimed  at\nreducing conflicts over  the use of  land and sea resources by providing a strong legislation for\nresource  allocation  and  management  based  on  spatial  considerations.  However,  institutional\nweaknesses and lack of political will have failed to sufficiently institutionalize the spatial planning\nconcept in managing marine and terrestrial resources.\n\nEnforcement  of  laws  and  regulations  is  weak  largely  because  of  lack  of  transparency\n11.\nand  weak  institutional  capability.  Many  resource  allocation  and  resource  use  decisions  were\ntaken at high levels of Government without considering resource sustainability and adherence to\nlegal provisions.   Such decisions were frequently made without adequate consultation with local\ngovernments and the affected communities.\n\n12.\nRegional Autonomy Act No. 22 of 1999 provides a new dimension to the legal framework\nof  natural  resources  planning.  The  Act  aims  to  decentralize  most  Government  services  and\ndevolve  the  planning  and  management  functions  and  responsibilities  of  marine  and  coastal\nresources within Indonesia\u2019s territorial waters to the provincial and district governments. The Act\nprovides  incentives  to  local  governments  for  sustainable  management  of  natural  resources\nwithin their respective jurisdiction, and requires a revision of some existing laws and regulations\nto bring them into harmony with it. \n\n\f4\n\nb.\n\nInstitutional Framework\n\nA  large  number  of  Government  agencies  and  institutions  are  involved  in  planning  and\n13.\nmanaging \nresources.  These\nagencies/institutions  can  be  grouped  into  three  categories:  (i)  information  and  data  producers,\n(ii) data coordinators, and (iii) data users.\n\nincluding  marine  and \n\nresources, \n\ncoastal \n\nnatural \n\ni. \n\nInformation and Data Producers\n\n14.\n\nThe main information and data producers and suppliers are the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\nAgency for National Space and Aeronautics, mandated, among others, to receive\nand process satellite imagery on terrestrial and marine resources;\nCenter  for  Oceanographic  Research  and  Development,  mandated  to  undertake\nresearch  and  collect  data  relating  to  oceanology,  marine  biology,  and  marine\nenvironment;\nCentral Research Institute for Fisheries, responsible for conducting research on\nfisheries and other living aquatic resources;\n\n(iv)  Marine  Geological  Institute,  mandated  to  conduct  geological  and  geophysical\n\nsurveys and research, and publish the findings; and\nNational  Hydrographic  Service,  which  is  the  national  authority  for  collecting\nbathymetric data and preparing nautical charts and navigational publications.\n\n15.\nIn  addition,  a  number  of  ministries  and  agencies  collect  marine  and  coastal  resource\ndata  essentially  for  their  own  immediate  use  in  planning  specific  development  activities.  The\nmost important among these are (i) Ministry  of  Marine  Affairs  and  Fisheries  (MMAF),  (ii)\nMinistry of Home Affairs and Regional Autonomy (MOHA), (iii) Ministry of Communication, (iv)\nDirectorate General of Tourism, (v) State Ministry of Environment (LH), and (vi) National Agency\nfor Environmental Impact Management (BAPEDAL).\n\nii. \n\nData Coordinators\n\nThe  Agency  for  Assessment  and  Application  of  Technology  (BPPT)  and  National\n16.\nCoordinating  Agency  for  Survey  and  Mapping  (BAKOSURTANAL)  play  important  roles  in\ncoordinating  data  collection  and  dissemination.  BPPT  is  the  owner  of  three  marine  survey\nvessels\u2014Baruna  Jaya  I,  II,  and  III\u2014which  provide  support  to  all  agencies  involved  in  marine\ndata  collection.  BAKOSURTANAL  coordinates  national  activities  in  topographic  and  natural\nresources surveys, and produces and disseminates digital and hardcopy maps. The agency has\na division of marine mapping, which develops and evaluates the results of marine surveys and\ntidal monitoring.\n\niii.\n\nData Users\n\n17.\nThe  data  users  are  the  national  and  regional  development  planning  agencies\n(BAPPENAS and BAPPEDAs), Government line agencies, private investors in fisheries, tourism\nand  sea  communication,  and  educational \nthe\nmacroeconomic  framework  within  which  the  substance  and  scale  of  sector  programs  are\ndetermined. BAPPENAS uses highly aggregated data, much of which is denominated in value\nrather  than  physical  terms.  However,  as  the  pressure  on  physical  space  and  concerns  about\nenvironmental  quality  increase,  the  spatial  implications  of  economic  planning  are  now\nemphasized.  Provincial and district BAPPEDAs are major users of resource data. Other users\n\ninstitutions.  BAPPENAS \n\nformulates \n\n\famong  Government  agencies  include  the  Directorates  General  of  Fisheries,  Forestry,  Rural\nDevelopment,  and  Sea  Communication,  and  the  National  Law  and  Development  Agency\n(BPHN). BPHN has a database for laws, decrees, and regulations relevant to marine resources\nboth for the agency\u2019s own purposes and for dissemination.\n\n5\n\nc.\n\nPlanning Framework\n\ni. \n\nNational Planning\n\n18.\nAt  the  national  level,  natural  resources  planning  involves  the  formulation  of  a\nmacroeconomic  framework  where  individual  sector  goals  are  established  and  then  translated\ninto  budgetary  requirements.  The  principal  mode  of  implementation  has  been  a  25-year\nperspective plan and successive five-year plans. Within the framework of five-year plans, overall\ndevelopment policy priorities are coordinated by BAPPENAS. In the past, national development\npolicy formulation was undertaken in the context of macroeconomic development that, in turn,\nwas  translated  into  a  regional  economic  approach.  This  often  led  to  a  planning  system  that\noverlooked resource sustainability.\n\n19.\nOver the last decade, there has been a shift in emphasis, and the Government initiated\nmeasures  for  resource  evaluation  and  their  accounting  in  preparing  development  plans.  The\nmeasures  include  implementing  specific  programs  and  projects  to  enhance  the  capabilities  of\nconcerned Government agencies for data acquisition and exchange, and resource assessment.\nThe programs and projects include Regional Physical Planning Program for Transmigration, the\nADB-assisted  Land  Resource  Evaluation  and  Planning  Project  (LREP),8  Second  Land\nResources  Evaluation  Project  (LREP  II),9  Marine  Resources  Evaluation  and  Planning  Project\n(MREP),10  Coastal  Community  Development  and  Fisheries  Resources  Management  Project,11\nand  Coral  Reef  Rehabilitation  and  Management  Project  (COREMAP),12  and  the  United  States\nAgency  for  International  Development  (USAID)-assisted  Natural  Resources  Management\nProgram (NRMP). An important contribution of these programs and projects is the heightened\nawareness  created  among  the  planners  and  implementors  concerned  of  the  need  for\nsustainable use of resources. However, they covered only a small part of Indonesia\u2019s land and\nmarine areas, and much more efforts will be required to develop a comprehensive database and\nphysical plans for managing the country\u2019s marine and terrestrial resources.\n\nii.\n\nSector Planning\n\nSector planning at the national level is the responsibility of individual ministries. A major\n20.\nweakness  in  sector  planning  for  natural  resources,  including  marine  and  coastal  resources,  is\nthe  absence  of  adequate  information  on  which  to  base  resource  management  decisions.\nAnother weakness is the inability to identify intersector conflicts of interest for the same space.\nThis can be avoided through spatial planning, which provides a framework for identifying such\nconflicts,  selecting  optimal  use  of  the  space,  and  allocating  the  use  rights  to  the  authorized\nusers.\n\n                  \n\nLoan 730-INO, for $23.4 million, approved on 17 January 1985.\nLoan 1099-INO, for $52.7 million, approved on 19 September 1991.\n\n8 \n9 \n10  Loan 1203-INO, for $33 million, approved on 8 December 1992.\n11  Loan  1570/1571(SF)-INO,  for  $26  million  and  $15  million  equivalent  respectively,  approved  on  4  November\n\n1997.\n\n12  Loan 1613-INO, for $7 million, approved on 26 March 1998.\n\n\f6\n\niii.\n\nProvincial and District Planning\n\n21.\nProvincial  and  district  planning  is  the  responsibility  of  the  respective  BAPPEDAs  at\nprovincial  and  district  levels.  Provincial  BAPPEDA  is  responsible  to  the  governor  for  overall\nplanning at the provincial level and for coordinating sector plans prepared by provincial services\nof sector agencies. While BAPPEDA is referred to as a planning agency, in reality its role has so\nfar heavily focused on regional coordination of sector development initiatives. As the bulk of the\npublic  expenditures  funding  has  been  controlled  by  central  agencies,  resource  development\nplanning at provincial level has been essentially centrally directed. Nonetheless, ADB- and other\naid-assisted  projects  in  the  natural  resources  evaluation  and  planning  projects  have  assisted\nmany provincial BAPPEDAs in developing human resources and strengthening the capacity for\neffective  planning.  Significantly  greater  capacity  building  efforts  are  now  required  to  prepare\nBAPPEDAs  for  shouldering  the  significantly  greater  planning  functions  and  responsibilities\ndevolved to them under Regional Autonomy Act 22 of 1999.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n22.\nIn recent years, Indonesia has embarked on a series of reforms in social, political, and\neconomic  areas  as  well  as  in  Government  processes  and  institutions.  The  new  Government's\nstrategic  priorities  emphasize  national  unity,  macroeconomic  policies  to  support  economic\nrecovery, poverty reduction, agricultural and rural development, support for small and medium-\nsize enterprises, decentralization, and good governance. State Policy Guidelines for 1999-2000\ndictate  that  natural  resources  should  be  managed  to  ensure  that  their  carrying  capacity  is\npreserved for the welfare of present and future generations, and to protect the national wealth of\nbiodiversity. The guidelines require enacting legislation to provide for the gradual delegation of\nauthority  for  managing  natural  resources  to  the  local  level.  It  gives  special  attention  to  the\nempowerment  of  local  communities,  traditional  institutions,  and  nongovernment  institutions\n(NGOs) for natural resources management. National development agenda and sector strategies\nare to be formulated and reflected in a new five-year National Development Program (Propenas\n2001-2005) based on national guidelines.\n\n23.\nRecognizing the potential of the marine area and its status as a common global property,\nthe  Government  declared  improved  marine  resource  management  as  a  priority  of  the\nadministration.  The Government created  MMAF in 1999, with a pronounced vision of the sea\nas  the  nation\u2019s  future.    The  sector  policy  statement  covers  (i)  efficient  and  sustainable\nmanagement  of  maritime  resources,  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  damaged  coastal  and  marine\necosystems,  (iii)  sustainable  development  of  coastal  zone  and  territorial  waters  through\nimproved  spatial  planning,  (iv)  improvement  of  resource  database  and  modernization  of\ninformation  and  data  exchange  and  dissemination \nthe\nsocioeconomic conditions of the coastal community, and (vi) promotion of the maritime concept\nto the public and all stakeholders.\n\nimprovement  of \n\nfacilities,  (v) \n\n24.\nThe Government has reassigned the task of establishing and managing 30 million ha of\nmarine  conservation  areas  from  the  former  MOFEC  to  MMAF.  The  marine  reserves  are  to  be\nestablished  in  accordance  with  the  Biodiversity  Action  Plan  of  1993.  Lack  of  appropriate\nexpertise  in  MOFEC  previously  hampered  the  establishment  of  the  marine  reserves.  Within\nMMAF,  a  Directorate  General  of  Sea  Surveillance  and  Protection  was  established  exclusively\nfor  protecting  marine  reserves  and  enforcing  laws  and  regulations  in  harvesting  marine\nresources.\n\n\f7\n\nAs  part  of  its  poverty  reduction  program,  the  new  Government  has  given  priority  to\n25.\ndeveloping  viable  income-generating  activities  in  the  coastal  zone  and  small  islands,  targeting\nparticularly  artisanal  fishers  many  of  whom  live  in  poverty.  Emphasis  is  on  preparing  more\nlocation-specific criteria in determining investment opportunities.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\nInternational  Development  Agency \n\n26.\nExternal assistance to Indonesia\u2019s marine and coastal resources sector has come from a\nlarge  number  of  institutions  including  ADB,  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development\n(AusAID),  Canadian \nInternational\nCooperation Agency, Global Environmental Fund, German Technical Cooperation, USAID, and\nWorld Bank. ADB has been the lead funding agency in this sector followed by the World Bank\nand  CIDA.  To  date,  ADB  has  provided  20  loans  amounting  to  $555.6  million  for  16  projects.\nADB  has  also  provided  project  preparatory  and  advisory  TA  for  $7.1  million  to  the  sector.  Six\nprojects,  with  a  total  value  of  $207.9  million,  are  directly  related  to  the  proposed  Project  and\ncover  marine  science  education,  marine  resources  evaluation  and  planning,  mangrove\nrehabilitation,  estuarine  zone  conservation,  coastal  fisheries  resource  management,  and  coral\nreef  rehabilitation  and  management.  Earlier  projects  aimed  at  increased  fisheries  production\nhave  little  similarity  with  the  proposed  Project  in  objective  and  scope.  The  ADB-financed  loan\nand TA projects are listed in Appendix 2.\n\n(CIDA),  Japan \n\n27.\nThe World Bank provided $131.4 million for developing marine science and technology\nand rehabilitating coral reefs. CIDA has provided $73.3 million to the sector, including a strategy\nstudy for marine and coastal resources use and coastal environmental management. AusAID\u2019s\nassistance  of  $5.0  million  has  supported  coral  reef  rehabilitation  activities  initiated  under  ADB\nand World Bank funding. USAID-assisted NRMP, with an approved funding of $10.5 million, has\na  coastal  resources  management  component  focusing  on  process-oriented,  community-based\ninitiatives for rehabilitating mangroves and improving the coastal environment. Norway has been\nfinancing  the  preparation  of  nautical  charts  covering  the  Indonesian  exclusive  economic  zone\nand surveying primary international sea-lanes.\n\n28.\nIn  preparing  the  proposed  Project,  close  coordination  with  external  aid  agencies  and\nassisting  countries  has  been  maintained  to  ensure  complementarity  and  compatibility  and  to\navoid  overlaps.    Extensive  discussions  were  held  with  the  consultants  and  staff  of  ongoing\nprojects in the sector, particularly the USAID-assisted NRMP and CIDA-assisted Collaborative\nEnvironmental  Project \nthese\nprojects/program will provide valuable input in planning and implementing the proposed Project.\n\nindigenous  knowledge  gained \n\nIndonesia.  The \n\nin \n\nin \n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\nOf the 16 ADB-financed loan projects in the sector, 13 have been completed and 3 are\n29.\nin various stages of implementation. Of the completed projects, eight have been post-evaluated:\ntwo  were  rated  as  successful,  four  partly  successful,  and  two  unsuccessful.  All  the\npostevaluated projects relate to fisheries production activities, which are not directly related to\nthis Project. Experience in implementing the completed as well as ongoing projects was taken\ninto account in designing the proposed Project. Experience gained in three other ADB-financed\nprojects,  LREP,  LREP  II,  and  MREP  is  highly  relevant  to  the  proposed  Project  because  of\nsimilarity in the scope of works and involvement of common implementing agencies. From these\nand other ADB-financed projects, the following major lessons are incorporated in the Project.\n\n\f8\n\n1.\n\nProject Management and Implementation\n\n30.\nMajor  factors  that  adversely  affect  project  management  and  implementation  include  a\nmultiplicity  of  executing  agencies  (EA),  lack  of  coordination  among  the  participating  agencies,\nlack  of  qualified  staff,  and  delays  in  engaging  consultants  and  procuring  equipment  and\nmaterials. All three similar projects in the sector, (LREP, LREP II, and MREP) were affected to\nvarying  degrees  by  the  above  factors.  The  Project  will  be  managed  by  a  single  EA,  MMAF.\nMMAF  has  subsumed  the  functions  and  responsibilities  of  a  number  of  agencies  previously\nresponsible  for  the  sector.  To  coordinate  the  inputs  of  all  implementing  agencies  (IAs),  a\ntechnical team will be established in MMAF with qualified staff deputed by the IAs on a full-time\nbasis. MMAF is expected to have the full staff complement by the time project implementation\ncommences  in  early  2001.  Some  of  these  staff  may  lack  requisite  experience  and  will  need\ntraining  to  effectively  contribute  to  project  implementation.    Similarly,  provincial  and  district\nBAPPEDA  staff,  who  will  play  a  key  role  in  resource  planning  activities,  lack  adequate\nexperience and will require training. The project design provides for extensive training of staff of\nMMAF, BAPPEDAs and other agencies to enhance their knowledge base and skills.\n\n2. \n\nProject Ownership\n\n31.\nDevelopment priorities determined at central level often result in lack of ownership at the\nregional  level  and  impede  project  implementation  and  achievement  of  objectives.  Care  has\nbeen taken to develop project ownership by involving the regional governments and institutions\nin  project  preparation  and  incorporating  their  views  and  priorities  in  project  design  and\nimplementation  arrangements.  This  is  reflected  in  the  project  scope,  which  includes,  unlike  in\nMREP, a component for implementing small-scale natural resources management schemes to\nbe  identified  in  the  management  plans  for  the  priority  marine  and  coastal  management  areas\n(MCMAs)  in  the  participating  provinces.  The  MCMAs  were  selected  by  the  provinces  and\ndistricts  concerned,  rather  than  the  national  sector  agencies,  following  a  set  of  agreed-upon\nselection criteria. Field-level implementation of project activities will be by provincial and district\nBAPPEDAs  and  sector  agencies  concerned,  with  MMAF  acting  primarily  as  facilitator  and\ncoordinator.  Project  ownership  at  the  local  level  has  been  further  enhanced  by  the  ensuing\nadministrative  and  fiscal  decentralization,  which  will  also  require  local  governments  to  share\nfunding responsibility for the Project with the national Government.\n\n3. \n\nPrivate and Community Participation\n\nAdequate  private  and  community  participation  in  design  and  implementation  enhances\n32.\ntransparency and efficiency of project implementation and improves sustainability. The Project\nwill therefore encourage qualified private entities, in addition to Government agencies, to supply\nresource  data  on  a  competitive  basis.  This  will  be  a  departure  from  the  previous  practice  of\ncarrying  out  mostly  similar  activities  through  force  account  contracts  by  government  agencies.\nThe Project will provide for a public participation program, to be established within BAPPEDAs,\nto discuss the sequence of spatial plans during their preparation and implementation; and for a\nreview of laws and regulations relating to allocation, use, and management of natural resources,\nand their enforcement. Priority site-specific development activities, identified in the district action\nplans,  will  be  planned  and  implemented  largely  by  local  communities,  with  technical  guidance\nprovided by NGOs, and local government technical agencies.\n\n\f9\n\n \n\n4.\n\nAnalysis of Data User Needs and Options\n\n33.\nIn a multilocation and multicomponent project, prior assessment of data and information\nneeds for resource planning is not feasible, and predetermined data needs often result in waste\nof  financial  resources  and  implementation  delays.  The  project  design  recognizes  that  (i)  the\nneeds of individual provinces/districts may differ; (ii) the stages of the spatial planning process\nrequire  differing  scale,  accuracy,  and  content;  and  (iii)  many  options  exist  for  data  collection.\nThe Project provides for various survey and mapping options and the appropriate ones will be\nselected  based  on  a  detailed  user  needs  analysis  in  the  first  few  years  of  project\nimplementation.\n\nE. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n34.\nADB\u2019s operations in Indonesia since the recent financial crisis have been guided by an\ninterim  operational  strategy  (IOS).  Covering  the  period  1998-2000,  the  strategy  emphasizes\ngovernance  reform  (especially  anticorruption,  decentralization,  and  corporate  governance)  in\nthe  financial  and  key  real  and  social  sectors,  support  to  social  safety  nets  and  social\ndevelopment, sustainable resource management, and rehabilitation of physical infrastructure. A\nnew  country  operational  strategy  (COS)  is  being  prepared,  and  poverty  reduction,  balanced\nregional  development,  good  governance,  and  sustainable  resource  management  and\nenvironmental protection are expected to be major priorities.\n\n35. Within  the  framework  of  IOS,  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  marine  and  coastal  resources\nsector  in  Indonesia  focuses  on  resource  evaluation,  planning,  and  sustainable  management;\nenvironmental  protection;  development  of  human  resources;  and  support  for  decentralized\nresource management. The sector activities are also guided by ADB\u2019s fisheries policy,13 which\nemphasizes developing appropriate policy and institutional environment and capacity building to\nenable its developing member countries to optimize utilization and sustainable management of\nfisheries  and  aquatic  resources.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  fisheries  sector  is  anchored  on  three\nbasic  objectives:  (i)  sustainability  in  conserving  and  utilizing  aquatic  resources;  (ii)  equity  in\nbalancing  the  interests  of  competing  users;  and  (ii)  eficiency  in  developing  and  managing\naquatic resources.  The private sector and local communities are expected to play a central role\nin  production  and  distribution  while  governments  should  be  responsible  principally  for\nestablishing \nto  support  sustainable\nmanagement  of  resources.  Combating  widespread  overfishing  and  the  depletion  of  resources,\nincreasing degradation of fishing grounds, and poverty among artisanal fishers are key areas for\nADB support.\n\ninstitutional,  and  regulatory \n\nthe  policy, \n\nframework \n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nThe  natural  resources  sector  is  important  in  ADB's  operations  in  Indonesia,  and  ADB\n36.\nhas remained engaged in policy dialogue with the Government on the key sector issues. Policy\ndialogue in recent years and during the preparation of the Project  covered three major areas.\n\n1.\n\nInstitutional Reform\n\n37.\nA  major  institutional  issue  in  the  marine  and  coastal  resources  sector  was  the\ninvolvement of a plethora of agencies in resource management, with no single agency being the\nmajor stakeholder. The need for institutional reform was examined under the TA for preparing\n\n13  ADB\u2019s Policy on Fisheries was considered by the Board in October 1997.\n\n                  \n\n\f10\n\nthe proposed Project and the findings supported the Government\u2019s decision to create a ministry\ntasked  with  marine  and  coastal  resources  management.  MMAF  was  established  in  1999  in\naccordance  with  these  recommendations.    In  addition,  following  the  experience  in  MREP  and\nBiodiversity  Conservation  in  Flores  and  Siberut  Project,  ADB  recommended  that  responsibility\nfor  marine  protected  areas  should  be  transferred  from  MOFEC  to  MMAF.  This  transfer  was\naccomplished in early 2000.\n\n38.\nA major constraint on institutional strengthening in Indonesia is the frequent changes in\nstructural staff positions, which result in technically inexperienced personnel moving into senior\ntechnical positions.  ADB, through LREP II and MREP, has been working with MOHA and the\nMinistry  of  Manpower  Planning  in  creating  a  set  of  core  functional  positions  in  the  provincial\nBAPPEDAs  and  developing  a  career  path  for  these  functional  staff.  So  far,  100  functional\npositions for spatial planning have been created at selected BAPPEDAs so that staff can remain\nin a technical career stream and benefit from professional training provided through the projects.\n\n2.\n\nGovernance\n\nDuring  project  preparation,  extensive  discussions  were  held  with \n\n39.\nthe  national\nGovernment,  local  governments,  civil  society,  and  other  stakeholders  on  various  aspects  of\nADB policy on good governance, including anticorruption. Specific references were made to the\nanticorruption  action  plan  for  Indonesia,  prepared  in  mid-1999  by  the  Government  and  ADB.\nThe  Government  reiterated  its  commitment  to  combat  corruption  and  agreed  to  adopt  all\nfeasible  measures  to  improve  transparency,  competitiveness,  and  accountability  in  project\nimplementation.  Some  of  these  measures  have  been  built  into  the  project  design  and  include\ndecentralization  and  greater  local  government  control  over  the  Project,  involvement  of  civil\nsociety  and  community \nimplementation,  and  recruitment  of  a\ngovernance/procurement  specialist  to  ensure  that  procurement  follows  a  transparent  and\ncompetitive procedure.\n\nin  project  design  and \n\n3.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Framework\n\n40.\nSpatial Planning Act 24/92 provides the framework and legal basis for natural resources\nplanning  and  resource  allocation  using  modern  concepts  and  technologies.  However,  the  Act\nneeds amendment to be in harmony with the provisions of Act 22/99 on regional autonomy and\nto  enhance  its  effectiveness  in  resource  allocation  and  management.  There  are  other  natural\nresources laws, including laws relating to the administrative jurisdiction of relevant government\ndepartments and regional authorities over mangrove forests and their management, which also\nneed to be examined and checked for their consistency with Act 22/99 and any revisions to Act\n24/92. Also, the laws relating to traditional rights of ownership of natural resources, and rights\nand  procedures  for  compensation  for  loss  of  natural  resources  need  to  be  examined  and\nrevised. The need to revise these laws and regulations and improve the overall law enforcement\nregime  in  the  natural  resources  sector  was  discussed  with  the  Government.  The  Government\nagreed to include in the Project a component to assist it in initiating the revision of relevant laws\nand regulations and institutionalizing necessary measures to enhance law enforcement.\n\n\f11\n\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nMarine  and  coastal  resources  provide  for  the  welfare  of  60  percent  of  Indonesia\u2019s\n41.\npopulation in the coastal plains. However, the resources have not been properly managed and\nhave been depleted by (i) overfishing and destructive fish production methods; (ii) siltation and\npollution  from  land-based  activities  such  as  aquaculture,  agriculture,  forestry,  industry,  and\nmining;  and  (iii)  coastal  development  spurred  by  urbanization,  and  increased  tourism  and\nindustrial development. These activities alter the biological mix of living resources, damage the\necosystems,  and  degrade  water  quality.  Past  decades  have  seen  continued  degradation  of\ncoastal areas. It is becoming increasingly clear that the coastal zones can be protected only if\nresource  managers  adopt  some  form  of  integrated  coastal  zone  planning  and  management\n(ICZPM).  Effective  management  will  have  to  include  all  the  systems  that  contribute  to  the\nstability and biological health of coastal region:  river basins, forests, farms, and upstream urban\nareas.  Spatial  Planning  Act  24/92  provides  the  legal  basis  for  a  physical  planning  framework\nwithin  which  such  integrated  development  can  take  place.  However,  a  substantial  amount  of\ninstitutional  strengthening  will  be  required  for  making  an  inventory  of  the  resource  base,\nundertaking  the  physical  planning,  achieving  transparency  in  allocation  of  resources,  clarifying\nlegal  provisions,  giving  recognition  to  traditional  rights  of  local  communities  to  resources,\nenhancing  institutional  capacity  to  reduce  conflicts  among  users,  and  enforcing  an  effective\nmonitoring, control, and surveillance system.\n\n42.\nThe  fall  of  the  New  Order  Administration  in  the  wake  of  the  recent  financial  crisis\nushered  in  a  new  phase  in  managing  natural  resources  and  the  environment  in  Indonesia.\nRecent laws on regional autonomy (Act 22/99) and sharing of revenue by national and regional\ngovernments  (Act  25/99)  paved  the  way  for  increased  decentralization.  Under  the  new\nlegislation,  provincial  and  district  governments  should  rapidly  recognize  the  need  for  arresting\nfurther degradation of natural resources and managing it sustainably for the benefit of the State\nand  the  community.  The  laws  give  the  provinces  and  districts  expanded  authority  to  explore,\nexploit  and  manage  the  terrestrial  and  marine  wealth  within  their  jurisdiction.  The  laws  also\nincrease  the  sense  of  ownership  of  natural  resource  at  local  government  level,  provide\nenhanced opportunities for community participation, and increase the prospect of transparency\nin  allocating  and  using  natural  resources.  However,  sustainable  management  of  resources  in\nthe changed context will require capacity building at the local level followed by implementation\nof  complementary  programs/projects  addressing  related  policy  and  institutional  issues.  Unless\nlocal  planners  are  able  to  make  proper  inventory  of  the  resource  base,  identify  the  related\nproblems  and  issues,  and  work  out  a  plan  for  allocating  and  managing  resources  on  a\nsustainable  basis  and  guide  the  decision-making  process  accordingly,  the  resource  may  be\nused for short-term gains with serious implications for long-term viability.\n\n43.\nThe  Project  provides  for  capacity  building  at  the  local  level  to  effectively  carry  out  the\nfunctions  and  responsibilities  devolved  to  the  regions  for  managing  marine  and  coastal\nresources.  It  builds  on  the  lessons  learned  from  previous  projects  and  formulates  a\ncomprehensive  program  for  expansion  of  the  integrated  planning  concept  in  the  participating\nprovinces.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n44.\nThe  objectives  of  the  Project  are  sustainable  management  of  marine  and  coastal\nresources  and  biodiversity,  and  protection  of  the  environment  in  a  decentralized  framework  of\n\n\f12\n\ngovernment.  The  Project  includes  (i)  strengthening  local  capacity  to  plan  and  manage  marine\nand coastal resources sustainably, (ii) improving the availability of and access to quality spatial\nand  biodiversity  data  and  information,  (iii)  improving  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for\nresource management and compliance, (iv) using ICZPM to identify viable alternative income-\ngenerating  activities  in  coastal  zones,  and  (v)  improving  socioeconomic  and  environmental\nconditions in selected coastal habitats.\n\n45.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  following  15  provinces,  or  such  other  provinces  as\nthe Government and ADB may agree: (i) North Sumatra; (ii) West Sumatra; (iii) South Sumatra;\n(iv) Riau; (v) Bengkulu; (vi) Lampung; (vii) West Kalimantan; (viii) Central Kalimantan; (ix) South\nKalimantan;  (x)  East  Kalimantan;  (xi)  North  Sulawesi;  (xii)  Central  Sulawesi;  (xiii)  South\nSulawesi;  (xiv)  Southeast  Sulawesi;  and  (xv)  West  Nusa  Tenggara.  The  provinces  were\nselected  considering  a  range  of  coastal  types  and  ecosystems  and  varying  levels  of\nsocioeconomic  conditions  in  the  provinces,  and  the  commitment  shown  by  the  provincial\nauthorities.\n\nThe  Project  will  provide  for  ICZPM  initiatives  for  a  priority  marine  and  coastal\n46.\nmanagement  area  in  each  province,  covering  about  2-5  districts.  MCMAs  were  selected  in\naccordance with criteria given in Appendix 3. The selection criteria combine environmental and\nsocial issues to provide an optimal level of environmental, economic, and social benefits. Of an\nestimated 15 million poor living in the 15 project provinces, about 8 million live in the 42 districts,\nthe  whole  or  part  of  which  will  constitute  the  project  MCMAs.14  Ten  of  the  15  MCMAs  have\npoverty  incidence  exceeding  30  percent,  against  the  national  poverty  incidence  of  23  percent.\nMalnutrition  rates,  as  measured  against  weight-for-age  for  children  under  the  age  of  five,\nexceed  20  percent  in  most  of  the  districts  of  the  project  MCMAs,  and  exceed  40  percent  in\npoverty-stricken  districts  in  10  MCMAs.    Expenditures  on  food  were  estimated  to  be  60-90\npercent of all monthly expenditures, with little remaining for nonfood basic needs. Key indicators\nof  poverty  in  the  15  provinces  and  the  MCMAs  are  in  Appendix  4.  At  the  beginning  of  project\nimplementation,  the  selected  MCMAs  will  be  further  reviewed,  with  involvement  of  various\nstakeholders at regional and local levels. If required, adjustments in their geographic coverage\nwill be made in consultation with ADB.\n\nThe project components are (i) coastal marine resources planning and management, (ii)\n47.\nspatial  data  and  information  management,  (iii)  marine  and  coastal  resources  laws  and\nenforcement, and (iv) small-scale natural resources management schemes.\n\n1.\n\nCoastal Marine Resources Planning and Management\n\n48.\nThis  component  will  promote  ICZPM  by  improving  and  strengthening  the  planning  and\nmanagement  capacity  of  provincial  and  district  BAPPEDAs  and  selected  sector  agencies\ninvolved in assessing and conserving marine resources. ICZPM is a process of governance and\nconsists  of  the  legal  and  institutional  framework  necessary  to  ensure  that  development  plans\nand  programs  are  prepared  with  the  participation  of  those  affected.  A  planning  hierarchy\ninvolving  the  sequential  development  of  a  strategy  plan,  zoning  plan,  management  plan,  and\naction  plans,  will  form  the  basis  of  ICZPM  activities  (Appendix  5).  The  strategy  plan  identifies\nprovincial  and  district  planning  issues,  establishes  the  agreed-upon  directions  and  expected\n\n                  \n\n14  These  estimates  were  based  on  the  February  1999  survey  conducted  by  the  Bureau  of  Statistics.  Per  capita\nmonthly  expenditures  on  a  consumption  bundle  containing  both  food  and  nonfood  items  were  compared  with\nprovince-specific poverty lines.\n\n\f13\n\noutcomes  for  planning  and  management,  and  sets  a  clear  basis  for  organization,  control,  and\ncommunication  of  planning.  The  zoning  plan  provides  for  allocation  of  coastal  and  marine\nresources in accordance with the zones\u2019 primary intent  and determines (i) permitted activities,\nor conditional activities, which are compatible with the primary intent; and (ii) activities that are\nnot  permitted  due  to  their  incompatibility.  The  management  plan  provides  for  the  protection  of\nenvironmentally  sensitive  and  conservation  areas,  addresses \nlegal\nconstraints  to  plan  implementation,  and  sets  out  ways  to  educate  and  involve  the  public  and\nlocal government in resource management. An important outcome of the management planning\nprocess  is  identifying  at  a  conceptual  level  an  integrated  package  of  specific  projects  or\nprograms that address identified management issues. The action plan then provides details of\nthe  programs  and  projects  (such  as  objectives,  scope,  costs,  implementation  arrangements,\nbenefits, etc.) and forms the basis for implementation.\n\ninstitutional  or \n\nthe \n\n49.\nAlthough the Project will focus on marine and coastal resources, the inland boundary for\nplanning  will  be  the  nearest  watershed  divide  (Appendix  5),  and  physical  planning  will  be\nundertaken for a significant part of inland areas along coastlines. Inland boundaries extending\nfrom  the  divide  to  the  coastline  will  allow  integration  of  data  sets  produced  under  previous\nnatural resources planning projects (e.g., LREP and LREP II). An entire island may be covered\nif it is small.\n\n 50. Workshops and consultation meetings with sector agencies, civil society, and the public\nwill be organized to review and discuss (i) data needs, and surveys and mapping requirements;\nand (ii) strategic planning process and developing the hierarchy of plans. Other topics may be:\n(i)  increasing  understanding  of  the  application  of  geographic  information  system  (GIS)\ntechnology  in  planning  and  management,  (ii)  techniques  in  developing  public  participation\nprograms,  (iii)  natural  resource  accounting  and  its  use  for  planning  purposes,  and  (iv)  priority\narea planning at a semidetailed level.\n\n2.\n\nSpatial Data and Information Management\n\n51.\nThe planning and management activities will be supported by collecting additional data\nand information, and installing hardware and software facilities to facilitate access to data and\ninformation  by  planners  and  decision  makers.  Regional  government  planners  will  specify  the\nthematic data they need for planning, and will contract the supply of data in a specific format,\ndelivery  modes,  and  timetable.  The  four  subcomponents  are:  (i)  surveys  and  mapping,  (ii)\ninformation technology, (iii) spatial data infrastructure, and (iv) national biodiversity information\nnetwork (NBIN).\n\na.\n\nSurveys and Mapping\n\nThe  Project  will  provide  for  new  surveys,  creation  of  new  mapping  products,  and\n52.\npurchase and value-added processing of existing data and information. Data requirements will\nbe satisfied by a user needs analysis conducted by the BAPPEDAs in the early stages of project\nexecution,  immediately  following  the  confirmation  of  the  boundary  of  the  MCMAs.  The  design\nmethodology  recognizes  that  (i)  the  data  needs  of  different  planning  stages  and  individual\npriority  areas  may  differ;  (ii)  the  availability  of  existing  data  is  varied;  and  (iii)  advances  in\ntechnology, especially through remote sensing, may offer new options during project execution.\n\nThe  outputs  will  include  various  base  and  thematic  maps,  organized  according  to\n53.\nplanning  issues  or  planning  themes,  for  the  entire  planning  area.  The  major  themes  may\ninclude, but will not be limited to, the following:\n\n\f14\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nbaseline topographic and bathymetric maps that combine existing land and sea\nmaps and charts;\n\nmarine  geology  including  coastal  geology,  coastal  geomorphology,  and  areas\nsusceptible to tsunami;\n\nfisheries  including  fisheries  infrastructure,  fisheries  resources,  coastal  water\nquality, and mariculture areas;\n\nsea  transportation  including  local  and  international  shipping  lanes  and  ports,\nanchorage areas, and navigation aids;\n\ncoastal  mining  and  oil  exploration,  including  existing  and  proposed  mining\noperations;\n\n(vi) \n\ncurrent and proposed industrial sites and infrastructure; and\n\n(vii) \n\ntourism including significant natural and cultural sites, existing infrastructure, and\nproposed developments.\n\nb.\n\nInformation Technology\n\ninformation \n\nThe Project will provide the hardware/software and training needs of the EA and IAs for\n54.\nan  efficient \ninclude  (i)  equipping\nprovincial/district  BAPPEDAs  with  modern  GIS  facilities,  (ii)  formal  on-the-job  training  to\nBAPPEDA staff in the use of GIS facilities and related technologies, and (iii) equipping national\nand provincial project offices with basic office technology and basic GIS viewing software.\n\ntechnology  system.  Project \n\ninputs  will \n\nc.\n\nSpatial Data Infrastructure\n\n55.\nThe  subcomponent  will  enhance  the  continued  development  of  spatial  data  standards,\nexchange protocols, and metadata catalogues started under LREP II and MREP to provide an\ninfrastructure by which all Indonesian spatial data can be catalogued for locating, purchase, and\neventual  delivery  over  the  Internet.  Project  support  will  include  developing  infrastructure  for\nlocating  existing  spatial  data  in  all  agencies  by  end  users,  and  promoting  and  enhancing  sale\nand/or  dissemination  of  spatial  data  by  central  agencies  through  provincial  outlets.15  The\nspecific  inputs,  which  will  complement  ongoing  efforts  at  BAKOSURTANAL  and  facilitate  the\ndevelopment  of  infrastructure  for  an  Internet-based  dissemination  network,  will  include  (i)\nestablishment  of  a  Technical  Advisory  Group,  comprising  representatives  from  major  spatial\ndata-supplying  agencies,  private  industry,  and  NGOs,  to  guide  the  development  of  an\nIndonesian  spatial  data  infrastructure  and  to  develop  metadata  standards  and  protocols,  (ii)\ninstalling an Internet web server facility, aimed at locating and disseminating all spatial data held\nin  government  agencies;  (iii)  streamlining  internal  BAKOSURTANAL  specifications  and\nprocedures \nthe\nBAKOSURTANAL  map  distribution  outlets  to  the  provinces,  including  on-line  ordering  and\npurchases.\n\ntheir  own  digital  data  products;  and \n\n(iv)  expanding \n\nto  enhance \n\n15    BAKOSURTANAL recently contracted with 12 retail outlets to sell its mapping products. It also has an on-line\n\n                  \n\ncatalogue and defined product price lists.\n\n\f15\n\nd.\n\nNational Biodiversity Information Network\n\n56.\nAs  part  of  information  management,  the  Project  will  establish  NBIN  with  the  aim  of  (i)\nimproving  the  exchange  of  information  on  marine  and  coastal  biodiversity  among  related\ngovernment  agencies,  (ii)  promoting  public  involvement  in  biodiversity  protection,  and  (iii)\nsupplying  information  required  for  spatial  planning  and  implementing  the  National  Biodiversity\nAction Plan. The database to be established under the Project will focus on marine and coastal\nbiodiversity, and will be provided by a group of core organizations for NBIN.\n\n57.\nAt  the  national  level,  more  than  10  government  agencies  share  responsibility  for\nbiodiversity  management  and  produce  or  process  information  on  biodiversity.  In  addition,\nresearch  institutes,  universities,  and  NGOs  hold  various  data  sets  on  biodiversity.  While\ninformation about biodiversity exists at different levels and in different types, the linkages among\ndifferent stakeholders have not been effective and government agencies have little experience\nin sharing information in a systematic and transparent way. The Indonesian Institute of Sciences\n(LIPI)  and  its  research  centers,  MMAF,  and  selected  universities,  and  NGOs  will  be  core\nmembers of a NBIN association. Membership to the association could be expanded over time.\nIndividual members will be responsible for retaining and updating their own databases.\n\n58.\nThe Project will support NBIN through the following activities: (i) establish an association\nof NBIN core organizations engaged in biodiversity management activities; (ii) equip them with\nnecessary hardware, software, and training so that they have the capacity to fully participate in\nand  benefit  from  the  network;  (iii)  provide  technical  support  for  improving  data  quality  and\nreliability; (iv) establish a national committee for biological data-sharing standards; and (v) link\nNBIN  through  Internet  to  the  international  biodiversity  networks  and  the  Global  Clearinghouse\nMechanism under the Convention on Biological Diversity.\n\n3. \n\nLegislative Review and Law Enforcement\n\n59.\nThe  component  aims  at  strengthening  the  legal  framework  for  managing  natural\nresources,  particularly  marine  and  coastal  resources,  and  improving  the  law  enforcement\nregime in the sector. The Project will provide for (i) reviewing existing laws and traditional rights\nand  practices  relating  to  the  management  of  natural  resources;  (ii)  determining  the  need  to\nchange existing laws or relevant regulatory mechanisms to promote more effective enforcement\nof  such  laws,  or  to  enact  new  laws  to  be  consistent  with  the  national  guidelines  on  natural\nresources management and to recognize traditional rights; and (iii) assisting the Government in\ndrafting changes to existing legislation or enacting new ones in consultation with stakeholders.\nPriority attention will be given to revising laws regulating fisheries and other marine and coastal\nresources, including sustainable use and protection measures for mangroves, coral reefs, and\nsea grass areas, and will specifically include laws related to spatial planning and jurisdiction of\nrelevant ministries and regional governments over coastal lands classified as mangrove forests.\n\n60.\nTo improve the law enforcement regime of integrated resource management, the Project\nwill  help  (i)  develop  appropriate  mechanisms  for  interagency  coordination;  (ii)  institutionalize\nprocedures  and  practices  for  transparency  and  participation  in  decision-making  processes  for\nresource allocation and management; (iii) translate environmental protection issues identified in\nplans/studies  into  binding  conditions  of  licenses  and  approval;    and  (iv)  develop  effective\ninstitutionalized  mechanisms  for  continuing  adequate  levels  of  funding  and  provide  personnel\nand other resources for regulatory and law enforcement activities. Resource allocation through\nresource consents, resource permits, and licensing will be defined and included in management\n\n\f16\n\nplanning  activities  and  form  a  critical  implementation  mechanism  for  provincial  and  district\nICZPM plans.\n\n4. \n\nSmall-Scale Natural Resources Management Schemes\n\n61.\nComplementing capacity building for sustainable management planning, the component\nwill  support  implementation  of  a  range  of  small-scale,  priority  activities  consistent  with  the\nproject objectives and the hierarchy of spatial plans. Selected activities will support district and\nsubdistrict  decentralization,  particularly  devolution  of  responsibility  for  resource  management.\nThe  schemes  will  be  selected  and  implemented  following  a  process  approach,  with  active\nparticipation  of  stakeholders,  thus  demonstrating  the  tangible  value  of  ICZPM.  Typically  the\nschemes will (i) involve coastal fisheries resources management (CFRM) including rehabilitation\nof  damaged  fish  habitats  (i.e.,  mangroves,  coral  reefs,  and  sea  grass  areas);  (ii)  improve  the\ncoastal  environment  including  control  of  pollution,  siltation  and  erosion;  and  (iii)  develop\nalternative livelihood activities for artisanal  fishers.\n\nThe activities will be supported by an innovative outreach program of adaptive research\n62.\nand extension initiatives to identify viable income-generating activities for the coastal community\nand  to  manage  coastal  ecosystems  on  a  sustainable  basis.  Research  and  extension  activities\nwill be conducted by domestic research agencies, technology centers, and NGOs specializing in\ncoastal  fisheries,  mariculture,  coral  reef  protection  and  management,  coastal  vegetation  and\necosystems.  The  research  and  extension  topics  will  be  selected  from  proposals  submitted  by\nthe agencies and centers. Criteria for evaluating these proposals are (i) adherence to principles\nof  sustainable  management  of  the  marine  and  coastal  resources,  (ii)  responsiveness  to\nidentified  issues  facing  coastal  and  small  island  communities,  (iii)  focus  on  community-based\nactivities and poverty reduction, (iv) transparency in administrative accountability and conduct of\nactivities, and (v) proven capability of the agencies or NGOs to undertake the proposed tasks.\n\nTo improve the eligibility of project-assisted alternative livelihood activities for funding by\n63.\nexisting credit schemes, agricultural extension workers and local community organizers will link\nthe  organized  communities  to  existing  financing  schemes  operating  in  the  area,  train  them  in\ncredit management and utilization, and business management and operation.\n\n64.\nTypically,  the  costs  of  the  individual  schemes  will  range  from  $50,000  to  $200,000,\nincluding  beneficiaries'  contribution  of  labor,  materials,  and  in-kind  capital.  Four  investment\nschemes were identified within MCMAs of the MREP. The schemes will be implemented as pilot\nschemes  only  after  the  management  plans  and  action  plans  of  the  respective  MCMAs  have\nbeen fully developed under the Project and subjected to public scrutiny and review. Additional\nschemes will be identified under the management and action plans to be prepared for the new\nMCMAs meeting the selection criteria and approval procedure given in Appendix 6.\n\nThe  component  will  also  provide  for  the  planning  and  management  of  marine  parks,16\n65.\nencompassing  both  conservation  and  economic  development  objectives.  Works  will  include  (i)\nselecting  and  establishing  parks  and  developing  community-based  management  units;  and  (ii)\ndeveloping  and  improving  the  provincial  marine  and  coastal  biodiversity  database.  A\ncommunity-based  system  for  monitoring,  control,  and  surveillance  (MCS)  of  marine  parks  and\nCFRM activities will be established. The MCS will be based on the model being developed for\nCOREMAP.\n\n16  Action  plans  developed  for  selected  marine  protected  areas  under  MREP  will  be  reviewed  and  implemented\n\n                  \n\nunder the Project.\n\n\f17\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n66.\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $70.2  million  equivalent,  comprising  $23\nmillion in foreign exchange and $47.2 million equivalent in local currency. The estimates include\nthe  provision  of  $6.1  million  equivalent  in  taxes  and  duties.  A  summary  of  the  project  cost\nestimates is given in Table 1.

The  exchange  rate  for  the  base\ncost is at $1.00 = Rp8,000. Local inflation rates are projected at 7.0 percent annually for 2001-2002, and at 5.0\npercent thereafter. Foreign inflation rates are projected at 2.5 percent annually for 2001-2006.\nInterest charges at 1.0 percent per annum during the project implementation period of six years.\n\n67.\nIn view of Indonesia\u2019s economic difficulties and fiscal constraints in the short- to medium-\nterm,  the  Government  requested  that  ADB\u2019s  share  in  project  financing  be  increased  from  60\npercent  to  80  percent  as  an  interim  measure.  Although  Indonesia\u2019s  economic  recovery\ncontinues, the economic situation remains difficult.  Public debt increased to 93 percent of the\nGDP, and the Government\u2019s fiscal situation is expected to remain unfavorable over the medium\nterm. Given the difficult situation, it is proposed that ADB finance 80 percent of the project cost\nduring  the  first  three  years  of  project  implementation  and  revert  to  60  percent  financing  in  the\nfourth year. A similar financing arrangement is being proposed for all project loans for Indonesia\nto  be  considered  by  the  Board  in  2000.

The  World  Bank  currently  provides  75  percent  of  project\ncosts on a three-year rolling average and it is understood that a further increase in its share is\nbeing  considered.  The  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  currently  provides  about  85\npercent of project costs.\n\n68.\nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan to the Government in the amount of $50 million\nequivalent (71.3 percent of the total project cost) from its Special Funds resources to finance the\nentire foreign exchange cost of $23 million and a portion of the local currency cost amounting to\n$27  million  equivalent.  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8\nyears, with an interest charge of 1 percent per year during the grace period, and 1.5 percent per\nyear during the remaining term. Of the remaining local currency cost of $20.2 million equivalent,\nthe  Government  will  finance  $17.9  million  equivalent  and  the  participating  beneficiaries  of  the\nsmall-scale  natural  resources  management  scheme  component  will  finance  $2.3  million\nequivalent  in  the  form  of  labor,  local  materials,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.

The  PMO  will  be\nresponsible for, among others, overall planning and coordinating project activities, consolidating\nproject  budgets  for  various  provinces,  recruiting  consultants,  coordinating  procurement  of\nequipment and materials by respective IAs, staff training programs, loan disbursement, liaison\nwith  other  concerned  government  agencies  and  ADB,  project  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and\npreparing progress reports for submission to the national Government, provincial governments,\nand  ADB.  The  PMO  will  be  supported  by  a  technical  team  with  full-time  staff  drawn  from\nBAKOSURTANAL,  LIPI,  MOHA,  and  MMAF  or  other  relevant  agencies  and  institutions  in  the\nfollowing  fields  of  expertise:  (i)  marine  coastal  resources  planning,  (ii)  spatial  data  and\ninformation  technology,  (iii)  natural  resources  laws  and  enforcement,  and  (iv)  participatory\nmanagement of natural resources.\n\n72.\nAt  the  national  level,  overall  coordination  and  monitoring  of  project  activities  will  be\nundertaken  by  a  national  steering  committee  (NSC),  chaired  by  the  deputy  chairperson,\nRegional  and  Natural  Resources  Development  of  BAPPENAS.  The  EA,  IAs,  and  other\nparticipating agencies will be represented on the NSC at the director general level. The NSC will\nalso  advise  on  policies  and  will  meet  as  necessary  and  at  least  twice  a  year.  The  PMO  will\nserve as the secretariat for the NSC\n\nEach  participating  province  will  establish  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  within  the\n73.\nprovincial  BAPPEDA  to  manage  the  project  activities  within  its  jurisdiction.  The  PIU  will  be\nheaded  by  the  head  of  the  Physical  Planning  Division  of  BAPPEDA  and  will  include  at  least\nthree  functional  staff  in  natural  resources  planning  and  an  accountant;  some  PIUs  may  need\n\n\f20\n\nmore functional staff depending on the characteristics of the MCMAs in the province. The PIU\nresponsibilities  will  be  (i)  preparing  and  monitoring  the  project  program  for  the  province,\n(ii) obtaining  the  support  of  provincial  sector  agencies  concerned,  (iii)  coordinating  with  the\nPMO,    (iv)  consulting  local  communities  in  preparing  integrated  physical  plans  and  programs;\nand  (v)  maintaining  project  accounts  and  expenditure  statements  for  the  province.  In\nundertaking  physical  planning  activities  of  the  priority  areas,  the  PIU  will  be  assisted  by  a\nprovincial task force (PTF). The PTF will draw its members from the technical staff of provincial\nand  district  BAPPEDAs,  sector  agencies,  and  local  units  of  relevant  national  institutions  and\nresearch agencies.\n\n74.\nProvincial  activities  will  be  overseen  by  a  provincial  steering  committee  (PSC),  to  be\nestablished  in  each  participating  province  and  chaired  by  the  chairperson  of  the  provincial\nBAPPEDA.  PSC  members  will  include  the  chiefs  of  district  BAPPEDAs,  civil  society\nrepresentatives,  and  the  PIU  head.  The  PSC  will  meet  as  required,  but  at  least  once  in  each\nquarter.  If  a  PSC  has  already  been  established  in  a  participating  province  under  any\nsubstantially similar project, then it may also be designated as PSC in the province concerned\nfor  purposes  of  the  Project,  provided  its  composition  is  acceptable  to  ADB.  An  organization\nchart for project implementation and coordination is given in Appendix 8.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n75.\nThe Project will be implemented over six years commencing in early 2001 (Appendix 9).\nIn  2003,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly  undertake  a  midterm  review  of  the  Project  to\nassess  implementation  status,  review  the  project  parameters,  and  take  appropriate  measures\nincluding  modification  of  scope  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  reallocation  of  loan\nfunds as appropriate in light of implementation experience, to achieve the project objectives.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement\n\n76.\nGoods  and  services  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with\nthe  ADB  Guidelines for Procurement.  The  EA  and  IAs  have  been  advised  of  the  need  for\nmaintaining transparency and accountability, as required under ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy, in\nprocuring  all  goods  and  services.  The  EA  and  IAs  were  informed  that  the  ADB  anticorruption\nprovisions  (as  provided  in  ADB's  Guidelines for Procurement  and  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants) will apply to all expenditures financed under the proposed loan.  This means that:\n(i)  ADB  will  reject  a  proposal  for  award  if  the  proposed  bidder  is  found  to  have  engaged  in\ncorrupt  or  fraudulent  practices  in  competing  for  the  contract  in  question;  (ii)  any  expenditures\nincurred with or through corrupt or fraudulent practices will not be reimbursable; (iii) any firm or\nindividual found to have engaged in such practices will be declared ineligible, either indefinitely\nor  for  a  stated  period,  for  ADB-financed  contracts;  and  (iv)  where  such  practices  were\ncommitted  but  Government  did  not  take  timely  and  appropriate  remedial  action,  the  relevant\nportions of the loan may be cancelled.\n\n77.\nEach  supply  contract  for  equipment  and  materials  with  an  estimated  cost  of  $500,000\nequivalent or more will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB), and\neach contract with an estimated cost of less than $500,000 equivalent will be awarded on the\nbasis  of  international  shopping  (IS).  Minor  items  of  equipment  and  materials  costing  less  than\n$100,000  equivalent  each  will  be  procured  through  direct  purchase.  Civil  works  packages  for\nsmall-scale  natural  resources  management  schemes  are  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $50,000\neach, and will be undertaken with the participation of local communities and NGOs, employing\nlabor-intensive  technology.  Such  civil  works  contracts  will  be  awarded  in  accordance  with\n\n\f21\n\nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Survey and mapping contracts for MCMAs are estimated to cost\nless  than  $1,000,000  equivalent  each,  and  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive\nbidding in accordance with selection criteria and procedures acceptable to ADB. A tentative list\nof the major procurement packages is given in Appendix 10.\n\n78.\nThe PMO and each participating province will submit to ADB for review and approval the\ndraft  bid  documents  for  the  first  contract  for  procuring  equipment  and  materials  and  for\nundertaking  survey  and  mapping  in  MCMAs.  Similarly,  the  first  such  contract  proposed  for\naward and processed by the PMO and each participating province will be submitted to ADB for\nreview and approval.\n\n4.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n79.\nThe EA and IAs will have consulting services in developing implementation approaches,\nprocedures,  and  guidelines  for  project  activities  including  human  resources  development,\nvarious  studies,  investigations  and  data  collection,  information  management,  stakeholder\nparticipation, rationalization of regulatory measures, and cost recovery. To ensure economy and\nefficiency,  consultants  working  with  the  provinces  will  be  divided  into  three  regional  groups;\neach group will cover five provinces and will be located at a regional hub.\n\nThe  Project  will  require  an  estimated  1,435  person-months  of  consulting  services:  210\n80.\ninternational  and  1,225  domestic.  The  international  consulting  firms,  in  collaboration  with\ndomestic  consulting  firms  (as  requested  by  the  Government),  will  provide  the  services  under\nfour  packages:  (i)  project  management  and  coastal  resources  planning  and  management,\n(ii) spatial  data  and  information  management,  (iii)  legislative  review  and  law  enforcement,  and\n(iv) small-scale resource management schemes. The terms of reference for consulting services\nare  in  Appendix  11.  Consulting  firms  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging\ndomestic consultants.\n\n81.\nThe  Project  will  also  engage  NGOs  to  organize  and  assist  local  communities  in\nundertaking  small-scale  natural  resources  management  activities  in  the  priority  areas  and  in\naccessing existing rural finance schemes operating in the area for alternative livelihood activities\nto  be  promoted  under  the  Project.  The  NGOs  will  be  selected  on  a  competitive  basis  in\naccordance  with  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Special  studies  and  local  training  will  be\ncontracted out to research and educational institutions in accordance with competitive selection\ncriteria and procedures acceptable to ADB.\n\n5.\n\nAdvance Action\n\nThe consultants engaged under the project management and coastal resource planning\n82.\ngroup will play a critical role in ensuring timely commencement of project activities in early 2001.\nTherefore,  the  Government  requested  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  action  for  initiating  the\nrecruitment of this group of consultants soon after project appraisal by ADB. However, contracts\nfor consulting services will be signed only after the ADB loan becomes effective. It is understood\nthat approval of such advance action will not commit ADB to approve the Project or to finance\nany expenditure incurred for the Project.\n\n\f22\n\n6.\n\nTraining Services\n\n83.\nAs part of the capacity building measures to be supported under the Project, training will\nbe  provided  to  officials  of  national  Government  and  local  governments,  staff  of  technical\nagencies, selected NGOs, and targeted communities. The training program will include marine\nand coastal resource planning and management, natural resources accounting and its use for\nplanning  purposes,  coastal  marine  surveillance  and  monitoring,  remote  sensing  and  GIS,\ndatabase  management,  CFRM,  community  participation  and  development,  and  project\nmanagement.  The  project  provision  of  training,  based  on  present  assessment,  is  given  in\nAppendix  12.  The  program  provides  for  short-term  and  long-term  international  and  domestic\ntraining  including  degree  courses,  study  visits,  and  hands-on  training,  and  national,  regional,\nand  village-level  workshops.  The  training  needs  will  be  reassessed  in  the  first  year  of  project\nimplementation, and the program and training methods will be refined accordingly.\n\n84.\nBefore carrying out any training activities for formal and short-term education programs,\nthe  PMO  will  submit  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  the  training  plan  including  (i)  areas  for\nwhich training will be needed, the diploma and degree programs to be selected, the proposed\ninstitutions  to  be  attended,  and  the  contemplated  duration  of  training  activities;  (ii)  the\njustification  for  selecting  international  institutions  for  short-term  study  visits  and  the  proposed\ncompetitive  selection  criteria  for  local  training  institutions  and  international  degree  education\nprogram  institutions;  and  (iii)  trainee  selection  criteria  and  proposed  trainees.  The  degree\neducation program trainees will be required to serve the participating province concerned for at\nleast three years upon completion of the training.\n\n7.\n\nProject Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n85.\nTo  monitor  and  evaluate  the  operational  performance  of  the  agencies  and  institutions\ninvolved  and  the  benefits  achieved  from  project  investment,  MMAF  will,  in  consultation  with\nADB, establish an appropriate project monitoring and evaluation (PME) system within one year\nfrom  loan  effectiveness.  The  PME  will  encompass  (i)  monitoring  of  physical  and  financial\nprogress as well as economy and efficiency of key activities such as recruitment of consultants,\nprocurement  of  equipment  and  materials,  training  arrangements,  undertaking  of  surveys  and\ninvestigation,  data  and  image  acquisition,  preparation  of  integrated  management  plans  for\npriority  areas,  improvement  of  legal  and  regulatory/enforcement  framework,  planning  and\nimplementation  of  small-scale  natural  resources  management  schemes;  (ii)  monitoring  of  the\nlevel  and  adequacy  of  participation  of  various  stakeholders  including  local  communities  in\nproject  activities,  particularly  those  related  to  natural  resources  planning,  management,  and\ndevelopment;  (iii)  monitoring  of  the  Project\u2019s  social,  environmental,  and  economic  impact,\nincluding the establishment of benchmark information and data; (iv) assessing the effectiveness\nand  utilization  of  the  PSICs,  NBIN,  and  spatial  data  information  networking  at  national  and\nregional  levels;  and  (v)  developing  a  mechanism  for  incorporating  the  project  planning  and\nimplementing  the  knowledge  acquired  and  lessons  learned  in  similar  projects  in  the  sector.\nPME  reports  will  be  prepared  by  the  PMO  on  a  semiannual  basis.  Upon  completion  of  the\nProject,  the  project  impact  will  be  evaluated  in  accordance  with  a  schedule  and  terms  of\nreference to be mutually agreed upon with ADB.\n\n8.\n\nCost Sharing and Fund Flow\n\n Under agreed-upon arrangements, project loan funds will be provided directly from the\n86.\nMinistry of Finance (MOF) to the two levels of management: the PMO in Jakarta, and the PIUs\nat  the  provincial  level.  Project  funds  will  be  provided  as  earmarked  special  funds  allocation\n\n\f23\n\n(dana alokasi khusus)  budgets.  Appendix  13  illustrates  the  proposed  fund  flow  arrangements.\nThe  Government  assured  that  the  provision  of  funds  from  the  loan  proceeds  and  the\ncorresponding counterpart contributions necessary for financing project activities would continue\nthroughout  project  implementation  through  the  earmarked  special  funds  allocation  in  the\nnational budget, notwithstanding (i) any reallocation of authority or responsibility for channeling\nof  external  assistance  and  provision  of  corresponding  counterpart  contributions  between  the\nnational  Government  and  participating  provinces  and  districts;  or  (ii)  any  requirement  for\nproviding  matching  counterpart  contributions  for  funding  project  activities  from  participating\nprovinces and districts, arising from the full implementation of Act Nos. 22 and 25 of 1999.\n\n9.\n\nSpecial Account and Statement of Expenditure\n\nMOF\u2019s Directorate General of Budget will establish an imprest account, to be called the\n87.\nspecial account, at Bank Indonesia (BI) to expedite disbursement of loan proceeds, particularly\nfor  expenditures  under  small  contracts.  The  initial  deposit  will  be  based  on  the  estimated\nexpenditures  for  a  period  six  months,  but  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  $1  million.  ADB\u2019s\nstatement of expenditures (SOE) procedure will be followed to liquidate the special account and\nreimburse individual payments that do not exceed $50,000 equivalent. The special account and\nSOE procedure will be established and followed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement\nHandbook and detailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government and ADB.\n\n 10.\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\n88.\nThe  PMO  will  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  containing  a  summary  of  the\nphysical  and  financial  progress  achieved  under  the  Project,  problems  encountered  and  how\nthey were resolved, and the proposed program for the next quarter. Within three months after\nProject completion, the PMO will furnish ADB with a project completion report containing details\nof the activities completed vis-\u00e0-vis appraisal targets, actual costs, performance of consultants\nand contractors, effectiveness of the implementation arrangements, achievement of objectives,\nand lessons learned.\n\n89.\nThe Government has agreed that MMAF will establish and maintain separate accounts\nand  records  exclusively  for  the  Project  and  will  register  in  such  accounts  all  receipts  and\npayments for the Project in accordance with sound accounting principles and procedures. The\naccounts  and  financial  statements  for  each  fiscal  year,  including  the  special  account  and  the\nSOE records, will be audited by the sovereign audit agency of the Government or other auditors\nacceptable  to  ADB,  in  accordance  with  appropriate  auditing  principles.  The  Government  has\nfurther  agreed  to  submit  to  ADB,  not  later  than  nine  months  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year,\naudited financial statements of the previous year along with the auditor\u2019s report expressing the\nauditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  statements.  The  auditor\u2019s  report  will  also  include  the  auditor\u2019s  opinion\non  use  of  the  special  account  and  the  SOE  procedure.  Both  the  financial  statements  and\nauditor\u2019s report will be in the English language. The Government and MMAF were informed of a\nnew ADB policy on submission of audited accounts, which covers failure in submitting audited\naccounts  and  financial  statements  within  the  due  time.  A  formal  warning  will  be  issued  for\naccounts more than six months overdue and disbursements will be suspended for accounts that\nare 12 months overdue.\n\nF.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n90.\nMMAF  was  established  under  Presidential  Decree  No.  136  of  1999.  MMAF\u2019s  mandate\nincludes  (i)  coordinating  all  scientific,  economic,  and  socioeconomic  activities  in  Indonesia\u2019s\n\n\f24\n\nmarine  and  coastal  areas;  (ii)  coordinating  with  other  national  agencies  in  enacting,\nimplementing,  and  monitoring  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  use  of  marine  and  coastal\nresources;  (iii)  promoting  sustainable  management  of  marine  and  coastal  resources;  and  (iv)\nsupporting socioeconomic development in coastal zones. These responsibilities are shared by\nits five directorate generals of: (i) Harmonization of Research and Sea Exploration; (ii) Fisheries;\n(iii) Sea Surveillance and Protection; (iv) Coasts, Beaches, and Small Islands (DGCBSI); and (v)\nInstitutional  Capacity  Building.  The  Directorate  General  of  Fisheries  (DGF)  earlier  belonged  to\nthe  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  but  was  relocated  to  MMAF  with  all  staff  and  facilities.  DGF  is\nexecuting  the  ADB-financed  Coastal  Community  Development  and  Fisheries  Resources\nManagement Project (footnote 11). The four other directorate generals, including DGCBSI, are\nnew  and  their  staff  requirements  are  being  met  through  redeployment  from  relevant  agencies\nand \nfor  overall  project  management  and\nimplementation.  It  has  assembled  a  core  group  of  qualified  staff,  most  of  whom  worked  for\nprevious ADB projects in the sector. DGCBSI comprises the directorates of (i) Coasts, (ii) Small\nIslands,  (iii)  Spatial  Planning,  and  (iv)  Society  Empowerment.  While  all  the  four  directorates\nhave been involved in the project preparation and will provide support for its implementation, the\nDirectorate of Coasts has assumed PMO responsibility and its professional staff strength will be\nincreased  from  23  to  36  through  redeployment  by  January  2001.  In  addition,  the  PMO  will  be\nsupported by a technical team (TT) of 16 full-time staff drawn from MMAF and IAs. Eight staff\nhave already been appointed and the remaining eight staff will be engaged by 31 March 2001.\n\ninstitutions.  DGCBSI  will  be \n\nresponsible \n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n91.\nThe  Project,  as  a  whole,  has  a  strong  orientation  toward  sustainable  resource\nmanagement  and,  therefore,  should  have  minimal  adverse  environmental  impacts.  However,\nactivities  in  the  small-scale  natural  resources  management  schemes  component  might  pose\nsome  environmental  problems  if  their  planning,  design,  and  implementation  do  not  provide  for\nnecessary environmental safeguards. As such, the Project has been classified in Category B. A\nsummary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  report  is  given  in  Appendix  14.  The  SIEE\nhighlights specific environmental criteria and concerns that need to be carefully examined when\nselecting, designing, and implementing the schemes. The feasibility report on each small-scale\nnatural resources management scheme will include an initial environmental examination (IEE),\nthe  Government's\nprepared \nenvironmental  monitoring  requirements.  The  IEE  will  be  submitted  to  BAPEDALDA  (Provincial\nEnvironmental  Impact  Management  Agency)  and  the  relevant  AMDAL  (Environmental  Impact\nAssessment)  Commission  for  review  and  approval.  If  the  IEE  determines  the  need,  a  detailed\nenvironmental impact assessment will be carried out for the scheme.\n\nin  accordance  with  ADB's  environmental  guidelines  and \n\n92.\nNone  of  the  project  activities  are  expected  to  adversely  affect  any  community  in  the\nproject area. On the contrary, specific measures have been incorporated in the project design to\nrespond, within the basic framework of the Project, to the needs of the local community. These\nmeasures include recognizing the traditional rights of communities to local resources, promoting\ncommunity participation in planning and managing resources, and rehabilitating and improving\nthe  resources  in  selected  coastal  areas  including  developing  alternative  livelihood  for  the\ndisadvantaged coastal communities. \n\nH.\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\nIn  Indonesia,  development  planning  and  resource  management  initiatives  have  largely\n93.\nbeen  national  activities.  The  provincial  and  district  BAPPEDAs  were  established  in  the  1980s,\nbut  their  actual  function  strongly  focused  on  regional  coordination  of  sector  development\n\n\f25\n\ninitiatives  decided  at  the  national  level.  Some  provincial  BAPPEDAs  have  gained  some\nexperience  in  resource  planning  and  management  through  the  ADB-assisted  LREP,  LREP  II,\nand  MREP,  while  district  BAPPEDAs  do  not  yet  have  necessary  human  resources,  technical\nknow-how, and required facilities.\n\n94.\nAct 22/99 requires a major shift in responsibility for development planning and resource\nmanagement  from  the  national  level  to  provincial  and  district  levels.  Such  decentralization  will\nrequire  creating  local  awareness  and  understanding  of  the  problems  and  issues  involved  in\nnatural  resources  planning  and  management  and  strengthening  of  capacity,  including\nmobilization of resources (human, physical, and financial) to match the increased responsibility.\nThe  project  provides  support  to  15  of  the  26  provinces  and  only  42  of  about  341  districts  to\nstrengthen  resources  planning  and  management  capacity,  with  focus  on  marine  and  coastal\nresources.  The  Government  needs  to  develop  a  program  for  capacity  building  of  regional\nplanning and sector agencies nationwide, particularly at district level to cover both terrestrial and\nmarine resources. The Government has, therefore, requested ADB to provide a TA in preparing\na program for decentralized capacity building for natural resources management.\n\n95.\nThe  TA  for  Capacity  Building  for  Decentralized  Natural  Resources  Management  will  (i)\nanalyze  the  implications  of  decentralization  measures  on  the  roles  and  functions  of  the\nBAPPEDAs and sector agencies at the provincial and district levels, including an assessment of\nhuman resources, technical know-how, and logistical support in the context of natural resources\nmanagement; (ii) evaluate the implications of the existing and evolving regulatory framework for\nnatural  resources  management  on  regional  capacities  for  undertaking  resource  planning  and\nmanagement;  (iii)  provide  specific  recommendations  for  viable  institutional  and  organizational\nreforms  to  improve  the  capacity  for  decentralized  management  of  natural  resources  at  the\ndistrict  and  provincial  levels;  (iv)  select  about  five  district  BAPPEDAs,  based  on  agreed-upon\nselection criteria, and implement a pilot capacity building program, following a holistic approach\nin  natural  resources  planning  and  management;  and  (v)  make  general  recommendations,\napplicable throughout the country, for strengthening provincial and district BAPPEDA functions\nand capabilities to fulfil their responsibilities for planning the sustainable management of natural\nresources and the environment. The terms of reference for the TA are in Appendix 15.\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  about  $975,000  equivalent,  of  which  $775,000\n96.\nwill  be  financed  by  ADB  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the\nGovernment  of  Japan.  The  Government  will  finance  the  equivalent  of  $200,000  in  local\nexpenditures. The cost estimates and financing plan are given in Appendix 15. ADB will select a\nteam of international and domestic consultants to be recruited through a firm in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and other satisfactory arrangements for engaging\ndomestic consultants. A total of 16 person-months of international consultants with expertise in\ninstitutional  strengthening,  natural  resource  planning  and  management,  natural  resources\naccounting,  and  natural  resources  law  will  be  required.  This  will  be  complemented  with  22\nperson-months of domestic consultants in the areas of spatial planning, resource management,\nresource  accounting,  institutional  development,  and  local  laws  and  regulations.  MOHA  will  be\nthe EA for the TA and will implement it through its Directorate General of Rural Development.\n\n\f26\n\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe  principal  project  benefits  will  accrue  from  enhanced  local  capacity  to  plan  and\n97.\nmanage the sustainable development of marine and coastal resources, a responsibility that will\nsoon be devolved by the national Government to regional governments.  Improved planning will\nlead  to  rational  and  coordinated  allocation  of  resources  for  development,  emphasizing\nsustainable  exploitation,  protection,  and  conservation,  and  improved  public  consultation  and\nparticipation.  The  physical  plans  prepared  for  the  priority  areas  will  facilitate  identifying  and\nprioritizing  potential  investment  opportunities  for  the  public  and  the  private  sector.  Since  the\ninland  boundary  for  planning  will  be  the  nearest  watershed  divide,  physical  planning  for\nsignificant parts of inland areas will also be undertaken in conjunction with marine and coastal\nareas.\n\n98.\nThe  development  of  spatial  data  infrastructure  under  the  Project  will  generate  quality\ndata  and  information  on  marine  and  coastal  geology  and  geomorphology;  marine  and  coastal\necosystems; vegetative cover, land use, and land suitability; urban and industrial developments\nin  coastal  zones;  and  social  and  environmental  issues.  Enhanced  legal  protection  and\nempowerment  of  communities  to  exercise  their  traditional  rights  over  local  marine  and  coastal\nresources,  and  more  effective  law  enforcement  will  result  in  increased  accountability  and\ntransparent  use  of  resources,  and  reduce  illegal  activities  that  lead  to  environmental\ndegradation.\n\nThe  small-scale  natural  resources  management  schemes  will  rationalize  the  use  of\n99.\ncoastal resources, and improve the living conditions of disadvantaged coastal communities. The\noverall investment costs of the small-scale schemes will amount to less than $1 million in each\nprovince over a period of six years. Despite the small investment size, these schemes and the\nassociated  capacity-building  initiatives  will  provide  opportunities  for  local  governments  and\ncommunities to have hands-on practice in decentralized planning, and implementation of small\nand affordable development initiatives.\n\nB.\n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n100. Due  to  the  predominantly  capacity-building  nature  of  the  Project,  the  financial  and\neconomic  analyses  were  limited  to  assessing  the  quantifiable  costs  and  benefits  of  the  small-\nscale  natural  resources  management  schemes.  The  Project  is  expected  to  generate  direct\nbenefits  from  the  schemes  as  formulated  and  prioritized  in  the  action  plans  of  the  selected\nareas.\n\nThe  investment  initiatives  that  have  been  identified  include  coastal  fisheries,  coastal\n101.\nenvironmental  improvement,  and  alternative  livelihoods  for  sustained  income  generation.  For\nillustrative  purposes,  four  models  were  developed  to  demonstrate  the  potential  costs  and\nbenefits of small-scale schemes that were identified by the participating provinces: (i) seaweed\nculture development, (ii) sea bass cage culture, (iii) silvofishery development, and (iv) mangrove\nrehabilitation  to  control  coastal  erosion.  Details  of  the  financial  and  economic  analyses,\nincluding assumptions and sensitivity analyses, are presented in Appendix 16.\n\nThe  financial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  were  estimated  at  about  24  percent  for\n102.\nseaweed culture, 35 percent for sea bass cage culture, and 23 percent for silvofishery activities.\ninternal  rates  of  return  (EIRR)  were\nAdjusting \n\nfor  economic  prices, \n\nthe  economic \n\n\f27\n\ncorrespondingly  estimated  at  about  29  percent  for  seaweed  culture,  41  percent  for  sea  bass\ncage  culture,  29  percent  for  silvofishery,  and  12  percent  for  mangrove  rehabilitation  to  control\nerosion. The FIRRs are sensitive to reduction in benefits and increases in operating costs, but\ngenerally  robust  to  increases  in  investment  costs.  The  FIRRs  would  fall  to  12  percent  when\nexpected benefits are reduced by 6 percent for seaweed culture, 8 percent for sea bass cage\nculture,  and  16  percent  for  silvofishery.  The  FIRRs  would  fall  to  12  percent  when  operating\ncosts rise by about 7 percent for seaweed culture, 11 percent for sea bass cage culture, and 28\npercent for silvofishery. Nonetheless, the risks of reduction in benefits can be minimized through\nadoption  of  recommended,  relatively  simple,  and  well-proven  technology,  combined  with\nreasonable  management  practices  to  avoid  undue  shortfalls.  Output  price  risks  are  minimal,\ngiven the steady consumer demand for fish and seafood in the local and regional markets.\n\nC.\n\nEnvironment\n\n103.\nThe Project will have a substantial positive impact on the environment. The preparation\nand application of spatial plans based on ICZPM principles will allow systematic assessment of\ninland,  marine,  and  coastal  resources,  and  help  develop  strategies  and  actions  to  address\nconflicts over resource uses, control the impacts of human intervention on the environment, and\nprevent further degradation of the inland, marine, and coastal ecosystems.\n\n104. Controlling  and  managing  upstream  activities  including  industrial  development  and\nagricultural  operations  through  appropriate  zoning  will  minimize  downstream  impacts  on\nestuaries  and  coastlines.  Consequently,  sensitive  coastal  habitats  such  as  wetlands  and\nmangroves  can  be  safeguarded  to  provide  physical  shelters  for  numerous  species  of\nshorebirds,  crabs,  shrimps,  fish,  and  invertebrates.  They  can  also  act  as  a  buffer  to  stabilize\ncoastal shorelines and protect them from tidal surges and erosion. Likewise, protecting the coral\nreef systems will ensure shelter and food for valued species of fish and shellfish, and contribute\nto  renewable  marine  resources  and  biodiversity.  Alternative  sources  of  livelihood  and\ninvestments  in  natural  resources  management  schemes  are  expected  to  work  in  synergy  to\nachieve strong ownership and partnership among stakeholders, including local communities, in\nprotecting the natural resources base for sustained exploitation.\n\nD.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n105. Marine and coastal resources provide important sources of livelihood for a large number\nof  people  in  coastal  zones  and  small  islands.  Population  pressure  and  increased  economic\nactivities have frequently resulted in depleted resources, and intensified conflicts in allocations\nand  uses  of  resources.  This  condition  is  exacerbated  by  lack  of  opportunities  for  alternative\nlivelihoods.\n\nThe  project  initiatives  will  improve  planning  and  management  functions,  thus  arresting\n106.\nfurther  degradation  of  the  natural  resources,  and  allowing  sustainable  exploitation  and\nimprovements  in  living  standards  of  coastal  and  small-island  communities.  The  consultative\nplanning  and  management  concepts  promoted  by  the  Project  will  increase  transparency  and\naccountability  in  zoning  decisions  and  management  of  spatial  plans.  These  plans,  along  with\nincreased  public  access  and  enforcement,  will  provide  a  rational  means  for  preventing  and\nresolving conflicts among diverse and competing interests, and reconciling the interests of the\ngeneral public and the private sector. The management plans will recognize the traditional rights\nof  local  communities  in  coastal  land  use  and  environment-friendly  exploitation  of  natural\nresources. Collaborative efforts and partnership between government agencies, and NGOs  will\npressure government authorities to become more service-oriented.\n\n\fE.\n\nPoverty Impact\n\n28\n\n107.\n A significant portion of the estimated 8 million poor in the 42 project districts are in the\n15  MCMAs  for  which  ICZPM  is  to  be  planned  and  implemented  (para.  46).  The  Project\ninitiatives will benefit these poor through a number of process channels. Improved management\nof  marine  and  coastal  resources  will  allow  recovery  and  replenishment  of  renewable  natural\nresource  assets,  and  thereby  safeguard  the  sustainability  of  the  income  base  for  the  local\ngovernments  and  communities  concerned.  Consultative  and  participatory  processes  that\nlocal\nunderpin  zoning  decisions,  management  plans,  and  action  plans  will  empower \ncommunities  and  stakeholders  to  prevent  unilateral  decisions  and  abuses  of  power  by\nauthorities and vested interest groups in allocating and exploiting natural resources. Improving\nthe  regulatory  framework  related  to  natural  resources  with  project  assistance  will  enhance  the\neffectiveness of the plans and allow public endorsement of enforcing penalties and sanctions.\n\n108. Disadvantaged coastal communities will receive direct benefits from targeted small-scale\ninvestment  schemes  that  include  rehabilitation  of  degraded  coastal  areas  and  development  of\nalternative  livelihoods.  Alternative  sources  of  livelihood  based  on  labor-intensive  mariculture,\nand  silvofishery  activities  demonstrate  that  significant  employment  and  incomes  can  be\ngenerated  to  ease  pressure  on  capture  coastal  fisheries.  Through  CFRM  initiatives,  the\nlivelihood resource base for the artisanal fishers can be sustained by protecting fish habitats to\nallow  recovery  of  fish  stocks  and  other  aquatic  resources,  rehabilitating  mangroves  and  coral\nreefs,  and  reducing  destructive  fishing.  Emphasis  will  be  on  targeting  alternative  revenue  and\nemployment-generating  initiatives  in  the  selected  MCMAs  where  the  incidence  of  poverty  is\nparticularly severe.\n\nF.\n\nRisks\n\n109.\nThe  risks  that  could  adversely  affect  the  achievement  of  the  project  objectives  and  its\nsustainability  are  (i)  uncertainties  emanating  from  the  evolving  decentralization  process  and\ninstitutional  arrangements  at  provincial  and  district  levels,  (ii)  institutionalization  of  the  spatial\nplanning and ICZPM process in the BAPPEDAs, and (iii) financial resources and cost recovery.\nThe  implications  of  these  issues  and  risks,  and  measures  proposed  for  their  mitigation  are\nsummarized below.\n\n110. Evolving  Decentralization  Process.  Act  22/99  and  Act  25/99  on  administrative  and\nfiscal  decentralization  are  scheduled  to  become  effective  on  1  January  2001.  This  will  require\ndrafting and approval of a range of enabling rules and regulations and reorganization of regional\ngovernment  services,  BAPPEDAs,  and  sector  agencies.18  The  national  and  regional\ngovernments  are  working  together  to  strengthen  the  regional  institutions  by  redeploying  staff\nfrom the related national agencies, commencing in early 2001. While funds are being allocated\nin the regional budgets for increased staff resources, the slow pace in enacting enabling laws to\ndecentralize \ninstitutional\nstrengthening process at the regional level. The project design takes into account the possible\ndelay, and the number of qualified staff for marine coastal resources planning and management\nin  a  participating  province  during  the  initial  years  is  based  on  current  staff  strength,  with  a\nmodest increase in the second half of the implementation period. On that basis, the participating\nprovinces have expressed commitment to establish a PIU with a specified number of qualified\nstaff within one month of loan effectiveness (para. 114).\n\nfiscal  responsibilities  may  delay \n\nfunctional  and \n\nthe  required \n\n                  \n\n18  ADB has provided assistance in, among others, drafting the enabling laws under TA 3177-INO: Capacity Building\n\nto Support Decentralized Administrative System, for $500,000, approved on 25 March 1999.\n\n\f29\n\n111. As  the  rules  and  regulations  to  implement  fiscal  decentralization  are  still  being\ndeveloped, the national Government undertook to bear full responsibility for the ADB loan and to\nprovide required counterpart funds throughout the implementation period. Counterpart funds will\nbe  allocated  in  the  national  budget  as  special  allocations  to  the  participating  provinces  (para.\n114).\n\n112.\nInstitutionalizing  ICZPM.  Project  sustainability  requires  that  spatial  planning  and\nICZPM  processes  be  institutionalized  within  the  planning  functions  and  responsibilities  of  the\nBAPPEDAs.  The  incentives  for  this  institutionalization  will  depend  largely  on  the  impacts  that\nICZPM plans can make in the priority areas, and the rewards that local governments can derive\nfrom  sustainable  management  of  resources.  The  priority  MCMAs  were  selected  by  local\ngovernments in accordance with agreed-upon criteria that emphasize the need for improving the\nenvironmentally  degraded  and  socially  disadvantaged  areas.  The  management  plans  to  be\nprepared  for  priority  areas  under  the  Project  are  expected  to  underscore  the  urgency  and\ndefinition that are deficient in a conventional plan. Moreover, the reforms and associated fiscal\nbenefits  introduced  under  Acts  22/99  and  25/99  strengthen  the  sense  of  ownership  of  local\ngovernments  for  natural  resources,  and  provide  a  congenial  environment  for  adopting  a\nsustainable approach to resource management in their jurisdiction.\n\n113. Cost  Recovery.  The  spatial  information  centers  of  the  BAPPEDAs  are  expected  to\nbecome partially self-financing by the end of the Project. Operational costs for maintaining the\nprovincial  information  centers,  including  providing  for  adequate  equipment  maintenance  and\nperiodic  replacement,  were  estimated  at  about  $60,000  annually.  This  level  of  funding  is\naffordable  to  the  provincial  BAPPEDAs.  Existing  BAPPEDA  budget  allocations  for  information\nand planning products generally exceeds the requirements for maintaining information centers.\nNonetheless,  provision  has  been  made  for  the  services  of  a  business  development  adviser  in\ndeveloping a range of value-added information services so as to generate additional revenues\nand  attain  an  increasing  level  of  self-financing  capability.    The  business  development  adviser\nwill  also  provide  staff  training  in  marketing  strategies  aimed  at  establishing  within  the\nBAPPEDAs  an  environment  that  encourages  interaction  between  the  public  (the  client)  and\ngovernment staff based on accessibility of data and information.\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard\n\n114.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n (i)\n\n(ii) \n\nWithin one month of loan effectiveness, the Government will establish (a) a NSC\nfor overall coordination and monitoring of project activities, and (b) a PSC in each\nparticipating province.\n\nThe Government will ensure that the PMO will be supported by a technical team\nof at least 16 full-time qualified staff not later than 31 March 2001.\n\n(iii)  Within  one  month  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  cause  each\nparticipating province to establish a PIU and a PTF in the province. Each PIU will\nbe headed by the head of Physical Planning Division of the provincial BAPPEDA\nand  will  have  at  least  three  staff  members  in  natural  resources  planning  and\nmonitoring and one staff member in accounting, in each case with qualifications\nand experience acceptable to ADB.\n\n\f30\n\n(iv)  Within  six  months  from  loan  effectiveness,  BAKOSURTANAL  will  establish  a\ntechnical  advisory  group,  made  up  of  representatives  from  major  spatial  data-\nsupplying  agencies,  private  industry,  and  NGOs  to  guide  the  development  of\nIndonesian  spatial  data  infrastructure  and  to  develop  metadata  standards  and\nprotocols.\n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nLIPI will ensure the establishment of a NBIN association within six months of the\nloan  effectiveness.  The  members,  including  universities  and  NGOs,  will  be\nselected in accordance with criteria and procedures acceptable to ADB.\n\nthe \n\nthat \n\nfrom \n\nfunds \n\nloan  proceeds  and \n\nthe\nThe  Government  assured \ncorresponding  counterpart  contributions,  necessary \nfinancing  project\nactivities,  will  be  provided  throughout  project  implementation  through  budgetary\ntransfer  of  funds  earmarked  for  such  purposes.  This  is  notwithstanding  (a)  any\nreallocation  of  authority  or  responsibility  for  channeling  external  assistance  and\nproviding  corresponding  counterpart  contributions  between \nthe  national\nGovernment  and  participating  provinces  and  districts,  or  (b)  any  requirement  to\nprovide  matching  counterpart  contributions  to  fund  project  activities  from\nparticipating  provinces  and  districts,  arising  from  the  full  implementation  of  Act\nNos. 22 and 25 of 1999.\n\nfor \n\n(vii) \n\nThe Government will ensure timely availability of counterpart funds necessary for\nthe  project  implementation  period.  Action  will  be  taken  for  timely  submission  of\nannual  budgetary  appropriation  request  to  meet  the  counterpart  funding\nrequirements and for prompt disbursement of allocated funds.\n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  necessary  measures  are  taken  during\nproject  implementation  to  enable  the  spatial  information  centers  of  BAPPEDAs\nstrengthened  under  the  Project  to  effect  cost  recovery  for  disseminating\ninformation and maps and to promote self-financing of spatial data collection and\ndistribution.\n\nVII.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n115.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  38,752,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Marine  and  Coastal\nResources Management Project, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years,\nand with an interest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in\naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\n3 October 2000\n\nTADAO CHINO\n    President\n\n\f31\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber\n\nTitle\n\nPage\n\n  Cited On\n(page, para.)\n\nProject Framework\n\nADB Assistance to Indonesia for the Marine\nand Coastal Resources Sector\n\n3 \n\nPriority Marine and Coastal Management Areas\n\nPoverty Indicators in Project Provinces and MCMAs\n\nIntegrated Coastal Zone Planning and Management\n\n12,48; 13,49\n\nSmall-Scale Natural Resources Management Schemes \n\n32\n\n35\n\n36\n\n38\n\n39\n\n40\n\n43\n\n45\n\n46\n\n47\n\n48\n\n55\n\n57\n\n58\n\n65\n\n68\n\n1,2\n\n7,26\n\n12,46\n\n12,46\n\n16,64\n\n17,66\n\n20,74\n\n20,75\n\n20,77\n\n21,80\n\n22,83\n\n22,86\n\n24,91\n\n25,95-96\n\n26,101\n\nDetailed Cost Estimates\n\nOrganization Chart\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nTentative Packages for Procurement of Goods\nand Services\n\nTerms of Reference for Consultants\n\nTraining Program \n\nFund Flow Arrangements \n\nSummary Initial Environmental Examination \n\nTechnical Assistance for Capacity Building for\nDecentralized Natural Resources Management \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\n\nDetailed Cost Estimates\n\nSupporting Table for Financial and Economic Analyses\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\nA\n\nB\n\n\f32\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nNarrative Summary\n\nPerformance Targetsa\n\nMeans of Verification\n\nAssumptions and Risks\n\n1.

The\nincidence  of  poverty  in  the  area  will  also  be  considered.  Each  issue  will  be  ranked  high  (3),\nmedium (2), or low  (1) depending on local circumstances.\n\n(i) \n\nCoastal  zone  degradation  (urban/industrial  impacts,  erosion  due  to  loss  of\nvegetative cover)\n\n(ii)\n\nCoral reef destruction (average percent of degraded coral cover)\n\n(iii)\n\nLoss of biodiversity (declining wildlife populations and flora)\n\n(iv)  Mangrove loss and abandonment (mangrove disappearance [ha/year])\n\n(v)\n\nOverfishing (indicator fish species)\n\n(vi)\n\nDeforestation (average percent of degraded forest cover)\n\n(vii) Water  resource  depletion  and  pollution  (groundwater  and  surface  water  and\n\nquality)\n\n(viii)\n\nSoil erosion and water management degradation\n\n(ix)\n\nSusceptibility to natural disasters (storms, tidal waves, earthquakes, floods)\n\n(x)\n\nIncidence of poverty (higher than provincial average, equal to provincial average,\nbelow provincial average);\n\n2.\nIn addition to the criteria, priority areas within individual provinces should be manageable\nin  terms  of  size,  accessibility,  and  economic  importance  or  conservation  requirements.  The\ninvolvement  of \nlocal  government,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  affected\nstakeholders  will  be  important  in  supporting  the  data  collection  exercise  and  planning\nrequirements.  Four  other  principles  will  be  considered:  (i)  watershed  zoning  surveys  and  the\nmapping  process  should  be  limited  to  an  area  that  covers  one  or  two  map  sheets  (e.g.,  at  a\nscale  of  1:250,000;  one  map  sheet  at  a  scale  of  1:250,000  is  equivalent  to  18,500  square\nkilometers [km2]); (ii) semidetailed planning of the priority area (e.g., 1:50,000 or larger) should\nbe  initially  confined  to  a  survey  area  that  allows  for  the  completion  of  a  planning  exercise\ncovering 12-13 map sheets along the coastal zone at a scale of 1:50.000 or an area of about\n9,000  km2;1  (iii)  provincial  and  district  government  capacity  to  manage  the  survey  and  data\ncollection steps and subsequent planning activities should guide the entire process; and (iv) a\nmaximum of three districts should be the upper limit of districts included.\n\n                                                \n1 Total area of a marine and coastal management area (MCMA) should normally be 15,000 km2.\n\n\f37\n\nAppendix 3, page 2\n\nB.\n\nList of Marine and Coastal Management Areas\n\nProvince\n\nDistrict/Municipality\n\nProvince\n\nDistrict/Municipality\n\n1.North Sumatra\n\n9.

Fringing  the  villages  is  about  200  hectares  (ha)  of  mangrove  areas,\nextensively  cut  for  firewood.  Only  about  35  ha  remains  with  young,  short  trees.  Beyond  the\nmangroves, the shallow coastal area is covered by a largely undamaged coral reef. The coral\nreefs  serve  as  spawning  ground  for  fry  of  various  fish  with  high  economic  value  for  the  local\ncommunity. Outsiders occasionally come to fish using destructive methods, such as poison and\nexplosives. The community is against these practices.\n\n2.\nThe  villages  have  a  population  of  1,633  living  in  433  households.  Education\nachievement is low, 91 percent did not finish primary school. About 73 percent of the people of\nthe villages derive their incomes from a combination of upland agriculture and fishing. Another\n27  percent  depend  on  small-scale  industry  and  trade.  Annual  family  income  from  fishing  and\nagriculture  is  about  Rp3.5  million  for  an  average  family  of  five  (less  than  $100  per  capita);\nwomen family members contribute about 25 percent of that income. The villages were classified\nas  disadvantaged  by  the  former Inpres Desa Tertinggal  (IDT)  program.  Both  villages  are  also\nclassified as poor by the BKKBN (family planning) program, with 70 percent having an income in\nthe lowest of the three income groups in the BKKBN program.\n\nThe  community  plans  to  develop  a  100-ha  mangrove  conservation  area  by  enrichment\n3.\nplanting. They also plan to generate supplemental income by growing fry to commercial size in\ncages. Placing the cages near the mangroves and corals will encourage villagers to defend their\narea  against  explosives  and  poisoning  by  outsiders.  The  work  will  include  community\nmobilization,  mangrove  enrichment,  development  of  mariculture,  and  development  of  a\ncommunity-based and local government-supported monitoring and surveillance system against\ndestructive  harvesting  of  marine  resources  in  the  area.  Total  costs  are  estimated  at  about\nRp750 million ($93,000), and the implementation period is estimated at three years.\n\n2.\n\nTanjung Luar Mangrove and Silvofishery Development Scheme\n\n 4.\nTanjung  Luar  village  is  located  to  the  southeast  of  Mataram,  the  capital  city  of  West\nNusa Tenggara Province. The village has a population of 9,284 in 2,359 households. About 86\npercent of the households are fishing families. The conversion of mangroves to fishponds (most\nof the fishponds have since been abandoned) and destructive fishing have degraded the coastal\nmarine environment near the village, causing a substantial decline in fish yields. Consequently,\nthe  incidence  of  poverty  is  very  high,  estimated  at  51  percent  in  1999.  Motivated  by  the  local\nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), the villagers and informal leaders are now committed to\nrehabilitate the fish habitat and manage it sustainably.\n\nThe  scheme  involves  rehabilitating  about  150  ha  of  mangroves  and  developing\n5.\nsilvofishery1  in  part  of  the  rehabilitation  area.  Specific  activities  are  community  mobilization,\ntraining  in  mangrove  rehabilitation  and  silvofishery  practices,  nurseries  and  replanting  of\n\n                  \n\n1  Silvofishery supports the production of fish and other organisms in the pond through the leaves that fall from the\n\ntrees. The production is at semi-intensive level.\n\n\f41\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\nmangroves  and  scheme  management.  Total  costs  for  implementing  the  scheme  over  three\nyears are estimated at about Rp880 million.\n\n3.\n\nPendingin Erosion Control Scheme\n\n6.\nPendingin  village  is  located  in  the  Mahakam  delta  in  East  Kalimantan  Province.  The\ndelta, west of the Makassar Strait, covers about 3,200 square kilometers and is rich in fisheries\nresources.  A  4.5-kilometer  stretch  of  the  Mahakam  River  forms  the  eastern  boundary  of\nPendingin  village.  The  mangrove  along  the  riverbank  has  been  damaged  by  human  activities,\nexposing the riverbank to erosion caused by water current and wave action. Several sections of\nthe bank have been affected by erosion, and about 10 meters of land has been washed into the\nriver  over  the  past  three  years.  Apart  from  the  loss  of  valuable  land,  erosion  has  forced  the\npeople living near the bank, mostly fishing families, to move their houses nearly every year.\n\n7.\nThe village has a population of 1,529 in 375 households.  Farming and small business\nactivities are the main source of income for 270 households, and the remaining 105 households\nlargely depend on fishing for their livelihood. The nonfishing families have stable incomes, while\nmost of the fishing families are constantly in debt to middlemen in fish trading. The village has a\npoverty incidence of 26 percent. Most of the houses lack clean water and sanitary facilities.\n\nThe proposed scheme aims at arresting bank erosion and protecting land and properties\n8.\nof  the  local  community  by  adopting  a  set  of  measures:  (i)  constructing  erosion  protection\nstructures,  at  strategic  locations,  applying  local  materials  and  technologies;  (ii)  restoring\nmangroves  along  the  entire  stretch  of  the  affected  bank;  and  (iii)  informing  the  community  on\npreventive measures against bank erosion. All activities will be carried by the local community\nwith the involvement of a qualified local NGO. The scheme is estimated to cost Rp700 million\n($87,000) and will be implemented over two years commencing in early 2002.\n\n4.\n\nPanjang Island Seaweed Culture Scheme\n\n9.\nPanjang  is  a  small  island  of  about  70  ha,  separated  from  Bangka  Island  of  South\nSumatra Province by 9 nautical miles of a shallow stretch of the sea. There are no permanent\nhuman habitats in Panjang, but the people in the village of Tanjung Gunung on Bangka depend\nheavily  on  the  aquatic  resources  around  Panjang  for  their  livelihood.  About  half  of  the  405\nfamilies  in  Tanjung  Gunung  are  fishing  families,  and  a  significant  number  are  involved  in\ngathering  natural  seaweed  around  Panjang.  A  small  number  of  the  fishing  communities  are\ninvolved  in  seaweed  culture,  but  they  need  technical  assistance  to  improve  the  yield  and\nmotivate others to refrain from overharvesting the naturally grown seaweeds.\n\n10.\nThe proposed scheme aims to reduce the pressure on naturally grown seaweed as well\nas fisheries resources around the Panjang islet by enhancing the capacity of the community in\n(i) seaweed culture, (ii) postharvest handling and processing, and (iii) efficient marketing of the\nproduct. About 50 households will be initially involved, and the activities will include community\nmobilization,  technical  support  and  training,  linking  the  community  with  a  rural  financing\ninstitution  for  seed  capital,  establishing  seaweed  farms,  and  technical  institutional  support  for\npostharvest processing and marketing. A NGO will be engaged to assist the community in the\nabove activities. The scheme is estimated to cost Rp720 million, and will be implemented over\ntwo years.\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 6, page 3\n\nB.\n\nCriteria for Selection\n\n11.\n\nThe selected schemes should meet the following criteria:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  schemes  must  be  located  in  the  marine  and  coastal  management  areas\n(MCMAs)  of  the  Project  or  the  MCMAs  of  the  predecessor  Marine  Resources\nEvaluation and Planning (MREP) project.\n\nThey  should  be  included  in  the  management  and  action  plans  prepared  for  the\nrespective MCMAs.\n\nThe schemes should contribute directly or indirectly to achieving one or more of\nthe following: (a) sustainable management of coastal and marine resources, (b)\nenvironmental  protection,  and  (c)  poverty  reduction.  Emphasis  will  be  on  (a)\ntargeting  poverty  reduction  initiatives  in  specific  areas  where  the  incidence  of\npoverty  is  significantly  higher  than  the  provincial  average,  and  (b)  ensuring  that\nthe benefits generated by the schemes are distributed in favor of the poor.\n\nPlanning,  implementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  schemes\nshould  follow  a  participatory  approach,  with  active  involvement  of  the  targeted\nbeneficiaries.\n\nTargeted beneficiaries in each scheme should contribute up to 15 percent of the\ntotal  costs,  unless  limited  by  cost  structure,  and  in  kind  through  unskilled  labor\nand locally available construction materials.\n\n12.\nThe  feasibility  report  of  each  scheme  will  include  an  initial  environmental  examination\n(IEE), prepared in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for the relevant sectors,\nand the 1998 Environmental Assessment Requirements, and the Government\u2019s environmental\nmonitoring requirements.

The training will be held locally except for a master's degree\ncourse on natural resources/marine and coastal resources management and a study visit to a\nspatial data information network (SDIN). A human resource development/training specialist will\nbe  engaged  to  assist  the  Executing  Agency  (Ministry  of  Marine  Affairs  and  Fisheries  [MMAF])\nand  BAPPEDAs  in  designing  and  preparing  comprehensive  training  programs.  All  training\nprograms will be undertaken in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to the ADB.\n\n2.\nThe local training program will involve about 2,078 person-months and will form the bulk\nof  all  training  activities.  Table  A12  lists  the  training  activities  and  the  expected  number  of\nparticipants  at  provincial  and  district  levels.  In  addition,  a  series  of  workshops  at  provincial,\ndistrict, and site levels on the following topics will be organized: (i) marine and coastal resources\nmanagement  issues,  (ii)  priority  marine  and  coastal  management  areas  (MCMAs)  and  the\nintegrated  management  plans  for  them  as  they  evolve,  (iii)  action  plans  for  the  MCMAs  and\nselection of small-scale natural resources management schemes for implementation under the\nproject,  and  (v)  any  other  issues  that  would  require  public  consultation.  The  objective  of  the\nworkshops  is  to  promote  the  participation  of  various  stakeholders  in  project  activities,  improve\ntheir  sense  of  ownership  of  the  project,  and  enhance  project  quality.  Within  three  months  of\nengaging consultants for marine resources planning and management, the project management\noffice  (PMO)  will  prepare,  in  consultation  with  the  implementing  agencies  and  participating\nprovinces, a tentative program of workshops for review by the national and provincial steering\ncommittees and ADB.  The program will be further reviewed and revised, as necessary, at the\nbeginning of each calendar year.\n\n3.\nProvision  has  been  made  for  an  overseas  masters'  level  program  in  natural\nresources/marine  and  coastal  resources  management  for  two  BAPPEDA  staff  from  each\nparticipating  province.  The  proposed  degree  program  will  provide  relevant  advanced\neducational background to selected individuals who, upon completion, will have the necessary\nskills  to  administer  a  natural  resources  management  program  in  their  respective  provinces.\nWhile  Indonesia  has  made  significant  progress  in  providing  training  options,  the  country  does\nnot yet offer such comprehensive master level programs as are available in Australia, Canada,\nthe United States, and selected European countries. The master\u2019s program is normally over a\ntwo-year period, but additional resources will provide for sufficient time in completing training in\nEnglish  as  a  foreign  language  in  addition  to  required  prerequisite  courses,  primarily  in\nquantitative analysis and geographic information system (GIS)/remote sensing.\n\n4.\nThe Project provides for an international study visit on SDINs. The objective is to provide\nfive individuals the opportunity to study similar technical systems in a regional country that uses\nleading-edge  technology  which  is  maintained  and  operated  by  trained  individuals.

Since  the  Project,  as  a  whole,  is  strongly  oriented  to  sustainable  resource\nmanagement, it should have minimal adverse environmental impacts. However, activities in the\nsmall-scale  natural  resources  management  schemes  (SNRMS)  could  pose  environmental\nproblems  if  their  planning,  design,  and  implementation  do  not  include  the  necessary\nenvironmental safeguards. As such, the Project has been classified in category B.\n\nDuring  project  preparation, \n\nthe  consultants  conducted  an \n\ninitial  environmental\n2.\nexamination  (IEE)  according  to  the  ADB\u2019s  and  Government\u2019s  guidelines  on  environmental\nimpact  assessment  (EIA),  with  assistance  from  the  national  and  local  governments.  This\nsummary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  summarizes  the  IEE  findings  and  highlights\nspecific  environmental  criteria  and  concerns  that  need  to  be  carefully  examined  during\nselection, design, and implementation of the SNRMS.1 An initial social assessment of targeted\nbeneficiaries  within  the  identified  SNRMSs  was  undertaken.  In  addition  to  these  target\nbeneficiaries,  local  communities,  and  staff  of  the  concerned  sector  agencies  of  local\ngovernments were consulted.\n\nB.\n\nDescription of the Project\n\nThe project objectives are the sustainable management of marine and coastal resources\n3.\nand biodiversity, and environmental protection. Fifteen provinces will participate in the Project:\nNorth,  West,  and  South  Sumatra;  Riau;  Bengkulu;  Lampung;  West,  Central,  South  and  East\nKalimantan; North, Central, South, and Southeast Sulawesi; and West Nusa Tenggara.\n\n1.\n\nProject Components\n\na.\n\nCoastal Marine Resources Planning and Management\n\n4.\nThis component will strengthen the planning and management capacity of provincial and\ndistrict BAPPEDAs and selected sector agencies involved in marine resources assessment and\nconservation.  The  Project  will  provide  for  integrated  coastal  zone  planning  and  management\n(ICZPM)  initiatives  for  priority  marine  and  coastal  management  areas  (MCMAs)  in  each\nprovince,  covering  about  3-5  districts.  A  planning  hierarchy,  including  the  sequential\ndevelopment of a strategy plan, zoning plan, management plan, and action plans, will form the\nbasis of ICZPM activities.\n\nb.\n\nSpatial Data and Information Management\n\n5.\nThe  planning  and  management  activities  will  be  underpinned  by  additional  data\ncollection  and  installation  of  hardware  and  software  facilities  to  facilitate  access  to  data  by\nplanners  and  decision  makers.  There  are  four  subcomponents:  (i)  surveys  and  mapping,  (ii)\n\n                  \n\n1  The  IEE  for  four  SNRMS  was  carried  out  during  project  preparation.  About    50  additional    SNRMSs  are  to  be\nidentified during project implementation, and an IEE will be prepared for each of these SNRMSs and submitted to\nADB and Government for review  prior to their implementation.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 14, page 2\n\ninformation technology, (iii) spatial data infrastructure, and (iv) national biodiversity information\nnetwork (NBIN).\n\nc.\n\nLegislative Review and Law Enforcement\n\n6.\nThis  component  aims  at  strengthening  the  legal  framework  for  natural  resource\nmanagement, particularly for marine and coastal resources, and improving the law enforcement\nregime in the sector.\n\nd.\n\nSmall-Scale Natural Resources Management Schemes\n\nthe  devolution  of  responsibilities \n\n7.\nThis  component  will  support  small-scale,  priority  activities  consistent  with  the  project\nobjectives  and  the  hierarchy  of  spatial  plans.  Selected  activities  will  support  district  and\nsubdistrict  decentralization,  particularly \nfor  resources\nmanagement.  The  schemes  will  be  identified  in  the  ICZPM  plans  for  MCMAs.  Selecting  and\nimplementing  these  schemes  will  follow  a  process  approach,  with  the  active  participation  of\nstakeholders,  and  thus  demonstrate  the  tangible  value  of  ICZPM.  Typically,  the  schemes  will\ninclude  (i)  coastal  fisheries  resources  management,    including  rehabilitation  of  damaged  fish\nhabitats  (i.e.  mangroves,  coral  reefs,  and  sea  grass  areas);  (ii)  improvement  of  the  coastal\nenvironment,  including  control  of  pollution,  siltation  and  erosion;  (iii)  establishment  of  marine\nparks  and  managing  them  for  conservation  and  economic  purposes;  and  (iv)  development  of\nalternative livelihood activities for artisanal  fishers to ease pressure on coastal resources. Four\nrepresentative  schemes  have  been  identified  from  the  management  plans  prepared  under  the\npredecessor project, Marine Resources Evaluation and Planning Project (MREP).2\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n8.\nThe Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) will be the Executing Agency (EA).\nImplementing  Agencies  will  be  the  National  Coordinating  Agency  for  Survey  and  Mapping,\nprovincial and district BAPPEDAs concerned, and the National Institute of Sciences.\n\nC.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n1.\n\nProject Areas\n\n9.\nThe project areas cover six provinces in Sumatra, four in Kalimantan, four in Sulawesi,\nand  one  in  Nusa  Tenggara.  The  following  paragraphs  describe  the  physical  and  biological\nfeatures of the coastal areas of  these islands.\n\na.\n\nSumatra\n\n10.\nThe  physical  and  biological  features  of  the  Sumatra  coastal  areas  are  affected  by\nseawater currents: south-east current in the Strait of Malacca and north-west current in the west\ncoast  of  Sumatra  throughout  the  year;  and  north-west  current  in  the  southeast  coast  in\nFebruary, and south-east current in August. The water from rivers on the east coast flows north-\nwest, and the rivers on the west coast flow south-west. Every province has mangroves fringing\nits shores. There are 17 mangrove species in Sumatra. However, 60 percent of the mangrove\nforests  are  located  in  Riau  and  South  Sumatra.  Aside  from  mangrove  forests,  there  are  five\n\n2  Loan 1203-INO, for $33 million, approved on 8 December 1992.\n\n                  \n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 14, page 3\n\nother  types  of  ecosystems  around  the  coast  of  Sumatra:  pes-caprae  formation,  barringtonia\nformation, brackish water forests, rocky shores, and coral reefs.\n\n11.\nMost  of  the  coastal  areas  of  Sumatra  have  been  disturbed  by  human  activities.\nNortheast,  the  mangrove  forests  have  been  converted  to  fish  and  shrimp  ponds.  The  coast\nalong  the  Strait  of  Malacca  has  been  heavily  affected  by  oil  pollution.  In  addition,  the  coastal\nareas  have  also  become  a  dump  site  for  industrial  and  domestic  wastes.  Mining  the  reefs  for\nlimestone  and  fishing  systems  using  explosives  and  poison,  have  also  seriously  disturbed  the\ncoral reef ecosystem.\n\nb.\n\nSulawesi\n\nSulawesi has a long coastline relative to its land area.  Most of the mainland areas are\n12.\nlocated less than 90 kilometers (km) from the coast line. Most of the coastal area is dotted with\nsmall  islands,  many  with  land  area  of  less  than  1.5  square  kilometers.    The  surface  current\nduring  the  north-west  monsoon  (November-April)  flows  counterclockwise  around  Sulawesi.\nBetween May and October, no simple current pattern can be determined. The mangrove forests\nconsist  of  19  species,  and  large  parts  of  the  forest  have  been  converted  to  fish  and  shrimp\nponds. The other vegetation types in the coasts include pes-caprae, and barringtonia formation.\nSulawesi  coast  is  rich  in  coral  reefs.  Indonesia\u2019s  largest  coral  reef  fish  habitat,  Sangkaran\nArchipelago, is located about 80 km from Makasar, the capital city of South Sulawesi Province.\nSulawesi is also rich in marine species diversity which includes many species of crabs, snails,\nsea birds, maleo birds, shorebirds, and four endangered turtle species. Coral mining and fishing\nsystems using explosives and poison have seriously disturbed the coral reef ecosystem.\n\nc.\n\nKalimantan\n\n13.\nA large part of the Kalimantan coastline is characterized by deltas and swamplands that\nproduce  massive  amounts  of  nutrient  to  sustain  high  levels  of  marine  resource  productivity  in\nthe  adjacent  estuarine  and  marine  areas.    Some  parts  of  the  coastal  areas  have  rocky\nformations.  Several  large  islands  in  the  east  (e.g.,  Tarakan  and  Nunukan)  have  dipterocarp\nforests and mangroves that are still being logged. The Karimata Isles on the western side and\nBerau  Isles  on  the  eastern  side  of  Kalimantan  have  coral  reefs  in  good  condition.  Both  areas\nhave been designated as national marine parks. A number of oil and gas fields are located on\nthe east coast.\n\n2. \n\nRepresentative Small-Scale Natural Resources Management Schemes\n\na. \n\nMangrove Rehabilitation and Mariculture in Serei and Bahoi Villages\n\nThe neighboring coastal villages of Serei and Bahoi in the Likupang subdistrict of North\n14.\nSulawesi  Province  have  about  200  hectares  (ha)  of  mangrove  areas,  extensively  cut  for\nfirewood.  Only  35  ha  remains  with  young  trees.  Beyond  the  mangrove,  the  shallow  coastal\nwaters  are  covered  by  largely  undamaged  coral  reef.  The  villages  have  a  total  population  of\n1,633 in 433 households; 70 percent of them are classified as poor.\n\n15.\nThe  proposed  scheme  will  rehabilitate  100  ha  of  mangrove  through  community\nparticipation.  The  scheme  will  also  support  the  development  of  mariculture  in  cages  as\nalternative livelihood for the villagers.\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 14, page 4\n\nb. \n\nTanjung Luar Mangrove and Silvofishery Scheme\n\n16.\nThe coastal village of Tanjung Luar is located to the southeast of Mataram City in West\nNusa  Tenggara  Province.  Eighty-six  percent  of  the  2,359  households  depend  on  fishing  for\nlivelihood; but fish yields have declined considerably because of coastal degradation caused by\nconversion  of  mangroves  to  fishponds,  most  of  which  have  since  been  abandoned.  Fifty-one\npercent of the people live in poverty.\n\nTo  improve  the  coastal  environment  and  the  livelihood  of  the  local  community,  the\n17.\nproposed  scheme  will  rehabilitate  150  ha  of  mangroves  and  abandoned  fishponds  as  a\ncombination  of  extensive  aquaculture  and  mangrove  replanting,  using  a  model  developed  on\nBali with the assistance of Japan International Cooperating Agency.\n\nc. \n\nPendingin Village Erosion Control Scheme\n\n18.\nThe  estuarine  village  of  Pendingin  is  located  on  the  bank  of  Mahakam  River  in  East\nKalimantan  Province.  Mangroves  along  the  riverbank  have  been  heavily  damaged  by  human\nactivities, and a 4.5 km section has been affected by severe erosion. About 26 percent of the\nvillage population of 1,529 live in poverty.\n\nThe  proposed  scheme  aims  to  protect  land  and  properties  in  the  village  by  arresting\n19.\nbank erosion  through a combination of vegetative and structural measures to be undertaken by\nthe local community. The scheme will support community mobilization, replanting of mangroves,\nand construction of erosion control structures using locally available materials and technology.\n\nd. \n\nPanjang Island Seaweed Culture\n\n20.\nPanjang  in  South  Sumatra  Province  is  a  small  island  of  about  70  ha,  separated  from\nBanka  island  by  9  nautical  miles.  Panjang  is  not  inhabited  and  its  coastal  water  is  good  for\nnaturally grown seaweed. People of Tanjung village on Banka depend heavily on the naturally\ngrown seaweed for their livelihood, and increasing pressure has threatened the sustainability of\nthe  natural  seaweed.    To  ease  pressure  on  the  naturally  grown  seaweed,  a  small  number  of\nfishing communities have successfully commenced seaweed culture;  but the community needs\ntechnical and financial support for expansion.\n\n21.\nThe scheme will provide for community mobilization, training, linking the community with\na  rural  financing  institution  for  seed  capital,  and  technical  support  for  seaweed  farming,\npostharvest  processing,  and  marketing.  About  50  households  will  initially  participate  in  the\nscheme.\n\nD.\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n1.\n\nCoastal Marine Resource Planning and Management\n\nThe component will strengthen the capacity of local governments to sustainably manage\n22.\ntheir  marine  and  coastal  resources,  and  promote  the  development  and  use  of  spatial  plans\nfollowing  the  ICZPM  approach.  The  Project  provides  for  participation  of  local  communities  in\npreparing  management  plans,  transparency  in  allocation  of  resources,  and  improvement  of\nrelated  laws  and  regulations,  all  of  which  are  important  in  managing  natural  resources.  The\ncomponent  has  been  designed  for  environmental  protection,  and  no  negative  impact  is\nexpected.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 14, page 5\n\n2.\n\nSpatial Data and Information\n\n23.\nThe  component  will  generate  quality  data  and  information  on  marine  and  coastal\nmorphology, ecosystems, biodiversity, land use and land suitability in coastal zones, and related\nsocial and environmental issues. The component will also provide easy and systematic access\nto  these  information  and  data  that  will  help  increase  knowledge  of  the  resource  base  and\nfacilitate resource management for sustained benefits.\n\n3. \n\nLegislative Review and Law Enforcement\n\n24.\nThe component will contribute to strengthening the management of coastal and marine\nresources through improvement and enforcement of legal provisions for resource allocation and\nuse, and will have a positive impact on the environment.\n\n4. \n\nSmall-Scale Natural Resources Management Schemes\n\nMost  of  the  schemes  will  be  identified  during  project  implementation.  The  potential\n25.\nenvironmental  impact  and  the  mitigation  measures  incorporated  in  the  design  of  the  four\nrepresentative  schemes  identified  from  the  management  plans  of  the  predecessor  MREP  are\ndiscussed in the following paragraphs.\n\na.\n\nMangrove Rehabilitation and Mariculture\n\n26.\nThe  rehabilitation  of  mangrove  forests  will  have  positive  environmental  impact.  The\nmariculture  subcomponent  will  involve  culture  of  locally  available  fish  species  in  floating  nets\nunder  a  semi-intensive  production  system,  and  is  not  expected  to  cause  a  major  negative\nenvironmental  impact.  The  local  community  will  be  trained  in  managing  the  fish  nets,\ndetermining stock density and employing hygienic practices.\n\nb.\n\nTanjung Luar Mangrove and Silvofishery Development Scheme\n\n27.\nThe  potential  environmental  hazard  includes  the  discharge  of  nutrient-enriched  water\nfrom  the  ponds.  This  will  be  avoided  through  proper  design  of  the  ponds,  including  adequate\nprovision for flushing of discharges, and training in pond operation and maintenance.\n\nc.\n\nPendingin Erosion Control Scheme\n\n28.\nThe  major  potential  impacts  of  erosion  control  measures  could  include  changes  in\ncoastal hydrology and drainage systems affecting land areas and existing property values. Care\nhas  been  taken  to  avoid  such  impacts  by  not  depending  entirely  on  structural  measures  for\nerosion  control.  The  scheme  will  provide  for  a  combination  of  vegetative  and  structural\nmeasures,  the  latter  being  nonpermanent  in  nature.  The    project  design  will  not  change    the\nconfiguration of natural drains passing through the village, nor obstruct their outfalls.\n\nd.\n\nPanjang Island Seaweed Culture Scheme\n\n29.\nSeaweed culture can deplete the oxygen content of water if the carrying capacity in the\nproduction  area  is  exceeded.  This  may  reduce  fish  yields  as  well  as  the  yield  of  the  seaweed\nitself.  Because  of  the  inherent  disincentives,  seaweed  farmers  will  not  go  for  unrestrained\nexpansion of seaweed culture areas. Nonetheless, the technical support to be provided to the\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 14, page 6\n\ncommunity  will  include  lessons  on  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  and  best\nmanagement practices to prevent them.\n\n.  \n\nE.\n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\n30.\nThe overall responsibility for environmental monitoring of project activities will lie with the\nProject  Management  Office  (PMO)  to  be  established  in  MMAF.  The  PMO  will  coordinate  with\nprovincial  and  district  BAPPEDAs  and  sector  agencies  concerned  to  ensure  that  adequate\nmeasures  are  incorporated  in  the  design,  construction,  and  management  of  all  SNRMSs.  The\nfeasibility  report  on  each  scheme  will  include  an  IEE,  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s\nEnvironmental  Guidelines \nrelevant  sectors,  1998  Environmental  Assessment\nRequirements,  and  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  monitoring  requirements.  The  IEE  will  be\nsubmitted to BAPEDALDA/AMDAL Commission for review and approval. If the IEE determines\nthat the proposed SNRMSs generate a significant adverse impact, a detailed EIA will be carried\nout  for  the  scheme  and  a  summary  EIA  report  will  be  submitted  to  BAPEDALDA/AMDAL\nCommission  for  review  and  approval,  with  a  copy  to  ADB.  Implementation  of  a  scheme  will\ncommence only after the approval of the IEE or EIA by the appropriate authority.\n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n31.\nEnvironmental  monitoring  will  be  conducted  during  and  after  construction  of  SNRMSs,\nespecially for schemes that may have potential adverse impacts. Such schemes may relate to\ncoastal  infrastructure  (for  erosion  control,  navigation,  etc.)  and  mariculture.  While  specific\nparameters/indicators  to  be  monitored  will  depend  on  the  type,  nature,  and  location  of  the\nschemes, they may include the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nphysical  indicators  -  changes  in  the  direction  of  sea  currents,  strengths  of  sea\nwaves/swell, and turbidity of seawater, sunlight penetration, and nutrient content;\n\nchemical indicators - dissolved oxygen, salinity, biological oxygen demand (BOD)\nand chemical oxygen demand (COD) of basin water;\n\nbiological  indicators  -  microbiological  organisms,  and  zoo-  and  phytoplankton,\nfish disease; and\n\n(iv) \n\nsocioeconomic indicators - beneficiaries and benefits, and impacts on poverty.\n\nRegional  offices  of  BAPEDALDA  will  conduct \n\n32.\nthe\nenvironmental  impacts  of  the  project  activities.  The  project  monitoring  and  evaluation  (PME)\nsystem  to  be  established  under  the  Project  will  also  provide  for  environmental  monitoring  of\nselected schemes.\n\nthe  periodic  monitoring  of \n\nF.\n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n33.\nThe  IEE  confirms  that  the  project  design  is  oriented  to  sustainable  management  of\nmarine and coastal resources and environmental protection. This will be achieved through the\nimplementation  of  four  components,  all  of  which  have  been  carefully  designed.  The  only\ncomponent  that  requires  additional  care  and  attention  during  planning  and  implementation  to\navoid any adverse environmental impact is the SNRMSs component. SNRMSs will be identified\nin the management and action plans to be developed for MCMAs in the participating provinces,\nfollowing  an  ICZPM  concept  and  related  procedures.  Four  SNRMSs  identified  under  MREP\nhave been studied as representative schemes. While the SNRMSs are also aimed at promoting\nenvironmental protection, inadequate planning and design may result in adverse environmental\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 14, page 7\n\nimpact,  although  the  extent  and  intensity  of  such  impact  would  normally  be  small  and  can  be\navoided.  Nonetheless,  each  scheme  will  require  an  IEE,  and  the  IEE  findings  will  determine\nwhether an EIA will need to be prepared.\n\nG.\n\nConclusions\n\n34.\nProject activities should be monitored, especially those that may have potential adverse\nenvironmental  impact.  While  the  regional  BAPEDALDA  concerned  will  be  tasked  with  such\nmonitoring,  the  PME  system  to  be  designed  for  the  project  during  the  first  year  of  project\nimplementation  will  also  provide  for  periodic  environmental  monitoring  of  selected  activities  in\ncoordination with local institutions and participating communities.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 15, page 1\n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR\nCAPACITY BUILDING FOR DECENTRALIZED NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT\n\n1.\nThe  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  (i)  assess  the  implications  of  decentralization\nmeasures on the capacity of the provincial and district planning agencies for managing natural\nresources, both terrestrial and marine; and (ii) assist the Government in initiating a program for\ncapacity building of the planning agencies, particularly those at the district level. The TA will be\nimplemented in two phases.\n\n2.\n\nThe tasks to be undertaken under phase I are the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nAssess  the  relevance  of  the  roles  and  functions  of  the  Development  Planning\nAgencies  (BAPPEDA)  as  mandated  by  Presidential  Decree  No.  27/1980  and\nDecree  No.  185/1980  of  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  in  the  context  of  regional\nautonomy.

The overall small-scale schemes are expected\nto cost less than $1 million in each province over six years. Despite the small investment size,\nthe  small-scale  schemes  and  the  associated  capacity  building  initiatives  provide  opportunities\nfor local governments and communities to have hands-on practice in decentralized planning and\nimplementing small and affordable environment-friendly projects.\n\n2.\nThe  types  of  investment  initiatives  identified  range  from  coastal  fisheries,  coastal\nenvironmental  improvement,  and  alternative  livelihoods  that  promote  environment-friendly\npractices  for  sustained  income  generation.  For  illustrative  purposes,  four  models  were\ndeveloped  to  demonstrate  the  potential  costs  and  benefits  of  small-scale  schemes  that  the\nparticipating  provinces  identified:  (i)  seaweed  culture  development,  (ii)  sea  bass  cage  culture,\n(iii) silvofishery development, and (iv) mangrove rehabilitation to control coastal erosion.\n\n3.\nThe financial and economic analyses were carried out in 2000 constant prices and in the\nlocal  currency,  rupiah  (Rp).  The  economic  analysis  is  based  on  a  domestic  price  numeraire.\nAdjustments  for  economic  prices  reflect  mainly  the  removal  of  taxes  and  duties,  and  the\napplication  of  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  (SERF)  of  1.11,  equivalent  to  a  standard\nconversion factor (SCF) of 0.9. The base financial exchange rate is at $1.00=Rp8,000. The daily\nrural  wage rates in  mid-2000 varied from one place to another, within the range of Rp10,000-\nRp16,000. Given a situation of less than full employment in the rural areas, a shadow wage rate\nfactor of 0.9 was applied.\n\n4.\nFinancial  farmgate  prices  of  fish  and  shrimp  were  conservatively  estimated  at\nRp4,000/kilogram (kg) for miscellaneous fish, Rp20,000/kg for fresh sea bass, and Rp60,000/kg\nfor shrimp species of average grades. Farmgate prices of seaweed vary depending on proximity\nto processing facilities and destination markets in regional centers. A conservative estimate of\nRp1,400/kg was assumed for seaweed although prices in coastal areas of South Sulawesi have\nreached  as  high  as  Rp4,000/kg  depending  on  type,  moisture  content,  and  other  quality\nattributes.\n\nB.\n\nSeaweed Production\n\n5.\nSeaweed  production  offers  significant  potential  for  coastal  communities  to  generate\nemployment  and  incomes  in  an  environmentally  sustainable  manner.    Production  from  culture\ntechnology  has  proved  financially  viable  at  selected  sites  throughout  Indonesia.    Culture\ntechnology  is  best  practiced  using  floating  wooden  grid  systems  and  rafts.    Bottom  staking  of\nrope and wire grids can also be culture method, but is applicable only in limited sea areas with\nflat, sandy bottoms. As with other mariculture activities, site selection is critical. The need is for\nsheltered  areas  with  adequate  water  exchange,  proper  salinities,  good  water  quality,  and\naccess to local starter stock.\n\nThe  usual  culture  species  are  E.  cottonii,  Gelidiem,  Gracelaria,  E.  spinosum  and\n 6.\nHypnea. Seaweed is already produced commercially in many areas in Indonesia in response to\nan increasing market demand.  Typically, harvesting takes place after firm orders are received\nfrom local traders based in major cities. International buyers do exist, but their presence in rural\nIndonesia  is  still  very  limited.  Therefore  the  current  production  is  largely  for  domestic  food\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 16, page 2\n\nfor \n\nconsumption. Positive features of the industry include environment-friendly production systems;\nlow start-up costs for both investment and operations; technically simple operations of a variable\nscale;  suitability \nfamily-based  operations  with  equitable  gender  participation  and\nmanagement;  and  financial  viability  as  an  alternative  livelihood  to  reduce  pressure  on  coastal\nfisheries  and  coral  reefs.  Constraints  facing  the  industry  relate  primarily  to  the  nature  of  the\nemerging markets. Factors to consider include producer technical and managerial skills, tenure\nrights,  transportation,  and  quality  starter  stock.  To  overcome  those  constraints,  the  Project\nenvisages providing support services and assistance in developing technical skills and market\npotential.\n\n7.\nAn  indicative  model  of  a  family-based  seaweed  production  of  1  hectare  (ha)\ndemonstrates that the enterprise is viable with a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of about\n24  percent  (Table  A16.1).  Cash  funding  required  for  start-up  operations  is  estimated  at  Rp2.3\nmillion  (less  than  $300),  which  covers  investment  capital  costs  and  half  a  year  of  operating\nexpenses.  The  daily  return  to  a  self-employed  person  is  estimated  at  Rp18,000,  which  is\nsignificantly  higher  than  the  prevailing  average  rural  wage  rate  of  about  Rp13,000.  The\nseaweed  farm  is  expected  to  generate  about  260  person-days  of  employment  annually  per\nhectare of cultivation for four harvests. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for seaweed\nproduction is estimated at 29 percent.\n\nC.\n\nFish Cage Culture\n\n8.\nFish cage culture is practiced widely in Indonesia with a variety of species including sea\nbass  (Lates calcarifer),  milkfish  (Chanos chanos),  and  grouper  species  (e.g.,  Cromileptes\naltivelis, Epinephelus fuscoguttatus, etc.). Rearing techniques for each species vary.  Hatchery\nproduction  of  fry  is  important  in  creating  a  sustainable  fish  cage  culture  industry.    This  has\nhistorically  hampered  industry  growth.  However,  recent  developments  in  both  hatchery  and\nrearing  technologies,  especially  for  sea  bass,  have  provided  for  the  necessary  ingredients  for\nsustained growth.  Based on the availability of hatchery-bred fry, fish cage culture has opened\nup  as  an  attractive,  environmentally  sound  option  in  coastal  Indonesia.    Sea  bass,  known  as\nikan kakap putih in Indonesia, is a popular food fish throughout the country, and local fish with\ngrowing demands are accessible.\n\n9.\nPositive  features  of  fish  cage  culture  include  environment-friendly  operations,  with\nhatchery fry and cage density in any one area limited; potential to provide alternative livelihood\nto  fishers,  thus  relieving  pressure  on  natural  fisheries  resources;  and  suitability  for  location  in\ncoastal waters. The fish cage is typically made of net, wooden planks and anchors, for a volume\nof about 40 cubic meters. An indicative model of a sea bass cage culture demonstrates that the\nscheme  is  financially  viable  with  FIRR  of  about  35  percent,  offering  an  attractive  alternative\noccupation in rural coastal areas. Funding required for start-up operation is estimated at about\nRp14.3 million ($1,800). The daily return to labor is estimated at about Rp30,000, which is triple\nthe  prevailing  rural  wage  rate.  The  scheme  is  expected  to  generate  self-employment  of  260\ndays annually for a single-cage operation that can be easily managed by a family. The EIRR is\nestimated about 41 percent.\n\nD.\n\nSilvofishery\n\nIn Indonesia, silvofishery is a traditional technology that recognizes the importance of the\n10.\nmangrove  ecosystem  and  incorporates  mangroves  into  the  fishpond  system.  The  traditional\ndesign includes a central platform of mangroves, surrounded by a canal system. The system is\nsupplied  by  tidal  water  flowing  through  sluice  gates.  The  potential  harvest  depends  on  the\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 16, page 3\n\nnatural survival of fish, shrimps, and crustaceans trapped in the system. The mangroves, which\nmay cover up to 70 percent of the area, provide natural shelter, nutrition, and energy to the food\nchain, and maintain water quality.\n\nPositive features of the system include environment friendliness, with limited open water\n11.\nsurface and an intact mangrove ecosystem; attractive alternative income to relieve pressure on\ncapture fisheries; and appropriateness for coastal waters, which have suffered from depletion of\nmangroves. An indicative model of silvofishery shows a potential FIRR of about 23 percent, with\nattractive returns for community-based self-employment in rural coastal areas. Funding required\nfor the start-up investment is estimated at about Rp41 million, which covers more than 3 ha of\nthe integrated system, including 1 ha of fishpond area. Net income is expected to reach about\nRp13.5  million  ($1,700)  annually  over  10  years.  The  investment  is  expected  to  generate  an\nEIRR  of  about  29  percent.  The  scheme  is  expected  to  generate  24  person-months  of\nemployment annually, with net returns to labor exceeding Rp35,000 per person-day.\n\nE.\n\nMangroves and Coastal Erosion Control\n\n12.\nMangroves offer natural protection for erosion and abrasion on coastal areas, estuaries\nand  riverbanks.  An  illustrative  model  was  developed,  based  on  actual  conditions  of  a  coastal\nvillage at Mahakam Delta in East Kalimantan. The delta, on the west of Makassar Strait, covers\nabout 3,200 square kilometers and is rich in fisheries resources. The village has a population of\nabout  1,500  in  375  households.  Farming  and  small  business  activities  are  the  main  source  of\nincome for 270 households; the remaining 105 households largely depend on capture fishing for\ntheir livelihood. About 70 percent of the fisher households live along the river. The village has a\nshoreline  of  about  4.5  kilometers.  The  mangrove  along  the  riverbank  has  been  severely\ndamaged by human activities, exposing the riverbank to the effects of water currents and wave\nactions.  Erosion  has  occurred,  creating  a  surface  land  loss  at  a  rate  of  about  three  meters  a\nyear. About 10 meters of surface land areas have been washed into the river over the past three\nyears. Apart from the loss of valuable land, erosion has required the coastal villagers to move\nand rebuild their houses nearly every year.\n\n13.\nThe  illustrated  scheme  aims  to  arrest  riverbank  erosion  and  protect  scarce  land\nresources  and  properties  of  the  community  by  adopting  measures  such  as  (i)  constructing\nerosion protection structures at strategic locations, applying local materials and technologies; (ii)\nrestoring  mangroves  along  the  entire  stretch  of  the  affected  riverbank;  and  (iii)  informing  the\ncommunity  on  preventive  measures  against  bank  erosion.  The  local  community  has  shown\nstrong interest in the scheme, and willingness to contribute to the rehabilitation investment.\n\n14.\nThe cost of the scheme is estimated at Rp700 million ($87,500), comprising mangrove\nreplanting, erosion control structures, community mobilization, and nongovernment organization\n(NGO)  services.  The  investment  is  expected  to  yield  an  EIRR  of  about  12.3  percent,  drawing\neconomic  benefits  from  avoided  loses  of  land  and  property  belonging  to  disadvantaged\nvillagers.  The  value  of  land  losses  was  estimated  at  their  current  market  value/willingness  to\npay,  as  is,  without  accounting  for  the  potential  improvement  effects  of  the  Project.  Annual\navoidance of property damages was valued conservatively at 15 percent of the average market\nvalue (Rp5.5 million each) of existing houses, excluding movable belongings.\n\nF.\n\nSensitivity Analysis\n\n15.\nThe  expected  FIRRs  and  EIRRs  of  the  illustrative  models,  including  sensitivity  and\nswitching  values  to  declines  in  benefits  and  cost  increases,  are  shown  in  Tables  A16.1  and\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 16, page 4\n\nA16.2.  The  tables  showing  calculations  and  assumptions  for  the  financial  and  economic\nanalyses  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  Overall,  the  rates  of  return  are  sensitive  to\nreduction in benefits and increases in operating costs, but are generally robust to increases in\ninvestment  costs.  Nonetheless,  the  risks  of  reduction  in  benefits  can  be  minimized  through\nadoption  of  recommended,  relatively  simple,  and  well-proven  technology,  combined  with\nreasonable  management  practices  to  avoid  shortfalls  due  to  production  inefficiency  and\nspoilage.  Downward  price  risks  to  output  prices  are  minimal  in  the  local  markets,  given  the\nsteady consumer demand in the rural and urban areas. Conservative prices were assumed for\nthe base case scenario.\n\nTable A16.1: Sensitivity of Rates of Return to Declines in Benefits and Cost Increases\n\nModel\n\nBase Case\n\n10% Decline\nin Output or\nBenefits\n\n10 % Increase\nin Investment\nCosts\n\n10% increase in\nOperating Costs\n\nNPV\nRp000\n12%\n\nIRR\n(%)\n\nNPV\nRp000\n12%\n\nIRR\n  (%)\n\nNPV\nRp000\n12%\n\n 3.4\n 6.1\n16.1\n\n23.9\n35.0\n23.2\n\n-1,137\n-979\n6,732\n\n1,771\n3,825\n19,109\n\nFinancial\n     Seaweed Culture: 1 ha\n     Sea bass Cage Culture\n     Silvofishery: 1 ha\n     Mangrove:\n         Erosion Control\nEconomic\n     Seaweed Culture: 1 ha\n     Sea bass Cage Culture\n     Silvofishery: 1 ha\n     Mangrove:\n         Erosion Control\nna = not applicable, ha - hectare, IRR - internal rate of return, NPV - net present value.\n\n587\n-278\n14,162\n\n2,321\n4,118\n26,544\n\n2,014\n2,722\n23,246\n\n1,302\n2,275\n15,444\n\n7.2\n10.1\n21.3\n\n29.0\n40.6\n28.6\n\n10.0\n\n12.3\n\n-51\n\n-50\n\nna\n\nna\n\nna\n\nna\n\nna\n\n8\n\nIRR\n(%)\n\n20.5\n24.5\n20.4\n\nna\n\n26.3\n29.3\n25.5\n\n10.3\n\nNPV\nRp000\n12%\n\n-697\n285\n12,308\n\n-119\n926\n20,115\n\nIRR\n      (%)\n\n 7.1\n13.7\n19.3\n\n11.1\n18.5\n24.8\n\nna\n\nna\n\nna\n\nna\n\nTable A16.2: Switching Values at 12% for FIRR and EIRR\n\nModel\n\n% Decrease in\nBenefits\n\n% Increase in\nInvestment Costs\n\n% Increase in\nOperating Costs\n\n35.5\n24.7\n52.0\n\n  6.1\n  8.0\n15.5\n\nFinancial\n     Seaweed Culture: 1 ha\n     Sea bass Cage Culture\n     Silvofishery: 1 ha\n     Mangrove:\n        Erosion Control\nEconomic\n     Seaweed Culture: 1 ha\n     Sea bass Cage Culture\n     Silvofishery: 1 ha\n     Mangrove:\n        Erosion Control\nna = not applicable,  EIRR - economic internal rate of return, FIRR - financial internal rate of return, ha - hectare.\n\n76.0\n29.5\n80.5\n\n  8.0\n  9.4\n21.4\n\n  9.5\n12.9\n41.3\n\n  7.1\n10.8\n28.0\n\n     na\n\n  1.5\n\n   na\n\n  1.3\n\n   na\n\n   na\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 29 September 2000)\n", "    Currency Unit\n                                                  Rp1.00\n                                         $1.00\n", "\u2014\n=\n=\n", "Rupiah (Rp)\n$0.000114\nRp8,775\n", "For the purpose of calculation in this report, a rate of Rp8,000=$1.00 was used.\n", "BAKOSURTANAL -\n", "BAPEDAL\n", "BAPEDALDA\n", "BAPPEDA\n", "BAPPENAS\n", "CFRM\nCIDA\nCOREMAP\nCRMP\nDGCBSI\nDGF\nEA\nEIA\nEIRR\nFIRR\nGDP\nGIS\nIA\nICZPM\nIEE\nLIPI\nLREP\nMCMA\nMCS\nMMAF\nMOFEC\nMOHA\nMREP\nNBIN\nNGO\nNRMP\nNSC\nPIU\nPMO\nPSC\n", "ABBREVIATIONS\n", "Badan Koordinasi Survey dan Pemetaan Nasional\n(National Coordinating Agency for Survey and Mapping)\nBadan Pengendalian Dampak Lingkungan\n(National Agency for Environmental Impact Assessment)\nBadan Pengendalian Dampak Lingkungan Daerah\n(Provincial Environmental Impact Management Agency)\nBadan Perencanaan Pembangunan Daerah\n(Regional Development Planning Agency)\nBadan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional\n(National Development Planning Agency)\nCoastal Fisheries Resources Management\nCanadian International Development Agency\nCoral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Project\nCoastal Resources Management Project\nDirectorate General of Coasts, Beaches, and Small Islands\nDirectorate General of Fisheries\nexecuting agency\nenvironmental impact assessment\neconomic internal rate of return\nfinancial internal rate of return\ngross domestic product\ngeographic information system\nimplementing agency\nintegrated coastal zone planning and management\ninitial environmental examination\nIndonesian Institute of Sciences\nLand Resources Evaluation Project\nmarine and coastal management area\nmonitoring, control, and surveillance\nMinistry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries\nMinistry of Forestry and Estate Crops\nMinistry of Home Affairs and Regional Autonomy\nMarine Resources Evaluation Project\nNational Biodiversity Information Network\nnongovernment organization\nNatural Resources Management Project\nnational steering committee\nproject implementation unit\nproject management office\nprovincial steering committee\n", "-\n", "-\n", "-\n", "-\n", "-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n", "PSIC\nPTF\nSNRMS\nTA\nUSAID\n", "-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n", "provincial spatial information center\nprovincial task force\nsmall-scale natural resources management scheme\ntechnical assistance\nUnited States Agency for International Development\n", "NOTES\n", "(i) \n", "For  2000,  the  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  covers  1  April  to  31  December;  for\n2001 and onward, the FY will cover 1 January to 31 December.\n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars.\n"]}
