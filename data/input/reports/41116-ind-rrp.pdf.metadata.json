An \nwith \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  was \nalso  prepared \nthe  environmental  assessment  of \nsubprojects in future loans, including those that may be classified \nas  category  A.  The  Summary  IEE  of  Project  1  and  the  EARF  of \nthe program have been disclosed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \u201c120 \ndays\u201d rule . \n \nThe  proposed  Jammu  and  Kashmir  Urban  Sector  Development \nInvestment Program (the Program) will foster economic growth in \nthe state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). It involves the expansion \nof  basic  services,  such  as  water  supply,  sanitation,  waste \nmanagement,  urban  transport,  and  other  municipal  functions,  in \nJammu,  Srinagar,  and  other  important  towns  and  commercial \ncenters. The investment program  will also strengthen the service \ndelivery  capacity  of  the  responsible  state  urban  agencies  and \nurban local bodies (ULBs) through management reforms, capacity \nbuilding, and training.  \n \nThe  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF,  or  the  Facility)  will \nfinance  projects  under  the  investment  program,  provided  the \nGovernment of India and the government of J&K comply with the \nassurances  to  ADB  and  the  constituent  projects  are  in  line  with \nthose  assurances  and  with  the  criteria  set  out  in  the  Framework \nFinancing Agreement (FFA). \n \nADB  will  provide  loans  to  finance  projects  under  the  Facility  as \nsoon  as  the  projects  are  ready  for  financing  upon  submission  of \nsatisfactory  related  periodic  financing  request.  Each  loan  will \nconstitute  a  tranche  and  may  carry  terms  different  from  the \nfinancing terms of previous or later loans. The choice of financing \nterms  will  depend  on  the  project  and  ADB\u2019s  financing  policies  at \nthe  time  the  loan  is  documented  in  a  legal  document.  Tranches \nmay be provided in sequence or simultaneously, and may overlap. \n \n\nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironmental \nAssessment \n\n \nSector Investment \nProgram \n\nMultitranche Financing \nFacility \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nApart  from  the  national  priority  of  planned  development  of  major \nurban centers in India, the proposed investment program will also \nfoster economic revival in J&K, where trade, services, and tourism \nare the principal drivers of the economy. Low investment in asset \ncreation  and  in  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and  lack  of \nstructured institutional systems constrain growth in J&K. The state \ngovernment  intends  to  promote  economic  growth  through  better \nservice,  public  health,  and  environmental  conditions  by  investing \nin urban infrastructure and improving the management capabilities \nof its line agencies and the participating cities and towns. \n \nThe  core  strategy  is  to  provide  investment  funds  in  a  prioritized \nmanner,  building  on  the  infrastructure  rehabilitation  being  carried \nout  under  the  ongoing  loan  (2151-IND:  Multisector  Project  for \nInfrastructure  Rehabilitation  in  J&K),  with  planned  expansion  in \ntandem  with  urban  governance  improvements  and  reforms.  The \nstate needs to balance progress on reforms, priority infrastructure \ninvestments,  and  private  sector  investment  particularly  in  trade \nand  tourism.  A  sector  loan  with  an  MFF  offers  the  borrower  the \ninvestment  decisions  on  priorities  and \nflexibility  of  basing \nconstraints  defined  in  the  sector  policy  and  master  plans.  The \nsubsector  master  plans  being  developed  as  part  of  the  ongoing \nloan will form the basis for investments made under the Facility. \n \nSubsector  master  plans  and  growth  trends  indicate  a  need  for \nabout  $2  billion  equivalent \nto  2026) \nin \ninfrastructure  investments  in  the  principal  centers.  The  state \nproposes to obtain about $1.29 billion of this amount for the most \nurgent  requirements  from  various  funding  sources  including  the \nproposed  Program  and  the  ongoing  Jawaharlal  Nehru  National \nUrban  Renewal  Mission  (JNNURM),  the  urban  reform  and \ninvestment program supported by the Government. \n \n\nlonger-term \n\n(up \n\nii \n\n \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProgram Investment Plan  \n\n \n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nFacility Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \n\niii\n\nis  expected \n\nto  sustain  economic  growth  by \nThe  Program \nimproving urban infrastructure services and urban management in \nJammu and Srinagar, and selected towns and commercial centers \nin  the  state.  The  priorities  and  constraints  are  addressed  in  the \nsector policy and master plan. The subsector master plans, which \nare being updated as part of the ongoing loan, will form the basis \nfor later investments. \n \nThe proposed investment program will improve public health, the \nliving  environment,  and  employment  opportunities  for  the  2.4 \nmillion  people  living  in  Srinagar,  Jammu,  and  other  participating \ntowns of commercial importance. It will also improve the capacity \nthe  new  municipal \nof  participating \ncorporations  of  Jammu  and  Srinagar,  to  manage  sector  reforms \nand deliver services.  \n \nThe  investment  program  will  not  hinder  or  adversely  affect  any \nethnic  groups  or  indigenous  peoples.  On  the  other  hand,  it  will \nbenefit everyone in the investment program area. \n \nIndia  has  requested  ADB  to  finance  the  investment  program \nthrough  an  MFF.  The  total  cost  of  the  investment  program  is \nestimated  at  $485  million,  including  $44.3  million  in  taxes  and \nduties. \n \n \n\ninstitutions,  particularly \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Jammu and \n\nKashmir \n\nTotal Cost \n($ million) \n300 \n185 \n\nShare \n(%) \n62 \n38 \n\n \n\n100 \n\n485 \n\nTotal  \n\n \n \nA facility of up to $300 million from the ordinary capital resources \nof  ADB  will  be  provided  to  India  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility.  \n \nThe Government of India will cause the state government of J&K \nto  use  the  proceeds  of  each  tranche  for  the  expenditures  of  the \ninvestment  program,  according  to  the  conditions  set  forth  in  the \nFFA and the legal agreements for each tranche.  \n \nEconomic Reconstruction Agency (ERA), Jammu and Kashmir \n \nThe  Government  of  India,  according  to  its  current  policy,  will \nrelend 90% of the first loan as a grant and 10% as a loan to the \nstate  government  of  J&K.  The  latter,  in  turn,  will  transfer  all  the \nfunds as a grant to the Executing Agency. \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n\n \nEstimated Program \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nthe \n\nforeign  exchange  and \n\nThe  Government  will  assume \ninterest-rate risks for the loans under the Facility.  \n \nThe  Government  will  provide  the  proceeds  of  future  loans  under \nthe  Facility  to  the  J&K  government  on  terms  and  conditions \napplicable to the Government\u2019s own lending at the time the loan is \ndocumented in a legal document. \n \nThe investment program resources will tentatively be available in \nfour  tranches  until  December  2015  (the  last  periodic  financing \nrequest  is  expected  to  be  submitted  by  31  August  2013). \nDepending  on  the  speed  of  reforms,  the  development  of  ERA\u2019s \ncapacity,  and  demand,  the  proposed  four  tranches  could  be \nconverted to five or six tranches.  \n \n30 June  2015 \n\nresponsible \n\n \nThe  ERA,  under  its  chief  executive  officer  (CEO),  will  be  the \nExecuting  Agency  (EA)  of \ninvestment  program.

An executive committee established by \nthe State, shall be responsible to guide ERA on matters related to \nProject activities. For day to day administration, the CEO shall be \nguided by the Executive Committee. It consists of the department \nheads of the state line agencies and is headed by the CEO of the \nERA. \n \nTwo  project  management  units  (PMUs)  have  already  been \ncreated  under  the  ERA  for  the  implementation  of  the  ongoing \nLoan  2151-IND  and  for  the  proposed  investment  program  in \nSrinagar and Jammu. Each PMU is headed by a full-time project \ndirector,  reporting  to  the  CEO,  ERA.  The  PMUs  will  identify, \nappraise,  formulate,  and  implement  all  subprojects  and  ensure \ncompliance  with  the  social  and  environmental  safeguard  policies \nof  the  state,  the  country,  and  ADB.  City  and  towns  based  local \nsteering  committees  will  be \ninteraction \nbetween  the  ERA  and  the  ULBs  and  line  agencies,  lead  urban \nmanagement programs, and disseminate information. \n \n\nfacilitate \n\nformed \n\nto \n\n \nCommunity Participation  Community  priorities  expressed  during  participatory  planning  will \nbe considered in the planning and design of facilities, particularly \nthose  in  low-income  areas.

The  basic  urban  services  in  the  main  towns  are  dilapidated \nand grossly undersized due in part to in-migration from the rural areas and partly due to a lack \nof investment. However, economic activity is improving and the service sector which has grown \nover the last 5 years now contributes more than 50% of the state\u2019s gross domestic product. The \nplanned  and  sustainable  growth  of  the  urban  centers,  particularly  the  two  principal  cities  of \nSrinagar and Jammu, where the bulk of trade and commerce takes place, is an essential part of \nJ&K\u2019s economic strategy, as stated in its 11th Five Year Plan (2007\u20132012). \n \nJ&K, spread over an area of 222,236 square kilometers (km2), comprises three distinct \n3. \nregions\u2014Jammu,  Kashmir,  and  Ladakh\u2014divided  into  14  districts,  with  a  population  of \n10.14 million (2001 census). The population is mostly rural, the urban population being less than \n25% (24.81%). The urban population of 2.52 million (2001 census) is distributed over 75 census \ntowns, but about 63% live in Jammu and Srinagar. Jammu and Srinagar are important trading \ncenters for the surrounding predominantly rural areas. Some district centers are growing tourist \ndestinations, which also require support with planning, developmental controls and financing of \nbasic infrastructure to encourage and support private sector investments. \n \n4. \nIn  Jammu  and  Srinagar  only  40%  of  the  population  has  access  to  safe  drinking  water \nand  more  than  32%  of  the  urban  population lives  in  slums where  basic  amenities are  lacking. \nThe  new  settlements  in  Srinagar  and  Jammu,  swelled  with  600,000  migrants  from  the  rural \nareas,  lack  piped  water,  proper  sanitation,  and  proper  road  access.  Improving  literacy  is \nincreasing  the  aspirations  of  the  younger  urban  population  for  better  economic  opportunities, \npublic  health,  cleaner  environment  and  better  quality  of  life.  Public  demand  for  improvements \nhas increased since the first municipal elections in Jammu and Srinagar were held in 2005.   \n \n \n \n5. \nTens of thousands of pilgrims visit religious shrines in the area for various festivals and \nalong with the increasing tourists, both domestic and foreign, require better facilities to protect \nthe  fragile  environment.  Srinagar  in  particular  has  a  large  tourist  population  in  the  summer \nmonths,  drawn  by  the  world-famous  Dal  Lake  and  the  tourist  areas  in  Kashmir,  including  the \nregional towns and pristine mountain areas, to which the city is the gateway.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nThe 2001 populations in Srinagar and Jammu2 were 971,357 and 607,642, respectively. \n6. \nThe  outdated  and  undersized  urban  facilities  suffer  weak  operation  and  management.  More \nthan 96% of the households in both cities have access to piped water, but with more than 50% \nsystem losses due to leaks, illegal connections, and poor records. Ad hoc and partial extension \nof the distribution network to provide basic services to the migrant areas has led to low levels of \n                                                 \n1 The design and monitoring framework for the investment program is in Appendix 1.  \n2  Only the municipal area and not the surrounding urban agglomeration. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nsupply,  particularly  in  Jammu,  where  some  areas  receive  only  1\u20132  hours  of  water  per  day. \nWater supply operations in both cities suffer acutely from frequent and extended electric supply \nshortages, low voltage, and low pressure at higher points and ends of the distribution systems. \nTo  address  the  most  urgent  needs,  ADB  provided  Loan  2151-IND3 (the  ongoing  project)  to \nrehabilitate  the  water  supply  systems  including  pumping  machinery,  treatment  plants,  and  the \ntransmission  and  distribution  network.  Water  supply  in  the  key  towns  and  commercial  centers \nrequires  expansion,  and  new  sewerage  systems  and  improved  solid  waste  management  are \nneeded to protect public health and the environment. \n \n7. \nSrinagar  and  Jammu  lack  piped  systems  for  sewage  collection  and  requires  more \ntreatment  capacity.  While  many  houses  in  the  less  densely  populated  areas  of  Jammu  have \nseptic tanks, most houses in the more congested parts of Jammu and Srinagar discharge their \nwastes  into  open  surface  drains  endangering  public  health  and  water  quality  in  local  streams, \nrivers, and lakes. In the older sections of both cities night soil is commonly collected manually \nand  improperly  disposed  into  local  drains  and  solid  waste  containers.  The  regional  towns  and \ncommercial centers have no sewage collection and disposal facilities. Most dwellings rely on pit \nlatrines and commercial developments use septic tanks. \n \n8. \nIn Srinagar, the fragile ecosystem of lakes and water bodies is seriously endangered by \nthe  discharge  of  untreated  municipal  sewage  and  dumping  of  solid  wastes.  Lakes  and  other \nwater  bodies  are  becoming  increasingly  polluted  by  sewage  from  surrounding  residential  and \ncommercial developments, and the hundreds of houseboats on the lakes which are popular with \ntourists, causing eutrophic conditions with heavy weed and algal growth. Unless the pollution is \nintercepted,  the  water  quality  will  continue  to  deteriorate  damaging  the  environment  and \ndiscouraging tourism. Under a program sponsored by the Government, sewage collection and \ntreatment facilities are being built to intercept and treat sewage from the areas around Dal Lake. \nBut  additional  funding  is  needed  to  connect  properties  to  the  street  lines  and  to  extend  the \nsewage  networks.  The  ongoing  project  is  rehabilitating  sewerage  and  drainage  pumping \nstations  and  updating  integrated  sewerage  and  drainage  master  plans  to  guide  the  additional \ninvestments in cities and towns participating in the Program. \n \n9. \nLess than half of the municipal solid waste (MSW) in Srinagar and Jammu is collected. \nMSW in Srinagar goes to a designated dump site, but this operation is unscientific and receives \nbiomedical  wastes  and  night  soil.  The  site  threatens  the  quality  of  groundwater,  emits  odors, \nattracts  flies  and  other  vectors  and  requires  upgrading  or  closure.  Jammu  has  no  designated \ndisposal  area  and  solid  waste  is  indiscriminately  dumped  in  drains  and  along  riverbanks, \ncausing  grave  risk  to  water  quality,  the  environment  and  health  of  downstream  users.  In  the \nsmaller district towns and tourist areas, collection is not organized and indiscriminate dumping is \nthreatening not only the health of local citizens but also the environment. \n \nTraffic  congestion  caused  by  security  operations,  lack  of  regulation,  and  the  growing \n10. \nnumbers  of  personal  vehicles  is  not  only  costing  productive  time  and  wasted  fuel  but  also \ncausing  air  pollution  in  both  cities.  While  the  ongoing  project  is  rehabilitating  roads  and  some \nbridges, it will not build new facilities. City growth strategies and updated master plans are being \ndeveloped to guide investments under the Program. \n \n11. \nThe  earthquake  on  8  October  2005,  which  devastated  large  areas  in  neighboring \nPakistan  and  caused  extensive  damage  in  northwest  areas  of  J&K,  underscored  the  need  for \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to India \nfor the Multisector Project for Infrastructure Rehabilitation in Jammu and Kashmir. Manila (Loan 2151-IND, for $250 \nmillion, approved on 22 December 2004).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n\n \n\ndisaster  mitigation  measures.  As  most  of  the  state  is  in  earthquake  zone  5  (severe  risk)  new \nand existing building will need to be strengthened against earthquakes. \n \n12. \nUrban Planning and Governance. J&K has special status within the Indian Union and \nis  not  required  to  follow  the  provisions  of  the  74th  Constitutional  Amendment  Act,  which \nempowers  local  city  governments.  But  the  state  introduced  the  revised  Municipal  Act  in  2000 \nand  held  elections  in  Jammu  and  Srinagar  in  2005.  However,  effective  urban  management  is \nconstrained by the multiplicity of institutions with overlapping responsibilities and lack of funds. \nThe functions of the municipal corporations of Jammu and Srinagar are confined to public health \nservices such as SWM, food quality, vital statistics, vector control, building regulation and other \nbasic  development  management  functions.  Water  supply  and  sewerage,  and  drainage  are \nrespectively  provided  by  the  Public  Health  Engineering  Department  (PHED)  and  the  Urban \nEnvironmental  Engineering  Department  (UEED)  of  the  state.  Local  authorities  are  responsible \nfor town planning and land development but do not have the capacity to make or enforce plans. \nAs a result ad hoc and unplanned building activity, sale of public lands, and unregulated urban \nexpansion have resulted. \n \n13. \nInstitutional  Finances.  All  cities  and  towns  rely  on  the  state  for  about  80%  of  their \nbudget. Their local revenues are limited to rentals from commercial establishments and building \npermit  fees,  which  have  not  kept  up  with  the  market.  Property  tax  as  provided  for  under  the \nMunicipal  Act  is  not  implemented  by  the  cities.  Less  than  50%  of  water  consumers  are \nregistered  and  billed,  and  PHED  only  charges  50%  of  the  cost  of  providing  the  water  supply \nservices. Moreover, it collects from only about half of those billed, so the revenues only account \nfor  about  11%  of  the  actual  costs.  Power  supply,  the  most  significant  cost  of  water  supply, \nparticularly in Jammu, are directly paid by the state and are not recovered from users by PHED.     \n \n14. \nRevenue  generation  and  budgeting  by  the  cities  is  hampered  by  the  lack  of  their  own \nrevenue  sources,  irregular  fund  transfers  from  the  state  to  PHED  and  UEED,  and  outdated \naccounting  practices.  The  bulk  of  financial  resources  are  spent  on  salaries  and  administration \nexpenses, leaving limited resources for operation and maintenance (O&M). J&K is committed to \nmaking services more efficient and service providers more accountable to citizens. The state is \na  signatory  to  the  Urban  Reforms  Initiative  Fund  Program  of  the  Government,  under  which \nstates must show their commitment to accounting and cost recovery reforms to gain access to \ngrants under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM). JNNURM is a \ncentral  government  initiative  to  assist  63  major  cities  of  India  with  their  urban  infrastructure \nprojects on the basis of comprehensive development plans and commitment to a range of urban \nsector  reforms.  The  conditions  for  JNNURM  grant  funds  are  basically  the  same  as  those  of \nADB.  As  part  of  its  urban  road  map,  the  state  is  incorporating  JNNURM  funds  for  the \ndevelopment of Srinagar and Jammu.   \n \nExternal  Assistance.  The ongoing project is the first major external assistance to J&K \n15. \nin  the  past  20  years.  Appendix  2  gives  details  of  external  support  to  the  urban  sector  in  India \nand shows that since 1993, ADB has provided 31 technical assistance (TA) grants and 12 loans \namounting  to  $17  million  and  $2.9  billion,  respectively.  The  assistance  has  been  aimed  at \npoverty  reduction  through  shared  growth,  social  development,  and  good  governance.  These \nobjectives  have  been  translated  into  action  through  integrated  urban  infrastructure  projects. \nADB provided a project preparation technical assistance (PPTA) 4515-IND4 for the Program. \n \n16.   Ongoing  Project. The ongoing project has been under implementation for the past 24 \nmonths.  Contracts  worth  $80  million  in  ADB  financing  have  already  been  awarded  and  $10 \n                                                 \n4   ADB.  2004.  Technical  Assistance  to  India  for  Preparing  the  Proposed  JKUSDP.  Manila  (PPTA  4515-IND  for \n\n$500,000, approved on 22 December 2004).  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nmillion have been disbursed. At the current rate of progress, the detailed design and tendering \nof  all  civil  works  packages  under  the  project  will  be  completed  by  September  2007.  The \nprogress is generally satisfactory, especially given the special circumstances in J&K. \n \nLessons. ADB\u2019s experience in the urban sector in India as summarized in the recently \n18. \ncompleted  urban  sector  study5 shows  that  urban  sector  projects  are  inherently  complex  and \ntheir  implementation  requires  close  coordination  between  several  agencies,  experienced  staff \nand  strong  support  from  senior  levels  of  the  state  government.  Institutional  reforms  such  as \nincreases  in  water  supply  and  sewerage  tariffs  are  needed  but  are  not  acceptable  unless \npreceded  by  infrastructure  expansion,  improvement  of  services  and  extensive  stakeholder \nconsultation.  Even  modest  increases  in  property  tax,  tariff  structures  and  reforms  in  municipal \nmanagement  are  difficult.  Land  acquisition,  resettlement  and  statutory  clearances  from  central \nand  state  agencies  such  as  the  National  Highways  Authority  of  India,  state  pollution  control \nboards, railways and forest departments need to be taken into account at the design stage.  \n \n19. \nImplementation of urban projects is slow mainly due to a lack of experience with major \ninvestment  programs.  Experienced  dynamic  high-level  project  leadership  by  the  executing \nagency (EA) and adequately trained and experienced staff are prerequisites. These are lacking \nwith  state  agencies  and  cities,  especially  when  it  is  their  first  externally  aided  project. \nCompliance with the safeguards and guidelines of the state, India and ADB requires provision of \nsupport and training. The lack of experienced consultants and contractors in the urban sector is \na  major  cause  of  delays,  exacerbated  by  the  booming  economy.  These  human  resource \nconstraints are slowing planning, design, procurement and construction activities on all projects \nincluding the ongoing one in J&K. Contracts, particularly for sewerage works often have to be \nextended  to  more  than  twice  the  contracted  period.  The  ongoing  project  in  J&K  indicates  that \ncapable contractors are more likely to bid for larger rather than smaller packages. \n  \n20. \nAnother  reason  for  slow  implementation  in  the  past  has  been  lack  of  project \npreparedness  by  the  EAs  resulting  in  more  than  2  years  of  time  lost  while  the  EA  was  being \nstaffed and consultants were recruited. Lack of data and information during project preparation \nimpedes project planning, substantially delays design and implementation, leads to changes in \nscope and time overruns. The average time to complete urban projects in India is 8 years.  \n \n21. \nThese  lessons  were  incorporated  in  the  formulation  of  the  proposed  Program.  The \ncomponents of the project were selected after extensive consultation with various stakeholders \ntaking  their  priorities  and  demands  into  account  in  the  design.  The  institutional  development \ncomponent  is  designed  to  ensure  the  availability  of  adequate  financial  resources  for  O&M \nthrough  well-defined,  regular,  and  targeted  fund  transfers  from  the  state  to  the  responsible \ninstitutions in the near to mid term, enhancement of staff capacities through structured training \nand  skill  upgrading  programs,  and  gradual  transformation  of  user  departments  toward  more \nbusiness-oriented operations. Further, the priority investments are linked to incremental reforms \nwith substantive support for reforms and capacity building as part of the first tranche. Capacity-\nbuilding  activities  in  the  road  map  include  support  for  the  transition  to  modern  accounting \nsystems in the municipal corporations, business process improvements through e-governance, \nlegislative  changes  and  other  institutional  development  activities,  hands-on  training  in  project \nimplementation, and support for knowledge management. \n \n22. \nProgram Rationale. The rationale for the Program includes the Government\u2019s priority to \nimprove  planning  and  development  of  major  urban  centers,  and  the  economic  revival  of  J&K. \nThe  state  intends  to  promote  economic  growth  by  improving  service  levels,  public  health  and \n\n                                                 \n5 ADB. 2006. Special Evaluation Study on Urban Sector Strategy and Operations. Manila (June).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n \n\n \n\nenvironmental  conditions,  and  management  capabilities  in  state  line  departments  and  in  the \nparticipating  cities.  The  core  strategy  is  to  provide  investment  funds  in  a  prioritized  manner, \nbuilding  on  the  rehabilitation  of  essential  infrastructure  under  the  ongoing  loan  with  planned \nexpansion  in  tandem  with  improvements  and  reforms  in  urban  governance  in  the  participating \ncities.  The  Government\u2019s  JNNURM  proposals  have  been  incorporated  in  the  design  of  the \nProgram  and  the  sector  loan  format  provides  the  flexibility  to  balance  physical  expansion  with \nurban  reforms  and  capacity  development  over  the  8  year  Program  period.  The  master  plans \nbeing updated under the current loan will form the basis for later investments in the Program.  \n \n23. \nThe  master  plans  and  projected  urban  growth  patterns  have  been  used  to  develop  a \nroad map for about $2 billion of investments in urban related infrastructure through 2026 in the \nJammu, Srinagar and key towns and commercial centers in J&K. The state proposes to obtain \nfunding for the most urgent works required over the next 10 years estimated to cost $1.26 billion \nas  follows;  $110  million  from  the  ongoing  ADB-financed  project,  about  $200  million  from \nongoing planned expenditures, $500 million from JNNURM and $454 million under the Program. \nThe  remaining  $740  million  required  in  the  latter  part  of  the  20-year  period  would  be  raised \nthrough  a  combination  of  state  and  Government  support,  commercial  borrowings,  and  public-\nprivate partnership arrangements, which should evolve as the two cities improve their financial \nsituation over the next 10\u201315 years. \n \nThe road map for the Program includes extensive support for institutional development. \n24.  \nThe  principal  reforms  include:  (i) cost-reflective  and  volume  based  tariffs  for  water  supply  and \nsewerage services, (ii) property tax, (iii) transfer of responsibility for water supply and sewerage \nservices  in  Srinagar  and  Jammu  to  semiautonomous  water  and  sewerage  boards,  (iv)  locally \ndriven  urban  planning  and  control,  and  (vi)  development  of  public-private  partnerships  in \nprovision  of  services.  Legislation  already  is  in  place  for  volume  based  charges  for  water  and \nsewage,  and  for  property  tax.  Further  legislation  to  strengthen  the  fledgling  municipal \ncorporations may be required to transfer the responsibility for provision water and sewage to the \ncities  from  the  current  state  departments.  Capacity  building  includes  transition  to  modern \naccounting  systems \nthe  municipal  corporations,  computerization,  business  process \nimprovements  through  e-governance,  hands-on  training  in  project  planning,  design  and \nimplementation, and support for knowledge management activities. \n \n\nin \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n25. \nThe  proposed  Program  will  improve  urban  services  to  Indian  standards  in  the  main \nurban  areas  of  J&K,  promote  commerce,  improve  service  access  by  the  poor  and  generally \nsupport the reviving economy of the state. It will improve public health, the urban environment \nand  living  conditions  for  the  2 million  people  projected  to  live  in  the  two  principal  cities  of \nSrinagar and Jammu and the participating towns, as well as for the growing numbers of tourists.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n26. \nThe outputs of the investment program are grouped into two parts. Part A will improve \n(i) water  supply  systems,  by  rehabilitating  and  expanding  distribution  networks  and  setting  up \nnew supply systems; (ii) sewerage and sanitation, by extending existing systems, constructing \nnew  ones,  and  supplying  sanitation  maintenance  equipment;  (iii)  MSW  collection,  processing, \ntreatment,  and  disposal  through  sanitary  landfills;  (iv)  road  and  intersection  capacity,  road \nsafety, and  pedestrian overpasses; and (v) other municipal facilities that may be prioritized as \nthe master plans are updated and finalized in the participating towns and cities. Part B covers \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nmanagement  and  implementation  support  required  to  implement  the  physical  works  and  a \ncomprehensive capacity-building and institutional development program that will result in a more \nresponsive state system, empowered local governments, a separate entity for managing water \nsupply and sewerage services on modern business principles, improved financial performance \nof the local bodies and service providers, and overall improved levels of service to citizens.  \n \n\n1. \n\nPart A: Urban Infrastructure and Services Improvement \n\n \n27.  Water  Supply.  With  the  rehabilitation  of  the  water  supply  systems  in  Srinagar  and \nJammu under the ongoing project, adequate water supply production, treatment, transmission, \nand distribution capacity is expected to be available by 2009 to meet the water supply needs of \nthe  projected  population  in  both  cities  until  2020  and  capacity  expansion  will  be  limited. \nHowever, there will be a strong focus on better management of water supply operations through \na demand management and metering plan. Works will be selected according to the master plan \npriorities and the outcome of the leakage detection and hydraulic modeling studies done under \nthe ongoing project. Combined with the ongoing project, the Program will provide water of good \nquality and adequate pressure, commensurate with Indian standards of 135 liters per capita per \nday,  in  all  areas  of  the  two  principal  cities  by  2012.  The  Program  will  also  rehabilitate  and \nexpand  water  supply  systems  in  Pahalgam,  Gulmarg,  Sonamarg,  Patnitop,  and  other  towns \nselected for their economic importance to the state. \n \n28. \nSewerage and Drainage. Consistent with government policy, sewerage investments will \nfocus  on  high  density  areas  where  piped  underground  sewerage  is  the  best  alternative  for \nimproving sanitation and public health. Separate collection systems will be installed in the more \nrecently  developed  areas  of  the  cities  and  district  towns  where  road  carriageways  are  wide \nenough.  But  in  the  old  city  core  areas  where  streets  are  narrow  a  combined  system  for \ncollecting sewage and storm water, with treatment of the dry weather flow will be provided. In \ncongested areas where there may be no room to install conventional systems, community/public \nsanitation facilities connected to the water and sewerage networks will be set up. The Program \nwill provide sewage collection and treatment for 75% and 30% respectively of the urban areas \nof Srinagar and Jammu, with the remainder being provided by JNNURM as required. Drainage \nrehabilitation  works  in  the  ongoing  project  are  addressing  the  most  urgent  problems  and  the \nmaster plans being prepared will identify further works under the Program.  \n \nSolid Waste Management (SWM).6 The SWM works aim to increase service coverage \n29. \nto 100% in both cities and participating district towns. The feasibility of linking the Program with \nthe Carbon Market Initiative7 and the Clean Development Mechanism8 will be explored as part \nof  detailed  planning.  The  state  will  ensure  that  biomedical  waste  from  private  hospitals  and \nclinics  is  disposed  of  as  legislated.  But  facilities  for  collecting  and  properly  disposing  of \nbiomedical wastes from public hospitals will be incorporated in the Program.   \n                                                 \n6 Due  to  recent  ongoing  discussion  between  Srinagar  Municipal  Corporation  and  the  local  residents,  the  SWM \nsubproject appraised under Project 1 maybe shifted from the existing to a new site. ADB may consider this change \nif  it  becomes  necessary  subject  to  compliance  by  the  State  and  ERA  of  all  requirements  of  the  Loan  Agreement \nand applicable policies and procedures of ADB, India and the state; in which case loan funds may be available for \nthe subproject in the new site subject to compliances with all requirements under the Loan Agreement.. Additionally \nif the site is to be relocated the loan funds may also be used to finance proper closure of the existing site.    \n\n7  The  Carbon  Market  Initiative  (CMI)  was  established  by  ADB  (following  the  Kyoto  Protocol)  to  support  the \nsustainable  development  goals  of  developing  member  countries,  address  concerns  related  to  global  climate \nchange,  and  assist  developed  countries  in  meeting  their  emission  reduction  commitments.  CMI  will  provide  for \neligible  projects  and  their  development  a  project  cofinancing  facility,  carbon  credit  marketing  program,  and \ntechnical support for project preparation and implementation of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). \n\n8   An  arrangement  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  allowing  industrialized  countries  with  a  greenhouse  gas  reduction \ncommitment  to  invest  in  projects  ensuring  emission  reduction  and  sustainable  development  in  developing \ncountries. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n \n\n \n\n \n30. \nUrban  Transportation.  The  Program  will  improve  or  provide  (i)  connectivity  through \nexpansion of transportation facilities to major activity centers and towns (ii) facilities for off-street \nparking;  (iii)  pedestrian  safety  through  subways  and  overpasses;  (iv)  street  lighting;  and  (v) \nbridges and grade-separator flyovers or underpasses to decongest traffic, reduce pollution, and \nimprove the efficiency of public transport systems.  \n \n31. \nOther Municipal and Urban Infrastructure. This component could include preservation \nof heritage, park and lake improvement, and other public facilities that may be identified in the \nmaster  plans  and  economic  opportunity  development  plans  (EODPs)  for  the  economically \nimportant  towns.  Selected  public  buildings  in  Srinagar  and  Jammu  such  as  schools  and \nhospitals may also be retrofitted to reduce earthquake damage. \n \n32. \nUnder the first project of the Facility (Project 1) 4 subprojects, representative of the type \nof infrastructure investments envisioned under the Program, have been identified and prepared \nfor the water supply, sewerage, SWM and urban transportation subsectors. These subprojects \ninclude the environmentally sensitive SWM component in Srinagar and the Bannihal Cart road \nexpansion  in  Jammu,  for  which  a  full  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  (Supplementary \nAppendix  G).  The  process  of  identifying  and  appraising  the  technical,  economical,  financial, \nsocial,  and  environmental  aspects  of  these  subprojects  will  be  adopted  for  all  subsequent \nsubprojects. Detailed design and tender documents of these 4 subprojects have been finalized.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPart  B:  Capacity  Building,  Institutional  Development,  Governance,  and \nInvestment Program Management \n\n \n33. \nThe  capacity-building  program  will  support  the  state\u2019s  urban  institutional  and  financial \nreform  agenda  with  particular  emphasis  on  developing  the  fledgling  municipal  corporations  of \nSrinagar  and  Jammu  into  viable  entities  by  2015.  The  institutional  development  will  develop \nmunicipal  management  capability  including  planning,  budgeting,  accounting,  computerization, \nrevenue enhancement and e-governance. The key actions to be supported are as follows:   \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nStrengthening  the  urban  development  and  environmental  policy  framework  for \nland  use  and  zoning,  slum  improvements  and  provision  of  basic  services, \nincluding human resource requirement. The outputs will clarify institutional roles \nand  responsibilities,  need  for  legislative  amendments  or  bylaws,  administrative \norders,  and  a  framework  for  state-level  capacity  building,  including  support  for \ntraining in municipal management and the formulation of options for reorganizing \nthe water supply and sewerage operations in the state; \n\nInstituting  capacity  related  to  property  taxation,  including  the  amendment  or \npreparation of bylaws, a property tax cadastre, and application software as part \nof  revenue  management  measures.  Other  actions  include  the  empowerment  of \nthe  municipal  corporations  to  revise  property  tax  rates  and  tariffs,  billing  and \ncollection, and fund-based computerized accounting and audits;   \n\nStrengthening  the  capacity  of  engineers  in  line  agencies  through  training. \nTraining  would  be  provided  through  the  Institute  of  Public  Management  and \nAdministration or similar local institution with the requisite skills, which would also \nbe strengthened with support from the Program; and \n\n(iv)  Mainstreaming \n\nthrough  consultations  and \ndisclosure  through  seminars,  workshops,  and  documentation  of  case  studies, \nplus the use of local print media and web- and non-web-based newsletters.  \n\ninvolvement  of \n\nthe  public \n\nthe \n\n \n\n \n\n\fCapacity-Building  Assistance  for  More  Efficient  Service  Delivery.  For  water  and \n34. \nsewerage  this  will  include  assistance  in  creating,  in  each  of  the  two  main  cities,  a \nsemiautonomous  entity  or  board  equipped  with  modern  operating  and  financial  management \ntools and skills. The entities will be established as efficient, self-sufficient, and commercially run \nservice  providers  working  under  the  overall  policy  direction  of  the  municipal  corporations,  but \nindependent in their day-to-day administration from the corporations and the state line agencies. \nSupport will also be provided in exploring and developing options for introducing private sector \nparticipation in the delivery of services.  \n \n35.  Management  of  the  Investment  Program.  This  component  will  provide  funds  for \nimplementing  the  Program,  development  and  updating  of  various  master  plans,  incremental \nadministration  costs,  consulting  services  for  design  and  construction  supervision,  project \nmanagement and quality control, information dissemination, and the planning, appraisal, survey, \nand detailed design of the subprojects for the next tranche. The acquisition of office equipment, \nincluding  vehicles,  computers,  and  special  design  tools  and  software  for  design  and \nconstruction management, is included.   \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n36. \nUrban  Sector  Governance  and  Reforms.  The  brand-new  status  of  the  municipal \ncorporations  of  Jammu  and  Srinagar,  the  first  elections  were  held  in  2005,  provides  an \nopportunity  to  develop  the  new  municipal  corporations  properly  from  the  ground  up,  thereby \navoiding  some  of  the  poor  practices  inherent  in  long-established  corporations.  The  Program \ncombines physical infrastructure improvements with gradual reforms and capacity building. An \n8-10 year time frame is expected to be required before the municipal corporations can become \nautonomous.  This  long  term  approach  lends  itself  to  the  sector  loan  modality  and  the \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) as requested by the state and the Borrower. \n \n37.  MFF  (or  the  Facility):  The  Program  will  be  an  essential component  of  the  larger  road \nmap  for  the  urban  sector.  Under  the  Facility,  up  to  $300  million  in  loan  funds  will  be  made \navailable to J&K in tranches on a demand basis. Succeeding loans under the MFF will only be \nmade when proposed improvements have been properly appraised, designed and are ready for \nimplementation.  The  Facility  provides  flexibility  in  the  choice  of  the  eventual  components, \nenabling the state to mix and match funds from various sources with the demand, considering \nthe capacity of the responsible agencies to carry out O&M of the new facilities. Also, since the \nstate  is  new  to  major  projects,  the  8-year  MFF  approach  gives  the  state  time  to  develop  the \ncapacity of the responsible institutions as well as to plan and prepare succeeding subprojects. \nMoreover,  the  Facility  will  allow  the  design  and  implementation  of  different  tranches  and  the \nongoing loan to be appropriately staged so that overlapping of activities is minimized. The EA \ncan thus make the best possible use of its limited staff resources. The Facility also provides the \nflexibility of developing the towns as demand opportunity arises.  \n \nD. \n\nProgram Investment Plan \n\nThe cost of the Program is estimated at $485 million, including taxes and duties of $44.3 \n38. \nmillion. ADB will finance up to 62% of the total. Table 1 summarizes the cost by subsector. The \ndetails are in Appendix 3.  \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n \n\n \n\nE. \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\n39. \nTo  finance  the  Program,  the  Government  has  requested  finacing  of  up  to  $300  million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources through the Facility in accordance with ADB Policy9 The \nFacility will extend several loans to finance the projects under the investment program, subject \nto  the  submission  of  the  related  periodic  financing  request  (PFR)  by  the  Government  and  the \nexecution  of  the  related  loan  and  project  agreements.  The  Government  has  entered  into  a \nframework  financing  agreement  (FFA)  with  ADB,  which  satisfies  the  requirements  set  forth  in \nAppendix 4 of the ADB policy (please refer to footnote 8).   \n \n\nTable 1: Estimated Cost of the Investment Program \n \n\nCategory  \nI.

The  Government  can  choose \nbetween  the  eligible  currencies  and  interest-rate  regimes  for  each  loan.  The  specific  terms  of \neach loan will be based on the related PFR, with interest to be determined according to ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility.  The  Government  has  provided  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to \nborrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  it  made  the \nchoice independently of any communication or advice from ADB. The Government may request, \nand  ADB  may  agree  to  provide,  loans  under  the  Facility  through  the  submission  of  a  PFR, \nsubject to compliance with the related policy and procedures described in the FFA. Each PFR \nwill be submitted by the Government in the agreed format. The Government will inform ADB of a \nforthcoming PFR at least 15 days before its submission. A PFR may cover several subprojects \nand  related  consulting  service  packages.  ADB  will  review  the  PFRs  and,  if  it  finds  them \nsatisfactory, prepare the related loan and project agreements. The Government has submitted \nto ADB the first PFR for an amount of $42.2 million. Succeeding PFRs will be for at least $40 \nmillion. \n\n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2005. Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities.

The ERA, \n43. \nas mandated by the government of J&K, is responsible for all externally aided projects. Policy \ndirection  and  strategic  oversight  will  be  provided  by  a  governing  body  under  the  minister  for \nplanning.  The  chief  secretary  of  the  government  of  J&K,  the  principal  secretary  for  state \nplanning  and  development,  the  commissioner/secretary  of  finance  of  the  state,  three  sitting \nmembers  of  the  state  legislative  assembly,  and  the  chief  executive  officer  (CEO)  of  the  ERA  \nare the other members of the governing body. An executive committee established by the State \nshall be responsible to guide ERA on matters related to project activities. With the CEO of the \nERA  as  chair,  the  executive  committee  comprise  of  the  following  officials  as  members:  the \nprincipal secretary for tourism, the public works commissioner/secretary, the housing and urban \ndevelopment commissioner/secretary, the secretary to government for public health engineering \nand  irrigation,  the  secretary  to  government  for  planning  and  development.  The  executive \ncommittee will make decisions according to the authority delegated by the governing body and \nwill  provide  day-to-day  administrative  guidance  to  the  CEO  of  the  ERA.  Local  level  steering \ncommittees will be created in each city with representatives of the various line departments to \nfacilitate interaction between the ERA and the participating agencies, to select subprojects and \nreview  their  scope  and  design,  to  monitor  implementation  and  institutional  reforms  to \ndisseminate information, and to coordinate approvals and clearances among agencies. \n \n44. \nPMUs in each of Jammu and Srinagar have already been established under the ERA for \nthe  implementation  of  the  ongoing  project  and  the  Program  will  follow  the  same  procedures. \nEach PMU is headed by a full-time project director, reporting to the CEO. The project directors \nwill  be  supported  by  PMU  staff  comprising  water  supply,  sewerage,  solid  waste management, \nurban  transportation,  financial  and  economic  analyst,  procurement,  social  development, \nenvironmental,  and  procurement  specialists  and  project  advisory  consultants.  A  senior  officer \nreporting  directly  to  the  CEO  will  be  responsible  for  institutional  development  and  capacity-\nbuilding activities. Another senior officer also reporting directly to the CEO will be appointed to \nensure  compliance  with  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies.  Each  PMU  will  have  a \ndedicated  financial  and  accounts  officer  to  look  after  the  project  accounts  and  processing  of \nclaims.  The  PMUs  will  be  responsible  for  identifying,  formulating,  appraising,  designing,  and \nimplementing  all  subprojects, \nincluding  compliance  with  state  and  national  statutory \nenvironmental regulations and ADB\u2019s social and environmental safeguard policies. Community \nconsultation will be an integral part of the operating procedure of the project. A total complement \nof 60 professional staff is estimated to be required in the two PMUs for the implementation of \nProject 1. The implementation and  tranche schedules are in Appendix 4, while the organization \nchart is in Appendix 5.   \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria   \n\n \n45. \nOnly the 4 subprojects in Project 1 have been appraised. The other 20 or so subprojects \nenvisaged  in  the  Program  are  indicative  in  nature.  These  will  be  finalized  as  the  needs  and \npriorities  identified  in  the  updated  master  plans  for  water  supply,  sewerage,  drainage,  solid \nwaste  management,  urban  transportation,  and  tourism  become  available.  The  eligibility \nrequirements for subprojects as detailed in Appendix 5 are summarized below: \n \n\n(i) \n\nwater supply, sewerage and drainage, urban transportation, and municipal solid \nwaste management subprojects in the master plan for the respective subsectors; \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\ndesigns and specifications incorporating earthquake strengthening for zone 4 or \n5, as applicable, and ready for tender;   \n\nthe subprojects will be economically feasible and financially sustainable; \n\nthe  subprojects  will  conform  to  all  national  and  state  environmental  regulations \nand be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002); \n\nthe  subprojects  will  include  measures  to  mitigate  any  possible  social  impacts, \nincluding resettlement impact and impact on indigenous peoples, following ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998);  \n\nall necessary national and state approvals and clearances are in place; and \n\nERA  and  the  asset-owning  agency  have  agreed  on  a  concept  plan  for  the \noperation and maintenance of the assets to be created under the subprojects. \n\nApproval Procedure for Projects and Subprojects \n\n \n3. \n \nFour  subprojects  have  been  selected  and  appraised  under  ADB\u2019s  PPTA  for  Project  1. \n\n46. \nOther subprojects under the investment program will be prepared and processed as follows: \n \n\nERA  will  prepare  preliminary  designs  and  cost  estimates  for  all  subprojects \nproposed  under  the  respective  tranches.  ERA  will  prepare  initial  poverty  and \nsocial assessments and checklists for (a) involuntary resettlement, (b) indigenous \npeoples,  and  (c)  rapid  environmental  assessment,  following  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy, Policy on Indigenous Peoples, and Environment Policy, and \nsubmit to ADB for review and social and environmental categorization; \n\nOn the basis of the categorization, the ERA will prepare appraisal reports for all \nsubprojects,  including  an  appropriate  resettlement  plan  and  an  indigenous \npeoples  development  plan  or  integration  of  specific  actions  in  favor  of  the \nindigenous people in the resettlement plans following the respective frameworks, \nif required, and initial environmental examination (IEE) reports or environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  reports  as  applicable,  following  the  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  developed  for  the  investment \nprogram, and submit these reports, along with the PFR, to ADB for approval, with \nthe  endorsement  of  the  Government.  However,  for  subprojects  categorized  as \nenvironment category B\u2013sensitive or category A, ADB\u2019s 120-day requirement for \npublic disclosure will apply before the submission of the PFR; and, \n\n(iii) \n\nThe ERA and ADB will consult on PFRs before their submission to ADB. \n\n47. \nThe PFRs should (i) state the required loan amount; (ii) list the subprojects and related \nconsultancy  support  to  be  financed  under  the  tranche;  (iii)  be  accompanied  by  the  appraisal \nreports  for  the  listed  subprojects,  including  the  environmental  assessment  report 10  and \nappropriate resettlement plan and indigenous peoples plan, if any; (iv) give cost estimates and \ndetail  the  financing  plan;  (v)  spell  out  the  implementation  arrangements;  (vi)  confirm  the \ncontinuing validity and adherence to the provisions of the FFA; (vii) confirm compliance with the \nprovisions  under  previous  loan  agreements  and  the  project  agreement  as  appropriate;  and \n(viii) provide  other  information  required  under  the  facility  administration  memorandum  to  be \nprepared  and  agreed  upon  between  ADB,  the  Government  and  the  government  of  J&K    to \nfacilitate the implementation and processing of the Facility. \n \n                                                 \n10 For subprojects categorized as environment category B\u2013sensitive or category A\u2013sensitive, ADB\u2019s 120-day rule for \n\nthe submission of the PFR will apply. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n48. \nThe  MFF  will  be  implemented  over  8  years  as  shown  in  Appendix  4  as  an  essential \ncomponent of the larger road map for the sector, through 4 tranches.11 The 4 subprojects in the \nfirst loan were selected because they are ready for implementation and are representative of the \ncomponents  of  the  Program.  The  institutional  and  capacity-building  activities  in  the  ongoing \nproject,  including  the  ADB  funded  specialist  consultants  will  continue.  The  subprojects  in  the \nsecond  and  third  tranches  will  be  based  on  the  updated  master  plans  for  water  supply, \nsewerage, drainage, and SWM improvements and as land is acquired for new subprojects. The \nfourth  and  other  subsequent  tranches  (if  required)  will  focus  on  other  municipal  infrastructure, \nincluding  components  that  will  facilitate  investment  in  important  service  sectors  and  industries \nbased  on  the  economic  development  plans  and  capacity  are  developed  in  the  regional  towns \nand commercial centers. \n \n\n5. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nProcurement  financed  from  the  ADB  loans  under  the  Facility  will  be  carried  out \n49. \naccording to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from time to time). International \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) will be followed for civil works contracts costing $10 million or more. \nCivil works contracts costing less than $10 million will be procured through national competitive \nbidding  (NCB).12 Single-stage,  two-envelope  bidding  with  post-qualification  will  be  adopted  for \nall ICB and NCB civil works contracts under the investment program. Works related to low-cost \nsanitation,  public  toilets,  and  restoration  of  structures  with  historical  and  tourism  importance, \nand  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $100,000,  will  be  evaluated  individually  for  the  feasibility  of \ndirect contracting. Force-account procedures will be followed for specialized facilities (electricity \nconnections, railway and national highway crossings) by state and Government agencies.  \n \n50.  Water supply, sewerage, and drainage contracts may involve civil works combined with \nthe supply and installation of equipment or goods and will be considered as civil works contracts \nregardless of the proportion of costs associated with the equipment or goods. ADB\u2019s standard \ndocuments  for  procurement  of  plant  will  be  used  for  such  contracts.  In  procuring  goods  and \nrelated services, ICB procedures will be used if the estimated cost is at least $1 million and NCB \nprocedures  if  the  cost  is  less  than  $1  million.  For  contracts  involving  specialized  equipment, \nsuch as proprietary software and small materials, valued at less than $100,000, ADB\u2019s shopping \nprocedures may be followed. \n \nNCB  for  civil  works  will  use  the  standard  documents  for  local  (national)  competitive \n51. \nbidding  (civil  works)  and  supply  contracts  will  use  the  documents  for  international  shopping \n(goods) already used in the ongoing project, as amended and approved by ERA and ADB. For \nsmall community works not exceeding $100,000 in value the option of community participation \nin  procurement  will  be  considered  as  per  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  The  contract \npackaging  in  the  procurement  plan  was  prepared  on  the  basis  of  experience  gained  in  the \nongoing  project,  which  resulted  in  good  competition.  An  indicative  procurement  plan  for  the \nProgram and a detailed procurement plan for Project 1 are in Appendix 6.  \n \n\n6. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n53. \nConsultants will be hired for project management, design and construction supervision, \ninstitutional development, and capacity building. In addition, independent agencies, institutions \n                                                 \n11 Depending on actual progress, up to 6 tranches may be required. \n12  The  state\u2019s  standard  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  and  being  followed  under  the  ongoing \n\nLoan 2151-IND will be used in NCB for civil works and supply contracts. \n\n \n\n\for  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  will  be  hired  to  carry  out  public  awareness  and \ncommunity participation programs and to facilitate and monitor resettlement. All consultants and \nNGOs  will  be  hired  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2006,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultancy  services  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n \n\n7. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\nADB  Management  has  approved  advance  contracting  for  consultant  recruitment  and \n54. \nprocurement of goods and civil works, and retroactive financing for the Project 1 under the MFF. \nFor  subsequent  loans, ADB  may  agree  to  the  request  for  advance  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing  of  civil  works  and  equipment  and  materials,  and  recruitment  of  consulting  services, \nsubject  to  these  being  requested  under  the  following  PFRs  and  subject  to  being  eligible  in \naccordance  with  the  agreed  procedures  and  guidelines  on  a  project  by  project  basis.  These \narrangements will facilitate the readiness of projects under the Program and will be considered \nfor  subsequent  projects  during  the  processing  of  individual  PFRs.  Total  eligible  expenditure \nunder retroactive financing will not exceed an amount equivalent to 20% of the individual loan, \nand must have been incurred not more than 12 months before the signing of the related legal \nagreements.  However,  approval  of  advance  action  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit \nADB to finance the projects being developed under the Program. \n \n\n8. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption Efforts \n\n55. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended from time to time) was explained to and \ndiscussed  with  the  ERA.  ADB  has  assessed  the  financial  management  policies  of  the  ERA \n(Supplementary  Appendix  B)  and  agreed  on  measures  to  improve  governance,  accountability, \nand transparency with ERA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, \nand  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any \nalleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To support \nthese  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  will  be  included  in  all  bidding \ndocuments.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Program  shall \nspecify  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Program.  \n \n56. \nIn  parallel  with  the  physical  investment,  the  investment  program  is  also  designed  to \nsupport a number of initiatives to strengthen urban governance in the project cities. These will \ninclude (i) land use planning and formulation of an environmental policy framework; (ii) human \nresource  development;  (iii)  capacity  enhancement  of  Jammu  and  Srinagar  municipal \ncorporations; and (iv) creation of a separate semiautonomous, self-sufficient, and commercially \nrun  entity  for  water  and  wastewater  services  in  each  of  the  two  main  cities,  equipped  with \nmodern operation and financial management tools and skills.  \n \n57. \nmitigation measures, which are identified in Table 4. \n\nThe  ERA  will  ensure  compliance  with  the  specific  anticorruption  and  governance  risk \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nGood Governance \nArea \nInstitutional \nDevelopment \n \n\nTransparency and \nDissemination of \nInformation \n \n\nProcurement \n \n\nAudit and Quality \nControl \n \n\n15\n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4: Anticorruption and Good Governance Measures  \n \n\nMeasures \n\u2022  deciding  on  any  future  investment  in  water,  wastewater,  and \nSWM  sector  on  the  basis  of  the  priorities  in  the  respective \nmaster plans \nregulating  building  activities  through  an  updated  land  use \npolicy and building regulations \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  establishing  a  separate  semiautonomous,  self-sufficient,  and \nfor  water  and  wastewater \n\ncommercially  operated  entity \nservices in each of the two main cities \n\n\u2022  establishing an independent commission to set tariff structures \n\nfor water, sewage, and SWM \n\n\u2022  enhancing  the  capacity  of  Jammu  and  Srinagar  municipal \n\ncorporations by: \n\n1.  computerizing their records and billing systems \n2.  converting  their  single-entry  accounting  systems  to \n\ndouble-entry systems \n3.  imposing property tax  \n4.  expanding the tax network \n5.  improving collection efficiency \n6.  developing human resources \n\n\u2022  promoting  private  sector  participation  and  public-private \n\n\u2022 \n\npartnership where feasible \nregularly disclosing to the public physical and financial details \nand progress of the project  \n\n\u2022  awarding contracts and paying contractors on time \n\u2022  undertaking extensive stakeholder consultation before \n\nimposing any new tax or revising any tariff rates \nforming a public grievance redress cell within the ERA  \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022  separating social and environmental compliance and \n\nmonitoring  from regular project implementation activities \n\n\u2022  complying with ADB\u2019s guidelines on procurement and \n\nconsultancy services \n\n\u2022  using ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents and standard \n\nrequest-for-proposal documents \n\n\u2022  ensuring nonrestrictive bid specifications \n\u2022  ensuring maximum competition in bidding \n\u2022  advertising all tenders adequately \n\u2022  disclosing the results of tenders to the public \n\u2022  notifying the public about contract awards, costs, and \n\n\u2022  having financial statements audited by external auditors \n\nimplementation details \n\nacceptable to ADB  \n\n\u2022  stipulating, in all contracts financed by ADB for the project, \n\nADB\u2019s right to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe contractor \n\n\u2022  preparing a quality control manual for the project \n\u2022  preparing all technical specifications according to international \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nGood Governance \nArea \n\nbest practices and Indian standards  \n\nMeasures \n\n\u2022  adhering strictly to the bid specifications in implementing all \n\n\u2022  adopting third-party inspection for quality control in all supply \n\ncivil works  \n\nand works contracts \n\nERA= Economic Reconstruction Agency, SWM= solid waste management. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n9. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nLoan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n58. \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  facilitate  the  implementation  of  the  Program,  the \nBorrower  will  establish  an  imprest  account  for  each  loan  with  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India.  The \nERA may establish a second-generation imprest account (SGIA) for each loan with in a current \naccount in a commercial bank acceptable to both ADB and the Borrower. The imprest accounts \nwill be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated according to the handbook. The funds \nfrom  the  imprest  account  will  be  transferred  to  the  SGIA.  The  Government  has  assured  ADB \nthat all transfers from the imprest account to the SGIA will be made within 30 calendar days of \nthe receipt of the advance or replenishment.  \n \n59. \nThe initial and all subsequent amounts to be deposited into the imprest account and into \nthe  SGIA  will  be  determined  by  ADB  in  consultation  with  the  Government  and  the  ERA,  with \nparticular  reference  to  the  pipeline  of  awarded  contracts.  The  drawdown  will  not  exceed  the \nequivalent of 3 months of projected expenditures or 10% of the total loan amount, whichever is \nless,  and  will  be  based on  disbursements  expected  under  contracts  within  the  next  3  months. \nThe ERA will maintain each SGIA advance or replenishment in the separate commercial bank \naccount established for the SGIA, and draw from it only the portion of expenditures eligible for \nADB financing. Counterpart funds will be required for each such expenditure. ADB will provide \nguidance  in  the  establishment  of  accounts  for  the  Program  during  the  loan  inception  mission. \nThe statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure will be used in reimbursing and liquidating the \nSGIA  for  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $50,000  per  payment,  except  as  ADB  may \notherwise agree during the implementation of the Program. \n \n\n10. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n60. \nThe  ERA,  through  the  PMUs,  will  establish  and  maintain  separate  records  for  works, \ngoods,  and  services  financed  out  of  loan  proceeds.  Also  through  the  PMUs,  the  ERA  will \nmaintain separate project accounts according to generally accepted accounting principles for all \nexpenditures  incurred  under  the  Facility  and  the  subprojects,  whether  out  of  loan  proceeds  or \nfrom  other  sources.    The  ERA  will  record  in  a  transparent manner  all  funds  received  from  the \nState, ADB, and other sources. \n  \nDetailed  consolidated  annual  project  accounts,  as  maintained  by  the  ERA  through  the \n61. \nPMU,  will  be  audited  by  independent  auditors  whose  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of \nreference are acceptable to ADB, and will be submitted to ADB within 9 months of the end of \nthe fiscal year. The annual audit report will include the audit of the imprest account, the SGIA, \nand the SOE procedure, and will specifically include a separate audit opinion on the use of loan \nproceeds, the operation of the SGIA, and compliance with SOE procedures and loan covenants. \nThe ERA has been made aware of ADB\u2019s policy regarding the delayed submission of audits and \nthe requirements for a satisfactory and acceptable audit of accounts. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n \n\n \n\n11. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nindicators  relating \n\n62. \nThe  ERA  will  be  responsible  for  establishing  an  investment  program  performance \nmonitoring system (IPPMS) acceptable to ADB within 3 months of the date the first loan under \nthe  Facility  takes  effect.  For  the  IPPMS,  the  ERA  will  first  select  a  set  of  clearly  measurable \nperformance  monitoring \nimprovements,  and \ninstitutional  development  and  capacity-building  milestones  including  those  in  the  design  and \nmonitoring  framework  (Appendix  1).  The  ERA  will  establish  baseline  data  for  each  of  the \nselected indicators within 6 months of the date the first loan under the MFF takes effect. After \nthat,  the  ERA  will  conduct  annual  surveys  and  will  update  ADB  on  the  progress  against  each \nindicator. The EA will also submit quarterly progress reports in the format to be attached to the \nfacility  administration  memorandum.  The  ERA  will  submit  to  ADB  an  individual  project \ncompletion report and a facility completion report within 3 months of the completion of all ADB-\nsupported activities and subprojects.  \n \n\nimplementation  and \n\nto \n\n12. \n\nInvestment Program Review \n\n63. \nThe Program\u2019s performance will be reviewed monthly at three levels by the ERA through \nthe  PMUs,  and  quarterly  by  the  governing  council  of  the  ERA  and  by  ADB.  The  review  of \nperformance for each month by the PMUs and the local steering committees will be completed \nby the 10th day of the next month. The ERA will review the performance every quarter and will \nforward  the  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB  by  the  10th  day  of  the  month  after  the  quarter \nreviewed.  ADB  will  review  the  quarterly  progress  reports  during  the  review  missions  to  be \ncarried  out  at  least  twice  a  year,  and  during  the  tripartite  reviews  chaired  by  the  Government. \nADB  will  also  carry  out  annual  environmental  reviews  of  the  Program.  In  addition,  a  midterm \nreview of the investment program will be conducted in June 2012. The review will cover contract \nawards  and  disbursement,  implementation  progress  including  progress  against  institutional \ndevelopment  and  capacity-building  milestones,  social  and  environmental  aspects,  and  the \nin \nstatus  of \nimplementation  arrangements,  nominal  changes  in  scope,  outputs,  and  due  diligence,  and \ngenerate agreement on any changes that may be needed. \n \n\nIPPMS.  The  midterm  review  will \n\nidentify  problems  or  weaknesses \n\nthe \n\n13. \n\nProject Readiness  \n\n64. \nRecognizing that start-up delays have been a major cause of concern for urban sector \nprojects with new agencies, ADB approved an advisory technical assistance (ADTA) to support \nthe  ERA  in  implementing  the  first  tranche  of  the  Program  and  to  help  ERA  meet  ADB\u2019s \nrequirement  for  appraisal  and  preparation  of  the  next  tranche.  The  specific  outputs  of  the  TA \nare; a project management system, implementation support to the ERA, capacity building and \ntraining,  improved  urban  planning,  engineering  designs  and  contract  packaging,  an  operation \nand maintenance plan for Jammu and Srinagar, and improved public awareness. The TA has a \nbudget of $500,000, including $400,000 from ADB. The TA is not attached to the Program.   \n \nERA  has  also  requested  support  from  the  newly  approved  umbrella  TA  cluster 13 \n65. \ndeveloped  to  improve  project  preparedness  for new  projects  in  India.  The  TA  cluster  provides \nsupport in planning, appraisal, and preparation of tender documents to ensure that a substantial \nportion of the works are ready for tender and award when the loan takes effect. A component \nTA  has  been  provided  to  help  ERA  with  project  management,  master  plans  for  water  and \nsewerage  works,  appraisal  of  the  already  identified  8-10  subprojects  for  the  second  project \n\n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2006.

In addition to the \nphysical  investments,  the  policy  and  organizational  changes,  capacity-building  and  other \ninstitutional changes, were analyzed to develop a plan for adequate revenues to meet the O&M \ncosts in the mid term and operating cost in the longer term. These policies are as important as \nthe  physical  investments.14 Thus  the economic  analysis  confirmed;  (i) rationale  for  government \ninvolvement,  (ii) goals  of  the  plan,  (iii)  sector  development  plan,  (iv) associated  economic \npolicies,  (v) government  capacity,  (vi)  fiscal  impacts,  (vii) economic  risks,  (viii)  government \ncommitment, (ix) coordination of foreign aid, and (x) conditions attached to the loan. Details of \nthis analysis are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n67. \nThe  economic  rationale  for  the  Government\u2019s  intervention  is  sound,  as  the  Program \nsupports  local  government  functions.  These  primarily  deal  with  basic  public  services \ncharacterized  by  monopolistic  conditions,  management  of  externalities,  and  protection  of  the \npublic good. Subprojects are selected with the help of cost-benefit analysis/least-cost approach \nwhile  still  meeting  technical  and  safeguard  requirements.  A  comparison  between  the  baseline \nscenario and the alternative scenario over the period from 2007\u20132008 to 2015\u20132016 shows that \nthe total fiscal burden in terms of the higher fiscal deficit that is attributed to ADB\u2019s project varies \nbetween  0.1%  in  2007\u20132008  and  0.6%  in  2011\u20132012  (Supplementary  Appendix  B).  Despite \nassistance from the center, the state\u2019s fiscal position remains weak. \n \n68.  With  limited  tax  instruments,  an  inadequate  tax  base,  and  unutilized  non-tax  sources \nmunicipal  corporations  are  highly  dependent  on  fiscal  transfers  from  the  state.  Funds  are \nprimarily transferred through the devolution of the net tax revenue of the state and grants. The \ndevolution  of  the  state\u2019s  net  tax  revenue  to  local  bodies  is  a  constitutional  requirement  (74th \nconstitutional  amendment),  and  its  magnitude  depends  on  the  recommendation  of  the  State \nFinance Commission. As recommended by the first State Finance Commission, the government \nof J&K shares 10% of net tax revenue with local governments through block grants for general \nor  specified  purposes.  Given  the  fragile  financial  status  of  municipal  corporations,  revenue-\ngenerating subprojects can only achieve financial viability over the medium term. Water charges \nare low and often uncollected and a property tax system does not exist, so resistance to sharp \nhikes in user charges and introduction of property taxes is expected, and the delivery of public \nutilities and services will continue to depend on government subsidies. \n \n69. \nThe financial analysis of sample subprojects incorporates this reality, and that J&K will \nreceive  ADB\u2019s  loan  funds  as  90%  grant.  However,  the  existing  system  needs  to  be  reformed \nand the revenue-generating subprojects need to be financially viable against a benchmark cost \nof  capital.  There  is  no comparative  rate-tenor  combination  to  ADB;  the closest  market  rate  for \nmedium-term funds (10\u201315 years) is around 9%. The current rate of inflation is in the region of \n5%,  implying  a  benchmark  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  of  4%  for  each  subproject.  \nAlternative  non-volume-based  user  charges  and  taxes  have  been  worked  out  for  the  sample \nsubprojects on this assumption (Supplementary Appendix A). For example, at least a sevenfold \n                                                 \n14 David  Dole.  2005.  Assessing  Aid  for  a  Sector  Development  Plan:  Economic  Analysis  of  a  Sector  Loan.  ERD \n\nTechnical Note, No. 14. Manila: ADB.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n \n\n \n\nincrease  in  the  current  domestic  water  supply  charges  will  be  needed  to  achieve  the  target \nFIRR. However, setting user charges or taxes at such high levels is not feasible at this juncture. \nThe  strategy  is  to  improve  the  recovery  of  O&M  cost  gradually  by  improving  the  coverage  of \nhouseholds, changing illegal users to bill-paying customers, gradual increase of user charges, \nbilling and collecting from all consumers, reducing physical and administrative losses and make \nthe physical system more efficient, to enable recovery of O&M cost by the end of the Program.  \n \n70. \nA set of feasible user charges and taxes has been proposed to cover 50% of the O&M \ncosts  of  a  sample  subproject  by  2010-11.  Key  actions  required  to  meet  these  levels  of  cost \nrecovery will include public awareness programs, detailed enumeration of consumers, creation \nof a property registry, computerization, establishment of a regulatory commission, and capacity \nbuilding of the municipal corporations. However, even with the levy of user charges as proposed \nand other arrangements to improve management of services and reduce losses, subprojects will \ncontinue  to  depend  on  government  subsidies  for  O&M  until  cost  recovery  can  be  achieved \ntowards the end of the Program. \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Impact \n\n \n71. \nAccording  to  statistics  from  the  Government  and  the  state,  the  percentage  of  the \npopulation  living  below  the  poverty  line  (BPL)  in  J&K  is  one  of  the  lowest15 in  the  country. \nHowever, in terms of access to basic social services, J&K lags behind most of the other states \nas  a  result  of  limited  investment  and  O&M  funding.  According  to  the  2001  census  of  India, \nalmost 30% of the population of Jammu and Srinagar lives in slums with poor levels of services, \nparticularly  sanitation.  Piped  water  is  available  to  only  about  8%  of  the  populations  of  Jammu \nand Srinagar. However, the levels of services provided are poor, with only 1\u20132 hours per day in \nmany  areas,  at  low  pressure.  About  40%  of  the  solid  waste  in  Jammu  and  30%  in  Srinagar \nremains uncollected and is disposed of indiscriminately into local drains, streams, and rivers.  \n \nAn initial poverty reduction and social assessment undertaken during the preparation of \n72. \nthe  investment  program  in  the  two  cities  indicated  a  considerable  range  between  high-  and \nlow-income  groups.  Of  the  2,339  households  interviewed,  5%  comprised  households  living \nbelow  the  poverty  line  (BPL),  earning  less  than  Rs420  a  month.  The  cities  of  Jammu  and \nSrinagar both reflect a near-equal incidence of BPL households. The Program is not intended \nas  a  poverty  reduction  intervention,  but  it  will  contribute  considerably  to  enhancing  the  overall \nsocioeconomic status of the BPL households in the participating cities and towns by improving \nand  expanding  the  coverage  of  urban  services,  as  well  as  indirect  benefits  through  improved \npublic  health,  living  conditions,  quality  of  life,  and  economic  opportunities.  A  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 7. \n \n\na. \n\nGender \n\n \n73. \nJ&K  ranks  25th  on  the  Gender  Disparity  Index  (GDI)  with  a  value  of  0.740  when \ncompared  with  the  national  average.16 There  are  900  females  for  every  1,000  males  (2001 \ncensus).  The  state  has  a  literacy  rate  of  54.46%\u201465.75%  for  males  and  41.82%  for  females \n(2001  census).  Women,  particularly  among  the  poor,  and  children  end  up  with  the  main \nresponsibility  in  the  household  for  fetching,  storing,  and  using  water  for  washing  and  cooking. \nThey  spend  at  least  1  hour  per  day  collecting  water  and  sometimes  twice  as  long.  A \nfundamental  direct  beneficiary  of  the  water  supply  component  will  be  the  BPL  portion  of  this \ngender group. The provision of sanitation and drainage facilities will also improve public health \n                                                 \n15 Government of India, Planning Commission, 2001.

In November \n2002,  there  were  about  24,000  cases  of  HIV  infection  in  J&K  (0.2%  of  the  state\u2019s  population, \naccording to the J&K AIDS Control Society), meaning it is a low-prevalence state with regard to \nthe disease. HIV is commonly found among migrant laborers, truck drivers, and security forces. \nGiven the current level of transmission of the disease in J&K, the AIDS Control Society in the \nstate has made it a priority to increase public awareness of HIV. \n \n\nc. \n\nIndigenous People \n\n \n75. \nJ&K is home to 11 major tribes as well as a number of smaller indigenous groups and \nconstitute  a  significant  proportion  of  the  population  in  the  Rajouri,  Udhampur,  Poonch,  Uri, \nGanderbal,  Anantnag,  Daksum,  and  Kandi  areas  of  Jammu.  However,  since  the  project  is \nmainly  urban,  only  a  very  limited  number  of  indigenous  peoples  were  noted  during  the  initial \npoverty  and  social  assessments.  The  indigenous  peoples  households  covered  during  the \nsurveys in the project areas were largely assimilated with the local population.  \n \n76. \nThe  investment  program  will  not  hinder  or  adversely  affect  any  segment  of  the \npopulation of ethnic origin. On the other hand, it will benefit equally all persons in the investment \nprogram  area.  All  subprojects  under  the  Program,  particularly  those  in  the  towns  where  there \nmay  be  some  impact  in  subsequent  tranches,  will  be  supported  by  the  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment  plan  prepared  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  People  (1998)  and  the \nagreed indigenous people\u2019s development framework (Supplementary Appendix C).  \n \n\nd. \n\nLand Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement \n\n \n77. \nThe Program incorporates minimization of land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. \nOf  the  4  subprojects  appraised,  two  subprojects 17  entail  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement. RPs have been prepared for these subprojects (Supplementary Appendixes C and \nD) on the basis of an agreed entitlement framework in Appendix 8. Any RPs required for future \nsubprojects will be prepared according to ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy based on this   \nframework. The ERA will ensure that, for subprojects involving resettlement or land acquisition, \nconstruction activities and relocation of affected people (APs) begin only after all APs have been \ncompensated  according  to  the  agreed  RPs.  If  any  changes  made  in  the  subproject  design \nduring implementation affect other persons or alter the impact on previously identified APs, the \nRP  will  be  updated  and  implemented  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB.  All  RPs  under  the \nProgram will be translated into the local language and distributed among the affected people by \nthe ERA. The RPs will also be posted on the ADB and ERA websites. \n \nTo  ensure  the  speedy  acquisition  of  land  under  the  Program,  a  high-powered \n78. \ncommittee18 will be formed at the state or ERA level for the independent valuation of land based \non its current market replacement value. The committee will also establish, on the basis of the \nprevailing rates, the transitional allowance and assistance to be provided to APs to restore their \n\n                                                 \n17  Municipal  solid  waste  collection  and  disposal  site  development  in  Srinagar,  and  Bannihal  Cart  Road  from \n\nShakuntala Crossing to the Children\u2019s Hospital, including the pedestrian subway, in Jammu. \n\n18  A similar committee has been constituted (see Government Order No. Rev (LAK) 92 of 2003, dated 24 April 2003) \n\nfor the acquisition of land for the Qazigund\u2013Baramulla Railway line through private negotiations.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\n \n\n \n\nlivelihoods  to  pre-project  levels.  In  addition,  the  committee  will  directly  negotiate19 settlements \nand  compensation  with  the  affected  persons,  wherever  required.  All  negotiations  will  be \nvoluntary and without coercion. The representatives of APs must participate in all negotiations \nto  ensure  transparency.  Minutes  of  all  negotiations,  covering  the  key  points  of  discussion  and \noutcomes,  will  be  maintained  by  the  committee.  The  independent  monitoring  agency  hired  by \nthe  PMU  with  ADB\u2019s  approval  will  monitor  these  negotiations  and  their  minutes.  The  APs  will \nrefer the resolution of any grievance and disputes concerning the negotiations to the grievance \nredress committee created at the subproject level in accordance with the RP. \n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\n \n79. \nFollowing  the  IEEs  of  the  4  subprojects  and  ADB\u2019s  review,  Project  1  was  classified  as \nenvironment  category  B\u2013sensitive,  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  The  most \nurgently required improvements and their readiness to proceed were considered in the selection \nof the 4 subprojects in Project 1. Based on their IEEs, 3 subprojects are category B, by virtue of \ntheir  actual  physical  impact,  but  the  solid  waste  disposal  site  in  Srinagar  is  classified  as  B-\nsensitive.  \n \n80. \nThe subprojects in Project 1 will not have any significant adverse environmental impacts.  \nThe  ERA  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  PMUs  implement  the  environmental \nmanagement plans (EMP) developed as part of the IEEs are incorporated as line items in the \nrelated tender and contract documents. \n \n81. \nSome  subprojects  in  subsequent  tranches  may  be  encroaching  on  wildlife  sanctuaries \nand  other  environmentally  sensitive  areas  and  may  accordingly  be  classified  as  environment \ncategory A. Such subprojects may be developed after the master plans for the respective towns \nare completed and maps for wild life sanctuaries and forest areas are updated and available. In \naddition,  any  works  that  encroach  on  the  sanctuaries  will  require  that  ERA  obtain  all  the \nnecessary  statutory  clearances.  Subprojects  that  fall  under  environment  category  A  will  be \neligible  for  financing  under  the  MFF  subject  to  ADB\u2019s  prior  approval  and  classification.  The \nsummary  EIA  (SEIA)  or  summary  IEE  (SIEE)  for  A  and  B-sensitive  subprojects  must  be \ndisclosed  to  the  public  120  days  prior  to  submission  to  ADB  for  approval.  No  subproject  will \nencroach on any national park or its buffer zone. If any changes occur in specific locations or \nalignments  of  infrastructure  or  project  facilities  after  the  IEE  or  EIA,  or  any  new  information \nbecomes  available  that  have  additional  environmental  impacts,  then  the  IEE  or  EIA  will  be \nupdated by ERA and approved by ADB before contracts are awarded. The ERA will submit to \nADB  twice-yearly  progress  reports  on  the  implementation  of  the  EMPs  and  the  environmental \nmonitoring  carried  out  as  a  regular  part  of  project  implementation.  All  documents  on \nenvironmental  issues,  including  EIAs,  SEIAs,  IEEs,  SIEEs,  and  progress  reports,  will  be \nproperly  recorded  and  maintained  as  part  of  the  Program  and  made  available  to  the  public, \naccording to ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005). Future subprojects will conform to the \nenvironmental assessment and review framework (EARF) in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n \n \n82. \nPolicy Risks. The state\u2019s economy is reviving after 2 decades stagnation. The municipal \ncorporations  in  Srinagar  and  Jammu  have  only  recently  been  formed\u2014the  first  municipal \nelections were held in June 2005\u2014and at this stage of their development are reluctant, and do \nnot  yet  have  the  human  resources,  to  accept  the  responsibilities  envisaged  in  the  state\u2019s \ndevolution  plan  and  the  related  reform  agenda.  The  city  residents  are  used  to  almost  free \n                                                 \n19  According to the procedure described in Government Order (Sadar E. Riyasat) 419 (SRO-419), C: Acquisition by \n\nRisks  \n\n4. \n\nPrivate Negotiation, clause 19\u201320.   \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nservices,  albeit  at  poor  levels.  The  newly  elected  councils  may  therefore  be  reluctant  to \nimplement  consumption-based  water  charges  and  introduce  property  taxes.  Water  users  may \nresist  the  charges  and  also  hesitate  to  connect  to  the  new  sewerage  network  because  of  the \nhigher  water  fees  that would  entail.  These  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  extensive  awareness  and \ncapacity-building programs, and the provision of better services which with an extensive public \nawareness  programs  should  ease  concerns.  The  implementation  schedule  takes  into  account \nthe  need  to  first  improve  the  available  services  before  increasing  user  charges.  The  8-year \nProgram will allow enough time to achieve the reforms.  \n \n83. \nLocation  Risks.  The  ongoing  project  has  experienced  some  problems  due  to  the \nrelative  remote  location  of  the  project  area.  Many  contractors  from  outside  the  state  are \nparticipating in tenders. Most people in the area and the Srinagar valley welcome the project as \na much-needed improvement of basic facilities and promoting economic development, and they \nseem to appreciate the value of ADB\u2019s requirement for transparency, open procurement, quality \ncontrol,  capacity  building,  reporting,  and  audits.  Nevertheless, \nthe  proposed  Program \nrecognizes  that  there  may  be  special  needs  in  the  State  to  counter  any  incidents  and \nto  provide  good \ndisruptions.  The  ERA  will  advise  all  consultants  and  contractors \ncommunications,  secure  living  and  working  conditions  and  location  allowances  to  attract  and \nkeep  experienced  personnel.  The  ERA  will  follow  the  quality-based  procedure  for  recruiting \nproject  consultants  to  better  incorporate  such  considerations  in  the  contracts  to  avoid  the \nproblems  experienced  on  the  ongoing  project.  Similarly,  the  ERA  will  consult  all  stakeholders \nwhen planning and appraising new subprojects, issue regular progress reports in local-language \nnewspapers, and hire independent monitors as required to facilitate consultations, disseminate \nproject activities and benefits. The ADB-funded TA consultants will continue to support the ERA.  \n \n84. \nDesign  and  Implementation  Risks.  Experience  on  the  ongoing  project  indicates  that \ncompetent consultants may be better recruited individually rather than through firms and this is \nincorporated in the procedures. Firms may be hired through quality and costs or quality based \nprocedures.  To  reduce  costs  and  improve  efficiency  the  ERA  may  allow  routine  design  and \ndrawings to be prepared in the consultants\u2019 offices outside the state.  \n \nJ&K  is  in  an  earthquake-prone  region, 20  raising  the  risk  of  physical  damage  to \n85. \ninfrastructure  in  a  major  earthquake.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  requiring  all  engineering \ndesigns to meet Indian standards for earthquake-resistant buildings in earthquake zones 4 and \n5. The Program will also evaluate the viability of retrofitting public buildings such as schools and \nhospitals, to protect the life and property of the inhabitants and users of these buildings, as well \nas to demonstrate good practices in disaster preparedness to private sector builders.  \n \n86. \nSafeguards  Risks. Environmental and social risks will be mitigated through the use of \nappropriate filters as part of subproject selection and appraisal, as described above. There is a \nhigh degree of awareness of the need to protect the pristine areas and general environment of \nthe state, one of the reasons the State wanted ADB involved. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n87. \nIn addition to standard assurances, the Government of India and the government of J&K \nhave provided the following specific assurances. These will be incorporated in the FFA as well \nas  the  individual  loan  and  project  agreements  as  applicable,  subject  to  any  amendment  to  be \nmutually agreed on by the Government, the state of J&K, and ADB.  \n \n                                                 \n20 Seismic zone 4 and 5, according to code 1893 (2002) of the Bureau of Indian Standards, classifying regions on the \n\nbasis of their susceptibility to earthquake disasters.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\n \n\n \n\nTechnical. The master plans for water supply, sewerage and drainage, and solid waste \n88. \nmanagement will be finalized by January 2009. Structural designs will meet Indian standards for \nearthquake-resistant  buildings.  All  subprojects  under  the  Facility  will  be  selected  and \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  the  implementation  arrangements  and  subproject  selection \ncriteria (Appendix 5). \n \n89. \nGood Governance and Anticorruption. The Government will ensure that the Program \nfunds are utilized effectively and efficiently to implement the Program and achieve its objectives. \nThe  EA  will  ensure  compliance  with  the  specific  anticorruption  and  governance  risk  mitigation \nmeasures identified in Table 3 and also summarized in below. \n\n \n1. \n\nInstitutional and Sustainability  \n\n \n\n \n90. \nThe  state  will  commit  to  urban  sector  reforms  in  line  with  the  principles  outlined  under \nthe JNNURM and the urban institutional reform agenda described in Table 1 under paragraph 5, \nto  Schedule  3  of  the  FFA.  The  state  shall,  more  particularly,  undertake  the  following  specific \nactivities:  \n \n\n (a)  Within 1 year of the effective date of the first loan, the government of J&K shall  \n\n(i) \n\nestablish  a  suitable  institutional  mechanism  to  review  within  1  year  of  its \nestablishment  water  and  sewerage  costs  and  cost  recovery  options \nincluding  the  option  of  allocating  a  proportion  of  property  tax  collection \ntoward  water  supply  and  sewerage  operations  with  a  view  to  developing \nfinancial sustainability;    \n\n(ii) \n\ncommence  a  GIS-based  program  of  surveying  all  properties  and  water \nsupply connections of Srinagar and Jammu cities, and complete the same \nwithin 3 years of its commencement; \n\n(iii)  enhance the O&M budget allocation under the State budget to address the \n\nrequirement of O&M of assets created under the Program; and  \n\n(iv) \n\nissue  orders  requiring  all  property  owners  to  connect  to  the  sewerage \nsystem. \n\n (b)  Within 2 years from the effective date of the first loan, the state shall \n\n(i) \n\nestablish  semiautonomous  entities  or  boards  other  suitable  institutional \nmechanism  responsible \nfor  water  supply,  sewerage,  and  drainage \noperations  for  Srinagar  and  Jammu  cities;  these  entities  shall  operate  on \ncommercial principles and have their own independent budget, and perform \ntheir tasks in accordance with a business plan approved initially by the state \nand  the  corporations,  and  later,  when  the  corporations  have  gained \ncapacity, in accordance with budgets developed by the ULBs along with the \nservice levels and the water supply and sewerage charges that they will be \nauthorized to collect and retain;  \n\n(ii)  empower  the  municipal  corporations  of  Jammu  and  Srinagar  to  collect \nproperty tax at rates within a range as laid down by the state in consultation \nwith the corporations; and \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n(iii)  complete a review of the urban planning and land use control functions in \nthe  state  and  put  in  place  policies  that  clearly  demarcate  urban  land  use \nplanning  and  development  control  responsibilities  delineating  institutional \nresponsibilities  for  development  control  and  enforcement  of  penalties  in \ncase of violations. \n\n(d)  Within 3 years from the effective date of the first loan the state shall   \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii)  \n\nnotify  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Jammu  and  Srinagar  municipal  corporations \nto  cover  portions  of  the  2021  master  planning  area  of  the  cities  as  they \nare developed and added to the serviced area;  \n\nestablish  modern  accrual-based  accounting  systems  in  the  municipal \ncorporations of Jammu and Srinagar; and \n\nthrough  a  combination  of  increased  efficiency  of  billing  and  collection, \nincreased  user  charges,  reduced  water  losses,  and  allocation  of  a \nproportion  of  property  tax  collections  to  water  supply  and  sewerage \noperations,  recover,  through  the  service  providers  in  Srinagar  and \nJammu, increasing proportions of O&M costs as follows: (i) within 3 years \nfrom the effective date of the first loan, 30% of the O&M costs for water \nsupply will be recovered; (ii) within 3 years from the effective date of the \nsecond  loan,  50%  of  O&M  costs  for  water  supply  and  sewerage  will  be \nrecovered; and (iii) within 3 years from the effective date of the third loan, \n80% of O&M costs will be recovered. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples \n\n \nThe  government  of  J&K  and  ERA  will  undertake  the  projects  under  the  MFF  in \n91. \naccordance with Government\u2019s and state government\u2019s laws and regulations, including its policy \non  resettlement  and  rehabilitation,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995)  and  the \nresettlement  framework;  and  will  ensure  to  the  extent  possible  that  subprojects  under  the \nFacility  do  not  require  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement.  If  land  acquisition  or \ninvoluntary  resettlement  is  required  for  any  subproject,  including  a  sample  subproject,  the \nGovernment of India, the state, and ERA will ensure that: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe PMU prepares a resettlement plan for that subproject, acceptable to \nADB,  in  accordance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  state  , \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy,  and  the  resettlement  framework \n(Appendix  8),  and  submits  it  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  before  the \naward  of  any  civil  contract;  and  proper  consultation  with  the  APs  during \nthe preparation of resettlement plans, and disclosure of the resettlement \nplan  including  the  land  acquisition  and  compensation  process  to  the \naffected persons. \n\nAll  land,  rights-of-way,  and  other  land-related  rights  required  for  the \nsubproject are acquired or otherwise made available to the PMUs.  \n\nAll APs are compensated in accordance with the agreed land acquisition \nand  resettlement  plan  before  the  commencement  of  civil  works  for  the \nrelated subproject including any section-wise handover thereof, strictly in \naccordance  with  the  stipulation  in  the  related  civil  works  contract.  If, \n\n \n2. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nduring detailed design and implementation, any modification or additional \nland acquisition or involuntary resettlement impacts are identified, the EA \nwill  prepare  or  modify  the  resettlement  plan  (RP)  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  and  the  resettlement  framework, \nand will seek the prior approval of ADB before the further implementation \nof RPs.  \n\nThe PMUs will ensure that efficient grievance redresses mechanisms are \nin place to assist APs in resolving their queries and complaints in a timely \nmanner. \n\nERA  will  make  available  all  the  necessary  funds  in  a  timely  manner  so \nthat RPs are implemented and full reimbursement for acquired assets is \nmade to the APs well in advance so as to provide them sufficient time to \nmake alternative arrangements before the commencement of civil works. \n\nSimilarly, any adverse impacts on indigenous people identified during the \nplanning,  design,  and  implementation  of  any  subproject  would  need  an \nindigenous  peoples  development  plan  or  the  integration  of  specific \nactions  in  favor  of  indigenous  peoples  in  the  RP  in  accordance  with \nindigenous  peoples \nIndigenous  Peoples  and \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on \ndevelopment  framework,  and  the  plan  needs  to  be  (a) approved  before \nthe award of civil works and (b) implemented before the commencement \nof civil works. \n\nA  high-powered  committee  will  be  established  at  the  state  level  within  1 \nmonth  of  the  effectivity  of  the  first  loan,  to  acquire  land  through  direct \nnegotiation  with \nthe  affected  persons  (Appendix  8:  Resettlement \nFramework).  This  committee  will  make  independent  valuation  of  land  on \nthe  basis  of  its  replacement  value.  Negotiations,  if  any,  will  be  voluntary \nand devoid of any coercion. The participation or representation of APs or \nother representatives will be mandatory in all negotiations. Minutes of all \nnegotiations  covering  the  key  points  of  discussion  and  outcomes  will  be \nmaintained  by  ERA.  In  addition,  the  committee  will  establish  the \ntransitional allowances  in  accordance  with  the  RP  and  the  assistance to \nbe  provided  to  APs  on  the  basis  of  the  prevailing  rates  to  restore \nlivelihoods to pre-project levels. \n\n(viii)  A  senior  officer  to  be  appointed  by  the  ERA  will  be  responsible  for \nensuring  compliance  with  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies. \nOne resettlement officer at each PMU will also be appointed to supervise \nthe  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  and  the  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment plan (if any). \n\n(ix) \n\nAn  independent  agency  or  institution  (that  may  include  established  and \nregistered  NGO(s))  will  be  engaged  by  the  ERA  to  undertake  external \nmonitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the  RP  (including  negotiated \nsettlements, if any) and the indigenous peoples development plan (if any); \nthat will also submit reports semiannually to ADB through ERA for review \nand disclosure in accordance with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii)  \n\n(iii)  \n\n \n\n3. \n\nHIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking and Labor  \n\n \n92. \nThe state through ERA will ensure that the civil works contractors under the Program will \nfollow all applicable labor laws of the Government and the State shall incorporate provisions to \nthe effect that the contractors will (i) carry out HIV/AIDS awareness programs for labor; (ii) not \nemploy  or  use  children  as  labor;  (iii)  disseminate  information  at  work  sites  on  the  risks  of \nsexually  transmitted  diseases  and  HIV/AIDS,  as  part  of  health  and  safety  measures  for  those \nemployed  during  construction;  and  (iv)  follow  and  implement  all  statutory  provisions  on  labor \n(including equal pay for equal work), health, safety, welfare, sanitation, and working conditions. \nThe civil works contracts will also provide for termination of the contract by the state or ERA in \ncase of breach of any of the stated provisions by the contractors. \n \n\n4. \n\nEnvironment  \n\n \n93.

Sub-projects  must  demonstrate  financial  and \ninstitutional  sustainability;  this  will  be  demonstrated  by  a  5  year  horizon  business  plan  that \ntargets  100%  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  cost  recovery  by  the  end  of  the  Investment \nProgram. The business plan must  address O&M cost, sources of funds i.e, State  support and \nuser charges, O&M staffing needs and service level targets agreed with the urban local bodies. \n\n\f46     Appendix 5  \n\n \n\nThe  business  plans  must  also  describe  the  institutional  arrangements  for  implementation  and \nhandover of the sub projects from ERA to the service providing agency. \n \n9. \nEconomic Criteria. The sub-project must be part of the overall master plan for the sub \nsector and it should have an economic internal rate of return of at least 12% or it should be the \nleast cost technical option of providing the particular service. \n \n10. \nThe  project  should  have  adequate  arrangements  to  implement  the  project  and  the \noperation and maintenance team should be in place including financial allocation as part of the \nmunicipal budget.  \n \n11. \nSocial Criteria. The subproject will, to the extent possible, not require land acquisition or \nresettlement  (which  includes  the  displacement  of  squatters  or  encroachers  from  the  rights  of \nway). If land acquisition or involuntary resettlement is required for a subproject, a Resettlement \nPlan  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  in  accordance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of \nthe State Government, ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and the agreed Resettlement \nFramework (Appendix 8). \n \n12. \nIf  any  indigenous  peoples/scheduled  tribes  are  likely  to  be  affected  significantly  by  a \nsubproject,  an  Indigenous  People  Development  Plan  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  in \naccordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  People  (1998)  and  the  agreed  Indigenous \nPeople\u2019s Development Framework (Supplementary Appendix C) \n \n13. \nEnvironmental  Criteria.

Each  subproject  will  be  prepared  and  processed  in  accordance  with  the \n\n1. \n\nFor all loans other than the first  \n\na) \n\nb) \n\nFeasibility study, for all subprojects to be considered under the respective Loans, \nwill be conducted by the EA including its cost estimate. The EA will also prepare \n(i) an initial poverty and social assessment and fill out checklist for (ii) involuntary \nresettlement;  (iii)  indigenous  people;  and  (iv)  an  environmental  screening;  and \nsubmit the same for ADB\u2019s review and categorization. \n\nBased  on  the  categorization  and  upon  completion  of  the  detailed  engineering \ndesign,  the  EA  will  prepare  the  appraisal  reports  for  all  subprojects  to  be \nconsidered  under  the  respective  Loans  following  the  selection  criteria,  together \nwith  the  required  attachments  i.e.  appropriate  resettlement  plan,  indigenous \npeople  development  plan  and  environmental  assessment  and  submit  the  same \nwith form of periodic financing agreement to ADB for approval. However, if any of \nthe  subprojects  is  categorized  as  environmentally  category  A  or  B  sensitive \nsubproject,  in  any  subsequent  loan,  requires  compliance  with  the  120-day \nadvance  disclosure  rule.  The  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  or \nsummary initial environmental examination reports must be circulated to the ADB \n\n\fAppendix 5            \n\n47\n\nBoard  and  made  available  to  the  general  public  120  days  before  the  PFR  is \nsubmitted to ADB. \n\nc)  The EA will translate the resettlement plan in the local language and disclose it to \nthe affected people and incorporate the results of the consultation, before ADB\u2019s \napproval. The final RP will also be disclosed on the ADB website and the website \nof EA. \n\nd)  ADB  will  review  the  summary  appraisal  report  together  with  the  required \nattachments.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a \nnational priority in country \npoverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a \nnational priority in country \npoverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to the reduction of poverty in India: \nThe Program is primarily designed to improve urban infrastructure and services in the two principal cities of \nJammu  and  Srinagar  and  in  selected  tourist  centers  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir  state.  It  will  also  build  local \ncapability to run and manage the facilities.  \n \nBoth Jammu and Srinagar have witnessed large-scale migration from rural areas, mostly driven by security \nconcerns  over  the  last  decades;  consequently,  the  infrastructure  is  highly  stressed.  By  providing  urban \ninfrastructure  and  services  particularly  in  underserved  areas,  the  Program  will  improve  access  to  services \nand  contribute  to  urban  development,  the  overall  enhancement  of  the  quality  of  life,  and  the  reduction  of \npoverty in the two cities.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                           Targeting Classification:  General Intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nSample subprojects for project preparation were selected from each of the four major urban components\u2014\nwater supply, sewerage, solid waste management, and urban transport. Two of the four sample subprojects \nare in Jammu and the other two in Srinagar.  \n \nA sample socioeconomic baseline survey was undertaken in the two cities among a representative sample \nof 2,339 households. Eight-five percent of the households considered the Program beneficial and expected \nimprovements  in  the  lives  of  the  local  residents. The  rest  felt  that  the  Program  would  have  limited  impact. \nFive percent of the households were below the poverty line (BPL) with a per capita income of Rs420.20 per \nmonth  and  with  limited  access  to  urban  services,  according  to  the  National  Human  Development  Report \n(2001). This percentage figure is higher than the 1.98% mentioned in state-level urban BPL statistics. The \nincidence of BPL households is almost the same in Jammu and Srinagar. The mean household income of \nBPL  households  is  about  Rs2,000  per  month.  BPL  households  also  considered  the  Program  particularly \nbeneficial to them if implemented. \n \nThe overall direct benefits from the Program will come from improvements in basic service provision in the \nbeneficiary areas. Residents will benefit from improved living conditions, a healthier living environment, and \nthe prospect of improved health.  \n \nIn  addition,  the  selection  of  subprojects  under  the  Program  is  based  on  social  and  poverty  indicators \napplicable  in  the  urban  context  and  on  the  limited  access  of  the  poor  to  basic  urban  services.  The  low-\nincome  group  with  limited  access  to  urban  services  stands  to  benefit  from  better  access  to  better-quality \nservices.   \n \nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n  Yes \n  Yes \n\n  No \n  No \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nAs part of the initial poverty and social assessment study during Program preparation, discussions were held \nwith Program beneficiaries, namely, local residents, local resident welfare committees, and most importantly \nwomen in the communities. Particular attention was paid to ensuring the participation of socioeconomically \nvulnerable  groups  and  BPL  households  in  the  process.  Separate  focus  group  discussions  were  held  with \nthese groups to get their views and opinions on the Program.  \n \nAll  these  discussions  were  aimed  primarily  at  (i)  informing  the  communities  and  the  people  about  the \nproposed  Program;  (ii)  getting  wider  public  input  and  suggestions  from  stakeholders  on  the  Program, \nparticularly their priority needs with regard to the sector; and (iii) assessing the current role and functions of \nthe local residents\u2019 organizations.  \n\n\f \n58       Appendix 7 \n\n \nThese discussions and consultations confirmed the need for the Program, with all socioeconomic groups in \nthe community responding positively to it. The key benefits of the Program, according to the stakeholders, \nare : (i) improved cleanliness  and hygiene, and reduction  in  waterborne diseases; (ii) improved health; (iii) \nbetter  services  and  less  drudgery  involved  in  collecting  water  and  gaining  access  to  other  services, \nparticularly  for  women;  (iv)  less  likelihood  of  flooding  and,  hence,  reduced  expenditure  on  repair  and \nmaintenance of property; and (v) improved living conditions and a healthier living environment.  \n \nA  community  participation  strategy  (Supplementary  Appendix  F)  has  been  prepared  for  the  Program  to \nensure the participation of the community (including women) in Program planning and implementation.  \nD.  Gender and Development \n\nAn attempt was made during the IPSA to understand gender-specific roles, status, needs, and problems in \nthe  two  cities  through  gender  analysis.  Attempts  were  also  made  to  ascertain  the  gender  impacts  of  the \nProgram  through  focus  group  discussions  with  women  from  different  socioeconomic  groups  in  the \nsubproject  areas.  These  discussions  were  held  to  capture  women\u2019s  collective  perceptions  about  social, \neconomic,  and  cultural  norms  and  their  access  to  facilities,  and  the  results  were  further  substantiated \nthrough participatory rural appraisal exercises.  \n \nThe  improvement  of  urban  services,  particularly  water  supply  and  sanitation,  according  to  the  women \nparticipants, will have far-reaching impact on them and their lives. The women participants in both cities said \nthat the project would empower them by giving them greater access to services and resources. A key benefit \nthey  identified  was  the  reduced  time  that  would  be  required  for  health  maintenance  and  care  giving, \nparticularly  with  the  water  supply  improvements,  giving  them  more  time  for  productive  endeavors, \nempowerment  activities,  and  leisure.  Better  urban  services,  and  particularly  better  city  roads,  according  to \nmost  of  the  women  participants,  would  give  them  greater  access  to  resources  such  as  medical  facilities, \nschools, and transportation. The indirect benefit of the Program to women would be a healthier and cleaner \nenvironment, thereby contributing to a better quality of life overall. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n\f \nE.

A  100%  census \nsurvey  was  undertaken  for  these  two  subprojects \nto  identify  all  Program-related  impacts.  A  full  RP \nfor \n(Supplementary \nAppendix  G)  and  a  short  RP  for  the  solid  waste \nmanagement subproject (Supplementary Appendix \nH)  were  prepared  to  mitigate  and  address  all \nanticipated losses.  \n \nThe transport subproject will occur mainly along an \nexisting  right-of-way  and  will  involve  mainly  strip \nacquisition  where \ntotal  of  67 \nhouseholds  (339  APs)  will  be  affected  by  the \nsubproject.

A \ndirect-access road to the disposal site will be built. \nA total of 12.3 kanal (0.67 hectares) of private land \nwill  be  required.  A  total  of  34  households  (184 \nAPs) will be affected by the subproject.  \n \nFor  all  other  subprojects  that  entail  resettlement, \nthe  EA  will  prepare  RPs  on  the  basis  of  the \nresettlement  framework  (Appendix  8)  prepared  for \nthe Program. \nTariffs  will \nthe \nimplementation of the components of the Program.   \n\nrequired.

In  keeping  with  ADB\u2019s  sector  loan \nprocedures;  this  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  to  set  out  the  resettlement  policy \nand  screening  and  planning  procedures  that  will  apply  to  subprojects,  components,  or \ninvestments  that  are  prepared  and  approved  during  loan  implementation  to  ensure  that  they \nconform  to  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy.  The  Framework  thus,  identifies  the  broad \nscope  of  the  project  and  outlines  the  policy,  procedures  for  acquisition  of  land,  compensation \nand other assistance measures for affected persons and institutional requirements for preparing \nsubsequent sub-projects under the sector loan.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  resettlement  principles  adopted  in  this  framework  recognize  the  State  Land \nAcquisition  (LA)  Act  1990  and  the  entitlement  benefits  as  listed  in  the  National  Policy  on \nResettlement  and  Rehabilitation,  (Govt  of  India)  as  notified  in  February  2004  and  the  relevant \nAsian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  policies  and  operations  manuals,  in  particular  the  Policy  on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (1995),  and  Operations  Manual  F2  on  Involuntary  Resettlement \n(2003).  \n \nFollowing  the  state  laws  and  regulation  on  land  acquisition  and  incorporating  ADB \n4. \npolicies  and  operations  manuals  as  well  as  the  National  Policy  on  Resettlement  and \nRehabilitation, the basic principles for the Project will include the following elements with respect \nto each subproject:  \n \n\nResettlement Policy and Framework \n\na)  As a matter of policy, land acquisition, and other involuntary resettlement impacts would \n\nbe minimized as much as possible; \n\nb)  Any land acquisition and/or resettlement will be carried out and compensation provided in \norder  to  improve  or  at  least  restore  the  pre-Project  income  and  living  standards  of  the \naffected people; \n\nc)  Consultation  with  affected  people  on  compensation  options  and  preparation \n\nResettlement Plan (RP) in accordance with this Framework; \n\nd)  Payment of compensation for acquired assets at market/replacement rates; \ne)  Payment of compensation for lost land, housing, assets and resettlement allowances in \nfull  prior  to  the  contractor  taking  physical  acquisition  of  the  land  and  prior  to    the \ncommencement of any construction activities; \n\n                                                 \n1  The  towns  initially  selected  for  consideration  are  Patnitop  (Jammu  region),  Gulmarg,  Pahalgam  and  Sonamarg \n\n(Kashmir region). \n\n\f62 \n\n     Appendix 8 \n\nf)  All compensation and other assistances2 will be paid to all affected people (AP) prior to \n\ncommencement of civil works.  \n\ng)  Income restoration and rehabilitation; \nh)  An entitlement matrix (Table-1) for different categories of people affected by the project \nhas  been  prepared  and  provisions  will  be  kept  in  the  budget  for  those  who  were  not \npresent at the time of census survey. However, people moving in the project area after \nthe cut-off date will not be entitled to any assistance. In case of land acquisition the date \nof notification for acquisition will be treated as cut-off date. For non-titleholders such as \nsquatters and encroachers the date of project census survey or a similar designated date \ndeclared by the executing agency will be considered as cut-off date. \"  and \n\ni)  Special attention to vulnerable groups. \n\nProcedures for Resettlement Plan (RP) Preparation \n\n \nC. \n \n5. \nundertaken by the Program Management Units in keeping with the following:  \n \n\nEach  subproject  will  be  prepared,  and  the  detail  design  of  each  subproject  will  be \n\na)  Social  impact  assessment  surveys  including  100%  Census  survey  of  the  affected \npeople,  an  asset  inventory,  landownership,  usage  and  productivity  assessments  and \ndata  on  the  existing  economic  and  social  condition  of  the  affected  people  including  a \npoverty assessment and a survey of atleast 10% of the affected people and 20% of the \nseriously affected people, together with local-level impact data;  \n\nb)  If impacts are found to be \u201csignificant,\u201d3 a full RP will be prepared  for each subproject for \n\napproval prior to award of contracts for that subproject;   \n\nc)  If  subproject  impacts  are  less  than  significant,  a  short  RP  will  be  prepared  for  that \n\nsubproject for approval prior to award of contracts for that subproject; and  \n\nd)  The  RP  would  also  include  measures  to  ensure  that  socio-economic  condition,  needs \nand  priorities  of  women  are  identified  and  that  the  process  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement does not disadvantage women.   \n\n \n6. \nThe  RP  prepared  for  the  subproject  will  be  used  as  a  model  for  the  preparation  of \nsubsequent  RPs.  The  RPs  shall  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and \nother social safeguard guidelines. The additional full or short RPs will be disclosed to the APs, \nendorsed by the executing agency and will be submitted to ADB for approval prior to award of \ncivil works contracts for a subproject. The full RP, not just the summary will be disclosed to the \nAPs as well as uploaded on the ADB website after ADB review and approval. In case impacts \non Indigenous People are identified, then appropriate mitigative actions for them depending on \nthe magnitude of the Project impacts and sensitivity of IP issues will be undertaken in the form \nof  either  preparation  of  a  full  Indigenous  People\u2019s  Development  Plan  (IPDP)  or  integration  of \n\n                                                 \n2 While compensation is required prior to dispossession or displacement of affected people from their assets, the full \nresettlement plan implementation, which may require income rehabilitation measures, might be completed only over \na  longer  period  of  time  after  civil  works  have  begun.  Affected  people  will  be  provided  with  certain  resettlement \nentitlements,  such  as  land  and  asset  compensation  and  transfer  allowances,  prior  to  their  displacement, \ndispossession, or restricted access. \n3  Source: Asian Development Bank Operations Manual \u2013Operational Procedure on Involuntary Resettlement  \nInvoluntary Resettlement Category A: Significant means 200 or more people will experience major impacts, which \nare  defined  as  (i)  being  physically  displaced  from  housing,  or  (ii)  losing  10%  or  more  of  their  productive  assets \n(income generating).

The  Roadmap  and \nInvestment Program aims to improve the urban environment, public health and \neconomic  opportunities  for  the  2.4  million  urban  residents  in  J&K.  It  will  also \nindirectly  benefit  the  State\u2019s  rural  population  of  9.6  million  people  through \nimproved economic opportunities.  This will be achieved through expansion of \nbasic municipal services to meet the service standards of India in the State\u2019s \nprincipal  cities  of  Jammu  and  Srinagar  and  other  economically  important \ntowns,  including  several  that  have  excellent  potential  for  increased  tourism \ninvestment by the private sector. The proposed Investment Program builds on \nthe  ongoing  Loan  2151-IND:  Multi-sector  Project \nInfrastructure \nRehabilitation  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir.1  This  ongoing  project  is  limited  to \nrehabilitation  of  key  urban  infrastructure  in  Jammu  and  Srinagar  and  about \n2000  kilometers  of  rural  roads  to  improve  access  and  connectivity,  but  does \nnot  include  expansion  of  facilities,  except  as  in  the  normal  course  of \nrehabilitation.  \n   \nThe maintenance of existing infrastructure and expansion to meet the ongoing \npopulation growth has been inadequate. The State and the India have agreed \nto  address  these  deficiencies  through  a  major  Investment  Program  based  on \nthe 10th 5-Year Plan, combined with the 11th 5-Year Plan and the related road \nmap developed for the Investment Program as depicted in Schedule 1. Much \nof  the  proposed  investments  in  water  supply,  sanitation  and  transportation \naccess will benefit the urban poor, who live without adequate water supply or \nsanitation. In particular, the sewerage and drainage improvements will improve \nthe  public  health  in  the  lower  income  and  poor  sections  of  all  participating \ntowns. \n \nDuring formulation of the proposed Investment Program there has been public \nconsultations and the proposed investments have the support of stakeholders. \nIn  addition,  there  has  been  extensive  policy  dialogue  with  the  State  line \n(PHED)  currently \ndepartments;  Public  Health  Engineering  Department \nresponsible  for  water,  the  Urban  Environmental  Engineering  Department \n(UEED) responsible for sewerage and main drainage channels, Public Works \nDepartment  (PWD)  responsible  for  roads,  the  State  Wild  Life  and  Forestry \nDepartment,  the  municipal  corporations  of  Jammu  and  Srinagar  responsible \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n1 For $250 million approved in December 2004. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nfor  solid  waste  and  local  drainage,  the  mayor  and  development  authorities  of \nthe  other  towns,  as  well  as  the  various  State  agencies  responsible  for  land \nuse,  zoning,  building  codes  and  approvals,  new  area  development  ,  finance \nand  revenues.  The  key  policy  aspects  relate  to  the  State\u2019s  plan  to  make  the \nJammu and Srinagar municipal corporations autonomous entities. In addition, \nas  in  all  urban  projects  in  India,  improved  municipal  administration,  revenue \nenhancement  and  accounting  are  major  requirements  for  which  extensive \ncapacity  building  and  training  of  staff  has  been  incorporated  into  the \nInvestment Program.  \n    \nInvestment Program: \n \nThe total cost of J&K\u2019s  urban sector development plan and sector strategy is \nestimated to be $2 billion, equivalent, over the period 2006 to 2026. The total \ncost  of  the  Roadmap  and  Investment  Program  supported  by  ADB\u2019s  facility, \nfrom 2007 through 2015, is expected to be $485 million, equivalent.  \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s  support  is  intended  to  help  finance  the  State\u2019s  transactions  under  the \nInvestment  Program  described  in  Schedule  1,  subject  to  the  subproject \nselection  criteria  set  out  in  Schedule  4.  The  investments  will  include \nimprovements in urban infrastructure in Jammu, Srinagar and other important \ntowns. The actual towns to be selected for inclusion in the Investment Program \nwill  be  finalized  once  the  State\u2019s  economic  opportunity  development  strategy \nand  related  master  plans  have  been  completed.  The  investments  will  include \nrehabilitation,  upgrading  and  expansion  of  water  supply  systems,  sewage \ncollection  from  high  density  areas  with  treatment,  drainage,  solid  waste \nmanagement  (SWM)  facilities,  urban  roads  and  bridges  including  roads \nconnecting these important towns, and municipal facilities aimed at improving \nthe quality of life for low income residents and poor persons through facilities \nlike  public  toilets  and  baths,  fire  protection  and  local  clinics.

The safeguard requirements for each financing loan, as well as the \ncategorization of each loan, will follow the approach and procedure defined in \nexisting  ADB  Safeguard  Polices  and  applicable  laws  in  India  and  the  State.. \nADB  safeguard  policies  currently  include  (i)  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995), \n(ii) Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), and (iii) Environment Policy (2002).  \n\nAll  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  under  the  Facility  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \nAll  consulting  services  to  be  financed  under  the  Facility  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (April  2006,  as \namended from time to time).  \n \n\n                                                 \n7 Subprojects categorized as environment category B sensitive or A, ADB\u2019s \u201c120 days\u201d rule will apply before submission of \n\nPFR to ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy and Public Communication Policy. \n\n\f \n\n \nDisbursements \n\nMonitoring, \nEvaluation, \nReporting \nArrangements. \n\nand \n\n \n\n7\n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing: \n \nUnder  each  loan  of  the  facility,  advance  contracting  of  civil  works  and \nequipment  and  materials,  and  recruitment  of  consulting  services  will  be \nproposed subject to these being eligible in accordance with agreed procedures \nand guidelines as above. \n \nExcept  as  otherwise  agreed  with  ADB,  the  expenditures  incurred  for  civil \nworks,  equipment  and  materials  and  consulting  services  eligible  for  advance \naction will also be eligible for retroactive financing under the first loan, provided \nthat  these  are  incurred  for  a  period  no  longer  than  12  months  prior  to  the \nsigning  of  the  related  loan  and  project  agreements,  and  do  not  exceed  an \namount  equivalent  to  twenty  percent  (20%)  of  the  loan.  Retroactive  financing \nrequest for subsequent loans will be considered during processing of individual \nPFRs. India and the State have been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance \naction  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  constitute  a  commitment  to  finance \nrelevant expenditures under the facility. \n  \nLoan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook  (January,  2007  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  facilitate \nInvestment  Program  implementation,  India  will  establish  an  imprest  account \nand GoJ&K through ERA may establish a second generation imprest account \n(SGIA)  with  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  both  ADB  and  the  Borrower. \nSeparate  Imprest  Account  and  SGIA  will  be  established  for  each  Loan.  The \nSGIA will be a current account. The initial and all the subsequent amounts to \nbe deposited into the imprest account and into the SGIA will be determined by \nADB  in  consultation  with  India  and  ERA,  with  particular  reference  to  the \npipeline of awarded contracts. The draw-down will not exceed the lesser of the \nequivalent of 3 months of current project expenditures or 10% of the total loan \namount  and  will  be  estimated  based  on  disbursements  expected  under \ncontracts  over  the  next  3  months.  The  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE) \nprocedure will be adopted for reimbursing and liquidating the SGIA for eligible \nexpenditures  not  exceeding  $50,000  per  payment,  except  as  ADB  may \notherwise agree during facility implementation. \n \nERA will recruit design and supervision consultants to plan, design, supervise \nconstruction, maintain quality control, review and recommend progress claims \nand prepare as built drawings. They will recruit project support consultants, if \nnecessary to assist ERA with managing the overall Investment Program. ERA \nwill establish an Investment Program Performance Monitoring System (IPPMS) \nacceptable to ADB within 3 months of the effectiveness of the first loan under \nthe MFF and under each succeeding loan. The IPPMS system will first select a \nbaseline  data  for  each  of  the  selected  indicators  and  will  conduct  annual \nsurveys  with  the  assistance  of  consultants  and  update  ADB  and  the \nGovernment  on  the  progress  against  each  indicator.  ERA  will  also  submit \nquarterly  progress  reports  in  the  format  to  be  attached  with  the  Facility \nAdministration  Memorandum.  The  monitoring  reports  will  also  be  used  for \nshaping  the   subprojects to  be  developed for  succeeding  PFRs  and  loan  \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nRepresentations \nand Warranties \n\ntranches.  Quarterly  reviews  will  be  completed  by  the  tripartite  project  review \nmeetings  chaired  by  the  Government  and  attended  by  ERA  and  ADB. \nImplementation of resettlement plans under the program will be monitored by \nindependent  agency/institution  (that  may  include  established  and  registered \nNGO(s))..  The  project  accounts  will  be  audited  annually  and  submitted  for \nreview  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  In  addition  to  the  regular  loan  review \nmissions,  a  midterm  review  will  be  conducted  in  June  2012.  The  reviews  will \ninclude  a  summary  of  contracts  awards  and  disbursement,  implementation \nprogress  including  progress  against  institutional  development  and  capacity \nbuilding  milestones.  The  midterm  review  will  also  identify  problems  or \nweaknesses in implementation arrangements, and agree on changes needed. \nWithin three months of physical completion of any Loan under the MFF, the EA \nwill  submit  to  ADB  individual  projects  completion  report  and  a  program \ncompletion report, within three months of the completion of the facility.  \n \nIn  addition  to  standard  Representations  and  warranties,  India  through  the \nState GoJ&K, assures the following actions: \n \nSpecific Representations and Warranties \n\nTechnical.  GoJ&K  will  finalize  Master  plans  for  water  supply,  sewerage  and \ndrainage,  and  solid  waste  management  before  January  2009  and  all \nengineering  structures  will  be  designed  in  accordance  with  Indian  standards \nfor earthquake resistant buildings. \n\n \n\nthe  program  and  achieve \n\nCapacity  Building,  Institutional  Development  Governance  and  Anti-\ncorruption:  The  Facility  funds  are  utilized  effectively  and  efficiently  to \nimplement \nthe  objectives.  ERA  will  ensure \ncompliance  with  the  specific  anticorruption  and  governance  risk  mitigation \nmeasures,  which  are  identified  in  the  Table  1  of  Schedule  3  and  will  take \nmeasures  to  improve  urban  governance  in  accordance  with  the  institutional \nreform road map in Schedule 1. \n \nFiduciary  Oversight.  Each  project  accounts  will  be  audited  by  independent \nauditors  whose  qualifications,  experience  and \nterms  of  reference  are \nacceptable to ADB and audit reports will be submitted to ADB within 9 months \nof the end of the fiscal year. \n \nCounterpart  Funds.  Sufficient  counterpart  funds  by  the  GoJ&K  are  made \navailable  from  its  budget  for  each  fiscal  year,  in  a  timely  manner,  for  the \nefficient implementation of the Investment Program. \n \nProject Selection. All subprojects meet, to the satisfaction of ADB, the criteria \ndescribed in Schedule 4 of this FFA.  \n \nSafeguards.  The  projects  under  the  MFF  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance \nwith  safeguard  policies  of  ADB;  and  the  Indigenous  People  Development \nFramework,  Resettlement  Framework  and  Environmental  Assessment  and \nReview Framework developed under the MFF.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIndia \n \n \n \n \nBy __  _Original_ Signed     \nNavin Kr.

Indian  cities  are  the  major  engines  of  this \ngrowth, contributing to more than 60% of the gross domestic product (GDP). In Jammu and Kashmir \nState  (J&K),  the  State\u2019s  economy  is  primarily  dependant  on  services,  tourism  and  trade,  and \nagriculture. There has been a shift in the contribution to the State\u2019s GDP from the primary sectors to \ntrade,  commerce  and  services.  Considered  gateways  to  the  respective  regions  and  tourist  spots, \nJammu and Srinagar\u2019s urban agglomerations account for over 63% of the State\u2019s urban population. \nFollowing the recent reduction in disturbances in the State, tourist inflow has reached the 6.5 million \nmakr, and is projected to reach 22 million by 2020. With the resurgence of the State\u2019s economy, the \nmain issue is to manage urban and economic growth and for the newly established city corporations \nin Jammu and Srinagar to be able to meet their service delivery obligations. ADB\u2019s country strategy \nsupports  the  vision  of  the  Government  to  improve  the  economy  through  infrastructure-led  growth. \nThe State has already initiated improvements to basic services through the ongoing ADB financed \nurban and rural infrastructure rehabilitation project.8  \n \n2. \nRecent improvement in the security situation and growth in tourisms provides the State with \nan  opportunity  to  improve  its  economy  further  but  this  will  require  urgent  improvements  in  the \ndecrepit  infrastructure. The  Central  and  State Governments  are  making  a  conscious  effort  to bring \nabout the much needed change. Immediate focus of the State Government is to develop the State\u2019s \nurban  centers  as  engines  of  economic  growth.  To  achieve  this,  the  State  has  already  passed  the \nmunicipal  act  (2000)  creating  the  new  city  corporations  of  Jammu  and  Srinagar,  where  the  first \nelections  for  city  council  were  held  in  2005.  The  State  now  intends  to  improve  the  basic  urban \nservices, particularly water and sanitation in these two cities, along with other important towns with \ntourism  growth  potential.  Concurrently,  the  State  plans  to  de-centralize  the  service  delivery \nmechanisms to the newly responsible city corporations. This will require building the capacity of the \nurban  local  bodies  and  state  line  departments  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  infrastructure \ninvestments.  \n \n3. \nkey constraints were identified: \n \n\nAfter a detailed assessment of the existing situation of the urban sector in J&K, the following \n\n(a)  \nInvestments:  limited  due  to  disturbances,  resource  constraints,  staff  capacity  and \nlack willingness of private sector investors to work in the State, and poor basic services, that do \nnot live up to the expectations of many tourists; \n(b) \nStrategic.  absence  of  sector  policies  that  focuses  on  sustainable  and  planned \ngrowth,  limited  recognition  of  the  importance  of  the  urban  sector  in  terms  of  its  role  in  the \neconomy and the limited legal and institutional mechanism to achieve the sector objectives; \nLegislative  issues:  in  terms  of  clarity  in  roles  and  responsibilities  of  institutions, \n(c)  \nrelated  powers  to  raise  resources  and  the  rules  and  mechanisms  to  govern  designated \nfunctions; and  \n(d) \ninfrastructure. \n \n\nStaffing. capacity to plan, design and implement programs, and operate and maintain \n\n4. \nConsidering  these  constraints,  the  monopolistic  nature  of  the  basic  urban  services  and \nconstitutional requirements9, Government intervention is required for the time being, as even more \n                                                 \n8 Loan 2151-IND: Multi-sector Project for Infrastructure Rehabilitation in Jammu and Kashmir, for $250 million, approved on \n22 December 2004. \n9 Water and sanitation are the obligatory function of local bodies \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nso than in the rest of India. The State has developed a sector road map to addresses the investment \nbacklog and the need for management reforms and capacity building, and for maintaining a balance \nbetween the two. As part of its longer term road map, the State is seeking financial assistance from \nADB,  in  conjunction  with  the  Jawahal  Nehru  National  Urban  Renewal  Mission  (JNNURM),  a \nGovernment of India (GoI) supported program for fast track, reform driven, planned development of \n63  major  towns  of  India,  including  Jammu  and  Srinagar.  The  road  map  also  contemplates \ndeveloping  a  market  for  private  sector  participation,  initially  for  O&M  of  complicated  sewage \ntreatment facilities and tourism related infrastructure. \n \n5. \nfollowing reform initiatives: \n \n\nRecognizing the importance of reforming the urban sector, the State has already taken  the \n\n(i)  Amended  the  Municipal  Legislation  Act  and  introduced  new  acts  for  municipalities  and \ncorporations (2000) and held city council elections in Jammu and Srinagar for the first time \nin 2005;  \n\n(ii)  Constituted the State Finance Commission to strengthen state-local body relationships and \ninitiate  actions  to  devolve  functions  such  as  drainage,  sewerage  and  water  supply  to  the \nlocal bodies; \n\n(iii)  Initiated capacity building program for councilors and municipal officials through  state level \n\ntraining institutes;  \n\n(iv)  To overcome implementation capacity issues, promoted use of external experts for design \nand management of projects, as is being done for the ongoing ADB financed project, which \nwill be extended to O&M of services, and \n\n(v)  Developed  capacity  to  plan,  design  and  implement  programs  and  cadre  related  issues \n\nmore specifically at the municipal level.  \n \n6. \nRoad  Map  for  Investment.  The  State  has  prepared  a  medium  term  investment  plan  for \nurban  facilities  through  2014  and  a  longer  term  plan  through  2026.  Investments  in  physical \ninfrastructure  will  be  accompanied  by  a  program  of  urban  sector  reforms  aimed  at  better \nmanagement  of  services  and  formation  of  accountable  service  delivery  mechanism  and  financial \nautonomy through transfer of responsibility and accountability for services to the city corporations on \na  gradual  basis  from  the  current  State  line  departments.  The  total  investment  program  under  the \nroad map is summarized in Table A3.1. The estimated investment requirements will be met partially \nfrom the ongoing ADB financed project, the State\u2019s ongoing \u201cplan\u201d expenditures, the JNNURM and \nthe proposed Facility financed by ADB. The Government will use the proposed ADB investments to \nimprove the public health, environment and economic opportunities of local people to help stabilize \nand  energize  the  local  economy  and  address  social  inequalities,  especially  in  the  poor  and  low \nincome sectors of the population.  \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                  \n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n \n \nTable 1: Investment Plan of the State for Urban Infrastructure \n($ Million) \n \nOngoing loan \n(Loan 2151-\nIND) \n\nProposed \nunder \nJNNURM \n\nEstimated \ninvestment \nneeds till \n2026 \n\nState plan \nfunds for \nurban \ninfrastructure* \n(including \nLWDA \nprojects) \n\n259.0 \n\n372.0 \n\n35.3 \n\n40.0\n\n23.0\n\n7.5\n\nEstimated \ncost of \nthe \nproposed \nADB \nprogram  \n\nAdditional \nInvestment \nneeds till \n2026** \n\n74.0\n\n65.0\n\n32.2 \n\n33.4\n\n201.0\n\n31.0 \n\n48.1\n\n83.3\n\n3.6\n\n16.0\n\n8.0 \n\n908.0 \n\n30.0  \n\n77.0\n\n246.0 \n\n555.3\n\n75.0 \n\n6.0  \n\n40.0\n\n \n\n28.7\n\n150.0 \n\n30.0  \n\n78.0 \n\n42\n\nSub-sector \n\nWater \nSupply \n\nDrainage / \nSewerage \n\nMunicipal \nSolid Waste \nManagement \n\nUrban \nTransport \n\nPlanning, \ndesign and \ncapacity \nbuilding \n\nSlum \nimprovement \n& poverty \nalleviation \n\nOthers \n\n251.0 \n\n67.5  \n\nTotal \n\n2050.0 \n\n204.0\n\n111.0\n\n54.0\n\n454.0\n\n129.0 \n\n \n\n524.2 \n\n757.5\n\n*Normal allocations for miscellaneous small works \n** Subject to State requirements and JNNURM allocations \n \n7. \nInvestment  Program.  The  proposed  Investment  Program  will  be  implemented  over  an  8 \nyear period through 4-6 tranches loans under a new multi-tranche finance facility (MFF). Depending \non  the  speed  of  reforms,  and  development  of  ERA\u2019s  capacity,  the  proposed  4  tranches  could  be \nconverted to 5 to 6 tranches. The key assumptions underlying the scope of each loan are as follows: \n(i) sub-projects which are in an advanced stage of preparation, including the 4 core sub-projects will \nbe covered by the first loan, along with master planning of the remaining components and capacity \nbuilding;  (ii)  the  second  loan  will  commence  after  the  urban  sector  master  plans  for  water  supply, \nsewerage and traffic and transport have been updated and progress achieved on capacity building, \nimproved  municipal  administration  and  introduction  of  cost  reflective  tariffs  and  reorganizing  the \nservice  delivery  functions;  (iii)  the  third  loan  will  commence  after  detailed  master  plans  and \nenvironmental regulations are in place for the development of other important towns and commercial \ncenters,  and  (iv)  the  fourth  loan  will  finance  works  requiring  longer  preparation  period.  The  total \n\n\finvestments in each phase, and the related loan amount of ADB\u2019s loan program and the loan periods \nare summarized in Table 2 while the detailed implementation schedule is in Table 3.

In  parallel  with  the  physical \ninvestments,  the  State  will  move  ahead  with  a  number  of  initiatives  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of \nJammu and Srinagar municipal corporations. Traditionally under the State\u2019s Development Act, 1970 \nprovision of water, sewerage and major drainage and urban roads in the cities and district towns was \nprovided  through  the  PHED,  UEED  and  PWD,  respectively.  The  cities  were  responsible  for  solid \nwaste  management  and  local  drainage.  In  year  2000,  the  State  established  the  Municipal \nCorporation Act which when fully implemented will shift much more responsibility for basic services \nto  the  corporations.  However,  the  corporations  have  only  been  operating  for  just  over  1  year,  with \nthe first elections for council held in 2005.  \n  \n9. \nthe  municipal \nmanagement  in  Jammu  and  Srinagar  including:  updating  of  property  records  and  tax  rolls  and \nrecords  of  all  users  of  municipal  services,  computerization  of  all    records,  accounts,  billing  and \ncollection  and  development  of  budgets  for  O&M.  This  will  include  provision  of  computers, \nstrengthening capacity of departments, training of staff in city management and training of technical \noperating  staff  to  improve  O&M.  The  key  aspects  that  will  be  set  out  in  the  Financing  Agreement \nnegotiated with India and in the Project Agreement that will be signed by the State are summarized \nin Table A3.4 below.

Works  pertaining  to  improvement  of  collection, \n\n3. \ntransportation, segregation and disposal of municipal waste. \n\nSWM  subproject  should  be  limited  to  only  Municipal  Waste;  proposal  for \nhazardous  or  biomedical  waste  will  not  be  eligible  for  financing  under  this \nprogram. \n\nSWM  equipments  and  vehicles  will  only  be  procured  once  the  ULBs  have \ndeveloped secured land fill site for solid waste management for the city. \n\nProposal  for  composting  plant  under  the  SWM  component  should  be \nsupported by the market analysis of demand of end product and the financial \nviability of the plants. \n\n(d) \n\nAll compost plant proposals should be based on private public partnership.  \n\n4. \nUrban Transport. Works related to improvement of riding quality, reduction of \ntraffic  congestion,  widening  of  existing  roads,  Bypass  arrangements,  car  parking \narrangements and improvement of pedestrian facilities. \n\n(a)  Work is limited to internal roads, and National Highways are excluded from the \n\nMFF. \n\n(b)  Works related to Mass transit system are also excluded from the MFF. \n\nOther Municipal/urban Infrastructure  \n\n \nSupport for  works relating to area  development/commercial infrastructure will \nbe  only  to  those  identified  by  the  Economic  Opportunity  Development \nPlan(EODP)/ Master Plan.  \n\nProposals  for  construction  of  slaughter  houses  will  be  conditional  to  the \nestablishment of waste treatment and disposal facilities. \n\nOther  works  relating  to  obligatory  municipal  functions  will  be  subject  to  a \nsituation  report  and  within  a  road  map  for  improvements  in  the  service \nfunctions. \n\n \nFinancial  and \n\nInstitutional  Criteria.  Sub-projects  must  demonstrate \n\nfinancial  and \n5. \ninstitutional  sustainability;  this  will  be  demonstrated  by  a  5  year  horizon  business  plan  that  targets \n100% O&M cost recovery by the end of the Investment Program. The business plan must address \nO&M  cost,  sources  of  funds  i.e,  State  support  and  user  charges,  O&M  staffing  needs  and  service \nlevel  targets  agreed  with  the  ULBs.  The  business  plans  must  also  describe  the  institutional \narrangements  for  implementation  and  handover  of  the  sub  projects  from  ERA  to  the  service \nproviding agency. \n\n\f \n\n33\n\n6. \nEconomic  Criteria.  The  sub-project  must  be  part  of  the  overall  master  plan  for  the  sub \nsector and it should have an EIRR of at least 12% or it should be the least cost technical option of \nproviding the particular service. \n\n7. \nThe project should have adequate arrangements to implement the project and the operation \nand  maintenance  team  should  be  in  place  including  financial  allocation  as  part  of  the  municipal \nbudget.  \n \n8. \nSocial  Criteria.  The  subproject  will,  to  the  extent  possible,  not  require  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement (which includes the displacement of squatters or encroachers from the rights of way). If \nland acquisition or involuntary resettlement is required for a subproject, a Resettlement Plan will be \nprepared  and  implemented  in  accordance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  State \nGovernment,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  the  agreed  Resettlement  Framework \n(Attachment 1of Schedule 5). \n\n9. \nIf  any  indigenous  peoples/scheduled  tribes  are  likely  to  be  affected  significantly  by  a \nsubproject,  an  Indigenous  People  Development  Plan  (IPDP)  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous People (1998) and the agreed Indigenous People\u2019s \nDevelopment Framework (Attachment 2 of Schedule 5) \n \nEnvironmental  Criteria.  The  subprojects  will  comply  with  environmental  requirements \n10. \nspecified  in  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  2002  and  those  specified  in  Country\u2019s  environmental \nregulations,  including  legislations  and  standards  of  the  Government  of  J&K.  Environmental \nassessment of individual sub project will be carried out and mitigation measures identified during the \nassessment  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review \nFramework (Attachment 3 of Schedule 5) of the Investment Program. \n\n \nProcedures.  Each  subproject  will  be  prepared  and  processed  in  accordance  with  the \n\n11. \nfollowing procedures: \n\n1.  For all  loans other than the first  \n\na.  Feasibility study, for all subprojects to be considered under the respective Loans, will \nbe  conducted  by  the  EA  including  its  cost  estimate.  The  EA  will  also  prepare  (i)  an \ninitial  poverty  and  social  assessment  (IPSA)  and  fill  out  checklist  for  (ii)  involuntary \nresettlement; (iii) indigenous people; and (iv) an environmental screening; and submit \nthe same for ADB\u2019s review and categorization. \n\nb.  Based on the categorization and upon completion of the detailed engineering design, \nthe  EA  will  prepare  the  appraisal  reports  for  all  subprojects  to  be  considered  under \nthe  respective  Loans  following  the  selection  criteria,  together  with  the  required \nattachments  i.e.  appropriate  resettlement  plan,  indigenous  people  development \nplan(IPDP) and environmental assessment and submit the same with form of periodic \nfinancing  agreement  to  ADB  for  approval.  However,  if  any  of  the  subprojects  is \ncategorized  as  environmentally  category  A  or  B  sensitive  subproject,  in  any \nsubsequent loan, requires compliance with the 120-day advance disclosure rule. The \nSEIA or SIEE must be circulated to the ADB Board and made available to the general \npublic 120 days before the PFR is submitted to ADB. \n\nc.  The EA will translate the resettlement plan in the local language and disclose it to the \naffected  people  and  incorporate  the  results  of  the  consultation,  before  ADB\u2019s \napproval. The final RP will also be disclosed on the ADB website and the website of \nEA. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\n \n\nd.  ADB will review the summary appraisal report together with the required attachments. \nIf  ADB  finds  that  a  proposed  subproject  is  not  likely  to  satisfy  the  eligibility  criteria \nand/or  that  the  agreed  procedures,  ADB  will  advise  the  EA  either  (a)  to  modify  the \nsubproject proposal in a manner that will make it eligible for approval or (b) that the \nsubproject  must  be  rejected.    If  a  subproject  is  rejected,  the  EA  may  propose  a \nreplacement subproject under the respective Loan.  \n\nf.  ADB will not approve any subproject, if all necessary approvals of the Government of \nIndia  and  the  J&K  State  have  not  been  obtained  prior  to  ADB  approval  of  a \nSubproject.  The  EA  will  be  responsible  for  obtaining  all  such  approvals  and  will \nprovide  ADB  with  a  report  showing  that  all  approvals  have  been  obtained  prior  to \nsubmission of subproject appraisal report.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n35\n\nSCHEDULE 5 \n\nSAFEGUARDS REQUIREMENTS  \nAND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT POLICIES \n \n \n\n1. \nIndia  will  ensure  that  all  the  requirements  prescribed  in  this  Schedule,  which  have  been \nprepared with respect to the Facility and of which ADB has been provided full copies, are complied \nwith during the processing and implementation of the Projects under the Facility \n \n2. \nPrior  to    the  preparation  of  each  PFR,  the  applicability  and  relevance  of  each  Safeguard \nframework  for  environmental  assessment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  people  will  be \nreviewed  and  updated  to  ensure  relevance  and  consistency  with  applicable  country  legal \nframeworks and ADB's safeguard policies, as amended from time to time. \n \n3. \nIn all cases, for each new PFR preparation, the Government will review on-going subprojects \nto  check  on  the  status  of  compliance  with  the  safeguards  plans  and  frameworks,  and  submit  the \nreview  reports  to  ADB,  together  with  other  required  safeguard  documents  relevant  to  the  Projects \nincluded  in  the  tranche  being  processed.  In  any  case  if  major  noncompliance  is  discovered  in  the \ncourse of the review of on-going subprojects, a corrective action plan will be prepared and submitted \nto ADB. \n \n4. \nprepared or provided under the Facility will apply to such Project. \n\nIn addition, all ADB Safeguards policies in effect as of the date the financing of a project is \n\nAll  the  subprojects  under  this  Facility  will  meet  all  environmental  and  social  safeguards \n5. \nrequirement of India, the State of Jammu and Kashmir, and ADB as narrated in the following three \nsafeguard framework: \n \n\n\u2022  Resettlement Framework; \n\u2022 \n\u2022  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework. \n\nIndigenous Peoples Development Plan Framework; and  \n\n \nResettlement  Framework.  This  Resettlement  Framework  has  been  prepared  to  set  out  the \n6. \nresettlement  policy  and  screening  and  planning  procedures  that  will  apply  to  subprojects, \ncomponents, or investments that are prepared and approved during loan implementation to ensure \nthat  they  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy.    The  Framework  identifies  the  broad \nscope  of  the  Investment  Program  and  outlines  the  policy,  procedures  for  acquisition  of  land, \ncompensation and other assistance measures for affected persons and institutional requirements for \npreparing subsequent sub-projects under the sector loan.  \n \n7. \nThe  Economic  Reconstruction  Agency  (ERA)  of  the  State  government  is  the  Executing \nAgency  (EA),  of  the  Investment  Program  and  will  be  responsible,  through  its  Project  Management \nUnits  (PMUs),  for  overall  strategic  guidance,  technical  supervision,  execution  of  the  Investment \nProgram,  and  ensuring  compliance  with  the  loan  covenants.  The  PMUs  will  be  responsible  for \npreparing  social  analysis  and  resettlement  plans  for  individual  subprojects,  including  updating   \nsubproject Resettlement Plans (RP) as per this framework and submit to ADB, through the PMU, for \nreview and approval prior to contract award for each subproject.  \n \n8. \nThe  resettlement  policies  that  apply  will  include  India\u2019s  National  Policy  on  Resettement  & \nRehabilitation,  J&K  State  Laws  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  requirements.  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\n \n\nResettlement  (1995)    will  guide  identification  of  impacts  and  plans    to  mitigate  various  losses  to \naffected people by the various subprojects. The key aspects of the Policy are summarized below: \n \n \n\n(i) \n\nInvoluntary resettlement (IR) should be avoided or reduced as much as possible by reviewing \nalternatives to the Project; \n\n(ii)  Where IR is unavoidable, AP should be assisted to re-establish themselves and improve their \n\nquality of life; \n\n(iii) \n\nAP should be fully involved in the selection of relocation sites, livelihood compensation and \ndevelopment  options  at  the  earliest  opportunity.  RPs  should  also  be  prepared  in  full \nconsultation with AP, including disclosure of RP and project related information; \n\n(iv)  Replacement  land  should  be  an  option  for  compensation  in  the  case  of  loss  of  land;  in  the \nabsence  of  replacement  land,  cash-for-land  compensation  should  be  an  option  available \neach AP; \n\n(v)  Compensation for loss of land, structures, other assets and income should be based on full \nreplacement cost and should be paid promptly. This should include transaction costs; \n\n(vi) \n\nAll  compensation  payments  and  related  activities  should  be  completed  prior  to  the \ncommencement of civil works; \n\n(vii)  RP should be planned and implemented with full participation of local authorities; \n\n(viii) \n\nIn  the  event  of  necessary  relocation,  APs  should  be  assisted  to  integrate  into  host \ncommunities; \n\n(ix)  Common property resources and community/public services should be provided to AP; \n\n(x)  Resettlement should be planned as a development activity for the AP; \n\n(xi) \n\nAP who do not have documented title to land should receive fair and just treatment; and \n\n(xii) \n\nVulnerable groups (households below the recognised poverty line; disabled, elderly persons \nor  female  headed  households)  should  be  identified  and  given  appropriate  assistance  to \nsubstantially improve their living standards. \n\n9. \nAll  affected  people  will  be  compensated  in  accordance  with  the  entitlement  matrix \nincorporated  in  the  agreed  Resettlement  Framework  prepared  for  the  Investment  Program \n(Attachment 1). \n \n10. \nby the PMUs in keeping with the following:  \n \n\nEach subproject will be prepared, and the detail design of each subproject will be undertaken \n\n(i)  Social impact assessment surveys including 100% Census survey of the affected people, an \nasset inventory, landownership, usage and productivity assessments and data on the existing \neconomic and social condition of the affected people including a poverty assessment and a \nsurvey  of  at  least  10%  of  the  affected  people  and  20%  of  the  seriously  affected  people, \ntogether with local-level impact data.  \n\n(ii)  If  impacts  are  found  to  be  \u201csignificant,  a  full  RP  will  be  prepared    for  each  subproject  for \n\napproval prior to award of contracts for that subproject; and  \n\n(iii) If subproject impacts are less than significant, a short RP  will be prepared for that subproject \n\nfor approval prior to award of contracts for that subproject.  \n\n\f \n\n37\n\n(iv) The  RP  would  also  include  measures  to  ensure  that  socio-economic  condition,  needs  and \npriorities  of  women  are  identified  and  that  the  process  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \ndoes not disadvantage women.   \n\n11. \nThe  RP  prepared  for  the  subproject  will  be  used  as  a  model  for  the  preparation  of \nsubsequent RPs.  The design team will include resettlement specialist familiar with ADB policy and \nprocedures.  \n \n12. \nThe  resettlement  framework  prepared  for  the  MFF  will  be  disclosed  and  made  available  in \nlocal language(s) during the public meetings at the community level.  Copies of draft RPs (prepared \nfor  the  subprojects)  will  be  made  available  at  the  local  level  public  offices  such  as  revenue  and \ndistrict offices to stakeholders for local inputs prior to award of civil work contract.  The summary of \nthe RP will be disclosed on ADB website and ERA website.  \n \n13. \nEach  RP  will  also  outline  a  detailed  procedure  for  community  complaint  and  grievance \nredressal.  All project related grievances will be redressed at the local level by Grievance Redressal \nCommittee  (GRC)  in  a  consultative  manner  with  the  full  participation  of  all  key  stakeholders.  The \nGRC shall comprise of members from the District Land and Revenue Department, representatives of \naffected people, including women and vulnerable groups.  Grievances will be redressed within two to \nfour weeks from the date of lodging the complaints.  All costs incurred in resolving the complaints will \nbe borne by the Project. \n \n14. \nDetailed budget estimates for each RP will be prepared by the PMU which will be included in \nthe  overall  project  estimate.  The  budget  shall  include:  (i)  detailed  costs  of  land  acquisition, \nrelocation,  and  livelihood  and  income  restoration  and  improvement;  (ii)  source  of  funding;  (iii) \nadministrative costs (iv) monitoring cost (v) cost of hiring consultants (vi) arrangement for approval, \nand the flow of funds and contingency arrangements. All land acquisition, compensation, relocation \nand rehabilitation, administrative, monitoring and consultant cost, income and livelihood restoration \ncost  will  be  considered  as  an  integral  component  of  project  costs.  All  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  costs  will  be  borne  by  the  State  who  will  ensure  timely  disbursement  of  funds  for  RP \nimplementation. \n \nThe  independent  agency/institution,  (that  may  include  established  and  registered  NGO(s)) \n15. \nassisting  in  preparation  and  implementation  of  a  RP,  will  submit  monthly  progress  report  of  RP \nimplementation to the resettlement officer of ERA through the respective PMUs. The PMU supported \nby independent agency/institution (that may include established and registered NGO(s)) will conduct \nregular internal monitoring of resettlement implementation and prepare quarterly progress reports for \nsubmission  to  ADB.  The  reports  will  contain  progress  made  in  RP  implementation  with  particular \nattention  to  compliance  with  the  principles  and  entitlement  matrix  set  out  in  the  resettlement  plan.  \nThe  report  will  also  document  consultation  activities  conducted,  provide  summary  of  issues  or \nproblems identified and actions taken to resolve the issues, and provide summary of grievances or \ncomplaints  lodged  by  households  and  actions  taken  to  redress  such  complaints.  An  independent \nagency/institution  independent  (that  may  include  established  and  registered  NGO(s))  will  be \nengaged  by  the  PMU  in  agreement  with  ADB  to  undertake  biannual  external  monitoring  of  the \nproject implementation.  This expert will submit its reports biannually directly to ADB.   \n \n16. \nIndigenous  Peoples.  Since  the  MFF  is  mainly  concentrated  in  the  cities  of  Jammu  and \nSrinagar, a very limited presence of IP households was noted in the socio-economic survey (SES) \nundertaken  during  the  course  of  initial  poverty  and  social  analysis.  No  adverse  impacts  of  the \nsubprojects have been identified on the IP households in any of the subprojects.  It would also be \nworthwhile  to  note  that  the  IP  households  were  positive  about  the  subproject  and  did  not  feel  that \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\n \n\nthey will encounter any adverse socio-cultural or economic impacts as a result of the MFF. The key \nbenefits  envisaged  out  of  the  MFF  mainly  comprise  of  a  sustained  improvements  in  basic  service \nprovision within the cities of Jammu and Srinagar.  Indirect benefits will be available in the form of \nimproved living conditions, a healthier living environment and the prospect of improved health status \nof the population plus an improved economic climate with employment opportunities. However, in the \nevent  of  impacts  on  indigenous  people,  an  Indigenous  Peoples  Development  Plan  (IPDP)  will  be \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  People  and  in  line  with  the  agreed \nIndigenous People\u2019s Development Framework (IPDF) (Attachment 2). \n \n17. \nEnvironmental  Assessment  and  Review  Framework.  The  Environmental  Assessment  and \nReview  Framework  (EARF)  (Attachment  3)  of  JKUSDP  aims  at  (i)  determining  the  anticipated \nenvironmental  impacts  arising  from  subproject  implementation  based  on  an  examination  of  four   \nsubprojects  in  Jammu  and  Srinagar;  (ii)  identifying  environmental  mitigation  measures  and \nenvironmental monitoring plans required to address anticipated negative environmental impacts; (iii) \nproviding  formats  and  guidelines  for  selecting  future  subprojects  based  on  environmental  eligibility \ncriteria and conducting environmental examinations; and (iv) defining the Environmental Assessment \nand Review Framework for future subprojects proposed under JKUSDIP. \n \n18. \nThough the proposed JKUSDP aims to improve the environmental quality of the urban areas, \nthe  development  of  infrastructure  facilities  may  potentially  cause  certain  negative  environmental \nimpacts.  The  implementation  of  subprojects  can  have  adverse  impacts  on  various  environmental \naspects  namely:  (i)  topography  and  drainage;  (ii)  soil  and  land  use;  (iii)  surface  water;  (iv) \ngroundwater resources; (v) ambient air quality; (vi) noise levels; (vii) biotic environment; (viii) cultural \nand historic sites; and (ix) other socio-economic impacts.  These impacts may arise in the project life \ncycle  either  during  implementation  and/or  during  operation  phase  and  in  limited  cases,  may  also \narise  after  end  of  operation  period.    The  potential  environmental  impacts  are  categorized  into  (i) \nlocation  impacts;  (ii)  design  impacts;  (iii)  construction  impacts;  and  (iv)  operation  and  maintenance \nimpacts. \n \n19. \nThe  SIEE  and  IEEs  conducted  for  the  subprojects  reveal  that  these  typical  urban \ninfrastructure  projects,  owing  to  their  scale  and  magnitude  of  activities  coupled  with  the \nenvironmental  setting  of  the  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  are  unlikely  to  have  any  significant  adverse \nenvironmental impacts, except for the subprojects under MSW management component.  Based on \nthe IEEs of the   subprojects, all the   subprojects identified in Jammu and Srinagar under JKUSDP, \nexcept  the  MSW  management  facility  at  Srinagar,  have  been  categorised  as  Category  \u2018B\u2019.    The \nMSW management facility at Srinagar is categorised as \u2018B Sensitive.  The JKUSDP is classified as \nenvironmental category \u2018B Sensitive\u2019  in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy 2002.   \n \n20. \nERA is responsible as through the PMU for (i) preparing a rapid environmental assessment \n(REA), an initial environmental examination (IEE) and a summary IEE (SIEE) of eligible subprojects; \n(ii) implementing the environmental management plan (EMP) and environmental monitoring plan as \nstipulated in the IEE; and (iii) maintaining records of all documents related to environmental aspects \nof subprojects for disclosure by the PMUs, and (iv) supervising the PMUs for the implementation of \nenvironmental  management  and  monitoring  plans.  ERA  will  ensure  that  subprojects  are  properly \nselected. ADB will review and conform the environmental classification. if any of the follow-on sub-\nprojects is classified to be of environment category A, then the environment category of the Project \nis re-categorized to the environment category A, prior to approval of such follow-on sub-project. ERA \nwill further ensure that (i) environmental assessments for subprojects are conducted in line with the \nrequirements of ADB, and that of national, state and local statutory environmental regulations; and \n(ii) the environmental management and monitoring plans are appropriately implemented \n \n\n\f \n\n39\n\nERA is responsible for ensuring that all environmental assessment documentation, including \n21. \nmonitoring the implementation of EMPs, and environmental monitoring plans shall be systematically \ndocumented.  The environmental assessment documents are subject to public disclosure and shall \nbe made available, if required. ERA shall ensure that in carrying out an IEE for any subproject under \nJKUSDP,  at  least  one  step  consultation  with  the  affected  people,  will  be  done  to  gather  their \nconcerns about the subproject, particularly in respect of its potential impacts. If an EIA is required, \nERA  shall  ensure  that  two  step  consultations  with  affected  people  are  undertaken.  The  first \nconsultation  aims  to  gather  their  concerns  about  the  subprojects,  particularly  in  respect  of  its \npotential impacts.  The second consultation aims to share the EMP with affected people and gather \ntheir views on the EMP.  \n \n22. \nThe safeguard requirements for each financing tranche, as well as the categorization of each \nloan for environmental impact purposes, will follow the approach and procedure defined in existing \nADB Safeguard Polices. For any subproject other than the four appraised subprojects under the first \nloan, categorized as A or B Sensitive, the respective SEIA  or SIEE must be circulated to the ADB \nBoard and made available to the general public 120 days before approval of this subproject. If any of \nthe investments or subprojects in any subsequent loan requires compliance with the same 120-day \nadvance disclosure rule, the SEIA or SIEE must be circulated to the ADB Board and made available \nto the general public 120 days before a PFR is submitted to ADB. Environmental assessment reports \nfor ADB projects will be accessible to interested parties and the general public. The SIEE and SEIA \nreports  are  required  to  be  circulated  worldwide,  through  the  depository  library  system  and  on  the \nADB website. The full EIA or IEE reports are also made available to interested parties on request. \n \n23. \nAn Environmental Monitoring Plan will be prepared for each subproject.  The monitoring plan \npresents  the  recommended  environmental  monitoring  activities  which  indicate  the  effectiveness  of \nthe  EMP  in  mitigating  negative  impacts  identified  in  the  IEE.    The  plan  will  also  identify  the \nagencies/institutions  that  are  responsible  for  monitoring.  ERA  will  submit  to  ADB  semiannual \nprogress reports on the implementation of the EMPs and the environmental monitoring carried out as \na regular part of project implementation.  The environmental monitoring report will be made available \nto  the  public  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2005).    The  ERA  has  the \noverall  responsibility  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  EMP,  including  the  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures for all subprojects under JKUSDP.   \n \n24. \nERA will with the help of the consultants, review the IEEs/EIAs and corresponding EMPs to \nensure  that  the  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  plan  proposed  are  adequate  and  conform  to \nADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguard policies. ERA will provide ADB with access to information \non any subproject, as needed.  The information on the implementation of the EMP, as well as that on \nthe environmental safeguard compliance will be systematically documented and reported to ADB as \na  part  of  the  quarterly  reports  containing  a  section  on  the  implementation  of  the  EMP  and \nenvironmental monitoring plan. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\n \n\n \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n\nAttachment 1 \n\nin  physical \n\nfor  capacity  building  and \n\nDescription of the Project   \n\ninfrastructure  plus  proposals \n\nA. \n \n1. \nJammu  and  Kashmir  Urban  Sector  Development  Investment  Program  (JKUSDIP)  is  under \npreparation  as  a  sector  loan  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  for  improving  infrastructure  and \nmunicipal services in two municipal corporations of Jammu and Srinagar cities and selected tourist \ncentres1  and  other  important  towns,  within  Jammu  and  Kashmir  State.  The  Project  will  include \ninvestment \ninstitutional \nstrengthening of city and state authorities. \n \n2. \nIn order to prepare and process the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s procedures for sector \nlending, a set of four subprojects have been selected one each in each of the four major urban sub-\nsectors  namely  \u2013  Water  Supply,  Sewerage,  Solid  Waste  Management  and  Urban  Transport  in  the \ntwo cities of Jammu and Srinagar. In keeping with ADB\u2019s sector loan procedures; this resettlement \nframework  has  been  prepared  to  set  out  the  resettlement  policy  and  screening  and  planning \nprocedures  that  will  apply  to  subprojects,  components,  or  investments  that  are  prepared  and \napproved during loan implementation to ensure that they conform to ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy.  The  Framework  thus,  identifies  the  broad  scope  of  the  project  and  outlines  the  policy, \nprocedures  for  acquisition  of  land,  compensation  and  other  assistance  measures  for  affected \npersons and institutional requirements for preparing subsequent sub-projects under the sector loan.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe resettlement principles adopted in this framework recognize the State Land Acquisition \n(LA) Act 1990 and the entitlement benefits as listed in the National Policy on R&R, (Govt of India) as \nnotified in February 2004 and the relevant Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) policies and operations \nmanuals, in particular the Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and Operations Manual F2 on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (2003).  \n \n4. \nFollowing  the  state  laws  and  regulation  on  land  acquisition  and  incorporating  ADB  policies \nand operations manuals as well as the National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation (NPRR), \nthe  basic  principles  for  the  Project  will  include  the  following  elements  with  respect  to  each \nsubproject:  \n \n\nResettlement Policy and Framework \n\na)  As  a  matter  of  policy,  land  acquisition,  and  other  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  would  be \n\nminimized as much as possible; \n\nb)  Any  land  acquisition  and/or  resettlement  will  be  carried  out  and  compensation  provided  in \norder to improve or at least restore the pre-Project income and living standards of the affected \npeople; \n\nc)  Consultation  with  affected  people  on  compensation  options  and  preparation  Resettlement \n\nPlan (RP) in accordance with this Framework; \n\nd)  Payment of compensation for acquired assets at market/replacement rates; \n\n                                                 \n1 The towns initially selected for consideration are Patnitop (Jammu region), Gulmarg, Pahalgam and Sonamarg (Kashmir \n\nregion). \n\n\f \n\n41\n\ne)  Payment  of  compensation  for  lost  land,  housing,  assets  and  resettlement  allowances  in  full \nprior to the contractor taking physical acquisition of the land and prior to  the commencement \nof any construction activities; \n\nf)  All compensation and other assistances2 will be paid to all APs prior to commencement of civil \n\nworks.  \n\ng)  Income restoration and rehabilitation; \nh)  An entitlement matrix (Table-1) for different categories of people affected by the project has \nbeen prepared and provisions will be kept in the budget for those who were not present at the \ntime of census survey. However, people moving in the project area after the cut-off date will \nnot  be  entitled  to  any  assistance.  In  case  of  land  acquisition  the  date  of  notification  for \nacquisition  will  be  treated  as  cut-off  date.  For  non-titleholders  such  as  squatters  and \nencroachers  the  date  of  project  census  survey  or  a  similar designated date  declared  by  the \nexecuting agency will be considered as cut-off date. \"  and \n\nProcedures for Resettlement Plan (RP) Preparation \n\ni)  Special attention to vulnerable groups. \n\n \nC. \n \n5. \nby the PMUs in keeping with the following:  \n \n\nEach subproject will be prepared, and the detail design of each subproject will be undertaken \n\na)  Social impact assessment surveys including 100% Census survey of the affected people, an \nasset  inventory,  landownership,  usage  and  productivity  assessments  and  data  on  the \nexisting  economic  and  social  condition  of  the  affected  people  including  a  poverty \nassessment  and  a  survey  of  atleast  10%  of  the  affected  people  and  20%  of  the  seriously \naffected people, together with local-level impact data;  \n\nb)  If  impacts  are  found  to  be  \u201csignificant,\u201d3  a  full  RP  will  be  prepared    for  each  subproject  for \n\napproval prior to award of contracts for that subproject;   \n\nc)  If subproject impacts are less than significant, a short RP will be prepared for that subproject \n\nfor approval prior to award of contracts for that subproject; and  \n\nd)  The  RP  would  also  include  measures  to  ensure  that  socio-economic  condition,  needs  and \npriorities  of women  are  identified  and  that  the  process  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \ndoes not disadvantage women.   \n\n \n6. \nThe  RP  prepared  for  the  subproject  will  be  used  as  a  model  for  the  preparation  of \nsubsequent  RPs.  The  RPs  shall  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  other \nsocial safeguard guidelines. The additional full or short RPs will be disclosed to the APs, endorsed \nby  the  EA  and  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  prior  to  award  of  civil  works  contracts  for  a \nsubproject. The full RP, not just the summary will be disclosed to the APs as well as uploaded on the \nADB website after ADB review and approval. In case impacts on Indigenous People are identified, \n\n                                                 \n2  While  compensation  is  required  prior  to  dispossession  or  displacement  of  affected  people  from  their  assets,  the  full \nresettlement  plan  implementation,  which  may  require  income  rehabilitation  measures,  might  be  completed  only  over  a \nlonger period of time after civil works have begun. Affected people will be provided with certain resettlement entitlements, \nsuch  as  land  and  asset  compensation  and  transfer  allowances,  prior  to  their  displacement,  dispossession,  or  restricted \naccess. \n3  Source: Asian Development Bank Operations Manual \u2013Operational Procedure on Involuntary Resettlement  \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Category  A:  Significant  means  200  or  more  people  will  experience  major  impacts,  which  are \ndefined  as  (i)  being  physically  displaced  from  housing,  or  (ii)  losing  10%  or  more  of  their  productive  assets  (income \ngenerating).  Categories  A  projects  require  a  full  resettlement  plan.  Some  of  these  projects  may  require  a  resettlement \nframework  prior  to  the  full  resettlement  plan.  Involuntary  Resettlement  Category  B:  Not  Significant  include  involuntary \nresettlement  impacts  that  are  not  deemed  significant  and  require  a  short  resettlement  plan.

In determining the \nreplacement  value  of  land  the  HPC  will  (i)  appraise  recent  sales  and  transfer  of  title  deeds  and \nregistration certificates  for  land  in  subproject  area  and  (ii) determine  whether  the  rates  established \nfor the Project are sufficient to purchase the same quality and quantity of land based on compilation \nof appraised rates.  \n \nF.  \n \n12. \nEach of the subprojects RP will be prepared and implemented in close consultation with the \nstakeholders  and  will  involve  focus  group  discussion  (FGD)  and  meetings,  particularly  with  those \naffected  by  the  Project  intervention.  In  addition,  a  Public  Consultation  and  Disclosure  Plan  will  be \nprepared for each of the subproject. This Framework  will be disclosed and made available in local \nlanguage(s)  during  the public  meetings  at  the  community  level.    Copies  of  draft  RPs  (prepared  for \nthe subprojects) will be made available at the local level public offices such as revenue and district \noffices to stakeholders for local inputs prior to award of civil work contract.  The full/short RP will be \ndisclosed on ADB website and ERA website10.  \n \nEach  RP  will  also  outline  a  detailed  procedure  for  community  complaint  and  grievance \n13. \nredressal.  All project related grievances will be redressed at the local level by Grievance Redressal \nCommittee (GRC) in a consultative manner with the full participation of all key stakeholders.   \n \nG. \n \n14. \nDetailed budget estimates for each RP will be prepared by the PMU which will be included in \nthe  overall  project  estimate.

The  tourist  centres  and  other  important  towns  initially \nselected for consideration are Patnitop (Jammu region), Gulmarg, Pahalgam and Sonmarg (Kashmir \nregion).    The  project  will  include  investment  in  physical  infrastructure  plus  proposals  for  capacity \nbuilding and institutional strengthening of city and state authorities. \n\n2. \nIn accordance with ADB\u2019s procedure for sector lending, a set of four sample subprojects have \nbeen selected in the two Project cities of Srinagar & Jammu for project preparation and processing \nin  each  of  the  four  major  urban  sub-sectors  namely  \u2013  Water  Supply,  Sewerage,  Solid  Waste \nManagement, and Urban Transport.  Out of these four sample subprojects, two sample subprojects \nhave been selected in Jammu city and two sample subprojects in Srinagar City. \n\n3. \nSince the Project is mainly concentrated in the cities of Jammu and Srinagar, a very limited \npresence  of  IP  households  was  noted  in  the  socio-economic  survey  (SES)  undertaken  during  the \ncourse  of  initial  poverty  and  social  analysis.  No  adverse  impacts  of  the  subprojects  have  been \nidentified on the IP households in any of the sample subprojects.  It would also be worthwhile to note \nthat the IP households were positive about the subproject and did not feel that they will encounter \nany  adverse  socio-cultural  or  economic  impacts  as  a  result  of  the  Project.  The  key  benefits \nenvisaged out of the Project mainly comprise of a sustained improvements in basic service provision \nwithin the cities of Jammu and Srinagar and other important towns.  Indirect benefits will be available \nin the form of improved living conditions, a healthier living environment and the prospect of improved \nhealth status of the population plus an improved economic climate with employment opportunities.  \n\nNonetheless, this Indigenous Peoples Development Framework (IPDF) is intended to guide \n4. \nselection and preparation of additional subprojects under the Project where impacts on tribal people \nare  identified  to  ensure  better  distribution  of  the  Project  benefits  and  promote  development  of  the \nindigenous  peoples  in  the  Project  areas.    The  framework  is  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nprocedures for sector loans as presented in ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \nB. \n\nIndigenous/Tribal Groups \n\nThe terms \u2018indigenous peoples\u2019, indigenous ethnic minorities\u2019, tribal groups,\u2019 and \u2018scheduled \n5. \ntribes\u2019 describe social groups with a social and cultural identity distinct from the dominant society that \nmakes them vulnerable to being disadvantaged in the development process.  By definition, IP refers \nto peoples living in an area within a nation-state, prior to the formation of a nation-state, but who do \nnot  identify  with  the  dominant  nation.    This  group  has  social,  cultural,  economic,  and  political \ntraditions and institutions distinct from the mainstream or dominant society and culture.   \n\n6. \nADB  uses  the  following  characteristics  to  define  indigenous  people:  (i)  descent  from \npopulation groups present in a given area before territories were defined; (ii) maintenance of cultural \nand  social  identities  separate  from  dominant  societies  and  cultures;  (iii)  self  identification  and \nidentification by others as being part of a distinct cultural group; (iv) linguistic identity different from \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\n \n\nthat of dominant society; (v) social, cultural, economic and political traditions and institutions distinct \nfrom dominant culture; (vi) economic systems oriented more towards traditional production systems \nrather  than  mainstream;  and  (vii)  unique  ties  and  attachments  to  traditional  habitats  and  ancestral \nterritories.  Essentially,  indigenous  people  have  a  social  and  cultural  identity  distinct  from  the \nmainstream society that makes them vulnerable to being overlooked in development processes. \n \nC. \n\nIndigenous Peoples Development Framework Objectives \n\nThe  Indigenous  Peoples  Development  Framework  seeks  to  ensure  that  indigenous  people \n9. \nand  tribal  communities  are  informed,  consulted  and  mobilized  to  participate  in  the  subproject \npreparation. The Framework is intended to guide selection and preparation of additional subprojects \nunder  the  Project  where  impacts  on  tribal  people  are  identified  to  ensure  better  distribution  of  the \nProject  benefits  and  promote  development  of  the  indigenous  peoples  in  the  Project  areas.    The \nframework is prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s procedures for sector loans as presented in ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n\n \nD. \n\nIPDP Policy Framework \n\n10. \nADB's Policy on Indigenous People (IPs) aims to protect ethnic minorities from the adverse \nimpact of development, and to ensure that ethnic minorities benefit from development projects and \nprograms.  The need for a full IPDP will depend on the nature and magnitude of the Project impacts \nand sensitivity of IP issues.  The need for the IPDP will be established on the basis of the following \ncriteria set out in ADB\u2019s Policy on IP, to determine if project impacts are \u2018significant\u2019:  \n\n(i) adverse impacts on customary rights of use and access to land & natural resources;  \n\n(ii) negative impacts on socio-economic status and cultural identity;  \n\n(iii) impacts on health, education, livelihood and social security status; and \n\n(iv)  any  other  impacts  that  may  alter  or  undermine  indigenous  knowledge  and  customary \ninstitutions.  \n\n11. \nThe  IPDP  will  ensure  that  project  affected  IPs  are,  as  well  off  with  the  project  as  without  it \nafter the implementation of the plan. This plan will also aim to identify measures towards satisfying \nthe needs and developmental aspirations of IPs. \n\nIf,  the  impacts  on  IP\u2019s  are  insignificant11,  then  specific  actions  in  favour  of  the  indigenous \n12. \npeople will need to be integrated in the Resettlement Plan for the subprojects or a community / tribal \ndevelopment plan. This would ensure appropriate mitigations and benefits for the indigenous people.  \n\nBased on both India\u2019s legal, constitutional and developmental strategies and ADB\u2019s policy on \n\n13. \nindigenous people, the objectives of an IPDP will be as follows: \n\n(i)  Ensure that tribal/ST people affected by any subproject will benefit from the subproject;  \n\n                                                 \n11  Impacts  are  insignificant  when  the  fewer  than  100  Indigenous  People  are  affected,  a  full  Indigenous  Peoples \nDevelopment Plan (IPDP) is not required but impacts and mitigation measures can be dealt through the RP. Impacts are \nconsidered  to  be  \u2018significant\u2019  when  more  than  100  Indigenous  People  are  affected  by  the  Project  thereby  requiring  a \nseparate IPDP.   \n\n\f \n\n51\n\n(ii) Ensure tribal inclusion in the entire process of planning, implementation and monitoring of \nthe subproject;  \n\n(iii) Ensure that the benefits of the subprojects are available to STs/SCs more than or at least \nat  par  with  other  affected  groups;  this  may  require  giving  preference  to  tribal  people  as \nvulnerable groups over others on certain benefits under the subprojects; and \n\n(iv) Provide a base for the tribal groups in the area to receive adequate development focus \nand attention. \n\n \nE. \n\nProcedure for Preparing an IPDP \n\n14. \n\nIn order to prepare an IPDP the following steps will be undertaken: \n\n(i)  Based  on  the  social  assessment,  establish  baseline  data  on  the  tribal  people  \n(subsistence,  employment,  community  networks)  affected  by  the  project  (use  the  criteria  in \nthe section above to determine project impacts); \n\n(ii) Review policy guidelines both at national and state level regarding STs; \n\n(iii)  If  the  impacts  are  considered  significant  as  defined  above,  prepare  an  IPDP  based  on \nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous People; \n\n(iv) Submit IPDP to ADB for review and approval. \n\n \n15. \nAs  enumerated  above,  the  main  features  of  the  IPDP  will  thus  comprise  of  a  preliminary \nscreening process, followed by a social impact assessment to determine the degree and nature of \nimpact of each subproject, and an action plan will be developed if warranted.  Each of these steps \nhave been further elucidated in the sections below: \n\n1.  \n\nScreening \n\n16. \nThe  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU)  and  Design  &  Supervision  Consultants  (DSC) \nresponsible  for  subproject  preparation  and  implementation  will  visit  all  tribal  settlements  near  the \nsubproject  areas  or  in  likelihood  of  being  affected  and  influenced  by  the  subproject  components.  \nPublic  meetings  will  be  arranged  in  selected  tribal  communities  by  the  PMU  and  DSC  to  provide \nthem information about the subproject and take their views on the subproject. \n\n17. \nDuring this visit, the social specialist of the DSC and PMU will undertake a screening of the \ntribal  communities  with the  help  of  the  community  leaders  and  local  authorities.  The  screening  will \ncover the following aspects: \n\n(i)  Name(s) of tribal community group(s) in the area; \n\n(ii) Total number of tribal community groups in the area; \n\n(iii) Percentage of tribal community population to that of total area/locality population; \n\n(iv) Number and percentage of tribal community households along the zone of influence of \nthe proposed subproject. \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\n \n\nIf the results of the screening bring forth the presence of tribal community households in the \n18. \nzone of influence of the proposed subproject, a social impact assessment will be planned for those \nareas. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Impact Assessment \n\n19. \nThe  DSC  and  PMU  will  undertake  a  social  impact  assessment  (SIA).    The  SIA  will  gather \nrelevant  information  on  demographic  data;  social,  cultural  and  economic  situation;  and  social, \ncultural  and  economic  impacts  \u2013  positive  and  negative  on  the  tribal  communities  in  the  subproject \narea. \n\n20. \nInformation  will  be  gathered  from  separate  group  meetings  within  the  tribal  community, \nincluding  tribal  leaders;  group  of  tribal  men  and  women,  especially  those  who  live  in  the  zone  of \ninfluence of the proposed subproject under the Project.  Discussions will focus on the positive and \nnegative  impacts  of  the  subproject  as  well  as  recommendations  on  the  design  of  the  subproject.  \nThe  PMU  and  the  DSC  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  the  SIA  and  based  on  it  developing  an \naction  plan  with  the  tribal  community  leaders.    If  the  SIA  indicates  that  the  potential  impact  of  the \nproposed  Project  will  be  significantly  adverse  threatening  the  cultural  practices  and their  source  of \nlivelihood, the PMU and DSC will consider other design options to minimize such adverse impacts \nand will prepare an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP). \n \n\n3.  \n\nIndigenous People Development Plan \n\n21. \nIPDP will consist of a number of activities and will include mitigation measures of potentially \nnegative  impacts  by  means  of  modification  of  subproject  design  and  development  assistance.  \nWhere there is land acquisition in tribal communities, the Project will ensure that their rights will not \nbe violated and that they will be compensated for the use of any part of their land in a manner that is \nculturally  acceptable  to  them.  The  compensation  will  be  in  keeping  with  Entitlement  Matrix  as \nprovided in the Resettlement Framework of the Project.  The IPDP will include: \n\n(i) Baseline data; \n(ii) Land tenure information; \n(iii) Local participation; \n(iv)Technical identification of development or mitigation activities; \n(v) Institutional arrangement; \n(vi) Implementation schedule; \n(vii) Monitoring and evaluation; and \n(viii) Cost estimate and financing plan. \n\nConsultation & Disclosure  \n\n22. \nThe PMU will submit the IPDP through the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to ADB for review \nand  approval  prior  to  the  selection  of  specific  subprojects.    The  IPDP  policy  and  measures  must \ncomply with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. \n \nF. \n \n23. \nThe  tribal  groups/IP  will  be  consulted  during  the  preparation  of  the  IPDP.    They  will  be \ninformed of the mitigation measures proposed and their views will be taken into account in finalizing \nthe  plan.    The  Plan  will  be  translated  into  the  tribal  language  and  made  available  to  the  affected \npeople before implementation. The disclosure will be in a manner accessible to APs where there are \ndiffering levels of literacy skills.  \n\n\f \n\n53\n\nThe  tribal  institutions  and  organizations  in  the  affected  area  will  also  be  involved  in \n\n24. \nimplementing the IPDP and in resolving any disputes that may arise.  \n \nG. \n\nInstitutional Framework and Budget \n\n25. \nERA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Project  which  will  have  two  Project \nManagement  Units  (PMU)  headed  by  a  Regional  Director  each  in  the  city  of  Jammu  &  Srinagar, \nreporting to the CEO. The PMU will have the primary responsibility for the preparation of the IPDP \nsupported by DSC.  The responsibility of financing, implementation and monitoring of the IPDP will \nrest  with  the  EA.    A  local  NGO/institution  with  the  relevant  experience  will  be  hired  to  assist  the \nPMUs  in  planning  and  implementing  the  IPDP.    The    independent  agency/institution  (that  may \ninclude  established  and  registered  NGO(s))will  be  fully  oriented  on  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous \nPeople. \n\n \nH. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n26. \nThe  PMU  will  set  up  an  internal  monitoring  system  comprising  Social  Development  & \nResettlement Specialist, independent agency/institution (that may include established and registered \nNGO(s)),  tribal  people/IP  and  their  institutions  to  monitor  the  plan  implementation.    Monitoring \nindicators  will  be  established.  In  addition,  an  external  independent  monitoring  agency  will  be \nengaged by the EA with ADB concurrence to undertake independent external monitoring of the Plan.  \nReporting / monitoring formats will be prepared for both internal and external monitoring. \n \n27. \nfinal approval. \n \n \n\nAny IPDPs prepared under this Project will be endorsed by the EA before sending to ADB for \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\n \n\n \n\nAttachment 3 \n\nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND REVIEW FRAMEWORK \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  preparing  the  Jammu  and  Kashmir  Urban  Sector \nDevelopment  Project  (JKUSDP)  as  a  sector  loan  with  multitranche  financing  facility.  The  summary \ninitial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  for  JKUSDP  has  been  completed.  Due  consideration  has \nbeen given  to ADB\u2019s Environment  Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment  Guidelines (EAG) \n(2003),  Indian  national,  state  and  local  environmental  laws,  and  lessons  learned  during  the \nimplementation of the ongoing Loan 2151-IND: Multisector Project for Infrastructure Rehabilitation in \nJammu and Kashmir12 and the preparation of initial environmental examination (IEE) reports for the \nsample subprojects.  \n \n2. \nThis  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  of  JKUSDP  aims  at  (i) \ndetermining the anticipated environmental impacts arising from the follow-on subprojects based on \nthe  IEE  reports  of  four  sample  subprojects  in  Jammu  and  Srinagar,  (ii)  identifying  environmental \nmitigation  measures  and  environmental  monitoring  plans  required  to  address  anticipated  negative \nenvironmental  impacts,  (iii)  providing  formats  and  guidelines  for  selecting  follow-on  subprojects \nbased  on  environmental  eligibility  criteria  and  conducting  environmental  assessments,  and  (iv) \ndefining the environmental assessment review procedures for future follow-on subprojects proposed \nunder JKUSDP. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe proposed Project is primarily designed to promote economic development in the cities of \nJammu  and  Srinagar  and  selected  towns  of  the  state  of  Jammu  and  Kashmir  through  urban \ninfrastructure  provision,  focusing  on  water  supply,  sewerage,  municipal  solid  waste  (MSW) \nmanagement,  and  urban  transport.  The  specific  objectives  of  the  JKUSDP  are  to  (i)  improve  the \nenvironmental conditions of the cities and other important towns of the state of Jammu and Kashmir; \n(ii)  reduce  poverty  in  low-income  areas  by  improving  access  to  basic  urban  services;  and  (iii) \nimprove  the  service-delivery  capacities  of  the  cities  and  other  important  towns  through  institutional \ndevelopment.  In  view  of  the  lack  of  basic  infrastructure  facilities  and  their  adverse  impacts  on  the \nenvironment  and  socioeconomic  characteristics, \nto  provide \ninfrastructure  facilities\u2014such  as  adequate  and  safe  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities\u2014that  will \ndirectly  benefit  a  considerable  population.  The  primary  project  beneficiaries  are  expected  to \ncomprise lower income and poor households. JKUSDP is designed to complement ADB\u2019s ongoing \nMultisector Project for Infrastructure Rehabilitation in Jammu and Kashmir. \n \n4. \n \n\nJKUSDP comprises the following components: \n\nthe  proposed  JKUSDP  aims \n\nOverview of the JKUSDP \n\n(i) \n\nWater Supply. This component's main activities are: (i) rehabilitation of existing head \nworks; (ii) improving transmission and distribution system (mains and reservoirs), and \nprovision  of  new  infrastructure;  (iii)  building  reservoirs;  and  (iv)  installing  distribution \nsystem (including metered house service connections); \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2004.

Manila  (Loan  2151-IND,  for  $250  million, \napproved on 21 December). \n\n\f \n\n55\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nSewerage  and  sanitation.  This  component's  main  activities  are:  (i)  rehabilitation  of \nexisting sewer networks, (ii) rehabilitation of sewage pumping stations; (iii) expansion \nof  existing  sewerage  networks,  collection  systems,  and  treatment  plants,  and \nconstruction  of  new  ones;  and  (iv)  rehabilitation  of  community  and  public  sanitation \nfacilities; \n\nSolid Waste Management. This component will focus on improving integrated solid \nwaste collection systems, storage and transfer stations, transportation, treatment, and \ndisposal  systems;  engineered  landfills  with  efficient  drainage  systems  and  leachate \ncollection and treatment facilities will be built; and \n\nUrban Transport. This component will focus on improving: (i) urban roads; (ii) critical \nroad  links;  (iii)  traffic  management;  (iv)  street  lighting;  (vi)  road  safety;  and  (vii) \nflyovers, grade separators,  underpasses,and pedestrian subways. \n\n5. \nThe four sample subprojects chosen for the JKUSDP correspond to the above four sectors. \nThe  sample  subprojects  are:  (i)  Sindh  canal  raw  water  pipeline  at  Srinagar;  (ii)  sewerage  and \nsewage  treatment  system  for  Jammu;  (iii)  municipal  solid  waste  treatment  and  disposal  facility  for \nSrinagar; and (iv) improvement of the Banihal Cart (BC) Road and construction of new vehicle cum \npedestrian subway and grade separator at the Rehari Chowk junction  in Jammu.   \n \n6. \nPotential  Environmental  Impacts.  Though  the  proposed  JKUSDP  aims  to  improve  the \nenvironmental  quality  of  urban  areas,  the  development  of  infrastructure  facilities  may  potentially \ncause certain negative environmental impacts. The implementation of subprojects can have adverse \nimpacts  on  various  environmental  aspects,  namely:  (i)  topography  and  drainage,  (ii)  soil  and  land \nuse, (iii) surface water, (iv) groundwater resources, (v) ambient air quality, (vi) noise levels, (vii) biotic \nenvironment,  (viii)  cultural  and  historic  sites,  and  (ix)  other  socioeconomic  impacts.  These  impacts \nmay arise in the project lifecycle during implementation and/or during operation phase, and in limited \ncases may also arise after the end of the operation period. The potential environmental impacts are \ncategorized into (i) location impacts, (ii) design impacts, (iii) construction impacts, and (iv) operation \nand maintenance impacts.  \n \n7. \ncomponents is summarized below: \n\nAn  illustrative  list  of  potential  negative  environmental  impacts  resulting  from  the  proposed \n\n \n\n \n\n(i)  Water Supply. The anticipated environmental  impacts comprise: (a)  high noise levels \nfrom  the  operation  of  pumping  stations;  (b)  pollution  and  health  risks  resulting  from \nimproper handling and/or disposal of sludge from water treatment plants; (c) blocking of \nroads during laying of the distribution network; and (d) dust from construction activities, \nwhich  could  be  considerable  because  of  the  dry  climatic  conditions;  (e)  recurrence  of \nleakage problems; \n\n(ii)  Sewerage.  The  anticipated  environmental  impacts  comprise:  (a)  contamination  of \ngroundwater  resources,  (b)  loss  of  amenity  and  odor  nuisance  to  neighbors,  (c) \npollution of agricultural fields, groundwater, or surface water caused by partially treated \nsewage,  (d)  nuisance  and  pollution  of  groundwater  and  surface  water  caused  by \noverflowing of sewers, (e) nuisance caused by mosquito breeding and bad odors from \nsewage  treatment  plants  and  overflowing  sewers,  (f)  pollution  and  health  hazards \nresulting  from  improper  sludge  disposal  methods,  (g)  dust  and  noise  nuisance  and \nblocking  of  roads  during  laying  of  the  sewer  network,  and  (h)  increased  traffic  flow \nresulting from vehicle movement associated with construction activities; \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii)  Municipal  Solid  Waste  Management.  The  anticipated  environmental \n\nimpacts \ncomprise: (a) nuisance to surrounding areas; (b) groundwater contamination caused by \nrunoff  from  landfill  areas;  (c)  nuisance  resulting  from  location  of  waste  collection \ncontainers;  (d)  waste  mixing  with  monsoon  or  storm-water  runoff  creating  potentially \nunhygienic  conditions  around  the  sites;  (e)  contamination  of  groundwater  by  leachate \nfrom  landfills;  (f)  impact  of  methane  gas  emissions  from  landfills;  (g)  pollution  of \nagricultural  lands  and  entering  of  traces  into  food  chain  as  a  result  of  application  of \ncompost  containing  heavy  metals;  (h)  bird  menace  at  the  waste  disposal  facilities;  (i) \ndust nuisance and nuisance caused by spillage of waste-collection residue and waste \nduring  transportation;  and  (j)  health  and  safety  hazards  to  workers  during  waste \ncollection, transportation, and at compost and disposal sites; and \n\n \n(iv)  Urban  transport.  The  anticipated  environmental  impacts  comprise:  (a)  loss  of \nhousehold  residences  and  business  premises;  (b)  encroachment  on  wetlands;  (c) \ndisruption  of  commercial  activities;  (d)  encroachment  on  and  loss  of  natural  heritage \nsites,  historical  areas,  cultural  areas,  or  monuments;  (e)  blocking  of  view  lines  along \nvisual corridors by flyovers or grade separators; (f) reduction in width of water courses  \ncaused  by  road  embankments  may  affect  the  flow  of  watercourses;  (g)  noise \ndisturbances  affecting  educational,  healthcare  and  cultural  activities;  (h)  flyovers  or \ngrade  separators  may  be  out  of  scale  with  adjacent  urban  development;  (i)  road \nblocking  and/or  increased  traffic  during  construction  of  facilities;  (j)  noise,  dust,  or \nhazardous  material  generated  by  construction  activities;  (k)  increased  turbidity  and \nsilting  of  watercourses  caused  by  erosion  of  soils  during  construction;  (l)  silt  runoff \nduring  construction  leading  to  impairment  of  downstream  water  quality;  land  values; \nand (m) environmental issues resulting from uncontrolled quarrying of raw materials. \n\n \n8. \nThe  IEEs  conducted  for  the  sample  subprojects  indicate  that  typical  urban  infrastructure \nprojects in Jammu and Kashmir are unlikely to have any significant adverse environmental impacts. \nBased  on  the  site  visits,  data  collected,  and  on-the-spot  public  consultations  that  the  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  and  fact-finding  mission  engaged  in,  three  sample \nsubprojects (covering water supply, sewerage, and urban transportation) have been categorized as \nenvironment  category  B.  The  fourth  subproject\u2014the  Srinagar  solid  waste  management  (SWM) \nfacility\u2014has been categorized as category \"B Sensitive\" because of concerns raised by locals, and \nbecause  it  is  likely  that  toxic  and  hazardous  substances,  including  biomedical  wastes,  may  be \npresent,  and  that  the  soil  and  groundwater  may  have  been  contaminated  by  leachate  from  the \nexisting dump site.13  \n \n9. \nSubsequent to this, further work on the project scope has found that some of the follow-on \nsubprojects to be considered for ADB financing (under subsequent tranches of this proposed sector \nloan  under  multitranche  financing  facility  modality)  may  be  encroaching  upon  environmentally \nsensitive  areas  such  as  wildlife  sanctuaries  and  reserved  forests.  While  most  of  the  follow-on \nsubprojects will pertain to rehabilitation of old and damaged existing urban facilities, a few follow-on \nsubprojects  may  comprise  partially  or  totally  new  developments.  The  updated  and  accurate  maps \nshowing  the  boundaries  of  all  of  these  environmentally  sensitive  areas  are  not  available  with  the \n\n                                                 \n13 \n\nCategory B.  Subproject components judged to have some adverse environmental impacts, but of lesser degree \nand/or significance than those for category A projects.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) is required to determine \nwhether significant environmental impacts warranting an EIA are likely. If an EIA is not needed, the IEE is regarded as the \nfinal  environmental  assessment  report.  Some  category  B  projects  are  deemed  to  be  environmentally  sensitive.  These \ninvolve processing, handling, and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances or other environmentally sensitive activities \nthat also may be of concern to a wide group of external stakeholders. \n\n\f \n\n57\n\nrelevant  authorities.  Under  the  ongoing  PPTA,  these  follow-on  subproject  locations  will  be \nsuperimposed  on  available  maps  to  assess  their  likelihood  of  encroaching  upon  environmentally \nsensitive  areas;  however,  these  maps  will  not  be  available  until  the  development  of  the  second  or \nthird  batch  of  follow-on  subprojects  (to  be  financed  under  subsequent  tranches  of  the  proposed \nmultitranche financing facility). \n \n10. \nConsidering the scale, magnitude, and type of the urban development investments proposed \nunder  this  sector  loan  (mainly  covering  water  supply,  sewerage,  solid  waste  management,  and \nurban  transportation),  the  sample  and  follow-on  subprojects  are  judged  to  have  minor,  temporary \nenvironmental impacts that are largely construction-related and reversible in nature. These impacts \nwill be mitigated through carefully developed environmental management plans (EMPs) that will be \nincorporated into related contract documents as budgeted line items in the bill of quantities. \n \n11. \nIn accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and EAG (2003), the determination of \nthe  environment  category  is  to  be  based  on  the  most  environmentally  sensitive  component  of  the \nProject.  Based on the environmental assessment carried out for the four sample subprojects under \nthe  first  tranche,  the  proposed  Jammu  and  Kashmir  Urban  Sector  Development  Project  loan  has \nbeen categorized as environment category B Sensitive. \n \n12. \nLimited numbers of follow-on subprojects are likely to be encroaching upon environmentally \nsensitive  areas  such  as  wildlife  sanctuaries  and  reserved  forests.  A  detailed  EARF  has  been \ndeveloped  to  cover  the  likelihood  of  inclusion  of  category  A  (follow-on)  subproject(s)  in  the \nsubsequent tranche(s). \n \n13. \n \n\nAn indicative list of subprojects for JKUSDP is provided in the table 1 below.   \n\nTable.1: Indicative List of Subprojects for JKUSDP \n\nName of the Subprojects \n\nA.

The  Jammu  and  Kashmir  Economic \nReconstruction Agency (ERA), the designated Executing Agency, shall also ensure that consent to \noperate is obtained from the SPCB before commissioning of those projects. During the operational \nphase of the project, it is required that regular environmental monitoring under those regulations be \ncarried  out  to  ensure  that  the  subprojects  continue  to  comply  with  the  statutory  environmental \nstandards  prescribed.  The  sample  subprojects  under  sewerage  and  MSW  management  require \ncompliance with the above requirement. \n \n17. \nThe 1994 EIA Notification, issued under India's 1986 Environmental (Protection) Act, requires \napproval  from  the  Government  of  India's  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests  for  certain  types  of \nprojects.

However, \nany  future  subprojects  meeting  the  following  criteria  shall  obtain  environmental  clearance  from  the \nMinistry of Environment and Forests and the State Forest Department,16 as applicable: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nprojects requiring forestland, \n\ntarred roads in forests, \n\n(iii) \n\nwidening of roads requiring land acquisition more than 20 meters on either side, and \n\n(iv)      tourism projects at elevations of more than 1,000 meters with investment more than \n\nThe  Municipal  Solid  Wastes  (Management  and  Handing)  Rules,  2000,  issued  under  the \n19. \nEnvironment  (Protection)  Act,  1986,  require  urban  local  bodies  or  facility  operators  to  obtain \nauthorization  from  the  SPCB  for  collection,  treatment,  and  disposal  of  municipal  solid  wastes \ngenerated in their jurisdiction. These rules prescribe a policy for waste management, that covers: (i) \nwaste collection and storage; (ii) segregation of waste; (iii) littering; (iv) transportation; and (v) waste \nprocessing (compost plants, energy recovery, etc.). For MSW management facilities to be developed \nunder  the  JKUSDP,  The  Jammu  and  Kashmir  ERA  shall  ensure  that  the  relevant  municipal \ncorporations, other urban local bodies, or development authorities, obtain site clearances, applicable \nconsents and appropriate authorizations from SPCB for collection, storage, transport, treatment, and \ndisposal of the MSW. \n \n20. \n \n\nThe following are the provisions of the MSW Rules, 2000, applicable to JKUSDP. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  municipal  authority  shall  take  all  steps  needed  to  ensure  that  municipal  solid \nwaste generated in their jurisdiction shall be handled and disposed of without causing \nadverse impacts on human health and environment; \n\nThe municipal authority or facility operator shall apply to the SPCB in Form-I for grant \nof authorization to set up a waste processing and disposal facility, including landfills; \n\nThe municipal authority shall furnish its annual report in Form-II to the SPCB, annually \non or before the 30th day of June; and  \n\nAny  municipal  solid  waste  generated  in  a  city  or  a  town  shall  be  managed  and \nhandled  in  accordance  with  the  compliance  criteria  and  the  procedure  laid  down  in \nSchedule-II. \n\n \n21. \nThe  Biomedical  Wastes  (Management  and  Handling)  Rules,  1998,  require  healthcare \ninstitutions to provide their own biomedical waste treatment and disposal facilities, or to establish a \ncommon facility through an association of healthcare institutions or through an operator as per the \nrules  without  causing  any  adverse  impact  human  health  and  environment.  The  urban  local  bodies \nare  responsible  for  identifying  suitable  sites  for  such  common  disposal  facilities.  Healthcare \ninstitutions are required to obtain authorization from the SPCB for the disposal of biomedical wastes. \n\n                                                 \n16  The  Government  of  India's  Forest  Act  and  Forest  Conservation  Act  are  not  applicable  to  the  state  of  Jammu  and \nKashmir,  and  hence  any  activity  encroaching  into  the  forest  area  needs  to  obtain  clearance  from  the  State  Forest \nDepartment, as per the Jammu and Kashmir Forest (Conservation) Act, 1997. \n\n\f \n\n61\n\nCurrently only a small portion of the biomedical wastes generated in the state is being treated and \ndisposed  as  stipulated.

Subproject  components  are  projected  to  have  potentially  significant \nadverse  environmental  impacts.  An  EIA  is  required  to  address  significant  impacts. \nThis type of subproject requires an EIA report (including an EMP); the SEIA must be \ndisclosed publicly 120 days prior to approval by ADB; \n\nCategory  B.  Subproject  components  are  projected \nto  have  some  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts,  but  they  are  expected  to  be  less  significant  than  impacts \nassociated with category A projects. An IEE is required to determine whether an EIA \nis warranted. If an EIA is not needed, the IEE is regarded as the final environmental \nassessment report. Category B subprojects will be categorized as \u201cB Sensitive\u201d if they \nare located near environmentally sensitive areas or involve (a) deforestation; (b) loss \nof  biodiversity;  (c)  involuntary  resettlement,  (d)  processing,  handling,  or  disposal  of \ntoxic and hazardous substances; or (e) other environmentally sensitive activities that \nmay  affect  a  wide  group  of  external  stakeholders.  Category  B  subprojects  requires \nIEE reports, including an EMPs; SIEEs have to be disclosed publicly 120 days prior to \napproval by ADB; and \n\nCategory  C.  Subproject  components  are  unlikely  to  have  adverse  environmental \nimpacts.  No  EIA  or  IEE  is  required,  although  environmental  implications  are  still \nreviewed. \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n65\n\nTaking into account of the potential impacts associated with the subprojects of JKUSDP, the \n28. \nfollowing environmental criteria for specific components of JKUSDP will be adopted as guidelines for \nthe selection of subsequent subprojects. \n \n\n(i) \n\nWater supply.  \n(a) \n\nAvoid  water-use  conflicts  in  abstraction  of  raw  water  for  water  supply  with \nother beneficial water uses; \nAvoid siting raw water supply extraction where there are upstream wastewater \ndischarges; \nAvoid hazard of land subsidence caused by excessive groundwater pumping; \nAvoid overpumping of groundwater, which could lead to salinization; \nAvoid generating more sewage than existing community facilities can handle; \nAvoid  excessive  abstraction  of  water,  which  could  downstream  water  users; \nand \nEnsure adequate availability of water at source. \n\n(ii) \n\nSewerage and sanitation. \n(a) \n\nAvoid  areas  of  incompatible  land  use  (e.g.,  densely  populated  residential \nareas, schools, or hospitals); \nAvoid  impairment  of  downstream  water  quality  caused  by  release  of \ninadequately treated or untreated sewage; \nChoose  sites  where  overflows  can  be  controlled  to  avoid  impacts  on \nneighboring properties; and \nChoose  sites  to  minimize  hazards  to  public  health  due  to  overflow  flooding, \nand groundwater pollution due to failure of sewerage system \n\n \n \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nMunicipal solid waste management. \n(a) \n\n \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\nUrban transport.  \n(a) \n\nAvoid areas that do not conform to the Municipal Solid Wastes (Management \nand Handling) Rules, 2000; \nAvoid areas of high population; \nAvoid contamination of receiving waters by leachate from land based disposal \nsystem; \nAvoid  contamination  of  groundwater  and/or  surface  water  by  leachate  from \nland disposal system; \nAvoid \uf020land-use conflicts; \nAvoid  landfill  sites  where  there  is  insufficient  space  for  a  surrounding  buffer \nzone to alleviate nuisances; and \nDesign  waste  management  collection  and  management  practices  to  prevent \nworker  health  and  safety  hazards  resulting  from  toxic  gases  and  hazardous \nmaterials on-site. \n\nEnsure  space  availability  for  road  safety,  residents,  pedestrians  and  for \ninstallation of noise and air pollution mitigation measures; \nMinimize  disfiguration  of  landscape  by  road  embankments,  cuts,  fills,  and \nquarries; \nMinimize alteration of hydrology of waterways crossed by roads; \nMinimize  dislocation  or  involuntary  resettlement  of  people  living  in  right-of-\nway; \n\uf020Minimize  the  risk  of  driving  accidents  where  construction  interferes  with \npreexisting roads; and \n\n \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \n(f) \n\n(g) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(b) \n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n(f) \n\n(g) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n\f66 \n\n \n\n(f) \n\nMinimize  the  risk  of  accidents  associated  with  increased  vehicular  traffic, \nwhich may lead to accidental spills of toxic materials and/or loss of life. \n\n3. \n\nProcedures for Environmental Assessment of Subprojects \n\n \n \n \n29. \nThe  procedures  for  environmental  assessment  of  subprojects  must  be  in  line  with  the \nrequirements  of  national,  state,  and  local  statutory  environmental  regulations,  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002),  EAG  (2003),  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  and  these  Environment \nAssessment and Review Procedures. \n \n30. \nEnvironmental Classification. PMUs will prepare a rapid environmental assessment (REA) \nchecklist  for  each  subproject.  The  formats  for  the  REA  checklists  are  given  in  Appendix  2.    After \nscreening by ERA, a duly signed REA checklist will be submitted to ADB for review and confirmation \nof the environmental classification of each subproject. If any of the follow-on subprojects is classified \nas environment category A, then the entire Project will be recategorized as environment category A \nso that the given Category A follow-on subproject is eligible for project financing. \n \n31. \nPreparation  of  EIAs,  SEIAs,  IEEs  and  SIEEs:  PMUs  will  prepare  an  EIA  and  SEIA  for \nsubprojects classified as Category A and prepare an IEE and SIEE for  subprojects classified as B or \nB Sensitive. The IEE contents will comprise: (i) an introduction; (ii) description of the subproject, (iii) \ndescription  of  the  environment,  (iv)  screening  of  potential  environmental  impacts  and  mitigation \nmeasures, (v) institutional requirements and environmental  monitoring plan, (vi) public consultation \nand information disclosure, (vii) findings and recommendations, and (viii) conclusions. The EIA will \nhave additional sections for (i) alternatives, and (ii) economic assessment [as detailed in ADB\u2019s EAG \n(2003)17].  The  EIA  or  IEE  for  each  subproject  will  include  an EMP  to  ensure  proper  environmental \nmanagement of the subproject. ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects, \n1993,  will  be  used  to  identify  major  environmental  issues.  During  EIA  or  IEE  preparation,  public \nconsultation will be carried out,18 and the comments from the public will be reflected in the final EIA \nor IEE. The SEIA or SIEE will be made available to the public while the  EIA or IEE will be available \nupon request. The SEIAs and SIEEs (for B Sensitive subprojects) will also be subject to ADB\u2019s \u201c120 \nday\u201d rule for the approval of follow-on subprojects. \n \n32. \nReview of EIAs, IEEs, SEIAs, and SIEEs. EIAs, IEEs, SEIAs, and SIEEs prepared by the \nPMUs  will  be  initially  reviewed  by  ERA.  ERA  will  give  comments  to  the  subproject  PMU,  if \nnecessary, to revise the EIA or IEE. After this process, ERA will submit the EIA and SEIA (or the IEE \nand  SIEE)  to  ADB,  where  they  will  be  reviewed  by  ADB's  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment,  if  necessary.  Subproject  approval  will  be  given  based  on  ADB\u2019s  overall  review\u2014\nincluding the review of environmental aspects. Any subproject observed to be in noncompliance with \nADB\u2019s  guidelines  or  requirements  will  not  be  eligible  for  financing  under  JKUSDP.  Subprojects \nidentified  for  financing  under  JKUSDP  are  mainly  urban  infrastructure  development  subprojects, \nwhich  do  not  need  environmental  clearance.  However,  for  subprojects  that  require  environmental \nclearance, such clearance must be obtained well before any implementation activity commences. \n \nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure. ERA is responsible for ensuring that all \n33. \nenvironmental  assessment  documentation,  including  monitoring  the  implementation  of  EMPs,  and \nenvironmental monitoring plans shall be systematically documented. The environmental assessment \ndocuments  are  subject  to  public  disclosure  and  shall  be  made  available,  if  required.  ERA  shall \n                                                 \n17 Appendix 2 of EAG (2003). \n18 Two    consultations  will  take  place  for    EIAs    and  one  consultation  will  take  place  for  IEEs  as  detailed  in  Chapter  X  of \n\nEAG (2003). \n\n\f \n\n67\n\nensure that in carrying out an IEE for any subproject under JKUSDP, at least one consultation with \naffected  people  will  be  carried  out  to  gather  their  concerns  about  the  subproject  and  its  likely \nimpacts.  If  an  EIA  is  required,  ERA  shall  ensure  that  two  consultations  with  affected  people  are \nundertaken. The aim of the first consultation will be to gather affected persons' concerns about the \nsubproject  and  its  impacts.  The  aim  of  the  second  consultation  will  be  to  share  the  EMP  with \naffected persons and gather their views on the EMP. For any subproject categorized as B Sensitive \nor  A,  the  SIEE  (for  category  B  sensitive)  or  SEIA  (for  category  A)  shall  be  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite for 120 days prior to approval of the subproject. Environmental assessment reports for ADB \nprojects will be accessible to interested parties and the general public. It is required that SIEE and \nSEIA  reports  be  circulated  worldwide,  through  the  depository  library  system  and  on  the  ADB \nwebsite. The full EIA or IEE reports are also made available to interested parties on request. \n \n34.  Monitoring  Environmental  Performance.  An  environmental  monitoring  plan  will  be \nprepared for each subproject. This plan will recommend environmental monitoring mechanisms to be \nused to indicate the effectiveness of the EMP in mitigating negative impacts identified in the EIA or \nIEE. The plan will also identify the agencies and institutions that are responsible for monitoring. The \nERA  has  the  overall  responsibility  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  EMPs\u2014including \nenvironmental mitigation measures\u2014for all subprojects under JKUSDP. \n \n35. \nDuring  the  design  and  preconstruction  stage,  monitoring  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the \nPMUs. This is mainly in the form of review and  verification of designs and incorporation of mitigation \nmeasures  into  design  and  contract  documents.  Mitigation  measures  to  be  taken  during  the \nconstruction stage will be mostly implemented by the  main contractor. The PMUs  will also monitor \nthe  environmental  performance.  During  the  operation  stage,  monitoring  will  be  the  responsibility  of \nthe operator, such as the urban local body or line department or agency; however, the SPCB is also \ndelegated  with  periodic  responsibility  for  third-party  monitoring.  There  are  no  significant  impacts \nenvisaged  during  either  the  development  or  operation  phase.  However,  facilities  such  as  STP  and \nMSW disposal facilities may have impacts at the operation stage. The significance of these impacts \nwill  depend  on  the  operational  performance  of  these  facilities.  Although  sufficient  care  and \nappropriate mitigation will be incorporated into the design of these facilities, performance monitoring \nduring  operation  will  be  essential  to  making  the  investments  environmentally  suitable  and  socially \nacceptable.  Therefore,  environmental  parameters  to  be  monitored  during  the  subproject  lifecycle \nhave been identified. \n \n36. \nReports on the implementation of environmental management and environmental monitoring \nplans  need  to  be  documented  systematically.  ERA  shall  ensure  that  ADB  will  be  given  access  to \nundertake  environmental  review  of  any  subproject,  as  and  when  required.    When  unexpected \nenvironmental impacts are encountered during implementation, ERA, in close consultation with ADB, \nshall  undertake  remedial  measures  to  mitigate  those  impacts  at  the  earliest  opportunity.  These \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  shall  be  implemented  and  thoroughly  monitored  by  ERA.  The \nactions  and  the  results  shall  be  recorded  in  writing  and  included  in  the  environmental  monitoring \nreport.  PMUs  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  for  subprojects  that  will  capture  the  status  of \nimplementation  of  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  carried  out  thereof.  ERA  will  consolidate \nquarterly  reports  for  individual  subprojects  and  submit  the  reports  to  ADB  for  public  disclosure  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communication  Policy  (2005).    If  ERA  finds  any  issues  that  need \nfurther environmental monitoring and/or mitigation measures, ERA will give instruction to PMUs, and \ninform  ADB.  ADB  will  review  the  implementation  of  the  EMP,  both  through  quarterly  reports  from \nERA, and through its review missions. \n \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nE. \n\n \n\nConfirmation  that  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Procedures  Conforms  to \nADB\u2019s Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies \n\nStaffing Requirements and Budget \n\n \n37. \nERA  will  with  the  help  of  Consultants  review  the  EIAs/IEEs  and  corresponding  EMPs  to \nensure  that  the  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  plan  proposed  are  adequate  and  conform  to \nADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies.  ADB  in  consultation  with  the  Regional  and \nSustainable  Development  Department  as  deemed  necessary,  will  confirm  the  compliance.  For  this \npurpose,  ERA  will  provide  ADB  with  access  to  information  on  any  subproject,  as  needed.  The \ninformation  on  the  implementation  of  the  EMP,  as  well  as  that  on  the  environmental  safeguard \ncompliance will be systematically documented and reported to ADB as a part of the quarterly reports \ncontaining a section on the implementation of the EMP and environmental monitoring plan. \n \n38. \nEach  PMU  will  ensure  that  all  environmental  assessment  documentation,  including  the \nenvironmental  monitoring  reports, is  properly  and  systematically  kept as  part  of  subproject  specific \nrecords. The procedure will follow the EARF developed during the appraisal of the initial subprojects. \n \nF. \n \n39. \nConducting the environmental assessment as detailed above is the responsibility of ERA. It \nhas  established  PMU  offices  under  ongoing  ADB-financed  Multisector  Project  for  Infrastructure \nRehabilitation  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir  at  Jammu  and  Srinagar.  Each  PMU  office  has  one  fulltime \nqualified  environmental  expert.  In  addition,  under  the  Multisector  Project  for  Infrastructure \nRehabilitation  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir  a  significant  number  of  staff  in  ERA  is  being  trained  in \nenvironment-related  issues.  ERA  will  develop  in-house  expertise  that  is  neutral  from  operations  to \nfocus on independent environmental monitoring so that environmental  concerns are mainstreamed \nin  every  aspects  of  the  project  implementation.  In  addition  to  the  strengthening  of  environmental \nassessment and monitoring capability of ERA, environmental capacity building programs for SPCB \nand  other  line  agencies  and  /or  implementing  agencies  are  proposed  to  be  undertaken  under \nJKUSDP. \n \n40. \nUnder  JKUSDP,  the  PMUs  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  REA  checklists,  and  for  the \nimplementation and monitoring of EMPs. ERA, if necessary, will engage consultants to prepare the \nREA and the IEE or EIA until the in-house staff has been trained adequately. A timeframe of 15 days \nis considered sufficient to prepare an IEE report, and up to 120 days is considered sufficient for an \nEIA report. Hence the budget allocation as per the local rates would be in the range of $4,000 for an \nIEE  and  $20,000  for  an  EIA.    Sufficient  budget  funds  and  resources  have  been  incorporated  into \nJKUSDP to cover costs to (i) implement the environmental review procedures, (ii) conduct IEEs and \nEIAs for the follow up subprojects, (iii) monitor the implementation of the environmental management \nplan, and (iv) undertake environmental monitoring.  \n \nG. \n \n41. \nThis  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  has  been  formulated  for  the  use  of \nERA  and  PMUs  to  ensure  that  the  follow-on  subprojects  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  in \naccordance with the statutory environmental regulations at the national, state and local levels, and \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003),  as  amended \nfrom time to time. \n \n\nConclusion  \n\n\f \n\n69\n\nAnnex A Rapid Environmental Assessment (REA) Checklist \n \nWater Supply Sector \n\n \nInstructions: \n(cid:131) \n\nThis checklist is to be prepared to support the environmental classification of a project.

Despite adequate availability of raw water and installed production \ncapacity,  water  supply  services  in  Srinagar  and  Jammu  are  intermittent,  inequity  in  spatial  supply \nand often of poor quality.  Just over 80% of the population has access to piped water as a result of \nnearly  60%  production  and  distribution  losses,  including  illegal  connections.  There  is  also  a \nmismatch between assured raw water availability, available water treatment capacities, transmission, \nand distribution capacities in the two project cities. \n \nThe  problem  of  water  supply  in  Srinagar  is  compounded  during  the  summer  months  when \n2. \nthere is a large influx of tourists and reduced flow in some water sources feeding the water treatment \nplants. \n \nSubproject Description. The subproject addresses the problems of raw water security and \n3. \nprotects the raw water quality for three main water works in Srinagar, namely Rangil, Alusteng and \nNishat by installing a pipeline to carry the existing and future quantum of water reserved for PHED \nSrinagar in the Sindh Extension Canal (SEC).  \n \n4. \nPHED  Srinagar  has  entered  into  an  agreement  with  the  Power  Development  Corporation \n(PDC) to make available a total of 4.7 cumecs raw water from the proposed tunnel passing close to \nRangil  for  generating  hydroelectricity  at  Beehama.    When  this  larger  quantity  of  water  becomes \navailable,  the  subproject  pipeline  could  be  operated  at  a  higher  pressure  rating  in  the  future  to \ntransport additional raw water when required.  \n \n5. \nThe subproject will also reduce the dependence of Nishat WTP on pumping water from the \nDal Lake more than 100m below.    Besides saving power it also reduces need for extracting  water \nfrom this environmentally sensitive lake. \n \n6. \n \n\nThe subproject includes: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nLaying of about 2.5km  pipeline from Rangil WTP to Alustang WTP take-off; \nLaying of about 7.5km  pipeline from Alustang WTP take-off to Harwan Reservoir; \nSectionalising valves/gates, scour arrangements, air valves, siphons and other \nappurtenances \n \nSewerage Subproject \n\nii. \n\nSubproject Introduction. Waste water management is one of the most important obligatory \n7. \nfunctions of the Government or Local Bodies from the Public Health point of view.  In this regard, the \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\ftwo project cities are no exception, despite the serious threat of contaminating water bodies within \nthe cities and the stipulations of the Environment Protection Act of 1986. \n \n8. \nThere is presently no city wide system for collection treatment or disposal in Jammu city.  In \nthe older sections of the city the latrines still continue and in other areas, the un-treated sewage and \nsullage is discharged into storm water drains causing public health risk. Newer houses in relatively \nmore  planned  and  organized  colonies  have  septic  tanks  but  the  partially  treated  effluent  is  usually \ndischarged into open road drains which flow into the natural drainage channels that pass through the \ncity.  . \n \n9. \nSubproject  Description.  The  city  has  been  divided  up  into  4  main  sewerage  catchments \n(Divisions A to D).  Division A includes the most densely populated areas of the Old City; Division B \nto the north west of the old city was mostly developed after 1947; Division C is the rapidly developing \narea around the Rail Head; and Division D is the new expanding industrial area in the south east.   \n \n10. \nDivision A is sub-divided into Phases I and II.  Phase I is the Old City and Phase II is the \ndensely  populated  area  below  towards  the  Tawi  River.    The        subproject  is  designed  to  collect \ndomestic wastewater from Phase II plus a small section of Division B and provide treatment before \ndisposal into the Tawi River, down stream of the city.  The    subproject will cater to about 230,000 \npersons by the design year 2021 within an area of 490 Ha.  Division A, Phase II, has six sectors, of \nwhich  sector  1  sewerage  and  sewage  treatment  plant  has  been  almost  completed  using  GoJK \nfunds.    Phase  I  which  drains  into  Phase  II  will  be  implemented  as  a  subsequent  subproject.  \nAdequate  land  is  available  at  Bhagwati  Nagar  for  constructing  sewage  treatment  plant  facilities  to \ncater for both phases. \n \n11. \n \n\nThe subproject includes: \n\n(i)  Construction of about  200km of trunk main, secondary sewers, laterals and house \n\nconnections including manholes and chambers; \n\n(ii)  Construction of sewage treatment plant, including integration of the existing sewage \n\ntreatment facilities, to cater for 30 MLD sewage; \n\n(iii)  Standby power generation for main sewage pumping station and treatment plant; \n\n(iv)  Administration office with sanitation and rest facilities for workers; \n\n(v)  Site works including access roads, screening plantation and landscaping \n\n \n\niii. \n\nSolid Waste Management Subproject \n\n \n\n12. \nSubproject Introduction. Solid waste management is one of the most important obligatory \nfunctions of Urban Local Bodies, but due to the lack financial resources and manpower, the use of \ninappropriate equipment, and weak management.  As a result there is no short or long term planning \ndue to lack analytic information on the waste generated or public awareness of civic responsibility for \nmaintaining  a  clean  and  healthy  living  environment.  The  two  project  cities  and  regional  centers \nexhibit similar problems and fail to satisfy the Municipal Solid Wastes (Management and Handling) \nRules (2000). \n\n\f \nSubproject  Description.1  The  subproject  is  to  hygienically  and  aesthetically  dispose  of \n13. \nmunicipal solid waste from Srinagar city at the existing 34 Ha Landfill site and provide treatment to \ncollected leachate.  The subproject will also extend the life of the Landfill site. A subproject of Loan \n2151-IND is being implemented to ensure efficient collection and transportation of solid waste from \nthe city to the SLF site. \n \n14. \n \n\nThe subproject includes: \n\n(i)  New two lane access road to main highway; \n(ii) \n\nImprovements to perimeter fencing and landscaping inside of 100m \u2018no development\u2019 buffer \nzone, as indicated on the Srinagar Master Plan; \n\n(iii)  Administration office with sanitation and rest facilities for workers; \n(iv)  Weighbridge (computerized) of 50 tons capacity at the entry / exit; \n(v)  Lined sanitary landfill cell development including internal approach roads;  \n(vi)  Mechanical and hand equipment for waste segregation and composting;  \n(vii)  Spray equipment for pest repellent and disinfecting; \n(viii)  Equipment workshop and garage building; \n(ix)  Waste transport washing facilities; \n(x)  Leachate Collection and treatment facilities; \n(xi) \n(xii) \n\nImprovement of administrative set-up for handling solid waste including training of staff. \nIf required, the subproject in Srinagar will also provide additional waste collection containers / \nbins, augment collection and handling transport, and improved sanitary waste disposal.   \n\n \n\niv. \n\nUrban transport subprojects \n\n \n15. \nSubproject Introduction. The problem of congestion on main roads and intersections in the \nproject cities is a result of a combination of factors.  Traffic volumes have increased significantly in \nrecent  years  and  most  arterial  roads  have  substandard  road  geometry  to  carry  the  amount  of \nintercity  and  local  traffic.    Prime  issues  of  the  urban  transport  system  include:  narrow  width  with \nheavy mixed traffic; absence of pedestrian facilities; inter-city bus traffic due to the location of inter-\ncity bus terminals within the city centers; absence of planned bus bays; inadequate parking facilities; \nnon-designed junctions; encroachment of right of way; absence of a planned road network; plus the \npoor  road  conditions.  With  the  objective  of  holistically  addressing  city  specific  sector  issues  the \nscheme identification process included: (a) detailed assessment of the existing systems in relation to \nmaster plans or earlier studies; (b) review of on-going development initiatives; (c) need for additional \ninfrastructure strengthening; (d) analysis of environmental, land acquisition and social impacts; and \n(e) financial implications.   \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Due  to  recent  ongoing  discussions  between  Srinagar  Municipal  Corporation  and  the  local  residents,  this \nsubproject may be shifted from existing site to a new site. ADB may consider this change if it becomes necessary \nsubject to compliance by the State and ERA of all requirements of the Loan Agreement and applicable policies and \nprocedures of ADB, India and the State; in which case, loan funds may be available for the subproject in the new \nsite  subject  to  compliances  with  all  requirements  under  the  Loan  Agreement.  Additionally  if  the  Site  is  to  be \nrelocated, the loan funds may also be used to finance proper closure of the existing site, \n\n \n\n\fSubproject  Description.  The  subproject  proposal  is  to  widen  BC  Road  in  Jammu  from \n16. \nSakuntala  Crossing  to  Children\u2019s  Hospital  Junction  (length  0.95km)  to  a  minimum  of  3  x  7.5  m \ncarriageway  corridor  and  3m  wide  median  along  with  a  one-way  flyover  and  pedestrian  cum \nvehicular  sub-way.    The  BC  road  at  either  end  of  this  section  is  already  of  four  lanes.    The  road \nsection is on a moderate slope which reduces speed of buses and heavy vehicles leaving the city \ncausing traffic build ups.  In addition, local buses and auto-rickshaws have no place to stop, which \nincreases traffic congestion.   \n \n17. \n \n\nThe subproject includes: \n\n(i)  Widening of BC Road to 6 lane divided configuration with improvement of vertical profile; \n\n(ii)  2 \u2013lane flyover from Children\u2019s Hospital Junction to Rehari Junction; \n\n(iii)  Provision of Pedestrian cum vehicular underpass at Rehari Junction; \n\n(iv)  Provision/Improvement of footpaths on both sides of road; \n\n(v)  Provision of new bus-stops (6-8 buses) at Rehari Junction; \n\n(vi)  Re-locating existing Auto/Bus Stand to off the carriageway \n\n(vii)  Re-locating power / telephone service poles from carriageway; \n\n(viii) \n\nImprovement of junctions with widening and channalisation; \n\n \nB.
