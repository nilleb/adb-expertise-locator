I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $13,000,000 to \u201cNur Navoi Solar\u201d Foreign Enterprise Limited Liability Company (NNS) for \nthe  Navoi  Solar  Power  Project  in  Uzbekistan.  The  report  also  describes  the  proposed \nadministration of a loan of up to $8,000,000 to be provided by the Canadian Climate Fund for the \nPrivate Sector in Asia II (CFPS II) under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility for the \nNavoi Solar Power Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the CFPS II loan. \n \n2.  The loan will provide long-term financing, not readily available in Uzbekistan, for a 100-\nmegawatt (MW) grid-connected solar photovoltaic power project. The financing, being the first \nnonsovereign support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for a renewable power project in \nUzbekistan, represents a meaningful engagement by ADB to mitigate climate change in line with \nStrategy 2030.1 In addition, the ADB assistance is expected to have a notable demonstration \neffect by crowding in financing from the CFPS II. As the first major private sector renewables \ninvestment  in  Uzbekistan\u2019s  history  with  long-term  international  financing  from  development \ninstitutions, the project is expected to be a landmark transaction with significant demonstration \neffect for private sector participation in Uzbekistan\u2019s energy sector. In particular, the project will \nestablish  bankable  precedents  intended  to  catalyze  further  private  sector  participation  in \nUzbekistan\u2019s renewable energy sector. Further, the project has incorporated several design \nfeatures and targets to improve basic rural infrastructure for women in communities near the \nproject site. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. Uzbekistan is one of the fastest growing economies in Central Asia \nand grew rapidly over the last decade at an average annual rate of 8%, lifting a significant portion \nof its population out of poverty. 2 The energy sector underpins Uzbekistan\u2019s sustained growth and \nprivate sector development. Uzbekistan\u2019s household electrification rate is almost 100%, but an \naging  and  overloaded  electricity  system  causes  a  sustained  power  demand\u2013supply  gap, \nespecially  in  rural  areas.  In  some  villages,  power  outages  occur  during  the  cold  season \n(December\u2013February), lasting from 6 hours a day to a few weeks. \n \n4.  The country\u2019s installed power generation capacity is about 14.0 gigawatts (GW), but the \navailable capacity is estimated at less than 12.5 GW. There are blackouts in rural areas and cities \nduring the cold season (December\u2013February) when electricity demand is highest. Hardest hit are \nsocially vulnerable communities in the southern and western regions of Uzbekistan. Schools and \nhospitals are unable to operate fully in the cold season because of lack of affordable and reliable \nelectricity, putting educational and health care systems at risk.  \n \n5.  Most power generation assets are 40\u201350 years old and run on old steam turbine technology \nplants with a weighted average efficiency of 33%, well below the efficiency of modern combined \ncycle gas turbines at 53%\u201356%. \n \n1  ADB. 2018.

Despite having significant solar resources, Uzbekistan is highly dependent on inefficient \nand old natural gas generation assets for electricity. To address the issue, the Government of \nUzbekistan plans to rapidly develop its renewable energy sector to facilitate diversification of the \ncountry\u2019s energy mix and attract private investment in the sector. The government targets at least \n25% renewable energy (solar and wind) in terms of capacity by 2030 with plans to install at least \n5 GW of solar capacity. 3 \n \n7.  In February 2019, the government, assisted by the World Bank\u2019s Scaling Solar program \nand International Finance Corporation Advisory Services, launched a competitive tender process \nfor the project which will be Uzbekistan\u2019s first utility-scale renewable energy project. The project \nis  Uzbekistan\u2019s  first  private  sector  renewable  energy  investment  and  sets  a  precedent  in \nestablishing the bankability of the sector, incorporating international best practices and project \ndocumentation for future renewable energy financings. \n \n8.  Project design. The project constitutes the development, construction, operation, and \ntransfer of a 100 MW grid-connected solar photovoltaic power project on a build\u2013operate\u2013transfer \nbasis about 35 kilometers west of Navoi City, in central Uzbekistan.4 The project site was selected \nby the government, and usage rights will be granted to NNS by way of a long-term land lease \nagreement. NNS will sell all its energy output to Joint Stock Company (JSC) National Electric Grid \nof Uzbekistan (NEGU) (the state-owned offtaker) [Confidential information deleted].  \n \n9.

NNS  will  build,  own,  and  operate  the  100  MW  grid-connected  solar \nphotovoltaic power project. \n \n11.  Sponsor. Masdar was established in 2006 as a renewable energy company with the \nmission of supporting the United Arab Emirates\u2019 leadership in the global energy sector, while \nsustaining the diversification of the country\u2019s economy and energy sources.5 Masdar is a global \nleader in the renewable energy sector and has developed utility-scale, grid-tied projects; small-\nscale applications providing energy access to communities away from the electricity grid; and \ncarbon abatement projects. Since its inception, Masdar has successfully developed an aggregate \n2.7 GW of renewable energy across 30 countries with a combined investment of $8.5 billion; \nMasdar\u2019s share in these investments6 amounts to $2.7 billion.7 Masdar is indirectly and wholly \nowned  by  the  Government  of  Abu  Dhabi  through  shareholdings  in  Mubadala  Investment \nCompany Public JSC and Mamoura Diversified Global Holding Public JSC. \n \n12.

The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) share of renewable energy \nsources in the country\u2019s energy mix increased, and (ii) access to electricity improved through the \nconstruction of new electricity-generating capacities.8 \n \n15.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: renewable power delivered to the \ndomestic grid increased.9 The project will generate about 258.2 gigawatt-hours of clean energy \nper annum and will contribute to avoiding 157,502 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually.10 \nThe project will also boost local employment and contribute to the local economy through \ndomestic purchases. \n \n16.  Outputs. The project will have the following outputs: (i) installation of solar power plant, \n(ii) generation of local employment, (iii) growth of local economy, and (iv) enhanced gender \nequality in NNS operations. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n17.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and three of its key operational priorities: (i) addressing remaining poverty \nand reducing inequalities; (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality; and (iii) tackling climate \nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability \n(footnote 1). As the first utility-scale renewable energy project in Uzbekistan, the project will help \nintroduce solar power generation to address climate change and accelerate low greenhouse \ngas (GHG) development. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Uzbekistan, 2019\u20132023 stresses \nthe need for ADB to provide private sector financing for a wide spectrum of renewable energy \ninfrastructure.11 The  project  is  also  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  strategic  emphasis  on \nmaximizing the use of indigenous energy resources, diversifying the fuel mix away from fossil \nfuels, and reducing GHG emissions. As part of Uzbekistan\u2019s Nationally Determined Contributions, \nthere is a target to reduce annual GHG emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 10% by \n2030 (relative to 2010). GHG reductions are expected to be achieved through various measures, \nincluding the deployment of renewable solar power generation. \n \n18.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent  with  the  ADB  Energy  Policy,  which  emphasizes  promoting  renewable  energy, \nmaximizing access to energy for all, and private sector participation to enhance energy sector \nefficiency.12 The project, with its competitive tariff for solar power generation, will improve the \ncountry\u2019s energy security, affordability, and sustainability. The project also helps ADB collaborate \nwith the private sector, international development agencies, and multilateral institutions. The ADB \nloan will be categorized as climate financing and help to achieve ADB\u2019s annual climate finance \ntarget of $6 billion by 2020. The project is also strongly aligned with ADB\u2019s proposed sovereign \nsupport  for the country\u2019s ongoing Power Sector Reform Program13 which has specifically laid out \n \n8  Government of Uzbekistan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 2017.

Lessons  from  previous  operations.  Past  ADB  support  for  independent  power \ngeneration projects point to the need to have robust bankable contracts that have been tested in \nmultiple jurisdictions through several macroeconomic and business cycles. This project\u2014by virtue \nof the International Finance Corporation\u2019s advisory role\u2014benefits from a contractual framework \nthat has been developed and tested by multilateral institutions over the medium to long term in \nseveral emerging markets. The long-term sustainability and success of private power generation \nprojects also depend on their tariffs being affordable, offering good value for money, and ranking \nhigh on the economic merit order for dispatch. The highly competitive and entirely transparent \nbidding process for the project has led to a highly affordable and sustainable tariff, which assures \ndispatch of the project. \n \nD.

The Assistance \n \n24.  ADB's assistance will comprise (i) a senior loan of up to $13,000,000; and (ii) the \nadministration of a loan of up to $8,000,000 from the CFPS II. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n25.  The project is the first utility-scale renewable energy project in Uzbekistan. ADB will add \nvalue to the project by providing and helping catalyze third party long-term debt financing, which \nis otherwise unavailable in the market. ADB\u2019s participation will also facilitate the crowding-in of a \nrobust  level  of  equity  capital  from  a  very  credible  sponsor  in  the  project.  Deployment  of \nconcessional loans by ADB from CFPS II will improve the commercial viability and bankability of \nthe project. Moreover, ADB\u2019s participation will add significant value to the renewable energy \nsector in Uzbekistan by setting a precedent and acting as a strong signal in support of its \ncommercial viability. ADB will also benefit the project through its adherence to ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009)  which  will  ensure  the  adoption  of  international  best  practices  in \nsafeguards management. Finally, ADB has introduced several meaningful gender elements in the \nproject design which will help promote women\u2019s economic empowerment. \n \n14 For the Navoi Solar Project, the World Bank will be providing sovereign-backed partial credit guarantees to support \nletters of credit being issued by the offtaker.  \n ", "5 \n \n26.  The deployment of a concessional loan from CFPS II was necessary to ensure a financially \nviable  result  from  the  competitive  bidding  process  and  improve  the  bankability  of  the \nproject.  Concessional terms were provided to bidders on an indicative basis prior to the tender, \nwith the expectation that the value of the concessional support would pass through and result in \na lower tariff, improving the tender result for the offtaker, and increasing the likelihood of a \nsuccessful outcome and subsequent follow-on renewable energy development. This will be the \nfirst project for which ADB will make use of CFPS II to provide blended finance support directly to \na renewable energy project in Uzbekistan. The project is aligned with the DFI Enhanced Principles \nfor Blended Concessional Finance for Private Sector Operations.15 \n \nC.  Risks \n \n27.  Confidential information deleted.  \n \n28.

ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement as follows: environment (category B), involuntary resettlement (category B), and \nindigenous peoples (category C).16 \n \n34.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the \nadverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans. The environmental and social measures and \nthe  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  NNS  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n35.  NNS has engaged an independent consultant to prepare the preliminary environmental \nand social impact assessment to meet ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. The \npotential environmental and social impacts of the project were identified, and effective measures \nto avoid minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated in the \nenvironmental and social management plan. The final impact assessment and management plan, \nincluding updates on the ecological survey investigation, stakeholder engagement plan and \ngrievance redress mechanism, will be completed prior to construction commencement and as a \ncondition of disbursement. The anticipated environmental impacts, such as noise, vibration, dust, \nwaste generation, and surface water contamination, are generally associated with construction \n \n15 The DFI Enhanced Principles for Blended Concessional Finance for Private Sector Projects seek to ensure that \nprojects utilizing blended finance solutions apply the following principles: (i) additionality and rationale for blended \nconcessional finance; (ii) crowding in and minimum concessionality; (iii) reinforcing private markets; (iv) commercial \nsustainability; and (v) promoting high standards. \n16 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "6 \n \nactivities. Potential impacts during operation are wastewater, solid waste generation, and glaring \neffects from the solar panels. These impacts can be effectively managed by implementing good \nengineering,  construction,  and  housekeeping  practices  as  well  as  preventive  and  control \nmeasures laid out in the site-specific environmental management plans. The solar plant and/or \nits surrounding areas are not in or near environmentally sensitive areas. The nearest residential \ncommunity is about 2.6 kilometers from the solar plant. Therefore, residents will not experience \nany health or safety disturbance or inconvenience during construction and operation. The project \nsite is situated on 267 hectares of land that was formerly used by two leaseholders for grazing \nand which cannot sustain arable crops due to poor soil quality. The environmental and social \nimpact  assessment  has  identified  unresolved  compensation  arrangements  between  local \ngovernment authorities and one of the former leaseholders and a subtenant. The environmental \nand social action plan agreed with lenders during appraisal requires NNS to resolve this and any \nunanticipated economic displacement impacts caused by its temporary and permanent use of \nland prior to construction commencement.17 The photovoltaic panels that will be used will have \nlimited levels of either glint or glare and will be equipped with antireflective coating that will \nsignificantly reduce the glare effects upon local communities and aircraft. NNS will develop \nstorage,  handling,  and  disposal  procedures  for  broken  or  damaged  panels.  The  annual \nenvironmental  and  social  monitoring  report  that  will  include  information  on  the  project\u2019s \nenvironmental and social performance and compliance is required to be submitted to ADB for \nreview and public disclosure on ADB\u2019s website. Occupational health and safety risks will be \nmitigated through the development of a health and safety plan that will include routine training, \nmonitoring, and provision of personal protective equipment. Environmental and occupational \nhealth and safety provisions, consistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements, \nwill be incorporated into the contractor agreements. \n \n36.  Some gender elements. Similar to the global challenge of labor participation of women \nin renewable energy,18 the energy sector in Uzbekistan has low women\u2019s representation, mostly \nbecause of the lack of necessary education, lack of awareness of employment options, limited \nopportunities for skills development, and prevailing stereotypes that regard the energy sector as \na  high-risk  profession  that  is  not  suitable  for  women.19 With  the  predominance  of  male \nrepresentation in the project site\u2019s workforce, implying higher risks of gender-based abuses \nespecially during the construction period, and with the limited number of jobs for women due to \nlocal and sector context, the focus of the project\u2019s gender mainstreaming is to provide a safe \nworking environment for female employees and ensure safe interactions with the local population. \nNNS commits to implement measures to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in \nits  business  activities  following  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  (1998).  These \nmeasures are (i) jobs for women during both construction and operation, (ii) sex-segregated staff \nfacilities, (iii) an anti-sexual harassment policy, (iv) annual training for staff and contractors during \nconstruction  and  operation  on  gender  sensitivity  and  a  respectful  work  environment,  and \n(v) women\u2019s participation in local skills development in renewable energy. NNS will submit \nperiodic reports on the implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \n37.  NNS will comply with  national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \n \n17 Due to the uncertainty caused by COVID-19, NNS cannot confirm if purpose-built worker\u2019s accommodations will be \nrequired in proximity to the plant site during the construction phase. Should accommodations be necessary, NNS \nhas agreed in the environmental and social action plan to ensure that local authorities provide alternative grazing \nland to impacted herders prior to construction. NNS will provide replacement and relocation assistance to impacted \nherders.  \n18 International Renewable Energy Agency. 2019. Renewable Energy: A Gender Perspective. Abu Dhabi. \n19 ADB. 2018.

NNS was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing international best practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
