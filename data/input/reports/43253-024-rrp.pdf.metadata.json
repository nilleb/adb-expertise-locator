With  approximately  39%  of the \nstate\u2019s population living in urban areas (against 31% for the country), Karnataka is the fifth most \nurbanized  state  in  India,  and  this  percentage  is  expected  to  increase  to  50%  by  2030. \nKarnataka\u2019s  Vision  2020  anticipates  increasing  urbanization  and  industrialization,  but  without \neffective management of available water resources, water will constrain economic development. \nThe  investment  program  aims  to  improve  water  resource  management  in  urban  areas  in  a \nholistic  and  sustainable  manner  consistent  with  the  principles  of  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement (IWRM).2 The investment program will (i) provide investment support to modernize \nand  expand  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation  (UWSS);  (ii)  strengthen  institutions  to  improve \nwater use efficiency, productivity, and sustainability; and (iii) pursue innovative technologies and \ninstruments,  such  as  public\u2013private  partnerships  or  reform-oriented  incentive  funds.  The \ninvestment  program  will  support  the  greening  and  inclusiveness  agendas  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  as  it  targets  assistance  to  fragile  water-scarce  environments,  often \nlocated in Karnataka\u2019s economically lagging regions. The investment program will also support \nADB\u2019s  climate  change  strategic  priorities  by  promoting  climate-resilient  development  and \ncapacity development for adaptation. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nWater  scarcity. Karnataka, India\u2019s eighth largest state, accounts for about 5.1% of the \ncountry\u2019s  population,  5.8%  of  its  surface  area,  and  6%  of  its  surface  water  resources. 3 \nKarnataka\u2019s seven major river basins  suffer from water over-abstraction and deteriorating river \nwater  quality.  Major  sources  of  pollution  include  untreated  sewage,  industrial  discharges, \npesticide  runoff,  mining,  and  degrading  watershed  soils.  Water  resources  are  distributed \nunevenly in both time and space, and there are multiple competing users. The impact of climate \nchange,  anticipated  to  exacerbate  droughts  and  floods,  may  further  reduce  water  availability. \nHowever,  Karnataka\u2019s  annual  water  demand  is  forecast  to  rise  by  up  to  40%  by  2025, \nthreatening  sustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  IWRM  is  therefore  urgently \nneeded.  While  there  are  constraints  to  IWRM  (such  as  fragmentation  of  water  resources \nmanagement  responsibilities  among  agencies  and  resistance  to  change),  there  are  promising \nenabling  factors  (such  as  recognition  of  the  scarcity  and  threats  to  the  water  resource, \nprogressive policy statements, and a willingness to invest in and reform institutions).  \n \n4. \nUrbanization  and  water.  Karnataka  is  one  of  India\u2019s  most  economically  progressive \nstates.  As  a  result,  the  state  economy  is  growing  fast,  with  the  annual  gross  state  domestic \nproduct  growth  averaging  7.2%  in  FY2009\u2212FY2012.  Water  is  central  to  the  state\u2019s  future \ndevelopment. While in 2013 85% of the state\u2019s available water was allocated to irrigation, 2025 \nprojections  suggest  a  decline  in the  proportion  used for  agriculture  to  73%  and  an  increase  in \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   IWRM is a concept and process that promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land, and \nrelated resources to maximize economic and social welfare equitably and without compromising the sustainability \nof vital ecosystems and the environment. \n\n3   Karnataka  has  a  population  of  61  million,  covers  an  area  of  191,791  square  kilometers,  and  has  an  inflow  of \n\n1,869,000 million cubic meters of surface water. \n\n \n\n\fSector  performance.  Urban  water  supply  and  sewerage  service \n\nhousehold  drinking  (from  4.4%  in  2000  to  5.0%  in  2025)  and  industrial  water  allocation  (from \n3.6%  in  2000  to  6.8%  in  2025).  This  is  consistent  with  Karnataka\u2019s  economic  development \nagenda  for  2020,  which  prioritizes  the  sustainability  of  the  state\u2019s  environment  and  natural \nresources and anticipates increasing urbanization and industrialization. Greater water share for \nurban use also calls for more responsible stewardship of scarce resources.  \n \n5. \nlevels  vary \nsubstantially across Karnataka. Although 92% of the state\u2019s urban households report access to \ndrinking water, (i) six districts out of 30 suffer from acute shortages; (ii) household connections \nrepresent only a mere fraction of this value, as a large proportion of the population still relies on \nstandposts  for  their  daily  supply;  and  (iii)  rapid  urbanization  and  densification  beyond  the \nadministrative  city  boundaries  do  not  always  translate  into  service  provision  coverage  to  new \nareas.  In  addition  to  insufficient  coverage,  there  are  unmet  demands:  despite  constant \nimprovements,  water  supply  services  are  generally  intermittent,  with  inadequate  service \nstandards  (pressure  and  quality)  and  insufficient  metering.  Available  data  for  213  urban  local \nbodies (ULBs) in Karnataka suggests that only 38% of these provide water at normative levels \n(70\u2013135  liters  per  capita  per  day,  depending  on  population  size).4 While  a  few  ULBs  provide \nquasi-continuous  water supply,  average  water  supply  services  in most  towns  is  2\u20133 hours  per \nday,  requiring  (mostly  women)  to  fetch  water  from  community  taps.  Causes  for  deficiency \ninclude  inadequate  water  source  availability,  financing,  or  population  increase,  and  also \nwastage and substantial system inefficiencies. While water meters are being introduced, water \naudits  are  uncommon.  Nonrevenue  water  (NRW)  estimates  range  from  30%  to  50%  across \nurban  schemes  in  Karnataka,  against  the  national  service  level  benchmark  of  15%.  Water \nquality reports are seldom disclosed, and testing at the point of use is not frequently done. \n \n6. \nDespite increasing attention by state authorities, sanitation still lags behind water supply \nthroughout  Karnataka.  Overall,  42%  of  the  urban  population  reports  access  to  sewerage \nnetworks,  but  only  15%  is  attached  to  treatment  systems  and  households  have  often  not  yet \nconnected  where  sewers  have  been  laid.  Where  sewerage  networks  are  not  available,  black \nwater  and  gray  water  is  discharged  into  drains,  much  of  which  contributes  to  polluting \nKarnataka\u2019s water bodies. Meeting the steep demand for urban and industrial water, protecting \nwater  bodies,  and  effectively  treating  and  discharging  and/or  reusing  effluent  remain  critical \nchallenges. In addition, 19% of the population is not covered by any sort of sanitation scheme. \nThe  lack  of  sanitation  facilities  forces  people  to  resort  to  open  defecation,  exposing  them \n(especially women and girls) to health and safety risks. \n \n7. \n\nChallenges and opportunities. Gaps and opportunities are as follows: \n(i) \n\nCity and regional water planning. Many ULBs in Karnataka have prepared city \ndevelopment plans capturing current and future needs for water-related services. \nThese are, however, neither updated nor linked to financing plans. Moreover, the \ndevelopment  of  water  sources  is  generally  on  a  scheme-by-scheme  basis  and \nseldom considers regional impacts and/or gains. \n\n(ii)  Water use and performance monitoring. In 2011, the state government issued \nan  order  making  water  metering  compulsory.  Most  water  schemes  are  in  the \n\n                                                \n4   Data suggests that in South Karnataka (106 ULBs),  44% of the ULBs supply water that matches or exceeds the \nnorms.  In  North  Karnataka  (107  ULBs),  this  value  is  only  33%  (ADB.  2011.  Integrated  Water  Resources \nManagement  and  Sustainable  Services  Delivery  in  Karnataka\u2014Component  3.  Consultant\u2019s  report.  Manila  [TA \n7418-IND]). A separate study suggests that (i) 47% of Karnataka\u2019s ULBs provide more than 70 liters per capita per \nday, 42% provide 40\u201370 liters per capita per day, and 11% less than 40 liters per capita per day; and (ii)  53% of all \nULBs  provide  daily  water  supply,  28%  on  alternate  days,  and  19%  every  3  or  more  days.  The  problem  is \nparticularly  acute  during  the  dry  season  (ADB.  2012.  Karnataka  Integrated  and  Sustainable  Water  Resource \nInvestment Program\u2014Volume 1. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila [TA 7954-IND]).  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f \n8. \n\n(iii) \n\nprocess  of  introducing  bulk  and  household  meters.  However,  most  monitoring \ndata concerning water abstraction and/or losses in the network is still inaccurate. \nWater quality testing and effluent discharge records are often incomplete.  \nInsufficient  interagency  coordination.  Responsibilities  for  water  issues  have \nbeen  traditionally  fragmented  and  divided  among departments,  without  a formal \nmechanism  for  coordination.  Fragmentation  in  decision  making  results  in \nsuboptimal  management  of  Karnataka\u2019s \nlimited  surface  and  groundwater \nresources. In 2010, the state government created an IWRM steering committee, \nand in 2011 it established the Advanced Centre for IWRM to provide advice and \nconduct research. \n\nService delivery challenges impacting water resource management in Karnataka are: \n(i) \n\nInadequate  asset  planning  and  management.  In  most  ULBs,  water-related \ninfrastructure  is  neither  integrated  nor  adequately  phased.  Some  elements  are \noverdesigned (e.g., intakes and treatment units) and run at suboptimal conditions, \nwhile  others  are  not  given  sufficient  attention  (e.g.,  distribution  networks), \ncompromising  technical  and  financial  sustainability.  ULBs  often  lack  adequate \ntechnical  staff  to  (a)  operate  and  maintain,  and  (b)  manage  and  plan  water \nassets. Cognizant of the need to efficiently run and professionally manage water \nsystems, Karnataka has partnered with the private sector in service delivery.   \nDemand management and investment financing. In 1996, Karnataka directed \nULBs  to  adopt  volumetric  tariffs.  Despite  improvements,  urban  infrastructure \nfunding and asset sustainability continue to be challenged by poor cost recovery \nmechanisms. In addition, unmetered supplies and public standposts have led to \nsignificant  wastage.  In  response,  in  July  2011,  Karnataka  issued  a  government \norder  making  the  introduction  of  sewerage  tariffs  compulsory  and  raising \nminimum tariff levels. Karnataka has also led a number of urban finance reforms, \nincluding accounting and property tax reforms. \n\n(ii) \n\n \n9. \nRoad  map  and  lending  modality.  Karnataka\u2019s  integrated  urban  water  management \nroad  map  will  assist  in  establishing  a  process  of  coordinated  planning,  development,  and \nmanagement  of  urban  water  resources  in  a  way  that  maximizes  economic  and  social  welfare \nwithout  compromising  environmental  sustainability. 5  The  physical  component  of  the  state\u2019s \ninvestment program is estimated at about $1.9 billion while the nonphysical component (reforms, \nmanagement improvements, and capacity development) is estimated at $110 million. The policy \nand  institutional  framework  will  provide  the  enabling  environment  necessary  to  improve  urban \ntechnical  and  environmental  sustainability,  and  promote \nwater  management,  enhance \ninstitutional  and  financial  sustainability.  The  government  has  requested  ADB  to  finance  a \nfraction of the state\u2019s investment program through an MFF. The MFF is the modality of choice \nfor  this  investment  program  as  it  is  the  most  effective  modality  to  (i)  maximize  and  measure \nproject  results  in  localized  geographical  areas;  (ii)  provide  efficiencies  associated  with \neconomies  of  scale  as  additional  municipalities  join  regional  utilities;  (iii)  blend  capacity \ndevelopment assistance with policy implementation and infrastructure provision, and phase it to \nmaximize  ULB  commitment;  and  (iv)  carry  out  the  application  of  a  long-term  road  map,  which \nprovides a structured framework to assist forecasting needs throughout the design process. The \nmodality  is  appropriate  given  (i)  the  state\u2019s  sound  record  in  the  sector,  experience  and \nwillingness  to  undertake  reforms;  and  (ii)  the  proven  capacity  of  the  Karnataka  Urban \nInfrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC). \n\n                                                \n5  Sector Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f10. \nStrategic context. The investment program is in line with (i) priorities outlined in India\u2019s \n12th  Five  Year  Plan,6 (ii)  policy  directions  outlined  by  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  in  the \nNational  Water  Policy  (2013),  and  (iii)  service  delivery  reforms  promoted  by  the  Ministry  of \nUrban  Development  (including  service  level  benchmarks  and  the  National  Urban  Sanitation \nPolicy,  2008).  The  investment  program  has  been  designed  in  support  of  Karnataka\u2019s  Vision \n2020  (which envisages eliminating  poverty  in  all  areas  and the  achievement  of the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals by 2015), the State\u2019s Water Policy (2002), and Karnataka\u2019s Urban Drinking \nWater and Sanitation Policy (2002). The investment program complements the activities under \nthe proposed Karnataka Integrated and Sustainable Water Resources Management Investment \nProgram for irrigation modernization, IWRM, and river basin management.7  \n \n11. \nADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  and  lessons  learned.  The  road  map\u2019s  objectives  are  fully \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2013\u20132017, which proposes to (i) pilot \nnew  approaches  for  sustainable  urban  development  in  small  and  mid-sized  cities  with  high \npotential for growth, (ii) encourage technical advancement, (iii) strengthen governance and reforms \nfor  service  delivery,  and  (iv)  develop  institutional  capacity. 8  The  road  map  and  MFF  design \nincorporate lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in India, especially in Karnataka, including the need \nto  (i)  incorporate  low-cost  sanitation  facilities  for  poor  households,  (ii)  provide  house  service \nconnections  for  urban  water  and  sewerage  as  part  of  the  project  scope,  (iii)  include  targeted \nawareness  campaigns  for  changing  the  behavior  of  urban  residents,  and  (iv)  implement \ninstitutional reforms through standardized systems and processes at the state level.9 \n \nB. \n\n  \nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  will  be  improved  sustainable  water  security  in  selected  river  basins  in \n12. \nKarnataka.

All \nthree  towns  in  project  1  are  in  close  proximity  (within  the  Upper  Tungabhadra  subbasin)  and \ndraw drinking water from the same polluted river section. Achieving full sewerage coverage and \nconnecting  all  households  are  expected  to  result  in  important  river  quality  improvements. \nEffluent  reuse  is  possible  for  agricultural  purposes  in  the  three  towns,  and  reuse  by  small \nindustry is being evaluated in Davangere. All towns have significant levels of NRW, which may \nincrease  after  continuous  water  is  supplied.  As  water  loss  management  is  essential, \nperformance-based  management  contracts  for  water  will  be  utilized  in  the  project  towns  after \nestablishing baselines and targets for NRW reduction.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic  analysis. The  economic  rationale  for  government  intervention  is  sound  as \n20. \nthe investment program supports the improved provision of basic civic services, a public good \nprovided  by  the  government.  As  a  result  of  improved  public  services,  positive  externalities  in \npublic  health,  human  capital  development,  environment protection,  and resource management \nwill be created and better managed. The economic analysis evaluated the economic viability of \nthe  six  water  supply  and sewerage  subprojects  under  project  1. The  economic  internal rate  of \nreturn (EIRR)  of  12.9%\u201323.6% for  the  six  subprojects  is  higher  than the  economic  opportunity \ncost  of  capital  at  12%,  indicating  sufficient  economic  benefits.  The  results  are  robust  against \ndownside risks, including (i) capital cost overrun by 10%, (ii) operation and maintenance (O&M) \ncost overrun by 10%, (iii) benefits reduced by 10%, and (iv) delay in project implementation by 1 \n                                                \n17  Climate Change Risk Screening (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nyear.  The  EIRRs  range from  10.7% to  19.8%  in  the  sensitivity  analysis;  the  minimum  EIRR  is \n10.7%  when  all  risks  are  assumed  to  occur  at  the  same  time,  which  is  improbable.  The \nsensitivity  analysis  shows  that  EIRRs  are  relatively  more  sensitive  to  a  reduction  in  benefits. \nGiven  Karnataka\u2019s  rapidly  increasing  urbanization  rates  (to  over  50%  by  2030),  the  risk  for \nunrealized economic benefits from project 1 is minimal. \n \n21. \nFinancial  analysis.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  of  0.9%\u20132.9%  for  the \nthree  water  subprojects  exceeds  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  0.68%, \nindicating  reasonable  financial  return.  This  is  based  on  the  assumptions  that  volumetric  water \ntariffs  will  be  set  and  adjusted  over  time  to  recover  O&M  costs  and  capital  investments. \nPotential  revenue  streams  from  the  water  supply  subprojects  can  be  utilized  to  subsidize  the \nO&M costs of the sewerage subprojects at the ULB level. Though FIRRs for sewerage do not \nmeet the hurdle rate, the towns will fully recover the O&M costs from incremental revenues over \nthe  analysis  period.18 In  the  initial  5-year  period,  other  municipal  resources  will  be  required  to \nsupport O&M for the combined subprojects in case of one ULB (Byadagi). Sensitivity analyses \nrevealed that the water supply subprojects' FIRRs are most sensitive to a reduction in revenues, \nindicating  that  improved  collection  efficiency  and  implementation  of  volumetric  tariffs  will  be \ncrucial to ensuring financial viability. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n22. \nKarnataka  and  project  1  towns  offer  opportunities  to  test  new  approaches  to  reform, \ncontractual  models  fostering  shared  responsibility  and  accountability  within  the  public  sector,  and \npublic\u2013private partnerships. Institutional arrangements proposed under the investment program are \nconsistent  with  state  and  ULB  mandates.  The  KUIDFC\u2019s  procurement  and  project  management \ncapacity  is  appropriate.  The  financial  management  assessment  did  not  identify  any  significant \nconcerns.  To  ensure  proper  recording  and  management  of  account  transactions,  designated \naccounting  and  finance  staff  for  the  investment  program  should  be  engaged  at  the  right  time, \nespecially  at  the  project  implementing  unit  level.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  central  and  state  governments  and \nKUIDFC.  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  facility \nadministration manual. Anticorruption and governance measures under the North Karnataka Urban \nSector Investment Program remain appropriate and will be extended to this investment program.19  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe \n\nimplement  socially \n\ninvestment  program  will \n\ninclusive  and  gender-focused \n23. \ninterventions.20 Under project 1, data, disaggregated by sex, ethnicity, and social and economic \nbackground will be collected at regular intervals to help establish baseline figures to track social \nand gender equality results as the project progresses. A gender action plan has been prepared \nfor project 1 to ensure that social and gender equality activities are implemented and monitored \nat regular intervals. The project will target poor, disadvantaged, and female-headed households \nthrough improved water supply, sewerage, and sanitation, as well as implementation of existing \n                                                \n18  A 10-year forecast based on ULBs\u2019 past 4-year financial performance showed that incremental O&M costs arising \nfrom water and sewerage subprojects could be absorbed in their budget without creating any major fiscal burden. \n19  Measures  include  (i)  public  disclosure  on  the  KUIDFC\u2019s project  webpage of  physical  and  financial progress,  and \nresults  of  tenders;  (ii)  public  disclosure  of  annual  project  accounts  audits;  and  (iii)  ULB  web-based  platforms  to \npromptly  redress  public  grievances  (ADB.  2006.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of \nDirectors: Proposed Loan to India for the North Karnataka Urban Sector Investment Program. Manila).  \n\n20  Key initiatives include (i) new or improved water and sewerage connections for poor, socially disadvantaged, and \nfemale-headed  households;  (ii)  a  communication  program  to  bring  about  attitudinal  changes  to  health,  hygiene, \nand  sanitation;  (iii)  capacity  development  to  sensitize  government  staff  on  social  inclusion  and  gender;  (iv) \nparticipation from disadvantaged groups in project implementation, and monitoring activities; (v) awareness raising. \n\n\fgovernment  policies  that  ensure  affordability  of  water  user  rates  and  installation  of  household \ntoilets in accordance with the \u201cBharat Nirman Abhiyan\u201d total sanitation scheme. Information and \ncommunication  materials  will  be  developed  to  educate  communities  on  social,  economic,  and \nhealth-related impacts of improved hygiene and sanitation conditions. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\n24. \nResettlement  (category  B)  and  indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  Temporary \nimpacts on loss of income to shop owners, street vendors, and hawkers are envisaged due to \nconstruction and rehabilitation of water supply and sewerage networks in project towns. A total \nof  9.09  hectares  of  private  agricultural  land  will  need  to  be  acquired  for  the  construction  of \nsewage treatment plants in Byadagi and Davengere, impacting 12 landowners. The new service \nreservoirs,  sewage  treatment  plants,  lift  stations,  and  community  toilets  will  be  located  within \nexisting facilities or  in government  and/or  community  lands.  One  voluntary  land  donation for  a \nsewage  lift  station  in  Harihar  has  been  identified.  Independent  third  party  validation  of  the \ndonated  land  was  done  and  the  report  is  included  in  the  final  Harihar  resettlement  plan.  The \ndraft resettlement plans of Byadagi and Davengere were prepared in consultation with affected \npersons  during  the  preparation  stage  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009). The final resettlement plans will be prepared upon the completion of detailed design and \nsubmitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  prior  to  implementation.  The  Indian  Right  to  Fair \nCompensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act is in \neffect since 1 January 2014. Based on socioeconomic surveys, no indigenous people reside in \nproject sites. Improved water supply and sewerage networks will benefit all households equally. \nMeaningful  and  widespread  consultations  with  communities  will  continue \nthroughout \nimplementation.  Resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples\u2019  frameworks  have  been  prepared  and \ndisclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  webpage.  They  provide  guidance  and  outline  requirements  to  prepare \nmitigation plans for involuntary resettlement and/or indigenous people impacts for project 1 and \nprojects under future tranches of the investment program.21  \n \n25. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  An environmental  assessment  and review  framework  was \nprepared  to  guide  the  preparation  of  future  tranches,  and  three  initial  environmental \nexaminations with environmental management plans were prepared for project 1 in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  government  laws.  The  initial  environmental \nexaminations  conclude  that  no  significant  adverse  impact  is  anticipated  as  a  result  of  UWSS \ninfrastructure  expansion  and  rehabilitation  works  proposed  in  the  project  1  towns.  It  is \nenvisaged  that  the  net  environmental  benefits  to  the  population  of  the  three  towns  will  be \npositive  and  significant  as  a  result  of  improved  (i)  water  efficiency  and  security  through  the \nimplementation of NRW reduction programs; and (ii) river water quality through the expansion of \nsewerage  networks,  treatment  capacity,  and  sanitation  coverage.  The  initial  environmental \nexaminations outline a grievance redress mechanism to ensure easy and quick redress of any \ncomplaints  or  concerns  during  project  implementation.  The  environmental  management  plans \nprovide  adequate  mitigation  measures  to  address  temporary  construction  impacts,  including \ntraffic management, to ensure limited disruption to traffic flow and access.22  \n\n \n\n                                                \n21  The  resettlement  plans  outline  objectives,  policies,  principles,  procedures  for  resettlement  and  compensation,  and \nassistance  to  affected  persons.  They  will  be  updated  upon  completion  of  the  engineering  designs.  The  KUIDFC  has \nadequate capacity for preparing and implementing social safeguard measures. An updated resettlement framework and \nHarihar resettlement plan were endorsed by the KUIDFC and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website in February 2014. \n\n22 Construction impacts also include  adequate gravel, sand, and aggregate sourcing; dust and noise generation; and \nconstruction waste runoff. Environmental management plans will be included in all bid documents, and the KUIDFC \nwill monitor their implementation and submit periodic progress reports on environment safeguards to ADB.  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures23 \n\nRisks \nBeneficiaries do not connect \nto sewerage system \n\nULBs are slower at adopting \nIWRM pre-project reforms as \ndescribed in selection process \nTariff set at insufficient levels \n\nMitigating Measures \nInformation and communication campaigns on hygiene and sanitation to change \nbehavior, and provision of toilet programs for economically disadvantaged \nhouseholds, including connections to sewers.
