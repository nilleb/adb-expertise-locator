Water for \nagriculture in the project area currently depends on rainfall. As a result, cropping intensity and \ncrop  yields  are  low.  The  project  will  finance  the  extension  of  Pehur  High  Level  Canal  (PHLC) \nirrigation system, which will become a part of the Indus Basin irrigation system (IBIS). This will \nincrease  agriculture  production  by  increasing  availability  of  water,  improving  water-use \nefficiency and farm management capacity in the project area. The population of the project area \nis about 75,000.2 \n \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nSector  overview.  Improved  water  management  and  agricultural  productivity  are \nfundamental  to  continued  economic  growth  in  KPP.  Over  37%  of  people  are  engaged  in  the \nagriculture  sector,  which  contributes  18%  to  provincial  gross  domestic  product.3 Livestock  and \nagriculture together provide livelihoods to 83% of the people living in the rural areas.4 While the \ncountry\u2019s poverty level has declined significantly, the proportion of population earning less than \n$2.0  per  day  was  still  51%  in  2011.5 The  poverty  in  KPP  is  more  serious  than  at  the  national \nlevel. The poverty headcount ratio in KPP was 29% in fiscal year (FY) 2006; 7% higher than the \nnational average. However, the Government of KPP\u2019s own estimate for FY2009 was far higher \nat  39%.6 Food  security  is  a  continuous  concern  in  KPP.  Of  the  24  districts,  four  districts  are \nclassified as in crisis and 10 districts are classified as stressed as of May 2015.7 \n \nTo reduce poverty, ensure food security, and for the gross national product to reach its \n4. \ntarget  of  7%\u20138%  annual  rate  of  growth,  agriculture  sector  needs  to  grow  at  least  5%  per  \nannum.8 The  agriculture  sector,  however,  has  been  performing  below  its  potential.  Average \nannual growth rate over the 2003\u20132013 period was 3.3%. \n \n5. \nIBIS  is  the  lifeline  of  Pakistan\u2019s  agriculture.  Crop  water  demand  in  IBIS  has  increased \ndramatically  as  a  result  of  higher  cropping  intensity  and  cultivation  of  high  water-consuming \ncrops. Key constraints in agriculture in IBIS include insufficient water availability, inefficient use \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa Water Resources Sector Project (TA 8448-PAK). The PHLCE project, which was identified as one of \ncoresubprojects under the TA was unbundled to process as a stand-alone project. \n\n3  Government of KPP, Bureau of Statistics, Planning & Development Department. 2015.

Official poverty estimates by province have not been released since FY2006. The Ministry of \nFinance estimated the national average poverty at 12.4% in FY2011 in its Economic Survey 2013\u20132014. \n\n7  World  Food  Programme.

The  result  is  based  on  its \n\ndeveloped Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. \n\n8  Ministry  of  National  Food  Security  and  Research.  Agriculture  and  Food  Security  Policy.  Islamabad  (draft). \nThe  Government  of  KPP  also  aims  to  achieve  real  agricultural  growth  rate  of  5%  per  year  over  the  next  decade \naccording to the Government of KPP\u2019s Comprehensive Development Strategy 2010\u20132017.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nof irrigation water, fragmentation of holdings, low crop productivity, post-harvest losses, limited \ninstitutional  capacity  particularly  for  extension  and  research,  poor  condition  of  irrigation  and \ndrainage  systems  with  deficient  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  mainly  due  to  low  cost \nrecovery and limited budgetary allocations. \n \n6. \nAbout 20% of the country\u2019s cultivable land of more than 22.0 million ha is outside IBIS, \nand approximately 3.24 million ha are rain-fed areas.9 The irrigated area in KPP only amounts to \nabout 1.15 million ha of the total cultivable land of 5.73 million ha as of 2013\u20132014. Large part \nof cultivable land is rain-fed, exposing a significant proportion of the rural population to weather-\ninduced  risks.  Without  a  secure  source  of  water,  farming  in  rain-fed  areas  often  results  in  low \nproductivity. \n \nThe  cropping  pattern  in  the  planned  project  area  constitutes  wheat  and  maize  coupled \n7. \nwith  some  pulses  and  oilseeds  under  rain-fed  conditions.  The  annual  effective  rainfall  is  680 \nmillimeters. The annual cropping intensity of 52% and crop yields (e.g., 1.38 t/ha for wheat, 1.06 \nt/ha  for  maize,  and  1.44  t/ha  for  oilseeds)  are  much  lower  than  those  in  PHLC  irrigated  area \n(annual  cropping  intensity  of  162%,  2.29  t/ha  for  wheat,  2.35  t/ha  for  maize,  and  2.0  t/ha  for \noilseeds).10 There are a total of 8,630 farms in the project area with an average size of 1.01 ha. \nOver 84% of the farms are less than 2 ha in size and occupy 52% of the cultivable farmland.11 \n \nIn  KPP,  opportunities  exist  to  bring  an  additional  8.3  million  ha  of  arable  land  under \n8. \nirrigation  and  improve  the  water  and  land  productivity  by  50%\u2013100%.  Construction  of  small \ndams  and  extension  of  existing  irrigation  systems  in  rain-fed  areas  can  develop  irrigated \nagriculture and increase crop yield.12 \n \n9. \nPehur  High  Level  Canal.  The  PHLC  project  started  in  1993  with  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) financing.13 The project realized the full agricultural potential of about 40,300 ha by \n(i) doubling irrigation supplies to about 35,800 ha; (ii) reclaiming about 8,000 ha of waterlogged \nland; and (iii) developing irrigation in about 4,310 ha of mainly rain-fed land. Water allocation for \na potential extension of the irrigation system for the future was planned at the design stage of \nthe project. The project was successfully completed in 2003.14  \n \nClimate  change  impacts.  The  climate  change  projections  for  KPP  show  that  there  is \n10. \nlikely to be an average increase in precipitation of about 5% to 10%. Similarly, temperatures are \nalso expected to rise by about 3oC on average up to the year 2050. Monsoon rainfall is likely to \nincrease, while in other months (e.g., April\u2013May) rainfall is likely to be less and temperatures will \nbe  higher.  These  changes  will  adversely  affect  the  rain-fed  agriculture.  In  10  years,  kharif \nseason  irrigation  supplies  could  increase  as  climate  change  melts  glaciers  of  the  upper  Indus \nRiver basin.15 However, after approximately 50 years, although it will be beyond the lifespan of \n                                                 \n9  Government of Pakistan, Bureau of Statistics. 2013.

Project Completion Report: Pehur High Level Canal Project in Pakistan. Manila. The project was rated \nrelevant,  efficacious,  efficient,  and  less  likely  sustainable  despite  delays  of  project  completion  and  reduced \neconomic returns mainly because of delays in achieving full agricultural development. \n\n15 Kharif is the summer crop-growing season from about April to September. Rabi is the winter crop-growing season \n\nfrom about October to March. \n\n\fthe  investment  assets  of  the  proposed  project,  shortages  will  become  more  severe  as  the \nglaciers are depleted and higher temperatures result in increased evaporation from the storage \nreservoirs and due to significantly higher crop water requirements.16  \n \nThe proposed project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Pakistan, \n11. \n2015\u20132019, which prioritizes the promotion of better water resource management and irrigation \nto  improve  agricultural  productivity,  increase  farm  incomes,  and  ensure  food  security.17 The \nproposed  project  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  for  Pakistan,  2016\u2013\n2018. 18  The  KPP\u2019s  Comprehensive  Development  Strategy  (CDS),  2010\u20132017  targets  new \ncultivable  land  of  70,000  ha  to  meet  the  food  demand  of  KPP\u2019s  growing  population  and \nsuggests  various  measures  in  both  water-supply  and  water-use  to  address  issues  in  the \nagriculture sector.19 \n \n12. \nThe  poor  security  situation  in  KPP  is  a  serious  problem  and  risk  for  project \nimplementation.  One  of  ADB-financed  projects  in  KPP  faced  unusually  harsh  security \nproblems.20 Security concerns of this project have been addressed during its preparation. About \n96% of the project areas are located in the Swabi district which has a lower security risk.21  \n \n13. \nThe proposed project reflects the lessons learned from the PHLC project: (i) insufficient \nconsultant inputs hampered smooth project implementation; and (ii) complicated implementation \narrangements  caused  delays  in  the  delivery  of  project  physical  outputs  and  resulted  in  major \ngaps in ownership and operations of the project causing unnecessary cost overruns and further \ndelays at loan closing. \n\n \nIrrigation water in the PHLCE system will be released from the existing Gandaf Tunnel at \n14. \nTarbela Dam. It will then be carried to farmlands through two pressure pipelines, leading to two \nmain canals, distributary canals, minors, and watercourses.  \n \nB. \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\n15. \nThe  project  impacts,  which  are  aligned  with  CDS  (footnote  19)  will  be  the  following:  (i) \nincreased  irrigated  area,  and  (ii)  ensured  food  security  for  2010\u20132020.  The  outcome  will  be \nincreased agricultural production in the project areas. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nOutput 1: Available agricultural water in project areas increased. This includes the \n16. \nfollowing  components:  (i)  construction  of  the  irrigation  system  in  the  Janda  Boka\u2013Malikabad \narea  (JBMA),  (ii)  construction  of  the  irrigation  system  in  the  Indus  Ambar  area  (IAA),  and  (iii) \ndevelopments  of  efficient  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  system  and  sustainable  PHLCE \nO&M plan and its guidelines.  \n\n                                                 \n16 Climate  Change  Risk  Vulnerability  and  Adaptation  Assessment  Report  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n17 ADB. 2015.

It reports that project offices were blasted; staff members were killed, injured, and kidnapped; \nand project vehicles and resources were looted. \n\n21 As of October 2015, nine districts were rated very high or high security risk areas according to the United Nations \n\nTravel Modality. Swabi is not one of them. \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n17. \nThe  first  component  will  supply  gravity  irrigation  water  to  1,316  ha  in  JBMA,  and  the \nsecond to 7,411 ha in IAA, to transform those areas from rain-fed to irrigated agriculture. These \ncomprise  (i)  connection  with  the  existing  Gandaf  Tunnel  at  Tarbela  Dam  by  constructing  two \noutlets  (one  for  JBMA  and  another  for  IAA);  (ii)  construction  of  two  pressure  pipelines  \n(approximately  4  kilometers  [km]  for  JBMA  and  24  km  for  IAA)  and  associated  structures;  (iii) \nconstruction  of  two  main  canals  (approximately  11  km  for  JBMA  and  27  km  for  IAA)  with \nassociated structures (e.g., outlets, syphons, drainage crossings, aqueducts, drainage culverts, \nsuper  passages,22 and  bridges);  and  (iv)  construction  of  one minor  and  20  outlets  for  JBMA,23 \nand one distributary, seven minors, and 87 outlets for IAA. \n \n18. \nThe  PHLCE\u2019s  estimated  overall  irrigation  efficiency  will  be  about  65%  with  a  field \nefficiency of about 75%. The capacity of IAA canals will ensure flexibility to extend the irrigated \narea of around 1,400 ha in the future, and sufficient canal capacity has been confirmed against \nthe  climate  change  risks  anticipated  during  2015\u20132065.  The  design  capacity  of  drainage \nchannels incorporate the risk of the increase in flood events predicted due to climate change. \n \n19. \nThe  third  component  will  develop  the  M&E  system  using  satellite  remote  sensing \ntechnology  to  assess  irrigation  efficiency. 24 The  staff  of  the  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  Irrigation \nDepartment (KPID) and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Agriculture Department (KPAD) will be trained \nto  use  the  system.  The  system  will  also  help  KPAD  assess  crop-growing,  and  KPID  assess \nwater productivity and abiana with expected collection from farmers more than the average rate \nof 50%\u201360% in KPP.25 A guideline and sustainable plan of PHLCE O&M with KPP\u2019s committed \nbudget allocation (para.41) will also be developed. \n \n20. \nOutput  2:  Water-use  skill  and  farm  management  capacity  improved  in  project \nareas.  This  output  will  further  improve  agricultural  benefits  resulting  from  output  1  and  (i) \nconstruct  watercourses,  (ii)  form  and  build  capacity  of  water  users\u2019  associations  (WUAs),  and \n(iii)  train  farmers  for  more  profitable  farming  systems  and  efficient  water  use  skills  through \ndemonstration activities and farmer field schools (FFSs). \n \n21. \nThe first component will construct around 106 watercourses (20 in JBMA and 86 in IAA) \nin  cooperation  with  beneficiaries  who  will  provide  land  and  unskilled  labor.  The  second \ncomponent will form and train one WUA for each watercourse. A manual will be developed to \noutline WUA formation and functions, and efficient watercourse O&M. \n \nThe  third  component  will  demonstrate  high-efficiency  irrigation  system  and  more \n22. \nprofitable irrigated farming system. In the first year of its activity, 50 plots will demonstrate more \nprofitable farming system.

KPAD  will  establish  the  project  implementation  office  that  will  be \nresponsible for implementing output 2 under PMO\u2019s supervision. Since 2006, KPID has had no \nexperience  of  implementing  a  project  financed  by  multilateral  financing  institutions.  Therefore, \nADB on behalf of KPID will select the project implementation consultant (PIC) to support PMO \nwith  its  expected  mobilization  in  the  first  quarter  2017.27 All  funds  will  be  channeled  through \nPMO.

The implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in PAM. \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements\nJanuary 2017\u2013December 2022\nDecember 2022 (physical completion) (loan closing date of June 2023)\n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Implementing agency \n(iv)  Project management office \n(v)  Project implementation \n\noffice \nProcurement \n \n \nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \nDisbursement \n\nProject Steering Committee: Chair: Additional Chief secretary of the Planning \nand Development Department \nMembers: Secretaries of KPID and KPAD, P&DD officials, member of Board of \nRevenue, project coordinator, project director, one member of district \nadministration, one representative from Swabi district, and team leader of the \nconsultant\nKPID \nKPAD \n21 staff in the Swabi district \n16 staff in the Swabi district \n\nICB (works) \nNCB \nShopping \nQCBS \n\n1 contract \n4 contracts \nMultiple \n18 person-months international \n796 person-months national \n\n$45.45 million \n$5.31 million \n$0.324 million \n$5.24 million \n\nAdvance contracting will be used and retroactive financing has been requested \nfor the engagement of the project implementation consultant. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time), and detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICB = international competitive bidding, KPAD = Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Agriculture \nDepartment,  KPID  =  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  Irrigation  Department,  NCB  =  national  competitive  bidding,  P&DD  = \nPlanning and Development Department, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n27. \nThe project areas were carefully chosen and the pressure pipelines were appropriately \ndesigned so that irrigation water can be supplied with gravity to minimize O&M requirement. The \nproject was found to be at high risk because of anticipated climate change impacts. The climate \nrisk  and  vulnerability  were  assessed  based  on  the  climate  change  risk  simulation  using  the \nresult  of  global  circulation  models.  Adaptation  measures  were  incorporated  into  the  project \ndesign to reduce the risks resulting from increased flood events.  \n \n\n                                                 \n27 The KPID has been advised that the KPID retains the responsibility for negotiating and signing the contract with the \n\nconsultant, issuing the notice to proceed, and supervising the consultant\u2019s services. \n\n\fB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n28. \nThe project is expected to be economically viable in that the overall calculated economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) is 16.1% and the economic net present value of the investment is \nPRs1,602 million at a discount rate of 12%. These robust economic results are expected due to \nthe  substantial  size  of  the  economic  benefit  stream  resulting  from  the  prudent  project  design \nand high agricultural production potential in the project area.28 \n \nA number of risk variables have been used to conduct a sensitivity analysis. Based on \n29. \nthe analysis, the project viability is most sensitive to benefits being delayed by 2 years, by which \nEIRR would fall to 12.8% just marginally above the benchmark of 12%. The level of decrease at \nwhich EIRR would fall below the acceptable 12% level is only 6 years. Therefore, it is essential \nthat the project is implemented as scheduled, and technical and agricultural extension support is \nprovided  to  project  beneficiaries  to  ensure  project  benefits  are  realized  on  schedule.  It  is  also \nimportant  to  stress  that  system  O&M  needs  to  be  carried  out  appropriately  to  ensure  that  the \nbenefits can materialize as estimated. \n \n30. \nAccording  to  CDS,  the  minimum  maintenance  requirements  of  the  KPP  irrigation \nsystems ranged between PRs600 million and PRs900 million per year from 2003/04 to 2008/09 \nwhile  the  budget  allocation  in  the  same  period  ranged  between  PRs160  million  and  PRs300 \nmillion  only.  During  financial  sustainability  assessment  in  2016,  annual  PHLCE  O&M \nrequirement was estimated at $630,000 (PRs66 million). The Government of KPP has assured \nto  allocate  adequate  resources  to  fully  implement  O&M  plan  to  be  developed  under  output  1 \nafter  completion  of  physical  works.  During  the  development  of  O&M  plan,  adequacy  of  O&M \nrequirement will be reassessed and reconfirmed.29 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nidentified \n\nin  using \n\nthe  country\u2019s  public \n\nfinancial \n31.  Weaknesses  and  risks  were \nmanagement  system  in  internal  control,  accounting,  procurement  management,  financial \nrecording and reporting, and external scrutiny and audit. While the financial management risk is \nrated medium, it will be mitigated by various measures, including engagement of accountants in \nPMO  and  provision  of  training  on  financial  reporting  and  auditing.  While  the  overall  project \nprocurement  risk  is  rated  high,  it  will  be  moderate  to  low  after  the  mitigation  measures  are  in \nplace.  KPID\u2019s  insufficient  experience  in  international  competitive  bidding  and  procurement \ncapacity  to  follow  ADB  procurement  guidelines  will  remain  a  challenge.  However,  only  one \ninternational  competitive  bidding  will  be  required  which  PMO  will  manage.  The  PMO\u2019s  project \nmanagement  capacity,  including  procurement  and  financial management,  will  be strengthened \nby PIC. In addition, ADB procurement consultant will assist PMO and PIC in timely, efficient and \ntransparent  procurement.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  and  discussed  with  the  government,  KPID,  and  KPAD.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in PAM (footnote 26). \n \n\n                                                 \n28 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 O&M  fund  allocation  for  the  original  PHLC  system  was  estimated  at  PRs31  million;  however,  it  was  confirmed \nduring project preparation that the O&M of the system was carried out in a reasonable manner despite only PRs8.6 \nmillion  being  allocated  for  O&M  in  2015.  A  reasonable  O&M  was  realized  with  limited  funds  mainly  because  the \ncanal design required less O&M and considerably less sediment load along canals, as the source of water is the \nTarbela Dam, compared with other systems where water is drawn from rivers. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n32. \nClassified  as  general  intervention,  the  project  will  indirectly  contribute  towards  poverty \nreduction  and  economic  growth  for  about  75,000  people  in  the  project  area.  The  project  will \nlargely  benefit  the  small  and  poor  farmers  (para.  7).  The  PHLCE  construction  will  have \nsignificant  economic  benefits,  with  increased  agricultural  productivity,  farm  incomes,  and \nemployment opportunities. The project will give preference to the engagement of local labor in \nconstruction work through instructions in contracts and bidding documents. To further maximize \nthe  benefits,  the  project  will  organize  local  farmers  through  WUAs  and  ensure  that  there  is  a \nmechanism  in  place  for  equitable  and  efficient  distribution  of  water.  Farmers\u2019  capacity  in \nprofitable farming systems will be improved through demonstration activities and FFSs. \n \nBased  on  findings  of  the  gender  analysis,  women  have  limited  scope  to  participate  as \n33. \nactive  players  in  the  project.  The  project  is,  therefore,  classified  as  having  some  gender \nelements,  which  will  require  gender  actions  and  measures  in  the  project  implementation  and \ndesign.  A  gender  action  plan  has  been  prepared  to  ensure  that  (i)  women\u2019s  concerns  are \naddressed  during  the  design  and  construction  of  the  irrigation  canals  through  separate \nconsultations;  (ii)  provisions  are  made  for  the  skills  development  of  women  farmers  in \nagriculture techniques and efficient on-farm practices; and (iii) gender-responsive resettlement, \nland  acquisition,  and  compensation  mechanisms  are  in  place  to  facilitate  affected  women. \nThese activities will be monitored through the project\u2019s M&E system. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment (category A). The project will draw on available water resources from the \n34. \nTarbela  reservoir  and  within  the  existing  water  use  permits  for  PHLC,  and  will  have  an \ninsignificant impact on overall water resource availability in the project area and in the Tarbela \nreservoir.  The  environmental  impacts  will  be  restricted  to  the  construction  phase  and  can  be \nmanaged  through  environmental  mitigation  measures  provided  in  the  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA) and the environmental management plan (EMP).  Two rounds of community \nconsultations  were  held  during  the  EIA  process.  To  address  community  concerns  about \nenvironmental  impacts,  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  established  with  community \nfocal persons. Due to the large scale of project activities, and since it is a new irrigation scheme, \nthe  project  is  classified  as  category  A  for  environment.  EIA  has  been  disclosed  on  the  ADB \nwebsite  on  9  March  2016.  PMO  will  have  an  environment  and  social  unit  and  one  full-time \nenvironment  specialist.  PIC  will  have  one  part-time  international,  and  one  full-time  national \nenvironment specialist, and provide capacity support to PMO. PMO will ensure that the design \nand construction are carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), \nthe applicable environmental laws and regulations of Pakistan, and EIA and its EMP. KPID will \nensure that potential adverse environmental impacts arising from the project are minimized by \nimplementing all the mitigation measures in EMP. Should any change in scope take place, KPID \nwill  inform  ADB  and  a  due  diligence  on  the  environment  will  be  carried  out,  following  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  Any  unanticipated  environmental  impacts  will  be  reviewed  and  a \ncorrective  action  plan  prepared  by  the  contractor  for  implementation  under  the  PMO\u2019s \nsupervision with PIC\u2019s assistance. \n \n35. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  A).  The  project  is  classified  as  category  A  for \ninvoluntary  resettlement  because  approximately  125  households  will  either  be  physically \ndisplaced or lose 10% or more of their productive assets. Approximately, 219 ha of land will be \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\facquired  under  the  project.30 More  than  400  households  are  likely  to  lose  land  and/or  other \nassets. KPID has endorsed a draft land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) prepared by \nthe project preparatory TA consultants based on a preliminary alignment of the irrigation system \nand  consultations  with  potentially  displaced  households  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement.  The  draft  LARP  was  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  20  June  2016.  Information \nbrochures  on  the  draft  LARP  in  the  local  language  will  be  disseminated  to  potential  displaced \npersons.  KPID,  with  support  from  PIC,  will  update  LARP  based  on  the  approved  design  and \nalignment after proper notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act of 1894. \n \n36. \nLand acquisition and resettlement activities will be managed and implemented by KPID, \nthrough  PMO,  in  coordination  with  the  Board  of  Revenue.  Given  KPID\u2019s  limited  experience  in \nhandling  resettlement  issues  in  externally  financed  projects,  the  PIC\u2019s  social  safeguard \nmanagement  team  will  support  PMO  in  developing  and  maintaining  a  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  database  and  management  information  system.  The  team  will  also  update  and \nimplement  LARP,  including  facilitation  of  possible  land  swapping  and  land  consolidation.  A \nfunctioning grievance redress mechanism will be established. Internal monitoring reports will be \nprepared  by  PMO  and  PIC  on  a  semiannual  basis.  A  qualified  and  experienced  external \nmonitoring  agency,  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  verify  these  internal  monitoring  reports,  identify \nissues, and recommend corrective measures if needed. All monitoring reports will be disclosed \non  the  ADB  website.  ADB  will  also  help  KPID  and  PMO  conduct  the  external  monitoring  of \nsafeguards compliance by recruiting the individual consultants as necessary.   \n \n37. \nIndigenous peoples (category C).  There are no indigenous peoples in the project area \nas defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. No indigenous communities will be affected \nby the project and, accordingly, no indigenous peoples planning document is required. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n38.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.31 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nproject are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInternal control for non-salary expenditure is less \neffective, internal audit is not effective, and there is a \nneed to strengthen the use of professional audit \nmethods and compliance with International Standards \nfor the Professional Practice in Internal Audit. \nLack of experience of agency in international \ncompetitive bidding contracts. \n\nNo dedicated procurement unit and insufficient staff, \nand no fully functional PMO \nIncreases in agricultural water demand and flood risk \ndue to climate change impact were identified. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nCapacity building will be provided to improve internal \ncontrol.
