The \nsubsequent two phases, subject to request by the Government, will \nbe implemented back to back during the period 2006\u20132010. \n \nThe  public  administration  system  in  Viet  Nam  is  characterized  by \nvarious  weaknesses.  These  include:  (i) inefficient  and  ineffective \ninstitutional  setups,  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  that  do  not \nadequately  support,  and  in  many  cases  hinder,  the  socioeconomic \ndevelopment  initiatives  of  the  country;  (ii) organizational  systems \nand processes that are generally cumbersome, highly bureaucratic, \nand  opaque;  (iii) a  poorly  paid  civil  service  characterized  by \npervasive rent-seeking behavior, and constrained by inefficiencies in \nmanagement; and (iv) a public finance system not fully equipped to \nmeet  the  complex  fiscal  and  financial  challenges  of  a  fast-growing \neconomy integrating into the global market. \n \nSince 1986, with the adoption of the policy of renovation or Doi Moi \nthat has included an extensive reform agenda, Viet Nam has been \nin transition, moving from a centrally planned to a socialist-oriented \nmarket  economy.  While  tangible  progress  has  been  achieved \nthrough the structural and economic reforms, the country continues \nto face many of the major socioeconomic problems and challenges \nof an economy in transition.  \n \nThe  Government \nthe  country\u2019s \ndevelopment goals, including those contained in its Comprehensive \nPoverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGS),  speedier  and \nmore effective reform of the public administration is now of strategic \nimportance.  \n \nThe overall objective of the program loan proposal (the program) is \nto  support  and  facilitate  the  implementation  of  the  Government's \nPAR  MP and to assist in building a professional, modern, effective \nand  efficient  administration  system  for  the  Borrower.  The  program \n\nrecognizes \n\nrealize \n\nthat \n\nto \n\n \nObjectives and Scope \n\n\fii\n\n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2003\u20132005;  \n2006\u20132008; and \n2008\u20132010 \n\nwill  finance  implementation  of  two  of  the  seven  PAR  action \nprograms  (APs):  (i) training  and  retraining  to  improve  the  quality  of \npublic  officials  under  AP  no. 4;  and  (ii) modernization  of  the \nadministrative system, including computerization and e-government \ninitiatives under AP no. 7. \n \nThe  cost  of  implementing  six  APs  (including  APs  no. 4  and  no. 7), \nbased on the information available, is estimated to be $141.8 million \nfor 2003\u20132005. The AP on salary reform is not included as it is not \nyet  clear  what  precise  proposal  will  be  implemented.  The  costs  of \nimplementing  AP  no. 4  (training)  and  AP  no. 7  (administrative \nmodernization)  are  estimated  to  be  $28.2  million  and  $60  million \nrespectively, based on the measures and actions listed in the policy \nmatrix, during the period 2003\u20132005. \n \nThe program cluster covers three phases of loan financing and TA \nsupport for the PAR MP implementation during the period 2003\u2013\n2010, as follows: \n \nPhase I: \nPhase II: \nPhase III: \n \nThis  loan  proposal  is  for  the  first  phase  covering  the  period  2003\u2013\n2005 for an amount totaling $45 million. This amount is expected to \nbe  disbursed  before  the  end  of  2005.  The  loan  for  Phase  I  will  be \nreleased  in  two  tranches  and  utilized  before  the  end  of  2005.  The \nfirst  tranche  will  be  available  upon  loan  effectiveness;  the  second \ntranche will be released upon satisfactory compliance with specified \ntranche release measures and actions indicated in the policy matrix. \n \nFunding  proposals  and  proposed  measures  and  actions  for  Phase \nII,  based  on  the  progress  and  performance  of  implementation  of \nPhase  I,  will  be  presented  for  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nBoard consideration during the latter part of 2005, and for Phase III \nby mid-2008. \n \nVarious specific policy measures and actions are included in Phase \nI.  A  number  of  relevant  general  measures  and  actions  have  also \nbeen  indicated  for  phases  II  and  III.  For  Phase  I,  some  of  these \nmeasures  and  actions  have  been  specified  as  tranche  release \nmeasures and actions. They will also form the basis of performance \nassessment for consideration of loan financing into phases II and III, \nsubsequently. \n \nThe  first  phase  of  the  program  cluster  will  involve  an  equivalent  of \n$45  million  in  various  currencies  of  special  drawing  rights  (SDR), \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  a  term  of  24  years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years  and  an  interest  rate  of  1.0% \nduring the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \n \n\n\fPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Program \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agencies \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \nGrants \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nUntil December 2005 \n \n31 December 2005 \n\n \nMinistry of Home Affairs (MOHA) and the Office of the Government \n(OOG)  will  be  joint  executing  agencies  for  the  program  under  the \nover-all leadership of the Prime Minister.  \n \nMOHA  and  OOG  will  be  jointly  responsible  for  implementing  the \npolicy  and  institutional  measures  and  actions  under  part  A  of  the \npolicy  matrix.  MOHA  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  the \nimplementation of the policy and institutional measures and actions \nunder  AP  no. 4  (part  B  of  the  policy  matrix)  while  OOG  will  be  the \nimplementing agency for measures and actions under AP no. 7 (part \nC of the policy matrix).  \n \nTo  ensure  the  effective  handling  of  this  implementing  agency  role \nand \nresponsibility,  program  management  units  have  been \nestablished within MOHA and OOG.  \n \nThe  High-Level  Coordinating  Committee  (HLCC),  which  was \nestablished  for  the  formulation  of  the  program,  will  continue  and \nmeet formally at least once every quarter to monitor implementation \nprogress. \n \nThe  proceeds  from  the  program  loan  will  be  utilized  for  procuring \ngoods  and  services  produced  and  originating  in  ADB  member \ncountries,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in \naccordance  with  standard  public  procurement  procedures  in  Viet \nNam and normal private sector commercial practices acceptable to \nADB. \n \nThe proceeds of the proposed program loan will be disbursed for a \nbroad range of imports, subject to a negative list of ineligible items. \nLoan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  on  the  basis  of  a  certification \nprovided by the Borrower, confirming that in each year in which the \nproposed  program  loan  is  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of \ntotal \nfrom  nonmember  countries, \n(ii) ineligible  imports,  and  (iii) imports  financed  under  other  official \ndevelopment  assistance,  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount \nexpected to be disbursed during the year. \n \nWhile \nthe  overall  PAR  design  and \nimplementation  program  will  benefit  from  TA  already  provided  by \nother funding bodies within a framework coordinated by the United \nNations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  additional  TAs  are \nnecessary  to  cover  specific  policy  and  technical  areas  that  are \ncritical  to  ensure  the  success  of  the  program  specifically,  and  the \nPAR MP generally.  \n \n \n\nthe  key  elements  of \n\nimports  minus \n\n(i) imports \n\n \n\n\fiv\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nto  assist \n\nresourced,  and  staffed \n\nThree specific areas of need are to be addressed over a 30-month \nperiod  through  TA  linked  directly  to  the  program.  These  include: \n(i) institutional  and  capacity-building  support  to  MOHA  for  the \nimplementation  of  the  training  and  retraining  AP,  including  human \nresources  development  and  public  service  delivery  reforms,  in  an \namount of $920,000, to be co-financed by ADB and the Government \nof  France;  (ii) support  to  OOG  in  the  implementation  of  the \nadministrative  modernization  AP,  including  computerization  and  e-\ngovernment initiatives, in an amount of $1.27 million to be financed \nby ADB; and (iii) policy coordination support to OOG, in an amount \nof $815,000 to be co-financed by ADB and the Government of New \nZealand. Further co-financing possibility is being explored. \n \nTeams  of  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be  mobilized \nfor  each  TA.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  as  individuals  in \naccordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants, \nincluding procedures acceptable to the ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants. \n \nThe  intended  reforms  will  bring  certain  benefits,  including  a  more \naccountable,  responsive,  and  efficient  public  sector  that  is  better \norganized,  structured, \nthe \nGovernment in achieving its objectives. This is expected to lead to \nbudgetary savings in the public administration system as a result of \nimproved  institutional  efficiency,  such  as  will  flow  both  from  having \nbetter  trained,  more  professional,  and  better  skilled  civil  servants \nand  from  the  impact  of  computerization.  It  will  also  bring  indirect \nbenefits  through  reducing  transaction  costs  and  opportunities  for \nrent seeking while freeing private sector time and resources to deal \nwith production issues rather than with \u201cred tape\u201d.  \n \nThough the poor have a relatively better social standing in Viet Nam \nthan  in  most  countries  at  comparable  income  levels,  they  still \nconstitute  the  socially  and  politically  weakest  group.  They  are  the \nleast  able  to  handle  rent  seeking,  or  to  cut  through  red  tape. \nUndesirable  arbitrary  bureaucratic  behavior  most  directly  hinders \ntheir economic endeavors. Thus, the poor and the vulnerable should \nbe  the  greatest  beneficiaries  of  the  strengthened  and  accelerated \nreforms assisted by the program.  \n \nThe  program  entails  three  types  of  risks:  some  of  the  necessary \nmeasures  may  not  be  agreed;  some  of  the  agreed  measures  may \nnot be carried out; and some may be carried out but with unintended \nimpacts. The first type of risk is due particularly to the fact that the \nprogram  does  not  necessarily  constitute  an  ideal  set  of  reform \nmeasures  aimed  at \ntransformation  or \nmodernization  of  Viet  Nam's  public  administration.  Given  the \ncountry-specific  considerations,  the  program  focuses  on  a  set  of \nmeasures that are feasible, on which consensus could be reached, \nand  that,  if  properly  sequenced  and  effectively  implemented,  will \nbring  gradual  but  tangible  improvements.  In  regard  to  the  second \n\nthe  swiftest  possible \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nto  slow  and \n\ntemporarily  hinder \n\ntype  of  risk,  resistance  naturally  exists  to  a  program  that  both \ntargets  the  civil  service  and  is  to  be  implemented  by  it,  and  this  is \nlikely \nindividual  program \ncomponents.  A  sustained  program  of  information,  publicity,  and \nconsultation  between  key  stakeholders  that  is  included  in  the \nprogram is intended to help reduce and overcome such resistance. \nThe  third  type  of  risk  is  more  difficult  to  analyze.  Some  program \ncomponents  may  have  unintended  and  unexpected  negative \nconsequences.  Some  of  these  may  well  be  potentially  more \ndamaging  to  the  economy  and  the  population,  and  to  continuing \nreforms themselves, than delays.  \n \nTo minimize these three types of risk, the program carefully avoids \nendorsing  vaguely  defined  actions.  It  also  provides  for  early \nanalytical  efforts  intended  to  detect  possible  negative  impacts  and \nthus avoid them. To further help ensure success, a monitoring and \nevaluation  system  and  a  management  information  system  are  also \nbeing  established  at  MOHA.  Provisions  have  also  been  made  for \ncareful  tranching  of  the  program  and  for  regularly  sharing  and \ndiscussing  issues  with  ADB.  ADB  also  intends  to  deploy  a  higher \nthan normal specialist staff input to support the Government in this \ncomplex  monitoring  effort.  All  these  measures  should  help  bring \nunintended  delays  as  well  as  possible  unforeseen  negative \nconsequences  to  the  early  attention  of  the  Government  and  ADB, \nand thus help reduce risks by generating early corrective actions.   \n \nAdequate resourcing of reform implementation will also be essential \nfor  success  and  assurances  have  been  sought \nthe \nGovernment  on  this  point.  Implementation  must  be  managed  in  a \npractical, \nthat \nadjustments may be required in light of experience and that it will be \nessential to manage properly the linkages between the various parts \nof the reforms. \n\nrealistic,  and  sequenced  way, \n\nrecognition \n\nfrom \n\nin \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i) a  proposed \nprogram cluster concept to Support Implementation of the Public Administration Reform (PAR) \nMaster Program (MP) in Viet Nam, (ii) a proposed loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for \nPhase  I  of  the  support  covering  the  period  2003\u20132005  (the  program),  and  (iii) a  proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  grant  for  support  to  the  Office  of  the  Government  (OOG)  in  the \nimplementation  of  administrative  modernization  including  computerization  and  e-government \ninitiatives.  The  report  also  describes  two  other  proposed  TAs,  for  (i) institutional  and  capacity \nbuilding support to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA), and (ii) policy coordination support to \nOOG; and including the administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of the portions of \nthe TAs to be financed by the Governments of New Zealand and France. If the proposed loan \nand TA are approved by the Board, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \nshall approve these two TAs.  \n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\nReforms Followed by Rapid Progress \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nWith the adoption of the policy of renovation, Doi Moi, since 1986 Viet Nam has been in \ntransition from a centrally planned to a socialist-oriented market economy. Viet Nam\u2019s economy \nhas  undergone  radical  changes,  achieving  almost  unparalleled  socioeconomic  success:  fast \noverall  growth,  substantial  poverty  reduction,  and  further  social  development,  including \nincreased  school  attendance,  improvements  in  the  relative  status  of  women,  and  sharp \nreductions  in  illiteracy.  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  8% \nduring  the  1990s,  with  household  per  capita  consumption  growing  at  7.2%.  Since  1992,  Viet \nNam  has  followed  prudent  fiscal  and  monetary  policies,  resulting  in  price  stability  and  a \ngenerally  stable  macroeconomy.  The  overall  consequent  development  has  been  largely \nequitable.  \n \nThe domestic private sector, largely made up of very small productive units, has become \n3.  \nthe main source of GDP with a contribution of 44%. It now accounts for nearly 25% of the labor \nforce,  or  up  to  86%  if  private  agriculture  is  included.  Particularly  since  business  registration \nrequirements were eased in 1999, household enterprises have proliferated and the number of \nformal private enterprises has nearly doubled. However, the potential for the development of the \nprivate sector remains to be more fully realized, as it is concentrated in a few industries. Some \nof  the  main  obstacles  to  private  sector  development  include  contradictory  and  unevenly \nenforced  legislation;  cumbersome  and  arbitrary  administrative  and  taxation  systems;  difficult \naccess to land, credit, and business information; and inadequate physical infrastructure. State-\nowned  enterprises  (SOEs)  still  dominate  industrial  production.  With  regard  to  SOEs,  while  the \nGovernment  recognizes  the  need  for  reforms,  only  modest  progress  has  been  achieved  in \nrecent years. This also holds true for state-owned commercial banks.  \n \n4. \nThe  dollar  value  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  exports  rose  sixfold  from  1990  to  2002  and  they  have \nreoriented from the former centrally planned economies to East Asia, the European Union, and, \nincreasingly, North America. Export growth has been led by light manufacturing exports and by \nagriculture  as  Viet  Nam  turned  from  being  a  food  importer  into  a  leading  exporter  of  several \nmajor agricultural products, with attendant benefits to the employment and incomes of the poor. \nAn  early  surge  of  petroleum  exports  also  contributed  to  easing  foreign  exchange  and  budget \n\n\f2\n\n \n\nChallenges Ahead \n\nconstraints. The potential gains of traditional light industries, agriculture, and fisheries, however, \nremain far from exhausted. \n \n5. \nThe early years of Doi Moi benefited from the general dynamism of the East Asia region. \nPrivate capital inflows into Viet Nam rose sharply in the early 1990s but declined during the mid-\n1990s,  especially  following  the  1997  Asian  financial  crisis.  Their  recovery  in  recent  years  has \nbeen partial.  \n \nB.  \n \n6. \nThe nature and urgency of the challenges, which Viet Nam now faces, are illustrated by \nrecent  developments.  GDP  growth  was  down  to  5.8%  in  2001,  and  is  estimated  at  5.7%  for \n2002 and 6.2% for 2003. While these growth rates are among the highest worldwide, they fall \nwell short of what is needed to achieve the goal of doubling GDP between 2001 and 2010.1 The \nrecent slowdown in growth is all the more worrying as the weighted dollar price of agricultural \nexports fell by more than 20% in 2001, with rice, coffee, pepper, rubber, cashew-nuts, tea, and \ngroundnuts  all  contributing  to  this.2  The  impact  is  all  the  stronger  as  the  terms  of  trade  have \nmoved strongly against Viet Nam. The price of Viet Nam\u2019s coffee exports has declined by more \nthan 60% in the past 3 years. This phenomenon does not only affect the balance of payments \nand fiscal receipts, it also directly bears on the incomes of rural households for which there are \nfew immediate alternatives, particularly in the uplands and highlands, where Viet Nam\u2019s ethnic \nminorities and many of its poorest people are concentrated. \n \n7. \nThe  constraints  on  agricultural  export  growth,  and  the  low  wages  on  which  many  light \nindustry exports are predicated, point to the need to deepen and diversify Viet Nam's economic \ndevelopment. This is one of the objectives of the Government, which wants to move Viet Nam to \nat  least  middle-income  status  by  2025.  To  continue  to  achieve  sustainable,  robust  rates  of \neconomic  growth,  Viet  Nam,  like  other  countries  in  the  region  before  it,  must  enable  all \neconomic agents to contribute to development by engaging in the activities most in keeping with \nits  comparative  advantage.  In  particular,  the  further  development  of  the  multisector  economy \nand  the  growth  of  enterprises  outside  of  the  public  sector  need  to  be  encouraged.  However, \ntheir success and their attractiveness to needed foreign investment remain critically dependent \non the Government establishing a more favorable legal and administrative environment.  \n \n8.  \nViet  Nam\u2019s  leaders,  after  intensive  debate  over  economic  strategy  and  its  implications, \nhave  decided  that  adaptation  and  continued  fast,  sustainable,  and  equitable  development \n(i) increased \nrequire \ncompetitiveness of the economy; (ii) a focus on human resources development; (iii) renovation \nof  the  public  administration  system;  and  (iv) further  integration  into  the  regional  and  global \neconomies as concretized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free Trade \nArea  (AFTA),  the  bilateral  trade  agreement  with  the  United  States  (already  signed),  and  the \ndeclared goal of accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).  \n \n9. \nThe benefits of global integration, however, accrue to economies whose competitiveness \nis not undermined by the artificial burdens and high transaction costs of \u201cred tape\u201d and general \nmaladministration.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  public  administration,  concentrating  on  appropriate \nresponsibilities,  must  contribute  more  effectively  to  the  country\u2019s  transformation  into  an \n\nfollowing  strategic  priorities,  namely: \n\nfocused  attention  on \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n1  Government  of  Vietnam.  2001.

Numerous  improvements  are  specifically \ndemanded  by  bilateral  and  regional  trade  agreements  that  Viet  Nam  has  already  signed,  and \naccession to the WTO which is one of the country\u2019s explicitly stated goals. Those goals alone \nwould  justify  thoroughgoing  reforms.  New  trade  rules  and  even  greater  competition  will  force \nsome activities to cease, and others to adapt through higher productivity\u2014and that means lower \nemployment  per  unit  of  output.  This  process  is both  disruptive  and  beneficial,  but  the  benefits \nare  reaped  sustainably  if  good  governance  and  efficient  administration  facilitate  adaptation \nthrough  new  investment  and  new  or  fast-growing  activities.  All  these  also  require  fostering \ninnovation  and  adaptability\u2014qualities  incompatible  with  the  excessive  bureaucraticism  that \ncharacterizes  Viet  Nam\u2019s  public  administration.  The  role  of  the  Government  in  this  is  far  from \nlimited  to  avoiding  itself  standing  in  the  way  of  the  private  sector.  Swifter  adaptation  needs  a \ndiverse range of areas of active government intervention, from appropriate and enabling policy \nframeworks and effective regulatory mechanisms to provision of efficient infrastructure and the \neffective delivery of public services. This is the context in which the Government has renewed \nits  determination  to  reform  the  public  administration  as  a  necessary  condition  for  Viet  Nam  to \nattain its national development goals. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\n \nA. \n \n\nThe Public Administration System \n\n1. \n\nOverview \n\n \n10.  With  Doi  Moi,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  public  administration  has  undergone  some  major  changes, \nalbeit not as far-reaching as that of its economy. Reforms carried out since the late 1980s have \nsubstantially reduced the scope of government intervention in household and personal activities, \nin circumscribing social behavior, and in economic life. The intensity and extent of the changes \nare embedded in the role that the public sector has played over the past decade in the country\u2019s \nrecord of robust economic growth, social progress, and poverty reduction.  \n \nTraditionally,  the  public  sector  occupied  the  bulk  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  social  space.  With  Doi \n11. \nMoi, its intervention in most aspects of society has fallen, even as it has built up its interventions \nin some needed areas, such as infrastructure development and poverty reduction. For instance, \nthere was little need for many of the traditional activities of a customs administration when the \nstate  alone  traded;  immigration  officers  when  there  was  little  foreign  travel;  or  even  for  traffic \nrules when there were few mechanized vehicles. In recent years, however, laws and regulations \nhave been changed, and efforts made to adapt policies and service delivery mechanisms with \nthe changing role of the state. Financial management has been tightened, halting the taxation of \nsociety  through  inflation  that  had  characterized  the  previous  decade,  and  preventing  its \nrecurrence. The Government now emphasizes the need for the public administration to reduce \nits traditional extensive and intrusive, hands-on interventions and to move to the formulation and \nimplementation  of  policies  to  indirectly  influence  private  behavior.  An  overriding  goal  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s PAR MP3 is to reorient the role of the state, \"from rowing to steering\u201d, as the PAR \nMP itself puts it, as Viet Nam progresses in its transition to a socialist-oriented market economy. \n \n12. \nHowever,  developing  the  good  mechanisms  and  habits  of  \u201csteering\u201d  is  no  less  difficult \nthan  abandoning  the  old  habits  of  \u201crowing\u201d.  Notwithstanding  the  efforts  at  reform  to  date,  the \nreorientation and renovation of the systems and machinery of government remain at best only \n                                                 \n3  Approved by the Prime Minister in September 2001, covering the period 2001\u20132010. \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\npartial.  The  first  wave  of  reforms  that  characterized  Doi  Moi  later  gave  way  to  much  slower \nchanges  in  administration  and  governance.  Systems  and  procedures  that  were  designed  and \nevolved  to  function  in  a  centrally  planned  economy,  often  during  revolutionary  and  wartime \nstruggles, now have to  deal with the demands  of national economic growth and development, \npoverty reduction, and international economic integration. Moreover, they have to be responsive \nto the need to regulate and facilitate a growing private sector, and to the growing aspirations of \na population, a large proportion of which was born after 1975. These aspirations include greater \nparticipation, transparency, accountability, predictability, and the operation of the rule of law in \nall areas of public affairs. Also, the economic growth rate and development momentum have to \nbe  sustained  and  improved  if  possible,  and  this  requires  a  more  favorable  administrative  and \noverall governance environment (see Appendix 1 for further details). \n \n\n2.  \n\nIssues and Challenges \n\ninherited \n\n \n13. \nThe reforms in public administration that are needed in a country in transition are diverse \nand complex. The present structure of government, and the distribution of tasks, responsibilities, \nas  well  as  staff  and  other  resources  between  the  central  and  lower  levels  of  government \n(provinces,  districts,  and  communes)  are \nfrom  periods  with  very  different \ncircumstances and needs. While some adaptation has taken place, much remains to be done. \nThis relates first to the roles and functions of the state and the government themselves in the \nnew  socialist-oriented  market  economy.  Clearer  guidelines  and  policies  need  to  be  set  as  to \nwhat  the  state  and  the  government  must  do  at  the  central level;  what  they  should delegate  to \nlower territorial units; and what responsibilities and functions they should leave to other agents, \nincluding  the  private  sector.  However,  such  restructuring  will  require  the  formulation  of  new \nconcepts  and  approaches  and  will  need  to  be  implemented  over  time,  and  in  a  strategic  and \nproperly sequenced way. Central to such restructuring are (i) the need to redefine the spheres \nof  responsibilities  for  the  state,  the  remainder  of  the  public  sector,  and  domestic  and  foreign \nprivate firms; and (ii) improved administrative capacities for policy making and implementation.  \n \n14. \nTo  date,  despite  significant  introduction  of  laws,  decrees,  ordinances,  and  other \nregulations,  and  to  some  extent  because  of  it,  major  gaps  as  well  as  contradictions  and \ninconsistencies  remain  in  the  legal  framework,  which  make  interpretation  and  enforcement \ndifficult.4  The  law-making  process  suffers  from  technical  limitations  and  inefficient  procedures \nduring drafting, from weak scrutiny of draft laws by the National Assembly due to the lack both \nof sitting time and capacity, and from overlaps, gaps, and confusions in the authority of various \nagencies and territorial levels. A report delivered to the first sitting of the 11th National Assembly \nin  July  2002,  following  the  May  2002  national  elections,  drew  attention  to  a  broad  range  of \nconcerns  expressed  by  voters,  including  the  need  to  set  up  a  national  anti-corruption \ncommission to speed up the fight against graft and embezzlement; the need to thoroughly and \nquickly deal with complaints and criticisms against public officials from citizens; and the need for \nthe  National  Assembly  to  set  up  an  auditing  agency  to  make  its  work  more  efficient.  Reforms \nthat  are  intended  to  ensure  improved  preparation  and  promulgation  of  laws  and  regulations \nmust be accompanied by improved judicial and court systems and law enforcement, with trained \nofficials,  effective  information  systems,  and  enough  well  functioning  legal  and  training \ninstitutions,  including  improved  legal  aid  for  the  poor.  Such  indispensable  complementary \nactions have not yet been clearly envisaged or planned.  \n \n\n                                                 \n4  For example, provisions relating to contracts in the Civil Code, the Commercial Law, and the Economic Contracts \n\nOrdinance are not always consistent. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAt  present,  the  salary  levels,  and  the  overall  quality,  of  the  civil  service  are  low.  The \n15. \nformulation of better policies and their efficient implementation will require better qualified, more \nefficient,  and  better  motivated  civil  servants.  Additional  and  improved  quality  training  needs  to \nbe delivered. Much else is also needed, including modern human resources development and \nmanagement  policies  in  addition  to  incentive  systems  such  as  increased  salaries.  It  is  also \nimportant to adapt the development and implementation of these policies to the newly emerging \nadministrative organizations, structures, and work processes, themselves evolving in adaptation \nto  the  new  vision  of  the  state\u2019s  roles  and  responsibilities.  There  is  also  some  feeling  within \nGovernment that there are now too many civil servants and that their number is to be reduced. \nThis  may  be  so  in  the  short  run,  if  new  recruitment  is  to  continue,  particularly  of  younger  and \noften better educated people, including more women. However, in the longer run, a mechanical \ndownsizing cannot be the only solution. The numbers and skills of civil servants and other public \nworkers  must  be  adapted  to  the  emerging  new  responsibilities,  functions,  structures,  and \norganization of the state and its territorial subdivisions. \u201cRightsizing\u201d rather than \u201cdownsizing\u201d is, \ntherefore, more appropriate in Viet Nam\u2019s context. \n \nViet  Nam\u2019s  administration  was  formed  and  had  long  functioned  in  an  environment  of \n16. \ncentral planning, much of the time combined with a war economy. In this environment, budget \nand  other  financial  controls  were  relatively  unimportant.  Even  before  the  resumption  of \nsignificant  international  aid  flows,  the  Government  decided  in  1991  to  stabilize  prices  by \ncompletely eschewing the inflationary financing of public deficits, and it has been exceptionally \ndetermined and successful in applying the macrofinancial controls involved in this decision.  \n \n17. \nAt  lower  levels,  however,  budgetary  and  other  public  financial  rules  are  less  clear  and \ngenerally  inadequate.  They  pay  \u201cinadequate  attention  to  output/performance\u201d,  allow  public \nservice  units  to  \u201cconceal  or  understate  their  earnings\u201d5  and,  more  generally,  provide  for \ninadequate  accounting  of  cash  flows,  and  contain  no  independent  audit  mechanism.  The \nnumber of fiscal statistics unavailable for Viet Nam is indicative of a wider problem in this field.6 \nPartly as a result of this wide problem (and because of other inadequacies of the fiscal system), \ntax  revenues  have  failed  to  keep  pace  with  the  increase  in  monetized  national  income.  The \nreform  of  financial  mechanisms  is  a  huge  task.  Only  its  first  steps  have  yet  been  outlined, \nnotably  the  provision  of  separate  operating  and  financial  rules  for  revenue-generating  public \nservice  units.  However,  discussions  that  the  Government  is  now  pursuing  with  international \nfinancial  institutions  are  expected  to  lead  to  a  major  reform  of  budgetary  and  public  finance \nprocedures and systems.7 \n \nCorruption has been a matter of growing concern to Viet Nam\u2019s leaders. Fighting against \n18. \nit is one of the important implications, and challenges, of building a state governed by the rule of \nlaw.  The  Government  has  proposed  a  systemic  approach  to  reducing  corruption,  by  clarifying \nthe laws governing and repressing it (including recent decrees concerning the public disclosure \nof the assets of higher civil servants and their families), and by reducing the opportunities given \n\n                                                 \n5  See action program no. 6, Reform of the Financial Supervision Mechanism, under the PAR MP (2001\u20132010). \n6  See, for instance, the World Development Indicators of the World Bank. \n7  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, together with other international and bilateral technical \nassistance agencies, are already engaged in helping to improve fiscal and budgetary processes, notably within the \ngeneral  framework  of  their  reporting  requirements,  through  the  IMF\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  of \n2001, the World Bank\u2019s Poverty Reduction Support Credit of 2001, and a World Bank public financial management \nreform  credit,  now  under  preparation.  These  aim,  in  particular,  at  improving  Viet  Nam\u2019s  fiscal  and  budgetary \ninformation  to  international  levels,  improving  controls  and  checks,  increasing  internal  and  external  transparency, \npromoting  greater  equity  of  public  spending,  improving  Treasury  management,  and  introducing  performance \nbudgeting.    \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\nto  it  by  ambiguous  laws  and  regulations,  complex  administrative  procedures,  low  civil  service \nsalaries, and inadequate control mechanisms. The approach centers on legal reforms, reform of \nadministrative procedures, and reform of the structure and remuneration of the civil service, and \nstrengthening and clarifying complaints channels for citizens. \n \n19. \nNew  designs  are  needed  for  the  policies  to  be  applied  in  most  areas  of  the  public \nadministrative  system,  for  work  processes  (in  particular,  improved  horizontal  cooperation \nbetween  agencies),  and  for  the  adaptation  of  the  structures  and  sizes of  agencies.  Many  new \nwork  processes  need  to  be  applied  through  new  techniques,  including  reengineering, \ncomputerization, and e-government, that require costly investment and attention to systems and \nprocesses  for  efficiency  as  well  as  capacity  building.  These  are  difficult  interrelated  issues  in \nany  country.  In  Viet  Nam,  understandably,  to  date,  plans  for  their  resolution  remain  largely \nincomplete.  These  are,  however,  critical  for  the  implementation  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Socioeconomic \nDevelopment  Strategy  (SEDS)  for  2001\u20132010,  which  itself  is  one  of  the  keys  to  the \nComprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGS),  approved  by \nthe \nGovernment in May 2002.  \n \n\n3. \n\nRecent Reform Initiative \n\n \n20. \nThe Government and the Communist Party of Viet Nam (CPV) have given strong signals \nin  recent  years  that  they  intend  to  reform  the  public  administration  system.  There  are  at  least \nthree main reasons for the strong support to PAR by the Government and CPV. First, the SEDS \nand  CPRGS  call  for  the  doubling  of  GDP  and  reduction  of  national  standard-base  poverty \nincidence  by  three  fifths  over  the  period  2001\u20132010,  along  with  a  wide  range  of  other \ndevelopment outcomes. Yet, because of the recent deterioration in the world economy, among \nother challenges, Viet Nam is currently not on track to meet the growth target, with average and \nprojected  growth  for  2001\u20132003  averaging  5.9%  per  annum,  rather  than  the  7.2%  per  annum \nneeded  to  meet  the  target.  To  have  any  hope  of  getting  back  on  track,  drastic  measures  are \nneeded, including the far-reaching reforms called for under the PAR MP. A second reason for \nthe  strong  support  for  PAR  is  that  Viet  Nam  has  commitments  under  the  bilateral  trade \nagreement with the United States, and would have new ones as part of WTO accession. A more \nefficient and effective ethical bureaucracy is essential to meet these commitments, and in turn to \npromote  business  investment  and  economic  growth.  The  third,  and  perhaps  a  more  important \nreason,  is  that  Viet  Nam's  leaders  are  trying  to  maintain  the  high  level  of  respect  they  have \nenjoyed  over  the  years  by  recasting  the  Government  as  being  more  responsive,  and  by \nreforming the administrative and legal system in ways that will encourage greater transparency. \nThey  want  people  to  feel  there  is  a  mechanism  enabling  them  to  bring  complaints  against \ncorrupt  and  incompetent  local  officials  to  the  attention  of  higher  authorities  and  that  this  will \ndiscourage rent-seeking activities. They also want to provide more effective services to citizens, \nin order to achieve CPRGS targets.8  \n \n                                                 \n8  Such as increasing the rate of children of primary education age going to primary schools to 97% (junior secondary \nschool to 80%) by 2005, and to 99% (junior secondary to 90%) by 2010; and reducing the maternal mortality rate \nto  80/100,000  by  2005  and  to  70/100,000  in  the  whole  country  by  2010  (the  rate  for  mountainous  areas  is \n100/100,000). The Government also recognizes the importance of gender issues. It recently approved a National \nStrategy and Plan of Action for the Advancement of Women in Viet Nam aimed at achieving women\u2019s equal rights \nin  labor  and  employment,  and  education  and  health  care;  at  enhancing  the  quality  of  efficiency  of  women\u2019s \nperformance in the political, economic, cultural and social fields, resulting in more women being recommended for, \nand  elected  to,  leadership  positions  at  all  levels  and  in  all  sectors;  and  at  strengthening  institutional  capacity  to \npromote the advancement of women. In regard to the across-the-board 15% reduction of government employees, \npregnant  women,  women  with  children  who  are  minors,  sick  people,  and  war  invalids  are  protected  against \nretrenchment. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nFocus Area \nInstitutional Reforms \n\n1. \n\n2.  Reform of the \nOrganizational \nStructure of Public \nAdministration \n\n3. \n\nImproving the Quality \nof Public Officials \n\nThe  PAR  MP  was  formulated  and  approved  following  extensive  deliberations  at  the \n21. \nhighest levels of the leadership, including the CPV. It envisages the reform of the entire public \nadministration system by 2010. It covers four focus areas and includes seven action programs, \nas shown in the following table:  \n\nTable 1: PAR - Focus Areas \n\n \n\nAction Program \n\nImprovements to the development, issuance, and quality of legal \nnormative documents (action program no. 1) \n\nImprovements to the roles, functions, and organizational structures \nof agencies in the administrative system (action program no. 2) \n\n \n\u2022  Modernization of the administrative system including \n\ncomputerization and e-government (action program no. 7) \n\n \n\u2022  Rightsizing of the civil service (action program no. 3) \n \n\u2022  Training and retraining to improve the quality of public officials \n\n(action program no. 4) \n\n \n\u2022  Salary reforms (action program no. 5) \n \n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\u2022 \n\n \n\n4.  Public Finance \nReforms \n\nImprovements to the financial management mechanisms for \nadministrative and public service delivery agencies (action program \nno. 6) \n\ninstitutions; \n\nfunctions  of \n\n \nThe  agenda  for  reform  and  renovation  under  the  PAR  MP  is  far-reaching  and  bold  in \n22. \nvision.  It  includes  replacing  cumbersome  administrative  procedures  with  more  simplified  and \ntransparent  ones;  reducing  red  tape  and  corruption;  streamlining  and  better  defining  the \nmandates  and \nreforming  provincial  and  other  subnational \nadministrations  and  redefining  their  relations  with  the  center;  rationalizing  the  organizational \nstructure  of  ministries;  improving  the  quality  of  public  officials;  undertaking  salary  reform  for \npublic  employees;  reforming  public  financial  management;  and  modernizing  the  public \nadministration system, including computerization and e-government initiatives.  \n \n23.  \nThe Government has requested ADB assistance to support its PAR MP implementation \nwith a focus on two of the seven PAR action programs, i.e., training and retraining to improve \nthe  quality  of  public  officials  (AP  no. 4)  and  modernization  of  the  administrative  system, \nincluding computerization and e-government initiatives (AP no. 7). \n \nB.   \n \nThe Government wants a civil service that is focused more on achieving results through \n24.  \nprofessionalism  in  performance  and  service  delivery;  that  has  sound  policy  skills;  and  that  is \nconcerned  with  its  responsiveness,  with  accountability,  and  with  the  observance  of  the  rule  of \nlaw.  For  this,  the  civil  service  has  to  overcome  many  deficiencies  in  its  quality,  including \ndiscipline, qualifications, professional capacity, administrative skills, dedication, and ethics. The \ncurrent public officials have many strengths, including increased numbers holding professional \nqualifications  and  degrees  or  with  English  language  skills.  However,  as  acknowledged  in  the \n\nIssues in Training and Retraining Reform \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f8\n\n \n\nPAR  MP,  many  public  officials  lack  the  professional  knowledge  and  skills  needed  in  the  new \nmanagement environment. To upgrade their skills, the Government sees both that training and \nretraining  are  an  urgent  priority,  and  that  the  existing  training  system  requires  renovation  and \nreorientation to improve focus and quality.9 \n \n25. \nTherefore,  in  considering  support  for  the  implementation  of  extended  and  improved \ntraining and retraining, a number of issues need to be addressed. There are already extensive \narrangements for delivery of training at central and local levels across Viet Nam, with over 120 \ntraining  institutions  at  both  levels.  However,  there  is  a  general  recognition  that  training  policy \nmust be modernized as much existing training is both poorly designed and focused, as well as \nbeing  ineffectively  delivered,  with  a  need  to  renovate  contents,  methods,  modalities, \norganization, and delivery.  \n \n26. \nTraining  and  retraining  need  to  more  sharply  focus  on  imparting  the  competencies  or \nskills now required, based on concrete needs and functional analysis of the work actually being \nundertaken.  As  with  modern  training  approaches  in  other  countries,  the  approach  therefore \nneeds to shift from intake of knowledge and theory to one more of enhancing skills and to being \nconcerned about the more holistic concept of \u201clearning\u201d, with training being just one of the ways \nin  which  public  officials  learn.  The  legal  framework  for  training  as  well  as  the  actual \nmanagement  of  training  delivery  through  training  institutions  also  needs  to  be  significantly \nimproved. New styles of more interactive and practical learning are required. There also need to \nbe significant revisions to the curricula and materials; the adoption of new learning methods and \nmaterials;  increased  use  of  modular  and  information  and  communications  technology  (ICT)-\nbased  approaches  to  learning;  greater  concern  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  impact  of \ntraining; upgrading training facilities and equipment; and enhancing trainers\u2019 skills. These need \nto be pursued as a matter of high priority. Over time, this should lead to the development and \ndelivery of a suite of training and management development programs that are better designed \nto meet Viet Nam\u2019s development needs.  \n \nC. \n\nincluding  Computerization  and  E-\n\nin  Administrative  Modernization \n\nIssues \nGovernment Initiatives \n\n \nAdministrative modernization of the civil service utilizing ICT was initiated in Viet Nam at \n27. \nthe  end  of  1993  when  the  National  Information  Technology  Program10  was  established.  This \ndrove most of the ICT development efforts from 1995 to 1999, including ICT training and raising \nawareness of ICT applications in government administration. The most significant achievements \nin ICT during that period were the initial establishment of government information networks (i.e., \nthe  Government  Information  Network,  CPNET);  the  building  of  six  pilot  national  databases;11 \nand  the  standardization  of  software  applications  across  agencies  and  local  governments \n(socioeconomic statistics, personnel management, general accounting, etc.). During this period, \nmany provinces began utilizing simple ICT applications for administrative purposes, and several \nstate-owned enterprises also built their own business systems, with some success, serving their \ninternal business needs.12 Meanwhile, access to ICT by remote and poor areas was also being \nincreased.  To  embrace  the  rural  areas,  regulatory  frameworks  were  being  structured  to  offer \n\n                                                 \n9  See Prime Minister\u2019s Decision 874/TTg of 20 November 1996 and Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No.74/2001/QD of 7 \n\n10  Through resolution 49/CP, 1993. \n11  These include socioeconomic, finance-budget, land resources, civil servants, population, and legal databases. \n12  Such  as  Viet  Nam  Airlines,  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam,  Vietcombank,  Petrolimex,  and  Viet  Nam  Posts  and \n\nMay 2001. \n\nTelecommunication.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nincentives  to  service  providers,  to  generate  new  opportunities  to  reduce  isolation,  to  improve \naccess to knowledge, and to participate in trade. \n \n28.  While  this  first  wave  of  ICT  development  saw  progress  in  raising  awareness  of  ICT \napplication  in  public  administration,  a  number  of  problems  remain  unresolved.  First,  CPNET, \ndue  to  inadequate  funding,  remains  at  an  initial  phase  of  development,  unable  to  resolve  the \ncrucial issue of integrating all ministries, agencies, and local government networks. This hinders \nthe  data \ninterchange  processes  between  government  agencies.  Second,  expensive \ntelecommunications  costs  and  the  lack  of  legislation  on  privacy,  digital  signature,  certification, \nand  authentication  have  hindered  the  growth  of  ICT  applications  in  Viet  Nam,  especially  e-\nbusiness  and  e-commerce.  Third,  limited  government  funding  for  ICT  has  resulted  in  input-\ndriven spending, with resources being spread thinly, resulting in incomplete projects. Fourth, the \nlack of adequate international standards of professionalism in ICT management is affecting the \nquality  of  strategic  planning,  system  support,  and  operations.  The  majority  of  ICT  managers \nhave  not  been  properly  trained  to  perform  their  duties.  Fifth,  the  lack  of  policies  and  a  legal \nframework  on  active  recruitment  and  attracting  high  quality  ICT  personnel  to  the  government \nworkforce  are  among  the  reasons  for  the  shortage  of  skilled  ICT  civil  servants.  Sixth,  quality \ncontrol and assurance has not been used widely in ICT projects. Seventh, interoperability is also \na  real  issue  when  back-office  systems  from  various  departments  want  to  communicate  with \neach  other.  Owing  to  the  lack  of  a  legal  framework  on  information  exchange,  participating \nagencies are reluctant to share information, and in any event the disparate technical systems do \nnot  facilitate  easy  interconnectivity.  Finally,  there  is  also  a  lack  of  an  appropriate  legal \nframework  to  permit  effective  development  of  e-government  and  public  service  delivery \nsystems, and to protect the interests of both service providers and end-users. \n \nThe  recent  open  endorsement  of  ICT  development  by  the  CPV  and  the  Government13 \n29. \nhas  introduced  a  refreshing  wave  of  thinking  in  all  ministries,  agencies,  and  provincial \ngovernments  on  the  application  of  ICT  in  public  administration.  And,  under  the  PAR  MP,  the \nGovernment  aims  to  develop  an  advanced  and  modern  public  administration  system  through \nincreased  use  of \nin  management  modalities,  policy \ncoordination, and better work methods.  \n \nD.  \n \n30.  \nTo address the challenges that are involved in such a complex and far-reaching reform \nagenda, various alternative approaches could be considered. One more \u201ctop-down\u201d approach is \nto  concentrate  on  core  government  institutions  and  focus  on  new  policies,  procedures, \nregulations, and systems\u2014all of these designed and promulgated by key central agencies and \nwith leadership from the highest level. This is the main thrust of the approach in the PAR MP. \nAn  alternative,  more  \u201cbottom-up\u201d  approach  is  where  innovation  comes  from  hundreds  of  pilot \ninitiatives from different sector agencies and different administrative levels (provinces, districts, \nmunicipalities,  etc.).  That  is  the  reform  approach  that  Viet  Nam  had  largely  used  prior  to \nadopting the PAR MP.  \n \n31. \nAlthough  ADB  continues  to  support  many  reform  initiatives  in  sector  agencies,  and  in \nselected  subnational  jurisdictions,  it  has  been  difficult  to  upscale  these  reforms  because  of \nblockages  at  the  core  institutional  level  due  to  outdated  regulations,  low  salaries,  nonmerit-\n\nAlternative Approaches and External Support: Lessons Learned \n\ntogether  with \n\nimprovements \n\nICT \n\n                                                 \n13  Through  the  Politburo  Directive  No.  58-CT/TW  on  enhancing  information  technology  application  in  the  course  of \nindustrialization, modernization, and national development; and the Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 112/2001 on the \napproval of the project of State Administrative Management Computerization (SAMCom). \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f10\n\n \n\nbased recruitment and promotion, and low skill levels. It also considers that the PAR MP is the \nmost  effective  path  for  addressing  these  systemic  issues  by  encouraging,  supporting,  and \nfacilitating a combination of both the \u201ctop-down\u201d and the \u201cbottom-up\u201d approaches while drawing \non lessons learned. \n \n32. \nLessons  learned  come  from  postevaluation  reports  and  project  completion  reports  on \npublic sector reform programs, as well as from first-hand experience of processing public sector \nreform  loan  and  technical  assistance  projects  in  other  developing  member  countries  (DMCs). \nWhile  each  country\u2019s  path  to  efficient  public  administration  and  good  governance  is  different, \ndepending  on  culture,  geography,  political  and  administrative  traditions,  economic  conditions, \nand  many  other  factors,14  the  main  lessons  relevant  to  the  proposed  program  are:  (i) a  solid \npolitical  commitment  from  the  highest  level;  (ii) strong  ownership  and  home-grown  strategies \nbased  on  wide  consultation  and  participation;  (iii) actionable  set  of  objectives  with  clearly \ndefined responsibility and accountability of government ministries or agencies embodied in the \nprogram; (iv) proper sequencing of the reform measures in relation to their importance as well \nas  achievability  with  due  regard  to  the  capacity  of  the  Government;  (v) public  awareness  and \ncontinued support and feedback from civil society to ensure sustainability of the program; and \n(vi) an outcome-based and flexible approach in both program design and implementation. \n \n33.  \n The  effective  implementation  of  the  PAR  MP  requires  substantial  resources,  including \nmany  support  measures  and  further  detailed  planning,  designing,  and  the  appropriate \nsequencing  of  policy  and  institutional  actions.  It  is  an  unavoidable  paradox  of  PAR  that  this \nexceedingly  complex  and  difficult  set  of  measures  has  to  be  better  defined,  planned,  phased, \nand implemented by the very administration whose inadequacies it is intended to correct. In this \ncontext,  external  assistance  from  the  development  partners  of  Viet  Nam,  including  ADB,  can \nplay a strategic role in helping catalyze the critical actions necessary, to give further impetus to \nPAR  implementation  and  to  help  the  Government  strengthen  and  improve  its  overall \nmanagement of the PAR process. Such assistance can also help accelerate progress in human \nresources  development  and  administrative  modernization,  notably  by  drawing  on  international \npractices and experience. (See Appendix 1, Annex 2 for an outline of the approach adopted to \nformulate the proposed program.)  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\n \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nA.  \n \n34.  \nThe  Government  aims  to  build  a  professional,  modern,  effective,  and  efficient  public \nadministration  system  for  Viet  Nam  through  its  PAR  MP.  The  overall  objective  of  the  program \nloan proposal (the program) is to support and facilitate the implementation of the Government's \nPAR MP and to assist in building a professional, modern, effective and efficient administration \nsystem  for  the  Borrower.  The  program  will  finance  implementation  of  two  of  the  seven  PAR \naction  programs:  (i) training  and  retraining  to  improve  the  quality  of  public  officials  under  AP \nno. 4;  and  (ii) modernization  of  the  administrative  system,  including  computerization  and  e-\ngovernment  initiatives  under  AP  no. 7.  The  program  will  facilitate  these  overall  aims  through \nnecessary  policy  and  institutional  measures  and  actions,  and  the  operational  arrangements \nnecessary to ensure effective implementation of APs no. 4 and no. 7 within the framework of the \nPAR MP. The program adopts a cluster approach, divided into three phases, of which Phase I \ncovers the period 2003\u20132005, Phase II 2006\u20132008, and Phase III 2008\u20132010 (paras. 76\u201378). \n                                                 \n14  ADB. \u201cGovernance in Asia \u2013 from Crisis to Opportunity\u201d, Annual Report 1998.  \n\n \n\n\f11\n\n \n\n \nB. \n\n \n\nProgram Strategic Framework and Policy Matrix  \n\n35. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  public  administration  system  is  complex.  In  extending  support  for  the \nimplementation of policy and institutional measures under APs no. 4 and no. 7, it is necessary to \nadopt  a  strategic  overview  of  the  entire  reform  agenda  covering  all  four  of  the  focus  areas  to \nensure  that  critical  linkages  to  PAR  are  ensured  and  that  impetus  is  given,  thereby,  to  overall \nPAR MP implementation. This is not only an obvious prerequisite for the success of the overall \nPAR  MP  but  also  equally  crucial  for  the  successful  implementation  of  the  two  APs  no. 4  and \nno. 7  targeted  by  the  program.  These  include  the  need  for  the  requisite  legal  and  regulatory \nsupport  mechanisms  to  be  put  in  place;  specific  organizational  functions  and  structures  to  be \nreviewed and adjusted; and organizational and institutional reforms, including the renovation of \nincluding \nwork  processes  and  procedures,  as  well  as  modernization  of  equipment \ncomputerization, to be integrated with human resources development and financial plans. These \naspects are given particular attention in the policy matrix of the Phase I program (Appendix 2), \nin the development policy letter (Appendix 3), and are regarded as fundamental to ensure the \nsuccess and longer-term sustainability of the PAR MP and represent a substantial component of \nthe program focus during 2003\u20132005. \n \n36. \nThe  four  focus  areas  under  the  PAR  MP  were  carefully  identified  by  the  Government, \nwith the assistance of external technical advice, through a process of intensive diagnostic work \nover  a  number  of  years  that  led  to  the  Government\u2019s  formal  approval  of  the  PAR  MP  in \nSeptember 2001. Given the socioeconomic background of Viet Nam and the nation's identified \ndevelopment  targets,  the  four  focus  areas  for  PAR  are  both  appropriate  and  highly  relevant. \nHowever, such a long-term program has to be flexible and adaptable. The opinions of citizens \nand enterprises will be one of the factors influencing future adaptations and change. To facilitate \nthe  collection  of  citizens\u2019  perception  and  to  benefit  from  it,  the  PAR  MP  specifically  refers  to \nfuture recourse to \u201cpublic opinion surveys for making important decisions and policies\u201d, and to \nthe  need  for  senior  officials  to  \u201cperiodically  and  directly  meet  and  dialogue  with  people  and \nbusinesses\u201d.  The  action  programs  under  the  PAR  MP  also  identify  a  number  of  related \nmeasures  and  actions  toward  this  end,  including  appropriate  feedback  mechanisms  from  the \ngrassroots  levels,  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  system,  PAR  awareness  programs,  and  citizen \nfeedback systems. \n \n37.  \nThe policy  matrix focuses on the relevant measures and actions needed to ensure the \nsuccessful  implementation  of  the  PAR  MP,  with  particular  focus  on  AP  no. 4  (training  and \nretraining)  and  AP  no. 7  (administrative  modernization,  including  computerization  and  e-\ngovernment). The policy matrix for Phase I of the program is therefore presented in three parts. \nPart  A  embraces  critical  PAR  development  objectives,  measures,  and  actions  to  lay  the \nfoundation  for  the  program,  to  ensure  strategic  interlinkages  and  synergy,  and  to  provide  an \nenabling policy and institutional environment for the successful implementation of the PAR MP \nand, more specifically, APs no. 4 and no. 7. Part B focuses on the development objectives, and \nkey  measures  and  actions  for  the  implementation  of  training  and  retraining  to  improve  the \nquality of public officials under AP no. 4; and Part C focuses on the development objectives and \nkey  measures  and  actions  for  the  implementation  of  administrative  modernization,  including \ncomputerization and e-government initiatives under AP no. 7. \n \nThe figure shows the strategic linkages between the major reform areas to be addressed \n38. \nunder the program. The detailed measures and actions under each development objective were \nselected with careful attention to sequencing and achievability in terms of the Phase I timetable.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1: Public Administration Reform Program Loan Policy Matrix  \n(showing development objectives)  \n\nPublic Administration Reform Master Program \n\nGoal: To build a democratic, clean, strong, professional, modern, effective, and \nefficient public administration system capable of supporting nation building and \ndevelopment \n\n \n \n\nPart B:  \n\nTraining and Retraining \n\n \n1.

Part A of the policy matrix contains eight key development objectives related to the PAR \nMP  implementation  to  ensure  strategic  linkages  and  to  provide  critical  underpinning  for  the \nimplementation  of  its  action  programs.  These  development  objectives  focus  on:  (i) improved \nleadership, planning, management and decision making for PAR, with a focus on AP no. 4 and \nAP  no. 7;  (ii) improved  PAR  management  information  system  and  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem  and  public  awareness  program  for  PAR;    (iii) strengthened  rule  of  law-based  public \nadministration  system;  (iv) strengthened  and  streamlined  legal  and  administrative  mechanism \nand  procedures  to  support  PAR  implementation;  (v) enhanced  public  service  delivery  in  the \nadministrative  system;  (vi) strengthened  policy  framework  for  managing  and  developing  civil \nservants;  (vii) effective  organizational  structures  and  functions  of  state  apparatus;  and \n(viii) improved  organizational  performance  through  an  integrated  system  of  performance \nmeasurement.  These  objectives  are  fundamental  and  represent  the  foundation  for  the \nsuccessful  implementation  of  the  PAR  MP  as  a  whole  and  APs  no. 4  and  no. 7,  specifically. \nUnder these objectives, a number of measures and actions would need to be carried out. These \ninclude a review of the effectiveness of current implementation arrangements and strengthening \nof coordination and management arrangements, including the provision of adequate resources, \nand a multiyear integrated and sequenced action plan for PAR implementation to be developed \nduring  the  early  part  of  program  implementation.  Other  measures  are:  legal  and  institutional \nreform;  upgrading  the  management  information  system  and  establishing  a  monitoring  and \nevaluation  system;  streamlining  administrative  mechanisms  and  procedures  to  support  PAR \nimplementation; \nresource \nmanagement  (HRM)  and  development  (HRD)  policy  for  civil  service  reform;  introduction  of \neffective organizational structures; introduction of a new system of organizational performance \nmeasurement; and a public awareness campaign. \n \n40.   A  number  of  the  identified  measures  and  actions  have  already  been  accomplished  by \nthe Government. As at the end of September 2002, the accomplished actions include: approval \nby the Prime Minister of the PAR MP; preparation of draft action programs; review of functions \nand  effectiveness  of  PAR  management  and  implementation  mechanisms;  submission  of  legal \nneeds  assessment  report;  improvement  in  public  service  delivery  through  several  successful \n\u201cpilot\u201d schemes (e.g., one-stop shop schemes); resolution on rightsizing; and the setting up of a \nsteering committee on salary reform. These are very encouraging reform actions that augur well \nfor the successful implementation of the PAR MP. \n \n\nto  service  delivery;  development  of  human \n\nimprovements \n\n2.  \n\nPart B: Training and Retraining for Improving the Quality of Public Officials \nUnder AP No. 4 \n\n \nPart  B  of  the  policy  matrix  contains  key  development  objectives  and  the  priority \n41. \nmeasures  and  actions necessary  to  improve  the  quality  of  public  officials  through  training  and \nretraining.  The  overall  objective  of  the  program  in  this  area  of  PAR  is  \u201cto  improve  the  quality, \ncompetency  and  professionalism  of  public  officials  at  the  central  and  local  levels\u201d.  The \ndevelopment  objectives  under  this  part  of  the  program  are  aimed  at:  (i) establishing  the \nstrategic,  legal,  and  management  framework;  (ii) renovating  training  planning,  design,  and \ncontents; (iii) renovating training delivery methodology and  techniques; (iv) enhancing capacity \nof  targeted  groups  of  public  officials  at  central  and  local  levels  through  different  training \nmodalities;  (v) developing  and  enhancing  the  capacity  and  quality  of  public  administration \ntrainers;  (vi) upgrading  training  infrastructure,  facilities,  and  equipment;  and  (vii) improving \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\nthrough  utilization  of  resources \n\nfrom  provincial/ministerial  schools, \n\nperformance  and  results  of  training  programs  through  systematic  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation. \n \n42.  \nThe  new  approach  to  training  in  the  civil  service  will  be  based  on  a  vision  of  the  civil \nservice as set out in a HRD strategic framework as well as in a more detailed implementation \nplan. It will be supported by new and revised policies on training in the civil service; through the \nrevision of laws and regulations on the civil service and personnel management, developed as \npart  of  the  overall  AP  no. 4;  and  through  new  management  and  institutional  arrangements  for \ntraining delivery. The Ho Chi Minh Political Academy (HCMPA) and National Academy of Public \nAdministration  (NAPA)  are  two  key  institutions  involved  in  training;  and  NAPA  is  also  co-lead \nagency (with MOHA) for AP no. 4. The capacity of these institutions will be tested to implement \nthe  planned  reforms  within  the  3-year  time  frame.  Means  and  ways  to  strengthen  their \nmanagement efficiency, and to mobilize extra resource capacity, will be explored and applied as \nrequired, \ntechnical \nassistance, and other mechanisms. \n \n43.   Renovation  of  training,  planning,  and  contents  will  involve  undertaking  a  number  of \nmajor  sequenced  tasks,  including  piloting,  at  each  stage  of  the  reform  process,  before \nimplementation  proceeds.  The  first  stage  involves  the  development  of  skills  profiles  of  the \ncompetencies required by target groups as the basis for ensuring that training can be designed \nand targeted in such a manner as to improve the quality of public officials and better meet the \nneeds  of  the  renovated  public  administration  system.  The  profiles  will  outline  the  required \ncompetencies, qualifications, knowledge, experience, skills, and personal character required for \ndifferent  positions,  levels,  and  sectors.  The  profiles  will  be  based  on  the  vision  for  the  civil \nservice under the PAR MP and functional analysis of the roles, functions, and tasks of various \ntypes of administrators at different levels, and the resulting job descriptions. This work will then \nlead on to careful assessment, through sampling, of actual training needs for priority categories \nof public officials and then development of a framework outlining the particular training programs \nthat will be required. Once the training programs have been determined based on the training \nneeds  assessments  (TNAs),  revision  of  training  content  and  curricula  will  be  undertaken, \nfollowed by piloting and broader replication.  \n \n44.  \nThe training reforms are also intended to cover a review of current training methodology \nand  techniques  (as  traditional  methods  such  as  lecturing  are  still  common).  A  number  of \ninitiatives  to  test  innovative,  action-oriented  and  interactive  adult-learning  techniques  will  be \nconducted  and  new  methods  developed  and  piloted,  including  for  the  use  of  ICT-based  self-\nlearning.  These  experiences  will  be  reviewed  in  order  to  make  recommendations  on  the  most \neffective mix of techniques for different types of training situations.  \n \n45.   Particular  efforts  will  be  made  to  focus  on  building  the  capacity  of  the  high-priority \ncategory  of  public  officials  by  fast-tracking  the  development  of  new  training  programs  and  the \nuse of new training modalities. About 15,000 administrative civil servants in general, and about \n10,000  grassroots  officials,  will  be  trained  in  at  least  one  of  the  short-term  courses  developed \nbased  on  priority  needs  as  identified  through  TNAs.  Many  different  short-term  courses  and \nmodules will be delivered, based on the needs of different groups of civil servants at central and \nlocal  level.  Longer-term  training  courses  for  about  500  officials  under  the  priority  groups, \nincluding public officials with potential for promotion, leaders, and managers, as well as selected \ntrainers,  will  also  be  developed  and  conducted  by  late  2004.  Training  will  be  conducted  in \nupgraded facilities, and training divisions and schools will be actively consulted on priorities and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nencouraged  to  host  training  modules  based  on the  revised  training  approaches,  contexts,  and \ncontents.  \n \n46.   Currently,  overseas  training  is  managed  in  a  piecemeal  way,  mainly  through  external \nsponsorship  under  bilateral  and  multilateral  programs  and  direct  cooperation  between \ninstitutions. Recognizing the higher priority that Viet Nam wants to give to overseas training, the \nprogram  contains  a  measure  to  develop  a  new  plan.  This  will  enable  priorities  to  be  set; \nselection  criteria  and  procedures  to  be  put  in  place;  cooperative  relationships  to  be  built  with \noverseas tertiary institutions; and arrangements to be put in place for utilization of staff on their \ncompletion  of  study.  About  200  officials  for  short-term  courses  and  about  100  for  long-term \ncourses are expected to benefit from the overseas training program. \n \nThe trainers in public administration play a critical role in improving the quality of training, \n47.  \nsuccessfully  introducing  new  curricula  and  teaching  methods,  and  sustaining  them.  There  are \nabout 3,000 trainers, both full and part time, involved with administrative training. Core teachers, \nparticularly  at  central  institutions,  including  master  trainers,  tend  to  be  academics,  and  not \nexperienced  administrators,  and  are  mostly  using  traditional  teaching  methods.  A  significant \nnumber are not skilled enough to be effective teachers. The program recognizes that the shift to \na  more  skills-  and  work-oriented  training  program  utilizing  modern  interactive  adult  teaching \nmethods will require teachers to have different skills profiles and training opportunities available \nto  them  that  include  general  upgrading  courses  in  modern  public  administration  and \nmanagement, perhaps coupled with internships in leading PAR administrations, as well as skills \ntraining in new teaching methods.15  \n \nThere is also the need  to significantly upgrade  the training infrastructure, facilities, and \n48. \nequipment in the central training institutions, NAPA and HCMPA, as well as in the 61 provincial \nschools.  To  create  a  suitable  environment  for  effective  training,  an  upgrading  program  will  be \nconducted,  involving  the  design  of  standards  for  training  facilities  and  equipment;  the \ndevelopment of a detailed investment plan for facility and equipment upgrading; and an assets \nmaintenance and replacement plan for training institutions. \n \n49.  \nThe ultimate purpose of training is to improve individual and team work performance of \npublic  officials  and  by  extension  the  performance  of  their  respective  organizations.  However, \ncurrent  reporting  and  feedback  on  training  is  more  focused  on  training  output,  i.e.,  number  of \npeople trained and the qualifications achieved. There is no systematic feedback on the impact \nof training and follow-up requirements (i.e., if and how the new knowledge and skills are used in \nthe  workplace,  and  whether  they  contribute  effectively  to  better  performance  on  an  individual \nand organizational level). To address this, a performance monitoring, reporting, and evaluation \nsystem for all training programs will be established under the program and an impact evaluation \non the training reforms will be carried out in mid-2005. \n \n\n3.  \n\nPart  C:  Administrative  Modernization,  including  Computerization  and  E-\nGovernment Initiatives under AP No. 7 \n\n \n50.   Part  C  of  the  policy  matrix  contains  key  development  objectives  and  priority  measures \nand  actions  for  administrative  modernization,  including  computerization  and  e-government \ninitiatives. The overall objective of the program in this area of PAR is to achieve an advanced \n\n                                                 \n15  For  example,  to  achieve  a  significant  impact  on  training  quality,  at  least  about  500  teachers  at  local  level  would \nneed retraining. The most effective and rapid way would probably be through a master training of trainers cascade \nscheme. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\nthe  operation, \n\nleadership,  and  management  of \n\nand  modern  public  administration  through  improvements  in  management  modalities,  quality  of \npolicy  coordination,  better  work  methods,  and  the  use  of  ICT  and  a  government-wide \ncomputerized  network \nthe  public \nin \nadministration system at the central and local levels.  \n \n51.  \nThe  Government\u2019s  decision  to  modernize  the  state  apparatus  and  its  functions  and \nprocesses  involves  not  only  the  computerization  of  government  agencies  but  also,  equally \nimportantly,  a  complementary  review  of  functions,  roles,  and  work  processes  in  these \norganizations to improve their overall effectiveness and efficiency. The Government recognizes \nthat computerization on its own will not suffice. Equally important are the measures and actions \nto review and streamline work procedures and processes so that the application of computers \nand  related  peripherals  can  bring  about  more  focused  and  effective  results  in  terms  of \norganizational and personnel performance. To achieve these objectives, the Government made \na  landmark  policy  decision  in  September  2001  for  State  Administrative  Management \nComputerization (SAMCom) under the Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 112/2001. \n \nThere  are  many  critical  issues  related  to  the  success  of  implementing  administrative \n52. \ncomputerization  under  SAMCom,  which  the  Government  wishes  to  address  through  the \nprogram.  For  instance,  effective  computerization  and  e-government  implementation  must  be \npreceded by appropriate reviews and modernization of government functional structures, work \nmethods,  and  work  processes.  Capacity  to  manage  the  development  and  implementation  of \ncomputerization  and  e-government  projects  needs  to  be  strengthened  and  the  capacity  to \nprovide  strategic  planning,  operation,  and  support  of  computer  systems  enhanced  to  provide \nbetter  service  and  to  protect  ICT  investments.  Moreover,  adequate  and  sustainable  financial \nresources  are  needed,  as  are  effective  procedures  for  ICT  procurement.  Another  issue  is  that \nextensive  and  effective  training  of  public  officials  in  basic  computer  usage  is  necessary, \nincluding  the  adequate  supply  of  staff  to  handle  systems  in  development  methodologies, \nstandards  and  procedures,  and  ICT  support  staff  for  planning,  operation,  and  support.  These \nare  critical  for  the  success  of  SAMCom  projects.  Finally,  an  appropriate  legal  framework  is \nurgently  needed  to  permit  the  effective  development  and  deployment  of  e-government \ninitiatives. \n \nIn  this  context,  to  support  implementation  of  AP  no. 7,  Part  C  of  the  policy  matrix \n53.  \ncontains the following development objectives: (i) enhancing productivity and work efficiency of \nthe administrative system at all levels; (ii) establishing appropriate legal frameworks to support \nthe  computerization  of  state  administrative  management  and  e-government;  (iii) strengthening \ncapacity in ICT management, planning, and support; (iv) strengthening capacity in ICT systems \ndevelopment  and  implementation;  (v) progressively  building-up  computerization  of  state \nmanagement  and  e-government,  with  benefits  and  services  to  the  citizen,  business,  public \nemployees,  and  other  government  agencies;  and  (vi) establishing  an  integrated  computerized \nnetwork from the central level to commune level administration. These are to be  implemented \nwithin  the  framework  of  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Decision  112  on  computerization,  under  OOG\u2019s \nmanagement within the PAR implementation framework. \n \nConsistent  with  the  first  objective  concerned  with  enhancing  productivity  and  work \n54. \nefficiency  of  the  administrative  system,  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Decision  112  sets  out  detailed \narrangements \nthe  public  administration  system.  A  detailed \nimplementation  plan  for  PAR  AP  no. 7  has  also  been  developed,  including  a  master  plan  for \nSAMCom. In addition, the working rules and management methods of government at all levels \nare to be revised under the program.  \n \n\nfor  computerization  of \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nfor \n\nintegrity;  protection  of \n\nICT  planning  and  management, \n\nTo establish an appropriate legal framework to support the SAMCom and e-government \n55. \ninitiatives, the relevant measures include: issue of a range of policies and regulations on, inter \nalia, information interchange between ministries and agencies; the use of the Internet; attracting \nand  retaining  qualified  personnel;  the  use  of  electronic  certification;  the  application  of  modern \nintellectual  property  rights; \nwork  methods;  data  security  and \ncomputerization of public service delivery; and the issue of enabling laws covering matters such \nas  cyber  contracts  and  privacy  protection.  In  addition,  relevant  procurement  policies  and \nregulations are to be issued for use under SAMCom.  \n \n56. \nTo  strengthen  capacity  in  ICT  management,  planning,  and  support,  and  following  the \nissuance  of  necessary  policies  and  regulations,  executive  information  (EI) units  are  to  be \nestablished  in  each  ministry  or  agency  and  at  the  provincial  level.  Each  EI  unit  will  be \nincluding  compliance  with  standards, \nresponsible \nprocedures,  and  practice  manuals,  that  are  to  be  issued  for  systems  planning,  support, \noperations, and maintenance. Senior managers are to be trained in strategic ICT management; \nadministrative  civil  servants  in  basic  computer  usage;  and  EI  unit  staff  in  systems  planning, \nsupport, operation, and maintenance. The measures in Part C of the policy matrix specify target \nlevels  for  the  numbers  of  staff  who  are  to  be  trained  by  September  2004,  with  100%  to  be \ntrained in all categories by December 2005.  \n \n57.   Capacity is also to be strengthened under the program in ICT systems development and \nimplementation.  The  program  provides  for  the  establishment  of  implementation  units  with \nresources  allocated  to  planned  activities.  A  TNA  will  be  conducted  and  a  training  plan  on \nsystems  development,  project  management,  and  related  matters  established  for  systems \ndevelopment  staff,  for  EI  officers  and  their  staff,  for  senior  managers,  and  for  end-users,  with \nspecified  targets  to  be  met  for  training  all  development  staff  by  December  2005.  Standards, \nprocedures, and practice manuals are also to be established for systems development, project \nmanagement, and quality management, and the training of trainers. Technical system platforms \nand training standards will also be established for SAMCom projects.  \n \n58.  \nIn  addition,  to  ensure  proper  sequencing  of  PAR  activities,  all  computerization/e-\ngovernment  projects  will  be  identified  where  organizational  restructuring  and  administrative \nprocesses are to be redesigned before the project proceeds. Policies and guidelines will then be \nestablished for redesign of the structures and processes as part of a multistage reform process. \n \n59.   As  part  of \nthe  progressive  buildup  of  computerization  of  state  administrative \nmanagement  and  e-government  with  benefits  and  services  to  citizens,  businesses,  public \nemployees,  and other government  agencies, a priority list of shared software applications and \ndatabases  is  to  be  developed  and  the  applications  and  databases  implemented.  Appropriate \nchange management techniques will be applied to each SAMCom project. \n \n60.  \nThe  program  also  includes  major  steps  toward  introducing  e-government  including: \n(i) establishing a government information portal for the purpose of disseminating information and \nlegal documents related to the Government, by September 2004; (ii) completing implementation \nof  the  application  of  established  standards  and  procedures  to  at  least  five  e-government  pilot \nprojects  delivering  better  public  services,  by  September  2004;  and  (iii) establishing  a \ngovernment  data  center  to  integrate  data  across  government  and  to  provide  decision  support \nfacilities, by December 2005. \n \n61.  \nIt  is  also  envisaged  that  under  the  program  a  computerized  network  from  the  central \ngovernment  down  to  commune  administration  level  will  be  integrated,  first  by  establishing \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18\n\n \n\nimproving \n\nImportant Features \n\nfor  developing  an  employment-generating  private  sector; \n\nsystem  specifications  and  implementation  plans,  and  then  enhancing  CPNET  and  local \nnetworks. By the end of the program i.e., by December 2005, with completion of the measures \nand actions specified in Part C of the policy matrix, Viet Nam should be well placed to proceed \nwith  more  extensive  introduction  of  e-government  initiatives  as  part  of  a  modernized  public \nadministration system.  \n \nC. \n \nThe program cluster, through the three phases of support during the period 2003\u20132010, \n62. \nis expected to help enhance the overall organizational and operational efficiencies of Viet Nam\u2019s \npublic  administration  system,  thereby  ensuring  more  effective  and  efficient  delivery  of  public \nservices  at  the  central  and  local  levels.  An  effective  PAR  process  will  involve  a  further \nrationalization of the role of the state, as Viet Nam makes greater progress in its transition from \na  centrally  planned  to  a  socialist-oriented  market  economy,  moving  public  resources  from \nproduction to health, education, and infrastructure; improving the enabling policy and regulatory \nenvironment \nthe \naccountability and transparency of government; and providing better access to public services \nand social safeguards for the vulnerable and the poor.  \n    \n63. \nThe  program  cluster  including  the  program  is  classified  as  Category  C  under  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental  classification  system.  Its  environmental  impact  is  expected  to  be  minimal. \nProgram  activities  will  not  involve  any  land  acquisition  or  changes  in  land  use  that  may  entail \ninvoluntary  resettlement  effects  and  trigger  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.  The \nbroader PAR\u2019s institutional and territorial reorganization provisions may well have broad social \nimplications.  The  measures  contained  in  the  program  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  and  the \nfollow-up arrangements are intended to address these. \n \nD. \n \n64. \nThe  Government\u2018s  PAR  MP  covers  10  years  to  2010,  divided  into  two  phases,  from \n2001\u20132005 and from 2006\u20132010. As PAR is a complex and long-term undertaking, ADB aims to \nextend support to the Government during the entire period of the PAR MP, i.e., up to 2010. ADB \nanticipates  extending  loan  financing  and  TA  through  a  program  cluster  approach,  provided  in \nthree  phases.  The  first  phase  of  loan  financing,  covering  the  period  2003\u20132005  (Phase  I \nprogram), will constitute this program loan in an amount of $45 million equivalent from the Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF),  and  is  expected  to  be  disbursed  by  the  end  of  2005  when  the  first \nphase  of  the  Government\u2019s  PAR  MP  is  to  be  completed.  That  year  is  also  when  a  number  of \nimportant reform actions are expected to have reached critical stages. If the Government, at that \nstage, were to request it, ADB would be prepared, in principle, to extend additional assistance \nduring the period 2006\u20132010 through two separate phases of assistance: the Phase II program \n(covering 2006\u20132008) and the Phase III program (covering 2008\u20132010) overlapping with Phase \nII,  with  loans,  respectively,  of  $50 million  and  $55 million  equivalent,  from  ADF.  Possible  ADB \nassistance  during  2006\u20132010,  which  constitutes  the  second  phase  of  the  Government\u2019s  PAR \nMP, is to be divided into two phases under the ADB program cluster. For each of the phases, \nincluding the first covering the period 2003\u20132005, ADB will actively seek cofinancing from other \nexternal development partners.  \n \nTotal financing from ADB for the program during the period 2003\u20132010 could, therefore, \n65. \nbe in the range of $45 million to $150 million, subject to Government and ADB jointly deciding to \nproceed with the second and third phases of the program cluster. In addition to ADF financing, \nsubject  to  the  Government\u2019s  requirements  and  its  specific  request,  ADB  would  be  willing  to \n\nFinancing Plan, Terms, and Source of Funds \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nconsider  providing  London  interbank  offered  rate-based  ordinary  capital  resources  financing, \ni.e., in addition to ADF financing. \n \n66.   Any  additional  phase  of  the  program  cluster  would  be  processed  sequentially  on \ncompletion  of  the  previous  one.  The  Phase  I  program,  with  the  financing  released  in  two \ntranches, will cover the period 2003\u20132005. Should there be a Phase II program, this would be \npresented for Board consideration and approval before the end of 2005, depending on progress \nachieved in implementing Phase I, including the status of compliance to the proposed policy and \ninstitutional reform measures and actions, and the readiness of the Government to continue to \nundertake  the  necessary  policy  and  institutional  reform  measures.  The  first  tranche  under  the \nPhase II program could be released by the end of first quarter of 2006. \n \n The policy and institutional reforms that have already been initiated under the PAR MP \n67. \nshould  naturally  progress  during  the  present  Phase  I  program.  ADB  will  reflect  the \nGovernment\u2019s  achievements  and  assist  the  Government  to  refine  the  policy  reform  actions \nunder  the  Phase  II  program  accordingly,  taking  into  consideration  the  policy  and  institutional \nenvironment for implementing the Phase II program. The Phase III program could be processed \nin a similar manner and would cover the period 2008\u20132010, with the first tranche expected to be \nreleased by the end of first quarter of 2009. \n \nFor the Phase I program, i.e., this proposal, the ADF loan will have a repayment period \n68. \nof  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  will  carry  annual  interest  rates  of  1.0% \nduring the grace period and 1.5% during the amortization period. The proceeds may be used to \nfinance eligible imports incurred within 180 days prior to the date of loan effectiveness. \n \n69. \nThe cost of implementing the six action programs (including APs no. 4 and no. 7), based \non  information  available,  is  estimated  to  be  $141.8 million  for  2003\u20132005.16  This  includes \n$28.2 million  for  training  and  retraining  under  action  program  no. 4,  and  $60 million  for \nadministrative modernization (AP no. 7) under the Phase I program. The costs are estimated on \nthe  basis  of  the  measures  and  actions  listed  in  the  policy  matrix  and  will  be  incurred  during \n2003\u20132005. During the postprogram period, there will be some recurrent costs, arising from the \nneed to maintain the assets (e.g., training facilities, and computer systems) created during the \nprogram implementation. Such costs, however, are likely to be small and can be accommodated \nin the regular budget of the Government17 (see section VI on program benefits and impacts). \n \nE. \n \n \n \n70.   OOG and MOHA will be the joint executing agencies for the program under the overall \nleadership  of  the  Prime  Minister.  MOHA  and  OOG  will  be  jointly  responsible  for  the \nimplementation of the measures and actions under Part A of the policy matrix. MOHA will be the \nimplementing  agency  for  Part  B  of  the  policy  matrix,  namely  measures  and  actions  under  AP \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nProgram Management \n\n1. \n\n                                                 \n16  Salary  reform  is  not  included  as  it  is  not  yet  clear  what  precise  proposal  will  be  implemented.  However,  one \nestimate for implementing salary reform is as high as $3,800 million over 2002\u20132005 or 3% annually of GDP. This \nmay  not  be  feasible  to  implement.  While  the  Government  has  yet  to  decide  what  salary  proposals  should  be \nimplemented, it has indicated that any such proposals must be met from the recurrent budget.  \n\n17  The IMF has been consulted on the proposed program and has endorsed it. Currently, Viet Nam does not have a \nmedium-term expenditure framework, though the World Bank and the Government are in discussion on this. Within \nthe Government, key central agencies such as the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Investment, and \nthe State Bank of Viet Nam have reviewed the program and supported it. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20\n\n \n\nno. 4, and for reporting on them. OOG will be the implementing agency for Part C of the policy \nmatrix, namely measures and actions under AP no. 7, and for reporting on them. To ensure the \neffective  handling  of  this  implementing  agency  role  and  responsibility,  program  management \nunits  will  be  established  within  MOHA  and  OOG.  Each  program  management  unit  will  be \nheaded by a program director and include a core team of staff (of at least three experts). The \nHLCC,  established  for  the  formulation  of  the  program,  will  continue,  and  will  meet  formally  at \nleast  once  every  quarter,  to  monitor  implementation  progress.  MOHA  and  OOG  will  be  jointly \nresponsible  for  overall  program  management,  including  reporting  on  administration  and \ndisbursements of loan proceeds, and maintenance of the Deposit Accounts, and preparation of \nsemiannual progress reports on loan implementation. The actions in Part A will be undertaken \nby  both  MOHA  and  OOG  as  specifically  applicable  to  them,  and  as  indicated  in  the  policy \nmatrix.  Management  of  joint  areas  of  responsibilities  between  MOHA  and  OOG  will  be \norganized  through  a  consultative  process  between  the  two  agencies.  See  Supplementary \nAppendix A for the implementation schedule. \n \n\n2.  \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n \n71. \nIn accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram loans,18 goods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries will be \nprocured, with due consideration for economy and efficiency, in accordance with standard public \nprocedures  in  Viet  Nam,  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices,  acceptable  to  ADB \n(Appendix  4).  In  addition,  special  safeguards  will  be  developed  by  the  Government  for \npurchases  of  ICT  hardware  and  software  to  ensure  consistency  with  government-wide  ICT \nstandards and ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines. \n \n72. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  proposed  program  loan  will  be  disbursed  for  a  broad  range  of \nimports,  subject  to  a  negative  list  of  ineligible  items.  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  on  the \nbasis  of  a  certification  provided  by  the  Borrower,  confirming  that  in  each  year  in  which  the \nproposed program loan is expected to be disbursed, the value of total imports minus (i) imports \nfrom  nonmember  countries,  (ii) ineligible  imports,  and  (iii) imports  financed  under  other  official \ndevelopment assistance, is equal to or greater than the amount expected to be disbursed during \nthe year. \n \n\n3.  \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n73. \nThe  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance \nthe  adjustment  costs  of  the  PAR  MP.  The  Government  intends  to  specifically  utilize  the \ncounterpart funds to finance detailed action plans for: (i) PAR AP no. 4 on training and retraining \nto improve the quality of public officials; and (ii) PAR AP no. 7 on administrative modernization \nincluding  computerization  and  e-government  initiatives.  Accordingly,  budgetary  arrangements \nhave  been  agreed  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  that  will  guide  and  regulate  the  release  of \ncounterpart funds for these purposes, as well as the actual transfer of ADB loan funds from the \nDeposit  Account  in  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  the  ADB.  It  is  further  understood  that \nMOHA and OOG will be responsible for ensuring that the necessary arrangements are made in \ncoordination  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  as \nappropriate, within the Government\u2019s internal procedures and guidelines, to secure the financing \nfor program implementation purposes.  \n \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB. 1998.

The  Government  and  ADB  will  continue  to \nengage  in  policy  dialogue  both  on  sector  issues,  policy  reforms,  and  other  PAR-related \nmeasures  during  the  program  period,  and  on  additional  reforms  that  may  be  considered \nnecessary or desirable. \n \n75. \nThe  Government  will  provide  reports  to  the  ADB  on  the  implementation  of  the  Phase  I \nprogram  annually,  and  in  particular,  on  the  measures  and  actions  set  out  in  the  development \npolicy  letter  (Appendix  3)  and  the  policy  matrix  (Appendix  2)  semiannually.  The  semiannual \nreports will be submitted in such form and in such detail and within such periods as ADB may \nreasonably  request,  and  will  include:  (i) progress  made  and  specific  problems  encountered \nduring  the  6  months  under  review;  (ii) steps  taken  or  proposed  to  be  taken  to  resolve  such \nproblems;  and  (iii) proposed  program  activities  and  expected  progress  during  the  following  6 \nmonths.  ADB  will  conduct  regular  review  missions  to  confirm  compliance  with  measures  and \nactions  contained \nto  maintain  program \nthe  policy  matrix,  and  advise  on  actions \nimplementation.  On  completion  of  the  Phase  I  program,  the  Government  will  prepare  and \nprovide  ADB  with  a  comprehensive  report  on  the  overall  impact  of  the  reforms  implemented \nunder the program. Tranching arrangements for Phase I of the program and details of Phases II \nand III are outlined as follows. \n \n\nin \n\n \n\na. \n\nPhase I Program \n\n \n76. \nThe  financing  for  the  Phase  I  program,  from  2003  to  2005,  is  to  be  released  in  two \ntranches  as  follows:  (i) equivalent  of  $15 million  (ADF)  on  compliance  with  the  first  tranche \nrelease measures and actions, and (ii) $30 million (ADF) on fulfillment of the specified second \ntranche  release  measures  and  actions.  The  first  tranche  is  expected  to  be  released  by  April \n2003  and  the  second  tranche  by  September  2004.  The  first  and  second  tranche  release \nmeasures  and  actions  are  set  out  in  the  policy  matrix.  ADB  will  review,  with  the  Government, \nprogress in implementing the specified policy and institutional measures and actions set out in \nthe policy matrix approximately 3 months prior to the specified tranche release.  \n \n\nb. \n\nPhase II Program \n\n \n77. \nSubject  to  a  specific  request  from  the  Government  for  assistance  and  progress  during \nthe Phase I program, the proposal for the Phase II program, covering the period 2006 to 2008, \nwould  be  developed  in  consultation  between  ADB  and  the  Government,  with  fact-finding \ncommencing in early 2005.  \n \n\nc. \n\nPhase III Program \n\n \nAs  in  the  case  of  Phase  II,  a  proposal  for  the  Phase  III  program,  covering  the  period \n78. \n2008 to 2010, would be developed in consultation between ADB and the Government, with fact-\nfinding commencing in early 2008.  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22\n\n \n\nV.  \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nto  OOG \n\n \n79. \nThere are three specific areas of need to be addressed through TA linked directly to the \nprogram, namely: (i) institutional and capacity building support to MOHA for the implementation \nof  the  training  and  retraining  action  plan,  including  management  and  development  of  civil \nservants  and  public  service  delivery  reforms;  (ii) support  to  OOG  for  strengthening  policy \ncoordination to assist the Government in national-level policy coordination and decision-making \nprocess  reforms;  and  (iii) support \nimplementation  of  administrative \nmodernization,  including  computerization  and  e-government  initiatives.  The  TAs,  estimated  at \n$3.765 million \nin  close \ncoordination with other development partners for building a stronger partnership on PAR and to \nmaximize  synergies.  Further  co-financing  possibilities  are  being  explored.  Details  of  ongoing \ninitiatives  by  development  partners  are  given  in  Appendix  7  and  Supplementary  Appendix  D. \nThe  TAs  are  expected  to  be  completed  by  October  2005.  Summary  information  on  the \nobjectives and scope, consulting services, and the implementation and financing arrangements \nfor  each  of  the  three  TA  proposals  are  given  below.  Further  details  on  TAs  are  available  on \nrequest (Supplementary Appendix B). \n \nA. \n \n\nInstitutional and Capacity-Building Support to the Ministry of Home Affairs \n\nincluding  Government \n\nfinancing,  will  be \n\nimplemented \n\ntotal, \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nin \n\n1. \n\nObjective and Scope \n\n \n80. \nThe TA will assist MOHA in modernizing the policy, legal, and institutional arrangements \nfor training and retraining of public officials, as well as enhancing MOHA\u2019s capacity to support \nimplementation  of  training  reform  in  particular  and  PAR  implementation  in  general.  More \nspecifically, the TA will assist MOHA in undertaking skill profiles, TNAs, training of trainers, and \ndeveloping  management  information,  monitoring,  and  public  information  systems.  The  TA  will \nalso  assist  MOHA  in  developing  proposals  to  enhance  gender  equity  and  ethnic  minorities\u2019 \nparticipation in the training programs, as well as in the civil service within the framework of the \nGovernment\u2019s already approved National Gender Strategy and Plan of Action 2. The TA would \nalso provide MOHA\u2019s core senior officials with an opportunity to familiarize with best practices \nabroad in training reform and management.  \n \n\n2. \n\nDeliverables and Outcomes  \n\n \n81. \nThe  expected  outputs  of  the  TA  are:  (i) a  modern  policy  and  legal  framework  for  the \nmanagement and development of civil servants; (ii) a needs and results-based training system \nwith  a  suite  of  new  training  programs  in  place;  (iii) trained  trainers  and  deployment  of  modern \ntechnology  and  techniques  in  training  delivery;  (iv) MOHA\u2019s  enhanced  institutional  capacity  for \nproviding  policy  direction  in  training  reform,  and  implementing  it  with  the  help  of  the  training \ninstitutions;  (iv) improved  coordination  and  monitoring  of  implementation,  and  greater  public \nawareness  of  the  PAR  MP;  (v) improved  public  service  delivery;  and  (vi) proposals  for  action \nplans for further enhancing gender equity and ethnic minorities\u2019 participation. \n \n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n82. \nThe  TA  requires  21  person-months  of  international  and  44  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting  services.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  as  individuals  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and procedures acceptable to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\n4. \n\nImplementation and Financing Arrangements \n\n \n83.  MOHA,  as  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA,  will  establish  a  project  management  team \n(PMT) and provide office accommodation, equipment, local transport, and the supplies required \nfor  the  TA.  The  PMT,  supported  by  a  group  of  international  and  domestic  experts,  will  ensure \ninteragency  coordination  and  liaison  arrangements  with  funding  agencies  involved  in  related \nareas  of  training  reform,  and  accomplishing  actions  under  Part  B  of  the  policy  matrix.  The  TA \nwill  be  implemented  over  a  30-month  period,  with  TA  inception  scheduled  for  April  2003  and \ncompletion by October 2005.  \n \n84.  \nThe  estimated  cost  of  the  TA  is  $1.16 million,  of  which  ADB  will  fund  $920,000.  In \naddition,  the  Government  has  requested  the  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation \nAgency for parallel financing for related activities. The Government of France has indicated to \ncofinance with ADB in an amount of 150,000 euros. Details on the TA, including cost estimates \nand  financing  plan  and  the  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants,  are  available  on  request \n(Supplementary Appendix B). \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Coordination Support to the Office of the Government  \n \n1. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \n85. \nThe  overall  objective  of  the  TA  is  to  contribute  to  continuing  enhancement  of  OOG\u2019s \ncapacity in assisting the Government in national-level policy coordination and decision making. \nThe  TA  will  (i) strengthen  OOG\u2019s  technical  ability  to  advise  and  coordinate  other  agencies \nnotably  in  presenting  policy  decisions  to  the  Prime  Minister  and  the  Government,  and  in \nimplementing  such  decisions;  (ii) enhance  the  policy  analysis  capability  of  OOG  officials; \n(iii) formulate  new  working  rules  and  procedures  and  develop  internal  capacity  for  improving \npolicy  decision-making  processes;  (iv) assist  in  improving  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of \ngovernment  decisions;  and  (v) assist  in  internal  capacity  building  in  coordination,  leadership, \nand  change  management.  All  these  activities  will  be  undertaken  following  a  participatory \n(process) approach involving OOG officials and leaders. It is also envisaged that the TA would \nprovide OOG\u2019s core senior officials an opportunity to familiarize themselves with best practices \nabroad in administrative system reengineering. \n \n\nDeliverables and Outcomes \n\n2. \n \nThe expected main outputs of the TA are: (i) improved national level policy coordination \n86. \nand  reduced  processing  and  approval \nfor  government  decisions;  (ii) increased \ntime \ntransparency, accountability, and predictability through written rules to guide policy formulation \nand  coordination  and  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  Government\u2019s  decisions  and \nconsequent  streamlining,  clarification,  and  acceleration  of  these  processes;  and  (iii) increased \norganizational efficiency through improved analytical skills of OOG officials to perform their roles \nin  policy  preparation  and  coordination,  and  as  actors  in  the  improvement  of  work  processes \nthroughout government. \n \n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n87. \nThe  TA  will  require  21  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  44  months  of \ndomestic consultants. The consultants will be engaged as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24\n\n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nImplementation and Financing Arrangements \n \n\n88. \nThe  TA  would  be  implemented  over  a  30-month  period  with  completion  by  October \n2005.  OOG  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  which  will  establish  a  PMT  responsible  for  overall \nsupervision  and  coordination  of  the  project.  The  PMT  will  be  chaired  by  a  vice  minister  and \nsupported  by  a  working  group  of  senior  OOG  officials.  The  PMT  will  also  be  responsible  for \nliaising with other TA projects within OOG to avoid unnecessary overlap. A careful and logical \nsequencing of the TA activities will be necessary, taking into account also TA activities of other \nfunding  agencies  and  OOG\u2019s  ongoing  initiatives  in  improving  leadership,  national-level  policy \ncoordination, performance monitoring, and management. OOG, working closely with Viet Nam \nResident  Mission  (VRM),  will  undertake  necessary  arrangements  for  the  TA  and  also  for \nworkshops, seminars, and training programs within the TA framework. \n \n89.  \nThe  estimated  cost  of  the  TA  is  $1.015 million,  of  which  the  ADB  will  fund  $815,000 \n(jointly with New Zealand). Details on the TA, including cost estimates, financing plan, and the \nterms of reference for the consultants, are available on request (Supplementary Appendix B). \n \nC. \n\nSupport to the Office of the Government in the Implementation of Administrative \nModernization, including Computerization and E-Government Initiatives \n\n \n\n1. \n\nObjective and Scope \n\n \n90. \nThe  proposed  TA  will  assist  OOG  in  strengthening  its  ICT  systems  development  and \nmanagement  capacity  for  the  effective  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  administrative \nmodernization,  computerization,  and  e-government  action  program.  It  will  assist  OOG  in \n(i) building  a  strategic  policy  and  legal  framework  for  modernization  of  public  administration, \nincluding  a  detailed  plan  for  e-government;  (ii) strengthening  capacity  and  technical  skills  for \nanalyses  and  design  of  work  methods  and  processes;  (iii) establishing  standard  practices  and \nprocedures  for  computer  system  planning,  operation,  and  maintenance,  including  TOT; \n(iv) establishing  standard  methodologies  and  procedures  for  systems  development,  project \nmanagement, quality management, procurement, and auditing, including TOT; (v) assisting the \nGovernment in undertaking TNA; and (vi) undertaking TOT in related disciplines. The TA would \nprovide OOG\u2019s core ICT senior officials with an opportunity to familiarize themselves with best \npractices abroad in ICT system management. \n \n \n \n91. \nThe  expected  major  outputs  of  the  TA  include:  (i) reduced  processing  time  through \nimproved  government  work  methods  and  processes;  (ii) better  quality  and  security  through \nstandards,  procedures,  manuals,  tools,  and  training  curricula  established  for  ICT  project \nmanagement, systems development, business process reengineering, operation, maintenance, \nprocurement, and audit; (iii) training capability enhanced through TOT and training handbooks; \n(iv) an intranet web site established and operational; (v) an e-learning facility for remote training \nand  retraining;  and  (vi) a  government  portal  for  public  information  service.  In  addition,  the  TA \nwould provide a detailed plan for further development of e-government initiatives. \n\nDeliverables and Outcomes \n\n2. \n\n \n3. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n92. \nThe  TA  requires  30  person-months  of  international  and  90  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting  services.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  as  individuals  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\n4. \n\nImplementation and Financing Arrangements \n\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and procedures acceptable to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants. \n \n \n \n93. \nThe  TA  would  be  implemented  over  a  30-month  period  with  completion  by  October \n2005. OOG will be the Executing Agency; it will appoint a project director for TA implementation. \nThe  project  director  will  be  formally  responsible  for  coordination  with  other  TA  projects  within \nOOG  and  with  other  agencies  where  appropriate  for  avoiding  unnecessary  overlap.  The \nsteering  committee  for  SAMCom  will  oversee  the  TA  implementation.  The  project  director,  in \ncoordination with SAMCom and with the support of international and domestic consultants, will \nbe responsible for the organization and implementation of the TA activities. \n \n94. \nThe  estimated  cost  of  the  TA  is  $1.59 million,  of  which  ADB  will  fund  $1.27 million. \nFurther cofinancing is being explored. Details on the TA, including cost estimates and financing \nplan  and  the  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants,  are  given  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B \n(available on request). \n \n \n\nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA.  \n \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n1.  \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n \n95.  While  the  program  supports  the  key  aims  of  the  Government\u2019s  PAR  MP,  it  focuses  on \ntwo  core  problem  areas,  i.e.,  training  and  retraining  of  public  officials,  and  administrative \nmodernization  including  computerization  and  e-government  initiatives,  during  Phase  I  (2003\u2013\n2005).  The  program  will  bring  various  benefits  and  development  impacts  at  different  points  of \ntime.  First,  in  the  short  term,  the  public  administration  will  be  more  service-oriented  and  more \nskilled, resulting in better service delivery to businesses and the poor. Second, in the medium \nterm,  direct  benefits  will  arise  from  efficiency  cost  savings  in  the  public  administration  system \ndue to improved institutional and functional efficiency, with better trained, more professional and \nbetter skilled civil servants, and due to the impact of the reform of work rules and methods in the \nGovernment, and computerization. There will, third, be some indirect benefits through reduced \nfrom  a  more  efficient \ntransaction  costs  and  opportunities \nadministration system. This will free up the time and resources of end-users (businesses as well \nas  people),  which  can  be  put  to  various  productive  uses  rather  than  dealing  with  red  tape. \nFourthly, in the long term, benefits will arise from improved governance emanating from better \ngovernment-to-people  interactions  and  improved  participation  facilitated  by  improved  public \nadministration, \nterms  of \ntransparency, service delivery, and predictability, as well as more democratic, participatory, and \neffective governance will stimulate economic risk taking of the private sector, leading to higher \nsavings and investment and thereby higher economic growth. \n \n\nImproved  public  administration \n\nfor  rent  seeking  resulting \n\nincluding  computerization. \n\nin \n\n2.  \n\nPoverty and Social Impacts \n\n \nThe  poor  should  benefit  through  improved  public  service  delivery  and  access  as \n96.  \ndescribed  above.  The  poor  in  Viet  Nam  have  already  benefited  directly  and  indirectly  from \neconomic  growth.  Rising  demand  for  labor,  employment,  and  real  wages  have  contributed  to \nreducing  poverty  at  record  speeds  over  the  past  decade.  The  role  and  participation  of  the \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26\n\n \n\ngrassroots  levels  in  the  policy  decision-making  process  have  also  increased  over  the  years. \nCitizens have increased opportunities and avenues for more efficient and effective handling and \nmanagement of their complaints. There is greater transparency in the decision-making process \nand public services provision, and overall increased confidence of the citizenry on Government. \nThe  administrative  reforms  facilitated  by  the  program  should  accelerate  these  benefits  to  the \npoor  with  greater  sustainability  (see  Appendix  1,  Annex  1;  Appendix  5;  Appendix  6;  and \nSupplementary Appendix C). \n \nThough  the  poor  have  a  relatively  better  social  standing  in  Viet  Nam  than  in  most \n97.  \ncountries  at  comparable  income  levels,  they  still  constitute  the  socially  and  politically  weakest \ngroup.  They  are  the  least  able  to  handle  rent  seeking  or  to  cut  through  red  tape.  Undesirable \narbitrary bureaucratic behavior most directly hinders their economic endeavors. Conversely, the \npoor and the vulnerable would be the greatest beneficiaries of the strengthened and accelerated \nreforms assisted by the program, such as improvements in service delivery. \n \n98. \nFor  the  potential  gains  from  the  program  to  be  realized,  however,  careful  attention  will \nhave  to  be  paid  to  the  impact  of  each  specific  program  and  action  on  the  more  vulnerable \nsegments of the population, in particular the poor, as well as ethnic minorities and women. More \nskill-based recruitment and performance-based promotion systems, and the rightsizing program, \nshould probably be combined with programs that overcome the limited representation of ethnic \nminorities. Action may also be needed to even the balance for women, fairly well represented in \nthe lower ranks of public service but only symbolically, or not at all, in its higher reaches.19  \n\n \n\n3.  \n\nGood Governance \n\n \n99. \nThe  program  deals  wholly  with  various  aspects  of  public  administration,  and  all  its \nbenefits  therefore  relate,  in  some  sense,  to  good  governance.  Its  benefits  will  include  a  more \naccountable, responsive, and efficient public administration that is better organized, structured, \nresourced,  and  staffed  to  assist  the  Government  in  achieving  its  objectives.  One  particular \nbenefit may be the enhanced ability of a modernized public administration to provide improved \ndecision  support  and  policy  advice  to  the  Government.  A  better  paid,  more  professional,  and \nbetter  equipped  public  service  system  would  be  able  to  provide  higher  quality  policy  decision-\nmaking  support  for  all  levels  of  the  Government.  The  Government  should  in  turn  benefit  from \nimproved  administrative  processes  and  mechanisms  that  should  relieve  decision  makers  of \nmany of the burdens they now bear, and allow them to concentrate on important policy issues. \nThese should lead to further improvements to the system of public administration. \n \n100.   The  Government  is  already  undertaking  several  decentralization  initiatives,  which \ninclude the delegation of powers for human resources management to the provincial levels, the \nissuance of block grants for public expenditures, and special provisions under the Budget Law. \nThese initiatives will need to be pursued further to secure additional benefits. The program will \nassist  in  establishing  a  state  based  on  the  rule  of  law  and  civil  servants  will  be  expected  to \ncomply with the law at all times in their work. Improving participation in government, provision \nfor consultation with citizens on draft laws, and the use of surveys for obtaining their views and \nfeedback  on  government  services,  will  also  help  strengthen  transparency  and  accountability. \nThe mutually reinforcing effects provided by implementation, from 2003 onward, of the package \nof  PAR  measures  will  help  improve  confidence  in  the  consistency  and  predictability  of \nGovernment actions. \n\n                                                 \n19  The Government has recently approved a National Gender Strategy and Plan of Action; one of its objectives is to \n\nachieve women\u2019s equal rights in labor and employment.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nRisks \n\n \n101.  Details of the expected benefits and impacts from the program are outlined in Annex 1 of \nAppendix 1. \n \nB. \n \n102.   The program entails three types of risks: some of the necessary measures may not be \nagreed;  some  may  be  agreed  but  not  carried  out;  and  some  may  be  carried  out  but  with \nunintended  impacts.  In  terms  of  the  first  type  of  risk,  intellectual  consensus,  political  will  or \ncapacity, and constraints on financial and human resources do not allow every reform measure \nto  go  as  far  or  as  fast  as  some  of  their  proponents  would  wish.  Thus,  the  program  does  not \nconstitute  an  ideal  set  of  reform  measures  for  the  swiftest  conceivable  transformation  of  Viet \nNam's public administration. It constitutes a set of feasible measures on which consensus could \nbe reached and for which resources can be found. It will not bring instantaneous modernization \nbut if properly implemented, it will bring gradual but solid improvements. \n \n103.   The  second  type  of  risk  is  that  decisions  may  not  be  translated  into  actions  or \nimplementation  may  be  delayed.  Governments  often  announce  that  they  are  going  to  do \nsomething (sometimes in response to measures and actions imposed by lenders), but either do \nnot intend to or are unable to give practical effect to such decisions. Such inability may be due \nto political constraints on action or unwillingness to offend powerful interests. It may also be due \nto  a  failure  of  the  instruments  of  governance  or  to  instructions  being  heard  but  ineffectively \ncarried  out.  Naturally,  these  two  causes  often  combine,  particularly  when  the  civil  service \nconstitutes  an  effective  political  force  and  is  itself  the  object  of  reform  decisions.  These  are \nrelevant  concerns  for  an  extensive  range  of  reforms  that  will  affect  all  levels  of  public \nadministration in Viet Nam over a long period. However, precisely because the PAR program, \nthough bold, is not overly ambitious, the second risk does not appear overwhelming.20 \n \n104.  Nevertheless,  while  high-level  political  commitment  is  not  in  doubt,  a  number  of \nelements  need  to  be  addressed  to  ensure  effective  reform  implementation.  Resistance  to \nreforms needs to be managed actively (including discussion with stakeholders and the diffusion \nof  information  about  reform  objectives),  and  not  allowed  to  halt  or  derail  reforms.  Adequate \nfinancial  and  human  resources  are  also  essential.  Implementation  must  be  managed  in  a \npractical,  realistic,  and  sequenced  way,  paying  keen  attention  to  the  proper  linkages  between \nvarious  reforms.  Adjustments  will  often  be  required  in  the  light  of  experience,  hence  the \nprogram's accent on multiyear rolling plans, management information systems, and monitoring \nand  evaluation,  all  of  which  presume  a  strong  central  leadership  and  management. \nOrganizational  arrangements  for  the  management  of  PAR  implementation  must  be  highly \neffective,  and  firm  leadership  must  be  provided  throughout  the  process.  The  strong  political \ncommitment  shown  in  the  formulation  and  approval  of  the  PAR  MP  must  be  maintained \nthroughout the reform implementation process, and be reflected in public advocacy and active \nparticipation.  One  key  related  task  will  be  building  ownership  and  accountability  in  the  line \nagencies  that  will  have  to  take  most  of  the  concrete  implementation  actions.  Without  such \nownership it will be difficult to move reforms and restructuring forward. Given these risks, much \nof the policy matrix is tailored to ensuring that the implementation process is in fact effective and \nthat these risks are accordingly minimized. \n\n                                                 \n20  The  Government  with  its  full  ownership  initiated  the  PAR.  ADB\u2019s  role,  in  coordination  with  other  external \ndevelopment  partners  of  Viet  Nam,  notably  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  has  been  to  help \nimprove  PAR\u2019s  conception  and  point  out  its  implications,  to  help  put  in  place  mechanisms  for  improved  further \nanalysis, evaluation, and implementation, and to facilitate implementation through financing.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28\n\n \n\n \n105.   The  third  risk  is  more  difficult  to  analyze  and  if  it  materializes,  its costs  could  be  much \nhigher. The PAR MP, 2001\u20132010, is arguably a more comprehensive reform program than has \npreviously been pursued in Viet Nam, but not only ambition. The actions in drawing up lessons \nlearned from past and ongoing reform programs and integrating them into current reforms are \nstill being refined but in circumstances where the experience in other countries may not provide \nhighly  relevant  lessons  for  implementation  in  the  local  context.  Moreover,  the  experience  in \nother  countries  includes  many  implementation  failures.21  Even  if  PAR  outputs  are  delivered \nsuccessfully, there is not a simple, one-dimensional, logical chain leading from reform decisions \nto  desired  impacts  and  outcomes.  Although  it  will  be  tempting  to  link  any  improvements  with \nPAR,  it  will  often  be  impossible  to  separate  actual  reform  impacts  from  what  might  have \nhappened anyway. Furthermore, there are multiple outcomes and outcome measures, ranging \nfrom  reducing  corruption,  to  improving  service  quality,  and  to  improving  service  efficiency. \nThese can be potentially conflicting. PAR may lead to improvements by one outcome measure, \nbut  at  the  cost  of  deterioration  in  another.  In  addition,  a  common  approach  to  measuring \noutcomes  involves  surveys  of  citizens,  businesses,  and  other  stakeholders.  Yet  many \nadministrative processes are characterized by informational asymmetry: administrators have an \ninformational  advantage  over  citizens,  businesses,  and  even  politicians  in  the  legislature  (less \nso  politicians  in  the  executive).  Thus,  citizen  perceptions  may  be  overly  generous  or  critical, \ndepending  on  small  positive  or  negative  changes  that  are  visible  to  them.  These  risks  will  be \nmitigated  through  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  mechanisms  to  be  put  into  place,  combined \nwith regular exchange  of information between ADB and the Government. ADB  also intends to \ndeploy  a  higher  than  normal  level  of  specialist  staff  input  to  support  the  Government  in  this \ncomplex monitoring effort (see program framework in Appendix 6). \n \n \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA.  \n \n106.   The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which are incorporated in the Loan Agreement: \n \n\n(i)   \n\nthe  measures  and  actions  included  in  the  program  and  specified  in  the \ndevelopment policy letter and the policy matrix will be adopted in a timely manner. \nSuch measures and actions will continue to be in effect, to ensure the sustainability \nof public administration reforms; and  \n\n \n(ii)   adequate and timely counterpart funds to implement the program, in particular for \n\nPAR APs no. 4 and no. 7, will be provided.  \n\n Measures and Actions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n \nB. \n \n107.   The measures and actions for loan effectiveness: the Government would have complied \nwith all measures and actions for release of the first tranche (Appendix 2).   \n \n \n\n                                                 \n21  See World Bank Operation & Evaluation  Department, Governance: The Critical Factor.

RECOMMENDATIONS \n\n \n108. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  program  cluster  concept,  the  proposed  loan  and \ntechnical assistance would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB and recommend that \nthe Board approve the: \n \n\nproposed three-phase program cluster concept to Support Implementation of the \nPublic  Administration  Reform  Master  Program  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet \nNam;   \n\nloan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 33,657,000 to the \nSocialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  Phase  I  of  the  Program  (2003\u20132005)  from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1%  per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  24 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board; and  \n\nprovision  of  technical  assistance  in  an  amount  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$1,270,000  to  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  on  a  grant  basis  for  Support  to  the \nOffice of the Government in the Implementation of Administrative Modernization \nincluding Computerization and E-Government Initiatives.  \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n \n \n\nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n \n \n\n \n18 December 2002 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30\n\nAppendix 1 \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction  \n\nPUBLIC ADMINISTRATION SECTOR IN VIET NAM \n\n1. \nViet  Nam  has  a  four-tiered  administrative  structure\u2014central,  provincial,  district,  and \ncommune  levels.  There  are  five  state  institutions  at  the  central  level,  with  counterparts  at \nsubordinate  levels:  (i) the  500-member  elected  National  Assembly  and  its  elected  local \ncounterparts,  the  People's  Councils;  (ii) the  President,  who  is  supported  by  a  vice  president; \n(iii) the  Government,  and  its  local  counterparts,  the  People's  Committees;  (iv) the  Supreme \nCourt and the local People's Courts; and (v) the Supreme Institute of Procuracy, and the local \nPeople's  Procuracy.  At  the  provincial  level,  the  administrative  structure  has  a  series  of \ndivisions\u2014districts, provincial cities, and towns. Cities under direct central rule are divided into \nurban  districts,  rural  districts,  and  towns.  At  the  district  level,  rural  districts  are  divided  into \ncommunes,  townships,  and  wards,  while  urban  districts  are  classified  as  wards.  At  the \ncommune level, communes are divided into urban and rural. \n\nB.  National Assembly \n\n2. \nThe  1992  Constitution  provides  that  the  National  Assembly  is  the  highest  representative \nand legislative body and that it exercises \"supreme oversight\" over all state activities. All state \nbodies  such  as  the  Government,  the  People's  Supreme  Court,  and  the  People's  Supreme \nInstitute  of  Procuracy  are  held  accountable  to,  and  are  appointed  by,  the  National  Assembly. \nOver time, the National Assembly has enhanced its legislative role and its level of oversight of \nexecutive government bodies.  \n\nC.  The Government1 \n\nThe Government is the highest executive body, charged with the overall management and \n3. \nhandling of the economy and the supervision of public sector agencies at all level. In practice, \npower and authority are conferred on the CPV Secretary, the President, and the Prime Minister, \ntogether  with  the  Chair  of  the  National  Assembly  and  some  core  ministers  to  form  the \nPolitbureau.  The  Government  is  structured  into  ministries  and  agencies  that  report  to  specific \nministers. There are 16 ministers, including the Prime Minister and four deputy prime ministers, \neach with broad areas of responsibility. There are 26 ministries and 13 government agencies. \n\n4.  Considerable authority is conferred on the Prime Minister, who is empowered to designate \n(for  the  National  Assembly\u2019s  approval)  ministers,  to  appoint  deputy  ministers,  and  other \nmembers  of  provincial  bodies,  and  to  restructure  public  agencies.  The  Prime  Minister  can \noverride the decisions of ministers and local authorities that are in contravention of the law, and \notherwise exercise a supervisory role over these bodies. The Office of the Government (OOG) \nprovides advisory and administrative support to the Prime Minister. Overall policy direction is set \nby the CPV. The Prime Minister makes decisions on new laws and policies, after consultation \nwith  relevant  stakeholders,  which  are  then  endorsed  by  monthly  cabinet  meetings  and  the \nNational Assembly as necessary. OOG has the authority to convene cabinet meetings.  \n\n5. \nPolicy submissions are submitted by ministers to the relevant vice chairman at OOG. He \ncan return them when incomplete, inconsistent with past decisions, inadequately consulted on, \n\n                                                 \n1  See  also  The  Structure  and  Functions  of  the  Government  in  Viet  Nam.  2002.  Background  report  on  public \nadministration reform in Viet Nam prepared for the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Mekong Economics. May. \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n31\n\nproviding  only  a  single  option,  or  if  potentially  illegal.  In  doing  so,  OOG\u2019s  role  may  be  mainly \nadministrative  (ensuring  that  submissions  are  complete)  and/or  substantive  (analyzing  the \ncontent of the submission, and making recommendations on this basis), depending on the issue \nat hand, and on the OOG unit and officers involved. However, more recently, OOG has sought \nto  assert  a  more  strategic  role  as  a  key  policy  advisor  to  the  Prime  Minister  and  to  the \nGovernment.2 \n\n6.  Once a policy submission is complete, it is reviewed by the relevant deputy prime minister, \nand  further  questions  may  be  asked.  In  some  cases,  it  goes  to  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Research \nCommission for further screening, redrafting, and possible questions. Then it either goes to the \nPrime  Minister  for  approval,  or  a  deputy  prime  minister  will  be  delegated  to  approve  it.  Many \nissues  brought  to  the  Prime  Minister  are  vetted  during  the  daily  meetings  of  the  Politburo \nStanding Committee (presently seven members) before a decision is reached.  \n\n7. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  central  government  policy-making  institutions  can  be  viewed  as  a  hybrid  of \nclassic  cabinet  and  presidential  models.  Like  the  cabinet  model,  the  Viet  Nam  system  is \nunderpinned by collective accountability for decision making. However, the cabinet is only one \nof the key structures that is part of the collective accountabilities, and consensus building stems \nmainly  from  informal  rather  than  formal  processes.  Unlike  the  classic  cabinet  model,  policy \ndecisions  are  made  by  the  Prime  Minister  or  deputy  prime  minister  (under  delegation),  after \nendorsement  from  the  Politbureau  Standing  Committee.  Although  complex  decisions  involving \nmany  sectors  may  be  discussed  by  the  cabinet,  and  although  ministers  are  briefed  on  the \nprogress  of  policy  submissions  made  by  their  ministries,  the  cabinet  neither  makes  decisions, \nnor  questions  decisions  once  they  are  made.  Like  the  presidential  model,  the  Prime  Minister \nrelies  on  bilateral  or  trilateral  arrangements  between  himself  (facilitated  by  OOG)  and  his \nministers, who are accountable for decisions within their particular sphere.  \n\n8. \nAt all levels, decision making in Viet Nam is characterized by consensus seeking. This is a \nstrong  guiding  principle.  By  engaging  a  wide  range  of  actors  before  decisions  are  finalized, \nresponsibility  is  shared  and  political  risks  are  reduced.  While  this  maintains  stability  through \ninvolving many elements of society in decisions, it can be a protracted process leading, at times, \nto  slow  response  by  the  Government  to  the  timely  management  of  critical  issues.  One  key \nconstraint  is  that  the  policy  development  process  lacks  sufficient  stakeholder  consultation  and \nparticipation,  and  hence  may  not  always  be  responding  to  real  needs.  The  Government  now \nplans to consult stakeholders on key laws and policies. \n\n1. \n\nJudiciary  \n\n9. \nThe court system is established both at local and central levels. The Supreme Court is the \nhighest  court  of  appeal  and  review.  It  supervises  the  implementation  of  sentences  passed  by \nlower  courts  as  well  as  organizing  and  conducting  professional  training for  judges,  jurors,  and \nother court staff. It also provides professional guidance both for drafting legal documents and to \nlower courts.  \n\n10.  The  Supreme  People's  Procuracy  is  an  agency  under  the  supervision  of  the  National \nAssembly  with  responsibility  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  law  by  ministries,  agencies,  other \norgans  of  government,  local  organs  of  power,  economic  bodies,  social  organizations,  and \ncitizens. Its functions embrace both the criminal and civil jurisdictions. It is responsible both for \n\n                                                 \n2  This  was one  outcome of  an institutional strengthening TA that ADB provided to OOG in  2001\u20132002 (TA: 3652-\n\nVIE). \n\n\f32\n\nAppendix 1 \n\n2. \n\nLocal Government \n\npublic  prosecutions  and  for  supervision  of  the  implementation  of  laws.  Viet  Nam's  judicial \nsystem  is  highly  centralized,  through  the  Ministry  of  Justice  (MOJ),  with  ultimate  decision-\nmaking authority resting with the National Assembly. \n\n11.  Viet  Nam's  local  administration  system  is  divided  into  three  levels:  provinces  (61  units), \ndistricts (586 units), and communes (10,391 units). At all three levels there is a representative \nbody  (the  People's  Council)  and  an  executive  body  (the  People's  Committee).  The  people's \ncommittees  and  people\u2019s  councils  often  have  overlapping  membership.  The  local people  elect \nthe People's Council, the candidates for which are usually nominated by the Vietnam Fatherland \nFront  and  approved  by  the  higher-level  administrative  unit.  The  People's  Council  selects  the \nchairman and vice chairman of the people's committees.  \n\n3. \n\nThe Civil Service \n\n12.  The civil service, down to district level (but excluding the police and the army), comprises \nabout  1.3  million  officials  of  whom  200,000  officials  work  for  the  central  Government  and  1.1 \nmillion  work  at  the  provincial  level.  However,  the  number  of  persons  on  the  payroll  who  are \nfunded from the budget is much larger than that as it comprises a large group of war veterans \nas well as others disabled during the war.  \n\n13.  The remuneration level of public servants is very low, despite some recent increases. Most \nhave  an  average  salary  of  around  D800,000  ($58)  per  month.  The  most  senior  civil  servants \nreceive a salary of around D1.5 million ($107) per month. However, indications from the Ministry \nof  Home  Affairs  (MOHA)  are  that  salaries  represent  only  a  third  to  a  half  of  the  remuneration \nthat civil servants receive. MOHA estimates that a civil servant needs around D2 million ($143) \nper  month  to  support  a  reasonable  standard  of  living.  As  well  as  salary,  civil  servants  receive \nallowances  (including  for  housing)  and  collect  various  payments  for  services  rendered  in  their \nwork. Many middle-level civil servants find that they cannot make ends meet without a second \nincome or engaging in rent-seeking activity. \n\nD.  Public Administration Reform \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Reform \n\n14.  Moving  from  a  system  that  emphasized  collective  authority  over  personal  and  property \nrights to a state based on the rule of law requires the adoption of new norms such the powers of \nthe  state  being  confined  to  those  that  are  stated  under  the  law.  However,  the  current  legal \nframework  contains  many  gaps  in  the  laws  that  are  and  will  be  needed  to  regulate  a  market \neconomy;3 the process of preparing legal documents is time wasting, sometimes irrational, and \nfocuses  more  on  quantity  than  quality.  The  preparation  is  carried  out  without  adequate  policy \nstudies or research and consultation, often leading to immediate needs for revision.4 The quality \nof  many  of  the  existing  and  new  laws  is  not  high,  rendering  their  interpretation  and  their \napplication in business or private matters problematic. Viet Nam therefore needs to make urgent \nimprovements to the quality of the law formulation process so as to provide a sounder basis for \n\n                                                 \n3  Such  as,  for  example,  the  regulation  of  monopoly  power,  capital,  financial,  real  estate,  and  labor  markets,  and \n\nintellectual property. \n\n4  See  also  the  background  paper  PAR  Policies  and  Major  Issues.  2002.  Report  on  public  administration  reform  in \n\nViet Nam prepared for ADB. Mekong Economics. May.  \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n33\n\ntheir application and enforcement.5 The law making process through the National Assembly also \nneeds  reform  to  improve  efficiency,  including  the  opportunities  for  proper  examination  of  draft \nlaws,  recognizing  that  Viet  Nam  has  a  long  list  of  laws  that  it  wishes  to  enact  during  the \ntransition to a socialist-oriented market economy. \n\n15.  The Ministry of Justice has recently undertaken a highly consultative and quite successful \nassessment of the needs of the legal sector, with support from several development partners, \nas a basis for the implementation of reforms in the legal sector. A legal sector reform strategy, \noutlining a range of sequenced reform actions and measures for implementation, is expected to \nbe put before the Government later this year by the Ministry of Justice.6 Government support for \nmaking the necessary reforms, which will require a long-term program, is high.7 \n\n16.  Since 1994, the Government has been engaged in reforming administrative procedures so \nas  to  overcome  red  tape  by  reducing  the  complexity  of  administrative  requirements  and  to \nimprove service delivery.8 To date this has focused particularly on business-related issues such \nas  foreign  investment  and  business  registration  under  the  Business  Enterprise  Law  of  1999. \nHowever,  many  procedures  remain  complicated  or  unresponsive  to  needs  in  areas  such  as \nconstruction,  land  ownership,  land  use  in  urban  areas,  and  petition  handling.9  In  1996,  the \nGovernment launched trials in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, and Hai Phong of the \u201cone-stop shop\u201d \nmodel of service delivery. These have recently been evaluated favorably and the Government is \nnow planning extension of the delivery model to the provinces with the potential to improve the \nquality  and  standard  of  service  delivery,  particularly  to  the  poor.  The  Government  is  exploring \nalternative public service delivery management mechanisms with MOHA.  \n\n2.  Organizational Reform  \n\n17.  There is much scope for rationalization of ministries and agencies to clarify functions and \nauthority;  to  remove  areas  of  overlap;  to  reduce  the  number  of  agencies  either by  abolition  or \nmerger;  and  to  simplify  the  number  of  levels  of  the  organizational  structures.10  The  first  step \ntoward  restructuring  was  the  passage  of  the  New  Law  on  Government  Organizations  in \nNovember 2001. The Government has since gained approval from the National Assembly for a \nnew  structure  for  the  government  apparatus  which  reduces  the  number  of  agencies  and \nresolves a number of areas of overlap between agencies. The Government has announced that \nit will soon issue a new draft Decree 15, which is to set out the functions of the Prime Minister, \nministers, ministries, etc. \n\n Relations  among  the  different  levels  of  Government  are  complex,  involving  multiple \n18. \nreporting  points  between  administrative  organizations  within,  to,  and  from  each  level.  While  a \nsignificant  degree  of  autonomy  has  been  extended  to  local  administrations  with  regard  to \ndispositions  of  allocated  budgets  and  adoption  and  implementation  of  local  socioeconomic \n\n                                                 \n5  See ADB working paper PAR Action Program #1 on Reforms of Drafting, Promulgating and Enhancing the Quality \n\nof Legal Normative Documents. 2002.

May. \n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 1 \n\nplans,11  a  common  public  perception  is  that  the  Government  is  overcentralized  but  that  the \ninstitutional capacity needed for greater decentralization is weak.  \n\n19.  Efforts  to  combat  corruption  have  involved  legal  reform,  reform  of  administrative \nprocedures, and reform of the structure and remuneration of the civil service, and strengthening \ncomplaint channels for citizens.12 In January 2002, the Government issued a decree requiring, \ninter alia, civil servants to declare their assets and those of their relatives so that the information \nis  available  to  agencies  responsible  for  investigating  property  accumulation.  The  Public \nAdministration  Reform  (PAR)  will  reinforce  this  through  the  planned  development  of  an  ethics \ncode for civil servants. \n\n3.  Human Resources: Improving the Quality of the Civil Service \n\n \n\n20.  The overall quality of the civil service is weak. This in turn impacts adversely on levels of \norganizational performance. Many current staff are seen as inadequately skilled or motivated to \nproperly perform their duties.13 While Viet Nam seeks a civil service that is of higher quality in \nthe  sense  that  it  is  competent,  professional  and  ethical,  there  is  a  need  to  develop  detailed \nprofiles  of  the  professional  and  other  skills  required  by  civil  servants  to  support  policy-making \nand  service  delivery.  Much  of  the  existing  legal  and  policy  framework  for  the  operation  of  the \ncivil  service  is  fragmented  and  the  various  laws  and  decrees  need  to  be  reviewed  and \nmodernized so as to set out the roles, duties and conditions of service in a contemporary way. \nMore  recently,  MOHA  has  been  preparing  a  submission  on  the  scope  for  decentralization  of \npersonnel management. The future institutional arrangements and the powers for managing the \ncivil  service  would  need  to  be  part  of  that  examination.14  While  there  have  been  a  number  of \nincreases in salary paid to civil servants, most do not earn a living wage.15 This affects levels of \nmotivation  in  work  and  encourages  rent-seeking  behavior.  Following  review,  proposals  for \nraising salaries through a series of increases to a minimum wage level and for fully monetizing \nsalary, and for linking pay and performance, have been formulated and are to be submitted to \nthe Government.16  \n\n21.  Paradoxically, there is lack of qualified staff to meet the new requirements and to perform \naccordingly  whereas  at  the  same  time  there  are  many  who  are  unable  to  meet  the  current \nperformance  requirements.  The  Government  launched  a  rightsizing  program  in  200017  with  a \ntarget of a 15% reduction in payroll. The program is ongoing with about 3% of civil servants18 so \nfar affected. Staff who are made redundant are compensated. Two key concerns are to ensure \nthat the most inefficient civil servants are made redundant and provided with compensation and, \nsecond,  that  the  exercise  is  linked  to  the  planned  restructuring  of  the  civil  service  toward \nensuring that civil servants with the right skills are placed in the right job. \n\n22.  The  Government  has  therefore  given  more  attention  proportionately  to  improving  the \nquality of civil servants, as they will ultimately be the ones who carry out the reforms and must in \nturn reform themselves. Training and retraining are a critical part of the Government\u2019s strategy \n                                                 \n11  The New Law on the Organization of the Government of November 2001 enables the delegation of power to the \n\nlocal level, especially in the areas of budget and organization of personnel. \n\n12  Summary of Viet Nam Governance Assessment in Clay Wescott (ed.), Key Governance Issues in Cambodia, Lao \n\nPDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam. 2001.

However,  training  policy  and  delivery  arrangements \nmust themselves be renovated and refocused, and the quality of training improved to play this \nrole  effectively.  Improvements  through  training  need  to  be  linked  to  and  integrated  with \nappropriate and necessary policies on personnel recruitment, promotion, and development.  \n\n4. \n\nFinancial Management Reform \n\n23. \n Financial  management  reform  in  Viet  Nam  has  proceeded  slowly  and  until  relatively \nrecently  was  treated  as  separate  from  PAR.  The  passage  of  the  1997  Budget  Law  provided \ngreater transparency to expenditure on the national level, but for expenditures at the local level \nthis is not so, particularly because of the powers that provinces etc. have to raise some of their \nown revenue.19 Government reviews,20 undertaken with funding agency support, have proposed \na  package  of  measures  to  improve  transparency,  provide  a  forward  estimate  process,  better \ntarget  the  allocations  of  funds  to  key  sectors,  and  improve  accounting  practices  and  financial \nmanagement  systems.  These  are  at  an  advanced  stage  of  consideration.  Recently,  after \nsuccessful experimentation in Ho Chi Minh City, the Prime Minister agreed to expand the pilot \nblock  grant  and  staffing  scheme  in  administrative  agencies.21  A  related  decision  of  the  Prime \nMinister  approves  a  new  financial  mechanism  for  administrative  agencies,  which  provides  a \ngreater  degree  of  autonomy,  flexibility,  and  certainty  to  those  agencies  in  managing  their \nfinancial resources.22 \n\nE.  Management of Reform Implementation \n\n24.  Since 1997, responsibility for oversight of PAR implementation has been assigned to the \nPAR  Steering  Committee,  chaired  by  the  Prime  Minister.  It  has  high-level  membership  drawn \nfrom  ministers  responsible  for  the  various  ministries  and  agencies  involved  in  implementation \nand this has recently been strengthened through the addition of a deputy prime minister and a \nsenior  CPV  official.

This is one of the \nkey  pillars  of  the  Country  Strategy  and  Program  (2002\u20132004),  endorsed  by  the  ADB  Board  in \nJanuary  2002.  In  its  operations  in  Viet  Nam  to  date,  ADB  has  exerted  significant  efforts  in \nsupporting governance-related activities; especially through technical assistance (TA). Besides \nthe institutional strengthening and capacity building support attached to loan financing, ADB has \nbeen active in providing governance-related assistance to key central institutions including the \nMinistry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  the  State  Auditor  General  Office  (SAGO),  the  Ministry  of \nFinance, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA), and the Office of the Government (OOG). The \nADB has also extended considerable support to the Government for the formulation of a PAR \nStrategy and the PAR Master Program, 2001\u20132010. \n \nAfter  approval  of  the  PAR  Master  Program  by  the  Prime  Minister  in  September  2001, \n2. \nADB  was  behind  the  initiative  for  a  joint  government-donor  workshop,  held  as  a  retreat  in  Ha \nLong  Bay,  to  assist  the  Government  to  focus  on  the  detailed  implementation  implications. \nTogether with United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), governments of Sweden and \nDenmark,  ADB  cofunded  this  workshop  and  a  subsequent  follow-up  workshop  (held  in  April \n2002)  on  the  implementation  of  the  PAR  Master  Program.  In  these  workshops,  attended  by \nhigh-level government officials, and in the consultative group meetings (in December 2001 and \nJune 2002), ADB urged the Government to allocate high priority and the requisite financial and \nhuman resources to ensure effective implementation of the PAR Master Program. Also, during \nPresident Chino\u2019s visit to Viet Nam in October 2000, he strongly emphasized governance and \nPAR issues and offered substantial financial and TA support from ADB.  \n \nADB is now recognized as one of the lead funding partners in Viet Nam in the areas of \n3. \ngovernance and PAR. With the provision of a program loan to support the implementation of the \nPAR  Master  Program,  and  the  ongoing  and  planned  support  in  legal  system  development, \nADB\u2019s role in the areas of governance and PAR will become more strategic and pivotal.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nUntil  early  2002,  it  was  government  policy  not  to  borrow  for  PAR  projects,  particularly \nbecause  PAR  was  considered  too  sensitive  an  area.  However,  by  the  time  of  ADB\u2019s  country \nprogramming  mission \nthis  policy.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  decision  to  change  this  policy  and  borrow  for  PAR  is  a  landmark  one.  The \nrequest  to  ADB  to  provide  financing  for  PAR  Master  Program  implementation,  formally \nsubmitted to the 2002 country programming mission, represents a major breakthrough: greater \nimpetus  can  now  be  given  to  PAR,  especially  if  more  resources  can  be  tapped  by  the \nGovernment  for  this  purpose.  The  decision  of  the  Government  also  reflects  not  only  its \ncommitment to PAR but also increased openness to policy dialogue. \n \n5. \nIn  recognizing  the  strategic  importance  and  also  the  urgency  of  the  request,  ADB \nresponded, positively, to the Government. The request was treated as highly urgent because (i) \nthe  Government  was  already  into  the  second  year  of  the  implementation  period  of  the  PAR \nMaster Program; and (ii) for ADB support to be timely and have due impact, it was desirable to \ncapture  at  least  3  years,  2003\u20132005,  of  the  first  phase  (2001\u20132005)  of  the  PAR  Master \nProgram.  ADB,  therefore,  moved  expeditiously,  to  mobilize  the  resources  and  the  expertise \n\nthe  Government  had  reviewed \n\nThe Government\u2019s Request \n\nin  April  2002, \n\n\fAppendix 1, Annex 2 \n\n39\n\n \n\nnecessary, to process a financing proposal within 2002, although such a loan proposal had not \nbeen originally included in the ADB\u2019s planned assistance to Viet Nam for 2002 or 2003. \n \nC.  Development of the Program Loan Proposal  \n \n6.    The approach adopted to formulate the program loan proposal was highly consultative and \nparticipatory.  The  preparation  of  the  program  loan  proposal  was  undertaken  jointly  by  the  two \nkey  concerned  agencies,  i.e.,  MOHA  and  OOG,  and  ADB.  Through  a  series  of  workshops, \nrepresentatives  from  all  key  government  agencies,  the  Communist  Party  of  Viet  Nam  (CPV), \nand the National Assembly Secretariat were involved in the program loan proposal preparatory \nwork. Also, consultations were held with key partners active in the area of PAR, such as UNDP, \nWorld  Bank,  governments  of  Sweden,  Denmark,  Netherlands,  aid  agencies  of  Germany, \nNorway  and  Switzerland  and  United  Kingdom.  From  the  outset  it  was  agreed  with  the \nGovernment that a Joint Task Team, comprising government and ADB representatives, would \nwork jointly to develop the program loan proposal. A high-level coordinating committee (HLCC), \ncomprising  vice  ministers  from  OOG  and  MOHA  and  the  ADB  country  director  for  Viet  Nam, \nwas  also  set  up  specifically  to  oversee  the  whole  process.  At  the  request  of  ADB,  the  UNDP \nresident  representative  was  invited  to  join  the  HLCC.  The  timetable  that  was  agreed  with  the \nGovernment to complete the work was extremely tight, and the Government was made aware of \n(i) the need to demonstrate commitment and support at key levels within the Government, and \n(ii) the need to ensure the fullest possible participation by all key stakeholders in critical stages \nof  the  formulation  of  the  program  loan  proposal.  An  intensive  effort  was  first  required  to \nundertake and to support the fact-finding process.  \n \nThe  work  of  the  ADB  Fact-Finding  Mission,  which  began  in  late  May,  was  conducted \n7. \nover an extended period up to 26 July 2002. Prior to this, the two key concerned vice ministers \nfrom MOHA and OOG traveled to ADB in Manila for consultation with senior staff and a meeting \nwith  Management.  As  a  first  part  of  the  fact-finding  process,  ADB  commissioned,  by  quickly \nmobilizing  domestic  and  international  expertise  knowledgeable  on  Viet  Nam  PAR  issues,  two \nstatus  reports  and  a  set  of  eight  analytical/diagnostic  working  papers.  The  working  papers \ncovered:  (i)  a  diagnostic  analysis  (on  the  structure,  content,  coherence,  interlinkages, \nsequencing  issues,  etc.)  of  the  reform  agenda  under  the  PAR  Master  Program;  and \n(ii) identification  of  the  policy,  institutional,  organizational,  and  administrative  measures \nnecessary to ensure effective implementation of the PAR Master Program.1 These reports and \npapers provided baseline information on the public administration system and reforms to date in \nViet  Nam.  They  were  discussed  at  the  working  sessions  of  the  Joint  Task  Team,  in  May  and \nJune  2002.  The  working  papers  were  translated  into  Vietnamese,  and  used  to  facilitate  the \ndiscussions  with  the  Government,  focusing  on  particular  PAR  implementation  issues.  For  this \npurpose,  a  series  of  intensive  working  and  brainstorming  sessions  were  held,  in  the  form  of \nworkshops  and  retreats  in  late  May  and  early  June,  involving  key  stakeholders  from  the \nGovernment and external funding agencies.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   The activities and outputs accomplished under several ADB TAs served as an important basis for and underpinned \nthe  work  of  the  Fact-Finding  Mission.  These  include:  TA  No.  2673-VIE,  Supporting  the  Public  Administration \nReform  Program,  for  $650,000,  approved  in  October  1996;  TA  No.  3023-VIE,  Strengthening  Capacity  for  Public \nAdministration  Reform,  Phase  II,  for  $995,000,  approved  in  May  1998;  TA  No.  3652-VIE,  Institutional  Support  to \nthe Office of the Government, for $500,000, approved in May 2001. There has also been extensive analytical work, \nincluding: \u201cSummary of Viet Nam Governance Assessment\u201d, in Clay Wescott, ed., 2001, Key Governance Issues in \nCambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam. Manila, ADB; and \u201cBuilding Modern Governance\u201d in World Bank and \nADB, 2001, Viet Nam Development Report, Hanoi, World Bank. \n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 1, Annex 2 \n\nThe Fact-Finding Mission was formally launched with a workshop retreat from 12 to 15 \n8. \nJune 2002 in Ha Long, Quang Ninh province, organized by MOHA, OOG, and ADB. This was \npreceded  by  a  two-day  workshop  on  30\u201331  May  2002  held  in  Hanoi.  Working  papers  were \nprepared and presented on the overall implementation of PAR and on PAR APs no. 4 and no. 7 \nin  particular.  At  both  these  workshops,  up  to  50  representatives  from  various  government \nministries  and  central  agencies  participated,  including  MOHA,  OOG,  the  PAR  Steering \nCommittee,  CPV,  the  National  Assembly  Secretariat,  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment, \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Justice,  etc.,  as  well  as  representatives  from  UNDP.  The \nMission also met individually with ministries and government agencies, and with representatives \nof the funding community.  \n \n9. \nThe outcome of this fact-finding process formed the basis to develop an aide memoire, \nwhich was presented to the Government at a wrap-up meeting on 26 July 2002. Subsequent to \nthis, and following a management review meeting held in Manila on 12 August, appraisal work \non the program loan proposal was undertaken. This was also done over an extended period of \ntime, from late August to early October 2002. During the appraisal stage, extensive discussions \nwere  held  with  MOHA  and  OOG,  respectively,  to  fully  consider  such  issues  as  coherence, \ninterlinkages,  implementability,  timing,  and  the  sequencing  of  the  measures  and  actions  to  be \nincluded in the policy matrix. Some key principles that underpinned these discussions included \nthe need to ensure: \n\nselection of measures and actions that have full government ownership and that \nwould be effective in achieving desired outcomes;  \n\nthat the overall mix and number of measures and actions provide the appropriate \nbreadth of coverage of key issues in the PAR Master Program, while focusing on \nthe areas (APs no. 4 and no. 7) for which the Government has sought financing; \nand \n\nappropriate  linkages  between  the  various  measures  and  actions  and  the \nsequencing  of  these  with  due  consideration  to  what  is  realistic  and  achievable, \nnot  only  under  action  programs  no. 4  and  no. 7  but  also  through  the  measures \nand actions in other parts of the PAR Master Program, such as structural reform, \nwhere their implementation is related to and will affect the success of APs no. 4 \nand no. 7. \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\n10.    Within the framework of these foregoing considerations, the program loan proposal was \ndeveloped  to  reflect  the  objectives,  and  the  measures  and  actions  under  the  PAR  Master \nProgram that are critical to its success, but with particular focus on APs no. 4 and no. 7.  \n \n11. \nThe  development  of  the  policy  matrix  and  the  formulation  of  relevant  measures  and \nactions were carried out by the Joint Task Team, in a highly process oriented, collaborative, and \nconsultative  manner.  This  led  to  the  successful  signing  of  the  memorandum  of  understanding \nbetween the Government and ADB on 24 October 2002.  \n \n\n\fPOLICY MATRIX   \n \nProgram Goal \nTo build a democratic, clean, strong, professional, modern, effective and efficient public administration system, capable of supporting nation building and development \n \n\nDevelopment \nObjectives \n\nPhase 1 (2003\u20132005) \n\nMeasures and Actions \n\nTimeline \n(action by) \n\nMonitoring \nArrangements/Verifiable \nIndicators \n\nPhase 2a \n(2006\u20132008) \n \n\nPhase 3a \n(2008\u20132010) \n \n\nA.

All  of  these  are  valuable  contributors  to  achieving  poverty  reduction, \ngrowth, and social development. There is a strong link between effective administrations at all levels and poverty \nreduction. The Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) calls for accelerating the reform \nof institutions and polices that affect poor people.  This loan and attached technical assistance (TA) will aim, inter \nalia, at ensuring that the PAR will be implemented in a pro-poor manner.   \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\n     Proposed Classification: Other  (governance) \n\nPAR measures will have significant positive impact upon poverty reduction.  \n\nAs the result of economic growth by efficient and effective PAR, more opportunities will be created for the poor to \nengage in trading and improve home-based enterprises. \n\nStrong  indirect  benefits  are  expected  to  reach  the  poor  in  terms  of  improved  service  delivery  and  promoting \nparticipation and democracy. Any efficiency gain in service delivery will directly benefit the poor. The poor's access \nto  basic  services  and  infrastructure,  especially  in  the  mountainous  regions  and  in  poor  urban  areas,  must  be \nensured as a priority.  \n\nCareful consideration should be given to provision of services through the private sector to enhance public service \nprovision to fill the gaps. While private sector involvement in providing services could help expand the number of \njobs and in the process create new employment opportunities, prices of services will likely go up. To minimize such \nimpacts, services at the community level need to be provided at increased cost efficiency. \n\nDecentralized  public  administration  should  make  local  level  government  be  accountable  to  the  poor  for  their \nparticipation in decision-making on development programs and delivery of services. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nKey stakeholders and their capacity, needs, and constraints were identified.  \n\nStakeholder analysis prepared \n\nYes  \n\nThe  program  preparation  team  conducted  stakeholder  consultations  with  national  and  local  officials,  funding \nagencies, and nongovernment organizations with experience in working in different aspects of the PAR to date.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nParticipation Strategy \n\n \n\nTo be prepared \n\nStakeholder participation could be sought during the implementation of the program, for instance, at the local level, \nparticularly in the context of decentralization. Special attention should be paid to the needs of the poor, women and \nethnic  minorities.  Also,  training  support,  career  development  and  mechanisms  to  increase  participation  of  these \ngroups (large and small) in local authorities, management boards and service delivery should be promoted under \nthe program loan.  \n\nA. \n \n\n \n \nB. \n \n\n \n \nC. \n \n\n \n \n \n\n                                                           \n1   Details are given in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n\f66\n\n \n\nD. \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nPotential Issues \n\nSignificant, \nNot Significant, \nUncertain, None \n\nResettlement \n\nNone \n\n \n\nGender \n\nSignificant \n\nSubject \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nPlan Required \n\nNone \n\nProposed ADTA \nto MOHA will \ndevelop detailed \nproposals to \nfurther enhance \ngender equity in \ncivil service. \n\nCompliance with the provisions regarding \nmainstreaming gender in policies of human resources \ndevelopment, in personnel work and public \nadministration under the Plan of Action (PoA) already \napproved, for the Advancement of Vietnamese \nWomen by 2005.  \nAffirmative actions for women with regard to \nrecruitment, placement, training and career \ndevelopment/ promotion, as per PoA2.  \nRightsizing of public service and decentralization of \nfunctions to local bodies may reduce the absolute \nnumber of women at the decision-making level.  \nMOHA is finalizing a report called \u201cAn In-depth Study \nof Female Civil Servant in Personnel and \nOrganization Departments and Provincials \ncommittee, prepared under a Sweden International \nDevelopment Agency (SIDA) -funded TA. \nCapacity-building and public awareness activities \nfully incorporate gender perspectives and \nsensitization.  \nGender integrated courses in public administration \ntraining curriculum, included in the Policy Matrix.  \n\nPossible structural and temporary unemployment, \nhowever, minimal impact during 2003\u20132005 is \nanticipated. Negative impact is minimized through \nseverance package and other compensatory \nmeasures being provided by the Government.  \nRightsizing of the public service will need to ensure \nthe rational reallocation of staff into areas which are \nconsidered critical, including at subnational levels.  \nStrengthening social protection by making \nimprovements to social safety nets in order to \nmitigate the long-term effects of labor retrenchment \nwill also need to be undertaken, under Ministry of \nLabor, Invalids and Social Affairs. The mid-term \nreview of the program loan implementation would \nlook at the issue further. \n\nNo negative impact is likely.  \nAffirmative actions may be considered.  \nThe program will require provision that capacity \nbuilding and public awareness activities are fully \nsensitive to social and cultural values, and \nincorporate the needs and interests of ethnic \nminorities through their active participation.  \nCulturally appropriate communication strategies may \nbe required. \n\nAffordability \n\nUncertain \n\nLabor \n\nSignificant \n\nAccess of the poor to services must be preserved in \nparticular in the areas of education and health. \n\nTo be determined \n\nNo additional plan \nis required under \nthe program loan. \n\nIndigenous  \nPeople (IP) \n\nSignificant \n\nIP action in the \ndetailed proposals \nto be developed \nunder the \nproposed ADTA \nto MOHA. \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n\n \n\nNot Significant \n\nNo other risks or vulnerabilities are anticipated.  \n\nNo \n\n\f \n\n \n\nSUPPORT TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORM MASTER PROGRAM \n\nDesign Summary \n\nProgram Performance Targets \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nPROGRAM FRAMEWORK   \n\n  \n\n \n\nMonitoring \nMechanisms \n\n \n\u2022  Progress reports \non Viet Nam\u2019s \nSocioeconomic \nDevelopment \nStrategy and \nComprehensive \nPoverty Reduction \nand Growth \nStrategy (CPRGS) \n\n \n\n\u2022  Annual PAR \n\nprogress reports \n\n\u2022  PAR evaluation \n\nreports \n\n \nGoal: To build a \ndemocratic, clean, \nstrong, \nprofessional, \neffective, and \nefficient public \nadministration \nsystem capable of \nsupporting nation \nbuilding and \ndevelopment. \n \n\n \nPurpose: To \nenhance the \ntransparency, \naccountability, and \nquality of the civil \nservice and \nimprove efficiency \nand cost-\neffectiveness of \npublic service \ndelivery. \n \n \n \n\n \n\u2022  Appropriate  and  enabling  policy  frameworks  and  effective  regulatory \n\nmechanisms in place to: \n\n \n\n- \n- \n\nfrom 2000 to 2010, double gross domestic product (GDP) \nfrom 2000 to 2010, reduce the international and national standard-base \npoverty incidence by two fifths and three fifths, respectively \n\n-  provide jobs to 1.4 million\u20131.5 million people per annum \n- \n-  provide essential infrastructure for 75% of poor communes by 2005 and \n\nraise the share of female workers to 50% in total new jobs by 2010 \n\n- \n\n100% by 2010 \nimprove accessibility of the poor to the basic social services, production \nservices  and  resources  (quantitative  targets\u2014for  instance,  the  poor's \naccess  to  safe  drinking  water;  reduction  of  the  infant  mortality  rate  to \n30/1,000;  reduction  of  the  maternal  mortality  rate  to  80/100,000;  and \nreduction of under-5 malnutrition to 25% by 2010) \n\n \n \n\u2022  Vision  and  mandate  for  a  results-based  and  performance-oriented  civil \nservice  required  under  the  Public  Administration  Reform  Master  Program \n(PAR MP) established by March 2003 (Ministry of Home Affairs [MOHA]). \n\u2022  Enhanced  incentives  for  improved  performance  and  accountability  of  civil \nservants  through  implementation  of  revised  salary  structure  by  December \n2005 (MOHA) \nImproved  organizational  performance, \nresources  optimization,  and \npersonnel performance through initial phase of rightsizing for Phase I pilot \nagencies completed by December 2005 (MOHA) \nImproved  system  of  incentives  and  accountability  to  support  service \noriented civil service and to sustain PAR implementation introduced by July \n2003 (MOHA) \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  Report  on  corruption  and  ethics  tabled  with  National  Assembly,  and \nGovernment to follow up with appropriate remedial policies and actions by \nDecember 2004 (State Inspectorate) \n\n \n \n \n\n \nAssumption: \n\u2022  Full political commitment to \nreforms and acceptance of \ntheir implications and \nconsequences \n\nRisks: \n\u2022  Changes in political \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\ncommitment  \nInsufficient understanding of \nthe role of the state and \npublic administration in a \nsocialist market economy \nInadequate understanding of \nreform measures needed, \nincluding sequencing \n\u2022  Resistance of impacted \nagencies and officials \n Insufficient financial and/or \nhuman resources for timely \nimplementation of reforms \n\n\u2022 \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n6\n\n \n\n6\n7\n\n\f  \n\n6\n8\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n6\n \n\ni\n\nOutputs: \n1.
