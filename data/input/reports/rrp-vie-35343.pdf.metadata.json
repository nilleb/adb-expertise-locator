The \nsubsequent two phases, subject to request by the Government, will \nbe implemented back to back during the period 2006\u20132010. \n   \nRationale  The public administration system in Viet Nam is characterized by \nvarious  weaknesses.  These  include:  (i) inefficient  and  ineffective \ninstitutional  setups,  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  that  do  not \nadequately support, and in many cases hinder, the socioeconomic \ndevelopment  initiatives  of  the  country;  (ii) organizational  systems \nand processes that are generally cumbersome, highly bureaucratic, \nand  opaque;  (iii) a  poorly  paid  civil  service  characterized  by \npervasive rent-seeking behavior, and constrained by inefficiencies in \nmanagement; and (iv) a public finance system not fully equipped to \nmeet the complex fiscal and financial challenges of a fast-growing \neconomy integrating into the global market. \n \nSince 1986, with the adoption of the policy of renovation or Doi Moi \nthat has included an extensive reform agenda, Viet Nam has been \nin transition, moving from a centrally planned to a socialist-oriented \nmarket  economy.  While  tangible  progress  has  been  achieved \nthrough the structural and economic reforms, the country continues \nto face many of the major socioeconomic problems and challenges \nof an economy in transition.  \n \nThe  Government  recognizes  that  to  realize  the  country\u2019s \ndevelopment goals, including those contained in its Comprehensive \nPoverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS), speedier and \nmore effective reform of the public administration is now of strategic \nimportance.  \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The overall objective of the program loan proposal (the program) is \nto support and facilitate the implementation of the Government's \nPAR MP and to assist in building a professional, modern, effective \nand efficient administration system for the Borrower. The program ", "ii  \nwill  finance  implementation  of  two  of  the  seven  PAR  action \nprograms (APs): (i) training and retraining to improve the quality of \npublic  officials  under  AP  no. 4;  and  (ii) modernization  of  the \nadministrative system, including computerization and e-government \ninitiatives under AP no. 7. \n   \nCost Estimates  The cost of implementing six APs (including APs no. 4 and no. 7), \nbased on the information available, is estimated to be $141.8 million \nfor 2003\u20132005. The AP on salary reform is not included as it is not \nyet clear what precise proposal will be implemented. The costs of \nimplementing  AP  no. 4  (training)  and  AP  no. 7  (administrative \nmodernization) are estimated to be $28.2 million and $60 million \nrespectively, based on the measures and actions listed in the policy \nmatrix, during the period 2003\u20132005. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The program cluster covers three phases of loan financing and TA \nsupport for the PAR MP implementation during the period 2003\u2013\n2010, as follows: \n \nPhase I:  2003\u20132005;  \nPhase II:  2006\u20132008; and \nPhase III:  2008\u20132010 \n \nThis loan proposal is for the first phase covering the period 2003\u2013\n2005 for an amount totaling $45 million. This amount is expected to \nbe disbursed before the end of 2005. The loan for Phase I will be \nreleased in two tranches and utilized before the end of 2005. The \nfirst tranche will be available upon loan effectiveness; the second \ntranche will be released upon satisfactory compliance with specified \ntranche release measures and actions indicated in the policy matrix. \n \nFunding proposals and proposed measures and actions for Phase \nII, based on the progress and performance of implementation of \nPhase  I,  will  be  presented  for  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nBoard consideration during the latter part of 2005, and for Phase III \nby mid-2008. \n \nVarious specific policy measures and actions are included in Phase \nI. A number of relevant general measures and actions have also \nbeen indicated for phases II and III. For Phase I, some of these \nmeasures  and  actions  have  been  specified  as  tranche  release \nmeasures and actions. They will also form the basis of performance \nassessment for consideration of loan financing into phases II and III, \nsubsequently. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The first phase of the program cluster will involve an equivalent of \n$45 million in various currencies of special drawing rights (SDR), \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  a  term  of  24  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years and an interest rate of 1.0% \nduring the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \n   \n   ", "  iii\nPeriod of Utilization  Until December 2005 \n   \nEstimated Program  31 December 2005 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agencies  Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) and the Office of the Government \n(OOG) will be joint executing agencies for the program under the \nover-all leadership of the Prime Minister.  \n   \nImplementation  MOHA and OOG will be jointly responsible for implementing the \nArrangements  policy and institutional measures and actions under part A of the \npolicy  matrix.  MOHA  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  the \nimplementation of the policy and institutional measures and actions \nunder AP no. 4 (part B of the policy matrix) while OOG will be the \nimplementing agency for measures and actions under AP no. 7 (part \nC of the policy matrix).  \n \nTo ensure the effective handling of this implementing agency role \nand  responsibility,  program  management  units  have  been \nestablished within MOHA and OOG.  \n \nThe  High-Level  Coordinating  Committee  (HLCC),  which  was \nestablished for the formulation of the program, will continue and \nmeet formally at least once every quarter to monitor implementation \nprogress. \n   \nProcurement  The proceeds from the program loan will be utilized for procuring \ngoods  and  services  produced  and  originating  in  ADB  member \ncountries,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in \naccordance with standard public procurement procedures in Viet \nNam and normal private sector commercial practices acceptable to \nADB. \n \nThe proceeds of the proposed program loan will be disbursed for a \nbroad range of imports, subject to a negative list of ineligible items. \nLoan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  on  the  basis  of  a  certification \nprovided by the Borrower, confirming that in each year in which the \nproposed program loan is expected to be disbursed, the value of \ntotal  imports  minus  (i) imports  from  nonmember  countries, \n(ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) imports financed under other official \ndevelopment assistance, is equal to or greater than the amount \nexpected to be disbursed during the year. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  While  the  key  elements  of  the  overall  PAR  design  and \nGrants  implementation program will benefit from TA already provided by \nother funding bodies within a framework coordinated by the United \nNations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  additional  TAs  are \nnecessary  to  cover  specific  policy  and  technical  areas  that  are \ncritical to ensure the success of the program specifically, and the \nPAR MP generally.  \n   \n \n   ", "iv  \nThree specific areas of need are to be addressed over a 30-month \nperiod through TA linked directly to the program. These include: \n(i) institutional  and  capacity-building  support  to  MOHA  for  the \nimplementation of the training and retraining AP, including human \nresources development and public service delivery reforms, in an \namount of $920,000, to be co-financed by ADB and the Government \nof  France;  (ii) support  to  OOG  in  the  implementation  of  the \nadministrative modernization AP, including computerization and e-\ngovernment initiatives, in an amount of $1.27 million to be financed \nby ADB; and (iii) policy coordination support to OOG, in an amount \nof $815,000 to be co-financed by ADB and the Government of New \nZealand. Further co-financing possibility is being explored. \n \nTeams of international and domestic consultants will be mobilized \nfor  each  TA.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  as  individuals  in \naccordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants, \nincluding procedures acceptable to the ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The intended reforms will bring certain benefits, including a more \nBeneficiaries  accountable, responsive, and efficient public sector that is better \norganized,  structured,  resourced,  and  staffed  to  assist  the \nGovernment in achieving its objectives. This is expected to lead to \nbudgetary savings in the public administration system as a result of \nimproved institutional efficiency, such as will flow both from having \nbetter trained, more professional, and better skilled civil servants \nand from the impact of computerization. It will also bring indirect \nbenefits through reducing transaction costs and opportunities for \nrent seeking while freeing private sector time and resources to deal \nwith production issues rather than with \u201cred tape\u201d.  \n \nThough the poor have a relatively better social standing in Viet Nam \nthan  in  most  countries  at  comparable  income  levels,  they  still \nconstitute the socially and politically weakest group. They are the \nleast  able  to  handle  rent  seeking,  or  to  cut  through  red  tape. \nUndesirable arbitrary bureaucratic behavior most directly hinders \ntheir economic endeavors. Thus, the poor and the vulnerable should \nbe the greatest beneficiaries of the strengthened and accelerated \nreforms assisted by the program.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The program entails three types of risks: some of the necessary \nmeasures may not be agreed; some of the agreed measures may \nnot be carried out; and some may be carried out but with unintended \nimpacts. The first type of risk is due particularly to the fact that the \nprogram  does  not  necessarily  constitute  an  ideal  set  of  reform \nmeasures  aimed  at  the  swiftest  possible  transformation  or \nmodernization  of  Viet  Nam's  public  administration.  Given  the \ncountry-specific considerations, the program focuses on a set of \nmeasures that are feasible, on which consensus could be reached, \nand that, if properly sequenced and effectively implemented, will \nbring gradual but tangible improvements. In regard to the second \n   ", "  v\ntype  of  risk,  resistance  naturally  exists  to  a  program  that  both \ntargets the civil service and is to be implemented by it, and this is \nlikely  to  slow  and  temporarily  hinder  individual  program \ncomponents.  A  sustained  program  of  information,  publicity,  and \nconsultation  between  key  stakeholders  that  is  included  in  the \nprogram is intended to help reduce and overcome such resistance. \nThe third type of risk is more difficult to analyze. Some program \ncomponents  may  have  unintended  and  unexpected  negative \nconsequences.  Some  of  these  may  well  be  potentially  more \ndamaging to the economy and the population, and to continuing \nreforms themselves, than delays.  \n \nTo minimize these three types of risk, the program carefully avoids \nendorsing  vaguely  defined  actions.  It  also  provides  for  early \nanalytical efforts intended to detect possible negative impacts and \nthus avoid them. To further help ensure success, a monitoring and \nevaluation system and a management information system are also \nbeing established at MOHA. Provisions have also been made for \ncareful  tranching  of  the  program  and  for  regularly  sharing  and \ndiscussing issues with ADB. ADB also intends to deploy a higher \nthan normal specialist staff input to support the Government in this \ncomplex monitoring effort. All these measures should help bring \nunintended  delays  as  well  as  possible  unforeseen  negative \nconsequences to the early attention of the Government and ADB, \nand thus help reduce risks by generating early corrective actions.   \n \nAdequate resourcing of reform implementation will also be essential \nfor  success  and  assurances  have  been  sought  from  the \nGovernment on this point. Implementation must be managed in a \npractical,  realistic,  and  sequenced  way,  in  recognition  that \nadjustments may be required in light of experience and that it will be \nessential to manage properly the linkages between the various parts \nof the reforms. \n \n   ", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster concept to Support Implementation of the Public Administration Reform (PAR) \nMaster Program (MP) in Viet Nam, (ii) a proposed loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for \nPhase I of the support covering the period 2003\u20132005 (the program), and (iii) a proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) grant for support to the Office of the Government (OOG) in the \nimplementation of administrative modernization including computerization and e-government \ninitiatives. The report also describes two other proposed TAs, for (i) institutional and capacity \nbuilding support to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA), and (ii) policy coordination support to \nOOG; and including the administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of the portions of \nthe TAs to be financed by the Governments of New Zealand and France. If the proposed loan \nand TA are approved by the Board, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \nshall approve these two TAs.  \n \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n \nA.  Reforms Followed by Rapid Progress \n \n2.  With the adoption of the policy of renovation, Doi Moi, since 1986 Viet Nam has been in \ntransition from a centrally planned to a socialist-oriented market economy. Viet Nam\u2019s economy \nhas undergone radical changes, achieving almost unparalleled socioeconomic success: fast \noverall  growth,  substantial  poverty  reduction,  and  further  social  development,  including \nincreased  school  attendance,  improvements  in  the  relative  status  of  women,  and  sharp \nreductions in illiteracy. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 8% \nduring the 1990s, with household per capita consumption growing at 7.2%. Since 1992, Viet \nNam  has  followed  prudent  fiscal  and  monetary  policies,  resulting  in  price  stability  and  a \ngenerally  stable  macroeconomy.  The  overall  consequent  development  has  been  largely \nequitable.  \n \n3.   The domestic private sector, largely made up of very small productive units, has become \nthe main source of GDP with a contribution of 44%. It now accounts for nearly 25% of the labor \nforce, or up to 86% if private agriculture is included. Particularly since business registration \nrequirements were eased in 1999, household enterprises have proliferated and the number of \nformal private enterprises has nearly doubled. However, the potential for the development of the \nprivate sector remains to be more fully realized, as it is concentrated in a few industries. Some \nof  the  main  obstacles  to  private  sector  development  include  contradictory  and  unevenly \nenforced legislation; cumbersome and arbitrary administrative and taxation systems; difficult \naccess to land, credit, and business information; and inadequate physical infrastructure. State-\nowned enterprises (SOEs) still dominate industrial production. With regard to SOEs, while the \nGovernment recognizes the need for reforms, only modest progress has been achieved in \nrecent years. This also holds true for state-owned commercial banks.  \n \n4.  The dollar value of Viet Nam\u2019s exports rose sixfold from 1990 to 2002 and they have \nreoriented from the former centrally planned economies to East Asia, the European Union, and, \nincreasingly, North America. Export growth has been led by light manufacturing exports and by \nagriculture as Viet Nam turned from being a food importer into a leading exporter of several \nmajor agricultural products, with attendant benefits to the employment and incomes of the poor. \nAn early surge of petroleum exports also contributed to easing foreign exchange and budget ", "2  \nconstraints. The potential gains of traditional light industries, agriculture, and fisheries, however, \nremain far from exhausted. \n \n5.  The early years of Doi Moi benefited from the general dynamism of the East Asia region. \nPrivate capital inflows into Viet Nam rose sharply in the early 1990s but declined during the mid-\n1990s, especially following the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Their recovery in recent years has \nbeen partial.  \n \nB.   Challenges Ahead \n \n6.  The nature and urgency of the challenges, which Viet Nam now faces, are illustrated by \nrecent developments. GDP growth was down to 5.8% in 2001, and is estimated at 5.7% for \n2002 and 6.2% for 2003. While these growth rates are among the highest worldwide, they fall \nwell short of what is needed to achieve the goal of doubling GDP between 2001 and 2010.1 The \nrecent slowdown in growth is all the more worrying as the weighted dollar price of agricultural \nexports fell by more than 20% in 2001, with rice, coffee, pepper, rubber, cashew-nuts, tea, and \ngroundnuts all contributing to this.2 The impact is all the stronger as the terms of trade have \nmoved strongly against Viet Nam. The price of Viet Nam\u2019s coffee exports has declined by more \nthan 60% in the past 3 years. This phenomenon does not only affect the balance of payments \nand fiscal receipts, it also directly bears on the incomes of rural households for which there are \nfew immediate alternatives, particularly in the uplands and highlands, where Viet Nam\u2019s ethnic \nminorities and many of its poorest people are concentrated. \n \n7.  The constraints on agricultural export growth, and the low wages on which many light \nindustry exports are predicated, point to the need to deepen and diversify Viet Nam's economic \ndevelopment. This is one of the objectives of the Government, which wants to move Viet Nam to \nat least middle-income status by 2025. To continue to achieve sustainable, robust rates of \neconomic  growth,  Viet  Nam,  like  other  countries  in  the  region  before  it,  must  enable  all \neconomic agents to contribute to development by engaging in the activities most in keeping with \nits comparative advantage. In particular, the further development of the multisector economy \nand the growth of enterprises outside of the public sector need to be encouraged. However, \ntheir success and their attractiveness to needed foreign investment remain critically dependent \non the Government establishing a more favorable legal and administrative environment.  \n \n8.   Viet Nam\u2019s leaders, after intensive debate over economic strategy and its implications, \nhave  decided  that  adaptation  and  continued  fast,  sustainable,  and  equitable  development \nrequire  focused  attention  on  the  following  strategic  priorities,  namely:  (i) increased \ncompetitiveness of the economy; (ii) a focus on human resources development; (iii) renovation \nof the public administration system; and (iv) further integration into the regional and global \neconomies as concretized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free Trade \nArea (AFTA), the bilateral trade agreement with the United States (already signed), and the \ndeclared goal of accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).  \n \n9.  The benefits of global integration, however, accrue to economies whose competitiveness \nis not undermined by the artificial burdens and high transaction costs of \u201cred tape\u201d and general \nmaladministration.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  public  administration,  concentrating  on  appropriate \nresponsibilities,  must  contribute  more  effectively  to  the  country\u2019s  transformation  into  an \n                                                 \n1  Government of Vietnam. 2001. Socioeconomic Development Strategy. To achieve the doubling of GDP, growth \nwould need to average just over 7.2% per annum. \n2  World Bank. 2002. Viet Nam Development Report 2002. Washington, DC.  \n ", "  3\nindustrialized,  modern,  and  prosperous  country.  Numerous  improvements  are  specifically \ndemanded by bilateral and regional trade agreements that Viet Nam has already signed, and \naccession to the WTO which is one of the country\u2019s explicitly stated goals. Those goals alone \nwould justify thoroughgoing reforms. New trade rules and even greater competition will force \nsome activities to cease, and others to adapt through higher productivity\u2014and that means lower \nemployment per unit of output. This process is both disruptive and beneficial, but the benefits \nare reaped sustainably if good governance and efficient administration facilitate adaptation \nthrough new investment and new or fast-growing activities. All these also require fostering \ninnovation  and  adaptability\u2014qualities  incompatible  with  the  excessive  bureaucraticism  that \ncharacterizes Viet Nam\u2019s public administration. The role of the Government in this is far from \nlimited to avoiding itself standing in the way of the private sector. Swifter adaptation needs a \ndiverse range of areas of active government intervention, from appropriate and enabling policy \nframeworks and effective regulatory mechanisms to provision of efficient infrastructure and the \neffective delivery of public services. This is the context in which the Government has renewed \nits determination to reform the public administration as a necessary condition for Viet Nam to \nattain its national development goals. \n \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR \n \nA.  The Public Administration System \n \n1.  Overview \n \n10.  With Doi Moi, Viet Nam\u2019s public administration has undergone some major changes, \nalbeit not as far-reaching as that of its economy. Reforms carried out since the late 1980s have \nsubstantially reduced the scope of government intervention in household and personal activities, \nin circumscribing social behavior, and in economic life. The intensity and extent of the changes \nare embedded in the role that the public sector has played over the past decade in the country\u2019s \nrecord of robust economic growth, social progress, and poverty reduction.  \n \n11.  Traditionally, the public sector occupied the bulk of Viet Nam\u2019s social space. With Doi \nMoi, its intervention in most aspects of society has fallen, even as it has built up its interventions \nin some needed areas, such as infrastructure development and poverty reduction. For instance, \nthere was little need for many of the traditional activities of a customs administration when the \nstate alone traded; immigration officers when there was little foreign travel; or even for traffic \nrules when there were few mechanized vehicles. In recent years, however, laws and regulations \nhave been changed, and efforts made to adapt policies and service delivery mechanisms with \nthe changing role of the state. Financial management has been tightened, halting the taxation of \nsociety  through  inflation  that  had  characterized  the  previous  decade,  and  preventing  its \nrecurrence. The Government now emphasizes the need for the public administration to reduce \nits traditional extensive and intrusive, hands-on interventions and to move to the formulation and \nimplementation of policies to indirectly influence private behavior. An overriding goal of the \nGovernment\u2019s PAR MP3 is to reorient the role of the state, \"from rowing to steering\u201d, as the PAR \nMP itself puts it, as Viet Nam progresses in its transition to a socialist-oriented market economy. \n \n12.  However, developing the good mechanisms and habits of \u201csteering\u201d is no less difficult \nthan abandoning the old habits of \u201crowing\u201d. Notwithstanding the efforts at reform to date, the \nreorientation and renovation of the systems and machinery of government remain at best only \n                                                 \n3  Approved by the Prime Minister in September 2001, covering the period 2001\u20132010. \n   ", "4  \npartial. The first wave of reforms that characterized Doi Moi later gave way to much slower \nchanges in administration and governance. Systems and procedures that were designed and \nevolved to function in a centrally planned economy, often during revolutionary and wartime \nstruggles, now have to deal with the demands of national economic growth and development, \npoverty reduction, and international economic integration. Moreover, they have to be responsive \nto the need to regulate and facilitate a growing private sector, and to the growing aspirations of \na population, a large proportion of which was born after 1975. These aspirations include greater \nparticipation, transparency, accountability, predictability, and the operation of the rule of law in \nall areas of public affairs. Also, the economic growth rate and development momentum have to \nbe sustained and improved if possible, and this requires a more favorable administrative and \noverall governance environment (see Appendix 1 for further details). \n \n2.   Issues and Challenges \n \n13.  The reforms in public administration that are needed in a country in transition are diverse \nand complex. The present structure of government, and the distribution of tasks, responsibilities, \nas well as staff and other resources between the central and lower levels of government \n(provinces,  districts,  and  communes)  are  inherited  from  periods  with  very  different \ncircumstances and needs. While some adaptation has taken place, much remains to be done. \nThis relates first to the roles and functions of the state and the government themselves in the \nnew socialist-oriented market economy. Clearer guidelines and policies need to be set as to \nwhat the state and the government must do at the central level; what they should delegate to \nlower territorial units; and what responsibilities and functions they should leave to other agents, \nincluding the private sector. However, such restructuring will require the formulation of new \nconcepts and approaches and will need to be implemented over time, and in a strategic and \nproperly sequenced way. Central to such restructuring are (i) the need to redefine the spheres \nof responsibilities for the state, the remainder of the public sector, and domestic and foreign \nprivate firms; and (ii) improved administrative capacities for policy making and implementation.  \n \n14.  To  date,  despite  significant  introduction  of  laws,  decrees,  ordinances,  and  other \nregulations,  and  to  some  extent  because  of  it,  major  gaps  as  well  as  contradictions  and \ninconsistencies remain in the legal framework, which make interpretation and enforcement \ndifficult.4 The law-making process suffers from technical limitations and inefficient procedures \nduring drafting, from weak scrutiny of draft laws by the National Assembly due to the lack both \nof sitting time and capacity, and from overlaps, gaps, and confusions in the authority of various \nagencies and territorial levels. A report delivered to the first sitting of the 11th National Assembly \nin July 2002, following the May 2002 national elections, drew attention to a broad range of \nconcerns  expressed  by  voters,  including  the  need  to  set  up  a  national  anti-corruption \ncommission to speed up the fight against graft and embezzlement; the need to thoroughly and \nquickly deal with complaints and criticisms against public officials from citizens; and the need for \nthe National Assembly to set up an auditing agency to make its work more efficient. Reforms \nthat are intended to ensure improved preparation and promulgation of laws and regulations \nmust be accompanied by improved judicial and court systems and law enforcement, with trained \nofficials,  effective  information  systems,  and  enough  well  functioning  legal  and  training \ninstitutions,  including  improved  legal  aid  for  the  poor.  Such  indispensable  complementary \nactions have not yet been clearly envisaged or planned.  \n \n                                                 \n4  For example, provisions relating to contracts in the Civil Code, the Commercial Law, and the Economic Contracts \nOrdinance are not always consistent. \n ", "  5\n15.  At present, the salary levels, and the overall quality, of the civil service are low. The \nformulation of better policies and their efficient implementation will require better qualified, more \nefficient, and better motivated civil servants. Additional and improved quality training needs to \nbe delivered. Much else is also needed, including modern human resources development and \nmanagement policies in addition to incentive systems such as increased salaries. It is also \nimportant to adapt the development and implementation of these policies to the newly emerging \nadministrative organizations, structures, and work processes, themselves evolving in adaptation \nto the new vision of the state\u2019s roles and responsibilities. There is also some feeling within \nGovernment that there are now too many civil servants and that their number is to be reduced. \nThis may be so in the short run, if new recruitment is to continue, particularly of younger and \noften better educated people, including more women. However, in the longer run, a mechanical \ndownsizing cannot be the only solution. The numbers and skills of civil servants and other public \nworkers  must  be  adapted  to  the  emerging  new  responsibilities,  functions,  structures,  and \norganization of the state and its territorial subdivisions. \u201cRightsizing\u201d rather than \u201cdownsizing\u201d is, \ntherefore, more appropriate in Viet Nam\u2019s context. \n \n16.  Viet Nam\u2019s administration was formed and had long functioned in an environment of \ncentral planning, much of the time combined with a war economy. In this environment, budget \nand  other  financial  controls  were  relatively  unimportant.  Even  before  the  resumption  of \nsignificant  international  aid  flows,  the  Government  decided  in  1991  to  stabilize  prices  by \ncompletely eschewing the inflationary financing of public deficits, and it has been exceptionally \ndetermined and successful in applying the macrofinancial controls involved in this decision.  \n \n17.  At lower levels, however, budgetary and other public financial rules are less clear and \ngenerally  inadequate.  They  pay  \u201cinadequate  attention  to  output/performance\u201d,  allow  public \nservice  units  to  \u201cconceal  or  understate  their  earnings\u201d5  and,  more  generally,  provide  for \ninadequate  accounting  of  cash  flows,  and  contain  no  independent  audit  mechanism.  The \nnumber of fiscal statistics unavailable for Viet Nam is indicative of a wider problem in this field.6 \nPartly as a result of this wide problem (and because of other inadequacies of the fiscal system), \ntax revenues have failed to keep pace with the increase in monetized national income. The \nreform of financial mechanisms is a huge task. Only its first steps have yet been outlined, \nnotably the provision of separate operating and financial rules for revenue-generating public \nservice units. However, discussions that the Government is now pursuing with international \nfinancial institutions are expected to lead to a major reform of budgetary and public finance \nprocedures and systems.7 \n \n18.  Corruption has been a matter of growing concern to Viet Nam\u2019s leaders. Fighting against \nit is one of the important implications, and challenges, of building a state governed by the rule of \nlaw. The Government has proposed a systemic approach to reducing corruption, by clarifying \nthe laws governing and repressing it (including recent decrees concerning the public disclosure \nof the assets of higher civil servants and their families), and by reducing the opportunities given \n                                                 \n5  See action program no. 6, Reform of the Financial Supervision Mechanism, under the PAR MP (2001\u20132010). \n6  See, for instance, the World Development Indicators of the World Bank. \n7  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, together with other international and bilateral technical \nassistance agencies, are already engaged in helping to improve fiscal and budgetary processes, notably within the \ngeneral framework of their reporting requirements, through the IMF\u2019s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility of \n2001, the World Bank\u2019s Poverty Reduction Support Credit of 2001, and a World Bank public financial management \nreform credit, now under preparation. These aim, in particular, at improving Viet Nam\u2019s fiscal and budgetary \ninformation to international levels, improving controls and checks, increasing internal and external transparency, \npromoting greater equity of public spending, improving Treasury management, and introducing performance \nbudgeting.    \n   ", "6  \nto it by ambiguous laws and regulations, complex administrative procedures, low civil service \nsalaries, and inadequate control mechanisms. The approach centers on legal reforms, reform of \nadministrative procedures, and reform of the structure and remuneration of the civil service, and \nstrengthening and clarifying complaints channels for citizens. \n \n19.  New designs are needed for the policies to be applied in most areas of the public \nadministrative  system,  for  work  processes  (in  particular,  improved  horizontal  cooperation \nbetween agencies), and for the adaptation of the structures and sizes of agencies. Many new \nwork  processes  need  to  be  applied  through  new  techniques,  including  reengineering, \ncomputerization, and e-government, that require costly investment and attention to systems and \nprocesses for efficiency as well as capacity building. These are difficult interrelated issues in \nany country. In Viet Nam, understandably, to date, plans for their resolution remain largely \nincomplete. These are, however, critical for the implementation of Viet Nam\u2019s Socioeconomic \nDevelopment  Strategy  (SEDS)  for  2001\u20132010,  which  itself  is  one  of  the  keys  to  the \nComprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGS),  approved  by  the \nGovernment in May 2002.  \n \n3.  Recent Reform Initiative \n \n20.  The Government and the Communist Party of Viet Nam (CPV) have given strong signals \nin recent years that they intend to reform the public administration system. There are at least \nthree main reasons for the strong support to PAR by the Government and CPV. First, the SEDS \nand CPRGS call for the doubling of GDP and reduction of national standard-base poverty \nincidence  by  three  fifths  over  the  period  2001\u20132010,  along  with  a  wide  range  of  other \ndevelopment outcomes. Yet, because of the recent deterioration in the world economy, among \nother challenges, Viet Nam is currently not on track to meet the growth target, with average and \nprojected growth for 2001\u20132003 averaging 5.9% per annum, rather than the 7.2% per annum \nneeded to meet the target. To have any hope of getting back on track, drastic measures are \nneeded, including the far-reaching reforms called for under the PAR MP. A second reason for \nthe  strong  support  for  PAR  is  that  Viet  Nam  has  commitments  under  the  bilateral  trade \nagreement with the United States, and would have new ones as part of WTO accession. A more \nefficient and effective ethical bureaucracy is essential to meet these commitments, and in turn to \npromote business investment and economic growth. The third, and perhaps a more important \nreason, is that Viet Nam's leaders are trying to maintain the high level of respect they have \nenjoyed  over  the  years  by  recasting  the  Government  as  being  more  responsive,  and  by \nreforming the administrative and legal system in ways that will encourage greater transparency. \nThey want people to feel there is a mechanism enabling them to bring complaints against \ncorrupt and incompetent local officials to the attention of higher authorities and that this will \ndiscourage rent-seeking activities. They also want to provide more effective services to citizens, \nin order to achieve CPRGS targets.8  \n \n                                                 \n8  Such as increasing the rate of children of primary education age going to primary schools to 97% (junior secondary \nschool to 80%) by 2005, and to 99% (junior secondary to 90%) by 2010; and reducing the maternal mortality rate \nto 80/100,000 by 2005 and to 70/100,000 in the whole country by 2010 (the rate for mountainous areas is \n100/100,000). The Government also recognizes the importance of gender issues. It recently approved a National \nStrategy and Plan of Action for the Advancement of Women in Viet Nam aimed at achieving women\u2019s equal rights \nin labor and employment, and education and health care; at enhancing the quality of efficiency of women\u2019s \nperformance in the political, economic, cultural and social fields, resulting in more women being recommended for, \nand elected to, leadership positions at all levels and in all sectors; and at strengthening institutional capacity to \npromote the advancement of women. In regard to the across-the-board 15% reduction of government employees, \npregnant women, women with children who are minors, sick people, and war invalids are protected against \nretrenchment. \n ", "  7\n21.  The PAR MP was formulated and approved following extensive deliberations at the \nhighest levels of the leadership, including the CPV. It envisages the reform of the entire public \nadministration system by 2010. It covers four focus areas and includes seven action programs, \nas shown in the following table:  \n \nTable 1: PAR - Focus Areas \n \nFocus Area  Action Program \n1.  Institutional Reforms  \u2022  Improvements to the development, issuance, and quality of legal \nnormative documents (action program no. 1) \n \n2.  Reform of the  \u2022  Improvements to the roles, functions, and organizational structures \nOrganizational  of agencies in the administrative system (action program no. 2) \nStructure of Public   \nAdministration  \u2022  Modernization of the administrative system including \ncomputerization and e-government (action program no. 7) \n \n3.  Improving the Quality  \u2022  Rightsizing of the civil service (action program no. 3) \nof Public Officials   \n\u2022  Training and retraining to improve the quality of public officials \n(action program no. 4) \n \n\u2022  Salary reforms (action program no. 5) \n \n4.  Public Finance  \u2022  Improvements to the financial management mechanisms for \nReforms  administrative and public service delivery agencies (action program \nno. 6) \n \n \n22.  The agenda for reform and renovation under the PAR MP is far-reaching and bold in \nvision. It includes replacing cumbersome administrative procedures with more simplified and \ntransparent  ones;  reducing  red  tape  and  corruption;  streamlining  and  better  defining  the \nmandates  and  functions  of  institutions;  reforming  provincial  and  other  subnational \nadministrations and redefining their relations with the center; rationalizing the organizational \nstructure of ministries; improving the quality of public officials; undertaking salary reform for \npublic  employees;  reforming  public  financial  management;  and  modernizing  the  public \nadministration system, including computerization and e-government initiatives.  \n \n23.   The Government has requested ADB assistance to support its PAR MP implementation \nwith a focus on two of the seven PAR action programs, i.e., training and retraining to improve \nthe  quality  of  public  officials  (AP  no. 4)  and  modernization  of  the  administrative  system, \nincluding computerization and e-government initiatives (AP no. 7). \n \nB.    Issues in Training and Retraining Reform \n \n24.   The Government wants a civil service that is focused more on achieving results through \nprofessionalism in performance and service delivery; that has sound policy skills; and that is \nconcerned with its responsiveness, with accountability, and with the observance of the rule of \nlaw.  For  this,  the  civil  service  has  to  overcome  many  deficiencies  in  its  quality,  including \ndiscipline, qualifications, professional capacity, administrative skills, dedication, and ethics. The \ncurrent public officials have many strengths, including increased numbers holding professional \nqualifications and degrees or with English language skills. However, as acknowledged in the \n   ", "8  \nPAR MP, many public officials lack the professional knowledge and skills needed in the new \nmanagement environment. To upgrade their skills, the Government sees both that training and \nretraining are an urgent priority, and that the existing training system requires renovation and \nreorientation to improve focus and quality.9 \n \n25.  Therefore, in considering support for the implementation of extended and improved \ntraining and retraining, a number of issues need to be addressed. There are already extensive \narrangements for delivery of training at central and local levels across Viet Nam, with over 120 \ntraining institutions at both levels. However, there is a general recognition that training policy \nmust be modernized as much existing training is both poorly designed and focused, as well as \nbeing  ineffectively  delivered,  with  a  need  to  renovate  contents,  methods,  modalities, \norganization, and delivery.  \n \n26.  Training and retraining need to more sharply focus on imparting the competencies or \nskills now required, based on concrete needs and functional analysis of the work actually being \nundertaken. As with modern training approaches in other countries, the approach therefore \nneeds to shift from intake of knowledge and theory to one more of enhancing skills and to being \nconcerned about the more holistic concept of \u201clearning\u201d, with training being just one of the ways \nin  which  public  officials  learn.  The  legal  framework  for  training  as  well  as  the  actual \nmanagement  of  training  delivery  through  training  institutions  also  needs  to  be  significantly \nimproved. New styles of more interactive and practical learning are required. There also need to \nbe significant revisions to the curricula and materials; the adoption of new learning methods and \nmaterials; increased use of modular and information and communications technology (ICT)-\nbased approaches to learning; greater concern for monitoring and evaluating the impact of \ntraining; upgrading training facilities and equipment; and enhancing trainers\u2019 skills. These need \nto be pursued as a matter of high priority. Over time, this should lead to the development and \ndelivery of a suite of training and management development programs that are better designed \nto meet Viet Nam\u2019s development needs.  \n \nC.  Issues  in  Administrative  Modernization  including  Computerization  and  E-\nGovernment Initiatives \n \n27.  Administrative modernization of the civil service utilizing ICT was initiated in Viet Nam at \nthe end of 1993 when the National Information Technology Program10 was established. This \ndrove most of the ICT development efforts from 1995 to 1999, including ICT training and raising \nawareness of ICT applications in government administration. The most significant achievements \nin ICT during that period were the initial establishment of government information networks (i.e., \nthe Government Information Network, CPNET); the building of six pilot national databases;11 \nand  the  standardization  of  software  applications  across  agencies  and  local  governments \n(socioeconomic statistics, personnel management, general accounting, etc.). During this period, \nmany provinces began utilizing simple ICT applications for administrative purposes, and several \nstate-owned enterprises also built their own business systems, with some success, serving their \ninternal business needs.12 Meanwhile, access to ICT by remote and poor areas was also being \nincreased. To embrace the rural areas, regulatory frameworks were being structured to offer \n                                                 \n9  See Prime Minister\u2019s Decision 874/TTg of 20 November 1996 and Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No.74/2001/QD of 7 \nMay 2001. \n10 Through resolution 49/CP, 1993. \n11 These include socioeconomic, finance-budget, land resources, civil servants, population, and legal databases. \n12 Such  as  Viet  Nam  Airlines,  State  Bank  of  Viet Nam,  Vietcombank,  Petrolimex,  and  Viet  Nam  Posts  and \nTelecommunication.   \n ", "  9\nincentives to service providers, to generate new opportunities to reduce isolation, to improve \naccess to knowledge, and to participate in trade. \n \n28.  While this first wave of ICT development saw progress in raising awareness of ICT \napplication in public administration, a number of problems remain unresolved. First, CPNET, \ndue to inadequate funding, remains at an initial phase of development, unable to resolve the \ncrucial issue of integrating all ministries, agencies, and local government networks. This hinders \nthe  data  interchange  processes  between  government  agencies.  Second,  expensive \ntelecommunications costs and the lack of legislation on privacy, digital signature, certification, \nand authentication have hindered the growth of ICT applications in Viet Nam, especially e-\nbusiness and e-commerce. Third, limited government funding for ICT has resulted in input-\ndriven spending, with resources being spread thinly, resulting in incomplete projects. Fourth, the \nlack of adequate international standards of professionalism in ICT management is affecting the \nquality of strategic planning, system support, and operations. The majority of ICT managers \nhave not been properly trained to perform their duties. Fifth, the lack of policies and a legal \nframework on active recruitment and attracting high quality ICT personnel to the government \nworkforce are among the reasons for the shortage of skilled ICT civil servants. Sixth, quality \ncontrol and assurance has not been used widely in ICT projects. Seventh, interoperability is also \na real issue when back-office systems from various departments want to communicate with \neach other. Owing to the lack of a legal framework on information exchange, participating \nagencies are reluctant to share information, and in any event the disparate technical systems do \nnot  facilitate  easy  interconnectivity.  Finally,  there  is  also  a  lack  of  an  appropriate  legal \nframework  to  permit  effective  development  of  e-government  and  public  service  delivery \nsystems, and to protect the interests of both service providers and end-users. \n \n29.  The recent open endorsement of ICT development by the CPV and the Government13 \nhas  introduced  a  refreshing  wave  of  thinking  in  all  ministries,  agencies,  and  provincial \ngovernments on the application of ICT in public administration. And, under the PAR MP, the \nGovernment aims to develop an advanced and modern public administration system through \nincreased  use  of  ICT  together  with  improvements  in  management  modalities,  policy \ncoordination, and better work methods.  \n \nD.   Alternative Approaches and External Support: Lessons Learned \n \n30.   To address the challenges that are involved in such a complex and far-reaching reform \nagenda, various alternative approaches could be considered. One more \u201ctop-down\u201d approach is \nto  concentrate  on  core  government  institutions  and  focus  on  new  policies,  procedures, \nregulations, and systems\u2014all of these designed and promulgated by key central agencies and \nwith leadership from the highest level. This is the main thrust of the approach in the PAR MP. \nAn alternative, more \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach is where innovation comes from hundreds of pilot \ninitiatives from different sector agencies and different administrative levels (provinces, districts, \nmunicipalities,  etc.).  That  is  the  reform  approach  that  Viet  Nam  had  largely  used  prior  to \nadopting the PAR MP.  \n \n31.  Although ADB continues to support many reform initiatives in sector agencies, and in \nselected subnational jurisdictions, it has been difficult to upscale these reforms because of \nblockages at the core institutional level due to outdated regulations, low salaries, nonmerit-\n                                                 \n13 Through the Politburo Directive No. 58-CT/TW on enhancing information technology application in the course of \nindustrialization, modernization, and national development; and the Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 112/2001 on the \napproval of the project of State Administrative Management Computerization (SAMCom). \n   ", "10  \nbased recruitment and promotion, and low skill levels. It also considers that the PAR MP is the \nmost  effective  path  for  addressing  these systemic  issues  by  encouraging,  supporting,  and \nfacilitating a combination of both the \u201ctop-down\u201d and the \u201cbottom-up\u201d approaches while drawing \non lessons learned. \n \n32.  Lessons learned come from postevaluation reports and project completion reports on \npublic sector reform programs, as well as from first-hand experience of processing public sector \nreform loan and technical assistance projects in other developing member countries (DMCs). \nWhile each country\u2019s path to efficient public administration and good governance is different, \ndepending on culture, geography, political and administrative traditions, economic conditions, \nand many other factors,14 the main lessons relevant to the proposed program are: (i) a solid \npolitical commitment from the highest level; (ii) strong ownership and home-grown strategies \nbased  on  wide  consultation  and  participation;  (iii) actionable  set  of  objectives  with  clearly \ndefined responsibility and accountability of government ministries or agencies embodied in the \nprogram; (iv) proper sequencing of the reform measures in relation to their importance as well \nas achievability with due regard to the capacity of the Government; (v) public awareness and \ncontinued support and feedback from civil society to ensure sustainability of the program; and \n(vi) an outcome-based and flexible approach in both program design and implementation. \n \n33.    The effective implementation of the PAR MP requires substantial resources, including \nmany  support  measures  and  further  detailed  planning,  designing,  and  the  appropriate \nsequencing of policy and institutional actions. It is an unavoidable paradox of PAR that this \nexceedingly complex and difficult set of measures has to be better defined, planned, phased, \nand implemented by the very administration whose inadequacies it is intended to correct. In this \ncontext, external assistance from the development partners of Viet Nam, including ADB, can \nplay a strategic role in helping catalyze the critical actions necessary, to give further impetus to \nPAR  implementation  and  to  help  the  Government  strengthen  and  improve  its  overall \nmanagement of the PAR process. Such assistance can also help accelerate progress in human \nresources development and administrative modernization, notably by drawing on international \npractices and experience. (See Appendix 1, Annex 2 for an outline of the approach adopted to \nformulate the proposed program.)  \n \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \nA.   Objectives and Scope \n \n34.   The Government aims to build a professional, modern, effective, and efficient public \nadministration system for Viet Nam through its PAR MP. The overall objective of the program \nloan proposal (the program) is to support and facilitate the implementation of the Government's \nPAR MP and to assist in building a professional, modern, effective and efficient administration \nsystem for the Borrower. The program will finance implementation of two of the seven PAR \naction programs: (i) training and retraining to improve the quality of public officials under AP \nno. 4; and (ii) modernization of the administrative system, including computerization and e-\ngovernment initiatives under AP no. 7. The program will facilitate these overall aims through \nnecessary policy and institutional measures and actions, and the operational arrangements \nnecessary to ensure effective implementation of APs no. 4 and no. 7 within the framework of the \nPAR MP. The program adopts a cluster approach, divided into three phases, of which Phase I \ncovers the period 2003\u20132005, Phase II 2006\u20132008, and Phase III 2008\u20132010 (paras. 76\u201378). \n                                                 \n14 ADB. \u201cGovernance in Asia \u2013 from Crisis to Opportunity\u201d, Annual Report 1998.  \n ", "  11\n \nB.  Program Strategic Framework and Policy Matrix  \n \n35.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  public  administration  system  is  complex.  In  extending  support  for  the \nimplementation of policy and institutional measures under APs no. 4 and no. 7, it is necessary to \nadopt a strategic overview of the entire reform agenda covering all four of the focus areas to \nensure that critical linkages to PAR are ensured and that impetus is given, thereby, to overall \nPAR MP implementation. This is not only an obvious prerequisite for the success of the overall \nPAR MP but also equally crucial for the successful implementation of the two APs no. 4 and \nno. 7 targeted by the program. These include the need for the requisite legal and regulatory \nsupport mechanisms to be put in place; specific organizational functions and structures to be \nreviewed and adjusted; and organizational and institutional reforms, including the renovation of \nwork  processes  and  procedures,  as  well  as  modernization  of  equipment  including \ncomputerization, to be integrated with human resources development and financial plans. These \naspects are given particular attention in the policy matrix of the Phase I program (Appendix 2), \nin the development policy letter (Appendix 3), and are regarded as fundamental to ensure the \nsuccess and longer-term sustainability of the PAR MP and represent a substantial component of \nthe program focus during 2003\u20132005. \n \n36.  The four focus areas under the PAR MP were carefully identified by the Government, \nwith the assistance of external technical advice, through a process of intensive diagnostic work \nover a number of years that led to the Government\u2019s formal approval of the PAR  MP in \nSeptember 2001. Given the socioeconomic background of Viet Nam and the nation's identified \ndevelopment targets, the four focus areas for PAR are both appropriate and highly relevant. \nHowever, such a long-term program has to be flexible and adaptable. The opinions of citizens \nand enterprises will be one of the factors influencing future adaptations and change. To facilitate \nthe collection of citizens\u2019 perception and to benefit from it, the PAR MP specifically refers to \nfuture recourse to \u201cpublic opinion surveys for making important decisions and policies\u201d, and to \nthe need for senior officials to \u201cperiodically and directly meet and dialogue with people and \nbusinesses\u201d.  The  action  programs  under  the  PAR  MP  also  identify  a  number  of  related \nmeasures and actions toward this end, including appropriate feedback mechanisms from the \ngrassroots levels, a monitoring and evaluation system, PAR awareness programs, and citizen \nfeedback systems. \n \n37.   The policy matrix focuses on the relevant measures and actions needed to ensure the \nsuccessful implementation of the PAR MP, with particular focus on AP no. 4 (training and \nretraining)  and  AP  no. 7  (administrative  modernization,  including  computerization  and  e-\ngovernment). The policy matrix for Phase I of the program is therefore presented in three parts. \nPart  A  embraces  critical  PAR  development  objectives,  measures,  and  actions  to  lay  the \nfoundation for the program, to ensure strategic interlinkages and synergy, and to provide an \nenabling policy and institutional environment for the successful implementation of the PAR MP \nand, more specifically, APs no. 4 and no. 7. Part B focuses on the development objectives, and \nkey measures and actions for the implementation of training and retraining to improve the \nquality of public officials under AP no. 4; and Part C focuses on the development objectives and \nkey measures and actions for the implementation of administrative modernization, including \ncomputerization and e-government initiatives under AP no. 7. \n \n38.

Part A: Overall Public Administration Reform Master Program Framework \nMeasures and Actions  \n \n39.   Part A of the policy matrix contains eight key development objectives related to the PAR \nMP implementation to ensure strategic linkages and to provide critical underpinning for the \nimplementation of its action programs. These development objectives focus on: (i) improved \nleadership, planning, management and decision making for PAR, with a focus on AP no. 4 and \nAP no. 7; (ii) improved PAR management information system and monitoring and evaluation \nsystem and public awareness program for PAR;  (iii) strengthened rule of law-based public \nadministration system; (iv) strengthened and streamlined legal and administrative mechanism \nand procedures to support PAR implementation; (v) enhanced public service delivery in the \nadministrative system; (vi) strengthened policy framework for managing and developing civil \nservants;  (vii) effective  organizational  structures  and  functions  of  state  apparatus;  and \n(viii) improved  organizational  performance  through  an  integrated  system  of  performance \nmeasurement.  These  objectives  are  fundamental  and  represent  the  foundation  for  the \nsuccessful implementation of the PAR MP as a whole and APs no. 4 and no. 7, specifically. \nUnder these objectives, a number of measures and actions would need to be carried out. These \ninclude a review of the effectiveness of current implementation arrangements and strengthening \nof coordination and management arrangements, including the provision of adequate resources, \nand a multiyear integrated and sequenced action plan for PAR implementation to be developed \nduring the early part of program implementation. Other measures are: legal and institutional \nreform;  upgrading  the  management  information  system  and  establishing  a  monitoring  and \nevaluation system; streamlining administrative mechanisms and procedures to support PAR \nimplementation;  improvements  to  service  delivery;  development  of  human  resource \nmanagement (HRM) and development (HRD) policy for civil service reform; introduction of \neffective organizational structures; introduction of a new system of organizational performance \nmeasurement; and a public awareness campaign. \n \n40.   A number of the identified measures and actions have already been accomplished by \nthe Government. As at the end of September 2002, the accomplished actions include: approval \nby the Prime Minister of the PAR MP; preparation of draft action programs; review of functions \nand effectiveness of PAR management and implementation mechanisms; submission of legal \nneeds assessment report; improvement in public service delivery through several successful \n\u201cpilot\u201d schemes (e.g., one-stop shop schemes); resolution on rightsizing; and the setting up of a \nsteering committee on salary reform. These are very encouraging reform actions that augur well \nfor the successful implementation of the PAR MP. \n \n2.   Part B: Training and Retraining for Improving the Quality of Public Officials \nUnder AP No. 4 \n \n41.  Part  B  of  the  policy  matrix  contains  key  development  objectives  and  the  priority \nmeasures and actions necessary to improve the quality of public officials through training and \nretraining. The overall objective of the program in this area of PAR is \u201cto improve the quality, \ncompetency  and  professionalism  of  public  officials  at  the  central  and  local  levels\u201d.  The \ndevelopment  objectives  under  this  part  of  the  program  are  aimed  at:  (i) establishing  the \nstrategic,  legal,  and  management  framework;  (ii) renovating  training  planning,  design,  and \ncontents; (iii) renovating training delivery methodology and techniques; (iv) enhancing capacity \nof  targeted  groups  of  public  officials  at  central  and  local  levels  through  different  training \nmodalities;  (v) developing  and  enhancing  the  capacity  and  quality  of  public  administration \ntrainers;  (vi) upgrading  training  infrastructure,  facilities,  and  equipment;  and  (vii) improving \n   ", "14  \nperformance and results of training programs through systematic performance monitoring and \nevaluation. \n \n42.   The new approach to training in the civil service will be based on a vision of the civil \nservice as set out in a HRD strategic framework as well as in a more detailed implementation \nplan. It will be supported by new and revised policies on training in the civil service; through the \nrevision of laws and regulations on the civil service and personnel management, developed as \npart of the overall AP no. 4; and through new management and institutional arrangements for \ntraining delivery. The Ho Chi Minh Political Academy (HCMPA) and National Academy of Public \nAdministration (NAPA) are two key institutions involved in training; and NAPA is also co-lead \nagency (with MOHA) for AP no. 4. The capacity of these institutions will be tested to implement \nthe  planned  reforms  within  the  3-year  time  frame.  Means  and  ways  to  strengthen  their \nmanagement efficiency, and to mobilize extra resource capacity, will be explored and applied as \nrequired,  through  utilization  of  resources  from  provincial/ministerial  schools,  technical \nassistance, and other mechanisms. \n \n43.   Renovation of training, planning, and contents will involve undertaking a number of \nmajor  sequenced  tasks,  including  piloting,  at  each  stage  of  the  reform  process,  before \nimplementation proceeds. The first stage involves the development of skills profiles of the \ncompetencies required by target groups as the basis for ensuring that training can be designed \nand targeted in such a manner as to improve the quality of public officials and better meet the \nneeds of the renovated public administration system. The profiles will outline the required \ncompetencies, qualifications, knowledge, experience, skills, and personal character required for \ndifferent positions, levels, and sectors. The profiles will be based on the vision for the civil \nservice under the PAR MP and functional analysis of the roles, functions, and tasks of various \ntypes of administrators at different levels, and the resulting job descriptions. This work will then \nlead on to careful assessment, through sampling, of actual training needs for priority categories \nof public officials and then development of a framework outlining the particular training programs \nthat will be required. Once the training programs have been determined based on the training \nneeds  assessments  (TNAs),  revision  of  training  content  and  curricula  will  be  undertaken, \nfollowed by piloting and broader replication.  \n \n44.   The training reforms are also intended to cover a review of current training methodology \nand  techniques  (as  traditional  methods  such  as  lecturing  are  still  common).  A  number  of \ninitiatives to test innovative, action-oriented and interactive adult-learning techniques will be \nconducted and new methods developed and piloted, including for the use of ICT-based self-\nlearning. These experiences will be reviewed in order to make recommendations on the most \neffective mix of techniques for different types of training situations.  \n \n45.   Particular efforts will be made to focus on building the capacity of the high-priority \ncategory of public officials by fast-tracking the development of new training programs and the \nuse of new training modalities. About 15,000 administrative civil servants in general, and about \n10,000 grassroots officials, will be trained in at least one of the short-term courses developed \nbased on priority needs as identified through TNAs. Many different short-term courses and \nmodules will be delivered, based on the needs of different groups of civil servants at central and \nlocal  level.  Longer-term  training  courses  for  about  500  officials  under  the  priority  groups, \nincluding public officials with potential for promotion, leaders, and managers, as well as selected \ntrainers, will also be developed and conducted by late 2004. Training will be conducted in \nupgraded facilities, and training divisions and schools will be actively consulted on priorities and \n ", "  15\nencouraged to host training modules based on the revised training approaches, contexts, and \ncontents.  \n \n46.   Currently, overseas training is managed in a piecemeal way, mainly through external \nsponsorship  under  bilateral  and  multilateral  programs  and  direct  cooperation  between \ninstitutions. Recognizing the higher priority that Viet Nam wants to give to overseas training, the \nprogram contains a measure to develop a new plan. This will enable priorities to be set; \nselection criteria and procedures to be put in place; cooperative relationships to be built with \noverseas tertiary institutions; and arrangements to be put in place for utilization of staff on their \ncompletion of study. About 200 officials for short-term courses and about 100 for long-term \ncourses are expected to benefit from the overseas training program. \n \n47.   The trainers in public administration play a critical role in improving the quality of training, \nsuccessfully introducing new curricula and teaching methods, and sustaining them. There are \nabout 3,000 trainers, both full and part time, involved with administrative training. Core teachers, \nparticularly at central institutions, including master trainers, tend to be academics, and not \nexperienced administrators, and are mostly using traditional teaching methods. A significant \nnumber are not skilled enough to be effective teachers. The program recognizes that the shift to \na more skills- and work-oriented training program utilizing modern interactive adult teaching \nmethods will require teachers to have different skills profiles and training opportunities available \nto  them  that  include  general  upgrading  courses  in  modern  public  administration  and \nmanagement, perhaps coupled with internships in leading PAR administrations, as well as skills \ntraining in new teaching methods.15  \n \n48.  There is also the need to significantly upgrade the training infrastructure, facilities, and \nequipment in the central training institutions, NAPA and HCMPA, as well as in the 61 provincial \nschools. To create a suitable environment for effective training, an upgrading program will be \nconducted,  involving  the  design  of  standards  for  training  facilities  and  equipment;  the \ndevelopment of a detailed investment plan for facility and equipment upgrading; and an assets \nmaintenance and replacement plan for training institutions. \n \n49.   The ultimate purpose of training is to improve individual and team work performance of \npublic officials and by extension the performance of their respective organizations. However, \ncurrent reporting and feedback on training is more focused on training output, i.e., number of \npeople trained and the qualifications achieved. There is no systematic feedback on the impact \nof training and follow-up requirements (i.e., if and how the new knowledge and skills are used in \nthe workplace, and whether they contribute effectively to better performance on an individual \nand organizational level). To address this, a performance monitoring, reporting, and evaluation \nsystem for all training programs will be established under the program and an impact evaluation \non the training reforms will be carried out in mid-2005. \n \n3.   Part  C:  Administrative  Modernization,  including  Computerization  and  E-\nGovernment Initiatives under AP No. 7 \n \n50.   Part C of the policy matrix contains key development objectives and priority measures \nand  actions  for  administrative  modernization,  including  computerization  and  e-government \ninitiatives. The overall objective of the program in this area of PAR is to achieve an advanced \n                                                 \n15 For example, to achieve a significant impact on training quality, at least about 500 teachers at local level would \nneed retraining. The most effective and rapid way would probably be through a master training of trainers cascade \nscheme. \n   ", "16  \nand modern public administration through improvements in management modalities, quality of \npolicy  coordination,  better  work  methods,  and  the  use  of  ICT  and  a  government-wide \ncomputerized  network  in  the  operation,  leadership,  and  management  of  the  public \nadministration system at the central and local levels.  \n \n51.   The Government\u2019s decision to modernize the state apparatus and its functions and \nprocesses involves not only the computerization of government agencies but also, equally \nimportantly,  a  complementary  review  of  functions,  roles,  and  work  processes  in  these \norganizations to improve their overall effectiveness and efficiency. The Government recognizes \nthat computerization on its own will not suffice. Equally important are the measures and actions \nto review and streamline work procedures and processes so that the application of computers \nand  related  peripherals  can  bring  about  more  focused  and  effective  results  in  terms  of \norganizational and personnel performance. To achieve these objectives, the Government made \na  landmark  policy  decision  in  September  2001  for  State  Administrative  Management \nComputerization (SAMCom) under the Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 112/2001. \n \n52.  There are many critical issues related to the success of implementing administrative \ncomputerization  under  SAMCom,  which  the  Government  wishes  to  address  through  the \nprogram. For instance, effective computerization and e-government implementation must be \npreceded by appropriate reviews and modernization of government functional structures, work \nmethods, and work processes. Capacity to manage the development and implementation of \ncomputerization  and  e-government  projects  needs  to  be  strengthened  and  the  capacity  to \nprovide strategic planning, operation, and support of computer systems enhanced to provide \nbetter service and to protect ICT investments. Moreover, adequate and sustainable financial \nresources are needed, as are effective procedures for ICT procurement. Another issue is that \nextensive  and  effective  training  of  public  officials  in  basic  computer  usage  is  necessary, \nincluding  the  adequate  supply  of  staff  to  handle  systems  in  development  methodologies, \nstandards and procedures, and ICT support staff for planning, operation, and support. These \nare critical for the success of SAMCom projects. Finally, an appropriate legal framework is \nurgently  needed  to  permit  the  effective  development  and  deployment  of  e-government \ninitiatives. \n \n53.   In  this  context,  to  support  implementation  of AP  no. 7,  Part  C  of  the  policy  matrix \ncontains the following development objectives: (i) enhancing productivity and work efficiency of \nthe administrative system at all levels; (ii) establishing appropriate legal frameworks to support \nthe computerization of state administrative management and e-government; (iii) strengthening \ncapacity in ICT management, planning, and support; (iv) strengthening capacity in ICT systems \ndevelopment  and  implementation;  (v) progressively  building-up  computerization  of  state \nmanagement and e-government, with benefits and services to the citizen, business, public \nemployees, and other government agencies; and (vi) establishing an integrated computerized \nnetwork from the central level to commune level administration. These are to be implemented \nwithin the framework of the Prime Minister\u2019s Decision 112 on computerization, under OOG\u2019s \nmanagement within the PAR implementation framework. \n \n54.  Consistent  with  the  first  objective  concerned  with  enhancing  productivity  and  work \nefficiency of the administrative system, the Prime Minister\u2019s Decision 112 sets out detailed \narrangements  for  computerization  of  the  public  administration  system.  A  detailed \nimplementation plan for PAR AP no. 7 has also been developed, including a master plan for \nSAMCom. In addition, the working rules and management methods of government at all levels \nare to be revised under the program.  \n \n ", "  17\n55.  To establish an appropriate legal framework to support the SAMCom and e-government \ninitiatives, the relevant measures include: issue of a range of policies and regulations on, inter \nalia, information interchange between ministries and agencies; the use of the Internet; attracting \nand retaining qualified personnel; the use of electronic certification; the application of modern \nwork  methods;  data  security  and  integrity;  protection  of  intellectual  property  rights; \ncomputerization of public service delivery; and the issue of enabling laws covering matters such \nas  cyber  contracts  and  privacy  protection.  In  addition,  relevant  procurement  policies  and \nregulations are to be issued for use under SAMCom.  \n \n56.  To strengthen capacity in ICT management, planning, and support, and following the \nissuance  of  necessary  policies  and  regulations,  executive  information  (EI) units  are  to  be \nestablished  in  each  ministry  or  agency  and  at  the  provincial  level.  Each  EI  unit  will  be \nresponsible  for  ICT  planning  and  management,  including  compliance  with  standards, \nprocedures,  and  practice  manuals,  that  are  to  be  issued  for  systems  planning,  support, \noperations, and maintenance. Senior managers are to be trained in strategic ICT management; \nadministrative civil servants in basic computer usage; and EI unit staff in systems planning, \nsupport, operation, and maintenance. The measures in Part C of the policy matrix specify target \nlevels for the numbers of staff who are to be trained by September 2004, with 100% to be \ntrained in all categories by December 2005.  \n \n57.   Capacity is also to be strengthened under the program in ICT systems development and \nimplementation.  The  program  provides  for  the  establishment  of  implementation  units  with \nresources allocated to planned activities. A TNA will be conducted and a training plan on \nsystems  development,  project  management,  and  related  matters  established  for  systems \ndevelopment staff, for EI officers and their staff, for senior managers, and for end-users, with \nspecified targets to be met for training all development staff by December 2005. Standards, \nprocedures, and practice manuals are also to be established for systems development, project \nmanagement, and quality management, and the training of trainers. Technical system platforms \nand training standards will also be established for SAMCom projects.  \n \n58.   In  addition,  to  ensure  proper  sequencing  of  PAR  activities,  all  computerization/e-\ngovernment projects will be identified where organizational restructuring and administrative \nprocesses are to be redesigned before the project proceeds. Policies and guidelines will then be \nestablished for redesign of the structures and processes as part of a multistage reform process. \n \n59.   As  part  of  the  progressive  buildup  of  computerization  of  state  administrative \nmanagement  and  e-government  with  benefits  and  services  to  citizens,  businesses,  public \nemployees, and other government agencies, a priority list of shared software applications and \ndatabases is to be developed and the applications and databases implemented. Appropriate \nchange management techniques will be applied to each SAMCom project. \n \n60.   The  program  also  includes  major  steps  toward  introducing  e-government  including: \n(i) establishing a government information portal for the purpose of disseminating information and \nlegal documents related to the Government, by September 2004; (ii) completing implementation \nof the application of established standards and procedures to at least five e-government pilot \nprojects  delivering  better  public  services,  by  September  2004;  and  (iii) establishing  a \ngovernment data center to integrate data across government and to provide decision support \nfacilities, by December 2005. \n \n61.   It is also envisaged that under the program a computerized network from the central \ngovernment  down  to  commune  administration  level  will  be  integrated,  first  by  establishing \n   ", "18  \nsystem  specifications  and  implementation  plans,  and  then  enhancing  CPNET  and  local \nnetworks. By the end of the program i.e., by December 2005, with completion of the measures \nand actions specified in Part C of the policy matrix, Viet Nam should be well placed to proceed \nwith more extensive introduction of e-government initiatives as part of a modernized public \nadministration system.  \n \nC.  Important Features \n \n62.  The program cluster, through the three phases of support during the period 2003\u20132010, \nis expected to help enhance the overall organizational and operational efficiencies of Viet Nam\u2019s \npublic administration system, thereby ensuring more effective and efficient delivery of public \nservices  at  the  central  and  local  levels.  An  effective  PAR  process  will  involve  a  further \nrationalization of the role of the state, as Viet Nam makes greater progress in its transition from \na  centrally  planned  to  a  socialist-oriented  market  economy,  moving  public  resources  from \nproduction to health, education, and infrastructure; improving the enabling policy and regulatory \nenvironment  for  developing  an  employment-generating  private  sector;  improving  the \naccountability and transparency of government; and providing better access to public services \nand social safeguards for the vulnerable and the poor.  \n    \n63.  The program cluster including the program is classified as Category C under ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental  classification  system.  Its  environmental  impact  is  expected  to  be  minimal. \nProgram activities will not involve any land acquisition or changes in land use that may entail \ninvoluntary  resettlement  effects  and  trigger  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.  The \nbroader PAR\u2019s institutional and territorial reorganization provisions may well have broad social \nimplications. The measures contained in the program for monitoring and evaluation and the \nfollow-up arrangements are intended to address these. \n \nD.  Financing Plan, Terms, and Source of Funds \n \n64.  The Government\u2018s PAR MP covers 10 years to 2010, divided into two phases, from \n2001\u20132005 and from 2006\u20132010. As PAR is a complex and long-term undertaking, ADB aims to \nextend support to the Government during the entire period of the PAR MP, i.e., up to 2010. ADB \nanticipates extending loan financing and TA through a program cluster approach, provided in \nthree  phases.  The  first  phase  of  loan  financing,  covering  the  period  2003\u20132005  (Phase  I \nprogram), will constitute this program loan in an amount of $45 million equivalent from the Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF), and is expected to be disbursed by the end of 2005 when the first \nphase of the Government\u2019s PAR MP is to be completed. That year is also when a number of \nimportant reform actions are expected to have reached critical stages. If the Government, at that \nstage, were to request it, ADB would be prepared, in principle, to extend additional assistance \nduring the period 2006\u20132010 through two separate phases of assistance: the Phase II program \n(covering 2006\u20132008) and the Phase III program (covering 2008\u20132010) overlapping with Phase \nII, with loans, respectively, of $50 million and $55 million equivalent, from ADF. Possible ADB \nassistance during 2006\u20132010, which constitutes the second phase of the Government\u2019s PAR \nMP, is to be divided into two phases under the ADB program cluster. For each of the phases, \nincluding the first covering the period 2003\u20132005, ADB will actively seek cofinancing from other \nexternal development partners.  \n \n65.  Total financing from ADB for the program during the period 2003\u20132010 could, therefore, \nbe in the range of $45 million to $150 million, subject to Government and ADB jointly deciding to \nproceed with the second and third phases of the program cluster. In addition to ADF financing, \nsubject to the Government\u2019s requirements and its specific request, ADB would be willing to \n ", "  19\nconsider providing London interbank offered rate-based ordinary capital resources financing, \ni.e., in addition to ADF financing. \n \n66.   Any  additional  phase  of  the  program  cluster  would  be  processed  sequentially  on \ncompletion of the previous one. The Phase I program, with the financing released in two \ntranches, will cover the period 2003\u20132005. Should there be a Phase II program, this would be \npresented for Board consideration and approval before the end of 2005, depending on progress \nachieved in implementing Phase I, including the status of compliance to the proposed policy and \ninstitutional reform measures and actions, and the readiness of the Government to continue to \nundertake the necessary policy and institutional reform measures. The first tranche under the \nPhase II program could be released by the end of first quarter of 2006. \n \n67.   The policy and institutional reforms that have already been initiated under the PAR MP \nshould  naturally  progress  during  the  present  Phase  I  program.  ADB  will  reflect  the \nGovernment\u2019s achievements and assist the Government to refine the policy reform actions \nunder the Phase II program accordingly, taking into consideration the policy and institutional \nenvironment for implementing the Phase II program. The Phase III program could be processed \nin a similar manner and would cover the period 2008\u20132010, with the first tranche expected to be \nreleased by the end of first quarter of 2009. \n \n68.  For the Phase I program, i.e., this proposal, the ADF loan will have a repayment period \nof 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and will carry annual interest rates of 1.0% \nduring the grace period and 1.5% during the amortization period. The proceeds may be used to \nfinance eligible imports incurred within 180 days prior to the date of loan effectiveness. \n \n69.  The cost of implementing the six action programs (including APs no. 4 and no. 7), based \non  information  available,  is  estimated  to  be  $141.8 million  for  2003\u20132005.16  This  includes \n$28.2 million  for  training  and  retraining  under  action  program  no. 4,  and  $60 million  for \nadministrative modernization (AP no. 7) under the Phase I program. The costs are estimated on \nthe basis of the measures and actions listed in the policy matrix and will be incurred during \n2003\u20132005. During the postprogram period, there will be some recurrent costs, arising from the \nneed to maintain the assets (e.g., training facilities, and computer systems) created during the \nprogram implementation. Such costs, however, are likely to be small and can be accommodated \nin the regular budget of the Government17 (see section VI on program benefits and impacts). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.  Program Management \n \n70.   OOG and MOHA will be the joint executing agencies for the program under the overall \nleadership  of  the  Prime  Minister.  MOHA  and  OOG  will  be  jointly  responsible  for  the \nimplementation of the measures and actions under Part A of the policy matrix. MOHA will be the \nimplementing agency for Part B of the policy matrix, namely measures and actions under AP \n                                                 \n16 Salary reform is not included as it is not yet clear what precise proposal will be implemented. However, one \nestimate for implementing salary reform is as high as $3,800 million over 2002\u20132005 or 3% annually of GDP. This \nmay not be feasible to implement. While the Government has yet to decide what salary proposals should be \nimplemented, it has indicated that any such proposals must be met from the recurrent budget.  \n17 The IMF has been consulted on the proposed program and has endorsed it. Currently, Viet Nam does not have a \nmedium-term expenditure framework, though the World Bank and the Government are in discussion on this. Within \nthe Government, key central agencies such as the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Investment, and \nthe State Bank of Viet Nam have reviewed the program and supported it. \n   ", "20  \nno. 4, and for reporting on them. OOG will be the implementing agency for Part C of the policy \nmatrix, namely measures and actions under AP no. 7, and for reporting on them. To ensure the \neffective handling of this implementing agency role and responsibility, program management \nunits will be established within MOHA and OOG. Each program  management unit will be \nheaded by a program director and include a core team of staff (of at least three experts). The \nHLCC, established for the formulation of the program, will continue, and will meet formally at \nleast once every quarter, to monitor implementation progress. MOHA and OOG will be jointly \nresponsible  for  overall  program  management,  including  reporting  on  administration  and \ndisbursements of loan proceeds, and maintenance of the Deposit Accounts, and preparation of \nsemiannual progress reports on loan implementation. The actions in Part A will be undertaken \nby both MOHA and OOG as specifically applicable to them, and as indicated in the policy \nmatrix.  Management  of  joint  areas  of  responsibilities  between  MOHA  and  OOG  will  be \norganized  through  a  consultative  process  between  the  two  agencies.  See  Supplementary \nAppendix A for the implementation schedule. \n \n2.   Procurement and Disbursement \n \n71.  In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram loans,18 goods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries will be \nprocured, with due consideration for economy and efficiency, in accordance with standard public \nprocedures in Viet Nam, and normal private sector commercial practices, acceptable to ADB \n(Appendix  4).  In  addition,  special  safeguards  will  be  developed  by  the  Government  for \npurchases of ICT hardware and software to ensure consistency with government-wide ICT \nstandards and ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines. \n \n72.  The proceeds of the proposed program loan will be disbursed for a broad range of \nimports, subject to a negative list of ineligible items. Loan proceeds will be disbursed on the \nbasis of a certification provided by the Borrower, confirming that in each year in which the \nproposed program loan is expected to be disbursed, the value of total imports minus (i) imports \nfrom nonmember countries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) imports financed under other official \ndevelopment assistance, is equal to or greater than the amount expected to be disbursed during \nthe year. \n \n3.   Counterpart Funds \n \n73.  The counterpart funds to be generated from the loan proceeds will be used to finance \nthe  adjustment  costs  of  the  PAR  MP.  The  Government  intends  to  specifically  utilize  the \ncounterpart funds to finance detailed action plans for: (i) PAR AP no. 4 on training and retraining \nto improve the quality of public officials; and (ii) PAR AP no. 7 on administrative modernization \nincluding computerization and e-government initiatives. Accordingly, budgetary arrangements \nhave been agreed with the Ministry of Finance that will guide and regulate the release of \ncounterpart funds for these purposes, as well as the actual transfer of ADB loan funds from the \nDeposit Account in a commercial bank acceptable to the ADB. It is further understood that \nMOHA and OOG will be responsible for ensuring that the necessary arrangements are made in \ncoordination with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning and Investment, as \nappropriate, within the Government\u2019s internal procedures and guidelines, to secure the financing \nfor program implementation purposes.  \n \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 1998.

ADB, in cooperation with OOG and MOHA and other relevant agencies, as considered \nnecessary  and  appropriate,  will  conduct  semiannual  reviews  on  progress  of  program \nimplementation and assess impacts on the structure, organization, and operational efficiencies \nof the public administration system in Viet Nam. The Government and ADB will continue to \nengage  in  policy  dialogue  both  on  sector  issues,  policy  reforms,  and  other  PAR-related \nmeasures  during  the  program  period,  and  on  additional  reforms  that  may  be  considered \nnecessary or desirable. \n \n75.  The Government will provide reports to the ADB on the implementation of the Phase I \nprogram annually, and in particular, on the measures and actions set out in the development \npolicy letter (Appendix 3) and the policy matrix (Appendix 2) semiannually. The semiannual \nreports will be submitted in such form and in such detail and within such periods as ADB may \nreasonably request, and will include: (i) progress made and specific problems encountered \nduring the 6 months under review; (ii) steps taken or proposed to be taken to resolve such \nproblems; and (iii) proposed program activities and expected progress during the following 6 \nmonths. ADB will conduct regular review missions to confirm compliance with measures and \nactions  contained  in  the  policy  matrix,  and  advise  on  actions  to  maintain  program \nimplementation.  On  completion  of  the  Phase  I  program,  the  Government  will prepare  and \nprovide ADB with a comprehensive report on the overall impact of the reforms implemented \nunder the program. Tranching arrangements for Phase I of the program and details of Phases II \nand III are outlined as follows. \n \n  a.  Phase I Program \n \n76.  The financing for the Phase I program, from 2003 to 2005, is to be released in two \ntranches as follows: (i) equivalent of $15 million (ADF) on compliance with the first tranche \nrelease measures and actions, and (ii) $30 million (ADF) on fulfillment of the specified second \ntranche release measures and actions. The first tranche is expected to be released by April \n2003  and  the  second  tranche  by  September  2004.  The  first  and  second  tranche  release \nmeasures and actions are set out in the policy matrix. ADB will review, with the Government, \nprogress in implementing the specified policy and institutional measures and actions set out in \nthe policy matrix approximately 3 months prior to the specified tranche release.  \n \nb.  Phase II Program \n \n77.  Subject to a specific request from the Government for assistance and progress during \nthe Phase I program, the proposal for the Phase II program, covering the period 2006 to 2008, \nwould  be  developed  in  consultation  between  ADB  and  the  Government,  with  fact-finding \ncommencing in early 2005.  \n \nc.  Phase III Program \n \n78.  As in the case of Phase II, a proposal for the Phase III program, covering the period \n2008 to 2010, would be developed in consultation between ADB and the Government, with fact-\nfinding commencing in early 2008.  \n \n \n   ", "22  \nV.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n79.  There are three specific areas of need to be addressed through TA linked directly to the \nprogram, namely: (i) institutional and capacity building support to MOHA for the implementation \nof  the  training  and  retraining  action  plan,  including  management  and  development  of  civil \nservants  and  public  service  delivery  reforms;  (ii) support  to  OOG  for  strengthening  policy \ncoordination to assist the Government in national-level policy coordination and decision-making \nprocess  reforms;  and  (iii) support  to  OOG  for  the  implementation  of  administrative \nmodernization, including computerization and e-government initiatives. The TAs, estimated at \n$3.765 million  in  total,  including  Government  financing,  will  be  implemented  in  close \ncoordination with other development partners for building a stronger partnership on PAR and to \nmaximize synergies. Further co-financing possibilities are being explored. Details of ongoing \ninitiatives by development partners are given in Appendix 7 and Supplementary Appendix D. \nThe  TAs  are  expected  to  be  completed  by  October  2005.  Summary  information  on  the \nobjectives and scope, consulting services, and the implementation and financing arrangements \nfor each of the three TA proposals are given below. Further details on TAs are available on \nrequest (Supplementary Appendix B). \n \nA.  Institutional and Capacity-Building Support to the Ministry of Home Affairs \n \n1.  Objective and Scope \n \n80.  The TA will assist MOHA in modernizing the policy, legal, and institutional arrangements \nfor training and retraining of public officials, as well as enhancing MOHA\u2019s capacity to support \nimplementation  of  training  reform  in  particular  and  PAR  implementation  in  general.  More \nspecifically, the TA will assist MOHA in undertaking skill profiles, TNAs, training of trainers, and \ndeveloping management information, monitoring, and public information systems. The TA will \nalso assist MOHA in developing proposals to enhance gender equity and ethnic minorities\u2019 \nparticipation in the training programs, as well as in the civil service within the framework of the \nGovernment\u2019s already approved National Gender Strategy and Plan of Action 2. The TA would \nalso provide MOHA\u2019s core senior officials with an opportunity to familiarize with best practices \nabroad in training reform and management.  \n \n2.  Deliverables and Outcomes  \n \n81.  The expected outputs of the TA are: (i) a modern policy and legal framework for the \nmanagement and development of civil servants; (ii) a needs and results-based training system \nwith a suite of new training programs in place; (iii) trained trainers and deployment of modern \ntechnology and techniques in training delivery; (iv) MOHA\u2019s enhanced institutional capacity for \nproviding policy direction in training reform, and implementing it with the help of the training \ninstitutions; (iv) improved coordination and monitoring of implementation, and greater public \nawareness of the PAR MP; (v) improved public service delivery; and (vi) proposals for action \nplans for further enhancing gender equity and ethnic minorities\u2019 participation. \n \n3.  Consulting Services \n \n82.  The TA requires 21 person-months of international and 44 person-months of domestic \nconsulting services. The consultants will be recruited as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and procedures acceptable to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants. \n \n ", "  23\n4.  Implementation and Financing Arrangements \n \n83.  MOHA, as Executing Agency for the TA, will establish a project management team \n(PMT) and provide office accommodation, equipment, local transport, and the supplies required \nfor the TA. The PMT, supported by a group of international and domestic experts, will ensure \ninteragency coordination and liaison arrangements with funding agencies involved in related \nareas of training reform, and accomplishing actions under Part B of the policy matrix. The TA \nwill be implemented over a 30-month period, with TA inception scheduled for April 2003 and \ncompletion by October 2005.  \n \n84.   The estimated cost of the TA is $1.16 million, of which ADB will fund $920,000. In \naddition, the Government has requested the Swedish International Development Cooperation \nAgency for parallel financing for related activities. The Government of France has indicated to \ncofinance with ADB in an amount of 150,000 euros. Details on the TA, including cost estimates \nand financing plan and the terms of reference for the consultants, are available on request \n(Supplementary Appendix B). \n \nB.  Policy Coordination Support to the Office of the Government  \n \n1.  Objectives and Scope \n \n85.  The overall objective of the TA is to contribute to continuing enhancement of OOG\u2019s \ncapacity in assisting the Government in national-level policy coordination and decision making. \nThe TA will (i) strengthen OOG\u2019s technical ability to advise and coordinate other agencies \nnotably  in  presenting  policy  decisions  to  the  Prime  Minister  and  the  Government,  and  in \nimplementing  such  decisions;  (ii) enhance  the  policy  analysis  capability  of  OOG  officials; \n(iii) formulate new working rules and procedures and develop internal capacity for improving \npolicy decision-making processes; (iv) assist in improving monitoring of the implementation of \ngovernment decisions; and (v) assist in internal capacity building in coordination, leadership, \nand  change  management.  All  these  activities  will  be  undertaken  following  a  participatory \n(process) approach involving OOG officials and leaders. It is also envisaged that the TA would \nprovide OOG\u2019s core senior officials an opportunity to familiarize themselves with best practices \nabroad in administrative system reengineering. \n \n2.  Deliverables and Outcomes \n \n86.  The expected main outputs of the TA are: (i) improved national level policy coordination \nand  reduced  processing  and  approval  time  for  government  decisions;  (ii) increased \ntransparency, accountability, and predictability through written rules to guide policy formulation \nand  coordination  and  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  Government\u2019s  decisions  and \nconsequent streamlining, clarification, and acceleration of these processes; and (iii) increased \norganizational efficiency through improved analytical skills of OOG officials to perform their roles \nin policy preparation and coordination, and as actors in the improvement of work processes \nthroughout government. \n \n3.  Consulting Services \n \n87.  The TA will require 21 person-months of international consultants and 44 months of \ndomestic consultants. The consultants will be engaged as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. \n   ", "24  \n \n4.  Implementation and Financing Arrangements \n \n88.  The TA would be implemented over a 30-month period with completion by October \n2005. OOG will be the Executing Agency, which will establish a PMT responsible for overall \nsupervision and coordination of the project. The PMT will be chaired by a vice minister and \nsupported by a working group of senior OOG officials. The PMT will also be responsible for \nliaising with other TA projects within OOG to avoid unnecessary overlap. A careful and logical \nsequencing of the TA activities will be necessary, taking into account also TA activities of other \nfunding agencies and OOG\u2019s ongoing initiatives in improving leadership, national-level policy \ncoordination, performance monitoring, and management. OOG, working closely with Viet Nam \nResident  Mission  (VRM),  will  undertake  necessary  arrangements  for  the  TA  and  also  for \nworkshops, seminars, and training programs within the TA framework. \n \n89.   The estimated cost of the TA is $1.015 million, of which the ADB will fund $815,000 \n(jointly with New Zealand). Details on the TA, including cost estimates, financing plan, and the \nterms of reference for the consultants, are available on request (Supplementary Appendix B). \n \nC.  Support to the Office of the Government in the Implementation of Administrative \nModernization, including Computerization and E-Government Initiatives \n \n1.  Objective and Scope \n \n90.  The proposed TA will assist OOG in strengthening its ICT systems development and \nmanagement  capacity  for  the  effective  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  administrative \nmodernization,  computerization,  and  e-government  action  program.  It  will  assist  OOG  in \n(i) building a strategic policy and legal framework for modernization of public administration, \nincluding a detailed plan for e-government; (ii) strengthening capacity and technical skills for \nanalyses and design of work methods and processes; (iii) establishing standard practices and \nprocedures  for  computer  system  planning,  operation,  and  maintenance,  including  TOT; \n(iv) establishing  standard  methodologies  and  procedures  for  systems  development,  project \nmanagement, quality management, procurement, and auditing, including TOT; (v) assisting the \nGovernment in undertaking TNA; and (vi) undertaking TOT in related disciplines. The TA would \nprovide OOG\u2019s core ICT senior officials with an opportunity to familiarize themselves with best \npractices abroad in ICT system management. \n \n  2.  Deliverables and Outcomes \n \n91.  The expected major outputs of the TA include: (i) reduced processing time through \nimproved government work methods and processes; (ii) better quality and security through \nstandards,  procedures,  manuals,  tools,  and  training  curricula  established  for  ICT  project \nmanagement, systems development, business process reengineering, operation, maintenance, \nprocurement, and audit; (iii) training capability enhanced through TOT and training handbooks; \n(iv) an intranet web site established and operational; (v) an e-learning facility for remote training \nand retraining; and (vi) a government portal for public information service. In addition, the TA \nwould provide a detailed plan for further development of e-government initiatives. \n \n3.  Consulting Services \n \n92.  The TA requires 30 person-months of international and 90 person-months of domestic \nconsulting services. The consultants will be recruited as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s \n ", "  25\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and procedures acceptable to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants. \n \n  4.  Implementation and Financing Arrangements \n \n93.  The TA would be implemented over a 30-month period with completion by October \n2005. OOG will be the Executing Agency; it will appoint a project director for TA implementation. \nThe project director will be formally responsible for coordination with other TA projects within \nOOG  and  with  other  agencies  where  appropriate  for  avoiding  unnecessary  overlap.  The \nsteering committee for SAMCom will oversee the TA implementation. The project director, in \ncoordination with SAMCom and with the support of international and domestic consultants, will \nbe responsible for the organization and implementation of the TA activities. \n \n94.  The estimated cost of the TA is $1.59 million, of which ADB will fund $1.27 million. \nFurther cofinancing is being explored. Details on the TA, including cost estimates and financing \nplan and the terms of reference for the consultants, are given in Supplementary Appendix B \n(available on request). \n \n \nVI. PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.   Benefits and Impacts \n \n1.   Economic Benefits \n \n95.  While the program supports the key aims of the Government\u2019s PAR MP, it focuses on \ntwo  core  problem  areas,  i.e.,  training  and  retraining  of  public  officials,  and  administrative \nmodernization including computerization and e-government initiatives, during Phase I (2003\u2013\n2005). The program will bring various benefits and development impacts at different points of \ntime. First, in the short term, the public administration will be more service-oriented and more \nskilled, resulting in better service delivery to businesses and the poor. Second, in the medium \nterm, direct benefits will arise from efficiency cost savings in the public administration system \ndue to improved institutional and functional efficiency, with better trained, more professional and \nbetter skilled civil servants, and due to the impact of the reform of work rules and methods in the \nGovernment, and computerization. There will, third, be some indirect benefits through reduced \ntransaction  costs  and  opportunities  for  rent  seeking  resulting  from  a  more  efficient \nadministration system. This will free up the time and resources of end-users (businesses as well \nas people), which can be put to various productive uses rather than dealing with red tape. \nFourthly, in the long term, benefits will arise from improved governance emanating from better \ngovernment-to-people  interactions  and  improved  participation  facilitated  by  improved  public \nadministration,  including  computerization.  Improved  public  administration  in  terms  of \ntransparency, service delivery, and predictability, as well as more democratic, participatory, and \neffective governance will stimulate economic risk taking of the private sector, leading to higher \nsavings and investment and thereby higher economic growth. \n \n2.   Poverty and Social Impacts \n \n96.   The  poor  should  benefit  through  improved  public  service  delivery  and  access  as \ndescribed above. The poor in Viet Nam have already benefited directly and indirectly from \neconomic growth. Rising demand for labor, employment, and real wages have contributed to \nreducing poverty at record speeds over the past decade. The role and participation of the \n   ", "26  \ngrassroots levels in the policy decision-making process have also increased over the years. \nCitizens have increased opportunities and avenues for more efficient and effective handling and \nmanagement of their complaints. There is greater transparency in the decision-making process \nand public services provision, and overall increased confidence of the citizenry on Government. \nThe administrative reforms facilitated by the program should accelerate these benefits to the \npoor  with  greater  sustainability  (see  Appendix  1,  Annex  1;  Appendix  5;  Appendix  6;  and \nSupplementary Appendix C). \n \n97.   Though the poor have a relatively better social standing in Viet Nam than in most \ncountries at comparable income levels, they still constitute the socially and politically weakest \ngroup. They are the least able to handle rent seeking or to cut through red tape. Undesirable \narbitrary bureaucratic behavior most directly hinders their economic endeavors. Conversely, the \npoor and the vulnerable would be the greatest beneficiaries of the strengthened and accelerated \nreforms assisted by the program, such as improvements in service delivery. \n \n98.  For the potential gains from the program to be realized, however, careful attention will \nhave to be paid to the impact of each specific program and action on the more vulnerable \nsegments of the population, in particular the poor, as well as ethnic minorities and women. More \nskill-based recruitment and performance-based promotion systems, and the rightsizing program, \nshould probably be combined with programs that overcome the limited representation of ethnic \nminorities. Action may also be needed to even the balance for women, fairly well represented in \nthe lower ranks of public service but only symbolically, or not at all, in its higher reaches.19  \n \n3.   Good Governance \n \n99.  The  program  deals  wholly  with  various  aspects  of  public  administration,  and all  its \nbenefits therefore relate, in some sense, to good governance. Its benefits will include a more \naccountable, responsive, and efficient public administration that is better organized, structured, \nresourced, and staffed to assist the Government in achieving its objectives. One particular \nbenefit may be the enhanced ability of a modernized public administration to provide improved \ndecision support and policy advice to the Government. A better paid, more professional, and \nbetter equipped public service system would be able to provide higher quality policy decision-\nmaking support for all levels of the Government. The Government should in turn benefit from \nimproved administrative processes and mechanisms that should relieve decision makers of \nmany of the burdens they now bear, and allow them to concentrate on important policy issues. \nThese should lead to further improvements to the system of public administration. \n \n100.   The  Government  is  already  undertaking  several  decentralization  initiatives,  which \ninclude the delegation of powers for human resources management to the provincial levels, the \nissuance of block grants for public expenditures, and special provisions under the Budget Law. \nThese initiatives will need to be pursued further to secure additional benefits. The program will \nassist in establishing a state based on the rule of law and civil servants will be expected to \ncomply with the law at all times in their work. Improving participation in government, provision \nfor consultation with citizens on draft laws, and the use of surveys for obtaining their views and \nfeedback on government services, will also help strengthen transparency and accountability. \nThe mutually reinforcing effects provided by implementation, from 2003 onward, of the package \nof  PAR  measures  will  help  improve  confidence  in  the  consistency  and  predictability  of \nGovernment actions. \n                                                 \n19 The Government has recently approved a National Gender Strategy and Plan of Action; one of its objectives is to \nachieve women\u2019s equal rights in labor and employment.  \n ", "  27\n \n101.  Details of the expected benefits and impacts from the program are outlined in Annex 1 of \nAppendix 1. \n \nB.  Risks \n \n102.   The program entails three types of risks: some of the necessary measures may not be \nagreed; some may be agreed but not carried out; and some may be carried out but with \nunintended impacts. In terms of the first type of risk, intellectual consensus, political will or \ncapacity, and constraints on financial and human resources do not allow every reform measure \nto go as far or as fast as some of their proponents would wish. Thus, the program does not \nconstitute an ideal set of reform measures for the swiftest conceivable transformation of Viet \nNam's public administration. It constitutes a set of feasible measures on which consensus could \nbe reached and for which resources can be found. It will not bring instantaneous modernization \nbut if properly implemented, it will bring gradual but solid improvements. \n \n103.   The  second  type  of  risk  is  that  decisions  may  not  be  translated  into  actions  or \nimplementation  may  be  delayed.  Governments  often  announce  that  they  are  going  to  do \nsomething (sometimes in response to measures and actions imposed by lenders), but either do \nnot intend to or are unable to give practical effect to such decisions. Such inability may be due \nto political constraints on action or unwillingness to offend powerful interests. It may also be due \nto a failure of the instruments of governance or to instructions being heard but ineffectively \ncarried  out.  Naturally,  these  two  causes  often  combine,  particularly  when  the  civil  service \nconstitutes an effective political force and is itself the object of reform decisions. These are \nrelevant  concerns  for  an  extensive  range  of  reforms  that  will  affect  all  levels  of  public \nadministration in Viet Nam over a long period. However, precisely because the PAR program, \nthough bold, is not overly ambitious, the second risk does not appear overwhelming.20 \n \n104.  Nevertheless,  while  high-level  political  commitment  is  not  in  doubt,  a  number  of \nelements  need  to  be  addressed  to  ensure  effective  reform  implementation.  Resistance  to \nreforms needs to be managed actively (including discussion with stakeholders and the diffusion \nof information about reform objectives), and not allowed to halt or derail reforms. Adequate \nfinancial  and  human  resources  are  also  essential.  Implementation  must  be  managed  in  a \npractical, realistic, and sequenced way, paying keen attention to the proper linkages between \nvarious  reforms.  Adjustments  will  often  be  required  in  the  light  of  experience,  hence  the \nprogram's accent on multiyear rolling plans, management information systems, and monitoring \nand  evaluation,  all  of  which  presume  a  strong  central  leadership  and  management. \nOrganizational  arrangements  for  the  management  of  PAR  implementation  must  be  highly \neffective, and firm leadership must be provided throughout the process. The strong political \ncommitment  shown  in  the  formulation  and  approval  of  the  PAR  MP  must  be  maintained \nthroughout the reform implementation process, and be reflected in public advocacy and active \nparticipation. One key related task will be building ownership and accountability in the line \nagencies that will have to take most of the concrete implementation actions. Without such \nownership it will be difficult to move reforms and restructuring forward. Given these risks, much \nof the policy matrix is tailored to ensuring that the implementation process is in fact effective and \nthat these risks are accordingly minimized. \n                                                 \n20 The  Government  with  its  full  ownership  initiated  the  PAR.  ADB\u2019s  role,  in  coordination  with  other  external \ndevelopment partners of Viet Nam, notably the United Nations Development Programme, has been to help \nimprove PAR\u2019s conception and point out its implications, to help put in place mechanisms for improved further \nanalysis, evaluation, and implementation, and to facilitate implementation through financing.  \n   ", "28  \n \n105.   The third risk is more difficult to analyze and if it materializes, its costs could be much \nhigher. The PAR MP, 2001\u20132010, is arguably a more comprehensive reform program than has \npreviously been pursued in Viet Nam, but not only ambition. The actions in drawing up lessons \nlearned from past and ongoing reform programs and integrating them into current reforms are \nstill being refined but in circumstances where the experience in other countries may not provide \nhighly relevant lessons for implementation in the local context. Moreover, the experience in \nother countries includes many implementation failures.21 Even if PAR outputs are delivered \nsuccessfully, there is not a simple, one-dimensional, logical chain leading from reform decisions \nto desired impacts and outcomes. Although it will be tempting to link any improvements with \nPAR,  it  will  often  be  impossible  to  separate  actual  reform  impacts  from  what  might  have \nhappened anyway. Furthermore, there are multiple outcomes and outcome measures, ranging \nfrom  reducing  corruption,  to  improving  service  quality,  and  to  improving  service  efficiency. \nThese can be potentially conflicting. PAR may lead to improvements by one outcome measure, \nbut at the cost of deterioration in another. In addition, a common approach to measuring \noutcomes  involves  surveys  of  citizens,  businesses,  and  other  stakeholders.  Yet  many \nadministrative processes are characterized by informational asymmetry: administrators have an \ninformational advantage over citizens, businesses, and even politicians in the legislature (less \nso politicians in the executive). Thus, citizen perceptions may be overly generous or critical, \ndepending on small positive or negative changes that are visible to them. These risks will be \nmitigated through the monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to be put into place, combined \nwith regular exchange of information between ADB and the Government. ADB also intends to \ndeploy a higher than normal level of specialist staff input to support the Government in this \ncomplex monitoring effort (see program framework in Appendix 6). \n \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.   Specific Assurances \n \n106.   The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which are incorporated in the Loan Agreement: \n \n(i)    the  measures  and  actions  included  in  the  program  and  specified  in  the \ndevelopment policy letter and the policy matrix will be adopted in a timely manner. \nSuch measures and actions will continue to be in effect, to ensure the sustainability \nof public administration reforms; and  \n \n(ii)   adequate and timely counterpart funds to implement the program, in particular for \nPAR APs no. 4 and no. 7, will be provided.  \n \nB.   Measures and Actions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n107.

Introduction  \n1.  Viet  Nam  has  a  four-tiered  administrative  structure\u2014central,  provincial,  district,  and \ncommune levels. There are five state institutions at the central level, with counterparts at \nsubordinate  levels:  (i) the  500-member  elected  National  Assembly  and  its  elected  local \ncounterparts, the People's Councils; (ii) the President, who is supported by a vice president; \n(iii) the Government, and its local counterparts, the People's Committees; (iv) the Supreme \nCourt and the local People's Courts; and (v) the Supreme Institute of Procuracy, and the local \nPeople's  Procuracy.  At  the  provincial  level,  the  administrative  structure  has  a  series  of \ndivisions\u2014districts, provincial cities, and towns. Cities under direct central rule are divided into \nurban districts, rural districts, and towns. At the district level, rural districts are divided into \ncommunes,  townships,  and  wards,  while  urban  districts  are  classified  as  wards.  At  the \ncommune level, communes are divided into urban and rural. \nB.  National Assembly \n2.  The 1992 Constitution provides that the National Assembly is the highest representative \nand legislative body and that it exercises \"supreme oversight\" over all state activities. All state \nbodies such as the Government, the People's Supreme Court, and the People's Supreme \nInstitute of Procuracy are held accountable to, and are appointed by, the National Assembly. \nOver time, the National Assembly has enhanced its legislative role and its level of oversight of \nexecutive government bodies.  \nC.  The Government1 \n3.  The Government is the highest executive body, charged with the overall management and \nhandling of the economy and the supervision of public sector agencies at all level. In practice, \npower and authority are conferred on the CPV Secretary, the President, and the Prime Minister, \ntogether  with  the  Chair  of  the  National  Assembly  and  some  core  ministers  to  form  the \nPolitbureau. The Government is structured into ministries and agencies that report to specific \nministers. There are 16 ministers, including the Prime Minister and four deputy prime ministers, \neach with broad areas of responsibility. There are 26 ministries and 13 government agencies. \n4.  Considerable authority is conferred on the Prime Minister, who is empowered to designate \n(for  the  National  Assembly\u2019s  approval)  ministers,  to  appoint  deputy  ministers,  and  other \nmembers of provincial bodies, and to restructure public agencies. The Prime Minister can \noverride the decisions of ministers and local authorities that are in contravention of the law, and \notherwise exercise a supervisory role over these bodies. The Office of the Government (OOG) \nprovides advisory and administrative support to the Prime Minister. Overall policy direction is set \nby the CPV. The Prime Minister makes decisions on new laws and policies, after consultation \nwith relevant stakeholders, which are then endorsed by monthly cabinet meetings and the \nNational Assembly as necessary. OOG has the authority to convene cabinet meetings.  \n5.  Policy submissions are submitted by ministers to the relevant vice chairman at OOG. He \ncan return them when incomplete, inconsistent with past decisions, inadequately consulted on, \n                                                 \n1  See also The Structure and Functions of the Government in Viet Nam. 2002. Background report on public \nadministration reform in Viet Nam prepared for the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Mekong Economics. May. ", "Appendix 1  31\nproviding only a single option, or if potentially illegal. In doing so, OOG\u2019s role may be mainly \nadministrative  (ensuring  that  submissions  are  complete)  and/or  substantive  (analyzing  the \ncontent of the submission, and making recommendations on this basis), depending on the issue \nat hand, and on the OOG unit and officers involved. However, more recently, OOG has sought \nto  assert  a  more  strategic  role  as  a  key  policy  advisor  to  the  Prime  Minister  and  to  the \nGovernment.2 \n6.  Once a policy submission is complete, it is reviewed by the relevant deputy prime minister, \nand further questions may be asked. In some cases, it goes to Prime Minister\u2019s Research \nCommission for further screening, redrafting, and possible questions. Then it either goes to the \nPrime Minister for approval, or a deputy prime minister will be delegated to approve it. Many \nissues brought to the Prime Minister are vetted during the daily meetings of the Politburo \nStanding Committee (presently seven members) before a decision is reached.  \n7.  Viet Nam\u2019s central government policy-making institutions can be viewed as a hybrid of \nclassic  cabinet  and  presidential  models.  Like  the  cabinet  model,  the  Viet  Nam  system  is \nunderpinned by collective accountability for decision making. However, the cabinet is only one \nof the key structures that is part of the collective accountabilities, and consensus building stems \nmainly from informal rather than formal processes. Unlike the classic cabinet model, policy \ndecisions are made by the Prime Minister or deputy prime minister (under delegation), after \nendorsement from the Politbureau Standing Committee. Although complex decisions involving \nmany sectors may be discussed by the cabinet, and although ministers are briefed on the \nprogress of policy submissions made by their ministries, the cabinet neither makes decisions, \nnor questions decisions once they are made. Like the presidential model, the Prime Minister \nrelies  on  bilateral  or  trilateral  arrangements  between  himself  (facilitated  by  OOG)  and  his \nministers, who are accountable for decisions within their particular sphere.  \n8.  At all levels, decision making in Viet Nam is characterized by consensus seeking. This is a \nstrong guiding principle. By engaging a wide range of actors before decisions are finalized, \nresponsibility is shared and political risks are reduced. While this maintains stability through \ninvolving many elements of society in decisions, it can be a protracted process leading, at times, \nto slow response by the Government to the timely management of critical issues. One key \nconstraint is that the policy development process lacks sufficient stakeholder consultation and \nparticipation, and hence may not always be responding to real needs. The Government now \nplans to consult stakeholders on key laws and policies. \n1.  Judiciary  \n9.  The court system is established both at local and central levels. The Supreme Court is the \nhighest court of appeal and review. It supervises the implementation of sentences passed by \nlower courts as well as organizing and conducting professional training for judges, jurors, and \nother court staff. It also provides professional guidance both for drafting legal documents and to \nlower courts.  \n10.  The Supreme People's Procuracy is an agency under the supervision of the National \nAssembly with responsibility to ensure compliance with the law by ministries, agencies, other \norgans  of  government,  local  organs  of  power,  economic  bodies,  social  organizations,  and \ncitizens. Its functions embrace both the criminal and civil jurisdictions. It is responsible both for \n                                                 \n2  This was one outcome of an institutional strengthening TA that ADB provided to OOG in 2001\u20132002 (TA: 3652-\nVIE). ", "32 Appendix 1 \npublic  prosecutions  and  for  supervision  of  the  implementation  of  laws.  Viet  Nam's  judicial \nsystem is highly centralized, through the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), with ultimate decision-\nmaking authority resting with the National Assembly. \n2.  Local Government \n11.  Viet Nam's local administration system is divided into three levels: provinces (61 units), \ndistricts (586 units), and communes (10,391 units). At all three levels there is a representative \nbody (the People's Council) and an executive body (the People's Committee). The people's \ncommittees and people\u2019s councils often have overlapping membership. The local people elect \nthe People's Council, the candidates for which are usually nominated by the Vietnam Fatherland \nFront and approved by the higher-level administrative unit. The People's Council selects the \nchairman and vice chairman of the people's committees.  \n3.  The Civil Service \n12.  The civil service, down to district level (but excluding the police and the army), comprises \nabout 1.3 million officials of whom 200,000 officials work for the central Government and 1.1 \nmillion work at the provincial level. However, the number of persons on the payroll who are \nfunded from the budget is much larger than that as it comprises a large group of war veterans \nas well as others disabled during the war.  \n13.  The remuneration level of public servants is very low, despite some recent increases. Most \nhave an average salary of around D800,000 ($58) per month. The most senior civil servants \nreceive a salary of around D1.5 million ($107) per month. However, indications from the Ministry \nof Home Affairs (MOHA) are that salaries represent only a third to a half of the remuneration \nthat civil servants receive. MOHA estimates that a civil servant needs around D2 million ($143) \nper month to support a reasonable standard of living. As well as salary, civil servants receive \nallowances (including for housing) and collect various payments for services rendered in their \nwork. Many middle-level civil servants find that they cannot make ends meet without a second \nincome or engaging in rent-seeking activity. \nD.  Public Administration Reform \n1.  Institutional Reform \n14.  Moving from a system that emphasized collective authority over personal and property \nrights to a state based on the rule of law requires the adoption of new norms such the powers of \nthe state being confined to those that are stated under the law. However, the current legal \nframework contains many gaps in the laws that are and will be needed to regulate a market \neconomy;3 the process of preparing legal documents is time wasting, sometimes irrational, and \nfocuses more on quantity than quality. The preparation is carried out without adequate policy \nstudies or research and consultation, often leading to immediate needs for revision.4 The quality \nof  many  of  the  existing  and  new  laws  is  not  high,  rendering  their  interpretation  and  their \napplication in business or private matters problematic. Viet Nam therefore needs to make urgent \nimprovements to the quality of the law formulation process so as to provide a sounder basis for \n                                                 \n3  Such as, for example, the regulation of monopoly power, capital, financial, real estate, and labor markets, and \nintellectual property. \n4  See also the background paper PAR Policies and Major Issues. 2002. Report on public administration reform in \nViet Nam prepared for ADB. Mekong Economics. May.  ", "Appendix 1  33\ntheir application and enforcement.5 The law making process through the National Assembly also \nneeds reform to improve efficiency, including the opportunities for proper examination of draft \nlaws, recognizing that Viet Nam has a long list of laws that it wishes to enact during the \ntransition to a socialist-oriented market economy. \n15.  The Ministry of Justice has recently undertaken a highly consultative and quite successful \nassessment of the needs of the legal sector, with support from several development partners, \nas a basis for the implementation of reforms in the legal sector. A legal sector reform strategy, \noutlining a range of sequenced reform actions and measures for implementation, is expected to \nbe put before the Government later this year by the Ministry of Justice.6 Government support for \nmaking the necessary reforms, which will require a long-term program, is high.7 \n16.  Since 1994, the Government has been engaged in reforming administrative procedures so \nas to overcome red tape by reducing the complexity of administrative requirements and to \nimprove service delivery.8 To date this has focused particularly on business-related issues such \nas foreign investment and business registration under the Business Enterprise Law of 1999. \nHowever, many procedures remain complicated or unresponsive to needs in areas such as \nconstruction, land ownership, land use in urban areas, and petition handling.9 In 1996, the \nGovernment launched trials in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, and Hai Phong of the \u201cone-stop shop\u201d \nmodel of service delivery. These have recently been evaluated favorably and the Government is \nnow planning extension of the delivery model to the provinces with the potential to improve the \nquality and standard of service delivery, particularly to the poor. The Government is exploring \nalternative public service delivery management mechanisms with MOHA.  \n2.  Organizational Reform  \n17.  There is much scope for rationalization of ministries and agencies to clarify functions and \nauthority; to remove areas of overlap; to reduce the number of agencies either by abolition or \nmerger; and to simplify the number of levels of the organizational structures.10 The first step \ntoward  restructuring  was  the  passage  of  the  New  Law  on  Government  Organizations  in \nNovember 2001. The Government has since gained approval from the National Assembly for a \nnew  structure  for  the  government  apparatus  which  reduces  the  number  of  agencies  and \nresolves a number of areas of overlap between agencies. The Government has announced that \nit will soon issue a new draft Decree 15, which is to set out the functions of the Prime Minister, \nministers, ministries, etc. \n18.   Relations  among  the  different  levels  of  Government  are  complex,  involving  multiple \nreporting points between administrative organizations within, to, and from each level. While a \nsignificant  degree  of  autonomy  has  been  extended  to  local  administrations  with  regard  to \ndispositions of allocated budgets and adoption and implementation of local socioeconomic \n                                                 \n5  See ADB working paper PAR Action Program #1 on Reforms of Drafting, Promulgating and Enhancing the Quality \nof Legal Normative Documents. 2002.

", "34 Appendix 1 \nplans,11 a common public perception is that the Government is overcentralized but that the \ninstitutional capacity needed for greater decentralization is weak.  \n19.  Efforts  to  combat  corruption  have  involved  legal  reform,  reform  of  administrative \nprocedures, and reform of the structure and remuneration of the civil service, and strengthening \ncomplaint channels for citizens.12 In January 2002, the Government issued a decree requiring, \ninter alia, civil servants to declare their assets and those of their relatives so that the information \nis  available  to  agencies  responsible  for  investigating  property  accumulation.  The  Public \nAdministration Reform (PAR) will reinforce this through the planned development of an ethics \ncode for civil servants. \n3.  Human Resources: Improving the Quality of the Civil Service   \n20.  The overall quality of the civil service is weak. This in turn impacts adversely on levels of \norganizational performance. Many current staff are seen as inadequately skilled or motivated to \nproperly perform their duties.13 While Viet Nam seeks a civil service that is of higher quality in \nthe sense that it is competent, professional and ethical, there is a need to develop detailed \nprofiles of the professional and other skills required by civil servants to support policy-making \nand service delivery. Much of the existing legal and policy framework for the operation of the \ncivil  service  is  fragmented  and  the  various  laws  and  decrees  need  to  be  reviewed  and \nmodernized so as to set out the roles, duties and conditions of service in a contemporary way. \nMore recently, MOHA has been preparing a submission on the scope for decentralization of \npersonnel management. The future institutional arrangements and the powers for managing the \ncivil service would need to be part of that examination.14 While there have been a number of \nincreases in salary paid to civil servants, most do not earn a living wage.15 This affects levels of \nmotivation  in  work  and  encourages  rent-seeking  behavior.  Following  review,  proposals  for \nraising salaries through a series of increases to a minimum wage level and for fully monetizing \nsalary, and for linking pay and performance, have been formulated and are to be submitted to \nthe Government.16  \n21.  Paradoxically, there is lack of qualified staff to meet the new requirements and to perform \naccordingly whereas at the same time there are many who are unable to meet the current \nperformance requirements. The Government launched a rightsizing program in 200017 with a \ntarget of a 15% reduction in payroll. The program is ongoing with about 3% of civil servants18 so \nfar affected. Staff who are made redundant are compensated. Two key concerns are to ensure \nthat the most inefficient civil servants are made redundant and provided with compensation and, \nsecond, that the exercise is linked to the planned restructuring of the civil service toward \nensuring that civil servants with the right skills are placed in the right job. \n22.  The  Government  has  therefore  given  more  attention  proportionately  to  improving  the \nquality of civil servants, as they will ultimately be the ones who carry out the reforms and must in \nturn reform themselves. Training and retraining are a critical part of the Government\u2019s strategy \n                                                 \n11 The New Law on the Organization of the Government of November 2001 enables the delegation of power to the \nlocal level, especially in the areas of budget and organization of personnel. \n12 Summary of Viet Nam Governance Assessment in Clay Wescott (ed.), Key Governance Issues in Cambodia, Lao \nPDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam. 2001.

Improvements  through  training  need  to  be  linked  to  and  integrated  with \nappropriate and necessary policies on personnel recruitment, promotion, and development.  \n4.  Financial Management Reform \n23.   Financial management reform in Viet Nam has proceeded slowly and until relatively \nrecently was treated as separate from PAR. The passage of the 1997 Budget Law provided \ngreater transparency to expenditure on the national level, but for expenditures at the local level \nthis is not so, particularly because of the powers that provinces etc. have to raise some of their \nown revenue.19 Government reviews,20 undertaken with funding agency support, have proposed \na package of measures to improve transparency, provide a forward estimate process, better \ntarget the allocations of funds to key sectors, and improve accounting practices and financial \nmanagement  systems.  These  are  at  an  advanced  stage  of  consideration.  Recently,  after \nsuccessful experimentation in Ho Chi Minh City, the Prime Minister agreed to expand the pilot \nblock grant and staffing scheme in administrative agencies.21 A related decision of the Prime \nMinister approves a new financial mechanism for administrative agencies, which provides a \ngreater  degree  of  autonomy,  flexibility,  and  certainty  to  those  agencies  in  managing  their \nfinancial resources.22 \nE.  Management of Reform Implementation \n24.  Since 1997, responsibility for oversight of PAR implementation has been assigned to the \nPAR Steering Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister. It has high-level membership drawn \nfrom ministers responsible for the various ministries and agencies involved in implementation \nand this has recently been strengthened through the addition of a deputy prime minister and a \nsenior  CPV  official.  The  Committee  is  supported  by  a  small  secretariat  based  in  MOHA. \nAdequate resourcing is essential to successful PAR implementation. The Committee would also \nbenefit from having a well-developed management information system and a monitoring and \nevaluation system in place.23  \n \n \n                                                 \n19 The Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 182/2001/QD-TTg on fiscal transparency allows more budgetary information to \nbe made public and requires implementation at the local level. \n20 Government of Viet Nam/World Bank/ADB/IMF Joint Expenditure Review, 2000. \n21 Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 192/2001/QD-TTg. \n22 Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 10/2002/ND-CP. \n23 ADB discussion paper Viet Nam PAR Master Program: Issues, Problems, and Implementation Strategies. 2002. \nJune.

Background  \n \n1.  Promoting good governance including Public Administration Reform (PAR) is one of the \nstrategic thrusts of Asian Development Bank (ADB) operations in Viet Nam. This is one of the \nkey pillars of the Country Strategy and Program (2002\u20132004), endorsed by the ADB Board in \nJanuary 2002. In its operations in Viet Nam to date, ADB has exerted significant efforts in \nsupporting governance-related activities; especially through technical assistance (TA). Besides \nthe institutional strengthening and capacity building support attached to loan financing, ADB has \nbeen active in providing governance-related assistance to key central institutions including the \nMinistry of Planning and Investment, the State Auditor General Office (SAGO), the Ministry of \nFinance, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA), and the Office of the Government (OOG). The \nADB has also extended considerable support to the Government for the formulation of a PAR \nStrategy and the PAR Master Program, 2001\u20132010. \n \n2.  After approval of the PAR Master Program by the Prime Minister in September 2001, \nADB was behind the initiative for a joint government-donor workshop, held as a retreat in Ha \nLong Bay, to assist the Government to focus on the detailed implementation implications. \nTogether with United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), governments of Sweden and \nDenmark, ADB cofunded this workshop and a subsequent follow-up workshop (held in April \n2002) on the implementation of the PAR Master Program. In these workshops, attended by \nhigh-level government officials, and in the consultative group meetings (in December 2001 and \nJune 2002), ADB urged the Government to allocate high priority and the requisite financial and \nhuman resources to ensure effective implementation of the PAR Master Program. Also, during \nPresident Chino\u2019s visit to Viet Nam in October 2000, he strongly emphasized governance and \nPAR issues and offered substantial financial and TA support from ADB.  \n \n3.  ADB is now recognized as one of the lead funding partners in Viet Nam in the areas of \ngovernance and PAR. With the provision of a program loan to support the implementation of the \nPAR Master Program, and the ongoing and planned support in legal system development, \nADB\u2019s role in the areas of governance and PAR will become more strategic and pivotal.  \n \nB.  The Government\u2019s Request \n \n4.  Until early 2002, it was government policy not to borrow for PAR projects, particularly \nbecause PAR was considered too sensitive an area. However, by the time of ADB\u2019s country \nprogramming  mission  in  April  2002,  the  Government  had  reviewed  this  policy.  The \nGovernment\u2019s decision to change this policy and borrow for PAR is a landmark one. The \nrequest  to  ADB  to  provide  financing  for  PAR  Master  Program  implementation,  formally \nsubmitted to the 2002 country programming mission, represents a major breakthrough: greater \nimpetus  can  now  be  given  to  PAR,  especially  if  more  resources  can  be  tapped  by  the \nGovernment  for  this  purpose.  The  decision  of  the  Government  also  reflects  not  only  its \ncommitment to PAR but also increased openness to policy dialogue. \n \n5.  In  recognizing  the  strategic  importance  and  also  the  urgency  of  the  request,  ADB \nresponded, positively, to the Government. The request was treated as highly urgent because (i) \nthe Government was already into the second year of the implementation period of the PAR \nMaster Program; and (ii) for ADB support to be timely and have due impact, it was desirable to \ncapture  at  least  3  years,  2003\u20132005,  of  the  first  phase  (2001\u20132005)  of  the  PAR  Master \nProgram. ADB, therefore, moved expeditiously, to mobilize the resources and the expertise ", "Appendix 1, Annex 2  39\n \nnecessary, to process a financing proposal within 2002, although such a loan proposal had not \nbeen originally included in the ADB\u2019s planned assistance to Viet Nam for 2002 or 2003. \n \nC.  Development of the Program Loan Proposal  \n \n6.    The approach adopted to formulate the program loan proposal was highly consultative and \nparticipatory. The preparation of the program loan proposal was undertaken jointly by the two \nkey concerned agencies, i.e., MOHA and OOG, and ADB. Through a series of workshops, \nrepresentatives from all key government agencies, the Communist Party of Viet Nam (CPV), \nand the National Assembly Secretariat were involved in the program loan proposal preparatory \nwork. Also, consultations were held with key partners active in the area of PAR, such as UNDP, \nWorld  Bank,  governments  of  Sweden,  Denmark,  Netherlands,  aid  agencies  of  Germany, \nNorway  and  Switzerland  and  United  Kingdom.  From  the  outset  it  was  agreed  with  the \nGovernment that a Joint Task Team, comprising government and ADB representatives, would \nwork jointly to develop the program loan proposal. A high-level coordinating committee (HLCC), \ncomprising vice ministers from OOG and MOHA and the ADB country director for Viet Nam, \nwas also set up specifically to oversee the whole process. At the request of ADB, the UNDP \nresident representative was invited to join the HLCC. The timetable that was agreed with the \nGovernment to complete the work was extremely tight, and the Government was made aware of \n(i) the need to demonstrate commitment and support at key levels within the Government, and \n(ii) the need to ensure the fullest possible participation by all key stakeholders in critical stages \nof  the  formulation  of  the  program  loan  proposal.  An  intensive  effort  was  first  required  to \nundertake and to support the fact-finding process.  \n \n7.  The work of the ADB Fact-Finding Mission, which began in late May, was conducted \nover an extended period up to 26 July 2002. Prior to this, the two key concerned vice ministers \nfrom MOHA and OOG traveled to ADB in Manila for consultation with senior staff and a meeting \nwith Management. As a first part of the fact-finding process, ADB commissioned, by quickly \nmobilizing domestic and international expertise knowledgeable on Viet Nam PAR issues, two \nstatus reports and a set of eight analytical/diagnostic working papers. The working papers \ncovered:  (i)  a  diagnostic  analysis  (on  the  structure,  content,  coherence,  interlinkages, \nsequencing  issues,  etc.)  of  the  reform  agenda  under  the  PAR  Master  Program;  and \n(ii) identification  of  the  policy,  institutional,  organizational,  and  administrative  measures \nnecessary to ensure effective implementation of the PAR Master Program.1 These reports and \npapers provided baseline information on the public administration system and reforms to date in \nViet Nam. They were discussed at the working sessions of the Joint Task Team, in May and \nJune 2002. The working papers were translated into Vietnamese, and used to facilitate the \ndiscussions with the Government, focusing on particular PAR implementation issues. For this \npurpose, a series of intensive working and brainstorming sessions were held, in the form of \nworkshops  and  retreats  in  late  May  and  early  June,  involving  key  stakeholders  from  the \nGovernment and external funding agencies.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The activities and outputs accomplished under several ADB TAs served as an important basis for and underpinned \nthe work of the Fact-Finding Mission. These include: TA No. 2673-VIE, Supporting the Public Administration \nReform Program, for $650,000, approved in October 1996; TA No. 3023-VIE, Strengthening Capacity for Public \nAdministration Reform, Phase II, for $995,000, approved in May 1998; TA No. 3652-VIE, Institutional Support to \nthe Office of the Government, for $500,000, approved in May 2001. There has also been extensive analytical work, \nincluding: \u201cSummary of Viet Nam Governance Assessment\u201d, in Clay Wescott, ed., 2001, Key Governance Issues in \nCambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam. Manila, ADB; and \u201cBuilding Modern Governance\u201d in World Bank and \nADB, 2001, Viet Nam Development Report, Hanoi, World Bank. ", "40 Appendix 1, Annex 2 \n8.  The Fact-Finding Mission was formally launched with a workshop retreat from 12 to 15 \nJune 2002 in Ha Long, Quang Ninh province, organized by MOHA, OOG, and ADB. This was \npreceded by a two-day workshop on 30\u201331 May 2002 held in Hanoi. Working papers were \nprepared and presented on the overall implementation of PAR and on PAR APs no. 4 and no. 7 \nin  particular.  At  both  these  workshops,  up  to  50  representatives  from  various  government \nministries  and  central  agencies  participated,  including  MOHA,  OOG,  the  PAR  Steering \nCommittee, CPV, the National Assembly Secretariat, the Ministry of Planning and Investment, \nthe Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Justice, etc., as well as representatives from UNDP. The \nMission also met individually with ministries and government agencies, and with representatives \nof the funding community.  \n \n9.  The outcome of this fact-finding process formed the basis to develop an aide memoire, \nwhich was presented to the Government at a wrap-up meeting on 26 July 2002. Subsequent to \nthis, and following a management review meeting held in Manila on 12 August, appraisal work \non the program loan proposal was undertaken. This was also done over an extended period of \ntime, from late August to early October 2002. During the appraisal stage, extensive discussions \nwere held with MOHA and OOG, respectively, to fully consider such issues as coherence, \ninterlinkages, implementability, timing, and the sequencing of the measures and actions to be \nincluded in the policy matrix. Some key principles that underpinned these discussions included \nthe need to ensure: \n\u2022  selection of measures and actions that have full government ownership and that \nwould be effective in achieving desired outcomes;  \n\u2022  that the overall mix and number of measures and actions provide the appropriate \nbreadth of coverage of key issues in the PAR Master Program, while focusing on \nthe areas (APs no. 4 and no. 7) for which the Government has sought financing; \nand \n\u2022  appropriate  linkages  between  the  various  measures  and  actions  and  the \nsequencing of these with due consideration to what is realistic and achievable, \nnot only under action programs no. 4 and no. 7 but also through the measures \nand actions in other parts of the PAR Master Program, such as structural reform, \nwhere their implementation is related to and will affect the success of APs no. 4 \nand no. 7. \n \n10.    Within the framework of these foregoing considerations, the program loan proposal was \ndeveloped to reflect the objectives, and the measures and actions under the PAR Master \nProgram that are critical to its success, but with particular focus on APs no. 4 and no. 7.  \n \n11.  The development of the policy matrix and the formulation of relevant measures and \nactions were carried out by the Joint Task Team, in a highly process oriented, collaborative, and \nconsultative manner. This led to the successful signing of the memorandum of understanding \nbetween the Government and ADB on 24 October 2002.  \n ", "POLICY MATRIX   \n \nProgram Goal \nTo build a democratic, clean, strong, professional, modern, effective and efficient public administration system, capable of supporting nation building and development \n \nDevelopment  Phase 1 (2003\u20132005)  Phase 2a  Phase 3a \nObjectives  (2006\u20132008)  (2008\u20132010) \nMeasures and Actions  Timeline  Monitoring     \n(action by)  Arrangements/Verifiable \nIndicators \nA.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \nSector identified as a national  Yes  Sector identified as a national  Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?  priority in country poverty  \n  partnership agreement? \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \nSupporting the Public Administration Reform (PAR) Master Program offers an important opportunity for improving \ngovernment efficiency and effectiveness; strengthening accountability, transparency, and good governance; and \npromoting participation and democracy. All of these are valuable contributors to achieving poverty reduction, \ngrowth, and social development. There is a strong link between effective administrations at all levels and poverty \nreduction. The Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) calls for accelerating the reform \nof institutions and polices that affect poor people.  This loan and attached technical assistance (TA) will aim, inter \nalia, at ensuring that the PAR will be implemented in a pro-poor manner.   \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis       Proposed Classification: Other  (governance) \n \nPAR measures will have significant positive impact upon poverty reduction.  \nAs the result of economic growth by efficient and effective PAR, more opportunities will be created for the poor to \nengage in trading and improve home-based enterprises. \nStrong indirect benefits are expected to reach the poor in terms of improved service delivery and promoting \nparticipation and democracy. Any efficiency gain in service delivery will directly benefit the poor. The poor's access \nto basic services and infrastructure, especially in the mountainous regions and in poor urban areas, must be \nensured as a priority.  \nCareful consideration should be given to provision of services through the private sector to enhance public service \nprovision to fill the gaps. While private sector involvement in providing services could help expand the number of \njobs and in the process create new employment opportunities, prices of services will likely go up. To minimize such \nimpacts, services at the community level need to be provided at increased cost efficiency. \nDecentralized public administration should make local level government be accountable to the poor for their \nparticipation in decision-making on development programs and delivery of services. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder analysis prepared              Yes  \nThe program preparation team conducted stakeholder consultations with national and local officials, funding \nagencies, and nongovernment organizations with experience in working in different aspects of the PAR to date.  \nKey stakeholders and their capacity, needs, and constraints were identified.  \nParticipation Strategy                To be prepared \nStakeholder participation could be sought during the implementation of the program, for instance, at the local level, \nparticularly in the context of decentralization. Special attention should be paid to the needs of the poor, women and \nethnic minorities. Also, training support, career development and mechanisms to increase participation of these \ngroups (large and small) in local authorities, management boards and service delivery should be promoted under \nthe program loan.  \n \n \n \n                                                           \n1  Details are given in Supplementary Appendix A.
