The  Project  aim  is  to  minimize  the\npotential  adverse  impacts  of  coastal  erosion  in  critical  coastal\nstretches  through  the  establishment  of  appropriate  physical\ninterventions  intended  to  stabilize  the  coastline.  Environmental\ndegradation in selected lagoons, that support coastal fishing will\nbe addressed by following the Special Area Management (SAM)\nplanning  approach,  which  has  been  pilot-tested  in  Sri  Lanka.\nThe Project will also encourage the sustained management and\ndevelopment  of  coastal  fisheries  resources  by  implementing\nactivities  intended  to  address  the  following  identified  issues:\noverfishing  in  coastal  waters,  the  high  percentage  of  fish\nwastage,  and  lack  of  infrastructure  support  facilities  in  specific\nlocations.  The \nthe  concerned\ninstitutional  capabilities  of \nGovernment agencies and community organizations in resource\nmanagement  will  be  strengthened  under  the  Project  through\ninterventions  intended  to  address  the  identified  institutional\nweaknesses.\n\nCategory  -   A\nAn environmental impact assessment (EIA) was undertaken and\nthe summary EIA was circulated to the Board on 29 July 1999.\n\nAttention is urgently needed to address the following key issues\nin the Sri Lankan coastal resources sector: (i) serious erosion of\nthe  coastline,  especially  in  areas  with  concentrated  economic\nactivity  or  vital  infrastructure;  (ii)  unmanaged  fishing  in  coastal\nand offshore areas; (iii) pollution and uncontrolled exploitation of\nlagoons  and  estuaries,  coral  reefs,  mangrove  swamps,  sea\ngrass  beds,  other  wetlands,  and  dune  systems;  and  (iv)\nwidespread  poverty  among  the  coastal  population.  Failure  to\naccord  priority  to  these  issues  would  put  the  enormous\ncontribution  of  the  coastal  belt  to  the  economy  at  risk.  A\nsignificant  percentage  of  the  population  living  in  the  coastal\nareas  obtain  their  livelihood  by  exploiting  the  fishing  and\nnonliving  marine  resources.  Many  live  below  the  poverty  line\nand  unless  measures  are  taken  to  improve  their  income  levels\nand \nlivelihood\nactivities,  the  pressure  they  exert  on  the  resource  base  will\ncontinue  to  exacerbate  the  situation.  Institutional  reforms  and\ncapacity-building  efforts  are  required  to  support  more  efficient\nmanagement  practices.  The  Government  will  not  be  able  to\nimplement  an  integrated  approach  to  the  conservation  and\nthe  necessary\nmanagement  of  coastal  resources  without \nadministrative capacities and legal environment.\n\nto  undertake  alternate \n\nthey  are  retrained \n\n\fObjectives and Scope\n\niii\n\n(ii) \n\nschemes; \n\nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  establish  integrated\nmanagement of coastal resources to improve their sustainability.\nThe Project will have four components: (i) coastline stabilization,\nwhich  will  address  the  problem  of  coastal  erosion  and  develop\ncoastal\nproactive/preventive  management \nenvironment  and  resource  management  (CERM),  which  will\naddress  problems  of  coastal  resource  degradation  and  include\nactivities  intended  to  reduce  pollution  in  lagoons  and  relieve\nresource\nresources; \npressure  on  coastal \nmanagement  and  quality  improvement,  which  will  aim  at\nsustainable  coastal  fisheries  management  supported  by  the\nconstruction  of  harbors/anchorages  and  ancillary  facilities  that\nwill  allow  the  improvement  of  fish  quality  and  the  reduction  of\nhandling  losses;  and  (iv)  institutional  strengthening,  which  will\nenhance the institutional capabilities of the Ministry of Fisheries\nand  Aquatic  Resources  Development \n(MFARD),  other\nconcerned  agencies,  and  community  organizations  in  coastal\nand fisheries resource management.\n\nfisheries \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $80.0  million  equivalent,\ncomprising about $44.0 million (55 percent) in foreign exchange\nand  approximately  $36.0  million  (45  percent)  in  local  currency\ncosts.\n\nSource\n\n Foreign          Local          Total\nExchange     Currency       Cost     Percent\n\n$ million\n\nBank\nThe Netherlands\nGovernment\nBeneficiaries\n\n29.32\n7.31\n7.37\n-\n\n10.68\n5.45\n19.78\n0.09\n\n40.00     50.0\n12.76     16.0\n27.15     33.9\n0.09       0.1\n\nTotal\n\n44.0\n\n36.0\n\n80.0   100.0\n\nThe equivalent in various currencies of SDR 28,806,000 ($40.0\nmillion approximately) from the Bank\u2019s Special Funds resources.\nThe  amortization  period  will  be  32  years  including  a  grace\nperiod  of  8  years,  with  an  interest  charge  of  1  percent  per\nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter.\n\nAn interagency project steering committee will be established, to\nbe  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  MFARD  to  ensure  the  full\ncooperation of and effective liaison with the other participating or\nconcerned \nNongovernment\norganizations  (NGOs)  and  community-based  organizations\n(CBOs)  will  also play  an  important  role  in  implementing project\nactivities  at  the  community level.

It  was  also\nconsidered necessary to address the indiscriminate extraction of nonliving marine resources. To\nestablish the feasibility of the project, the Bank approved in June 1998 technical assistance (TA)\nto  assist  the  Government  in  the  preparation  of  an  investment  project.1  A  comprehensive\napproach  to  the  environmental  problems  faced  in  the  coastal  areas  and  the  utilization  of\nresources in the coastal areas was developed through a series of project design workshops, in\nwhich  a  wide  section  of  the  stakeholders  participated.  The  Government  reconfirmed  the  high\npriority  attached  to  this  Project  during  the  Bank\u2019s  1999  Country  Programming  Mission.  The\nproject  objectives,  scope,  costs,  and  implementation  arrangements  were  confirmed  with  the\nGovernment  during  the  Fact-Finding  and  Appraisal  Missions2  in  19  April-7  May  1999  and\n14 June\u20132 July 1999, respectively. The project framework is attached as Appendix 1.\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND3\n\nA.\n\nCoastal Resources Sector\n\n1.\n\nEconomic Importance\n\n3.\nIn  this  island  nation,  the  1,770-kilometer  (km)  long  coastline  is  a  critical  lifeline  that\nanchors the country's social, economic, and environmental development. The coastal zone is a\nhighly  productive  ecosystem  that  serves  as  an  important  base  for  the  country's  growth.  The\nnatural  ecosystems  within  the  coastal  zone  are  diverse,  and  include  lagoons  and  estuaries,\ncoral  reefs,  mangrove  swamps,  sea  grass  beds,  other  wetlands,  and  dune  systems.  Coastal\nhabitats play an important role in the daily lives of the people  in  terms  of  livelihood, economic\noutput, and food production. The coastal zone holds approximately 24 percent of the country's\nland area and is home to about 32 percent of the country's population. The settlement of human\npopulations along the coast has occurred largely because this narrow zone is the area closest\nto  many  important  resources,  including  food  stocks  and  raw  materials  for  construction.  The\ncoastal zone has 65 percent of the island\u2019s urban areas, and accounts for nearly 80 percent of\nthe  country\u2019s  annual  fish  production  and  70  percent  of  its  total  industrial  output.  Marine  fish\nproduction peaked in 1994 and has been fluctuating between 150,000 and 157,000 tons since\nthen. With the exception of a few fish stocks, the harvest in the country's coastal waters appears\nto have reached the optimum level, and some stocks already manifest signs of overexploitation.\n\n4.\nThe coastal zone hosts nearly 50 percent of the country's tourist facilities. The hotels in\ncoastal resorts, excluding the Colombo area, have almost  10,000  rooms.  Major  roads and  rail\n\n                                                       \n1\n2 \n\nTA 3034-SRI: Coastal Resource Management Project, for $850,000, approved on 25 June 1998.\nThe  Appraisal  Mission  comprised  C.R.  Rajendran,  Mission  Leader  and  Senior  Project  Specialist;  P.  Safran,\nProject Specialist; D. Utami, Economist, Environment; V.S. Rekha,  Counsel;  and  D.  Parker  and  C.  Stere,  Staff\nConsultants.\n\n3  CER: SRI 98029: Country Economic Review, Sri Lanka, December 1998.\n\n\f2\n\ntransport infrastructure are likewise located along the coastal stretch, together with the country's\ncommercial ports and fishery harbors and anchorages. Some of the richest areas of biodiversity\nin  the  country  occur  in  the  coastal  zone  and  include  coral  reefs,  extensive  sea  grass  beds,\nmangrove  forests,  highly  productive  estuaries  and  lagoons,  and  sanctuaries  that  altogether\ncover  an  area  of  160,000  hectares  (ha).  Moreover,  substantial  reserves  of  valuable  minerals;\nnearly  100  sites  of  special  historical,  archaeological,  cultural,  or  religious  significance;  and\nplaces of special scenic or recreational importance are found in the coastal zone.\n\n2. \n\nDevelopment Issues\n\n5.\nThe  coastal  zone,  which  is  extremely  valuable  to  the  country's  economy,  is  also  very\nfragile.  Beaches  and  coastal  stretches  are  continuously  subjected  to  wave  action  and\nincreasingly threatened by natural processes like storm surges that cause erosion or accretion.\nSand  mining  for  construction,  reef  breaking  for  coral  mining,  reef  dynamiting  for  fish,  and\nremoval  of  coastal  vegetation  exacerbate  the  problem.  The  end  result  is  increasing  coastal\nerosion  and  the  consequent  loss  of  usable  land  and  associated  infrastructure,  houses,  and\narchaeological  and  religious  sites,  all  accompanied  by  social  and  economic  losses.  The\nunmanaged  growth  of  the  tourism  industry  has  resulted  in  the  incorrect  siting  of  facilities.\nIncreased  shoreline  protection  works,  undertaken  as  emergency  measures  or  in  an  ad  hoc\nmanner by the property owners have limited the access of fishermen to beaches to berth boats\nand  kept  out  local  residents  seeking  recreational  opportunities.  Increased  encroachment  of\ncoastal  pollution  or  unplanned  and  unauthorized  development  has  caused  direct  habitat  loss\nand  increased  public  health  risks  due  to  inadequate  infrastructure  for  sanitary  sewerage  and\npotable water.\n\n6.\nGovernment estimates in 1981/82 placed the rate of land loss through coastal erosion at\n200,000-300,000 square meters a year in the 685 km long western, southwestern, and southern\ncoastal  sectors.  Similar  figures  were  reached  in  later  Government  estimates  in  1993.  The\nGovernment, with Bank assistance, prepared a status report on coastal erosion in the southwest\nand west coast of Sri Lanka in September 1998. The report concluded that the coastal erosion\nrates will (i) show significant increases in areas with high littoral drift as a result of the decline in\nthe sand supply from rivers to the nearshore areas characterized by long sandy beaches, as in\nthe coast north of Maggona Headland; (ii) increase further in areas with limited net littoral drift\ndue to an increase in relative sea level rise and the effects of coral mining, such as in the coast\nbetween  Maggona  Headland  and  Galle;  and  (iii)  increase  in  coastal  stretches  that  are  so  far\nconsidered relatively stable, such as the coast between Bentota and Ambalangoda. The threat\nto  vital  infrastructure  like  roads  and  railway  track  has  increased,  and  precautionary  measures\nhave been taken in places where the need is urgent. The present emergency-type solutions that\nhave  been  adopted  are  not  suitable  as  erosion  is  merely  transferred  to  adjacent  areas  thus\nrequiring the construction of more temporary revetments that affect the access of fisherfolk and\ntourists to the sea and need annual repair and maintenance.\n\n7.\nPollution  from  industrial,  agricultural,  and  domestic  sources  has  degraded  the  coastal\nhabitats and threatens the sustainability of the nearshore coastal fisheries. Among the estuaries\nand lagoons spread along the coastline, the major ones that contribute significantly to fisheries\nresources are the Puttalam Lagoon,  Negombo Lagoon,  Bolgoda-Panadura  Estuary, Batticaloa\nLagoon,  and  Jaffna  Lagoon.  Lagoons  and  estuaries  are  threatened  by  pollution  and  siltation,\nexacerbated in some cases by  water diversions that  reduce natural flows.  Pollution  can  result\nwhen lagoons are used as harbors (e.g., in Negombo and Chilaw), or disposal sites for sewage\n(e.g.,  in  Kelani  Estuary,  Negombo  and  Lunawa  lagoons),  or  when  they  receive  industrial\neffluents  (e.g.,  in  Lunawa  and  Negombo  lagoons).  A  number  of  lagoons  are  being  severely\naffected by encroachment and land reclamation, which contributes to a direct loss of functional\nlagoon  area  (e.g.,  in  Chilaw,  Negombo,  and  Mawella  lagoons).  Cumulative  damage  to\n\n\f3\n\nmangroves has resulted from overutilization of the resource and transformation of large areas to\nother  uses  such  as  shrimp  pond  aquaculture  and  lowland  agriculture.  Salt  marsh  areas  have\nalso  been  destroyed  by  conversions  to  alternative  uses,  including  salt  farming  (e.g.,  at\nHambantota and Palavi), shrimp aquaculture, or reclamation (e.g., Muthurajawela Marsh).\n\nCoral reefs continue to be damaged as a result of the activities of divers collecting fish\n8.\nfor  the  ornamental  fish  export  trade  and  overuse  of  the  coral  reef  area  by  tourists  and  boat\noperators, even in marine protected areas. Due to destructive fishing practices and the adverse\nenvironmental  impact  of  siltation  and  pollution,  only  two  (Kandakuliya  and  Talawila)  of  some\neight  coral  reef  areas  studied  in  the  Coastal  Resources  Management  Project  funded  by  the\nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  showed  live  coral  coverage\ngreater  than  50  percent.  Two  nearshore  reefs,  Weligama  and  Polhena,  showed  a  significant\nproportion of dead corals, while at Hikkaduwa and Akurala, about 25 percent dead corals were\nreported. The use of \"moxy\" nets for collection of ornamental fish for export has destroyed coral\nreefs and reduced the stocks of fish and shellfish utilizing the reefs for their habitat.\n\nEstimates  indicate  that  the  existing  fishery  harbors  can  accommodate  about  1,450\n9.\ninboard engine  (IBE)  boats, and  while  the  capacity may  increase  when  the  additional  harbors\nbeing planned by the Government in Colombo, Galle, and Tangalle are completed, it may not be\nsufficient,  especially  if  the  expected  future  increase  in  fleet  size  and  composition  of  the  boat\npopulation  is  taken  into  account.  Even  though  several  fishing  harbors  and  landing  sites  have\nbeen  constructed/rehabilitated  or  are  under  construction,  the  need  for  harbor  facilities  is  still\nurgent  because  most  of  the  existing  fish  harbors  and  almost  all  beach  landing  sites  in  the\ncountry have poor or substandard infrastructure facilities that do not allow good handling of the\nlanded  catch.  Facilities  such  as  auction  sheds  with  adequate  freshwater  supply,  toilets,  and\nother basic amenities either are not available or are in poor condition. Unloading and handling\nmethods  are  very  unsatisfactory.  Lack  of  knowledge  of  proper  handling  and  postharvest\npractices has led to the poor quality of fish products and has serious implications for the export\ntrade. Therefore, another key area that needs close attention is the upgrading of infrastructure\nfacilities to conform to health and hygiene standards set by the European Union, to encourage\nfish export from the project area.\n\n3.\n\nInstitutional Framework for Coastal Resource Management\n\n10.\nThe overall responsibility for fisheries and coastal resource management in Sri Lanka is\nvested in the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development (MFARD). MFARD has\ntwo  main  departments:  the  Coast  Conservation  Department  (CCD)  and  the  Department  of\nFisheries  and  Aquatic  Resources  (DFAR).  The  ministry  has  functions  related  to  all  fishery\nmatters,  including  administration,  policy  making,  management,  development,  research,  and\nmonitoring and evaluation.  CCD  is  the  agency  mandated  to  exercise  overall  responsibility  for\nactivities within the coastal zone; it derives its responsibilities from the Coast Conservation Act\n(CCA) of 1993. CCD is organized into three operational divisions: (i) Planning,  Research, and\nDesign Division; (ii) Works Division; and (iii) Coastal Resources Management Division. DFAR is\nthe  largest of  MFARD's functional organizations  and  is  the  main  implementing agency for  the\nadministration,  development,  regulation,  and  monitoring  of  fisheries  and  living  aquatic\nresources. It is also responsible for extension and other technical and welfare services to fishing\ncommunities.  DFAR  is  charged  with  the  administration  and  enforcement  of  the  Fisheries  and\nAquatic  Resources  Act  of  1991  (or  the  Fisheries  Act).  The  National  Aquatic  Resources\nResearch  and  Development  Agency  (NARA),  the  research  arm  of  MFARD,  was  established\nunder  NARA  Act  No.  54  of  1981.  The  Ceylon  Fishery  Harbours  Corporation  (CFHC),\nestablished  in  1972  under  the  State  Industrial  Corporations  Act  of  1957,  is  under  the\nsupervision  of  MFARD.  CFHC  is  charged  with  responsibility  for  construction,  operation,  and\n\n\f4\n\nmanagement  of fishery harbors and  related facilities.  It  is  now  in  charge of  the  operation  and\nmaintenance (O&M) of seven fishery harbors and 22 anchorages.\n\n11.\nMFARD has clear goals and its departments have elaborated their own strategic plans.\nThe Government\u2019s goal is to ensure sustainable growth in the fishery sector through  resource\nmanagement, modernization, upgrading of technology, and export promotion. As CCD is under\nMFARD, there is adequate  coordination between the  regulatory and development functions  in\ncoastal  resources  management.  The  overall  capacity  to  identify  objectives  and  to  develop\nprograms  is  hindered  mainly  by  inadequate  trained  staff  at  middle  level,  and  weak\nimplementation capacities. The Works Division of CCD undertakes most of the physical works\nfor erosion protection. Part of the works are  contracted  to  private  contractors and  part  carried\nout by CCD staff. This takes up a considerable amount of time and effort. Except for the need to\nhave the capacity to deal with emergencies, the entire physical works can be undertaken by the\nprivate  sector.  Implementation  of  the  Fisheries  Act  by  DFAR  remains  weak.  The  department\nneeds  to  strengthen  its  technical  expertise  and  strengthen  coordination  with  other  offices  at\nboth province and district levels.\n\n12.\nTo ensure close interagency coordination in coastal resource management  (CRM),  the\nCCA provided for the setting up of a Coast Conservation Advisory Council (CCAC) composed\nof representatives of all Government ministries and agencies whose mandates converge on the\nwork to be carried out by CCD. Provision was also made for one representative each from the\nuniversities, a private  voluntary organization  concerned  with  the  coastal environment,  and  the\nfishing industry. While CCAC has provision for stakeholder representation, it has not functioned\nin an advisory capacity on policy issues. Instead its meetings have only focused on the approval\nor disapproval of applications for permits for buildings and other structures along the coast. The\nGovernment  has  agreed  to  reconstitute  CCAC  to  enable  the  council  to  provide  policy-level\ninputs, and to better reflect stakeholder consensus in policy making.\n\n4.\n\nPoverty Issues\n\n13.\nAlthough Sri Lanka has strong social indicators compared with other countries in South\nAsia,  approximately  21  percent  of  the  population  still  live  in  poverty.  Despite  the  high  priority\nthat  the  Government  has  attached  to  poverty  reduction  in  recent  years,  the  number  of  poor\npeople  has  not  declined  significantly  in  the  1990s.  The  recent  socioeconomic  survey  by  the\nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka showed that total poverty in the country declined from 27 percent in\n1985-1986  to  22  percent  in  1990-1991  and  to  21  percent  in  1997-1998.  Rapid  social\nassessment  (RSA)  was  undertaken  for  the  Project  using  the  poverty  line  adopted  under  the\nSamurdhi4 program  of  the  Government,  under  which  beneficiaries  who  received  an  income\ntransfer  of  SLRs500\u20131,000  per  month  were  considered  as  living  below  the  poverty  line.  An\nindependent  analysis  also  assessed  the  impact of  the  Project  on  poverty  reduction.5  The  two\nestimates show that poverty varies between 20-32 percent as per the RSA, and 20-29 percent\nas  per  the  independent  analysis  in  the  project  area.  The  main  causes  of  poverty  in  the  rural\nareas  are  underemployment  and  low-productivity  occupations.  The  rural  poor  also  are\ncharacterized by lower levels of education and a higher percentage of income spent on food.\n\n14.\nMany  studies  carried  out  in  fishing  communities  have  shown  that  the  majority  of  the\nfisher families fall into the poorest category of the population. Some overarching characteristics\nof poverty prevail in fisher communities. The primary dependence of fisher families on a rapidly\n                                                       \n4  Samurdhi  is  a  national  program  for  poverty  alleviation  introduced  in  1994.  It  focuses  mainly  on  creating\nemployment  and  promoting  income-generating  activities.  Several  distinct  activities  are  undertaken  under\nSamurdhi.  The  Poor  Relief  Programme  and  Social  Security  Programme  provide  direct  relief  to  the  poorest\nsections.\nThis analysis was made by Marga Institute in Colombo at the request of the Bank in July 1999.\n\n5\n\n\f5\n\ndepleting resource is one of the  major  causes  of  deprivation.  The  scarcity of opportunities for\nadditional  income  generation,  the  nature  of  the  habitat,  poor  housing,  and  lack  of  access  to\nbasic  amenities  typify  deprivation  in  fishing  communities  in  general.  The  seasonal  nature  of\ntheir  main or  sole  activity  to generate  income  creates  a  situation  where  even  if  incomes  from\nfishing  are  reasonably  high,  fisherfolk  are  unable  to  spread  that  income  into  the  no-fishing\nseason.  The  women\u2019s  lack  of  skills,  education  and  training,  and  opportunities  for  earning  an\nincome  renders  the  families  highly  vulnerable  in  the  event  of  death  or  disability  of  the  male.\nTheir potential for saving is very low and therefore they have little prospect of investing in other\nincome-generating activities.\n\n15.\nPoverty in the coastal areas and its close nexus with the increasing pressure on coastal\nresources are recognized by the Government. The inability of the resource base to regenerate\nitself under the heavy pressure of exploitation sets up a resource depletion-poverty cycle, which\nfurther exacerbates the situation.  The problem  is particularly  acute  in  areas  where  coral  reefs\nare  mined  and  mangrove  areas  converted,  through  landfill  and  encroachments,  for  shrimp\naquaculture  and  lowland  agriculture.  The  Government  is  well  aware  of  the  importance  of  job\ncreation  to  address  the  problem  of  poverty.  Significant  efforts  in  the  recent  past  (like  the\nSamurdhi program) have focused on the importance of rural livelihood development programs.\nThese  programs  have  been  complemented  by  skills  development  with  extension  and  credit\nsupport,  and  development  of  infrastructure  and  marketing  support.  The  Government  is  also\nformulating a policy framework for poverty reduction in the country.\n\n16.\nAccess to credit is more of an issue than is availability of credit to the poor in the coastal\nareas. The National Development Bank provides refinancing to a variety of activities undertaken\nby commercial banks and rural development banks. The SANASA Development Bank, through\nits  8,400  village-level  activities,  is  also  well  placed  to  extend  credit,  as  is  the  Sarvodaya\nEconomic  Enterprises  Development  Services  (SEEDS),  another  nongovernment  organization\n(NGO), which has the institutional network to  provide  credit  support  to  livelihood development\nprograms.  Between  the  two,  about  SLRs145  million  had  been  extended  as  loans  for\nmicroenterprise type of activities  by  the end  of 1997.  In  addition,  cooperative  rural  banks  had\nprovided about SLRs152 million as credit for such purposes till the end of 1997. Different state-\nfunded programs such as Surathura Program and Samurdhi Development Credit Scheme also\nprovide small loans to encourage income-generating activities.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n1.\n\nStrategic Framework\n\nThe  Government's  coastal  zone  management  policy  is  embodied  in  the Coastal  Zone\n17.\nManagement Plan (CZMP) 1997 and Coastal 2000 - A Resource Management Strategy for Sri\nLanka's  Coastal  Region. The  latter  document,  based  on  20  special  studies  commissioned  by\nthe  Government,  provides  the  direction  for  future  strategic  interventions  in  coastal  zone\nmanagement  based on the achievements  and  shortcomings of  the first decade of  work  in  the\nsector.  Current \nthe  National  Fisheries\nDevelopment Plan, 1995-2000 and in the six-year Fisheries Development Program, 1999-2004\ncomplement the policies and strategies contained in the CZMP and in Coastal 2000, with their\nstrong  emphasis  on  poverty  reduction,  coast  conservation,  and  environmental  protection.\nMFARD  particularly  intends  to  assist  the  small-scale  fisherfolk  through  skills  upgrading,\nimplementation of welfare schemes, and encouraging cottage industries as alternative sources\nof livelihood. In addition, administrative reforms in MFARD have also been identified.\n\nfisheries  policies  and  strategies  contained \n\nin \n\n18.\nThe  Government  is  very  much  conscious  of  the  extent  to  which  its  poverty  reduction\nefforts  are  linked  with  the  problems  faced  in  the  management  of  coastal  resources.  The\n\n\f6\n\ntaken \n\ninclude \n\nGovernment  recognizes  the  need  for  a  more  integrated  approach  to  CRM  and  the  long-term\nthe  special  area\nimpact  of  environmental  degradation.  Specific  efforts \nmanagement (SAM) planning approach to protect wetlands and lagoons. Actual implementation\nof  SAM  plans  has  been  constrained  by  lack  of  investment,  but  the  Rekawa  development\nprogram  has  shown  promise.  The  policy  objectives  of  MFARD  in  its  Fisheries  Development\nProgram  1999-2004  are  to  improve  national  nutrition  and  food  security  through  increased\nfishing,  increase  employment  opportunities,  uplift  the  socioeconomic  status  of  fisherfolk\nincluding  women,  increase  export  earnings  from  the  industry,  and  improve  the  skills  of  the\nfishing community. To operationalize these objectives, programs for skills upgrading, extension\nand  credit,  and  strengthening  fisheries  cooperatives  including  capacities  to  improve  savings\nmobilization  will  be  undertaken,  combined  with  targeted  welfare  schemes.  The  progress  of\nMFARD\u2019s  efforts  can  be  considered  satisfactory  on  the  whole.  However,  MFARD  needs  to\nundertake  greater  resource  conservation  efforts;  its  emphasis  has  so  far  been  on  income\ngeneration and increase in production. Environmental degradation should be addressed at the\nsame time by educating and involving the communities through information dissemination.\n\n2.\n\nLegal Framework\n\n19.\nCRM  was  formally  established  in  Sri  Lanka  with  the  enactment  of  the  Coast\nConservation Act  (CCA)  (Act  No. 57) of 1981.  It  went into effect  on  1  October  1983,  but  was\nsubsequently amended in 1988. The Act defined the coastal zone, mandated CCD to undertake\nresearch to describe the existing condition of the coastal zone, and called for the preparation of\na CZMP to provide the framework for the regulation and control of development activities within\nthe  coastal  zone.  It  also  directed  the  establishment  of  the  CCAC  with  various  advisory  and\nreview  responsibilities  for  matters  relating  to  coastal  zone  activities,  and  gave  the  director  of\nCCD  the  responsibility  for  administering  the  provisions  of  the  Act,  formulating  and  executing\ncoastal conservation schemes, and conducting research for coastal conservation. The CCA has\nadopted  the  issuance  of  permits  as  the  principal  mechanism  for  regulating  a  wide  range  of\ndevelopment  activities  within  the  coastal  zone.  Permits  are  to  be  issued  only  for  specific\nactivities with no demonstrable adverse effects on the stability, productivity, and environmental\nquality of the coastal zone. The amendment to the CCA in 1988 authorized the director of CCD\nto  delegate  powers,  duties,  and  functions  to  Government  agents  or  public  officers  of  coastal\nadministrative  districts;  banned  various  coral  mining  activities;  authorized  enforcement  actions\nto be taken  against boats engaged  in  illegal  activities;  and granted  the  public free  use  of  and\naccess  to  all beaches  in  the  country.  After  the  approval  of  Coastal  2000  by  the  Government,\nMFARD  began the process of drafting urgently required amendments to the CCA to provide the\nlegal basis for the implementation of the policies and strategies recommended in Coastal 2000.\nCabinet approval for the proposed amendments has already been accorded.\n\nThe prevailing Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act No. 2 of 1996 (hereinafter referred\n20.\nto  as  the  Fisheries  Act)  went  into  operation  on  11  January  1996  and  replaced  Fisheries\nOrdinance  No.  24  of  1940, which  was  repealed  in  1996.    The  Fisheries  Act simplifies  and\nextends the purposes enunciated in the 1940 Ordinance, and was brought in to \"provide for the\nmanagement, regulation, conservation, and development of fisheries and aquatic resources  in\nSri Lanka.\" Cabinet approval for the proposed amendments has already been accorded.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\nDevelopment  efforts  in  the  coastal  resources  sector  have  been  supported,  to  a  large\n21.\nextent,  by  assistance  provided  by  various  multilateral  and  bilateral  funding  agencies.  The\nmultilateral  funding  agencies  include  the  Bank,  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the\nUnited Nations (UN/FAO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the World\nBank.  The  bilateral  funding  agencies  include  the  Abu  Dhabi  Fund,  Canadian  International\n\n\f7\n\nDevelopment  Agency  (CIDA),  Danish  International  Development  Assistance  (DANIDA),\nEuropean  Union  (EU),  German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation  (GTZ),  Japan  Bank  for\nInternational  Corporation  (JBIC),  through  its  official  development  assistance  window,  Japan\nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA), Korean International Cooperation Agency, Norwegian\nAgency  for  Development  (NORAD),  British  Overseas  Development  Agency  (ODA),  Swedish\nInternational  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (Sida),  United  States  Agency  for  International\nDevelopment (USAID), and Government of the Netherlands among others.\n\n22.\nExternal assistance to the sector has been in the form of loans, TA grants, and regional\ncooperation  projects.  This  assistance  has  been  heavily  biased,  however,  toward  the  fisheries\nsubsector. The emphasis has  been on  increasing  fish  production  and  improving the  quality  of\nfish. In more recent projects, greater attention is being paid to conservation and environmental\nprotection.  The  achievements  in  the  sector  with  respect  to  increased  production  and  policy\nchanges have  been assisted by external assistance  to  a  large  extent.  Coastal  protection  and\nenvironment   projects have been  supported  mainly  by  TAs from  bilateral  agencies.  The  Bank\nhas extended four loans since 1972 to this sector.6 In addition, the Kirinda fisheries harbor has\nbeen financed by the Japanese Government. A list of major externally assisted project and TA\ngrants from 1990 is given in Appendix 2.\n\n23.\nThe Bank is also providing $2.86 million for a regional TA project for the Improvement of\nthe Database for Fisheries Management. This TA  is  implemented by  the  International  Council\nfor Living Aquatic Resources Management and participated in by eight countries: Bangladesh,\nIndia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The Project, which\nwill be implemented in 1998-2002, aims to (i) develop a fishery resource information system, (ii)\ndevelop strategies and action plans, and (iii) strengthen the capacity of fisheries institutions of\nthe participating countries.\n\n24.\nFAO  has  implemented  a  major  regional  cooperation  project  in  coastal  fisheries  called\nthe Bay of Bengal Programme, which has played a catalytic and consultative role in developing\ncoastal  fisheries  management  in  the  Bay  of  Bengal  to  help  improve  the  conditions  of  small-\nscale fisherfolk  communities.  The  program,  which  was  initially  entitled  Development  of  Small-\nscale Fisheries in the Bay of Bengal, started in January 1979 and initially covered Bangladesh,\nIndia,  Malaysia,  Sri  Lanka,  and  Thailand.  It  was  later  expanded  to  cover  Indonesia  and  the\nMaldives.  Funding support came mainly from the governments of Denmark, Japan, and United\nKingdom,  and  the  International  Maritime  Organization  of  the  United  Nations.  Several  TA\nprojects have been, and are still being, funded and implemented under this program.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n25.\nThe  four  previous  Bank  loan-funded  fisheries  projects  in  Sri  Lanka  were  mainly\ndevelopment-oriented and focused on the utilization of fisheries resources for direct extractive\npurposes  rather  than  on  sustainable  resource  management.  The  projects  had  increased  fish\nproduction as a  primary goal, and  comprised  interventions  meant  to  improve  the  efficiency  of\nfishing  operations  through  the  introduction  of  new  and  advanced technologies  in  fish  capture,\nculture,  postharvest  handling,  and  processing.  The  overall  result  was  a  shift  from  the  use  of\ntraditional  fishing  methods  to  the  adoption  of  new  and  modern  techniques  in  fish  production,\nprocessing, and marketing.\n\n                                                       \n6 \n\nThe  following  projects  in  the  fisheries  sector  have  been  approved:  (i)  Loan  115-SRI:  Fisheries Development\nProject,  for  $3.1  million,  approved  on  14  December  1972;  (ii)  Loan  520-SRI:  Second Fisheries Development\nProject, for $13.5 million, approved on 20 August 1981; (iii) Loan 648-SRI: Aquaculture Development Project, for\n$17.27  million,  approved  on  3  November  1983;  and  (iv)  Loan  1201-SRI:  Fisheries Sector Project,  for  $26.0\nmillion, approved on 1 December 1992.\n\n\f8\n\n26.\nThere  are  lessons  to  be  drawn  from  the  implementation  of  the  earlier  Bank-funded\nfisheries  projects,  which  have  been  rated  as  \u201cpartially  successful.\u201d  The  evaluation  of  the\nFisheries  Development  Project  concluded,  among  others,  that  there  is  a  need  for  full\nconsultations  with  local  fisherfolk  and  for  a  realistic  assessment  of  their  financial  and\nmanagerial capabilities to undertake major programs. The performance audit of the Fisheries II\nProject  echoed  this  recommendation,  noting  the  desirability  of  consultations  with  the  target\nbeneficiaries during  project  design.  It  also  suggested  the  merits  of having a  certain  degree of\nflexibility  in  project  design  so  that  necessary  changes  could  be  implemented  rapidly.  The\nproblems encountered during the implementation of these projects demonstrated the  need for\neffective project management, including day-to-day supervision by a project manager and close\nmonitoring by  the  Bank.  Particularly  encouraging  is  the  implementation  performance  so  far  in\nthe ongoing Fisheries Sector Project. Compared with past projects and despite some problems\nduring  initial  implementation,  mainly  due  to  poor  technical  input  and  lack  of  qualified  staff  to\nmanage the Project, MFARD has become familiar with the Bank\u2019s procedures and requirements\nfor project implementation.\n\nOnly the most recent loan-funded project, the Fisheries Sector Project (footnote 6), has\n27.\nbeen  implemented  with  the  aim  of  reducing  pressure  on  coastal  fisheries  resources  by\nencouraging  offshore  fishing  and  increasing  the  income  of  coastal  fisherfolk  through  the\nprovision of alternative livelihood opportunities. Fish landing facilities at three harbors (Mirissa,\nPurunawella,  and  Beruwela)  in  the  priority  areas  have  been  improved,  and  credit  has  been\nprovided to local fishing communities. Improved fish handling, storage, and marketing facilities\nhave  enhanced  the  quality  of  fish  and  increased  fishers'  income.  The  local-community-\nparticipation approach for harbor facilities management has also demonstrated its effectiveness\nin improving fish landings and handling as well as the financial sustainability of the rehabilitated\nharbors, with user fees now being levied.\n\n28.\nGiven the present status of the country\u2019s fisheries resources, particularly in the coastal\nareas, it is imperative that the planning and design of future interventions in the sector should\ntake note of the need for sustainable management of the country\u2019s fisheries resources. Rather\nthan promote only increased production, future projects should carefully evaluate the resource\nstatus  and,  based  on  the  results  of  the  assessment,  adopt  a  resource  management  and/or\nrehabilitation strategy that would ensure the sustainability of the coastal and marine resources.\n\n29.\nOther lessons to note are incorporated in a Bank study of 27 completed Bank-assisted\nfisheries  projects  as  of  30  June  1998.7  The  main  recommendations  pertain  to  the  need  for\npromoting integrated CRM to prevent resource depletion and for a holistic approach to project\ndesign.  Greater  supervisory  inputs  from  the  Bank  for  projects  involving  new  technologies  are\nrequired during the initial years of implementation  so as  to  (i)  identify  emerging  problems  at  a\nmuch earlier stage, and (ii) react with appropriate assistance in a more timely manner. Similarly\nthe institutional capability of the executing agency (EA) should be carefully assessed to ensure\nthat it could effectively carry out its responsibilities. If necessary, strengthening of  the EA  staff\nprior to loan approval or during implementation may be considered. It was  also  recommended\nthat governments should focus on the provision of a suitable policy, institutional, and regulatory\nframework and support services including research, training, and extension.\n\n30.\nThe ongoing and past external sources of assistance  provide  tested approaches  to be\nadopted  by  the  Bank  under  the  Project.  The  TA  grants  given  by  DANIDA  and  GTZ  have\nprovided well-tested approaches to implement and to monitor the beach nourishment technique\nas well as other techniques to minimize and localize the coastal erosion. The USAID TA grant\n\n                                                       \n7  Operations  Evaluation  Office.  1998.  Sector  Synthesis  of  Evaluation  Findings  in  the  Fisheries  Sector.  Asian\n\nDevelopment Bank, Manila.\n\n\f9\n\non  CRM  provided  a  ready-to-use  model  on  community  participation  for  sustainable  use  of\ncoastal  resources.  An  evaluation  of  the  implementation  of  SAM  approaches  developed  by\nUSAID  for  coastal  environment  and  resource  management  in  Rekawa  and  Hikkaduwa  was\ncarried  out  by  the  World  Conservation  Union  (IUCN)  in  1997.  The  result  showed  that  in\nadopting  this  approach  the  successful  factors  are  (i)  active  participation  of  the  local\ncommunities, (ii) effective liaison between government officials from the district secretariat and\nCCD, and (iii) display of a clear priority issue as well as targets and goals to be achieved. The\nproposed Project has been designed, taking the above lessons into account.\n\nE.\n\nThe Bank's Sector Strategy\n\nThe  Bank\u2019s  recently  approved  Country  Operational  Strategy  for  Sri  Lanka8  identifies\n31.\nnatural resource management as one of the main elements of the Bank's strategy for Sri Lanka.\nThe other elements of the strategy are (i) policy and institutional reform at the national level, (ii)\nhuman  resource  development,  (iii)  expansion  of  infrastructure,  and  (iv)  social  dimensions. In\nline  with  this  strategy,  Bank  operations  in  the  natural  resources  sector  of  Sri  Lanka  are\nexpected to focus on three areas:  (i) forestry and  biodiversity  conservation and  management,\n(ii)  comprehensive  water  resource  management,  and  (iii)  assistance  in  coastal  resource\nmanagement. The expanded focus on natural resource management, which entails the location\nof projects in rural and coastal areas, is expected to have a beneficial  impact  on employment\nand the income levels of the population in marginal communities, while addressing some of the\nnegative externalities and social impacts associated with structural transformation.\n\n32.\nIn the coastal and marine resources subsector, Bank assistance is expected to address\nissues  such  as  marine  resources  depletion,  coastal  erosion,  and  deterioration  of  coastal\nhabitats  through  an  integrated  approach  based  on  rehabilitation  of  coastal  habitats  and\nbeaches, reduction of erosion-prone areas, improvement of fish breeding habitats and fisheries\nmanagement,  income-generating  opportunities  for  impoverished  coastal  populations,  and\nstrengthening of sector institutions.\n\nThe Bank\u2019s  Policy  on  Fisheries9  provides  for  assistance  to  promote  integrated  coastal\n33.\nfisheries management. The emphasis is on meeting the twin objectives of reducing destructive\nfishing practices and pollution, which reduce the productivity of the resource, while encouraging\nmeasures to improve coastal fishing, which will contribute to the economic development of the\ncoastal  communities.  Efforts  will  be  made  to  introduce  effective  policies  and  enforcement\ncapacity  to  prevent  destructive  fishing  practices,  and  destruction  of  habitats,  especially\nmangroves;  and  to  eliminate  coral  mining  and  trading  of  coral-based  products.  The  private\nsector will be encouraged to play a larger role in fisheries while governments will principally be\nresponsible  for  establishing  the  policy,  institutional,  and  regulatory  framework  to  support  the\nsustainable  management  of  fisheries  resources.  The  Bank's  environmental  guidelines  will  be\napplied  rigorously  in  developing  and  implementing  projects  in  the  fisheries  sector,  and  a\nparticipatory process will be followed in formulating projects.\n\n34.\nThe widespread poverty among artisanal fishers and fisherfolk communities, overfished\nresources,  and  increasing  degradation  of  fishing  grounds,  especially  in  nearshore  coastal\nareas,  are  key  areas  for  Bank  support.  Poverty  reduction  is  a  priority  concern,  particularly\nbecause  poverty  contributes  to  resource  degradation.  And  as  reducing  the  dependence  of\ncommunities  on  fisheries  resources  for  food  and  livelihood  is  key  to  sustainable  resource\nmanagement,  the  exit  of  marginal  fishers  from  coastal  fishing  needs  to  be  encouraged.  Non-\n\n                                                       \n8  Country Operational Strategy for Sri Lanka: Promoting the Environment for Growth,  circulated to the  Board on\n\n23 March 1999.\n\n9  The Bank\u2019s Policy on Fisheries dated October 1997.\n\n\f10\n\nfishing employment alternatives may be provided through investments in human capital through\nskills training and promotion of alternative livelihood programs. These need to target the entire\nfishing  household,  women  included,  as  increasing  their  contribution  to  household  income  will\ncomplement efforts to reduce dependence on the fisheries resources.\n\nThe  stronger  participation  of  stakeholders  in  resolving  issues  of  access,  allocation  of\n35.\nuser rights, and monitoring and enforcement will be a concern for Bank assistance. The  Bank\nwill  encourage  the  Government  to  involve  local  government  units  and  fishing  communities  in\nfisheries management as an integral component of national policy. The Bank will also support\nthe  strengthening  of  the  management  capabilities  of  fishing  communities  through  community\norganization  and  participation,  training,  and  other  forms  of  assistance,  including  the  active\ninvolvement of NGOs in areas where they have a comparative advantage.\n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n36.\nThe Bank has been able to target specific policy changes to improve the management of\nnatural  resources  in  Sri  Lanka  through  its  past  loan  and  TA  operations.  The  changes  have\ngenerally  been  restricted  to  the  specific  subsectors  such  as  forests,  water,  and  fisheries  to\nwhich  Bank  assistance  has  been  extended.  The  Bank  is  in  the  process  of  encouraging  the\nGovernment  to  adopt  a  more  comprehensive  approach  to  the  management  of  all  natural\nresources and is expected to extend support for management of the land and marine resources\nin a manner similar to that of the water sector.\n\n37.\nPrivate  sector  development  is  a  strategic  national  priority  and  the  Bank\u2019s  efforts  to\nencourage  private  sector  development  have  the  Government\u2019s  full  support.  However,  while\nfishing is done entirely in the private sector and fishing vessels are owned privately, little private\nsector  investment  can  be  expected  to  establish  landing  facilities  and  marketing  facilities.  The\nprivate  sector  does  not  even  fully  meet  the  demand  for  ice  and  salt.  Hence,  it  has  become\nnecessary for  the  Government,  through  CFHC, to  provide the  necessary  infrastructure  for  the\nfishing  vessels.  Maintenance  of  these  facilities  has  so  far  been  financed  through  the  budget.\nThe following key areas have been the center of the Bank\u2019s policy dialogue in the coastal and\nmarine resources sector.\n\n1.\n\nLegal Environment\n\n38.\nThe  Bank  has  discussed  with  the  Government  the  need  to  enact  a  new  law  that  will\nsupersede the  Coast  Conservation  Act  of  1981 (subsequently amended  in  1988)  to  provide  a\nstronger legal basis for the implementation of the policies and strategies for coastal environment\nand resource management (CERM). The present Act has been able to implement parts of  the\nCZMP,  but  needs  to  be  strengthened  for  better  coordination  and  enforcement.  Further,  it  is\nnecessary  to  address  the  problems  arising  from  overlapping  or  contradictory  statutes,  which\ngive similar powers over the coastal zone to various ministries or authorities, and which have, in\neffect,  caused  the  powers,  functions,  and  duties  of  CCD  to  be  eroded  over  the  years.  It  has\nbeen proposed that the existing CCA be  repealed  and a new  law  enacted,  which  will have  all\nthe desired changes including the designation of CCD as the coordinating agency for all matters\nin the coastal zone, grant of additional powers to the director, and reconstitution of the CCAC to\nmake it an effective policy-recommending body to the minister on matters affecting the coastal\nzone. The new Act, which will also resolve the legislative overlaps with other laws, is proposed\nto be called the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Act. It is proposed that\nCCD be renamed the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department. At\nthe request of the Government, Bank assistance was provided under TA 3034-SRI to draft the\nnew Act for easy processing within the Government. Cabinet approval has been accorded to the\nproposed new legislation.\n\n\f11\n\n39.\nTo  strengthen  the  law for  effective  conservation  and  enforcement,  amendments  to  the\nFisheries Act of 1996 are also necessary. The required amendments have been identified; they\ncover eight specific areas relating to CRM: licensing of fishing operations, regulation of foreign\nfishing  boats,  seizure  of  fishing  boats  and  other  materials,  settlement  of  fishing  disputes,\nconservation, flora  and fauna  conservation/protection,  chank fisheries  and pearl fisheries,  and\ncomposition  of  fisheries  management  committees.  The  proposed  amendments  govern  the\nissuance  of  licenses  to  fishing  vessels  and  strict  enforcement  of  resource  conservation\nmeasures. Fisheries whose management was omitted from  the 1996  Act, such as  that for  the\nchank  fishery,  are  proposed  to  be  reincorporated  in  the  amendments.  It  is  proposed  that\nmembership in fisheries management committees in designated fishery management areas be\nexpanded  by  including  representatives  of  fishery  cooperatives  as  well  as  relevant  NGOs.\nLoopholes in the law due to poor wording also need to be closed by clarifying the activities that\nare prohibited. Cabinet approval has been accorded to these amendments.\n\n40.\nIt is expected that all action necessary for submission to the Parliament of the proposed\namendments to both Acts and the subsequent legislative action would be completed as soon as\npossible and not later than one year of loan effectiveness. The Government has also assured\nthat exercise of power by concerned government agencies under the Urban Development Law\nand the Tourism Development Act, which have a bearing on the coastal zone, will be done with\nprior concurrence of CCD.\n\n2.\n\nCost Recovery\n\n41.\nThe extent to which the maintenance of the fishing harbors and anchorages depends on\nthe  Government  budget  for  O&M  is  an  important  factor  to  determine  whether  further\ninvestments in such infrastructure support are sustainable. From recommendations made under\na Bank-funded TA project10 approved in conjunction with the ongoing Fisheries Sector Project, it\nwas noted that the Government has introduced berthing charges as a first step in implementing\ncost-recovery measures (equivalent to about 1 percent of the estimated value of fish landing) in\nfour  selected  ports:  Beruwela,  Galle,  Tangalle, and  Kirinda.11  It  has  already  been  agreed  that\nthis system will be introduced in all the ports financed under the Fisheries Sector Project. The\npresent berthing charges will be increased to  about 2 percent  of  all fish  landings  when all  the\nfacilities to be provided in the harbors are completed. The amount is estimated to be sufficient to\ncover all O&M costs.  Once fish  auctions are established,  it  would also be possible  to  adopt a\nsystem of charges based on actual fish landings rather than on the size of boats as is presently\ndone.  It  has  been  agreed  that  the  process  of  cost  recovery  established  under  the  Fisheries\nSector  Project  would  be  extended  to  the  fishing  harbors  and  anchorages  to  be  established\nunder the proposed Project. It is expected that CFHC, which is expected to maintain the fishery\nharbors, will be able to meet all O&M costs eventually from the collection of berthing charges.\n\nEven  though  there  is  a  high  concentration  of  tourist  facilities  along  the  coast,  the\n42.\ncoastline is treated as public property and is not owned by individuals or hotels. It is difficult to\nisolate specific beneficiaries from the coastline stabilization measures, that can be targeted for\ncost  recovery  of  the  capital  costs.  The  maintenance  costs  for  the  coastline  stabilization\ncomponent  is  also  estimated  to  be  significant  (about  $1.75  million  annually),  making  it\nnecessary  for  the  Government  to  consider  whether  there  is  scope  to  generate  additional\nrevenues to meet these costs. The Government felt that the expenditure was entirely justifiable\nas  a  public good  as the  benefit  of  the  investment  will  be  enjoyed  by  society  as  a  whole,  and\nshould  be  met  from  existing  revenues  under  the  national  budget.  At  the  same  time,  the\n\n                                                       \n10  TA 1795-SRI: Rationalization of Fishery Harbor and Other Charges, for $590,000, approved on 1 December 1992.\n11  Present berthing charges are as follows: (i) inboard engine (IBE) boats: 45'-49',  SLRs1,125; 40'-45', SLRs900; 40', SLRs675;\n\n36', SLRs562.50; 34', SLRs337.50; 28', SLRs220; and (ii) outboard engine (OBE) boats, SLRs112.50.\n\n\f12\n\nGovernment recognizes the need to ensure that the present erosion rates are reduced and the\neconomic value of beaches is preserved. As the potential for tourism would be most vulnerable\nto  beach  erosion,  the  scope  for  revenue  generation  from  the  tourism  industry  could  be\nexamined. There is little potential to collect revenues from other sources. However, it has to be\nrecognized  that  the  tourism  sector  has  only  started  to  show  signs  of  recovery  after  nearly  a\ndecade of recession due to the negative impact of the civil conflict. It is therefore necessary to\nbe  cautious  in  the  introduction  of  additional  levies  and  to  identify  the  mechanisms  only  after\nextensive  discussions  with  industry.  At  the Government\u2019s  request, a  small-scale  TA  has  been\nextended  to  assess  the  potential  and  develop  a  suitable  mechanism  for  the  purpose.12  The\nGovernment  has  agreed  that  action  to  be  taken  will  be  worked  out  by  the  Government  in\nconsultation with the  Bank  and  other stakeholders  within  six  months of the  receipt  of  the final\nreport of the TA.\n\n3.\n\nSubsidies\n\n43.\nThe  Government  has  an  ongoing  program  of  subsidies  for  new  and  existing  fishing\nvessels, which include boats that fish in the coastal areas and those that fish in offshore waters.\nThese subsidies are extended to a targeted beneficiary group of poor fisherfolk and is intended\nmainly to (i) encourage a shift from coastal to offshore fishing, (ii) encourage adoption of more\nmodern  fishing  practices,  and  (iii)  support  the  installation  of  modern  communication  and\nnavigation equipment to encourage the safety of fishing fleets and fisherfolk. The  Government\nagreed  with  the  Bank,  under  the  ongoing  Fisheries  Sector  Project,  to  review  the  feasibility  of\nreducing and eventually eliminating subsidies to new offshore fishing vessels. While there  has\nbeen an overall reduction  in the  total subsidy amount  paid by the  Government for  all  types  of\nfishing  boats  in  1997  and  1998,  subsidies  still  paid  for  new  fishing  vessels  of  both  types\ncurrently  amount  to  about  SLRs57  million  per  annum  or  about  22  percent  of  the  total  annual\nrecurrent expenditure for MFARD and 3 percent of the ministry\u2019s total annual budget. However,\nthe subsidies are only 0.03 percent of the Government\u2019s total annual recurrent expenditure. The\namount of subsidy  varies according  to  vessel  size  and  the  type  of  equipment  installed. While\nthere  is  no  firm  estimate  of  the  maximum  sustainable  yield  for  Sri  Lanka,  present  catch  data\nindicate  that  further  increases  in  the  number  of  offshore  fishing  boats  do  not  appear  to  be  a\npriority  needing  incentives.  Instead,  it  is  important  to  improve  yields  through  the  reduction  of\npostharvest  losses  and  improvement  of  fish-handling  practices.  The  Government\u2019s  position  is\nthat substantial progress has been made in the past few years in the reduction of subsidies to\nfishing boats in the coastal areas. Subsidies particularly encouraged existing fishing vessels to\ninstall improved facilities, which enable these vessels to take to offshore fishing, thus reducing\nthe pressure on coastal fishing.\n\n44.\nThe Government does acknowledge the need to reduce the pressure on coastal fishing\nto provide for  resource  regeneration.  The Government has,  therefore, agreed  to  progressively\nphase out the subsidies for fishing boats by reducing the subsidies by 15 percent annually for\ncoastal and offshore boats and to restrict the subsidy to only offshore vessels after  2002.  The\nGovernment has also agreed to review with the Bank during the midterm review of the Project\nthe need for continuing the subsidy for offshore vessels. The review will focus on the need for\nincentives  to  be  continued  to  targeted  beneficiaries  for  a  limited  number  of  offshore  fishing\nvessels  to  facilitate  the  adoption  of  new  technology  for  diversified  fishing,  navigation,  and\nimproved preservation of catch.\n\n                                                       \n12  TA  3274-SRI:  Cost Recovery Mechanism Analysis for Coastal Zone Protection,  for  $150,000,  approved  on\n\n13 October 1999.\n\n\f4.\n\nSand Mining\n\n13\n\n45.\nExcessive sand mining and inappropriate location of sand mining operations  contribute\nto  shoreline  erosion  and  beach  retreat  by  cutting  the  sand  supply  to  downdrift  beaches.  The\nsand  mining  problem  is  aggravated  by  the  increased  demand  for  sand  by  the  construction\nindustry in the 1980s. In 1991, phase I of the National Sand Study for Sri Lanka was conducted\nby  the  Central  Environmental  Authority  (CEA),  in  collaboration  with  the  Ministry  of  Foreign\nAffairs of the  Netherlands  to  compile  all  available  information  and  data  on  sand  mining  in  Sri\nLanka. On completion of phase I in 1992, it was found that there was a direct link between the\nerosion sites and sand mining. In 1997, phase II of the project was initiated by CCD and CEA\nwith Government funds to identify alternative sources of sea sand. The study was carried out by\nthe  University  of  Moratuwa.  A  task  force  was  set  up  within  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  and\nEnvironment to recommend steps for implementing the use of the alternatives recommended by\nthe  study,  such  as  dunes  sand,  offshore  sand,  quarry  dust,  and  alternative  construction\npractices.\n\nThe  Government  has  already  banned  the  use  of  coral  reef-based  lime  in  Government\n46.\nconstruction from 1 January 1999 and is mounting an awareness campaign in this regard. River\nsand  mining,  which  is  one  of  the  causes  of  coastal  erosion,  has  also  been  regulated  in  the\ncoastal  zone,  but  upstream  sand  mining  continues  to  be  a  problem.  For  want  of  suitable\nsubstitutes,  and  in  view  of  the  significant  impact  it  will  have  on  the  poorer  segments  of  the\npopulation  involved  in  this  activity,  the  Government  is  looking  at  possible  alternatives.  A  task\nforce appointed by the President's secretariat is in the process of finalizing recommendations for\nits control, but these recommendations are essentially administrative in nature. The alternatives\nsuggested  need  to  be  studied  in  detail.  A  study  to  review  sand  mining  alternatives,  including\ncost recovery options, will be undertaken as part of the proposed Project. The recommendations\nwill be considered by the Ministry of Forestry and Environment separately.\n\n5.\n\nInstitutional Reform\n\n47.\nBecause  of  the  need  to  introduce  institutional  changes  within  MFARD  to  strengthen\nCCD's  position  as  the  central  coordinating  agency  for  CERM  activities,  and  to  give  a  more\nactive  management  role  to  DFAR,  the  Bank  and  the  Government  agreed  that  the  following\nmeasures will be taken:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe CCAC will be reconstituted within one year of loan effectiveness to make it\nan  effective  policy-recommending  body  to  the  minister  of  MFARD  on  matters\naffecting the coastal zone.\n\nThe phasing out of CCD\u2019s physical construction works using private contractors.\nBy  the end of project  implementation  in  2005,  it  will  confine  itself  to  policy  and\nplanning  of  CERM  activities  as  well  as  execution  of  emergency  works,  if\nnecessary.\n\nA  Planning  and  Monitoring  Division  (PMD)  at  MFARD  will  be  established  by\nDecember  2000  and  made  operational  by  December  2002.  It  will  serve  as  the\ndata center of the agencies and departments under MFARD to advise on policy\nand operational matters.\n\nA data collection and management system in MFARD will be established by 2001\nand will become operational by December 2002 to serve as a facility for storage\nand inventory of relevant information on fisheries to support the PMD of MFARD\nas well as facilitate coastal zone planning and management.\n\n\f14\n\n(v) \n\nA  new  Central  Extension  Unit  (CEU)  will  be  established  within  DFAR  by\nDecember  2001  to  spearhead  the  awareness  programs  and  provide  technical\ndirection and training for field extension officers and social welfare services in the\ntarget communities.\n\nThe Government has agreed to assign the staff required for items (iii), (iv), and (v).\n\n6.\n\nAdministrative Reform\n\nThe Bank has also recommended to the Government that administrative control over the\n48.\nMarine  Pollution  Prevention  Authority  (MPPA)  be  transferred  to  MFARD  from  the  Ministry  of\nPorts  under  which \nfunctions.  This  would  allow  better  coordination  and\nimplementation  of  environmental  protection  between  CCD  (on  land)  and  MPPA  (in  water).  At\npresent the director of CCD is on the advisory committee of MPPA, but this arrangement is not\nconsidered sufficient to ensure coordination of activities and enforcement of regulations.\n\nit  presently \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nThe Project will be implemented at selected sites belonging to six administrative districts\n49.\nalong  the  north  western,  western,  and  southern  coasts  of  the  country.  The  districts  are\n(i) Puttalam  in  North  Western  Province;  (ii)  Gampaha,  Colombo,  and  Kalutara  in  Western\nProvince;  and  (iii)  Galle  and  Hambantota  in  Southern  Province  (see  map).  The  sites  were\nselected  through  an  extensive  process  of  consultations  with  all  stakeholders  in  a  two-stage\nprocess. At  the first  stage, the  criteria for  site  selection  were  developed  and  approved;  at  the\nsecond stage, the criteria were applied to a list of sites and the prioritized sites identified. The\nProject will target as its primary beneficiaries about 75 percent of the total households (76,500\nhouseholds)  in  the  coastal  areas of  these  districts.  The beneficiaries are  mostly  small  fishers,\nsmall  prawn  farmers,  fish  processors,  lagoon  fishers,  coral  miners,  fish  vendors,  small\nagriculture operators, and other workers in the fishing industry and allied fields, whose incomes\nare generally seasonal.\n\n50.\nA detailed description of the project area is in Appendix 3. In selecting the project area,\nenvironmental  considerations  were  the  principal  guiding  factor.  It  is  expected  that  project\ninterventions  in  the  selected  sites  will  result  in  an  integrated  resource  management  effort  and\nmaximize  the  benefits.  While  erosion  rates  and  threat  to  the  economic  infrastructure  are  the\nmain  reasons  for  the  stretches  identified  for  erosion  protection,  the  wetlands/lagoons  chosen\nare considered vital to maintain coastal resource regeneration. Harbor sites were determined by\nboat population and the need for safe landing areas, and intended to  reduce  loss  due to poor\nhandling and storage.\n\n51.\nSustainable  management  of  the  coastal  resources  will  require  an  integrated  approach\nthat  covers  all  aspects  and  will  provide  a  balance  between  conservation  and  development.\nAttention  is  urgently  needed  to  address  the  following  key  issues  in  the  Sri  Lankan  coastal\nresources  sector:  (i)  serious  erosion  of  the  coastline,  especially  in  areas  with  concentrated\neconomic  activity  or  vital  infrastructure;  (ii)  unmanaged  fishing  in  coastal  and  offshore  areas;\n(iii) pollution  and  uncontrolled  exploitation  of  lagoons  and  estuaries,  coral  reefs,  mangrove\nswamps,  sea  grass  beds,  other  wetlands,  and  dune  systems;  and  (iv)  widespread  poverty\namong the coastal population. Failure to accord priority to these issues would put the enormous\ncontribution of the coastal belt to the economy at risk.\n\n\f15\n\n52.\nErosion control has so far been attempted by the Government in an ad hoc manner with\nnumerous  revetments,  seawalls,  groins,  and  breakwaters  constructed  in  several  areas  in  an\neffort to control erosion and protect the coast. However, these physical structures have spoiled\nthe  natural  beauty  of  the  beach  and  have  adversely  affected  tourist  traffic.  More  importantly,\nthey  have  resulted  only  in  transferring  the  erosion  problem to adjacent areas  since  they  were\nbuilt  largely  to  protect  important  assets  but  without  a  plan  for  long-term  protection.  Although\nthese erosion control measures have reduced losses of land and infrastructure, they have been\nessentially emergency measures. A planned and sustainable strategy has not  been  attempted\ndue to inadequacy of resources and capacity constraints. Monitoring of the coastline and of the\nextent  and  rate  of  erosion  is  also  very  rudimentary,  and  there  is  no  planning  of  necessary\npreventive  measures.  The  problem  has  become  particularly  acute  in  the  southern  and  south\nwestern parts of the coast.\n\nPollution  and  depletive  livelihood  activities,  caused  by  poverty  among  the  population\n53.\ndependent on natural resources, pose a serious threat to the diverse natural ecosystems in the\ncoastal  belt,  and  have  severely  damaged  marine  sanctuaries  and  wetlands  that  provide\nvaluable  habitat  for  fish  and  other  living  aquatic  resources.  A  significant  percentage  of  the\npopulation living in the coastal areas earn their livelihood by exploiting the fishing and nonliving\nmarine resources. The income levels of many are below the poverty line, and unless measures\nare  taken  to  improve  their  income  levels  and  retrain  them  to  undertake  alternate  livelihood\nactivities,  the  pressure  that  this  population  exerts  on  the  resource  base  will  continue  to\nexacerbate the situation.\n\n54.\nUncontrolled coral mining has destroyed precious coral reefs and affected the country's\ntourism  potential.  Illegal  encroachment  into  lagoon  areas,  uncontrolled  discharge  of  industrial\nand  domestic  wastes,  and  intensive  illegal  harvesting  of  mangroves  for  fuel  and  shelter  have\nalso contributed significantly to the decline of marine ecosystems. Except for some site-specific\nresource management efforts undertaken with external  assistance,  there  is  no  comprehensive\nstrategy  for  the  preservation  of  lagoons  and  wetlands,  and  local  community  involvement  in\nsustainable management practices is limited, if not altogether lacking.\n\n55.\nAlthough offshore fishing has been  actively encouraged  in  the  recent past, an urgently\nneeded proactive program to conserve coastal fisheries is absent. The problem of over-fishing,\neven in offshore areas, is compounded by poor onboard storage and onshore handling, and by\nenvironmental  pollution  caused  by  oil,  trash,  and  fish  debris  from  fishing  boats.  With  the\nexpected increase in the number of  multiday boats, the demand for  additional  harbor facilities\nwill  have  to  be  met  by  the  Government  simultaneously  with  the  implementation  of  better  and\nmore  effective  fisheries  resource  management  interventions,  including  the  regulation  and\ncontrol of fishing effort and the introduction of measures to reduce fish spoilage. The latter can\nhave a significant overall impact on fisherfolk income.\n\n56.\nFor  the  Government  to  be  able  to  carry  out  these  tasks,  institutional  reforms  and\ncapacity-building  efforts  to  support  more  efficient  management  practices  are  required:  (i)  the\nlegal  basis  for  CRM  has  to  be  streamlined  to  allow  unified  control  and  strengthen  the\nenforcement capacity of the concerned institutions, (ii) more systematic monitoring needs to be\nset  in  place  to  assist  in  planning  and  management  control,  and  (iii)  present  institutional\narrangements  have  to  be  revamped  and  substantial  capacity-building  efforts  undertaken.\nWithout these measures, the Government will not be able to implement an integrated approach\nto the conservation and management of coastal resources.\n\n\fB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n16\n\n57.\nThe  overall  goal  of  the  sector  is  to  enhance  environmental  protection  in  the  coastal\nareas and contribute to poverty reduction among fisherfolk communities. The main objective of\nthe  Project  is  to  establish  integrated  management  of  coastal  resources  to  improve  their\nsustainabilty.\n\n58.\n\nThe Project will comprise four components:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\ncoastline  stabilization,  which  will  address  the  problem  of  coastal  erosion  and\ndevelop proactive coastal erosion management systems;\n\ncoastal environment and resource management, which will address problems of\ncoastal  resource  degradation  and  include  activities  intended  to  improve  the\nincome levels of coastal communities, thereby relieving the pressure  on  coastal\nresources;\n\nfisheries  resource  management  and  quality  improvement,  which  will  aim  at\nsustainable  coastal  fisheries  management  supported  by  the  construction  of\nharbors/anchorages and ancillary facilities that will permit the improvement of fish\nquality and reduction of pollution in lagoons; and\n\ninstitutional  strengthening,  which  will  enhance  the  institutional  capabilities  of\nMFARD, other concerned agencies, and community organizations in coastal and\nfisheries  resource  management.  A  participatory  approach  to  CRM  will  be\nadopted  in  the  development  and  implementation  of  community-based  SAM\nplans.\n\n1.\n\nCoastline Stabilization Component\n\n59.\nThe  Project  will  aim  to  minimize  the  potential  adverse  impacts  of  coastal  erosion  in\ncritical  coastal  stretches  through  the  establishment  of  appropriate  physical  interventions\nintended  to  stabilize  the  coastline.  In  parallel,  the  Project  will  promote  a  shift  in  erosion\nmanagement approach from defensive/reactive to proactive/preventive and include activities in\nsupport  of  the  overall  coastal  erosion  management  strategy,  including  the  conduct  of  special\nstudies, monitoring of the structural and functional performance of the physical structures, and\nestablishment  of  a  coastal  engineering  data  center.  The  works  will  be  implemented  in  seven\nspecific coastal segments from Galle to Chilaw, an overall length of 52 km out of a total stretch\nof  210  km.  Part  A  of  this  component  will  cover  five  sites  extending  over  37  km  (nos.  1-4  in\nTable 1), and Part B will cover two sites extending over 15 km (no. 5 in Table 1).\n\n60.\nThe engineering measures proposed for establishment  at  the  sites  will  include  artificial\nbeach  nourishment  and  a  combination  of  other  structures  including  groins,  revetments,  and\noffshore  breakwaters to obtain  the optimum  stabilization  scheme  in  terms  of  construction  and\nestablishment  cost,  maintenance  cost,  and  functionality.  The  design  concepts  were  planned\ntaking full account of the need to ensure that they are consistent with the concepts embodied in\nthe Coastal Zone Management Plan, 1997.\n\n2.\n\nCoastal Environment and Resource Management (CERM) Component\n\n61.\nTo  implement  CRM  activities  at  the  local  level,  a  location-specific,  community-based\nparticipatory  approach  will  be  used  through  the  establishment  of  community  coordinating\ncommittees (CCCs). Using a modular approach, different combinations of the following modules\n\n\f17\n\nare proposed for each site according to its management needs: (i) community strengthening; (ii)\nawareness  building;  (iii)  SAM  plan  preparation;  (iv)  habitat  conservation  and  resource\nmanagement interventions; (v) measures to improve water exchange in lagoons; and (vi) social\nprograms that will include provision for social infrastructure, training for livelihood development,\nmicroenterprise development support, etc.\n\n3.\n\nFisheries Resource Management and Quality Improvement Component\n\n62.\nThis  component  will  aim  at  the  sustained  management  and  development  of  coastal\nfisheries resources through activities that address the following identified issues: overfishing in\ncoastal waters, generally poor quality of fish landings and high percentage of fish wastage, and\nlack  of  infrastructure  support  facilities  in  specific  locations.  The  Project  will  address  resource\nsustainability  issues  through  (i)  installation  of  a  simplified,  functional,  community-based\nmonitoring,  control,  and  surveillance  (MCS);  (ii)  implementation  of  community-based  fisheries\nmanagement  activities as part  of  the  CRM/SAM  process;  (iii)  diversification  of fishing  effort  to\nreduce  pressure  on  coastal \nfisheries\ninvestigations/research  studies.  An  information  campaign  will  be  launched  to  publicize  the\nimproved  fishing  boat  design  and  promote  its  adoption  among  multiday  boat  operators  and\nfishers.  To  minimize  fish  spoilage,  fish  handling  and  storage  techniques  will  be  improved\nthrough  an  intensive  campaign  targeting fish  vessel  crewmembers,  fish  handlers,  processors,\nmarketers, traders, and retailers as well as the general public.\n\n(iv)  conduct  of  special \n\nfish  stocks;  and \n\n63.\nTo  complement  the  fish  quality  enhancement  interventions  described  earlier  and  to\nsupport the Project's environmental objectives, two fishery harbors will be constructed at Chilaw\nand  Hambantota  and  two  anchorages  will  be  rehabilitated  as  harbors  at  Ambalangoda  and\nKalametiya.  The  civil  works  in  the  selected  sites  will  include  (i)  rehabilitation  of  shore-based\nfacilities,  including  dredging,  rock  excavation,  construction  of  breakwaters,  quay  walls,  jetties,\nrevetments,  and  shore  services  including  fish  handling  sheds,  net  repair  sheds,  and  fueling\nfacilities; (ii) installation or improvement of existing associated services, including access roads,\ntoilets,  perimeter  fences,  water,  electricity,  and  area  lighting;  and  (iii)  regular  maintenance  to\nkeep the harbors and anchorages open.\n\n4.\n\nInstitutional Strengthening Component\n\n64.\nThis component will aim at enhancing the institutional capabilities of concerned MFARD\nagencies  and  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  in  resource  management.  The  Project\nwill include interventions intended to address identified institutional weaknesses and  equip  the\nconcerned  agencies  and  stakeholder  groups  for  the  roles  they  are  expected  to  play  in  CRM.\nStrengthening of the capabilities of MFARD and its offices will be closely linked to interventions\nfor improving community-level monitoring and data-gathering capabilities. A substantial training\nand technical support element will target MFARD personnel, at provincial  and  local  levels  and\ndepartment/corporation/agency  level  as  well  as  community  beneficiaries,  as  trainees.  The\nproposed fellowships and training courses for staff of MFARD and its key agencies have been\ndeveloped  in  consultation  with  MFARD,  but  the  specific arrangements  will  need  to  be  worked\nimplementation.  The  ministry's  data  collection,  processing,  and  database\nout  during \nmanagement capabilities will also be strengthened.\n\n65.\nThe institutional strengthening of CCD will particularly focus on building the capacity of\nthe Planning Research and Design Division as well as the zonal and district offices, which will\nbe established in the field under the Project. A computerized database management system will\nbe established in that division for the compilation, storage, and retrieval of  data  in  the form  of\nplans,  drawings,  photographic  records,  survey  data,  coastline  monitoring  measurements,  and\n\n\f18\n\ninformation  on  the condition of physical  installations  necessary  for  the  effective  functioning  of\nCCD.\n\n66.\nSpecific  research  studies  will  be  undertaken  to  improve  MFARD\u2019s  management\ncapacities and to provide some insights into difficult issues. Six topics have been  identified as\nvital  to  providing  relevant  information  for  effective  planning  and  policy  making  for  CRM  and\nconservation.  They  are  (i)  marine  fishery  resources  and  stock  assessment;  (ii)  reducing\npostharvest  losses  by  improving  onboard  fishing  technology;  (iii)  fisheries  technology;\n(iii) fisheries  sector  livelihood  potential;  (iv)  water  quality  in  the  coastal  zone  under  the  SAM\nprogram; (v) sand mining and alternatives; and (vi) policy on licensing, regulation and subsidies\nand the effect of existing and phased-out subsidies. The list of research topics was developed in\nconsultation  with the agencies  concerned,  and  the  detailed  terms  of  reference  will  be  worked\nout  following  an  agreed  upon  outline  terms  of  reference  (available  as  a  supplementary\nappendix) in consultation with the Bank during project implementation.\n\nSpecific project  interventions  under  the first  three  components and the  locations  within\n\n67.\nthe selected districts where they will be implemented are summarized in Table 1.\n\nTable 1:  Project Interventions and Locations\n\nCoastline Stabilization\n\nCoastal Environment and Resources\nManagement\n\n1.

A  more\ndetailed breakdown is in Appendix 4.\nPhysical  contingencies  are  based  on  20  percent  of  base  cost  of  civil  works  for  coastline  stabilization  and  harbors,  and\n10 percent of all other costs.\nPrice  contingencies  are  based  on  average  annual  escalation  of  2.4  percent  for  foreign  exchange  and  11  percent  for  local\ncurrency cost in 2000 and 10 percent thereafter.\nLocal currency figures Include taxes and duties of about $1.26 million equivalent.\n\nTotal may not tally due to rounding.\n\nD.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nIt  is  proposed  that  the  Bank  provide  a  loan  of  $40.0  million  from  its  Special  Funds\n69.\nresources  to  finance  about  50  percent  of  the  total  Project  cost.  The  proposed  Bank  loan  will\nhave a repayment period of 32 years, including an 8-year grace period, and will carry an interest\ncharge  of  1.0  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  thereafter.  The\nproposed financing plan is in Table 3. The financing plan, by component, is in Appendix 5.\n\nTable 3:  Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\n            Foreign                Local                 Total\n           Exchange          Currency               Cost             Percent\n\n29.32\n7.31\n7.37\n-\n\n44.0\n\n10.68\n5.45\n19.78\n0.09\n\n36.0\n\n40.00\n12.76\n27.15\n0.09\n\n80.0\n\n50.0\n16.0\n33.9\n0.1\n\n100.0\n\nSource\n\nBank\nNetherlands\nGovernmenta\nBeneficiaries\n\nTotal\n\na\n\nInclusive of commercial borrowing to be arranged by the Government.\n\n\f20\n\nThe  Government  of  the  Netherlands  accords  high  priority  to  environmental  protection\n70.\nand  natural  resource  management  in  Sri  Lanka  and  has  expressed  interest  to  provide  grant\ncofinancing  amounting  to  about  $12.76  million.  This  is  planned  to  cover  the  financing  for  the\nentire  CERM  and  institution  strengthening  components  of  the  Project.  Board  approval  for\nadministering  the amount  as  per  Bank guidelines  will  be obtained  as  soon  as  the  cofinancing\narrangements  are  firmed  up.  Including  this  grant  cofinancing,  it  is  expected  that  about  66\npercent of the total cost will be met by external financing and 33.9 percent by the Government\u2019s\nown  resources.  Beneficiaries  will  contribute  in  the  form  of  labor  for  the  construction  of  social\ninfrastructure  facilities  in  the  CERM  component.  The  Bank  will  partially  finance  Part  A  of  the\ncoastline stabilization component, and the Government is expected to avail itself of commercial\nborrowings  to  finance  Part  B  of  this  component.  The  commercial  borrowings  may  include  a\nsubsidized financial  scheme  of  the  Netherlands Government,  which  is  available  only  to  Dutch\ncontractors, or similar schemes to be offered by other member countries.\n\n71.\nThe Government has confirmed that its contributions will be reflected appropriately in the\nGovernment\u2019s Six-Year Development Program.  The  proposed  level of  local  currency financing\nby  the  Bank  takes  into  account  the  Government\u2019s  continuing  inability  to  self-finance  a\nsubstantial proportion of  the  investment program  required  to enable  Sri  Lanka  to  undergo  the\neconomic and social transition to a higher level of development and to reduce the high rate of\npoverty. Between 1994 and 1997, the Government had succeeded in reducing the budget deficit\nfrom  10.5  percent  of  GDP  to  7.9  percent.  Consistent  with  this  strategy,  the  1998  budget\nimposed  a  10  percent  cut  in  expenditures  other  than  salaries,  pensions,  and  education  and\nhealth  activities.  Outlays  were  significantly  reduced  with  the  retirement  of  the  public  debt  in\n1997,  utilizing  the  proceeds  from  privatization.  On  the  revenue  side,  a  goods  and  service  tax\n(GST)  was  introduced  in  April  1998.  Despite  these  measures,  however,  the  budget  deficit  in\n1998 was 8.1 percent of GDP after taking into account privatization proceeds and grants. This\noutcome was largely due to the lower than anticipated tax receipts in the first year of operation\nof the GST and larger than anticipated outlays on capital investment and defense. For 1999, the\noverall budget deficit has been revised to 7.8 percent of GDP against a forecast of 6.5 percent.\n\n72.\nIn  recent  years,  the  Government  has  taken  a  number  of  important  actions  to  mobilize\nnonbudget investment finance for the country. They include the implementation of an ambitious\nprivatization  program  in  sectors  such  as  civil  aviation,  telecommunications,  and  the  plantation\nindustry.  In  1997  and  again  in  1998,  the  Government  counterguaranteed  private  sector\nborrowing on the international capital market under the Bank\u2019s guarantee scheme. In  addition,\nthe  Government  secured  private  investment  in  capital-intensive  industries  such  as  the  power\nsupply  and  ports.  An  additional  10.5  percent  of  Government  shares  in  Sri  Lanka  Telecom  is\nexpected to be divested in 1999 and a bond issue of $200 million is planned for later this year.\nDespite  these  actions,  the  overall  capacity  of  the  Government  to  self-finance  the  public\ninvestment program in the coming years will be limited as debt servicing and the costs related to\nthe  ongoing  civil  conflict  continue  to  absorb  about  50  percent  of  the  budget  outlays.  The\nproposed  level  of  local  cost  financing  for  the  Project  is  therefore  justified  in  view  of  (i)  the\nprevailing difficult country circumstances, (ii) the positive environmental impact that the Project\nis expected to have, and (iii) the associated sustainable reduction in the level of poverty in the\npoor coastal communities.\n\n\fE.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n21\n\n73.\nThe Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development (MFARD) will be the EA,\nwith the following as Implementing Agencies (IAs): (i) CCD, which will coordinate and supervise\nthe  coastline  stabilization  and  CERM  activities;  (ii)  DFAR,  which  will  be  responsible  for  the\ndevelopment and operation of the fisheries management systems and supervision of fish quality\nenhancement  and  resource  conservation  measures;  and  (iii)  CFHC,  which  will  supervise  and\nmanage fisheries infrastructure development in the project areas. The EA is described in detail\nin Appendix 6.\n\n74.\nAn interagency project steering committee (PSC) will be established within six months of\nloan effectiveness, to be  chaired by  the secretary  of  MFARD  to  ensure  the full  cooperation  of\nand  effective  liaison  with  other  relevant  implementation  agencies.  The  committee  will  have,\namong  others,  representatives  from  the  National  Planning  Department,  External  Resources\nDepartment, Marine Pollution Prevention Authority, Ministry of Local Government and Provincial\nCouncils,  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development,  and  Ministry  of  Tourism.  During\ncommittee meetings, the  representatives of  the  other  relevant  agencies  will  also be  invited as\nrequired.  Site-specific  CCCs  will  also  be  established  at  the  CERM  project  sites  and  will  be\nchaired  by  the  divisional  secretaries  for  project  sites  under  their  jurisdiction.  The  CCCs  will\ninclude  representatives  from  fishery  cooperatives,  primary  thrift  and  credit  societies,  women's\ngroups,  and  all  relevant  organizations.  Close  working  relationships  with  active  NGOs  in  the\nselected sites will be established to facilitate effective implementation of field-level activities, and\ntraining and skills development activities, will be linked to employment demand.\n\nMFARD  will  establish  close  working  arrangements  with  NGOs/CBOs,  in  consultation\n75.\nwith the Bank, when project implementation commences. In view of the differing capacities and\ninvolvements of these agencies, MFARD felt that a uniform approach may not be desirable. The\ncriteria for selection of NGOs have been agreed upon with the Government and will be applied\nin  consultation  with  the  Bank.  The  NGOs  will  be  contracted  in  accordance  with  the\nGovernment\u2019s  standard  procedures  for  the  purpose.  In  principle,  the  Government  has  no\nobjection to bearing part of the administrative costs to be incurred by  these  NGOs for  specific\nactivities. The matter will be decided depending on the scope of the involvement and the nature\nof the tasks to be undertaken.\n\n76.\nNGOs  and  CBOs  have  expressed  keen  interest  in  project  activities  at  the  community\nlevel,  particularly  with  regard  to  CERM.  IUCN,  an  international  organization  with  extensive\nexperience in biodiversity conservation and CRM, has expressed interest in undertaking (i) SAM\nplanning    and  facilitation,  including  design  and  implementation  of  biodiversity  conservation\nprograms in the Bar Reef, Negombo, Madu Ganga, and Unawatuna Bay areas; (ii) planning and\nimplementation  of  activities  supplementary  to  the  IUCN/Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)\nProject  in  Kalametiya;  and  (iii)  provision  of  technical  advice  and  coordination  of  information,\neducation, and communication (IEC) activities, including workshops in the proposed SAM sites.\nSimilarly the Nature Conservation Group has expressed interest in being associated with coral\nreef  protection  and  rehabilitation  in  Unawatuna  Bay;  Seth  Sevana,  with  solid  waste\nmanagement  in  Lunawa;  and  the  Environmental  Foundation  Limited  (EFL),  in  environmental\nlegal  advocacy  activities.  Existing  credit  channels  can  ensure  credit  support \nfor\nlivelihood/microenterprise activities. The NGOs/CBOs  at  the  CERM  sites  will  assist  individuals\nin gaining access to the required credit from existing sources. CCCs are expected to monitor the\nsupply  of  credit  for  such  activities.  MFARD  has  agreed  to  extend  seed  money,  if  required,  to\nencourage livelihood development activities.\n\n1.\n\nProject Organization\n\n\f22\n\n77.\nTo oversee  the  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  Project, a project  management  office\n(PMO) has been established in MFARD under a project director (PD) reporting to the secretary\nof  MFARD.  The  PD,  who  has  been  appointed,  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  project\nimplementation  including  monitoring,  reporting,  and  coordination.  Action  is  being  taken  to\nappoint the necessary PMO staff. A qualified accounting officer will assist in the monitoring and\nmanagement of project funds and requisitions, and a secretary and administrative and support\nstaff will be appointed. The PD will oversee project management and coordination activities and\nwill be responsible for ensuring that tender documents for the civil works, which are  related  to\ninvestment activities under the  supervision and  coordination  of  CCD  and  CFHC,  are  prepared\nby the project consultants. The PD will also be responsible for the production of all accounting,\nprogress, and other reports required by the Government and the Bank.\n\n78.\nThe  PD  will  directly  supervise  the  six  field  project  implementation  units  (FPIUs)  at  the\nCERM project sites and the two project implementation units (PIUs) at CCD and CFHC, which\nwill  directly  report  to  the  PD.  The  FPIUs  will  have  jurisdiction  over  the  areas  where  project\ninvestments  will  be  implemented,  and  will  serve  as  conduits  for  funds  for  field-level\nimplementation. The site managers will coordinate with engineering staff of CCD, with respect to\nthe implementation of coastal protection activities, and with the district fishery extension officers\n(DFEOs) regarding fisheries-related activities. Each site  manager  will be  supported  by  a  CRM\nmobilizer and a social mobilizer, to be separately hired and who will be specifically responsible\ntheir\nfor  oversight  of  CERM \nrepresentatives.  Fishery  infrastructure  development  activities  will  be  coordinated  by  CFHC,\nwhich will report directly to the PMO.\n\ntarget  communities  and \n\ninterventions  and \n\nliaison  with \n\n2.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nfor \n\n79.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  66  months,  with  the  first  12  months\ndevoted to preparatory activities including (i) establishment of a PMO at MFARD, PIUs at CCD\nand CFHC within the first 6  months,  and  FPIUs  at  six project  sites;  (ii)  preparation  of  detailed\nengineering  designs \nthe  construction  of  coastal  protection  civil  works  and\nharbors/anchorages;  (iii)  social  preparation  and  community  organization  work  for  CERM  and\nlivelihood  development;  (iv)  training  and  skills  development  for  management  of  livelihood\nprojects; (v) provision of fellowships; and (vi) construction of social infrastructure facilities. The\nremaining period  will  be  used for  the full  implementation of  coastal  stabilization  works,  CERM\nactivities  and  preparation  of  SAM  plans, \ninstitutional\nstrengthening activities, and construction of harbors/anchorages. Six months will be allowed for\nproject completion activities. The proposed implementation schedule is in Appendix 7.\n\nIEC  and  awareness  programs, \n\n80.\nAt  the  end  of  the  third  year,  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  will  be  conducted  to\nassess project performance, identify problems and constraints encountered during the first two\nand  a  half  years  of  implementation,  and  propose  remedies  to  the  problems  identified.  A\nreassessment of project design will likewise be undertaken, including scope, the role of the IAs,\nand  the  various  implementation  arrangements,  including  any  reallocation  of  funds  among\ncomponents  or  adjustment  of  the  project  area,  as  required,  for  the  remaining  implementation\nperiod.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement\n\nThe PMO  will  be  responsible  for  the  procurement  of  all  goods  and  services  under  the\n81.\nProject.  All  services,  supplies,  and  equipment  to  be  financed  by  the  Bank  will  be  procured  in\naccordance with the Bank\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement  and  through  local  competitive bidding\n(LCB) in accordance with Government procedures, acceptable to the Bank. Bank-financed civil\nworks contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $1.0 million and above for the harbors and\n\n\f23\n\nall  such  contracts  for  the  coastline  stabilization  component  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of\ninternational  competitive  bidding  in  accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement.\nOther Bank-financed civil works contracts (for harbors) of less than $1.0 million  will  be  carried\nout by prequalified contractors selected under Government LCB procedures satisfactory to the\nBank.  The  award  of  contracts  with  a  value  of  $500,000  equivalent  and  above  will  need  prior\napproval  by  the  Bank.  All  (or  major)  Bank-financed  civil  works  contracts  under  the  coastline\nstabilization  component  will  be  tendered  and  awarded  before  contracts  to  be  funded  by\ncommercial borrowings (to finance Part B of the coastline stabilization component of the Project)\nwill be tendered. Supply contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of more than $500,000  will\nbe  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding  and  $500,000  or  less  will  be\nawarded on the basis of international shopping. Minor items costing less than $100,000 may be\nprocured by direct purchase. Information on the major contract packages is in Appendix 8.\n\n4.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n82.\nThe Project will require 662 person-months of consulting services: 207 international and\n455 domestic. Of the total, about 366 person-months (129 international and 237 domestic) will\nsupport  project  implementation.  CCD  and  CFHC  will  need  design,  management,  and\nsupervision  support  for  the  civil  works.  Consulting  services  will  also  be  provided  to  support\nareas  such  as  the  design  and  implementation  of  IEC  programs,  update  of  the  CZMP,  design\nand  implementation  of  the  corporate  training  programs  at  MFARD  and  its  key  agencies,\ndevelopment of a fishery harbor operations manual, design and installation of a data collection\nand  management  system  at  MFARD  and  its  key  agencies,  and  design  and  conduct  of\norientation courses on fisheries licensing and regulation. Other important areas to be supported\nare the conduct of research studies and benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) activities. The\noutline terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 9.\n\n83.\nThe consultants will be recruited in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to the Bank on the engagement of domestic\nconsultants. The Government has requested advance action for recruitment of consultants that\nwill be financed under the Bank loan. Approval of advance action, however, does not in any way\ncommit the Bank to finance the Project.\n\n5.\n\nAccounts and Audit\n\n84.\nAll  agencies  involved  in  implementation  will  prepare  and  maintain  separate  accounts\nfor  project-related  disbursements.  The  PMO  will  consolidate  the  accounts  from  the  various\nFPIUs and submit them to MFARD, which will review the consolidated accounts and, after audit,\nsubmit  them  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  the  Bank.  The  audit  report  will  include,  among\nothers,  a  statement  verifying  that  funds  disbursed  by  the  Bank  against  statements  of\nexpenditures have been used for the purpose for which they were provided. Project accounts,\ntogether  with  disbursement  documents,  will  be  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors\nacceptable to the Bank, and will be submitted to the Bank within 12 months of the end of each\nfiscal  year.  Imprest  account  facilities  will  be  established  directly  with  MFARD,  which  has  the\ncapacity to undertake and will be responsible for all administrative and accounting requirements\nrelating  to  the  operation  and  utilization  of  such  a  fund.  The  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)\nprocedures  will  be  used for  reimbursement of eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances\ncovered in the imprest account,  in accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook\nand  the  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  by  the  Bank  and  the  Government.  The  initial\namount  to  be  deposited  into  the  imprest  account  will  not  be  more  than  the  equivalent  of\n$200,000 and any individual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under the SOE procedure\nwill not exceed the equivalent of $50,000. It may also be necessary to establish procedures to\nexpedite the processing of small contracts for local initiatives at the local government level.\n\n\f24\n\n6.\n\nProject Monitoring\n\n85.\nInitial  work  on  the  conceptualization  of  a  monitoring  system  at  the  MFARD  Planning\nDivision  is  currently  being  carried  out  under  the  FAO-funded  Bay  of  Bengal  Programme\n(BOBP). The data collection and management systems that will be established in CCD, DFAR,\nCFHC, and NARA under the proposed Project will support and complement efforts under BOBP\nso  as  to  establish  in  MFARD  a  monitoring  system  that  will  serve  as  a  valuable  source  of\ninformation for planning and programming.\n\n86.\nThe monitoring system to be established in PMD of  MFARD  will  be  used  to  assemble,\nanalyze,  and  store  data  and  information  on  all  aspects  of  work  of  the  IAs,  and  to  provide\ninformation  for  project  monitoring.  Although  the  data  requirements  for  project  monitoring  are\nnarrower  in  scope  (related  to  project  components)  than  those  of  MFARD  (all  activities  of  its\ndepartments, authorities, agencies, and corporations), they will share some common data. It is\nimportant that the monitoring system is seen as distinct from the general data systems, and is\nhandled  and  analyzed  for  a  different  purpose,  i.e.,  to  determine  progress,  to  detect  problems\nearly on, and to ensure effective planning and development. These are the main features of the\nproposed monitoring system:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\na central monitoring unit within PMD of MFARD, which will analyze, consolidate,\nand present information gathered from the operational departments and agencies\nof MFARD on both regular ministry program and project progress;\n\na  project  monitoring  unit  within  PMO,  which  will  monitor  progress  according  to\nimplementation schedules and inputs in keeping with the design objectives;\n\na  submonitoring  unit  within  each  IA  (i.e.,  CCD,  DFAR,  and  CFHC),  which  will\nmonitor their  own  activities and  the  progress  of    their  particular  responsibilities;\nand\n\nproject field data and information collection, which will be undertaken through the\nFPIUs. Coastal protection monitoring will be handled by CCD's district and zonal\noffices (to be established under the Project at the start of implementation). CFHC\nwill conduct its own monitoring of harbor construction works.\n\n7.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation and Reporting\n\n87.\nA BME system will be designed and established at PMD of MFARD by December 2003,\nutilizing  information  collected  and  processed  through  the  data  collection  and  management\nsystems of CCD, DFAR, CFHC, and NARA. BME will be undertaken by a team of consultants\nwho will commence work from the second year of project  implementation; they will be recruited\nfor one month every year and will prepare an annual report. The team will be composed of (i) a\ncivil  engineer  from  a  private  civil  engineering  firm,  (ii)  a  natural  resources  management\nspecialist  from  a  national  university,  and  (iii)  a  social  and  livelihood  assessment  expert  with\nextensive experience in community-level social mobilization and livelihood and credit assistance\nfrom an NGO. The PMO will submit, through the EA, semiannual progress reports and annual\nfinancial  reports.  A  project  completion  report  will  also  be  submitted  at  the  end  of  the  Project\nwithin not more than 12 months of project completion.\n\n\fF.\n\nEnvironment and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironment\n\n25\n\n88.\nThe Project is expected to yield significant environmental benefits in terms of  resource\nconservation,  pollution  abatement,  and  improvement  of  public  health.  Many  of  the  proposed\nactivities  are,  in  fact,  in  the  nature  of  environmental  mitigation  or  enhancement  measures\nthemselves.  The  coastal  protection  works  to  be  set  up  will  prevent  substantial  losses  due  to\ncoastal erosion  in  residential,  commercial,  and  industrial facilities  as  well  as  road  and  railway\ninfrastructure. The Project will also prevent damage to the natural environment, such as wetland\nareas and other coastal habitat along the coastline. Coastal protection works under the Project\nwill yield direct benefits from the land that would be saved with the stabilization of erosion at the\nproject  sites.  Modeling  studies  indicate  that  the  impact  of  the  physical  stabilization  measures\nover 52 km will be felt over a much larger area. Coastline stabilization will produce innumerable\nbenefits  to  the  tourism  industry,  which  is  the  second  largest  foreign  exchange  earner  of  the\ncountry next to the tea industry.\n\nCERM  activities  as  well  as  various  community  development,  poverty  reduction,  and\n89.\ninstitutional  strengthening  activities  are  expected  to  yield  overall  positive  environmental\nbenefits. Measures to mitigate problems affecting the ecological integrity of coastal habitats will\nresult in improvements in their economic, aesthetic, and recreational values and subsequently\nensure their long-term sustainability. The rehabilitation and conservation of coastal habitats and\nadoption  of  fisheries  management  measures  will  lead  to  increased  fish  availability  and,\nconsequently, increased fish catches and higher incomes for fisherfolk.\n\n90.\nIn addition, the Project is expected to generate significant socioeconomic benefits to the\ncoastal communities as a result of the establishment of the fishery harbors/anchorages and the\nresultant improved efficiency of fishing operations due to the availability of support facilities. The\nproposed  fishing  harbors  and  anchorages  are  all  located  in  intensive  fishing  areas,  and  fish\nlanding  activities  have  been  practised  at  all  sites.  The  two  fishing  harbors  (in  Chilaw  and\nHambantota)  will  be  established  on  existing  facilities.  To  minimize  further  environmental\nimpacts from the activities, each of the fishing harbors and anchorages will be provided with a\nsolid  waste  management  system;  wastewater  collection,  treatment,  and  disposal  system;  oil\nwaste  collection  system; and adequate  sanitation facilities.  For each, the effluent  from  fishery\nactivities  will  meet  the government environmental  standard.  These  measures  will  improve  the\ngeneral environmental condition of the fishing harbors and anchorages.\n\n91.\nThe  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and  the  summary  EIA  (SEIA)  for  the\nProject  were  prepared  following  the  Bank\u2019s  environmental  guidelines.13  The  EIA  has  been\nreviewed and endorsed by the concerned agencies of the Government. The EIA assesses the\npositive  as  well  as  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  the  project  interventions.\nThe  potential  adverse  impacts  include  quarry  and  transport  of  materials,  offshore  sand\nextraction,  and  dredging.  Impact  mitigation  measures  have  been  identified  and  will  be\nimplemented. They relate mainly to sand extraction, which will be carried out in deepsea areas\nat  least  beyond 8  km offshore; and dredging,  which  will be  limited  to  2  meters  (m)  below  the\nexisting seabed levels, at depths equal to or greater than 15 m below mean sea level, to avoid\nhydraulic and geotechnical problems. The dredging of the harbor basin is not likely to result in\nsignificant impacts on the biota and the ecology of the area.\n\n92.\nThe  EIA  concluded  that  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  the  Project\ncould  be  minimized  to  acceptable  levels  through  the  implementation  of  a  set  of  mitigation\n\n                                                       \n13  The SEIA was circulated to the Board on 29 July 1999.\n\n\fmeasures.  Additional  environmental  investigation  for  the  coastal  stabilization  component,  and\nharbors  and  anchorages  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  Government  guidelines,  and\nGovernment clearance will be obtained prior to implementation of the works.\n\n26\n\n2. \n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n93.\nThe  project  area  extends  from  Puttalam  in  the  northwest  to  Tangalle  in  the  south\n(excepting  Matara  district).  It  is  heavily  populated,  and  has  a  marine  fishing  population  of\n145,000,  of  which  35,000  are  active  fishers.  From  the  results  of  a  rapid  social  assessment\nsurvey in selected coastal communities in the project area, it is estimated that about 24 percent\nof the households in the coastal areas of the six districts have an income below SLRs30,000 per\nyear.  Of  the  remaining  households,  about  13  percent  receive  a  household  income  of\nSLRs30,000-45,000, 22 percent enjoy a household income of SLRs45,000-63,000 and another\n17 percent earn SLRs63,000-80,000 per year. The major target group of the Project will be the\nabove  groups,  amounting  to  about  76,500  households.  The  remaining  24,000  households\n(about 24 percent of the total), comprise moderate (13 percent)  and high  (11 percent)  income\nearners  with  earnings  greater  than  SLRs80,000  per  year  per  household.  An  initial  social\nassessment of the project area is in Appendix 10.\n\n94.\nAside  from  its  resource  management  thrusts,  the  Project  also  is  expected  to  actively\ninvolve the target groups, including women, in project implementation, through the formation of\nCCCs and the involvement of local NGOs/CBOs. These measures will assist in mainstreaming\nthe beneficiary population in resource management and poverty reduction efforts. In anticipation\nof their active participation in the Project and to give them a sense of project ownership, which\nare critical to its success as a community-based undertaking, socioeconomic surveys, national-\nand local-level workshops, and focus group discussions were conducted as part of the project\ndesign process. The results of the surveys and local-level consultations revealed the beneficiary\npopulation\u2019s problems, needs, wants, and aspirations.\n\n95.\nProject  intervention has been  designed  to  encourage  the  communities  to  perceive  the\nneed  for  reducing  exploitation  and  adopting  conservation  measures,  while  at  the  same  time\ndemonstrating  that  additional  income  can  be  generated  through  improved  fish  handling,\nreduction in postharvest losses, etc. The Project  will  complement ongoing Government efforts\nto  address  widespread  poverty  in  the  fishing  community  in  the  country.  There  is  need  for\nconcerted  efforts  to  encourage  alternative  livelihood  development  activities  through  skills\ntraining  and  provision  of  credit,  both  of  which  activities  are  expected  to  be  performed  by\nNGOs/CBOs.  It  is also expected  that  women  members  of  the  community  will  be  mobilized  to\nplay an important role in household income generation, management of fisheries organizations,\nand resource conservation.\n\n3. \n\nGender Analysis\n\n96. Women\u2019s labor is mainly used in fish landing, net cleaning, and net repairs. Traditionally\nwomen  have  also  been  involved  in  fish  curing  and  employed  in  prawn  farming.  These\nopportunities have been affected by the destruction of resources in the lagoons, which affects\nprawn fishing and eliminates the surplus fish catch for drying. Beach erosion has also affected\nnet mending sites and places for vending small catches.\n\nThe potential and  the  capacities of  women  to  take  advantage  of  new  opportunities  for\n97.\nincome generation to reduce poverty and deprivation and the sole dependence on fishing have\nbeen  the  focus  of  several  studies.  The  findings  have  underscored  the  capacity  of  fisher\ncommunities, particularly  through  the  initiatives  of  women,  to  adapt  to  nontraditional  lifestyles\nand occupations, provided that an external catalyst works with them and takes them through the\n\n\f27\n\nlong period of adjustment and change. There is consensus that women have a positive role in\npoverty reduction through the adoption of enhanced nonfishing activities. Women in the fishing\ncommunities  in  the  project  locations  could  be  mobilized  to  become  active  participants  in\nlivelihood development activities  in  the  project  and  to  eventually  become  instruments  through\nwhich undue dependence on a depleting resource in fishing can be severed. Women\u2019s groups,\nwhich  actively  participated  in  the  planning  for  the  Project,  have  been  actively  involved  in  the\nSAM  planning  process  and  expressed  interest  in  availing  themselves  of  credit  for  livelihood\ndevelopment  activities.  Skills  development  training  will  target  women\u2019s  groups  to  the  extent\npossible. Women\u2019s groups will also be involved in the community organization efforts under the\nCERM  component,  particularly  in  programs  relating  to  improvement  of  sanitation  and  other\nservices.  NGOs/CBOs  involved  with  the  CERM  activities  are  expected  to  assist  women  in\naccessing credit and undertaking income-generating activities.\n\nA.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nThe overall economic viability of the Project was analyzed  by calculating  the  stream  of\n98.\nnet incremental  costs and benefits  attributable to the  various  components over a period  of  20\nyears.  The  calculation  of  incremental  costs  was  based  on  the  estimates  of  investment  cost\nitems consisting of civil works and construction, capital goods including initial operational inputs,\nconsulting services, training, initial working capital requirements, and research and surveys. In\naddition, recurrent costs including O&M costs incurred during project implementation and after\ncompletion were calculated. All costs were expressed in 1999 constant economic values.\n\n99.\nIncremental  economic  benefits  were  estimated  from  all  the  components  except\ninstitutional  strengthening.  Economic  benefits  expected  from  coastline  stabilization  are  (i)  the\nprevention of economic losses to the national economy such as value of houses and buildings\nsaved  due  to  the Project;  (ii)  avoidance of  removal and administrative  costs  and  disruption  of\nwork;  and  (iii)  the opportunity  costs of agricultural  land  and  potential  losses  in  tourist  industry\nthat will be prevented with the implementation of the Project. Economic benefits from CERM are\nbased on (i) use values as generated by the increased production of the coastal shrimp, small\npelagic,  and  lagoon  fisheries  as  well  as  by  recreational  values  and  ecotourism  benefits;  and\n(ii) nonuse values such as biodiversity and foreign tourists\u2019 willingness to pay (WTP). Economic\nbenefits  derived  from  fisheries  management  and  fish  quality  improvement  are  the  projected\nincreases in fish landings and reductions in loss of fish production as a result of improved fish\nhandling and processing.\n\n1.\n\nEconomic Benefits\n\n100. With the coastline stabilization component, it is expected that 52 km of coastline will be\nsaved  in  the  with-Project  situation.  The  area  that  will  be  saved  from  erosion  is  estimated  at\n10.23 ha each year or about 204.6 ha over the life of the Project. The value of houses that will\nbe protected from erosion is estimated at about $1.27 million each year or about $25.40 million\nover 20 years. This benefit is in addition to the savings of owners from not having to remove the\nbuilding  remains  or  lose  work  time  and  income,  and  also  the  prevented  loss  of  agricultural\nproduction. Potential losses from tourism that will be avoided are estimated at about $5.1 million\neach year, or $102 million over the life of the Project.\n\n101. Quantifiable  benefits  from  the  CERM  component  are  derived  from  the  estimated  use\nvalues concerning biodiversity; value of production generated from the lagoon, coastal shrimp,\nand  small  pelagic  fisheries;  and  the  perceived  tourists\u2019  WTP  for  use  of  the  lagoons  for\nrecreation.\n\n\f28\n\n102. Benefits  from  the  fisheries  management  and  fish  quality  improvement  component  are\nprimarily from increased fish landings due to the construction of fishery harbors. Incremental fish\nlandings  are  expected  to  increase  from  897  tons  per  year  (t/yr)  in  year  3  of  project\nimplementation  to  5,861  t/yr  in  year  6  and  onward.  Moreover,  increases  in  fish  supply  are\nenvisioned  due  to  about  20  percent  reduction  in  postharvest  losses  over  the  duration  of  the\nProject.\n\n103. Based on the economic cost and benefit streams generated from each of the economic\nanalyses  carried  out  for  the  various  investment  activities  under  the  different  components,  the\neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  whole  Project  was  estimated  at  15.3  percent.  The\ndetailed economic analysis is attached as Appendix 11.\n\n2.\n\nOther Benefits\n\nin \n\nthe \n\ninvolved \n\n104.\nThe Project  is expected to have numerous  nonquantifiable benefits not  included  in  the\npreceding analysis. The principal ones consist of (i) institutional strengthening of MFARD and its\nimplementation  of  project-related  activities;\nkey  agencies  directly \n(ii) enhancement  of  interagency  linkages  through  cooperation \nin  the  coordination  and\nimplementation of CRM plans and activities; (iii) improved and effective resource management\nand  protection;  (iv)  enhanced  beneficiary  participation  in  resource  management  and  project\nimplementation;  (v)  establishment  of  strong  partnerships  among  the  local  government,  the\ncommunities, and NGOs/CBOs in community-based resource management; (vi) increased food\nsupply, \nimproved  community  welfare.  Other\nnonquantifiable benefits  include  the  retardation  of  coastal  resource  depletion  and  degradation\nthrough effective environmental protection and resource management as well as the promotion\nof beneficiary participation in community-based CRM and in project implementation.\n\nimproved  nutrition,  and  health;  and  (vii) \n\nB.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n105.\nThough  coastal  stabilization  appears  to  be  an  infrastructure  component  it  contains  a\nnumber of tangible as  well  as  intangible  impacts  that  will  impinge directly  on  the poor  coastal\ncommunities, particularly the large numbers of small-scale fisherfolk inhabiting the coastal zone.\nAround 5,300 fishing families are estimated to directly benefit from beach protection, and about\n1,800  permanent  and  temporary  seafront  houses,  most  of  which  belong  to  fisherfolk,  will  be\nprotected  in  and  around  the  project  sites.  Although  in  calculating  the  benefits  the  Project\nassumes a modest 10 ha of land that will be saved per year, the favorable impacts of coastal\nstabilization are estimated to benefit about 400 ha of coconut plantations and 1,300 ha of home\ngardens in the project area. The harbors and anchorages are primarily meant to support more\nmechanized fishing. Nevertheless, members of poor fishing families will also benefit widely from\nthe additional employment opportunities that will be generated by the development of multiday\nfishing centered on these harbors and anchorages. It is estimated that over 1,000 jobs will be\ncreated  at  the  four  sites.  Simultaneously,  with  the  new/additional  facilities,  harbors  and\nanchorages  will  provide  opportunities  to  improve  the  efficacy  of  fishing  operations  of  poor\nfisherfolk, and help upgrade the quality of fish, reduce postharvest losses, and ultimately secure\nhigher  prices/incomes,  which  are  estimated  to  increase  by  about  10-15  percent.  The  CERM\ncomponent  will  include  measures  aimed  at  countering  marine  resource  depletion,  water\npollution,  and  deterioration  of  coastal  habitats  through  an  integrated  approach.  This  program\nwill  also  help  to  obtain  the  active  participation  of  the  coastal  communities  in  resource\nmanagement, to empower them and encourage them to make informed decisions on the use of\ntheir  resources.  The  CERM  component  will  contribute  to  the  improvement  of  the  health  and\nsanitary conditions of the communities, particularly those living around the marshes, wetlands,\nand lagoons.\n\n\fC.\n\nProject Risks\n\n29\n\nIt \n\nthat  the \n\ntechnical \n\nis  believed \n\ninnovations  proposed  are  sound. \n\n106.\nIf  properly\nimplemented,  they  should  pose  no  serious  risk.  In  integrated  projects  like  this,  however,\nefficiency  and  interagency  cooperation  will  require  special  efforts.  The  participatory  nature  of\nthe  Project  will  require  regular  consultations  with  target  groups  whose  full  cooperation  is\nessential. Attitudinal changes are essential to project success, particularly toward environmental\nprotection  and  quality  control  practices.  The  ongoing  civil  conflict  is  unlikely  to  affect  project\nimplementation as the sites are not involved in the strife.\n\n107. Certain overlaps and contradictions that exist between the mandates of MFARD and its\nagencies, and between MFARD and its units and those of other Government agencies, impede\nthe  effective  management  of  the  coastal  resources  sector.  In  this  regard,  the  Project  has\nidentified  specific  countermeasures,  such  as  the  proposal  to  replace  the  present  Coast\nConservation Act with a new law incorporating various amendments to rationalize the statutes\nthat give similar powers over the coastal zone to other ministries or authorities, and which have,\nin effect, caused the powers, functions, and duties of CCD to be eroded over the years.\n\n108.\nInstitutional  inadequacies  of  the  EA/IAs,  and  the  lack  of  cooperation  and  coordination\nbetween Government agencies and different levels of Government are also obstacles to project\nsuccess.  The  different  mandates,  priorities,  and  funding  allocations  of  various  Government\nagencies  could  become  obstacles \nto  establishing  efficient  and  effective  coordinating\nmechanisms  for  project  implementation.  Countermeasures  to  this  risk  include  (i)  a  careful\ndesign  and  vigorous  implementation  of  the  project's  institutional  strengthening  component,\nwhich aims to build the capacity of the EA/IAs; (ii) formation of a PSC at the national level and\nof  CCCs  at  the  local  level;  (iii)  provision  of  long-term  consultants  for  EA/IAs,  and  NGO\nassistance to FPIUs and local governments; and (iv) design and implementation of an effective\nmonitoring and reporting system, with a view to obtaining prompt feedback and allowing timely\nremedies.\n\n109.\nThe lack of Government counterpart funds may also delay implementation. After project\ncompletion,  the  small  annual  budget  allocated  to  the  coastal  resources  sector,  including\nfisheries,  may  also  jeopardize  the  sustainability  of  the  various  management  systems\nestablished  under  the  Project,  such  as  maintenance  of  coastline  stabilization  schemes,\nparticularly  beach  nourishment.  The  annual  budget  requirement  for  the  O&M  of  the  various\nmeasures  to  be  established  under  the  Project  has  been  estimated.  The  Government  fully\nrecognizes the importance of maintaining the coastline stabilization schemes and is committed\nto providing sufficient allocations under the national budget to sustain project activities and long-\nterm impacts.\n\n110. One of the more difficult tasks facing the Project  is that of fostering  the growth of new\nattitudes  and  mind  set  toward  resource  management,  environmental  protection,  social\nempowerment,  fish  quality,  hygiene,  marketing,  and  interagency  cooperation.  The  mental\noutlook and defensive  instincts of both  coastal  communities and  local  officials  will  have  to  be\naddressed  in  a  long-term  program  of  education,  awareness,  motivation,  and  trust-building.\nFailure  to  achieve  progress  in  this  task  will  seriously  diminish  the  chances  of  achieving  the\nmajor  project goals.  To  counteract  this  risk,  the  Project  will  conduct  IECs  at  the  national  and\nlocal  levels.  For  the  government  agencies,  there  will  be  regular  workshops  and  briefing\nsessions.  Participating  officers  will  be  encouraged  to  share  their  positive  experiences,  and\nefforts will be pursued to disseminate such feedback widely.\n\n\f30\n\nVI.

These subsidies will continue to be targeted to poor fishermen, and used\nto encourage the shift to offshore fishing and facilitate adoption of new technology for\ndiversified fishing, navigation equipment, and improved preservation of the catch.  A\ndetailed  review  of  the  need  to  continue  subsidies  for  offshore  vessels  will  be\nundertaken with the Bank, during the midterm review of the Project.\n\n(viii)  The  CCD\u2019s  physical  construction  work  will  be  phased  out  by  the  end  of  project\nimplementation  and  the  department  will  confine  itself  to  policy,  planning,  and\nemergency works.\n\n(ix) \n\nThe  berthing  charges  already  being  levied  under  the  ongoing  Fisheries  Sector\nProject  (Loan  1201\u2013SRI)  will  be  extended  to  the  harbors  and  anchorages  to  be\nconstructed under the  Project.

The seven sites were selected out of a list of\nkey areas1 and singular cases2 in the Master Plan for Coastal Erosion Management (MPCEM),\nbased on the following considerations: (i) geomorphologic settings; (ii) magnitude of erosion; (iii)\nutilities affected (e.g., roads, railway, church, mosque); (iv) resources degraded and threatened;\n(v)  impact  of  human  interference  contributing  to  the  problem  (e.g.,  with  poorly  designed  and\nunplanned  protection  structures);  (vi)  public/political  demand  or  will  for  a  solution;  and  (vii)\nfeasibility to  design an effective  and  efficient  coast  conservation  concept.   Of the  seven  sites,\nthe  coastal  stretches  of  Maha  Oya-Lansigama,  Colombo  North-Dickowita,  and  Payagala\n(Kalutara  River  mouth  to  Maggona  Headland), altogether  comprising  a  31  km  length,  are  the\nworst  affected  coastal  reaches.  The  sites  Wadduwa-Kalutara,  Beruwela-Bentota,  and\nHikkaduwa-Galle  need  urgent  consideration  for  coastal  erosion  management  and  possibly\nphysical  intervention. Beruwela-Bentota is a very important coastal stretch because it has the\nhighest  concentration  of  high-value  tourist  hotels  and  resorts;  soft  interventions  seem  to  be\nrequired to avoid resource degradation of this vulnerable area. Hikkaduwa-Galle is an area with\na  high  resource diversity  (coral  reefs,  sea grass, fisheries,  urban  area,  tourism).  Although  the\nstretch  seems  to  have  been  rather  stable  during  the  last  decade,  it  is  highly  vulnerable  as\nrecords of shoreline variation during the last century show.\n\n2.\nThe  Coastal Environment  and  Resource  Management  (CERM)  sites  considered  under\nthe  Project  were  selected  from  23  sites  identified  in  the  Coastal  Zone  Management  Plan\n(CZMP), 1997 as potential areas for application of the special area management (SAM) process\nas well as for limited interventions. Since 11 of these sites are outside the project area (i.e., from\nKalpitiya  in  the  northwest  to  Kirinda  in  the  southeast),  the  remaining  12  sites  were  prioritized\nbased  on  selection  criteria  developed  by  the  consultant  in  collaboration  with  the  Coast\nConservation Department (CCD) and stakeholders, and the final list of nine CERM sites drawn\nup. The site selection criteria include the following: (i) presence of sensitive habitats/endangered\nspecies;  (ii)  degree  of  threat  to  environment  or  resource  and  need  for  protection  or\nrehabilitation; (iii) opportunity for community participation, level of political will, and opportunities\nfor building on past efforts or for synergies with other programs; and (iv) beneficiary population,\npotential for creation of livelihood opportunities, and improvement of the environment. The main\nproblems  affecting  the  nine  sites  selected  for  consideration  under  the  Project  are  described\nbriefly.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nNegombo Lagoon supports a rich fishery industry and growing foreign and local\ntourism. Threats to the lagoon include an expanding population exerting pressure\non the  habitat for  land  and  extraction of  resources, user  conflicts,  and  pollution\ndue to industries, prawn farming, and siltation.\n\nLunawa  Lagoon  is  currently  experiencing  heavy  pollution  due  to  discharges  of\nindustrial and domestic wastes over the past years. The  situation  is aggravated\nby the disconnection of the lagoon from the sea due to the formation of sandbars\nat  the  opening  to  the  sea.  The  lagoon  is  nearly  devoid  of  fauna  and  flora  and\n\n                                               \n1 \n\nKey areas are morphologically complex areas incorporating several characteristic morphological elements, and where diverse\ndevelopment  pressure  indicates  the  need  for  integrated  solutions  encompassing  a  coastal  reach  of  several  kilometers  in\nlength.\nSingular  cases  are  areas  that  can  be  treated  in  isolation.  They  cover  a  limited  coastal  area  where  the  processes  causing\nerosion are self-evident and easily ascertained.\n\n2 \n\n\f(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n(vii)\n\n(viii)\n\n(ix)\n\nAppendix 3, page 2\n\nposes  health threats  with the  reported  increasing  incidence  of  mosquito-related\ndiseases.\n\nMadu Ganga Estuary and Lagoon recently gained importance for ecotourism and\nconventional  recreation-based  tourism  such  as  speed  boating  and  surfing.\nHowever, the recent increase in tourism activities has given rise to conflicts with\nfisheries  resource  use,  posing  a  potential  threat  to  both  resource  use  activities\nand to the pristine nature of the habitat.\n\nUnawatuna Bay is a popular tourist site due to its beautiful scenery, beach, and\ncoral reefs, and has been traditionally used for fishing.  Tourism  in  the area  has\nbeen  adversely  affected  by  unplanned  construction  on  the  beach  and  in  the\nsurrounding areas. Fishing is also under threat due to overfishing of ornamental\nfish in the reefs and the use of dynamite for offshore fishing. Close by is a unique\nbiodiversity-rich habitat, Rummassala Hillock.\n\nKalametiya Lagoon is associated with wetlands rich in biodiversity and provides a\nhabitat  for  migratory  bird  species.  It  is  unique  in  its  being  a  nesting  area  for\nmigratory  turtles.  Threats  to  the  lagoon  habitat  include  altered  water  flows\n(change  of  salinity  levels)  to  the  lagoons  due  to  upstream  irrigation  water  use,\noverfishing,  shell  and  coral  mining,  mangrove  cutting,  and  poaching  of  turtle\neggs.\n\nMawella  Lagoon  is  in  close  proximity  to  Kalametiya.  Its  habitat  conditions,\neconomic use, and potential threats are very similar to those at Kalametiya.\n\nBar  Reef  is  one  of  a  few  remaining  coral  reefs  in  Sri  Lanka  that  are  still  in  a\nrelatively pristine condition. Although the area has been declared as a sanctuary,\nreef  biodiversity  is  threatened  due  to  inadequate  management  and  fishing,\nparticularly for ornamental fish for export.\n\nHikkaduwa is a very popular tourist resort area due to its sandy beaches, shallow\nsea, and coral reefs. Although the Hikkaduwa coral reef area has been declared\nas  a  marine  sanctuary,  and  attempts  to  manage  it  as  a  SAM  site  have  been\nundertaken,  there  are  still  threats  to  this  critical  natural  habitat  which,  if  not\naddressed,  will  lead  to  the  loss of biodiversity and  further  loss  of  revenue  from\ntourism.\n\nThe  Tangalle-Hambantota  area comprises  a  variety  of  important ecological  and\nnatural  features,  including  extensive  sand  dunes  and  strand  vegetation  that\nsupport numerous  birds  and  other  wildlife.  The  area  is  affected  by  sand  mining\nwithin  the  dune areas,  unauthorized  construction  on  the  dunes,  and  unplanned\ndisposal of  solid  waste  in the  more  populated  areas.  The  Government  plans  to\nundertake  extensive  development  within \nthe\nconstruction  of  a  port,  a  refinery,  a  new  city,  and  highways,  will  need  to  be\nimplemented keeping in mind the environmental impact on the area.\n\nthe  district,  which \n\ninclude \n\n3.\nFishery harbors/anchorages  are  proposed  for  development  in  areas  where  there  is  an\nurgent need to minimize environmental degradation resulting from the use of coastal habitats for\nfish  landing and boat  anchorage.  These  sites  were  selected  from  a  long  list  of  potential  sites\nusing  evaluation  criteria  developed  by  the  consultant  in  collaboration  with  the  Ceylon  Fishery\n\n\fHarbours  Corporation  (CFHC),  the  Department  of  Fisheries  and  Aquatic  Resources  (DFAR),\nand Fisheries Sector Development Project (Loan 1201-SRI) funded by the Asian Development\nBank.  The  criteria \nfacilities,  demand\nconsiderations,  presence  of  support  infrastructure  facilities,  and  impacts  on  the  environment.\nThe sites are described briefly.\n\ninclude  geographical  considerations,  existing \n\nAppendix 3, page 3\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nChilaw  harbor  will  be  located  on  the  western  side  of  the  lagoon  channel  in  the\narea  of  the  existing  fish  market  on  both  sides  of  the  bridge.  Presently,  a  large\nfleet of 3,400 boats operate from Chilaw lagoon. Of the total fleet, 133 multiday\nboats,  110  day  boats  with  inboard  engines  (IBE  boats),  and  1,457  fiberglass\nreinforced plastic (FRP) boats are badly in need of landing facilities, as the only\nlanding area in use is at  the fish  market  adjacent  to  the  bridge over  the  lagoon\nchannel. For lack of appropriate facilities, all boats have to be beached, and the\nplace  is  heavily  congested  during  peak  hours.  The  existing  auction  hall  is  dark\nand  dirty  and  does  not  provide  the  space  and  hygienic  conditions  required  for\nproper handling of fish.\n\nHambantota  Bay  has  long  been  established  as  an  anchorage  and,  although\nrelatively unprotected, apparently provides some protection from the worst of the\nsouthwest  monsoon  storms.  There  is,  however,  a  need  to  reconstruct  the  old\njetty structures at the western end of the bay as fishers have to pass the zone of\nbreaking  waves  to  get  their  boats  closer  to  the  beach.  This  has  resulted  in\nnumerous  fatal  accidents  during  times  of  adverse  wave  conditions,  especially\nduring the southwest monsoon. Rehabilitation of the brick retaining wall along the\nelevated  road  behind  the  beach,  which  has  partly  collapsed,  is  also  required.\nAbout 600 fishers operate from Hambantota, and the local fleet  is  composed of\n249  traditional  crafts,  17  IBE  boats,  and  84  outboard  engine  (OBE)  boats  6-8\nmeters  long.  There  are  presently  no  safe  anchorage  facilities  for  IBE  boats\nbetween  Tangalle  and  Kirinda.  An  estimated  361  multiday  boats,  86  IBE  day\nboats, and 521 FRP OBE boats operate from Tangalle. In addition,multiday boats\nfrom Hambantota berth at Tangalle for want of any facility  in  Hambantota.  As a\nresult, the Tangalle fishery harbor is overcrowded.\n\nAmbalangoda  and  Kalametiya  anchorage  sites  were  identified  as  high-priority\nsites and were selected based on a set of criteria that include the following: high\ndemand for anchorage facilities, presence of support infrastructure facilities (i.e.,\nroadways, freshwater supply, power facilities, market facilities, fuel, ice, and craft\nrepair facilities). Sizable local fishing populations in these areas own small fishing\ncraft and who, due to the nature of their craft, are not likely to be served by the\nadditional  anchorage  capacity  to  be  created  by  the  ongoing  Hikkaduwa  harbor\ndevelopment and the existing Kirinda harbor. As in Hambantota,  multiday boats\nas  well  as  IBE  boats  are  unable  to  berth  at  Kalametiya  due  to  the  lack  of  a\nharbor/anchorage there.\n\n\fAppendix 4\n\nDETAILED PROJECT COST SUMMARY\n($ million)\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n(Excl.\nTaxes)\n\n     Foreign\n   Exchange\n\nDuties &\nTaxes\n\nItem\n\nI.\n\nInvestment Costs\nA.

MFARD  has  two  main  departments:  the  Coast  Conservation\nDepartment  (CCD)  and  the  Department  of  Fisheries  and  Aquatic  Resources  (DFAR).  The\nministry  has  functions  related  to  all  fishery  matters,  including  administration,  policy  making,\nmanagement, development, research, and monitoring and evaluation. The National Institute of\nFisheries  Training  and  the  National  Aquatic  Resources  Research  and  Development  Agency\n(NARA)  are  other  key  agencies  working  under  the  administrative  control  of  MFARD.  MFARD\nhas clear goals and its departments have elaborated their strategic plans. MFARD is currently\nplanning a reorganization to improve its organizational efficiency through the setting up of three\ndivisions within the ministry for policy making and  monitoring, planning and development, and\nadministration and finance. MFARD is increasingly becoming aware of the need to improve its\ninstitutional and technical capacities and is keen to develop the ability to efficiently manage the\nfisheries resources and reduce the emphasis on welfare activities. A number of other public and\nprivate \ninclude  nongovernment\nthe \norganizations/community-based  organizations,  training  institutes,  and  fisheries  cooperatives,\nwhich  are  mostly  active  in  providing  needed  services  and  support  to  fishing  communities,\nparticularly in the areas of small-scale credit, employment generation, and welfare activities.\n\ninstitutions  are \n\nsector.  These \n\ninvolved \n\nin \n\n2.\nCCD  is  the  agency  mandated  to  exercise  overall  responsibility  for  activities  within  the\ncoastal zone. CCD originated as the Coast Protection Unit within the Colombo Port Commission\nin 1963, evolved into the Coast Conservation Division of MFARD in 1978, and was upgraded to\na department with the coming into force of the Coast Conservation Act (CCA) in 1983. Its main\nfunctions, as provided in the CCA, are (i) the survey of  the coastal  zone and preparation  of  a\ncoastal zone management plan;  (ii)  regulation and  control  of  development activities  within  the\ncoastal zone; and (iii) formulation and execution of schemes of work for coast conservation  in\nthe  coastal  zone.  Since  its  creation,  the  core  activity  of  CCD  has  been  the  regulation  and\ncontrol  of  development  activities  within  the  coastal  zone  by  requiring  permits  to  be  obtained\nfrom  the  director  of  the  department  before  any  development  in  a  specific  coastal  area  is\nundertaken.  CCD  is  organized  into  three  operational  divisions:  (i)  Planning,  Research,  and\nDesign  Division;  (ii)  Works  Division;  and  (iii)  Coastal  Resources  Management  Division.  CCD\npublished its policy framework Coastal 2000 \u2013 Recommendation for  a  Resource  Management\nStrategy for Sri  Lanka\u2019s  Coastal  Region  in  1992,  and  the  Coastal  Zone  Management  Plan  in\n1997. CCD plays a lead role in the formulation and implementation of special plans, programs,\nand  projects  (including  multisector,  interagency  initiatives  such  as  special  area  management\n(SAM). CCD follows the guidelines and recommendations made in its strategic plans, but needs\nmore  trained  staff  at  all  levels  to  implement  its  policy.  CCD  has  no  field  staff  of  its  own  and\ncarries  out  its  enforcement action using  the  district secretariat  and  the  local  police  force.  The\nWorks Division undertakes most of the physical works for erosion protection.\n\nDFAR is the largest of MFARD's functional organizations and is the main implementing\n3.\nagency  for  the  administration,  development,  regulation,  and  monitoring  of  fisheries  and  living\naquatic resources. It is also responsible for extension and other technical and welfare services\nto fishing communities. The department is charged with the administration and enforcement of\nthe Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act of 1991 (or the Fisheries Act) and related ordinances,\npolicies,  development  and  regulation  of  fishing  through  the  issuance  of  licenses  and  permits,\nand  inspection  and  monitoring  of  fishery  activities  in  general.  DFAR  has  four  divisions:\n\n\fAppendix 6, page 2\n\n(i) Industry,  (ii)  Management,  (iii)  Administration,  and  (iv)  Finance.  In  the  past,  DFAR  was\nmainly engaged in the provision of welfare services. Only in the last four years has DFAR been\nin  charge  of  the  administration  and  enforcement  of  the  Fisheries  Act  (policies,  licensing,\nregulation,  monitoring).  The  Six-Year  Fishery  Development  Program  1999-2004  proposes  a\nbetter  and  efficient  reorganization  for  a  stronger  and  more  autonomous  DFAR  to  exclusively\nundertake regulation, enforcement, extension, and management.\n\n4.\nNARA,  the  research  arm  of  MFARD,  was  established  under  the  NARA  Act  No.  54  of\n1981,  which  emphasizes  its  responsibility  for  development  and  management  of  all  living  and\nnonliving aquatic  resources.  It  was  created as a  semiautonomous  institution  within  MFARD  in\n1981,  and  the  research  functions  were  transferred  to  it  from  the  ministry  in  1982.  NARA  is\noverseen by a governing board responsible for administration and general functions. Technical\nand scientific matters are supervised by a Science and Technical Committee.\n\n5.\nThe Ceylon Fishery Harbours Corporation (CFHC) established in 1972 under the State\nIndustrial Corporations Act of 1957 is under the supervision of MFARD. CFHC is charged with\nthe  responsibility  for  construction,  operation,  and  management  of  fishery  harbors  and  related\nfacilities which, up to that time, had been the responsibility of the Ceylon Fisheries Corporation.\nThe  main  objectives  of  CFHC  were  amended  in  March  1997  to  address  a  number  of\nadministrative  difficulties.  CFHC  is now  in  charge  of  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  seven\nfishery  harbors  and  22  anchorages,  and  is  responsible  for  cost  recovery  of  the  services\nprovided so that the harbors will ultimately be self-financing for operational purposes. CFHC is\ndivided  into  six  divisions:  (i)  Civil  Engineering,  (ii)  Mechanical  Engineering,  (iii)  Finance,  (iv)\nLegal, (v) Supplies, and (vi) Administration. Since 1995 CFHC is more business oriented, and\nworks  towards  cost  recovery  of  the  services  provided.  It  published  its  Corporate  Plan  1998-\n2002 in 1998.\n\n\fNo.\n\nComponents/Activities\n\nYear 1\n2\n3\n\n1\n\n4\n\n5\n\n8\n\n9\n\n12\n\n13\n\n16\n\n17\n\nYear 3\n10\n11\n\nYear 4\n14\n15\n\nYear 5\n18\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n23\n\n24\n\nYear 6\n22\n\nYear 2\n6\n7\n\nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE\n\nA.

To\ngenerate the desired information on the socioeconomic conditions and needs/demands of the target\nbeneficiaries,  the  RSA  of  750  households  employed  a  combination  of  structured  surveys  and\nstakeholder workshops and focus group discussions (FGDs) among selected communities within\nthe identified project sites. The results of the RSA surveys and FGDs were analyzed and, together\nwith other pertinent secondary information from the district and divisional secretary division (DSD)\noffices, discussed with representatives of local institutions and selected coastal communities and\ndistricts within the project area.\n\n2.\n\nThe RSA was conducted to\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nidentify the potential beneficiaries, including women, children, and vulnerable groups,\nlikely to be affected by the Project;\nidentify and describe the status of the target beneficiaries to describe their physical\nlocation and present socioeconomic characteristics and conditions. The information\nwill serve as benchmark against which future improvements could be compared;\nanalyze the target populations' need or demand for the project and gauge the level\nof contribution they are willing to make to become involved in it;\ngenerate  information  to be used as inputs in the design of project activities and \nimplementation  arrangements  that  will  permit  community  participation  and\ninvolvement; and\nprovide the basis for the analysis of the social dimensions of the proposed Project,\nincluding  gender  issues  and  concerns,  beneficiary  participation,  and  possible \ninvolvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  community-based\norganizations (CBOs) in implementation, and for the design of measures to prevent\nnegative  economic  or  social  impacts  of  the  proposed  project  components  and\nactivities on the target beneficiaries.\n\nB.\n\nOverview of the Project Area\n\nThe proposed project area extends from Puttalam district in the northwest to Tangalle district\n3.\nin the south. Home to nearly half of the country\u2019s population, the area (mainly coastal areas in the\nsix districts) is heavily populated and has a significant marine fishing population. According to the\n1996 census, active fishers number around 50,000 between Kalpitiya in the northwest and Kirinda\nin the southeast, and there may be around 60,000 fishers in the rest of the country (east and north).\nThe percentage of active fishers in the population of each fisheries district varies within a narrow\nrange of 22.4 percent in Kalmunai to 27 percent in Puttalam. The average fisher household has 4.8\nmembers (range=4.4-5.1), with on the average 1.2 fishers per household. Fishers with fishing crafts\nin each district vary between 2.2 in Chilaw and 8.4 in Kalmunai, with the overall average at around\n4.0. Fishers are predominantly male (99 percent) and 15 percent are typically migrant fishers. The\ndistribution of households in the project area by annual income is in Table A10.1.

A main highway  runs  along  the coast from north to south and serves as the main link\namong the districts. A railway from Colombo to Matara, runs parallel to the road along the coast.\nWhile there are internal feeder roads, most of the fishing industry use the main road. The coast\nprovides a source of livelihood to the majority of the coastal population, other sources of employment\nbeing agriculture and manufacturing in the more industrialized areas. The tourism sector, which is\nlargely built around the splendid beaches and marine sanctuaries, is crucially linked to the coastal\nenvironment. As a result, demands from the fishing industry and the tourist trade compete for the\nexisting infrastructure. The available infrastructure for the fisherfolk is rudimentary. The ongoing\nFisheries Sector Development Project funded by the Bank is the only project providing support for\nthe rehabilitation of old and establishment of new landing and infrastructure facilities. Still, ice and\nother support services like repair of boats are difficult to access. As a result, the main demand of the\npopulation is for more infrastructure facilities in the project area.\n\n\fAppendix 10, page 3\n\nHousing  exists  for  the  fishing  communities,  but  the  quality  varies  widely  throughout  the\n5.\nproject area, with permanent houses only for the more affluent fishing families. In many areas the\nfishing community live in shanties and have little or no essential services like water and sanitation.\nThe communities that depend on the lagoons and wetlands encroach on the lagoons and are a\ncause of water pollution and destruction of the mangroves. While there is adequate availability of\nbasic services like health and education (as evidenced by the high literacy rates) in the project area,\nthere  is  a  demand  for additional sanitary facilities and safe drinking water facilities. There is  no\napparent shortage of food or malnutrition. In fact, many of the households enjoy luxury items like\nrefrigerators and television sets. Table A10.3 gives details on infrastructure and other services in the\ndifferent districts.\n\nTable A10.3: Availability of Infrastructure and Other Services\n\nInfrastructure and Facilities\n\nDegree of Availability by District (%)\n\nPuttalam Gampaha Colombo Kalutara\n\nGalle\n\nHambantota\n\nHealth Center\nHospital\nSchool\nCommunity Center\nSports Center\nPiped Water\nElectricity\nCommunity Facility\nRoads\n\n86\n90\n98\n63\n40\n44\n88\n62\n91\n\n84\n93\n95\n53\n51\n75\n84\n57\n87\n\n95\n97\n94\n74\n68\n78\n92\n69\n94\n\n63\n59\n91\n32\n30\n48\n74\n55\n84\n\n92\n97\n97\n30\n34\n74\n85\n65\n96\n\n72\n64\n85\n36\n33\n56\n82\n63\n92\n\n6.\nCredit is provided by a variety of agencies: commercial  banks, credit  cooperatives, NGO\ninstitutions,  etc.    Different  types  of  credit  programs  have  been  launched  by  the  Government  to\nencourage a process of economic development and to create employment opportunities. Response\nto  credit  for  small  and  medium-scale  enterprises  has  been  very  encouraging.  Credit  for\nmicroenterprise and self-employment has also been extended by rural banks, credit cooperatives,\nand the NGOs. These institutions have largely served the fishing community as general experience\nshows that the poorer fishing communities do not find it easy to access credit from commercial\nbanks because of procedures and the need for collateral. Agencies such as SANASA and Sarvodaya\nEconomic Enterprises Development Services have been successful in delivering microcredit and\nsmall loans to this group.  Repayment is, on the whole, reportedly satisfactory.\n\nD.\n\nLivelihood Activities\n\n7.\nUnemployment  in  the  project  area  cannot  be  said  to  be  widespread  even  though  many\nfamilies received State aid. Partial employment is the main reason for the low income levels. The\nRSA  found  that  many  fishing  families  enjoyed  income  only  from  the  men\u2019s  work.  The  women\ncontributed little to the family income. Seasonal factors affecting the fishing industry, and lack of\nsuitable alternative livelihood activities are a major cause of poverty in the coastal areas. As a result,\nthe population resorts to destructive extraction methods, which deplete resources. Depending on\nwhether the district is near Colombo or not, there is potential for industrial employment (in garments\nfactories etc), which many prefer but only a few can get. The Social Development Division of the\nMinistry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development (MFARD) conducts training programs for\nwomen and assists them to find employment or establish new businesses. MFARD has several\nprograms to develop low-cost housing for fishing communities. A major portion of its capital budget\nfor 1999 is allocated for new housing development. Through the training and skills development\n\n\fAppendix 10, page 4\n\nprogram,  the  Project  will  provide  training  to  fisherfolk,  particularly  women,  to  enhance  their\nemployment  opportunities. The  Project will target poor households and link training to meet  the\nemployment demand in the different locations. \n\n While the Government recognizes that alternative livelihood activities must be encouraged\n8.\nto relieve the pressure on the coastal resources, there is limited potential for this. Therefore two\ntypes of action are called for. First, there must be a way of educating the population about the need\nfor conservation and the benefits to be derived from reducing postharvest losses through adoption\nof better fish-handling methods. Second, there is a need for concerted efforts to identify activities\nto supplement family income, especially since a majority of the poorer families depend on fishing\nincome  and  even  the  relatively  higher  income  families  receive  supplemental  income  from\nremittances from abroad. Skills development through training and adequate marketing facilities in\naddition to credit are essential prerequisites for such efforts to succeed. \n\nE.\n\nBeneficiary Involvement and Voluntary Organizations\n\nA  number  of  CBOs  and  NGOs  are  operating  in  the  project  area.  They  can  be  broadly\n9.\nclassified  as  welfare  organizations,  credit  societies,  lagoon  fisher  societies,  and  community\ndevelopment  institutions.  Many  are local organizations and some are branches of  national-level\ninstitutions. Interestingly, many  provide  extension-type  support  alongside  government  agencies.\nGenerally the institutions seem to work in close cooperation with government agencies and externally\nfunded projects. The NGOs seem to have broad-based membership, but not all members appear\nto be actively involved in day-to-day matters. There seem to be an awareness of the usefulness of\nCBOs and willingness to participate in development programs through such bodies. But financial\nsupport is still expected from the government. Lagoon fisher societies expressed a willingness to\nmanage lagoons if the government assisted with canal clearance, dredging, and zoning.\n\n10.\nThe RSA found a readiness on the part of the fishing community to share in the costs of\nestablishing landing facilities. The Government, based on the recommendations of a Bank-financed\nTA grant, has introduced user fees in some of the fishing harbors and  expects to introduce this\nnationwide  in  due  time.  The  fishing  community  seems  willing  to  pay  for  the  operation  and\nmaintenance (O&M) costs of maintaining these facilities, in view of the obvious advantages they\nbring. The management of one of the fishing harbors in Beruwela is also being undertaken by the\nstakeholders through the formation of an advisory committee, and a model may evolve for adoption\nin other ports and harbors. \n\n11.\nThe RSA  concluded that  there is minimal interest generally in the issues of conservation\nand even coastal erosion is not seen  as a major problem by those who are inland. One explanation\nfor this lack of interest in environmental degradation and resource depletion could be that the lack\nof basic amenities and services for the fishing industry is seen as a more immediate problem. At the\nsame time, the experience of the Government in special area management (SAM) planning has\nmixed results. In Rekawa, where the combined results of organizing the local community through the\nRekawa Foundation and the implementation of measures recommended by the SAM process have\nproduced visible results, there is a commitment to the need for better resource management among\nthe beneficiary population. As the  population has already suffered due to environmental degradation,\nthere is greater ownership of regeneration efforts. The conclusion, from the RSA and FGDs and the\nstakeholder workshops, is for the Government to pursue the SAM process vigorously and undertake\nsteps to organize and involve the local beneficiaries in the process to ensure long-term sustainability.\n\nSeveral  agencies  are  already  working  in  the  project  areas.  There  are  international\n12.\norganizations  such  as  the  World  Conservation  Union  and  some  other  agencies  specializing  in\nenvironment  protection  activities.  In  addition,  several  local  institutions  involved  in  community\n\n\fAppendix 10, page 5\n\ndevelopment  activities  command  the  confidence  of  the  local  population  and  have  established\nthemselves  on  a  sustainable  basis.  These  agencies  have  expressed  keen  interest  in  being\nassociated with project implementation activities. \n\nF.\n\nGender Issues\n\n13.\nWomen  in  the  coastal  areas  are  engaged  in  a  variety  of  tasks,  the  primary  ones  being\nhousekeeping  and  child  rearing,  which  they  have  to  perform  before  they  could  engage  in  other\nactivities. While men are generally involved in economic activities, women spend much time carrying\nout domestic chores, implying a delineation of responsibilities within the household. Men are typically\nexpected to be the main breadwinner (engaging  in fishing, processing, and trading activities) while\nthe women attend to domestic duties/activities and in limited income-augmenting activities such as\nfish drying, vending, and some agriculture-related activities.\n\n14.\nWomen have recently become actively involved in the establishment of women\u2019s groups\nconcerned with community affairs and welfare and, thus, have the potential to become a significant\nsocial  force  in  the  community.  There  is  increasing  need  for  women  to  contribute  to  household\nincome; however, they lack the required skills. Women in the coastal communities show a high level\nof  awareness  of  shared  problems,  which  indicates  a  willingness  to  cooperate  and  work  toward\ncommon development goals. In some areas, women\u2019s groups have been purposely organized by\nNGOs  for  credit  assistance,  development  of  income-generating  activities,  skills  training,  and\nprovision of social infrastructure.\n\n\fECONOMIC ANALYSIS\n\nAppendix 11, page 1\n\nA.\n\nBasic Approach and Framework\n\n1.\nThe Project is intended to address the problem of severe coastal erosion along the west\ncoast of Sri Lanka as well as introduce sustainable coastal resource management into the area.\nIn  addition  to  the  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  as  a  whole,  this  appendix  focuses  on  the\nviability of investments in the various project components, namely: (i) coastline stabilization, (ii)\ncoastal  environment  and  resources  management,  and  (iii)  fisheries  management  and  harbor\nconstruction/rehabilitation.  The  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  following  the  Bank\u2019s\nGuidelines for Economic Analysis for Projects.\n\n2.\nAll  costs  and  benefits  were  broken  down  into  their  traded,  nontraded,  labor,  and  tax\nfactors and converted to world price values. Traded goods were expressed in economic terms\nusing an exchange rate of SLRs70.81 against the US dollar (as of the summer of 1999).  Non-\ntraded  goods  and  services  were  converted  to  economic  values  using  a  standard  conversion\nfactor (SCF) of 0.9.  Labor costs were also expressed in economic terms using a shadow wage\nrate of 0.8 and SCF of 0.9.1  Project implementation is planned for a period of five years and the\nlife of the Project is assumed to be 20 years including the time of implementation.\n\nB. \n\nEconomic Analysis2\n\n1.\n\nCoastline Stabilization\n\na.\n\nCosts\n\n3.\nCoastline  stabilization  efforts  are  to  be  carried  out  in  seven  segments  (totaling  52\nkilometers)  on  the  southwestern  coast  of  Sri  Lanka.    The  works  will  include  a  substantial\nelement  of  sand  nourishment,  some  dredging,  and  the  construction  of  a  variety  of  physical\nstructures such as breakwaters, groins and revetments.  A breakdown of these costs is shown\nin Table A11.1. In addition, maintenance costs will be incurred throughout the life of the Project\nonce the physical interventions have been completed.\n\nTable A11.1:  Civil Works for each Project Site\n($ million)\n\nProject Sites\n\nMaha Oya\nColombo North\nMoratuwa\nWadduwa\nKalu Ganga\nBeruwela\nHikkaduwa\n       Total\n\nBeach\nNourishment\nand Dredging\n\nPhysical\nStructures\n\nOverhead\n\nTotal\n\n9.83\n0.41\n\n0.77\n2.27\n0.91\n1.64\n15.83\n\n2.49\n2.73\n0.28\n\n2.88\n2.44\n1.38\n12.20\n\n0.88\n0.43\n0.03\n0.07\n0.59\n0.34\n0.26\n2.60\n\n13.20\n3.57\n0.31\n0.84\n5.74\n3.69\n3.28\n30.63\n\n                                           \n1\n\n2\n\nInvestment costs both with and without the Project were similarly converted into economic values.\nAdditional details of the economic analysis can be found in Supplemental Appendix A.\n\n\fAppendix 11, page 2\n\n4.\nThe level of coastal erosion and degradation in the project area is severe.  Even without\nthe  Project,  the  Government  and  the  private  sector  will  incur  substantial  costs  in  attempts  to\nprotect  particular  locations.  The  Government  gives  high  priority  to  facilities  such  as  schools,\nroads, railways, telecommunication facilities, religious places, and historical sites, while private\nproperty owners will try to preserve homes, hotels, and industrial premises.  Without the Project,\nthe  methods  of  emergency  protection  are  likely  to  continue  to  be  the  unconnected  use  of\nrevetments, dredging, etc.  Such methods are expected to merely move the problem to adjacent\nparts  of  the  coast  and  merely  delay  the  damage  to  the  site.    Interventions  planned  for  the\nProject, on the other hand, are intended to stabilize the entire length of coast without shifting the\nproblem elsewhere.  One benefit (or cost decrease) of the Project, then, is the elimination of the\nmore haphazard methods of various site protections that would take place without the Project.\n\n5.\nBased  on  past  investment  efforts  by  both  the  public  and  the  private  sectors  and\ndepending on the extent of the erosion, certain levels of combined without-Project investment of\nboth  public  and  private  sectors  are  assumed  at  each  site.  Since  the  erosion  situation  is\nparticularly serious in Maha Oya-Lansigama, it is expected that  the  without-Project  investment\nat  this  site  would double  in  the  second  year  (of  what  would  have  been  the  project  cycle)  and\nincrease  at  15  percent  annually  until  the  10th  year.    For  the  other  six  sites,  the  total  capital\ninvestment is assumed to increase at 50 percent initially, about 33 percent in the third year and\n10 percent per year thereafter.\n\nb.\n\nBenefits\n\nDirect  benefits  of  the  coastal  stabilization  subcomponent  are  assumed  to  be  derived\n6.\nfrom  land  that  would  be  saved  by  the  intervention  (but  not  saved  in  the  without-Project\nscenario).  These  benefits  include  (i)  houses  and  buildings  on  the  land  to  be  saved;\n(ii) avoidance of removal and administration costs, which would have been incurred if the land\nhad eroded; (iii) avoidance of the interruption of people\u2019s work that would have been caused by\nthe erosion; and (iv) the opportunity cost of the land.\n\n7.\nEstimates  were  made  of  the  amount  of  land  expected  to  be  saved  each  year  by  the\nProject  and  of  the  value  of  buildings  (per  unit  of  that  land)  at  each  of  the  seven  sites.  The\nremoval  and  administration  costs  were  estimated  at  15  percent  of  the  economic  value  of  the\nbuildings. It was assumed that people who would have been affected by the projected erosion\nthrough the loss of their home or other building would lose three months or work and income if\nthe erosion were to take place. On agricultural  land, the  Project  would prevent the  loss  of  net\nincome from  coconut  trees and  rice  paddy.   Beach  erosion  causes  the destruction  of  coconut\ntrees  and  a  rise  in  salinity  damaging  to  rice  cultivation  along  a  coastal  belt.    Net  economic\nbenefits  from  coconut  cultivation  have  been  calculated  at  SLRs27,972  per  hectare  and  those\nfrom paddy at SLRs42,161 per hectare.\n\n8.\nWhile not specific to any site, the overall coastal stabilization subcomponent is expected\nto have significant impacts on the tourism industry, the second largest foreign exchange earner\nin Sri Lanka.  Without the Project, erosion will not be effectively prevented and the beaches will\nbe increasingly covered with revetments.  As beaches are perhaps one of the most prominent\nfeatures of the country\u2019s tourist industry, a major quality decrease in the coastal area is likely to\nreduce  the  number  of  tourist arrivals  as  well  as  reduce  per  tourist  spending  in  the  country  as\nhigh-income travelers choose other vacation destinations.  A conservative estimate is that both\ntourist  arrivals  and  per  tourist  spending  would  decrease  by  1  percent  if  the  beaches  were  to\ndeteriorate as expected without the Project.  Forecasts indicate that in 2005, tourist arrivals are\nexpected to be between 410,000 and 450,000 and per tourist spending between $630 and $650\n\n\fAppendix 11, page 3\n\n(in constant prices). If so, the potential  loss  prevented by  the  Project  is about  $5.1  million per\nyear.\n\nc.\n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return\n\nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the coastal stabilization subcomponent is\n\n9.\n17.2 percent.  Without the tourism benefits, the EIRR would be only about 5 percent.\n\n2.\n\nCoastal Environment and Resource Management (CERM)\n\n10.\nThe CERM subcomponent is designed to address the unsustainable and conflicting uses\nof  coastal  and  marine  resources  in  eight  selected  sites  along  the  southwest  coast.  The\ninvestment  activities  involve  mainly  the  planning  and  implementation  of  strategies  to  maintain\ncoastal  and  marine  resources  use  at  present  levels  and  avert  further  degradation  and\nunsustainable use of the resources.\n\na.\n\nCosts\n\n11.\n\nInvestment costs for the CERM sites are in Table A11.2.\n\nTable A11.2:  CERM Investment Cost for Each Project Site\n\nProject Sites\n\nInvestment Cost\n($ million)a\n\nNegombo Lagoon\nLunawa Lagoon\nMadu Ganga Estuary and Lagoon\nUnawatuna Bay\nKalametiyab\nBar Reef\nHikkaduwa\nMawella\n\n      Total\n\n                1.81\n                1.63\n                0.31\n                0.16\n                0.93\n                0.19\n                0.14\n                0.46\n\n                5.63\n\na   Does not include investments at the national level.\nb\n   This site actually includes two locations, Tangalle and Hambantota, which are\n\n                                  combined in this analysis due to their proximity and similarity to each other.\n\nThe  incremental  benefits  of  CERM  investments  arise  from  the  difference  between\n12.\nresource use with the Project and the predicted nonsustainable resource use that will continue\nto develop without the Project.  It is assumed that the nonsustainable use without the Project will\nlead to an incremental loss of 1 percent per year  of the habitat/resource  value.  This assumed\nlevel of normal loss is well below the 2.5 percent to 3 percent rate of deforestation in Sri Lanka\nand about equal to the annual loss of coral cover in the Hikkaduwa area.3\n\nOnly some of the CERM benefits can be reasonably quantified and valued for inclusion\n13.\nin  this  analysis.  Depending  on  the  site,  these  include  sustainable  utilization  of  mangrove\nvegetation-based products and fisheries products, sustainable recreation uses, and ecotourism\n\n                                           \n3\n\nWhite, A.T., V.

These  include  the protection of  scarce  turtle  nesting habitats, and the  benefits from\navoided health damage and some increased amenity and property values.\n\nb.\n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR)\n\n14.\nThe  EIRRS  for  the  CERM  component  are  in  Table  A11.3.  The  results  indicate  that,\nexcept for the Mawella and Bar Reef sites, CERM investments are economically justifiable at all\nsites --- with EIRRs above 12 percent. In the case of Mawella, the most important benefit arising\nfrom managing the natural resources is the uniqueness of the area for turtle nesting, which has\nnot been valued.  The Bar Reef area, with  EIRR  at  11 percent,  is  marginal.  The  EIRR for  the\noverall  CERM  investment  is  21  percent,  suggesting  the  economic  viability  of  CERM\ninvestments. For all of the CERM sites (including Bar Reef and Mawella) only those aspects of\npossible benefits that are quantifiable were included in the EIRR calculations. Other biodiversity\nand environmental benefits that may occur but are not quantifiable were not calculated.\n\nTable A11.3:   Results of the CERM Economic Analysis\n\nSite\n\n1.  Negombo Lagoon\n2.

These  facilities  will  provide\nservices  to  both  boats  with  inboard  engines  (IBEs)  and  smaller  boats  with  outboard  engines\n(OBEs). The proportion of boats capable of multiday fishing trips is expected to increase due to\nthe Project, reducing the pressure on the fisheries close to the shore.\n\n17.\nCosts.  Construction will include the building of breakwaters, quays, and various shore\nfacilities  at  the  various  sites.  Capital  costs  (excluding  contingencies)  in  Chilaw,  Hambantota,\nAmbalangoda, and Kalametiya were estimated at $1.24 million, $3.88 million, $3.35 million, and\n$3.09 million, respectively. All prices  are expressed in 1999 constant terms. All four subprojects\n\n                                           \n4\n\nInformation on resource values was obtained from a variety of sources.  For more information, see Supplemental\nAppendix A.\n\n\fAppendix 11, page 5\n\nwill  be  developed  over  a  period  of  two  to  three  years,  beginning  in  year  2001.  The  foreign\nexchange component of the capital cost is assumed to be 45 percent.\n\n18.\nStaff costs for harbor masters, assistant harbor masters, clerical, security and labor staff\nhave been calculated for each facility. An overhead of $440/month has been estimated to cover\nutilities and other overheads.  Staff costs and overheads are assumed to be phased in over the\nfirst five years.  Maintenance costs that will be incurred in the regular maintenance of structures\nand  equipment are assumed at 1 percent  of  the  civil  works  cost  and  3  percent  of  the  cost  of\ncapital goods. In addition, it is assumed that capital goods will be replaced every seven years.\nA sum of $11,000 will be invested in periodic dredging (every three years).\n\n19.\nBenefits.  In Chilaw, the harbor capacity for IBE  boats  is expected to  rise from 243 to\n300\u2014but  with  a  change  in  composition  emphasizing  multiday  boats  (rising  from  133  to  250\nwhile one-day boats will decrease from 110 to 50). OBE boats are expected to stay the same.\nAt  Hambantota,  IBE  boats  are  expected  to  rise  from  11  to  150  (though  some  of  these  may\nsimply  be  transferred  from  a  nearby  area).    Ambalangoda  anchorage  has  been  designed  to\naccommodate  55  IBE  boats  and  60  OBE  boats,  while  Kalametiya  will  provide  for  anchorage\nspace for 60 IBE and 70 OBE boats.\n\n20.\nThe  number  of  fishing  trips  depends  largely  on  weather  conditions.  Without  suitable\nanchoring and berthing facilities, the operation of multiday boats is restricted to nine months of\nthe  year,  with  an  average  of  three  to  four  trips  per  month.    Day  boats  make,  on  average,  12\ntrips/month during the monsoon period (six months) and 20 trips/month during the remainder of\nthe year, totaling about 192 trips/year. With  harbor facilities,  it  is assumed  that  multiday boats\ncould operate for 10 months, averaging 30 trips/year.  The number of trips made by day boats\nduring the monsoon period is expected to increase to 15, increasing the total number of trips by\na boat to 210/year.\n\nThe typical catch per trip by a multiday boat is assumed to be 1.5 tons (t), whereas the\n21.\ncatch by a day boat is assumed to be 0.2 t.  The catch per trip will remain unchanged with the\nProject.  These trip and catch statistics apply to all four harbors/anchorages.\n\nThe Project will result in an increase in fish landings due to the larger number of boats,\n22.\nthe higher proportion of multiday boats, and the greater number of annual trips each boat will be\nable to make (on average). The economic value of incremental fish landings was calculated as\nthe  difference  between  the  beach  value  of  the  fish  and  the  corresponding  operation  and\nmaintenance  (O&M)  costs  of  boats  (including  the  crew  share).  The  beach  value  of  fish\napplicable to the economic analysis is the free on board price adjusted to the site (i.e., port gate\nprice)  by  deducting  the  cost  of  harbor  fees,  processing,  transport,  and  handling,  and  was\nestimated  at  SLRs118.31/kg  of  fish.    By  subtracting  the  economic  value  of  the  O&M  cost  of\nboats, the value added from the incremental fish landings is calculated at SLRs22.31/kg.\n\n23.\nEIRR.  A summary of the calculated EIRRs for the various harbors and anchorages is in\nTable  A11.4.  In  the  costing  of  the  harbors,  certain  figures  have  been  segregated  by  the\nindividual harbor. These costs have been used in the individual harbor EIRR calculations. There\nare  additional  overall  costs  of  this  subcomponent  that  cannot  be  easily  separated  by  the\nindividual  harbor.  These  are  costs  supervision,  survey  and  equipment  and  the  international\nconsultants for implementation. These costs have been included in the EIRR calculation for the\noverall component as stated in para. 28.\n\n\fTable A11.4:  EIRR of Harbor and Anchorage Subprojects\n\nAppendix 11, page 6\n\nSite\n\n1.

The  cost  of  all  activities  under  this  subcomponent  was  estimated  to  be\n\n24.\n$845,000.  These expenditures will be spread over the five years of project implementation.\n\n25.\nBenefits. The fisheries management and fish quality improvement activities are expected\nto generate three broad benefits: (i) increase in the harvest of fish; (ii) reduction of losses during\nfish handling, transport, and marketing; and (iii) an incremental increase in the value of fish due\nto its improved quality. The increase in fish harvest is a result of the shift in effort from offshore\nfishing  to  deepsea  fishing,  and  is  not  a  result  of  an  increase  in  the  absolute  fishing  effort.\nReduction in losses and the consequent increase in value of landed fish will result primarily from\nfish quality improvement activities.\n\n26.\nThe  increase  in  fish  yield  due  to  the  Project  was  determined  after  first  projecting  the\nnationwide  annual  fish  landings  up  to  year  2011  based  on  national-level  statistics.  Having\nconsidered  the  trend  in fish  landings  over  the  past  25,  10,  and  5  years,  the  latter  period  was\nselected  to  project  trends  through  year  2011.    A  key  assumption  in  the  analysis  is  that  0.1\npercent  of  national  fish  landings  will  be  affected  by  project  interventions.  Since  the  project\ninterventions  target  many  locations  along  the  western  and  southwestern  coastal  belt,  the\nassumption  is considered conservative.\n\nEIRR.    The  EIRR  calculated  according  to  the  above  assumptions  yields  a  value  of\n\n27.\n30 percent.\n\nc.\n\nCalculated Returns for the Full Component\n(Harbors plus Fisheries)\n\nThe  combined  EIRR  for  the  full  fisheries  management  and  fish  quality  improvement\n28.\ncomponent  (including  both  the  harbor  subcomponent  and  the  fisheries  subcomponent)  is\nestimated at 12.1 percent.\n\n4. \n\nEconomic Analysis of the Whole Project\n\n29.\nFor  the  Project  as  a  whole,  the  20-year  net  benefit  streams  of  each  of  the  three\ncomponents  were  combined.    In  addition,  the  costs  of  institutional  strengthening  and  project\nadministration  were  included.    The  resultant  full-Project  EIRR  is  calculated  as  15.3  percent\n(Table A11.5).\n\n\fAppendix 11, page 7\n\nSensitivity  analyses  were  conducted  for  the  overall  Project  as  well  as  for  the  three\n\n30.\ncomponents. The results are in Table A11.6.\n\n31.\nFor the Project as a whole, either an increase in costs or a decrease in benefits  by 20\npercent  reduces  the  EIRR  to  just  over  the  acceptable  level  of  12  percent.    If  both  costs  are\nraised and benefits are decreased (by 20 percent), the EIRR falls to a weak 9.7 percent. A two-\nyear  delay  in  benefits  (keeping  costs  constant)  results  in  an  EIRR  of  11.5  percent.  For  the\ncoastline  stabilization  component,  only  a  simultaneous  20  percent  increase  in  cost  and\ndecrease in benefits results in an EIRR of 12.1 percent. The coastal environment and resource\nmanagement component results are  robust  under  all of  the  sensitivity analysis  scenarios.  The\nharbors and fisheries management component, on the other hand, has an EIRR  of  well under\n12 percent in each of the four sensitivity scenarios. This component is the most susceptible to\npoor results if anything goes wrong.\n\nC. \n\nOther Benefits\n\nin \n\ninvolved \n\ninteragency \n\nthe \nlinkages \n\nThe Project  is expected to have numerous  nonquantifiable benefits not  included  in  the\n32.\nabove analysis. The principal such benefits are (i) institutional strengthening of MFARD and its\nimplementation  of  project-related  activities;  (ii)\nkey  agencies  directly \nenhancement  of \nthe  coordination  and\nin \nthrough  cooperation \nimplementation  of  coastal  resource  management  plans  and  activities;  (iii)  improved  and\neffective  resource  management  and  protection;  (iv)  enhanced  beneficiary  participation  in\nresource  management  and  project  implementation;  (v)  establishment  of  strong  partnerships\namong  local  government,  the  communities,  and  NGOs/CBOs  in  community-based  resource\nmanagement;  (vi)  increased  food  supply,  improved  nutrition,  and  health;  and  (vii)  improved\ncommunity  welfare.  Other  nonquantifiable  benefits  include  the  retardation  of  coastal  resource\ndepletion  and  degradation \nresource\nmanagement as well as the promotion of  beneficiary  participation  in  community-based  coastal\nresource management and in project implementation.\n\nthrough  effective  environmental  protection  and \n\n\fTable A11.5: Total Project EIRR\n(SLRs million)\n\nAppendix 11, page 8\n\nBase Case\nYear\n\nCoast Stabilization\n\nCERM\n\nHarbors and Fisheries\n\nCosts\n\nBenefits\n\nNet Benefits\n\nCosts\n\nBenefits Net Benefits\n\nCosts\n\nBenefits Net Benefits\n\nInstitutional\nCosts\n\nProject\nNet Benefits\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n\nEIRR\n\n177.0\n226.8\n871.8\n422.0\n260.5\n(95.1)\n(147.0)\n(126.5)\n55.0\n(144.4)\n(125.7)\n(127.3)\n(210.2)\n(158.8)\n(10.5)\n(179.8)\n(197.3)\n(124.8)\n(147.8)\n(179.8)\n\n               \n-\n               \n1.0\n               \n4.9\n               \n8.7\n              \n11.4\n            \n372.9\n            \n373.3\n            \n373.8\n            \n374.2\n            \n374.6\n            \n375.1\n            \n375.5\n            \n375.9\n            \n376.4\n            \n376.8\n            \n377.2\n            \n377.6\n            \n378.1\n            \n378.5\n            \n875.8\n\n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n         \n\n(177.0)\n(225.7)\n(866.9)\n(413.3)\n(249.1)\n468.0\n520.3\n500.3\n319.2\n519.0\n500.8\n502.8\n586.1\n535.2\n387.3\n557.0\n574.9\n502.8\n526.3\n1,055.6\n\n17.2%\n\n38.4\n89.9\n197.6\n111.7\n70.4\n\n          \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n4.9\n11.4\n18.2\n26.9\n35.6\n82.5\n97.6\n110.0\n122.5\n134.9\n147.3\n159.8\n172.2\n184.7\n197.1\n209.5\n222.0\n234.4\n246.8\n259.3\n\n            \n            \n          \n            \n            \n             \n             \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n           \n\n(33.5)\n(78.5)\n(179.4)\n(84.8)\n(34.8)\n82.5\n97.6\n110.0\n122.5\n134.9\n147.3\n159.8\n172.2\n184.7\n197.1\n209.5\n222.0\n234.4\n246.8\n259.3\n\n20.6%\n\n49.2\n130.4\n292.4\n307.2\n224.8\n4.8\n4.8\n7.6\n4.8\n4.8\n4.8\n7.6\n4.8\n4.8\n4.8\n7.6\n4.8\n4.8\n4.8\n7.6\n\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n95.6\n112.6\n136.0\n144.9\n146.0\n147.4\n149.2\n151.3\n153.8\n156.9\n156.9\n156.9\n156.9\n156.9\n156.9\n156.9\n156.9\n\n(49.2)\n(130.4)\n(292.4)\n(211.7)\n(112.2)\n131.2\n140.1\n138.4\n142.6\n144.4\n146.5\n146.2\n152.1\n152.1\n152.1\n149.3\n152.1\n152.1\n152.1\n149.3\n\n12.1%\n\n(37.0)\n(96.3)\n(83.3)\n(51.7)\n(18.9)\n\n           \n           \n        \n           \n           \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n         \n\n(296.8)\n(530.9)\n(1,422.0)\n(761.4)\n(415.0)\n681.7\n758.0\n748.7\n584.3\n798.3\n794.6\n808.8\n910.5\n872.0\n736.5\n915.9\n949.0\n889.4\n925.3\n1,464.2\n\n15.3%\n\nNotes:\n1.
