The Project aim is  to  minimize  the\npotential adverse impacts of coastal erosion in critical coastal\nstretches  through  the  establishment  of  appropriate  physical\ninterventions intended to stabilize the coastline. Environmental\ndegradation in selected lagoons, that support coastal fishing will\nbe addressed by following the Special Area Management (SAM)\nplanning approach, which has been pilot-tested in Sri Lanka.\nThe Project will also encourage the sustained management and\ndevelopment  of  coastal  fisheries  resources  by  implementing\nactivities  intended  to  address  the  following  identified  issues:\noverfishing  in  coastal  waters,  the  high  percentage  of  fish\nwastage, and lack of infrastructure support facilities in specific\nlocations.  The  institutional  capabilities  of  the  concerned\nGovernment agencies and community organizations in resource\nmanagement  will  be  strengthened under  the Project  through\ninterventions  intended  to  address  the  identified  institutional\nweaknesses.\nClassification Primary     -   Environment\nEnvironmental\nAssessment Category  -   A\nAn environmental impact assessment (EIA) was undertaken and\nthe summary EIA was circulated to the Board on 29 July 1999.\nRationale Attention is urgently needed to address the following key issues\nin the Sri Lankan coastal resources sector: (i) serious erosion of\nthe coastline, especially in areas with concentrated economic\nactivity or vital infrastructure; (ii) unmanaged fishing in coastal\nand offshore areas; (iii) pollution and uncontrolled exploitation of\nlagoons  and  estuaries,  coral  reefs,  mangrove  swamps,  sea\ngrass  beds,  other  wetlands,  and  dune  systems;  and  (iv)\nwidespread poverty among the coastal population. Failure to\naccord  priority  to  these  issues  would  put  the  enormous\ncontribution  of  the  coastal  belt  to  the  economy  at  risk.  A\nsignificant percentage  of  the  population  living  in  the  coastal\nareas  obtain  their  livelihood  by  exploiting  the  fishing  and\nnonliving marine resources. Many live below the poverty line\nand unless measures are taken to improve their income levels\nand  they  are  retrained  to  undertake  alternate  livelihood\nactivities,  the pressure they exert on  the  resource  base  will\ncontinue to exacerbate the situation. Institutional reforms and\ncapacity-building efforts are required to support more efficient\nmanagement  practices.  The Government  will  not  be  able  to\nimplement  an  integrated  approach  to  the  conservation  and\nmanagement  of  coastal  resources  without  the  necessary\nadministrative capacities and legal environment.", "iii\nObjectives and Scope The  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  establish  integrated\nmanagement of coastal resources to improve their sustainability.\nThe Project will have four components: (i) coastline stabilization,\nwhich will address the problem of coastal erosion and develop\nproactive/preventive  management  schemes;  (ii)  coastal\nenvironment  and  resource  management  (CERM),  which  will\naddress problems of coastal resource degradation and include\nactivities intended to reduce pollution in lagoons and  relieve\npressure  on  coastal  resources;  (iii)  fisheries  resource\nmanagement  and  quality  improvement,  which  will  aim  at\nsustainable  coastal  fisheries  management  supported  by  the\nconstruction of harbors/anchorages and ancillary facilities that\nwill allow the improvement of fish quality and the reduction of\nhandling losses; and (iv) institutional strengthening, which will\nenhance the institutional capabilities of the Ministry of Fisheries\nand  Aquatic  Resources  Development  (MFARD),  other\nconcerned agencies, and community organizations in coastal\nand fisheries resource management.\nCost Estimates The total project cost is estimated at $80.0 million equivalent,\ncomprising about $44.0 million (55 percent) in foreign exchange\nand approximately $36.0 million (45 percent) in local currency\ncosts.\nFinancing Plan $ million\nSource  Foreign          Local          Total\nExchange     Currency       Cost     Percent\nBank 29.32 10.68 40.00     50.0\nThe Netherlands 7.31 5.45 12.76     16.0\nGovernment 7.37 19.78 27.15     33.9\nBeneficiaries - 0.09 0.09       0.1\nTotal 44.0 36.0 80.0   100.0\nLoan Amount and Terms The equivalent in various currencies of SDR 28,806,000 ($40.0\nmillion approximately) from the Bank\u2019s Special Funds resources.\nThe  amortization  period  will  be  32  years  including  a  grace\nperiod  of  8  years,  with  an  interest  charge  of  1  percent  per\nannum during  the  grace period and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter.\nPeriod of Utilization Until December 2005\nImplementation\nArrangements An interagency project steering committee will be established, to\nbe  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  MFARD  to  ensure  the  full\ncooperation of and effective liaison with the other participating or\nconcerned  Government  agencies.  Nongovernment\norganizations  (NGOs)  and  community-based  organizations\n(CBOs) will also play an important role in implementing project\nactivities  at  the  community level. For this purpose, MFARD will", "iv\nestablish  close  working  arrangements  with  NGOs/CBOs,  in\nconsultation with the Bank.\nA  project  management  office  (PMO)  will  be  established  in\nMFARD under a project director. The project director will directly\nsupervise each of the six site managers heading the field project\nimplementation units (FPIUs) at the project sites and the two\nproject implementation units (PIUs) at the Coast Conservation\nDepartment (CCD) and Ceylon Fishery Harbours Corporation\n(CFHC), who will be reporting directly to him. The FPIUs will be\nlocated  at  the  CERM  project  sites.  The  site  managers  will\ncoordinate with engineering staff at both the zonal and district\noffices  of  CCD  and  the  district  fishery  extension  officers\n(DFEOs).\nExecuting Agency Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development\nProcurement The PMO will be responsible for the procurement of all goods\nand  services  under  the  Project.  All  services,  supplies  and\nequipment  to  be  financed  by  the  Bank  will  be  procured  in\naccordance with the Bank\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Bank-\nfinanced civil works contracts estimated to cost $1.0 million and\nabove for the harbors and all such contracts for the coastline\nstabilization  component  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of\ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Other  Bank-financed  civil\nworks contracts of less than $1.0 million will be carried out by\nprequalified contractors selected under the Government\u2019s local\ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  satisfactory  to  the  Bank.  All\nBank-financed civil works contracts with a value of $500,000\nequivalent and above will be subject to prior approval by the\nBank.  Bank-financed  supply  contracts  estimated  to  cost  an\nequivalent of more than $500,000 will be awarded on the basis\nof  international  competitive  bidding.  Supply  contracts  of\n$500,000  or  less  (except  for  minor  items  costing  less  than\n$100,000 to be procured by direct purchase) will be awarded on\nthe basis of international shopping.\nConsulting Services The  Project  is  expected  to  use  207  person-months  of\ninternational  and  455  person-months  of  domestic  consulting\nservices. There is need for implementation capacity assistance\nto  both  CCD  and  CFHC  during  project  implementation.\nInstitutional support for MFARD, CCD, and CFHC for design\nand management, and supervision support for the civil works\nand expertise in areas such as the design and implementation\nof  extension  programs,  update  of  the  Coastal  Zone\nManagement Plan, design and implementation of the corporate\ntraining programs at MFARD and its key agencies, development\nof a fishery harbor operations manual, design and installation of\na data collection and management system at MFARD and its\nkey agencies, and design and conduct of orientation courses on\nfisheries  licensing  and  regulation,  are  also  necessary.

Benefits\nderived from the fisheries resources management and quality\nimprovement component were projected mainly from increased\nfish landings due to the construction of fishery harbors.\nThe principal nonquantifiable benefits consist of (i) institutional\nstrengthening of MFARD and its key agencies directly involved\nin  the  implementation  of  project-related  activities;  (ii)\nenhancement of interagency linkages through cooperation in the\ncoordination  and  implementation  of  coastal  resource\nmanagement plans and activities; (iii) improved and effective\nresource management and protection; (iv) enhanced beneficiary\nparticipation  in  resource  management  and  project\nimplementation; (v) establishment of strong partnerships among\nlocal  government,  the  communities,  and  NGOs/CBOs  in\ncommunity-based  resource  management;  (vi)  increased  food\nsupply,  improved  nutrition,  and  health;  and  (vii)  improved\ncommunity welfare.", "", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Coastal Resource Management\nProject.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. In  1997,  a  high-level  delegation  from  the  Government  of  the  Democratic  Socialist\nRepublic of Sri Lanka requested Bank assistance to address the problem of severe coastal\nerosion, especially on the west coast of Sri Lanka;  and  environmental degradation of the\nwetlands  and  lagoons  that  supported  the  regeneration  of  coastal  resources.  It  was  also\nconsidered necessary to address the indiscriminate extraction of nonliving marine resources. To\nestablish the feasibility of the project, the Bank approved in June 1998 technical assistance (TA)\nto  assist  the  Government  in  the  preparation  of  an  investment  project.1  A  comprehensive\napproach  to  the  environmental problems faced  in  the  coastal  areas  and  the  utilization  of\nresources in the coastal areas was developed through a series of project design workshops, in\nwhich a wide section of the stakeholders participated. The Government reconfirmed the high\npriority attached to this Project during the Bank\u2019s 1999 Country Programming Mission. The\nproject objectives, scope, costs, and implementation arrangements were confirmed with the\nGovernment during the Fact-Finding and  Appraisal  Missions2  in  19 April-7  May  1999  and\n14 June\u20132 July 1999, respectively. The project framework is attached as Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND3\nA. Coastal Resources Sector\n1. Economic Importance\n3. In this island nation, the 1,770-kilometer (km) long coastline is a critical lifeline that\nanchors the country's social, economic, and environmental development. The coastal zone is a\nhighly productive ecosystem that serves as an important base for the country's growth. The\nnatural ecosystems within the coastal zone are diverse, and include lagoons and estuaries,\ncoral reefs, mangrove swamps, sea grass beds, other wetlands, and dune systems. Coastal\nhabitats play an important role in the daily lives of the people in terms of livelihood, economic\noutput, and food production. The coastal zone holds approximately 24 percent of the country's\nland area and is home to about 32 percent of the country's population. The settlement of human\npopulations along the coast has occurred largely because this narrow zone is the area closest\nto many important resources, including food stocks and raw materials for construction. The\ncoastal zone has 65 percent of the island\u2019s urban areas, and accounts for nearly 80 percent of\nthe country\u2019s annual fish production and 70 percent of its total industrial output. Marine fish\nproduction peaked in 1994 and has been fluctuating between 150,000 and 157,000 tons since\nthen. With the exception of a few fish stocks, the harvest in the country's coastal waters appears\nto have reached the optimum level, and some stocks already manifest signs of overexploitation.\n4. The coastal zone hosts nearly 50 percent of the country's tourist facilities. The hotels in\ncoastal resorts, excluding the Colombo area, have almost 10,000 rooms. Major roads and rail\n                                                       \n1 TA 3034-SRI: Coastal Resource Management Project, for $850,000, approved on 25 June 1998.\n2  The Appraisal Mission comprised C.R. Rajendran, Mission Leader and Senior Project Specialist; P. Safran,\nProject Specialist; D. Utami, Economist, Environment; V.S. Rekha, Counsel; and D. Parker and C. Stere, Staff\nConsultants.\n3  CER: SRI 98029: Country Economic Review, Sri Lanka, December 1998.", "2\ntransport infrastructure are likewise located along the coastal stretch, together with the country's\ncommercial ports and fishery harbors and anchorages. Some of the richest areas of biodiversity\nin the country occur in the coastal zone and include coral reefs, extensive sea grass beds,\nmangrove forests, highly productive estuaries and lagoons, and sanctuaries that altogether\ncover an area of 160,000 hectares (ha). Moreover, substantial reserves of valuable minerals;\nnearly 100 sites of special historical, archaeological, cultural, or religious significance; and\nplaces of special scenic or recreational importance are found in the coastal zone.\n2.  Development Issues\n5. The coastal zone, which is extremely valuable to the country's economy, is also very\nfragile.  Beaches  and  coastal  stretches  are  continuously  subjected  to  wave  action  and\nincreasingly threatened by natural processes like storm surges that cause erosion or accretion.\nSand mining for construction, reef breaking for coral mining, reef dynamiting for fish,  and\nremoval of coastal vegetation exacerbate the problem. The end result is increasing coastal\nerosion and the consequent loss of usable land and associated infrastructure, houses, and\narchaeological  and  religious  sites,  all  accompanied  by  social  and  economic  losses.  The\nunmanaged growth of the tourism industry has resulted in the incorrect  siting of facilities.\nIncreased shoreline protection works, undertaken as emergency measures or in an ad hoc\nmanner by the property owners have limited the access of fishermen to beaches to berth boats\nand kept out local residents seeking recreational opportunities. Increased encroachment of\ncoastal pollution or unplanned and unauthorized development has caused direct habitat loss\nand increased public health risks due to inadequate infrastructure for sanitary sewerage and\npotable water.\n6. Government estimates in 1981/82 placed the rate of land loss through coastal erosion at\n200,000-300,000 square meters a year in the 685 km long western, southwestern, and southern\ncoastal sectors. Similar figures were reached in later Government estimates in 1993.  The\nGovernment, with Bank assistance, prepared a status report on coastal erosion in the southwest\nand west coast of Sri Lanka in September 1998. The report concluded that the coastal erosion\nrates will (i) show significant increases in areas with high littoral drift as a result of the decline in\nthe sand supply from rivers to the nearshore areas characterized by long sandy beaches, as in\nthe coast north of Maggona Headland; (ii) increase further in areas with limited net littoral drift\ndue to an increase in relative sea level rise and the effects of coral mining, such as in the coast\nbetween Maggona Headland and Galle; and (iii) increase in coastal stretches that are so far\nconsidered relatively stable, such as the coast between Bentota and Ambalangoda. The threat\nto vital infrastructure like roads and railway track has increased, and precautionary measures\nhave been taken in places where the need is urgent. The present emergency-type solutions that\nhave been adopted are not suitable as erosion is merely transferred to adjacent areas thus\nrequiring the construction of more temporary revetments that affect the access of fisherfolk and\ntourists to the sea and need annual repair and maintenance.\n7. Pollution from industrial, agricultural, and domestic sources has degraded the coastal\nhabitats and threatens the sustainability of the nearshore coastal fisheries. Among the estuaries\nand lagoons spread along the coastline, the major ones that contribute significantly to fisheries\nresources are the Puttalam Lagoon, Negombo Lagoon, Bolgoda-Panadura Estuary, Batticaloa\nLagoon, and Jaffna Lagoon. Lagoons and estuaries are threatened by pollution and siltation,\nexacerbated in some cases by water diversions that reduce natural flows. Pollution can result\nwhen lagoons are used as harbors (e.g., in Negombo and Chilaw), or disposal sites for sewage\n(e.g.,  in  Kelani  Estuary,  Negombo  and  Lunawa  lagoons),  or  when  they  receive  industrial\neffluents (e.g., in Lunawa and Negombo lagoons). A number of lagoons are being severely\naffected by encroachment and land reclamation, which contributes to a direct loss of functional\nlagoon  area  (e.g.,  in  Chilaw,  Negombo,  and  Mawella  lagoons).  Cumulative  damage  to", "3\nmangroves has resulted from overutilization of the resource and transformation of large areas to\nother uses such as shrimp pond aquaculture and lowland agriculture. Salt marsh areas have\nalso  been  destroyed  by  conversions  to  alternative  uses,  including  salt  farming  (e.g.,  at\nHambantota and Palavi), shrimp aquaculture, or reclamation (e.g., Muthurajawela Marsh).\n8. Coral reefs continue to be damaged as a result of the activities of divers collecting fish\nfor the ornamental fish export trade and overuse of the coral reef area by tourists and boat\noperators, even in marine protected areas. Due to destructive fishing practices and the adverse\nenvironmental impact of siltation and pollution, only two (Kandakuliya and Talawila) of some\neight coral reef areas studied in the Coastal Resources Management Project funded by the\nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  showed  live  coral  coverage\ngreater than 50 percent. Two nearshore reefs, Weligama and Polhena, showed a significant\nproportion of dead corals, while at Hikkaduwa and Akurala, about 25 percent dead corals were\nreported. The use of \"moxy\" nets for collection of ornamental fish for export has destroyed coral\nreefs and reduced the stocks of fish and shellfish utilizing the reefs for their habitat.\n9. Estimates  indicate that  the  existing  fishery  harbors  can  accommodate  about  1,450\ninboard engine (IBE) boats, and while the capacity may increase when the additional harbors\nbeing planned by the Government in Colombo, Galle, and Tangalle are completed, it may not be\nsufficient, especially if the expected future increase in fleet size and composition of the boat\npopulation is taken into account. Even though several fishing harbors and landing sites have\nbeen constructed/rehabilitated or are under construction, the need for harbor facilities is still\nurgent because most of the existing fish harbors and almost all beach landing sites in the\ncountry have poor or substandard infrastructure facilities that do not allow good handling of the\nlanded catch. Facilities such as auction sheds with adequate freshwater supply, toilets, and\nother basic amenities either are not available or are in poor condition. Unloading and handling\nmethods  are  very  unsatisfactory.  Lack  of  knowledge  of  proper  handling  and  postharvest\npractices has led to the poor quality of fish products and has serious implications for the export\ntrade. Therefore, another key area that needs close attention is the upgrading of infrastructure\nfacilities to conform to health and hygiene standards set by the European Union, to encourage\nfish export from the project area.\n3. Institutional Framework for Coastal Resource Management\n10. The overall responsibility for fisheries and coastal resource management in Sri Lanka is\nvested in the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development (MFARD). MFARD has\ntwo main departments: the Coast Conservation Department (CCD) and the Department of\nFisheries and Aquatic Resources (DFAR). The ministry has functions related to all fishery\nmatters, including administration, policy making, management, development,  research,  and\nmonitoring and evaluation. CCD is the agency mandated to exercise overall responsibility for\nactivities within the coastal zone; it derives its responsibilities from the Coast Conservation Act\n(CCA) of 1993. CCD is organized into three operational divisions: (i) Planning, Research, and\nDesign Division; (ii) Works Division; and (iii) Coastal Resources Management Division. DFAR is\nthe largest of MFARD's functional organizations and is the main implementing agency for the\nadministration,  development,  regulation,  and  monitoring  of  fisheries  and  living  aquatic\nresources. It is also responsible for extension and other technical and welfare services to fishing\ncommunities. DFAR is charged with the administration and enforcement of the Fisheries and\nAquatic  Resources  Act  of  1991 (or  the Fisheries  Act).  The  National  Aquatic  Resources\nResearch and Development Agency (NARA), the research arm of MFARD, was established\nunder  NARA  Act  No.  54  of  1981.  The  Ceylon  Fishery  Harbours  Corporation  (CFHC),\nestablished  in  1972  under  the  State  Industrial  Corporations  Act  of  1957,  is  under  the\nsupervision of MFARD. CFHC is charged with responsibility for construction, operation, and", "4\nmanagement of fishery harbors and related facilities. It is now in charge of the operation and\nmaintenance (O&M) of seven fishery harbors and 22 anchorages.\n11. MFARD has clear goals and its departments have elaborated their own strategic plans.\nThe Government\u2019s goal is to ensure sustainable growth in the fishery sector through resource\nmanagement, modernization, upgrading of technology, and export promotion. As CCD is under\nMFARD, there is adequate coordination between the regulatory and development functions in\ncoastal resources management. The overall capacity to identify objectives and to develop\nprograms  is  hindered  mainly  by  inadequate  trained  staff  at  middle  level,  and  weak\nimplementation capacities. The Works Division of CCD undertakes most of the physical works\nfor erosion protection. Part of the works are contracted to private contractors and part carried\nout by CCD staff. This takes up a considerable amount of time and effort. Except for the need to\nhave the capacity to deal with emergencies, the entire physical works can be undertaken by the\nprivate sector. Implementation of the Fisheries Act by DFAR remains weak. The department\nneeds to strengthen its technical expertise and strengthen coordination with other offices at\nboth province and district levels.\n12. To ensure close interagency coordination in coastal resource management (CRM), the\nCCA provided for the setting up of a Coast Conservation Advisory Council (CCAC) composed\nof representatives of all Government ministries and agencies whose mandates converge on the\nwork to be carried out by CCD. Provision was also made for one representative each from the\nuniversities, a private voluntary organization concerned with the coastal environment, and the\nfishing industry. While CCAC has provision for stakeholder representation, it has not functioned\nin an advisory capacity on policy issues. Instead its meetings have only focused on the approval\nor disapproval of applications for permits for buildings and other structures along the coast. The\nGovernment has agreed to reconstitute CCAC to enable the council to provide policy-level\ninputs, and to better reflect stakeholder consensus in policy making.\n4. Poverty Issues\n13. Although Sri Lanka has strong social indicators compared with other countries in South\nAsia, approximately 21 percent of the population still live in poverty. Despite the high priority\nthat the Government has attached to poverty reduction in recent years, the number of poor\npeople has not declined significantly in the 1990s. The recent socioeconomic survey by the\nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka showed that total poverty in the country declined from 27 percent in\n1985-1986  to  22  percent  in  1990-1991  and  to  21  percent  in  1997-1998.  Rapid  social\nassessment (RSA) was undertaken for the Project using the poverty line adopted under the\nSamurdhi4 program of the Government, under which beneficiaries who received an income\ntransfer of SLRs500\u20131,000 per month were considered as living below the poverty line. An\nindependent analysis also assessed the impact of the Project on poverty reduction.5 The two\nestimates show that poverty varies between 20-32 percent as per the RSA, and 20-29 percent\nas per the independent analysis in the project area. The main causes of poverty in the rural\nareas  are  underemployment  and  low-productivity  occupations.  The  rural  poor  also  are\ncharacterized by lower levels of education and a higher percentage of income spent on food.\n14. Many studies carried out in fishing communities have shown that the majority of the\nfisher families fall into the poorest category of the population. Some overarching characteristics\nof poverty prevail in fisher communities. The primary dependence of fisher families on a rapidly\n                                                       \n4  Samurdhi is a national program for poverty alleviation introduced in 1994. It focuses mainly on creating\nemployment  and  promoting  income-generating  activities.  Several  distinct  activities  are  undertaken  under\nSamurdhi. The Poor Relief Programme and Social Security Programme provide direct relief to the poorest\nsections.\n5 This analysis was made by Marga Institute in Colombo at the request of the Bank in July 1999.", "5\ndepleting resource is one of the major causes of deprivation. The scarcity of opportunities for\nadditional income generation, the nature of the habitat, poor housing, and lack of access to\nbasic amenities typify deprivation in fishing communities in general. The seasonal nature of\ntheir main or sole activity to generate income creates a situation where even if incomes from\nfishing are reasonably high, fisherfolk are unable to spread that income into the no-fishing\nseason. The women\u2019s lack of skills, education and training, and opportunities for earning an\nincome renders the families highly vulnerable in the event of death or disability of the male.\nTheir potential for saving is very low and therefore they have little prospect of investing in other\nincome-generating activities.\n15. Poverty in the coastal areas and its close nexus with the increasing pressure on coastal\nresources are recognized by the Government. The inability of the resource base to regenerate\nitself under the heavy pressure of exploitation sets up a resource depletion-poverty cycle, which\nfurther exacerbates the situation. The problem is particularly acute in areas where coral reefs\nare mined and mangrove areas converted, through landfill and encroachments, for shrimp\naquaculture and lowland agriculture. The Government is well aware of the importance of job\ncreation to address the problem of poverty. Significant efforts in the recent  past  (like  the\nSamurdhi program) have focused on the importance of rural livelihood development programs.\nThese programs have been complemented by skills development with extension and credit\nsupport, and development of infrastructure and marketing support. The Government is also\nformulating a policy framework for poverty reduction in the country.\n16. Access to credit is more of an issue than is availability of credit to the poor in the coastal\nareas. The National Development Bank provides refinancing to a variety of activities undertaken\nby commercial banks and rural development banks. The SANASA Development Bank, through\nits  8,400  village-level  activities,  is  also  well placed  to  extend  credit,  as  is  the Sarvodaya\nEconomic Enterprises Development Services (SEEDS), another nongovernment organization\n(NGO), which has the institutional network to provide credit support to livelihood development\nprograms.  Between  the  two,  about  SLRs145  million  had  been  extended  as  loans  for\nmicroenterprise type of activities by the end of 1997. In addition, cooperative rural banks had\nprovided about SLRs152 million as credit for such purposes till the end of 1997. Different state-\nfunded programs such as Surathura Program and Samurdhi Development Credit Scheme also\nprovide small loans to encourage income-generating activities.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n1. Strategic Framework\n17. The Government's coastal zone management policy is embodied in the Coastal Zone\nManagement Plan (CZMP) 1997 and Coastal 2000 - A Resource Management Strategy for Sri\nLanka's Coastal Region. The latter document, based on 20 special studies commissioned by\nthe  Government,  provides  the  direction  for  future  strategic  interventions  in  coastal  zone\nmanagement based on the achievements and shortcomings of the first decade of work in the\nsector.  Current  fisheries  policies  and  strategies  contained  in  the  National  Fisheries\nDevelopment Plan, 1995-2000 and in the six-year Fisheries Development Program, 1999-2004\ncomplement the policies and strategies contained in the CZMP and in Coastal 2000, with their\nstrong  emphasis  on  poverty  reduction,  coast  conservation, and environmental  protection.\nMFARD  particularly  intends  to  assist  the  small-scale  fisherfolk  through  skills  upgrading,\nimplementation of welfare schemes, and encouraging cottage industries as alternative sources\nof livelihood. In addition, administrative reforms in MFARD have also been identified.\n18. The Government is very much conscious of the extent to which its poverty reduction\nefforts  are  linked  with the  problems faced  in  the  management  of  coastal  resources.  The", "6\nGovernment recognizes the need for a more integrated approach to CRM and the long-term\nimpact  of  environmental  degradation.  Specific  efforts  taken  include  the  special  area\nmanagement (SAM) planning approach to protect wetlands and lagoons. Actual implementation\nof SAM plans has been constrained by lack of  investment, but  the  Rekawa development\nprogram has shown promise. The policy objectives of MFARD in its Fisheries Development\nProgram 1999-2004 are  to  improve national  nutrition and food  security through  increased\nfishing,  increase  employment  opportunities,  uplift  the  socioeconomic  status  of  fisherfolk\nincluding women, increase export earnings from the industry, and improve the skills of the\nfishing community. To operationalize these objectives, programs for skills upgrading, extension\nand credit, and strengthening fisheries cooperatives including capacities to improve savings\nmobilization will be undertaken, combined with targeted welfare schemes. The progress of\nMFARD\u2019s efforts can be considered satisfactory on the whole. However, MFARD needs to\nundertake greater resource conservation efforts; its emphasis has so far been on  income\ngeneration and increase in production. Environmental degradation should be addressed at the\nsame time by educating and involving the communities through information dissemination.\n2. Legal Framework\n19. CRM  was  formally  established  in  Sri  Lanka  with  the  enactment  of  the  Coast\nConservation Act (CCA) (Act No. 57) of 1981. It went into effect on 1 October 1983, but was\nsubsequently amended in 1988. The Act defined the coastal zone, mandated CCD to undertake\nresearch to describe the existing condition of the coastal zone, and called for the preparation of\na CZMP to provide the framework for the regulation and control of development activities within\nthe coastal zone. It also directed the establishment of the CCAC with various advisory and\nreview responsibilities for matters relating to coastal zone activities, and gave the director of\nCCD the responsibility for administering the provisions of the Act, formulating and executing\ncoastal conservation schemes, and conducting research for coastal conservation. The CCA has\nadopted the issuance of permits as the principal mechanism for regulating a wide range of\ndevelopment  activities  within  the  coastal  zone. Permits are to  be  issued  only  for  specific\nactivities with no demonstrable adverse effects on the stability, productivity, and environmental\nquality of the coastal zone. The amendment to the CCA in 1988 authorized the director of CCD\nto delegate powers, duties, and functions to Government agents or public officers of coastal\nadministrative districts; banned various coral mining activities; authorized enforcement actions\nto be taken against boats engaged in illegal activities; and granted the public free use of and\naccess to all beaches in the country. After the approval of Coastal 2000 by the Government,\nMFARD  began the process of drafting urgently required amendments to the CCA to provide the\nlegal basis for the implementation of the policies and strategies recommended in Coastal 2000.\nCabinet approval for the proposed amendments has already been accorded.\n20. The prevailing Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act No. 2 of 1996 (hereinafter referred\nto as  the  Fisheries  Act) went  into operation  on  11  January  1996  and  replaced  Fisheries\nOrdinance No. 24 of 1940, which was repealed in 1996.  The Fisheries Act simplifies and\nextends the purposes enunciated in the 1940 Ordinance, and was brought in to \"provide for the\nmanagement, regulation, conservation, and development of fisheries and aquatic resources in\nSri Lanka.\" Cabinet approval for the proposed amendments has already been accorded.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n21. Development efforts in the coastal resources sector have been supported, to a large\nextent,  by  assistance provided  by  various  multilateral  and  bilateral  funding  agencies.  The\nmultilateral funding agencies include the Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\nUnited Nations (UN/FAO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the World\nBank. The bilateral funding agencies include  the  Abu  Dhabi  Fund,  Canadian  International", "7\nDevelopment  Agency  (CIDA),  Danish  International  Development  Assistance  (DANIDA),\nEuropean  Union  (EU), German Agency for  Technical  Cooperation  (GTZ), Japan  Bank for\nInternational Corporation (JBIC), through its official development assistance window, Japan\nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA), Korean International Cooperation Agency, Norwegian\nAgency for Development (NORAD), British Overseas Development Agency (ODA), Swedish\nInternational Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), United States Agency for International\nDevelopment (USAID), and Government of the Netherlands among others.\n22. External assistance to the sector has been in the form of loans, TA grants, and regional\ncooperation projects. This assistance has been heavily biased, however, toward the fisheries\nsubsector. The emphasis has been on increasing fish production and improving the quality of\nfish. In more recent projects, greater attention is being paid to conservation and environmental\nprotection. The achievements in the sector with respect to increased production and policy\nchanges have been assisted by external assistance to a large extent. Coastal protection and\nenvironment  projects have been supported mainly by TAs from bilateral agencies. The Bank\nhas extended four loans since 1972 to this sector.6 In addition, the Kirinda fisheries harbor has\nbeen financed by the Japanese Government. A list of major externally assisted project and TA\ngrants from 1990 is given in Appendix 2.\n23. The Bank is also providing $2.86 million for a regional TA project for the Improvement of\nthe Database for Fisheries Management. This TA is implemented by the International Council\nfor Living Aquatic Resources Management and participated in by eight countries: Bangladesh,\nIndia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The Project, which\nwill be implemented in 1998-2002, aims to (i) develop a fishery resource information system, (ii)\ndevelop strategies and action plans, and (iii) strengthen the capacity of fisheries institutions of\nthe participating countries.\n24. FAO has implemented a major regional cooperation project in coastal fisheries called\nthe Bay of Bengal Programme, which has played a catalytic and consultative role in developing\ncoastal fisheries management in the Bay of Bengal to help improve the conditions of small-\nscale fisherfolk communities. The program, which was initially entitled Development of Small-\nscale Fisheries in the Bay of Bengal, started in January 1979 and initially covered Bangladesh,\nIndia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. It was later expanded to cover Indonesia and the\nMaldives.  Funding support came mainly from the governments of Denmark, Japan, and United\nKingdom, and the International Maritime Organization of the United Nations. Several TA\nprojects have been, and are still being, funded and implemented under this program.\nD. Lessons Learned\n25. The  four  previous  Bank  loan-funded  fisheries  projects  in  Sri  Lanka  were  mainly\ndevelopment-oriented and focused on the utilization of fisheries resources for direct extractive\npurposes rather than on sustainable resource management. The projects had increased fish\nproduction as a primary goal, and comprised interventions meant to improve the efficiency of\nfishing operations through the introduction of new and advanced technologies in fish capture,\nculture, postharvest handling, and processing. The overall result was a shift from the use of\ntraditional fishing methods to the adoption of new and modern techniques in fish production,\nprocessing, and marketing.\n                                                       \n6  The following projects in the fisheries sector have been approved: (i) Loan 115-SRI: Fisheries Development\nProject, for $3.1 million, approved on 14 December 1972; (ii) Loan 520-SRI: Second Fisheries Development\nProject, for $13.5 million, approved on 20 August 1981; (iii) Loan 648-SRI: Aquaculture Development Project, for\n$17.27 million, approved on 3 November 1983; and (iv) Loan 1201-SRI: Fisheries Sector Project, for $26.0\nmillion, approved on 1 December 1992.", "8\n26. There are lessons to be drawn from the implementation of the earlier Bank-funded\nfisheries  projects,  which  have  been  rated  as  \u201cpartially  successful.\u201d  The  evaluation  of  the\nFisheries  Development  Project  concluded,  among  others,  that  there  is  a  need  for  full\nconsultations  with  local  fisherfolk  and  for  a  realistic  assessment  of  their  financial  and\nmanagerial capabilities to undertake major programs. The performance audit of the Fisheries II\nProject echoed this recommendation, noting the desirability of consultations with the target\nbeneficiaries during project design. It also suggested the merits of having a certain degree of\nflexibility in project design  so  that necessary  changes  could be  implemented  rapidly.  The\nproblems encountered during the implementation of these projects demonstrated the need for\neffective project management, including day-to-day supervision by a project manager and close\nmonitoring by the Bank. Particularly encouraging is the implementation performance so far in\nthe ongoing Fisheries Sector Project. Compared with past projects and despite some problems\nduring initial implementation, mainly due to poor technical input and lack of qualified staff to\nmanage the Project, MFARD has become familiar with the Bank\u2019s procedures and requirements\nfor project implementation.\n27. Only the most recent loan-funded project, the Fisheries Sector Project (footnote 6), has\nbeen  implemented  with  the  aim  of  reducing  pressure  on  coastal  fisheries  resources  by\nencouraging  offshore  fishing  and  increasing  the  income  of  coastal  fisherfolk  through  the\nprovision of alternative livelihood opportunities. Fish landing facilities at three harbors (Mirissa,\nPurunawella, and Beruwela) in the priority areas have been improved, and credit has been\nprovided to local fishing communities. Improved fish handling, storage, and marketing facilities\nhave  enhanced  the  quality  of  fish  and  increased  fishers'  income.  The  local-community-\nparticipation approach for harbor facilities management has also demonstrated its effectiveness\nin improving fish landings and handling as well as the financial sustainability of the rehabilitated\nharbors, with user fees now being levied.\n28. Given the present status of the country\u2019s fisheries resources, particularly in the coastal\nareas, it is imperative that the planning and design of future interventions in the sector should\ntake note of the need for sustainable management of the country\u2019s fisheries resources. Rather\nthan promote only increased production, future projects should carefully evaluate the resource\nstatus and, based on the results of the assessment, adopt a resource management and/or\nrehabilitation strategy that would ensure the sustainability of the coastal and marine resources.\n29. Other lessons to note are incorporated in a Bank study of 27 completed Bank-assisted\nfisheries projects as of 30 June 1998.7 The main recommendations pertain to the need for\npromoting integrated CRM to prevent resource depletion and for a holistic approach to project\ndesign. Greater supervisory inputs from the Bank for projects involving new technologies are\nrequired during the initial years of implementation so as to (i) identify emerging problems at a\nmuch earlier stage, and (ii) react with appropriate assistance in a more timely manner. Similarly\nthe institutional capability of the executing agency (EA) should be carefully assessed to ensure\nthat it could effectively carry out its responsibilities. If necessary, strengthening of the EA staff\nprior to loan approval or during implementation may be considered. It was also recommended\nthat governments should focus on the provision of a suitable policy, institutional, and regulatory\nframework and support services including research, training, and extension.\n30. The ongoing and past external sources of assistance provide tested approaches to be\nadopted by the Bank under the Project. The TA grants given by DANIDA and GTZ have\nprovided well-tested approaches to implement and to monitor the beach nourishment technique\nas well as other techniques to minimize and localize the coastal erosion. The USAID TA grant\n                                                       \n7  Operations Evaluation Office. 1998. Sector Synthesis of Evaluation Findings in the Fisheries Sector. Asian\nDevelopment Bank, Manila.", "9\non CRM provided a ready-to-use model on community participation for sustainable use of\ncoastal resources. An evaluation of the implementation of SAM approaches developed by\nUSAID for coastal environment and resource management in Rekawa and Hikkaduwa was\ncarried out  by  the World  Conservation  Union  (IUCN)  in  1997.  The  result  showed  that  in\nadopting  this  approach  the  successful  factors  are  (i)  active  participation  of  the  local\ncommunities, (ii) effective liaison between government officials from the district secretariat and\nCCD, and (iii) display of a clear priority issue as well as targets and goals to be achieved. The\nproposed Project has been designed, taking the above lessons into account.\nE. The Bank's Sector Strategy\n31. The Bank\u2019s recently approved Country Operational Strategy for Sri Lanka8 identifies\nnatural resource management as one of the main elements of the Bank's strategy for Sri Lanka.\nThe other elements of the strategy are (i) policy and institutional reform at the national level, (ii)\nhuman resource development, (iii) expansion of infrastructure, and (iv) social dimensions. In\nline  with  this  strategy,  Bank  operations  in  the  natural  resources  sector  of  Sri  Lanka  are\nexpected to focus on three areas: (i) forestry and biodiversity conservation and management,\n(ii)  comprehensive  water  resource  management,  and  (iii)  assistance  in  coastal  resource\nmanagement. The expanded focus on natural resource management, which entails the location\nof projects in rural and coastal areas, is expected to have a beneficial impact on employment\nand the income levels of the population in marginal communities, while addressing some of the\nnegative externalities and social impacts associated with structural transformation.\n32. In the coastal and marine resources subsector, Bank assistance is expected to address\nissues  such  as  marine  resources  depletion,  coastal  erosion,  and  deterioration  of  coastal\nhabitats  through  an  integrated  approach  based  on  rehabilitation  of  coastal  habitats  and\nbeaches, reduction of erosion-prone areas, improvement of fish breeding habitats and fisheries\nmanagement,  income-generating  opportunities  for  impoverished  coastal  populations,  and\nstrengthening of sector institutions.\n33. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Fisheries9 provides for assistance to promote integrated coastal\nfisheries management. The emphasis is on meeting the twin objectives of reducing destructive\nfishing practices and pollution, which reduce the productivity of the resource, while encouraging\nmeasures to improve coastal fishing, which will contribute to the economic development of the\ncoastal  communities. Efforts  will  be  made  to  introduce  effective  policies  and  enforcement\ncapacity  to  prevent  destructive  fishing  practices,  and  destruction  of  habitats,  especially\nmangroves; and to eliminate coral mining and trading of coral-based products. The private\nsector will be encouraged to play a larger role in fisheries while governments will principally be\nresponsible for establishing the policy, institutional, and regulatory framework to support the\nsustainable management of fisheries resources. The Bank's environmental guidelines will be\napplied  rigorously  in  developing  and  implementing  projects  in  the  fisheries  sector,  and  a\nparticipatory process will be followed in formulating projects.\n34. The widespread poverty among artisanal fishers and fisherfolk communities, overfished\nresources, and  increasing  degradation  of  fishing  grounds,  especially  in  nearshore  coastal\nareas, are key areas for Bank support. Poverty reduction is a priority concern, particularly\nbecause poverty contributes to resource degradation. And as reducing the dependence of\ncommunities on fisheries resources for food and livelihood is  key  to  sustainable  resource\nmanagement, the exit of marginal fishers from coastal fishing needs to be encouraged. Non-\n                                                       \n8  Country Operational Strategy for Sri Lanka: Promoting the Environment for Growth, circulated to the Board on\n23 March 1999.\n9  The Bank\u2019s Policy on Fisheries dated October 1997.", "10\nfishing employment alternatives may be provided through investments in human capital through\nskills training and promotion of alternative livelihood programs. These need to target the entire\nfishing household, women included, as increasing their contribution to household income will\ncomplement efforts to reduce dependence on the fisheries resources.\n35. The stronger participation of stakeholders in resolving issues of access, allocation of\nuser rights, and monitoring and enforcement will be a concern for Bank assistance. The Bank\nwill encourage the Government to involve local government units and fishing communities in\nfisheries management as an integral component of national policy. The Bank will also support\nthe strengthening of the management capabilities of fishing communities through community\norganization and participation, training, and other forms of assistance, including the active\ninvolvement of NGOs in areas where they have a comparative advantage.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n36. The Bank has been able to target specific policy changes to improve the management of\nnatural resources in Sri Lanka through its past loan and TA operations. The changes have\ngenerally been restricted to the specific subsectors such as forests, water, and fisheries to\nwhich Bank assistance has been extended. The Bank is in the process of encouraging the\nGovernment  to adopt  a  more  comprehensive  approach  to  the  management  of  all  natural\nresources and is expected to extend support for management of the land and marine resources\nin a manner similar to that of the water sector.\n37. Private sector development is a strategic national priority and the Bank\u2019s efforts to\nencourage private sector development have the Government\u2019s full support. However, while\nfishing is done entirely in the private sector and fishing vessels are owned privately, little private\nsector investment can be expected to establish landing facilities and marketing facilities. The\nprivate sector does not even fully meet the demand for ice and salt. Hence, it has become\nnecessary for the Government, through CFHC, to provide the necessary infrastructure for the\nfishing vessels. Maintenance of these facilities has so far been financed through the budget.\nThe following key areas have been the center of the Bank\u2019s policy dialogue in the coastal and\nmarine resources sector.\n1. Legal Environment\n38. The Bank has discussed with the Government the need to enact a new law that will\nsupersede the Coast Conservation Act of 1981 (subsequently amended in 1988) to provide a\nstronger legal basis for the implementation of the policies and strategies for coastal environment\nand resource management (CERM). The present Act has been able to implement parts of the\nCZMP, but needs to be strengthened for better coordination and enforcement. Further, it is\nnecessary to address the problems arising from overlapping or contradictory statutes, which\ngive similar powers over the coastal zone to various ministries or authorities, and which have, in\neffect, caused the powers, functions, and duties of CCD to be eroded over the years. It has\nbeen proposed that the existing CCA be repealed and a new law enacted, which will have all\nthe desired changes including the designation of CCD as the coordinating agency for all matters\nin the coastal zone, grant of additional powers to the director, and reconstitution of the CCAC to\nmake it an effective policy-recommending body to the minister on matters affecting the coastal\nzone. The new Act, which will also resolve the legislative overlaps with other laws, is proposed\nto be called the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Act. It is proposed that\nCCD be renamed the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department. At\nthe request of the Government, Bank assistance was provided under TA 3034-SRI to draft the\nnew Act for easy processing within the Government. Cabinet approval has been accorded to the\nproposed new legislation.", "11\n39. To strengthen the law for effective conservation and enforcement, amendments to the\nFisheries Act of 1996 are also necessary. The required amendments have been identified; they\ncover eight specific areas relating to CRM: licensing of fishing operations, regulation of foreign\nfishing  boats,  seizure  of fishing  boats  and  other  materials,  settlement  of  fishing  disputes,\nconservation, flora and fauna conservation/protection, chank fisheries and pearl fisheries, and\ncomposition  of  fisheries  management  committees.  The  proposed  amendments  govern  the\nissuance  of  licenses  to  fishing  vessels  and  strict  enforcement  of  resource  conservation\nmeasures. Fisheries whose management was omitted from the 1996 Act, such as that for the\nchank fishery, are  proposed  to  be  reincorporated  in the amendments.  It  is  proposed  that\nmembership in fisheries management committees in designated fishery management areas be\nexpanded  by  including  representatives  of  fishery  cooperatives  as  well  as  relevant  NGOs.\nLoopholes in the law due to poor wording also need to be closed by clarifying the activities that\nare prohibited. Cabinet approval has been accorded to these amendments.\n40. It is expected that all action necessary for submission to the Parliament of the proposed\namendments to both Acts and the subsequent legislative action would be completed as soon as\npossible and not later than one year of loan effectiveness. The Government has also assured\nthat exercise of power by concerned government agencies under the Urban Development Law\nand the Tourism Development Act, which have a bearing on the coastal zone, will be done with\nprior concurrence of CCD.\n2. Cost Recovery\n41. The extent to which the maintenance of the fishing harbors and anchorages depends on\nthe  Government  budget  for  O&M  is  an  important  factor  to  determine  whether  further\ninvestments in such infrastructure support are sustainable. From recommendations made under\na Bank-funded TA project10 approved in conjunction with the ongoing Fisheries Sector Project, it\nwas noted that the Government has introduced berthing charges as a first step in implementing\ncost-recovery measures (equivalent to about 1 percent of the estimated value of fish landing) in\nfour selected ports: Beruwela, Galle, Tangalle, and Kirinda.11 It has already been agreed that\nthis system will be introduced in all the ports financed under the Fisheries Sector Project. The\npresent berthing charges will be increased to about 2 percent of all fish landings when all the\nfacilities to be provided in the harbors are completed. The amount is estimated to be sufficient to\ncover all O&M costs. Once fish auctions are established, it would also be possible to adopt a\nsystem of charges based on actual fish landings rather than on the size of boats as is presently\ndone. It has been agreed that the process of cost recovery established under the Fisheries\nSector Project would be extended to the fishing harbors and anchorages to be established\nunder the proposed Project. It is expected that CFHC, which is expected to maintain the fishery\nharbors, will be able to meet all O&M costs eventually from the collection of berthing charges.\n42. Even  though  there  is  a  high  concentration  of  tourist  facilities  along  the  coast,  the\ncoastline is treated as public property and is not owned by individuals or hotels. It is difficult to\nisolate specific beneficiaries from the coastline stabilization measures, that can be targeted for\ncost  recovery  of  the  capital  costs.  The  maintenance  costs  for  the  coastline  stabilization\ncomponent  is  also  estimated  to  be  significant  (about  $1.75  million  annually),  making  it\nnecessary  for  the  Government  to  consider  whether  there  is  scope  to  generate  additional\nrevenues to meet these costs. The Government felt that the expenditure was entirely justifiable\nas a public good as the benefit of the investment will be enjoyed by society as a whole, and\nshould  be  met  from  existing  revenues  under  the  national  budget.  At  the  same  time,  the\n                                                       \n10  TA 1795-SRI: Rationalization of Fishery Harbor and Other Charges, for $590,000, approved on 1 December 1992.\n11  Present berthing charges are as follows: (i) inboard engine (IBE) boats: 45'-49', SLRs1,125; 40'-45', SLRs900; 40', SLRs675;\n36', SLRs562.50; 34', SLRs337.50; 28', SLRs220; and (ii) outboard engine (OBE) boats, SLRs112.50.", "12\nGovernment recognizes the need to ensure that the present erosion rates are reduced and the\neconomic value of beaches is preserved. As the potential for tourism would be most vulnerable\nto  beach  erosion,  the  scope  for  revenue  generation  from  the  tourism  industry  could  be\nexamined. There is little potential to collect revenues from other sources. However, it has to be\nrecognized that the tourism sector has only started to show signs of recovery after nearly a\ndecade of recession due to the negative impact of the civil conflict. It is therefore necessary to\nbe cautious in the introduction of additional levies and to identify the mechanisms only after\nextensive discussions with industry. At the Government\u2019s request, a small-scale TA has been\nextended to assess the potential and develop a suitable mechanism for the purpose.12 The\nGovernment has agreed that action to be taken will be worked out by the Government in\nconsultation with the Bank and other stakeholders within six months of the receipt of the final\nreport of the TA.\n3. Subsidies\n43. The Government has an ongoing program of subsidies for new and existing fishing\nvessels, which include boats that fish in the coastal areas and those that fish in offshore waters.\nThese subsidies are extended to a targeted beneficiary group of poor fisherfolk and is intended\nmainly to (i) encourage a shift from coastal to offshore fishing, (ii) encourage adoption of more\nmodern  fishing  practices,  and  (iii)  support  the  installation  of  modern  communication  and\nnavigation equipment to encourage the safety of fishing fleets and fisherfolk. The Government\nagreed with the Bank, under the ongoing Fisheries Sector Project, to review the feasibility of\nreducing and eventually eliminating subsidies to new offshore fishing vessels. While there has\nbeen an overall reduction in the total subsidy amount paid by the Government for all types of\nfishing boats in 1997 and 1998, subsidies still paid for new fishing vessels of both  types\ncurrently amount to about SLRs57 million per annum or about 22 percent of the total annual\nrecurrent expenditure for MFARD and 3 percent of the ministry\u2019s total annual budget. However,\nthe subsidies are only 0.03 percent of the Government\u2019s total annual recurrent expenditure. The\namount of subsidy varies according to vessel size and the type of equipment installed. While\nthere is no firm estimate of the maximum sustainable yield for Sri Lanka, present catch data\nindicate that further increases in the number of offshore fishing boats do not appear to be a\npriority needing incentives. Instead, it is important to improve yields through the reduction of\npostharvest losses and improvement of fish-handling practices. The Government\u2019s position is\nthat substantial progress has been made in the past few years in the reduction of subsidies to\nfishing boats in the coastal areas. Subsidies particularly encouraged existing fishing vessels to\ninstall improved facilities, which enable these vessels to take to offshore fishing, thus reducing\nthe pressure on coastal fishing.\n44. The Government does acknowledge the need to reduce the pressure on coastal fishing\nto provide for resource regeneration. The Government has, therefore, agreed to progressively\nphase out the subsidies for fishing boats by reducing the subsidies by 15 percent annually for\ncoastal and offshore boats and to restrict the subsidy to only offshore vessels after 2002. The\nGovernment has also agreed to review with the Bank during the midterm review of the Project\nthe need for continuing the subsidy for offshore vessels. The review will focus on the need for\nincentives to be continued to targeted beneficiaries for a limited number of offshore fishing\nvessels to facilitate the adoption of  new  technology for diversified fishing, navigation,  and\nimproved preservation of catch.\n                                                       \n12  TA 3274-SRI: Cost Recovery Mechanism Analysis for Coastal Zone Protection, for $150,000, approved on\n13 October 1999.", "13\n4. Sand Mining\n45. Excessive sand mining and inappropriate location of sand mining operations contribute\nto shoreline erosion and beach retreat by cutting the sand supply to downdrift beaches. The\nsand mining problem is aggravated by the increased demand for sand by the construction\nindustry in the 1980s. In 1991, phase I of the National Sand Study for Sri Lanka was conducted\nby the Central Environmental Authority (CEA), in collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs of the Netherlands to compile all available information and data on sand mining in Sri\nLanka. On completion of phase I in 1992, it was found that there was a direct link between the\nerosion sites and sand mining. In 1997, phase II of the project was initiated by CCD and CEA\nwith Government funds to identify alternative sources of sea sand. The study was carried out by\nthe  University  of  Moratuwa.  A  task  force  was  set  up  within  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  and\nEnvironment to recommend steps for implementing the use of the alternatives recommended by\nthe  study,  such  as  dunes  sand,  offshore  sand,  quarry  dust,  and  alternative  construction\npractices.\n46. The Government has already banned the use of coral reef-based lime in Government\nconstruction from 1 January 1999 and is mounting an awareness campaign in this regard. River\nsand mining, which is one of the causes of coastal erosion, has also been regulated in the\ncoastal zone, but upstream sand mining continues to be  a problem.  For  want of suitable\nsubstitutes, and in view of the significant impact it will have on the poorer segments of the\npopulation involved in this activity, the Government is looking at possible alternatives. A task\nforce appointed by the President's secretariat is in the process of finalizing recommendations for\nits control, but these recommendations are essentially administrative in nature. The alternatives\nsuggested need to be studied in detail. A study to review sand mining alternatives, including\ncost recovery options, will be undertaken as part of the proposed Project. The recommendations\nwill be considered by the Ministry of Forestry and Environment separately.\n5. Institutional Reform\n47. Because of the need to introduce institutional changes within MFARD to strengthen\nCCD's position as the central coordinating agency for CERM activities, and to give a more\nactive management role to DFAR, the Bank and the Government agreed that the following\nmeasures will be taken:\n(i)  The CCAC will be reconstituted within one year of loan effectiveness to make it\nan effective policy-recommending body to the minister of MFARD on matters\naffecting the coastal zone.\n(ii)  The phasing out of CCD\u2019s physical construction works using private contractors.\nBy the end of project implementation in 2005, it will confine itself to policy and\nplanning  of  CERM  activities  as  well  as  execution  of  emergency  works,  if\nnecessary.\n(iii)  A Planning and Monitoring Division (PMD) at MFARD will be established by\nDecember 2000 and made operational by December 2002. It will serve as the\ndata center of the agencies and departments under MFARD to advise on policy\nand operational matters.\n(iv)  A data collection and management system in MFARD will be established by 2001\nand will become operational by December 2002 to serve as a facility for storage\nand inventory of relevant information on fisheries to support the PMD of MFARD\nas well as facilitate coastal zone planning and management.", "14\n(v)  A  new  Central  Extension  Unit  (CEU)  will  be  established  within  DFAR  by\nDecember 2001 to spearhead the awareness programs and provide technical\ndirection and training for field extension officers and social welfare services in the\ntarget communities.\nThe Government has agreed to assign the staff required for items (iii), (iv), and (v).\n6. Administrative Reform\n48. The Bank has also recommended to the Government that administrative control over the\nMarine Pollution Prevention Authority (MPPA) be transferred to MFARD from the Ministry of\nPorts  under  which  it  presently  functions.  This  would  allow  better  coordination  and\nimplementation of environmental protection between CCD (on land) and MPPA (in water). At\npresent the director of CCD is on the advisory committee of MPPA, but this arrangement is not\nconsidered sufficient to ensure coordination of activities and enforcement of regulations.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n49. The Project will be implemented at selected sites belonging to six administrative districts\nalong  the  north  western,  western,  and  southern  coasts  of  the  country.  The  districts  are\n(i) Puttalam  in  North Western  Province;  (ii)  Gampaha,  Colombo,  and  Kalutara  in Western\nProvince; and (iii) Galle and Hambantota in Southern Province (see map). The sites were\nselected through an extensive process of consultations with all stakeholders in a two-stage\nprocess. At the first stage, the criteria for site selection were developed and approved; at the\nsecond stage, the criteria were applied to a list of sites and the prioritized sites identified. The\nProject will target as its primary beneficiaries about 75 percent of the total households (76,500\nhouseholds) in the coastal areas of these districts. The beneficiaries are mostly small fishers,\nsmall  prawn  farmers,  fish  processors,  lagoon  fishers,  coral  miners,  fish  vendors,  small\nagriculture operators, and other workers in the fishing industry and allied fields, whose incomes\nare generally seasonal.\n50. A detailed description of the project area is in Appendix 3. In selecting the project area,\nenvironmental  considerations  were  the  principal  guiding  factor.  It  is  expected  that  project\ninterventions in the selected sites will result in an integrated resource management effort and\nmaximize the benefits. While erosion rates and threat to the economic infrastructure are the\nmain reasons for the stretches identified for erosion protection, the wetlands/lagoons chosen\nare considered vital to maintain coastal resource regeneration. Harbor sites were determined by\nboat population and the need for safe landing areas, and intended to reduce loss due to poor\nhandling and storage.\n51. Sustainable management of the coastal resources will require an integrated approach\nthat covers all aspects and will provide a balance between conservation and development.\nAttention is urgently needed to address the following key issues in the Sri Lankan coastal\nresources sector: (i) serious erosion of the coastline, especially in areas with concentrated\neconomic activity or vital infrastructure; (ii) unmanaged fishing in coastal and offshore areas;\n(iii) pollution and uncontrolled  exploitation of  lagoons and  estuaries,  coral  reefs,  mangrove\nswamps, sea grass beds, other wetlands, and dune systems; and (iv) widespread poverty\namong the coastal population. Failure to accord priority to these issues would put the enormous\ncontribution of the coastal belt to the economy at risk.", "15\n52. Erosion control has so far been attempted by the Government in an ad hoc manner with\nnumerous revetments, seawalls, groins, and breakwaters constructed in several areas in an\neffort to control erosion and protect the coast. However, these physical structures have spoiled\nthe natural beauty of the beach and have adversely affected tourist traffic. More importantly,\nthey have resulted only in transferring the erosion problem to adjacent areas since they were\nbuilt largely to protect important assets but without a plan for long-term protection. Although\nthese erosion control measures have reduced losses of land and infrastructure, they have been\nessentially emergency measures. A planned and sustainable strategy has not been attempted\ndue to inadequacy of resources and capacity constraints. Monitoring of the coastline and of the\nextent and rate of erosion is also very rudimentary, and there is no planning of necessary\npreventive measures. The problem has become particularly acute in the southern and south\nwestern parts of the coast.\n53. Pollution and depletive livelihood activities, caused by poverty among the population\ndependent on natural resources, pose a serious threat to the diverse natural ecosystems in the\ncoastal  belt,  and  have  severely  damaged  marine  sanctuaries  and  wetlands  that  provide\nvaluable habitat for fish and other living aquatic resources. A significant percentage of the\npopulation living in the coastal areas earn their livelihood by exploiting the fishing and nonliving\nmarine resources. The income levels of many are below the poverty line, and unless measures\nare taken to improve their income levels and retrain them to undertake alternate livelihood\nactivities,  the  pressure  that  this  population  exerts  on  the  resource  base  will  continue  to\nexacerbate the situation.\n54. Uncontrolled coral mining has destroyed precious coral reefs and affected the country's\ntourism potential. Illegal encroachment into lagoon areas, uncontrolled discharge of industrial\nand domestic wastes, and intensive illegal harvesting of mangroves for fuel and shelter have\nalso contributed significantly to the decline of marine ecosystems. Except for some site-specific\nresource management efforts undertaken with external assistance, there is no comprehensive\nstrategy for the preservation of lagoons and wetlands, and local community involvement in\nsustainable management practices is limited, if not altogether lacking.\n55. Although offshore fishing has been actively encouraged in the recent past, an urgently\nneeded proactive program to conserve coastal fisheries is absent. The problem of over-fishing,\neven in offshore areas, is compounded by poor onboard storage and onshore handling, and by\nenvironmental pollution  caused by  oil,  trash,  and  fish  debris  from  fishing  boats. With  the\nexpected increase in the number of multiday boats, the demand for additional harbor facilities\nwill have to be met by the Government simultaneously with the implementation of better and\nmore  effective  fisheries  resource  management  interventions,  including  the  regulation  and\ncontrol of fishing effort and the introduction of measures to reduce fish spoilage. The latter can\nhave a significant overall impact on fisherfolk income.\n56. For  the  Government  to be  able  to  carry  out  these  tasks,  institutional  reforms  and\ncapacity-building efforts to support more efficient management practices are required: (i) the\nlegal  basis  for  CRM  has  to  be  streamlined  to  allow  unified  control  and  strengthen  the\nenforcement capacity of the concerned institutions, (ii) more systematic monitoring needs to be\nset  in  place  to  assist  in  planning  and  management  control,  and  (iii)  present  institutional\narrangements  have  to  be  revamped  and  substantial  capacity-building  efforts  undertaken.\nWithout these measures, the Government will not be able to implement an integrated approach\nto the conservation and management of coastal resources.", "16\nB. Objectives and Scope\n57. The overall goal of the sector is to enhance environmental protection in the coastal\nareas and contribute to poverty reduction among fisherfolk communities. The main objective of\nthe  Project  is  to  establish  integrated  management  of  coastal  resources  to  improve  their\nsustainabilty.\n58. The Project will comprise four components:\n(i)  coastline stabilization, which will address the problem of coastal erosion and\ndevelop proactive coastal erosion management systems;\n(ii)  coastal environment and resource management, which will address problems of\ncoastal  resource  degradation  and  include  activities  intended  to  improve  the\nincome levels of coastal communities, thereby relieving the pressure on coastal\nresources;\n(iii)  fisheries  resource  management  and  quality  improvement,  which  will  aim  at\nsustainable  coastal  fisheries  management  supported  by  the  construction  of\nharbors/anchorages and ancillary facilities that will permit the improvement of fish\nquality and reduction of pollution in lagoons; and\n(iv)  institutional  strengthening,  which  will  enhance  the  institutional  capabilities  of\nMFARD, other concerned agencies, and community organizations in coastal and\nfisheries  resource  management.  A  participatory  approach  to  CRM  will  be\nadopted  in  the  development  and  implementation  of  community-based  SAM\nplans.\n1. Coastline Stabilization Component\n59. The Project will aim to minimize the potential adverse impacts of coastal erosion in\ncritical  coastal  stretches  through  the  establishment  of  appropriate  physical  interventions\nintended  to  stabilize  the  coastline.  In  parallel,  the  Project  will  promote  a  shift  in  erosion\nmanagement approach from defensive/reactive to proactive/preventive and include activities in\nsupport of the overall coastal erosion management strategy, including the conduct of special\nstudies, monitoring of the structural and functional performance of the physical structures, and\nestablishment of a coastal engineering data center. The works will be implemented in seven\nspecific coastal segments from Galle to Chilaw, an overall length of 52 km out of a total stretch\nof 210 km. Part A of this component will cover five sites extending over 37 km (nos. 1-4 in\nTable 1), and Part B will cover two sites extending over 15 km (no. 5 in Table 1).\n60. The engineering measures proposed for establishment at the sites will include artificial\nbeach nourishment and a combination of other structures including groins, revetments, and\noffshore breakwaters to obtain the optimum stabilization scheme in terms of construction and\nestablishment cost, maintenance cost, and functionality. The design concepts were planned\ntaking full account of the need to ensure that they are consistent with the concepts embodied in\nthe Coastal Zone Management Plan, 1997.\n2. Coastal Environment and Resource Management (CERM) Component\n61. To implement CRM activities at the local level, a location-specific, community-based\nparticipatory  approach  will  be  used  through  the  establishment  of  community  coordinating\ncommittees (CCCs). Using a modular approach, different combinations of the following modules", "17\nare proposed for each site according to its management needs: (i) community strengthening; (ii)\nawareness  building;  (iii)  SAM  plan  preparation;  (iv)  habitat  conservation  and  resource\nmanagement interventions; (v) measures to improve water exchange in lagoons; and (vi) social\nprograms that will include provision for social infrastructure, training for livelihood development,\nmicroenterprise development support, etc.\n3. Fisheries Resource Management and Quality Improvement Component\n62. This component will aim at the sustained management and development of coastal\nfisheries resources through activities that address the following identified issues: overfishing in\ncoastal waters, generally poor quality of fish landings and high percentage of fish wastage, and\nlack of infrastructure support facilities in specific locations. The Project will address resource\nsustainability  issues  through  (i)  installation  of  a  simplified,  functional,  community-based\nmonitoring, control, and surveillance (MCS); (ii) implementation of community-based fisheries\nmanagement activities as part of the CRM/SAM process; (iii) diversification of fishing effort to\nreduce  pressure  on  coastal  fish  stocks;  and  (iv)  conduct  of  special  fisheries\ninvestigations/research studies. An  information  campaign  will  be  launched to  publicize the\nimproved fishing boat design and promote its adoption among multiday boat operators and\nfishers.  To  minimize fish  spoilage, fish  handling  and  storage  techniques  will be  improved\nthrough an intensive campaign targeting fish vessel crewmembers, fish handlers, processors,\nmarketers, traders, and retailers as well as the general public.\n63. To complement the fish quality enhancement interventions described earlier and to\nsupport the Project's environmental objectives, two fishery harbors will be constructed at Chilaw\nand Hambantota and two anchorages will be rehabilitated as harbors at Ambalangoda and\nKalametiya. The civil works in the selected sites will include (i) rehabilitation of shore-based\nfacilities, including dredging, rock excavation, construction of breakwaters, quay walls, jetties,\nrevetments, and shore services including fish handling sheds, net repair sheds, and fueling\nfacilities; (ii) installation or improvement of existing associated services, including access roads,\ntoilets, perimeter fences, water, electricity, and area lighting; and (iii) regular maintenance to\nkeep the harbors and anchorages open.\n4. Institutional Strengthening Component\n64. This component will aim at enhancing the institutional capabilities of concerned MFARD\nagencies and community-based organizations (CBOs) in resource management. The Project\nwill include interventions intended to address identified institutional weaknesses and equip the\nconcerned agencies and stakeholder groups for the roles they are expected to play in CRM.\nStrengthening of the capabilities of MFARD and its offices will be closely linked to interventions\nfor improving community-level monitoring and data-gathering capabilities. A substantial training\nand technical support element will target MFARD personnel, at provincial and local levels and\ndepartment/corporation/agency  level  as  well  as  community  beneficiaries,  as  trainees.  The\nproposed fellowships and training courses for staff of MFARD and its key agencies have been\ndeveloped in consultation with MFARD, but the specific arrangements will need to be worked\nout  during  implementation.  The  ministry's  data  collection,  processing,  and  database\nmanagement capabilities will also be strengthened.\n65. The institutional strengthening of CCD will particularly focus on building the capacity of\nthe Planning Research and Design Division as well as the zonal and district offices, which will\nbe established in the field under the Project. A computerized database management system will\nbe established in that division for the compilation, storage, and retrieval of data in the form of\nplans, drawings, photographic records, survey data, coastline monitoring measurements, and", "18\ninformation on the condition of physical installations necessary for the effective functioning of\nCCD.\n66. Specific  research  studies  will  be  undertaken  to  improve  MFARD\u2019s  management\ncapacities and to provide some insights into difficult issues. Six topics have been identified as\nvital to providing relevant information for effective planning and policy making for CRM and\nconservation.  They  are  (i)  marine  fishery  resources  and  stock  assessment;  (ii)  reducing\npostharvest  losses  by  improving  onboard  fishing  technology;  (iii)  fisheries  technology;\n(iii) fisheries sector livelihood potential; (iv) water quality in the coastal zone under the SAM\nprogram; (v) sand mining and alternatives; and (vi) policy on licensing, regulation and subsidies\nand the effect of existing and phased-out subsidies. The list of research topics was developed in\nconsultation with the agencies concerned, and the detailed terms of reference will be worked\nout  following  an  agreed  upon  outline  terms  of  reference  (available  as  a  supplementary\nappendix) in consultation with the Bank during project implementation.\n67. Specific project interventions under the first three components and the locations within\nthe selected districts where they will be implemented are summarized in Table 1.\nTable 1:  Project Interventions and Locations\nCoastline Stabilization Coastal Environment and Resources Fisheries Resource\nManagement Management and\nQuality Improvement\n1.

Financing Plan\n69. It is proposed that the Bank provide a loan of $40.0 million from its Special Funds\nresources to finance about 50 percent of the total Project cost. The proposed Bank loan will\nhave a repayment period of 32 years, including an 8-year grace period, and will carry an interest\ncharge of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent thereafter. The\nproposed financing plan is in Table 3. The financing plan, by component, is in Appendix 5.\nTable 3:  Financing Plan\n($ million)\n            Foreign                Local                 Total\nSource            Exchange          Currency               Cost             Percent\nBank 29.32 10.68 40.00 50.0\nNetherlands 7.31 5.45 12.76 16.0\nGovernmenta 7.37 19.78 27.15 33.9\nBeneficiaries - 0.09 0.09 0.1\nTotal 44.0 36.0 80.0 100.0\na\nInclusive of commercial borrowing to be arranged by the Government.", "20\n70. The Government of the Netherlands accords high priority to environmental protection\nand natural resource management in Sri Lanka and has expressed interest to provide grant\ncofinancing amounting to about $12.76 million. This is planned to cover the financing for the\nentire  CERM  and  institution  strengthening  components  of  the  Project.  Board  approval  for\nadministering the amount as per Bank guidelines will be obtained as soon as the cofinancing\narrangements are firmed up. Including this grant cofinancing, it is expected that about 66\npercent of the total cost will be met by external financing and 33.9 percent by the Government\u2019s\nown resources. Beneficiaries will contribute in the form of labor for the construction of social\ninfrastructure facilities in the CERM component. The Bank will partially finance Part A of the\ncoastline stabilization component, and the Government is expected to avail itself of commercial\nborrowings to finance Part B of this component. The commercial borrowings may include a\nsubsidized financial scheme of the Netherlands Government, which is available only to Dutch\ncontractors, or similar schemes to be offered by other member countries.\n71. The Government has confirmed that its contributions will be reflected appropriately in the\nGovernment\u2019s Six-Year Development Program. The proposed level of local currency financing\nby  the  Bank  takes  into  account  the  Government\u2019s  continuing  inability  to  self-finance  a\nsubstantial proportion of the investment program required to enable Sri Lanka to undergo the\neconomic and social transition to a higher level of development and to reduce the high rate of\npoverty. Between 1994 and 1997, the Government had succeeded in reducing the budget deficit\nfrom 10.5  percent of GDP  to 7.9  percent.  Consistent  with  this  strategy, the 1998 budget\nimposed a 10 percent cut in expenditures other than salaries, pensions, and education and\nhealth activities. Outlays were significantly reduced with the retirement of the public debt in\n1997, utilizing the proceeds from privatization. On the revenue side, a goods and service tax\n(GST) was introduced in April 1998. Despite these measures, however, the budget deficit in\n1998 was 8.1 percent of GDP after taking into account privatization proceeds and grants. This\noutcome was largely due to the lower than anticipated tax receipts in the first year of operation\nof the GST and larger than anticipated outlays on capital investment and defense. For 1999, the\noverall budget deficit has been revised to 7.8 percent of GDP against a forecast of 6.5 percent.\n72. In recent years, the Government has taken a number of important actions to mobilize\nnonbudget investment finance for the country. They include the implementation of an ambitious\nprivatization program in sectors such as civil aviation, telecommunications, and the plantation\nindustry.  In  1997  and  again  in  1998,  the  Government  counterguaranteed  private  sector\nborrowing on the international capital market under the Bank\u2019s guarantee scheme. In addition,\nthe Government secured private investment in capital-intensive industries such as the power\nsupply and ports. An additional 10.5 percent of Government shares in Sri Lanka Telecom is\nexpected to be divested in 1999 and a bond issue of $200 million is planned for later this year.\nDespite  these  actions,  the  overall  capacity  of  the  Government  to  self-finance  the  public\ninvestment program in the coming years will be limited as debt servicing and the costs related to\nthe ongoing civil conflict continue to absorb about  50 percent  of  the budget  outlays.  The\nproposed level of local cost financing for the Project is therefore justified in view of (i) the\nprevailing difficult country circumstances, (ii) the positive environmental impact that the Project\nis expected to have, and (iii) the associated sustainable reduction in the level of poverty in the\npoor coastal communities.", "21\nE. Implementation Arrangements\n73. The Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development (MFARD) will be the EA,\nwith the following as Implementing Agencies (IAs): (i) CCD, which will coordinate and supervise\nthe coastline stabilization and CERM activities; (ii) DFAR, which will be responsible for the\ndevelopment and operation of the fisheries management systems and supervision of fish quality\nenhancement and resource conservation measures; and (iii) CFHC, which will supervise and\nmanage fisheries infrastructure development in the project areas. The EA is described in detail\nin Appendix 6.\n74. An interagency project steering committee (PSC) will be established within six months of\nloan effectiveness, to be chaired by the secretary of MFARD to ensure the full cooperation of\nand effective liaison with other relevant implementation agencies. The committee will have,\namong others, representatives from the National Planning Department, External Resources\nDepartment, Marine Pollution Prevention Authority, Ministry of Local Government and Provincial\nCouncils,  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development,  and  Ministry  of  Tourism.  During\ncommittee meetings, the representatives of the other relevant agencies will also be invited as\nrequired. Site-specific CCCs will also be established at the CERM project sites and will be\nchaired by the divisional secretaries for project sites under their jurisdiction. The CCCs will\ninclude representatives from fishery cooperatives, primary thrift and credit societies, women's\ngroups, and all relevant organizations. Close working relationships with active NGOs in the\nselected sites will be established to facilitate effective implementation of field-level activities, and\ntraining and skills development activities, will be linked to employment demand.\n75. MFARD will establish close working arrangements with NGOs/CBOs, in consultation\nwith the Bank, when project implementation commences. In view of the differing capacities and\ninvolvements of these agencies, MFARD felt that a uniform approach may not be desirable. The\ncriteria for selection of NGOs have been agreed upon with the Government and will be applied\nin  consultation  with  the  Bank.  The  NGOs  will  be  contracted  in  accordance  with  the\nGovernment\u2019s  standard  procedures  for  the  purpose.  In  principle,  the  Government  has  no\nobjection to bearing part of the administrative costs to be incurred by these NGOs for specific\nactivities. The matter will be decided depending on the scope of the involvement and the nature\nof the tasks to be undertaken.\n76. NGOs and CBOs have expressed keen interest in project activities at the community\nlevel, particularly with regard to CERM. IUCN, an international organization with extensive\nexperience in biodiversity conservation and CRM, has expressed interest in undertaking (i) SAM\nplanning  and facilitation, including design and  implementation  of  biodiversity  conservation\nprograms in the Bar Reef, Negombo, Madu Ganga, and Unawatuna Bay areas; (ii) planning and\nimplementation  of  activities  supplementary  to  the  IUCN/Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)\nProject in Kalametiya; and (iii) provision of technical advice and coordination of information,\neducation, and communication (IEC) activities, including workshops in the proposed SAM sites.\nSimilarly the Nature Conservation Group has expressed interest in being associated with coral\nreef  protection  and  rehabilitation  in  Unawatuna  Bay;  Seth  Sevana,  with  solid  waste\nmanagement in Lunawa; and the Environmental Foundation Limited (EFL), in environmental\nlegal  advocacy  activities.  Existing  credit  channels  can  ensure  credit  support  for\nlivelihood/microenterprise activities. The NGOs/CBOs at the CERM sites will assist individuals\nin gaining access to the required credit from existing sources. CCCs are expected to monitor the\nsupply of credit for such activities. MFARD has agreed to extend seed money, if required, to\nencourage livelihood development activities.\n1. Project Organization", "22\n77. To oversee the day-to-day implementation of the Project, a project management office\n(PMO) has been established in MFARD under a project director (PD) reporting to the secretary\nof  MFARD.  The  PD,  who  has  been  appointed,  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  project\nimplementation  including  monitoring,  reporting,  and  coordination.  Action  is  being  taken  to\nappoint the necessary PMO staff. A qualified accounting officer will assist in the monitoring and\nmanagement of project funds and requisitions, and a secretary and administrative and support\nstaff will be appointed. The PD will oversee project management and coordination activities and\nwill be responsible for ensuring that tender documents for the civil works, which are related to\ninvestment activities under the supervision and coordination of CCD and CFHC, are prepared\nby the project consultants. The PD will also be responsible for the production of all accounting,\nprogress, and other reports required by the Government and the Bank.\n78. The PD will directly supervise the six field project implementation units (FPIUs) at the\nCERM project sites and the two project implementation units (PIUs) at CCD and CFHC, which\nwill directly report to the PD. The FPIUs will have jurisdiction over the areas where project\ninvestments  will  be  implemented,  and  will  serve  as  conduits  for  funds  for  field-level\nimplementation. The site managers will coordinate with engineering staff of CCD, with respect to\nthe implementation of coastal protection activities, and with the district fishery extension officers\n(DFEOs) regarding fisheries-related activities. Each site manager will be supported by a CRM\nmobilizer and a social mobilizer, to be separately hired and who will be specifically responsible\nfor  oversight  of  CERM  interventions  and  liaison  with  target  communities  and  their\nrepresentatives. Fishery infrastructure development activities will be coordinated by  CFHC,\nwhich will report directly to the PMO.\n2. Implementation Schedule\n79. The Project will be implemented over a period of 66 months, with the first 12 months\ndevoted to preparatory activities including (i) establishment of a PMO at MFARD, PIUs at CCD\nand CFHC within the first 6 months, and FPIUs at six project sites; (ii) preparation of detailed\nengineering  designs  for  the  construction  of  coastal  protection  civil  works  and\nharbors/anchorages; (iii) social preparation and community organization work for CERM and\nlivelihood  development;  (iv)  training  and  skills  development  for  management  of  livelihood\nprojects; (v) provision of fellowships; and (vi) construction of social infrastructure facilities. The\nremaining period will be used for the full implementation of coastal stabilization works, CERM\nactivities  and  preparation  of  SAM  plans,  IEC  and  awareness  programs,  institutional\nstrengthening activities, and construction of harbors/anchorages. Six months will be allowed for\nproject completion activities. The proposed implementation schedule is in Appendix 7.\n80. At the end of the third year, a comprehensive midterm review will be conducted to\nassess project performance, identify problems and constraints encountered during the first two\nand  a  half  years  of  implementation,  and  propose  remedies  to  the  problems  identified.  A\nreassessment of project design will likewise be undertaken, including scope, the role of the IAs,\nand  the  various  implementation  arrangements,  including  any  reallocation  of  funds  among\ncomponents or adjustment of the project area, as required, for the remaining implementation\nperiod.\n3. Procurement\n81. The PMO will be responsible for the procurement of all goods and services under the\nProject. All services, supplies, and equipment to be financed by the Bank will be procured in\naccordance with the Bank\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and through local competitive bidding\n(LCB) in accordance with Government procedures, acceptable to the Bank. Bank-financed civil\nworks contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $1.0 million and above for the harbors and", "23\nall such contracts for the coastline stabilization component will be awarded on the basis of\ninternational competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\nOther Bank-financed civil works contracts (for harbors) of less than $1.0 million will be carried\nout by prequalified contractors selected under Government LCB procedures satisfactory to the\nBank. The award of contracts with a value of $500,000 equivalent and above will need prior\napproval by the Bank. All (or major) Bank-financed civil works contracts under the coastline\nstabilization  component  will  be  tendered  and  awarded  before  contracts  to  be  funded  by\ncommercial borrowings (to finance Part B of the coastline stabilization component of the Project)\nwill be tendered. Supply contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of more than $500,000 will\nbe awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding and $500,000 or less will be\nawarded on the basis of international shopping. Minor items costing less than $100,000 may be\nprocured by direct purchase. Information on the major contract packages is in Appendix 8.\n4. Consulting Services\n82. The Project will require 662 person-months of consulting services: 207 international and\n455 domestic. Of the total, about 366 person-months (129 international and 237 domestic) will\nsupport  project  implementation.  CCD  and  CFHC  will  need  design,  management,  and\nsupervision support for the civil works. Consulting services will also be provided to support\nareas such as the design and implementation of IEC programs, update of the CZMP, design\nand  implementation  of  the  corporate  training  programs  at  MFARD  and  its  key  agencies,\ndevelopment of a fishery harbor operations manual, design and installation of a data collection\nand  management  system  at  MFARD  and  its  key  agencies,  and  design  and  conduct  of\norientation courses on fisheries licensing and regulation. Other important areas to be supported\nare the conduct of research studies and benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) activities. The\noutline terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 9.\n83. The consultants will be recruited in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to the Bank on the engagement of domestic\nconsultants. The Government has requested advance action for recruitment of consultants that\nwill be financed under the Bank loan. Approval of advance action, however, does not in any way\ncommit the Bank to finance the Project.\n5. Accounts and Audit\n84. All agencies involved in implementation will prepare and maintain separate accounts\nfor project-related disbursements. The PMO will consolidate the accounts from the various\nFPIUs and submit them to MFARD, which will review the consolidated accounts and, after audit,\nsubmit them to the Ministry of Finance and the Bank. The audit report will include, among\nothers,  a  statement  verifying  that  funds  disbursed  by  the  Bank  against  statements  of\nexpenditures have been used for the purpose for which they were provided. Project accounts,\ntogether  with  disbursement  documents,  will  be  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors\nacceptable to the Bank, and will be submitted to the Bank within 12 months of the end of each\nfiscal year. Imprest account facilities will be established directly with MFARD, which has the\ncapacity to undertake and will be responsible for all administrative and accounting requirements\nrelating to the operation and utilization of such a fund. The statement of expenditure (SOE)\nprocedures will be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures and to liquidate advances\ncovered in the imprest account, in accordance with the Bank\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook\nand the detailed arrangements agreed upon by the Bank and the Government. The initial\namount to be deposited into the imprest account will not be more than the equivalent of\n$200,000 and any individual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under the SOE procedure\nwill not exceed the equivalent of $50,000. It may also be necessary to establish procedures to\nexpedite the processing of small contracts for local initiatives at the local government level.", "24\n6. Project Monitoring\n85. Initial work on the conceptualization of a monitoring system at the MFARD Planning\nDivision  is  currently  being  carried  out  under  the  FAO-funded  Bay  of  Bengal  Programme\n(BOBP). The data collection and management systems that will be established in CCD, DFAR,\nCFHC, and NARA under the proposed Project will support and complement efforts under BOBP\nso as to establish in MFARD a monitoring system that will serve as a valuable source of\ninformation for planning and programming.\n86. The monitoring system to be established in PMD of MFARD will be used to assemble,\nanalyze, and store data and information on all aspects of work of the IAs, and to provide\ninformation for project monitoring. Although the data requirements for project monitoring are\nnarrower in scope (related to project components) than those of MFARD (all activities of its\ndepartments, authorities, agencies, and corporations), they will share some common data. It is\nimportant that the monitoring system is seen as distinct from the general data systems, and is\nhandled and analyzed for a different purpose, i.e., to determine progress, to detect problems\nearly on, and to ensure effective planning and development. These are the main features of the\nproposed monitoring system:\n(i)  a central monitoring unit within PMD of MFARD, which will analyze, consolidate,\nand present information gathered from the operational departments and agencies\nof MFARD on both regular ministry program and project progress;\n(ii)  a project monitoring unit within PMO, which will monitor progress according to\nimplementation schedules and inputs in keeping with the design objectives;\n(iii)  a submonitoring unit within each IA (i.e., CCD, DFAR, and CFHC), which will\nmonitor their own activities and the progress of  their particular responsibilities;\nand\n(iv)  project field data and information collection, which will be undertaken through the\nFPIUs. Coastal protection monitoring will be handled by CCD's district and zonal\noffices (to be established under the Project at the start of implementation). CFHC\nwill conduct its own monitoring of harbor construction works.\n7. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation and Reporting\n87. A BME system will be designed and established at PMD of MFARD by December 2003,\nutilizing  information  collected and processed  through  the data  collection  and  management\nsystems of CCD, DFAR, CFHC, and NARA. BME will be undertaken by a team of consultants\nwho will commence work from the second year of project  implementation; they will be recruited\nfor one month every year and will prepare an annual report. The team will be composed of (i) a\ncivil  engineer  from  a  private  civil  engineering  firm,  (ii)  a  natural  resources  management\nspecialist from a national university, and (iii) a social and livelihood assessment expert with\nextensive experience in community-level social mobilization and livelihood and credit assistance\nfrom an NGO. The PMO will submit, through the EA, semiannual progress reports and annual\nfinancial reports. A project completion report will also be submitted at the end of the Project\nwithin not more than 12 months of project completion.", "25\nF. Environment and Social Measures\n1.  Environment\n88. The Project is expected to yield significant environmental benefits in terms of resource\nconservation, pollution abatement, and improvement of public health. Many of the proposed\nactivities are, in fact, in the nature of environmental mitigation or enhancement measures\nthemselves. The coastal protection works to be set up will prevent substantial losses due to\ncoastal erosion in residential, commercial, and industrial facilities as well as road and railway\ninfrastructure. The Project will also prevent damage to the natural environment, such as wetland\nareas and other coastal habitat along the coastline. Coastal protection works under the Project\nwill yield direct benefits from the land that would be saved with the stabilization of erosion at the\nproject sites. Modeling studies indicate that the impact of the physical stabilization measures\nover 52 km will be felt over a much larger area. Coastline stabilization will produce innumerable\nbenefits to the tourism industry, which is the second largest foreign exchange earner of the\ncountry next to the tea industry.\n89. CERM activities as well as various community development, poverty reduction, and\ninstitutional  strengthening  activities  are  expected  to  yield  overall  positive  environmental\nbenefits. Measures to mitigate problems affecting the ecological integrity of coastal habitats will\nresult in improvements in their economic, aesthetic, and recreational values and subsequently\nensure their long-term sustainability. The rehabilitation and conservation of coastal habitats and\nadoption  of  fisheries  management  measures  will  lead  to  increased  fish  availability  and,\nconsequently, increased fish catches and higher incomes for fisherfolk.\n90. In addition, the Project is expected to generate significant socioeconomic benefits to the\ncoastal communities as a result of the establishment of the fishery harbors/anchorages and the\nresultant improved efficiency of fishing operations due to the availability of support facilities. The\nproposed fishing harbors and anchorages are all located in intensive fishing areas, and fish\nlanding activities have been practised at all sites. The two fishing harbors (in Chilaw and\nHambantota)  will  be  established  on  existing  facilities.  To  minimize  further  environmental\nimpacts from the activities, each of the fishing harbors and anchorages will be provided with a\nsolid waste management system; wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal system; oil\nwaste collection system; and adequate sanitation facilities. For each, the effluent from fishery\nactivities will meet the government environmental standard. These measures will improve the\ngeneral environmental condition of the fishing harbors and anchorages.\n91. The environmental  impact assessment  (EIA)  and  the  summary  EIA  (SEIA)  for  the\nProject were prepared following the Bank\u2019s environmental guidelines.13 The EIA has been\nreviewed and endorsed by the concerned agencies of the Government. The EIA assesses the\npositive as well as the adverse environmental impacts arising from the project interventions.\nThe  potential  adverse  impacts  include  quarry  and  transport  of  materials,  offshore  sand\nextraction,  and  dredging.  Impact  mitigation  measures  have  been  identified  and  will  be\nimplemented. They relate mainly to sand extraction, which will be carried out in deepsea areas\nat least beyond 8 km offshore; and dredging, which will be limited to 2 meters (m) below the\nexisting seabed levels, at depths equal to or greater than 15 m below mean sea level, to avoid\nhydraulic and geotechnical problems. The dredging of the harbor basin is not likely to result in\nsignificant impacts on the biota and the ecology of the area.\n92. The EIA concluded that the adverse environmental impacts arising from the Project\ncould be minimized to acceptable levels through the implementation of a set of mitigation\n                                                       \n13  The SEIA was circulated to the Board on 29 July 1999.", "26\nmeasures. Additional environmental investigation for the coastal stabilization component, and\nharbors and anchorages will be undertaken in accordance with Government guidelines, and\nGovernment clearance will be obtained prior to implementation of the works.\n2.  Social Dimensions\n93. The project area  extends from  Puttalam  in  the  northwest  to  Tangalle  in the  south\n(excepting Matara district). It is heavily populated, and has a marine fishing population of\n145,000, of which 35,000 are active fishers. From the results of a rapid social assessment\nsurvey in selected coastal communities in the project area, it is estimated that about 24 percent\nof the households in the coastal areas of the six districts have an income below SLRs30,000 per\nyear.  Of  the  remaining  households,  about  13  percent  receive  a  household  income  of\nSLRs30,000-45,000, 22 percent enjoy a household income of SLRs45,000-63,000 and another\n17 percent earn SLRs63,000-80,000 per year. The major target group of the Project will be the\nabove groups,  amounting  to about  76,500  households.  The  remaining  24,000  households\n(about 24 percent of the total), comprise moderate (13 percent) and high (11 percent) income\nearners  with  earnings  greater  than  SLRs80,000  per  year  per  household.  An  initial  social\nassessment of the project area is in Appendix 10.\n94. Aside from its resource management thrusts, the Project also is expected to actively\ninvolve the target groups, including women, in project implementation, through the formation of\nCCCs and the involvement of local NGOs/CBOs. These measures will assist in mainstreaming\nthe beneficiary population in resource management and poverty reduction efforts. In anticipation\nof their active participation in the Project and to give them a sense of project ownership, which\nare critical to its success as a community-based undertaking, socioeconomic surveys, national-\nand local-level workshops, and focus group discussions were conducted as part of the project\ndesign process. The results of the surveys and local-level consultations revealed the beneficiary\npopulation\u2019s problems, needs, wants, and aspirations.\n95. Project intervention has been designed to encourage the communities to perceive the\nneed for reducing exploitation and adopting conservation measures, while at the same time\ndemonstrating  that  additional  income  can  be  generated  through  improved  fish  handling,\nreduction in postharvest losses, etc. The Project will complement ongoing Government efforts\nto address widespread poverty in the fishing community in the country. There is need for\nconcerted  efforts  to  encourage  alternative  livelihood  development  activities  through  skills\ntraining and provision of credit, both of which activities  are expected to be  performed by\nNGOs/CBOs. It is also expected that women members of the community will be mobilized to\nplay an important role in household income generation, management of fisheries organizations,\nand resource conservation.\n3.  Gender Analysis\n96. Women\u2019s labor is mainly used in fish landing, net cleaning, and net repairs. Traditionally\nwomen  have  also  been  involved  in  fish  curing  and  employed  in  prawn  farming.  These\nopportunities have been affected by the destruction of resources in the lagoons, which affects\nprawn fishing and eliminates the surplus fish catch for drying. Beach erosion has also affected\nnet mending sites and places for vending small catches.\n97. The potential and the capacities of women to take advantage of new opportunities for\nincome generation to reduce poverty and deprivation and the sole dependence on fishing have\nbeen  the  focus  of  several  studies.  The  findings  have  underscored  the  capacity  of  fisher\ncommunities, particularly through the initiatives of women, to adapt to nontraditional lifestyles\nand occupations, provided that an external catalyst works with them and takes them through the", "27\nlong period of adjustment and change. There is consensus that women have a positive role in\npoverty reduction through the adoption of enhanced nonfishing activities. Women in the fishing\ncommunities  in  the  project  locations  could  be  mobilized  to  become  active  participants  in\nlivelihood development activities in the project and to eventually become instruments through\nwhich undue dependence on a depleting resource in fishing can be severed. Women\u2019s groups,\nwhich actively participated in the planning for the Project, have been actively involved in the\nSAM planning process and expressed interest in availing themselves of credit for livelihood\ndevelopment activities. Skills development training will target women\u2019s groups to the extent\npossible. Women\u2019s groups will also be involved in the community organization efforts under the\nCERM component, particularly in programs relating to improvement of sanitation and other\nservices. NGOs/CBOs involved with the CERM activities are expected to assist women in\naccessing credit and undertaking income-generating activities.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Economic Analysis\n98. The overall economic viability of the Project was analyzed by calculating the stream of\nnet incremental costs and benefits attributable to the various components over a period of 20\nyears. The calculation of incremental costs was based on the estimates of investment cost\nitems consisting of civil works and construction, capital goods including initial operational inputs,\nconsulting services, training, initial working capital requirements, and research and surveys. In\naddition, recurrent costs including O&M costs incurred during project implementation and after\ncompletion were calculated. All costs were expressed in 1999 constant economic values.\n99. Incremental  economic  benefits  were  estimated  from  all  the  components  except\ninstitutional strengthening. Economic benefits expected from coastline stabilization are (i) the\nprevention of economic losses to the national economy such as value of houses and buildings\nsaved due to the Project; (ii) avoidance of removal and administrative costs and disruption of\nwork; and (iii) the opportunity costs of agricultural land and potential losses in tourist industry\nthat will be prevented with the implementation of the Project. Economic benefits from CERM are\nbased on (i) use values as generated by the increased production of the coastal shrimp, small\npelagic, and lagoon fisheries as well as by recreational values and ecotourism benefits; and\n(ii) nonuse values such as biodiversity and foreign tourists\u2019 willingness to pay (WTP). Economic\nbenefits derived from fisheries management and fish quality improvement are the projected\nincreases in fish landings and reductions in loss of fish production as a result of improved fish\nhandling and processing.\n1. Economic Benefits\n100. With the coastline stabilization component, it is expected that 52 km of coastline will be\nsaved in the with-Project situation. The area that will be saved from erosion is estimated at\n10.23 ha each year or about 204.6 ha over the life of the Project. The value of houses that will\nbe protected from erosion is estimated at about $1.27 million each year or about $25.40 million\nover 20 years. This benefit is in addition to the savings of owners from not having to remove the\nbuilding remains or lose work time and income, and also the prevented loss of agricultural\nproduction. Potential losses from tourism that will be avoided are estimated at about $5.1 million\neach year, or $102 million over the life of the Project.\n101. Quantifiable benefits from the CERM component are derived from the estimated use\nvalues concerning biodiversity; value of production generated from the lagoon, coastal shrimp,\nand  small  pelagic  fisheries;  and  the  perceived  tourists\u2019  WTP  for  use  of  the  lagoons  for\nrecreation.", "28\n102. Benefits from the fisheries management and fish quality improvement component are\nprimarily from increased fish landings due to the construction of fishery harbors. Incremental fish\nlandings  are  expected  to  increase  from  897  tons  per  year  (t/yr)  in  year  3  of  project\nimplementation to 5,861 t/yr in year 6 and onward. Moreover, increases in fish supply are\nenvisioned due to about 20 percent reduction in postharvest losses over the duration of the\nProject.\n103. Based on the economic cost and benefit streams generated from each of the economic\nanalyses carried out for the various investment activities under the different components, the\neconomic internal rate of return for the whole Project was estimated at 15.3 percent. The\ndetailed economic analysis is attached as Appendix 11.\n2. Other Benefits\n104. The Project is expected to have numerous nonquantifiable benefits not included in the\npreceding analysis. The principal ones consist of (i) institutional strengthening of MFARD and its\nkey  agencies  directly  involved  in  the  implementation  of  project-related  activities;\n(ii) enhancement  of  interagency  linkages  through  cooperation  in  the  coordination  and\nimplementation of CRM plans and activities; (iii) improved and effective resource management\nand protection; (iv) enhanced beneficiary participation in resource management and project\nimplementation; (v) establishment of  strong partnerships among the  local  government, the\ncommunities, and NGOs/CBOs in community-based resource management; (vi) increased food\nsupply,  improved  nutrition,  and  health;  and  (vii)  improved  community  welfare.  Other\nnonquantifiable benefits include the retardation of coastal resource depletion and degradation\nthrough effective environmental protection and resource management as well as the promotion\nof beneficiary participation in community-based CRM and in project implementation.\nB. Impact on Poverty\n105. Though coastal stabilization appears to be an infrastructure component it contains a\nnumber of tangible as well as intangible impacts that will impinge directly on the poor coastal\ncommunities, particularly the large numbers of small-scale fisherfolk inhabiting the coastal zone.\nAround 5,300 fishing families are estimated to directly benefit from beach protection, and about\n1,800 permanent and temporary seafront houses, most of which belong to fisherfolk, will be\nprotected in and around the project sites. Although in  calculating the benefits  the Project\nassumes a modest 10 ha of land that will be saved per year, the favorable impacts of coastal\nstabilization are estimated to benefit about 400 ha of coconut plantations and 1,300 ha of home\ngardens in the project area. The harbors and anchorages are primarily meant to support more\nmechanized fishing. Nevertheless, members of poor fishing families will also benefit widely from\nthe additional employment opportunities that will be generated by the development of multiday\nfishing centered on these harbors and anchorages. It is estimated that over 1,000 jobs will be\ncreated  at  the  four  sites.  Simultaneously,  with  the  new/additional  facilities,  harbors  and\nanchorages will provide opportunities to improve the efficacy of fishing operations of poor\nfisherfolk, and help upgrade the quality of fish, reduce postharvest losses, and ultimately secure\nhigher prices/incomes, which are estimated to increase by about 10-15 percent. The CERM\ncomponent  will  include  measures  aimed  at  countering  marine  resource  depletion,  water\npollution, and deterioration of coastal habitats through an integrated approach. This program\nwill  also  help  to  obtain  the  active  participation  of  the  coastal  communities  in  resource\nmanagement, to empower them and encourage them to make informed decisions on the use of\ntheir resources. The CERM component will contribute to the improvement of the health and\nsanitary conditions of the communities, particularly those living around the marshes, wetlands,\nand lagoons.", "29\nC. Project Risks\n106. It  is  believed  that  the  technical  innovations  proposed  are  sound.  If  properly\nimplemented,  they  should  pose  no  serious  risk.  In  integrated  projects  like  this,  however,\nefficiency and interagency cooperation will require special efforts. The participatory nature of\nthe  Project  will  require  regular  consultations  with  target  groups  whose  full  cooperation  is\nessential. Attitudinal changes are essential to project success, particularly toward environmental\nprotection and quality control practices. The ongoing civil conflict is unlikely to affect project\nimplementation as the sites are not involved in the strife.\n107. Certain overlaps and contradictions that exist between the mandates of MFARD and its\nagencies, and between MFARD and its units and those of other Government agencies, impede\nthe effective management of the coastal resources sector. In this regard, the Project has\nidentified  specific  countermeasures,  such  as  the  proposal  to  replace  the  present  Coast\nConservation Act with a new law incorporating various amendments to rationalize the statutes\nthat give similar powers over the coastal zone to other ministries or authorities, and which have,\nin effect, caused the powers, functions, and duties of CCD to be eroded over the years.\n108. Institutional inadequacies of the EA/IAs, and the lack of cooperation and coordination\nbetween Government agencies and different levels of Government are also obstacles to project\nsuccess. The different mandates, priorities, and funding allocations of various Government\nagencies  could  become  obstacles  to  establishing  efficient  and  effective  coordinating\nmechanisms for project implementation. Countermeasures to this  risk  include  (i) a  careful\ndesign and  vigorous  implementation  of  the project's  institutional  strengthening  component,\nwhich aims to build the capacity of the EA/IAs; (ii) formation of a PSC at the national level and\nof  CCCs  at  the  local  level;  (iii)  provision  of  long-term  consultants  for  EA/IAs,  and  NGO\nassistance to FPIUs and local governments; and (iv) design and implementation of an effective\nmonitoring and reporting system, with a view to obtaining prompt feedback and allowing timely\nremedies.\n109. The lack of Government counterpart funds may also delay implementation. After project\ncompletion,  the  small  annual  budget  allocated  to  the  coastal  resources  sector,  including\nfisheries,  may  also  jeopardize  the  sustainability  of  the  various  management  systems\nestablished  under  the  Project,  such  as  maintenance  of  coastline  stabilization  schemes,\nparticularly beach nourishment. The annual budget requirement for the O&M of the various\nmeasures to be established under the Project has been estimated. The  Government fully\nrecognizes the importance of maintaining the coastline stabilization schemes and is committed\nto providing sufficient allocations under the national budget to sustain project activities and long-\nterm impacts.\n110. One of the more difficult tasks facing the Project is that of fostering the growth of new\nattitudes  and  mind  set  toward  resource  management,  environmental  protection,  social\nempowerment,  fish  quality,  hygiene,  marketing,  and  interagency  cooperation.  The  mental\noutlook and defensive instincts of both coastal communities and local officials will have to be\naddressed in a long-term program of education, awareness, motivation, and trust-building.\nFailure to achieve progress in this task will seriously diminish the chances of achieving the\nmajor project goals. To counteract this risk, the Project will conduct IECs at the national and\nlocal  levels.  For  the  government  agencies,  there  will  be  regular  workshops  and  briefing\nsessions. Participating officers will be encouraged to share their positive experiences, and\nefforts will be pursued to disseminate such feedback widely.", "30\nVI.      ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n111. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  As  its  contribution  for  efficient  implementation  of  the  Project  and  its  long-term\nimpacts,  the  Government  will  maintain  at  all  times  during  and  after  project\nimplementation adequate budgetary allocation, infrastructure support and staff, as\nrequired for the efficient administration and implementation of the Project and its\nlong-term impacts.\n(ii)  The Government will maintain adequate budgetary provision to meet the recurring\ncosts on annual maintenance of coastline stabilization works and annual expenses\nfor monitoring coastal erosion.\n(iii)  The Government will have its contribution for the Project reflected appropriately in its\nSix-Year Development Program.\n(iv)  The  Government  will  provide  adequate  counterpart  funding  and  appropriately\nqualified staff to carry out project activities.\n(v)  The  Government  will  establish  all  the  necessary  agencies  for  effective\nimplementation of the Project including the PMO,14 PIUs and FPIUs, within not more\nthan six months of loan effectiveness.\n(vi)  Prior to implementation, the Government will obtain EIA approval for the individual\ncomponents (coastline stabilization and specific sites for fishing harbors/anchorages)\nafter detailed designs are prepared.\n(vii)  Subsidies on fishing boats will be progressively phased out by reducing 15 percent\nannually for coastal and offshore boats and will be restricted only to offshore vessels\nafter 2002. These subsidies will continue to be targeted to poor fishermen, and used\nto encourage the shift to offshore fishing and facilitate adoption of new technology for\ndiversified fishing, navigation equipment, and improved preservation of the catch.

Coastal erosion management activities are proposed to be undertaken to cover about 52\nkilometers (km) of the coast in selected stretches. The seven sites were selected out of a list of\nkey areas1 and singular cases2 in the Master Plan for Coastal Erosion Management (MPCEM),\nbased on the following considerations: (i) geomorphologic settings; (ii) magnitude of erosion; (iii)\nutilities affected (e.g., roads, railway, church, mosque); (iv) resources degraded and threatened;\n(v) impact of human interference contributing to the problem (e.g., with poorly designed and\nunplanned protection structures); (vi) public/political demand or will for a solution; and (vii)\nfeasibility to design an effective and efficient coast conservation concept.  Of the seven sites,\nthe  coastal  stretches  of  Maha  Oya-Lansigama,  Colombo  North-Dickowita, and Payagala\n(Kalutara River mouth to Maggona Headland), altogether comprising a 31 km length, are the\nworst  affected  coastal  reaches.  The  sites  Wadduwa-Kalutara,  Beruwela-Bentota,  and\nHikkaduwa-Galle need  urgent  consideration  for  coastal  erosion  management  and  possibly\nphysical  intervention. Beruwela-Bentota is a very important coastal stretch because it has the\nhighest concentration of high-value tourist hotels and resorts; soft interventions seem to be\nrequired to avoid resource degradation of this vulnerable area. Hikkaduwa-Galle is an area with\na high resource diversity (coral reefs, sea grass, fisheries, urban area, tourism). Although the\nstretch seems to have been rather stable during the last decade, it is highly vulnerable as\nrecords of shoreline variation during the last century show.\n2. The Coastal Environment and Resource Management (CERM) sites considered under\nthe  Project  were  selected from 23  sites  identified  in  the  Coastal  Zone  Management Plan\n(CZMP), 1997 as potential areas for application of the special area management (SAM) process\nas well as for limited interventions. Since 11 of these sites are outside the project area (i.e., from\nKalpitiya in the northwest to Kirinda in the southeast), the remaining 12 sites were prioritized\nbased  on  selection  criteria  developed  by  the  consultant  in  collaboration  with  the  Coast\nConservation Department (CCD) and stakeholders, and the final list of nine CERM sites drawn\nup. The site selection criteria include the following: (i) presence of sensitive habitats/endangered\nspecies;  (ii)  degree  of  threat  to  environment  or  resource  and  need  for  protection  or\nrehabilitation; (iii) opportunity for community participation, level of political will, and opportunities\nfor building on past efforts or for synergies with other programs; and (iv) beneficiary population,\npotential for creation of livelihood opportunities, and improvement of the environment. The main\nproblems affecting the nine sites selected for consideration under the Project are described\nbriefly.\n(i) Negombo Lagoon supports a rich fishery industry and growing foreign and local\ntourism. Threats to the lagoon include an expanding population exerting pressure\non the habitat for land and extraction of resources, user conflicts, and pollution\ndue to industries, prawn farming, and siltation.\n(ii) Lunawa Lagoon is currently experiencing heavy pollution due to discharges of\nindustrial and domestic wastes over the past years. The situation is aggravated\nby the disconnection of the lagoon from the sea due to the formation of sandbars\nat the opening to the sea. The lagoon is nearly devoid of fauna and flora and\n                                               \n1  Key areas are morphologically complex areas incorporating several characteristic morphological elements, and where diverse\ndevelopment pressure indicates the need for integrated solutions encompassing a coastal reach of several kilometers in\nlength.\n2  Singular cases are areas that can be treated in isolation. They cover a limited coastal area where the processes causing\nerosion are self-evident and easily ascertained.", "Appendix 3, page 2\nposes health threats with the reported increasing incidence of mosquito-related\ndiseases.\n(iii) Madu Ganga Estuary and Lagoon recently gained importance for ecotourism and\nconventional  recreation-based  tourism  such  as  speed  boating  and  surfing.\nHowever, the recent increase in tourism activities has given rise to conflicts with\nfisheries resource use, posing a potential threat to both resource use activities\nand to the pristine nature of the habitat.\n(iv) Unawatuna Bay is a popular tourist site due to its beautiful scenery, beach, and\ncoral reefs, and has been traditionally used for fishing. Tourism in the area has\nbeen adversely affected by unplanned construction on the beach and in the\nsurrounding areas. Fishing is also under threat due to overfishing of ornamental\nfish in the reefs and the use of dynamite for offshore fishing. Close by is a unique\nbiodiversity-rich habitat, Rummassala Hillock.\n(v) Kalametiya Lagoon is associated with wetlands rich in biodiversity and provides a\nhabitat for migratory bird species. It is unique in its being a nesting area for\nmigratory  turtles.  Threats  to  the  lagoon  habitat  include  altered  water  flows\n(change of salinity levels) to the lagoons due to upstream irrigation water use,\noverfishing, shell and coral mining, mangrove cutting, and poaching of turtle\neggs.\n(vi) Mawella  Lagoon  is  in  close  proximity  to  Kalametiya.  Its  habitat  conditions,\neconomic use, and potential threats are very similar to those at Kalametiya.\n(vii) Bar Reef is one of a few remaining coral reefs in Sri Lanka that are still in a\nrelatively pristine condition. Although the area has been declared as a sanctuary,\nreef  biodiversity  is  threatened  due  to  inadequate  management  and  fishing,\nparticularly for ornamental fish for export.\n(viii) Hikkaduwa is a very popular tourist resort area due to its sandy beaches, shallow\nsea, and coral reefs. Although the Hikkaduwa coral reef area has been declared\nas a marine sanctuary, and attempts to manage it as a SAM site have been\nundertaken, there are still threats to this critical natural habitat which, if not\naddressed, will lead to the loss of biodiversity and further loss of revenue from\ntourism.\n(ix) The Tangalle-Hambantota area comprises a variety of important ecological and\nnatural  features,  including  extensive  sand  dunes  and  strand  vegetation  that\nsupport numerous birds and other wildlife. The area is affected by sand mining\nwithin the dune areas, unauthorized construction on the dunes, and unplanned\ndisposal of solid waste in the more populated areas. The Government plans to\nundertake  extensive  development  within  the  district,  which  include  the\nconstruction of a port, a refinery, a new city, and highways, will need to be\nimplemented keeping in mind the environmental impact on the area.\n3. Fishery harbors/anchorages are proposed for development in areas where there is an\nurgent need to minimize environmental degradation resulting from the use of coastal habitats for\nfish landing and boat anchorage. These sites were selected from a long list of potential sites\nusing evaluation criteria developed by the consultant in collaboration with the Ceylon Fishery", "Appendix 3, page 3\nHarbours Corporation (CFHC), the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (DFAR),\nand Fisheries Sector Development Project (Loan 1201-SRI) funded by the Asian Development\nBank.  The  criteria  include  geographical  considerations,  existing  facilities,  demand\nconsiderations, presence of support infrastructure facilities, and impacts on the environment.\nThe sites are described briefly.\n(i) Chilaw harbor will be located on the western side of the lagoon channel in the\narea of the existing fish market on both sides of the bridge. Presently, a large\nfleet of 3,400 boats operate from Chilaw lagoon. Of the total fleet, 133 multiday\nboats, 110 day boats with inboard engines (IBE boats), and 1,457 fiberglass\nreinforced plastic (FRP) boats are badly in need of landing facilities, as the only\nlanding area in use is at the fish market adjacent to the bridge over the lagoon\nchannel. For lack of appropriate facilities, all boats have to be beached, and the\nplace is heavily congested during peak hours. The existing auction hall is dark\nand dirty and does not provide the space and hygienic conditions required for\nproper handling of fish.\n(ii) Hambantota Bay has long been established as an anchorage and, although\nrelatively unprotected, apparently provides some protection from the worst of the\nsouthwest monsoon storms. There is, however, a need to reconstruct the old\njetty structures at the western end of the bay as fishers have to pass the zone of\nbreaking waves to get their boats closer to the beach. This has resulted in\nnumerous fatal accidents during times of adverse wave conditions, especially\nduring the southwest monsoon. Rehabilitation of the brick retaining wall along the\nelevated road behind the beach, which has partly collapsed, is also required.\nAbout 600 fishers operate from Hambantota, and the local fleet is composed of\n249 traditional crafts, 17 IBE boats, and 84 outboard engine (OBE) boats 6-8\nmeters long. There  are  presently no  safe  anchorage facilities for  IBE  boats\nbetween Tangalle and Kirinda. An estimated 361 multiday boats, 86 IBE day\nboats, and 521 FRP OBE boats operate from Tangalle. In addition,multiday boats\nfrom Hambantota berth at Tangalle for want of any facility in Hambantota. As a\nresult, the Tangalle fishery harbor is overcrowded.\n(iii) Ambalangoda and Kalametiya anchorage sites were identified as high-priority\nsites and were selected based on a set of criteria that include the following: high\ndemand for anchorage facilities, presence of support infrastructure facilities (i.e.,\nroadways, freshwater supply, power facilities, market facilities, fuel, ice, and craft\nrepair facilities). Sizable local fishing populations in these areas own small fishing\ncraft and who, due to the nature of their craft, are not likely to be served by the\nadditional anchorage capacity to be created by the ongoing Hikkaduwa harbor\ndevelopment and the existing Kirinda harbor. As in Hambantota, multiday boats\nas well as IBE boats are unable to berth at Kalametiya due to the lack of a\nharbor/anchorage there.", "Appendix 4\nDETAILED PROJECT COST SUMMARY\n($ million)\nLocal\nCurrency\nItem      Foreign (Excl.

The overall responsibility for fisheries and coastal resource management in Sri Lanka is\nvested in the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development (MFARD), which is\nheaded by a cabinet minister assisted by a state minister and administered by a secretary and\ntwo  additional  secretaries.  MFARD  has  two  main  departments:  the  Coast  Conservation\nDepartment (CCD) and the Department of Fisheries and  Aquatic  Resources  (DFAR).  The\nministry has functions related to all fishery matters, including administration, policy making,\nmanagement, development, research, and monitoring and evaluation. The National Institute of\nFisheries Training and the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency\n(NARA) are other key agencies working under the administrative control of MFARD. MFARD\nhas clear goals and its departments have elaborated their strategic plans. MFARD is currently\nplanning a reorganization to improve its organizational efficiency through the setting up of three\ndivisions within the ministry for policy making and monitoring, planning and development, and\nadministration and finance. MFARD is increasingly becoming aware of the need to improve its\ninstitutional and technical capacities and is keen to develop the ability to efficiently manage the\nfisheries resources and reduce the emphasis on welfare activities. A number of other public and\nprivate  institutions  are  involved  in  the  sector.  These  include  nongovernment\norganizations/community-based organizations, training institutes, and fisheries cooperatives,\nwhich are mostly active in providing needed services and support to fishing communities,\nparticularly in the areas of small-scale credit, employment generation, and welfare activities.\n2. CCD is the agency mandated to exercise overall responsibility for activities within the\ncoastal zone. CCD originated as the Coast Protection Unit within the Colombo Port Commission\nin 1963, evolved into the Coast Conservation Division of MFARD in 1978, and was upgraded to\na department with the coming into force of the Coast Conservation Act (CCA) in 1983. Its main\nfunctions, as provided in the CCA, are (i) the survey of the coastal zone and preparation of a\ncoastal zone management plan; (ii) regulation and control of development activities within the\ncoastal zone; and (iii) formulation and execution of schemes of work for coast conservation in\nthe coastal zone. Since its creation, the core activity of CCD has been the regulation and\ncontrol of development activities within the coastal zone by requiring permits to be obtained\nfrom the director of the department before any development  in  a  specific  coastal area  is\nundertaken. CCD is organized into three operational divisions: (i) Planning, Research, and\nDesign Division; (ii) Works Division; and (iii) Coastal Resources Management Division. CCD\npublished its policy framework Coastal 2000 \u2013 Recommendation for a Resource Management\nStrategy for Sri Lanka\u2019s Coastal Region in 1992, and the Coastal Zone Management Plan in\n1997. CCD plays a lead role in the formulation and implementation of special plans, programs,\nand projects (including multisector, interagency initiatives such as special area management\n(SAM). CCD follows the guidelines and recommendations made in its strategic plans, but needs\nmore trained staff at all levels to implement its policy. CCD has no field staff of its own and\ncarries out its enforcement action using the district secretariat and the local police force. The\nWorks Division undertakes most of the physical works for erosion protection.\n3. DFAR is the largest of MFARD's functional organizations and is the main implementing\nagency for the administration, development, regulation, and monitoring of fisheries and living\naquatic resources. It is also responsible for extension and other technical and welfare services\nto fishing communities. The department is charged with the administration and enforcement of\nthe Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act of 1991 (or the Fisheries Act) and related ordinances,\npolicies, development and regulation of fishing through the issuance of licenses and permits,\nand  inspection  and  monitoring  of  fishery  activities  in  general.  DFAR  has  four  divisions:", "Appendix 6, page 2\n(i) Industry, (ii) Management, (iii) Administration, and (iv) Finance. In the past, DFAR was\nmainly engaged in the provision of welfare services. Only in the last four years has DFAR been\nin  charge  of  the  administration  and  enforcement  of  the  Fisheries  Act  (policies,  licensing,\nregulation, monitoring). The Six-Year Fishery Development Program 1999-2004 proposes a\nbetter and efficient reorganization for a stronger and more autonomous DFAR to exclusively\nundertake regulation, enforcement, extension, and management.\n4. NARA, the research arm of MFARD, was established under the NARA Act No. 54 of\n1981, which emphasizes its responsibility for development and management of all living and\nnonliving aquatic resources. It was created as a semiautonomous institution within MFARD in\n1981, and the research functions were transferred to it from the ministry in 1982. NARA is\noverseen by a governing board responsible for administration and general functions. Technical\nand scientific matters are supervised by a Science and Technical Committee.\n5. The Ceylon Fishery Harbours Corporation (CFHC) established in 1972 under the State\nIndustrial Corporations Act of 1957 is under the supervision of MFARD. CFHC is charged with\nthe responsibility for construction, operation, and management of fishery harbors and related\nfacilities which, up to that time, had been the responsibility of the Ceylon Fisheries Corporation.\nThe  main  objectives  of  CFHC  were  amended  in  March  1997 to  address  a  number  of\nadministrative difficulties. CFHC is now in charge of the operation and maintenance of seven\nfishery  harbors  and  22  anchorages,  and  is  responsible  for  cost  recovery  of  the  services\nprovided so that the harbors will ultimately be self-financing for operational purposes. CFHC is\ndivided into six divisions: (i) Civil Engineering, (ii) Mechanical Engineering, (iii) Finance, (iv)\nLegal, (v) Supplies, and (vi) Administration. Since 1995 CFHC is more business oriented, and\nworks towards cost recovery of the services provided.

Introduction\n1. To assist in the design of the proposed Coastal Resource Management Project (CRMP),\nparticularly its coastal environment and resource management (CERM) component, a rapid social\nassessment (RSA) of target beneficiaries was conducted within the identified project area. To\ngenerate the desired information on the socioeconomic conditions and needs/demands of the target\nbeneficiaries, the RSA of 750 households employed a combination of structured surveys and\nstakeholder workshops and focus group discussions (FGDs) among selected communities within\nthe identified project sites. The results of the RSA surveys and FGDs were analyzed and, together\nwith other pertinent secondary information from the district and divisional secretary division (DSD)\noffices, discussed with representatives of local institutions and selected coastal communities and\ndistricts within the project area.\n2. The RSA was conducted to\n(i)  identify the potential beneficiaries, including women, children, and vulnerable groups,\nlikely to be affected by the Project;\n(ii)  identify and describe the status of the target beneficiaries to describe their physical\nlocation and present socioeconomic characteristics and conditions. The information\nwill serve as benchmark against which future improvements could be compared;\n(iii)  analyze the target populations' need or demand for the project and gauge the level\nof contribution they are willing to make to become involved in it;\n(iv)  generate information to be used as inputs in the design of project activities and \nimplementation  arrangements  that  will  permit  community  participation  and\ninvolvement; and\n(v)  provide the basis for the analysis of the social dimensions of the proposed Project,\nincluding gender issues and concerns, beneficiary participation, and possible \ninvolvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  community-based\norganizations (CBOs) in implementation, and for the design of measures to prevent\nnegative economic or social impacts of the proposed project components and\nactivities on the target beneficiaries.\nB. Overview of the Project Area\n3. The proposed project area extends from Puttalam district in the northwest to Tangalle district\nin the south. Home to nearly half of the country\u2019s population, the area (mainly coastal areas in the\nsix districts) is heavily populated and has a significant marine fishing population. According to the\n1996 census, active fishers number around 50,000 between Kalpitiya in the northwest and Kirinda\nin the southeast, and there may be around 60,000 fishers in the rest of the country (east and north).\nThe percentage of active fishers in the population of each fisheries district varies within a narrow\nrange of 22.4 percent in Kalmunai to 27 percent in Puttalam. The average fisher household has 4.8\nmembers (range=4.4-5.1), with on the average 1.2 fishers per household. Fishers with fishing crafts\nin each district vary between 2.2 in Chilaw and 8.4 in Kalmunai, with the overall average at around\n4.0. Fishers are predominantly male (99 percent) and 15 percent are typically migrant fishers. The\ndistribution of households in the project area by annual income is in Table A10.1. Table A10.2 gives\nthe distribution of occupations for the different districts.\nTable A10.1: Households in the Project Areas, by Annual Income\nNumber of Households Percent\nAnnual Income for All\nRange (SLRs) Sites", "Appendix 10, page 2\nChilaw Negombo     Lunawa Unawatuna    Madu Kalametiya       All\n  Ganga     Sites\n>100,000 1,380 3,487 590 2,590 1,256 1,891 11,194 11\n80,001-100,000 1,642 4,755 738 2,822 1,675 1,560 13,192 13\n63,001-80,000 2,015 6,149 758 3,959 2,405 2,143 17,429 17\n45,001-63,000 2,967 6,434 1,107 4,675 3,229 3,357 21,769 22\n30,001-45,000 1,877 4,152 694 2,738 1,486 1,828 12,775 13\n18,001-30,000 1,849 3,487 556 1,853 1,594 2,112 11,451 11\n9,001-18,000 1,090 2,092 300 1,411 1,175 1,434 7,502 7\n<9,000 980 1,141 177 1,011 689 1,434 5,432 6\nTotal households 13,800 31,697 4,920 21,058 13,509 15,759 100,744 100\nTarget beneficiaries 78 74 73 73 78 78 76\nas percentage of \ntotal households\nTable A10.2: Households, by Occupational Category (%)\nCategory of Occupation Puttalam Gampaha Colombo Kalutara Galle Hambantota\nFishery and fishery-related 16 44 - - 48 12\nTrading/Nonfishery - 5 5 6 5 8\nAgriculture 12 1 9 4 - 26\nTourism - - - - 1 -\nEmployment (Government/Private Sector) 30 15 34 40 10 40\nSelf-employment 16 - - - 2 14\nForeign employment 10 - 5 - - -\nOthers (unskilled labor, skilled labor, etc.) 16 35 47 50 34 -\nTotal 100 100 100 100 100 100\nC. Basic Infrastructure and Social Services\n4. The project area has a well-developed network of roads, which facilitates access to the\nmarkets. A main highway runs along the coast from north to south and serves as the main link\namong the districts. A railway from Colombo to Matara, runs parallel to the road along the coast.\nWhile there are internal feeder roads, most of the fishing industry use the main road. The coast\nprovides a source of livelihood to the majority of the coastal population, other sources of employment\nbeing agriculture and manufacturing in the more industrialized areas. The tourism sector, which is\nlargely built around the splendid beaches and marine sanctuaries, is crucially linked to the coastal\nenvironment. As a result, demands from the fishing industry and the tourist trade compete for the\nexisting infrastructure. The available infrastructure for the fisherfolk is rudimentary. The ongoing\nFisheries Sector Development Project funded by the Bank is the only project providing support for\nthe rehabilitation of old and establishment of new landing and infrastructure facilities. Still, ice and\nother support services like repair of boats are difficult to access. As a result, the main demand of the\npopulation is for more infrastructure facilities in the project area.", "Appendix 10, page 3\n5. Housing exists for the fishing communities, but the quality varies widely throughout the\nproject area, with permanent houses only for the more affluent fishing families. In many areas the\nfishing community live in shanties and have little or no essential services like water and sanitation.\nThe communities that depend on the lagoons and wetlands encroach on the lagoons and are a\ncause of water pollution and destruction of the mangroves. While there is adequate availability of\nbasic services like health and education (as evidenced by the high literacy rates) in the project area,\nthere is a demand for additional sanitary facilities and safe drinking water facilities. There is no\napparent shortage of food or malnutrition. In fact, many of the households enjoy luxury items like\nrefrigerators and television sets. Table A10.3 gives details on infrastructure and other services in the\ndifferent districts.\nTable A10.3: Availability of Infrastructure and Other Services\nInfrastructure and Facilities Degree of Availability by District (%)\nPuttalam Gampaha Colombo Kalutara Galle Hambantota\nHealth Center 86 84 95 63 92 72\nHospital 90 93 97 59 97 64\nSchool 98 95 94 91 97 85\nCommunity Center 63 53 74 32 30 36\nSports Center 40 51 68 30 34 33\nPiped Water 44 75 78 48 74 56\nElectricity 88 84 92 74 85 82\nCommunity Facility 62 57 69 55 65 63\nRoads 91 87 94 84 96 92\n6. Credit is provided by a variety of agencies: commercial  banks, credit  cooperatives, NGO\ninstitutions, etc.  Different types of credit programs have been launched by the Government to\nencourage a process of economic development and to create employment opportunities. Response\nto  credit  for  small  and  medium-scale  enterprises  has  been  very  encouraging.  Credit  for\nmicroenterprise and self-employment has also been extended by rural banks, credit cooperatives,\nand the NGOs. These institutions have largely served the fishing community as general experience\nshows that the poorer fishing communities do not find it easy to access credit from commercial\nbanks because of procedures and the need for collateral. Agencies such as SANASA and Sarvodaya\nEconomic Enterprises Development Services have been successful in delivering microcredit and\nsmall loans to this group.  Repayment is, on the whole, reportedly satisfactory.\nD. Livelihood Activities\n7. Unemployment in the project area cannot be said to be widespread even though many\nfamilies received State aid. Partial employment is the main reason for the low income levels. The\nRSA found that many fishing families enjoyed income only from the men\u2019s work. The women\ncontributed little to the family income. Seasonal factors affecting the fishing industry, and lack of\nsuitable alternative livelihood activities are a major cause of poverty in the coastal areas. As a result,\nthe population resorts to destructive extraction methods, which deplete resources. Depending on\nwhether the district is near Colombo or not, there is potential for industrial employment (in garments\nfactories etc), which many prefer but only a few can get. The Social Development Division of the\nMinistry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development (MFARD) conducts training programs for\nwomen and assists them to find employment or establish new businesses. MFARD has several\nprograms to develop low-cost housing for fishing communities. A major portion of its capital budget\nfor 1999 is allocated for new housing development. Through the training and skills development", "Appendix 10, page 4\nprogram, the  Project  will  provide  training  to  fisherfolk,  particularly  women,  to  enhance  their\nemployment opportunities. The Project will target poor households and link training to meet the\nemployment demand in the different locations. \n8.  While the Government recognizes that alternative livelihood activities must be encouraged\nto relieve the pressure on the coastal resources, there is limited potential for this. Therefore two\ntypes of action are called for. First, there must be a way of educating the population about the need\nfor conservation and the benefits to be derived from reducing postharvest losses through adoption\nof better fish-handling methods. Second, there is a need for concerted efforts to identify activities\nto supplement family income, especially since a majority of the poorer families depend on fishing\nincome  and  even  the  relatively  higher  income  families  receive  supplemental  income  from\nremittances from abroad. Skills development through training and adequate marketing facilities in\naddition to credit are essential prerequisites for such efforts to succeed. \nE. Beneficiary Involvement and Voluntary Organizations\n9. A number of CBOs and NGOs are operating in the project area. They can be broadly\nclassified  as  welfare  organizations,  credit  societies,  lagoon  fisher  societies,  and  community\ndevelopment institutions. Many are local organizations and some are branches of national-level\ninstitutions. Interestingly, many provide extension-type support alongside government agencies.\nGenerally the institutions seem to work in close cooperation with government agencies and externally\nfunded projects. The NGOs seem to have broad-based membership, but not all members appear\nto be actively involved in day-to-day matters. There seem to be an awareness of the usefulness of\nCBOs and willingness to participate in development programs through such bodies. But financial\nsupport is still expected from the government. Lagoon fisher societies expressed a willingness to\nmanage lagoons if the government assisted with canal clearance, dredging, and zoning.\n10. The RSA found a readiness on the part of the fishing community to share in the costs of\nestablishing landing facilities. The Government, based on the recommendations of a Bank-financed\nTA grant, has introduced user fees in some of the fishing harbors and expects to introduce this\nnationwide  in  due  time.  The  fishing  community  seems  willing  to  pay  for  the  operation  and\nmaintenance (O&M) costs of maintaining these facilities, in view of the obvious advantages they\nbring. The management of one of the fishing harbors in Beruwela is also being undertaken by the\nstakeholders through the formation of an advisory committee, and a model may evolve for adoption\nin other ports and harbors. \n11. The RSA  concluded that  there is minimal interest generally in the issues of conservation\nand even coastal erosion is not seen  as a major problem by those who are inland. One explanation\nfor this lack of interest in environmental degradation and resource depletion could be that the lack\nof basic amenities and services for the fishing industry is seen as a more immediate problem. At the\nsame time, the experience of the Government in special area management (SAM) planning has\nmixed results. In Rekawa, where the combined results of organizing the local community through the\nRekawa Foundation and the implementation of measures recommended by the SAM process have\nproduced visible results, there is a commitment to the need for better resource management among\nthe beneficiary population. As the  population has already suffered due to environmental degradation,\nthere is greater ownership of regeneration efforts. The conclusion, from the RSA and FGDs and the\nstakeholder workshops, is for the Government to pursue the SAM process vigorously and undertake\nsteps to organize and involve the local beneficiaries in the process to ensure long-term sustainability.\n12. Several  agencies  are  already  working  in  the  project  areas.  There  are  international\norganizations such as the World Conservation Union and some other agencies specializing in\nenvironment protection activities. In addition, several local institutions involved in community", "Appendix 10, page 5\ndevelopment activities command the confidence of the local population and have established\nthemselves on a sustainable basis. These agencies have  expressed  keen  interest  in  being\nassociated with project implementation activities. \nF. Gender Issues\n13. Women in the coastal areas are engaged in a variety of tasks, the primary ones being\nhousekeeping and child rearing, which they have to perform before they could engage in other\nactivities. While men are generally involved in economic activities, women spend much time carrying\nout domestic chores, implying a delineation of responsibilities within the household. Men are typically\nexpected to be the main breadwinner (engaging  in fishing, processing, and trading activities) while\nthe women attend to domestic duties/activities and in limited income-augmenting activities such as\nfish drying, vending, and some agriculture-related activities.\n14. Women have recently become actively involved in the establishment of women\u2019s groups\nconcerned with community affairs and welfare and, thus, have the potential to become a significant\nsocial force in the community. There is increasing need for women to contribute to household\nincome; however, they lack the required skills. Women in the coastal communities show a high level\nof awareness of shared problems, which indicates a willingness to cooperate and work toward\ncommon development goals. In some areas, women\u2019s groups have been purposely organized by\nNGOs for credit assistance, development of income-generating activities, skills training, and\nprovision of social infrastructure.", "Appendix 11, page 1\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS\nA. Basic Approach and Framework\n1. The Project is intended to address the problem of severe coastal erosion along the west\ncoast of Sri Lanka as well as introduce sustainable coastal resource management into the area.\nIn addition to the economic analysis of the Project as a whole, this appendix focuses on the\nviability of investments in the various project components, namely: (i) coastline stabilization, (ii)\ncoastal environment and resources management, and (iii) fisheries management and harbor\nconstruction/rehabilitation.  The  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  following  the  Bank\u2019s\nGuidelines for Economic Analysis for Projects.\n2. All costs and benefits were broken down into their traded, nontraded, labor, and tax\nfactors and converted to world price values. Traded goods were expressed in economic terms\nusing an exchange rate of SLRs70.81 against the US dollar (as of the summer of 1999).  Non-\ntraded goods and services were converted to economic values using a standard conversion\nfactor (SCF) of 0.9.  Labor costs were also expressed in economic terms using a shadow wage\nrate of 0.8 and SCF of 0.9.1  Project implementation is planned for a period of five years and the\nlife of the Project is assumed to be 20 years including the time of implementation.\nB.  Economic Analysis2\n1. Coastline Stabilization\na. Costs\n3. Coastline  stabilization efforts  are  to be  carried  out  in  seven  segments  (totaling  52\nkilometers) on the southwestern coast of Sri Lanka.  The works will include a substantial\nelement of sand nourishment, some dredging, and the construction of a variety of physical\nstructures such as breakwaters, groins and revetments.  A breakdown of these costs is shown\nin Table A11.1. In addition, maintenance costs will be incurred throughout the life of the Project\nonce the physical interventions have been completed.\nTable A11.1:  Civil Works for each Project Site\n($ million)\nBeach\nNourishment Physical\nProject Sites and Dredging Structures Overhead Total\nMaha Oya 9.83 2.49 0.88 13.20\nColombo North 0.41 2.73 0.43 3.57\nMoratuwa 0.28 0.03 0.31\nWadduwa 0.77 0.07 0.84\nKalu Ganga 2.27 2.88 0.59 5.74\nBeruwela 0.91 2.44 0.34 3.69\nHikkaduwa 1.64 1.38 0.26 3.28\n       Total 15.83 12.20 2.60 30.63\n                                           \n1\nInvestment costs both with and without the Project were similarly converted into economic values.\n2\nAdditional details of the economic analysis can be found in Supplemental Appendix A.", "Appendix 11, page 2\n4. The level of coastal erosion and degradation in the project area is severe.  Even without\nthe Project, the Government and the private sector will incur substantial costs in attempts to\nprotect particular locations. The Government gives high priority to facilities such as schools,\nroads, railways, telecommunication facilities, religious places, and historical sites, while private\nproperty owners will try to preserve homes, hotels, and industrial premises.  Without the Project,\nthe methods of emergency protection are likely to continue to be the unconnected use of\nrevetments, dredging, etc.  Such methods are expected to merely move the problem to adjacent\nparts of the coast and merely delay the damage to the site.  Interventions planned for the\nProject, on the other hand, are intended to stabilize the entire length of coast without shifting the\nproblem elsewhere.  One benefit (or cost decrease) of the Project, then, is the elimination of the\nmore haphazard methods of various site protections that would take place without the Project.\n5. Based  on  past  investment  efforts  by  both  the  public  and  the  private  sectors  and\ndepending on the extent of the erosion, certain levels of combined without-Project investment of\nboth public  and  private  sectors  are  assumed  at  each  site.  Since  the  erosion  situation  is\nparticularly serious in Maha Oya-Lansigama, it is expected that the without-Project investment\nat this site would double in the second year (of what would have been the project cycle) and\nincrease at 15 percent annually until the 10th year.  For the other six sites, the total capital\ninvestment is assumed to increase at 50 percent initially, about 33 percent in the third year and\n10 percent per year thereafter.\nb. Benefits\n6. Direct benefits of the coastal stabilization subcomponent are assumed to be derived\nfrom  land  that  would  be  saved  by  the  intervention  (but  not  saved  in  the  without-Project\nscenario).  These  benefits  include  (i)  houses  and  buildings  on  the  land  to  be  saved;\n(ii) avoidance of removal and administration costs, which would have been incurred if the land\nhad eroded; (iii) avoidance of the interruption of people\u2019s work that would have been caused by\nthe erosion; and (iv) the opportunity cost of the land.\n7. Estimates were made of the amount of land expected to be saved each year by the\nProject and of the value of buildings (per unit of that land) at each of the seven sites. The\nremoval and administration costs were estimated at 15 percent of the economic value of the\nbuildings. It was assumed that people who would have been affected by the projected erosion\nthrough the loss of their home or other building would lose three months or work and income if\nthe erosion were to take place. On agricultural land, the Project would prevent the loss of net\nincome from coconut trees and rice paddy.  Beach erosion causes the destruction of coconut\ntrees and a rise in salinity damaging to rice cultivation along a coastal belt.  Net economic\nbenefits from coconut cultivation have been calculated at SLRs27,972 per hectare and those\nfrom paddy at SLRs42,161 per hectare.\n8. While not specific to any site, the overall coastal stabilization subcomponent is expected\nto have significant impacts on the tourism industry, the second largest foreign exchange earner\nin Sri Lanka.  Without the Project, erosion will not be effectively prevented and the beaches will\nbe increasingly covered with revetments.  As beaches are perhaps one of the most prominent\nfeatures of the country\u2019s tourist industry, a major quality decrease in the coastal area is likely to\nreduce the number of tourist arrivals as well as reduce per tourist spending in the country as\nhigh-income travelers choose other vacation destinations.  A conservative estimate is that both\ntourist arrivals and per tourist spending would decrease by 1 percent if the beaches were to\ndeteriorate as expected without the Project.  Forecasts indicate that in 2005, tourist arrivals are\nexpected to be between 410,000 and 450,000 and per tourist spending between $630 and $650", "Appendix 11, page 3\n(in constant prices). If so, the potential loss prevented by the Project is about $5.1 million per\nyear.\nc. Economic Internal Rate of Return\n9. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the coastal stabilization subcomponent is\n17.2 percent.  Without the tourism benefits, the EIRR would be only about 5 percent.\n2. Coastal Environment and Resource Management (CERM)\n10. The CERM subcomponent is designed to address the unsustainable and conflicting uses\nof  coastal  and  marine  resources  in  eight  selected  sites  along  the  southwest  coast.  The\ninvestment activities involve mainly the planning and implementation of strategies to maintain\ncoastal  and  marine  resources  use  at  present  levels  and  avert  further  degradation  and\nunsustainable use of the resources.\na. Costs\n11. Investment costs for the CERM sites are in Table A11.2.\nTable A11.2:  CERM Investment Cost for Each Project Site\nInvestment Cost\nProject Sites ($ million)a\nNegombo Lagoon                 1.81\nLunawa Lagoon                 1.63\nMadu Ganga Estuary and Lagoon                 0.31\nUnawatuna Bay                 0.16\nKalametiyab                 0.93\nBar Reef                 0.19\nHikkaduwa                 0.14\nMawella                 0.46\n      Total                 5.63\na   Does not include investments at the national level.\nb\n   This site actually includes two locations, Tangalle and Hambantota, which are\n                                  combined in this analysis due to their proximity and similarity to each other.\n12. The  incremental  benefits  of  CERM  investments  arise  from  the  difference  between\nresource use with the Project and the predicted nonsustainable resource use that will continue\nto develop without the Project.  It is assumed that the nonsustainable use without the Project will\nlead to an incremental loss of 1 percent per year of the habitat/resource value. This assumed\nlevel of normal loss is well below the 2.5 percent to 3 percent rate of deforestation in Sri Lanka\nand about equal to the annual loss of coral cover in the Hikkaduwa area.3\n13. Only some of the CERM benefits can be reasonably quantified and valued for inclusion\nin  this  analysis.  Depending  on  the  site,  these  include  sustainable  utilization  of  mangrove\nvegetation-based products and fisheries products, sustainable recreation uses, and ecotourism\n                                           \n3\nWhite, A.T., V.

These include the protection of scarce turtle nesting habitats, and the benefits from\navoided health damage and some increased amenity and property values.\nb. Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR)\n14. The EIRRS for the CERM component are in Table A11.3. The results indicate that,\nexcept for the Mawella and Bar Reef sites, CERM investments are economically justifiable at all\nsites --- with EIRRs above 12 percent. In the case of Mawella, the most important benefit arising\nfrom managing the natural resources is the uniqueness of the area for turtle nesting, which has\nnot been valued.  The Bar Reef area, with EIRR at 11 percent, is marginal. The EIRR for the\noverall  CERM  investment  is  21  percent,  suggesting  the  economic  viability  of  CERM\ninvestments. For all of the CERM sites (including Bar Reef and Mawella) only those aspects of\npossible benefits that are quantifiable were included in the EIRR calculations. Other biodiversity\nand environmental benefits that may occur but are not quantifiable were not calculated.\nTable A11.3:   Results of the CERM Economic Analysis\nEIRR\nSite\n(%)\n1.

This  project component  comprises  two  subcomponents:    (i)  harbor  and  anchorage\nestablishment, and (ii) programs for fisheries management and fish quality improvement.\na. Harbors and Anchorages\n16. Two  fishery  harbors  are  to  be  developed  in  Chilaw  and  Hambantota,  while  two\nanchorages will be constructed in Ambalangoda and Kalametiya. These facilities will provide\nservices to both boats with inboard engines (IBEs) and smaller boats with outboard engines\n(OBEs). The proportion of boats capable of multiday fishing trips is expected to increase due to\nthe Project, reducing the pressure on the fisheries close to the shore.\n17. Costs.  Construction will include the building of breakwaters, quays, and various shore\nfacilities at the various sites. Capital costs (excluding contingencies) in Chilaw, Hambantota,\nAmbalangoda, and Kalametiya were estimated at $1.24 million, $3.88 million, $3.35 million, and\n$3.09 million, respectively. All prices  are expressed in 1999 constant terms. All four subprojects\n                                           \n4\nInformation on resource values was obtained from a variety of sources.  For more information, see Supplemental\nAppendix A.", "Appendix 11, page 5\nwill be developed over a period of two to three years, beginning in year 2001. The foreign\nexchange component of the capital cost is assumed to be 45 percent.\n18. Staff costs for harbor masters, assistant harbor masters, clerical, security and labor staff\nhave been calculated for each facility. An overhead of $440/month has been estimated to cover\nutilities and other overheads.  Staff costs and overheads are assumed to be phased in over the\nfirst five years.  Maintenance costs that will be incurred in the regular maintenance of structures\nand equipment are assumed at 1 percent of the civil works cost and 3 percent of the cost of\ncapital goods. In addition, it is assumed that capital goods will be replaced every seven years.\nA sum of $11,000 will be invested in periodic dredging (every three years).\n19. Benefits.  In Chilaw, the harbor capacity for IBE boats is expected to rise from 243 to\n300\u2014but with a change in composition emphasizing multiday boats (rising from 133 to 250\nwhile one-day boats will decrease from 110 to 50). OBE boats are expected to stay the same.\nAt Hambantota, IBE boats are expected to rise from 11 to 150 (though some of these may\nsimply be transferred from a nearby area).  Ambalangoda anchorage has been designed to\naccommodate 55 IBE boats and 60 OBE boats, while Kalametiya will provide for anchorage\nspace for 60 IBE and 70 OBE boats.\n20. The number of fishing trips depends largely on weather conditions. Without suitable\nanchoring and berthing facilities, the operation of multiday boats is restricted to nine months of\nthe year, with an average of three to four trips per month.  Day boats make, on average, 12\ntrips/month during the monsoon period (six months) and 20 trips/month during the remainder of\nthe year, totaling about 192 trips/year. With harbor facilities, it is assumed that multiday boats\ncould operate for 10 months, averaging 30 trips/year.  The number of trips made by day boats\nduring the monsoon period is expected to increase to 15, increasing the total number of trips by\na boat to 210/year.\n21. The typical catch per trip by a multiday boat is assumed to be 1.5 tons (t), whereas the\ncatch by a day boat is assumed to be 0.2 t.  The catch per trip will remain unchanged with the\nProject.  These trip and catch statistics apply to all four harbors/anchorages.\n22. The Project will result in an increase in fish landings due to the larger number of boats,\nthe higher proportion of multiday boats, and the greater number of annual trips each boat will be\nable to make (on average). The economic value of incremental fish landings was calculated as\nthe  difference  between  the beach  value of  the  fish  and  the  corresponding  operation  and\nmaintenance  (O&M)  costs  of  boats  (including  the  crew  share).  The  beach  value  of  fish\napplicable to the economic analysis is the free on board price adjusted to the site (i.e., port gate\nprice) by deducting the cost of harbor fees, processing, transport, and handling, and was\nestimated at SLRs118.31/kg of fish.  By subtracting the economic value of the O&M cost of\nboats, the value added from the incremental fish landings is calculated at SLRs22.31/kg.\n23. EIRR.  A summary of the calculated EIRRs for the various harbors and anchorages is in\nTable  A11.4.  In the  costing of  the  harbors,  certain  figures  have  been  segregated  by  the\nindividual harbor. These costs have been used in the individual harbor EIRR calculations. There\nare additional overall  costs  of  this  subcomponent that  cannot  be easily  separated  by  the\nindividual harbor. These are costs supervision, survey and equipment and the international\nconsultants for implementation. These costs have been included in the EIRR calculation for the\noverall component as stated in para. 28.", "Appendix 11, page 6\nTable A11.4:  EIRR of Harbor and Anchorage Subprojects\nEIRR\nSite\n(%)\n1.  Chilaw 24\n2.  Hambantota 16\n3.  Ambalangoda 14\n4.  Kalametiya 12\nb. Fisheries Management and Fish Quality Improvement\n24. Costs.    The  cost  of  all  activities  under  this  subcomponent  was  estimated  to  be\n$845,000.  These expenditures will be spread over the five years of project implementation.\n25. Benefits. The fisheries management and fish quality improvement activities are expected\nto generate three broad benefits: (i) increase in the harvest of fish; (ii) reduction of losses during\nfish handling, transport, and marketing; and (iii) an incremental increase in the value of fish due\nto its improved quality. The increase in fish harvest is a result of the shift in effort from offshore\nfishing to deepsea fishing, and is not a result of an increase in the absolute fishing effort.\nReduction in losses and the consequent increase in value of landed fish will result primarily from\nfish quality improvement activities.\n26. The increase in fish yield due to the Project was determined after first projecting the\nnationwide annual fish landings up to year 2011 based on national-level statistics. Having\nconsidered the trend in fish landings over the past 25, 10, and 5 years, the latter period was\nselected to project trends through year 2011.  A key assumption in the analysis is that 0.1\npercent of national fish landings will be affected by project interventions. Since the project\ninterventions  target  many  locations  along  the  western  and  southwestern  coastal  belt,  the\nassumption  is considered conservative.\n27. EIRR.  The EIRR calculated according to the above assumptions yields a value of\n30 percent.\nc. Calculated Returns for the Full Component\n(Harbors plus Fisheries)\n28. The combined EIRR for the full fisheries management and fish quality improvement\ncomponent  (including  both  the  harbor  subcomponent  and  the  fisheries  subcomponent)  is\nestimated at 12.1 percent.\n4.  Economic Analysis of the Whole Project\n29. For  the Project  as  a  whole,  the  20-year  net benefit  streams  of  each  of  the  three\ncomponents were combined.  In addition, the costs of institutional strengthening and project\nadministration were included.  The resultant full-Project EIRR is calculated as 15.3 percent\n(Table A11.5).", "Appendix 11, page 7\n30. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for the overall Project as well as for the three\ncomponents. The results are in Table A11.6.\n31. For the Project as a whole, either an increase in costs or a decrease in benefits by 20\npercent reduces the EIRR to just over the acceptable level of 12 percent.  If both costs are\nraised and benefits are decreased (by 20 percent), the EIRR falls to a weak 9.7 percent. A two-\nyear delay in benefits (keeping costs constant) results in an EIRR of 11.5 percent. For the\ncoastline  stabilization  component,  only  a  simultaneous  20  percent  increase  in  cost  and\ndecrease in benefits results in an EIRR of 12.1 percent. The coastal environment and resource\nmanagement component results are robust under all of the sensitivity analysis scenarios. The\nharbors and fisheries management component, on the other hand, has an EIRR of well under\n12 percent in each of the four sensitivity scenarios. This component is the most susceptible to\npoor results if anything goes wrong.\nC.  Other Benefits\n32. The Project is expected to have numerous nonquantifiable benefits not included in the\nabove analysis. The principal such benefits are (i) institutional strengthening of MFARD and its\nkey  agencies  directly  involved  in  the  implementation  of  project-related  activities;  (ii)\nenhancement  of  interagency  linkages  through  cooperation  in  the  coordination  and\nimplementation  of  coastal  resource  management  plans  and  activities;  (iii)  improved  and\neffective  resource  management  and  protection;  (iv)  enhanced  beneficiary  participation  in\nresource management and project implementation; (v) establishment of strong partnerships\namong local government, the communities, and NGOs/CBOs in community-based resource\nmanagement; (vi) increased food supply, improved nutrition, and health; and (vii) improved\ncommunity welfare. Other nonquantifiable benefits include the retardation of coastal resource\ndepletion  and  degradation  through  effective  environmental  protection  and  resource\nmanagement as well as the promotion of beneficiary participation in community-based coastal\nresource management and in project implementation.", "Appendix 11, page 8\nTable A11.5: Total Project EIRR\n(SLRs million)\nBase Case\nYear Coast Stabilization CERM Harbors and Fisheries Institutional Project\nCosts Benefits Net Benefits Costs Benefits Net Benefits Costs Benefits Net Benefits Costs Net Benefits\n1 177.0                -            (177.0) 38.4          4 .9             (33.5) 49.2 0.0 (49.2) (37.0)            (296.8)\n2 226.8                1.0            (225.7) 89.9        1 1.4             (78.5) 130.4 0.0 (130.4) (96.3)            (530.9)\n3 871.8                4.9            (866.9) 197.6        1 8.2           (179.4) 292.4 0.0 (292.4) (83.3)         (1,422.0)\n4 422.0                8.7            (413.3) 111.7        2 6.9             (84.8) 307.2 95.6 (211.7) (51.7)            (761.4)\n5 260.5              1 1.4            (249.1) 70.4        3 5.6             (34.8) 224.8 112.6 (112.2) (18.9)            (415.0)\n6 (95.1)             372.9             468.0        8 2.5              82.5 4.8 136.0 131.2             681.7\n7 (147.0)             373.3             520.3        9 7.6              97.6 4.8 144.9 140.1             758.0\n8 (126.5)             373.8             500.3       110.0            110.0 7.6 146.0 138.4             748.7\n9 55.0            3 74.2             319.2       122.5            122.5 4.8 147.4 142.6             584.3\n10 (144.4)             374.6             519.0       134.9            134.9 4.8 149.2 144.4             798.3\n11 (125.7)             375.1             500.8       147.3            147.3 4.8 151.3 146.5             794.6\n12 (127.3)             375.5             502.8       159.8            159.8 7.6 153.8 146.2             808.8\n13 (210.2)             375.9             586.1       172.2            172.2 4.8 156.9 152.1             910.5\n14 (158.8)             376.4             535.2       184.7            184.7 4.8 156.9 152.1             872.0\n15 (10.5)             376.8             387.3       197.1            197.1 4.8 156.9 152.1             736.5\n16 (179.8)             377.2             557.0       209.5            209.5 7.6 156.9 149.3             915.9\n17 (197.3)             377.6             574.9       222.0            222.0 4.8 156.9 152.1             949.0\n18 (124.8)             378.1             502.8       234.4            234.4 4.8 156.9 152.1             889.4\n19 (147.8)             378.5             526.3       246.8            246.8 4.8 156.9 152.1             925.3\n20 (179.8)             875.8          1,055.6       259.3            259.3 7.6 156.9 149.3          1,464.2\nEIRR 17.2% 20.6% 12.1% 15.3%\nNotes:\n1.
