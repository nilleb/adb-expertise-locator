I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  India  for  the  Kolkata  Environmental  Improvement \nInvestment Program.1 \n \n2.  Kolkata is the largest city in the state of West Bengal and the seventh largest in India. It \nhas a population of 4.5 million and contributes at least 13% of West Bengal\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct. The city is and will remain the dominant commercial and financial hub in the state. \nAlthough its livability has improved, the quality of basic urban services remains below national \nstandards. The gap is particularly noticeable in water supply and sewerage services in regard to \ncoverage, continuity, and quality. This affects the city\u2019s ability to attract investment, facilitate \ntrade, and create jobs, as well as its productivity, its competitiveness, and, most importantly, its \nquality of life and welfare. Investment and policy gaps hinder how effectively and efficiently \ninstitutions deliver services, and how well the policy framework creates an enabling environment \nfor better service delivery and sustainability. These limitations have been manageable, but \nKolkata\u2019s expanding economy and deficient investment and maintenance over the years have \nmade narrowing the gaps more urgent. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC), created to \nadminister the city under the KMC Act in 1980, is responsible for delivering water and sewerage \nservices. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been working with KMC since 2000, but only \nregarding sewerage.2 The partnership has yielded good results. KMC has a strategy, sector \nroad map, policy framework, and investment plan to address gaps in operational efficiency, \ninstitutional  effectiveness,  policy,  and  sustainability. 3  The  investment  program  combines \nphysical and other investments. KMC wants ADB to continue its role as a key financing and \nadvisory partner. \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale  \n3.  Although water supply and sewerage service levels in Kolkata are above the national \naverage,  service  provision  is  not  uniform  across  the  city  and  is  increasingly  strained  by \neconomic expansion. As shown in Table 1, service is better in the city center than in the \nperiphery. This is both a problem and an opportunity. The problem derives from the number of \nvulnerable households that has grown rapidly in the subserviced periphery, while population has \ndeclined in the center. The opportunity arises from the KMC\u2019s ability to generate revenues from \na still-large population with higher income in the center, with which to fund investment in the \nperiphery. The city has worked hard to narrow service disparities. Efforts started with two loans \nprovided in 2000 and 2006 for the Kolkata Environmental Improvement Project (KEIP), which \nfinanced the renovation of 564 kilometers (km) of the sewer\u2013drain network and the rehabilitation \nof three sewage treatment plants, raising the percentage of the population with direct sewer \nconnection from 31% in 2001 to 43% in 2011 (footnote 2). The service coverage for water \nsupply is higher than for sewerage, but disparities between central and peripheral areas remain, \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2000.

Unless  addressed  rapidly,  these  disparities  will  widen  as \npopulation shifts from the center to the periphery.4 \n \nTable 1: Water Supply and Sewerage Service Delivery in Kolkata \nWater  Liters of  Hoursof  Direct Sewer \nSupply  Water  Water  Nonrevenue  Metered water  Connection \nCoverage  Supply per  Supply per  Water   connections  Coverage \nItem  (%)  Capita  Day  (%)  (%)  (%) \nNational targets  100a  135b\u2013150c  24b  20  100b  70a\u2013100b \nNational average  81  123  4  \u2026  25  28 \nAll KMC area  92  134  8  \u2026  0.1  43 \nCentral area  100  140  9  \u2026  \u2026  56 \nPeripheral areas  73  118  6  \u2026  \u2026  19 \n\u2026 = data not available, KMC = Kolkata Municipal Corporation. \nNote: The center has 69% of the population and the periphery 31%. \na  As per the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2007\u20132012, also applicable under the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2012\u20132017. \nb  Ministry of Urban Development. 2010.

Gaps in service delivery are caused mainly by sub-optimal infrastructure operation and \ninadequate investment and maintenance.5 \n(i)  Operational  inefficiency  in  water  supply.  Operational  and  management \napproaches are outdated, especially for actively detecting leakage and effecting \nrepairs along the 5,700 km distribution network. High water losses, at 300 million \nliters per day, undermine income. An ADB study in 2012 showed that 63 million \nliters per day, or 65% of the water supplied to a pilot zone, never reached end \nusers (footnote 3). A new water treatment plant is planned for 2017 to address \nsupply shortage in the periphery. The four water treatment plants now operating \nhave  sufficient  design  capacity  to  supply  water  to  meet  national  targets.6 \nHowever, for this to happen, the KMC has to cut water losses through better \nmanagement. About 15% of its electromechanical equipment is 30\u201390 years old, \nrequiring 15% more energy than  modern equipment. Operational inefficiency \nmeans high service cost, forgone income, and narrow operating margins. \n(ii)  Low  investment  in  sewerage.  The  KMC  aims  to  provide  direct  sewer \nconnection to 95% of households over the long term with phased investments in \nat least five additional sewage treatment plants, 17 pumping stations, and 1,300 \nkm  of  sewer\u2013drain  network.  However,  investment  need  greatly  exceeds  the \nKMC\u2019s financial capacity. Timely achievement requires accelerated investment. \n(iii)  Inadequate  revenue.  The  KMC  has  a  dedicated  account  for  water  supply, \nsewerage, and drainage. In FY2009, the account revenue reached $33 million \n                                                 \n4  Studies have predicted that inadequate sewerage coverage might result in substantial losses by 2050 from flooding \ncaused by climate change (World Bank.  2010. Climate Risks and Adaptation in Asian Coastal Megacities. \nWashington, DC; World Bank. 2011. India - Vulnerability of Kolkata metropolitan area to increased precipitation in a \nchanging climate. Washington D.C.). Kolkata\u2019s vulnerability arises from natural (topography), developmental \n(unplanned and unregulated urbanization) and climate change factors (rainfall intensity and sea level rise). \nTangible risks from increased floods include (i) loss of income and personal assets; (ii) damages to buildings, \nindustry and commerce; (iii) damage to infrastructure and losses by the public sector; and (iv) health and loss of \nlife. The studies recommended a combination of adaptation measures comprising hard and soft infrastructure. The \ninvestment program addresses some of recommended adaptation measures by critically increasing resilience of \nwater systems and expanding the coverage and capacity of combined sewerage and drainage networks.   \n5  Sector Assessment (Summary): Water Supply and Other Municipal Infrastructure and Services (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  Design capacity is 1,787 million liters per day, but current operational capacity is only 1,260 million liters per day. \n ", "3 \nbut still fell short of operating cost. A state government subsidy of $24 million \nhelped to make ends meet.7 However, rising user charges and property taxes \nhave  been  the  biggest  contributors  to  revenue.8 Accordingly,  an  operating \nsurplus of $13 million was recorded in that fiscal year. This surplus and savings \nfrom  the  KMC\u2019s  main  account  helped  fund  $27  million  in  critical  capital \ninvestments over the period but was insufficient to replace and modernize water \nsupply and sewerage facilities. \n \n5.  KEIP  performance.  The  KMC  has  the  capacity  to  manage  large  infrastructure \ninvestments and ensure adequate fiduciary oversight. Although the KEIP (footnote 2) suffered \nstart-up delays, the KMC remarkably advanced progress from 2006, with more than $30 million \na year in disbursement from 2007 to 2012 reflecting its capacity and commitment.9 KEIP was \nphysically closed on 30 June 2013, after disbursing more than 90% of the cumulative value of \nthe loans.10  \n \n6.  KMC  has  also  proved  its  capacity  to  implement  complex  projects.  The  KEIP  was \nclassified category B sensitive for environment and category A for involuntary resettlement.11 \nThe KMC ably managed the process, conducting environmental assessments prior to the start \nof any works and incorporating environmental and resettlement mitigation measures in bidding \ndocuments.  About  2,900  families  had  been  resettled  by  mid-2012  in  accordance  with  the \nresettlement plan. \n \n7.  Past ADB loans to the KMC targeted sewerage service but also required the KMC to \nintroduce some reforms to water supply. Few covenanted reforms that could not be met in full \nwere the introduction of domestic water meters and water tariffs.12 As part of a phased approach, \nthe KMC took steps to gradually roll out domestic metering with the initial installation of about \n260 water meters for bulk users and in January 2012, the delivery of another 150 bulk water \nmeters. This will help monitor and reduce water losses in the trunk mains and increase water \navailability and continuous flow of water to end users, which domestic water meters need to \nfunction properly. Domestic water meters will be systematically installed in priority KMC areas \nas part of the new investment program. After surveying willingness to pay and affordability, the \nKMC  has  introduced  volumetric  water  tariffs  and  sewer  surcharges  for  bulk  domestic, \ninstitutional, commercial, and industrial users. It has drawn up a blueprint for introducing broad \nuser  charges  toward  full  cost  recovery,  and  in  2011,  the  KMC  adopted  a  new  policy  on \noperational sustainability that stipulates the KMC gradually adopting meters for domestic users \nand a tariff from FY2014. \n \n8.  Road map, investment program, and lending modality. The KMC has defined a road \n                                                 \n7  The subsidy paid the salaries of staff deputed from the state government to the KMC. \n8  The KMC levies user charges on institutional, commercial, and industrial connections but not on domestic \nconnections. Instead, in the past it has aimed to recover operating cost through the property tax, in accordance \nwith the KMC Act. \n9  The details of the lessons from the experience and how they were incorporated in the design of the investment \nprogram, as well as detailed capacity assessment, are in appendixes 1 and 2 of the Facility Administration Manual \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 Details are in the Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 The KEIP was categorized B sensitive in 2006 to reflect  additional flow of sewage into the East Kolkata Wetland. \nThis decision was taken following detailed nutrient absorption capacity studies. The wetland was listed in 2002 \nunder the Ramsar Convention of 1971, recognizing it as a \u201cwetland of international importance\u201d for its approach to \ntreating Kolkata\u2019s sewage, efficiently recovering nutrients from the sewage for fish farming and agriculture.  \n12  Regarding revised user charges for domestic connections, the KMC could not demonstrate immediate need, as it \nwas able to meet operating cost from user charges, property taxes, and state government subsidies. \n ", "4 \nmap for water supply and sewerage in the Kolkata Urban Sector Investment Plan, 2012\u20132022.13 \nPhysical investment amounts to $4 billion, and other investment in reform, management and \noperational improvement, and on-the-job training comes to $20 million. The concomitant policy \nframework  aims  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for  better  operation  and  management \nefficiency and revenue mobilization. The Government of India, the state government of West \nBengal, and the KMC have asked ADB to finance part of the investment plan, of which the \nKolkata Environmental Improvement Investment Program is a portion, through an MFF. The \nMFF  is  justified  because  (i)  the  KMC  has  a  clear  strategy  and  road  map  that  combine \ninvestments and reforms, (ii) the investments are significant but sequenced, and (iii) the MFF is \nbetter suited to help the city than a stand-alone project as it allows the KMC to apply a phased \nprogrammatic  approach  with  a  well-defined  financial  envelope.  Assessments  have  been \nconducted upfront on policy, institution, management, and safeguards aspects.  \n \n9.  Ongoing external assistance in the Kolkata urban sector. The Government of the \nUnited Kingdom, through the Department for International Development, extended a \u00a328 million \ngrant to the KMC for capacity building in 2002. The focus was on organizational development, \ne-governance, property tax reform, accounting reform, revenue mobilization from public\u2013private \npartnership, citizen services, and social sector development. Most outputs had been delivered \nby 2011, improving KMC\u2019s governance. The investment program will expand assistance to \nimprove governance, focusing on financial management in water supply and sewerage services. \n \n10.  Strategic context. India\u2019s draft country partnership strategy, 2013\u2013201714 and country \noperations  business  plan,  2013\u2013201515 emphasize  (i)  support  for  prioritized  investments \ncovering critical economic and social urban infrastructure development and (ii) piloting new \napproaches to sustainable urban development. ADB\u2019s assistance program aligns with India\u2019s \nTwelfth Five-Year Plan, 2012\u20132017,16 which focuses on strengthening the five enablers for \nurbanization  (governance,  planning,  financing,  capacity  building,  and  innovation)  and \nemphasizes regional planning, environmental sustainability, and inclusive growth.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the proposed investment program will be improved access to water supply \nand sanitation in KMC. The outcome will be improved water supply, sewerage and drainage \nservice quality and operational sustainability in selected areas of KMC.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The investment program aligns with ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020,17 and \ncomprises the following outputs:  \n(i)    Inefficient  water  supply  assets  rehabilitated.  This  output  aims  to  reduce \noperational inefficiencies and progressively achieve 24-hour continuous water supply \nfrom one hydraulically discrete area to another. This output will restore KMC\u2019s water \nproduction capacity to 1,478 million liters per day and rehabilitate 700 km of network. \n(ii)   Sewerage  extension  to  peripheral  areas  continued.  This  output  will  reduce \ngeographical disparities and improve run-off in the KMC\u2019s peripheral area. It will \n                                                 \n13 KMC. 2011.

This output will \nassist the KMC establish a utility finance improvement unit to formulate a long-term \nsubsidy  policy,  draft  water  user  charges  and  sewerage  surcharges  for  both \nvolumetric and other domestic connections. The aim is to ensure full cost recovery \nfrom these fees, gradually moving towards accumulation of retained surplus in a \ndedicated account.18   \n \n13.  The investment program targets 20% of the city while Tranche 1 will support 5% of the \nKMC area. Tranche 1 outputs include: \n(i)  Inefficient water supply assets rehabilitated. Tranche 1 will help the KMC \nrestore the original production capacity of two existing water treatment plants, \nreplace inefficient electromechanical equipment, augment transmission mains, \nand update the asset database for better monitoring and future planning. Water \nlosses in the distribution network will be cut and the service will achieve 24-hour \ncontinuous water supply in one pilot area. Tranche 1 will help the KMC set up a \nwater loss management unit in a pilot area. \n(ii)  Sewerage extension to peripheral areas continued. Tranche 1 will help the \nKMC narrow the geographical disparity in sewerage service and improve runoff \nin the southern periphery.19 It will install about 12 km of sewer pipes, pumping \nstations, and 2,300 direct sewer connections. \n(iii)  Financial and project management capacity further developed. Tranche 1 \nwill help the KMC establish the utility finance improvement unit, which will revise \nthe long-term cost-recovery and subsidy plan. Tranche 1 will help the project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  transition  into  an  autonomous  entity  capable  of \nimparting  institutional  knowledge  and  skills,  including  human  resource \nmanagement. \n \n14.  Tranches 2 and 3 will continue supporting the delivery of all outputs, phased in different \nparts  of  the  KMC  area.  They  will  support  the  downstream  expansion  of  the  water  loss \nmanagement system in the water supply network. Reduced water loss will allow the KMC to \npostpone major capital investments in new water production. To ensure continuity, the water \nloss  management  unit  staff  will  acquire  water  loss  management  skills  on  the  job.  These \ntranches will continue supporting the installation of sewer pipes and direct connections in the \neastern  and  western  peripheries  and  the  construction  of  new  sewage  treatment  plants.22 \nExpanding the areas with 24-hour water supply, reducing operational inefficiency, and raising \nsewer network coverage will give the KMC the necessary popular support to introduce user \ncharges for domestic connections.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n15.  The investment program is estimated to cost $570 million (Table 2).  \n \n                                                 \n18 The utility finance management unit will also revise the unit price of bulk water supply under existing supply \ncontracts between the KMC and adjacent municipalities to sell at prices exceeding production costs. \n19 The sewer and drain systems are combined. Improvements will alleviate waterlogging. Future increases in rainfall \nintensity will be addressed during the detailed design to strengthen urban resilience under climate change. \n22 Technology for reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be adopted to mitigate climate change impacts. \n ", "6 \nTable 2: Investment Program \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.

The state government and the KMC will \n                                                 \n23 Framework Financing Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Periodic Financing Request for Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \ncontribute $40 million. Tranche 2 is expected in 2016 in the amount of $150 million and tranche \n3 in 2018 in the amount of $150 million. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  September 2013 \u2013 August 2023 (facility) \nSeptember 2013 \u2013 December 2018 (tranche 1) \nEstimated completion date  31 August 2023 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Steering committee, KMC \n(ii)   Executing agency  KMC \n(iii)  Key implementing  PMU \nagencies \n(iv)  Implementation unit  The PMU for the KEIP will continue to implement the investment \nprogram. Its staff of 97 comprises existing subunits for contract \nmanagement (35 staff), project accounts (11 staff), social development \n(9 staff), and project coordination (23 staff), as well as 2 new subunits, \nfor water loss management (16 staff) and utility finance improvement (3 \nstaff) \nProcurement (Tranche 1)  ICB  5 contracts  $88.5 million \nNCB  1 contract  $7.4 million \nConsulting services (Tranche 1)  QCBS  13 person-months  $10.2 million in 4 contracts for \ninternational;  detailed design and supervision, \n1,074 person-months  project management, \nnational  communication and GIS \nRetroactive financing and/or  Eligible  expenditures  may  be  incurred  on  advance  contracting  for \nadvance contracting  consulting services and the procurement of goods, services, and civil \nworks, and for project management and administration, up to 12 months \nbefore the loan signing date, and not exceeding 20% of the relevant \nloan amount. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, GIS = geographic information systems, ICB = international competitive bidding, \nKEIP  =  Kolkata  Environmental  Improvement  Project,  KMC  =  Kolkata  Municipal  Corporation,  NCB  =  national \ncompetitive bidding, PMU = project management unit, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n19.  Specific  arrangements.  To  ensure  continuity  and  consistency,  consulting  service \ncontracts will be carried out by the same teams throughout the investment program from 2013 \nto 2023 subject to favorable performance review. The initial loan will cover consulting service \ncontracts for the first 5 years, and subsequent loans will cover the remaining period. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n20.  Extensive technical due diligence undertaken in partnership with the KMC has validated \nits investment plan and expected outputs. A key water loss management study for a pilot area in \nzone 1 has shown that reducing losses depends on intensive leak detection and repairs in \n ", "8 \ndiscrete areas. Under each tranche, a contractor will first hydraulically segregate the pipe \nnetwork in a pilot area, further breaking it up into district metered areas. In each district metered \narea, the contractor will install meters for all connections, supply water around the clock with \nproper pressure management, actively detect and repair leaks, and optimize the water pressure \nfor daytime and nighttime service. These and other measures will cut water losses to less than \n20%. To achieve these results, the KMC will engage a contractor through a performance-based \npayment contract.25 This approach means that (i) the work performance will be measured as an \nend result, such as amount of water loss reduction in the pilot area, and (ii) the contract will \nprovide  multiple  means  and  alternatives  for  achieving  intended  results.  This  approach  is \nrecognized internationally as a reliable way to reduce water losses. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  The  economic  rationale  for  government  intervention  is  strong,  as  the  investment \nprogram  supports  basic  public  services  that  are  a  natural  monopoly  and  require  the \nmanagement of externalities. The calculation of the economic internal rate of return is based on \nscenarios  with  and  without  the  investment  program,  incorporating  least-cost  design.  The \neconomic internal rate of return is estimated at 15.1% for water supply and 15.0% for sewerage, \nboth higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital. \n \n22.  The investment program will strengthen financial sustainability by avoiding unnecessary \noperating cost and exploring additional revenue sources. This will enable an operating surplus \nwith  which to  improve  water  supply  and  sewerage  operations.  The  calculation  of  financial \ninternal rates of return (FIRRs) is based on the revenues and expenditures accruing from all \nphysical and other investments. The FIRR is estimated at 8.3% for water supply and 0.3% for \nsewerage. When the water supply and sewerage components are combined, the FIRR is 4.4%, \nwhich exceeds the weighted average cost of capital, estimated at 2.3%.26 \n \nC.  Governance \n23.  The KMC will continue to use the PMU formed under the KEIP. It consists of five \nspecialized units with about 90 staff. The PMU has successfully procured and administered 122 \ncontracts in accordance with ADB guidelines. The highest contract value was $25 million. The \nKEIP\u2019s 5-year average annual disbursement was the second best in the current urban sector \nportfolio in India. The KMC established in 2006 anticorruption and governance measures, such \nas (i) public disclosure of the details of physical and financial progress and the results of all \ntenders on the project website, (ii) public audits of project works by field-level committees in \nevery borough, and (iii) computer-aided redress of public grievances with a requirement to \nrespond within 24 hours of receipt. A financial management assessment conducted for the \ninvestment program did not identify any significant concerns but recommended using an imprest \nsubaccount to accelerate disbursement.  \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the KMC. Specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the facility administration manual.27 \n                                                 \n25 ADB supported the KMC\u2019s preparation of a performance-based water loss management contract under the TA \nproject Preparing Kolkata Environmental Improvement Project II.  \n26 Each periodic financing request will reassess demand, least-cost designs, the economic internal rate of return, and \nthe FIRR, as specified in the subproject selection criteria of the FFA. \n27 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  The investment program will contribute to ongoing and future national and state poverty \nreduction programs by improving sewerage services for all households, poor and not. It will \nimprove water supply duration in slums and other neighborhoods in the pilot area, enabling all to \nshare the same quality of service.28 Tranche 1 activities are categorized as effective gender \nmainstreaming. A gender action plan was prepared, outlining activities to bring equitable access \nto water supply and sewerage services, particularly for vulnerable households, including those \nheaded by women. It includes concessional user charges and promotes the participation of \nwomen in project offices and among contractors and operators. Program works contracts will \nfollow core labor standards and require contractors to carry out HIV/AIDS awareness programs \nfor laborers. Contracts for international competitive bidding and the standard bidding documents \nfor national competitive bidding require contractors to adequately mitigate social impact in \ncompliance  with  loan  and  project  agreements  and  with  the  principles  of  the  International \nFederation  of  Consulting  Engineers,  doing  so  under  the  supervision  of  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies and monitored by ADB. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n26.  Safeguard frameworks, including an environmental assessment and review framework \nand a resettlement framework, were prepared for the investment program. As demonstrated \nunder  the  KEIP,  the  KMC  has  adequate  capacity  and  commitment  to  implement  them. \nConsistent with the safeguard frameworks, initial environmental examinations and resettlement \nplans were prepared for tranche 1 investments. Tranche 1 is categorized B for environment, B \nfor involuntary resettlement, and C for indigenous peoples. Most adverse environmental impacts \nare associated with construction and can be mitigated. Two initial environmental examinations \nwere  prepared,  including  environmental  management  plans,  in  line  with  the  environmental \nassessment and review framework. The acquisition of 350 square meters of land, affecting two \nlandowners, is required under tranche 1. Both owners were consulted and are willing to sell their \nland.  Two  resettlement  plans  were  prepared  to  address  minor  permanent  and  temporary \nimpacts associated with rehabilitation and the laying of pipes for water supply, sewerage, and \ndrainage, such as disrupted road accessibility and the loss of livelihoods for a few days during \nconstruction, following the resettlement framework. The investment program does not require an \nindigenous peoples planning framework as it is envisaged that all projects under all tranches will \nnot affect scheduled tribes living in Kolkata, and none of the proposed investments will affect \nland belonging to scheduled tribes. Consultations were held with stakeholders, and safeguard \ndocuments (environmental and involuntary resettlement frameworks and planning documents) \nhave  been  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website;  summaries  were  disclosed  in  local  languages  to \naffected people and other stakeholders. A communication strategy details consultations and \ndisclosure to be undertaken during implementation. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and presented in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.29  \n \n                                                 \n28 Sustained access to safe water and sanitation will contain waterborne and other diseases, improving public health. \nAn equally significant impact will be a reduction in the time women spend fetching water, disposing of waste, and \ncaring for the sick, thus freeing them for productive activities. \n29 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \n10-year population growth and water consumption  The projection is based on most recent data from \nsubstantially deviate from the projection.  the 2011 census, minimizing the extent of errors. \nRainfall  and  other  climate  variability  do  not  fall  The amount of rainfall is based on 10-year \nwithin projected range.  samples, so the specifications and design of the \nnetwork will reflect current trends. \nExperienced staff do not stay with the PMU.

The governments of India and West Bengal and the KMC have assured ADB that \nimplementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the facility administration manual and loan documents. \n \n29.  The governments of India and West Bengal and the KMC have given ADB certain \nundertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in the FFA. Specific covenants agreed by the \ngovernments of India and West Bengal and the KMC with respect to individual tranches under \nthe MFF are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement for the respective tranches. \n \n30.  The  KMC  will  comply  with  the  following  activities  before  ADB  considers  a  second \nperiodic financing request under the facility: (i) the completion of critical actions associated with \nthe  Roadmap  for  Self  Sustainable  Water  Supply  System  in  Kolkata,  2011,30 including  the \nfollowing: (a) periodic analysis of the flow from commissioning of each bulk flow meter, (b) \nincreasing the recovery of operation and maintenance charges for water supply and sewerage \nfrom the current 50% to 65% by March 2014; and gradually to 90% by October 2015; and (c) \nfinalizing the policy on subsidy and cost recovery by 31 July 2015; (ii) the KMC charging \nproperty tax based on the unit area assessment method starting 30 June 2014; and (iii) the \ntimely submission of audited financial statements.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n31.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount  not  exceeding  $400,000,000  to  India  for  the  Kolkata  Environmental  Improvement \nInvestment Program, from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the \nframework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n2 September 2013 \n                                                 \n30  Kolkata Municipal Council. 2011.
