In  support  of  stage  3  of  the  government\u2019s  four-\nstage  Public  Financial  Management  Reform  Program  (PFMRP,  [para  9  and  10]),  the  proposed \nprogram will finance actions and initiatives to strengthen (i) the policy and regulatory framework \nfor  expenditure  and  revenue  management,  (ii)  the  procedures  and  capacities  of  select  line \nministries to implement budgeting and expenditure management reforms, and (iii) the capacity \nof  the  external  audit  function.2 The  proposed  program  is  included  in  the  country  operations \nbusiness plan, 2016\u20132018 for Cambodia of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nDevelopment problem. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an average of over 6% \nannually between 2007 and 2015 (7% in 2015), with continuing strong revenue growth in 2015 \n(para.  4).  Continuous  economic growth  helped  reduce  the  poverty  rate from  47.8%  in 2007 to \n13.5%  in  2014.  However,  many  Cambodians  are  only  marginally  above  the  poverty  line  (41% \nlive on less than $2 a day and 72% on less than $3 a day).4 Low inclusiveness, largely because \nof weak public financial management (PFM) systems, contributes to this continuing vulnerability. \nLarge  gaps  remain  in  critical  public  services,  including  basic  and  technical  education;  health; \ninfrastructure  (roads,  irrigation,  water,  electricity,  and  sanitation);  and  extension  of  agriculture \nand fisheries. These gaps need to be addressed for growth to become more inclusive.5 A study \non Cambodia\u2019s poverty dynamics identified weak governance institutions (including weak PFM), \nand insufficient public services as key medium-term constraints to inclusive growth and poverty \nreduction.  The  study  pointed  out  weaknesses  in  the  allocation  of  public  resources,  as  well  as \ninadequate targeting of the poor and vulnerable groups.6 While important challenges were met \nunder  stages  1  and  2  of  the  PFMRP,  overcoming  further  weaknesses  in  PFM\u2014a  pillar  of \ngovernance to improve service delivery\u2014is a high government priority.7  \n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  Government of Cambodia. 2004.

Phnom Penh.  \n7 The government has three related public sector management reform programs in PFM, public administration, and \ndecentralization.  The  SPFMP  will  support  implementation  of  stage 3  of  the  PFMRP  with  links  to  decentralization \nreform. The Government of Germany supports public administration reform.     \n\n \n\n\fEvidence from Cambodia and other countries indicates that better PFM can create room \n4. \nin  the  government\u2019s  budget  to  provide,  and  improve  the  quality  of,  public  services.8 Domestic \nrevenue  collections  under  the  PFMRP  rose  by  4%  of  GDP  from  2013  to  2015  (with  nominal \ngrowth  of  14.2%  in  2015),  while  operational  efficiency  gains  also  provided  new  fiscal  space. \nHowever,  resource  allocation  is  not  yet  optimal:  current  expenditures  (8.9%  of  GDP  in  2009; \n13.9% in 2015) are growing much faster than capital expenditures (6.0% of GDP in 2004; 7.5% \nin 2015).9 Some expenditures have been redirected from low to high priority programs, but this \nhas  been  insufficient.  For  example,  agriculture  spending  rose  from  0.6%  of  GDP  in  2013  to \n0.9% in 2015, while education spending increased from 1.7% of GDP in 2013 to 2.1% in 2015.  \n \n5. \nBinding  constraints.  The  government\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  III,  which  sets  out \nmedium-term  policies  and  priorities,  identifies  governance,  including  PFM,  as  a  binding \nconstraint  to  improving  the  availability  and  quality  of  public  services.10 The  public  expenditure \nand financial accountability framework (para. 11) and other assessments, including diagnostics \nprepared for this program, identify three continuing weaknesses in the PFM system, which will \nbe  addressed  under  the  program  and  are  in  line  with  objectives  of  stage  3  of  the  PFMRP.11 \nOther  broader  constraints  include:  low  human  capacities  after  decades  of  conflict,  highly \ncentralized  public  service  delivery  arrangements;  and  inadequate  infrastructure.  These  are \nbeing addressed by other ADB interventions (para. 15).      \n \nNational  policies, regulatory  frameworks,  and  systems. The remaining weaknesses  \n6. \ninclude  (i)  the  absence  of  comprehensive  guidelines  for  budget  preparation,  execution,  and \ntransparent  financial  and  performance  reporting;  (ii)  limited  implementation  of  a  financial \nmanagement  information  system  (FMIS),  which  is  currently  confined  to  the  central  and \nprovincial departments of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF); (iii) limited development \nof  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework  (MTEF)  and  budgeting  to  guide  program  budget \npreparation  and  to  allocate  resources  effectively  between  central  and  subnational  levels;  (iv) \nweak  links  between  the  budget  and  development  polices;  (v)  an  incomplete  regulatory \nframework  to  allow  the  National  Assembly  to  approve  the  budget  law  by  programs;  (vi)  weak \ncapacity for revenue policy formulation and administration at central and subnational levels; (vii) \nunderdeveloped internal audit regulations, including limited guidelines and capacity for audits of \ninternal  control  systems  and  information  and  communication  technology;  and  (viii)  an  incomplete \nregulatory framework for public debt management, including for government guarantees.  \n \n7. \nWeak  capacities  of  line  ministries.  Ministries,  particularly  those  delivering key  public \nservices,  need  to  improve  budgets  and  expenditure  management.  Weaknesses  include  (i)  poor \nbudget  planning  and  preparation;  (ii)  incomplete  integration  of  current  and  capital  budgets;  (iii) \nlimited  inclusion  of  gender  and  poverty  in  plans  and  budgets;  (iv)  weaknesses  in  preparing  and \nreporting  on  program  budgets;  (v)  operational  challenges  of  newly  established  budget  entities; \nincomplete \n(vi) \n\nlow  budget  execution  capacities  and \n\nreporting  systems, \n\nincluding \n\n                                                \n8  For example V.

Weaknesses  include  limited  audit  capacities  of  the \n8. \nNational Audit Authority (NAA) particularly in meeting new demands for audit of line ministries in \nimplementing  program  budgeting  in  an  FMIS  environment,  and  in  having  to  expand  audit \ncoverage  to  include  subnational  administrations,  particularly  the  districts,  which  are  being \nempowered with more functions and resources.  \n \n9. \nReform  agenda. In 2005, the government initiated comprehensive reforms through the \nfour-stage  PFMRP.12 Stage  1  (2005\u20132008),  which  began  when  PFM  systems  were  seriously \ndeficient,  aimed  to  increase  budget  credibility  by  delivering  more  predictable  resources  to \nbudget managers, including eliminating chronic cash shortages and payment arrears. Credibility \nwas  substantially  achieved  by  2008  and  has  been  maintained  since  then  through  improved \nrevenue mobilization, public debt management, and cash and bank account management.      \n \n10. \nStage  2  (2009\u20132015)  aimed  for  more  effective  financial  accountability  by  improving \ninternal  controls  and  management  accountability.  Progress  included  (i)  budget  classifications \nand chart of accounts consistent with international standards; (ii) 3-year rolling budget strategic \nplans  (BSPs),  and  piloting  of  program  budgeting;  (iii)  early  work  to  unify  the  capital  and \nrecurrent  budgets;  (iv)  procurement  reform,  including  adoption  and  implementation  of  the \nProcurement Law (2012); (v) stronger internal controls and internal audit units in MEF and line \nministries;  (vi)  implementation  of  phase  1  of  the  FMIS  within  MEF  and  its  provincial \ndepartments; (vii) design and implementation of the medium-term revenue mobilization strategy, \n2014\u20132018;  and  (viii)  capacity  development.  Stage  3  (2016\u20132020),  which  seeks  to  improve \nbudget\u2013policy  links,  could  not  have  proceeded  without  the  foundation  provided  by  policy  and \ntechnical  reforms  and piloting  in stages 1 and 2.  Key  stage 3  activities  to be  supported  under \nthe  proposed  program  are  addressed  in  paras.  19\u201325.  Stage  4  (2021\u20132025)  aims  to  improve \nperformance accountability. \n \n11. \nPFM  performance  assessments  using  a  public  expenditure  and financial  accountability \nframework,  carried  out  in  2010  and  2015,  confirmed  gradual  progress  under  the  PFMRP \n(footnote 11). From 2010 to 2015, Cambodia recorded solid ratings in (i) budget credibility (from \nC+  to  B),  (ii)  policy-based  budgeting  (stable  at  B+),  and  (iii)  comprehensiveness  and \ntransparency of the budget (from C to C+). However, ratings were stable on (i) predictability and \ncontrols in budget execution (stable at C); (ii) accounting, recording, and reporting (stable at C); \nand  (iii)  external  scrutiny  and  audit  (not  rated  in  2015;  D+  in  2010).  The  2015  assessment \nrecorded an overall average rating of C to C+ in line with other low to middle-income countries. \nFor  example,  the  corresponding  overall  average  rating  for  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic was C (2010), Myanmar was D+ (2012), and Viet Nam was C+ (2013). Improving the \nratings to A and B categories will take time, which the program will pursue. \n \n12. \nADB\u2019s experience and lessons. ADB has supported PFM and decentralization reforms \nsince around 2001 (Figure 1). Earlier support to PFM focused on macroeconomic management, \nfiscal policy, financial management, and audit functions. From 2008 to 2015, support focused on \nstages  1  and  2  of  the  PFMRP  through  the  PFM  for  rural  development  program  cluster,  which \n\n                                                \n12  The  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Public  Sector  Management  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2) provides more on the PFMRP. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\ffocused  on  administrative, \n\nfiscal  and  PFM  arrangements \n\nprovided  policy-based  lending  and  several  TA  interventions.13 ADB\u2019s  support  to  decentralization \nreforms  has \nfor  subnational \nadministrations.  Important  lessons  include:  (i)  PFMRP  is  a  complex  long-term  program  that  has \nmade gradual progress from a very low base after decades of conflict, thus long-term commitment \nand  support  are  required;  (ii)  policy-based  loans  and  TA  interventions  allow  policy  and  regulatory \nshortfalls  at  the  central  level;  and  weak  systems  and  human  capacities  in  line  ministries,  to  be \naddressed  simultaneously;  (iii)  improved  coordination  within  MEF,  and  between  MEF  and  the \nline  ministries,  is  essential  for  successful  design  and  implementation  of  reforms;  (iv)  PFM \nreforms  at  the  central  level  should  be  closely  aligned  with  subnational  PFM  systems;  and  (v) \nwell-designed intergovernmental financing policies are needed to enhance decentralized service \ndelivery.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n13.      ADB\u2019s  value  added.  The  PFM  for  rural  development  program  cluster  (footnote  13) \nprovided experience in developing policies and a regulatory framework for financial accountability \nand in supporting selected line ministries (agriculture, rural development, and water resources and \nmeteorology)  and  the  NAA  to  implement  them.  The  post-program  partnership  framework  for  this \nprogram  cluster  enabled  broader  policy  dialogue,  leading  to  the  inclusion  of  four  policy  actions \n(FMIS  implementation,  expansion  of  internal  audit  units,  strengthening  debt  management,  and \nregulatory reform for external audit) under subprogram 1; and the development of program impacts, \noutcomes,  and  outputs.  As  the  multi-donor  trust  fund  managed  by  the  World  Bank,  which  has \nsupported  implementation  of  stages  1  and  2  of  the  PFMRP,  is  expected  to  end  in  2017,  the \ngovernment  has  requested  ADB  to  take  on  a  greater  role  in  supporting  stages  3  and  4  of  the \nPFMRP. ADB adds value by improving the design of reforms and supporting their implementation in \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2008.

The  programmatic  approach  with  a  policy-based  loan \n14. \nand  supporting  TA  interventions  as  used  in  the  previous  PFM  for  rural  development  program \ncluster (footnote 13) is proposed to continue for this program because it will further leverage the \nimplementation  of complex  medium-term  policy  reforms  of the government. The  approach  has \nproved  to  be  effective  in  supporting  the  government  to  implement  its  long-term  PFMRP.  The \nproposed  program  utilizes  two  subprograms  to  support  a  well  sequenced  package  of  policy \nreforms  over  the  period  2014\u20132019.  Subprogram  1  focused  on  completion  of  stage  2  and \nundertaking  advance  actions  for  stage  3,  while  subprogram  2  actions  will  support  full \nimplementation of stage 3 of the PFMRP. The sequenced approach will significantly improve the \npolicy and regulatory framework for expenditure and revenue management at central level while \ndeveloping  systems  and  capacities  of  line  ministries  to  implement  the  reform  agenda.  The \nregulatory  regime  and  capacities  of  the  external  audit  function  will  also  be  strengthened.  The \nmedium-term  directions  and  expected  results  framework  will  be  used  to  continue  ADB\u2019s \nengagement and to assess program effectiveness.   \n \n15. \nSynergies  with  other  ADB  interventions.  The  proposed  program  will  continue  to \nsupport  MEF,  the  NAA, and the three rural  development ministries  and will  expand support to \nthree  additional  priority  ministries:  education,  youth,  and  sports;  labor  and  vocational  training; \nand  public  works  and  transport.  The  proposed  program  will  be  much  broader  in  technical  and \nagency  coverage  than  the  previous  one  addressing  key  issues  of  linking  policy  and  budgets. \nThe  program  will  promote  synergies  through  improved  PFM  performance  with  ongoing  and \nfuture  ADB  interventions  within  the  six  targeted  ministries,  which  are  responsible  for  priority \nsectors in ADB\u2019s current country partnership strategy, 2014-2018.15 The proposed program will \nfurther  strengthen  synergies  with  the  ADB\u2019s  support  for  decentralization  with  the  former \ntargeting the central administration level and the latter targeting the subnational level, with both \nlevels interrelated. The proposed PFM program will support the decentralization program by (i) \nalignment  of  central  and  local  PFM  systems;  (ii)  reform  of  deconcentrated  activities  of  central \nministries  at  the  province  and  district  levels;  (iii)  reforms  to  the  intergovernmental  financing \nsystem, which will be addressed through proposed MTEF reforms; and (iv) support to the NAA \nto audit subnational administration finances.        \n \n16. \nCoordination  with  development  partners.  The  PFMRP  receives  well-coordinated \nsupport  from  development  partners  through  the  PFM  technical  working  group,  which  brings \ntogether  the  government  and  its  development  partners  to  discuss  progress  and  resolve  key \nreform  challenges.  The  proposed  program  will  coordinate  closely  with  development  partners \nincluding  the  European  Union,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency,  the  Government  of  Sweden,  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund \n(UNICEF),  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  and the World  Bank.  The \nmulti-donor trust fund has supported implementation of stages 1 and 2 of the PFMRP, including \nrevenue mobilization and the FMIS, but it is expected to end in July 2017 (para. 13). The European \nUnion  and  the  Government  of  Sweden,  previous  donors  to  the  multi-donor  trust  fund,  have \n\n                                                \n14 ADB. 2016.

The  three  outputs  of  the  program  combined  are \nexpected to lead to more responsible aggregate fiscal balances (lower deficits and public debt), \nbetter  resource  allocation  through  improved  prioritization,  and  greater  operational  efficiencies. \nPotential  economic  gains  are  to  be  achieved  through  resource  allocation  and  efficiency  gains \nby: (i) enhanced revenue mobilization; (ii) full implementation of the FMIS; (iii) introduction of a \ncomprehensive MTEF; and (iv) targeted systems and process oriented PFM reforms (para. 29).             \n  \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n18. \nThe  impact,  which  is  aligned  with  the  PFMRP,  will  be  effective  and  efficient  public \nservice delivery and inclusive growth. The outcome will be that the efficiency, effectiveness, and \naccountability of public expenditure and revenue management will be enhanced.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n19. \nThe  proposed  program  will  combine  support  for  further  development  of  the  policy  and \nregulatory framework led by MEF under stage 3 with the development of systems and capacities \nof  selected  line  ministries  to  extend  and  deepen  the  implementation  of  reforms,  along  with \nenhancing external audit capacities. Subprograms 1 and 2 are structured around three outputs \nthat  address  the  binding  development  constraints.  Subprogram  1  has  18  completed  policy \nactions implemented from 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2016. Subprogram 2, which contains 21 \npolicy  actions,  is  implemented  from  1  July  2016  to  30  June  2019.  Subprogram  1  includes  an \nSDR2,501,000 TA loan to support implementation of subprogram 2 reform actions.  \n \n\nOutput  1:  Policy  and  Regulatory  Framework  for  Expenditure  and  Revenue \nManagement Strengthened  \n\n \n1.  \n\n \n20. \nPolicy  and  regulatory  framework  for  budget\u2013policy  links.  This  sub-output  helped  the \ngovernment  improve  the  policy  base  of  the  national  budget.  Under  subprogram  1,  the \ngovernment  adopted  a  new  long-term  strategy  to  reform  the  budget  system  and  reaffirmed  its \ncommitment  to  shift  from  an  input-based  and  centralized  system  to  a  results-based  and \ndevolved system. The consolidated action plan of stage 3 was approved by the government in \nMarch 2016. Budget circulars were prepared to help line ministries draft 3-year rolling BSPs that \nlink  priority  programs  and  actions  with  budgetary  resources.  The  government  also  adopted  a \nmedium-term revenue mobilization strategy targeting an increase in revenue of 0.5 percentage \npoints  of  GDP  annually.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  Public  Finance  Management  Systems  Law \n(2008)  will  be  amended  to  institutionalize  PFM  reforms.  These  will  include  a  provision  for  the \nNational Assembly to pass the annual budget in a program budgeting format; development of a \ngovernment-wide  MTEF  for  2018\u20132020;  and  implementation  of  the  strategies  and  plans \nprepared under subprogram 1.      \n \n21.   Efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability of expenditure management. This sub-\noutput  supported  policy  actions  that  improved  expenditure  management  and  accountability. \nUnder subprogram 1, a new budget classification and chart of accounts were implemented with \nthe  budget  presentation in line  with international standards.  FMIS  was developed  and stage  1 \nimplementation  started  in  MEF  and  its  25  provincial  treasuries  to  automate  budget  execution, \n\n                                                \n16 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\faccounting, and financial reporting. Guidelines on policies and principles for internal controls for \nFMIS  were  adopted,  and  MEF  started  an  internal  audit  of  FMIS.  Under  subprogram  2, \ncomprehensive  financial  management  and  internal  audit  manuals  will  be  developed,  and \nimplementation of FMIS will progress and be rolled out to line ministries.       \n     \n22. \nSound  public  debt  management  system. This sub-output supported strengthening of \nthe public debt management system. Under subprogram 1, an updated public debt management \nstrategy  for  2015\u20132018  was  approved,  the  debt  recording  and  management  system  was \nupgraded  to  improve  portfolio  monitoring,  and  the  first  public  debt  statistical  bulletin  was \npublished  to  provide  trend  information  and  enhance  the  evidence  base  for  policy  makers. \nSubprogram  2  will  include  (i)  development  of  guidelines  on  government  guarantees,  including \nguarantees  on  public\u2013private  partnership  projects,  as  well  as  operating  procedures  for  public \ndebt management; (ii) a review of broader policy reforms, including the possible establishment \nof  a  domestic  market  in  public  debt  and  higher  quality  and  returns  from  debt-funded \ninvestments; and (iii) further strengthening of government\u2019s debt management capacity.               \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Capacity of Selected Line Ministries to Implement Budgeting and \nExpenditure Management Reforms Improved  \n\n \n23. \nCapability  of  line  ministries  in  budget  formulation  and  execution  strengthened. \nThis  sub-output  strengthened  the  capacities  of  selected  line  ministries  in  formulating  and \nimplementing  their  budgets.  Under  subprogram  1,  all  ministries  prepared  BSPs  for  2016\u20132018. \nBudget  entities  were  established  and  program  budgeting  increasingly  implemented  by  25  line \nministries  to  improve  links  between  budgetary  resources  and  program  goals,  and  to  better \nintegrate  recurrent  and  capital  budgets.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  BSPs  will  be  updated  with \npoverty  covered  annually  and  gender  issues  increasingly  included;  program  budgeting  will  be \nfully  implemented  in  selected  line  ministries;  and  financial  management  manuals  for  budget \npreparation, execution, and reporting will be prepared. \n \n24.   Public financial  management  system  at  selected  line  ministries  modernized. This \nsub-output  improved  expenditure  management  and  accountability  capacities  in  line  ministries. \nUnder subprogram 1, 10 pilot line ministries (including the six ministries to be supported under \nthe  proposed  program)  prepared  preliminary  annual  financial  reports  in  accordance  with  the \nplanned  shift  to  program  budgeting.  Internal  audit  units  were  established  in  all  government \nministries, providing a strong foundation for improving the integrity and quality of the whole PFM \nsystem.  Subprogram  2  will  support  six  line  ministries  in  (i)  preparing  annual  financial  and \nperformance reports in accordance with program budgeting; (ii) preparing FMIS implementation \nplans,  including  business  process  and  change-management  strategies;  and  (iii)  conducting \nperformance  and  information  and  communication  technology  audits.  The  implementation  of \nFMIS will pave the way for much-needed automation and modernization in line ministries.      \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Capacity of the External Audit Function Improved  \n\n             \n25. \nThis output further developed the external audit capacity of the NAA and reinforced the \nintegrity of the PFM system. Under subprogram 1, a regulation to implement the Audit Law was \napproved.  NAA\u2019s  annual  report  for  2015  was  also  approved.  The  annual  audit  reports  of  the \npublic finance  statements  were  submitted to  the National  Assembly  within  4 months  of  receipt \nfrom  MEF  for  both  FY2013  and  FY2014,  and  were  published  on  NAA\u2019s  website.  Under \nsubprogram  2, guidelines  on financial,  compliance,  and performance audits  will  be  updated;  a \nmanual  on  conducting  audits  of  subnational  administrations  (districts)  will  be  completed;  and \naudits  of  at  least  10  districts  will  be  conducted.  In  coordination  with  support  from  the \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs  \n\nthe  government  has  requested  a \n\nGovernment of Sweden, NAA\u2019s new strategic plan for 2017\u20132021 will be prepared and attention \nto the timely production of annual audit reports continued. \n \nD. \n \n26. \nCambodia\u2019s gross financing  needs remain  high.  In 2016,  with a budget  deficit target  of \n4.6% of GDP, the government will need to borrow about $820 million. The IMF analysis of debt \nsustainability  in  November  2015  found  Cambodia  at  low  risk  of  debt  distress.  To  support  its \nto \nreforms, \nSDR18,939,000 from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help finance  subprogram  1. The  loan \nwill  have  a  24-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  of  1% \nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in \nthe draft loan agreement. The loan will be withdrawn in a single tranche upon loan effectiveness \nand used to finance foreign exchange costs of economy-wide imports, excluding ineligible items \nand imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources, and in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time). The loan closing date is \n30 June 2017. A loan of $30 million has been programed for 2019 to finance subprogram 2. The \nloan size is based on the financing needs of the government, the strength of the policy reform \npackage, and its development impact. The government is committed to meeting the full costs of \nthe reforms, which are estimated at $114.7 million in 2013 prices (para. 29).  \n \nE. \n\nin  various  currencies  equivalent \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nloan \n\n27.  MEF  is  the  executing  agency  for  the  program.  The  General  Secretariat  of  the  PFM \nReform Steering Committee is responsible for overall coordination of program implementation.17 \nMEF\u2019s  Department  of  Information  Technology,  General  Department  of  Budget  (including  the \nDepartment of Cooperation and Debt Management), General Department of Internal Audit, and \nthe  PFM  reform  working  groups  in  the  selected  ministries  are  the  implementing  agencies  for \noutputs 1 and 2. The Secretary General of the PFM Reform Steering Committee is the program \ndirector  and  is  responsible  for  outputs  1  and  2.  As  an  independent  institution,  the  NAA  is  the \nimplementing  agency  for  output  3  and  will  sign  a  project  agreement  with  ADB.

Implementation and fund flow arrangements \nare in the project administration manual (PAM).18 \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN \n\nThe  government  has  requested  a  TA  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \n28. \nSDR2,501,000 from ADB's Special Funds resources to be implemented over 3 years to support \nthe  reforms  under  subprogram  2.19 MEF  is  the  executing  agency.  The  TA  loan  will  finance \nconsulting services, including applicable taxes and duties, bank charges, workshops, seminars, \ntraining,  and  project  management  support  expenses.  The  TA  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an annual interest rate of 1.0% during the grace period and \n1.5% thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft TA loan agreement. \nThe  TA  loan  will  be  implemented  from  1  February  2017  to  30  September  2019,  with  the \nexpected  closing  date  on  31  March  2020. The government  will  provide  in-kind  contributions  in \nthe  form  of  counterpart  staff  and  various facilities.  The  TA  loan  financing  plan  and  investment \nplan are summarized in part IV of the PAM. Goods will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \n\n                                                \n17 The PFM Reform Steering Committee is an interministerial body chaired by Minister of MEF.  \n18 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Attached Technical Assistance Loan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time), and consultants will be recruited \nin accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time \nto time). \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nImplementation of the proposed program between 2014 and 2019 is estimated to create \n29. \ncumulative net benefits of $1.18 billion (2013 constant prices) from 2014 to 2024. This is based \non  estimates  of  a  program  impact  assessment  of  cumulative  benefits  of  $1.29  billion  (2013 \nconstant prices). Benefits are estimated to come from the following agreed policy actions: (i) the \nrevenue  mobilization  strategy  ($739.5  million),  (ii)  movement  to  FMIS  commissioning  ($259.6 \nmillion),  (iii)  introduction  of  strategic  medium-term  budgeting  through  an  MTEF  ($77.1  million), \nand  (iv)  selected  strategic,  systems  and  process  oriented  reforms  ($213.7  million). \nImplementation of the proposed program reforms between 2014 and 2019 is estimated to cost \n$114.7  million  (2013  constant  prices),  mainly  for  implementing  the  FMIS,  line  ministries\u2019  self-\nfunded support for PFM reforms, and MEF budget support to line ministries. Given the medium-\nto  long-term  nature  of  benefit  flows  and  government  long-term  commitment  to  PFM  reforms, \nimplementation of the proposed program is assessed to be sustainable over the longer term. 20 \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n30. \n As PFM systems are being developed in procurement and anticorruption environments \nthat  are  still  fragile,  program  implementation  faces  fiduciary  risks.  However,  Cambodia  has \nsignificant  experience  with  budget  support  loans,  and  fiduciary  arrangements  have  been \ngradually improved to ensure that funds are used effectively and efficiently. Mitigating measures \nfocus  on  supporting  implementation  of  the  PFMRP,  as  reflected  in  the  proposed  policy  matrix \n(including  improvements  in  budgeting,  internal  controls,  internal  and  external  audit,  and  FMIS \nimplementation). These measures and the implementation of decentralization reforms supported \nby  ADB  under  a  separate  but  complementary  program,  including  clearer  assignments  of \nfunctions  and  strengthening  of  PFM  systems,  have  sought  to  overcome  weaknesses  and \nfiduciary  risks  associated  with  policy-based  lending.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the executing and \nimplementing agencies.  \n\n \nPoverty and Social  \n\nC. \n\n31. \nAlthough  Cambodia  achieved  consistently  high  economic  growth  rates  from  2007  to \n2015, poverty remains a challenge. Social development and poverty reduction will  be achieved \nmainly  through  improved  and  more  efficient  public  services;  higher-quality  budget  allocations \nlinking policy and budgets; increasing inclusion of poverty and gender priorities in line ministries\u2019 \nprogram  budgets;  and  overall  improvements  in  effectiveness,  efficiency,  and  accountability  of \npublic expenditures. The program is categorized as containing some gender elements. The TA \nloan will support capacity development in line ministries in order to include gender and poverty \nreduction interventions in their BSPs and program budgets.21 \n\n                                                \n20 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of supplementary linked documents in Appendix 2).    \n21 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe program and TA loans are category C for involuntary resettlement, environment, and \n\n32. \nindigenous people\u2019s safeguards as no impacts are expected in these areas.  \n  \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33. \nOverall  risks  for  subprogram  1  and  the  TA  loan  are  assessed  as  medium.  The  major \nrisks are (i) low PFM capacities, including an insufficient number of PFM-trained officials, (ii) a \nslowdown in reforms because of commune and national elections in 2017 and 2018, (iii) slower \ngrowth and unfavorable fiscal outcomes caused by external shocks, (iv) limited  internal controls \nand  internal  audit,  (v)  weak  internal  and  external  reporting,  and  (vi)  weak  external  audit \ncapacity. The elections risks are mitigated by scheduling approval of subprogram 2 in 2019, well \nafter  the  elections.  Mitigation  of  all  other  medium-level  risks  will  be  addressed  through  policy \nreforms under the proposed program and PFMRP, as well as by capacity building under the TA \nloan. A risk assessment and risk management plan will be implemented to overcome fiduciary \nrisks in implementing the TA loan. The integrated benefits and impacts of the proposed program \nare expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \n\n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n34. \nThe  government  and  the  MEF  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n35. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  loan  would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank and recommend that the \nBoard approve \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  programmatic  approach for  the  Strengthening  Public  Financial  Management  \nProgram; \nthe  policy-based  loan in  various currencies equivalent  to SDR18,939,000  to  the \nKingdom  of  Cambodia  for  subprogram  1  of  the  Strengthening  Public  Financial \nManagement  Program,  from  ADB's  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an  interest \ncharge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum thereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board; and \nthe  technical  assistance  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR2,501,000 \nto  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  subprogram  1  of  the  Strengthening  Public \nFinancial  Management  Program,  from  ADB's  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with \nthose set forth in the draft technical assistance loan agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n5 September 2016 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Program is Aligned with \n\nEffective and efficient public service delivery and inclusive growth (Public Financial Management \nReform Program, 2005\u20132025)a \n\n \n\n \nResults \nChain \nOutcome \n\nThe efficiency, \neffectiveness, \nand \naccountability \nof public \nexpenditure \nand revenue \nmanagement \nenhanced. \n\nPerformance Indicators with Targets and \nBaselines \n \n\nBy 2020 \n\nImprovement in PEFA assessment ratings of the \nfollowing key summary PFM areas:  \n\n(i)  Budget credibility: from C+ (2015) to B. \n(ii)  Budget policy linkages: from C+ (2015) to \n\nB. \n\nC+. \n\n(iii)  Financial accountability: from C (2015) to \n\n(iv)  External audit: from D+ (2010) to C. \n\nData \nSources and \nReporting \n \n\n2015 and \n2020 PEFA \nreports. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n1.
