It  will  reduce  flood  and  riverbank \nerosion  risks  through  strengthening  flood  and  riverbank  erosion  management  institutional \nsystems, and establishing integrated and sustainable structural and nonstructural risk mitigation \nsystems in priority protection reaches.2 The investment program is the follow-on to the Jamuna\u2013\nMeghna River Erosion Mitigation Project.3 It will extend successful technologies of the Jamuna\u2013\nMeghna project to other geographical areas, with necessary improvements.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe  livelihoods  of  people  in  Bangladesh  are  often  affected  by  water-related  disasters \nincluding  floods,  riverbank  erosion,  drought,  cyclones,  and  tidal  surges,  some  of  which  are \ndirectly related to the location of the country on a vast flat floodplain at the confluence of three \nmain  rivers\u2014the  Jamuna  (and  Padma),  the  Ganges,  and  the  Meghna.  Global  climate  change \ncould exacerbate these disasters.4 Riverbank erosion is one of the most prominent disasters in \nBangladesh,  caused  by  highly  dynamic  river  morphology.  About  5,000  to  6,000  hectares  of \nfloodplain  land  is  lost  annually.  This  process  affects  about  100,000  people  annually,  including \nthe  poor,  who  face  significant  social  hardships,  such  as  loss  of  homestead,  lands,  and  crops, \nand are displaced to fringe lands or urban slums. The country loses about $250 million because \nof riverbank erosions. Disaster risks increase as the population grows, and the high population \ndensity  of  the  country  restricts  the  scope  for  moving  people  away  from  disaster-prone  areas. \nErosion damage extends to infrastructure, including flood embankments. The high possibility of \nriverbank erosions hinders construction and rehabilitation of flood embankments. About 20% of \nthe  country  is  inundated  annually  during  the  monsoon  season,  resulting  in  loss  of  assets  and \ncrops. The threat of frequent flood and erosion disasters discourages investment and leads to \nlower economic growth of riverine areas. Effective flood and riverbank erosion risk management \nis essential for economic growth, livelihood improvement, and poverty reduction in these areas. \n \nThe  government  has  adopted  a  road  map  aimed  at  long-term  stabilization  of  the  main \n4. \nrivers in Bangladesh. The road map includes a policy framework, which is required to achieve \nthe  country\u2019s  aspirations  under  the  road  map.  It  builds  on  the  progress  of  a  sector  policy, \nplanning, and legal framework that the government has made since the 1990s to address water \nsector  challenges.  The  National  Water  Policy  was  adopted  in  1999  and  the  National  Water \nManagement  Plan  was  approved  in  2004.  Operationalization  and  institutionalization  of  the \npolicies  and  plans  have  been  slow,  but  are  expected  to  pick  up  with  the  enactment  of  the \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

Consultant\u2019s report. Manila.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nBangladesh  Water  Act,  2013.  The  Disaster  Management  Act  was  approved  in  2012,  and  the \nNational Plan for Disaster Management was also formulated and provides overall guidance for \nmanaging disaster related risks in all sectors.  \n\n \nThe  investment  program  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  support  forms  an \n5. \nintegral  part  of  the  road  map,  and  includes  the  development  and  implementation  of  holistic \nplanning  strategies  for  the  country\u2019s  main  rivers  as  well  as  physical  and  nonphysical \ninvestments  in the  central  part  of  the  country.  The World Bank  will  support  investments  in the \nnorthern  parts  of  the  country.  The  road  map  requires  investments  in  the  amount  of \n$853.7 million, of which $373.7 million is for the investment program.  \n \n6. \nThe  Jamuna\u2013Meghna  project  established  innovative  riverbank  protection  technologies, \napplying  unconventional  cost-effective  sand-filled  geotextile  bags  or  geo-bags,  and  systematic \ndumping of the geo-bags with stringent quality control and monitoring of underwater works. The \ntechnologies enable more stable riverbank protections, and easy adaptation to post-construction \nbathymetry changes. The investment program will expand the successful technologies to other \ngeographical  areas,  with necessary  improvements  that  include  (i)  more effective  integration of \nstructural and nonstructural measures with high stakeholder participation, (ii) building measures \nthat  ensure  the  sustainability  of  structures  in  the  project  design,  (iii) addressing  uncertainties \ncaused by climate change, and (iv) institutional capacity strengthening to address these issues. \nIt will introduce strategic planning for flood and erosion management of the main rivers, based \non  understanding  of  the  long-term  morphological  trend  of  the  entire  rivers,  as  opposed  to  the \ncurrent ad hoc and piecemeal approach. This strategic planning will be one of the contributors \nto long-term stabilization of the main rivers, and of higher economic growth of the country.  \n \n7. \nADB  will  support  the  investment  program  through  the  MFF  modality,  which  allows \n(i) flexible  phased  interventions  that  are  technically  appropriate  to  cope  with  the  dynamic  river \nmorphology in Bangladesh; (ii) strategic and systematic interventions that can facilitate longer-\nterm  flood  and  erosion  protection  management  planning;  and  (iii) longer,  more  effective,  and \nstrategic support for enhancing central-level institutional capacity. The comparison of financing \nmodality provides further details.5  \n \nUnder  the  investment  program,  flood  and  erosion  management  measures  will  be \n8. \nimplemented at priority erosion reaches over successive tranches. The first tranche will provide \nurgently  needed  structural  and  nonstructural  measures  in  three  high  priority  subproject  areas. \nSubsequent  tranches  will  extend  the  protection  structures  and  associated  nonstructural \nmeasures to adjacent stretches, and the design will be adjusted to the latest riverbank erosion \nconditions. Future tranches may cover other high priority subproject areas, depending on actual \nriver  erosion  status.  Phased  strategic  support  will  be  also  applied  to  institutional  capacity \nstrengthening, which will be continued throughout the investment program. \n \n9. \nThe  investment  program  is  in  line  with  government  and  ADB  strategies.  Economic \ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction  are  the  main  objectives  of  the  government\u2019s  Sixth  Five-Year \nDevelopment  Plan,  2011\u20132015. 6  Sustainable  management  of  rivers  and  enhancement  of \nclimate change resilience, including riverbank erosion protection and disaster risk management, \nare  considered  essential  to  accomplish the  objectives.  The  provision  of  infrastructure  for  flood \nand  riverbank  erosion  disaster  risk  management  is  also  a  core  area  of  operations  in  ADB\u2019s \n\n                                                \n5   Comparison of Financing Modality (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6   Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2011.

The  outcome  of  the  investment  program  will  be  reduced  flood  and  riverbank \nerosion risks in the subproject areas.   \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  anticipated  outputs  of  the  investment  program  are  (i)  flood  and  riverbank  erosion \n11. \nrisk  mitigation  functioning  at  priority  river  reaches,  (ii)  a  strengthened  institutional  system  for \nflood  and  riverbank  erosion  risk  management,  and  (iii)  an  operational  program  management \nsystem. The  same  outputs  are  anticipated for  the first  tranche,  and targets  of  the first tranche \nconstitute part of those of the investment program. The focus of the first output will be on both \nstructural  and  nonstructural  flood  and  riverbank  erosion  risk  mitigation  measures,  including \nriverbank  revetments,  flood  embankments,  community  capacity  development  for  sustainable \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of \nflood  and  erosion  risk \nmanagement, and livelihood enhancement for project-affected people. The investment program \nwill  provide  about  50  kilometers  (km)  of  riverbank  protection  structures,  89  km  of  flood \nembankments  (rehabilitation  and  new)  with  climate-resilient  design,  and  emergency  riverbank \nprotection structures. The first tranche will provide about 15 km of riverbank protection, 23 km of \nflood  embankments  (rehabilitation  and  new),  associated  nonstructural  activities,  and  urgent \nemergency  riverbank  protections  at  critical  sites.  The  thrust  of  the  second  output  is  on  an \nimproved  knowledge  base  and  institutional  capacity  in  sustainable  asset  management  and \nstrategic  management  of  the  main  rivers,  including  safeguard  monitoring  capacity.  The  third \noutput  aims  at  sound  program  implementation  and  successful completion.  Continuous  support \nwill be provided for the second and third outputs during the investment program.  \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\ninfrastructures  and \n\nfor \n\n12. \nThe investment program is estimated to cost $373.7 million (Table 1). The government \nhas requested an MFF in an amount up to $270.3 million to help finance part of the investment \nprogram. An amount not exceeding the equivalent of $255.0 million will be provided from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  applicable  to  Special  Funds \nresources  and/or  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  modality.  The  remaining  facility  amount  will  be \nconverted to ADB-administered cofinancing resources.9 The financing of the MFF will cover part \nof major items such as civil works, materials, vehicles, equipment, consulting services, training, \nand  incremental  costs  for  resettlement  and  project  management.  The  MFF  will  consist  of \nseveral tranches, subject to the government\u2019s submission of related periodic financing requests, \nexecution  of  the  related  legal  agreements  for  each  tranche,  and  fulfillment  of  terms  and \nconditions and undertakings set forth in the framework financing agreement.  \n \n \n                                                \n7   ADB.  2008.

The  Government  of \nBangladesh  will  provide  about  $23.3  million.  The  government  will  make  the  ADB  loan,  the \nNetherlands grant, and counterpart funds available to the executing agency through budgetary \nallocation.  Since  the  first  tranche  under  the  investment  program  is  financed  with  ADB-\nadministered  cofinancing  resources  as  well  as  Asian  Development  Fund  resources,  universal \nprocurement will apply to all contract packages financed under the first tranche. 10 \n  \n\n                                                \n10  ADB.  2013.

A project management office for the MFF will be established within \nBWDB to manage project implementation, which will be undertaken by subproject management \noffices established in each subproject area. The Department of Disaster Management under the \nMinistry  of  Disaster  Management  and  Relief  will  serve  as  the  implementing  agency  for  the \ncommunity-based flood risk management subcomponent. A program steering committee will be \nformed  for  central  level  interministerial  coordination.  A  technical  committee  will  oversee  the \nquality  of  technical  aspects,  including  studies,  planning,  and  structural  design.  A  consulting \nteam  led  by  an  international  firm  and  comprising  international  and  national  experts  will  be \nengaged  for  project  management  and  various  studies,  including  preparation  for  subsequent \ntranches. The project management consultant that will be engaged for the first tranche may be \nengaged through the single-source selection method for subsequent tranches, at the request of \nthe executing agency or the government, subject to satisfactory performance of the team. This \nis to ensure the continuity of project implementation. Nongovernment organizations will also be \nengaged  for  supporting  community  mobilization  and  stakeholder  participation  activities.  All \nprocurement  and  recruitment  to  be  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).

Four priority reaches, which may be protected under the \nMFF as subprojects, have been identified. Required protection works have been prioritized, and \ngrouped  into  three  tranches.  To  avoid  breaching  of  embankments,  flood  embankments  will  be \nconstructed  or  rehabilitated  after  protecting  riverbanks.  The  detailed  feasibility  studies  and \nstructural design for the first tranche were completed under the TA.  \n \n16. \nThe  investment  program  will  apply  innovative  riverbank  protection  technologies \nestablished under the Jamuna\u2013Meghna project. The structures constructed under the Jamuna\u2013\nMeghna  project  demonstrated  stability  and  technical  efficiency  during  the  three  monsoon \nseasons  after  completion.  Project  completion  reports  of  the  government  and  ADB  noted  the \nefficiency  of  the  new  riverbank  protection  method,  and  the  government\u2019s  project  completion \nreport recommended application of the Jamuna\u2013Meghna project method to other riverbanks in \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nthe country.12 Paved roads will be provided on flood embankments to prevent fast deterioration \nof embankments, and to ensure access for O&M and local transportation, including evacuation \nduring floods.  \n \nAdaptation  to  potential  climate  change  impacts  has  been  built  into  the  design  of  the \n17. \ninvestment  program  through  risk  screening,  vulnerability  assessment,  and  options  analysis. \nExisting analyses indicate that by 2040 flood river discharges could increase by 6%\u201315% as a \nresult  of  global  climate  change,  but  other  analyses  concluded  that  increases  in  discharge  are \nunlikely  to result  in  increased flood  water  levels  because of the  large  width  of the main rivers. \nFor the climate change adaptation, the investment program focuses on responding to potential \nclimate  change  impacts.  Flood  embankments  have  been  designed  to  enable  them  to  be \nheightened easily in the future. Community-based flood risk management activities will establish \nthe  preparedness  of  local  residents  against  potential  extreme flooding. The  project  area  is  not \nlocated in costal zones, so it is unlikely to be affected by the sea level rise and associated floods.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n18. \nEconomic  and  financial  analyses  undertaken  for  the  investment  program  indicate  that \nthe MFF and the first tranche are both economically viable and financially sustainable. Benefits \nof  the  MFF  will  be  derived  from  (i)  reduced  flood  damages  on  assets  and  crops,  (ii)  reduced \nland  losses  caused  by  erosion,  and  (iii) improved  transportation  connectivity  by  constructing \npaved roads on the embankments. BWDB\u2019s revenue budget can cover incremental O&M costs \nfor  infrastructure.    The  economic  analysis  was  conducted  for  the  three  subproject  areas  that \ncover the high priority river reaches. The economic internal rate of return is 15.0% for the first \ntranche and 21.9% for the MFF. That for the first tranche may be reduced to 12.5% if the cost \nincreases by 15.0%, and 12.1% if benefits are reduced by 15.0%. The proposed investment will \nremain economically feasible under these scenarios. Besides, the investment program will bring \nnonquantifiable  benefits such  as reduced  cost for relief  and  reconstruction of  households,  and \nmore stable livelihoods of people living in riverine areas. It could also bring increased incomes \nfor direct beneficiaries through improved agricultural productivity on protected lands.  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n19. \nThe  financial  and  procurement  management  capacity  of  BWDB  was  confirmed  to  be \ngenerally sound through assessments conducted in 2013. The project completion report of the \nJamuna\u2013Meghna project concluded that BWDB\u2019s institutional capacity as the executing agency \nwas satisfactory and that it was strengthened through the project. The investment program set \nclear input and output targets to ensure good governance. Risk mitigation measures have been \nidentified and incorporated in the project design and risk management plan (Table 4).  \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n20. \nwith the government and BWDB. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the facility administration manual (footnote 11).  \n \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n21. \nDespite  recent  improvements,  poverty  remains  the  dominant  problem  in  Bangladesh, \nwith 31.5% of its population living below poverty line.13 Riparian fringe lands, which are prone to \nriverbank erosion and flooding, are typically occupied by the landless poor, and the majority of \nthem  are  people  displaced  by  previous  riverbank  erosions.  Riverbank  erosion  forces repeated \ndisplacement and loss of livelihoods. Poverty incidence appears higher in riverine districts. The \ninvestment program will directly protect these poor residents, including women, in riverine fringe \nareas  from  frequent  riverbank  erosion  and  flood  inundation,  and  will  contribute  to  developing \nmore  sustainable  livelihoods  for  them.  The  poor  will  also  benefit  from  increased  farm \nproductivity.  The  farm  income  of  tenant  farmers  is  projected  to  increase  by  35%\u201348%  in  the \nprotected subproject areas. Increased farm activity will raise the overall demand for farm labor \nby  30%,  all  of  which  is  expected  to  be  provided  by  landless  and  marginal  farmers.  The \ninvestment program will significantly contribute to poverty reduction in the project area.     \n \n22. \nThe  first  tranche  is  classified  effective gender  mainstreaming. Women  will  benefit  from \n(i) being  heads  of  community  disaster  committees  for  the  community-based  flood  risk \nmanagement activities, with a minimum 33% female heads; (ii) receiving training for community-\nbased flood risk management and regular O&M of flood and erosion protection structures; and \n(iii) receiving livelihood improvement support for project-affected people. Women will also have \nincreased  opportunities  for  earning  cash  income  during  the  construction,  which  will  adopt  a \nlabor-intensive  construction  method  developed  under  the  Jamuna\u2013Meghna  project.  The \nsubsequent tranches are also likely to be classified effective gender mainstreaming.  \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\n23. \nEnvironment.  The  first  tranche  is  categorized  A  for  environment.  The  project \ninterventions will result in positive impacts such as reduced flood damage to crops, security of \nland  from  erosion,  and  improved  agricultural  and  investment  conditions.  However,  changes  in \nfloodplain hydrology resulting from construction of flood embankments will bring some negative \nimpacts.  The  key  potential  negative  impacts  are  impacts  on  floodplain-dependent  open  water \nfish  species  and  floodplain  aquatic  habitats,  and  potential  loss  of  natural  wetland  production. \nareas.  Measures  to  mitigate  these  impacts  have  been  built  into  the  project  design  and \naddressed  in  the  government\u2019s  environmental  impact  assessment,  which  contains  the \nenvironmental  management  plan.  Additional  environment  studies  will  be  conducted  during  the \nfirst  tranche  to  formulate  measures  to  offset  residual  impacts.  In  addition  to  these  studies,  a \nstrategic environmental assessment, which will assess the impacts of the investment program, \nwill  also  be  carried  out  during  the  first  tranche.  The  environmental  impact  assessment  was \nuploaded  on  ADB\u2019s  website,  meeting  the  120  days  disclosure  requirement.  An  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  has  also  been  developed  for  the  MFF.  Stakeholders  to  be \naffected  have  been  consulted  and  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been  established. \nSubsequent tranches are also likely to be categorized A for environment.  \n \n24. \ninvoluntary \nresettlement. About 94 hectares of land will be acquired for the Jamuna right bank 1 subproject \narea.  The  land  is  required  for  (i)  restoration  of  an  embankment  along  the  Jamuna  River \n(12.5 km),  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  embankments  along  tributaries  (10.5  km),  and  (iii)  riverbank \nland  acquisition  will  affect \nprotection  works  along \n\nthe  Jamuna  River  (1.0  km).

The remaining 4,560 persons will be physically displaced. The affected \npersons  are  also  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  flood  and  riverbank  erosion  protection.  Impacts  of \nthe land acquisition include loss of land, structures, and trees. A resettlement framework and a \nresettlement  plan  have  been  finalized  and  were  agreed  with  the  executing  agency,  following \ngovernment laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. They were disclosed \non the ADB website with endorsement by the executing agency. The resettlement plan includes \na  relocation  plan  as  well  as  economic  rehabilitation  of  the  affected  persons.  Extensive \nconsultations with the affected persons were conducted during the TA, and relevant information \nfrom  the  resettlement  plan  was explained to  them.  BWDB  has  developed  institutional  capacity \nfor mitigating social risks through executing a number of externally funded projects. \n  \nTwo  more  resettlement  plans  for  the  remaining  two  subproject  areas  will  be  prepared \n25. \nunder  the  first  tranche,  for  resettlement  and  land  acquisition  of  14  km  of  riverbank  protection \nworks along the Jamuna and Padma rivers. Resettlement plans for these areas will be prepared \nafter approval of the first tranche by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, and just before the construction \nof structures, in accordance with the resettlement framework; the estimated budget is included \nin  the  project  cost.  This  flexibility  will  facilitate  dealing  with  significant  riverbank  alignment \nchanges  resulting  from  progressive  erosions.  Stakeholders  in  the  two  subproject  areas  have \nbeen  consulted  during  the  TA.  Subsequent  tranches  are  likely  to  be  categorized  A  for \ninvoluntary resettlement.   \n \n26. \nIndigenous  people.  The  first  tranche  is  categorized  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  There \nare  no  indigenous  peoples  as  defined  for  operational  purposes  by  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement in any of the identified subproject areas of the first tranche and subsequent tranches \nunder  the  investment  program.  As  the  subsequent  tranches  will  also  be  categorized  C,  an \nindigenous peoples planning framework for the investment program was not prepared. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n\n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 14 The  overall  benefits  of  the  investment \nprogram are expected to overweigh the potential costs from the risks.  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nDelayed commencement of civil \nworks for embankments caused \nby delays in land acquisition by \ndeputy commissioner  \nPotential decline of financial \nmanagement capacity due to \nchanges of PMO staff \n\nUnderachievement of technical \nand financial compliance related \nto underwater protections \n\nInefficient interagency \ncoordination, especially between \n\nMitigating Measures \n\n(i) Advance action for detailed design of embankments, followed \nby the advance initiation of land acquisition and resettlement plan \nimplementation, and (ii) preparation of and compliance with time-\nbound action plan for advanced actions. \n(i) Regular training of PMO staff on project management and \nfinancial management; (ii) regular internal and external auditing; \nand (iii) ensuring transparency, including the establishment of a \nmanagement information system and project website. \n(i) Regular underwater surveys during and after construction, \n(ii) systematic and detailed recording of the physical progress of \nunderwater works, and (iii) adequate inputs of quality control \nexperts under the project management consulting services.  \n(i) Establishment of a program steering committee comprising \nrepresentatives from MOWR, BWDB, DDM, and other government \n\n                                                \n14 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nRisks \nBWDB and DDM \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nagencies; (ii) signing of MOU to define clear distribution of \nresponsibilities; (iii) holding regular workshops for information \nsharing; and (iv) engaging only one consultant team for project \nimplementation support to both BWDB and DDM. \n \n\nBWDB  =  Bangladesh  Water  Development  Board,  DDM  =  Department  of  Disaster  Management, \nMOU = memorandum  of  understanding,  MOWR  =  Ministry  of  Water  Resources,  PMO  =  project  management \noffice.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe  government  and  BWDB  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  investment \n28. \nprogram and the projects thereafter shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the facility administration manual and loan documents. \n \n29. \nThe  government  and  BWDB  have  given  ADB  certain  undertakings  for  the  MFF,  which \nare  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.
