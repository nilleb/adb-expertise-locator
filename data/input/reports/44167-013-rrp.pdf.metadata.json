I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Flood and \nRiverbank Erosion Risk Management Investment Program.1 \n \n2.  The investment program will improve the livelihoods of people in the project area along \nthe Jamuna, Padma, and Ganges rivers in Bangladesh. It will  reduce flood and riverbank \nerosion  risks  through  strengthening  flood  and  riverbank  erosion  management  institutional \nsystems, and establishing integrated and sustainable structural and nonstructural risk mitigation \nsystems in priority protection reaches.2 The investment program is the follow-on to the Jamuna\u2013\nMeghna River Erosion Mitigation Project.3 It will extend successful technologies of the Jamuna\u2013\nMeghna project to other geographical areas, with necessary improvements.  \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The livelihoods of people in Bangladesh are often affected by water-related disasters \nincluding floods, riverbank erosion, drought, cyclones, and tidal surges, some of which are \ndirectly related to the location of the country on a vast flat floodplain at the confluence of three \nmain rivers\u2014the Jamuna (and Padma), the Ganges, and the Meghna. Global climate change \ncould exacerbate these disasters.4 Riverbank erosion is one of the most prominent disasters in \nBangladesh, caused by highly dynamic river morphology. About 5,000 to 6,000 hectares of \nfloodplain land is lost annually. This process affects about 100,000 people annually, including \nthe poor, who face significant social hardships, such as loss of homestead, lands, and crops, \nand are displaced to fringe lands or urban slums. The country loses about $250 million because \nof riverbank erosions. Disaster risks increase as the population grows, and the high population \ndensity of the country restricts the scope for moving people away from disaster-prone areas. \nErosion damage extends to infrastructure, including flood embankments. The high possibility of \nriverbank erosions hinders construction and rehabilitation of flood embankments. About 20% of \nthe country is inundated annually during the monsoon season, resulting in loss of assets and \ncrops. The threat of frequent flood and erosion disasters discourages investment and leads to \nlower economic growth of riverine areas. Effective flood and riverbank erosion risk management \nis essential for economic growth, livelihood improvement, and poverty reduction in these areas. \n \n4.  The government has adopted a road map aimed at long-term stabilization of the main \nrivers in Bangladesh. The road map includes a policy framework, which is required to achieve \nthe country\u2019s aspirations under the road map. It builds on the progress of a sector policy, \nplanning, and legal framework that the government has made since the 1990s to address water \nsector challenges. The National Water Policy was adopted in 1999 and the National Water \nManagement  Plan  was  approved  in  2004.  Operationalization  and  institutionalization  of  the \npolicies and plans have been slow, but are expected to pick up with the enactment of the \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Consultant\u2019s report. Manila.  ", "2   \nBangladesh Water Act, 2013. The Disaster Management Act was approved in 2012, and the \nNational Plan for Disaster Management was also formulated and provides overall guidance for \nmanaging disaster related risks in all sectors.  \n \n5.  The investment program the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will support forms an \nintegral part of the road map, and includes the development and implementation of holistic \nplanning  strategies  for  the  country\u2019s  main  rivers  as  well  as  physical  and  nonphysical \ninvestments in the central part of the country. The World Bank will support investments in the \nnorthern  parts  of  the  country.  The  road  map  requires  investments  in  the  amount  of \n$853.7 million, of which $373.7 million is for the investment program.  \n \n6.  The Jamuna\u2013Meghna project established innovative riverbank protection technologies, \napplying unconventional cost-effective sand-filled geotextile bags or geo-bags, and systematic \ndumping of the geo-bags with stringent quality control and monitoring of underwater works. The \ntechnologies enable more stable riverbank protections, and easy adaptation to post-construction \nbathymetry changes. The investment program will expand the successful technologies to other \ngeographical areas, with necessary improvements that include (i) more effective integration of \nstructural and nonstructural measures with high stakeholder participation, (ii) building measures \nthat ensure the sustainability of structures in the project design, (iii) addressing uncertainties \ncaused by climate change, and (iv) institutional capacity strengthening to address these issues. \nIt will introduce strategic planning for flood and erosion management of the main rivers, based \non understanding of the long-term morphological trend of the entire rivers, as opposed to the \ncurrent ad hoc and piecemeal approach. This strategic planning will be one of the contributors \nto long-term stabilization of the main rivers, and of higher economic growth of the country.  \n \n7.  ADB  will  support  the  investment  program  through  the  MFF  modality,  which  allows \n(i) flexible phased interventions that are technically appropriate to cope with the dynamic river \nmorphology in Bangladesh; (ii) strategic and systematic interventions that can facilitate longer-\nterm flood and erosion protection management planning; and (iii) longer, more effective, and \nstrategic support for enhancing central-level institutional capacity. The comparison of financing \nmodality provides further details.5  \n \n8.  Under  the  investment  program,  flood  and  erosion  management  measures  will  be \nimplemented at priority erosion reaches over successive tranches. The first tranche will provide \nurgently needed structural and nonstructural measures in three high priority subproject areas. \nSubsequent  tranches  will  extend  the  protection  structures  and  associated  nonstructural \nmeasures to adjacent stretches, and the design will be adjusted to the latest riverbank erosion \nconditions. Future tranches may cover other high priority subproject areas, depending on actual \nriver  erosion  status.  Phased  strategic  support  will  be  also  applied  to  institutional  capacity \nstrengthening, which will be continued throughout the investment program. \n \n9.  The  investment  program  is  in  line  with  government  and  ADB  strategies.  Economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction are the main objectives of the government\u2019s Sixth Five-Year \nDevelopment  Plan,  2011\u20132015.6 Sustainable  management  of  rivers  and  enhancement  of \nclimate change resilience, including riverbank erosion protection and disaster risk management, \nare considered essential to accomplish the objectives. The provision of infrastructure for flood \nand riverbank erosion disaster risk management is also a core area of operations in ADB\u2019s \n                                                \n5  Comparison of Financing Modality (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2011.

Impact and Outcome \n10.  The expected impact of the investment program will be improved livelihoods  in the \nproject area. The outcome of the investment program will be reduced flood and riverbank \nerosion risks in the subproject areas.   \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The anticipated outputs of the investment program are (i) flood and riverbank erosion \nrisk mitigation functioning at priority river reaches, (ii) a strengthened institutional system for \nflood and riverbank erosion risk management, and (iii) an operational program management \nsystem. The same outputs are anticipated for the first tranche, and targets of the first tranche \nconstitute part of those of the investment program. The focus of the first output will be on both \nstructural and nonstructural flood and riverbank erosion risk mitigation measures, including \nriverbank revetments, flood embankments, community capacity development for sustainable \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  infrastructures  and  for  flood  and  erosion  risk \nmanagement, and livelihood enhancement for project-affected people. The investment program \nwill  provide  about  50  kilometers  (km)  of  riverbank  protection  structures,  89  km  of  flood \nembankments (rehabilitation and new) with climate-resilient design, and emergency riverbank \nprotection structures. The first tranche will provide about 15 km of riverbank protection, 23 km of \nflood embankments (rehabilitation and new), associated nonstructural activities, and urgent \nemergency riverbank protections at critical sites. The thrust of the second output is on an \nimproved knowledge base and institutional capacity in sustainable asset management and \nstrategic management of the main rivers, including safeguard monitoring capacity. The third \noutput aims at sound program implementation and successful completion. Continuous support \nwill be provided for the second and third outputs during the investment program.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n12.  The investment program is estimated to cost $373.7 million (Table 1). The government \nhas requested an MFF in an amount up to $270.3 million to help finance part of the investment \nprogram. An amount not exceeding the equivalent of $255.0 million will be provided from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  applicable  to  Special  Funds \nresources and/or from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending modality. The remaining facility amount will be \nconverted to ADB-administered cofinancing resources.9 The financing of the MFF will cover part \nof major items such as civil works, materials, vehicles, equipment, consulting services, training, \nand  incremental  costs  for  resettlement  and  project  management.  The  MFF  will  consist  of \nseveral tranches, subject to the government\u2019s submission of related periodic financing requests, \nexecution  of  the  related  legal  agreements  for  each  tranche,  and  fulfillment  of  terms  and \nconditions and undertakings set forth in the framework financing agreement.  \n \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2008.

Interest during construction for the estimated amount of Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) financing has been computed at 2.0% per year. For the first tranche, the financing \ncharges include 2% of administration charges for ADB\u2019s administration of a grant from the Government of the \nNetherlands. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n13.  The financing plan is in Table 2. The first project is estimated to cost $103.6 million. As \nthe first tranche under the MFF, ADB will provide a loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources in \nan amount equivalent to $65.0 million and administer a grant from the Government of the \nNetherlands in an amount of $15.3 million. The ADB loan will have a term of 25 years, including \na grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate of 2.0% throughout the loan maturity (the \ninterest charges during implementation to be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and \nconditions as will be set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. ADB will finance part of \nmajor items such as civil works, materials, vehicles, equipment, consulting services, training, \nand  incremental  costs  for  resettlement  and  project  management.  The  Government  of  the \nNetherlands will finance $15.3 million on a grant basis to cover 14.8% of the total project cost \nfor the first tranche. The funds from the Government of the Netherlands will be administered by \nADB,  and  will  finance  part  of  consulting  services  and  pilot  works.  The  Government  of \nBangladesh will provide about $23.3 million. The government will make the ADB loan, the \nNetherlands grant, and counterpart funds available to the executing agency through budgetary \nallocation.  Since  the  first  tranche  under  the  investment  program  is  financed  with  ADB-\nadministered cofinancing resources as well as Asian Development Fund resources, universal \nprocurement will apply to all contract packages financed under the first tranche. 10 \n  \n                                                \n10  ADB. 2013.

Implementation Arrangements  \n14.  The executing agency will be Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) under the \nMinistry of Water Resources. A project management office for the MFF will be established within \nBWDB to manage project implementation, which will be undertaken by subproject management \noffices established in each subproject area. The Department of Disaster Management under the \nMinistry of Disaster Management and Relief will serve as the implementing agency for the \ncommunity-based flood risk management subcomponent. A program steering committee will be \nformed for central level interministerial coordination. A technical committee will oversee the \nquality of technical aspects, including studies, planning, and structural design. A consulting \nteam led by an international firm and comprising international and national experts will be \nengaged for project management and various studies, including preparation for subsequent \ntranches. The project management consultant that will be engaged for the first tranche may be \nengaged through the single-source selection method for subsequent tranches, at the request of \nthe executing agency or the government, subject to satisfactory performance of the team. This \nis to ensure the continuity of project implementation. Nongovernment organizations will also be \nengaged  for  supporting  community  mobilization  and  stakeholder  participation  activities.  All \nprocurement  and  recruitment  to  be  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n15.  The technical viability and economic feasibility have been confirmed through the project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA). Four priority reaches, which may be protected under the \nMFF as subprojects, have been identified. Required protection works have been prioritized, and \ngrouped into three tranches. To avoid breaching of embankments, flood embankments will be \nconstructed  or  rehabilitated  after  protecting  riverbanks.  The  detailed  feasibility  studies  and \nstructural design for the first tranche were completed under the TA.  \n \n16.  The  investment  program  will  apply  innovative  riverbank  protection  technologies \nestablished under the Jamuna\u2013Meghna project. The structures constructed under the Jamuna\u2013\nMeghna  project  demonstrated  stability  and  technical  efficiency  during  the  three  monsoon \nseasons after completion. Project completion reports of the government and ADB noted the \nefficiency of the new riverbank protection method, and the government\u2019s project completion \nreport recommended application of the Jamuna\u2013Meghna project method to other riverbanks in ", "    7 \nthe country.12 Paved roads will be provided on flood embankments to prevent fast deterioration \nof embankments, and to ensure access for O&M and local transportation, including evacuation \nduring floods.  \n \n17.  Adaptation to potential climate change impacts has been built into the design of the \ninvestment program through risk screening, vulnerability assessment, and options analysis. \nExisting analyses indicate that by 2040 flood river discharges could increase by 6%\u201315% as a \nresult of global climate change, but other analyses concluded that increases in discharge are \nunlikely to result in increased flood water levels because of the large width of the main rivers. \nFor the climate change adaptation, the investment program focuses on responding to potential \nclimate  change  impacts.  Flood  embankments  have  been  designed  to  enable  them  to  be \nheightened easily in the future. Community-based flood risk management activities will establish \nthe preparedness of local residents against potential extreme flooding. The project area is not \nlocated in costal zones, so it is unlikely to be affected by the sea level rise and associated floods.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n18.  Economic and financial analyses undertaken for the investment program indicate that \nthe MFF and the first tranche are both economically viable and financially sustainable. Benefits \nof the MFF will be derived from (i) reduced flood damages on assets and crops, (ii) reduced \nland losses caused by erosion, and (iii) improved transportation connectivity by constructing \npaved roads on the embankments. BWDB\u2019s revenue budget can cover incremental O&M costs \nfor infrastructure.  The economic analysis was conducted for the three subproject areas that \ncover the high priority river reaches. The economic internal rate of return is 15.0% for the first \ntranche and 21.9% for the MFF. That for the first tranche may be reduced to 12.5% if the cost \nincreases by 15.0%, and 12.1% if benefits are reduced by 15.0%. The proposed investment will \nremain economically feasible under these scenarios. Besides, the investment program will bring \nnonquantifiable benefits such as reduced cost for relief and reconstruction of households, and \nmore stable livelihoods of people living in riverine areas. It could also bring increased incomes \nfor direct beneficiaries through improved agricultural productivity on protected lands.  \n \nC.  Governance \n19.  The financial and procurement management capacity of BWDB was confirmed to be \ngenerally sound through assessments conducted in 2013. The project completion report of the \nJamuna\u2013Meghna project concluded that BWDB\u2019s institutional capacity as the executing agency \nwas satisfactory and that it was strengthened through the project. The investment program set \nclear input and output targets to ensure good governance. Risk mitigation measures have been \nidentified and incorporated in the project design and risk management plan (Table 4).  \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and BWDB. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the facility administration manual (footnote 11).  \n \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2013. Completion Report: Jamuna-Meghna River Erosion Mitigation Project in Bangladesh. Manila. \n ", "8   \nD.  Poverty and Social \n21.  Despite recent improvements, poverty remains the dominant problem in Bangladesh, \nwith 31.5% of its population living below poverty line.13 Riparian fringe lands, which are prone to \nriverbank erosion and flooding, are typically occupied by the landless poor, and the majority of \nthem are people displaced by previous riverbank erosions. Riverbank erosion forces repeated \ndisplacement and loss of livelihoods. Poverty incidence appears higher in riverine districts. The \ninvestment program will directly protect these poor residents, including women, in riverine fringe \nareas from frequent riverbank erosion and flood inundation, and will contribute to developing \nmore  sustainable  livelihoods  for  them.  The  poor  will  also  benefit  from  increased  farm \nproductivity. The farm income of tenant farmers is projected to increase by 35%\u201348% in the \nprotected subproject areas. Increased farm activity will raise the overall demand for farm labor \nby  30%,  all  of  which  is  expected  to  be  provided  by  landless  and  marginal  farmers.  The \ninvestment program will significantly contribute to poverty reduction in the project area.     \n \n22.  The first tranche is classified effective gender mainstreaming. Women will benefit from \n(i) being  heads  of  community  disaster  committees  for  the  community-based  flood  risk \nmanagement activities, with a minimum 33% female heads; (ii) receiving training for community-\nbased flood risk management and regular O&M of flood and erosion protection structures; and \n(iii) receiving livelihood improvement support for project-affected people. Women will also have \nincreased opportunities for earning cash income during the construction, which will adopt a \nlabor-intensive  construction  method  developed  under  the  Jamuna\u2013Meghna  project.  The \nsubsequent tranches are also likely to be classified effective gender mainstreaming.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n23.  Environment.  The  first  tranche  is  categorized  A  for  environment.  The  project \ninterventions will result in positive impacts such as reduced flood damage to crops, security of \nland from erosion, and improved agricultural and investment conditions. However, changes in \nfloodplain hydrology resulting from construction of flood embankments will bring some negative \nimpacts. The key potential negative impacts are impacts on floodplain-dependent open water \nfish species and floodplain aquatic habitats, and potential loss of natural wetland production. \nareas.  Measures  to  mitigate  these  impacts  have  been  built  into  the  project  design  and \naddressed  in  the  government\u2019s  environmental  impact  assessment,  which  contains  the \nenvironmental management plan. Additional environment studies will be conducted during the \nfirst tranche to formulate measures to offset residual impacts. In addition to these studies, a \nstrategic environmental assessment, which will assess the impacts of the investment program, \nwill also be carried out during the first tranche. The environmental impact assessment was \nuploaded on ADB\u2019s website, meeting the 120 days disclosure requirement. An environmental \nassessment and review framework has also been developed for the MFF. Stakeholders to be \naffected  have  been  consulted  and  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been  established. \nSubsequent tranches are also likely to be categorized A for environment.  \n \n24.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  first  tranche  is  categorized  A  for  involuntary \nresettlement. About 94 hectares of land will be acquired for the Jamuna right bank 1 subproject \narea.  The  land  is  required  for  (i)  restoration  of  an  embankment  along  the  Jamuna  River \n(12.5 km), (ii) rehabilitation of embankments along tributaries (10.5 km), and (iii) riverbank \nprotection  works  along  the  Jamuna  River  (1.0  km).  The  land  acquisition  will  affect \n                                                \n13  Poverty headcount rate at the upper poverty line by the cost of basic needs method. Bangladesh Bureau of \nStatistics. 2011. Statistical Year Book of Bangladesh\u20132010. Dhaka.  ", "    9 \n1,184 households comprising 8,953 persons, of which 4,393 persons will lose 10% or more of \ntheir productive assets. The remaining 4,560 persons will be physically displaced. The affected \npersons are also direct beneficiaries of the flood and riverbank erosion protection. Impacts of \nthe land acquisition include loss of land, structures, and trees. A resettlement framework and a \nresettlement plan have been finalized and were agreed with the executing agency, following \ngovernment laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. They were disclosed \non the ADB website with endorsement by the executing agency. The resettlement plan includes \na  relocation  plan  as  well  as  economic  rehabilitation  of  the  affected  persons.  Extensive \nconsultations with the affected persons were conducted during the TA, and relevant information \nfrom the resettlement plan was explained to them. BWDB has developed institutional capacity \nfor mitigating social risks through executing a number of externally funded projects. \n  \n25.  Two more resettlement plans for the remaining two subproject areas will be prepared \nunder the first tranche, for resettlement and land acquisition of 14 km of riverbank protection \nworks along the Jamuna and Padma rivers. Resettlement plans for these areas will be prepared \nafter approval of the first tranche by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, and just before the construction \nof structures, in accordance with the resettlement framework; the estimated budget is included \nin  the  project  cost. This  flexibility  will  facilitate  dealing  with  significant  riverbank  alignment \nchanges resulting from progressive erosions. Stakeholders in the two subproject areas have \nbeen  consulted  during  the  TA.  Subsequent  tranches  are  likely  to  be  categorized  A  for \ninvoluntary resettlement.   \n \n26.  Indigenous people. The first tranche is categorized C for indigenous peoples. There \nare no indigenous peoples as defined for operational purposes by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement in any of the identified subproject areas of the first tranche and subsequent tranches \nunder the investment program. As the subsequent tranches will also be categorized C, an \nindigenous peoples planning framework for the investment program was not prepared. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.14 The overall benefits of the investment \nprogram are expected to overweigh the potential costs from the risks.  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDelayed commencement of civil  (i) Advance action for detailed design of embankments, followed \nworks for embankments caused  by the advance initiation of land acquisition and resettlement plan \nby delays in land acquisition by  implementation, and (ii) preparation of and compliance with time-\ndeputy commissioner   bound action plan for advanced actions. \nPotential decline of financial  (i) Regular training of PMO staff on project management and \nmanagement capacity due to  financial management; (ii) regular internal and external auditing; \nchanges of PMO staff  and (iii) ensuring transparency, including the establishment of a \nmanagement information system and project website. \nUnderachievement of technical  (i) Regular underwater surveys during and after construction, \nand financial compliance related  (ii) systematic and detailed recording of the physical progress of \nto underwater protections  underwater works, and (iii) adequate inputs of quality control \nexperts under the project management consulting services.  \nInefficient interagency  (i) Establishment of a program steering committee comprising \ncoordination, especially between  representatives from MOWR, BWDB, DDM, and other government \n                                                \n14 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nBWDB and DDM  agencies; (ii) signing of MOU to define clear distribution of \nresponsibilities; (iii) holding regular workshops for information \nsharing; and (iv) engaging only one consultant team for project \nimplementation support to both BWDB and DDM. \n \nBWDB  =  Bangladesh  Water  Development  Board,  DDM  =  Department  of  Disaster  Management, \nMOU = memorandum of understanding, MOWR = Ministry of Water Resources, PMO = project management \noffice.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.

The government and BWDB have given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which \nare  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.  Specific  covenants  agreed  by  the \ngovernment and BWDB with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the \nloan agreement and project agreement for the respective tranches.  \n \n30.
