I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Namangan 500-Kilovolt Power Transmission Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will erect new high-voltage transmission assets to secure the power supply \nto  Fergana  Valley  and  implement  institutional  changes  in  the  power  utility  company, \nUzbekenergo.  The  project  will  increase  energy  security  through  the  diversification  and \nexpansion of energy supply routes. It will improve power supply reliability in the country and, in \nparticular, the Namangan, Fergana, and Andijon provinces; reduce transmission losses; and \nimprove the operational efficiency of the power sector.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The establishment of a Central Asian transmission system started during the Soviet era \nin the 1960s. The transmission lines connecting the power plants and substations feeding the \nload centers are at 500 kilovolt (kV) and 220 kV levels. The transmission system was designed \nfollowing the technical and geographical requirements to benefit from the diversified energy and \nwater resources in Central Asia. Yet, the locations of the substations and the line routing did not \ntake into account the countries\u2019 borders, as these were considered not relevant at that time. \n \n4.  The power grid of Uzbekistan is a major component of the integrated and synchronized \nhigh-voltage power transmission network of the Central Asian power system. The Coordinating \nDispatch Center in Tashkent manages network operation and planning. Trading arrangements \nbetween the countries are constrained by aging infrastructure, as well as varied energy sector \ndevelopment priorities of each participating country after independence. The reliable and secure \noperation of the transmission network is a prerequisite for power trade to reduce the economic \ncost of electricity for Uzbekistan and its neighbors. \n \n5.  A poorly designed transmission grid and associated capacity constraints became an \nacute  problem,  particularly  for  the  most  densely  populated  region  of  Uzbekistan,  Fergana \nValley. More than 8 million people and several large industries in the region are supplied from \nthe main Uzbek grid (400 megawatts [MW]), the Kyrgyz Republic (1,300 MW), and generation in \nFergana (100 MW). As demand increases, the underdeveloped local transmission grid impedes \nthe reliable supply of power to domestic customers. During the 3-month summer period, peak \ndemand reaches 2,000 MW, creating overload in the current 220 kV transmission system that \nleads  to  a  voltage  drop  of  185 kV.  This  results  in  a  responsive  action  by  Uzbekenergo: \ndisconnecting customers to reduce the load by an average of 150 MW. Registered cases of \nvoltage drops to 100 kV have resulted in the disconnection of 80% of customers in Fergana, \nfollowed by a cascading effect of disconnections even in Kazakhstan. Regular maintenance of \nthe  grid  is  also  impossible  without  disconnection  of  a  significant  number  of  customers. \nTherefore, additional transmission capacity is urgently needed to satisfy current and future \npower demand and to undertake proper maintenance, which contributes to high voltage grid \nstability in Uzbekistan and its neighbors. \n \n6.  Facing the challenges in energy security,  deteriorating infrastructure, and unreliable \npower supply, the Government of Uzbekistan has taken various initiatives. It approved a 5-year \nrolling investment plan amounting to $5 billion to rehabilitate and upgrade energy infrastructure. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA). ADB. 2012. Technical \nAssistance to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Namangan 500 kV Power Transmission Project. Manila (TA 8067-\nUZB, for $0.85 million, approved on 3 April). ", "2 \nIt also commenced institutional improvements to increase the transparency and operational \nefficiency of the electricity sector. It reorganized and reinforced the investment unit at the \nvertically  integrated  state-owned  power  utility  company,  Uzbekenergo,  to  implement  new \ninvestment  projects  more  effectively.  Actions  have  been  taken  to  improve  the  financial \nperformance of the company. A loss-reduction program was initiated by adopting advanced \nmeters to increase collections and reduce losses. Cost centers for generation, transmission, \nand  distribution  have  been  split.  Each  unit  has  a  separate  accounting  department  and \nimplementation  of  international  financial  reporting  standards-based  financial  statements  to \nimprove financial management is ongoing. Electricity tariffs have been gradually increasing to \nensure the cost recovery level is maintained. \n \n7.  Although a number of institutional changes have been initiated, little attention has been \npaid to improvements in the company\u2019s core operations. There is substantial room for cost \nsavings by improving the efficiency of system maintenance, planning, and budgeting; and this \ncould  be  achieved  using  external  expertise.  Since  the  investments  under  this  project  are \nfocused on transmission, Uzbekenergo has requested assistance for the reorganization of the \ntransmission  asset  management  department  to  improve  efficient  budget  provisioning  for \nmaintenance and optimize scheduling. The transmission system planning department is also \ninadequate to meet present sector needs. Lack of modern tools and skills makes it impossible to \nplan  an  optimal  system  and,  thus,  optimize  investments.  Both  departments  need  to  be \nrestructured,  and  equipped  with  modern  technologies  and  trained  personnel.  Further \ninstitutional and operational improvements in the generation and distribution subsectors will be \nimplemented under the relevant investment projects, which are in the pipeline. \n  \n8.  In  2012,  the  power  sector  regional  master  plan  was  prepared  under  Central  Asia \nRegional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC).3 According  to  the  master  plan,  the  Namangan \nproject is a least-cost solution to bring additional power to Fergana since the region does not \nhave hydro or fossil fuel reserves for new local generation, and no additional power import is \navailable from the Kyrgyz Republic. The solution is to bring more power from Uzbekistan\u2019s \ncentral grid by adding transmission capacity. The master plan identified the project as having \nprincipal importance for the reliability of the Central Asian transmission grid to support regional \npower trade. \n \n9.  The project is a government priority, and it requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide financial support. The project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business \nplan, 2011\u201320134 and is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.5 It will be the third project loan \nintervention in Uzbekistan\u2019s power sector, with focus on transmission. The first two loans were \nin the generation6 and distribution7 subsectors, and implementation is at the procurement stage. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the project will be improved reliability of power supply in Uzbekistan. The \noutcome of the project will be an expanded and modernized high voltage transmission grid \nproviding adequate and reliable power supply to Fergana Valley. \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2010.

The executing agency will be Uzbekenergo, which will assume overall responsibility of \nproject implementation. It has established a dedicated full-time project management unit (PMU) \nand staffed it with qualified and experienced personnel. The PMU, funded by Uzbekenergo\u2019s \ninternal  sources,  will  administer  all  consulting  and  procurement  contracts  on  behalf  of \nUzbekenergo. It will be responsible for preparing project plans, bid evaluation reports, progress \nreports, applications for withdrawal of funds, and any other reports required by ADB. \n \n17.  Procurement of goods from ADB loan proceeds will be undertaken following ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The procurement will follow \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures  using  standard  bidding  documents  for  goods \n(single-stage: two-envelope). An international procurement specialist will assist the PMU in the \npreparation of bidding documents and bid evaluation and will provide hands-on training to the \nprocurement staff of the PMU.10 \n \n18.  Uzbekenergo  will  employ  a  project  implementation  consultant.  This  consultant  will \nprovide technical, financial, and administrative support to the PMU during the entire project \nimplementation  period.  Two  other  consultant  firms  will  be  recruited  under  the  Operational \nImprovement  Program.  The  first  consulting  firm  will  be  responsible  for  preparation  of  the \ndetailed design, procurement, and installation of the transmission system planning software and \nhardware; preparation of the feasibility study for SCADA; and procurement and installation of \nthe video wall for the National Dispatch Center. The second firm will prepare detailed designs \nand specifications for the transmission asset management system, and assist in procurement \nand supervise installation. The consultant recruitment will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Quality- and cost-based selection with a \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 will be the default method for recruiting the consulting firms because \nof the complexity of the assignment and the application of modern technologies. \n \n                                                \n10 An international procurement specialist is recruited under the project preparatory TA (footnote 2). \n ", "6 \n19.  The project will be implemented over a 54-month period from November 2012 to May \n2017. The equipment supply contracts are expected to be awarded in the second half of 2013. \nUzbekenergo  and  the  implementation  consultant  will  prepare  a  detailed  implementation \nschedule during the preconstruction phase of the project and submit it to ADB. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  ADB conducted technical due diligence on the investment proposal and is satisfied with \nthe quality of the cost estimates, operating cost structures, appropriateness of the technology, \nand the execution plan. The readiness level is high and the technical solutions are assessed to \nbe more cost-effective than the alternatives. Uzbekenergo\u2019s operation and maintenance staff is \nfamiliar with the proposed design concepts. The technical proposals do not represent a shift \nfrom existing practices. Uzbekenergo has sufficient technical capacity and experienced staff to \nundertake construction of this project.11 \n \n21.  Transmission  system  planning  and  transmission  asset  management  systems  are  a \nstandard power utility practice based on proven technology and considered appropriate in this \ncase. These systems are a technological step change for the company. This will require training \nto be included in the terms of reference for consultants and contractors. This is routine practice \nfor a utility when first implementing similar systems. Investment sites were visited by consultants \nand ADB staff. The contracts will include sufficient spare parts and quality and performance \nguarantees. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  The economic viability is assessed for the overall project based on expected streams of \nbenefits and costs resulting from the construction, installation, and operations of the project \ncomponents over their economic lives. The project is economically viable, as the economic \ninternal rate of return in the base case of 23.1% exceeds the economic opportunity cost of \ncapital, assumed at 12.0%. The sensitivity analysis shows that the economic internal rate of \nreturn remains viable even in the case of increased capital expenditure and reduced benefits. \n \n23.  The financial internal rate of return of the project is 4.8%, which compares favorably with \nthe estimated weighted average cost of capital of 0.8%, indicating expected financial viability for \nthe project. Financial viability was gauged by comparing the costs and benefits in with- and \nwithout-project investment scenarios. Quantified benefits include enhanced reliability, increased \nconsumption, and avoided system losses. The sensitivity analysis shows that project viability is \nrobust to capital and operational expenditure increases, as well as reductions of the revenue \nstream earned by Uzbekenergo. \n \n24.  Uzbekenergo  is  a  100%  state-owned  holding  company  for  power  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution in Uzbekistan. It was established in August 2001 after public \nsector  reorganization  and  is  the  legal  successor  of  the  former  Ministry  of  Energy  and \nElectrification. Uzbekenergo\u2019s financial performance has been strong since 2006. The company \nhas been profitable, with return on equity maintained at above 10%. The low rate of tariff \ncollection resulted in increased accounts receivable and payable in three years, but this is being \naddressed  by  (i)  introducing  an  advanced  electricity  metering  system  that  will  reduce \n                                                \n11 Since 2007, Uzbekenergo implemented and commissioned three similar projects of which two were financed by \nmultilateral financial institutions and one financed by Uzbekenergo resources. In total, more than 580 km of 500 kV \ntransmission line was constructed and four 500 kV substations were constructed or reconstructed. \n ", "7 \ncommercial losses and uncollected tariffs (footnote 7), and (ii) seeking a court verdict to write off \nsome unrecoverable receivables. \n \n25.  The projected financial sustainability of Uzbekenergo for 2012\u20132022 incorporates over \nannual  investment  of  $600  million  to  modernize  its  power  facilities,  which  need  capacity \nexpansion and replacement of old and inefficient assets. The financial plan, with a good mix of \ndebt and Uzbekenergo\u2019s internal sources, can be implemented without putting undue stress on \nUzbekenergo\u2019s future finances and creditworthiness, but the tariff should be adjusted to reflect \nthe cost of services and inflation. Since 2004, the nominal tariff for electricity has increased at a \nrate higher than 15% per year, or almost five times, from SUM20 per kilowatt-hour to SUM97.5 \nper kilowatt-hour. Continued tariff increases above the inflation rate remain important for the \npower utility to achieve a sustainable financial performance without subsidy. The government is \ncommitted to maintaining cost of service tariffs for electricity. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  The  government  has  undertaken  a  series  of  measures  to  strengthen  its  national \ngovernance, including (i) legal reforms to improve the judiciary and courts; (ii) reforms to public \nsector management, especially public financial management and tax reforms; (iii) measures to \nmake the private sector more competitive; and (iv) more transparent procurement procedures. \nProgress has been made in public financial management, including the adoption of the Budget \nSystem Law and Treasury Law approved in 2007 and the public expenditure reform process \ncovering 2007\u20132018. Uzbekistan acceded to the United Nations Convention against Corruption \nin July 2008. \n \n27.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  Uzbekenergo  found  that  it  has  a  basic \nfinancial and accounting policy that adopts accrual accounting, double-entry bookkeeping, and \nother generally accepted accounting principles and conventions in compliance with national \nstandards. Capacity development under the ongoing Talimarjan Power Project is strengthening \nUzbekenergo\u2019s  financial  management  capacity  and  accounting  and  auditing  practices \n(footnote 6). \n \n28.  Taking into account the relatively lengthy procurement process under the first two ADB \nloans, Uzbekenergo\u2019s procurement capacity was reassessed. Although Uzbekenergo is gaining \nexperience  in  working  with  ADB,  an  additional  Special  Project  Implementation  and \nAdministration  Seminar  was  conducted  to  increase  the  PMU\u2019s  procurement  capacity.  The \nseminar was tailor-made, focusing on Uzbekenergo\u2019s needs, with emphasis on ADB policies \nand  procedures  on  consultant  recruitment  and  procurement  of  goods  and  works  that  are \nrelevant for the project. Smooth project implementation requires (i) that the PMU has direct \naccess to Uzbekenergo\u2019s management for efficient decision making, (ii) staffing of the PMU with \ncompetent specialists, and (iii) an international consultant to assist in procurement and related \nactivities. Procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time \nto time), including the use of standard bidding documents. Initially, an international consultant \nunder ADB project preparatory technical assistance will help Uzbekenergo prepare bidding \ndocuments, conduct bid evaluation, negotiate contracts, and recruit consultants. The consultant \nwill also provide on-the-job training. Subsequently, the project implementation consultants will \nprovide support to the PMU in procurement management. An early warning system will be \nestablished to ensure timely procurement and project implementation.  \n  \n ", "8 \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and Uzbekenergo. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 9). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n30.  The project will increase access to a more reliable form of electricity for people living in \nFergana Valley. The region will become a better place that provides more labor-based wage \nemployment opportunities, as industry will have the necessary inducement to relocate to the \nFergana.  This  will  prevent  the  need  for  labor  to  move  elsewhere  to  Commonwealth  of \nIndependent States countries, especially the Russian Federation, in search of non-agriculture-\nbased  wage  labor  employment  opportunities.  Andijon,  with  9%  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  population, \ncurrently  produces  21.5%  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  non-agriculture-based  outputs,  but  Fergana  and \nNamangan are less industrialized and more rural. This has an obvious beneficial social impact \non such households because many adult income-earners, especially males, are not required to \nbe absent from households for an extended period of time. Such households are able to retain \nor enhance their social capital in ways not formerly possible where adult household members \nare typically absent because of lack of local employment opportunities. \n \nE.  Safeguards  \n \n1.  Environmental Assessment \n \n31.  Environmental categorization of the project is B in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). An initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared, and potential \naffected people were consulted. Uzbekenergo cleared the IEE report and it was disclosed via \nADB\u2019s  website  on  1  August  2012.  The  transmission  lines  run  through  areas  with  low \nenvironmental sensitivities. No significant or irreversible impacts are expected with the operation \nof the new lines. There will be some temporary impacts during the construction phase, but \nmitigation measures have been developed. The environmental management plan has also been \nprepared as part of the IEE to ensure that adequate resources are allocated to handle the \nimpact. Mitigation measures could be included as part of the construction costs. Implementation \nof the environmental management plan will be recorded and reported through a project quarterly \nreport, and a stand-alone environmental monitoring report will be submitted annually to ADB. \nPMU  staff  has  been  involved  in  similar  projects  financed  by  other  multilateral  financial \ninstitutions  and  they  have  sufficient  capacity  to  manage  the  environmental  safeguards. \nEnvironmental specialists of the implementation consultants will provide additional support to \nthe PMU. \n \n  2.  Social Assessment \n \n32.  The project is categorized C for indigenous peoples safeguard. The field social survey \nfound no ethnic minority, as described in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement 2009, involved or \naffected by the project. The project is category B for involuntary resettlement safeguard. A land \nacquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) for the transmission lines has been prepared based \non the preliminary design of the project, in close consultation with affected households. A \ndetailed socioeconomic survey was carried out. Uzbekenergo submitted the LARP to ADB and it \nwas disclosed via ADB\u2019s website on 1 August 2012. Uzbekenergo will update the LARP after \nfinalizing the detailed design and submit it to ADB for approval. \n \n ", "9 \n33.  The  project  will  permanently  acquire  21.9  hectares  (ha),12 of  which  11.7  ha  is \ngovernment unallocated land. About 346.2 ha will be temporarily acquired for use during the \nconstruction period, of which 212.8 ha is government unallocated land. Affected households \ntotal 145, with 1,003 affected people. Seventeen affected households or 109 affected people will \nlose shelter and be relocated as much as possible in the immediate vicinity of their original \nhomes. Almost all affected households will be affected by two impacts\u2014land and crops; only \none affected household will lose almost 10% of its productive land. The total compensation for \nland acquisition, temporary and permanent, will be about $2 million.  \n \n34.  Monitoring the implementation of LARP will be done on a quarterly basis and the report \nwill be submitted to ADB. The report will include the number of affected households who were \npaid compensation, monetary value of paid compensation, and location where compensation \nhas been completely executed and demolition of structures, if any. The report on completion of \nLARP implementation, especially on payment of compensation, should be submitted to ADB \nprior to commencement of any field works for the transmission line. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n35.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.13 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nCivil works and hydro isolation for concrete structures in  Use bitumen and specialized cloth wrap-up for concrete \nhigh mountain terrain  structure hydro isolation.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n36.  The government and Uzbekenergo have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n                                                \n12 Aside from land acquired for the transmission line, 25 ha have been used as a temporary office and storage as well \nas the main base camp of all construction works. This will later be used for Namangan substation. The due \ndiligence for these 25 ha found that this land had been acquired from reserved local government land in 2011. No \nimpact related with acquisition of this land, as described in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, and no third party \nclaim are expected since the land was part of the government\u2019s reserved land. \n13 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n37.  The government and Uzbekenergo have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreements and project agreement. \n \n38.  As a condition for disbursement after the proposed ADB loans are declared effective, \nsubsidiary loan agreements for the relending of the ADB loans to Uzbekenergo, in form and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, shall have been signed and become effective in accordance with \nthe terms. \n \nV.
