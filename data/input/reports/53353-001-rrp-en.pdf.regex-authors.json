THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Competitive and Inclusive Agriculture Development Program, and \n(ii) a proposed policy-based loan (PBL) to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 1 of the \nCompetitive and Inclusive Agriculture Development Program. \n \n2.  In line with the Philippine Development Plan (PDP), 2017\u22122022, the program aims to \nreduce income inequality by expanding economic opportunities in agriculture.1 The program will \nsupport the government\u2019s effort to increase competitiveness and inclusiveness of the agriculture \nsector by (i) implementing agricultural trade policy and regulatory reforms, (ii) enhancing public \nservices and finance for the sector, and (iii) increasing social protection to rural families who may \nbe affected by the reforms. The program is included in the country operations business plan for \nthe Philippines, 2020\u20132022 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).2 The program is consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and country partnership strategy for the Philippines, 2018\u20132023.3 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Prior to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the Philippines presented very \nstrong economic performance with an average annual economic growth rate of 6.4% from 2010 \nto 2019.4 This sustained high economic growth contributed to a reduction in the national poverty \nrate from 23.3% in 2015 to 16.6% in 2018.5 However, during 2010\u20132018, the Philippines\u2019 \nagriculture sector growth was stagnant with annual growth averaging  1.3%, which was lower than \nthat of Indonesia (3.9%), Viet Nam (2.7%), and Cambodia (2.0%).6 The poor sector performance \nhas been the result of decades of underinvestment, policy distortions, uncertainties linked to the \nimplementation of agrarian reform, and periodic extreme weather events. It has significantly \nimpacted people\u2019s livelihoods and rural poverty. First, it has resulted in low incomes for farmers \nand  the  majority  of  the  rural  population,  which  has  impeded  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to \nsignificantly reduce rural poverty. The rural poverty rate remains high at 24.5% while national \npoverty incidence has declined (paras. 4, 12). Second, it has pushed up rice prices about 30% \nhigher than global prices. As rice accounts for 50% of total household calorie intake in the country, \nthe high domestic rice prices (i) hurt poor households with high food expenses in proportion to \ntheir total expenses, and (ii) threaten food security. \n \n4.  Impact of COVID-19. These development challenges have been compounded by the \nCOVID-19  pandemic,  which  has  serious  economic  and  social  consequences.  Measures to \ncontain the spread of the virus have resulted in job losses and reduction in household incomes.  \nAccording to ADB estimates, the unemployment rate in Luzon, which represents about 50.0% of \nthe country\u2019s population and 70.0% of economic activity, could peak at 22.0% in the second \n \n1  Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2017.

Poverty incidence is estimated to rise to 20.7% in 2020 \nfrom 16.6% in 2018, threatening to reverse the gains made on this front with 5.5 million more \nFilipinos falling into poverty. Disruptions in the food supply chain because of the community \nquarantine have severely affected the poorest citizens, including farmers and fisherfolk. Playing \na pivotal role in poverty reduction and ensuring food security, agriculture is among the priority \nareas for reforms in the government\u2019s COVID-19 economic recovery program. \n \n5.  Development constraints. The Government of the Philippines recognizes the need for \ncompetitive and inclusive agricultural development. However, this has been hampered largely by \n(i) decades of protective policies and regulations for agricultural trade, (ii) inadequate provision of \npublic services and finance for agricultural development, and (iii) insufficient social protection of \nrural families. \n \n6.  Policy and regulatory barriers to international and domestic trade of agricultural \nproducts. Agricultural policy over the past few decades has prioritized food (particularly rice) self-\nsufficiency by protecting domestic producers through import restrictions (including quantitative \nrestrictions on rice imports).8 These protective policies make domestic rice prices artificially higher \nthan world prices, giving incentives for farmers to continue with basic rice production. This has \nlimited their potential to move up the value chain, and precludes them from diversifying into higher-\nvalue crops and earning higher income.9 The protective rice trade is one of the root causes of the \nslow  progress  in  agriculture  diversification  and  commercialization,  resulting  in  low  sector \nproductivity and low farm incomes.10 \n \n7.  Under the protective trade regime, the National Food Authority (NFA) controls rice imports \nthrough the issuance of licenses for importers, wholesalers, retailers, and rice mills operating in \nthe domestic market.11 To protect farmers, the NFA also buys domestic paddy at higher prices; \nmills, distributes, and sells most of the rice at lower-than-market prices; and keeps the rest for \nemergency stock. However, this procurement operation is poorly targeted and benefits only few \nfarmers, as the NFA\u2019s operation covers only 1% of domestic production.12 Further, the NFA\u2019s \nfinancially inviable operation translates into substantial liabilities (\u20b1169.7 billion in 2017) which \nhas considerable national budgetary implications.13 \n \n7  ADB. 2020.

Paris. \n9  Estimates of the effective rates of protection measure the net protection received by domestic producers from the \nprotection of their outputs and the penalty from protection of their inputs. In 2004 (the latest estimates available), the \naverage effective rates of protection in the Philippines were 14.2% for agriculture, 10.0% for manufacturing, and \n18.1% for importable agricultural products (indicating protection afforded to agriculture, with a relatively high effective \nrate of protection for rice).

High import tariffs and quantitative restrictions on rice imports, alongside the NFA\u2019s near-\nmonopoly on rice trade, have resulted in inadequate rice supply and a serious distortion in the \ndomestic rice market. Additionally, administrative trade barriers, such as the issuance of sanitary \nand phytosanitary certificates for import, and inadequate interagency coordination among trade \nregulatory agencies also result in a high level of protection in agriculture. \n \n9.  Uncertain agricultural land ownership. Piecemeal and incomplete agrarian reforms \nhave led to uncertainties in agricultural land ownership and titles.14 The uncertainties have been \npartly caused by restrictions imposed by the Public Land Act enacted in 1936.15 The restrictions \ncomprise (i) prohibition on the sale and mortgaging of land within the first 5 years of the patent \ngrants; (ii) possible buy back of the land titles by original landowners within a 5-year period; and \n(iii) prohibition on corporations, associations, or partnerships acquiring or owning land. Uncertain \nland ownership prevents farmers from using their land as collateral to access credit. It also \nimpedes agricultural land transfer among farmers and agriculture-based corporations. Uncertain \nland ownership results in creating disincentives for landowners to invest in their own land, which \nleads to low agriculture productivity and poor sector performance. These restrictions inadvertently \nencourage underpriced informal land transactions, leading to losses in tax revenue. Women also \nremain at the margins of agricultural land ownership, comprising about 30% of total agrarian \nreform beneficiaries with individual land titles during 2000\u20132016.16 \n \n10.  Ineffective water  resources  management.  A  complex  institutional  setup  and  poor \ncoordination and planning for water resources management cause inadequate irrigation services \nand uncontrolled flood risks, eroding agricultural productivity. There are more than 30 government \nagencies managing water resources and utilization in the Philippines, operating without an \neffective coordination mechanism. This results in substantial inefficiencies in the development \nand operation of irrigation systems and low irrigation coverage.17 To tackle increasingly intense \nand frequent floods, the government needs to prepare flood risk management master plans \n(FRMMPs) for major river basins. \n \n11.  Limited  public  financing  and  provision  of  agriculture  extension  services. \nUncoordinated arrangements for public financing and fragmented institutional setup for extension \nservices undermine support to agriculture. There are various government programs and credit \nschemes to support agriculture, with a focus on rice production. However, there is a lack of overall \nplanning  and  coordination  of  those  programs.  Farm  extension  services  are  not  effectively \ndelivered because of the structural disconnect between the Department of Agriculture and local \n \n14 Presidential Decree No. 2 issued on 26 September 1972 proclaimed the entire country as a land reform area, and \nsimultaneously the Agrarian Reform Program was decreed. On 15 June 1988, the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform \nLaw was enacted, and the government aims at distributing the targeted 5.43 million hectares (ha) of agricultural lands \nto landless farmers and farm workers under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (1988\u20132008) and the \nComprehensive Agrarian Reform Program Extension with Reforms (2009\u2212ongoing). During 1972\u20132019, cumulative \nland distribution and registration totaled 4.82 million hectares (88.8% of the targeted area) and the total number of \nagrarian reform beneficiaries reached 2,887,914.

This hinders farmers from adopting modern seed varieties, modern farming \ntechnologies and practices, and farm mechanization. This is particularly aggravated for female \nfarmers, as they are not recognized as farmers because of social and cultural norms. Despite \ntheir primary role in the family\u2019s food security, only 23% of female farmers have access to \nextension services and only 14% of them receive financial assistance.18 \n \n12.  Persistent rural poverty and food insecurity. Despite recent strong economic growth, \nannual incomes of households engaged in agriculture, forestry, and fishery are still low, leading \nto high rural poverty. While the rural poverty rate has declined to 24.5% in 2018 from 34.0% in \n2015, it remains substantially high.19 Poverty is also directly linked to malnutrition and stunting in \nchildren.  The  2018  Expanded  National  Nutrition  Survey  showed  that  undernutrition  rates \nremained very high and stunting stood at 30% among children under 5, affecting 3.5 million \nchildren of the 11.7 million aged 0\u20135 years.20 Chronic malnutrition or stunting is strongly linked \nwith high rates of disease and premature death. It also has adverse effects on crucial stages of \nchild development, leading to cognitive and behavioral deficits, learning disabilities, and ultimately \nan uncompetitive and suboptimal labor force. The Philippines is lagging behind other Southeast \nAsian countries such as Thailand and Viet Nam in terms of making the shift from low-value \nagricultural commodities to products that can attract higher returns and improve farmer incomes. \nThis is largely because of distortive policies favoring low-value commodities, particularly rice. \nMoreover, rice is the largest expenditure item in the food basket for poor Filipinos. Among the \npoorest 20% of households, including households headed by women, rice constitutes over 19% \nof their total expenditure.21 Low farm incomes together with high rice prices reduce disposable \nincome of poor households for other necessities, including human capital investments such as \neducation and health care, that are critical for future employment prospects. \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n13.  Government reform agenda. The PDP promotes inclusive growth and sets a strategic \ntarget for the Philippines to reach upper middle-income status by 2022. To maximize the inclusive \ngrowth potential of agriculture, the PDP lays out strategies to raise sector productivity and \ncompetitiveness. Prior to the onset of COVID-19, the government had set the following targets to \nbe achieved during 2016\u20132022: annual real gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 7%\u20138%, per \ncapita GDP increase from $3,550 to $5,000, and poverty rate reduction from 21.6% to 14.0%. To \naccomplish inclusive growth, the government has emphasized agriculture sector development, \nbecause the sector is pivotal in generating employment for one-fourth of the country\u2019s labor force \nthat is dependent on agriculture, including women, thereby reducing poverty and inequality for \nthree-fourths of the poor who are in rural areas. Female workers account for 22% of the \nagricultural labor force.22 The sector also provides raw materials to the manufacturing and \nservices sectors, generating higher-paying and more stable job opportunities through forward \nlinkages. \n \n18 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, International Fund for Agricultural Development, United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), World Food Programme, and World Health Organization. 2018.

Proposed  policy  reforms.  The  reform  areas  are  (i)  agricultural  trade  policy  and \nregulatory  framework  improved,  (ii)  public  services  and  finance  for  the  agriculture  sector \nenhanced, and (iii) social protection to rural families increased. The program will comprise two \nsubprograms. Subprogram 1 largely addresses constraints in the enabling environment and has \nprovided much-needed government-led direction and planning to support sustainable agriculture \nproductivity growth in the long term. Subprogram 2 will continue effective implementation of these \nreforms to further boost competitiveness and expand economic opportunities for farmers, crucial \nto accomplishing inclusive growth. A programmatic approach gives a flexible and effective way of \ntackling complex policy and institutional reforms to increase agricultural competitiveness. Under \nsubprogram 1, the government has accomplished 13 policy actions, including 5 policy triggers \nand 8 policy milestones. Subprogram 2 comprises 15 policy actions, of which 6 are policy triggers \nand 9 are policy milestones. \n \n15.  Reform Area 1: Agricultural trade policy and regulatory framework. Under this policy \nreform area, the government has liberalized and facilitated rice trade to make sufficient rice \navailable at affordable prices in the domestic market and to be a catalyst for resources to diversify \nproduction and shift to higher-value agricultural products. This reform area will make agricultural \nproducts and input markets more flexible and responsive to price signals. Under subprogram 1, \nthe government enacted the Rice Tariffication Law (RTL), 2019 and adopted its implementing \nrules and regulations. The RTL removed (i) quantitative restrictions on rice imports and replaced \nthem with a pure tariff system, and (ii) the NFA\u2019s regulatory powers and commercial functions \nover the domestic and international trade of rice and other grains.23 The government also \nfacilitated trade of non-rice agricultural products by removing administrative barriers for their \nimport, and it rolled out an online trade facilitation portal (TradeNet) with the Department of \nAgriculture  as  a  key  regulatory  agency.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  issue \nimplementing rules of the NFA\u2019s buffer stock management to better cope with any emergency \nsituations, including infectious disease outbreaks. \n \n16.  Reform Area 2: Public services and finance for the agriculture sector. Under this \npolicy reform area, the government has improved (i) land and water resources use planning and \nmanagement, which are key production factors for agriculture; (ii) financing to make the Philippine \nrice industry competitive under the liberalized trade regime; and (iii) access and quality of \nextension services. \n \n17.  Under subprogram 1, the government enacted the Agricultural Free Patent Reform Act, \n2019 to retroactively remove the restrictions on the sale and transfer of agricultural land to \nfacilitate efficient and effective utilization of land as an asset. The government (i) took steps to \ncreate the Department of Water Resources (DWR) as a significant institutional reform aiming to \ncentralize management of water resources; (ii) formulated and adopted the National Irrigation \nMaster Plan (NIMP) 24 for efficient and sustainable planning, and management of irrigation; and \n(iii) developed FRMMPs for major river basins. \n18.  The  government  set  up  the  Rice  Competitiveness  Enhancement  Fund  (RCEF)  to \nstrengthen the rice industry in 57 rice-competitive provinces during 2019\u20132024 in accordance with \nthe Philippine Rice Industry Roadmap (footnote 10). The RCEF provides an annual budget of \u20b110 \nbillion from increased tariff revenue from rice imports for four primary programs: (i) rice farm \nmachineries and equipment (\u20b15 billion); (ii) rice seed development, propagation, and promotion \n \n23 The import tariff rates are set for ASEAN countries at 35% and for non-ASEAN countries at 40% within the minimum \naccess volume of 350,000 metric tons and 180% for over the minimum access volume. \n24 Government of the Philippines, National Irrigation Administration.

Manila. \nUnpublished. \n ", "6 \n(\u20b13 billion); (iii) expanded rice credit assistance (\u20b11 billion); and (iv) rice extension services (\u20b11 \nbillion). If the rice tariff revenue goes beyond the \u20b110 billion, the RCEF will further support the \nfollowing: (i) rice farmer financial assistance, (ii) titling of agricultural rice lands, (iii) an expanded \ncrop insurance program on rice, and (iv) a crop diversification program. To improve the targeting \nof RCEF programs, the government started updating the Registry System for Basic Sectors in \nAgriculture (RSBSA) to identify the beneficiary farmers, farmworkers, and their dependents.  \n \n19.  Subprogram 2 will help consolidate and solidify these reforms by (i) transforming the \nNational Water Resources Board into the National Water Management Council to streamline \nwater resources management as a provisional measure towards the establishment of the DWR, \nand (ii) allocating national budget to implement priority investment projects under the NIMP and \nthe FRMMPs. The government will (i) develop a rice fund impact monitoring system to assess the \nimpact of the RCEF programs on farm productivity and income; (ii) complete updating of the \nRSBSA; (iii) develop a national agriculture and fisheries modernization and industrialization plan \nto map out a detailed sector strategy; and (iv) develop a pilot project to establish provincial \nagricultural and fishery extension centers to strengthen local government units\u2019 extension services \nfor farmers, with measures to promote women\u2019s meaningful participation and benefits. \n \n20.  Reform Area 3: Social protection to rural families affected by the reforms. There are \ntwo development objectives under this policy reform area: (i) mitigate the adverse impacts of the \nRTL on potential losers from the reforms, such as smallholder rice farmers, as well as the \nunforeseen impact of COVID-19 on rural communities, and (ii) expand targeted social assistance \nprograms to rural communities including national feeding program to tackle persistent malnutrition \nand  stunting  among  children  and  rural  poverty.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government \n(i) established unconditional cash transfer programs for smallholder rice farmers who were most \naffected by low farmgate rice prices as a result of the RTL, and (ii) allocated \u20b13 billion under the \nRice Farmer Financial Assistance Program and an additional \u20b13 billion under the Financial \nSubsidy to Rice Farmers Program. \n \n21.  The  government  also  established  (i)  the  Expanded  Survival  and  Recovery  (SURE) \nAssistance Program for Rice Farmers (SURE Aid, which is one of the SURE assistance programs) \nto issue no-collateral, interest-free loans totaling \u20b12.5 billion to 164,274 small rice farmers              \n(1 hectare [ha] or less), of which about 45% are female; and (ii) the SURE COVID-19 Program \nwith an additional \u20b12.5 billion to provide no-collateral, interest-free loans to small farmers and \nfisherfolk (3 ha or less) and agri- and fishery-based micro and small enterprises affected by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The government institutionalized through legislation a national feeding \nprogram for undernourished children in public day care, kindergartens, and elementary schools \nto address high rates of child malnutrition and stunting rates, improving nutritional status of \nchildren. \n \n22.  Under subprogram 2, the government will (i) provide an additional \u20b12.5 billion for SURE \nassistance programs as part of emergency support for vulnerable groups, (ii) implement a national \nfeeding program, and (iii) commence planning for a nutritional food program for poor pregnant \nwomen as part of its zero-hunger agenda to address malnutrition and stunting in newly born \nbabies.

ADB experience in the agriculture, natural resources, and rural development sector. \nADB has had a long engagement in the Philippines agriculture, natural resources, and rural \ndevelopment (ANR) sector through policy advice and investment projects. Through the Grains \nSector Development Program (2000 2004), ADB developed an integrated package of policy and \ninstitutional reforms linked to agriculture sector investment loans and technical assistance (TA).25 \nThese included trade policy reforms\u2212 to the rice sector and reforms to the NFA. However, the \nprogram was canceled in 2003 because of several reasons. First, the short period of the second \ntranche (9 months after effectiveness) required strong ongoing political support to meet timing \n \n25 ADB. 1999.

Second, the counterpart funding \nrequirements were substantial in the context of the Philippines budgetary constraints following \nthe Asia financial crisis. Third, disbursements under the investment loan were linked to the \nprogram  loan  conditions.  When  the  program  loan  failed  to  meet  its  policy  objectives,  the \ninvestment loan also failed. ADB supported agricultural land reform through the Agrarian Reform \nCommunities Project, phases 1 and 2 (1999 2019) and irrigation investments through the Second \nIrrigation Systems Improvement Project (1995 2006) and the Southern Philippines Irrigation \nSector Project (1998 2011).26 Most recent\u2212ly, ADB supported the preparation of FRMMPs for \nmajor  river  basins  through  the  ongoing  Infra\u2212structure  Preparation  and  Innovation  Facility \n(2017 2021).27 The p\u2212roposed program lays out the policy foundations for ADB\u2019s future investment \nprojects and programs in the ANR sector (Figure). \n  \u2212\n \n \n24.

The program provides an overarching framework \nfor ADB\u2019s investment projects and TA in the ANR sector under the current country partnership \nstrategy.  ADB  provided  the  government  with  critical  policy  advisory  support  to  draft  the \nimplementing  rules  and  regulations  of  the  RTL.  These  include  the  necessary  institutional \narrangements  that  will  enhance  competitiveness,  ensure  the  country\u2019s  smooth  and  timely \ntransition to a new rice production and trading regime, and institute safety nets to assist local \nfarmers.

To further reduce hunger, the government created \nthe Inter-Agency Task Force on Zero Hunger on 10 January 2020, and ADB is advising the \ngovernment on the design of a nutritional food program for poor pregnant women as part of its \nzero-hunger agenda. \n \n25.  Lessons. The program was designed based on relevant lessons from ADB\u2019s experience, \nparticularly the Grains Sector Development Program whose objectives are similar to those of the \nPBL,28 as well as evaluation findings on the special study on PBLs.29 These lessons are as \nfollows: \n \n(i)  Agriculture reforms are complex, have a medium- to long-term gestation period, \nand require proper sequencing. Programs should exhibit sufficient flexibility to \naccommodate a medium- to long-term development horizon and the inevitable \nchanges that occur when dealing with complex reform areas. \n(ii)  Strong  high-level  government  resolve  and  ownership  are  key  to  successful \nimplementation of reforms. \n(iii)  Policy reforms create winners and losers, and adverse impacts on the losers \nshould  be  mitigated  and  supplemented  with  expansion  of  social  assistance \nprograms to vulnerable rural families and communities. \n(iv)  A programmatic approach and PBL will help to promote structural policy reforms \nin the sector and support downstream investment projects in irrigation, flood risk \nmanagement,  and  agribusiness  in  the  pipeline.  The  \u201cOne  ADB  approach\u201d, \ninvolving extensive coordination within ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department and \nacross ADB\u2019s departments, ensures an appropriate program design, the scope of \nwhich goes beyond the agriculture sector. \n \n26.  Development  coordination.  Major  development  partners  in  the  ANR  sector  in  the \nPhilippines include the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Japan International \nCooperation  Agency,  Korea  International  Cooperation  Agency,  and  World  Bank.  Strong \ndevelopment coordination and effective and efficient use of resources provided by development \npartners are imperative for the program. ADB will continue communicating with key development \npartners to gather lessons from partner programs and projects and further improve the program\u2019s \nimpact. \n \n27.  ADB has coordinated closely with the International Monetary Fund on macroeconomic \nconditions and prospects in the Philippines. The International Monetary Fund has provided an \nassessment  letter  for  the  program.  The  government  had  demonstrated  a  sound  record  of \nmacroeconomic management before the COVID-19 crisis. The economy expanded by 6.4% on \naverage during 2010\u20132019. Inflation had been carefully managed and was only 2.5% in 2019. \n \n28 ADB. 2007. Completion Report: Grains Sector Development Program in the Philippines. Manila.

With economic policies mitigating the impact of COVID-19 and \nan acceleration in public investment, growth is projected to rebound to 6.5% in 2021.30 \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n28.  Economic impact of the program. The program reforms the agriculture sector with a \nspecific focus on dismantling trade protection in the rice sector. Overall, through reforms to move \ntoward market-based rice prices the program is expected to facilitate a transition from rice \nproduction to higher value-added crops supported by enabling reforms to the management and \nutilization of key production factors, such as land and water resources, and better extension \nservices and targeted funding to the sector. The key effect of the program is increased agricultural \ncompetitiveness and inclusiveness. Reform area 1 will expose the rice sector to international \ncompetition; reform area 2 will enhance its competitiveness; and reform area 3 will enhance its \ninclusiveness. The program will increase income opportunities in the agriculture sector as well as \nin the industry and services sectors through backward and forward linkages. The assessment of \nthe economic impact of the program focused on the impact of rice trade liberalization (reform area \n1) since the economic impact of the program is expected to result substantially from the enactment \nof the RTL in 2019. \n \n29.  The welfare impact of the rice trade liberalization is estimated at $21 billion during \n2020\u22122040.31 This trade policy reform will benefit all rice consumers in the Philippines (i.e., nearly \nthe entire population) through reduced retail rice prices, making them as the winners of the reform. \nOn the other hand, it will hurt most of the about 2 million rice farmers who sell rice to markets \nthrough reduced farmgate prices, making them as the losers of the reform. The consumer surplus \nis estimated at $50.7 billion. Per capita rice consumption is expected to increase by 6.3% to 120 \nkilograms per year by 2025 and to fall to 117 kilograms per year by 2040, and the number of \nmalnourished children is expected to decline from 3.0 million in 2015 to 2.4 million by 2040. On \nthe other hand, the loss in producer surplus is estimated at $29.7 billion, which is expected to be \npartly mitigated by the RCEF programs under reform area 2. Some farmers are expected to shift \nto high-value crops, such as vegetables and fruits. The RCEF will be financed by the rice tariff \nrevenue, which is expected to increase from $487 million in 2020 to $640 million in 2040. The \nRCEF programs, irrigation expansion, and agricultural extension programs are expected to \ngenerate a producer surplus of $7.3 billion. Further, under reform area 3, the program will include \nincome distributive benefits, such as income transfers to marginal rice farmers affected by the \nreforms and transfers to rural families to tackle long-term rural poverty, including dimensions such \nas malnutrition and stunting of children residing in rural communities. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n30.  The government has requested a regular loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 1.32 The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \n \n30 ADB. 2020.

Based on the annuity repayment \nmethod, the average maturity is 12.1 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \nThe indicative loan amount for subprogram 2 is $400 million, which will be funded from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources. The annual budget deficit was originally programmed at 3.2% of GDP \nin 2020 compared to 3.4% of GDP deficit in 2019. With significantly lower revenues because of \nthe economic contraction and higher spending to respond to the impacts of COVID-19, the deficit \nis expected to widen to 8.4% of GDP in 2020. As such, the financing requirement of the \ngovernment is expected to reach record levels at  \u20b12.9 trillion with a financing mix of 74% from \ndomestic borrowing and 26% from foreign borrowing.33 The loan size of subprogram 1 reflects \nthe government\u2019s total financing needs, the strength of the program, and its economic benefits. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n31.  The Department of Finance (DOF) is the executing agency. The implementing agencies \nare the National Economic and Development Authority, the Department of Agriculture, the \nDepartment  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources,  the  Department  of  Public  Works  and \nHighways, the Department of Social Welfare and Development, and the National Irrigation \nAdministration. A steering committee chaired by the DOF with the implementing agencies as \nmembers will oversee the program\u2019s implementation. The implementation period is May 2018\u2013\nApril 2020 for subprogram 1 and May 2020\u2013April 2022 for subprogram 2. The loan proceeds will \nbe withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n32.  Safeguards.  The  program  is  classified  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The potential environmental and social impacts of the proposed policy reforms have been \nassessed.34 No policy action will entail any involuntary resettlement or adversely affect indigenous \npeoples or the environment. Indigenous peoples will benefit from the program (e.g., access to \nfinance,  food  security,  and  flood  risk  mitigation).  There  will  be  no  differential  impacts  on \nindigenous peoples. \n \n33.  Climate change. The Philippines is highly vulnerable to climate change. The weak \nperformance of the crop subsector, the largest subsector in agriculture, is partly attributed to its \nvulnerability to extreme weather events (e.g., droughts and typhoons). The program will contribute \nto strengthening climate resilience of the agriculture and fishery sectors and reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions. Climate resilience will be realized by (i) improving water resources management \nthrough the legislation related to establishing the DWR, (ii) ensuring effective implementation of \nthe climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction and management measures laid out by \nthe FRMMP and NIMP, (iii) strengthening flood risk management, and (iv) promoting climate-\nresilient seed development and distribution under the RCEF. Climate mitigation will be realized \nby reducing (i) energy use as a result of improved water resources planning and utilization, \n(ii) greenhouse gas emission from crop diversification, and (iii) food loss and water use as a result \nof farmers\u2019 investment in on-farm water management and post-harvest processing equipment and \nfacilities from credit assistance under the RCEF.35 The total estimated climate financing is $52.31 \n \n33 Government of the Philippines, Department of Finance. 2020.

Poverty and social. The country\u2019s overall poverty rate decreased from 23.3% in 2015 to \n16.6% in 2018. The short-term impact of the program is twofold. First, smallholder farmers will \nhave increased access to extension services, credit, and other support programs (including farm \nmechanization), which will help lift productivity and incomes over the medium to long term. Further, \nthe RTL has already pushed down domestic rice prices by as much as 22%, which has put a \ndownward pressure to the national inflation rate, benefiting poor consumers.37 Second, with falling \nrice prices, smallholder rice farmers, especially in marginal lands, will be adversely affected. The \nprogram\u2019s extension of social assistance to vulnerable communities will help mitigate these \neffects. In the longer term, part of labor and capital engaged in basic rice farming will be relocated \nto more profitable and diversified agricultural activities including farming with improved and high-\nquality rice varieties as the basic rice farming becomes less profitable. The COVID-19 pandemic \nhas started having an adverse impact on poverty in the short term because of (i) loss of incomes \nand livelihood, especially for informal sector workers; (ii) disruption of trade and markets affecting \nsmall-scale entrepreneurs and food producers, including farmers; (iii) immense increase in \npersonal debt; and (iv) illnesses or deaths of primary income earners in families. The financial \nrelief and extension of social assistance programs will help alleviate these effects. \n \n35.  Gender. Subprogram 1 is categorized some gender elements at entry. The government \nhas accomplished five policy actions with gender considerations under subprogram 1. The \nprogram will promote (i) the incorporation of gender equality in water resources planning, policy \nformulation, and management by the DWR (which is being proposed by the government) through \nconsultations with all stakeholders, including women, the elderly, and people with disabilities; \n(ii) the inclusion of gender analyses in the NIMP and  FRMMPs; (iii) the collection of sex-\ndisaggregated data for the RSBSA; and (iv) the provision of interest-free loans to smallholder rice \nfarmers, of which about 45% are female, under SURE Aid. \n \n36.  Subprogram 2 is expected to achieve effective gender mainstreaming through (i) the \ncompliance  of  the  DWR\u2019s  operation  with  the  gender  and  development  framework,  (ii)  the \nintegration  of  gender  considerations  in  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  forthcoming \ninvestment projects under the NIMP and FRMMPs, (iii) the inclusion of gender analyses in \nFRMMPs for other priority river basins, (iv) the inclusion of gender impact assessment in the \nevaluation of the RCEF programs, (v) the targeting of female farmer beneficiaries of the SURE \nassistance programs, (vi) at least 30% participation by female family members in the pilot \nprovincial agricultural and fisheries extension system, and (vii) the commencement of planning \nfor a nutritional program for poor pregnant women as part of the government\u2019s zero-hunger \nagenda. \n \n37.  Governance. Public financial management (PFM) reforms implemented during 2011\u2013\n2016  strengthened  fiscal  discipline  and  allocative  and  technical  efficiency,  while  improving \ntransparency and citizen empowerment. A 2016 public expenditure and financial accountability \nassessment found that three of the seven core PFM areas had improved: policy-based budgeting, \ntransparency, and asset\u2013liability management.38 The government has set an aggressive reform \nagenda to promote effective and honest governance and to create an enabling environment for \n \n36 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
