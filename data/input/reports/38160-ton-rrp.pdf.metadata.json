An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  (EARP)  have \nbeen prepared. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  an  efficient  and  well-maintained  primary \nroad  network,  all-weather  roads  to  low-income  and  low-lying \nresidential  areas,  well-maintained  and \nfunctional  drainage \nsystems,  effective  trunk  drainage  systems,  and  groundwater \nquality  monitoring  wells  to  assess  the  impacts  of  septic  tanks  on \nNuku'alofa\u2019s aquifers. It will facilitate improved urban planning and \nmanagement  capacity  as  well  as  infrastructure  maintenance \nprograms. \n \nIncreased demand for town allotments in urban areas has forced \nlow-lying  wetlands.  With  decreasing \nurban  expansion  onto \navailability  of  suitable \nland  and  a  rapidly  growing  urban \npopulation,  social  services  in  Nuku\u2019alofa  are  deteriorating  and \nroads and drainage need improvement. Frequent flooding in parts \nof  the  Nuku\u2019alofa  area  is  resulting  in  declining  health  and  social \nindicators. The Project will contribute to improved urban services. \n \nThe Project supports the Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy \nfor \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  Strategic  Development  Plan  8.  The  Project  is \ndirectly linked to ADB\u2019s key strategy to support the Government\u2019s \npolicy reform program for enhancing the public sector\u2019s efficiency \nand effectiveness, and it addresses deteriorating social conditions \nthrough general interventions. \n \nThe Project is expected to contribute to improved living standards \nin  Nuku'alofa,  including  for  low-income  residential  areas,  through \nproviding improved urban infrastructure. The Project will enhance \nurban sustainability by supporting implementation of planning and \nurban  management  legislation  as  well  as  urban  planning  and \nmanagement capacity building. \n\nto  basic  social  services  and \n\nimproved  access \n\n \n\n \n\n\fComponents and \nOutputs \n\n \nProject Investment Plan \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nii \n\n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nThe Project will provide for the following:  \n(i)  Roads.  Rehabilitating  approximately  10  kilometers  (km)  of \nprimary  roads,  including  road  drainage,  constructing  4  km  of \nall-weather  access  roads  in  low-income  residential  areas,  and \ndeveloping a preventive road maintenance program. \n(ii)  Drainage.  Rehabilitating  all  existing  drains  in  Nuku'alofa\u2019s \ncentral  business  areas  (CBA),  constructing  2.1  km  of  flood  relief \ndrains,  and  developing  a  stormwater  drainage  maintenance \nprogram. \n(iii)  Sanitation.  Constructing  eight  groundwater  monitoring  wells \nand monitoring of groundwater quality. \n(iv)  Candidate  subprojects.  Constructing  candidate  subprojects \nselected following the selection criteria set out in Appendix 6. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $14.22  million \nequivalent, including taxes and duties of $1.80 million equivalent. \n \n\n($ million) \n\nFinancing Source \nADB ADF Grant \nGovernment of Tonga \nTotal Project Cost \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund. \nSource: ADB. \n\nTotal \n11.30 \n2.92 \n14.22 \n\n% \n79.5 \n20.5 \n100.0 \n\n \n \nThe grant will be subject to such other terms and conditions as set \nforth in the grant and project agreements. \n \nThe  ADF  grant  of  $11.30  million  will  ease  the  macroeconomic \nimpact of the large financing requirements for urban infrastructure \ndevelopment  that  is  essential  for  economic  growth  and  social \ndevelopment. \n \n1 August 2008\u201331 December 2012 \n \n31 December 2012  \n\n \nThe Ministry of Works (MOW), as the Executing Agency (EA), will \nbe  responsible  for  implementing  the  Project.  A  project  steering \ncommittee  has  been  formed  and  will  provide  guidance  for  the \noverall  direction  of  the  Project.  The  Project  Steering  Committee \n(PSC) will consist of Minister of Finance (Chairperson); Minister of \nWorks;  Minister  of  Lands,  Survey  and  Natural  Resources; \nSecretary  of  Lands,  Survey  and  Natural  Resources;  Solicitor \nGeneral;  Secretary  of  Finance;  Director  of  Education;  Director  of \nHealth; and district officers of Kolomotu\u2019a and Kolofo\u2019ou. A project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will be established within the EA for day-\nto-day management and implementation of the Project. The PMU \nproject  manager  will  be  appointed  by  MOW.  The  PMU  will  (i) \nserve  as  the  secretariat  for  the  PSC,  (ii)  undertake  project \n\n\f \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nthrough \n\nmanagement, administration, and interagency coordination at the \nexecutive  level,  (iii)  maintain  project  accounts,  (iv)  oversee \nprocurement  procedures,  (v)  prepare  quarterly  project  progress \nupdates  and  other  reporting  requirements,  and  (vi)  prepare  the \nproject completion report to the Government and ADB. The PMU \nwill  be  supported  by  project  implementation  assistance  (PIA) \nconsultants  who  will  provide  project  planning,  design,  and \nmonitoring,  as  well  as  reporting  on  the  Project  and  cost  and \nquality control services. \n \nMinistry of Works (MOW) \n \nProcurement  under  the  Project  will  follow  ADB's  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  civil  works \nwill  be  procured \ninternational  competitive  bidding \nprocedures.  Procurement  of  specialized  equipment  for  road  and \ndrainage maintenance will use shopping procedures. \n \nAn international consulting firm (57 person-months of international \nconsulting  services  and  151  person-months  of  national)  will  be \nengaged  to  provide  PIA  consultants  to  assist  the  PMU  in  overall \nproject management and implementation. The consultants will be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  using  quality \nand cost-based selection procedures. \n \nThe  proposed  road  improvements  will  benefit  users  by  reducing \ntraffic congestion, saving travel time and costs, and making roads \nsafer  and  more  user-friendly  for  pedestrians.  In  particular,  the \nimprovements  include  sidewalks  to  provide  pedestrians  safer \npassage,  and  especially  during  times  of  heavy  rainfall.  Proposed \nimprovements to secondary and access roads in the low-lying and \nlow-income  areas  of  Popua  and  Sopu  will  provide  all-weather \nvehicular  access \nresidential  allotments.  Road  drainage \nimprovements  will  also  reduce  impacts  caused  by  road  flooding \nand improve surface water management generally. \n \nThe drainage and flood relief components will significantly reduce \nflooding  of  properties  and  roads  and  will  contribute  to  removing \nstagnant  surface  waters  that  are  a  potential  health  hazard,  and \nparticularly  in  low-lying,  lower-income  areas.  Severe  mosquito \ninfestation  is  common,  and  standing  water  is  usually  mixed  with \nwastewater  discharges.  That  provides  a  direct  contaminant \npathway to human receptors. \n \nThe Project will reduce poverty by lessening the financial burden \nof  repairing  flood  damage  to  properties  and  will  substantially \nimprove  the  access  and  habitability  of  low-income  residential \nareas,  thereby  providing  social  inclusiveness  and  equity  to  the \npoorest  communities  in  the  Nuku'alofa  area.

The \nimproved access road conditions will reduce vehicle operating and \nrepair costs.  \n \nThe  Project  design  takes  into  account  potential  risks  associated \nwith project management and with construction and repair quality. \nThe  PMU  will  undertake  capacity  building  to  strengthen  the \nGovernment\u2019s  capacity  to  meet  its  increased  responsibilities.  A \nteam  of  international  and  national  consultants  will  assist  with \nimplementation. \n \nTo  mitigate  risk  of  cost  overruns  resulting  from  underestimation \nand inflation, the PMU will (i) use conservative cost estimates, (ii) \nuse strict and effective contract conditions to ensure the Project is \ndelivered on time and on budget, (iii) develop measures to avoid \nuninsurable  risks  while  preparing  contract  documentation  to  limit \nthe  employer\u2019s  exposure,  and  (iv)  require  a  guarantee  by  the \ncontractor  for  1  year  following  works  to  ensure  construction \nquality. \n \n\nto \n\nsector \n\npromote \n\npartners \n\nin  regular  dialogue \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  institutional  reforms  could \nwane. ADB project and technical assistance (TA) review missions \nwill  engage \nto  maintain  support  and \ncommitment.  ADB  also  will  continue  working  closely  with \ngovernance \ndevelopment \nimprovements. \n \nAn  environment  and  social  unit  (ESU)  will  be  established  within \nthe  PMU  to  address  environmental  and  resettlement  issues. \nEnvironmental  impacts  will  be  monitored  through  construction \nsupervision,  and  mitigation  measures  will  be  implemented  in \naccordance  with  the  environmental  management  plan.  Project \ncomponents  shall  be  designed  to  minimize  resettlement  impacts. \nThe ESU will continuously consult with affected persons and other \nkey  stakeholders  throughout  the  Project\u2019s  implementation  to \nensure  community  concerns  and  grievances  with  respect  to  the \nProject are addressed. \n \nADB  will  provide  $700,000  equivalent  from  the  Japan  Special \nFund, funded by the Government of Japan as a TA grant. The TA \nhas  been  designed  to  build  capacity  for  implementing  the \nproposed urban planning and management system. The expected \nimpact of the TA will be improved standard of living within Tonga\u2019s \nurban  areas.  The  expected  outcomes  are  (i)  well-planned  and \nsustainable urban  development,  and  (ii)  a  safe  and  efficient  road \nsystem  within  Nuku'alofa.  The  TA  includes  four  components  and \nwill  provide  (i)  preparation  of  planning  legislation;  (ii)  capacity \nbuilding in the Planning and Urban Management Division (PUMD) \nfully-costed  urban  sector \nand  assistance \ndevelopment plan to identify and prioritize development needs for \nthe  sector  for  2009\u20132020;  (iii)  a  traffic  management  study  for \n\nto  develop  a \n\n\fNuku'alofa;  and  (iv)  capacity  building  within  MOW  for  planning, \ndesign,  supervision,  and  project  management  of \nroad \nmaintenance projects. \n\nv \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTONGA\nINTEGRATED URBAN DEVELOPMENT SECTOR PROJECT\n\nSopu\n\nHofoa Road\n\nHihifo Road\n\nVuna Road\n\nVaha'akolo Road\n\nVuna Wharf\n\nTONGATAPU GROUP\n\n175  10'Wo\n\n'Atata\n\nPolo'a\n\nAta\n\no\n21  00'S\n\nFafa\n\nOnevai\n\nFukave\n\nMotutapu\n\nNukunuku\n\nNUKU'ALOFA\n\nNavutoka\n\nKolonga\n\nTalafo'ou\n\nEueiki\n\nNiutoua\n\nHa'atafu\n\no\n21  00'S\n\nHa'avakatolo\n\nTe'ekiu\n\nHa'utu\n\nPea\n\nHouma\n\nUtulau\n\nVaini\n\nMu'a\n\nFatumu\n\nHa'asini and Hamula\n\nFua'amotu\n\n175  10'Wo\n\nQueen Salote Wharf\n\nVuna Road\n\nPopua\n\nV a h a'akolo R o a d\n\nTaufa'ahau Road\n\nAlaivahamama'o (by-pass) R\n\noad\n\nNational Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nMonitoring Well\n\nNational Road\n\nSecondary Access Road\n\nRoad Improvement\n\nDrainage Channel\n\nDrain Rehabilitation\n\n0\n7\n-\n2\n7\n4\n4\n \nH\nR\n\nN\n\n0.5\n\nKilometers\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Kingdom of Tonga for the Integrated Urban Development Sector Project. The report also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Urban  Planning  and  Management  System, \nand if the Board approves the grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \nwill approve the TA. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nUrbanization  is  only  a  relatively  recent  phenomenon  in  Tonga,  but  the  problems \n2. \nassociated  with  unplanned  and  uncontrolled  development  are  already  being  experienced. \nNuku'alofa, located on the island of Tongatapu, is the national capital and has a population of \n34,058.1 The population of Nuku'alofa represents 34% of the national population and about 75% \nof the national urban population. The annual growth rate in the Nuku\u2019alofa urban area from 1996 \nto  2006  was  0.85%.  Migration  to  Nuku\u2019alofa  from  Tonga's  outer  islands  is  significant. \nApproximately 22% of households migrated to Nuku\u2019alofa from other areas within Tonga during \nthe  last  10  years,  half  of  whom  migrated  during  the  last  2  years.2  The  impact  of  rural\u2013urban \nmigration  on  Nuku'alofa's  population  has  been  reduced  by  overseas  migration,  with  30%  of \nhouseholds in Nuku'alofa reporting that household members had emigrated in the last 5 years. \n\n3. \nUnder  the  Tongan  Constitution,  every  male  citizen  is  entitled  to  two  plots  of  land,  one \nrural  and  one  urban.  As  a  result  of  growing  demands  for  this  entitlement,  the  Government  is \nincreasingly under pressure to allocate urban plots. It has resorted to allocating land within two \nlow-lying areas of Nuku\u2019alofa, namely the Popua district to the east of the urban area and the \nSopu district to the west, both of which are areas of swampland that are continually flooded. \n\n4. \nThe buildup of traffic in and around Nuku\u2019alofa in recent years has meant that the main \napproach roads to the urban area, and roads in the town center, are experiencing congestion.3 \nThis  is  especially  severe  around  the  public  market  and  also  in  other  areas  at  peak  office  and \nschool arrival and departure hours. Traffic congestion in the town center is exacerbated by the \nfact  that  vehicular  access  to  the  wharves  and  industrial  sites  to  the  east  of  the  primary  urban \narea  is  restricted  and  has  to  pass  either  through  or  close  to  central  commercial  areas.  In \naddition,  the  lack  of  adequate  traffic  management  in  strategic  locations  along  the  main  road \nnetwork, and especially in terms of off-street parking, also contributes to traffic congestion.  \n\n5. \nThe lack of adequate sidewalks alongside many of the busiest roads results in significant \nconflict between pedestrians and vehicular traffic. The situation is particularly acute during rains, \nwhen roadside flooding forces pedestrians onto the main roadways. \n\n6. \nThe  standard  of  road  maintenance  and  repair  is  low  and  usually  involves  repeated \npatching of damaged sections. Where roads are resurfaced, a new layer of chip seal is laid on \ntop  of  the  existing  surfaces  without  repair  to  the  base  course  in  soft  areas,  resulting  in  rapid \n                                                 \n1  The population of Nuku'alofa is based on data gathered during the 2006 Census. \n2  ADB.  2006.  Preparing  the  Tonga  Integrated  Urban  Development  Project.  Technical  Report  \u2013  Social  Issues  in \n\nUrban Development. Manila. \n\n3  A 1-day manual traffic count was conducted in June 2006 over an 11-hour period. It recorded nearly 11,000 vehicle \nmovements on Taufa'ahau Road, the main artery into the urban area. This represents an increase of 270% over \nthe results of a survey completed in 1999. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ndeterioration  of  the  resurfaced  road.  The  absence  of  adequate  road  drainage  and  poor \nmaintenance of existing drains result in frequent flooding along roadways or over the roadways \nthemselves. In 1998, the Ministry of Works (MOW) prepared a comprehensive nationwide road \nimprovement  program,  and  considerable  work  has  been  accomplished  in  completing  the \nprimary  and  secondary  roads  throughout  Nuku\u2019alofa.  However,  many  of  the  roads  completed \nprior  to  the  1998  plan  have  now  exceeded  their  designed  useful  lives  and  again  require \nresurfacing.  The  surfaces  of  most  local  residential  access  roads  are  gravel.  These  are  badly \nbroken and potholed. After heavy rain, they can be untrafficable, limiting access to homes. \n\n7. \nThe topography of Tongatapu is flat and low-lying. The highest elevation on Tongatapu \nis  70  meters  above  mean  sea  level.  Most  of  the  urban  area  of  Nuku'alofa  is  only  1\u20132  meters \nabove that level and is subject to periodic flooding during heavy rain. Most floodwater eventually \ninfiltrates into the limestone substrata, but there are extensive low-lying areas within the urban \narea that are frequently flooded and provide ideal conditions for mosquitoes and transmission of \nwaterborne diseases. \n\nThe existing drainage systems in the central areas of Nuku\u2019alofa do not function well due \n8. \nto siltation and other forms of blockage, coupled with a general lack of repair and maintenance. \nNuku'alofa has a number of open drainage channels with limited culvert interconnections. These \nchannels frequently either have no outlets or their outlets are substantially blocked, resulting in \nstagnant  water  lying  for  days  until  it  eventually  infiltrates  or  evaporates.  Some  areas  of \nNuku'alofa have very limited drainage systems and so stormwater collects at low points, where \nit infiltrates into the ground only after prolonged periods. \n\nDevelopment  of  residential  subdivisions  in  low-lying  swampy  areas  such  as  Sopu  and \n9. \nPopua  is  constrained  by  the  presence  of  large  bodies  of  undrained  surface  water,  requiring \nsubstantial  filling  of  allotments  and  roads.  The  piecemeal  filling  of  roads  and  allotments  has \naltered the natural drainage patterns. The blockage of natural flow paths has created additional \nswamps and open water bodies. These result in flood damage to property, perpetually standing \nwater, and a loss of access to unfilled allotments. \n\n10.  Most  households  in  Nuku'alofa  rely  on  individual  septic  tank  systems  for  wastewater \ndisposal.  Many  septic  tanks  are  undersized  and  improperly  constructed  and  may  be  polluting \nthe  groundwater  resources.  Contaminated  groundwater  discharging  to  the  coastal  fringe  and \nlagoon  areas  are  thought  to  be  the  cause  of  excessive  algal  growth,  and  there  are  concerns \nabout impacts on the aquatic ecosystems. Monitoring of the groundwater quality is limited and \ndoes  not  allow  detailed  evaluation  of  groundwater  conditions.  Nuku'alofa's  water  supply  is \nsourced  from  Tongatapu's  aquifers.  Detailed  groundwater  and  hydrogeologic  analysis  is \nrequired  to  assess  the  impact  of  wastewater  disposal  methods  on  groundwater  quality.  The \nProject\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n11. \nA  number  of  government  agencies  are  responsible  for  land  transportation  and  traffic \nmanagement  in  Tonga.  The  MOW  is  responsible  for  planning  and  design  standards,  road \nconstruction, and maintenance. The Ministry of Police is responsible for vehicle licensing, traffic \nsignals,  traffic  management,  and  traffic  enforcement.  The  Department  of  Environment/Ministry \nof Health is responsible for street cleaning and public health. The Ministry of Labor, Commerce \nand  Industries  is  responsible  for  bus  and  taxi  rates  and  operations.  Limited  interagency  and \ninterdepartmental  coordination  has  resulted  in  inadequate  allowance  for  the  provision  of \ninfrastructure  and  such  public  utilities  as  drainage,  water,  and  electricity  supply  lines  in  many \nroad rights-of-way. \n\n\fCivil  unrest  on  16  November  2006  caused  the  destruction  of  or  serious  damage  to \n12. \napproximately  25%  of  the  buildings  within  the  Nuku'alofa  central  business  area  (CBA).  In \naddition to the high reconstruction cost, the Tongan economy has suffered a decline in business \nactivity and a substantial reduction in tourist arrivals. The Government has obtained a loan from \nthe People's Republic of China for T$118 million ($62 million) for reconstructing the CBA. The \nreconstruction  activities  will  focus  on  replacing  the  buildings  destroyed  in  November  2006. \nAdditional infrastructure works, beyond the scope of the reconstruction project, will be required \nwithin the CBA, although the nature and extent of the required works is yet to be fully assessed. \nAn analysis of the urban sector in Tonga is in Appendix 2. \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nLand Allocations. All land in the Kingdom of Tonga belongs to the Crown and is divided \n13. \nbetween the King\u2019s land, the Royal Family\u2019s hereditary estates, the nobles and chiefs' hereditary \nestates, and Government land. The nobles and chiefs' hereditary estates and Government land \nare  subdivided  into  allotments  for  the  rest  of  the  people  of  Tonga.  The  land  tenure  regulation \nstipulates  that  every  Tongan  male  over  the  age  of  16  is  entitled  to  a  rural  and  an  urban \nallotment. With growing urbanization, the Government has increasing difficulty in honoring this \nright,  and  it  has  been  forced  to  develop  marginal  land  on  the  periphery  of  Nuku'alofa.  As  a \nresult,  many  people  in Nuku\u2019alofa, and  particularly  the  most  vulnerable,  live  in  low-lying  flood-\nprone areas unsuitable for housing and with poorly developed public infrastructure. To provide \nbasic  public  infrastructure,  such  as  all-weather  roads  and  functional  drainage,  in  existing \nresidential areas such as Sopu and Popua will significantly improve living conditions in terms of \nhealth  and  amenities  while  creating  opportunities  to  utilize  land  that  now  is  permanently \nwaterlogged. \n\n14. \nUrbanization.  With  continued  rural-to-urban  migration,  development  pressure  in \nNuku\u2019alofa  is  increasing  and  existing  infrastructure  (particularly  roads  and  drainage)  does  not \nhave  the  capacity  required  to  meet  growing  traffic  volumes  and  stormwater  runoff  associated \nwith  urbanization.  Limited  recurrent  maintenance  of  roads  and  drains  has  exacerbated \npressures on existing public infrastructure. Upgrading of existing infrastructure and development \nof  comprehensive  and  sustainable  maintenance  programs  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  growing \npopulation  are  required  immediately.  Land  for  urban  expansion  of  Nuku'alofa  is  limited  to  the \nperipheral  agricultural  and  ecologically  sensitive  areas.  Without  coordinated  and  systematic \nurban planning, urban population growth may increasingly push into more peripheral areas and \nresult in underutilization of existing infrastructure and services and the costly extension of public \nutilities  and  services  into  new  and  more  remote  development  areas.  Recent  establishment  of \nthe Planning and Urban Management Division (PUMD) provides the Government a mechanism \nto  plan  and  coordinate  urban  development.  Limited  qualified  and  experienced  staff  and \nresources  within  PUMD  constrain  the  Government  in  providing  effective  and  efficient  urban \nplanning  and  management  services,  however,  and  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  build  capacity \nwithin PUMD. \n\n15. \nPublic  Sector  Reform  and  Institutional  Responsibilities.  Significant  government \nrestructuring has taken place in Tonga since a fiscal crisis occurred in 2005. In July 2006, the \nGovernment  significantly  downsized  the  administration.  Historically,  there  has  been  a  lack  of \ncomprehensive  and  coordinated  planning.  Currently,  a  variety  of  departments  have  roles  in \nvarious aspects of planning and managing urban areas. The Ministry of Finance is responsible \nfor  developing  the  Government\u2019s  national  plan  and  providing  policy  advice  on  all  matters \npertaining  to  social  and  economic  development.  The  Tonga  Water  Board  is  responsible  for \nproviding  potable  water  to  the  urban  areas.  The  MOW  is  responsible  for  processing  building \n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\npermits  and  assistance  with  civil  works  for  roads  and  drainage.  The  Ministry  of  Health  is \nresponsible for reviewing building designs for compliance with sanitation requirements. A Solid \nWaste Management Authority was established in October 2006 for collecting solid waste. The \nMinistry  of  Lands  and  Survey  is  responsible  for  mapping  and  assigning  land  allocations.  The \nlack of specific institutional arrangements for urban planning and management directly leads to \nthe current ad hoc approach to urban development. \n\n16. \nExternal  Assistance  to  the  Urban  Sector.  Historically,  much  of  the  assistance  from \nmultilateral  or  bilateral  donors  has  been  focused  on  rural  areas  and  Tonga\u2019s  outer  island \ngroups. Past external assistance was poorly coordinated and had limited success in addressing \nthe Government\u2019s development priorities. Assistance for the urban sector has been limited and \nmostly  ad  hoc  and  limited  in  scope.  However,  there  are  a  number  of  exceptions.  The \nGovernment of Japan has provided grant assistance for improvements to the Nuku\u2019alofa Water \nSupply.4 The Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) funded the Nuku\u2019alofa \nUrban  Roads  and  Drainage  Study  of  1993  under  a  9-year  institutional strengthening  program. \nImprovement  of  the  road  from  Nuku\u2019alofa  to  the  airport  was  funded  by  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency (JICA), and including roadside drainage in the CBA. The ongoing AusAID \nSolid Waste Management Project is aimed at comprehensive waste collection and management \nin  Nuku'alofa,  including  the  provision  of  a  new  sanitary  landfill  site  that  opened  in  December \n2006.  JICA  and  Danida  (Danish  International  Development  Assistance)  are  engaged  in  water \nsupply extension and improvements on Tongatapu, but this is mostly outside Nuku'alofa as 95% \nof  households  already  have  access  to  the  water  system.  AusAID  is  providing  assistance  for \nreconstructing  the  CBA,  which  was  damaged  during  the  unrest  in  2006.  The  $62  million  loan \nfrom  People's  Republic  of  China  will  support  reconstruction  works  in  the  CBA.    External \nassistance is summarized in Appendix 3. \n\n17. \nLessons.  ADB  has  not  provided  targeted  support  to  Tonga\u2019s  urban  sector,  but  it  has \nprovided  support  to  four  infrastructure  projects,  the  last  of  which  was  completed  in  2000.5  A \nnumber of lessons have emerged from ADB\u2019s support for infrastructure development in Tonga. \nCost  overruns  have  historically  been  related \nin \nimplementation.  The  risk  of  delays in  project  implementation  and  associated  cost  overruns  for \ncore  subprojects  need  to  be  addressed  through  carefully  identified  and  technically  feasible \nsubprojects  and  careful  preparation  of  bid  documents  during  project  preparation.  Preparing \naccurate  cost  estimates  is  a  difficult  task  for  physical  investment  projects  in  Tonga  given  the \ncountry\u2019s  reliance  on  international  contractors,  particularly  for  civil  works  contracts  in  New \nZealand  and  Australia.  Physical  contingencies  need  to  be  sufficient  to  allow  for  technical \nuncertainties. The choice of procurement methods must consider the Government\u2019s capacity to \nmanage and coordinate contracts and the ability to attract sufficient qualified bidders.  \n\nto  poor  project  design  and  delays \n\n                                                 \n4 The  Government  of  Japan  approved  grants  in  2000  and  2001  in  the  amount  of  \u00a5320  million  and  \u00a5857  million \n\nrespectively for improvements of the Nuku\u2019alofa Water Supply. \n\n5  ADB has supported infrastructure development in Tonga through ADB. 1994.

Manila (Loan 0146-TON, completed in 1979). \n\n\fThe  ADB  special  evaluation  study   Effectiveness  of  Multiproject  Lending  (1997)6  \n18. \nconcluded  that  (i)  special  approaches  to  lending  are  required  for  smaller  developing  member \ncountries  and  multiproject  lending  is  an  appropriate  approach; 7  and  (ii)  the  success  rate  of \nmultiprojects was disappointing due mainly to \u201cpoor project preparation, inadequate attention to \ninstitutional  capacity  problems,  and  failure  to  properly  supervise  implementation.\u201d  The  special \nstudy  recommended  that  multiprojects  should  only  be  applied  where  (i)  the  multiproject  had  a \nlimited  number  of  subprojects,  each  with  a  strong  rational  and  complementarity  to  the  overall \nobjective; (ii) the capacity of the executing and implementing agencies to implement the project \nis  assured;  and  (iii)  the  transaction  costs  associated  with  the  multiproject  are  less  than  other \nlending modes. The proposed project will meet these criteria by (i) selecting a limited number of \nsubprojects which address the urban sector investment priorities in Nuku'alofa (road upgrading, \ndrainage,  and  sanitation),  (ii)  supplying  technical  and  managerial  capacity  to  the  executing \nagency through providing project implementation assistance consultants and capacity building, \nand (iii) minimizing transaction costs through a sector loan modality. \n\n19. \nNeed  for  a  Sector  Approach.  Nuku'alofa\u2019s  expansion  has  been  driven  by  ad  hoc \nprojects in response to immediate development priorities. The lack of sector-wide planning has \nresulted  in  the  development  of  residential  areas  on  unsuitable  land  on  Nuku'alofa's  periphery \nand public infrastructure with limited capacity for future urban growth. Coordinated sector-wide \nurban  planning  is  required.  The  approach  must  be  flexible  to  meet  changing  investment \npriorities  and  to  coordinate  with  the  Government\u2019s  existing  urban  infrastructure  investment \npriorities,  such  as  the  CBA  reconstruction  that  is  currently  in  the  planning  phase.  A  sector \napproach will also reduce the Government\u2019s transaction costs to prepare urban sector projects. \n\nGovernment  Policy  and  Strategy. The Government\u2019s development aims and program \n20. \nare presented in its Strategic Development Plan Eight, which was approved in April 2006. The \neight  broad  goals  for  the  Kingdom  in  the  Plan  are  (i)  a  better  governance  environment;  (ii) \nmacroeconomic stability; (iii) sustained and globally competitive private sector-led growth in the \neconomy; (iv) equitable distribution of the benefits of growth; (v) improved education standards; \n(vi) improved health standards; (vii) environmental sustainability and disaster risk reduction; and \n(viii) maintenance of law and order, social cohesion, and cultural identity. The Plan\u2019s Strategy 20 \nspecifically  targets  developing  an  urban  planning  and  management  strategy  for  Tonga  and \nformulating an investment project for development of urban areas. \n\n21. \nADB\u2019s Role. ADB\u2019s strategy in Tonga is to support implementing Strategic Development \nPlan  Eight,  particularly  regarding  the  goals  for  (i)  better  governance;  (ii)  macroeconomic \nstability;  and  (iii)  private  sector-led  economic  growth,  including  the  Government\u2019s  increased \nemphasis on urban development. This strategy contributes to ADB\u2019s overarching goal of poverty \nreduction,  is  fully  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Strategy  2005\u20132009,  and  supports  Tonga\u2019s \ncontinued economic and social development and achievement of the Millennium Development \nGoals. The Project will utilize a sector approach to executing Strategy 20. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n                                                \n6  ADB. 1997. Effectiveness of Multiproject Lending.

Rehabilitating  approximately  10  kilometers  (km)  of  primary  roads, \nincluding  road  drainage,  constructing  4  km  of  all-weather  access  roads  in  low-\nincome  residential  areas;  and  developing  a  preventive  road  maintenance \nprogram. \nDrainage. Rehabilitating all existing drains in Nuku'alofa's central business area, \nconstructing 2.1 km of flood relief drains, and developing a stormwater drainage \nmaintenance program. \nSanitation.  Constructing  eight  groundwater  monitoring  wells  and  monitoring \ngroundwater quality. \nCandidate  subprojects.  Constructing  candidate  subprojects  selected  following \nthe selection criteria set out in Appendix 4. \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe Project outputs will comprise core subprojects and candidate subprojects. The core \n\n \n24. \nsubprojects include: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nimprovement  of  the  existing  drainage  system  in  the  town's  central  commercial \narea, and along the main sea frontage of Vuna Road, including the provision of \nstreet sweeping equipment to reduce build up of debris, and a jet/vacuum truck \nfor the cleaning of the existing storm sewers; \na  gabion-lined  drainage  channel  through  the  low-lying,  swampy  area  of  Sopu, \nconnecting the largest isolated open water areas to the watershed outlet; \nresurfacing and widening of the vehicular road surface on Taufa'ahau Road (4.05 \nkm), the town's main arterial route, to provide a turning lane and construction of \nsidewalks  on  both  sides  of  the  road,  and  provision  of  the  existing  stormwater \ncollection systems; \nresurfacing, widening, and providing of sidewalks on Alaivahamama'o Road (1.5 \nkm) including providing stormwater collection systems; \nresurfacing  and  providing  storm-water  drains  and  culverts  and  sidewalks  on \nVaha'akolo Road, the main alternate route into the town center; \nresurfacing and extension of approximately 4 km of secondary and access roads \nin the urban residential areas of Popua and Sopu; and \ninstalling  eight  monitoring  wells  in  strategic  locations  of  the  urban  area  to \nfacilitate  collection  of  data  on  groundwater  quality,  particularly  in  relation  to  the \nimpact of wastewater discharges on the well-field and the lagoon. \n\nCandidate  subprojects  selected  in  accordance  with  the  selection  criteria  provided  in \n\n \n\n25. \nAppendix 6 and approved by the Project Steering Committee and ADB. \n \nC. \n\nADF IX Grant \n\n \n\n26. \nTonga experienced annual growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) of about 2.4% \nover 2000\u20132005. As a result of Tonga\u2019s dependence on global markets and weakening of key \n\n\feconomic  drivers,  and  including  a  reduction  in  remittances,  tourism,  and  agricultural  exports, \neconomic  growth  is  estimated  to  have  fallen  to  about  0.6%  for  FY2006.  After  the  economy \nweakened  and  monetary  policy  was  tightened,  civil  unrest  erupted  in  November  2006.  This  is \nexpected to lead to a further decline in economic performance. \n\n27. \nTonga\u2019s public sector debt has remained stable at between 40% and 50% of GDP since \nthe late 1980s and is estimated at 44% for FY2007. External debt makes up the bulk of public \nsector  debt.  With  most  of  the  external  debt  being  concessional,  the  net  present  value  of  the \npublic sector debt is about 25% of GDP. In addition, contingent liabilities were estimated at 8% \nof  GDP  for  FY2005.  Tonga\u2019s  debt  sustainability  remains  vulnerable  to  deteriorating  economic \nperformance. Also at risk is the potential to use debt financing for productive investment that will \nsupport economic growth. The proposed ADF IX grant of $11.30 million to the Government will \nease  the  macroeconomic  impact  of  the  large  financing  requirements  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment  that  are  essential  to  laying  the  foundation  for  economic  growth  and  social \ndevelopment. \n \nThe R-paper on Revising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants (the ADF \n28. \nR-paper)  was  approved  by  the  Board  on  26  September  2007. 8  The  ADF  R-paper  limits  the \neligibility for ADF grant assistance to ADF-only (Group A) countries. Tonga was reclassified as \nGroup  A  country  following  the  Board  consideration  of  the  R-paper  on  Review  of  the  1998 \nGraduation Policy of the Asian Development Bank on 25 April 2008 and will be eligible for 100% \nADF grant assistance as a country with a high-risk of debt distress. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nIntegrated  Approach  to  Urban  Development. The Project will provide the foundation \nfor fully integrated and coordinated urban planning. New legislation will be drafted providing the \nframework  for  urban  development.  PUMD  will  coordinate  urban  planning  and  management. \nOther  government  ministries  will  continue  to  be  responsible  for  providing  infrastructure  and \nother  services  but  will  operate  within  the  development  frameworks  set  out  in  plans  and \nprograms  prepared  by  PUMD.  PUMD  will  provide  a  key  liaison  and  coordination  function  with \nother parts of the Government and other agencies in urban services planning and management. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n30. \nCoordination  with  Donor  Partners. The European Union is considering the provision \nof  a  \u20ac1.8  million  technical  assistance  grant  for  Sustainable  Urban  and  Environmental \nManagement. The proposed European Union technical assistance grant has been designed in \ncollaboration  with  ADB  to  complement  the  proposed  Integrated  Urban  Development  Sector \nProject  and  its  associated  TA  for  Urban  Planning  and  Management.  AusAID  has  an  ongoing \nsmall-projects fund for Tonga, providing grants from the fund for community projects\u2014including \nto  provide  grants  to  low-income  earners  for  filling  residential  plots  in  low-lying  urban  areas. \nAusAID  has  agreed  to  coordinate  the  allocation  of  grants  for  lot-filling  with  the  upgrading  of \nsecondary  and  access  roads  in  Sopu  and  Popua  funded  through  the  Project.  AusAID  has \nprovisionally  budgeted  approximately  A$200,000  per  annum  over  a  3-year  period  for  the \ninitiative. In addition, the Project will complement the proposed CBA reconstruction project to be \nfunded by the People's Republic of China. Although the Integrated Urban Development Sector \nProject  does  not  have  common  components  with  the  proposed  CBA  reconstruction  project,  it \nwill  provide  for  rehabilitating  drainage  systems  and  upgrading  roads  within  the  CBA  that  are \nessential to support the investments funded by the People\u2019s Republic of China. PUMD will be \n\n \n                                                \n8 ADB. 2007. Revising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants. Draft Policy Paper.

The  Project\u2019s  sector  approach  will  provide  the \nGovernment  with  the  flexibility  to  implement  infrastructure  priorities  identified  for  urban  sector \ndevelopment and which add value to the CBA reconstruction project. \n\n31. \nParticipatory  Approach. A highly participatory approach was employed to prepare the \nProject,  and  consultations  with  stakeholders  were  conducted  throughout  Tonga.  The  social \nassessment component was based on (i) 16 workshops that included altogether more than 300 \nparticipants  on  community  needs  assessment  and  involved  particular  interest  groups,  women, \nyouth,  and  community  leaders,  as  well  as  church  leaders  in  'Eua,  Ha\u2019apai,  Tongatapu,  and \nVava\u2019u; and (ii) a socioeconomic survey of 431 randomly selected households in Nuku\u2019alofa. A \nreport on the results of the consultations is given in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\nE. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n32. \nThe Project\u2019s investment cost is estimated at $14.22 million, including taxes and duties \nof  $1.80  million  equivalent.  Cost  estimates  by  project  component  are  summarized  in  Table  1 \nbelow,  and  the  summary  financing  plan  is  presented  in  Table  2.

A  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be  established \nand  will  be  chaired  by  the  minister  of  finance  with  the  following  members:  minister  of  works; \nminister  of  lands,  survey  and  natural  resources;  secretary  of  lands,  survey  and  natural \nresources;  solicitor  general;  secretary  of  finance;  director  of  education;  director  of  health;  and \ndistrict  officers  of  Kolomotu\u2019a  and  Kolofo\u2019ou.  The  project  manager  will  serve  as  the  secretary-\nmember  of  the  PSC.  The  PSC  will  provide  guidance  for  the  overall  direction  of  the  Project.  A \nproject  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be  established  within  the  EA  for  day-to-day  management \nand  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  director  of  MOW  will  be  appointed  as  the  project \nmanager.  The  PMU  will  (i)  serve  as  the  secretariat  for  the  PSC;  (ii)  undertake  project \nmanagement, administration, and interagency coordination at the executive level; (iii) maintain \nproject  accounts;  (iv)  oversee  procurement  process;  (v)  prepare  quarterly  project  progress \nupdates and other reporting requirements; and (vi) prepare the project completion report to the \nGovernment and ADB. The PMU will be supported by project implementation assistance (PIA) \nconsultants  who  will  provide  project  planning,  design,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  These \nconsultants also will provide cost and quality control services, and they will be assisted by staff \nfrom  MOW.9  The  EA  will  ensure  that,  throughout  the  project  implementation  period,  adequate \nallocations of counterpart funds are made, approved, and released in a timely manner to ensure \nproper  project  implementation.  The  EA  will  provide  adequate  office  space  for  the  Project  and \nensure that the facilities provided under the Project are operated and maintained appropriately. \nAn  organization  chart  showing  the  implementation  arrangements  and  the  PMU  structure  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \n37.  MOW has established financial systems to implement the Project, but human resources \nare  limited  following  downsizing  of  the  Civil  Services  in  2006.  There  is  a  need  to  provide \nspecialist  personnel,  particularly  for  detailed  design  and  construction  supervision.  MOW  has \n                                                 \n9  MOW will provide the following staff to the PMU: (i) a qualified project accountant (full-time for 60 months), (ii) an \nadministrative  assistant  to  assist  the  PIA  consultants  (full-time  for  60  months),  (iii)  a  surveyor  and  surveyor\u2019s \nassistant  (each  with  intermittent  inputs  of  12  months  over  the  duration  of  the  Project),  (iv)  a  community  liaison \nofficer or resettlement officer (full-time for 60 months), and (v) an environment officer (full-time for 60 months). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nrecently  implemented  successfully  a  number  of  major  projects,  including  the  Solid  Waste \nManagement  Facility  funded  by  AusAID,  and  is  an  implementing  agency  for  the  World  Bank \nHealth  Sector  Support  Project.  The  PIA  consultants,  institutional  strengthening,  and  capacity \nbuilding  provided  under  the  Project  will  bring  MOW  the  resources  and  skill  sets  necessary  to \nimplement the Project. \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Preparation and Selection \n\nSubproject Preparation. Core subprojects were selected by the Government from a list \n38. \nof  potential  urban  development  investments  identified  in  the  Tonga  Integrated  Urban \n 10\nDevelopment  Project  Final  Report  following  the  selection  criteria  provided  in  Appendix  6.\nCandidate  subprojects  will  be  identified  by  the  PMU  from  the  urban  sector  development  plan. \nThe  PMU  will  then  obtain  approval  from  the  PSC  to  assess  the  feasibility  of  the  candidate \nsubprojects. 11   The  PMU  will  prepare  a  feasibility  study  for  each  candidate  subproject.  The \ncandidate subproject feasibility report will provide a technical analysis and description, rationale, \nscope  and  components,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan,  implementation  arrangements, \nenvironmental impact assessment, and social and poverty impact assessment. Each feasibility \nreport  will  be  submitted  initially  for  review  and  approval  by  ADB.  After  ADB  has  endorsed  the \nfeasibility  study,  the  PMU  will  submit  the  feasibility  study  to  the  PSC  for  review  and  approval. \nImplementation of a candidate subproject may proceed following endorsement of the candidate \nsubproject feasibility report by ADB and the PSC.  \n\n39. \nSelection Criteria. To be eligible for selection, a candidate subproject must be identified \nin  the  urban  sector  development  plan.  The  PSC,  in  consultation  with  the  PMU,  will  appraise \ncandidate subprojects in accordance with the criteria detailed in Appendix 6. \n\n40. \nSubproject  and  Safeguard  Plan  Approvals.  The  EA  will  submit  all  candidate \nsubproject feasibility reports to ADB for review and approval. ADB\u2019s final approval of financing \nfor each subproject is subject to review and confirmation that implementation is in accordance \nwith  the  subproject  selection  criteria  and  ADB  policies.  The  approved  resettlement  framework \nand  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  (EARP)  provide  the  basis  for \npreparing  candidate  subproject  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  (LARPs)  and  initial \nenvironmental examinations (IEEs). Prior to commencing land acquisition, the EA will submit to \nADB for review and approval all LARPs and IEEs, as applicable. \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n41. \nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years. Implementation is expected to commence \non  1  August  2008  and  be  completed  by  31  December  2012.  An  implementation  schedule  is \nincluded in Appendix 7. \n\n4. \n\nProcurement  \n\n42. \nProcurement  of  all  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All \ncontracts  for  works  will  be  awarded  using  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures. \nThe procurement of goods will preferably be grouped into packages larger than $200,000 to be \nsuitable  for  ICB  procedures.  Limited  international  bidding  may  be  used  for  contracts  with  an \nexpected cost of $200,000 or less. Miscellaneous minor goods expected to cost under $100,000 \n                                                 \n10 Global Works Inc. 2006. Tonga Integrated Urban Development Project - Final Report. Manila. \n11 A fully costed urban sector development plan will be prepared under the Project\u2019s attached technical assistance. \n\n\fequivalent will be purchased using shopping procedures. The proposed procurement plan is in \nAppendix 8. \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n43. \nAn  international  consulting  firm  (57  person-months  of  international  and  151  person-\nmonths of national consulting services) will be engaged as PIA consultants to assist the PMU in \noverall  project  management  and  implementation.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) using quality and cost-based selection procedures. The Government has requested ADB \nto assist in recruiting the PIA consultants. ADB will assist by selecting the consultant on behalf \nof  MOW.  However,  MOW  will  be  responsible  for  negotiating  the  contract  with  the  consultants \nand  supervising  the  consultants\u2019  services.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  PIA  consultants \nand the PMU support staff are included in Supplementary Appendix C. \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n44. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant agreement and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  of  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n\n7. \n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing \n\n45. \nThe  Government  has  requested  that  advance  procurement  action  be  provided  for  the \nrecruitment and fielding of PIA consultants. The Government has also requested and ADB has \napproved the use of retroactive financing for the fielding of the PIA consultants in the amount of \n$300,000 incurred before the grant effectiveness date but not earlier than 12 months before the \ndate  of  the  Grant  Agreement.  Advance  procurement  action  and  retroactive  financing  will \nfacilitate timely implementation of the Project. To be eligible for ADB financing, the recruitment \nof the PIA consultants will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Retroactive  financing  will  be  considered  for  such \nrecruitment in an amount not exceeding $300,000. The Government has been advised that the \napproval  of  advance  procurement  action  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to \nfinancing the Project. \n \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n46. \nThe  Grant  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook, January 2007, as amended from time to time. To facilitate cash flow during project \nimplementation,  the  MOW  requested  for  the  Imprest  Account  to  be  opened  by  MOW \nimmediately  after  grant  effectiveness  and  will  be  exclusively  used  to  finance  ADB  share  of \neligible expenditures. The initial advance to be deposited to an imprest account will not exceed \neither  6  months  of  estimated  expenditures  to be  financed  from  the  imprest  account  or  10% of \nthe loan amount, whichever is lower. The direct payment procedure will apply for the contracts \nawarded  under  ICB.  If  the  Government  initially  funds  eligible  expenditures  from  its  own \n\n11 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nresources,  the  reimbursement  procedures  will  be  used.  To  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify \ndocumentation  process,  the  Statement  of  Expenditures  (SOE)  Procedure  will  be  used  for \nliquidation and replenishment of imprest account and reimbursement of eligible expenditures not \nexceeding $100,000 per individual payment. \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n47.  MOW  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  the  Project,  and  it  will  have  the \nproject accounts and financial statements audited annually by independent auditors acceptable \nto  ADB.  The  EA  will  provide  ADB  with  copies  of  the  audited  project  accounts  and  financial \nstatements no later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. The EA \nwill provide ADB with quarterly progress reports on project implementation. Within 3 months of \nphysical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  EA  will  provide  ADB  with  a  project  completion  report. \nProgress reports will be compiled by the PMU. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on use of imprest \naccount and statement of expenditure procedures will be provided as a part of the audit report. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Review  \n\n48. \n The PMU will establish a performance management system satisfactory to ADB within 6 \nmonths of the grant effectiveness date. The system will establish a cause-and-effect relationship \nbetween the Project and its impact and will comprise (i) a comprehensive list of implementation-\nrelated  performance  indicators  duly  collected,  monitored,  and  recorded  by  the  PMU  and \nsemiannually  assessed  by  MOW;  and  (ii)  post-completion  performance  and  impact  data \ncollected by the PMU. Baseline and impact data will be disaggregated by city, town, and local \narea,  as  well  as  by  other  dimensions  to  be  discussed  at  project  inception.  Implementation  of \nperformance  monitoring  will  integrate  financial  and  other  aspects.  Analysis  of  social  impacts \nunder project performance monitoring will be gender disaggregated and will take into account (i) \nthe differential project impacts and risks facing women, (ii) gender-specific measures to mitigate \nadverse impacts and manage risks, and (iii) the interests and capacities of women to contribute \nto the Project. \n \n49. \nADB will undertake an inception mission 1 month after the grant effectiveness date or 1 \nmonth  after  fielding  of  project  implementation  consultants,  whichever  is  later.  ADB  and  the \nGovernment  will  undertake  semi-annual  review  missions  to  evaluate  project  scope  and  costs, \nimplementation  arrangements, \ntargets,  and \nidentification  of  project  risks.  The  review  missions  will  also  assess  the  Government\u2019s \ncompliance  with  grant  covenants.  ADB  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a  midterm  review \nmission  2  years  after  the  grant  effectiveness  date.  The  midterm  review  will  undertake  a \ncomprehensive review of (i) the Project\u2019s scope, design, and implementation arrangements; (ii) \nprogress of the Project against projections and performance indicators; and (iii) compliance with \nthe grant covenants. The midterm review will also recommend changes deemed necessary to \nthe Project\u2019s scope and implementation arrangements. The project manager will represent the \nGovernment during review missions. \n \n\nresettlement,  achievement  of  scheduled \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n50. \nThe  Government  has  requested  associated  TA  to  develop  and  implement  the  urban \nplanning and management system proposals formulated under TA4648-TON. The impact of the \n\n\fexpected outcomes \nTA will be improved standard of living within urban areas of Tonga.\nare  (i)  well-planned  and  sustainable  urban  development,  and  (ii)  a  safe  and  efficient  road \nsystem  within  Nuku'alofa.  The  TA  will  comprise  four  components  and  will  provide  (i)  the \npreparation of planning legislation; (ii) capacity building in PUMD and provision of assistance to \ndevelop a fully costed urban sector development plan that identifies and prioritizes the sector\u2019s \ndevelopment  needs  for  2009\u20132020;  (iii)  a  traffic  management  study  for  Nuku'alofa;  and  (iv) \ncapacity  building  within  MOW  for  planning,  design,  supervision,  and  project  management  for \nroad maintenance projects. \n\n The \n\n12\n\n51. \nThe Ministry of Lands, Survey, Natural Resources and Environment will be the EA and \nwill  also  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  the  planning  legislation  and  planning  and  urban \nmanagement components of the TA. MOW will be the Implementing Agency for the TA\u2019s traffic \nmanagement and road maintenance components. The TA will be implemented over a period of \n1 year and will commence in August 2008. Consulting services will comprise 25 person-months \nof  international  consulting  services  and  40  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services \nrecruited through a firm using quality and cost-based selection methods. The total cost of the TA \nis  estimated  at  $875,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  finance  $700,000  equivalent.  The  TA  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment  will  provide  $175,000  for  counterpart  funding.  The  TA  Paper  is  attached  as \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Impacts \n\n52. \nEconomic  analyses  were  undertaken  for  core  subprojects;  primary,  secondary,  and \naccess roads; and the Sopu Drainage Channel. The analyses were conducted by comparing the \ndiscounted costs and benefits under \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d scenarios over 2008\u20132026 in constant \n2006 prices. The \u201cwithout\u201d case represents a continuation of the existing situation and the \u201cwith\u201d \ncase  represents  the  project  investment  scenarios.  The  economic  costs  accounted  for \ninvestments,  costs  of  project  implementation,  operations  and  maintenance,  environmental \nmanagement  and  mitigation,  as  well  as  resettlement  and  land  acquisition.  Operations  and \nmaintenance costs for the \u201cwith\u201d investment cases were estimated at 0.625% of capital costs for \nthe  three  primary  road  projects  and 1%  of  those  for  the  secondary  and  access  roads  and  the \nSopu Drainage Channel. Taxes and duties were excluded from the analyses. \n \nThe economic benefits for the road projects were evaluated in terms of fuel cost savings \n53. \nunder  the  \u201cwith\u201d  and  \u201cwithout\u201d  project  scenarios  and  account  for  differences  in  operation  and \nmaintenance costs. A fuel price of T$1.80 per liter, equivalent to about $58 per barrel for Brent \ncrude  oil,  was  applied  throughout  the  period  of  analysis.  The  estimated  annual  fuel  savings \namount to 582,000 liters, equivalent to an average net present value of T$0.37 million, or 0.7% \nof fuel imports for the transport sector in FY2006. Most of the benefits from fuel cost savings are \nexpected  to  accrue  to  users  and  passengers,  as  the  transportation  sector  is  deregulated  and \ncompetitive.  These  benefits  would  be  expected  to  include  lower  prices  for  consumer  goods \nalong  with  improved  access  to  markets  and  basic  social  services.  Improving  secondary  and \naccess  roads  in  Popua  and  Sopu  are  expected  to  primarily  benefit  the  lower-income  and \nmost-vulnerable  households  and  enable  them  to  benefit  from  the  upgrades  of  primary  roads. \n\n \n                                                \n12 Supports the Government's goals for urban planning and infrastructure development as expressed in Strategy 20 \nof  the  Strategic  Development  Plan  Eight  for  Tonga.  Government  of  Tonga.  2006.  Strategic  Development  Plan \nEight. Nuku\u2019alofa. \n\n13 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nThe calculated economic internal rates of return (EIRR) range from 18.2% to 12.2% for primary \nroad  subprojects  and  are  8.2%  for  the  secondary  and  access  road  subprojects  in  Popua  and \nSopu.  Improvements  in  secondary  and  access  roads  will  enable  low-income  households  in \nPopua  and  Sopu  to  benefit  from  the  upgrades  of  primary  roads.  The  EIRRs  presented  for \nprimary, secondary, and access roads were based on benefits accruing from vehicle operating \ncosts  and  do  not  account  for  benefits  such  as  travel  time  savings  and  improved  access  to \nmarkets and social services. Inclusion of these benefits would result in higher EIRRs.  \n \nThe economic costs associated with the Sopu Drainage Channel comprise capital costs \n54. \nplus  operation  and  maintenance  costs  calculated  at  1%  of  the  capital  costs.  Benefits  were \nevaluated in terms of cost savings associated with flood damage from heavy rains and structural \ndamage  to  houses  from  cyclones.  Damage  from  routine  flood  damage  and  structural  damage \nfrom cyclones are estimated at about 25% of annual average household income. The EIRR is \ncalculated at 11.6%. The analysis did not include benefits from reduced waterborne diseases, \nreduced  costs  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  roads,  lower  land  filling  costs  for  residential \nhouses, improved all-weather access to roads, and more opportunities to use the land. \n \n55. \nSensitivity analyses were undertaken on the economic results to examine the impacts of \nkey  assumptions  and  project  risks.  The  sensitivity  analyses  indicate  that  the  economic  results \nfor road projects are most sensitive to the assumptions of fuel cost savings, followed by capital \ncosts. An increase in global fuel prices would result in greater value of fuel costs savings and \nhigher  economic  rates  of  return.  A  20%  increase  in  capital  costs  would  reduce  the  economic \nviability  for  two  of  the  three  primary  road  projects  below  the  opportunity  cost  of  capital.  The \neconomic viability for the Sopu Drainage Channel was sensitive to the assumptions of benefits. \nA  20%  reduction  in  benefits  would  reduce  the  economic  rate  of  return  to  8%,  and  a  20% \nincrease  in  capital  costs  would  result  in  an  economic  rate  of  return  of  9%.  The  economic \nanalysis is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nThe  upgrading  of  the  secondary  and  access  roads  subproject  with  an  EIRR  of  8.2% \n56. \ndoes  not  meet  the  ADB  guideline  minimum  EIRR  of  10\u201312%  but  has  been  included  in  the \nProject  as  the  works  will  substantially  improve  social  inclusiveness  and  equity  in  low-income \nresidential areas. \n \nB. \n\nPoverty Reduction Impact \n\n57. \nAlthough  it  is  not  classified  as  poverty  intervention,  the  Project  addresses  poverty \nreduction by targeting, through the Sopu drainage and secondary roads subprojects, residents \nof  the  low-income  areas  of  Sopu  and  Popua.  Core  subprojects  were  developed  based  on  a \ndetailed poverty analysis conducted through various participatory approaches during the project \npreparatory stage. Project components in those areas will (i) provide for improved drainage of \nstagnant  water  in  low-lying  areas  and  reduce  the  risk  of  damage  from  floods  (Sopu);  and  (ii) \nimprove  the  residents\u2019  access  to  their  homes,  which  is  now  only  by  poorly  constructed  tracks \nthat  are  frequently  flooded  and  often  impassable  (Sopu  and  Popua).  The  Project  will  reduce \npoverty  by  lessening  the  financial  burden  of  repairing  flood  damage  to  properties  and,  just  as \nimportantly,  substantially  improving  the  access  to  and  habitability  of  low-income  residential \nareas. It will also lessen health care costs by reducing areas of standing water. The improved \naccess road conditions will reduce vehicle operating and repair costs.  \n \nThe  Project  also  provides  direct  employment  opportunities,  including  opportunities  for \n58. \nresidents  of  low-income  areas,  as  local  contractors  will  be  engaged  to  carry  out  much  of  the \nworks.  During  and  after  implementation,  employment  will  be  thus  created  in  constructing  and \n\n\fmaintaining civil works. Also, by reducing travel costs and times, inducing economic activities, \nand employing people directly, the Project will improve people\u2019s incomes and food security.  \n \n59. \nDuring the project performance monitoring for the Project, the economic impacts of the \nProject on the poor and nonpoor will be assessed using secondary and field data. A summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9, while a social and poverty analysis is in \nSupplementary Appendix A.  \n\nC. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n60. \nPositive  social  impacts  will  include  improved  access  to  commercial,  health,  education, \nand  other  community  facilities  within  the  urban  area.  Other  impacts  will  include  reduced \naccident rates for pedestrians and reduction in waterborne disease infections. Potential negative \nsocial  impacts  include  those  associated  with  faster  vehicular  traffic  brought  about  by  road \nrehabilitation.  Analysis  of  social  impacts  under  project  performance  monitoring  will  be  gender \ndisaggregated.  It  will  take  into  account  (i)  the  differential  project  impacts  and  risks  facing \nwomen,  (ii)  gender-specific  measures  to  mitigate  adverse  impacts  and  manage  risks,  and  (iii) \nthe interests and capacities of women to contribute to the Project. \n\nD. \n\nResettlement Impacts  \n\n61. \nOf the seven core subprojects, only the Sopu Drainage Channel subproject will involve \ninvoluntary resettlement. Widening of the Taufa'ahau Road will be contained within the existing \nright-of-way. The Taufa'ahau Road right-of-way is not being encroached upon for commercial or \nany other purpose. While the Sopu Drainage Channel will involve involuntary resettlement, no \nhouseholds  will  be  required  to  relocate  and  land  acquisition  will  be  limited.  A  summary  land \nacquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) is included in Appendix 10, and the short LARP is in \nSupplementary Appendix F. A LARP will be prepared for candidate subprojects that require land \nacquisition or have resettlement impacts following the guidelines set out in the land acquisition \nand resettlement framework (refer to Supplementary Appendix G). \n\n \n\nE. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n62. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) has been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), and a summary IEE is attached as Appendix 11. \nThe  Government\u2019s  environmental  requirements,  as  set  out  in  the  Environmental  Impact \nAssessment  Act  (2003),  have  also  been  taken  into  account.  Consultations  with  stakeholders \nwere undertaken while preparing the IEE to ensure their concerns will be adequately addressed \nand incorporated in the project design (refer to Supplementary Appendix H). \n \n63. \nThe  seven  core  subprojects  are  located  within  Nuku\u2019alofa  urban  area,  where  the \nenvironment  has  been  substantially  modified.  Most  of  the  subprojects  are  maintenance  and \nrehabilitation by nature. They are all small, involve minor civil works, and none of them will be \nlocated  or  pass  through  any  protected  areas  or  ecologically  sensitive  environment.  The  road \nupgrades  that  consist  of  resurfacing,  widening,  and  providing  sidewalks  will  be  within  the \nexisting  rights-of-way,  and  the  drainage  components  consist  of  improvements  to  the  existing \ndrainage  system  in  the  CBA  and  constructing  a  new  drainage  channel  in  a  settlement  area. \nMitigation  measures  have  been  formulated  to  minimize  environmental  impacts  to  insignificant \nlevels. The groundwater quality monitoring will involve installing wells around the project area. It \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nwill  produce  data  necessary  for  improving  conservation  of  the  lagoon  and  foreshore \nenvironment. Limited land acquisition will be involved, but no resettlement will be required. \n \n64. \nImproving  roads  and  constructing  drains  will  have  long-term  beneficial  impacts  on  the \nenvironment. As summarized in the environmental management plan (EMP), which will be part \nof  the  contractors\u2019  contracts,  all  potential  environmental  concerns  can  be  properly  mitigated. \nThe EMP will provide guidance for the EA to monitor and report on the Project\u2019s environmental \ncompliance.  Adherence  to  best  engineering  practices  and  enforcing  the  EMP  will  avoid  or \nmitigate to acceptable levels all of the Project\u2019s predicted environmental impacts.  \n \n65. \nAn  environment  and  social  unit  (ESU)  will  be  created  within  MOW  and  will  be \nestablished within 3 months of grant effectiveness. The ESU will operate within the PMU for the \nduration  of  the  Project.  The  unit  will  consist  of  two  people  who  will  be  responsible  for \nenvironmental  management,  land  acquisition and  resettlement,  as  well  as  public  relations  and \nconsultation. The ESU will be responsible to prepare IEEs for the subprojects and to supervise \ncontractors\u2019 EMP implementation by regularly observing and spot-checking construction-related \nactivities. In short, it will be responsible for environmental compliance requirements. \n \n66. \nEach subsequent subproject will be subject to an IEE, which will include a detailed, site-\nspecific EMP prepared under the responsibility of the PMU. The EMP will specify the required \nmitigation  measures  and  monitoring  activities  to  ensure  their  effectiveness.  Environmental \nassessment  review  procedures  (EARP)  have  been  prepared  that  will  guide  the  environmental \nmanagement  of  the  sector  project  and  the  preparation  of  environmental  assessments  of  the \nsubsequent subprojects. The EARPs are attached as Supplementary Appendix I. \n \nF. \n\nProject Risks and Safeguards \n\n67. \n\nThe risks and safeguards related to the Project include the following:  \n\nTechnical  risks. Underestimating resource allocation and improperly employing \nappropriate  construction  methods  and  equipment  might  cause  delays  and \nincrease  costs.  The  project  design  will  mitigate  these  risks  by  (a)  incorporating \nprovisions in tender documents for evidence of satisfactory past performance in \nsimilar conditions; and (b) requiring minimum levels for providing physical plant at \nmobilization,  detailed  quantification  of  engineering \nrisks,  and  adequate \ncontingencies for unforeseen items.  \nFinancial  risks. Budgetary allocations for the Project could be inadequate as a \nresult  of  underestimated  construction  costs,  more-than-routine  supervision  of \ncontractors,  inflation  during  implementation,  and  the  potential  cost  of  defending \nconstruction claims lodged by contractors. To mitigate these risks, the PMU will \n(a)  use  conservative  cost  estimates,  (b)  use  strict  and  effective  contract \nconditions  to  mitigate  slow  contractor  performance,  (c)  develop  measures  to \nmitigate uninsurable risks when preparing the contract documentation to limit the \nemployer\u2019s  exposure,  and  (d)  require  a  guarantee  by  the  contractor  for  1  year \nfollowing works completion to ensure construction quality. Government budgetary \nallocations for road maintenance and counterpart staff could be inadequate due \nto  poor  national  financial  management.  Ongoing  programs  supported  by \ndevelopment partners are strengthening the Government\u2019s budgetary processes, \nfinancial management systems, and provincial governance. This will improve the \nenvironment for project implementation and institutional capacity building. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nInstitutional reforms. The Government\u2019s commitment to the reform process, as \nwell  as  of  associated  development  and  implementation  of  operational  and \nmanagement  procedures,  could  wane.  The  reform  process  could  also  face \nincreasing public hostility if it does not occur at a reasonable pace. Further risks \ninclude  the  Government\u2019s  not  progressing  with  timely  legal  and  institutional \nreforms,  and  resource  shortages  within  MOW.  ADB  project  and  TA  review \nmissions,  as  well  as  country  consultation  missions,  will  engage  in  regular \ndialogue  to  maintain  support  and  commitment.  ADB  also  will  continue  to  work \nclosely with development partners to promote sector governance improvements.  \nLand  acquisition  risks.  Implementation of the Project could be delayed  due to \ndelays  in  obtaining  land.  No  land  acquisition  is  required  for  the  core  road \nupgrading subprojects. Landholders and lessees affected by the proposed Sopu \nDrainage  Channel  have  welcomed  the  proposed  channel  due  to  the  social  and \neconomic  benefits  it  will  provide  and  have  agreed  in  principle  to  relinquish  land \nrequired  to  accommodate  the  channel.  Candidate  subprojects  will  be  initially \nscreened  to  assess  potential  resettlement  impacts.  Candidate  subprojects  will \nnot be selected for inclusion in the Project if the initial screening indicates there is \nopposition to the candidate subproject from affected persons and the community. \n\n \n68. \nAn analysis of the project risks shows the economic benefits to be robust. Adverse social \nand  environmental  impacts  are  significant  and  are  amenable  to  mitigation.  Cost  and \nimplementation  risks  will  be  managed  carefully  through  the  proposed  approach  to  contractor \nprequalification, contract conditions, financial incentives, and penalties to avoid problems of late \nperformance.  The  risks  are  sufficiently  manageable  as  to  not  constitute  barriers  to  effective \nproject implementation. \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n69. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nCounterpart  staffing  and  support.  Within  3  months  of  the  grant  effectiveness \ndate,  the  Government  will  have  established  the  PMU.  The  Government  will \nprovide adequate office space, utilities, and telecommunications facilities for the \nPMU.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  counterpart  staff  are  employed  on  a \ntimely  basis  and  from  its  ordinary  budgetary  allocations,  and  ensure  that  the \nPMU has adequate budget to support its routine operations. \nCounterpart  financing.  The  Government  will  make  available  counterpart \nfinancing  on  a  timely  basis  from  its  ordinary  budgetary  allocations  to  ensure \nsmooth  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  Government  will  also  progressively \nincrease  recurrent  budgets  for  maintenance  to  protect  investments  in  road  and \nother infrastructure. \nRehabilitation  quality.  The Government, through the PMU, will ensure that the \nphysical  components  of \nin \naccordance  with  the  design  technical  specifications,  and  that  construction \nsupervision,  quality  control,  and  contract  management  are  carried  out  in \naccordance with internationally accepted standards.  \nLabor, health and safety laws. The Government, through the PMU, will ensure \nthat  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all  applicable  labor  laws  and  related \n\nthe  Project  are  constructed  or  rehabilitated \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\ninternational  treaty  obligations.  The  Government  will  also  ensure  that  the  civil \nworks  contractors  comply  with  all  applicable  health,  and  safety  laws  and \nregulations of the Government, including the provision of appropriate facilities.  \nPhysical  component  maintenance  policy.  Within  six  months  prior  to  the \nProject completion date, the Government, through the PMU, will have confirmed \nmaintenance policies for the physical components constructed under the Project, \nincluding budget and implementation arrangements, and submit them to ADB for \nreview and concurrence.  \nRoad  safety. The Government will ensure that appropriate road safety facilities \nare  provided  during  project  implementation  as  necessary,  including  pavement \nmarkings, traffic signs and signals, warning signs, and hazard barriers.  \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement. The Government will ensure that (a) land \nthe  Project  are \ninvoluntary  resettlement  activities  under \nacquisition  and \nminimized;  (b)  where  applicable,  no  civil  works  contract  will  be  awarded  for  a \nsubproject  until  the  Government  and  ADB  have  approved  the  Land  Acquisition \nand  Resettlement  Plan  (LARP)  for  the  particular  subproject;  (c)  all  land  and \nrights-of-way  required  by  the  Project  are  made  available  in  a  timely  manner; \n(d) ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  are  complied  with;  (e)  LARPs \nprepared  by  the  Government  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  framework \nagreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB  and  approved  by  ADB  are \nimplemented  according  to  their  terms;  and  (f)  LARPs  will  be  updated  based  on \ndetailed  design,  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  and  disclosed  to  affected \npersons.  The  LARP  will  be  prepared  for  the  subprojects  which  require  land \nacquisition  or  have  resettlement  impacts  in  accordance  with  (a)  the  Land \nAcquisition  and  Resettlement  Framework,  (b)  the  relevant  laws  and  regulations \nof the Government, and (c) ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  The Government will ensure that all works related to the road subprojects will be \nundertaken within rights-of-way. In the event of any unforeseen land acquisition \nor  resettlement  needs  arise  in  any  subproject  after  the  award  of  civil  works \ncontracts, the Government will inform ADB and prepare an updated LARP plan in \naccordance  with  (a)  the  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Framework,  (b)  the \nrelevant  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Recipient,  and  (c)  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement. During the preparation of the updated LARP and until \nADB has reviewed and approved such LARP, the Government will ensure that no \nconstruction activities related to that subproject will continue.  \nEnvironment.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  carried  out \nfollowing  the  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Procedures  (EARP) \nprepared in accordance with, and all Project facilities are designed, constructed, \noperated,  maintained  and  monitored \nin  compliance  with  all  applicable \nGovernment\u2019s  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy (2002).  \nThe Government will (a) establish within 3 months of the grant effectiveness date \nan  Environment  and  Social  Unit  within  MOW  that  will  be  responsible  for \nenvironmental/social  compliance  requirements  and  monitoring;  (b)  ensure  that, \nwhere applicable, no civil works contract will be awarded for a subproject until the \nGovernment and ADB have approved the IEE report of that particular subproject; \n(c)  minimize  any  adverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  the  Project  by  (i) \nimplementing the environmental mitigation measures recommended in the EMP, \nand  (ii)  ensuring  that  such  EMP  are  included  in  contract  documents  with \ncontractors, and that contractors implement the required mitigation measures as \ndescribed  in  the  EMP  in  a  satisfactory  manner;  (d)  ensure  that  the  EMP  is \n\n(x) \n\n\fupdated  following  the  award  of  contract  but  prior  to  commencement  of  works, \nand  undertake  regular  monitoring  to  ensure  that  all  negative  environmental \nimpacts  related  to  the  works  are  mitigated  properly;  (e)  submit  the  monitoring \nreport to ADB, and other relevant agencies, including but not limited to MLSNR; \n(f)  report  to  MLSNR  and  ADB  in  case  of  unanticipated  negative  environmental \nimpacts,  and  take  proper  action  to  mitigate  the  impacts;  (g)  provide  remedial \nmitigation measures to affected people; and (h) ensure that the contractors report \nimplementation of the EMP on a regular basis. \nGender  and  employment.  The  Government  will  require  contractors  not  to \ndifferentiate  wages  between  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value.  The \nGovernment  will  take  all  reasonable  and  necessary  steps  to  encourage  women \nliving in the project areas to participate in the implementation of the Project. This \nincludes  encouraging  contractors  to  employ  women  in  connection  with  the \nProject.  \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii)  Urban  Planning  and  Management  System.  The Government will continue the \nefforts  in  implementing  the  recommendations  in  the  UPMS,  including  continued \nsupport to the recently established PUMD. \n\n \nConditions for Grant Effectiveness \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  will  have  established  the  project  steering  committee  to  the \nsatisfaction of ADB; and \nThe  Government  will  have  appointed  the  project  manager  to  the  satisfaction  of \nADB. \n\nCondition for Disbursement \n\nB. \n \n\n \nC. \n \n\nThe  Government  will  not  make  any  withdrawals  from  (a)  the  entire  grant  account  until \nthe  project  implementation  consultants  have  been  recruited  except  for  the  withdrawals \nrelated  to  the  fielding  of  the  project  implementation  consultants,  and  (b)  the  category \nitem related to the civil works for the candidate subprojects in the grant account until the \nurban sector development plan has been approved by the cabinet. \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n70. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not \nexceeding the equivalent of $11,300,000 to the Kingdom of Tonga, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources,  for  the  Integrated  Urban  Development  Sector  Project  on  terms  and  conditions  that \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the Draft Grant Agreement presented to \nthe Board.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n      \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n \n3 May 2008\n\n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n    President \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nDesign Summary \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nData Sources / Reporting \nMechanisms \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n20 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nImpact \nImproved living \nstandards  \n\n(cid:131)  United Nations \nDevelopment \nProgramme Human \nDevelopment Index \nreports. \n\nAssumptions \n(cid:131)  Continued \n\ncommitment by \nGovernment to \nmaintain and improve \nurban infrastructure. \n\n(cid:131)  Ministry of Works traffic \n\n(cid:131)  Tonga remains \n\nsurveys. \n\npolitically stable. \n\n(cid:131)  Ministry of Health \n\nannual health statistics \n\n(cid:131)  Groundwater \n\nmonitoring data  \n\nNational Human \nDevelopment Index is \nmaintained at or increases \nfrom 0.815 during the \nperiod 2008\u20132012 \n(baseline year 2006). \n \nAverage vehicle journey \ntime for a 7-kilometer (km) \ntrip through Nuku'alofa \nduring peak hours reduces \nfrom 28 minutes to 18 \nminutes or less by 2012 \n(Baseline year 2006). \n \nReduction in number of \nreported cases of \nwaterborne diseases as \nindicated by: \n\n(i) diarrhea to less than \n1,500 by 2012 (baseline \n2,320 in 2003), \n(ii) dengue fever to less \nthan 100 by 2012 \n(baseline 194 in 2003), \n(iii) typhoid fever to less \nthan 15 by 2012 \n(baseline 23 in 2003). \n \n\nGroundwater remains safe \nfor potable use.

There \nare  only  three  urban  areas  of  significant  size,  which  are  the  capital  Nuku'alofa  on  Tongatapu \nisland,  Neiafu  in  the  Vava'u  island  group,  and  Pangai  in  the  Ha'apai  island  group.  At  the  last \ncensus in 1996, their populations were 31,290 (Nuku'alofa), 5,650 (Neiafu), and 2,966 (Pangai). \nAt that time, the population of Nuku'alofa was approximately 32% of the national population and \nabout 75% of the national urban population. \n\n2. \nAs  there  have  been  no  intercensal  population  counts  since  1996,  official  estimates  of \ncurrent  population  are  largely  conjectural.  Based  on  available  projections,  however,  the \npopulation of Nuku'alofa is considered to be approximately 34,500,1 which assumes an annual \ngrowth rate in the urban area of 0.9% between 1996 and 2006. This rate is below natural growth \nrates due to the high incidence of emigration from Nuku\u2019alofa, but it may actually underestimate \nrural-to-urban  migration.  The  recent  Nuku\u2019alofa  socioeconomic  survey  undertaken  through  the \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  revealed  that  22%  of  households  migrated  into \nNuku\u2019alofa from other areas in the last 10 years, with 11.6% migrating within the last 2 years.  2\nConversely, the socioeconomic survey confirmed a high rate of overseas migration, with 30% of \nhouseholds reporting that household members had emigrated in the last 5 years.3 \n\n3. \nAll land in Tonga belongs to the Crown and is divided between the King\u2019s land, the Royal \nFamily\u2019s  hereditary  estates,  the  nobles  and  chiefs\u2019  hereditary  estates,  and  government  land. \nThe  latter  two  estates  are  subdivided  into  allotments  for  the  rest  of  the  people  of  Tonga.  The \nland tenure regulation stipulates that every Tongan male over the age of 16 is entitled to a tax \nallotment  of  8.25  acres  for  farming,  and  a  town  allotment  of  up  to  1,618  square  meters  for \nresidential purposes, all of which is hereditary through the eldest male (heir).  \n\n4. \nPopulation growth has intensified the demand for land, and regulatory entitlements can \nno  longer  be  fulfilled.  During  the  5-year  period  to  2000,  a  10%  decline  in  town  allotment \nregistration  for  Tongatapu  suggested  that  pressure  for  space  in  Tonga\u2019s  main  commercial \ncenter is compounding the issue of land availability limitations. Leasing of land is as common as \nregistering land, and leases have different terms depending on their purposes.  \n\n5. \nNuku'alofa\u2019s  growth  is  constrained  by  both  its  geography  and  the  absence  of  land \ndevelopment procedures conducive to planned development. The urban area is bounded on the \nnorth  by  the  ocean,  to  the  east  and  west  by  wetlands,  and  to  the  southeast  and  south  by  the \nFanga'uta  Lagoon.  Other  than  furthering  development  by  increasing  development  densities  in \nthe  existing  urban  area,  the  only  direction  available  for  significant  growth  is  to  the  southwest. \nLand  to  the  southwest  is  primarily  utilized  for  agricultural  purposes,  however,  and  is  held  by \nindividuals in the form of tax allotments. \n\n6. \nThe  land  allotment  system  does  not  naturally  allow  for  private  development  on  any \nsignificant  scale,  inhibiting  land  acquisition  for  commercial  and  industrial  investment. 4   As  a \n\n                                                 \n1  Global  Works.  2006.

Integrated  Urban  Development  Project.  Technical  Report  \u2013  Social  Issues  in  Urban \n\n3  The  actual  rate  of  urbanization  will  be  more  accurately  determined  following  release  of  the  results  of  a  recent \n\ncensus conducted in December 2006. \n\n4  A government task force supported by the World Bank is currently addressing the needs of the private sector and \n\nis recommending changes to the lease regulations. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nresult,  there  is  virtually  no  urban  expansion  through  either  planned  or  speculative  schemes. \nFurthermore,  the  Government  does  not  itself  plan  or  undertake  any  form  of  guided  land \ndevelopment, other than the subdivision of the marginal lands as discussed above. Through its \nland  registration  and  allocation  role  it  authorizes  development,  but  only  in  response  to \napplications rather than through proactive initiatives. As a consequence of the limited options for \nexpansion, much recent land allocation and development has been in marginal wetland areas to \nthe east and west of the primary urban area.  \n \nB. \n\nUrban Infrastructure \n\n7. \nThe buildup of traffic in and around Nuku\u2019alofa in recent years has meant that the main \napproach  roads  to  the  urban  area,  and  roads  in  the  town  center,  are  congested. 5   This  is \nespecially  severe  around  the  public  market  and  also  in  other  areas  at  peak  office  and  school \narrival and departure hours. Traffic congestion in the town center is exacerbated by the fact that \nvehicular  access  to  the  wharves  and  industrial  sites  to  the  east  of  the  primary  urban  area  is \nrestricted, and has to pass either through or close to central commercial areas. In addition, the \nlack  of  adequate  traffic  management  in  strategic  locations  along  the  main  road  network, \nespecially in terms of off-street parking, also contributes to traffic congestion.  \n\n8. \nThe lack of adequate sidewalks alongside many of the busiest roads results in significant \nconflict between pedestrians and vehicular traffic. The situation is particularly acute during rains, \nwhen roadside ponding forces pedestrians onto the main roadways. \n\n9. \nThere is a generally low standard of road maintenance and repair. Poor sections of road \nsurface are repeatedly patched. When resurfacing does take place, a new layer of chip seal is \nlaid on top of the existing surfaces without repair to the base course in soft areas. In addition, \ndue  to  the  absence  of  adequate  road  drainage  and  poor  maintenance  of  existing  drains, \nponding is frequent along roadways or over the roadways themselves. In 1998, the Ministry of \nWorks  (MOW)  prepared  a  comprehensive  nationwide  road  improvement  program,  and \nconsiderable  work  has  been  done  in  completing  the  primary  and  secondary  roads  throughout \nNuku\u2019alofa. However, many of the roads completed prior to the 1998 plan have now exceeded \ntheir  useful  design  lives  and  again  require  resurfacing.  Furthermore,  the  surface  of  most \nlocalized residential access roads remain gravel and are badly broken and potholed. \n\n10. \nLimited  interagency  and/or  interdepartmental  coordination  means  that  inadequate \nallowance is made in many road rights-of-way for the provision of infrastructure and such public \nutilities as drainage, water, and electricity supply lines.  \n\nAt  present,  there  are  basic  drainage  systems  in  certain  areas  of  Nuku\u2019alofa,  such  as \n11. \naround  the  town  center,  along  the  foreshore,  and  in  a  number  of  small  residential  areas. \nHowever,  these  systems  do  not  function  well  due  to  siltation  and  other  forms  of  blockage, \ncoupled with a general lack of repair and maintenance. There are very limited drainage systems \nelsewhere  throughout  the  city.  As  a  result,  after  heavy  rain,  stormwater  collects  in  low  points, \nand  only  drains  into  the  ground  after  an  extended  period.  In  other  parts  of  the  city  there  are \nopen  drainage  channels  with  limited  culvert  interconnections.  These  channels  frequently  have \neither no outlets or substantially blocked outlets, resulting in stagnant water lying for days until it \neventually infiltrates or evaporates.  \n\n12. \nExtensive  swamplands  lie  within  the  Nuku\u2019alofa  urban  area,  notably  in  the  areas  of \nPopua to the east of the primary urban area and Sopu to the west. These areas have been, and \n\n                                                 \n5  A  1-day  manual  traffic  count  conducted  in  June  2006  over  an  11-hour  period  recorded  nearly  11,000  vehicle \nmovements on Taufa'ahau Road, the main artery into the urban area. This represents an increase of 270% over \nresults of a survey completed in 1999. \n\n\fAppendix 2  \n\n25 \n\ncontinue  to  be,  subdivided  into  residential  plots  to  meet  land  entitlement  pressures  under  the \nland tenure regulations. This results in ad hoc land filling and blocking of natural drainage ways.  \n\n13. \nSanitary facilities in Nuku\u2019alofa still include some pit latrines but consist primarily of flush \ntoilets  with  septic  tanks  and  vertical  soakaways.  The  TIUDP  Survey  indicates  that  84%  of  the \n431  households  surveyed  utilize  septic  tank  systems  (footnote  2).  Septic  tank  pumping \nfrequency was also found to vary markedly, ranging from weekly pumping for some downtown \nrestaurants and  other  businesses  to  several  years  in  the  case  of  residences.  Sludge  from  the \npumping  operations  is  taken  to  the  sludge  beds  at  Patangata  but  will  be  taken  to  the  new \nTapuhia  sanitary  landfill  facility  once  it  is  fully  operational.  Many  septic  tanks  are  undersized, \nand  it  is  suspected  that  numerous  tanks  may  have  been  improperly  constructed  prior  to  the \nadoption  of  formal  permit  review  procedures.  This  raises  potential  environmental  and  health \nconcerns  of  possible  surface  inundation  of  contaminated  wastewater  during  times  of  high \ngroundwater and flooding.  \n\n14. \nIt  is  also  suspected  that  current  sanitation  practices  heighten  the  potential  for \ncontamination  of  the  fragile  groundwater  aquifer  and  surrounding  nearshore  reef  and  lagoon. \nThis  is  important  because  the  island  primarily  relies  on  groundwater  resources  for  its  water \nsupply. The Tonga Water Board has reported little or no fecal coliforms in tests taken thus far, \nbut little is known of groundwater conditions and quality throughout much of the aquifer system.  \n\nAn estimated 95% of households in the urban Nuku\u2019alofa area have access to the water \n15. \nsupply  system  operated  by  the  Water  Board.  Supply  is  by  means  of  a  reticulated  system, \ndrawing  on  groundwater  from  the  Mataki\u2019eua  well  fields  about  5  kilometers  southwest  of  the \ntown center. The aquifer\u2019s salinity increases with proximity to the sea and Fanga\u2019uta Lagoon.  \n\nIn  March  2004,  AusAID  initiated  a  4-year  solid  waste  management  project  for  Tonga. \n16. \nThe  project  involves  closing  the  dump  site  at  Patangata  and  developing  a  new  landfill  at \nTapuhia with a proper liner, leachate treatment, and sludge drying beds.  \n \nC. \n\nUrban Sector Institutions \n\n17. \nIn the wake of significant government restructuring and downsizing in 2006, the roles of \nagencies  involved  in  urban  planning  and  management  are  in  a  state  of  flux.  Broadly,  the \nplanning  and  provision  of  urban  services  is  undertaken  by  MOW  (roads,  drainage,  and  major \nprojects),  Tonga  Water  Board  (water  supply),  and  Ministry  of  Civil  Aviation,  Marine  and  Ports \n(airports and ports). The latter was to be renamed the Ministry of Transport in July 2007. It will \nassume planning responsibilities for roads, while construction and maintenance will remain with \nMOW.  A  new  Waste  Management  Authority  came  into  being  in  October  2006  and  will  be \nresponsible  for  solid  waste  collection,  management,  and  disposal  under  the  guidance  of  its \nBoard.  There  are  no  centralized  sewerage  systems  in  Tonga,  and  on-plot  sanitation  has \npreviously  been  overseen  by  the  Ministry  of  Health.  It  is  understood  that  this  responsibility  is \nlikely to move to the MOW in the future.  \n\n18. \nLittle  or  no  strategic  or  urban  spatial  planning  is  being  undertaken  in  Tonga.  Strategic \nspatial planning is not within the current mandate of the Ministry of Lands, Surveys and Natural \nResources (MLSNR). The work carried out by the Department of the Environment, in terms of \nglobal  resource  management  planning  for  Tonga,  goes  some  way  toward  broad-based  spatial \nplanning. However, this activity is not currently based upon any law. \n\n19. \nThe  Central  Planning  Department,  previously  a  separate  body  reporting  to  the  Deputy \nPrime Minister, merged with the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning in early July 2006. \nThe  planning  work  undertaken  by  the  Department  and  its  associated  agencies  is  primarily \nnational  and  economic  in  nature.  A  wide  range  of  activities  that  relate  to  urban  planning  and \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nmanagement  are  being  undertaken,  albeit  in  a  rather  ad  hoc  and  uncoordinated  manner.  No \nagency in Tonga is charged with preparing spatial plans. Consequently, no plan-making takes \nplace for either urban areas or other localities. \n\n20.  With no forward planning and no plans, there are no spatial guidelines to assist decision \nmaking  on  either  strategic  or  local  development  issues,  particularly  infrastructure  investments. \nThere  is  also  no  structured  identification  of  development  issues  that  might  arise,  such  as  the \nprovision  of  urban  services.  As  described  above,  land  development  is  primarily  driven  by  the \nland tenure system. The subdivision of lots is reviewed, registered, and mapped by MLSNR, but \nthis is only in response to subdivision proposals rather than as part of an overall forward-looking \nplan. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n 27 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE URBAN SECTOR \n\n1. \nPrevious Urban Projects. As shown in Table A3, there has been only relatively limited \nassistance  from  international  multilateral  or  bilateral  donors  for  Tonga\u2019s  urban  sector. \nHistorically,  much  of  the  assistance  has  been  focused  on  rural  areas  and  the  outer  island \ngroups. \n\n2. \nIn Nuku\u2019alofa, previous projects have been mostly ad hoc and limited in scope. However, \nthere have been a number of exceptions. The Government of Japan has provided grant finance \nto a number of water supply projects including the Nuku\u2019alofa Water Supply Project in 2000. The \nNuku\u2019alofa  Urban  Roads  and  Drainage  Study  of  1993  was  funded  by  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development (AusAID) under a 9-year institutional strengthening program. Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  provided  grants  for  upgrading  of  the  road  from \nNuku\u2019alofa to the airport. The, and this includes some roadside drainage in the central business \narea.  AusAID  is  currently  providing  assistance  to  the  Government  for  reconstructing  the \nNuku'alofa's central business area that was damaged during civil unrest on 16 November 2006. \n\nCommunity  Assistance  Projects.  Several  agencies  provide  support  for  community \n3. \ninitiatives. These include village and household infrastructure, and particularly for water supply. \nThese  are  national  schemes  that  include  projects  in  the  Nuku'alofa  urban  area.  Examples  of \nthese  are  the  Tonga/Australia  Community  Assistance  Scheme  by  AusAID,  the  Grassroots \nProject by JICA, and the Community Development Fund by New Zealand\u2019s International Aid and \nDevelopment Agency (NZAID).  \n\n4. \nSolid  Waste  Management.  In  March  2004,  AusAID  initiated  a  4-year  Solid  Waste \nManagement  Project  for  Tonga.  The  project  involves  closing  the  dump  site  at  Patangata  and \ndeveloping a new landfill at Tapuhia with a proper liner, leachate treatment, and sludge drying \nbeds.  The  solid  waste  project  includes  (i)  constructing  a  sanitary  landfill  site,  (ii)  a  community \ninformation  and  participation  campaign,  (iii)  establishing  adequate  institutional  capacity  for  the \ndelivery  of  solid  waste  management  services,  (iv)  enacting  the  Waste  Management  Act  and \nestablishing  the  Waste  Management  Authority,  (v)  establishing  an  appropriate  solid  waste \ncollection  system  for  Tongatapu,  and  (vi)  setting  up  of  an  efficient  solid  waste  management \nfacility operation. \n\nNZAID is funding rehabilitation of the existing dump site at Popua, once the new landfill \n\n5. \nfacility is operational. \n\n6. \nTransport  Sector.  World  Bank  is  funding  an  ongoing  Transport,  Infrastructure  and \nAsset  Management  Reform  Project.  This  project  is  evaluating  the  transport  sector  in  Tonga, \nincluding institutional structures, regulations, policy and planning, operations management, and \nservice delivery. It is also assessing options for sustainable financing, including opportunities for \ncorporatization and privatization. \n\nWater  Supply.  Several  agencies  are  involved  in  water  supply  projects,  mostly  outside \n7. \nNuku'alofa,  particularly  the  European  Union  and  JICA.  As  noted  above,  the  Government  of \nJapan  provided  grant  assistance  for  the  improvement  of  the  Nuku\u2019alofa  Water  Supply.  The \nDanish  International  Development  Assistance  has  undertaken  an  appraisal  for  a  potential \nproject including the upgrading of parts of the Nuku\u2019alofa area distribution network. \n\n8. \n Environment  and  Sustainability.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  has \nbeen supporting the strengthening of environmental management for a number of years, and it \nhas  three  ongoing  projects  in  the  Ministry  of  Lands,  Surveys,  Natural  Resources  and \nEnvironment.  These  are  the  National  Biodiversity  Strategy  Plan,  the  Sustainable  Lands \nManagement Project, and the National Capacity for Self-Assessment Project.  \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n9. \nUrban Planning and Management. The European Union is considering the provision of \na \u20ac1.8 million technical assistance grant for Sustainable Urban and Environmental Management \nwhich has been designed in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank to complement the \nproposed Integrated Urban Development Sector Project and its associated technical assistance \nfor Urban Planning and Management. \n\nTable A3: Recent and Ongoing External Assistance Projects in the Urban Sector \n\n \n\nFunding \nAgency \n\nAusAID \n\nRoads \n\nJICA \n\nRoads \n\nSector \n\nProject Description \n\nNuku'alofa Urban Roads and Drainage \nStudy.

The \nsubproject  consists  of  two  parts:  (i)  procurement  of  equipment,  and  (ii)  cleaning  and \nrehabilitation of the drainage systems. \n \n2. \nEquipment  to  be  procured  includes  (i)  a  jet-and-vacuum  truck  with  a  capacity  of \napproximately  4.9  m3  to  enable  the  Ministry  of  Works  (MOW)  to  clean  pipe  and  culvert \nstormwater  drainage  systems,  and  (ii)  street  sweeping  equipment  to  reduce  the  frequency  of \nstormwater  drain  cleaning.  As  the  stormwater  drainage  systems  are  small,  the  equipment \nrequired can be purchased from the smaller end of the range available in the market. \n \n3. \nGiven  the  magnitude  of  the  stormwater  drainage  cleaning  operation,  required,  bids  for \nthe contract will be sought internationally and the contract will include provisions for employment \nand  training  of  local  staff  to  ensure  that  future  cleaning  operations  can  be  performed  by  local \npersonnel. The contract will also include replacement or repair of damaged system components. \n \nB. \n\nSopu Drainage Channel \n\n4. \nA  2.1-kilometer  (km),  gabion-lined  drainage  channel  extending  from  Hofoa  Road  to \nTukingapahu Road in the Sopu area will be constructed. Initially, liners of clay or concrete were \nconsidered.  Clay  was  subsequently  ruled  out  due  to  its  propensity  to  scour  during  a  large \nvolume storm event. Concrete was rejected, especially due to its high costs and constructability \nproblems that could be anticipated given the high groundwater elevations in this area. Gabions \nwere  selected  as  a  relatively  inexpensive  way  to  prevent  scouring  of  the  channel  sides  and \nbottom.  Furthermore,  as  the  gabions  are  permeable,  they  will  allow  groundwater  to  pass \nthrough the channel liner rather than exert hydrostatic pressure on the underside of the channel \nlining. Once the channel has been excavated to the desired elevation, the gabion wire baskets \nand  mats  may  be  set  in  place  and  then  filled  with  stone.  Consequently,  the  dewatering \nrequirements are greatly reduced. \n \n5. \nLevees will be installed to the outside of the top gabions along both sides of the channel \nto provide access to the channel for periodic maintenance. The elevation of the levees will be \nsimilar to existing filled lots in the area so that as allotment recipients develop the adjacent lots \nthey can fill to elevations that will allow their lots to drain without blocking drainage from the lots \nfurther away. Five concrete box culverts will be constructed to provide road crossings, including \nan  outlet  structure  at  Hofoa  Road.  The  culverts  are  1.0\u20131.2  meters  (m)  high  due  to  the \nlimitations induced by existing roads and developed lots. Consequently, most of the culverts are \nthe two-barrel type to provide sufficient flow area to accommodate the design storm event.  \n \n6. \n \nC. \n\nThe entire channel will be fenced for public safety reasons. \n\nTaufa'ahau Road Upgrade \n\n7. \nThe main feature of the subproject is the construction of a 3.1-km center turning lane on \nTaufa\u2019ahau Road from south of the Vaha\u2019akolo Road turnoff to Alaivahamama\u2019o Road. As the \nroadway nears significant intersections, the center lane will become a dedicated turning lane for \nthe  intersection.  A  center  lane  will  be  added  by  expanding  the  roadway  by  1.5  m  along  both \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nsides.  Some  minor  route  adjustments  may  be  made  to  minimize  power  pole  relocations  or \nsimilar  technical  considerations.  Repairs  will  be  made  to  the  existing  pavement  surface,  as \nrequired,  and  a  new  bituminous  surface  layer  will  be  applied  to  reseal  the  surface.  Upon \ncompletion, a rubberized paint striping system will be applied to direct traffic regarding the use \nof the lane. \n \n8. \nThe  subproject  also  includes  construction  of  sidewalks  on  both  sides  of  the  road,  as \nrequired.  Essentially,  sidewalks  are  required  on  the  eastern  side  of  the  roadway  from \nVaha\u2019akolo to Holomui and from Mateialona to the Basilica of St. Anthony of Padua and on the \nwestern side from Vaha\u2019akolo to Navy Road. The subproject also includes rehabilitation of the \nexisting stormwater collection systems, addition of a new stormwater collection system north of \nAlaivahamama'o that will discharge to the lagoon southeast of the Alaivahamama'o intersection, \nand installation of a traffic control light at the Alaivahamama'o Road intersection.  \n \n9. \nThe elevation of the existing roadway is in the range of 1.0\u20131.5 m. Consequently, there \nis inadequate vertical differential in the available topography to allow for a conventional gravity \ndrain  stormwater  collection  system.  The  system  designed  for  this  location  will  consist  of  a \ncombination  stormwater  collection  and  infiltration  system.  A  key  component  of  the  stormwater \nsystem consists of three-chambered silt separation boxes to allow for removal of sand, silt, and \ndebris  from  the  stormwater  prior  to  entering  the  interconnecting  infiltration  chambers.  An  inlet \nbox will be constructed directly across the street from each silt separation box to collect runoff \nfrom that side of the street. A reinforced concrete pipe culvert will cross the street to bring flows \nto the infiltration system. The infiltration chambers will be installed below the sidewalks on one \nside of the road.  \n \nD. \n\nAlaivahamama'o Road Upgrade \n\n10. \nThe  subproject  involves  resurfacing  Alaivahamama\u2019o  Road  from  the  intersection  with \nVaha\u2019akolo  Road  to  the  intersection  with  Tupoulahi  Road  and  constructing  sidewalks  on  both \nsides  of  the  road  from  Vaha\u2019akolo  Road  to  Fatafehi  Road  and  the  northern  side  of \nAlaivahamama'o  Road  from  Fatafehi  Road  to  Tupoulahi  Road.  A  sidewalk  will  also  be \nconstructed  from  the  intersection  of  Alaivahamama'o  Road  and  Fatafehi  Road  to  the \nCommunity Development Center (formerly Tonga High School) located on Fatafehi Road. \n \n11. \nIn  addition  to  adding  sidewalks  and  resurfacing  the  roadway,  the  stormwater  drainage \nsystem will be upgraded. This upgrade entails reshaping existing drainage ditches on the north \nside  of  the  road  west  of  Taufa\u2019ahau  and  on  the  south  side  in  front  of  the  Ministry  of  Works \nheadquarters. The drainage ditches on the south side of the road east of Taufa\u2019ahau Road will \nbe rehabilitated along with the ditch and outfall running south to a discharge point in the lagoon. \nA  subsurface  drain-line  will  be  constructed  to  connect  the  western  drainage  ditches  to  the \nexisting  ditch  on  the  southeast  corner  of  the  Taufa\u2019ahau  intersection,  and  the  existing  culvert \ncrossing  at  Fatafehi  Road  will  be  rehabilitated  to  address  ponding  in  that  vicinity.  New  storm \ninlets and silt separation boxes will be constructed on the north side of Alaivahamama'o Road in \nthe low points between Fatafehi Road and Tupoulahi Road and interconnected with subsurface \ninfiltration chambers. Any excess flow in the infiltration chambers will discharge into the existing \nbox culvert and outlet located around 80 m west of Tupoulahi Road. \n \nE. \n\nVaha'akolo Road Upgrade \n\n12. \nVaha\u2019akolo Road is used as an alternate route into the town center from the south. The \nroad has far exceeded its design life and is subjected to a continual cycle of pothole patching. \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\nThe  entire  roadway  requires  resurfacing.  To  properly  accomplish  this,  the  surface  must  be \nscarified,  the  sub-base  repaired  as  needed,  and  new  surface  layers  applied.  In  addition,  the \nsubproject  will  rehabilitate  the  stormwater  drains  and  culverts  in  the  vicinity  of  Tupou  High \nSchool  and  will  provide  sidewalks  from  the  school  to  the  Vaha\u2019akolo  Road  and  By-Pass \nintersection.  The  length  of  the  road  subject  to  surface  restoration  is  4,600  m.  In  addition, \napproximately  800  m  of  stormwater  drains  will  be  rehabilitated  and  800  m  of  sidewalk  will  be \nconstructed. \n \nF. \n\nPopua and Sopu Secondary and Access Roads \n\n13. \nThe subproject entails repairs and surface refurbishment, as well as extension of about 4 \nkm of secondary and access roads in the Sopu and Popua areas. These roads will consist of \nbase  rock  pushed  along  the  alignments  to  an  elevation  sufficient  to  provide  drainage  swales \nalong  the  roadways  as  the  lots  are  filled  adjacent  to  the  roadways.  In  Popua,  the  selected \nelevation is 2.8 m above mean sea level. Thus, the road surface will be 1.0 m above the highest \nastronomical tide of 1.5 m plus another 0.3 m for sea surge. Due to the distance inland of the \nSopu  area,  much  of  the  tidal  influence  is  attenuated  and  sea  surge  is  generally  not  a  factor. \nConsequently,  the  usual  water  surface  elevation  adjacent  to  Hofoa  Road  is  anticipated  to  be \naround 0.0 above mean sea level. Therefore the required elevation of the access roads in the \nSopu region is only 1.0 m above mean sea level. \n \nGroundwater Monitoring Well Program \n\nG. \n\n14. \nThe subproject consists of installing eight monitoring wells. This includes three wells in \nstrategic locations between Vuna Road and the nearshore reef, two monitoring wells between \nAlaivahamama\u2019o Road and the lagoon, and two wells between Taufa\u2019ahau Road and the lagoon. \nOne  monitoring  well  in  the  well  field  area  will  also  be  installed  to  provide  background  data  to \ncompare  to  the  coastal  findings.  Collected  monthly  samples  from  the  monitoring  wells  will  be \nanalyzed  for  a  range  of  parameters,  including  the  following:  (i)  total  phosphorous  (TP),  (ii) \northophosphate (Ortho-P), (iii) ammonia (NH4), (iv) total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), (v) E. coli, and \n(vi) total coliforms. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n \n\n \n\nT$'000\n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n$\u2019000   \n\nForeign \nExchange\n\nLocal \nCurrency\n\nTotal \nCost \n\n \n\nForeign \nExchange\n\nLocal \nCurrency\n\nTotal \nCost \n\nItem \n\n  \n\n  \n\nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nInvestment Costsa \n1.

Tonga has made progress toward achieving many of the \ntargets in the Millennium Development Goals and access to safe water is widespread. \n \nAs  Tonga\u2019s  economic  growth  prospects  improve,  so  will  pressure  on  urban  areas,  especially  Nuku\u2019alofa.  It  is \nforecast  that  Nuku\u2019alofa  will  have  to  accommodate  up  to  1,000  new  households  during  2007\u20132020.  The \nConstitution of Tonga provides for allocation of land to every adult male citizen in both the town (town allotments) \nand rural areas (tax allotments). With growing urbanization, it has become increasingly difficult for the Government \nto meet this obligation, and it often must provide marginal land. Growing demand for town allotments in urban areas \nhas forced urban expansion onto wetlands. It is estimated that there are more than 1,000 households already living \nin the wetlands. Hundreds more such allotments have been made but not yet occupied. As a result, many people in \nNuku\u2019alofa live in low-lying areas unsuitable for housing. With decreasing availability of suitable land and a rapidly \ngrowing urban population, social services in Nuku\u2019alofa are deteriorating and sanitation, drainage, roads, and waste \ndisposal  need  attention.  Coupled  with  recurring  flooding  in  the  low-lying  areas,  health  and  social  indicators  are \ndeclining. Tonga\u2019s limited land resources, combined with the growing urban population, are increasing pressure on \nNuku\u2019alofa\u2019s  living  conditions.  The  Government  acknowledges  that  in  order  to  sustain  growth,  health,  education, \nwater  and  sanitation,  physical  infrastructure,  and  the  environment  must  be  improved.  With  improved  urban \nservices, the Project will give lower income groups access to higher quality land and reduce the threat of flooding.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nA  detailed  social  and  poverty  analysis  was  completed  under  TA4648-TON. 1   The  analysis  identified  that  a \nsignificant  proportion  of  a  random  sample  of  urban  households  faced  economic  hardship.  In  the  sample  of  431 \nhouseholds,  3.4%  had  incomes  of  less  than  T$50  per  week,  23.8%  had  T$50\u2013T$100  per  week,  and  42.2%  had \nT$101\u2013T$300  per  week.  (ADB\u2019s  poverty  assessment  in  2003  estimated  that  the  basic  needs  poverty  line  was \nT$28.18 per capita per week and the food poverty line was T$13.52. Using an average household size of seven, \nthis equates to household incomes of T$197 and T$95 per week, respectively). In the sample households, 43.8% \nhad  no  access  to  agricultural  land.  Those  households  in  greatest  need  are  living  in  low-lying  areas,  and  it  is \nestimated that over 1,000 households reside in these areas in Popua and Sopu. Further, many allotments allocated \nby the Government in wetland areas are being filled but are not yet occupied. Because of the cost of fill material, \nreclaiming the wetlands takes low-income families many years to achieve and typically requires them to mortgage \nthe lot to pay for the improvements. The prevalence of poverty is notably higher among the residents of these areas \nthan for urban households overall. The selected infrastructure projects for improvements in roads and drainage will \nbenefit  the  poor,  and  particularly  those  residing  in  low-lying  areas,  by  improving  the  overall  conditions  and \nstandards of drainage and public health. The project  components were developed based on the detailed poverty \nanalysis conducted through various participatory approaches during the project preparatory stage. During project \nimplementation, the project management unit will be responsible to ensure that the findings of the poverty analysis \nremain valid. This will be achieved through an ongoing program of household sampling and interviews. The project \nperformance management system will include indicators to assist in monitoring the Project's impact on poverty.  \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006 Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Tonga for Preparing the Tonga Integrated Urban Development \n\nProject. Manila (TA 4648-TON). \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n\n  Yes   \n\n    No  \n\nThe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  employed  a  participatory  approach,  engaging  with  a  wide \nvariety of stakeholders throughout the country. The social assessment component was based on (i) 16 workshops \nthat  altogether  included  over  300  participants  on  community  needs  assessment  and  involved  particular  interest \ngroups, women, youth, and community leaders, as well as church leaders in 'Eua, Ha\u2019apai, Tongatapu, and Vava\u2019u; \nand  (ii)  a  socioeconomic  survey  of  431  randomly  selected  households  in  Nuku\u2019alofa.  A  detailed  Report  of  the \nParticipatory  Assessment  of  Social  Needs  has  been  produced  by  the  Integrated  Urban  Development  Sector \nProject.  \n\nA workshop on household and community development needs was held with representatives of communities in the \nlow-lying and generally low-income areas of Patangata, Popua, and Sopu. Participants in this workshop identified \ndrainage and land access issues as major concerns, along with water supply and sanitation. The lack of community \nspaces,  fencing  and  animal  control,  and  education  facilities,  as  well  as  the  quality  of  housing  and  lack  of  health \nfacilities in the area were also common concerns. Solutions identified to resolve those issues ranged from improved \ninfrastructure, such as water supply, sanitation, housing, roads, and electricity, to such other infrastructure as public \nspaces,  sports  facilities,  and  community  centers.  Other  solutions  included  improvements  in  fencing  and  animal \nmanagement, the aesthetics of the community, drainage, waste control, and programs for youth. \n\nThe  construction  of  the  Sopu  Drainage  Channel  under  the  drainage  component  will  be  conducted  in  close \nconsultation with the affected residents, who have already approved the design concept and will be consulted again \nbefore the design is finalized. Road improvements will not require a participation strategy as the easements already \nexist and there is strong support from stakeholders for the proposed road improvements. The monitoring wells have \nno participation implications.  \n\nIs there a participation strategy? \n\n   Yes                 \n\n   No    \n\nAn environment and social unit (ESU) will be created within MOW and will be established within 3 months of grant \neffectiveness.  The unit will be responsible, among others, for public relations and consultation. \n\n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nTonga  has  many  nongovernment  organizations  that  work  mainly  with  women  on  household  improvement  and \nincome  generation  assistance.  These  women\u2019s  organizations  were  consulted  during  PPTA  fact-finding  and \nidentified  for  membership  on  the  TA  Steering  Committee.  Gender  analysis  was  conducted  during  the  PPTA  to \nidentify  strategies  for  addressing  gender  issues.  Workshops  on  community  and  development  needs  involved \nleaders of women\u2019s nongovernmental organizations and representatives of the women\u2019s community. More than half \nof the people interviewed for a household survey of Nuku\u2019alofa on socioeconomic, social service, and infrastructure \nissues were women. The workshops and survey revealed that women and men share most of the same concerns, \nsuch  as  cost  of  living,  landlessness,  and  unemployment  (particularly  of  young  people).  These  found  many  low-\nincome households in Nuku'alofa are supported by women's earnings from raising pigs, growing vegetables, and \nmaking tapa cloth and mats for sale.  \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes  \n\n   No     \n\nNo gender strategy is required. Urban road improvements will not require a gender strategy, as the upgrading and \ndrainage  will  benefit  both  men  and  women  alike,  including  those  living  near  the  roads  or  using  the  roads  as \npedestrians or motorists. Male and female beneficiaries of the Sopu Drainage Channel, as well as other holders of \nregistered leases and allotments resident in Tonga, have been consulted at each stage of the conceptual design. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fConcerns expressed by women and men are addressed in the Short Resettlement Plan. \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n41 \n\nE.

The  conceptual  engineering  design  of  the  Sopu \nDrainage Channel indicates a total of 46 parcels of mainly \nresidential  land,  of  which  eight  are  occupied,  will  lose \nportions of land. The total area of land that will need to be \npermanently  acquired  is  estimated  at  7,500  m2.  About \n5,000 m2 will be acquired on a temporary basis for storing \nconstruction equipment and materials and for a temporary \nspoil  stockpiling  area.  No  physical  resettlement  will  be \nrequired  for  the  Sopu  channel  activity  or  for  any  of  the \nother  components.  A  short  resettlement  plan  will  be \nprepared  nevertheless  to  demonstrate  how  landholders \nwill be compensated for loss of land and trees. The other \ncomponents  of  the  Project  (road  rehabilitation  and  the \nmonitoring wells) will not lead to any physical relocation or \ndevelop  new  rights-of-way.  All  construction  will  be  within \nexisting rights-of-way or on uninhabited government land. \n \nThe  Sopu  area  will  be  resurveyed  prior  to  construction \nand  all  landholders  will  be  compensated  in  accordance \nwith  the  provisions  of  the  Short  Land  Acquisition  and \nResettlement Plan. \nfor \nThere  are  no  affordability \ncomponents  of \nthe  Project,  namely \nimprovements and Sopu Drainage Channel.  \n \n \n\nthe  major \nroad \nthe \n\nissues \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\nThe  Project  will  create  employment  through  the  works \ncontracts \nroads,  drainage  channel,  and \ngroundwater  monitoring  program.

The  Integrated  Urban  Development  Sector  Project  will \ncontribute  (through  flood  mitigation  measures  in  low-lying  and  low-income  residential  areas; \nimproved major road arteries; reduced vehicular-pedestrian conflicts; rehabilitated and extended \nroadside  drainage;  extended,  repaired,  and  sealed  access  roads  in  low-lying  residential  areas; \nand  enhanced  monitoring  of  groundwater  quality)  to  the  improvement  of  urban  infrastructure  in \nNuku\u2019alofa,  the  country\u2019s  national  capital  and  largest  urban  area.  The  Project,  which  will  be \nimplemented  by  the  Ministry  of  Works  (MOW),  will  also  enhance  capacities  in  urban  planning, \nproject management, and maintenance. The Project will be financed under an Asian Development \nBank (ADB) grant with counterpart funding from the Government. \n \n2. \nThis  short  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP)  has  been  prepared  in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement \nPolicy  (1995)  for  the  Sopu  Drainage  Channel  Subproject.  The  LARP  was  prepared  following \nsurveys and investigations of preliminary technical designs and will be updated during detailed \ntechnical design. \n \nB. \n\nScope of Resettlement Impacts \n\n3.   \nThe  Subproject  will  include  constructing  a  2.1-km  drainage  channel  through  a  mainly \nresidential  area  comprising  both  developed  (reclaimed)  and  undeveloped  land  parcels.  As  the \narea is developed for housing and land is filled, undeveloped blocks are subject to ponding of \ntrapped water. The Sopu Drainage Channel will connect the largest isolated open water areas \nto  the  watershed  outlet,  allowing  these  areas  to  periodically  flush  during  rain  storms,  thereby \nreducing the health hazards they  presently induce. It will also provide a drainage route during \nstorms  to  counter  runoff\u2019s  backing  up  into  existing  homes.  Further,  the  drainage  channel  will \nestablish a legal drainage easement within which no further construction will take place. It has \nbeen  recommended  that  as  the  road  network  in  this  area  is  expanded  there  should  be \nprovisions for a stormwater collection system with outlets terminating in the proposed channel. \n \nThe  drainage  channel\u2019s original  design  would  have  affected  48  land  parcels  and  might \n4. \nhave  resulted  in  relocating  two  or  three  households.  After  careful  consideration,  the  channel \ndesign was realigned so that only 46 land parcels are affected and no physical resettlement will \nbe required. The drainage channel\u2019s alignment has been carefully designed to minimize loss to \ndeveloped  properties  by  following  subdivision  boundaries.  The  channel  will  be  constructed  on \ninundated swampland characterized by large bodies of open water with poor quality mangroves \nand other aquatic weeds. In most cases, the design takes a slice of land from parcels of land on \neither  side  of  the  boundary.  Of  the  46  affected  parcels,  8  are  reclaimed  and  have  structures, \nanother  8  are  reclaimed  or  partly  reclaimed  but  unoccupied,  and  the  remaining  30  are \nun-reclaimed.  There  are  no  crops  or  fruit  trees  planted  within  the  vicinity  of  the  proposed \nchannel  due  to  the  swampy  nature  of  the  area,  and  the  number  of  affected  trees  is  therefore \nvery limited. Due to its nature, the area is also not used for any livelihoods. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n43 \n\nBefore the final design is completed, the land will be resurveyed so that residential lots \n5. \ncan be realigned to ensure that their reduction in size does not fall below the minimum permitted \narea. All affected landholders will be compensated for loss of land, crops, and trees. \n \nC. \n\nResettlement Plan Objectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements \n\n1. \n\nEligibility Criteria and Types of Losses \n\n \nA  detailed  measurement  survey  will  be  used  to  identify  eligible  households  and \n6. \nindividuals, and the cutoff date associated with it (the end of the survey) is used to discourage \nany party from taking improper advantage of the compensation measures. People moving into \nthe area or starting to use resources after the cutoff date are not eligible for compensation and \nlivelihood  restoration.  Eligible  households  and  individuals  have  the  entitlements  discussed \nbelow. \n \n\n7. \nTemporary Loss of Land. No compensation will be paid for temporary loss of land, but \nan annual lease of 15% of the value of the affected land will be paid to the landowner before the \nstart of civil works. After the use, the land will be restored to its original condition or improved \nand then returned to the landholder. For affected leaseholders and users without land titles, an \neasement fee of 15% of the value of the affected land will be paid before the start of civil works.  \n \n8. \nPermanent  Loss  of  Land.  For  construction  sites  and  permanently  used  land,  cash \ncompensation for the affected portion of land will be paid to the landholder before the start of civil \nworks. At the time of elaborating this LARP, the market value was determined by the Ministry of \nLand to be T$25 per square meter (m2) for improved land and T$7.14 for unimproved land. The \nvalues  will  be  updated  based  on  the  detailed  measurement  survey.  If  the  remaining  portion  of \naffected land is no longer viable for continuous use, compensation at replacement value for the \nentire land will be provided and\u2014if the landholder so requests\u2014assistance to find a similar piece \nof  land.  All  transaction  costs  associated  with  landownership  transfer  or  establishing  lease \nagreements will be borne by the Project. Affected leaseholders and untitled users will be assisted \nto find similar pieces of land and all transaction and moving costs will be borne by the Project. \n\nLoss of Crops and Trees. For loss of annual crops on land temporarily or permanently \n9. \nused, cash compensation equivalent to the market value of each crop at the time of anticipated \nharvest  will  be  paid  to  the  crops\u2019  owner  (who  does  not  need  to  be  the  owner  or  leaser  of  the \nland). For the loss of other crops and trees, cash compensation will be paid to the owner of the \ncrops and trees (who need not be the owner of the land). In updating the LARP, the MOW and \nMinistry  of  Lands,  Survey,  Natural  Resources  and  Environment  will  fine-tune  compensation \nrates along with the affected persons for the different species, types, ages, and productivities. \n\nSpecial  Assistance  for  Vulnerable  Populations.  The  Project  will  pay  particular \n10. \nattention  to  the  needs  of  vulnerable  groups,  and  especially  those  below  the  poverty  line,  the \nlandless,  the  elderly,  women  and  children,  indigenous  peoples,  or  persons  without  legal \nentitlements and ensure that their living standards are enhanced.  \n\n11. \n\nA matrix summarizing the compensation and entitlements is shown in Table A10.4. \n\nDisclosure, Consultation, and Grievance Mechanism \n\nD. \n \n12. \nAll affected households were consulted twice\u2014first for the original proposed design, and \nsecondly  after  the  design  was  amended  to  minimize  resettlement  impacts.  Both  men  and \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\nwomen  were  consulted,  and  all  expressed  appreciation  for  the  proposed  Sopu  Drainage \nChannel.  In  addition,  the  town  officers  responsible  for  each  community  were  briefed  on  the \nproposed plan and invited to comment. The draft LARP was distributed in the Tongan language \nto all affected persons who could be contacted and explained orally in the Tongan language. \n \nE. \n\nGrievance Redress Mechanisms \n\n13. \nAny grievances or complaints from the affected people shall be resolved by the Project in \na  timely  and  satisfactory  manner.  While  the  Land  Act  suggests  that  grievances  should  be \naddressed through the Land Court, the project grievance redress mechanism (Table A10.1) has \nbeen  specifically  designed,  where  possible,    to  resolve  grievances  while  avoiding  recourse \nthrough the Land Court and to utilize existing structures within Tonga for dispute resolution.  \n \n\nTable A10.1: Grievance Redress Framework \n \n\nTime Frame \n\nProcess \nAffected person submits grievance to village fono in person or \nthrough Town Officer. \nTown Officer deals with grievance and reports back to \naffected person. \nIf unresolved, \naffected person and/or Town Officer take grievance to \nIUDSP environment and social unit\u2019s resettlement and/or \ncommunity liaison officer. \nissue is discussed at TIUDSP liaison meeting. \nTIUDP community liaison officer reports back to Town Officer \nand/or affected person. \nIf unresolved, \naffected person takes grievance to Minister. \n\n \n\n2 days \n\n1 week \n2 days \n\nMinister refers matter to internal committee meeting. \nMinister's representative reports back to affected person. \nIf unresolved,  \naffected person has the right to take the matter to the Land \nCourt. \n\nIUDP = Integrated Urban Development Sector Project. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \nWithin 2 weeks of receipt of decision in \nStep 2 \n\n \nWithin 2 weeks of receipt of decision in \nStep 5 \n2 weeks \n2 days \n \nWithin 1 month of receipt of decision in \nStep 8 \n\n \nAll  costs  incurred  in  addressing  grievances  and  dispute  resolution  will  be  borne  by  the \n14. \nGovernment.  Affected  persons  are  also  entitled  to  compensation  for  loss  of  income  or  any  other \nexpenses (such as transportation) that they may incur in the process of resolving their grievances. \n \nF. \n\nSocial Impact Assessment \n\n15.  While in Nuku'alofa as a whole about 27% of households are in the two lowest income \ncategories  (including  3%  reporting  \u201cno  regular  income\u201d),  in  Sopu-Kolomotu'a  over  55%  of \nhouseholds are in these categories. The main income sources are employment in government, \noverseas  remittances  and,  among  those  with  very  low  incomes,  from  raising  pigs  and  making \ntapa cloth and mats for sale. In Nuku'alofa as a whole approximately 20% of houses are built of \nconcrete or brick, but in the Sopu area this figure is below 10%. Some 88% of Sopu households \nreported  informally  disposing  of  solid  waste  in  the  swamp,  bush,  or  sea.  The  overall  figure  is \nmuch lower.  \n \n\nStage \n1. \n\n2. \n\n \n3a. \n\n3b. \n3c. \n\n \n4a. \n\n4b. \n4c. \n \n5. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n45 \n\nTwice  as  many  households  in  the  Sopu  area  are  headed  by  women.  Female-headed \n16. \nhouseholds  are  more  likely  to  have  low  incomes,  because  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  paid \nlabor force, and especially in better paid occupations, is lower than men's, and because many \nwomen  heading  households  are  elderly  and  dependent  on  their  children  or  other  relatives  for \nsupport.  As  women  have  no  legal  means  to  own  land,  their  access  to  subsistence  and/or \ncommercial  farming  is  limited.  One  female-headed  household  will  lose  land  as  a  result  of  the \nchannel\u2019s construction. \n \nG. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n17.  MOW  will  undertake  monthly  monitoring  of  the  resettlement  plan  implementation.  In \ncarrying out all activities related to monitoring, evaluation, and supervision, consideration will be \ngiven to gender issues in accordance with the ADB Policy on Gender and Development (1998) \nand the Gender Checklist: Resettlement (2003). \n \n18. \n\nThe following indicators will be monitored regularly:  \n(i) \n\npayment  of  compensation  to  affected  persons  in  various  categories  with  no \ndiscrimination according to gender, ethnicity, or any other factor; \npublic information dissemination and consultation procedures;  \nadherence to grievance procedures, outstanding issues requiring management\u2019s \nattention, and equality of access;  \nattention given to affected persons\u2019 priorities with regard to options offered; and  \nCoordination  and  completion  of  resettlement  activities  and  award  of  civil  works \ncontracts. \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n \nH. \n\nResettlement Costs \n\n19. \nADB  involuntary  resettlement  policy  requires  that  where  involuntary  resettlement  is \nunavoidable affected persons must receive assistance so that they would be at least as well off \nas  they  would  have  been  in  the  absence  of  the  Project.  Therefore,  compensation  for  loss  of \nassets must be at least equal to or greater than the replacement cost of the asset. Records of \nrecent lease sales by landholders in the Sopu area have been used as a guideline for assessing \ncompensation for loss of land. The recent registered sale price for an improved (reclaimed) plot \nof  residential  land  measuring  758  m2  in  the  Sopu  area  was  T$25.00  per  square  meter  (or \nT$18,950  for  the  plot).  The  value  of  unimproved  swampland  is  estimated  at  approximately \nT$7.19  per  m2.  For  unimproved  swampland  classified  as  agricultural  land,  the  same  valuation \nwould  apply  since  these  parcels  of  land  are  unsuitable  for  agricultural  use  and  will  likely  be \nsubdivided into residential allotments. \n \n20. \nThe  values  of  trees  and  crops  will  be  calculated  on  the  basis  of  market  rates.  The \nMinistry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry\u2019s  standard  rates  will  be  adopted  as  a  guide  for  estimating \nbudget  requirements.  Where  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  standard  rates  for  a  specific \nspecies of tree do not exist, the tree will by valued by its potential utility (i.e., whether it can be \nused for timber or posts). Standing trees within the affected area will be categorized into three \nsizes,  namely  small  (100  mm),  medium  (150  mm),  and  large  (200  mm  or  more).  Rates  upon \nwhich to base compensation estimates for such trees are available from Tonga Timber Limited. \n \n21. \nThe  Government  has  agreed  to  pay  compensation  for  land  or  assets  lost  due  to \nconstructing the Sopu Drainage Channel. During detailed design, the channel alignment will be \nselected  to minimize  the  need  for land  acquisition  and  loss  of  assets. As  most  of the  affected \nlots are unoccupied, there is potential to realign lot boundaries to ensure none are smaller than \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\nthe minimum legal requirement of 758 m2. The amount of compensation payable for the loss of \nland  will  not  be  limited  to  the  market  value  of  the  land  itself  and  will  include  all  consequential \nlosses  suffered  by  the affected  holder  as  a  result  of  the compulsory  acquisition.  For  the  Sopu \nDrain Project impact area, the preferred means of compensation is in cash. \n \n22. \nThe estimate of the total compensation budget is shown in Table A10.2. It is important to \nnote that this is based on preliminary designs and surveys and will change after detailed design.  \n\nTable A10.2: Estimated Budget for Compensation \n\nItem for Compensation \n\nRegistered, Leased, and Allocated Lots \nImprovements  \nTrees \nTotal Indicative Budget for Compensation \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nNumber \n\n46 \n1 \n481 \n\nAmount T$ \n208,555.32  \n3,000.00  \n12,764.55  \n224,319.87 \n\nImplementation Arrangements and Schedule \n \n1. \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\n23. \nAn environment and social unit (ESU) will be formed within the project management unit \nto be formed by the MOW to implement the Project. The ESU will be responsible for planning, \nimplementing, and coordinating land acquisition, resettlement, and environmental activities. The \nESU will be staffed by a land acquisition and community relations officer and an environmental \nofficer.  The  Crown  Law  Department  will  provide  overall  guidance  on  the  Government\u2019s \nrequirements  and  legal  issues  relating  to  land  acquisition.  The  operations  of  the  ESU  may  be \nfinanced through grant funds for the duration of project implementation.  \n\nAll  resettlement  activities,  including  full  payment  of  compensation  entitlements  and \n24. \nrealignment  of \nindicative \nlot  boundaries,  will  be  completed  before  construction.  An \nimplementation  schedule  for  resettlement  activities  is  presented  in  Table  A10.3.

The IEE was prepared in accordance with the Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and complies with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002).  It  takes  into  consideration  the  government  environmental  act \n(2003).1  This  summary  IEE  outlines  the  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  IEE  concerning \nimprovement  and  reconstruction  of  drainage  systems,  road  rehabilitation,  and  installation  of \nwater quality monitoring wells.  \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nB. \n \n2. \nThe overall objective of the Integrated Urban Development Sector Project (IUDSP) is to \nimprove rundown urban infrastructure assets identified during the IUDSP consultation process. \nSeven core subprojects have been selected. All of the subprojects involve minor civil works and \nare located in urban areas surrounding Nuku\u2019alofa. \n \n3. \nThe  core  subprojects  have  been  selected  from  a  long  list  prepared  during  project \npreparation  and  confirmed  by  the  Government.  The  seven  subprojects  are  briefly  described \nbelow: \n\nTable A11.1: Integrated Urban Development Sector Project Core Subprojects \n\nDrainage Work \n\nCentral  District  Drainage \nSystem  Cleaning  and \nRepair  \n\nDescription \nImprovement  and  rehabilitation  of  the  existing  drainage  system  in  the  central \ncommercial  area  of  Nuku\u2019alofa  and  along  the  main  sea  frontage  of  Vuna  Road. \nMaintenance  of  the  structures  will  be  facilitated  by  the  purchase  of  street  sweeping \nequipment and a jet-and-vacuum truck to clean stormwater drains. \n\nSopu Drainage Channel \n\nExcavation  and  construction  of  a  gabion-lined  drainage  channel  through  the  low-lying \narea  of  Sopu,  which  will  drain  currently  impounded  water  within  residential  areas  to  a \nnearby coastal swamp area.

Construction  will  be  undertaken  by  contractors.  Work  is  planned  for  a \n3-year period commencing in December 2007. \n \nC.  \n \n \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nPhysical Resources \n\n1. \n\n5. \nThe  Project  is  located  in  the  capital  Nuku\u2019alofa  (population  34,000)  on  the  island  of \nTongatapu, which at 260 km2 is Tonga\u2019s largest island. Most of the island is less than 17 meters \nabove sea level. The land is lowest in the northwest and rises very gradually towards the south \nand east. Nuku\u2019alofa is situated at the low northern shore of Tongatapu, and most of the town is \n1\u20132 meters above sea level. Large areas such as Sopu, Popua, Ngele\u2019ia, and Kolofo\u2019ou are less \nthan 1 meter above sea level. \n\n6. \nThe Tongan Archipelago is a seismically active region. Tremors with magnitudes of 3 to \n4  on  the  Richter  scale  are  frequent.  Major  earthquakes  (>7  on  the  Richter  scale)  occurred  in \nTonga in 1853, 1865, 1881, 1908, 1977 and 2006. \n\nCyclones commonly occur between November and April, on average 1.3 times per year. \n\n7. \nCyclones causing serious damage occur approximately once every 10 years. \n\nGroundwater is plentiful throughout the islands and occurs as a thick lens of freshwater \n8. \nsituated  on  a  highly  porous  limestone  substrate.  Drinking  water  is  either  pumped  from \ngroundwater  or  caught  and  stored  in  tanks  as  rainwater.  Nuku\u2019alofa\u2019s  municipal  water  supply \ncomes from the Mataki\u2019eua well field, the extraction from which is well within a sustainable level.  \n \n2. \n \n9. \n The  Project  is  situated  in  a  low-lying  area  of  Nuku\u2019alofa  that  is  bounded  by  sensitive \ncoastal  areas  comprising  the  foreshore  on  the  north  and  the  Fanga\u2019uta  Lagoon  located \nimmediately to the south. The coastal resources provide an important source of livelihood for a \nlarge number of people, primarily for subsistence, but also as a limited source of cash income. \n\nEcological Resources \n\nThe  27  square  kilometer  (km2)  Fanga\u2019uta  Lagoon  is  a  major  feature  and  an  important \n10. \nfisheries habitat yielding a wide range of marine products. The lagoon is increasingly threatened \nby numerous problems arising from poorly planned urban development. These include pollution, \nhabitat  destruction,  and  overfishing.  While  Fanga\u2019uta  Lagoon  has  been  declared  a  National \nMarine Reserve under the Parks and Reserves Act of 1976, protection measures do not appear \nto be effective.  \n \n \n \nThe  seven  core  subprojects  will  serve  Nuku\u2019alofa  and  its  immediate  environs.  The \n11. \nsubprojects  will  rehabilitate  roads  and  improve  drainage  systems.  Requiring  rehabilitation  are \nprimary  and  secondary  roads  that  are  now  unable  to  cope  with  increased  traffic  volumes  and \nare often badly broken and potholed. As no sidewalks are provided, pedestrians are required to \nwalk  on the  roads.  The  town  has  no  organized  drainage  system.  After  heavy  rain,  stormwater \ncollects in low points and thereafter may take 2\u20133 days to drain into the ground.  \n\nHuman and Economic Development \n\n3. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n \n\nThere is no sewerage system in Nuku\u2019alofa. Septic tanks of varying quality are used and \n12. \nthese  drain  to  the  groundwater.  Groundwater  quality  is  considered  to  be  deteriorating  from \nseptic  tank  effluent  and  as  the  tanks  are  located  close  to  the  municipal  town  water  supply, \nFanga\u2019uta  Lagoon,  and  the  foreshores,  there  are  concerns  whether  the  area  can  maintain \nacceptable groundwater quality.  \n \n13.  While  Tonga\u2019s  economy  can  be  said  to  be  based  in  agriculture,  also  important  are \nremittances from abroad. In 2003\u20132004, these compromised 48.5% of GDP.  \n \n \n \n14. \nThe project area has a well-developed infrastructure of health and educational facilities. \nThe  national  hospital  is  located  in  Nuku\u2019alofa,  as  are  private  health  and  educational  facilities. \nNuku\u2019alofa is supplied with electricity and reticulated water. Its road system is well developed. \n \nD.  \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nQuality of Life Values and the Sociocultural Environment \n\n4. \n\n \n\n1. \n\nDesign and Preconstruction Phase Considerations \n\n15. \nDuring  the  design  and  preconstruction  phase,  attention  has  been  given  to  mitigating \nconcerns  through  environmentally  sound  subproject  designs,  elements  of  which  include  (i) \nensuring subproject activities do not intrude into environmentally sensitive areas of the lagoon \nand  foreshore,  (ii)  ensuring  surface  runoff  does  not  discharge  directly  to  these  areas  by \nensuring  that  roads  have  adequate  cross  drainage  leading  to  groundwater  infiltration  areas \nrather than using conventional piped drainage systems, (iii) including pedestrian pavements and \nturning lanes in road design to improve road safety, (iv) preparing maintenance procedures to \nensure drainage systems continue to function as planned, and (v) paying compensation for any \nloss  of  private  property.  These  conditions  are  included  in  the  attached  environmental \nmanagement  and  monitoring  plan  and  will  be  addressed  by  MOW  during  design  and  contract \npreparation. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures during Construction  \n\ninclude  (i)  planning \n\n16.  Mitigation  measures  associated  with  construction \nto  avoid \nconstruction impacts in the environmentally sensitive lagoon and foreshore areas; (ii) excavating \nand  removing  road  sub-base  and  incompetent  channel  material  to  approved  waste  material \ndump  sites  or,  if  the  material  is  to  be  reused,  stockpiling  it  securely;  (iii)  controlling  sediment \nfrom  excavated  areas  so  sediment  does  not  enter  environmentally  sensitive  areas,  including \npriority  installation  of  sediment  and  infiltration  systems  to  trap  sediments  on  road  construction \nsites; (iv) supervising haulage of construction materials so dust and community road safety risk \nare  minimized;  (v)  using  best  industry  practices  in  storing  and  handling  fuel  and  lubricants \n(including  to  have  a  mandatory  contingency  plan  to  deal  with  any  fuel  spills);  (vi)  mitigating \nnoise  and  construction  activities  posing  a  risk  to  workers  and  local  communities  by  timing  the \nwork and providing protective safety equipment; (vii) developing a quarry management plan so \nthat quarry material is removed in an approved manner and the areas are rehabilitated, (viii) the \ncontractor\u2019s developing a community and worker safety and health plan to minimize construction \nhazards. These conditions are included in the EMP and will be addressed by the contractor. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n51 \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures during Operation \n\nRoad users\u2019 safety will be enhanced by the provision of sidewalks while improved road \n\n17. \ndrainage will reduce stormwater ponding on the roads.  \n\n18. \nTo  achieve  the  Project\u2019s  environmental  benefits  will  require  following  a  regular \nmaintenance schedule for cleaning the road drainage systems where sediment and debris will \nbe  removed  from  within  the  stormwater  retention  chambers.  Regular  maintenance  must  also \ninclude  grass  cutting,  pothole  patching,  and  shoulder  repairs.  Grit  and  sediments  from  drain \nclearing activities will be disposed of at the approved Tapuhia Landfill, where it will be used as \nlandfill cover. These conditions are in the EMP, and MOW will address them during operation.  \n\nPredicted  environmental  impacts,  mitigating  measures,  monitoring  programs,  and \n19. \ninstitutional  responsibilities  are  detailed  in  the  attached  environmental  management  and \nmonitoring plan (Table A11.2). \n\nE.  \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\n20. \nThere  is  no  environmental  management  unit  or  environment  officer  within  the  MOW. \nTherefore,  institutional  strengthening  of  MOW  will  be  necessary  and  has  been  included  in  the \nProject  by  establishing  an  environment  and  social  unit  (ESU).  The  unit  will  consist  of  two \npersons  who  will  be  responsible  for  environmental  management,  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement,  as  well  as  public  relations  and  consultation.  The  ESU  will  be  responsible  to \nprepare  IEEs  for  the  subprojects,  as  well  as  to  supervise  the  contractor\u2019s  site  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (SEMP)  implementation  through  regular  observation  and  spot-checking \nconstruction-related  activities.  In  short,  the  ESU  will  be  responsible  for  environmental \ncompliance requirements.  \n\n21.  MOW  will  incorporate  the  environmental  design  requirements  into  the  project  design \nspecifications.  It  will  arrange  for  the  EMP\u2019s  construction  requirements  to  be  included  into  the \ncontract documents so that contractors can address these in their bids. During construction, the \nPMU site engineer will ensure that conditions contained in the EMP are observed. This engineer \nwill be assisted by ESU staff in supervising and approving the completion of EMP requirements.  \n\n22. \nThe Land Management Division of the Ministry of Lands, Survey and Natural Resources \n(MLSNR)  will  help  coordinate  compensation  for  loss  of  private  property  and  implement  the \nrequirements of the Short Resettlement Plan. The MLSNR will ensure that all compensation is \ncompleted before construction commences. \n\n23. \nThe  following  reports  will  be  prepared.  The  contractor  will  prepare  a  monthly  EMP \ncompliance  report  that  will  be  submitted  to  the  PMU.  The  PMU  will  evaluate  the  contractor\u2019s \nEMP report. A section concerning compliance with the EMP will be prepared and included as a \npart of the quarterly project report to ADB. A copy of this report will also be sent to Department \nof Environment. \n\nF.  \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\n \n\n \n\n24. \nExtensive public consultation has been undertaken by the IUDSP, which has established \na highly participatory approach of working with local counterparts within the Government, private \nsector,  nongovernmental  organizations,  the  church,  women\u2019s  and  youth  groups,  and  the \nbroader community. As a result, there is overall strong public support for and agreement about \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n \n\nthe Project. The IEE report will be made available at the Department of Environment and IUDSP \noffices in Nuku\u2019alofa and uploaded onto ADB\u2019s website. \n \nG.  \n\nEnvironmental Assessment Review Procedure \n\n \n\n1. \n\nSelection Criteria of Subprojects \n\n25. \nAll of the subprojects will be subject to a first level of screening in accordance with the \nKingdom of Tonga\u2019s environmental laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s environmental assessment \nguidelines. Accordingly, subprojects will not be selected if the following are found: \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\nsignificant impact on ecologically sensitive areas of the Fanga\u2019uta Lagoon National \nMarine Reserve arising from their design, location, construction, or operation;  \nsignificant  impacts  on  coral  reefs  and  natural  vegetation  as  specified  in  the \nSchedule of Environmental Impact Assessment Act, 2003;  \n\n(iii)   a permanent negative effect on a known rare or endangered species; and  \n(iv)   permanent damage to irreplaceable cultural relics and archaeological sites. \n\n2. \n\nReview  Procedure  for  Environmental  Assessment  of  Subprojects  and \nResponsibilities of the Ministry of Works and ADB \n\nTo  ensure  that  the  remaining  subprojects  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n26.  \nenvironmental    assessment    procedures 2    and    the    Government\u2019s    Environmental    Impact \nAssessment Act, 2003, responsibilities of the concerned authorities will be as follow: \n\na. \n\nMinistry of Works Responsibilities \n\n27.  Ministry of Works (through the ESU) will be responsible for \n\n(i) \n\npreparing  IEEs,  including  the  requirement  to  undertake  public  consultations  and \npublic disclosure of the IEE; \n\n(ii)  obtaining IEE clearance from the MLSNR; \n(iii)  submitting  to  ADB  the  IEEs  for  subprojects,  as  well  as  the  IEEs\u2019  clearance  for \n\n(iv) \n\nADB\u2019s consideration in approving the subprojects; \nincorporating mitigation measures during preconstruction and construction phases \n(which will be done by the design engineer within the PMU); \n\n(v)  ensuring that the EMP\u2019s construction stage mitigation measures are included in the \nbidding  document  for  costing  by  the  contractor  and  that  IEE  clearances  will  be \nobtained before commencing any civil  works for a subproject; \n\n(vi)  ensuring that contractors have completed the detailed EMP for approval; \n(vii)  monitoring EMP implementation; and \n(viii)  submitting quarterly reports on implementing EMPs to MLSNR and ADB. \n\n b. \n\nADB Responsibilities \n\n \n28. \n\nADB is responsible for: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nreviewing IEE and summary IEE reports and disclosing these on ADB\u2019s website, \nreviewing  all  statutory  environmental  clearance  granted  by  the  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental authority and noting all conditions in approving the subprojects,  \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n53 \n\n(iii) \n\nreviewing  the  quarterly  report  on  implementing  the  EMP  and  taking  actions  (as \nnecessary) in close coordination with the Ministry of Works, and \n\n(iv)  monitoring  implementation  of  the  EMP  and  due  diligence  as  part  of  overall \n\nproject review missions. \n\n \n3. \n\nEnvironmental  Due  Diligence \nEnvironment Policy \n\nto  Ensure  Compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \n\n29.  MOW  will  ensure  that  ADB  will  be  given  access  to  undertake  environmental  due \ndiligence  for  all  subprojects,  if  necessary.  MOW  has  primary  responsibility,  however,  for \nenvironmental  due  diligence  and  for  monitoring  implementation  of  subprojects\u2019  environmental \nmitigation  measures.  The  due  diligence  report  and  monitoring  report \nthe  EMP \nimplementation need to be systematically documented. \n\nfor \n\n \n\n4. \n\nPublic Disclosure \n\n30. \nundertake the following: \n\nIn  the  context  of  disclosing  environmental  documentation  to  the  public,  MOW  will \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\npublic  consultations,  and  particularly  with  affected  people,  during  preparation  of \nIEEs for the remaining subprojects;  \npublic  disclosure  of  all  environmental  documents,  whereby  IEE  reports  will  be \nmade available at the Department of Environment and IUDSP offices in Nuku\u2019alofa; \nand \nproperly  keeping  all  environmental  documents,  including  the  environmental  due \ndiligence  and  monitoring  reports  for  each  subproject,  as  part  of  the  Ministry  of \nWorks records. \n\n \nH.  \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n \n\n31. \nBased  on  discussions,  review  of  documents,  and  field  assessment  of  the  Project,  it  is \nconcluded that by rehabilitating and improving the surrounding urban infrastructure the Project \nwill  assist  in  maintaining  the  environmental  quality  of  the  Nuku\u2019alofa  foreshore  areas  and  the \nFanga\u2019uta  Lagoon,  and  it  will  maintain  the  water  quality  of  the  groundwater  resources  of  the \narea. The Project has strong community support in Nuku\u2019alofa. The Project complies with ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental  safeguard  policies  and  no  irreversible  or  significant  cumulative  impacts  have \nbeen identified. Thus, a more detailed environmental impact assessment is not warranted and \nthe  summary  IEE  will  be  the  final  environmental  assessment  for  the  Project.  By  adopting  the \nenvironmental  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures  outlined  in  the  environmental  management \nand monitoring plan, the Project will not cause environmental concerns.  \n\nI.  \n\nConclusions \n\n32. \nThe Project is classified as category B. The initial environmental screening process and \nanalysis  of  potential  environmental  impacts  concluded  that  the  Project  will  not  result  in  any \ndirect or indirect significant adverse environmental impacts and will not require further study. All \nimpacts can be satisfactorily mitigated and an  EMP has been prepared that contains practical \nmitigation measures. A full environmental impact assessment is not warranted. \n\nAn  environmental  assessment  review  framework  has  been  prepared  that  will  guide \n\n33. \nimplementation of the subsequent subprojects under the sector project. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProject \nActivity \n\nA. \nProject \nlocation \n\nPreconstruction \n\nPotential \nEnvironmental \nImpact \n\nIntrusion into \nenvironmentally \nsensitive areas \n\nEnvironment-\nally sound \ndesign \n\nDeclining water \nquality from \ndischarge of \nsediment and \nstormwater to the \nFanga\u2019uta \nLagoon and \nforeshore \n\nRoad safety \n\nIncreasing road \naccidents  \n\nDrain and \nroad \nmaintenance \n\nLoss of \nenvironmental \nvalues in \nenvironmentally \nsensitive areas \n\nLand \nacquisition \n\nLoss of private \nproperty \n\nTable A11.2:  Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan \n\nImpact Mitigation \n\nProposed Mitigation Measure \n\nImplementing \nResponsibility \n\nMitigation \nCost \n\nParameter to \nbe Monitored \n\n \na.
