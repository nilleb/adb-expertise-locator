An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and \nAssessment  environmental assessment and review procedures (EARP) have \nbeen prepared. \n   \nProject Description  The Project will provide an efficient and well-maintained primary \nroad  network,  all-weather  roads  to  low-income  and  low-lying \nresidential  areas,  well-maintained  and  functional  drainage \nsystems,  effective  trunk  drainage  systems,  and  groundwater \nquality monitoring wells to assess the impacts of septic tanks on \nNuku'alofa\u2019s aquifers. It will facilitate improved urban planning and \nmanagement  capacity  as  well  as  infrastructure  maintenance \nprograms. \n   \nRationale  Increased demand for town allotments in urban areas has forced \nurban  expansion  onto  low-lying  wetlands.  With  decreasing \navailability  of  suitable  land  and  a  rapidly  growing  urban \npopulation,  social  services  in  Nuku\u2019alofa  are  deteriorating  and \nroads and drainage need improvement. Frequent flooding in parts \nof the Nuku\u2019alofa area is resulting in declining health and social \nindicators. The Project will contribute to improved urban services. \n \nThe Project supports the Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy \nfor  improved  access  to  basic  social  services  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Strategic  Development  Plan  8.  The  Project  is \ndirectly linked to ADB\u2019s key strategy to support the Government\u2019s \npolicy reform program for enhancing the public sector\u2019s efficiency \nand effectiveness, and it addresses deteriorating social conditions \nthrough general interventions. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project is expected to contribute to improved living standards \nin Nuku'alofa, including for low-income residential areas, through \nproviding improved urban infrastructure. The Project will enhance \nurban sustainability by supporting implementation of planning and \nurban  management  legislation  as  well  as  urban  planning  and \nmanagement capacity building. \n ", "ii \nComponents and  The Project will provide for the following:  \nOutputs  (i)  Roads.  Rehabilitating  approximately  10  kilometers  (km)  of \nprimary  roads,  including  road  drainage,  constructing  4  km  of \nall-weather  access  roads  in  low-income  residential  areas,  and \ndeveloping a preventive road maintenance program. \n(ii)  Drainage.  Rehabilitating  all  existing  drains  in  Nuku'alofa\u2019s \ncentral business areas (CBA), constructing 2.1 km of flood relief \ndrains,  and  developing  a  stormwater  drainage  maintenance \nprogram. \n(iii) Sanitation. Constructing eight groundwater monitoring wells \nand monitoring of groundwater quality. \n(iv) Candidate subprojects. Constructing candidate subprojects \nselected following the selection criteria set out in Appendix 6. \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The  Project\u2019s  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $14.22  million \nequivalent, including taxes and duties of $1.80 million equivalent. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nFinancing Source  Total  % \nADB ADF Grant  11.30  79.5 \nGovernment of Tonga  2.92  20.5 \nTotal Project Cost  14.22  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund. \n Source: ADB. \n   \nThe grant will be subject to such other terms and conditions as set \nforth in the grant and project agreements. \n \nThe ADF grant of $11.30 million will ease the macroeconomic \nimpact of the large financing requirements for urban infrastructure \ndevelopment  that  is  essential  for  economic  growth  and  social \ndevelopment. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  1 August 2008\u201331 December 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2012  \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The Ministry of Works (MOW), as the Executing Agency (EA), will \nArrangements  be responsible for implementing the Project. A project steering \ncommittee has been formed and will provide guidance for the \noverall direction of the Project. The Project Steering Committee \n(PSC) will consist of Minister of Finance (Chairperson); Minister of \nWorks;  Minister  of  Lands,  Survey  and  Natural  Resources; \nSecretary  of  Lands,  Survey  and  Natural  Resources;  Solicitor \nGeneral; Secretary of Finance; Director of Education; Director of \nHealth; and district officers of Kolomotu\u2019a and Kolofo\u2019ou. A project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will be established within the EA for day-\nto-day management and implementation of the Project. The PMU \nproject manager will be appointed by MOW. The PMU will (i) \nserve  as  the  secretariat  for  the  PSC,  (ii)  undertake  project ", "iii \nmanagement, administration, and interagency coordination at the \nexecutive  level,  (iii)  maintain  project  accounts,  (iv)  oversee \nprocurement procedures, (v) prepare quarterly project progress \nupdates and other reporting requirements, and (vi) prepare the \nproject completion report to the Government and ADB. The PMU \nwill  be  supported  by  project  implementation  assistance  (PIA) \nconsultants  who  will  provide  project  planning,  design,  and \nmonitoring,  as  well  as  reporting  on  the  Project  and  cost  and \nquality control services. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Works (MOW) \n   \nProcurement  Procurement  under  the  Project  will  follow  ADB's  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). All civil works \nwill  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures. Procurement of specialized equipment for road and \ndrainage maintenance will use shopping procedures. \n   \nConsulting Services  An international consulting firm (57 person-months of international \nconsulting services and 151 person-months of national) will be \nengaged to provide PIA consultants to assist the PMU in overall \nproject management and implementation. The consultants will be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time) using quality \nand cost-based selection procedures. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The proposed road improvements will benefit users by reducing \nBeneficiaries  traffic congestion, saving travel time and costs, and making roads \nsafer  and  more  user-friendly  for  pedestrians.  In  particular,  the \n \nimprovements  include  sidewalks  to  provide  pedestrians  safer \npassage, and especially during times of heavy rainfall. Proposed \nimprovements to secondary and access roads in the low-lying and \nlow-income  areas  of  Popua  and  Sopu  will  provide  all-weather \nvehicular  access  to  residential  allotments.  Road  drainage \nimprovements will also reduce impacts caused by road flooding \nand improve surface water management generally. \n \nThe drainage and flood relief components will significantly reduce \nflooding of properties and roads and will contribute to removing \nstagnant surface waters that are a potential health hazard, and \nparticularly  in  low-lying,  lower-income  areas.  Severe  mosquito \ninfestation is common, and standing water is usually mixed with \nwastewater  discharges.  That  provides  a  direct  contaminant \npathway to human receptors. \n \nThe Project will reduce poverty by lessening the financial burden \nof  repairing  flood  damage  to  properties  and  will  substantially \nimprove  the  access  and  habitability  of  low-income  residential \nareas, thereby providing social inclusiveness and equity to the \npoorest  communities  in  the  Nuku'alofa  area.  Health  costs  are \nexpected to be reduced along with the incidence of stagnant and \n ", "iv \ncontaminated standing water in the low-income area of Sopu. The \nimproved access road conditions will reduce vehicle operating and \nrepair costs.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project design takes into account potential risks associated \nwith project management and with construction and repair quality. \nThe  PMU  will  undertake  capacity  building  to  strengthen  the \nGovernment\u2019s capacity to meet its increased responsibilities. A \nteam  of  international  and  national  consultants  will  assist  with \nimplementation. \n \nTo mitigate risk of cost overruns resulting from underestimation \nand inflation, the PMU will (i) use conservative cost estimates, (ii) \nuse strict and effective contract conditions to ensure the Project is \ndelivered on time and on budget, (iii) develop measures to avoid \nuninsurable risks while preparing contract documentation to limit \nthe  employer\u2019s  exposure,  and  (iv)  require  a  guarantee  by  the \ncontractor  for  1  year  following  works  to  ensure  construction \nquality. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  institutional  reforms  could \nwane. ADB project and technical assistance (TA) review missions \nwill  engage  in  regular  dialogue  to  maintain  support  and \ncommitment.  ADB  also  will  continue  working  closely  with \ndevelopment  partners  to  promote  sector  governance \nimprovements. \n \nAn environment and social unit (ESU) will be established within \nthe  PMU  to  address  environmental  and  resettlement  issues. \nEnvironmental  impacts  will  be  monitored  through  construction \nsupervision,  and  mitigation  measures  will  be  implemented  in \naccordance  with  the  environmental  management  plan.  Project \ncomponents shall be designed to minimize resettlement impacts. \nThe ESU will continuously consult with affected persons and other \nkey  stakeholders  throughout  the  Project\u2019s  implementation  to \nensure community concerns and grievances with respect to the \nProject are addressed. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  ADB  will  provide  $700,000  equivalent  from  the  Japan  Special \nFund, funded by the Government of Japan as a TA grant. The TA \nhas  been  designed  to  build  capacity  for  implementing  the \nproposed urban planning and management system. The expected \nimpact of the TA will be improved standard of living within Tonga\u2019s \nurban areas. The expected outcomes are (i) well-planned and \nsustainable urban development, and (ii) a safe and efficient road \nsystem within Nuku'alofa. The TA includes four components and \nwill  provide  (i)  preparation  of  planning  legislation;  (ii)  capacity \nbuilding in the Planning and Urban Management Division (PUMD) \nand  assistance  to  develop  a  fully-costed  urban  sector \ndevelopment plan to identify and prioritize development needs for \nthe  sector  for  2009\u20132020;  (iii)  a  traffic  management  study  for ", "v \nNuku'alofa; and (iv) capacity building within MOW for planning, \ndesign,  supervision,  and  project  management  of  road \nmaintenance projects. \n \n ", "175 o 10'W\n'Atata\nAta\nINTEGRATED URBAN DEVTOELNOGPAMENT SECTOR PROJECT 21o  00'SHa'atafu Polo'a Fafa Onevai Fukave 21o  00'S\nHa'avakatolo Motutapu\nTe'ekiuNukunuku NUKU'ALOFA Navutoka Kolonga Eueiki\nTalafo'ou Niutoua\nHa'utu\nPea\nHouma\nMu'a\nSopu Utulau\nVaini\nHofoa Road Vuna Road TONGATAPU GROUP Fatumu\nVuna Wharf Ha'asini and Hamula\nFua'amotu\nVaha'akolo Road 175 o 10'W\nHihifo Road Queen Salote Wharf\nVuna Road\nPopua\nRoad\nVaha'akolo Road Taufa'ahau  Alaivahamama'o (by-pass) Road\nNational Capital\nCity/Town\nMonitoring Well\nNational Road N\nSecondary Access Road\nRoad Improvement\n0 0.5 1\nDrainage Channel\n0\n7\n-27 Drain Rehabilitation Kilometers\n4\n4\n H\nR", " \nI.

RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Urbanization  is  only  a  relatively  recent  phenomenon  in  Tonga,  but  the  problems \nassociated  with  unplanned  and  uncontrolled  development  are  already  being  experienced. \nNuku'alofa, located on the island of Tongatapu, is the national capital and has a population of \n34,058.1 The population of Nuku'alofa represents 34% of the national population and about 75% \nof the national urban population. The annual growth rate in the Nuku\u2019alofa urban area from 1996 \nto  2006  was  0.85%.  Migration  to  Nuku\u2019alofa  from  Tonga's  outer  islands  is  significant. \nApproximately 22% of households migrated to Nuku\u2019alofa from other areas within Tonga during \nthe last 10 years, half of whom migrated during the last 2 years.2 The impact of rural\u2013urban \nmigration on Nuku'alofa's population has been reduced by overseas migration, with 30% of \nhouseholds in Nuku'alofa reporting that household members had emigrated in the last 5 years. \n3.  Under the Tongan Constitution, every male citizen is entitled to two plots of land, one \nrural and one urban. As a result of growing demands for this entitlement, the Government is \nincreasingly under pressure to allocate urban plots. It has resorted to allocating land within two \nlow-lying areas of Nuku\u2019alofa, namely the Popua district to the east of the urban area and the \nSopu district to the west, both of which are areas of swampland that are continually flooded. \n4.  The buildup of traffic in and around Nuku\u2019alofa in recent years has meant that the main \napproach roads to the urban area, and roads in the town center, are experiencing congestion.3 \nThis is especially severe around the public market and also in other areas at peak office and \nschool arrival and departure hours. Traffic congestion in the town center is exacerbated by the \nfact that vehicular access to the wharves and industrial sites to the east of the primary urban \narea is restricted and has to pass either through or close to central commercial areas. In \naddition, the lack of adequate traffic management in strategic locations along the main road \nnetwork, and especially in terms of off-street parking, also contributes to traffic congestion.  \n5.  The lack of adequate sidewalks alongside many of the busiest roads results in significant \nconflict between pedestrians and vehicular traffic. The situation is particularly acute during rains, \nwhen roadside flooding forces pedestrians onto the main roadways. \n6.  The standard of road maintenance and repair is low and usually involves repeated \npatching of damaged sections. Where roads are resurfaced, a new layer of chip seal is laid on \ntop of the existing surfaces without repair to the base course in soft areas, resulting in rapid \n                                                 \n1  The population of Nuku'alofa is based on data gathered during the 2006 Census. \n2  ADB. 2006. Preparing the Tonga Integrated Urban Development Project. Technical Report \u2013 Social Issues in \nUrban Development. Manila. \n3  A 1-day manual traffic count was conducted in June 2006 over an 11-hour period. It recorded nearly 11,000 vehicle \nmovements on Taufa'ahau Road, the main artery into the urban area. This represents an increase of 270% over \nthe results of a survey completed in 1999. \n ", "2   \ndeterioration  of  the  resurfaced  road.  The  absence  of  adequate  road  drainage  and  poor \nmaintenance of existing drains result in frequent flooding along roadways or over the roadways \nthemselves. In 1998, the Ministry of Works (MOW) prepared a comprehensive nationwide road \nimprovement  program,  and  considerable  work  has  been  accomplished  in  completing  the \nprimary and secondary roads throughout Nuku\u2019alofa. However, many of the roads completed \nprior  to  the  1998  plan  have  now  exceeded  their  designed  useful  lives  and  again  require \nresurfacing. The surfaces of most local residential access roads are gravel. These are badly \nbroken and potholed. After heavy rain, they can be untrafficable, limiting access to homes. \n7.  The topography of Tongatapu is flat and low-lying. The highest elevation on Tongatapu \nis 70 meters above mean sea level. Most of the urban area of Nuku'alofa is only 1\u20132 meters \nabove that level and is subject to periodic flooding during heavy rain. Most floodwater eventually \ninfiltrates into the limestone substrata, but there are extensive low-lying areas within the urban \narea that are frequently flooded and provide ideal conditions for mosquitoes and transmission of \nwaterborne diseases. \n8.  The existing drainage systems in the central areas of Nuku\u2019alofa do not function well due \nto siltation and other forms of blockage, coupled with a general lack of repair and maintenance. \nNuku'alofa has a number of open drainage channels with limited culvert interconnections. These \nchannels frequently either have no outlets or their outlets are substantially blocked, resulting in \nstagnant  water  lying  for  days  until  it  eventually  infiltrates  or  evaporates.  Some  areas  of \nNuku'alofa have very limited drainage systems and so stormwater collects at low points, where \nit infiltrates into the ground only after prolonged periods. \n9.  Development of residential subdivisions in low-lying swampy areas such as Sopu and \nPopua is constrained by the presence of large bodies of undrained surface water, requiring \nsubstantial filling of allotments and roads. The piecemeal filling of roads and allotments has \naltered the natural drainage patterns. The blockage of natural flow paths has created additional \nswamps and open water bodies. These result in flood damage to property, perpetually standing \nwater, and a loss of access to unfilled allotments. \n10.  Most households in Nuku'alofa rely on individual septic tank systems for wastewater \ndisposal. Many septic tanks are undersized and improperly constructed and may be polluting \nthe groundwater resources. Contaminated groundwater discharging to the coastal fringe and \nlagoon areas are thought to be the cause of excessive algal growth, and there are concerns \nabout impacts on the aquatic ecosystems. Monitoring of the groundwater quality is limited and \ndoes  not  allow  detailed  evaluation  of  groundwater  conditions.  Nuku'alofa's  water  supply  is \nsourced  from  Tongatapu's  aquifers.  Detailed  groundwater  and  hydrogeologic  analysis  is \nrequired to assess the impact of wastewater disposal methods on groundwater quality. The \nProject\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n11.  A number of government agencies are responsible for land transportation and traffic \nmanagement in Tonga. The MOW is responsible for planning and design standards, road \nconstruction, and maintenance. The Ministry of Police is responsible for vehicle licensing, traffic \nsignals, traffic management, and traffic enforcement. The Department of Environment/Ministry \nof Health is responsible for street cleaning and public health. The Ministry of Labor, Commerce \nand Industries is responsible for bus and taxi rates and operations. Limited interagency and \ninterdepartmental  coordination  has  resulted  in  inadequate  allowance  for  the  provision  of \ninfrastructure and such public utilities as drainage, water, and electricity supply lines in many \nroad rights-of-way. ", "3 \n12.  Civil unrest on 16 November 2006 caused the destruction of or serious damage to \napproximately  25%  of  the  buildings  within  the  Nuku'alofa  central  business  area  (CBA).  In \naddition to the high reconstruction cost, the Tongan economy has suffered a decline in business \nactivity and a substantial reduction in tourist arrivals. The Government has obtained a loan from \nthe People's Republic of China for T$118 million ($62 million) for reconstructing the CBA. The \nreconstruction activities will focus on replacing the buildings destroyed in November 2006. \nAdditional infrastructure works, beyond the scope of the reconstruction project, will be required \nwithin the CBA, although the nature and extent of the required works is yet to be fully assessed. \nAn analysis of the urban sector in Tonga is in Appendix 2. \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n13.  Land Allocations. All land in the Kingdom of Tonga belongs to the Crown and is divided \nbetween the King\u2019s land, the Royal Family\u2019s hereditary estates, the nobles and chiefs' hereditary \nestates, and Government land. The nobles and chiefs' hereditary estates and Government land \nare subdivided into allotments for the rest of the people of Tonga. The land tenure regulation \nstipulates that every Tongan male over the age of 16 is entitled to a rural and an urban \nallotment. With growing urbanization, the Government has increasing difficulty in honoring this \nright, and it has been forced to develop marginal land on the periphery of Nuku'alofa. As a \nresult, many people in Nuku\u2019alofa, and particularly the most vulnerable, live in low-lying flood-\nprone areas unsuitable for housing and with poorly developed public infrastructure. To provide \nbasic  public  infrastructure,  such  as  all-weather  roads  and  functional  drainage,  in  existing \nresidential areas such as Sopu and Popua will significantly improve living conditions in terms of \nhealth  and  amenities  while  creating  opportunities  to  utilize  land  that  now  is  permanently \nwaterlogged. \n14.  Urbanization.  With  continued  rural-to-urban  migration,  development  pressure  in \nNuku\u2019alofa is increasing and existing infrastructure (particularly roads and drainage) does not \nhave the capacity required to meet growing traffic volumes and stormwater runoff associated \nwith  urbanization.  Limited  recurrent  maintenance  of  roads  and  drains  has  exacerbated   \npressures on existing public infrastructure. Upgrading of existing infrastructure and development \nof comprehensive and sustainable maintenance programs to meet the needs of the growing \npopulation are required immediately. Land for urban expansion of Nuku'alofa is limited to the \nperipheral agricultural and ecologically sensitive areas. Without coordinated and systematic \nurban planning, urban population growth may increasingly push into more peripheral areas and \nresult in underutilization of existing infrastructure and services and the costly extension of public \nutilities and services into new and more remote development areas. Recent establishment of \nthe Planning and Urban Management Division (PUMD) provides the Government a mechanism \nto  plan  and  coordinate  urban  development.  Limited  qualified  and  experienced  staff  and \nresources within PUMD constrain the Government in providing effective and efficient urban \nplanning and management services, however, and there is an urgent need to build capacity \nwithin PUMD. \n15.  Public  Sector  Reform  and  Institutional  Responsibilities.  Significant  government \nrestructuring has taken place in Tonga since a fiscal crisis occurred in 2005. In July 2006, the \nGovernment significantly downsized the administration. Historically, there has been a lack of \ncomprehensive and coordinated planning. Currently, a variety of departments have roles in \nvarious aspects of planning and managing urban areas. The Ministry of Finance is responsible \nfor  developing  the  Government\u2019s  national  plan  and  providing  policy  advice  on  all  matters \npertaining to social and economic development. The Tonga Water Board is responsible for \nproviding potable water to the urban areas. The MOW is responsible for processing building \n ", "4   \npermits  and  assistance  with  civil works  for  roads  and  drainage.  The  Ministry  of  Health  is \nresponsible for reviewing building designs for compliance with sanitation requirements. A Solid \nWaste Management Authority was established in October 2006 for collecting solid waste. The \nMinistry of Lands and Survey is responsible for mapping and assigning land allocations. The \nlack of specific institutional arrangements for urban planning and management directly leads to \nthe current ad hoc approach to urban development. \n16.  External Assistance to the Urban Sector. Historically, much of the assistance from \nmultilateral  or  bilateral  donors  has  been  focused  on  rural  areas  and  Tonga\u2019s  outer  island \ngroups. Past external assistance was poorly coordinated and had limited success in addressing \nthe Government\u2019s development priorities. Assistance for the urban sector has been limited and \nmostly  ad  hoc  and  limited  in  scope.  However,  there  are  a  number  of  exceptions.  The \nGovernment of Japan has provided grant assistance for improvements to the Nuku\u2019alofa Water \nSupply.4 The Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) funded the Nuku\u2019alofa \nUrban Roads and Drainage Study of 1993 under a 9-year institutional strengthening program. \nImprovement of the road from Nuku\u2019alofa to the airport was funded by Japan International \nCooperation Agency (JICA), and including roadside drainage in the CBA. The ongoing AusAID \nSolid Waste Management Project is aimed at comprehensive waste collection and management \nin Nuku'alofa, including the provision of a new sanitary landfill site that opened in December \n2006. JICA and Danida (Danish International Development Assistance) are engaged in water \nsupply extension and improvements on Tongatapu, but this is mostly outside Nuku'alofa as 95% \nof households already have access to the water system. AusAID is providing assistance for \nreconstructing the CBA, which was damaged during the unrest in 2006. The $62 million loan \nfrom  People's  Republic  of  China  will  support  reconstruction  works  in  the  CBA.    External \nassistance is summarized in Appendix 3. \n17.  Lessons. ADB has not provided targeted support to Tonga\u2019s urban sector, but it has \nprovided support to four infrastructure projects, the last of which was completed in 2000.5 A \nnumber of lessons have emerged from ADB\u2019s support for infrastructure development in Tonga. \nCost  overruns  have  historically  been  related  to  poor  project  design  and  delays  in \nimplementation. The risk of delays in project implementation and associated cost overruns for \ncore subprojects need to be addressed through carefully identified and technically feasible \nsubprojects and careful preparation of bid documents during project preparation. Preparing \naccurate cost estimates is a difficult task for physical investment projects in Tonga given the \ncountry\u2019s  reliance  on  international  contractors,  particularly  for  civil  works  contracts  in  New \nZealand  and  Australia.  Physical  contingencies  need  to  be  sufficient  to  allow  for  technical \nuncertainties. The choice of procurement methods must consider the Government\u2019s capacity to \nmanage and coordinate contracts and the ability to attract sufficient qualified bidders.  \n                                                 \n4 The Government of Japan approved grants in 2000 and 2001 in the amount of \u00a5320 million and \u00a5857 million \nrespectively for improvements of the Nuku\u2019alofa Water Supply. \n5  ADB has supported infrastructure development in Tonga through ADB. 1994.

The  ADB  special  evaluation  study  Effectiveness  of  Multiproject  Lending  (1997)6  \nconcluded that (i) special approaches to lending are required for smaller developing member \ncountries and multiproject lending is an appropriate approach;7 and (ii) the success rate of \nmultiprojects was disappointing due mainly to \u201cpoor project preparation, inadequate attention to \ninstitutional capacity problems, and failure to properly supervise implementation.\u201d The special \nstudy recommended that multiprojects should only be applied where (i) the multiproject had a \nlimited number of subprojects, each with a strong rational and complementarity to the overall \nobjective; (ii) the capacity of the executing and implementing agencies to implement the project \nis assured; and (iii) the transaction costs associated with the multiproject are less than other \nlending modes. The proposed project will meet these criteria by (i) selecting a limited number of \nsubprojects which address the urban sector investment priorities in Nuku'alofa (road upgrading, \ndrainage, and sanitation), (ii) supplying technical and managerial capacity to the executing \nagency through providing project implementation assistance consultants and capacity building, \nand (iii) minimizing transaction costs through a sector loan modality. \n19.  Need  for  a  Sector  Approach. Nuku'alofa\u2019s expansion has been driven by ad hoc \nprojects in response to immediate development priorities. The lack of sector-wide planning has \nresulted in the development of residential areas on unsuitable land on Nuku'alofa's periphery \nand public infrastructure with limited capacity for future urban growth. Coordinated sector-wide \nurban  planning  is  required.  The  approach  must  be  flexible  to  meet  changing  investment \npriorities  and  to  coordinate  with  the  Government\u2019s  existing  urban  infrastructure  investment \npriorities, such as the CBA reconstruction that is currently in the planning phase. A sector \napproach will also reduce the Government\u2019s transaction costs to prepare urban sector projects. \n20.  Government Policy and Strategy. The Government\u2019s development aims and program \nare presented in its Strategic Development Plan Eight, which was approved in April 2006. The \neight broad goals for the Kingdom in the Plan are (i) a better governance environment; (ii) \nmacroeconomic stability; (iii) sustained and globally competitive private sector-led growth in the \neconomy; (iv) equitable distribution of the benefits of growth; (v) improved education standards; \n \n(vi) improved health standards; (vii) environmental sustainability and disaster risk reduction; and \n(viii) maintenance of law and order, social cohesion, and cultural identity. The Plan\u2019s Strategy 20 \nspecifically targets developing an urban planning and management strategy for Tonga and \nformulating an investment project for development of urban areas. \n21.  ADB\u2019s Role. ADB\u2019s strategy in Tonga is to support implementing Strategic Development \nPlan  Eight,  particularly  regarding  the  goals  for  (i)  better  governance;  (ii)  macroeconomic \nstability; and (iii) private sector-led economic growth, including the Government\u2019s increased \nemphasis on urban development. This strategy contributes to ADB\u2019s overarching goal of poverty \nreduction, is fully consistent with ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy 2005\u20132009, and supports Tonga\u2019s \ncontinued economic and social development and achievement of the Millennium Development \nGoals. The Project will utilize a sector approach to executing Strategy 20. \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 1997. Effectiveness of Multiproject Lending.

THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n22.  The  Project  is  expected  to  contribute  to  improved  living  standards  in  Nuku'alofa, \nincluding in low-income residential areas, by improving urban infrastructure. \nB.  Outputs \n23.  The Project will support the development of urban infrastructure in Nuku'alofa through: \n(i)  Roads.  Rehabilitating  approximately  10  kilometers  (km)  of  primary  roads, \nincluding road drainage, constructing 4 km of all-weather access roads in low-\nincome  residential  areas;  and  developing  a  preventive  road  maintenance \nprogram. \n(ii)  Drainage. Rehabilitating all existing drains in Nuku'alofa's central business area, \nconstructing 2.1 km of flood relief drains, and developing a stormwater drainage \nmaintenance program. \n(iii)  Sanitation.  Constructing  eight  groundwater  monitoring  wells  and  monitoring \ngroundwater quality. \n(iv)  Candidate subprojects. Constructing candidate subprojects selected following \nthe selection criteria set out in Appendix 4. \n \n24.  The Project outputs will comprise core subprojects and candidate subprojects. The core \nsubprojects include: \n(i)  improvement of the existing drainage system in the town's central commercial \narea, and along the main sea frontage of Vuna Road, including the provision of \nstreet sweeping equipment to reduce build up of debris, and a jet/vacuum truck \nfor the cleaning of the existing storm sewers; \n(ii)  a gabion-lined drainage channel through the low-lying, swampy area of Sopu, \nconnecting the largest isolated open water areas to the watershed outlet; \n(iii)  resurfacing and widening of the vehicular road surface on Taufa'ahau Road (4.05 \nkm), the town's main arterial route, to provide a turning lane and construction of \nsidewalks on both sides of the road, and provision of the existing stormwater \ncollection systems; \n(iv)  resurfacing, widening, and providing of sidewalks on Alaivahamama'o Road (1.5 \nkm) including providing stormwater collection systems; \n(v)  resurfacing  and  providing  storm-water  drains  and  culverts  and  sidewalks  on \nVaha'akolo Road, the main alternate route into the town center; \n(vi)  resurfacing and extension of approximately 4 km of secondary and access roads \nin the urban residential areas of Popua and Sopu; and \n(vii)  installing  eight  monitoring  wells  in  strategic  locations  of  the  urban  area  to \nfacilitate collection of data on groundwater quality, particularly in relation to the \nimpact of wastewater discharges on the well-field and the lagoon. \n25.  Candidate subprojects selected in accordance with the selection criteria provided in \nAppendix 6 and approved by the Project Steering Committee and ADB. \n \n \nC.  ADF IX Grant \n \n26.  Tonga experienced annual growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) of about 2.4% \nover 2000\u20132005. As a result of Tonga\u2019s dependence on global markets and weakening of key ", "7 \neconomic drivers, and including a reduction in remittances, tourism, and agricultural exports, \neconomic growth is estimated to have fallen to about 0.6% for FY2006. After the economy \nweakened and monetary policy was tightened, civil unrest erupted in November 2006. This is \nexpected to lead to a further decline in economic performance. \n27.  Tonga\u2019s public sector debt has remained stable at between 40% and 50% of GDP since \nthe late 1980s and is estimated at 44% for FY2007. External debt makes up the bulk of public \nsector debt. With most of the external debt being concessional, the net present value of the \npublic sector debt is about 25% of GDP. In addition, contingent liabilities were estimated at 8% \nof GDP for FY2005. Tonga\u2019s debt sustainability remains vulnerable to deteriorating economic \nperformance. Also at risk is the potential to use debt financing for productive investment that will \nsupport economic growth. The proposed ADF IX grant of $11.30 million to the Government will \nease  the  macroeconomic  impact  of  the  large  financing  requirements  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment  that  are  essential  to  laying  the  foundation  for  economic  growth  and  social \ndevelopment. \n \n28.  The R-paper on Revising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants (the ADF \nR-paper) was approved by the Board on 26 September 2007.8 The ADF R-paper limits the \neligibility for ADF grant assistance to ADF-only (Group A) countries. Tonga was reclassified as \nGroup A country following the Board consideration of the R-paper on Review of the 1998 \nGraduation Policy of the Asian Development Bank on 25 April 2008 and will be eligible for 100% \nADF grant assistance as a country with a high-risk of debt distress. \n \nD.  Special Features \n \n29.  Integrated Approach to Urban Development. The Project will provide the foundation \nfor fully integrated and coordinated urban planning. New legislation will be drafted providing the \nframework for urban development. PUMD will coordinate urban planning and management. \nOther government ministries will continue to be responsible for providing infrastructure and \n \nother  services  but  will  operate  within  the  development  frameworks  set  out  in  plans  and \nprograms prepared by PUMD. PUMD will provide a key liaison and coordination function with \nother parts of the Government and other agencies in urban services planning and management. \n30.  Coordination with Donor Partners. The European Union is considering the provision \nof  a  \u20ac1.8  million  technical  assistance  grant  for  Sustainable  Urban  and  Environmental \nManagement. The proposed European Union technical assistance grant has been designed in \ncollaboration with ADB to complement the proposed Integrated Urban Development Sector \nProject and its associated TA for Urban Planning and Management. AusAID has an ongoing \nsmall-projects fund for Tonga, providing grants from the fund for community projects\u2014including \nto provide grants to low-income earners for filling residential plots in low-lying urban areas. \nAusAID has agreed to coordinate the allocation of grants for lot-filling with the upgrading of \nsecondary and access roads in Sopu and Popua funded through the Project. AusAID has \nprovisionally  budgeted  approximately  A$200,000  per  annum  over  a  3-year  period  for  the \ninitiative. In addition, the Project will complement the proposed CBA reconstruction project to be \nfunded by the People's Republic of China. Although the Integrated Urban Development Sector \nProject does not have common components with the proposed CBA reconstruction project, it \nwill provide for rehabilitating drainage systems and upgrading roads within the CBA that are \nessential to support the investments funded by the People\u2019s Republic of China. PUMD will be \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2007. Revising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants. Draft Policy Paper.

The  Project\u2019s  sector  approach  will  provide  the \nGovernment with the flexibility to implement infrastructure priorities identified for urban sector \ndevelopment and which add value to the CBA reconstruction project. \n31.  Participatory Approach. A highly participatory approach was employed to prepare the \nProject, and consultations with stakeholders were conducted throughout Tonga. The social \nassessment component was based on (i) 16 workshops that included altogether more than 300 \nparticipants on community needs assessment and involved particular interest groups, women, \nyouth, and community leaders, as well as church leaders in 'Eua, Ha\u2019apai, Tongatapu, and \nVava\u2019u; and (ii) a socioeconomic survey of 431 randomly selected households in Nuku\u2019alofa. A \nreport on the results of the consultations is given in Supplementary Appendix A. \nE.  Project Investment Plan \n32.  The Project\u2019s investment cost is estimated at $14.22 million, including taxes and duties \nof $1.80 million equivalent. Cost estimates by project component are summarized in Table 1 \nbelow, and the summary financing plan is presented in Table 2.

Financing Plan \n33.  The Government has requested a grant of $11.30 million from ADB\u2019s ADF to help \nfinance the Project. The grant will be subject to such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ngrant and project agreements. \n34.  ADB will finance 79.5% of the estimated project cost. The Government will provide \n$2.92 million equivalent in local currency as counterpart financing, which accounts for 20.5% of ", "9 \nproject costs.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management  \n \n36.  The Ministry of Works (MOW) will be the Executing Agency (EA) and responsible for the \noverall implementation of the Project. A project steering committee (PSC) will be established \nand will be chaired by the minister of finance with the following members: minister of works; \nminister  of  lands,  survey  and  natural  resources;  secretary  of  lands,  survey  and  natural \nresources; solicitor general; secretary of finance; director of education; director of health; and \ndistrict officers of Kolomotu\u2019a and Kolofo\u2019ou. The project manager will serve as the secretary-\nmember of the PSC. The PSC will provide guidance for the overall direction of the Project. A \nproject management unit (PMU) will be established within the EA for day-to-day management \nand  implementation  of the  Project.  The  director  of  MOW  will  be  appointed  as the  project   \nmanager.  The  PMU  will  (i)  serve  as  the  secretariat  for  the  PSC;  (ii)  undertake  project \nmanagement, administration, and interagency coordination at the executive level; (iii) maintain \nproject  accounts;  (iv)  oversee  procurement  process;  (v)  prepare  quarterly  project  progress \nupdates and other reporting requirements; and (vi) prepare the project completion report to the \nGovernment and ADB. The PMU will be supported by project implementation assistance (PIA) \nconsultants  who  will  provide  project  planning,  design,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  These \nconsultants also will provide cost and quality control services, and they will be assisted by staff \nfrom MOW.9 The EA will ensure that, throughout the project implementation period, adequate \nallocations of counterpart funds are made, approved, and released in a timely manner to ensure \nproper project implementation. The EA will provide adequate office space for the Project and \nensure that the facilities provided under the Project are operated and maintained appropriately. \nAn organization chart showing the implementation arrangements and the PMU structure is in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \n37.  MOW has established financial systems to implement the Project, but human resources \nare limited following downsizing of the Civil Services in 2006. There is a need to provide \nspecialist personnel, particularly for detailed design and construction supervision. MOW has \n                                                 \n9  MOW will provide the following staff to the PMU: (i) a qualified project accountant (full-time for 60 months), (ii) an \nadministrative assistant to assist the PIA consultants (full-time for 60 months), (iii) a surveyor and surveyor\u2019s \nassistant (each with intermittent inputs of 12 months over the duration of the Project), (iv) a community liaison \nofficer or resettlement officer (full-time for 60 months), and (v) an environment officer (full-time for 60 months). \n ", "10   \nrecently  implemented  successfully  a  number  of  major  projects,  including  the  Solid  Waste \nManagement Facility funded by AusAID, and is an implementing agency for the World Bank \nHealth Sector Support Project. The PIA consultants, institutional strengthening, and capacity \nbuilding provided under the Project will bring MOW the resources and skill sets necessary to \nimplement the Project. \n2.  Subproject Preparation and Selection \n38.  Subproject Preparation. Core subprojects were selected by the Government from a list \nof  potential  urban  development  investments  identified  in  the  Tonga  Integrated  Urban \nDevelopment Project Final Report following the selection criteria provided in Appendix 6.10 \nCandidate subprojects will be identified by the PMU from the urban sector development plan. \nThe PMU will then obtain approval from the PSC to assess the feasibility of the candidate \nsubprojects.11 The PMU will prepare a feasibility study for each candidate subproject. The \ncandidate subproject feasibility report will provide a technical analysis and description, rationale, \nscope  and  components,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan,  implementation  arrangements, \nenvironmental impact assessment, and social and poverty impact assessment. Each feasibility \nreport will be submitted initially for review and approval by ADB. After ADB has endorsed the \nfeasibility study, the PMU will submit the feasibility study to the PSC for review and approval. \nImplementation of a candidate subproject may proceed following endorsement of the candidate \nsubproject feasibility report by ADB and the PSC.  \n39.  Selection Criteria. To be eligible for selection, a candidate subproject must be identified \nin the urban sector development plan. The PSC, in consultation with the PMU, will appraise \ncandidate subprojects in accordance with the criteria detailed in Appendix 6. \n40.  Subproject  and  Safeguard  Plan  Approvals.  The  EA  will  submit  all  candidate \nsubproject feasibility reports to ADB for review and approval. ADB\u2019s final approval of financing \nfor each subproject is subject to review and confirmation that implementation is in accordance \nwith the subproject selection criteria and ADB policies. The approved resettlement framework \nand  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  (EARP)  provide  the  basis  for \npreparing candidate subproject land acquisition and resettlement plans (LARPs) and initial \nenvironmental examinations (IEEs). Prior to commencing land acquisition, the EA will submit to \nADB for review and approval all LARPs and IEEs, as applicable. \n3.  Implementation Period \n41.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years. Implementation is expected to commence \non 1 August 2008 and be completed by 31 December 2012. An implementation schedule is \nincluded in Appendix 7. \n4.  Procurement  \n42.  Procurement  of  all  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). All \ncontracts for works will be awarded using international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. \nThe procurement of goods will preferably be grouped into packages larger than $200,000 to be \nsuitable for ICB procedures. Limited international bidding may be used for contracts with an \nexpected cost of $200,000 or less. Miscellaneous minor goods expected to cost under $100,000 \n                                                 \n10 Global Works Inc. 2006. Tonga Integrated Urban Development Project - Final Report. Manila. \n11 A fully costed urban sector development plan will be prepared under the Project\u2019s attached technical assistance. ", "11 \nequivalent will be purchased using shopping procedures. The proposed procurement plan is in \nAppendix 8. \n5.  Consulting Services \n43.  An international consulting firm (57 person-months of international and 151 person-\nmonths of national consulting services) will be engaged as PIA consultants to assist the PMU in \noverall  project  management  and  implementation.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) using quality and cost-based selection procedures. The Government has requested ADB \nto assist in recruiting the PIA consultants. ADB will assist by selecting the consultant on behalf \nof MOW. However, MOW will be responsible for negotiating the contract with the consultants \nand supervising the consultants\u2019 services. Outline terms of reference for the PIA consultants \nand the PMU support staff are included in Supplementary Appendix C. \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n44.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant agreement and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  of  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n7.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing \n45.  The Government has requested that advance procurement action be provided for the   \nrecruitment and fielding of PIA consultants. The Government has also requested and ADB has \napproved the use of retroactive financing for the fielding of the PIA consultants in the amount of \n$300,000 incurred before the grant effectiveness date but not earlier than 12 months before the \ndate  of  the  Grant  Agreement.  Advance  procurement  action  and  retroactive  financing  will \nfacilitate timely implementation of the Project. To be eligible for ADB financing, the recruitment \nof the PIA consultants will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Retroactive  financing  will  be  considered  for  such \nrecruitment in an amount not exceeding $300,000. The Government has been advised that the \napproval of advance procurement action and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to \nfinancing the Project. \n \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n46.  The  Grant  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook, January 2007, as amended from time to time. To facilitate cash flow during project \nimplementation,  the  MOW  requested  for  the  Imprest  Account  to  be  opened  by  MOW \nimmediately after grant effectiveness and will be exclusively used to finance ADB share of \neligible expenditures. The initial advance to be deposited to an imprest account will not exceed \neither 6 months of estimated expenditures to be financed from the imprest account or 10% of \nthe loan amount, whichever is lower. The direct payment procedure will apply for the contracts \nawarded  under  ICB.  If  the  Government  initially  funds  eligible  expenditures  from  its  own \n ", "12   \nresources, the reimbursement procedures will be used. To expedite funds flow and simplify \ndocumentation  process,  the  Statement  of  Expenditures  (SOE)  Procedure  will  be  used  for \nliquidation and replenishment of imprest account and reimbursement of eligible expenditures not \nexceeding $100,000 per individual payment. \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n47.  MOW will maintain separate records and accounts for the Project, and it will have the \nproject accounts and financial statements audited annually by independent auditors acceptable \nto ADB. The EA will provide ADB with copies of the audited project accounts and financial \nstatements no later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. The EA \nwill provide ADB with quarterly progress reports on project implementation. Within 3 months of \nphysical completion of the Project, the EA will provide ADB with a project completion report. \nProgress reports will be compiled by the PMU. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on use of imprest \naccount and statement of expenditure procedures will be provided as a part of the audit report. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Review  \n48.   The PMU will establish a performance management system satisfactory to ADB within 6 \nmonths of the grant effectiveness date. The system will establish a cause-and-effect relationship \nbetween the Project and its impact and will comprise (i) a comprehensive list of implementation-\nrelated  performance  indicators  duly  collected,  monitored,  and  recorded  by  the  PMU  and \nsemiannually  assessed  by  MOW;  and  (ii)  post-completion  performance  and  impact  data \ncollected by the PMU. Baseline and impact data will be disaggregated by city, town, and local \narea, as well as by other dimensions to be discussed at project inception. Implementation of \nperformance monitoring will integrate financial and other aspects. Analysis of social impacts \nunder project performance monitoring will be gender disaggregated and will take into account (i) \nthe differential project impacts and risks facing women, (ii) gender-specific measures to mitigate \nadverse impacts and manage risks, and (iii) the interests and capacities of women to contribute \nto the Project. \n \n49.  ADB will undertake an inception mission 1 month after the grant effectiveness date or 1 \nmonth after fielding of project implementation consultants, whichever is later. ADB and the \nGovernment will undertake semi-annual review missions to evaluate project scope and costs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  resettlement,  achievement  of  scheduled  targets,  and \nidentification  of  project  risks.  The  review  missions  will  also  assess  the  Government\u2019s \ncompliance with grant covenants. ADB and the Government will undertake a midterm review \nmission  2  years  after  the  grant  effectiveness  date.  The  midterm  review  will  undertake  a \ncomprehensive review of (i) the Project\u2019s scope, design, and implementation arrangements; (ii) \nprogress of the Project against projections and performance indicators; and (iii) compliance with \nthe grant covenants. The midterm review will also recommend changes deemed necessary to \nthe Project\u2019s scope and implementation arrangements. The project manager will represent the \nGovernment during review missions. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n50.  The Government has requested associated TA to develop and implement the urban \nplanning and management system proposals formulated under TA4648-TON. The impact of the ", "13 \nTA will be improved standard of living within urban areas of Tonga.12 The expected outcomes \nare (i) well-planned and sustainable urban development, and (ii) a safe and efficient road \nsystem  within  Nuku'alofa.  The  TA  will  comprise  four  components  and  will  provide  (i)  the \npreparation of planning legislation; (ii) capacity building in PUMD and provision of assistance to \ndevelop a fully costed urban sector development plan that identifies and prioritizes the sector\u2019s \ndevelopment needs for 2009\u20132020; (iii) a traffic management study for Nuku'alofa; and (iv) \ncapacity building within MOW for planning, design, supervision, and project management for \nroad maintenance projects. \n51.  The Ministry of Lands, Survey, Natural Resources and Environment will be the EA and \nwill also be the Implementing Agency for the planning legislation and planning and urban \nmanagement components of the TA. MOW will be the Implementing Agency for the TA\u2019s traffic \nmanagement and road maintenance components. The TA will be implemented over a period of \n1 year and will commence in August 2008. Consulting services will comprise 25 person-months \nof  international  consulting  services  and  40  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services \nrecruited through a firm using quality and cost-based selection methods. The total cost of the TA \nis estimated at $875,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $700,000 equivalent. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment  will  provide  $175,000  for  counterpart  funding.  The  TA  Paper  is  attached  as \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Impacts \n52.  Economic  analyses  were  undertaken  for  core  subprojects;  primary,  secondary,  and \naccess roads; and the Sopu Drainage Channel. The analyses were conducted by comparing the \ndiscounted costs and benefits under \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d scenarios over 2008\u20132026 in constant \n2006 prices. The \u201cwithout\u201d case represents a continuation of the existing situation and the \u201cwith\u201d \ncase  represents  the  project  investment  scenarios.  The  economic  costs  accounted  for   \ninvestments,  costs  of  project  implementation,  operations  and  maintenance,  environmental \nmanagement and mitigation, as well as resettlement and land acquisition. Operations and \nmaintenance costs for the \u201cwith\u201d investment cases were estimated at 0.625% of capital costs for \nthe three primary road projects and 1% of those for the secondary and access roads and the \nSopu Drainage Channel. Taxes and duties were excluded from the analyses. \n \n53.  The economic benefits for the road projects were evaluated in terms of fuel cost savings \nunder the \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d project scenarios and account for differences in operation and \nmaintenance costs. A fuel price of T$1.80 per liter, equivalent to about $58 per barrel for Brent \ncrude oil, was applied throughout the period of analysis. The estimated annual fuel savings \namount to 582,000 liters, equivalent to an average net present value of T$0.37 million, or 0.7% \nof fuel imports for the transport sector in FY2006. Most of the benefits from fuel cost savings are \nexpected to accrue to users and passengers, as the transportation sector is deregulated and \ncompetitive. These benefits would be expected to include lower prices for consumer goods \nalong with improved access to markets and basic social services. Improving secondary and \naccess  roads  in  Popua  and  Sopu  are  expected  to  primarily  benefit  the lower-income  and \nmost-vulnerable households and enable them to benefit from the upgrades of primary roads. \n                                                 \n12 Supports the Government's goals for urban planning and infrastructure development as expressed in Strategy 20 \nof the Strategic Development Plan Eight for Tonga. Government of Tonga. 2006. Strategic Development Plan \nEight. Nuku\u2019alofa. \n ", "14   \nThe calculated economic internal rates of return (EIRR) range from 18.2% to 12.2% for primary \nroad subprojects and are 8.2% for the secondary and access road subprojects in Popua and \nSopu. Improvements in secondary and access roads will enable low-income households in \nPopua and Sopu to benefit from the upgrades of primary roads. The EIRRs presented for \nprimary, secondary, and access roads were based on benefits accruing from vehicle operating \ncosts and do not account for benefits such as travel time savings and improved access to \nmarkets and social services. Inclusion of these benefits would result in higher EIRRs.  \n \n54.  The economic costs associated with the Sopu Drainage Channel comprise capital costs \nplus operation and maintenance costs calculated at 1% of the capital costs. Benefits were \nevaluated in terms of cost savings associated with flood damage from heavy rains and structural \ndamage to houses from cyclones. Damage from routine flood damage and structural damage \nfrom cyclones are estimated at about 25% of annual average household income. The EIRR is \ncalculated at 11.6%. The analysis did not include benefits from reduced waterborne diseases, \nreduced costs for operation and maintenance of roads, lower land filling costs for residential \nhouses, improved all-weather access to roads, and more opportunities to use the land. \n \n55.  Sensitivity analyses were undertaken on the economic results to examine the impacts of \nkey assumptions and project risks. The sensitivity analyses indicate that the economic results \nfor road projects are most sensitive to the assumptions of fuel cost savings, followed by capital \ncosts. An increase in global fuel prices would result in greater value of fuel costs savings and \nhigher economic rates of return. A 20% increase in capital costs would reduce the economic \nviability for two of the three primary road projects below the opportunity cost of capital. The \neconomic viability for the Sopu Drainage Channel was sensitive to the assumptions of benefits. \nA 20% reduction in benefits would reduce the economic rate of return to 8%, and a 20% \nincrease in capital costs would result in an economic rate of return of 9%. The economic \nanalysis is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n56.  The upgrading of the secondary and access roads subproject with an EIRR of 8.2% \ndoes not meet the ADB guideline minimum EIRR of 10\u201312% but has been included in the \nProject as the works will substantially improve social inclusiveness and equity in low-income \nresidential areas. \n \nB.  Poverty Reduction Impact \n57.  Although  it  is  not  classified  as  poverty  intervention,  the  Project  addresses  poverty \nreduction by targeting, through the Sopu drainage and secondary roads subprojects, residents \nof the low-income areas of Sopu and Popua. Core subprojects were developed based on a \ndetailed poverty analysis conducted through various participatory approaches during the project \npreparatory stage. Project components in those areas will (i) provide for improved drainage of \nstagnant water in low-lying areas and reduce the risk of damage from floods (Sopu); and (ii) \nimprove the residents\u2019 access to their homes, which is now only by poorly constructed tracks \nthat are frequently flooded and often impassable (Sopu and Popua). The Project will reduce \npoverty by lessening the financial burden of repairing flood damage to properties and, just as \nimportantly, substantially improving the access to and habitability of low-income residential \nareas. It will also lessen health care costs by reducing areas of standing water. The improved \naccess road conditions will reduce vehicle operating and repair costs.  \n \n58.  The Project also provides direct employment opportunities, including opportunities for \nresidents of low-income areas, as local contractors will be engaged to carry out much of the \nworks. During and after implementation, employment will be thus created in constructing and ", "15 \nmaintaining civil works. Also, by reducing travel costs and times, inducing economic activities, \nand employing people directly, the Project will improve people\u2019s incomes and food security.  \n \n59.  During the project performance monitoring for the Project, the economic impacts of the \nProject on the poor and nonpoor will be assessed using secondary and field data. A summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9, while a social and poverty analysis is in \nSupplementary Appendix A.  \nC.  Social Impacts \n60.  Positive social impacts will include improved access to commercial, health, education, \nand  other  community  facilities  within  the  urban  area.  Other  impacts  will  include  reduced \naccident rates for pedestrians and reduction in waterborne disease infections. Potential negative \nsocial impacts include those associated with faster vehicular traffic brought about by road \nrehabilitation. Analysis of social impacts under project performance monitoring will be gender \ndisaggregated.  It  will  take  into  account  (i)  the  differential  project  impacts  and  risks  facing \nwomen, (ii) gender-specific measures to mitigate adverse impacts and manage risks, and (iii) \nthe interests and capacities of women to contribute to the Project. \nD.  Resettlement Impacts  \n61.  Of the seven core subprojects, only the Sopu Drainage Channel subproject will involve \ninvoluntary resettlement. Widening of the Taufa'ahau Road will be contained within the existing \nright-of-way. The Taufa'ahau Road right-of-way is not being encroached upon for commercial or \nany other purpose. While the Sopu Drainage Channel will involve involuntary resettlement, no \nhouseholds will be required to relocate and land acquisition will be limited. A summary land \nacquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) is included in Appendix 10, and the short LARP is in \nSupplementary Appendix F. A LARP will be prepared for candidate subprojects that require land \nacquisition or have resettlement impacts following the guidelines set out in the land acquisition \nand resettlement framework (refer to Supplementary Appendix G).   \nE.  Environmental Impacts \n62.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) has been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), and a summary IEE is attached as Appendix 11. \nThe  Government\u2019s  environmental  requirements,  as  set  out  in  the  Environmental  Impact \nAssessment Act (2003), have also been taken into account. Consultations with stakeholders \nwere undertaken while preparing the IEE to ensure their concerns will be adequately addressed \nand incorporated in the project design (refer to Supplementary Appendix H). \n \n63.  The  seven  core  subprojects  are  located  within  Nuku\u2019alofa  urban  area,  where  the \nenvironment has been substantially modified. Most of the subprojects are maintenance and \nrehabilitation by nature. They are all small, involve minor civil works, and none of them will be \nlocated or pass through any protected areas or ecologically sensitive environment. The road \nupgrades  that  consist  of  resurfacing,  widening,  and  providing  sidewalks  will  be  within  the \nexisting rights-of-way, and the drainage components consist of improvements to the existing \ndrainage system in the CBA and constructing a new drainage channel in a settlement area. \nMitigation measures have been formulated to minimize environmental impacts to insignificant \nlevels. The groundwater quality monitoring will involve installing wells around the project area. It \n ", "16   \nwill  produce  data  necessary  for  improving  conservation  of  the  lagoon  and  foreshore \nenvironment. Limited land acquisition will be involved, but no resettlement will be required. \n \n64.  Improving roads and constructing drains will have long-term beneficial impacts on the \nenvironment. As summarized in the environmental management plan (EMP), which will be part \nof the contractors\u2019 contracts, all potential environmental concerns can be properly mitigated. \nThe EMP will provide guidance for the EA to monitor and report on the Project\u2019s environmental \ncompliance. Adherence to best engineering practices and enforcing the EMP will avoid or \nmitigate to acceptable levels all of the Project\u2019s predicted environmental impacts.  \n \n65.  An  environment  and  social  unit  (ESU)  will  be  created  within  MOW  and  will  be \nestablished within 3 months of grant effectiveness. The ESU will operate within the PMU for the \nduration  of  the  Project.  The  unit  will  consist  of  two  people  who  will  be  responsible  for \nenvironmental management, land acquisition and resettlement, as well as public relations and \nconsultation. The ESU will be responsible to prepare IEEs for the subprojects and to supervise \ncontractors\u2019 EMP implementation by regularly observing and spot-checking construction-related \nactivities. In short, it will be responsible for environmental compliance requirements. \n \n66.  Each subsequent subproject will be subject to an IEE, which will include a detailed, site-\nspecific EMP prepared under the responsibility of the PMU. The EMP will specify the required \nmitigation  measures  and  monitoring  activities  to  ensure  their  effectiveness.  Environmental \nassessment review procedures (EARP) have been prepared that will guide the environmental \nmanagement of the sector project and the preparation of environmental assessments of the \nsubsequent subprojects. The EARPs are attached as Supplementary Appendix I. \n \nF.  Project Risks and Safeguards \n67.  The risks and safeguards related to the Project include the following:  \n(i)  Technical risks. Underestimating resource allocation and improperly employing \nappropriate  construction  methods  and  equipment  might  cause  delays  and \nincrease costs. The project design will mitigate these risks by (a) incorporating \nprovisions in tender documents for evidence of satisfactory past performance in \nsimilar conditions; and (b) requiring minimum levels for providing physical plant at \nmobilization,  detailed  quantification  of  engineering  risks,  and  adequate \ncontingencies for unforeseen items.  \n(ii)  Financial risks. Budgetary allocations for the Project could be inadequate as a \nresult  of  underestimated  construction  costs,  more-than-routine  supervision  of \ncontractors, inflation during implementation, and the potential cost of defending \nconstruction claims lodged by contractors. To mitigate these risks, the PMU will \n(a)  use  conservative  cost  estimates,  (b)  use  strict  and  effective  contract \nconditions to mitigate  slow contractor performance, (c)  develop measures to \nmitigate uninsurable risks when preparing the contract documentation to limit the \nemployer\u2019s exposure, and (d) require a guarantee by the contractor for 1 year \nfollowing works completion to ensure construction quality. Government budgetary \nallocations for road maintenance and counterpart staff could be inadequate due \nto  poor  national  financial  management.  Ongoing  programs  supported  by \ndevelopment partners are strengthening the Government\u2019s budgetary processes, \nfinancial management systems, and provincial governance. This will improve the \nenvironment for project implementation and institutional capacity building. \n ", "17 \n(iii)  Institutional reforms. The Government\u2019s commitment to the reform process, as \nwell  as  of  associated  development  and  implementation  of  operational  and \nmanagement  procedures,  could  wane.  The  reform  process  could  also  face \nincreasing public hostility if it does not occur at a reasonable pace. Further risks \ninclude  the  Government\u2019s  not  progressing  with  timely  legal  and  institutional \nreforms,  and  resource  shortages  within  MOW.  ADB  project  and  TA  review \nmissions,  as  well  as  country  consultation  missions,  will  engage  in  regular \ndialogue to maintain support and commitment. ADB also will continue to work \nclosely with development partners to promote sector governance improvements.  \n(iv)  Land acquisition risks. Implementation of the Project could be delayed due to \ndelays  in  obtaining  land.  No  land  acquisition  is  required  for  the  core  road \nupgrading subprojects. Landholders and lessees affected by the proposed Sopu \nDrainage Channel have welcomed the proposed channel due to the social and \neconomic benefits it will provide and have agreed in principle to relinquish land \nrequired to accommodate the channel. Candidate subprojects will be initially \nscreened to assess potential resettlement impacts. Candidate subprojects will \nnot be selected for inclusion in the Project if the initial screening indicates there is \nopposition to the candidate subproject from affected persons and the community. \n \n68.  An analysis of the project risks shows the economic benefits to be robust. Adverse social \nand  environmental  impacts  are  significant  and  are  amenable  to  mitigation.  Cost  and \nimplementation risks will be managed carefully through the proposed approach to contractor \nprequalification, contract conditions, financial incentives, and penalties to avoid problems of late \nperformance. The risks are sufficiently manageable as to not constitute barriers to effective \nproject implementation. \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n69.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Counterpart staffing and support. Within 3 months of the grant effectiveness \ndate,  the  Government  will  have  established  the  PMU.  The  Government  will \nprovide adequate office space, utilities, and telecommunications facilities for the \nPMU. The Government will ensure that counterpart staff are employed on a \ntimely basis and from its ordinary budgetary allocations, and ensure that the \nPMU has adequate budget to support its routine operations. \n(ii)  Counterpart  financing.  The  Government  will  make  available  counterpart \nfinancing on a timely basis from its ordinary budgetary allocations to ensure \nsmooth implementation of the Project. The Government will also progressively \nincrease recurrent budgets for maintenance to protect investments in road and \nother infrastructure. \n(iii)  Rehabilitation quality. The Government, through the PMU, will ensure that the \nphysical  components  of  the  Project  are  constructed  or  rehabilitated  in \naccordance  with  the  design  technical  specifications,  and  that  construction \nsupervision,  quality  control,  and  contract  management  are  carried  out  in \naccordance with internationally accepted standards.  \n(iv)  Labor, health and safety laws. The Government, through the PMU, will ensure \nthat civil works contractors comply with all applicable labor laws and related \n ", "18   \ninternational treaty obligations. The Government will also ensure that the civil \nworks  contractors  comply  with  all  applicable  health,  and  safety  laws  and \nregulations of the Government, including the provision of appropriate facilities.  \n(v)  Physical  component  maintenance  policy.  Within  six  months  prior  to  the \nProject completion date, the Government, through the PMU, will have confirmed \nmaintenance policies for the physical components constructed under the Project, \nincluding budget and implementation arrangements, and submit them to ADB for \nreview and concurrence.  \n(vi)  Road safety. The Government will ensure that appropriate road safety facilities \nare provided during project implementation as necessary, including pavement \nmarkings, traffic signs and signals, warning signs, and hazard barriers.  \n(vii)  Land acquisition and resettlement. The Government will ensure that (a) land \nacquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  activities  under  the  Project  are \nminimized; (b) where applicable, no civil works contract will be awarded for a \nsubproject until the Government and ADB have approved the Land Acquisition \nand Resettlement Plan (LARP) for the particular subproject; (c) all land and \nrights-of-way required by the Project are made available in a timely manner; \n(d) ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) are complied with; (e) LARPs \nprepared by the Government in accordance with the resettlement framework \nagreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB  and  approved  by  ADB  are \nimplemented according to their terms; and (f) LARPs will be updated based on \ndetailed design, and submitted to ADB for approval and disclosed to affected \npersons.  The  LARP  will  be  prepared  for  the  subprojects  which  require  land \nacquisition  or  have  resettlement  impacts  in  accordance  with  (a)  the  Land \nAcquisition and Resettlement Framework, (b) the relevant laws and regulations \nof the Government, and (c) ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that all works related to the road subprojects will be \nundertaken within rights-of-way. In the event of any unforeseen land acquisition \nor resettlement needs arise in any subproject after the award of civil works \ncontracts, the Government will inform ADB and prepare an updated LARP plan in \naccordance with (a) the Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework, (b) the \nrelevant  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Recipient,  and  (c)  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement. During the preparation of the updated LARP and until \nADB has reviewed and approved such LARP, the Government will ensure that no \nconstruction activities related to that subproject will continue.  \n(ix)  Environment.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  carried  out \nfollowing  the  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Procedures  (EARP) \nprepared in accordance with, and all Project facilities are designed, constructed, \noperated,  maintained  and  monitored  in  compliance  with  all  applicable \nGovernment\u2019s  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy (2002).  \n(x)  The Government will (a) establish within 3 months of the grant effectiveness date \nan  Environment  and  Social  Unit  within  MOW  that  will  be  responsible  for \nenvironmental/social compliance requirements and monitoring; (b) ensure that, \nwhere applicable, no civil works contract will be awarded for a subproject until the \nGovernment and ADB have approved the IEE report of that particular subproject; \n(c) minimize any adverse environmental impacts arising from the Project by (i) \nimplementing the environmental mitigation measures recommended in the EMP, \nand  (ii)  ensuring  that  such  EMP  are  included  in  contract  documents  with \ncontractors, and that contractors implement the required mitigation measures as \ndescribed in the EMP in a satisfactory manner; (d) ensure that the EMP is ", "19 \nupdated following the award of contract but prior to commencement of works, \nand  undertake  regular  monitoring  to  ensure  that  all  negative  environmental \nimpacts related to the works are mitigated properly; (e) submit the monitoring \nreport to ADB, and other relevant agencies, including but not limited to MLSNR; \n(f) report to MLSNR and ADB in case of unanticipated negative environmental \nimpacts, and take proper action to mitigate the impacts; (g) provide remedial \nmitigation measures to affected people; and (h) ensure that the contractors report \nimplementation of the EMP on a regular basis. \n(xi)  Gender  and  employment.  The  Government  will  require  contractors  not  to \ndifferentiate  wages  between  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value.  The \nGovernment will take all reasonable and necessary steps to encourage women \nliving in the project areas to participate in the implementation of the Project. This \nincludes  encouraging  contractors  to  employ  women  in  connection  with  the \nProject.  \n(xii)  Urban Planning and Management System. The Government will continue the \nefforts in implementing the recommendations in the UPMS, including continued \nsupport to the recently established PUMD. \n \nB.  Conditions for Grant Effectiveness \n \n(i)  The Government will have established the project steering committee to the \nsatisfaction of ADB; and \n(ii)  The Government will have appointed the project manager to the satisfaction of \nADB. \n \nC.  Condition for Disbursement \n \nThe Government will not make any withdrawals from (a) the entire grant account until \nthe project implementation consultants have been recruited except for the withdrawals \n \nrelated to the fielding of the project implementation consultants, and (b) the category \nitem related to the civil works for the candidate subprojects in the grant account until the \nurban sector development plan has been approved by the cabinet. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n70.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not \nexceeding the equivalent of $11,300,000 to the Kingdom of Tonga, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources, for the Integrated Urban Development Sector Project on terms and conditions that \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the Draft Grant Agreement presented to \nthe Board.  \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n                               President \n \n3 May 2008\n ", "20  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nPerformance  Data Sources / Reporting \nDesign Summary  Assumptions and Risks \nTargets/Indicators  Mechanisms \nImpact  Assumptions \nImproved living  National Human  (cid:131)  United Nations  (cid:131)  Continued \nstandards   Development Index is  Development  commitment by \nmaintained at or increases  Programme Human  Government to \nfrom 0.815 during the  Development Index  maintain and improve \nperiod 2008\u20132012  reports.  urban infrastructure. \n(baseline year 2006).

Urbanization \n1.  Urbanization  is  only  a  relatively  recent  phenomenon  in  Tonga,  but  the  problems \nassociated with unplanned and uncontrolled development are already being experienced. There \nare only three urban areas of significant size, which are the capital Nuku'alofa on Tongatapu \nisland, Neiafu in the Vava'u island group, and Pangai in the Ha'apai island group. At the last \ncensus in 1996, their populations were 31,290 (Nuku'alofa), 5,650 (Neiafu), and 2,966 (Pangai). \nAt that time, the population of Nuku'alofa was approximately 32% of the national population and \nabout 75% of the national urban population. \n2.  As there have been no intercensal population counts since 1996, official estimates of \ncurrent  population  are  largely  conjectural.  Based  on  available  projections,  however,  the \npopulation of Nuku'alofa is considered to be approximately 34,500,1 which assumes an annual \ngrowth rate in the urban area of 0.9% between 1996 and 2006. This rate is below natural growth \nrates due to the high incidence of emigration from Nuku\u2019alofa, but it may actually underestimate \nrural-to-urban migration. The recent Nuku\u2019alofa socioeconomic survey undertaken through the \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  revealed  that  22%  of  households  migrated  into \nNuku\u2019alofa from other areas in the last 10 years, with 11.6% migrating within the last 2 years.2 \nConversely, the socioeconomic survey confirmed a high rate of overseas migration, with 30% of \nhouseholds reporting that household members had emigrated in the last 5 years.3 \n3.  All land in Tonga belongs to the Crown and is divided between the King\u2019s land, the Royal \nFamily\u2019s hereditary estates, the nobles and chiefs\u2019 hereditary estates, and government land. \nThe latter two estates are subdivided into allotments for the rest of the people of Tonga. The \nland tenure regulation stipulates that every Tongan male over the age of 16 is entitled to a tax \nallotment of 8.25 acres for farming, and a town allotment of up to 1,618 square meters for \nresidential purposes, all of which is hereditary through the eldest male (heir).  \n4.  Population growth has intensified the demand for land, and regulatory entitlements can \nno longer be fulfilled. During the 5-year period to 2000, a 10% decline in town allotment \nregistration for Tongatapu suggested that pressure for space in Tonga\u2019s main commercial \ncenter is compounding the issue of land availability limitations. Leasing of land is as common as \nregistering land, and leases have different terms depending on their purposes.  \n5.  Nuku'alofa\u2019s  growth  is  constrained  by  both  its  geography  and  the  absence  of  land \ndevelopment procedures conducive to planned development. The urban area is bounded on the \nnorth by the ocean, to the east and west by wetlands, and to the southeast and south by the \nFanga'uta Lagoon. Other than furthering development by increasing development densities in \nthe existing urban area, the only direction available for significant growth is to the southwest. \nLand to the southwest is primarily utilized for agricultural purposes, however, and is held by \nindividuals in the form of tax allotments. \n6.  The land allotment system does not naturally allow for private development on any \nsignificant scale, inhibiting land acquisition for commercial and industrial investment.4 As a \n                                                 \n1  Global Works. 2006.

Technical  Report  \u2013  Social  Issues  in  Urban \nDevelopment. Manila. \n3  The actual rate of urbanization will be more accurately determined following release of the results of a recent \ncensus conducted in December 2006. \n4  A government task force supported by the World Bank is currently addressing the needs of the private sector and \nis recommending changes to the lease regulations. \n ", "24  Appendix 2 \nresult, there is virtually no urban expansion through either planned or speculative schemes. \nFurthermore,  the  Government  does  not  itself  plan  or  undertake  any  form  of  guided  land \ndevelopment, other than the subdivision of the marginal lands as discussed above. Through its \nland  registration  and  allocation  role  it  authorizes  development,  but  only  in  response  to \napplications rather than through proactive initiatives. As a consequence of the limited options for \nexpansion, much recent land allocation and development has been in marginal wetland areas to \nthe east and west of the primary urban area.  \n \nB.  Urban Infrastructure \n7.  The buildup of traffic in and around Nuku\u2019alofa in recent years has meant that the main \napproach roads to the urban area, and roads in the town center, are congested.5 This is \nespecially severe around the public market and also in other areas at peak office and school \narrival and departure hours. Traffic congestion in the town center is exacerbated by the fact that \nvehicular access to the wharves and industrial sites to the east of the primary urban area is \nrestricted, and has to pass either through or close to central commercial areas. In addition, the \nlack  of  adequate  traffic  management  in  strategic  locations  along  the  main  road  network, \nespecially in terms of off-street parking, also contributes to traffic congestion.  \n8.  The lack of adequate sidewalks alongside many of the busiest roads results in significant \nconflict between pedestrians and vehicular traffic. The situation is particularly acute during rains, \nwhen roadside ponding forces pedestrians onto the main roadways. \n9.  There is a generally low standard of road maintenance and repair. Poor sections of road \nsurface are repeatedly patched. When resurfacing does take place, a new layer of chip seal is \nlaid on top of the existing surfaces without repair to the base course in soft areas. In addition, \ndue  to  the  absence  of  adequate  road  drainage  and  poor  maintenance  of  existing  drains, \nponding is frequent along roadways or over the roadways themselves. In 1998, the Ministry of \nWorks  (MOW)  prepared  a  comprehensive  nationwide  road  improvement  program,  and \nconsiderable work has been done in completing the primary and secondary roads throughout \nNuku\u2019alofa. However, many of the roads completed prior to the 1998 plan have now exceeded \ntheir  useful  design  lives  and  again  require  resurfacing.  Furthermore,  the  surface  of  most \nlocalized residential access roads remain gravel and are badly broken and potholed. \n10.  Limited  interagency  and/or  interdepartmental  coordination  means  that  inadequate \nallowance is made in many road rights-of-way for the provision of infrastructure and such public \nutilities as drainage, water, and electricity supply lines.  \n11.  At present, there are basic drainage systems in certain areas of Nuku\u2019alofa, such as \naround the town center, along the foreshore, and in a number of small residential areas. \nHowever, these systems do not function well due to siltation and other forms of blockage, \ncoupled with a general lack of repair and maintenance. There are very limited drainage systems \nelsewhere throughout the city. As a result, after heavy rain, stormwater collects in low points, \nand only drains into the ground after an extended period. In other parts of the city there are \nopen drainage channels with limited culvert interconnections. These channels frequently have \neither no outlets or substantially blocked outlets, resulting in stagnant water lying for days until it \neventually infiltrates or evaporates.  \n12.  Extensive swamplands lie within the Nuku\u2019alofa urban area, notably in the areas of \nPopua to the east of the primary urban area and Sopu to the west. These areas have been, and \n                                                 \n5  A 1-day manual traffic count conducted in June 2006 over an 11-hour period recorded nearly 11,000 vehicle \nmovements on Taufa'ahau Road, the main artery into the urban area. This represents an increase of 270% over \nresults of a survey completed in 1999. ", "Appendix 2   25 \ncontinue to be, subdivided into residential plots to meet land entitlement pressures under the \nland tenure regulations. This results in ad hoc land filling and blocking of natural drainage ways.  \n13.  Sanitary facilities in Nuku\u2019alofa still include some pit latrines but consist primarily of flush \ntoilets with septic tanks and vertical soakaways. The TIUDP Survey indicates that 84% of the \n431  households  surveyed  utilize  septic  tank  systems  (footnote  2).  Septic  tank  pumping \nfrequency was also found to vary markedly, ranging from weekly pumping for some downtown \nrestaurants and other businesses to several years in the case of residences. Sludge from the \npumping operations is taken to the sludge beds at Patangata but will be taken to the new \nTapuhia sanitary landfill facility once it is fully operational. Many septic tanks are undersized, \nand it is suspected that numerous tanks may have been improperly constructed prior to the \nadoption of formal permit review procedures. This raises potential environmental and health \nconcerns  of  possible  surface  inundation  of  contaminated  wastewater  during  times  of  high \ngroundwater and flooding.  \n14.  It  is  also  suspected  that  current  sanitation  practices  heighten  the  potential  for \ncontamination of the fragile groundwater aquifer and surrounding nearshore reef and lagoon. \nThis is important because the island primarily relies on groundwater resources for its water \nsupply. The Tonga Water Board has reported little or no fecal coliforms in tests taken thus far, \nbut little is known of groundwater conditions and quality throughout much of the aquifer system.  \n15.  An estimated 95% of households in the urban Nuku\u2019alofa area have access to the water \nsupply system operated by the Water Board. Supply is by means of a reticulated system, \ndrawing on groundwater from the Mataki\u2019eua well fields about 5 kilometers southwest of the \ntown center. The aquifer\u2019s salinity increases with proximity to the sea and Fanga\u2019uta Lagoon.  \n16.  In March 2004, AusAID initiated a 4-year solid waste management project for Tonga. \nThe  project  involves  closing  the  dump  site  at  Patangata  and  developing  a  new  landfill  at \nTapuhia with a proper liner, leachate treatment, and sludge drying beds.  \n \nC.  Urban Sector Institutions \n \n17.  In the wake of significant government restructuring and downsizing in 2006, the roles of \nagencies involved in urban planning and management are in a state of flux. Broadly, the \nplanning and provision of urban services is undertaken by MOW (roads, drainage, and major \nprojects), Tonga Water Board (water supply), and Ministry of Civil Aviation, Marine and Ports \n(airports and ports). The latter was to be renamed the Ministry of Transport in July 2007. It will \nassume planning responsibilities for roads, while construction and maintenance will remain with \nMOW. A new Waste Management Authority came into being in October 2006 and will be \nresponsible for solid waste collection, management, and disposal under the guidance of its \nBoard.  There  are  no  centralized  sewerage  systems  in  Tonga,  and  on-plot  sanitation  has \npreviously been overseen by the Ministry of Health. It is understood that this responsibility is \nlikely to move to the MOW in the future.  \n18.  Little or no strategic or urban spatial planning is being undertaken in Tonga. Strategic \nspatial planning is not within the current mandate of the Ministry of Lands, Surveys and Natural \nResources (MLSNR). The work carried out by the Department of the Environment, in terms of \nglobal resource management planning for Tonga, goes some way toward broad-based spatial \nplanning. However, this activity is not currently based upon any law. \n19.  The Central Planning Department, previously a separate body reporting to the Deputy \nPrime Minister, merged with the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning in early July 2006. \nThe planning work undertaken by the Department and its associated agencies is primarily \nnational and economic in nature. A wide range of activities that relate to urban planning and \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nmanagement are being undertaken, albeit in a rather ad hoc and uncoordinated manner. No \nagency in Tonga is charged with preparing spatial plans. Consequently, no plan-making takes \nplace for either urban areas or other localities. \n20.  With no forward planning and no plans, there are no spatial guidelines to assist decision \nmaking on either strategic or local development issues, particularly infrastructure investments. \nThere is also no structured identification of development issues that might arise, such as the \nprovision of urban services. As described above, land development is primarily driven by the \nland tenure system. The subdivision of lots is reviewed, registered, and mapped by MLSNR, but \nthis is only in response to subdivision proposals rather than as part of an overall forward-looking \nplan. ", "Appendix 3   27 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE URBAN SECTOR \n1.  Previous Urban Projects. As shown in Table A3, there has been only relatively limited \nassistance  from  international  multilateral  or  bilateral  donors  for  Tonga\u2019s  urban  sector. \nHistorically, much of the assistance has been focused on rural areas and the outer island \ngroups. \n2.  In Nuku\u2019alofa, previous projects have been mostly ad hoc and limited in scope. However, \nthere have been a number of exceptions. The Government of Japan has provided grant finance \nto a number of water supply projects including the Nuku\u2019alofa Water Supply Project in 2000. The \nNuku\u2019alofa Urban Roads and Drainage Study of 1993 was funded by Australian Agency for \nInternational Development (AusAID) under a 9-year institutional strengthening program. Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  provided  grants  for  upgrading  of  the  road  from \nNuku\u2019alofa to the airport. The, and this includes some roadside drainage in the central business \narea.  AusAID  is  currently  providing  assistance  to  the  Government  for  reconstructing  the \nNuku'alofa's central business area that was damaged during civil unrest on 16 November 2006. \n3.  Community  Assistance  Projects.  Several agencies provide support for community \ninitiatives. These include village and household infrastructure, and particularly for water supply. \nThese are national schemes that include projects in the Nuku'alofa urban area. Examples of \nthese  are  the  Tonga/Australia  Community  Assistance  Scheme  by  AusAID,  the  Grassroots \nProject by JICA, and the Community Development Fund by New Zealand\u2019s International Aid and \nDevelopment Agency (NZAID).  \n4.  Solid  Waste  Management.  In March 2004, AusAID initiated a 4-year Solid Waste \nManagement Project for Tonga. The project involves closing the dump site at Patangata and \ndeveloping a new landfill at Tapuhia with a proper liner, leachate treatment, and sludge drying \nbeds. The solid waste project includes (i) constructing a sanitary landfill site, (ii) a community \ninformation and participation campaign, (iii) establishing adequate institutional capacity for the \ndelivery of solid waste management services, (iv) enacting the Waste Management Act and \nestablishing  the  Waste  Management  Authority,  (v)  establishing  an  appropriate  solid  waste \ncollection system for Tongatapu, and (vi) setting up of an efficient solid waste management \nfacility operation. \n5.  NZAID is funding rehabilitation of the existing dump site at Popua, once the new landfill \nfacility is operational. \n6.  Transport  Sector.  World Bank is funding an ongoing Transport, Infrastructure and \nAsset Management Reform Project. This project is evaluating the transport sector in Tonga, \nincluding institutional structures, regulations, policy and planning, operations management, and \nservice delivery. It is also assessing options for sustainable financing, including opportunities for \ncorporatization and privatization. \n7.  Water Supply. Several agencies are involved in water supply projects, mostly outside \nNuku'alofa, particularly the European Union and JICA. As noted above, the Government of \nJapan provided grant assistance for the improvement of the Nuku\u2019alofa Water Supply. The \nDanish  International  Development  Assistance  has  undertaken  an  appraisal  for  a  potential \nproject including the upgrading of parts of the Nuku\u2019alofa area distribution network. \n8.   Environment and Sustainability. The United Nations Development Programme has \nbeen supporting the strengthening of environmental management for a number of years, and it \nhas  three  ongoing  projects  in  the  Ministry  of  Lands,  Surveys,  Natural  Resources  and \nEnvironment.  These  are  the  National  Biodiversity  Strategy  Plan,  the  Sustainable  Lands \nManagement Project, and the National Capacity for Self-Assessment Project.  \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \n \n9.

", "Appendix 4  29 \nCORE SUBPROJECT OUTLINES \n \nA.  Drainage Rehabilitation and Maintenance Program \n1.  The  drainage  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  program  is  intended  to  address  the \nlocalized flooding issue through rehabilitation of existing stormwater drainage systems. The \nsubproject  consists  of  two  parts:  (i)  procurement  of  equipment,  and  (ii)  cleaning  and \nrehabilitation of the drainage systems. \n \n2.  Equipment  to  be  procured  includes  (i)  a  jet-and-vacuum  truck  with  a  capacity  of \napproximately  4.9  m3  to  enable  the  Ministry  of  Works  (MOW)  to  clean  pipe  and  culvert \nstormwater drainage systems, and (ii) street sweeping equipment to reduce the frequency of \nstormwater  drain  cleaning.  As  the  stormwater  drainage  systems  are  small,  the  equipment \nrequired can be purchased from the smaller end of the range available in the market. \n \n3.  Given the magnitude of the stormwater drainage cleaning operation, required, bids for \nthe contract will be sought internationally and the contract will include provisions for employment \nand training of local staff to ensure that future cleaning operations can be performed by local \npersonnel. The contract will also include replacement or repair of damaged system components. \n \nB.  Sopu Drainage Channel \n4.  A 2.1-kilometer (km),  gabion-lined drainage channel extending from  Hofoa Road to \nTukingapahu Road in the Sopu area will be constructed. Initially, liners of clay or concrete were \nconsidered. Clay was subsequently ruled out due to its propensity to scour during a large \nvolume storm event. Concrete was rejected, especially due to its high costs and constructability \nproblems that could be anticipated given the high groundwater elevations in this area. Gabions \nwere selected as a relatively inexpensive way to prevent scouring of the channel sides and \nbottom.  Furthermore,  as  the  gabions  are  permeable,  they  will  allow  groundwater  to  pass \nthrough the channel liner rather than exert hydrostatic pressure on the underside of the channel \nlining. Once the channel has been excavated to the desired elevation, the gabion wire baskets \nand  mats  may  be  set  in  place  and  then  filled  with  stone.  Consequently,  the  dewatering \nrequirements are greatly reduced. \n \n5.  Levees will be installed to the outside of the top gabions along both sides of the channel \nto provide access to the channel for periodic maintenance. The elevation of the levees will be \nsimilar to existing filled lots in the area so that as allotment recipients develop the adjacent lots \nthey can fill to elevations that will allow their lots to drain without blocking drainage from the lots \nfurther away. Five concrete box culverts will be constructed to provide road crossings, including \nan  outlet  structure  at  Hofoa  Road.  The  culverts  are  1.0\u20131.2  meters  (m)  high  due  to  the \nlimitations induced by existing roads and developed lots. Consequently, most of the culverts are \nthe two-barrel type to provide sufficient flow area to accommodate the design storm event.  \n \n6.  The entire channel will be fenced for public safety reasons. \n \nC.  Taufa'ahau Road Upgrade \n7.  The main feature of the subproject is the construction of a 3.1-km center turning lane on \nTaufa\u2019ahau Road from south of the Vaha\u2019akolo Road turnoff to Alaivahamama\u2019o Road. As the \nroadway nears significant intersections, the center lane will become a dedicated turning lane for \nthe intersection. A center lane will be added by expanding the roadway by 1.5 m along both \n ", "30  Appendix 4 \nsides. Some minor route adjustments may be made to minimize power pole relocations or \nsimilar technical considerations. Repairs will be made to the existing pavement surface, as \nrequired, and a new bituminous surface layer will be applied to reseal the surface. Upon \ncompletion, a rubberized paint striping system will be applied to direct traffic regarding the use \nof the lane. \n \n8.  The subproject also includes construction of sidewalks on both sides of the road, as \nrequired.  Essentially,  sidewalks  are  required  on  the  eastern  side  of  the  roadway  from \nVaha\u2019akolo to Holomui and from Mateialona to the Basilica of St. Anthony of Padua and on the \nwestern side from Vaha\u2019akolo to Navy Road. The subproject also includes rehabilitation of the \nexisting stormwater collection systems, addition of a new stormwater collection system north of \nAlaivahamama'o that will discharge to the lagoon southeast of the Alaivahamama'o intersection, \nand installation of a traffic control light at the Alaivahamama'o Road intersection.  \n \n9.  The elevation of the existing roadway is in the range of 1.0\u20131.5 m. Consequently, there \nis inadequate vertical differential in the available topography to allow for a conventional gravity \ndrain stormwater collection system. The system designed for this location will consist of a \ncombination stormwater collection and infiltration system. A key component of the stormwater \nsystem consists of three-chambered silt separation boxes to allow for removal of sand, silt, and \ndebris from the stormwater prior to entering the interconnecting infiltration chambers. An inlet \nbox will be constructed directly across the street from each silt separation box to collect runoff \nfrom that side of the street. A reinforced concrete pipe culvert will cross the street to bring flows \nto the infiltration system. The infiltration chambers will be installed below the sidewalks on one \nside of the road.  \n \nD.  Alaivahamama'o Road Upgrade \n10.  The subproject involves resurfacing Alaivahamama\u2019o Road from the intersection with \nVaha\u2019akolo Road to the intersection with Tupoulahi Road and constructing sidewalks on both \nsides  of  the  road  from  Vaha\u2019akolo  Road  to  Fatafehi  Road  and  the  northern  side  of \nAlaivahamama'o  Road  from  Fatafehi  Road  to  Tupoulahi  Road.  A  sidewalk  will  also  be \nconstructed  from  the  intersection  of  Alaivahamama'o  Road  and  Fatafehi  Road  to  the \nCommunity Development Center (formerly Tonga High School) located on Fatafehi Road. \n \n11.  In addition to adding sidewalks and resurfacing the roadway, the stormwater drainage \nsystem will be upgraded. This upgrade entails reshaping existing drainage ditches on the north \nside of the road west of Taufa\u2019ahau and on the south side in front of the Ministry of Works \nheadquarters. The drainage ditches on the south side of the road east of Taufa\u2019ahau Road will \nbe rehabilitated along with the ditch and outfall running south to a discharge point in the lagoon. \nA subsurface drain-line will be constructed to connect the western drainage ditches to the \nexisting ditch on the southeast corner of the Taufa\u2019ahau intersection, and the existing culvert \ncrossing at Fatafehi Road will be rehabilitated to address ponding in that vicinity. New storm \ninlets and silt separation boxes will be constructed on the north side of Alaivahamama'o Road in \nthe low points between Fatafehi Road and Tupoulahi Road and interconnected with subsurface \ninfiltration chambers. Any excess flow in the infiltration chambers will discharge into the existing \nbox culvert and outlet located around 80 m west of Tupoulahi Road. \n \nE.  Vaha'akolo Road Upgrade \n12.  Vaha\u2019akolo Road is used as an alternate route into the town center from the south. The \nroad has far exceeded its design life and is subjected to a continual cycle of pothole patching. ", "Appendix 4  31 \nThe entire roadway requires resurfacing. To properly accomplish this, the surface must be \nscarified, the sub-base repaired as needed, and new surface layers applied. In addition, the \nsubproject will rehabilitate the stormwater drains and culverts in the vicinity of Tupou High \nSchool  and  will  provide  sidewalks  from  the  school  to  the  Vaha\u2019akolo  Road  and  By-Pass \nintersection. The length of the road subject to surface restoration is 4,600 m. In addition, \napproximately 800 m of stormwater drains will be rehabilitated and 800 m of sidewalk will be \nconstructed. \n \nF.  Popua and Sopu Secondary and Access Roads \n13.  The subproject entails repairs and surface refurbishment, as well as extension of about 4 \nkm of secondary and access roads in the Sopu and Popua areas. These roads will consist of \nbase rock pushed along the alignments to an elevation sufficient to provide drainage swales \nalong the roadways as the lots are filled adjacent to the roadways. In Popua, the selected \nelevation is 2.8 m above mean sea level. Thus, the road surface will be 1.0 m above the highest \nastronomical tide of 1.5 m plus another 0.3 m for sea surge. Due to the distance inland of the \nSopu area, much of the tidal influence is attenuated and sea surge is generally not a factor. \nConsequently, the usual water surface elevation adjacent to Hofoa Road is anticipated to be \naround 0.0 above mean sea level. Therefore the required elevation of the access roads in the \nSopu region is only 1.0 m above mean sea level. \n \nG.  Groundwater Monitoring Well Program \n14.  The subproject consists of installing eight monitoring wells. This includes three wells in \nstrategic locations between Vuna Road and the nearshore reef, two monitoring wells between \nAlaivahamama\u2019o Road and the lagoon, and two wells between Taufa\u2019ahau Road and the lagoon. \nOne monitoring well in the well field area will also be installed to provide background data to \ncompare to the coastal findings. Collected monthly samples from the monitoring wells will be \nanalyzed for a range of parameters, including the following: (i) total phosphorous (TP), (ii) \n \northophosphate (Ortho-P), (iii) ammonia (NH ), (iv) total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), (v) E. coli, and \n4\n(vi) total coliforms. \n \n ", " \n  3\n2\n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \nA\n  p\np\ne\n     T$'000         $\u2019000    % of  n\nd\nTotal  ix\nItem  Foreign  Local  Total  Foreign  Local  Total   5\n  Base   \nExchange Currency Cost  Exchange Currency Cost \n   Cost \nA.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Tonga \n \nSome 23% of Tongan households are estimated to experience periodic difficulties in meeting their basic needs. \nThe  Tonga  hardship  and  poverty  assessment  (2004)  identified  causes  of  poverty  as  the  lack  of  income \nopportunities and limited access to basic social services. Tonga has made progress toward achieving many of the \ntargets in the Millennium Development Goals and access to safe water is widespread. \n \nAs Tonga\u2019s economic growth prospects improve, so will pressure on urban areas, especially Nuku\u2019alofa. It is \nforecast  that  Nuku\u2019alofa  will  have  to  accommodate  up  to  1,000  new  households  during  2007\u20132020.  The \nConstitution of Tonga provides for allocation of land to every adult male citizen in both the town (town allotments) \nand rural areas (tax allotments). With growing urbanization, it has become increasingly difficult for the Government \nto meet this obligation, and it often must provide marginal land. Growing demand for town allotments in urban areas \nhas forced urban expansion onto wetlands. It is estimated that there are more than 1,000 households already living \nin the wetlands. Hundreds more such allotments have been made but not yet occupied. As a result, many people in \nNuku\u2019alofa live in low-lying areas unsuitable for housing. With decreasing availability of suitable land and a rapidly \ngrowing urban population, social services in Nuku\u2019alofa are deteriorating and sanitation, drainage, roads, and waste \ndisposal need attention. Coupled with recurring flooding in the low-lying areas, health and social indicators are \ndeclining. Tonga\u2019s limited land resources, combined with the growing urban population, are increasing pressure on \nNuku\u2019alofa\u2019s living conditions. The Government acknowledges that in order to sustain growth, health, education, \nwater  and  sanitation,  physical  infrastructure,  and  the  environment  must  be  improved.  With  improved  urban \nservices, the Project will give lower income groups access to higher quality land and reduce the threat of flooding.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nA  detailed  social  and  poverty  analysis  was  completed  under  TA4648-TON.1  The  analysis  identified  that  a \nsignificant proportion of a random sample of urban households faced economic hardship. In the sample of 431 \nhouseholds, 3.4% had incomes of less than T$50 per week, 23.8% had T$50\u2013T$100 per week, and 42.2% had \nT$101\u2013T$300 per week. (ADB\u2019s poverty assessment in 2003 estimated that the basic needs poverty line was \nT$28.18 per capita per week and the food poverty line was T$13.52. Using an average household size of seven, \nthis equates to household incomes of T$197 and T$95 per week, respectively). In the sample households, 43.8% \nhad no access to agricultural land. Those households in greatest need are living in low-lying areas, and it is \nestimated that over 1,000 households reside in these areas in Popua and Sopu. Further, many allotments allocated \nby the Government in wetland areas are being filled but are not yet occupied. Because of the cost of fill material, \nreclaiming the wetlands takes low-income families many years to achieve and typically requires them to mortgage \nthe lot to pay for the improvements. The prevalence of poverty is notably higher among the residents of these areas \nthan for urban households overall. The selected infrastructure projects for improvements in roads and drainage will \nbenefit the poor, and particularly those residing in low-lying areas, by improving the overall conditions and \nstandards of drainage and public health. The project components were developed based on the detailed poverty \nanalysis conducted through various participatory approaches during the project preparatory stage. During project \nimplementation, the project management unit will be responsible to ensure that the findings of the poverty analysis \nremain valid. This will be achieved through an ongoing program of household sampling and interviews. The project \nperformance management system will include indicators to assist in monitoring the Project's impact on poverty.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006 Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Tonga for Preparing the Tonga Integrated Urban Development \nProject. Manila (TA 4648-TON). \n ", "40  Appendix 9   \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes       No  \nThe project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) employed a participatory approach, engaging with a wide \nvariety of stakeholders throughout the country. The social assessment component was based on (i) 16 workshops \nthat altogether included over 300 participants on community needs assessment and involved particular interest \ngroups, women, youth, and community leaders, as well as church leaders in 'Eua, Ha\u2019apai, Tongatapu, and Vava\u2019u; \nand (ii) a socioeconomic survey of 431 randomly selected households in Nuku\u2019alofa. A detailed Report of the \nParticipatory Assessment of Social Needs has been produced by the Integrated Urban Development Sector \nProject.  \nA workshop on household and community development needs was held with representatives of communities in the \nlow-lying and generally low-income areas of Patangata, Popua, and Sopu. Participants in this workshop identified \ndrainage and land access issues as major concerns, along with water supply and sanitation. The lack of community \nspaces, fencing and animal control, and education facilities, as well as the quality of housing and lack of health \nfacilities in the area were also common concerns. Solutions identified to resolve those issues ranged from improved \ninfrastructure, such as water supply, sanitation, housing, roads, and electricity, to such other infrastructure as public \nspaces, sports facilities, and community centers. Other solutions included improvements in fencing and animal \nmanagement, the aesthetics of the community, drainage, waste control, and programs for youth. \nThe construction of the Sopu Drainage Channel under the drainage component will be conducted in close \nconsultation with the affected residents, who have already approved the design concept and will be consulted again \nbefore the design is finalized. Road improvements will not require a participation strategy as the easements already \nexist and there is strong support from stakeholders for the proposed road improvements. The monitoring wells have \nno participation implications.  \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                    No    \nAn environment and social unit (ESU) will be created within MOW and will be established within 3 months of grant \neffectiveness.  The unit will be responsible, among others, for public relations and consultation. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nTonga has many nongovernment organizations that work mainly with women on household improvement and \nincome  generation  assistance.  These  women\u2019s  organizations  were  consulted  during  PPTA  fact-finding  and \nidentified for membership on the TA Steering Committee. Gender analysis was conducted during the PPTA to \nidentify strategies for addressing gender issues. Workshops on community and development needs involved \nleaders of women\u2019s nongovernmental organizations and representatives of the women\u2019s community. More than half \nof the people interviewed for a household survey of Nuku\u2019alofa on socioeconomic, social service, and infrastructure \nissues were women. The workshops and survey revealed that women and men share most of the same concerns, \nsuch as cost of living, landlessness, and unemployment (particularly of young people). These found many low-\nincome households in Nuku'alofa are supported by women's earnings from raising pigs, growing vegetables, and \nmaking tapa cloth and mats for sale.  \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes      No     \nNo gender strategy is required. Urban road improvements will not require a gender strategy, as the upgrading and \ndrainage will benefit both men and women alike, including those living near the roads or using the roads as \npedestrians or motorists. Male and female beneficiaries of the Sopu Drainage Channel, as well as other holders of \nregistered leases and allotments resident in Tonga, have been consulted at each stage of the conceptual design. \n ", "  Appendix 9  41 \nConcerns expressed by women and men are addressed in the Short Resettlement Plan. \n \nE.

The total area of land that will need to be \npermanently acquired is estimated at 7,500 m2. About \n5,000 m2 will be acquired on a temporary basis for storing \nconstruction equipment and materials and for a temporary \nspoil stockpiling area. No physical resettlement will be \nrequired for the Sopu channel activity or for any of the \nother  components.  A  short  resettlement  plan  will  be \nprepared nevertheless to demonstrate how landholders \nwill be compensated for loss of land and trees.

Introduction \n1.  The  Government  of  Tonga  has  identified  enhanced  urban  services  as  essential  for \ninclusive growth and poverty reduction. The Integrated Urban Development Sector Project will \ncontribute  (through  flood  mitigation  measures  in  low-lying  and  low-income  residential  areas; \nimproved major road arteries; reduced vehicular-pedestrian conflicts; rehabilitated and extended \nroadside drainage; extended, repaired, and sealed access roads in low-lying residential areas; \nand enhanced monitoring of groundwater quality) to the improvement of urban infrastructure in \nNuku\u2019alofa, the country\u2019s national capital and largest urban area. The Project, which will be \nimplemented by the Ministry of Works (MOW), will also enhance capacities in urban planning, \nproject management, and maintenance. The Project will be financed under an Asian Development \nBank (ADB) grant with counterpart funding from the Government. \n \n2.  This  short  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP)  has  been  prepared  in \naccordance with the Government\u2019s laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy (1995) for the Sopu Drainage Channel Subproject. The LARP was prepared following \nsurveys and investigations of preliminary technical designs and will be updated during detailed \ntechnical design. \n \nB.  Scope of Resettlement Impacts \n3.    The Subproject will include constructing a 2.1-km drainage channel through a mainly \nresidential area comprising both developed (reclaimed) and undeveloped land parcels. As the \narea is developed for housing and land is filled, undeveloped blocks are subject to ponding of \ntrapped water. The Sopu Drainage Channel will connect the largest isolated open water areas \nto the watershed outlet, allowing these areas to periodically flush during rain storms, thereby \nreducing the health hazards they presently induce. It will also provide a drainage route during \nstorms to counter runoff\u2019s backing up into existing homes. Further, the drainage channel will \nestablish a legal drainage easement within which no further construction will take place. It has \nbeen  recommended  that  as  the  road  network  in  this  area  is  expanded  there  should  be \nprovisions for a stormwater collection system with outlets terminating in the proposed channel. \n \n4.  The drainage channel\u2019s original design would have affected 48 land parcels and might \nhave resulted in relocating two or three households. After careful consideration, the channel \ndesign was realigned so that only 46 land parcels are affected and no physical resettlement will \nbe required. The drainage channel\u2019s alignment has been carefully designed to minimize loss to \ndeveloped properties by following subdivision boundaries. The channel will be constructed on \ninundated swampland characterized by large bodies of open water with poor quality mangroves \nand other aquatic weeds. In most cases, the design takes a slice of land from parcels of land on \neither side of the boundary. Of the 46 affected parcels, 8 are reclaimed and have structures, \nanother  8  are  reclaimed  or  partly  reclaimed  but  unoccupied,  and  the  remaining  30  are \nun-reclaimed. There are no crops or fruit trees planted within the vicinity of the proposed \nchannel due to the swampy nature of the area, and the number of affected trees is therefore \nvery limited. Due to its nature, the area is also not used for any livelihoods. \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  43 \n5.  Before the final design is completed, the land will be resurveyed so that residential lots \ncan be realigned to ensure that their reduction in size does not fall below the minimum permitted \narea. All affected landholders will be compensated for loss of land, crops, and trees. \n \nC.  Resettlement Plan Objectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements \n1.  Eligibility Criteria and Types of Losses \n \n6.  A  detailed  measurement  survey  will  be  used  to  identify  eligible  households  and \nindividuals, and the cutoff date associated with it (the end of the survey) is used to discourage \nany party from taking improper advantage of the compensation measures. People moving into \nthe area or starting to use resources after the cutoff date are not eligible for compensation and \nlivelihood  restoration.  Eligible  households  and  individuals  have  the  entitlements  discussed \nbelow. \n \n7.  Temporary Loss of Land. No compensation will be paid for temporary loss of land, but \nan annual lease of 15% of the value of the affected land will be paid to the landowner before the \nstart of civil works. After the use, the land will be restored to its original condition or improved \nand then returned to the landholder. For affected leaseholders and users without land titles, an \neasement fee of 15% of the value of the affected land will be paid before the start of civil works.  \n \n8.  Permanent  Loss  of  Land.  For construction sites and permanently used land, cash \ncompensation for the affected portion of land will be paid to the landholder before the start of civil \nworks. At the time of elaborating this LARP, the market value was determined by the Ministry of \nLand to be T$25 per square meter (m2) for improved land and T$7.14 for unimproved land. The \nvalues will be updated based on the detailed measurement survey. If the remaining portion of \naffected land is no longer viable for continuous use, compensation at replacement value for the \nentire land will be provided and\u2014if the landholder so requests\u2014assistance to find a similar piece \nof  land.  All  transaction  costs  associated  with  landownership  transfer  or  establishing  lease \nagreements will be borne by the Project. Affected leaseholders and untitled users will be assisted \nto find similar pieces of land and all transaction and moving costs will be borne by the Project. \n9.  Loss of Crops and Trees. For loss of annual crops on land temporarily or permanently \nused, cash compensation equivalent to the market value of each crop at the time of anticipated \nharvest will be paid to the crops\u2019 owner (who does not need to be the owner or leaser of the \nland). For the loss of other crops and trees, cash compensation will be paid to the owner of the \ncrops and trees (who need not be the owner of the land). In updating the LARP, the MOW and \nMinistry of Lands, Survey, Natural Resources and Environment will fine-tune compensation \nrates along with the affected persons for the different species, types, ages, and productivities. \n10.  Special  Assistance  for  Vulnerable  Populations.  The  Project  will  pay  particular \nattention to the needs of vulnerable groups, and especially those below the poverty line, the \nlandless,  the  elderly,  women  and  children,  indigenous  peoples,  or  persons  without  legal \nentitlements and ensure that their living standards are enhanced.  \n11.  A matrix summarizing the compensation and entitlements is shown in Table A10.4. \nD.  Disclosure, Consultation, and Grievance Mechanism \n \n12.  All affected households were consulted twice\u2014first for the original proposed design, and \nsecondly  after  the  design  was  amended  to  minimize  resettlement  impacts.  Both  men  and \n ", "44  Appendix 10   \nwomen  were  consulted,  and  all  expressed  appreciation  for  the  proposed  Sopu  Drainage \nChannel. In addition, the town officers responsible for each community were briefed on the \nproposed plan and invited to comment. The draft LARP was distributed in the Tongan language \nto all affected persons who could be contacted and explained orally in the Tongan language. \n \nE.  Grievance Redress Mechanisms \n13.  Any grievances or complaints from the affected people shall be resolved by the Project in \na  timely  and  satisfactory  manner.  While  the  Land  Act  suggests  that  grievances  should  be \naddressed through the Land Court, the project grievance redress mechanism (Table A10.1) has \nbeen  specifically  designed,  where  possible,    to  resolve  grievances  while  avoiding  recourse \nthrough the Land Court and to utilize existing structures within Tonga for dispute resolution.  \n \nTable A10.1: Grievance Redress Framework \n \nStage  Process  Time Frame \n1.  Affected person submits grievance to village fono in person or   \nthrough Town Officer. \n2.  Town Officer deals with grievance and reports back to  2 days \naffected person. \n  If unresolved,   \n3a.  affected person and/or Town Officer take grievance to  Within 2 weeks of receipt of decision in \nIUDSP environment and social unit\u2019s resettlement and/or  Step 2 \ncommunity liaison officer. \n3b.  issue is discussed at TIUDSP liaison meeting.  1 week \n3c.

Step 8 \nIUDP = Integrated Urban Development Sector Project. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n14.  All costs incurred in addressing grievances and dispute resolution will be borne by the \nGovernment. Affected persons are also entitled to compensation for loss of income or any other \nexpenses (such as transportation) that they may incur in the process of resolving their grievances. \n \nF.  Social Impact Assessment \n15.  While in Nuku'alofa as a whole about 27% of households are in the two lowest income \ncategories  (including  3%  reporting  \u201cno  regular  income\u201d),  in  Sopu-Kolomotu'a  over  55%  of \nhouseholds are in these categories. The main income sources are employment in government, \noverseas remittances and, among those with very low incomes, from raising pigs and making \ntapa cloth and mats for sale. In Nuku'alofa as a whole approximately 20% of houses are built of \nconcrete or brick, but in the Sopu area this figure is below 10%. Some 88% of Sopu households \nreported informally disposing of solid waste in the swamp, bush, or sea. The overall figure is \nmuch lower.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  45 \n16.  Twice as many households in the Sopu area are headed by women. Female-headed \nhouseholds are more likely to have low incomes, because women\u2019s participation in the paid \nlabor force, and especially in better paid occupations, is lower than men's, and because many \nwomen heading households are elderly and dependent on their children or other relatives for \nsupport. As women have no legal means to own land, their access to subsistence and/or \ncommercial farming is limited. One female-headed household will lose land as a result of the \nchannel\u2019s construction. \n \nG.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n17.  MOW will undertake monthly monitoring of the resettlement plan implementation. In \ncarrying out all activities related to monitoring, evaluation, and supervision, consideration will be \ngiven to gender issues in accordance with the ADB Policy on Gender and Development (1998) \nand the Gender Checklist: Resettlement (2003). \n \n18.  The following indicators will be monitored regularly:  \n(i)  payment  of  compensation  to  affected  persons  in  various  categories  with  no \ndiscrimination according to gender, ethnicity, or any other factor; \n(ii)  public information dissemination and consultation procedures;  \n(iii)  adherence to grievance procedures, outstanding issues requiring management\u2019s \nattention, and equality of access;  \n(iv)  attention given to affected persons\u2019 priorities with regard to options offered; and  \n(v)  Coordination and completion of resettlement activities and award of civil works \ncontracts. \n \nH.  Resettlement Costs \n19.  ADB  involuntary  resettlement  policy  requires  that  where  involuntary  resettlement  is \nunavoidable affected persons must receive assistance so that they would be at least as well off \nas they would have been in the absence of the Project. Therefore, compensation for loss of \nassets must be at least equal to or greater than the replacement cost of the asset. Records of \nrecent lease sales by landholders in the Sopu area have been used as a guideline for assessing \ncompensation for loss of land. The recent registered sale price for an improved (reclaimed) plot \nof residential land measuring 758 m2 in the Sopu area was T$25.00 per square meter (or \nT$18,950 for the plot). The value of unimproved swampland is estimated at approximately \nT$7.19 per m2. For unimproved swampland classified as agricultural land, the same valuation \nwould apply since these parcels of land are unsuitable for agricultural use and will likely be \nsubdivided into residential allotments. \n \n20.  The values of trees and crops will be calculated on the basis of market rates. The \nMinistry of Agriculture and Forestry\u2019s standard rates will be adopted as a guide for estimating \nbudget requirements. Where Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry standard rates for a specific \nspecies of tree do not exist, the tree will by valued by its potential utility (i.e., whether it can be \nused for timber or posts). Standing trees within the affected area will be categorized into three \nsizes, namely small (100 mm), medium (150 mm), and large (200 mm or more). Rates upon \nwhich to base compensation estimates for such trees are available from Tonga Timber Limited. \n \n21.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  pay  compensation  for  land  or  assets  lost  due  to \nconstructing the Sopu Drainage Channel. During detailed design, the channel alignment will be \nselected to minimize the need for land acquisition and loss of assets. As most of the affected \nlots are unoccupied, there is potential to realign lot boundaries to ensure none are smaller than \n ", "46  Appendix 10   \nthe minimum legal requirement of 758 m2. The amount of compensation payable for the loss of \nland will not be limited to the market value of the land itself and will include all consequential \nlosses suffered by the affected holder as a result of the compulsory acquisition. For the Sopu \nDrain Project impact area, the preferred means of compensation is in cash. \n \n22.  The estimate of the total compensation budget is shown in Table A10.2. It is important to \nnote that this is based on preliminary designs and surveys and will change after detailed design.  \nTable A10.2: Estimated Budget for Compensation \n \nItem for Compensation  Number  Amount T$ \nRegistered, Leased, and Allocated Lots  46  208,555.32  \nImprovements   1  3,000.00  \nTrees  481  12,764.55  \nTotal Indicative Budget for Compensation  224,319.87 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nI.  Implementation Arrangements and Schedule \n \n1.  Institutional Framework \n23.  An environment and social unit (ESU) will be formed within the project management unit \nto be formed by the MOW to implement the Project. The ESU will be responsible for planning, \nimplementing, and coordinating land acquisition, resettlement, and environmental activities. The \nESU will be staffed by a land acquisition and community relations officer and an environmental \nofficer.  The  Crown  Law  Department  will  provide  overall  guidance  on  the  Government\u2019s \nrequirements and legal issues relating to land acquisition. The operations of the ESU may be \nfinanced through grant funds for the duration of project implementation.  \n24.  All  resettlement  activities,  including  full  payment  of  compensation  entitlements  and \nrealignment  of  lot  boundaries,  will  be  completed  before  construction.  An  indicative \nimplementation schedule for resettlement activities is presented in Table A10.3.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Project has been categorized as category B, requiring the preparation of an initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE). The IEE was prepared in accordance with the Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and complies with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002).  It  takes  into  consideration  the  government  environmental  act \n(2003).1 This summary IEE outlines the findings and recommendations of the IEE concerning \nimprovement and reconstruction of drainage systems, road rehabilitation, and installation of \nwater quality monitoring wells.  \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  The overall objective of the Integrated Urban Development Sector Project (IUDSP) is to \nimprove rundown urban infrastructure assets identified during the IUDSP consultation process. \nSeven core subprojects have been selected. All of the subprojects involve minor civil works and \nare located in urban areas surrounding Nuku\u2019alofa. \n \n3.  The  core  subprojects  have  been  selected  from  a  long  list  prepared  during  project \npreparation and confirmed by the Government. The seven subprojects are briefly described \nbelow: \nTable A11.1: Integrated Urban Development Sector Project Core Subprojects \nDrainage Work  Description \nCentral District Drainage  Improvement  and  rehabilitation  of  the  existing  drainage  system  in  the  central \nSystem  Cleaning  and  commercial  area  of  Nuku\u2019alofa  and  along  the  main  sea  frontage  of  Vuna  Road. \nRepair   Maintenance of the structures will be facilitated by the purchase of street sweeping \nequipment and a jet-and-vacuum truck to clean stormwater drains. \nSopu Drainage Channel  Excavation and construction of a gabion-lined drainage channel through the low-lying \narea of Sopu, which will drain currently impounded water within residential areas to a \nnearby coastal swamp area. The channel will reduce flooding and health hazards. \nRoad  Rehabilitation   \nWork \nTaufa\u2019ahau  Road  is  the  town\u2019s  main  arterial  route.  The  road  will  be  widened, \nTaufa'ahau Road \nresurfaced, provided with a turning lane, and sidewalks will be constructed on both \nUpgrade \nsides of the road. Existing stormwater collection systems will be rehabilitated. \nAlaivahamama'o Road  Alaivahamama\u2019o Road is one of Nuku'alofa's busiest. Rehabilitation work includes \nUpgrade  widening, resurfacing, and providing sidewalks.

The Project has been costed at $14.68 million, of which ADB will finance $11.30 million. \nThe works will be undertaken by a project management, design and supervision consultant \nthrough a project management unit (PMU) located within the Ministry of Works (MOW), which is \nthe Executing Agency. Construction will be undertaken by contractors. Work is planned for a \n3-year period commencing in December 2007. \n \nC.   Description of the Environment \n \n  1.  Physical Resources \n5.  The Project is located in the capital Nuku\u2019alofa (population 34,000) on the island of \nTongatapu, which at 260 km2 is Tonga\u2019s largest island. Most of the island is less than 17 meters \nabove sea level. The land is lowest in the northwest and rises very gradually towards the south \nand east. Nuku\u2019alofa is situated at the low northern shore of Tongatapu, and most of the town is \n1\u20132 meters above sea level. Large areas such as Sopu, Popua, Ngele\u2019ia, and Kolofo\u2019ou are less \nthan 1 meter above sea level. \n6.  The Tongan Archipelago is a seismically active region. Tremors with magnitudes of 3 to \n4 on the Richter scale are frequent. Major earthquakes (>7 on the Richter scale) occurred in \nTonga in 1853, 1865, 1881, 1908, 1977 and 2006. \n7.  Cyclones commonly occur between November and April, on average 1.3 times per year. \nCyclones causing serious damage occur approximately once every 10 years. \n8.  Groundwater is plentiful throughout the islands and occurs as a thick lens of freshwater \nsituated  on  a  highly  porous  limestone  substrate.  Drinking  water  is  either  pumped  from \ngroundwater or caught and stored in tanks as rainwater. Nuku\u2019alofa\u2019s municipal water supply \ncomes from the Mataki\u2019eua well field, the extraction from which is well within a sustainable level.  \n \n  2.  Ecological Resources \n9.   The Project is situated in a low-lying area of Nuku\u2019alofa that is bounded by sensitive \ncoastal  areas  comprising  the  foreshore  on  the  north  and  the  Fanga\u2019uta  Lagoon  located \nimmediately to the south. The coastal resources provide an important source of livelihood for a \nlarge number of people, primarily for subsistence, but also as a limited source of cash income. \n10.  The 27 square kilometer (km2) Fanga\u2019uta Lagoon is a major feature and an important \nfisheries habitat yielding a wide range of marine products. The lagoon is increasingly threatened \nby numerous problems arising from poorly planned urban development. These include pollution, \nhabitat destruction, and overfishing. While Fanga\u2019uta Lagoon has been declared a National \nMarine Reserve under the Parks and Reserves Act of 1976, protection measures do not appear \nto be effective.  \n \n  3.  Human and Economic Development \n \n11.  The  seven  core  subprojects  will  serve  Nuku\u2019alofa  and  its  immediate  environs.  The \nsubprojects will rehabilitate roads and improve drainage systems. Requiring rehabilitation are \nprimary and secondary roads that are now unable to cope with increased traffic volumes and \nare often badly broken and potholed. As no sidewalks are provided, pedestrians are required to \nwalk on the roads. The town has no organized drainage system. After heavy rain, stormwater \ncollects in low points and thereafter may take 2\u20133 days to drain into the ground.  \n ", "50  Appendix 11     \n12.  There is no sewerage system in Nuku\u2019alofa. Septic tanks of varying quality are used and \nthese drain to the groundwater. Groundwater quality is considered to be deteriorating from \nseptic tank effluent and as the tanks are located close to the municipal town water supply, \nFanga\u2019uta Lagoon, and the foreshores, there are concerns whether the area can maintain \nacceptable groundwater quality.  \n \n13.  While Tonga\u2019s economy can be said to be based in agriculture, also important are \nremittances from abroad. In 2003\u20132004, these compromised 48.5% of GDP.  \n \n  4.  Quality of Life Values and the Sociocultural Environment \n \n14.  The project area has a well-developed infrastructure of health and educational facilities. \nThe national hospital is located in Nuku\u2019alofa, as are private health and educational facilities. \nNuku\u2019alofa is supplied with electricity and reticulated water. Its road system is well developed. \n \nD.   Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n  1.  Design and Preconstruction Phase Considerations \n15.  During the design and preconstruction phase, attention has been given to mitigating \nconcerns  through  environmentally  sound  subproject  designs,  elements  of  which  include  (i) \nensuring subproject activities do not intrude into environmentally sensitive areas of the lagoon \nand  foreshore,  (ii)  ensuring  surface  runoff  does  not  discharge  directly  to  these  areas  by \nensuring that roads have adequate cross drainage leading to groundwater infiltration areas \nrather than using conventional piped drainage systems, (iii) including pedestrian pavements and \nturning lanes in road design to improve road safety, (iv) preparing maintenance procedures to \nensure drainage systems continue to function as planned, and (v) paying compensation for any \nloss  of  private  property.  These  conditions  are  included  in  the  attached  environmental \nmanagement and monitoring plan and will be addressed by MOW during design and contract \npreparation. \n \n2.  Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures during Construction  \n16.  Mitigation  measures  associated  with  construction  include  (i)  planning  to  avoid \nconstruction impacts in the environmentally sensitive lagoon and foreshore areas; (ii) excavating \nand removing road sub-base and incompetent channel material to approved waste material \ndump sites or, if the material is to be reused, stockpiling it securely; (iii) controlling sediment \nfrom excavated areas so sediment does not enter environmentally sensitive areas, including \npriority installation of sediment and infiltration systems to trap sediments on road construction \nsites; (iv) supervising haulage of construction materials so dust and community road safety risk \nare minimized; (v) using best industry practices in storing and handling fuel and lubricants \n(including to have a mandatory contingency plan to deal with any fuel spills); (vi) mitigating \nnoise and construction activities posing a risk to workers and local communities by timing the \nwork and providing protective safety equipment; (vii) developing a quarry management plan so \nthat quarry material is removed in an approved manner and the areas are rehabilitated, (viii) the \ncontractor\u2019s developing a community and worker safety and health plan to minimize construction \nhazards. These conditions are included in the EMP and will be addressed by the contractor. \n ", "  Appendix 11  51 \n3.  Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures during Operation \n17.  Road users\u2019 safety will be enhanced by the provision of sidewalks while improved road \ndrainage will reduce stormwater ponding on the roads.  \n18.  To  achieve  the  Project\u2019s  environmental  benefits  will  require  following  a  regular \nmaintenance schedule for cleaning the road drainage systems where sediment and debris will \nbe removed from within the stormwater retention chambers. Regular maintenance must also \ninclude grass cutting, pothole patching, and shoulder repairs. Grit and sediments from drain \nclearing activities will be disposed of at the approved Tapuhia Landfill, where it will be used as \nlandfill cover. These conditions are in the EMP, and MOW will address them during operation.  \n19.  Predicted  environmental  impacts,  mitigating  measures,  monitoring  programs,  and \ninstitutional  responsibilities  are  detailed  in  the  attached  environmental  management  and \nmonitoring plan (Table A11.2). \nE.   Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n20.  There is no environmental management unit or environment officer within the MOW. \nTherefore, institutional strengthening of MOW will be necessary and has been included in the \nProject by establishing an environment and social unit (ESU). The unit will consist of two \npersons  who  will  be  responsible  for  environmental  management,  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, as well as public relations and consultation. The ESU will be responsible to \nprepare IEEs for the subprojects, as well as to supervise the contractor\u2019s site environmental \nmanagement  plan  (SEMP)  implementation  through  regular  observation  and  spot-checking \nconstruction-related  activities.  In  short,  the  ESU  will  be  responsible  for  environmental \ncompliance requirements.  \n21.  MOW will incorporate the environmental design requirements into the project design \nspecifications. It will arrange for the EMP\u2019s construction requirements to be included into the \ncontract documents so that contractors can address these in their bids. During construction, the \nPMU site engineer will ensure that conditions contained in the EMP are observed. This engineer \nwill be assisted by ESU staff in supervising and approving the completion of EMP requirements.  \n22.  The Land Management Division of the Ministry of Lands, Survey and Natural Resources \n(MLSNR) will help coordinate compensation for loss of private property and implement the \nrequirements of the Short Resettlement Plan. The MLSNR will ensure that all compensation is \ncompleted before construction commences. \n23.  The following reports will be prepared. The contractor will prepare a monthly EMP \ncompliance report that will be submitted to the PMU. The PMU will evaluate the contractor\u2019s \nEMP report. A section concerning compliance with the EMP will be prepared and included as a \npart of the quarterly project report to ADB. A copy of this report will also be sent to Department \nof Environment. \nF.   Public Consultation and Disclosure \n \n24.  Extensive public consultation has been undertaken by the IUDSP, which has established \na highly participatory approach of working with local counterparts within the Government, private \nsector,  nongovernmental  organizations,  the  church,  women\u2019s  and  youth  groups,  and  the \nbroader community. As a result, there is overall strong public support for and agreement about \n ", "52  Appendix 11     \nthe Project. The IEE report will be made available at the Department of Environment and IUDSP \noffices in Nuku\u2019alofa and uploaded onto ADB\u2019s website. \n \nG.   Environmental Assessment Review Procedure \n  1.  Selection Criteria of Subprojects \n25.  All of the subprojects will be subject to a first level of screening in accordance with the \nKingdom of Tonga\u2019s environmental laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s environmental assessment \nguidelines. Accordingly, subprojects will not be selected if the following are found: \n(i)   significant impact on ecologically sensitive areas of the Fanga\u2019uta Lagoon National \nMarine Reserve arising from their design, location, construction, or operation;  \n(ii)   significant  impacts  on  coral  reefs  and  natural  vegetation  as  specified  in  the \nSchedule of Environmental Impact Assessment Act, 2003;  \n(iii)   a permanent negative effect on a known rare or endangered species; and  \n(iv)   permanent damage to irreplaceable cultural relics and archaeological sites. \n \n2.  Review  Procedure  for  Environmental  Assessment  of  Subprojects  and \nResponsibilities of the Ministry of Works and ADB \n26.   To ensure that the remaining subprojects will be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental  assessment  procedures2  and  the  Government\u2019s  Environmental  Impact \nAssessment Act, 2003, responsibilities of the concerned authorities will be as follow: \na.  Ministry of Works Responsibilities \n27.  Ministry of Works (through the ESU) will be responsible for \n(i)  preparing IEEs, including the requirement to undertake public consultations and \npublic disclosure of the IEE; \n(ii)  obtaining IEE clearance from the MLSNR; \n(iii)  submitting to ADB the IEEs for subprojects, as well as the IEEs\u2019 clearance for \nADB\u2019s consideration in approving the subprojects; \n(iv)  incorporating mitigation measures during preconstruction and construction phases \n(which will be done by the design engineer within the PMU); \n(v)  ensuring that the EMP\u2019s construction stage mitigation measures are included in the \nbidding document for costing by the contractor and that IEE clearances will be \nobtained before commencing any civil  works for a subproject; \n(vi)  ensuring that contractors have completed the detailed EMP for approval; \n(vii)  monitoring EMP implementation; and \n(viii)  submitting quarterly reports on implementing EMPs to MLSNR and ADB. \n b.  ADB Responsibilities \n \n28.  ADB is responsible for: \n(i)  reviewing IEE and summary IEE reports and disclosing these on ADB\u2019s website, \n(ii)  reviewing all statutory environmental clearance granted by the Government\u2019s \nenvironmental authority and noting all conditions in approving the subprojects,  \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 11  53 \n(iii)  reviewing the quarterly report on implementing the EMP and taking actions (as \nnecessary) in close coordination with the Ministry of Works, and \n(iv)  monitoring  implementation  of  the  EMP  and  due  diligence  as  part  of  overall \nproject review missions. \n \n3.  Environmental  Due  Diligence  to  Ensure  Compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy \n29.  MOW  will  ensure  that  ADB  will  be  given  access  to  undertake  environmental  due \ndiligence  for  all  subprojects,  if  necessary.  MOW  has  primary  responsibility,  however,  for \nenvironmental due diligence and for monitoring implementation of subprojects\u2019 environmental \nmitigation  measures.  The  due  diligence  report  and  monitoring  report  for  the  EMP \nimplementation need to be systematically documented. \n  4.  Public Disclosure \n30.  In  the  context  of  disclosing  environmental  documentation  to  the  public,  MOW  will \nundertake the following: \n(i)  public consultations, and particularly with affected people, during preparation of \nIEEs for the remaining subprojects;  \n(ii)  public disclosure of all environmental documents, whereby IEE reports will be \nmade available at the Department of Environment and IUDSP offices in Nuku\u2019alofa; \nand \n(iii)  properly keeping all environmental documents, including the environmental due \ndiligence and monitoring reports for each subproject, as part of the Ministry of \nWorks records. \n \nH.   Findings and Recommendations \n \n31.  Based on discussions, review of documents, and field assessment of the Project, it is \nconcluded that by rehabilitating and improving the surrounding urban infrastructure the Project \nwill assist in maintaining the environmental quality of the Nuku\u2019alofa foreshore areas and the \nFanga\u2019uta Lagoon, and it will maintain the water quality of the groundwater resources of the \narea. The Project has strong community support in Nuku\u2019alofa. The Project complies with ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental safeguard policies and no irreversible or significant cumulative impacts have \nbeen identified. Thus, a more detailed environmental impact assessment is not warranted and \nthe summary IEE will be the final environmental assessment for the Project. By adopting the \nenvironmental mitigation and monitoring measures outlined in the environmental management \nand monitoring plan, the Project will not cause environmental concerns.  \nI.   Conclusions \n32.  The Project is classified as category B. The initial environmental screening process and \nanalysis of potential environmental impacts concluded that the Project will not result in any \ndirect or indirect significant adverse environmental impacts and will not require further study. All \nimpacts can be satisfactorily mitigated and an EMP has been prepared that contains practical \nmitigation measures. A full environmental impact assessment is not warranted. \n33.  An  environmental  assessment  review  framework  has  been  prepared  that  will  guide \nimplementation of the subsequent subprojects under the sector project. \n ", "       \n \nTable A11.2:  Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan  5\n4\n \n  Impact Mitigation  Impact Monitoring \nPotential  Frequency  Monitoring \nProject  Implementing  Mitigation  Parameter to  Monitoring  A\nEnvironmental  Proposed Mitigation Measure  and Means of  Responsi- p\nActivity  Responsibility  Cost  be Monitored  Cost  pe\nImpact  Verification  bility  n\nd\nA.
