Industry,  mainly  led  by \nresources,  recorded  the  highest  growth  rate  in  2012,  at  13.8%,  as  foreign  investment  in \nhydropower  and  mining  proved  to  be  key  engines  of  growth.  Services  grew  at  8.0%  while \nagriculture\u2019s contribution to annual real growth was the lowest at 2.5%,5 which is consistent with \nthe  steady  decline  of  agriculture\u2019s  share of GDP, from  61.2%  in 1990  to  30.3%  by  2010. This \npattern  of  structural  change  can  be  expected  as  an  economy  grows  and  develops;  resources \nmove  from  low-productivity  activities  in  subsistence  agriculture  and  traditional  services  to \nhigher-productivity activities in industry and modern services.6  As a result of this steady growth, \nthe  proportion  of  the  population  living  below  the  poverty  line  dropped  from  33.9%  in  2008  to \n27.6% in 2012.   \n \n4. \nThe  boom  in  resources  has  transformed  the  economy  over  the  past  20  years  and  will \ncontinue to do so in the immediate future. The extent of the transformation and how it will affect \nthe  country\u2019s  economy  will  depend  on  (i)  the  magnitude,  duration,  and  cyclical  pattern  of  the \nmineral resources boom; (ii) the extent to which the resource revenue flows appreciate the real \nkip  exchange  rate  and  how  that  exchange  rate  appreciation  transmits  to  the  tradable  goods \nsector; and (iii) what kind of policies the government implements to promote competitiveness in \nthe non-resource sectors, especially the SME subsector.  \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Program Cluster, \nand Loan and Grant for Subprogram 1, to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Second Private Sector and \nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Program. Manila. \n\n3  SMEs in the Lao PDR are defined as enterprises with an annual average number of employees not exceeding 99 \n\nor total assets not exceeding KN1,200,000,000 or an annual turnover not exceeding KN1,000,000,000. \n\n4  GDP growth was 7.5% in 2010, 7.8% in 2011, and 7.9% in 2012 based on ADB. 2013. Asian Development Bank & \n\nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic Fact Sheet. Manila. \n\n5  ADB. 2013. Basic 2013 Statistics. Manila.  \n6  K. Bird and S. Ismail. 2013. Lao PDR Assessment, Strategy and Road Map, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises. \n\nManila: ADB.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nStrengthening  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises. According to government data, \n5. \n99% of economic enterprises in the Lao PDR are SMEs. Strengthening the competitiveness of \nSMEs is important for two main reasons\u2014the transitory nature of the resources boom and the \ncountry's  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  in  February  2013.  While  the \nresources  sector  contributes  significantly  to  exports  and  fiscal  revenue,  this  is  expected  to \ndecline in the medium term. Non-resource sectors will thus need to expand their contribution to \nbe able to play a pivotal role in employment generation and in making the economic growth of \nthe  country  both  sustainable  and  inclusive.  Second,  while  WTO  membership  is  a  substantial \nachievement  that  will  help  integrate  the  Lao  PDR  further  into  the  world  economy,  such  trade \nexposure  can  affect  industries  differently;  some  will  expand  due  to  new  opportunities  while \nothers  will  have  to  undergo  substantial  restructuring  to  survive  and  prosper.  Hence,  assisting \nstructural  adjustment  so  that  SMEs  can  benefit  from  the  new  opportunities  is  essential.  In \naddition, SMEs also face constraints such as inefficient regulations, poor access to services and \nfinance, non-transparent trade policies which results in low utilization of tariff preferences.  \n \n6. \nThe  government  recognizes  the  importance  of  developing  SMEs\u2014two  of  the  main \ntargets  of  enterprise  development  in  the  NSEDP7  are:  (i)  to  have  13%  annual  growth  in  the \nSME  subsector;  and  (ii)  to  have  85%  of  workers  in  business  overall  engaged  by  SMEs.7 The \nNSEDP7  is  further  supported  by  the  national  SME  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015.  ADB\u2019s \ncountry  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016  is  also  consistent  with  government  priorities.  Private \nsector  development  is  one  of  the  thematic  areas  of  the  strategy,  which  states  that  ADB  will \ncontinue  to  promote  a  stronger  enabling  environment  for  the  private  sector.  Improving  the \nbusiness  environment  for  SMEs  will  naturally  result  in  expansion  of  the  SME  subsector  within \nthe formal sector, and ultimately a more competitive and efficient private sector. \n \n7. \nADB\u2019s support. ADB has extensive experience in SME and private sector development \nin the Lao PDR. The first Private Sector and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development \nProgram was implemented from 2006 to 2009.8  In that program, the government implemented \nreforms  aimed  at  reducing  the  cost  of  doing  business  in the  Lao  PDR,  including  enactment  of \nthe Law on Enterprises and establishment of enterprise registry offices; starting the process for \nregulatory  reform;  and  advancing  trade  policy  reforms.  ADB\u2019s  completion  report  rated  the  first \nprogram as successful overall.9 The country assistance performance evaluation prepared by the \nIndependent  Evaluation  Department  concluded  that  ADB\u2019s  programs  in  the  SME  subsector \nwere highly relevant, highly efficient, effective in achieving intended outcomes, and likely to be \nsustainable. 10  This  provided  strong  rationale  for  ADB\u2019s  continued  involvement  through  the \nPSME2.  ADB  also  works  closely  with  other  development  partners  in  developing  the  sector  by \ncoordinating through the trade and private sector working group.11 \n \n8. \nAchievements  of  subprogram  1.  Under  subprogram  1  of  the  PSME2,  which  ADB \nfinanced in 2011 ($15 million), the government carried out reforms through: (i) implementation of \n\n                                                \n7  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR.  2011.

Some tangible achievements include: \n(i) national rollout of a fully web-based enterprise registry system in the provinces, development \nof  a  web-based  Credit  Information  Bureau  (CIB-online),  (ii)  establishment  of  the  regulatory \nimpact  assessment  (RIA)  pilot  unit  in  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Commerce  (MOIC);  and \n(iii) focus  on  trade  policy  measures  that  directly  benefit  SMEs,  including  preparation  of  a \ngeographical indication strategy and passing of decrees on rules of origin and import and export \nof goods consistent with WTO requirements.  \n \n9. \nLessons. Notwithstanding the achievements above, lessons from subprogram 1 include \nthe  need  for  additional  capacity  building  to  mainstream  reforms  and  make  them  sustainable, \nand  a  more  direct  and  comprehensive  approach  to  gender  mainstreaming  to  promote  women \nentrepreneurs.  First,  in  subprogram  1,  capacity  building  and  implementation  support  were \nprovided  through  TA  and  the  government\u2019s  budget  allocation.  While  this  was  sufficient  to \ncomplete  the  reforms  for  subprogram  2,  institutionalizing  them  and  making  them  sustainable \nrequires more  resources.  Second,  policy  measures  that  promoted  women  entrepreneurs  were \nlimited  to  only  the  first  output  (implementation  of  SME  policy  and  access  to  services).  These \nlessons have been incorporated in the design of subprogram 2. In addition to the government\u2019s \nbudget allocation, subprogram 2 includes a TA loan with more resources for capacity building to \nhelp make the reforms sustainable. This reflects government's commitment to the sector and to \nmeet all performance targets in the DMF including those with slow progress. Subprogram 2 also \nincludes policy measures to promote women entrepreneurs that cover all outputs.  \n \n10. \nSubprogram 2. The proposed modality combines a policy-based loan designed to build \non  government  reforms  under  subprogram  1,  and  a  TA  loan  to  build  capacities  and  make  the \ncompleted reforms sustainable. The implementation period for the policy-based loan is October \n2011\u2013September  2013  and  the  implementation  period  for  the  TA  is  January  2014\u2013December \n2017. A post-program partnership framework (P3F) has also been agreed with the government, \nwhich  provides  an  opportunity  for  ADB  to  continue  working  with  the  government  in  SME \ndevelopment to achieve the medium-term direction and expected results. The policy actions in \nthe policy matrix cover both supply- and demand-side reforms. On the supply side, subprogram \n2  reforms  inefficient  regulations that  hinder  SME  growth  and  competitiveness  through  the  RIA \nsystem introduced by ADB. On the demand side, subprogram 2 focuses on improving access to \nservices and finance, and dissemination of trade-related information to help SMEs benefit from \ntrade  policies.  Subprogram  2  will  be  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020  focus  on  gender \nempowerment  and  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  by  including  gender-\nresponsive measures in the policy matrix and using gender-related indicators in the DMF.  \n \nB. \n \nThe impact of the program will be expansion of SMEs in the formal sector by 100% from \n11. \nthe 2009 baseline. This is important, as registration allows SMEs to get access to services such \nas bank loans. In 2009, about 45,000 enterprises were registered and by the end of 2012, this \nnumber had increased to 91,077. The performance target for this impact has thus been reached \n3 years  ahead  of  the  timeline  set  in  the  DMF.  The  outcome  of  the  program  will  be  a  more \nconducive  business  environment  for  SMEs  based  on  two  indicators  in  the  DMF.  The  updated \nDMF (Appendix 1) contains an additional column with figures for 2012.  \n \n \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n\f4 \n\nOutputs  \n\nC. \n \n12. \nSubprogram  2  continues  to  support  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  develop  the  private \nsector  and  SMEs  through:  (i)  implementation  of  an  SME  policy  that  widens  SMEs\u2019  access  to \nservices;  (ii)  improvement  of  regulatory  efficiency;  and  (iii)  strengthening  of  the  trade  policy  to \nsupport SME development. When subprogram 1 was approved in 2011, eight triggers were set \nfor subprogram 2. An additional trigger was added in 2012. The nine triggers are reinforced by \n10 other accomplishments that are considered policy measures.  \n \n13. \nOut of the original  eight triggers, three exceeded expectations, four were completed as \nanticipated, and one was refined to reflect practical realities and the government\u2019s priorities. The \ntrigger  related  to  setting  up  a  pilot  online  enterprise  registry  in  one  province  was  refined \nbecause  internet  infrastructure  in  the  provinces  is  not  sufficiently  developed  to  support  online \nregistration.  Instead,  the  government  has  decided  to  decentralize  enterprise  registration  by \nsetting  up  registry  offices  in  51  districts,  which  will  achieve  the  same  objective  as  online \nregistration. Realization of an online registry will take more time and, as a first step, ADB helped \nthe  government  develop  an  appropriate  strategy.  The  strategy  looked  at  ways  to  overcome \ninadequate internet access in some provinces and develop an online payment system.12 \n \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Implementation of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Policy that \nWidens Access to Services \n\n \n14. \nCoordination  of  policy  development.  SME  development,  which  cuts  across  several \nline  ministries,  requires  an  anchor  document  as  a  reference  point  to  formulate  strategies  and \nplan  activities.  The  SME  Development  Plan  2011\u20132015  defines  targets  and  measures  and  is \nincorporated in the government-approved NSEDP7. Key features of the plan include promoting \nwomen entrepreneurs and RIA to improve the business environment for SMEs. Approval of the \nplan as part of the NSEDP7, rather than as a standalone document, reinforces coordination of \nSME development with the government\u2019s overall priorities. In addition, the SME monitoring unit \ncontinues to  publish updates  on the  implementation  of  the  SME  Development  Plan  and,  as  of \n2013, all activities are on track.  \n \nTo  further  strengthen  SMEs,  government  also  enacted  the  SME  Law.  It  upgraded  the \n15. \nSmall  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprise  Promotion  and  Development  Office  to  a  department  of \nMOIC  with  enhanced  responsibilities  such  as  promoting  and  supporting  the  development  of \nwomen  entrepreneurs.  Effective  policymaking  should  always  include  engagement  with  the \nprivate  sector.  The  government  continues  to  do  so  through  the  Provincial  Public\u2013Private \nDialogue  (P3D)  Forum.  The  P3D  in  Luang  Prabang  was  institutionalized  and  the  Ministry  of \nPlanning  and Investment  initiated  phase  3  of  the  P3D  in  expanding  it  into  Xiengkhouang. The \nP3D is coordinated through the Lao National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  \n \n16.  Wider  access  to  business  services  and  finance.  SMEs\u2019  access  to  services  and \nfinance  is  predicated  on  registration.  The  government  has  made  great  strides  in  simplifying \nenterprise  registration.  By  2011,  70,000  enterprises  had  registered,  compared  with  about \n35,000 in 2008. During implementation of subprogram 2, and by the end of 2012, the number of \nenterprises  registered  exceeded  91,000.  Decentralizing  registration  offices  into  the  provinces \nhas  also  had  a  positive  impact  on  women  entrepreneurs\u2014more  than  50%  of  registered \nindividual enterprises are owned by women. Despite this success, government is committed to \n\n                                                \n12 Policy  matrix  (Appendix  4);  Assessment  of  Original  Triggers  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n\f5 \n\nfurther  progress.  The  Department  of  Enterprise  Registration  and  Management,  with  ADB \nsupport, undertook a thorough review of the registration system and based on the findings will \nconsider recommendations for: (i) decentralizing registry offices into districts; (ii) ensuring their \nfinancial sustainability; and (iii) reaching out to women entrepreneurs.  \n \n17. \nAccess to finance remains a problem. The GIZ Enterprise Survey of 2011 reported that \n26.6% of enterprises cited lack of capital as a \u201cvery big\u201d problem. When broken down by size, \n57% of micro businesses and 45% of small businesses said that lack of capital is a significant \nconstraint. 13 In  response,  the  government:  (i)  developed  and  launched  a  web-based  credit \ninformation  system  (CIB-online);  and  (ii)  approved  the  implementing  decree  for  the  Secured \nTransaction  Law.  Under  subprogram  2,  CIB-online  has  been  made fully  operational.  All  banks \nare required to provide credit information of customers to the online system and all queries for \ncredit information now occur through the online system. As of March 2013, CIB-online received \nan average of over 3,000 queries per month. Further, all new loans above KN50 million require \ncredit  reports.  The  government  also  made  progress  in  the  secured  transaction  registry.  The \nMinistry of Finance agreed to host the registry and assigned a team to implement it. Apart from \nwidening  access  to  finance,  the  government  also  recognizes  the  need  for  SMEs  to  access \nbusiness  development  services,  and  for  these  services  to  be  led  by  the  private  sector  for  the \nprivate  sector.  According  to  the  GIZ  survey,  only  7.9%  of  enterprises  surveyed  received \nbusiness  development  services  from  the  private  sector.  In  subprogram  2,  the  Department  of \nSME Promotion launched the network of service providers that had been piloted in subprogram \n1. It has been expanded to cover services like accounting, marketing, and business advice. The \nnetwork also facilitates vocational training for women entrepreneurs.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Promoting Regulatory Efficiency \n\n \n18. \nOne of the most effective ways to enhance the competitiveness of SMEs is to promote \nregulatory  efficiency  so that  regulations  do  not  unnecessarily  burden SMEs.14 The  objective of \nthe  RIA  process  introduced  by  ADB  in  2010  is  to  provide  decision  makers  in  the  government \nwith  information  on  the  impact  of  regulations  on  the  private  sector.  During  subprogram  2, \ngovernment  accomplishments  in mainstreaming  the  RIA  system  have  exceeded  initial  targets. \nMost  importantly,  the  government  has  passed  the  Law  on  Making  Legislation,  which  makes \nimpact assessment mandatory for all lawmaking authorities. This is critical as it embeds the RIA \nprocess  into  national  legislation.  The  government  also  realizes  that  to  implement  this  law \neffectively,  capacities  have  to  be  built  in  line  ministries.  The  pilot  unit  in  MOIC  has  led  by \nexample  and  begun  implementing  its  RIA  work  plan  for  capacity  building  by  completing  two \npreliminary  impact  assessments  on  rice  and  timber  exports.  MOIC  has  published  both  impact \nassessments  to  solicit  feedback  from  the  private  sector  before  they  are  finalized.  The \ngovernment, with the support of ADB, has set up additional RIA units in the ministries of finance, \njustice,  and  planning  and  investment.  A  unit  was  also  set  up  in  the  National  Assembly,  which \nneeds  to  understand  the  process  since  it  will  deliberate  on  legislation  that  includes  impact \nassessments prepared by line ministries.   \n \n19.  With  impact  assessments  being  made  mandatory  and  now  covering  several  line \nministries, it is important that the  RIA interministerial task force (set up under subprogram 1 to \ncoordinate  RIA  implementation)  is  strengthened.  During  subprogram  2, government  has taken \nconcrete steps by appointing representatives from all RIA units, including representatives from \n\n                                                \n13 GIZ. 2012. Enterprise Survey 2011. Vientiane.  \n14 ADB\u2019s Red Tape Study estimates that firms on average incur $483 annually to comply with the three most common \nlicenses. Overall, it costs the business community (those complying) $36 million to comply with the three licenses. \n\n\f6 \n\nthe  Lao  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  the  National  Assembly,  to  be  part  of  the  task  force,  and \nappointing  a  secretariat  to  serve  the  task  force.  Such  a  mechanism  will  allow  more  effective \ndeliberation  and  sharing  of  information  and  experience  between  the  RIA  units.  Another \nsignificant  achievement  in  promoting  regulatory  efficiency  is  that  the  government  has \nimplemented the prime ministerial decree on the Investment Promotion Law by setting up a one-\nstop service center in the Ministry of Planning and Investment that is now fully operational. That \nthe  RIA  unit  in  this  ministry  has  begun  evaluating  the  one-stop  service  center  is  further \ndemonstration of the government\u2019s ownership of the RIA process.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput  3:  Strengthening  the  Trade  Policy  to  Support  Small  and  Medium-\nSized Enterprise Development \n\nimplementing  regulations  on  geographical \n\n \nGrowth  from  trade.  Research,  including  that  published  by  ADB,  shows  that  the \n20. \nutilization rates for tariff preferences among SMEs are very low.15 One key reason is SMEs\u2019 lack \nof information on ways to benefit from preferential trade agreements.  In view of the Lao PDR\u2019s \naccession  to  the  WTO  in  February  2013,  information  dissemination  becomes  more  critical  so \nthat SMEs can compete within the country\u2019s more open economy. To respond to the needs of \nthe SMEs, government has undertaken two important reforms under subprogram 2. First, MOIC \n(through  its  Foreign  Trade  and  Policy  Department)  drafted  trade  integration  dissemination \nguidelines  to  inform  SMEs  on  ways  to  utilize  preferences.  The  guidelines  include  outreach \nthe \nactivities  for  the  business  community,  particularly  women  entrepreneurs.  Second, \ngovernment  (through  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology)  issued  the  Intellectual  Property \nLaw  and \nindications  consistent  with  WTO \nprocedures, which set the stage for SMEs to register their products locally via the geographical \nindication  registration framework.  In most  cases,  these  registrations  have  resulted  in  premium \npricing in international markets, which benefits SMEs along the whole value chain.  \n \n21. \nGreater  transparency.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  took  three  steps  toward \ngreater  transparency  in  its  trade  policy.  First,  MOIC  operationalized  the  Sanitary  and \nPhytosanitary and Technical Barriers to Trade Notification Unit and published notification on its \nwebsite.  This  is  consistent  with WTO  requirements for  transparency  in trade  policies.  Second, \nMOIC  developed  and  implemented  the  Lao  PDR  Trade  Portal,  which  provides  web-based \ninformation  systems  to  assist  SMEs  on  trade-related  regulations.  The  government,  with  ADB \nsupport,  developed  a  database for the  notification  units  which are  included  in the trade  portal. \nThird,  the  government  institutionalized  an  information-sharing  mechanism  between  ministries \nand agencies on trade-related measures. This improves transparency and should enable all line \nministries to provide consistent information to SMEs. \n \n22. \nPost-program  partnership  framework.  Subprogram  2  is  followed  by  the  P3F,  which \nillustrates  the  government's  recognition  of  its  partnership  with  ADB  and  allows  both  parties  to \ncontinue working together in this important area. Most of the actions specified in the P3F will be \nsupported  through  the  TA  loan.  The  medium-term  direction  and  its  expected  results  offer  a \nreference point for targets that can be met through a results-based approach.  \n \nD. \n \n23. \nTo  support  its  reform  initiatives,  the  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $15  million \nequivalent  to  help  finance  subprogram  2  of  the  PSME2.  The  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n                                                \n15 M.

The closing date of the loan is 31 March 2014, by which date all proceeds \nof the loan will have been fully disbursed. Having satisfied all subprogram triggers, the loan will \nbe withdrawn in a single tranche upon loan effectiveness. The proceeds of the loan will finance \neconomy-wide  imports from  ADB  member  countries  on  the  basis  of the negative list16 and  will \nbe  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB's  policy  on  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.17   \n \nThe size of the loan is based on consideration of a number of factors required to support \n24. \nimplementation  of  program  reforms.  The  key  considerations  are:  (i)  the  relative  importance  of \nthe sector to the economy, the weight and benefits of the reform program; (ii) the policy costs \nincurred  by  the  government  and  stakeholders  in  implementing  reforms;  and  (iii)  the  need  to \nconform  to  the  overall  financing  requirement  from  the  country  partnership  strategy  period. \nSubprogram  2  loan  proceeds  will  support  key  development  spending  in 2013,  including  about \n$1.5  million  to  institutionalize  RIA;  $0.3  million  for  decentralizing  enterprise  registration  via \ndistrict  offices;  and  other  administrative,  investment,  and  fiscal  costs  to  the  government  in \nimplementing  reforms.  Paras.  28  and  29  summarize  expected  costs  and  benefits,  and  the \nprogram impact assessment provides details.18  \n \nE. \n \n25.  MOIC  will  be  the  executing  agency,  which  is  responsible  for  overall  implementation \nthrough  the  program  coordination  team.  The  team  is  chaired  by  the  director  general  of  the \nDepartment  of  SME  Promotion  and  will  include  the  Foreign  Trade  Policy  Department;  the \ndepartments  of  import  and  export,  and  enterprise  registration  and  management  at  MOIC;  and \nthe  ministries  of  justice,  planning  and  investment,  and  science  and  technology,  who  are \nimplementing  agencies  for  the  program.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  responsible  for \ndisbursement. The implementation period is October 2011\u2013September 2013.  \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN \n\n26. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  TA  loan  of  $4.378  million  equivalent.  The  TA  serves \nthree purposes: (i) to mainstream the reforms completed in subprogram 2, including by setting \nup institutions to make these reforms sustainable; (ii) to provide capacity building support to the \ngovernment  beyond  2013;  and  (iii)  to  help  the  government  accomplish  the  P3F  actions.  The \nloan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  TA  loan  agreement.  The  TA  will  have  five  outputs  (i) \nenhanced  enterprise  registry;  (ii)  RIA  institutionalized;  (iii)  geographical  indication  system \nestablished; (iv) SME e-commerce and export development project established and (v) project \nmanagement  unit  established.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $4.628  million.  ADB  will  finance \n$4.378  million  equivalent  from  ADB's  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund), \nincluding applicable taxes, duties, and bank charges. The government will provide $0.25 million \nequivalent through in-kind contributions (counterpart staff and various facilities) and financing of \ninterest  during  implementation.  The  project  administration  manual  outlines  the  proposed \nactivities  under  the  TA,  and  will  be  further  refined  before  implementation.19 The  TA  financing \nplan and investment plan are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. \n                                                \n16 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB. 1998.

The consulting firms will be selected through the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod, with a 90:10 ratio in the case of component 3 (due to its technical requirements) and an \n80:20 ratio for the other two components. At the request and on behalf of the government, ADB \nwill  assist  in  the  selection  of  consultants  while  MOIC  will  sign  and  administer  their  contracts \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nThe  loan  proceeds  for  financing  activities  under  the  TA  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2012,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).

The estimated benefits exceed the loan amount.  The policy costs \nto the government are conservatively estimated as a discounted present value lump sum of $9.3 \nmillion. These costs include the administrative, investment, and fiscal costs to the government in \nimplementing  the  reforms\u2014e.g.,  activities  under  the  SME  Development  Plan;  the  investment \ncost to set up the one-stop service center, to make CIB-online fully operational, and to launch \nthe network of service providers; and the investment costs to set up RIA units  \n \n29. \nADB estimates the direct benefits of the reform program over the program period (2009\u2013\n2015) at approximately 0.3% of GDP, or a discounted present value lump sum of approximately \n$27  million.  These  economic  benefits  include  the  gains  to  the  economy  from  a  reduction  in \nbusiness costs through RIA, efficiency gains for the private sector through the one-stop service \ncenter,  potential  growth  and  development  of  SMEs  through  better  access  to  finance,  and  a \npremium to SMEs involved in export of geographical indication products.  \n \nB. \n \n30. \nThe government  is committed  to  strengthening  its  public financial  management  system \nthrough the Public Financial Management Strengthening Program. A new procurement decree, \nimplementing  rules  and  regulations,  a  standard  procurement  manual,  and  standard  bidding \ndocuments have improved procurement practice. The government has taken credible measures \nto strengthen key oversight agencies such as the State Audit Organization, and has adopted the \nLaw on Anti-Corruption, Law on State Inspection, Law on Complaints and State Audit, and Law \non State Accounting. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand discussed with the government. \n \nC. \n \n31. \nReforms under subprogram 2 are expected to lower the incidence of poverty through two \nchannels\u2014(i) accelerating, broad-based, and sustainable growth, and (ii) lower prices for goods \nand  services.20 Reducing  business  compliance  costs  will  increase  the  number  of  SMEs  in  the \nformal sector, thereby supporting inclusive economic growth. By improving transparency in  the \ntrade  policy  and  supporting  integration  in  the  region  and  the  rest  of  the  world,  economic \nefficiency will increase and domestic prices will fall. The PSME2 will have a positive impact on \nachieving  the  goal  of  gender  equality  through  the  SME  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  the \napproved SME Law, the network of service providers, and the regulatory review process. \n                                                \n20 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n\f10 \n\nSafeguards \n\nRisk and Mitigating Measures \n\nD. \n \n32. \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified \ncategory C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.21 \n \nE. \n \n33. \nThe  risk  for  subprogram  2  is  assessed  as  medium  to  high.  Major  risks  include \nprocurement,  corruption and threat  to  economic growth.  Mitigation measures  to  address these \nrisks  include  support  through  ADB\u2019s  public  financial  management  strengthening  program  and \nimplementation of legislations such as Law on State Inspection and Law on State Accounting. \nThese  laws  seek  to  strengthen  public  financial  management  practices,  and  minimize \ndiscretionary exercise of power. The risk and mitigating measures are described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.22 \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n34. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 2 of the PSME2 \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed  in  detail  in  the  project  administration  manual  and  the  loan  agreements.  The \ngovernment has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for subprogram 2, which are set forth in \nthe loan agreements. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n35. \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  policy-based  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR9,890,000  to  the \nLao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  subprogram  2  of  the  Second  Private \nSector  and  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises  Development  Program,  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 24 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and  \nthe  technical  assistance  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR2,887,000 \nto the Lao People\u2018s Democratic Republic for subprogram 2 of the Second Private \nSector  and  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises  Development  Program,  from \nADB\u2018s Special Funds resources, with an  interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 \nyears including a grace period of 8 years,  \n\nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement and technical assistance loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n\n9 September 2013 \n                                                \n21 Ibid., p9. \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n\n\fDesign \nSummary \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n\nImpact \nExpansion of \nSMEs in the \nformal sector \n\nOutcome \nMore \nconducive \nbusiness \nenvironment \nfor SMEs \n\nOutputs \n1.
