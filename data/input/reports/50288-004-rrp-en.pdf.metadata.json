The  proposed  additional financing, together \nwith the ongoing project, will support project preparation and improve the infrastructure project \nmanagement capacity of the implementing agencies, including the Department of Transportation \n(DOTr) and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). The project will build on the \nongoing project to (i) improve the quality of priority infrastructure project proposals for approval \nby  the  Investment  Coordination  Committee  (ICC)  of  the  National  Economic  and  Development \nAuthority  (NEDA);  (ii)  accelerate  early  project  implementation  following  ICC  approval  through \ndetailed  engineering  design  (DED)  and  tendering  support,  with  a  focus  on  complex  and  large \nprojects  requiring  international  expertise;  and  (iii) strengthen  the  government\u2019s  capacity  to \nimplement projects under the implementing agencies. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n \n\nRationale \n\n \n\nInadequate  or  underdeveloped  infrastructure  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the  key \nconstraints  on  the  Philippines\u2019  growth.  The  2018  Global  Competitiveness  Report  by  the  World \nEconomic Forum ranked the Philippines 56th out of 140 countries, advancing it by 29 places since \n2010, mainly based on improvements in the macroeconomic environment.2 However, the country \nranked low on infrastructure (92nd), below other Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia \n(71st),  Thailand  (60th),  and  Malaysia  (32nd).  Among  the  direct  impacts  of  inadequate \ninfrastructure  are  the  high  costs  of  doing  business,  which  undermine  business  potential  and \neconomic opportunities, especially in rapidly growing urban areas. \n \n\n \n\nThe government has been increasing public infrastructure investments under the \u201cBuild, \nBuild, Build\u201d Program to raise the Philippines\u2019 long-term growth potential. In 2016, the government \nannounced a ten-point action plan that targets public spending on infrastructure reaching 7.0% of \ngross  domestic  product  by  2022  from  3.4%  in  2016.  The  government  has  already  achieved \nsubstantial progress on this agenda. In 2018, public spending on infrastructure rose to 5.1% of \ngross  domestic  product.  The  difference  between  the  current  level  of  investment  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s  target  indicates  that  efforts  to  accelerate  infrastructure  investments  should  be \nsustained in the coming years. \n \n\n \n\nADB approved financing for the facility on 27 October 2017 to offer a short- to medium-\nterm solution to the near-term needs of the DPWH and DOTr to boost their capacity for preparing \npublic infrastructure investments. The facility has four components: (i) output 1: road and bridge \nprojects prepared; (ii) output 2: water projects prepared; (iii) output 3: rail, public transport, port, \nand airport projects prepared; and (iv) output 4: project management capacity of the government \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Technical Assistance \n\nLoan to the Republic of the Philippines for the Infrastructure Preparation and Innovation Facility.

The project supports preparation of infrastructure projects to be financed by ADB and \nother funding sources. \n \n\n \n\nThe  ongoing  project\u2019s  early  implementation  has  been  effective.  On  behalf  of  the \ngovernment, three framework consultants had been recruited under advance contracting, which \nenabled the DOTr and DPWH to sign the contracts within  2 months after loan effectiveness in \nFebruary 2018. Shortly after their mobilization, the consulting firms conducted an initial project \nstrategic  review,  which  helped  the  DOTr  and  DPWH  identify  priority  projects  and  project \npreparation steps. As a result of the prioritization, the government has decided to focus support \nunder the facility on large and complex projects, which benefit most from access to international \nexpertise.  Table  1  shows  the  major  projects  that  the  facility  is  supporting.  These  projects  are \nexpected to be financed by ADB and other financing sources. \n \n\nTable 1: Support Provided under the Ongoing Project \n\nName of Project \n\nBataan\u2013Cavite Interlink Bridge Project \nLaguna Lakeshore Road Network Project \nSamal Island Davao Bridge Project \nNorth Eastern Luzon Expressway Project \nSorsogon Samar link project \nBohol Leyte Bridges Project \nMetro Manila Bridges Project \nFlood Risk Management Investment \nProject for Six Major River Basins \nEDSA Greenway Project \n\nMindanao Rail Project \n\nMetro Manila Subway Project \nNorth South Commuter Rail and South \nLong-Haul Project \nNew Cebu International Container Port \nProject \nMindanao Central Airport Project \nSubic Clark Railway Project \n\nImplementing \nAgency \nDPWH \nDPWH \nDPWH \nDPWH \nDPWH \nDPWH \nDPWH \nDPWH \n\nDOTr \n\nDOTr \n\nDOTr \nDOTr \n\nDOTr \n\nDOTr \nDOTr \n\nType of Support \n\nFeasibility study \nMaster planning and feasibility study \nFeasibility study and DED \nFeasibility study \nPrefeasibility study \nPrefeasibility study \nDED \nMaster planning, feasibility study, \nDED, and tender support \nFeasibility study, DED, and tender \nsupport \nTender support, technical review, and \nadditional surveys and investigations \nTender support and technical review \nTender support and technical review \n\nTechnical review and safeguard \nimpact study \nStrategy development \nReview of feasibility study \n\nDED = detailed engineering design, DOTr = Department of Transportation, DPWH = Department of Public Works and \nHighways, EDSA = Epifanio delos Santos Avenue. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \n\n \n\nOngoing  project  implementation  and  lessons  learned.  The  ongoing  project\u2019s \n\nimplementation has been successful, and lessons have been drawn from its implementation: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nDemand  for  facility  support  has  exceeded  initial  expectations.  The  facility  is \nsupporting pre-investment activities as varied as feasibility studies and assistance \nwith tenders for infrastructure projects with a total value of more than $30 billion;3 \nThe  facility  has  been  efficient  in  providing  the  DOTr  and  DPWH  with  access  to \ninternational  expertise.  This  enabled  the  preparation  of  technically  complex \nprojects (such as long-span bridges), with which the DOTr and DPWH had no prior \nexperience; \n\n                                                \n3  When the ongoing project was approved, the facility was expected to support only about $3.8 billion of infrastructure \ninvestments. The Infrastructure Preparation and Innovation Facility supports not only projects to be financed by ADB \nbut also those financed by other financing resources. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe facility has assisted the government to make sound and objective investment \ndecisions. For example, the initial project strategic review carried out under outputs \n1-3  helped  the  DOTr  and  DPWH  to  focus  preparation  on  projects  with  higher \nsocioeconomic benefits and to identify realistic preparation steps; \nThe facility has accelerated the implementation of very large infrastructure projects. \nFor example, it has been helping the DOTr tender its large rail and metro projects, \nwhich may have been delayed without the support under the facility; \nThe flexible contracting approach used under the facility (i.e., the use of framework \ncontracts)  has  been  effective  in  helping  the  government  select  projects  to  be \nprepared  and,  subsequently,  launch  feasibility  studies  and  other  pre-investment \nactivities.  Under  the  proposed  additional  financing,  project  preparation  activities \nwill be better defined, and the contracting approach is expected to shift to project-\nbased terms of reference, which will further smoothen implementation; and \nThe  original  loan  fund  for  output  4  has  not  been  used  since  the  government  is \nutilizing separate technical assistance provided by ADB to develop capacity for the \nproject  preparation  activities  (TA  Grant). 4  This  includes  safeguards,  contract \nmanagement  of  consulting  services,  and  accounting  of  the  loan.  Under  the \nproposed additional financing, further intensive capacity development and support \nwill be required to manage the implementation of large-scale projects. \n\n \n\n \n\nUnder the ongoing project, three consulting service contracts totaling $76.8 million have \nbeen  awarded  as  of 30 September  2019,  of  which  $14.7  million  has  been disbursed;  and  one \nconsulting  service  contract  is  under  recruitment.  All  of  the  original  loan  proceeds,  including \ncontingencies,  are  expected  to  be  committed  for  pre-investment  activities  before  the  end  of \nFebruary  2020.  To  mitigate  the  lack  of  capacity  and  experience  of  the  DOTr  and  DPWH  and \nsupport the implementation of the facility, ADB has mobilized project management advisors and \nprovided capacity development programs under the TA Grant. The TA has also been supporting \nthe daily operations of the DOTr and DPWH project management units (PMUs). \n \n\n \n\nThe ongoing project is categorized as performing well since (i) project performance has \nbeen satisfactory;5 (ii) safeguard policy requirements have been complied with, (iii) the expected \noutputs  are  being  achieved,  and  (iv)  risk  management  measures  are  being  implemented \nsuccessfully.6    \n \n\n \n\nProposed  additional  financing.  Foreseeing  that  the  demand  for  project  preparation \nactivities will  exceed  the  availability  of funding  under  the  ongoing  project,  the government  has \nindicated  the  need  for  additional  financing  to  scale  up  the  facility.  The  proposed  additional \nfinancing will finance project readiness activities for high priority large infrastructure projects and \nbuild the capacity of the implementing agencies to implement them. Among others, the proposed \nadditional  financing  will  extend  the  assistance  provided  under  the  ongoing  project  by  bringing \nselected flagship projects initiated under the ongoing project to the stage where civil works can \ncommence. In particular, it will finance the DED of projects for which feasibility studies are being \nundertaken under the ongoing project (e.g., the Bataan\u2013Cavite Interlink Bridge Project and the \nLaguna Lakeshore Road Network Project).7 Furthermore, the proposed additional financing will \n\n                                                \n4  ADB. 2017.

Additional financing is suitable as the proposed project has strong links with the \nongoing  project  in  terms  of  design  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  will  contribute  to \nscaling up the outcome and impact of the facility. All eligibility criteria for additional financing are \nmet, as the proposed project is (i) technically feasible and economically viable; (ii) accorded high \npriority  by  the  government;  (iii)  consistent  with  the  project\u2019s  development  objectives;  and  (iv) \nconsistent with the country partnership strategy (para. 12). \n \n\n \n\nAlignment with ADB country partnership strategy. The proposed additional financing \ndirectly supports ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy\u2019s strategic pillar of accelerating infrastructure \ninvestment,  which  remains  the  government\u2019s  priority.8 It  is  also  an  essential  element  of  ADB\u2019s \ncountry  operations  business  plan.  Three  infrastructure  projects  to  be  supported  under  the \nproposed additional financing are already included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for \npossible ADB financing.9 The overall project will support the preparation of infrastructure projects \nworth more than $5.9 billion in programmed ADB lending for 2020\u20132022. 10 \n \n\n \n\ninternational  consultants \n\nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.

The Department of Finance (DOF) will be the executing agency and the DOTr and DPWH \nwill  be  the  implementing  agencies. 16  The  steering  committee  will  monitor  the  overall \nimplementation of the project and ensure that supported infrastructure projects are prioritized for \npreparation  and  implementation.  Two  PMUs  were  established  under  the  DPWH  for  road  and \nbridge projects and for water projects, and one PMU was established under the DOTr for public \ntransportation projects. Selection of the consultants will be delegated to ADB. The implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \n\nTable 5: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nFebruary 2020\u2013December 2024 \n31 December 2024 \n30 June 2025 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated loan closing date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies \n(iv)  Implementation units \n\nConsulting services \n\nAdvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nSteering committee \nDOF (chair) \nDOTr, DPWH, NEDA, and DBM (members) \nDOF: Office of the Secretary \nDOTr and DPWH  \nDOTr: Office of Undersecretary for Planning: 10 staff \nDPWH: Unified Project Management Office: 20 staff  \nQCBS (90:10)   2800 person-months for \n\nICS \n\ninternational and 3,400 person-\nmonths for national \n25 person-months for \ninternational \n\n$179 million \n\n$1 million \n\nAll recruitment will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB \nBorrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).

The  proposed  additional  financing  will  focus  on  DED  preparation, \nprocurement, and implementation of infrastructure projects. To ensure the technical feasibility and \nquality, the  project  will  finance  independent  proof-checking engineers to review  the  designs  of \ncomplex infrastructure projects. \n \nB. \n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \n\nThe proposed additional financing will generate significant economic benefits. The overall \nproject will complete the preparation and/or facilitate the implementation of public infrastructure \ninvestments valued at more than $30 billion. The project will undertake DEDs only for investments \nwhose economic viability has been confirmed. Road and urban transport investments supported \nby  the  project  will  strongly  contribute  to  the  Philippines\u2019  economic  growth  through  reduced \ntransport costs, improved travel time reliability, and increased domestic productivity. \n \nC. \n \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\nThe  project\u2019s  overall  procurement  risk  is  low  as  ADB  will  select  the  consultants.  The \nfinancial management risk is substantial.17 The TA Grant will continue to support strengthening of \nthe capacity of the accounting divisions of the DOTr and DPWH. The steering committee, chaired \nby the DOF undersecretary and established under the ongoing project, will continue to ensure \neffective oversight and institutional coordination. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  DOF,  DOTr,  and  DPWH.  The \nspecific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are described  in the  PAM  (footnote \n15). \n  \nD. \n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \n\nThe  project  is  not  expected  to  have  direct  poverty,  gender,  or  social  impacts,  but  the \ninfrastructure  projects  prepared  under  the  project  will  generate  such  impacts.  Consultants \ncarrying out DEDs will integrate gender and social considerations into the project design. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\nThe  project  is  not  expected  to  have  direct  social  or  environmental  impacts  or  affect \nindigenous  peoples.  Consultants  carrying  out  DEDs  will  prepare  or  update  environmental  and \nsocial  safeguard  documents.  All  safeguard  documents  shall  be  prepared  in  accordance  with \nnational laws and legislations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). In compliance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, the project\u2019s environmental and social safeguard categories \nare C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people. \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n17 The first submission of audited financial statement for the ongoing project is delayed. \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n \n\n  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 6 and described in detail in \nthe  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.18 The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  of  the \nproject are expected to outweigh its costs. \n \n\nTable 6: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nLimited availability of \nODA funding \n\nInsufficient qualified \ncounterpart staff \n\nInsufficient experience \nto manage the project \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe size of the national infrastructure program is very large, and the \nODA support might not be able to meet the level of financing being \nsought. The project will support packaging of infrastructure projects \nfor financing. \nThe scale of infrastructure projects to be prepared under the \nproposed project means that the key agencies, DOTr and DPWH, \nmay not have sufficient qualified staff. The project and the TA Grant \nwill provide consultants to fill the gap in the short term. \nThe project and the TA Grant will provide additional support to help \nmeet the management and reporting requirements. \n\nDOTr  =  Department  of  Transportation,  DPWH  =  Department  of  Public  Works  and  Highways, \nODA = official development assistance, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n\nThe government and the DOF have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and the DOF have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$200,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for the additional financing of the Infrastructure \nPreparation and Innovation Facility, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility; for a term of 28 years, including a grace period of 9 years; and such other terms \nand conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n\n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n \n20 November 2019 \n \n\n                                                \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n10 \n\nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nOngoing project \nInfrastructure development accelerated (Philippine Development Plan, 2017\u20132022)a \nOverall project \nUnchanged \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\na.
