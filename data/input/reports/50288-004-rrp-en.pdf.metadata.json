THE PROPOSAL \n \n  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of the Philippines for the additional financing of the Infrastructure Preparation and \nInnovation Facility.1 \n  \n  The additional financing will extend the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nthe  Government  of  the  Philippines  under  the  ongoing  project  to  meet  the  government\u2019s \naccelerated infrastructure development objectives. The proposed additional financing, together \nwith the ongoing project, will support project preparation and improve the infrastructure project \nmanagement capacity of the implementing agencies, including the Department of Transportation \n(DOTr) and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). The project will build on the \nongoing project to (i) improve the quality of priority infrastructure project proposals for approval \nby the Investment Coordination Committee (ICC) of the National Economic and Development \nAuthority (NEDA); (ii) accelerate early project implementation following ICC approval through \ndetailed engineering design (DED) and tendering support, with a focus on complex and large \nprojects  requiring  international  expertise;  and  (iii) strengthen  the  government\u2019s  capacity  to \nimplement projects under the implementing agencies. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n  Inadequate  or  underdeveloped  infrastructure  has  been  identified  as  one  of the key \nconstraints on the Philippines\u2019 growth. The 2018 Global Competitiveness Report by the World \nEconomic Forum ranked the Philippines 56th out of 140 countries, advancing it by 29 places since \n2010, mainly based on improvements in the macroeconomic environment.2 However, the country \nranked low on infrastructure (92nd), below other Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia \n(71st),  Thailand  (60th),  and  Malaysia  (32nd).  Among  the  direct  impacts  of  inadequate \ninfrastructure are the high costs of doing business, which undermine business potential and \neconomic opportunities, especially in rapidly growing urban areas. \n \n  The government has been increasing public infrastructure investments under the \u201cBuild, \nBuild, Build\u201d Program to raise the Philippines\u2019 long-term growth potential. In 2016, the government \nannounced a ten-point action plan that targets public spending on infrastructure reaching 7.0% of \ngross domestic product by 2022 from 3.4% in 2016. The government has already achieved \nsubstantial progress on this agenda. In 2018, public spending on infrastructure rose to 5.1% of \ngross  domestic  product.  The  difference  between  the  current  level  of  investment  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s target indicates that efforts to accelerate infrastructure investments should be \nsustained in the coming years. \n \n  ADB approved financing for the facility on 27 October 2017 to offer a short- to medium-\nterm solution to the near-term needs of the DPWH and DOTr to boost their capacity for preparing \npublic infrastructure investments. The facility has four components: (i) output 1: road and bridge \nprojects prepared; (ii) output 2: water projects prepared; (iii) output 3: rail, public transport, port, \nand airport projects prepared; and (iv) output 4: project management capacity of the government \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n2  World Economic Forum. 2018. The Global Competitiveness Report 2018. Geneva. \n ", "2 \nimproved. The project supports preparation of infrastructure projects to be financed by ADB and \nother funding sources. \n \n  The  ongoing  project\u2019s  early  implementation  has  been  effective.  On  behalf  of  the \ngovernment, three framework consultants had been recruited under advance contracting, which \nenabled the DOTr and DPWH to sign the contracts within 2 months after loan effectiveness in \nFebruary 2018. Shortly after their mobilization, the consulting firms conducted an initial project \nstrategic  review,  which  helped  the  DOTr  and  DPWH  identify  priority  projects  and  project \npreparation steps. As a result of the prioritization, the government has decided to focus support \nunder the facility on large and complex projects, which benefit most from access to international \nexpertise. Table 1 shows the major projects that the facility is supporting. These projects are \nexpected to be financed by ADB and other financing sources. \n \nTable 1: Support Provided under the Ongoing Project \nImplementing \nName of Project  Type of Support \nAgency \nBataan\u2013Cavite Interlink Bridge Project  DPWH  Feasibility study \nLaguna Lakeshore Road Network Project  DPWH  Master planning and feasibility study \nSamal Island Davao Bridge Project  DPWH  Feasibility study and DED \nNorth Eastern Luzon Expressway Project  DPWH  Feasibility study \nSorsogon Samar link project  DPWH  Prefeasibility study \nBohol Leyte Bridges Project  DPWH  Prefeasibility study \nMetro Manila Bridges Project  DPWH  DED \nFlood Risk Management Investment  DPWH  Master planning, feasibility study, \nProject for Six Major River Basins  DED, and tender support \nEDSA Greenway Project  DOTr  Feasibility study, DED, and tender \nsupport \nMindanao Rail Project  DOTr  Tender support, technical review, and \nadditional surveys and investigations \nMetro Manila Subway Project  DOTr  Tender support and technical review \nNorth South Commuter Rail and South  DOTr  Tender support and technical review \nLong-Haul Project \nNew Cebu International Container Port  DOTr  Technical review and safeguard \nProject  impact study \nMindanao Central Airport Project  DOTr  Strategy development \nSubic Clark Railway Project  DOTr  Review of feasibility study \nDED = detailed engineering design, DOTr = Department of Transportation, DPWH = Department of Public Works and \nHighways, EDSA = Epifanio delos Santos Avenue. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \n  Ongoing  project  implementation  and  lessons  learned.  The  ongoing  project\u2019s \nimplementation has been successful, and lessons have been drawn from its implementation: \n(i)  Demand  for  facility  support  has  exceeded  initial  expectations.  The  facility  is \nsupporting pre-investment activities as varied as feasibility studies and assistance \nwith tenders for infrastructure projects with a total value of more than $30 billion;3 \n(ii)  The facility has been efficient in providing the DOTr and DPWH with access to \ninternational  expertise.  This  enabled  the  preparation  of  technically  complex \nprojects (such as long-span bridges), with which the DOTr and DPWH had no prior \nexperience; \n                                                \n3  When the ongoing project was approved, the facility was expected to support only about $3.8 billion of infrastructure \ninvestments. The Infrastructure Preparation and Innovation Facility supports not only projects to be financed by ADB \nbut also those financed by other financing resources. \n ", "3 \n(iii)  The facility has assisted the government to make sound and objective investment \ndecisions. For example, the initial project strategic review carried out under outputs \n1-3 helped the DOTr and DPWH to focus preparation on projects with higher \nsocioeconomic benefits and to identify realistic preparation steps; \n(iv)  The facility has accelerated the implementation of very large infrastructure projects. \nFor example, it has been helping the DOTr tender its large rail and metro projects, \nwhich may have been delayed without the support under the facility; \n(v)  The flexible contracting approach used under the facility (i.e., the use of framework \ncontracts) has been effective in helping the government select projects to be \nprepared and, subsequently, launch feasibility studies and other pre-investment \nactivities. Under the proposed additional financing, project preparation activities \nwill be better defined, and the contracting approach is expected to shift to project-\nbased terms of reference, which will further smoothen implementation; and \n(vi)  The original loan fund for output 4 has not been used since the government is \nutilizing separate technical assistance provided by ADB to develop capacity for the \nproject  preparation  activities  (TA  Grant).4 This  includes  safeguards,  contract \nmanagement  of  consulting  services,  and  accounting  of  the  loan.  Under  the \nproposed additional financing, further intensive capacity development and support \nwill be required to manage the implementation of large-scale projects. \n \n  Under the ongoing project, three consulting service contracts totaling $76.8 million have \nbeen awarded as of 30 September 2019, of which $14.7 million has been disbursed; and one \nconsulting service contract is under recruitment. All of the original loan proceeds, including \ncontingencies, are expected to be committed for pre-investment activities before the end of \nFebruary 2020. To mitigate the lack of capacity and experience of the DOTr and DPWH and \nsupport the implementation of the facility, ADB has mobilized project management advisors and \nprovided capacity development programs under the TA Grant. The TA has also been supporting \nthe daily operations of the DOTr and DPWH project management units (PMUs). \n \n  The ongoing project is categorized as performing well since (i) project performance has \nbeen satisfactory;5 (ii) safeguard policy requirements have been complied with, (iii) the expected \noutputs  are  being  achieved,  and  (iv)  risk  management  measures  are  being  implemented \nsuccessfully.6    \n \n  Proposed additional financing. Foreseeing that the demand for project preparation \nactivities will exceed the availability of funding under the ongoing project, the government has \nindicated the need for additional financing to scale up the facility. The proposed additional \nfinancing will finance project readiness activities for high priority large infrastructure projects and \nbuild the capacity of the implementing agencies to implement them. Among others, the proposed \nadditional financing will extend the assistance provided under the ongoing project by bringing \nselected flagship projects initiated under the ongoing project to the stage where civil works can \ncommence. In particular, it will finance the DED of projects for which feasibility studies are being \nundertaken under the ongoing project (e.g., the Bataan\u2013Cavite Interlink Bridge Project and the \nLaguna Lakeshore Road Network Project).7 Furthermore, the proposed additional financing will \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2017.

Additional financing is suitable as the proposed project has strong links with the \nongoing project in terms of design and implementation arrangements, and will contribute to \nscaling up the outcome and impact of the facility. All eligibility criteria for additional financing are \nmet, as the proposed project is (i) technically feasible and economically viable; (ii) accorded high \npriority by the government; (iii) consistent with the project\u2019s development objectives; and (iv) \nconsistent with the country partnership strategy (para. 12). \n \n  Alignment with ADB country partnership strategy. The proposed additional financing \ndirectly supports ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy\u2019s strategic pillar of accelerating infrastructure \ninvestment, which remains the government\u2019s priority.8 It is also an essential element of ADB\u2019s \ncountry  operations  business  plan.  Three  infrastructure  projects  to  be  supported  under  the \nproposed additional financing are already included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for \npossible ADB financing.9 The overall project will support the preparation of infrastructure projects \nworth more than $5.9 billion in programmed ADB lending for 2020\u20132022. 10 \n \n  Value added by ADB assistance. The ongoing project is the first TA loan for the \nGovernment of Philippines. The ADB assistance constitute a novel means to support the DOTr \nand DPWH in delivering more effective and innovative infrastructure projects through (i) enabling \nmobilization  of  international  consultants  in  project  preparation;  (ii)  enhanced  effective \nidentification, analysis, and planning for infrastructure gaps using international best practices, \nespecially in roads, urban transport, and flood management; (iii) addressing critical constraints \nsuch  as  resettlement  and  inadequate  access  to  international  knowledge,  best  practices, \ninnovation, and technology; and (iv) implementation management of complex public infrastructure \nprojects with international expertise to supplement national expertise and resources. The project \nwill also strengthen the capacity of the government to implement projects under the implementing \nagencies. \n \n  Alignment with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. The project supports the implementation of ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 as summarized in Table 2.11  \n \nTable 2: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030   Project\u2019s Contributions \nKey Operational Priorities \nAccelerating progress in gender  Infrastructure  projects  prepared  under  the  project  will  generate \nequality  progress  in  gender  equality.

In such cases, proper due \ndiligence will be carried out.   \n ", "8 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n  Under the proposed additional financing, the implementing agencies will continue to tap \ninto international expertise for the preparation of major public investment projects, often involving \nhigh-level  technologies.  The  proposed  additional  financing  will  focus  on  DED  preparation, \nprocurement, and implementation of infrastructure projects. To ensure the technical feasibility and \nquality, the project will finance independent proof-checking engineers to review the designs of \ncomplex infrastructure projects. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n  The proposed additional financing will generate significant economic benefits. The overall \nproject will complete the preparation and/or facilitate the implementation of public infrastructure \ninvestments valued at more than $30 billion. The project will undertake DEDs only for investments \nwhose economic viability has been confirmed. Road and urban transport investments supported \nby the project will strongly contribute to the Philippines\u2019 economic growth through reduced \ntransport costs, improved travel time reliability, and increased domestic productivity. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n  The project\u2019s overall procurement risk is low as ADB will select the consultants. The \nfinancial management risk is substantial.17 The TA Grant will continue to support strengthening of \nthe capacity of the accounting divisions of the DOTr and DPWH. The steering committee, chaired \nby the DOF undersecretary and established under the ongoing project, will continue to ensure \neffective oversight and institutional coordination. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) was explained to and discussed with the government, DOF, DOTr, and DPWH. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote \n15). \n  \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n  The project is not expected to have direct poverty, gender, or social impacts, but the \ninfrastructure  projects  prepared  under  the  project  will  generate  such  impacts.  Consultants \ncarrying out DEDs will integrate gender and social considerations into the project design. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n  The project is not expected to have direct social or environmental impacts or affect \nindigenous peoples. Consultants carrying out DEDs will prepare or update environmental and \nsocial safeguard documents. All safeguard documents shall be prepared in accordance with \nnational laws and legislations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). In compliance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, the project\u2019s environmental and social safeguard categories \nare C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people. \n \n   \n                                                \n17 The first submission of audited financial statement for the ongoing project is delayed. \n ", "9 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 6 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.18 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nproject are expected to outweigh its costs. \n \nTable 6: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLimited availability of  The size of the national infrastructure program is very large, and the \nODA funding  ODA support might not be able to meet the level of financing being \nsought. The project will support packaging of infrastructure projects \nfor financing. \nInsufficient qualified  The scale of infrastructure projects to be prepared under the \ncounterpart staff  proposed project means that the key agencies, DOTr and DPWH, \nmay not have sufficient qualified staff. The project and the TA Grant \nwill provide consultants to fill the gap in the short term. \nInsufficient experience  The project and the TA Grant will provide additional support to help \nto manage the project  meet the management and reporting requirements. \nDOTr = Department of Transportation, DPWH = Department of Public Works and Highways, \nODA = official development assistance, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n  The government and the DOF have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and the DOF have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$200,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for the additional financing of the Infrastructure \nPreparation and Innovation Facility, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility; for a term of 28 years, including a grace period of 9 years; and such other terms \nand conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n \n20 November 2019 \n \n                                                \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  10 \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nOngoing project \nInfrastructure development accelerated (Philippine Development Plan, 2017\u20132022)a \nOverall project \nUnchanged \n \nPerformance  Data Sources and \nIndicators with  Reporting \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nOngoing project  Ongoing project     \nBy 2022:  Political support \nDelivery and quality of  a.
