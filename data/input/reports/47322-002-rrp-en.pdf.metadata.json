This  is  the  second  subprogram  under  the  programmatic \napproach, which will build on current government-led reforms supported by a multi-partner policy \naction matrix.2 Its focus improved (i) management of public finances, assets, and liabilities; and \n(ii) economic environment for the private sector, aligns with the Kiribati Development Plan (KDP) \nfor 2016\u20132019 and Kiribati Vision 20 (KV20).3 Subprogram 2 aligns with the operational priority \nof  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  of  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity \nunder Strategy 2030.4 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\n \nA. \n \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \n\nDevelopment  challenges.  One  of  the  most  remote  and  geographically  dispersed \ncountries in the world, Kiribati comprises 33 islands spread over 5 million square kilometers of \nocean. Kiribati is classified as a fragile and conflicted affected situation, and this fragility and the \nlimited government capacity has guided the scope of this program.5 The capital, Tarawa, is about \n4,000  kilometers  from  the  major  trade  markets  of  Australia,  Hawaii,  and  New  Zealand.  The \nextreme remoteness and large dispersion create significant hurdles to service delivery. Kiribati\u2019s \nlow-lying atolls rise by an average of 1.8 meters above sea level and are therefore at the forefront \nof climate change. Thus the country is vulnerable to external shocks because of its geographic \ncharacteristics;  high  exposure  to  the  negative  effects  of  climate  change;  high  dependence  on \nimports; and heavy reliance on income from external sources such as investment income from its \nsovereign wealth fund, the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF).  \n \n\n \n\nThe government is the largest employer but its capacity, including that of central ministries, \nis  hampered  by  limited  skills  in  public  finance,  accounting,  economic  assessment,  and  project \nmanagement. Outdated and  ineffective  information  technology  systems worsen  these  capacity \nconstraints. As a result there is limited publicly available information on the government\u2019s fiscal \nstrategy, cash management and management of the RERF have not been as effective as would \nbe  ideal,  and  potential  economies  from  centralized  and  professionally  managed  public \nprocurement are missed. The government also relies heavily on development partner financing \nand  imported technical capacity for  major  project  implementation.  Like  many  Pacific  countries, \nKiribati has been struggling with the build-and-rebuild cycle of infrastructure provision, and found \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.

Tarawa. \n\nManila. \n\n5   ADB  identified  nine  developing  members  in  fragile  and  conflict-affected  situations  in  2018:  Afghanistan,  the \nFederated  States  of  Micronesia,    Kiribati,  the  Marshall  Islands,  Myanmar,  Nauru,  Papua  New  Guinea,  Solomon \nIslands, and Tuvalu.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fit hard to fund operation and maintenance. Increased availability of development partner funds \nand  lessons  learned  are  changing  the  situation  as  projects  build  the  capacity  to  operate  and \nmaintain the infrastructure provided. Access to public services is inequitable despite best efforts \nbecause small and remote populations prove costly to serve. \n \n\n \n\nPrivate  sector  development  has  been  constrained  by  high  business,  investment,  and \nconnectivity costs. The public sector plays a dominant role in the economy, absorbing available \nskilled  staff  and  crowding  out  private  initiatives  through  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  that \noperate in potentially competitive sectors.6 Further divestment and outsourcing of SOE activities \nto the private sector is required to encourage private sector-led growth.7 An effective program of \nasset maintenance offers another opportunity for private sector development while at the same \ntime ensuring that new public assets are maintained for future effective use. Without independent \nmonetary and exchange rate policies\u2014Kiribati has adopted the Australian dollar, and the leverage \nof banking regulation and interest rate policy is limited\u2014the government relies on fiscal policy to \nmanage the impact of shocks and stimulate inclusive growth. The International Monetary Fund \n(IMF)  considers  Kiribati  to  be  at  high  risk  of  debt  distress;  its  baseline  scenario  shows  debt \nindicators to be breached given weak growth prospects and the long-term cost of climate change \n(footnote 6). The reforms supported by this program aim to strengthen the fiscal environment and \nboost growth to build resilience to shocks. \n \n\n \n\nRecent  economic  and  fiscal  performance.  Economic  performance  has  been  strong \nrecently: despite intrinsic challenges, gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 3% yearly during \n2011\u20132017, buoyed by revenues from fishing licenses and investments by development partners \nin  roads,  waste  management,  and  sanitation.  The  current  account  relies  heavily  on  imported \ngoods and is constrained in terms of exports\u2014exports of mostly copra and fish totaled $14 million \nin  2016\u2014but  is  typically  in  surplus  because  of  fishing  license  fees,  RERF  income,  and \nremittances. Inflation has remained low (Table 1). \n \n\n \n\nFishing license revenue in 2016\u20132017 exceeded A$150 million, or 60% of GDP, yearly.8 \nWhile this is a decline from the peak in 2015 (A$207 million), fishing license revenue remains a \nsignificant source of income; the A$130 million in projected revenue for 2018 was achieved by \nOctober. Tax revenue during 2011\u20132016 stagnated at 14%\u201316% of GDP, though a strong focus \non revenue administration and collection of arrears underpinned a rise in tax revenue in 2017. \nAfter the 2016 election of a government with a policy platform focused on improving the quality of \nlife in the outer islands, public expenditure rose, driven by large infrastructure projects financed \nby development partners, and increases in health and education spending. The copra subsidy \nwas raised from A$8.0 million in 2015 to A$22.8 million in 2016, to A$30.6 million in 2017 because \nit  is  seen  as  a  means  for  people  to  remain  on  the  outer  islands  and  for  the  government  to \nredistribute  rising  resource  wealth.9 Stagnating  wages  since  2011  caused  social  pressures  to \nbuild,  and  in  2018  salaries  were  adjusted  by  21%  in  real terms.  Higher expenditure  and  lower \nfishing revenue contributed to lowering the fiscal surplus from the equivalent of 42.6% of GDP in \n2015 to 4.1% of GDP in 2016, and reverting it to a deficit of 9.2% of GDP in 2017 (Table 1).10 A \n\n                                                \n6  International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2017. Kiribati: 2017 Article IV Consultation\u2014Press Release and Staff Report. \n\nIMF Country Report. No. 17/386. Washington, DC. \n\n7  International Monetary Fund Letter of Assessment (accessible from list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  Through regional cooperation via the Parties to the Nauru Agreement, Kiribati and several other Pacific economies \nhave  been  able  to  achieve  a  structural  shift  to  higher  fishing  license  fees\u2014the  minimum  cost  for  a  vessel-day \nincreased from $2,500 in 2010 to more than $10,000 in 2017. \n\n9  The copra subsidy is the government\u2019s main form of income redistribution and social welfare to the outer islands. \nThe government requested New Zealand's support for a review of potential efficient and equitable alternatives to the \ncopra subsidy; the terms of reference for this support await government approval. \n\n10 The government\u2019s 2016 accounts (those audited most recently) were subject to a disclaimer audit opinion, given the \nA$709,080 variance between the total revised budget and the annual account, and hence the budget\u2019s underestimate \nof savings. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nfiscal  deficit  of  7.3%  of  GDP  is  projected  for  2018,  after  a  supplementary  budget  passed  in \nSeptember mobilized higher than expected fisheries revenue to finance additional expenditure. \n \n\n \n\nMedium-term fiscal path. ADB forecasts growth to remain at 2.3% in 2018 and 2019, but \ndeclining fishing license revenues are expected to result in a fiscal deficit of 7.3% of GDP in 2018 \nand 10.9% of GDP in 2019. The recent sustained increases in RERF investment income mean \nthat the fund has achieved the A$1 billion level ahead of its 2020 target; given this growth, RERF \ndeposits in 2015 and 2016 were not continued in 2017 or 2018. A backlog of expenditure demands \n(e.g., wages, copra subsidies, transportation assets) remains. The government recognizes that \nthe volatility of fishing revenues, severe infrastructure deficits (particularly on the outer islands), \nlimited capacity to take on new debt, and the negative effects of climate change mean that it must \nremain vigilant and continue efforts to build fiscal buffers and secure support from development \npartners  for  project  and  policy  financing.  Future  budget  decisions  will  need  to  account  for  a \nprudent assessment of Kiribati\u2019s spending goals and revenue projections and the management \ntargets of the RERF. Maintaining a sustainable budget position in the medium term will be central \nto this effort, based on fishing revenue projections that allow the government to protect its public \nexpenditure programs from potential revenue volatility, complemented by an appropriately sized \ncash reserve to deal with external shocks. \n \n\nTable 1: Economic and Fiscal Performance, 2015\u20132019a \n2015 \n \n\n2017e \n \n\n2016 \n \n\n2018p \n \n\nItem \nIncome, growth, and inflationb \nGDP per capita ($, current) \nGDP growth (%, constant market prices) \nConsumer prices (% change) \nCentral government financec \nTotal revenue and grants (% of GDP) \n \n \n \n \n  Grants and transfers \nTotal expenditure (% of GDP) \nCurrent expenditure \n \n \nCapital expenditure \nOverall balance (% of GDP) \nFishing license fees (A$ million) \n \n\nTax revenue \nNontax revenue \n \n\nRevenue \n \n \n \n\nof which: fishing revenue \n\n1,683.6 \n3.5 \n0.6 \n \n\n1,654.2 \n1.8 \n0.7 \n \n\n1,728.8 \n2.5 \n2.2 \n \n\n1,807.4 \n2.3 \n2.5 \n \n\n155.8 \n110.4 \n15.5 \n94.9 \n92.0 \n45.4 \n113.2 \n60.3 \n52.9 \n42.6 \n207.1 \n \n \n\n116.4 \n83.7 \n15.7 \n68.0 \n65.1 \n32.7 \n112.3 \n71.4 \n40.9 \n4.1 \n159.0 \n \n \n\n136.0 \n79.1 \n17.3 \n61.8 \n58.6 \n56.9 \n145.1 \n85.3 \n59.8 \n(9.2) \n150.0 \n \n \n\n129.2 \n72.3 \n17.3 \n55.0 \n52.0 \n56.9 \n136.4 \n74.3 \n62.1 \n(7.3) \n138.3 \n \n \n\n2019p \n \n\n1,760.0 \n2.3 \n2.5 \n \n\n122.1 \n68.3 \n17.2 \n51.1 \n48.1 \n53.9 \n133.0 \n73.2 \n59.8 \n(10.9) \n133.3 \n \n \n\nRERF \n\u2026 \nRERF deposits (% of GDP) \nRERF closing balance (A$ million) \n976.1 \n\u2026 = data not available, ( ) = negative, ADB = Asian Development Bank, e = estimate, GDP = gross domestic product, \nIMF = International Monetary Fund, p = projection, RERF = Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund. \na  IMF data is predominantly used as the IMF provides Kiribati central government finance data in the government\u2019s \n\n12.3 \n867.8 \n\n22.3 \n756.1 \n\n0 \n948.9 \n\n0 \n922.6 \n\nfinancial statistics format. \n\nb  ADB estimates and projections. \nc  ADB estimates of 2018 data were based on IMF data and the government\u2019s 2018 supplementary appropriation. \nSources: IMF. 2017.

Approved  in  2018,  KV20  is  Kiribati\u2019s  first  long-term \ndevelopment planning framework. It seeks to maximize the development benefits from fisheries \nand tourism as key productive sectors, and strategies include (i) promoting inclusive trade and \n\n \n\n\fthe private sector for sustainable development, and (ii) undertaking reforms to improve the quality \nand efficiency of public service and service delivery. The KDP is the implementing mechanism \nthat will be used to execute KV20 objectives, and it sets out the overarching objective of a more \nstable macroeconomic framework (footnote 2). \n \n\n \n\nGovernment reform progress. The KDP has provided guidance to reform through its key \npriority areas of human resource development, economic growth and poverty reduction, health, \nenvironment, governance, and infrastructure. Policy actions are designed to support these key \npriority areas along with developing a sustainable macroeconomic environment to ensure long-\nterm sustainability. \n \n\n \n\nTechnical  assistance  (TA),  policy  dialogue,  and  policy-based  financing  from  ADB  and \nother development partners have helped the government prioritize, appropriately sequence, and \nimplement reforms focused on improving weak economic management, containing unsustainable \nRERF drawdowns, managing high levels of non-concessional debt and stopping uncoordinated \nborrowing  by  ministries  made  without  approval  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic \nDevelopment (MFED), improving poorly performing SOEs, and building capacity to improve the \nweak management of fisheries revenues.11 \n \n\n \n\nDevelopment partner coordination. The Economic Reform Taskforce (ERT), chaired by \nthe  secretary  to  the  cabinet,  is  the  main  forum  for  consultation  and  coordination  between  the \ngovernment and development partners on the implementation of policy action reforms.12 The ERT \ncomprises  representatives  from  the  MFED;  implementing  agencies  such  as  the  Ministry  of \nFisheries  and  Marine  Resources  Development;  the  Ministry  of  Information,  Communication, \nTransport, and Tourism Development; and development partners. The ERT meetings, held during \njoint missions by all four development partner members, provide a forum for facilitating dialogue, \nmonitoring progress, and coordinating TA. Other avenues for coordination include the annual IMF \nArticle IV consultations and the biennial Development Partners Forum. \n \n\n \n\nADB collaborated closely with the World Bank and the governments of Australia and New \nZealand in preparing this program, which is underpinned by a joint government-led policy matrix \nmonitored  by  the  ERT. 13 This,  along  with  complementary  measures  such  as  joint  missions, \nreduces transaction costs for the government while increasing the policy impact. ADB and the \nWorld Bank consulted the IMF and its Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre to coordinate \npolicy advice and TA, particularly in fisheries revenue and public finance management (PFM). As \npart of ADB\u2019s differentiated approach to small island developing states and FCAS highlighted in \nStrategy  2030  (foonote  3),  considerable  TA  is  being  provided  to  Kiribati  in  coordination  with \ndevelopment  partners  to  facilitate  reform  implementation,  as  specifically  identified  in  the \ndiscussion of reform areas below. \n \n\n \n\nPolicy  actions.  The  KDP  provides  the  framework  from  which  policy  actions  were \ndeveloped  (para.  9).  The  overall  development  objective  of  the  program  is  to  achieve  a  stable \n                                                \n11 During  2013\u20132016,  the  government  undertook  important  measures  to  improve fiscal management  of  debt policy. \nKiribati has adopted a debt policy establishing criteria for concessional and non-concessional public borrowing and \nformal procedures for contracting new debt, consistent with sustainable macroeconomic management. It has also \nimproved the management of public debt by establishing a comprehensive database of public debt. Kiribati\u2019s current \ndebt portfolio constitutes external debt only\u2014from ADB and Taipei,China\u2014since all domestic debt was cleared in \n2015. There is no SOE debt, and none of the SOEs have overdraft facilities with the Australia and New Zealand \nBanking Group Limited (ANZ Bank). \n\n12 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ERT members include ADB, \nAustralia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the \nWorld Bank. The ERT is chaired by the secretary to the cabinet with the MFED as secretariat. \n\n13 The joint policy matrix contains all ADB policy matrix actions as well as three additional actions related to fisheries \ndevelopment: amendments to the Fisheries Act, review of all fisheries joint ventures, and publication of the updated \nFisheries Revenue Report on the MFED website. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nmacroeconomic  framework.  The  effect  of  the  reform  will  be  improved  overall  economic \nmanagement.  The  program  has  two  reform  areas  supported  across  the  two  subprograms  and \nsubprogram  2  contains  nine  policy  actions  (Appendix  4).  The  government  completed  all  nine \nactions for subprogram 2. Some indicative actions identified during the processing of subprogram \n1 have required modification or removal to reflect changing circumstances and significant capacity \nconstraints,  however  all  adjustments  have  been  made  while  ensuring  a  qualitatively  strong \nprogram  processing  government\u2019s  medium  term  objective. 14  A  post-program  monitoring \nframework was developed and agreed with the government to support progress towards these \nmedium  term  objectives,  and  guide  policy  dialogue  and  TA  to  further  the  program  objectives \nbeyond its completion date. The ERT will monitor and report on framework implementation to the \nMFED and development partners, including ADB. Framework implementation will be supported \nby  coordinated  technical  assistance  from  all  partners,  and  progress  within  the  framework  will \nguide the development of future policy-based operations by development partners. \n \n\n \n\nReform  area  1:  Management  of  public  finances,  assets,  and  liabilities  improved. \nThese reforms will contribute to wider improvements in the maintenance of fiscal sustainability, \nthe containment of fiscal risks, and overall improvement to PFM practices. \n \n\n \n\nThe government completed, and the cabinet endorsed, the evaluation and selection of an \nRERF custodian. The RERF is Kiribati\u2019s most significant financial asset; it was designed so its \nincome  provides  additional  budget  financing  given  the  domestic  revenue  constraints.  The \ngovernment has set out the policy intent to ensure sound RERF management. Under subprogram \n1, the government completed a review of its RERF custodial arrangements to make sure that the \nservices of the current provider remain competitive with current market practice and benchmarks; \nthe  review  recommended  competitive  selection  of  a  new  custodian.  The  RERF  Investment \nCommittee selected a preferred service provider and undertook due diligence on this provider, \nand the cabinet endorsed the selection. The indicative action envisaged that the contract between \nthe government and the custodian would be signed by now but this has not yet happened because \nof extended commercial negotiations that are outside the government\u2019s direct control. \n \n\n \n\nThe cabinet endorsed a set of objectives for managing the RERF designed to achieve the \ngovernment\u2019s target of reaching fund assets of A$1 billion by 2020. Government efforts moved \nbeyond  the  strengthened  custodial  arrangement  discussed  in  para.  16  to  improve  RERF \ngovernance by approving a set of objectives to achieve a nominal value of A$1 billion by 2020.15 \nThe RERF objectives are to (i) enable the government to become self-sufficient in its ability to \nfinance  future  development  projects,  (ii)  manage  the  fund  in  a  way  that  maximizes  the  return \nbenefits from long-term investing without incurring undue risk, and (iii) manage the fund for future \nsustainability  by  making  sure  that  the  real  long-term  value  of  the  assets  is  maintained.  This \nadditional  action  by  government  reflects  its  commitment  to  both  improved  governance  of  the \nRERF, and the broader medium term objective of strengthened management of all government \nassets. \n \nThe government further improved its management of contingent liabilities. While Kiribati \nhas limited external debt,16 the implementation of a public sector debt database in subprogram 1 \nenabled the government to better monitor all debt, including contingent liabilities such as small \ndebts  incurred  in  SOE  daily  operations.  Elsewhere  in  the  Pacific,  SOEs  have  on  occasions \nentered into debt, for which government was liable, without requisite approvals \u2013 Kiribati\u2019s close \nmonitoring of debt acts to minimize the risk of this occurring. Strong adherence to process and \n\n \n\n                                                \n14 Three actions were removed, three new actions were added to reflect progress against the government\u2019s reform plan \nbased on recommendations from the public expenditure and financial accountability framework assessment, and two \nunderwent some wording changes. \n\n15 The World Bank provided support for this task and the objectives are alined with best practices. \n16 The IMF estimates this at just over $53 million in 2017 (footnote 6). \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\ncapability  strengthening  kept  this  up  to  date  through  2018  allowing  for  close  monitoring  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s overall debt position. The 2017 financial statements of the five major SOEs\u2014Air \nKiribati Limited, Development Bank of Kiribati, Kiribati Oil Company Ltd, Kiribati Ports Authority, \nand the Public Utilities Board\u2014and of the Kiribati Provident Fund were completed and submitted \nto the Kiribati National Audit Office for audit. This is a significant and sustained turnaround from \nthe  situation  just  a  few  years  ago  where    such  audits  were  many  years  behind  and  the  true \nfinancial positions of these SOEs were unknown. Better-managed contingent liabilities were a key \narea of reform to support fiscal stability, and the government allocated the necessary resources \nto sustain this activity. \n\n \n\n \nPublic finance management. The government initiated a comprehensive report on the \nshortcomings  of  its  financial  management  information  system  (FMIS)  although  the  start  was \ndelayed due to delays in donor financing. An indicative action proposed for subprogram 2 was \nremoved from the matrix because financing for this work was delayed, and the complex analysis \nin the report requires more time to ensure a quality product. This report will be finalized in late \n2018  and  is  expected  to  lead  to  a  request-for-proposal  process  to  enable  the  improvement  or \nreplacement  of  the  FMIS,  for  which  the  government  has  already  set  aside  funding,  a  strong \ndemonstration  of  its  intent  to  progress  this  work.  The  post-program  monitoring  framework \nhighlights the next steps in this process. \n \n\n \n\nGovernment has undertaken additional actions to strengthen public financial management \n\u2013 reflected as two new actions in subprogram 2. First, while the government regularly develops a \ncomprehensive  annual  fiscal  strategy,  it  has  never  made  this  public.  To  improve  budget \ntransparency, the government published the fiscal strategy and committed to annual publication \nof its strategy. The content of the strategy and its publication are consistent with best practice and \nrespond  directly  to  the  IMF\u2019s  recommendations  from  its  public  expenditure  and  financial \naccountability framework assessment. \n \n\n \n\nSecond,  a  commitment  to  more  robust  cash  management,  as  outlined  in  the  fiscal \nstrategy, was realized through the development of a cash management policy and its approval by \nthe cabinet. The implementation of the policy resulted in the transfer of cash balances from zero-\ninterest  accounts  into  an  interest-bearing  account.  This  will  bring  cash  in  these  accounts  from \nabout 7 months of recurrent budget down to 3 months, as suggested by the IMF. A planned review \nof the number and role of special funds accounts will further improve the management of cash \nreserves.17 \n \n\n \n\nCommunity  service  obligations.  As  an  important  budgetary  item  for  SOEs,  the \ngovernment published SOE funding guidelines on its website to make clear the purpose of funding \nand  how  applications  can  be  made.  This  has  strengthened  the  direct  link  between  the  cost  of \nproviding the non-commercial community service and the amount transferred through the budget. \nThis  has  eliminated  the  need  for  regular  cash  injections  to  bring  the  SOEs  back  into  a  sound \nfinancial position. \n \n\n \n\nState-owned  enterprises.  In  2017,  under  subprogram  1,  the  cabinet  approved  a \nconcession-plus-lease arrangement for the government-owned Captain Cook Hotel on Kiritimati \nisland. Based on feedback from the Attorney General regarding irregularities, negotiation with the \npreferred bidder was terminated and the procurement process restarted. That this irregularity was \ndetected  and  acted  upon,  in  line  with  set  procedures,  should  be  considered  a  successful \ndemonstration of the effectiveness of the government reform processes. Progress has since been \ngood, and the cabinet approved a preferred bidder for negotiation to commence. The contract is \nnot expected to be finalized until late 2018 or early 2019, so this indicative action was removed \n                                                \n17 The government estimated that the excess cash holding could be costing it as much as A$1.8 million per year in \n\nforgone interest. \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nfrom the matrix. However, the completion of this contract award is reflected in the post-program \nmonitoring framework.18 \n \n\n \n\nProcurement.  In  2017,  the  cabinet  approved  the  Kiribati  Public  Procurement  Reform \nProgram  as  a  first  step  to  overhaul  outdated  and  incomplete  procurement  processes  and \ngovernance. This was included as a new action to reflect the steps toward reform taken in 2018 \nto establish a Central Procurement Office and hire a chief procurement officer and a procurement \nofficer, ensuring equal opportunity employment. With TA provided by ADB and cofinanced by the \nGovernment of New Zealand, these officers will develop all policies and processes for centralized \nprocurement. This action is reflected in the policy matrix in recognition that a centralized unit with \ndedicated  staff  will  ensure  an  immediate  focus  on  procurement,  and  the  planned  reforms  will \nestablish strong regulations and legislation to support transparent and efficient procurement. \n \n\n \n\nReform area 2: Environment for the private sector improved. Since growth led by the \n\nprivate sector is important for the government, the program supports the following reforms: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nAccess  to  basic  utilities.  The  government  approved  water  tariffs  to  be \nimplemented  at  pilot  sites  in  Tarawa.  Access  to  reliable  and  responsibly  costed \nelectricity and water is vital to encourage the growth of the private sector. After the \nsuccessful introduction of electricity tariffs in 2017 the government approved water \ntariffs  in  2018.  Two  pilot  sites  received,  for  the  first  time,  piped  water  that  is \navailable 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through a pressurized system; services \nare being charged at the set tariffs. Implementation will be analyzed with a view to \nfurther rollouts in parallel with 24/7 water availability across Tarawa. The tariffs are \naligned to cost recovery based on cost plus community service obligation, so the \nsetting and collection of tariffs underpin the provision of a reliable water service. \n\nAssets.  The  government  made  a  commitment  to  the  development  of  an  asset \nregistry  and  asset  management  plan.  A  statement  of  commitment  to  asset \nmanagement  and  maintenance  was  included  in  the  fiscal  strategy  for  the  2019 \nbudget. The management plan for all major government-owned assets, originally \nplanned  for  2018  in  the  indicative  actions,  was  delayed  because  of  the \nunavailability of development partner support, but is expected to be underway in \nearly  2019.  The  completion  of  the  plan  is  in  the  post-program  monitoring \nframework and will be tracked by the ERT. Asset management and maintenance \nbudgets will provide private sector opportunities for contracts. \n\nPublic\u2013private  partnership  concessions.  In  2017,  the government terminated \nthe existing concession agreement and assigned the management of the Otintaai \nHotel to the Kiribati Provident Fund. The fund has since begun civil works to make \nthe hotel commercially viable and hired a firm to complete a feasibility study, which \nis expected to be finalized in early 2019. As a result the indicative action regarding \nthe contracting out of the Otintaii is now a medium term government objective, the \nshort term focus being on completion of the feasibility study to allow the information \nneeded for planning the future of the hotel to be available. There are no actions \naorund the Otintaii Hotel, rather progress on having Government step back from \nthe operation of the hotel will be monitored through the post program monitoring \nframework.   \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s value addition. ADB has played a critical role in (i) identifying priority SOE, PFM, \nand  business  environment  reforms  to  support  the  government\u2019s  reform  agenda; (ii)  enhancing \ndevelopment  coordination  by  coordinating  and  collaborating  with  other  development  partner \n                                                \n18 The post-program management framework is in the policy matrix in Appendix 4. \n\n \n\n \n\n\finitiatives; and (iii) providing TA for capacity building and reform implementation, particularly SOE \nreform. 19 Given  the  government's  limited  administrative  capacity,  the  aim  to  stem  significant \ndeterioration in infrastructure assets and improve service delivery to the outer islands would have \nbeen difficult and costly to realize without ADB's technical, strategic, and financial support. This \nsupport aligns with the KDP and is consistent with the Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020 and its focus \non reducing the cost of doing business and providing social services, managing risks from natural \nand  economic  shocks,  and  enabling  value  creation  by  supporting  private  sector  growth  and \ninvestment.20 Future ADB support will continue to make the implementation of reforms (SOE and \nprocurement) easier. Learning from subprogram 1 and other policy-based lending in the Pacific, \nsubprogram  2  focuses  on  supporting  the  stated  priorities  of  the  government,  breaking  reform \nareas  into  achievable  steps,  and  providing  needed  support for the government  to follow  these \nthrough to the end. \n \nC. \n \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n \n\nThe implementation of the policy actions across the two subprograms contributed to the \nimprovement  of  Kiribati\u2019s  economic  management  and  the  development  of  a  much  stronger \nmacroeconomic framework. The  actions  under  the first reform  area (on management  of  public \nfinances,  assets,  and  liabilities)  includes  actions  to  strengthen  the  management  of  Kiribati\u2019s \nsovereign wealth fund, improve cash management, auditing of SOEs, and address weaknesses \nin  the  public  investment  cycle,  including  procurement.  These  actions  should  contribute  to \nenhancing  the  management  of  financial  assets,  the  quality  of  public  spending,  and  the \nperformance of SOEs. Improvement in timeliness and quality of accounting and auditing of SOEs \nwill strengthen governance, transparency and accountability, which is in turn expected to improve \ntheir  performance  and  service  delivery  and  help  avoid  unsustainable  borrowing,  reduce \ncontingent liabilities, create more room for private investment, and improve reliability, efficiency, \nand affordability of public services. Critical areas of work begun during the program will continue, \nincluding the work toward an improved FMIS and the development of an asset management and \nmaintenance culture. These and related actions have improved the ability of the MFED to manage \nand report on the economy. Increased macroeconomic resilience resulting from program reforms \nwill  reduce  the  negative  impact  of  external  shocks,  including  on  growth  and  service  delivery. \nFurthermore,  the  public  sector  is  a  substantial  employer  of  women,  and  has  been  effective  in \nensuring women have access to high level positions \u2013 in 2017 women held 54% of Secretary of \nMinistry  positions  (footnote  6).  This  equal  opportunity  approach  to  recruitment  saw  women \nemployed for both the new procurement positions created. \n \n\n \n\nThe  second  reform  area,  on  improving  the  environment  for  the  private  sector,  includes \nactions  to  expand  access  to  safe  drinking  water  in  a  sustainable  manner  and  support  asset \nmaintenance. Improvements in the delivery of basic water services have an impact on the most \nvulnerable  segment  of  Kiribati's  society  and  will  disproportionately  benefit  women  and  girls: \ndirectly by reducing time spent fetching water for washing and cleaning, and indirectly through \nbetter health outcomes since the prevalence of diarrhea and dysentery is higher among girls than \nboys, and also because I-Kiribati women are mainly responsible for caring for sick children. It is \nnotable that 23% of households are headed by women.21 \n \n\n                                                \n19 ADB. 2013.

The grant will (i) help \nbridge the financing gap for the 2018 fiscal year and (ii) incentivize timely implementation of the \npolicy reform actions needed to move toward fiscal sustainability in the long term. The government \nforecasts its financing requirements to be $13.7 million in 2018 (7.3% of GDP) and $21.4 million \nin 2019 (10.9% of GDP). \n \n\n \n\nBudget  support  will  help  insulate  public  spending  from  potential  volatility  in  fishing \nrevenues, minimize drawdowns from the RERF and enable its growth, and allow the government \nto  move  toward  structurally  balanced  budgets  in  the  medium  term.  ADB,  the  governments  of \nAustralia  and  New  Zealand,  and  the  World  Bank  jointly  support  the  implementation  of  these \nreforms, with collaborative cofinancing of $0.36 million (Australia), $2.00 million (New Zealand), \nand $5.00 million (World Bank). Total policy financing of $9.86 million will help finance 71% of the \nrecurrent fiscal deficit. \n \nE. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\nThe  program  is  expected  to  be  implemented  over  29  months  from  November  2016  to \nDecember  2018.  The  implementation  period  for  subprogram  2  is  January  2018  to  December \n2018. The MFED, as executing agency, provided oversight of the implementation of agreed policy \nactions and will be responsible for program administration, disbursements, and maintenance of \nall  records.  The  implementing  agencies  were  the  MFED  and  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  and \nSustainable  Energy.  ADB  and  other  partners  will  continue  to  assist  the  government  in \naccomplishing  the  policy  actions. ADB  will  disburse  the  grant  proceeds  following  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  will  undertake  progress \nmonitoring through the joint ERT. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n\nSafeguards.  The  program  is  classified  category  C  for  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change \nDepartment has reviewed the environmental and social implications of the program outputs and \nactions, and no activity will result in or lead to any physical works or infrastructure. The program \nwill therefore not cause any involuntary resettlement and environmental impacts. No distinct and \nvulnerable groups of indigenous peoples will be affected. \n \n\n \n\nThe focus on improving the management of public finances, assets, and liabilities along \nwith strong SOE reform will benefit the poor and vulnerable in Kiribati directly by improving public \nservices; and indirectly by enabling the government to better develop and implement its budget, \ninclusive of social programs. Improved financial management can free up resources that will allow \nthe government to better respond to external shocks, increase allocations to social sectors, and \nindirectly enable private sector job creation. \n \n\n \n\nGovernance.  Promoting  good  governance  is  a  key  national  priority.  The  2010  Public \nFinancial  Management  Performance  Report  identified  relative  strengths  in  Kiribati\u2019s  PFM.  The \nreport also highlighted weaknesses, such as in oversight of aggregate fiscal risk from other public \nsector  entities;  multiyear  perspective  in  fiscal  planning;  recording  and  management  of  cash \nbalances, debt, and guarantees; and competition, value for money, and controls in procurement.22 \nThrough  the  reforms  under  subprograms  1  and  2,  the  government  made  steady  progress  in \n                                                \n22 Government of Kiribati.
