The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) to support implementation of program \nreforms, and if the Board approves the program, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, will approve the TA. \n \nThe  program  aims  to  strengthen  public  resource  management  in  Tajikistan  through \n2. \nimproved tax policy and administration, more effective and efficient social safety net programs, \nand improved public financial management.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nTajikistan recovered from the economic impacts of the global financial crisis, supported \n3. \nby  (i)  the  Government  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  anti-crisis  program;2 (ii)  a  rebound  in  remittances  (18% \nyear-on-year in 2010) resulting principally from the economic upturn in the Russian Federation; \nand (iii) higher global prices for aluminum and cotton, which represented 83% of total exports in \n2010. However, while the real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate for 2010 was 6.5%\u2014\nan increase from 3.4% in 2009\u2014it is still below the 7.4% average growth experienced in 2005\u2013\n2008 (Table 1). Recovery continues to be affected by tighter credit to the private sector  due to \ngrowing  stress  in  the  banking  system, 3 and  the  recent  hike  in  imported  food  prices.  These \nfactors are likely to continue restraining real GDP growth in 2011  (forecast at 5.5%)  and 2012 \n(forecast  at  6.0%).  Recovery  also  remains  dependent  on  sustained  economic  recovery  in  the \nRussian  Federation,  based  on  Tajikistan\u2019s  reliance  on  trade  and  remittance  inflows.  (See  the \neconomic and financial analysis and country economic indicators).4 \n \n4. \nIncreases in salaries and pensions and higher international commodity prices are expected \nto  keep  inflation  levels  high  (10.0%  estimated  for  2011,  close  to  the  9.8%  figure  of  2010). 5 \nUnemployment also remains high (11.5% in 2009), and close to 1 million Tajiks, or about 40% of the \nworkforce, work abroad.6 Remittances from migrant workers are the main source of income of many \nfamilies,  averaging  41.1%  of  GDP  in  2005\u20132009.  Tajikistan  remains  the  poorest  country  in  the \nCommonwealth  of  Independent  States,  with  the  lowest  per  capita  GDP  ($1,900  in  2009)  and  the \nlowest  per  capita  social  expenditures.  The  weak  social  protection  system  offers  limited  social \nassistance  benefits  with  little  impact  on  poverty.  Fiscal  spending  on  social  assistance  (0.5%  of \nGDP) is the lowest in Central Asia.7 Although declining steadily since 1999, poverty remains high, \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Following a fiscal plan, approved in April 2009, to limit the impact of the global financial crisis, the government has \nbeen  using  fiscal  policy  to  stabilize  the  macroeconomic  situation,  promote  job  creation,  and  sustain  social \nprograms that protect the most vulnerable social groups. \n\n3   While the government\u2019s decision to write off nearly $500 million of outstanding cotton credits that were hindering \nthe  banking  sector  reduced  the  rate  of  nonperforming  loans  from  28%  by  the  end  of  2009,  nonperforming  loans \nremain high, at about 18% in 2010. \n\n4   Economic  and  Financial  Analysis  and  Country  Economic  Indicators  (accessible  from  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n5  The 2011 and 2012 figures for GDP, inflation, and current account balance are staff\u2019s preliminary forecasts for the \n\nforthcoming Asian Development Outlook 2011. \n\n6   The  labor  migration  of  (mostly)  men  leads  to  an  increase  in  households  headed  by  women,  which  results  in \n\nchanges in gender roles. Women are increasingly dependent on state subsidies. \n7   World Bank. 2009. Republic of Tajikistan: Poverty Assessment. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\fespecially  in  isolated  rural  and  mountainous  areas,  where  about  70%  of  the  people  are  poor.  In \n2007,  53%  of  the  country\u2019s  population  was  living  below  the  poverty  line  of  $41  per  month,  down \nfrom 64% in 2003 and 83% in 1999.8 \n \nIncreasing  tax  revenue  during  2005\u20132008  enabled  the  government  to  increase  social \n5. \nexpenditures.  However,  the  global  financial  crisis  resulted  in  a  stall  in  GDP  growth  and  a \ndecrease  in  tax  revenues.  To  help  maintain  critical  social  expenditures,  ADB  provided  a  $40 \nmillion  grant  to  Tajikistan  in  2009,9 and  other  development  partners  provided  grants  for  the \nsame purpose in 2009 and 2010. \n\n Item \nNominal GDP (TJS million) \n  Annual real GDP growth (%) \nTax revenues (TJS million) \n\n   as % of GDP \n\nTotal gov\u2019t expenditures  \n(TJS million)  \nTotal social expenditures  \n(TJS million)  \n\n \nTable 1: Tajikistan Statistics \n2006 \n9,272 \n7.0 \n1,533 \n16.5 \n2,127 \n\n2008 \n17,609 \n7.9 \n3,289 \n18.7 \n4,937 \n\n2007 \n12,780 \n7.8 \n2,274 \n17.8 \n3,661 \n\n2009 \n20,623 \n3.4 \n3,635 \n17.6 \n5,898 \n\n2005 \n7,201 \n6.7 \n1,439 \n16.6 \n1,713 \n\n2010 \n24,705 \n6.5 \n4,447 \n18.0 \n6,652 \n\n2011a \n30,180 \n\u2026 \n5,496 \n18.2 \n8,594 \n\n2012a \n36,650 \n\u2026 \n6,900 \n18.8 \n9,536 \n\n2013a \n44,790 \n\u2026 \n8,491 \n19.0 \n10,624 \n\n605 \n\n751 \n\n958 \n\n1,284 \n\n1,847 \n\n2,351 \n\n3,311 \n\n3,787 \n\n4,627 \n\n   as % of GDP \n   as % of total expenditures \n\n8.4 \n35.3 \n172 \n\n8.1 \n35.3 \n267 \n\n7.5 \n26.2 \n287 \n\n7.3 \n26.0 \n564 \n\n9.0 \n31.3 \n603 \n\n9.5 \n35.3 \n698 \n\n11.0 \n38.5 \n809 \n\n10.3 \n39.7 \n1,009 \n\n10.3 \n43.5 \n1,276 \n\n520,443  525,816  529,161 \n45.2 \n\nPension expenditures \n(TJS million) \nTotal number of pensioners \nAvg. monthly pension  \n(year end, TJS) \nPoverty rate (%) \n\u2026 = not available, GDP = gross domestic product. \na  Forecast. \nSources: State Statistics Committee of the Republic of Tajikistan.

Tajikistan: First and Second Review Under the Three-Year Arrangement \nUnder the Extended Credit Facility. Washington, DC. \n\n11 During  1997\u20132009  the  number  of  public  pensioners  increased  by  only  1.0%  (about  6,000  pensioners  in  total). \nHowever,  in  2010\u20132013,  the number  of pensioners  will  increase  by  3.3%  per  year,  from  553,000  to  630,000,  an \neffect of the post-World War II \u2015baby boom\u2016. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fof the fiscal stimulus may jeopardize its positive impact, and (iv) avoid a higher fiscal deficit that \ncould further weaken debt sustainability. \n \n8. \nThe  overall  fiscal  balance  in  2009,  excluding  the  public  investment  program,  was \nmaintained at a close to expected deficit of 0.6% of GDP, despite lower than expected growth. \nFor 2010, the government estimates a 1.0% deficit, due to less than expected revenues, which \nrequired  additional  cuts  in  nonessential  expenditures  until  the  end  of  the  year.  In  2011,  the \ngovernment is planning a deficit not higher than 1.0% of GDP (Table 2). Public debt (including \npublic  guaranteed  debt)  remains  high  at  36.4%.  Net  international  reserves  are  estimated  at \n$447.0 million, providing import cover for only about 1.6 months. 12 The current account deficit in \n2010 is estimated at 3.5% of GDP, a decrease from 4.9% in 2009, but it is expected to increase \nto 4.5% of GDP in 2011 and 5.5% of GDP in 2012. \n \n9. \nFor  many  years,  the  government  has  not  fully  prioritized  the  sectors  being  covered  by \nthe  program,  but  is  now  strongly  committed  to  making  improvements  in  these  areas.  The \nsupport and inducement of a program grant will support the government in implementing long-\nneeded reforms and will provide resources needed to ensure that critical social expenditures are \nincluded in the 2011 and 2012 budgets (Table 2). \n \n\nTable 2: Tajikistan State Budget and Financing Gap for 2011 \n\nAmount ($ million) \n\nItem \n1.

The program \nsupports  implementation  of  the  Tax  Administration  Development  Program  for  2011\u20132015, \napproved  by  the  government  in  2010.  The  Tax  Administration  Development  Program  sets  out \nobjectives,  targets,  and  indicative  costs  of  reforms  for  (i)  functional  reorganization  of  the  Tax \nCommittee  and  its  offices,  (ii)  introducing  performance  management,  (iii)  building  human \nresources  capacity,  and  (iv)  introducing  information  and  communication  technology  in  the  tax \nsystem. Under the first tranche, the government has carried out Tax Code amendments which \n(i)  eliminate  selected  value-added  tax  exemptions  (including  on  medical  services  provided  by \nthe private sector, sales of handicrafts, and air navigation services) and profit tax exemptions on \nthe dividends payable to local enterprises from other local enterprises, (ii) rationalize the rates of \nproperty  tax  by  removing  a  broad  range  of  rates  and  establishing  single  rates  for  various \ncategories of property (commercial, residential, and others), (iii) authorize the Tax Committee to \ndevelop  procedures  for  electronic  submission  of  tax  returns  to  facilitate  taxpayer  compliance \nwith  filing  requirements  and  move  to  a  risk-based  audit  system,  and  (iv) permit  installment \npayments by taxpayers with arrears based on credible financing plans agreed upon between the \nTax  Committee  and  such  taxpayers.  The  Tax  Committee  has  increased  the  number  of \ntaxpayers to be handled by the Large Taxpayers Inspectorate (LTI) by 20% from the baseline of \nDecember 2010 (from 202 taxpayers to 245), with another increase of 20% planned for 2012 as \npart of the agreed reforms under the second tranche.  \n \n14. \nBy August 2012, normative acts will be issued by (i) the Tax Committee to implement the \nTax Code amendments; and (ii) the local governments of at least Dushanbe, Isfara, Khudjand, \nKulyab and Kurgantyube (the five largest cities by population) to implement amendments to the \nTax Code related to property tax. The Tax Committee will set up a technical  working group to \nprovide  operational  advice  on  tax  reforms.

Consultative  processes  with  key  stakeholders,  including \nprofessional  women  and  representatives  of  the  business  community,  will  be  established  to \ndevelop and fine tune tax system simplification and reform proposals.18 \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput  2:  Social  Safety  Net  Pilots  Designed,  Implemented,  and  Evaluated \nby the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection  \n\n \n16. \nThe  program  will  support  reforms  aimed  at  improving  the  effectiveness,  efficiency,  and \naccountability of public expenditures in social protection, in particular two new pilot programs that \nthe Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MOLSP) has designed and started implementing. The \nphased implementation of the pilot for noncash-based transactions for pension payments through \nindividual  bank  accounts  has  been  started  in  four  districts  of  Dushanbe  (Firdawsi,  Shomansur, \nSino,  and  Somoni),  and  the  cities  of  Kulyab  and  Kurgantyube.  The  MOLSP  will  conduct  an \nindependent evaluation of the pilot to (i) determine the improvements in efficiency and quality of \nservice  provided  to  pensioners  (including  a gender  analysis  which  assesses  the  impact  on  men \nand  women),  (ii)  determine  the  number  of  ghost  pensioners  identified  and  the  resulting  cost \nsavings,  and  (iii)  identify  gaps  and  develop  recommendations  for  improvement.  Requiring \npensioners  to  use  plastic  cards  is  expected  to  make  payment  of  pensions  more  efficient  and \nreduce  the  average  time  between  release  of  funds  and  the  availability  of  pensions  to \nbeneficiaries from to seven days from thirty under the paper-based system. It is also expected \nto  help  reduce  the  number  of  ghost  pensioners  and  other  system  leakages  (e.g.,  informal \npayments to bank tellers). A second pilot will redesign and improve targeting of social assistance \nand  consolidation  of  social  benefits  (subsidies  for  gas,  electricity  and  child  school  education)  to \napproximately 10,000 households in the Yavan district and the town of Istaravshan. The MOLSP \nwill  also  conduct  an  independent  evaluation  of  the  second  pilot  program,  including  a  gender \nanalysis. Improved targeting of social assistance is expected to help ensure that the benefits are \ngiven  to  those  that  need  it  most.  This  will  help  improve  the  social  safety  net  systems  in \n\n                                                \n18 Development Coordination (accessible from list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n \n\n \n\nTajikistan.

The program will also support the \nenactment  and  implementation  of  a  new  Law  on  Public  Finances  to  unify  the  Medium-Term \nExpenditure Framework with the annual budgeting process. \n \nD. \n \n18. \nThe government has requested a grant of $45 million from the Asian Development Fund \n(ADF).19 The grant size is based on the estimated cost of reforms, the social expenditure needs \nof  the  government,  and  the  availability  of  ADF  resources  for  Tajikistan.  The  government  has \ncommitted  to  spend  approximately  $41  million  of  the  $45  million  grant  on  social  safety  net \nexpenditures (Table 3 and the use of program proceeds).20 \n \nThe grant will be released in two tranches: the $20 million first tranche will be released upon \n19. \ngrant  effectiveness;  the  $25  million  second  tranche  is  expected  to  be  released  in  August  2012, \nsubject  to  compliance  with  the  agreed-upon  conditions.  The  program  design  will  provide  an \nincentive tranche, through which $12 million of the second tranche may be disbursed early if certain \nsecond tranche conditions are complied with by the end of 2011. The incentive tranche is designed \nto  (i)  keep  the  reform  program  on  track  and  reward  efficient  implementation  by  the  government,          \n(ii)  allow  the  government  to  receive  part  of  the  funds  by  the  end  of  2011  for  use  in  2012,  and         \n(iii) facilitate regular review and effective monitoring of the pace and direction of reforms. \n \n\nTable 3: Indicative Use of Program Proceedsa \n(TJS million) \n\nExpenditure Item \nSocial safety nets \nSupport for the cost of reforms \n\n2011b \n94.0 \n2.0 \n96.0 \n20.0 \n\n2012\u20132013b \n\n109.5 \n18.0 \n127.5 \n25.0 \n\nTotal \n203.5 \n20.0 \n223.5  \n45.0 \n\nTotal \nin $ millionc \n\na  The  program  proceeds  will  be  used  to  fund  an  estimated  TJS223.5  million  ($45  million \nequivalent) of the expenditures indicated in the table.

Grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to  pay  for \nitems procured in ADB member countries, other than the items specified in the list of ineligible \nitems21 and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The  proceeds  of  the \nprogram  grant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  simplified \ndisbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  program  grants. 22\n Grant  proceeds \ndisbursed against imports will require a certificate from the government stipulating that the value \nof the total imports of Tajikistan, minus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, \nand imports financed under other official development assistance, is equal to or greater than the \namount of the grant expected to be disbursed during a particular year.  \n \n22. \nThe government will establish a subaccount in the Treasury Single Account (referred to \nas the special account) with the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT). The grant proceeds will be \ncredited into a foreign currency (dollar) account established in the NBT. Counterpart funds will \nbe generated by converting the grant proceeds to somoni using the official exchange rate, and \nsuch  counterpart  funds  will  be  credited  into  the  special  account.  The  crediting  of  the  special \naccount will be done within 5 days of the disbursement of each tranche of the grant. The NBT \nwill  provide  ADB  with  official  notification  that  the  counterpart  funds  generated  from  the  grant \nproceeds  have been  credited  to  the special  account  (including  the  amount  of foreign currency \nconverted, the date of conversion to somoni, the official exchange rate, the date of deposit, the \nname and number  of  the special  account,  and the  deposited  somoni  amount).

Six \nhundred thousand dollars will be funded by the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). \nCofinancing  of  $500,000  will  be  provided  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge \nPartnership Fund and utilized primarily for information and communication technology support to \nthe Tax Committee.23 The monitoring arrangements  built into the TA grant design will assist in \nensuring that use of proceeds on social protection programs remains on track. The government \nwill finance the remaining $25,000 equivalent of the TA cost.24  \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nGovernance \n\n \nA. \n \nTajikistan compares poorly with other countries of the region on accountability, control of \n24. \ncorruption,  government  effectiveness,  and  regulatory  quality.  The  Public  Expenditure  and \nFinancial  Accountability  assessment  completed  in  May  2007 25 highlights  a  number  of  risks, \nparticularly in predictability and control in budget execution, accounting, recording and reporting, \nand  external  audit.26 While  many  of  these  weaknesses  persist,  the  government  continues  to \nundertake  governance  and  public  financial  management  reforms  with  development  partner \nassistance.27 In  recent  years,  important  reforms  have  been  put  in  place  to  (i)  streamline  the \npermits  and  inspection  regimes,  which  is  expected  to  improve  the  business  climate; \n(ii) restructure the government administration and reform pay and incentives in order to promote \na  more  professional  civil  service;  (iii)  strengthen  public  financial  management,  including \nenactment  of  new  laws  on  public  procurement  and  internal  audit,  as  well  as  reform  of  the  tax \nadministration  and  improvements  in  the  budget  process,  all  of  which are expected  to  increase \npublic  accountability  and  transparency;  and  (iv)  improve  public  service  delivery.  Most  of  these \nreforms  are  being  supported  by  development  partners,  including  ADB  (footnote  18).  The \n\n                                                \n23 The funding from the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund will be administered by ADB. \n24 Technical Assistance (accessible from list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 World Bank. 2007. Tajikistan: Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment. Washington, DC. \n26 The  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  assessment  gave  Tajikistan  2  As,  4  Bs,  11  Cs,  and  13  Ds, \n\nwith 'A' reflecting high quality and 'D' reflecting need for further improvement. One indicator was not ranked. \n\n27 A  risk-based assessment  of  public  financial  management  (PFM)  conducted  by  ADB  in early  2010  found  that  the \nPFM environment in Tajikistan was extremely weak and there was little evidence of significant improvements in the \nperformance  of  systems  and  institutions  since  the  publication  of  the  2007  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial \nAccountability assessment. \n\n\fprogram design features fiduciary safeguards to mitigate the risks arising from the weaknesses \nin  governance  and  public  financial  management  systems  in  the  country  (Table  5,  and  risk \nassessment and risk management plan).28 \n \n25. \nwith the government. \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nB. \n \n26. \nOver  the  short  term,  the  program  is  designed  to  help  ensure  that  critical  social \nexpenditures  are  maintained.  If  such  expenditures  are  not  made,  poverty  incidence  will  be \nhigher.  Over  the  medium  to  long  term,  improving  tax  policy  and  tax  administration  should \nincrease government revenues. The government is committed to using a substantial portion of \nincremental tax revenues received to increase social expenditures, which is expected to have a \npositive  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  The  program  also  supports  improved  targeting  of  social \nexpenditures,  which  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  because  a  larger  portion  of  such \nexpenditures will be received by the poorest segments of the population. \n \n27. \nTajikistan\u2019s social situation exhibits certain gender inequalities, which are reflected in the \ndelivery  of  social services by  the  social  protection system.  For  example, (i) female  pensioners \nare poorer than male pensioners and depend more on state pensions (women can accumulate \nless  pension  insurance  as  only  14%  of  women  are  in formal  employment  and  women  receive \nless than half of men\u2019s wages on average),29 (ii) households headed by women depend more on \nsocial  benefits  (11%  of  household  income  comes  from  social  benefits,  compared  to  4%  in \nhouseholds  headed  by  men),30 and  (iii)  women  pensioners  make  up  a  majority  of  pensioners \n(56.3% in 2005).31 Women are often not aware of their rights under the social protection system. \nWomen in Tajikistan mostly live in households headed by men and thus receive social benefits \nthrough  the  registered  household  head.  This  dependence  on  the  male  household  head \nbecomes  a  constraint  when  male  migrant  workers  leave  behind  their  wives,  sisters,  and \nmothers,  who  then  receive  social  benefits  only  through  the  registered  name  of  their  male \nrelatives.  Moreover,  it  is  difficult  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  gender  impacts  of  the  social \nbenefits system as sex-disaggregated indicators do not exist. \n \n28. \nThe  program  will  seek  to  address  some  of  these  challenges.  First,  the  Tax  Committee \nwill  approve  a  policy  to  train  all  women  professional  and  support  staff  in  the  LTI.  This  should \nimprove their chance for career progression in an agency which has very few women at senior \nlevels.  Second,  at  least  20%  of  the  members  of  the  Business  Consultative  Group  will  be \nwomen. Third,  the gender  impact  of  the two pilot  social  service delivery  projects  supported  by \nthe program will be analyzed, and recommendations will be made to ensure that gender issues \nare taken into account during project expansion. \n\n \n \n\n                                                \n28 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan, Use of Program Proceeds, and Flow of Funds Under the Program \n\nGrant (accessible from list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n29 United  Nations  Development  Fund  for Women.  2007.
