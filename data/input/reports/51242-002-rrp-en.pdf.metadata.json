The report also describes the proposed administration of two grants: one \nto be provided by the Asia Investment Facility financed by the European Union and the other by \nthe Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR), and if the Board approves the proposed loan and \ngrant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of \nboth grants.1  \n \n2. \nThe project will target areas that are vulnerable to climate and disaster risk (CDR) and will \nfollow a phased, cluster approach, grouping vulnerable townships in the same area. The project \nhas identified clusters of 17 poor townships in regions exposed to CDR using climate projections \nand 2014 census data.2 It will benefit about 1.8 million people in 2,942 villages in Ayeyarwady, \nChin, Sagaing, and Tanintharyi Regions. The project will support the Government of Myanmar in \nstrengthening its community-based development (CBD) policies and procedures. It will strengthen \ncommunity  resilience  and  reduce  the  food  insecurity  and  poverty  of  rural  people  living \nin vulnerable  areas,  by  building  their  capacity  and  providing  resources to  invest  sustainably  in \nclimate- and disaster-resilient and market-oriented infrastructure and livelihoods.3  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \nCountry context. Myanmar is undergoing rapid change. Since 2011, the government has \n3. \nbeen  pursuing  wide-ranging  economic,  social,  political,  and governance  reforms.  New  policies \nand  strategies  are  being  implemented  to  address  development  challenges,  including  rural \ndevelopment,  education  reform,  and  food  security  and  nutrition.  Myanmar\u2019s  gross  domestic \nproduct  grew  by  6.2%  in  2018  and  is  projected  to  continue  growing  rapidly,  reaching  6.6%  in \n2019.4  \n \n4. \nPoverty  remains  high  in  rural  areas.  Myanmar  is  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in \nSoutheast Asia. Poverty was estimated at 32.1% in 2015, down from 48.2% in 2004, with 84% of \nthe poor living in rural areas. 5 Malnutrition rates are among the highest in the region. Twenty-nine \npercent of children under the age of five are stunted and 18.9% are underweight.6 The poor have \nlow levels of human capital and tend to be highly exposed to various CDR-related shocks and \nstresses. 7 The rural poor rely on agriculture and casual labor for their livelihood.  \n \n5. \nRural  development.  Myanmar\u2019s  rural  areas  are  underdeveloped:  (i) only  16%  of  rural \npeople have access to electricity through the public grid, (ii) nearly three out of 10 lack access to \nyear-round improved drinking water, (iii) one out of four lacks access to improved sanitation, and \n\n                                                           \n1  The Asia Investment Facility grant is financed by the European Union. The JFPR grant is financed by the Government \n\nof Japan. Both grants will be fully administered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n2   Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n3   ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance.

New York. \n\nUpdate. New York. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n(iv) a fourth of the rural population is not connected by any road. Agriculture, which accounts for \n25.7% of the gross domestic product and about 49% of employment, is the main source of rural \nlivelihoods.8 Key agriculture sector constraints include (i) limited public spending, resulting in gaps \nin rural infrastructure and human development; (ii) limited access to finance, inputs, and better \ntechnologies; (iii) high exposure and vulnerability to CDR; and (iv) limited institutional capacity. \n \n6. \nHigh risk to disasters and climate change. Myanmar ranks among the highest in the \n2017 Global Climate Risk Index. 9  Almost the entire country is prone to a range of natural hazards. \nHigh exposure in hazard-prone areas, livelihood dependency on climate-sensitive sectors, and \nlow capacity to identify and reduce risks negatively impact the poor. Resilience-building measures \ncan support communities, including women, in resisting, absorbing, adapting to, and recovering \nfrom climate- and disaster-related shocks and stresses, thereby reducing the risk of CDR-induced \nintergenerational transfer of poverty. Climate conditions are projected to change dramatically, and \nvulnerability  in  agriculture,  water  resources,  public  health,  forestry,  and  coastal  systems  is \nexpected to increase (footnote 2).  \n \nLimited  institutional  capacity.  Myanmar  has  a  legacy  of  centralized  decision-making \n7. \nand administrative processes. Limited technical and administrative capacity is an issue, especially \nin  townships.  Myanmar\u2019s  development  paradigm,  however,  recognizes  the  important  role  of \ncommunities, as evidenced by the recent formalization of participatory village development plan \n(VDP) processes.10   \n \n8. \nCommunity-based development effectively strengthens resilience. CBD approaches \nare  an  effective  tool  for  bringing  communities  to  the  forefront  of  poverty  reduction  and \ndevelopment, allowing them to manage resources directly through block grants to identify, design, \nand  implement  solutions  that  address  their  infrastructure  and  livelihood  needs.  Evidence  from \nCBD  projects  indicates  an  improvement  in  incomes  and  well-being,  including  increases  in  per \ncapita consumption, greater use of basic services, and higher school participation. Indonesia\u2019s \nexperience showed a 9.2% increase in the likelihood of poor households moving out of poverty \ncompared with areas without CBD.11 The costs of works are generally lower than those of works \nbuilt by contractors for the same type and quality, with cost savings ranging from 8.0% to 76.0% \ndepending on the project type.12 A recent study of CBD projects in Myanmar also indicates that \ntheir economic benefits significantly exceed the costs.13 With CDR impacts felt most locally, CBD\u2019s \nparticipatory  approaches  allow  the  identification of  localized  risks,  their  historical  patterns,  and \nobserved  changes;  and  assessment  of  the  exposure  of  people,  assets,  and  livelihoods.  Since \n2011, the Department of Rural Development (DRD) has led the implementation of CBD projects \nfor a total amount of $685 million, supporting 8.8 million people in 237 townships.14 \n \n\n                                                           \n8  World Bank. 2018.

The  experience  of  the  Asian \n9. \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in CBD in Myanmar and in the region, especially in the Philippines, and \nlearning  from  the  CBD  projects  of  other  development  partners  informed  the  project  design \n(footnote  11).  Key  lessons  include  (i) aligning  with  government  community  planning  systems; \n(ii) applying  an  integrated  mix  of  rural  infrastructure,  livelihoods,  and  capacity  building; \n(iii) allocating  sufficient  resources  and  time  for  community  engagement  and  mobilization; \n(iv) timely  provision  of  information  on  CDR  and  market  opportunities  for  community  planning; \n(v) improving  the  participation  and  empowerment  of  women  and  the  poor  through  increased \nfacilitation  support;  (vi) ensuring  that  community  infrastructure  subprojects  are  built  to  higher \nstandards  of  resilience,  include  a  sustainable  operations  and  maintenance  plan,  and  are  of  a \nscale that improves economic outcomes; and (vii) promoting livelihood resilience by diversifying \nsources of income, building technical and vocational skills, and linking communities to markets \nand  service  providers.  The  project  will  follow  a  conflict-sensitive  approach  and  will  create \nsynergies and links with ongoing and planned ADB operations to generate greater impact.15 The \ntechnical assistance for Strengthening Climate and Disaster Resilience of Myanmar Communities \nwill provide CDR modeling information and climate forecasts (footnote 15).  \n \n10. \nStrategic  fit.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  Myanmar  Sustainable  Development  Plan, \n2018\u20132030; the Agriculture Development Strategy and Investment Plan, 2018\u20132023; the Climate \nSmart Agriculture Strategy; the National Framework for Community Disaster Resilience; the Rural \nDevelopment  Strategic  Framework;  and  ADB\u2019s  Myanmar  country  partnership  strategy,  2017\u2013\n2021. The project directly supports four of the seven operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \n(Table 1).16  \n \n\nStrategy 2030 Priority \n\nAddressing remaining \npoverty and reducing \ninequalities \n\nTackling climate change \nand disaster resilience, and \nenhancing environmental \nsustainability  \nPromoting rural \ndevelopment and food \nsecurity \nAccelerating progress in \ngender equality \n\nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \n\nProject Interventions \n\nCommunity empowerment to prioritize and implement climate- and disaster-resilient \ninfrastructure investments will reduce risks and stressors that can tip households into \npoverty. Rural livelihood interventions will (i) provide income and employment \nopportunities for the poorest four deciles of communities; and (ii) assist households \nabove the poorest four deciles to adapt their livelihoods to climate and disaster risks. \nThe project will enhance the government\u2019s community-based development processes \nby integrating climate and disaster risk planning into the community-based village \ndevelopment plan process and in infrastructure and livelihood interventions. \n\nInvestment in community infrastructure and livelihoods in remote rural areas will \npromote rural development and food security. Technical support in improving  \nproduction and income-generating activities will contribute to increase food security.  \nThrough the community-based development approach, the project will (i) invest in \nempowering women in their households and communities; (ii) prioritize women\u2019s  \ninfrastructure and livelihood investment needs in subproject selection; and (iii) set \nquotas for women\u2019s engagement in a wide range of project activities. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nB. \n \n11. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  project  is  aligned  with the following  impact:  incomes of rural  households improved \n\n                                                           \n15  ADB. 2016.

The project will have the following outcome: \nstandard of living and resilience of targeted communities improved.17 \n \nC. \n \n12. \nOutput 1: Climate- and disaster-resilient community infrastructure developed. Three \nthousand  climate-  and  disaster-resilient  community  infrastructure  subprojects  will  be  identified \nthrough  a  participatory  VDP  and  funded  through  block  grants.18  Climate  risk  and  vulnerability \nassessments and market opportunity analysis will be made available to communities for their local \nassessment in prioritizing infrastructure investments. Criteria for selection include the contribution \nto resilience and public and economic good benefits.19 Village women will be empowered through \ndedicated  meetings,  and  quotas  for  representation  on  committees  (50%)  and  in  labor  (40%). \nSubprojects with the highest benefit to women will receive a weighting value  up to 20% out of \n100%  during  the  selection  of  eligible  subprojects  to  influence  community  infrastructure \nprioritization. Typical community infrastructures will include  village access or farm roads, small \nbridges, water supply, electric grid connection, and multipurpose centers. The project will finance \nthree multi-phased cycles of community planning and subproject implementation.20 The first cycle \nwill cover all villages in each of the 17 target townships. Subsequent cycles will be performance-\nbased and open to village tracts21 that have achieved a minimum social and infrastructure quality \nassessment review score.22 Each infrastructure investment cycle will amount to MK10 million per \nvillage or a per capita investment of MK30,000 per village person, whichever is higher.  \n \n13. \nOutput 2: Resilient livelihood activities for poor men and women developed. At least \n15,000 resilient  livelihood subprojects  will  be funded through block grants.  As  part  of  the  VDP \nprocess, communities will identify the lowest four deciles of poor and vulnerable households in \ntheir villages using a participatory wealth and vulnerability ranking methodology.23 That cohort will \nbe eligible to apply for livelihood subprojects, valued at up to MK300,000 per household. Targeted \nhouseholds  will  be  enabled  to form  groups  with  a  common  livelihood  interest  and  to  submit  a \nlivelihood  subproject  proposal.  Livelihood  subprojects  could  include  new  or  improved  climate-\nsmart  agriculture,  livestock,  fisheries  activities,  value  addition  to  farm  and  nonfarm  products, \nmarketing,  and  the  acquisition  of  new  skills  for  employment.  The  project  will  assist  interested \ngroups, particularly women and youth, to source vocational training through the Equipping Youth \nfor Employment Project (footnote 15). To ensure sustainability and scale-up, the project will also \nfacilitate,  but  not  fund,  group  access  to  credit  by  linking  to  financial  services,  particularly \nmicrofinance institutions. This output will also provide training to poor households that are above \nthe lowest four deciles of the wealth ranking to adapt to CDR. The project will assist livelihood \ngroups  to  evaluate  the  benefit  of  being  associated  at  township  or  township  cluster  level,  to \nincrease their market power or add scale to their production.  \n \n14. \nOutput 3: Institutional and organizational capacity of communities and government \nstrengthened. The project will support the DRD to develop its VDP process and build its capacity \nto assist villagers. VDPs will be aggregated to establish village tract development plans and to \n\n                                                           \n17 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n18  The conditions for disbursement under block grants are provided in the legal agreements and detailed in the project \n\nadministration manual (PAM) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19  Subproject selection criteria are provided in the legal agreements and detailed in the PAM. \n20 Of the 17 townships, five will be covered under phase 1, six under phase 2, and six under phase 3. \n21 A village tract is a fourth-level administrative subdivision of rural townships.  \n22  Performance criteria are defined in the draft project operations manual, the key guiding document for implementation \n\nat the community level. \n\n23  Communities rank member households into four wealth/vulnerability categories (A to D) based on their assessment \n\nof the households\u2019 assets (land, house, productive assets, and business assets) and CDR vulnerability. \n\n \n\n\f    5 \n\ncontribute to township planning. A DRD training unit will be established, along with associated \ntraining  curricula,  in  the  areas  of  community-based  planning,  resilience  building,  gender, \nleadership,  and  livelihood  development,  among  others.  This  unit  will  train  communities  and \ngovernment  departments,  paying  particular  attention  to  the  development  of  information  and \ncommunication technology training programs. Knowledge centers to promote CDR in agriculture, \nlivestock,  fishery,  and  rural  development  will  also  be  supported.  Support  service  providers  will \nfacilitate implementation at communities\u2019 level. The upgrade of DRD training center will also be \nsupported under this output. \n \n15. \nThe project will include a disaster contingency feature. In the event of a disaster affecting \nan  entire  township,  funds from  the  subsequent  cycle  of  community  subproject  implementation \nmay be advanced for the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure and the recovery of livelihoods, \nbased  on  the  request  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Livestock  and  Irrigation,  and  approval  by \nADB. The  selection  of  infrastructure  and  livelihood  subprojects  will  follow  similar  participatory \nprocesses and criteria as for outputs 1 and 2. \n    \nD. \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n \n\n16. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $243.00  million  (Table  2).  Detailed  cost  estimates  by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).24 \nThe  government  has  requested  (i)  a  concessional  loan  in  the  amount  of  $185.00 million  from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, and (ii) a grant not exceeding $10.00 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources, to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year \nthereafter;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The \ngovernment will finance the equivalent of $17.42 million for the salaries of counterpart staff, and \noffice space. The loan proceeds will mostly be used to provide block grants to communities to \nimplement  infrastructure  and  livelihood  subprojects.  In  addition,  the  Asia  Investment  Facility \n(\u20ac24.25 million  [$27.58  million  equivalent])  and  the  JFPR  ($3.00 million),  will  provide  grant \ncofinancing to be administered by ADB mainly to finance consultants, capacity building and block \ngrants. The summary financing plan is in Table 3. Climate adaptation is estimated to cost about \n$59.54 million. ADB will finance 100% of adaptation costs. Sector lending is proposed to provide \nflexibility and adequate project preparation.25  \n\n \nTable 2: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA.    Base Costa \n       1.

Due  diligence  was  conducted  for  a  wide  range  of  infrastructure  and  livelihood \nsubprojects.26  The  project  team  also used  the  existing  subprojects  under the  Enhancing  Rural \nLivelihoods and Incomes Project as a reference in developing standard drawings (footnote 14).  \n \nThe project outputs were designed based on a robust understanding of the climate change \n19. \nand  disaster  risks  of  the  township  clusters.  The  site  planning  and  design  specifications  for \ninfrastructure  to  be  supported  under  output 1  were  designed  to  reduce  the  potential  impact  of \nCDR on the said infrastructure and the wider community (e.g. embankments above flood levels, \ndrainage structures to provide safe passage, and public buildings built to provide safe refuge in \ndisaster situations). Further, output 2 comprises the dissemination of crop, livestock, and fisheries \ntechnologies, incorporating climate-resilient varieties and good husbandry practices. The uptake \nof new technologies will be strengthened through improved access to technical advice.  \n \nB. \n \n20. \nThe economic and financial analysis was undertaken at the subproject and overall project \nlevels.  At  the  subproject  level,  the  analysis  covered  four  community  infrastructure  subprojects \nunder output 1: lowland and upland roads, water supply, and primary schools. Under output 2, \nthe project will either introduce new livelihood activities or expand their current scale. Thirteen \nlivelihood  activities  were  analyzed,  covering  crop  and  livestock  production,  and  primary \nprocessing.  These  subprojects  were  selected  as  they  were  the  most  commonly  proposed  by \nvillagers during consultations. For all subprojects, the economic internal rates of return  exceed \nthe required 9% threshold and are robust against downside risks. At the overall project level, the \neconomic internal rate of return is estimated to be 17.8% (footnote 26).  \n \n21. \nFinancial and sustainability analysis was conducted to determine the financial viability of \nthe  subprojects.  For  the  community  infrastructure  subprojects,  the  annual  operation  and \nmaintenance costs are about 3.0% of the construction costs. The project will support training in \noperations  and  maintenance  planning  and  execution  in  townships,  village  tracts,  and  villages. \nWhile most of these infrastructure subprojects do not generate direct revenue, they will stimulate \nmarket activities that will generate incremental financial resources for the beneficiaries to finance \nthe  infrastructure\u2019s  upkeep.  For  the  livelihood  subprojects,  preliminary  market  assessments \nindicate sufficient demand for the produce.27 The analysis indicates that the livelihood subprojects \nwill significantly increase farm incomes, and that the returns to family labor are multiples of the \nprevailing daily wage rate. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance  \n\n22. \nAll procurement and recruitment of project-financed consultants will be in accordance with \nthe  ADB  Procurement  Policy  and  the  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as \n\n                                                           \n26  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 During implementation, the proposed livelihood subprojects will be subjected to further market assessments before \n\napproval. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\namended from time to time). The overall procurement classification is moderate. The DRD has \nsubstantial experience in procuring goods and services under ADB projects, and international and \nnational  procurement  specialists  will  support  it  for  more  efficient  delivery.  The  financial \nmanagement risk is substantial given the limited capacity in financial reporting. The project will \nput  in  place  accounting  systems  to  ensure  adequate  financial  records.  Consolidated  project \nfinancial  statements  prepared  by  DRD  will  be  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors \nacceptable to  ADB. The  project  will  disclose  the  implementation  progress  and  bid notifications \nand  their  results  on  the  DRD  website,  and  establish  a  grievance  redress  mechanism.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended from time to time) was explained to and discussed with \nthe government. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in \nthe PAM.  \n \nD. \n \n23. \nThe project is classified targeted intervention\u2014geographic. It will increase the standard of \nliving  of  at  least  80%  of  target  communities  by  20%,  and  raise  the  resilience  of  project \ncommunities  above  the  baseline.28  This  will  be  achieved  by  institutionalizing  community \nparticipation, strengthening the availability and resilience of community infrastructure, improving \naccess to markets, raising household incomes through livelihood investments, and building skills \nand  knowledge  to  address  CDR.  The  project  will  promote  inclusive  economic  growth,  reduce \npoverty, provide rural employment opportunities, and improve market opportunities and access. \nCommunity  infrastructure  construction  will  provide  on-the-job  skills  training,  and  skilled  and \nunskilled  work  opportunities for  communities.  Groups  of  poor  households,  particularly  women-\nheaded households, will be enabled to improve their livelihoods through access to skills training \nand livelihood grants. \n \n24. \nGender. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. Twenty-three percent \nof rural households in the project area are women-headed. The project will support women by \nensuring their meaningful participation and building their capacity to invest sustainably in climate- \nand disaster-resilient infrastructure and livelihoods. A gender equity and social inclusion action \nplan  includes  measures  such  as  (i) empowerment  of  women  in  their  households  and \ncommunities;  (ii) separate  meetings  for  women  during  community  investment  prioritization; \n(iii) targets  for  women\u2019s  participation  in  committees,  meetings,  training,  and  construction; \n(iv) equal pay for women and men for equal work; and (v) training for all participating communities \nand implementing agencies in gender and development.29 The project will pilot test the household \nmethodologies approach to women\u2019s empowerment in their households in  3,000 households.30 \nKey  gender  targets  include  (i) at  least  50%  women\u2019s  participation  in  village  committees;  (ii) at \nleast 40% of unskilled paid works for women in community infrastructure construction; (iii) at least \n40%  of  meeting  participants  are  from  poor,  women-headed,  and  vulnerable  households;  and           \n(iv) fifty percent of women\u2019s infrastructure subproject priorities implemented. \n \n25. \nConflict-sensitive  approach.  The  project  adopts  a  conflict-sensitive  approach  that \npromotes  a  good  understanding  of  the  local  context,  builds  in  flexibility  in  design  and \nimplementation, and establishes strong local ownership. The project will ensure: (i) robust social \npreparation  and  awareness  raising  activities  that  reach  out  to  all  villagers,  especially  the \nvulnerable, women and ethnic groups and secure their participation; (ii) informed decision making \non  community  infrastructure  and  livelihood  investments  based  on  a  good  understanding  of  all \n\n                                                           \n28  Standard of living will be proxied by the asset index which is based on the valuation of household mobile and immobile \n\nassets and net income. \n\n29  Gender Equity and Social Inclusion Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n30  International Fund for Agricultural Development. 2018.

The project is expected to achieve significant socioeconomic \n27. \nbenefits \nlivelihood \nimprovements.  The  small-scale  community  infrastructure  subprojects  are  anticipated  to  have \nminimal or minor adverse environmental impacts. These impacts will be limited to the construction \nperiod, will be localized and reversible, and can be mitigated through good construction practices \nand standard mitigation measures. An environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) \nprepared  for  the  project  identifies  subproject  eligibility  criteria;  defines  procedures  and \nresponsibilities for environmental screening and assessment of subprojects, grievance redress \nmechanism, and meaningful public consultation; and specifies the supervision, monitoring, and \nreporting requirements.32 The EARF also includes Environmental Codes of Practice and a generic \nenvironmental management plan to mitigate the anticipated environmental impacts. The DRD will \nhave the main responsibility for EARF implementation and will assign qualified staff in the Project \nManagement Unit, which will be supported by international and national environmental safeguard \nconsultants.  The  DRD  will  submit  semiannual  environmental  safeguard  reports  to  ADB  for \ndisclosure.   \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). A community participation framework (CPF) has \n28. \nbeen developed. Subproject screening and selection criteria will identify and reject any subproject \nrequiring involuntary resettlement and compulsory acquisition.33 Investments in village roads and \nwater supply schemes may require minor land use reallocation. In these cases, the project will \npursue  voluntary  donation.  The  CPF  includes  a  due  diligence  procedure  to  verify  voluntary \ndonation bona fides through a third party, and this will be used to screen and select subprojects \nduring implementation.34 The CPF will be used to conduct social safeguards assessments of all \nsubprojects.  \n \nIndigenous  peoples  (category B).  Ethnic  groups  live  in  most  project  townships.35  In \n29. \nsome areas, ethnic groups reside within or outside ancestral domains. The project is assessed \ncategory B  and  an  ethnic  group  development  framework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  the \nscreening  of  each  subproject  for  possible  ethnic  group  impacts  and  to  ensure  inclusiveness, \nconsultation, and participation as needed. Subprojects with negative impacts on ethnic groups \nwill not be funded.36  \n \nGrievance redress mechanism. Within 6 months of project effectiveness, a safeguards \n30. \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  established  by  the  government  in \naccordance with the EARF, the ethnic group development framework, and the CPF. Adequate \nresources  will  be  allocated  to  the  screening,  preparation,  implementation,  monitoring,  and \nreporting of social and environmental safeguards; and associated capacity development.  \n\n                                                           \n31  ADB.
