This component focuses on \ndeveloping national HIV/AIDS surveillance capacity, with a \nfocus  on  developing  methodologies  and  skills  for \nconducting  second-generation  surveys  to  better \nunderstand the status of and risk factors governing HIV \ninfection and prevention among high-risk subpopulations \nacross  the  region.  The  activities  will  focus  mainly  on \nbuilding capacity so that the countries and the region can \nmobilize  and  target  resources  to  curb  growing  rates  of \ninfection. \n(ii)  Community-based  interventions  for  HIV/AIDS \nprevention.  This  component  will  provide  support  for  a \nregional condom social marketing program, including the \ndesign  and  delivery  of  mass  media  and  targeted \ncommunication programs promoting condom use and the \nsupply of male and female condoms; for behavior change \ncommunication  (BCC)  programs,  including  the \ndevelopment of tailored BCC materials and the design and \ndelivery  of  BCC  programs;  and  for  sexually  transmitted \ninfection (STI) treatment and care programs, including the \nprovision of training for local health care workers and of \nequipment and materials for STI treatment facilities. \n  (iii)  Targeted  interventions  for  vulnerable  groups.  This \ncomponent focuses on supporting targeted interventions \nfor vulnerable populations in the project Pacific developing  ", "ii   \n \n  member countries (PDMCs), including (a) establishing five \ndrop-in centers for seafarers and their communities with \ninformation  about  HIV/AIDS,  STIs,  and  safe  sex  and \nreferrals  to  appropriate  services;  (b)  developing  and \ndistributing  information,  education,  and  communication \nmaterials  for  vulnerable  groups;  (c)  providing  targeted \ntraining  for  nongovernment  organizations  working  with \nvulnerable  groups;  (d)  providing  support  for  regional \nmaritime schools in training on HIV/AIDS and STIs; (e) \nproviding  training  in  enhancing  livelihood  skills  for  HIV-\npositive people; and (f) providing antiretroviral  drugs for \nHIV-positive people. \n(iv)  Project management. This component will manage the \nProject  and  includes  project  planning,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation. \n   \nRationale  The potential for the spread of HIV/AIDS in the Pacific is high. All \nPDMCs have detected HIV infections and also have unreported \nand unidentified cases because of the lack of testing facilities and \ngenerally low levels of surveillance. Significant risk factors for HIV \nexist, including high prevalence of STIs, low condom use, high \nlevels  of  interregional  and  intraregional  mobility,  prevalence  of \nmultiple sex partners, and high rates of transactional sex. The \nregion has experienced highly disparate levels of development, \nresulting in variable levels of access to information and services. \nSome Pacific countries have poorly functioning health systems \nwith weak capacity to operate safe blood supplies, treat STIs, \nprovide  counseling  and  testing,  and  prevent  mother-to-child \ntransmission. \n \nThe  socioeconomic  impacts  of  the  HIV/AIDS  epidemic  are \npotentially  significant.  Social  impacts  include  the  pain  and \nsuffering of individuals and communities affected by the illness \nand the death of family members. At the household and individual \nlevels,  economic  impacts  include  decreased  discretionary \nspending by households affected by loss of income together with \nincreased expenditure on care, treatment, and funerals. Economic \nimpacts arise from productive sector losses and from the added \nburden on the health sector. HIV/AIDS exacerbates poverty by \nlimiting  the  opportunities  of  the  poor  to  lift  themselves  out  of \npoverty and by driving economically vulnerable people below the \npoverty line.  \n \n  The current response to HIV/AIDS in the Pacific is underfunded. \nPacific governments have committed to a comprehensive regional \nstrategy and various programs are under way. Existing efforts \nurgently need to be scaled up and extended. \n   \n ", "  iii\nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project will be to reduce the spread and impact \nof HIV/AIDS in the Pacific. The outcome of the Project will be \nimproved  management  and  delivery  of  HIV/AIDS  prevention \nactivities  in  the  Pacific  through  the  targeting  of  vulnerable \npopulations. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is estimated at $8.0 million equivalent. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a grant of $8.0 \nmillion equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to finance \nthe Project. \n   \nGrant Amount and Terms  A grant of $8.0 million will be provided to SPC from the Special \nFunds resources of ADB (Asian Development Fund IX Grants \nProgram) with terms and conditions substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  SPC  is  an  international  organization,  founded  by  an \nintergovernmental treaty, that serves 22 Pacific island countries. \nSPC  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  Project.  SPC  will \nestablish a Project Steering Committee. The Steering Committee \nwill  include  representatives  from  key  stakeholder  organizations \nwith expertise in HIV/AIDS in the Pacific, including project PDMC \ngovernments,  civil  society  organizations,  people  living  with \nHIV/AIDS, development partners, SPC, and ADB. \n   \nImplementation  SPC will implement the Project. \nArrangements \n   \nProcurement  ADB-financed  goods  and  related  services  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  the  Guidelines  for  Procurement  under  ADB \nLoans. A package of equipment and medical supplies estimated \nat more than $100,000 will be procured by international shopping, \nand  by  direct  purchase  for  a  package  estimated  at  less  than \n$100,000.  SPC  as  the  executing  agency  will  manage  the \nprocurement of equipment and medical supplies. \n   \n ", "iv   \n \nConsulting Services  Conducting the specialized activities described for all four project \ncomponents  will  require  221  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services  and  161  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting  services.  The  consultants  will  provide  assistance  to \nSPC in the areas of surveillance, information and communications \ntechnology, condom social marketing, BCC, HIV prevention, peer \neducation, STI case management, project management, seafarer \nsupport, and nongovernment organization support. Selection and \nengagement  of  consultant  services  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of \ndomestic consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  Direct beneficiaries of the Project include (i) people who do not \nBeneficiaries  become infected with HIV and their families and communities; (ii) \npeople  living  with  HIV/AIDS  who  have  access  to  antiretroviral \ntreatment and improved livelihood skill development; (iii) regional \nand country-level institutions and actors that will have adequate \nresources  (tools,  equipment,  and  information)  to  sustain  their \nHIV/AIDS prevention activities; (iv) health systems in the PDMCs \nthat will be relieved of the burden of an increased epidemic; and \n(v) national economies. \n \nThe Project will result in lower HIV infection rates and will benefit \nthose who would have been infected had they not been educated \nabout the likelihood of infection from risk-taking behaviors and had \nbeen  unable  to  choose  to  modify  this  behavior  accordingly \nbecause of lack of access to information, voluntary confidential \ncounseling and testing, and condoms. \n \nThe Project will generate considerable national economic benefits \nas  a  result  of  a  decrease  in  disease  prevalence  and  the \nmaintenance  of  low  prevalence  levels  of  HIV  infection.  The \nregion\u2019s health systems will avoid or minimize the impact of an \nHIV/AIDS epidemic and be able to apply health sector resources \nto other health priorities. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  Project risks fall into four categories: (i) financial, (ii) technical, (iii) \ninstitutional, and (iv) social. \n \nThe key financial risk is that the Project is supporting a much \nlarger coordinated regional effort that depends on the continuing \nsupport, both financial and political, of the relevant governments, \ndevelopment partners, and civil society actors. \n \nThe main technical risks exist in the levels of absorptive capacity \nat country level to implement community-level activities effectively. \nThis risk is moderate and is mitigated by the considerable focus in \nthe Pacific regional strategy on developing government and civil \nsociety capacity. \n \n ", "  v\n  The institutional risk is that SPC may not be able to effectively \nmanage  the  Project  in  addition  to  its  other  HIV/AIDS  project \nresponsibilities and to retain its human resource capability and \nexpertise. \n \nThe key social risk for the Project is that project impacts rely on \npeople changing their sexual behavior. Project outputs will provide \ninformation, education, and condoms to affect behavior change \nunder  the  assumption  that  determinants  of  sexual  behavior \noutside the control of the Project remain favorable or neutral. \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) for the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Capacity \nDevelopment in the Pacific Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Background \n2.  HIV/AIDS is a real and present threat to Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs). \nOnce HIV makes its way into the tiny populations in the Pacific islands, diffuse epidemics are \nlikely to follow.1 The Pacific region is characterized by acute vulnerability to external shocks. \nWeak economies, rapidly changing social norms, and the uneasy coexistence of traditional and \nmodern  cultures  have  led  to  an  increase  in  social  problems.  Social  and  economic \nmarginalization has increased. Conflict and insecurity have also become more common in the \nregion in the past decade. Prevention strategies that minimize the risk of HIV infection and that \nreduce and treat STIs are urgently needed. \n \n3.  The  potential  for  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  is  high.  All  PDMCs  have  detected  HIV \ninfections. In Papua New Guinea (PNG),2 the epidemic is now in the general population. There \nare certainly unreported and unidentified cases because of the lack of testing facilities and the \ngenerally low levels of surveillance. \n \n4.  Significant risk factors for HIV exist, including the high prevalence of STIs; the low level \nof condom use, the high levels of interregional and intraregional mobility, cultural practices such \nas taboos on frank discussion of sexual issues; the practices of tattooing, polygamy, and \nmultiple sex partners; and the high rates of transactional sex. Pacific cultures are typically \nconservative, and intolerance and misunderstanding may marginalize affected or vulnerable \nindividuals and isolate them from information and services that reduce risk and vulnerability. \n \n5.  The Pacific region has experienced highly disparate levels of development, resulting in \nvariable  levels  of  access  to  information  and  services.  Some  Pacific  countries  have  poorly \nfunctioning  health  systems  with  weak  capacity  to  operate  safe  blood  supplies,  treat  STIs, \nprovide counseling and testing, and prevent mother-to-child transmission. \n \n6.  The socioeconomic impacts of the HIV/AIDS epidemic are potentially significant. Social \nimpacts include the pain and suffering of individuals and communities affected by the illness and \ndeath of family members, the children who lose parents and are left without someone to love \nand  raise  them,  the  increased  social  exclusion  of  those  affected  by  intolerance  and \nstigmatization, and the rupture of community and societal bonds. At household and individual \nlevels, economic impacts include decreased discretionary spending by households affected by \nincome loss together with increased expenditure on care, treatment, and funerals. Economic \nimpacts are to be expected from productive sector losses in such countries as Kiribati and \nTuvalu, where the earnings of seafarers, a particularly high-risk population, account for 25% of \n                                                 \n1  Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. 2004. AIDS Epidemic Update 2004. Geneva. \n2  It is proposed that PNG will receive Asian Development Bank support for fighting HIV/AIDS in a separate project. ", "2   \ngross domestic product. HIV/AIDS exacerbates poverty by limiting the opportunities of the poor \nto lift themselves out of poverty. \n \n7.  The impact on health sectors of an increase in HIV/AIDS will be significant. Pacific \nhealth systems are already facing a double burden of prevention and treatment of persistent, \ntraditional infectious ailments along with a rising tide of new \u201clifestyle\u201d diseases, and have little \nscope for dealing with HIV/AIDS. Even a low-level epidemic would divert resources from other \nhealth priorities to accommodate demand for tertiary care facilities and the costs associated with \nminimizing risks to health care workers. Appendix 1 presents the sector analysis. \n \n2.  Status of the Epidemic \n8.  Since HIV was first reported in a Pacific island country in 1984, more than 11,000 cases \nhave been detected. Table 1 presents the current situation in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s) PDMCs. Because of low levels of surveillance, actual prevalence rates are likely to be \nhigher than official figures indicate. ADB considers it likely that under-reporting in the region is \nconsiderable, possibly by a factor of 10.3\n \nTable 1.

In the Pacific region, HIV/AIDS is predominantly a sexually transmitted disease. While \nheterosexual  transmission  is  most  common,  there  are  documented  cases  of  transmission \nbetween men who have sex with men (MSM), injecting drug users and from mother to child. \nVulnerable groups include young people; women; prisoners; prison officers; police officers; \nmobile  populations,  such  as  seafarers,  fishermen,  government  officials,  students  studying \nabroad, members of the armed forces, international peacekeepers; and the sexual partners of \nthese people. \n \n10.  The situation in PNG is especially serious. Unlike in the rest of the Pacific, PNG is \nexperiencing a generalized epidemic with an estimated 75,000 people now living with HIV, with \nthe number doubling every 2 years. The nature and scale of the response required in PNG is \nfundamentally different to that required in the low-prevalence PDMCs. ADB has been providing \nsupport in the health sector in PNG for some years and is currently responding to a request \nfrom the Government of PNG to provide a grant for a project to prevent and control the spread \nof the disease in rural areas. For these reasons, PNG is not included in the current Project. \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2005.

Pacific Regional Strategy on HIV/AIDS 2004\u20132008 \n11.  Governments, key civil society organizations, and development partners recognize the \nPacific  Regional  Strategy  (PRS)  on  HIV/AIDS  2004\u20132008  as  the  umbrella  framework  for \nHIV/AIDS activities in the Pacific. The PRS followed the first regional strategy for 1997\u22122000 on \nAIDS and STIs, endorsed in 1998, that aimed to provide a broad framework within which \nregional stakeholders would be encouraged to address HIV/AIDS and STIs. The PRS was \ndeveloped through an extensive consultative process that took into consideration the unique \nfeatures of the Pacific region and issues related to HIV/AIDS, including lessons learned from \ncountries that have successfully halted and reversed the spread of HIV/AIDS. The strategy was \nendorsed by 22 Pacific island countries and territories (PICTs)4 in 2004, and responsibility for \ndeveloping the PRS implementation plan (PRSIP) was given to SPC. The PRSIP is under \ndevelopment and was to be considered by the Pacific Forum Leaders Group in October 2005. A \ndescription of the strategy and implementation plan is presented in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  The PRS will support national efforts to prevent and control HIV/AIDS and STIs and \nstrengthen  work  at  the  regional  level  through  improved  coordination,  collaboration,  and \npartnership between regional organizations and national programs. The strategy\u2019s goal is to \nreduce the spread and impact of HIV/AIDS while embracing people infected and affected by the \nvirus in Pacific communities. The PRS is based on principles that acknowledge the traditional, \ncultural, and religious values of the Pacific communities. It affirms the protection and promotion \nof human rights, is based on partnerships and a multisectoral approach, and is sensitive to \ngender differences and the concerns of vulnerable groups. \n \n13.  The strategy aims to increase the capacity of PICTs to achieve and sustain an effective \nand sustainable response to HIV/AIDS; to strengthen coordination of the regional response and \nmobilize resources and expertise to help countries achieve their targets; and to help PICTs \nachieve and report on their national and international targets in response to HIV/AIDS. \n \n14.  The draft PRSIP has been costed at about $15.0 million, and as of June 2005 faced a \nfunding shortfall of about $8.5 million. However, the PRS Working Group, which also worked on \nthe preparation of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM) round 5 \nsubmission, found several program gaps in the draft PRSIP and estimated that the total shortfall \nof funding is considerably higher, even after taking into account the anticipated funding from the \nGFATM round 5 submission from the Pacific. \n \nb.  Secretariat of the Pacific Community \n15.  In 2002, SPC established the HIV/AIDS Unit in its Public Health Program. An HIV/AIDS \nand STI adviser leads activities in this area. A second professional position was added in 2005 \nto help manage the rapidly expanding work program. These two long-term positions are in \naddition to those funded at SPC for specific projects. SPC facilitated the development of the \nPRS and has coordinated efforts to generate resources for implementing it. SPC\u2019s maritime \nprogram has also conducted HIV/AIDS activities aimed at seafarers. \n \n                                                 \n4  American Samoa, Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, French Polynesia, Guam, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States \nof Micronesia, Nauru, New Caledonia, Niue, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Pitcairn, PNG, Samoa, Solomon \nIslands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Wallis and Futuna. \n ", "4   \nc.  United Nations System \n16.  The United Nations agencies present in the Pacific (World Health Organization, United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund, United Nations Population Fund, United Nations Development Fund \nfor Women, International Labor Organization, and United Nations Development Programme) are \ncollectively working with UNAIDS to carry out work on HIV/AIDS from the perspectives of their \ndifferent mandates. Their efforts have included reviewing the sexual abuse and exploitation of \nchildren and developing school curricula (United Nations Children\u2019s Fund); providing support for \nlocal condom social marketing (United Nations Population Fund); reviewing HIV-related legal \nissues (United Nations Development Programme); providing laboratory support, training in the \ntreatment and care of HIV-infected patients, and holding a workshop on second-generation \nsurveillance (World Health Organization); and holding meetings with the police, the military, and \nother occupational groups about workplace policies (International Labor Organization, UNAIDS). \nUNAIDS has used its project acceleration funds for a variety of small projects. In addition, the \nAsia-Pacific Leadership Forum, funded by the Australian Agency for International Development, \nthe  US  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  others,  has  been  working  to  develop \nadvocacy  capacity  among  government,  religious,  private  industry,  and  community  leaders. \nExternal assistance provided to the sector is shown in Appendix 3.  \n \nd.  Pacific Regional HIV/AIDS Project  \n17.  In 2003, the Australian Agency for International Development invested A$12.5 million \nover 5 years in the Pacific Regional HIV/AIDS Project (PRHP), implemented by the Burnet \nInstitute,  International  Development  Support  Services,  and  SPC.  To  date,  this  project  has \nhelped 11 PDMCs5 develop national strategic plans.6 The overall aim is to provide funding to \nimplement  national  plans.  Eight  national  AIDS  commissions  have  been  given  grants,  and \nagencies designated as community development organizations are given funds to become focal \ntraining agencies for smaller local organizations. The latter can compete for multiyear grants to \nimplement programs. There is also a small grants component for funding meetings and other \nsmall  efforts.  In  addition,  through  its  SPC  component,  the  project  has  also  supported  the \ndevelopment and implementation of the PRS. \n \ne.  Franco-Australian Pacific Regional HIV/AIDS and Sexually \nTransmitted Infection Initiative \n18.  Implemented by SPC, this 5-year project brings together the SPC component of the \nAustralian PRHP and a component funded by the Government of France that focuses mainly on \nsurveillance. The budget of approximately \u20ac1.0 million matches Australia\u2019s contribution to SPC. \n \nf.  Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria  \n19.  In 2002, 11 Pacific island countries successfully applied for GFATM round 2,7 receiving a \nmulticountry grant of about $5.0 million, to be implemented and coordinated by SPC. The \nsecond submission from the Pacific region for support from GFATM round 5 covers 14 Pacific \n                                                 \n5 Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Solomon \nIslands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Other non-PDMCs supported include Niue and Tokelau. \n6 The Government of France added funds to this Project to support improved second-generation surveillance in the \nFrench-affiliated territories. Six US-affiliated islands, such as Guam and the Northern Marianas, are included \nthrough funding from the United States. \n7  Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, \nTuvalu, and Vanuatu.  \n ", "      5\nPICTs8 and seeks a total grant of $9.946 million. The submission recognizes the PRS as the \nstrategic framework for national and regional activities throughout the Pacific and has been \nformulated to address specific funding gaps in four high-priority areas: (i) advocating condom \nuse and the distribution and social marketing of condoms, (ii) working intensively with vulnerable \nand high-risk individuals (STI patients, mobile populations, transactional sex workers, men who \nhave sex with men, and their partners); (iii) scaling up voluntary confidential counseling and \ntesting services; and (iv) adopting an aggressive approach toward strengthening STI diagnosis \nand  treatment.  The  submission  acknowledges  that  additional  resources  are  required  for \nimproving surveillance; scaling up access to care, treatment, and support for people living with \nHIV/AIDS; and enhancing care and treatment services. The submission was developed through \na widespread and comprehensive consultative process involving governments; development \npartners; and a broad representation from civil society, including nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs), community-based organizations, and faith-based organizations. The submission has \nabout 40 signatories representing these key stakeholders. \n \ng.  National AIDS Strategies and Action Plans \n20.  As with many public health issues in the Pacific, nearly all HIV/AIDS activities in the \nregion are funded by external agencies, and substantial coordination is required to ensure \noptimum allocation of resources and minimize duplication. Governments and stakeholders have \ndemonstrated their recognition of this by preferring regional approaches for their activities and \nby delegating responsibility for the PRS to SPC. \n \n21.  All PDMCs now have HIV/AIDS strategic plans and national AIDS committees to guide \npolicies and program strategies. Both the plans and the committees are of varying quality and \neffectiveness. Most have been, and still are, receiving support for these efforts from the PRHP. \nHowever, most countries lack the financial and/or human resource capacity to give effect to their \nstrategies, and only a few have translated the plans into actionable and funded programs. While \nthe commitment of Pacific governments to effectively address HIV/AIDS has varied considerably \nto date, all PDMCs have signed on to the PRS and are cosignatories of the GFATM round 5 \nsubmission. The Fiji Islands and PNG have come closest to actualizing their strategies and \nhave allocated budgets to them, and both Kiribati and Tuvalu, with their highly vulnerable \nseafaring  populations,  have  responded  to  the  issue  by  creating  viable  national  AIDS \ncommittees, but for the smaller PDMCs with low prevalence rates, their capacity to mount an \neffective and sustainable response to the epidemic is extremely low. Most ministries of health \nhave limited numbers of staff they can assign to HIV/AIDS activities. Similarly, most of the small \nPDMCs have few civil society actors capable of or interested in addressing what is still often \nregarded as a remote threat. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Surveillance and the Knowledge Base \n22.  Concerns have been identified in relation to the adequacy of HIV and STI surveillance in \nthe region,9 and consequently in relation to the reliability of existing data. For example, surveys \nmay be inappropriate for low-prevalence populations, sample sizes may be inadequate, and \n                                                 \n8  American Samoa, Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, \nNiue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. \n9  2004. Franco-Australian Pacific Regional HIV/AIDS and STI Initiative: Situational and Response Analyses for \nHIV/AIDS and STI Prevention, Control, Care, and Support Services in the Pacific Region in Relation to the \nComponents of the 1997\u20132000 Regional AIDS/STI Strategic Plan.  Noumea, New Caledonia. \n ", "6   \nbehavioral  surveys  may  not  be  covering  the  same  groups  being  surveyed  by  HIV  or  STI \nsurveys. Thus actual prevalence rates are probably higher than officially stated rates.  \n \n23.  The PDMCs have low capacity for HIV and STI surveillance as facilities and technical \ncapacities are inadequate. Good estimates of the number of people vulnerable to infection do \nnot exist. Estimating the course of the epidemic requires knowing the size of populations at risk \nand the overlaps of groups practicing high-risk behaviors. Regular behavioral surveillance and \nsocial science research are necessary to ensure good data. Without a sound knowledge base, \ntargeted programs enabling effective and efficient use of scarce resources cannot be designed. \nSimilarly,  monitoring  and  evaluation  efforts  will  be  ineffective  in  the  absence  of  good \ninformation. \n \n2.  Risk Factors for HIV Transmission \n24.  STI prevalence rates and high rates of teenage pregnancy indicate high levels of risk-\ntaking  behavior  and  low  rates  of  condom  use.  These  are  significant  risk  factors  for  HIV \ntransmission.  Young  people,  particularly  young  women,  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  HIV. \nWomen are physiologically more susceptible to infection from sexual intercourse than men. If \nglobal patterns are followed in the Pacific, at least twice as many young women as young men \nwill contract HIV. Women are subject to abuse and exploitation and are likely to be exposed to \nunprotected and/or unwanted sex. In addition, young people and women are often ignorant of \nways to protect themselves and minimize these risks. \n \n25.  As in other regions, the mobile populations of the Pacific are highly vulnerable to HIV \nand STIs. More than 4,000 people work as seafarers. For small island countries such as Kiribati \nand Tuvalu, seafarers are a significant source of wealth, accounting for more than 25% of the \ngross domestic product of each country. Seafarers are likely to practice high-risk behaviors such \nas alcohol abuse, sexual activity with commercial sex workers, inconsistent use of condoms, \nand multiple sex partners. Coupled with a pre-existing high infection rate of STIs and poor \nknowledge of safe sexual practices, their risk of contracting HIV is high. \n \n26.  HIV/AIDS  awareness  programs  have  been  implemented  through  the  network  of  10 \nmaritime institutions and have been considered effective. Nevertheless, there is a continuing \nrequirement to update the training curricula, materials, and information packages to ensure that \nthe  institutions  retain  the  capacity  to  deliver  effective  prevention  programs  and  reach  the \nmaximum number of seafarers. Some STI and voluntary confidential counseling and testing \nclinics are available that offer various services for seafarers, but access to such services is \nlimited for seafarers\u2019 families, and a holistic approach toward promoting prevention efforts is \nneeded. \n \n27.  Since 2001, STI incidence has increased markedly in the 15\u221244 age group. Capacity \nbuilding in STI diagnosis and treatment is being supported by the GFATM round 2 funds, but a \nfunding gap remains for the provision of skills training, clinical equipment, and supplies. \n \n28.  Condom availability varies greatly across countries. Free distribution from government \nsources is hampered by inadequate supplies, sole designation for family planning clinics, and \nlack of easy access by the unmarried and by men. Where pharmacies or other shops stock \ncondoms,  availability  is  accompanied  by  relatively  high  prices,  and  many  people  still  feel \nembarrassed  purchasing  them.  Rural  areas  have  limited  access.  Even  though  the  United \nNations Population Fund regularly procures condoms for 13 Pacific countries that supply free \ncondoms under family planning or AIDS programs, demand for both male and female condoms \n ", "      7\nis still low. The GFATM HIV/AIDS project has contracted a regional condom social marketing \nNGO, Marie Stopes International, to implement a condom social marketing program initially in \nFiji Islands, Kiribati, Samoa, and Tuvalu, with the possibility of expansion subject to additional \nfunding. \n \n29.  Behavior change communication (BCC) programs have been under way across the \nregion  in  various  forms.  However,  a  significant  unmet  demand  exists  for  producing  and \npromulgating targeted mass media materials. \n \n30.  Opportunities for highly cost-effective interventions to reduce vulnerability and prevent \nthe transmission of HIV in Pacific island communities exist in a number of areas, notably in \nimproving the knowledge base regarding vulnerable groups and conducting better-targeted \nsurveillance, working intensively with vulnerable and high-risk individuals, advocating condom \nuse and condom distribution and social marketing, enhancing BCC, and strengthening STI \ndiagnosis and treatment. \n \n3.  Care and Treatment for HIV-Positive People \n31.  While there are HIV-positive people in all PDMCs, not all have access to care and \ntreatment. Antiretroviral (ARV) drug treatment is being funded under GFATM round 2, which is \nestablishing a regional procurement mechanism through Fiji Pharmaceutical Services. Under \nGFATM round 5, SPC will assume responsibility for procuring and managing the supply of \nHIV/AIDS  drugs  and  health  products.  The  high  cost  of  ARVs  puts  them  out  of  reach  of \nindividuals and most PDMC government health budgets. Only Samoa and the Solomon Islands \nprovide ARV treatment through their ministry of health pharmaceutical budgets. ARV treatment \nis essential for HIV-positive people and the availability of such treatment programs is also vital \nto encourage people at risk to undergo voluntary testing. Of the 56 HIV-positive people in the \nPDMCs other than the Fiji Islands, only 6 are currently receiving treatment. To ensure the \nsustainability  of  ARV  treatment  programs  over  the  long  term,  a  revolving  fund  is  being \nestablished  that  will  operate  under  World  Health  Organization  guidelines  that  require \ngovernment commitment to long-term financing for such programs.10\n \n32.  In  addition  to  treatment,  HIV-positive  people  also  need  support  to  live  in  their \ncommunities with dignity and without fear of discrimination, reprisal, and enforced dependency \non their families and communities. Many HIV-positive people lack the skills to generate income \ndespite retaining sufficient health to remain economically productive. \n \n4.  Human Rights, Participation, and Gender Issues \n33.  The issues of stigmatization and discrimination need to be addressed. Some aspects of \nPacific cultures tend to act as a barrier to understanding the risks of contracting HIV, and this is \nlikely to affect institutional and community approaches to behavior change programs and other \nprevention  initiatives.  Discrimination  may  also  have  a  detrimental  impact  on  access  to \ntreatment, prevention, care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS. \n \n34.  HIV/AIDS is a gender issue in the Pacific. Women lack political power in government \nand community decision making, lack access to health services and targeted information and \neducation materials, suffer from legal discrimination in family law and human rights, are often \npowerless in negotiating sexual relations, are subject to high levels of domestic and sexual \n                                                 \n10  The revolving fund will be established with financing from external funding agencies and participating countries. \n ", "8   \nviolence, and are discriminated against by customary practices such as the payment of a bride \nprice, and have little say in reproductive decision making and the cultural condoning of rape in \nmarriage. \n \n35.  Young people have been identified as being particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS and \ngenerally lack a strong voice in Pacific power and decision-making structures. Other vulnerable \ngroups, such as men who have sex with men and transgender communities, share similar levels \nof disempowerment and exclusion. The PRS aims to eliminate HIV-related stigmatization and \ndiscrimination and to involve people living with HIV/AIDS as key partners in the response. To \nthis end, the PRS advocates for the development of legislation, policies, and ethical guidelines. \n \n5.  Regional and Country Capacity \n36.  Country-level  capacity  within  the  health  sectors  is  limited.  While  government \ncommitment has been varied to date, most governments do not have the financial and human \nresources to implement effective and sustainable responses to HIV/AIDS. All the countries have \nundertaken strategic and action planning exercises to varying extents and have established \nnational AIDS committees. Few have the facilities and skills to undertake effective surveillance, \nto provide voluntary confidential counseling and testing services, and to deliver STI treatment \nservices  and  behavior  change  programs.  Few  are  currently  delivering  treatment  and  care \nprograms  for  people  who  are  HIV-positive.  Of  the  project  PDMCs,  only  Kiribati,  Solomon \nIslands, and Tuvalu have allocated funds for HIV/AIDS programs in their national budgets. Civil \nsociety capacity is also, for the most part, limited. The most active NGOs are those with \ninternational partnerships and funding. \n \n37.  Much of the effort to date from the United Nations, GFATM, and bilateral programs has \nbeen directed at supporting the development of country-level capacity. The PRHP focuses on \ncapacity building in both government and civil society. The PRS addresses leadership and \nadvocates for adequate resourcing both regionally and nationally and for the incorporation of \nnational AIDS action plans in country development plans. \n \n38.  Few  PDMCs  have  legislation  and  an  appropriate  regulatory  framework  in  place  to \naddress  discrimination  and  human  rights  in  relation  to  HIV/AIDS.  The  PRS  commits  to \naddressing this deficiency, and resources have been committed to support country efforts in \nadapting a good practice model of legislation. UNAIDS and the International Labor Organization \nare taking the lead in this area. \n \n39.  The predominantly regional approach taken to date is based on evidence that national \nactions in the Pacific needed to be strengthened by adopting a coordinated regional response, \nby sharing best practices, and by maintaining cohesion among the countries in arresting the \nepidemic and that the regional impact in halting and beginning to reverse the incidence and \nprevalence of HIV/AIDS will be larger than the sum of country-by-country outcomes. In addition, \nthe  regional  approach  addresses  the  limited  human  resource  capacity  of  PDMCs.  Prior \nsuccesses with regional approaches point to regional integration as the best mechanism for \nachieving efficiency among small island economies. The Pacific region continues to promote \nregionalization in a number of areas, including HIV/AIDS. \n \n6.  Lessons Learned \n40.  The development of the PRS took into account a number of lessons learned from the \nfirst regional strategy, including the importance of enhancing access to treatment, prevention, \n ", "      9\nand care, people living with HIV/AIDS and the desirability of approaches based on human rights \nto combat stigmatization and discrimination. From countries where the epidemic has taken hold, \nthe Pacific has learned that approaches to prevention, care, treatment, and impact mitigation \nmust be sustained and comprehensive in order to effectively address the epidemic. \n \n7.  Strategic Context \n41.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  in  the  Pacific  is  formulated  within  the  framework  of  ADB\u2019s  overall \nHIV/AIDS strategy for Asia and the Pacific and ADB\u2019s Pacific strategy, the memorandum of \nunderstanding ADB has signed with UNAIDS, and the grant arrangements under the Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) IX replenishment. \n \n42.  ADB HIV/AIDS Strategy for Asia and the Pacific. ADB will help developing member \ncountries achieve Millennium Development Goal 6, target 7: to have halted and begun to \nreverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015. The purpose of ADB\u2019s intervention is to have an \neffective response to HIV/AIDS in place at the country and regional levels in Asia and the \nPacific. The priorities for action are to be the following:  \n \n(i)  Leadership support. Strengthen the commitment of regional leaders to address \nHIV/AIDS.  \n(ii)  Capacity building. Increase capacity at the country and regional levels to address \nHIV/AIDS.  \n(iii)  Targeted programs. Expand HIV/AIDS interventions that mitigate risk among the \npoor, the vulnerable, and the high-risk groups. \n \n43.  In  pursuing  activities  in  each  of  these  areas,  ADB  will  subscribe  to  principles  of \nmaintaining  country  and  government  leadership;  partnership  and  consultation  with  other \ndevelopment agencies, civil society, and people living with HIV/AIDS; mainstreaming gender \nissues; targeting and capacity building based on sound technical knowledge; flexibility and \ninnovation; and timely monitoring and evaluation. \n \n44.  ADB  and  UNAIDS  Memorandum  of  Understanding.  This  memorandum  of \nunderstanding states that the collaboration between ADB and UNAIDS will be guided and built \nupon by the following principles and fundamental action: (i) the co-ownership of processes, with \na focus on deriving synergies from shared activities and cooperation; (ii) the development and \npromotion of technically sound approaches to addressing the AIDS epidemic; (iii) the use of \ninclusive approaches that involve civil society, vulnerable populations, and people living with \nHIV/AIDS and promote gender equity; (iv) the integration and application of prevention, care, \ntreatment, and support initiatives in relation to HIV and AIDS; and (v) the strengthening of \nnational responses. \n \n45.  ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy. One of three strategic objectives for ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy \n2005\u22122009 is to enhance the supply of and demand for quality, basic social services. To this \nend, ADB has identified three key result areas: social sector strategies relevant and responsive \nto  national  objectives  and  client  needs;  effective  public,  private,  and  development  partner \nresource allocations for basic social services; and capacity building in relation to managing and \ndelivering of quality basic social services. ADB has committed to explore innovative approaches \nfor providing social services, including coordinated donor approaches at the regional level for \nsuch public goods as surveillance and prevention of HIV/AIDS. ADB is also providing regional \n ", "10   \ntechnical assistance11 to enhance knowledge in relation to HIV/AIDS programs and policies and \nincrease awareness and understanding among key decision makers of critical HIV/AIDS issues. \n \n46.  ADF IX Grants for HIV/AIDS. The ADF 2005\u22122008 includes a grant program to combat \nHIV/AIDS  and  other  infectious  diseases.  Regional  grants  can  be  made  to  an  appropriate \nregional institution in circumstances where ADB considers that better results would be achieved \nby providing the grant to such an institution than from awarding the grant to individual member \ngovernments. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n47.  The Project will promote regional public goods and provide support to Cook Islands, \nKiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru,12 Samoa, Solomon Islands, \nTonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, hereinafter referred to as the project PDMCs. The impact of the \nProject will be a reduction in the spread and effects of HIV/AIDS in the Pacific. The outcome of \nthe Project will be improved management and delivery of HIV/AIDS prevention activities in the \nPacific  through  the  targeting  of  vulnerable  populations. The  project  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 4. \n \n48.  The Project will constitute a core part of the PRSIP and will promote synergies between \nthe PRS and the activities funded by the GFATM round 5 and other development partners to \nensure  the  efficient  use  of  resources  and  the  avoidance  of  duplication  of  effort,  waste  of \nresources, policy confusion, and lack of coordination.13 It will complement and augment existing \nactivities. The Project will lead to improvements in the health status of Pacific populations, \nreduce poverty through higher economic growth, and underpin progress toward achieving the \nhealth-related Millennium Development Goals. \n \nB.  Outputs \n49.  The  Project  has  four  components  to  be  implemented  over  a  4-year  period:  (i) \nstrengthening  surveillance,  (ii)  community-based  interventions  for  HIV/AIDS  prevention,  (iii) \ntargeted interventions for vulnerable groups, and (iv) project management. \n \n1.  Component 1: Strengthening Surveillance \n50.  Component  1  focuses  on  developing  national  HIV/AIDS  surveillance  capacity  by \ndeveloping  methodologies  and  skills  for  conducting  second-generation  surveys  to  better \nunderstand the status of and risk factors for HIV infection and prevention among high-risk \nsubpopulations across the region. The activities will focus mainly on building capacity so that \nthe  countries  and  the  region  can  mobilize  and  target  resources  to  curb  growing  rates  of \ninfection. The outputs of this component will be (i) a vulnerability-mapping study to identify \nvulnerable populations; (ii) an expanded second-generation HIV surveillance survey program; \n(iii)  the  expansion  of  routine  surveillance  capacity;  (iv)  the  design and  delivery  of  specific \nsurveillance  programs  for  identified  groups;  (v)  an  improvement  in  countries\u2019  laboratory \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2005. Regional Technical Assistance for Socioeconomic Implications of HIV/AIDS in the Pacific. Manila. \n12  ADB\u2019s policy of not extending financing to countries in nonaccrual status is not applicable to ADF IX grant \nassistance provided for HIV/AIDS projects undertaken on a regional basis. \n13  ADB has committed to the UNAIDS \u2018\u201dthree ones\u201d Principle: one agreed framework of action, one national AIDS \ncoordinating authority, and one agreed country-level monitoring and evaluation system. \n ", "      11\ncapacity;  and  (vi)  the  development  of  a  regional  data  warehouse  to  collect,  analyze,  and \ndisseminate  regional  HIV/AIDS  surveillance  data.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  to  develop \nnecessary information and communications technology platforms and train national counterpart \nstaff in the sustainable use of these systems. \n \n2.  Component 2: Community-Based Interventions for HIV/AIDS Prevention \n \n51.  This component will reduce the burden of HIV/AIDS across the 10 target countries of the \nProject. The component will target evidence-based interventions that currently have insufficient \nlevels  of  investment.  Component  2  is  divided  into  three  subcomponents:  (i)  support  for  a \nregional condom social marketing program, including the design and delivery of mass media \nand targeted communication programs promoting condom use and an improved supply of male \nand female condoms; (ii) support for BCC programs, including the development of tailored BCC \nmaterials and the design and delivery of BCC programs; and (iii) support for STI treatment and \ncare programs, including the provision of training for local health care workers in STI treatment \nand care and the provision of equipment and materials to STI treatment facilities. \n \n52.  Condom Social Marketing. A condom social marketing program already in place will be \naugmented. A range of tools, including product launch events, mass media, and peer education, \nwill be used to generate demand for condoms, to raise brand awareness, and to increase the \navailability  of  condoms  through  commercial  channels.  In  addition,  market  research  will  be \nconducted to better define effective distribution channels and identify target populations. The \nregional  condom  social  marketing  organization  implementing  the  GFATM  condom  social \nmarketing project will be contracted for these activities. \n \n53.  Behavior Change Communication. The Project will support BCC activities to provide \ninformation about HIV prevention to change social norms and behaviors in order to reduce \nvulnerability to HIV infection. At the country level, the Project will assist with ongoing efforts to (i) \nidentify priority groups, (ii) develop a strategy specific to address local needs in a participatory \nmanner,  and  (iii)  organize  community  action.  The  Project  will  use  existing  channels  and \ninfrastructure to reach the priority groups. Facilities will be strengthened through training and the \nprovision of BCC materials and condoms for distribution. Peer education will be used for groups \nthat are hard to reach. \n \n54.  Care and Management of STIs. The number of facilities providing STI diagnosis and \ntreatment will be increased. Capital and recurrent resource needs of 20 STI clinics in the 10 \nproject PDMCs will be supported. Capacity development in relation to laboratory diagnosis will \nalso be supported in selected facilities in the project PDMCs. \n \n3.  Component 3: Targeted Interventions for Vulnerable Groups \n \n55.  Component 3 focuses on supporting targeted interventions for vulnerable populations \nwithin the project PDMCs. A number of activities will be undertaken, including (i) providing \nsupport for five new drop-in centers for seafarers and their communities that provide information \non HIV/AIDS, STIs, and safe sex and referrals to appropriate services;14 (ii) developing and \ndistributing information,  education,  and  communication  materials  for vulnerable  groups;  (iii) \nproviding targeted training for NGOs working with vulnerable groups; (iv) supporting regional \nmaritime schools in training on HIV/AIDS and STIs; (v) providing training in enhancing livelihood \nskills for HIV-positive people; and (vi) providing ARV drugs for HIV-positive people. \n                                                 \n14  In Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. \n ", "12   \n4.  Component 4: Project Management \n56.  This component will manage the Project and includes project planning, monitoring, and \nevaluation. SPC will be the executing agency for the Project. A project management unit (PMU) \nwill be established to manage the Project and will be responsible for regional coordination, data \nand document collection, support of international consultants, provision of logistics support, and \norganization of project workshops and training. The Project Steering Committee will operate \nwithin the framework of the coordinating and oversight vehicle established for the PRSIP. The \nSPC Public Health Program and HIV/AIDS Unit, BCC Program, and Surveillance Program will \nprovide oversight, technical guidance, and specialist expertise to the Project. \n \nC.  Special Features \n57.  The  Project  will  adopt  a  regional  approach  based  on  the  commitment  of  all  key \nstakeholders to supporting the PRS. In particular, the regional approach addresses the limited \ncapacity in the project PDMCs. The Project is part of the PRS and will complement existing \nactivities. In almost all respects, the Project will scale up and supplement current efforts. \n \n58.  Consistent with the Project\u2019s regional approach, SPC will be the grant recipient.15  SPC \nserves 22 Pacific island countries (including all of ADB\u2019s PDMCs except Timor-Leste) and \nterritories by means of technical assistance, training, and research. Its work covers a range of \nsectors, including natural resources (for example, agriculture and fisheries) and social and \neconomic programs (for instance, culture, health, statistics, women, and youth). SPC is the \nlargest and oldest regional organization concerned with development in the Pacific.  \n \n59.  At the regional level, SPC is a leading organization in public health matters in general \nand HIV/AIDS in particular. SPC has well-established links with the health agencies of the \nPacific governments, NGOs, and multilateral and bilateral partners. SPC manages multicountry \nhealth programs and projects and is the focal point for many health activities in the Pacific. SPC \nhas the experience, as well as the operational, financial, and governance systems, required for \nmanaging regional and multicountry programs. SPC\u2019s member governments have asked SPC to \ndevelop and manage implementation of the PRS and have nominated SPC as the principal \nrecipient of grants provided by GFATM. SPC is authorized to negotiate with donor agencies on \nbehalf of its member countries. As the Project adheres to and operates under the mandate of \nthe PRS, SPC is the most logical and appropriate recipient of grant funds for the Project. SPC \nwill contribute counterpart staff and certain other direct incremental costs to the Project. \n \n60.  ADB\u2019s Charter specifies that ADB may provide financing to international or regional \nagencies or entities concerned with the economic development of Asia and the Far East.16 \nAccess to the ADF for this purpose is permitted by ADF regulations.17 The ADF IX grants facility \nrecognizes the need for sustained regional cooperation in the context of HIV/AIDS and other \ncommunicable and infectious diseases. As an intergovernmental regional entity involved with \nADB member countries and concerned with the economic development of the Pacific region, \n                                                 \n15 SPC was founded in 1947 by an intergovernmental treaty and has the status of an international organization. Its \ncurrent members are American Samoa, Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, France, French Polynesia, Guam, \nKiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Niue, Northern \nMariana Islands, Palau, PNG, Pitcairn Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, United States, \nVanuatu, and Wallis and Futuna. \n16 ADB. 1966.

As  the  regional  agency empowered  by  the  PDMCs  to  coordinate  and  implement \nregional HIV/AIDS activities under the PRS, SPC is particularly well suited to receive ADF IX \ngrant funding for purposes of the Project. As a grant to a regional organization consisting of \nADB member countries, the proposed financing is classified as a public sector grant. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n61.  The total project cost is estimated at $8.0 million equivalent. Cost estimates include (i) \nstaff costs, including travel, training, and overhead; (ii) international and domestic consulting \nservices; (iii) information and communications technology costs; (iv) laboratory and equipment \ncosts; (v) research and studies costs; (vi) medical supplies; (vii) condoms; (viii) costs of setting \nup maritime drop-in centers; and (ix) contingencies.18 Cost estimates are shown in Table 2 and \ndetailed in Appendix 5. \n \nTable 2: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \nComponent    Total \n     \nA.

SPC will establish \na project steering committee. SPC will be responsible for project implementation. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n65.  The project duration is 4 years. It is expected to end in March 2010. The bulk of the \ninvestment will occur in the first 3 years. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n3.  Procurement \n66.  ADB-financed  goods  and  related  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  the \nGuidelines for Procurement under ADB Loans. A package of equipment and medical supplies \nestimated  to  cost  more  than  $100,000  will  be  procured  by  international  shopping  and    a \npackage  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $100,000  will  be  procured  by  direct  purchase.  The \nprocurement of equipment and medical supplies will be managed by SPC as the executing \nagency. An indicative list of procurement is in Appendix 7, Table A7.1. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n67.  Expected needs for consulting are 221 person-months of international and 161 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services to conduct specialized activities for all four project \ncomponents.  The  consultants  will  help  SPC  in  the  areas  of  surveillance,  information  and \ncommunications technology, condom social marketing, BCC, HIV prevention, peer education, \nSTI case management, project management, seafarer support, and NGO support. Outline terms \nof reference for consulting services are in Appendix 8. \n \n68.  Selection and engagement of consultant services will be undertaken in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the \nengagement of domestic consultants. \n \n69.  Marie Stopes International will be directly selected for the condom social marketing \nsubcomponent. Direct selection is justified because Marie Stopes International is the regional \nNGO contracted for condom social marketing activities under the GFATM project and has \nunique experience and qualifications for this subcomponent, which will be scaled up under the \nProject. Other consultants will be engaged on an individual basis. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n70.  SPC  will  establish  an  imprest  account  immediately  after  grant  effectiveness. \nReplenishment of the imprest account will be supported by appropriate withdrawal applications \nand related documentation. The initial amount to be deposited in the imprest account will not \nexceed  $500,000  equivalent.  The  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  may  be  used  for \n ", "      15\nreimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidation  of  imprest  account  expenses.  The \nstatement of expenditures procedure is applicable to individual payments not exceeding the \nequivalent  of  $50,000.  Detailed  arrangements  for  establishing  and  operating  the  imprest \naccount  and  statement  of  expenses  procedure  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook of January 2001. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n71.  SPC will maintain separate accounts for the Project that will contain detailed descriptions \nof the sources of receipts and expenditures. In addition, a full set of financial statements \n(income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow and related notes) will be prepared. The \nannual project accounts and annual financial statements will be audited by independent auditors \nacceptable to ADB and will be submitted to ADB no later than 6 months following the end of the \nfiscal year to which they relate. SPC was informed about ADB\u2019s policy on submitting audited \nfinancial statements and possible penalties for delays in submission. \n \n72.  SPC will prepare and submit to ADB regular progress reports on a semi-annual basis. \nThe  progress  reports  will  identify  problems  and  difficulties,  if  any,  encountered  during \nimplementation and a summary of financial accounts for the Project that will consist of project \nexpenditures during the reporting period, year to date, and total to date. A project completion \nreport will be provided no later than 3 months following completion of the Project. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n73.  Project performance monitoring indicators that were agreed to during project preparation \ninclude  quality  standards  for  the  surveillance  program,  completion  of  the  condom  social \nmarketing program, STI and HIV infection rates and project milestones. The relevance and \npracticability of data collection for the proposed measures have been confirmed with SPC. At \nthe  beginning  of  the  Project,  SPC  will  develop  procedures  for  a  comprehensive  project \nperformance monitoring and evaluation system (PPMES) to systematically generate data on \ninputs for and outputs of the four project components and the agreed indicators to be used to \nmeasure project impacts. SPC will refine the PPMES framework, confirm achievable goals, \nrefine monitoring and recording arrangements, and establish systems and procedures no later \nthan 6 months following grant effectiveness. The PPMES framework will be based on the \nmonitoring and evaluation framework adopted for the PRSIP. \n \n74.  Under  the  PPMES  framework,  SPC  will  report  baseline  and  progress  data  at  the \nrequisite time intervals and will be responsible for analyzing and consolidating the data through \nits documentation, issues resolution, and management information systems. The PPMES will be \ndesigned to permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial action in relation to project design, \nschedules, activities, and development impacts. SPC, through the PMU, will monitor and assess \nactivities and report to ADB on the implementation and financial aspects of the Project to ensure \nthat progress and impacts are monitored and reported in line with ADB requirements. \n \n8.  Project Review \n75.  Regular  ADB  review  missions  are  envisaged  throughout  the  project  period  and  a \nmidterm review will be undertaken within 18 months of the start of project implementation. This \nreview will include a detailed evaluation of the Project\u2019s scope, implementation arrangements, \nachievement of scheduled targets, and progress of activities. The review will take into account \nthe PRS 2005\u22122008 and will assess the continuing appropriateness of the Project in achieving \n ", "16   \nthe goals of that broader strategy. The midterm review will provide a basis for ADB and SPC to \nidentify  and  discuss  any  necessary  changes  in  project  design  and/or  implementation \narrangements. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n76.  The Project will result in a robust, effective regional response to preventing the spread of \nHIV by strengthening and consolidating the efforts of Pacific governments to implement the PRS \non HIV/AIDS 2004-2008. The Project will ensure that resources are committed and efforts \nchanneled according to the priorities identified in the regional strategy, that the possibility of \noverlapping efforts and duplication is removed, that the risk of gaps remaining unmet because \nof poor coordination is minimized, that policy debate is coherent and coordinated, and that \nadministration is streamlined. The economic and social analysis is in Appendix 9. \n \n77.  Direct beneficiaries of the Project include (i) the people who do not become infected with \nHIV and their families and communities, (ii) the people living with HIV/AIDS who have access to \nARV  treatment  and  means  for  developing  improved  livelihood  skills,  (iii)  the  regional  and \ncountry-level institutions and actors that will have adequate resources to sustain their HIV/AIDS \nprevention activities, (iv) the health systems in the PDMCs that will be relieved of the burden of \nan increased epidemic, and (v) the national economies. \n \nA.  Social Benefits \n78.  The Project will result in lower HIV infection rates and will benefit those people who \nwould have been infected had they not been educated about the likelihood of infection from risk-\ntaking behaviors and had not been able to choose to modify this behavior accordingly because \nof lack of access to information, voluntary confidential counseling and testing, and condoms. \nThe  Project  will  achieve  better  information  and  understanding  of  the  issues  surrounding \nHIV/AIDS and promote more open dialogue within Pacific communities, resulting in reduced \nstigma attached to the infection and reduced discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS \nand their families. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \nB.  Economic Benefits \n79.  The Project will generate considerable national economic benefits. Research conducted \nby the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health 200119 indicates that a high prevalence of \ndiseases such as malaria or HIV/AIDS is associated with significantly lower rates of economic \ngrowth.  Investments  resulting  in  a  decrease  in  disease  prevalence  are  therefore  likely  to \ngenerate  considerable  national  economic  benefits.  Infectious  diseases  tend  to \ndisproportionately affect poor people, who tend to suffer from poor nutrition and have limited \nresources to apply to health care and better education. In addition, some of the most vulnerable \ngroups in the region, including seafarers, are sources of remittances and generate significant \nexport  earnings.  Increased  prevalence  among  these  groups  would  result  in  decreased \nhousehold revenues, and in some cases, reduced performance of national economies. \n \n80.  The region\u2019s health systems will avoid or minimize the impact of an HIV/AIDS epidemic \nand be able to apply health sector resources to other health priorities. \n \n                                                 \n19  WHO. 2001. Macroeconomics and Health: Investing in Health for Economic Development. Geneva. \n ", "      17\n81.  The quantitative cost-benefit analysis for the Project follows the methodologies outlined \nin  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.  Key  assumptions  include  the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  Discount rate. The economic opportunity cost of capital was assumed to be \n12%. Most health project analyses use 3% as a discount factor; therefore future \nbenefits are likely to be given greater value. To harmonize this analysis with \nother project appraisals in nonhealth sectors, a higher discount rate is used. \n(ii)  Projection of project benefits and costs. The period of analysis covers 20 \nyears and benefits and costs are converted into constant 2006 dollar prices. \n(iii)  Economic cost of labor. The opportunity cost of labor or the shadow wage rate \nfor both urban and rural adults was calculated at $2,000 per year.20 \n \n82.  Economic Costs. Base investment costs are in constant 2006 dollar prices. Incremental \nrecurrent costs are calculated for the 20 years following the 4-year project implementation \nperiod.  \n \n83.  Economic Benefits. The Project will improve the socioeconomic condition of the target \nbeneficiaries. Key project benefits are to be estimated in the following ways: (i) cost savings \nresulting from increased health awareness and reduced disease prevalence, and (ii) enhanced \nincome of both rural and urban income earners who care for the sick.  \n \n84.  Improved HIV and STI management will reduce the burden of these diseases and \ngenerate  economic  benefits  largely  through  reduced  out-of-pocket  expenditures  and  will \ndecrease the costs associated with lost labor through decreased numbers of sick days. In \nsummary, key benefits include cost savings due to increased health awareness and improved \nHIV and STI control. Resource or out-of-pocket savings may flow from (i) increased access to \nhealth services to reduce transport costs, and (ii) reduced costs of treatment because of more \nefficient and rational diagnosis and treatment.21 Thus improvements in health status as a result \nof health awareness activities lead to significant decreases in out-of-pocket health expenditures. \n \n85.  The Project is estimated to lead to the avoidance of nearly 4,000 HIV infections across \n10 Pacific countries over a 20-year period and to an annual decrease of nearly 2,000 STI cases \nper year. The economic internal rate of return from this impact is estimated to be 13%, and an \neconomic net present value of $0.5 million is calculated. \n \nC.  Technical and Institutional Benefits \n86.  The Project will achieve better HIV/AIDS surveillance in the Pacific. Sound information \nabout incidence and prevalence rates and about which groups are most vulnerable will mean \nthat  better  policy  decisions  can  be  made  about  prevention  efforts  and  better  budgetary \ndecisions can be made about where to allocate scarce resources. The Project will result in \nbetter monitoring and evaluation for future decision makers by identifying sound baselines and \ntracking the progress of different approaches and programs. Thus the key institutions and actors \nworking  on  HIV/AIDS  in  the  Pacific  will  benefit  from  the  Project.  The  investment  in  skill \ndevelopment; tools and resource kits; and targeted information, education; and communication \npackages will result in more effective and sustainable efforts in HIV/AIDS prevention. \n                                                 \n20  WB. 2004.

Environmental Impact \n87.  The Project will not have adverse environmental effects. The Project will finance some \npreventive  medical  activities  that  leave  limited  by-products.  Project  supervision  will  closely \nmonitor the issue of medical waste. SPC has a medical waste disposal initiative (LabNet)22 in \nplace through which it promotes proper disposal practices. \n \nE.  Project Risks \n88.  Project risks fall into four categories: financial, technical, institutional, and social. The key \nfinancial risk emerges from the fact that the Project is supporting a much larger, coordinated \nregional  effort  that  depends  on  the  continuing  support,  both  financial  and  political,  of  the \nrelevant governments, development partners, and civil society actors. The pursuit of a regional \napproach because of the resulting synergistic benefits and economies of scale that would not \narise if a country-level, disaggregated approach were taken increases the risk that financial \nsupport may be withdrawn to an extent that compromises the integrity of the PRS. In addition, \nthe GFATM round 5 submission for about $10.0 million may not be approved in its entirety \nbecause of the significant reduction in the overall size of the fund available for disbursement in \nround 5. Governments may also be challenged by other economic priorities and divert funds \naway from HIV/AIDS. However, the financial risk is moderate and is mitigated by the fact that \nthe PRSIP and the GFATM round 5 proposal will ensure that funds are prioritized and dedicated \nto those core activities that will result in the most effective interventions for preventing HIV \ninfection. \n \n89.  The main technical risks concern the extent of absorptive capacity at the country level to \nimplement community-level activities effectively. This risk is moderate and is mitigated by the \nconsiderable focus on developing government and civil society capacity in the PRS.  \n \n90.  Institutional risk pertains to the reliance placed on SPC to effectively manage the PRS, \nthe GFATM-funded projects, and this Project. SPC will need to retain the confidence of its \nstakeholders by maintaining its high-level capacity to deliver results. Specifically, SPC needs to \nretain its human resource capability and expertise. This risk is mitigated by the considerable \nresources being committed to the project management component and to the provision of \nsupport to SPC for administrative expenses associated with the Project. \n \n91.  The key social risk for the Project is that its impacts rely on people changing their sexual \nbehavior.  Project  outputs  will  provide  information,  education,  and  condoms  to  affect  this \nbehavior change and there is an assumption that the determinants of sexual behavior outside \nthe control of the Project will remain favorable or neutral. Another social risk is that the features \nof Pacific culture that discourage open discussion about sexual issues and cultural taboos may \nhinder the Project\u2019s activities. Faith-based groups and conservative actors may generate a \nbacklash and promote misunderstanding that could counter the efforts of the Project. This risk is \nconsidered to be moderately high and will be mitigated by special efforts aimed at Pacific \nleaders and champions of change and by the Project\u2019s clear focus on information, education, \nand communication. The PRS emphasizes this issue. \n \n                                                 \n22 LabNet is a Pacific-wide laboratory training and quality assurance program. \n \n ", "      19\nF.  Overall Assessment \n92.  The Project addresses a regional public good that is not currently receiving adequate \nlevels of investment. Economic returns from investments in health have been shown to be \nsubstantial. The private market, however, fails to invest appropriately in health prevention and \ncare because of asymmetries of information, externalities in some markets, and differences \nbetween private and social discount rates. The economic analysis suggests that investment in \nHIV/AIDS control in the Pacific will be economically attractive and financially sustainable. The \nrisks are moderate overall and are mitigated. Vulnerable groups will be the key beneficiaries. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Special Assurances \n93.  In addition to the standard assurances, the SPC has given the following assurances, \nwhich are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n94.  Status and Organization of Grantee. SPC will maintain its existence as a regional \nintergovernmental organization. SPC will notify ADB immediately upon receipt of a project \nPDMC\u2019s intention to withdraw its membership from SPC. \n \n95.  Project Management. SPC will be the executing agency for the Project. SPC will be \nresponsible  for  providing  overall  Project  guidance  and  coordinating  implementation  of  the \nProject. To ensure coordination and integration of the Project, the executing agency will be \nassisted by a Steering Committee. The Steering Committee will include representatives from \nkey stakeholder organizations with expertise in HIV/AIDS in the Pacific, including project PDMC \ngovernments, civil society organizations, people living with HIV/AIDS, development partners, \nSPC and ADB. The Steering Committee will operate within the framework of the coordinating \nand oversight vehicle established for the PRSIP and will be responsible for: (i) the policy and \nstrategic direction of the Project; (ii) monitoring and reviewing project implementation; and (iii) \nproviding necessary guidance as appropriate. The Steering Committee will be maintained until \nproject completion and will meet as often as necessary to implement the Project and no less \nthan twice per year. SPC will establish a PMU with administrative and management authority \nover all project components. The PMU will be responsible for day to day coordination and \noverall implementation of the Project and establish processes for project PDMCs coordination \nand consultation with stakeholders, including development partners, civil society and project \naffected  people.  SPC  will  ensure  that  the  resources  of  the  SPC  Public  Health  Program, \nincluding the Public Health Program Manager, the HIV/AIDS and STI Advisor, BCC Specialist, \nHIV/AIDS Surveillance Specialist and HIV/AIDS Section Administrator are available to the PMU \nas required for project implementation. SPC will ensure that the PMU is maintained until project \ncompletion. \n \n96.  Donor and Strategy Coordination. SPC will ensure that the Project is implemented in \naccordance with the PRS and PRSIP, and that all project activities complement the HIV/AIDS \nactivities funded by the GFATM. \n \n97.  Environmental  Standards.  SPC  will  monitor  project  activities  resulting  in  medical \nwaste. Through its LabNet23 initiative SPC will assist project PDMCs in complying with their \nrespective national medical waste disposal laws, regulations and standards. \n                                                 \n23 LabNet is a Pacific-wide laboratory training and quality assurance program, \n ", "20   \n98.  Project Performance Monitoring, Evaluation and Review. SPC will develop a Project \nPerformance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  System  (PPMES)  based  on  the  monitoring  and \nevaluation framework adopted under the PRSIP. The PPMES will systematically generate data \non inputs and outputs of all Project components utilizing the PPM indicators to measure project \nimpacts. No later than 6 months after grant effectiveness, SPC will refine the PPMES framework \nand attendant monitoring and recording arrangements and establish concrete systems and \nprocedures for utilizing the PPMES framework to measure project impacts. The PPMES will be \nin form and substance satisfactory to ADB. \n \n99.  Progress Reports. SPC, through the PMU, will submit to ADB semi-annual progress \nreports and a project completion report within 3 months of project completion, each in form and \nsubstance acceptable to ADB. \n \n100.  Project Review. SPC and ADB will jointly undertake a mid-term review of the Project \nwithin 18 months of grant effectiveness to assess progress and identify any necessary changes \nin project design, the project implementation schedule and/or implementation arrangements. \n \nB.  Conditions for Grant Effectiveness \n \n101.  The following actions will be required prior to grant effectiveness: (i) the PMU will have \nbeen established and become operational in a manner satisfactory to ADB; and (ii) the Project \nManager will have been appointed, and shall possess experience and qualifications acceptable \nto ADB. \n \nC.  Condition for Grant Disbursement \n102.  The following action will be required before any disbursements are made to finance \nproject activities in any project PDMC: the project PDMC has provided evidence, satisfactory to \nADB, that such PDMC supports the activities to be undertaken by the Project in its territory. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n103.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, under the provision \nof Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board approve the \ngrant not exceeding the equivalent of $8,000,000 to the Secretariat of the Pacific Community \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Capacity Development in \nthe Pacific Project in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \nJOSEPH B. EICHENBERGER \nVice President \n \n17 October 2005 \n ", "    Appendix 1  21 \nSECTOR ANALYSIS \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Background \n1.  HIV/AIDS presents genuine threat to Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs) and \nall the PDMCs have detected HIV infections. Once HIV makes its way into the tiny populations \nin the Pacific diffuse epidemics are likely to follow.1 The Pacific region is characterized by acute \nvulnerability  to  external  shocks.  Weak  economies,  rapidly  changing  social  norms  and  the \nuneasy coexistence of traditional and modern cultures have led to social problems such as drug \nand alcohol abuse, domestic violence, teenage pregnancies, high levels of sexually transmitted \ninfections (STI) and social and economic marginalization.  \n \n2.  Significant risk factors for HIV include high prevalence of STIs, low condom usage, high \nlevels of inter and intra regional mobility, cultural practices such as taboos on frank discussion \nof sexual issues, the practice of tattooing, polygamy and multiple sex partners, and high rates of \ntransactional sex. Social problems, such as youth unemployment, teenage pregnancy, suicide, \ndrug and alcohol abuse, and sexual and domestic violence are symptomatic of social and \neconomic exclusion, a situation not conducive to greater HIV preventive practices.  \n \n3.  The socioeconomic impacts of the HIV/AIDS epidemic are potentially significant. Social \nimpacts include the pain and suffering of individuals and communities affected by the illness and \ndeath of family members, children losing a parent are left without someone to love, raise and \ncare for them, the loss of hope of affected households and communities, the increase in social \nexclusion of those affected by intolerance and stigma, the increase in orphans and disrupted \nfamilies, and the rupture of community and societal bonds. At household and individual level \neconomic impacts include decreased discretionary spending from households affected by loss \nof income together with increased expenditure on care,  treatment and funerals. Economic \nimpacts are to be expected from productive sector losses such as in Tuvalu and Kiribati where \n25% of gross domestic product is contributed by the earnings of seafarers, a particularly high \nrisk population. HIV/AIDS exacerbates poverty by limiting the opportunities of the poor to lift \nthemselves out of poverty and by driving economically vulnerable people below the poverty line. \n \n4.  The  Pacific  region  experiences  highly  disparate  levels  of  development,  resulting  in \nvariable  levels  of  access  to  information  and  services.  Some  Pacific  countries  have  poorly \nfunctioning  health  systems  with  weak  capacity  to  operate  safe  blood  supplies,  treat  STIs, \nprovide counseling and testing and prevent mother-to-child transmission. The impact on health \nsectors of an increase in HIV/AIDS will be significant. Pacific health systems are already facing \na double burden of prevention and treatment of persistent, traditional infectious ailments along \nwith a rising tide of new \u2018lifestyle\u2019 diseases and have little scope to deal with HIV/AIDS. \n \n2.  Status of the Epidemic \n5.  Since HIV was first reported in a Pacific island country in 1984, over 11,000 cases have \nbeen detected. See Table A2.1 for the current situation in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Pacific \ncountries. Over 95% of detected HIV infections have been from five Pacific countries2\u2500with 93% \noccurring in PNG where it is estimated that about 75,000 people are living with the virus. In the \n                                                 \n1  UNAIDS. 2004. AIDS Epidemic Update. Geneva.  \n2  These five countries are Fiji Islands, French Polynesia, Guam, New Caledonia, and Papua New Guinea. \n   ", "22  Appendix 1                   \n             \n10-years period before 2001, the cumulative reported HIV infections in 20 small Pacific island \ncountries  had  reached  820,  rising  to  956  by  2004,  but  this  could  easily  be  a  significant \nmisrepresentation of the true situation. The rates per 100,000 people, based on reported cases, \nare Papua New Guinea (198), Tuvalu (94), Kiribati (46), Marshall Islands (18) and Fiji Islands \n(17).  These  latter  rates,  however,  are  based  on  very  few  cases  detected  through  limited \nscreening mainly of antenatal mothers and STI patients with syphilis. Where STI surveys have \ntaken  place  results  reveal  high  prevalence  levels  of  any  STI,  21%  and  30%  respectively. \nBecause of low levels of surveillance it is likely that actual prevalence rates are higher than \nofficial figures indicate. The Asian Development Bank considers it likely that under-reporting in \nthe region (including Papua New Guinea) is considerable, possibly by a factor of 10.3\n \nTable A2.1: Incidence of HIV/AIDS in Selected PDMCs  \n(as at December 2004) \n \nItem  COO  FIJ  FSM  KIR  NAU  PAL  RMI  SAM  SOL  TON  TUV  VAN  Total \nHIV \n2  182  25  46  2  8  10  12  5  13  9  2  316 \ncases \nAIDS \n0  25  15  28  1  4  2  8  2  9  2  2  98 \ncases \nAIDS \n0  17  12  23  1  3  2  8  2  8  2  0  78 \ndeaths \nAIDS = acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, COO = Cook Islands, FIJ = Fiji Islands, FSM = Federated States of \nMicronesia, HIV = human immunodeficiency virus, KIR = Kiribati, NAU = Nauru, PAL = Palau, RMI = Marshall \nIslands, SAM = Samoa, SOL = Solomon Islands, TON = Tonga, TUV = Tuvalu, VAN = Vanuatu. \n \n \n6.  In  the  Pacific,  HIV/AIDS  is  predominantly  a  sexually  transmitted  disease.  While \nheterosexual  transmission  is  most  common,  there  are  documented  cases  of  transmission \nbetween men who have sex with men (MSM), between injecting drug users, and from mother to \nchild. \n \n7.  A number of vulnerable groups have been identified, particularly young people and \nwomen,  but  also  prisoners,  prison  officers  and  police,  and  mobile  populations  such  as \nseafarers,  fishermen,  government  officials,  students  studying  abroad,  servicemen,  peace-\nkeepers and the sexual partners of these people. \n \n3.  Risk Factors \na.  Economic and Demographic factors \n8.  Economic factors alone cannot explain the distribution of HIV. Poverty as such is not \nclosely associated with the spread of HIV, partly because knowledge and skills for preventing \nHIV  are  independent  of  income.  Indeed,  HIV  is  often  associated  with  higher  incomes, \nparticularly during the early stages of an epidemic, where men with such incomes use them to \naccess multiple sex partners. Over time, however, HIV pools among those with lower levels of \neducation and income level, and after being infected with HIV, the poor get poorer as they \nspend family funds on medical care while, at the same time, their earning ability is compromised \nby sickness. \n \n9.  Unequal distribution of income contributes to greater vulnerability to an HIV epidemic \nthrough several mechanisms. First, the poor have less access to HIV prevention services, \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2005. Development, Poverty and HIV/AIDS: ADB\u2019s Strategic Response to a Growing Epidemic. Manila. \n   ", "    Appendix 1  23 \nincluding STI treatment, and therefore less knowledge about the risks of HIV and prevention \nmethods. Second, poverty restricts earning options and can induce low-income women and \nmen to engage in commercial or transactional sex, which may be fueled by migration from rural \nto urban areas in expectation of income-earning opportunities. Third, poor men must often delay \nmarriage. Fourth, if they cannot find jobs locally, spouses may leave the household in search of \njobs. Whatever the mechanism, international evidence suggests that sustainable growth and \nmore equal distribution of income help reduce the spread of HIV. In the Pacific, 20 percent or \nmore  of  the  populations  of  Fiji  Islands,  Kiribati,  Marshall  Islands,  Federated  States  of \nMicronesia, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu live on less than $1 a day. If poverty is \ncalculated as basic needs poverty, the list extends to Samoa and Tonga . \n \nb.  Sexual Behavior \n10.  Various studies of young men and women in the Pacific indicate high levels of sexual \nactivity and low levels of condom use; however, a significant handicap in the Pacific is the \ninability to discuss, research, or manage public attempts at objectivity about human sexual \nbehavior. Traditional taboos prevent such discussions between specific and religious teachings \nare strong and limit openness about the nature of sex and sexuality in most Pacific populations. \n \n11.  Anecdotal  evidence  indicates  the  existence  of  widespread  formal  and  informal  sex \ntrading throughout the Pacific. In the Fiji Islands, Chinese sex workers have been brought in to \nservice  Asian  sailors  and  fishermen  and  are  apparently  organized  in  brothels  by  Chinese \nmanagers. Fijian sex workers can be found in suburban residences, on streets, in parks, in \nclubs, and increasingly on call through an organized cell phone network.  \n \n12.  Studies of STIs among antenatal women have recently been conducted in several island \nnations. In Samoa, a survey of 427 pregnant women found high levels of chlamydia (30.9%) \nand trichomoniasis (20.8%). Even though levels of gonorrhea and syphilis were much lower and \nno HIV infections were found, overall, 42.7% of the women had at least one STI. Those younger \nthan 25 were three times more likely to have an STI than older women.4 Similarly, in Vanuatu, \n547 pregnant women were tested and 39% had one or more STI. The most common infection \nwas trichomoniasis (27.4%), followed by chlamydia (21.4%) and gonorrhea (5.9%); 2.4% had \nsyphilis and none had HIV.5  \n \n4.  Response to the Epidemic \na.  Pacific Regional Strategy on HIV/AIDS 2004\u22122008 \n13.  The first Regional Strategy for the Prevention and Control of STD/AIDS in Pacific Island \nCountries and Territories, 1997\u20132000 was developed in 1997 to provide a broad framework \nwithin which regional stakeholders could address HIV/AIDS and STIs. At a regional consultation \nworkshop in Nadi, Fiji Islands, in 2001,6 following the United Nations General Assembly Special \nSession on HIV/AIDS, there was a call for strengthening the regional response to accommodate \nthe  Pacific  leaders\u2019  commitment  at  the  session  to  further  develop  the  regional  strategic \n                                                 \n4  2004.

As  a  result,  the  Pacific  Regional  Strategy  (PRS)  on  HIV/AIDS  2004\u201320087  was \ndeveloped and endorsed by 22 Pacific island countries and territories8 in 2004. Responsibility \nfor developing the Pacific Regional Strategy Implementation Plan (PRSIP) was given to the \nSecretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC). The PRSIP is under development and was to be \nconsidered by the Pacific Forum Leaders Group in October 2005. A description of the strategy \nand implementation plan is presented in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  The PRS is recognized by governments, key civil society organizations and development \npartners as the umbrella framework for HIV/AIDS activities in the Pacific. \n \nb.  Secretariat of the Pacific Community \n16.  In 2002, SPC decided to establish a new core budget funded position of HIV/AIDS and \nSTI Adviser to lead its own activities in this area. A second professional position has been \nadded in 2005 to help manage the rapidly expanding work program. These two long-term \npositions  are  additional  to  those  funded  at  SPC  by  specific  projects.    SPC  facilitated  the \ndevelopment of the Pacific regional strategy and has been successful in raising additional \nresources for its implementation (although as noted, a funding shortfall persists). \n \nc.  National AIDS Strategies and Action Plans \n17.  All  PDMCs  have  HIV/AIDS  strategic  plans  and  national  AIDS  committees  to  guide \npolicies and program strategies, even though they differ in quality and effectiveness. Line \nministries lack the financial and/or human resource capacity to give effect to their strategies, \nand only few have translated the plans into funded programs. Similarly, most of the PDMCs \nhave few civil society actors capable of or interested in addressing what is still often regarded as \na remote threat.  \n \n18.  As with many public health issues in the Pacific, nearly all HIV/AIDS activities in the \nregion are funded by external agencies and there is a substantial requirement for coordination \nto ensure optimum allocation of those resources and minimization of duplication. Governments \nand stakeholders have demonstrated their recognition of this by preferring regional approaches \nfor their activities and by delegating responsibility for the PRS to SPC. \n \n                                                 \n7  SPC. 2004.

Regional Strategy \n  1.  Overview \n1.  Estimates indicate that 6.4 million people are currently living with HIV/AIDS in the Asia \nand Pacific region. HIV/AIDS was first reported in the Pacific in 1984, and about 10,000 cases \nof HIV infections have been reported in the region to date. Recent evidence indicates that \nHIV/AIDS is on the rise in places as remote as Kiribati and Tuvalu, and the rate of increase in \nsome areas is alarming.  \n \n2.  In 2002, the Pacific Islands Forum meeting discussed HIV/AIDS for the first time and \nacknowledged that HIV/AIDS was a development issue and one that could have a potentially \ndevastating impact on the health, economies, societies, and security of the region. In August \n2003, Pacific island leaders called for the development of a regional strategy on HIV/AIDS. This \ninitiative resulted in the Pacific Regional Strategy (PRS) on HIV/AIDS 2004\u22122008 to provide a \nstrategic framework for national and regionally-funded activities throughout the Pacific. The PRS \nhas three main purposes: (i) to increase Pacific island countries' capacity for an effective and \nsustainable response to HIV/AIDS, (ii) to strengthen coordination and mobilize resources and \nexpertise, and (iii) to help countries achieve and report on their national and international targets \nfor HIV/AIDS.  \n \n3.  The PRS, endorsed by Pacific island leaders in 2004, is based on the recognition that \nthe many challenges inherent in implementing effective responses to HIV/AIDS affect the entire \nregion and have to be addressed collectively. The strategy guides the region\u2019s response to the \npandemic for the next 5 years. The strategy guides current HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and \ncare activities as well as proposals for future projects, which are designed so as to complement \nthe strategies of individual countries. \n \n4.  Addressing HIV/AIDS in the Pacific region faces the following 11 key challenges: (i) \ninadequate  surveillance  and  monitoring  capacity  at  all  levels;  (ii)  long  distances  and \ncommunication difficulties; (iii) need to provide sustained leadership at all levels; (iv) lack of \nresources; (v) culture as a barrier to understanding and prevention initiatives, including lack of \nunderstanding of gender relations; (vi) lack of capacity in responding to HIV; (vii) difficulties in \nsustaining comprehensive national responses; (viii) need for coordination at the national and \nregional levels; (ix) need to deal with vulnerable groups; (x) need to address stigmatization and \ndiscrimination; and (xi) need to build capacity to provide treatment to those with AIDS. \n \n5.  Globally, the HIV/AIDS pandemic has already had a devastating impact. In the Pacific, \nwhere HIV prevalence rates are still relatively low compared with those in the rest of the world, \nthe spread of HIV/AIDS needs to be halted and reversed immediately. Decreasing the number \nof  infections  has  a  direct  link  to  the  region\u2019s  sustainable  health,  economic,  and  social \ndevelopment. \n \n6.  HIV was first reported in a Pacific island country in 1984. Subsequently, 8,268 confirmed \nHIV infections and 1,672 AIDS cases have been reported. More than 95% of reported HIV \ninfections have been in five Pacific island countries and territories (PICTs): Fiji Islands, French \nPolynesia, Guam, New Caledonia, and Papua New Guinea. The HIV epidemic in the Pacific is \ndiverse, with the primary mode of spread being heterosexual. HIV/AIDS cases have been \nreported from all Pacific member countries, with significant increases in Kiribati and Tuvalu, \n   ", "26  Appendix 2                   \n             \nwhere maritime workers and their spouses and children account for up to 65% of the infected \npopulation.  However,  these  numbers  are  based  on  a  few  cases  detected  through  limited \nscreening, mainly of antenatal mothers and sexually transmitted infection (STI) patients with \nsyphilis, and are likely to be much higher. \n \n  2.  Development of the Strategy \n7.  The  PRS  was  developed  through  an  extensive  consultative  process,  taking  into \nconsideration the uniqueness of the Pacific region and issues related to HIV/AIDS, including \nlessons  learnt  from  countries  that  have  successfully  halted  and  reversed  the  spread  of \nHIV/AIDS. The first Regional Strategy for the Prevention and Control of STD/AIDS in Pacific \nIsland Countries and Territories, 1997\u20132000 provided a framework for action by PICTs when the \ndisease first emerged in the region. Based on the impact evaluation and outcomes of the first \nregional strategy, the PRS for 2004\u22122008 has been drafted and set up. A major challenge has \nbeen to accommodate the varying views and concerns in this region of diverse cultures and \nreligious backgrounds and differing national HIV epidemics, while at the same time having a \nstrategy  that  is  based  on  such  universal  principles  as  leadership;  prevention;  reduced \nvulnerability;  and  provision  of  care,  support,  and  treatment.  Nevertheless,  the  region  has \nsuccessfully formulated a strategy that reflects the Pacific\u2019s needs and course of action in its \nfight against HIV/AIDS. \n \n8.  Following the regional HIV/AIDS coordinating meeting in October 2003 in Nadi, Fiji \nIslands,  the  Regional  Strategic  Reference  Group  was  established.  The  group  consists  of \nrepresentatives of the main subregions of the Pacific, including the American-affiliated Pacific \nisland countries and the French territories; of people living with HIV/AIDS; of nongovernment \norganizations; of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS; and of technical agencies. \nThe PRS\u2019s concepts and components were discussed during several meetings of the Regional \nStrategic Reference Group.1 As a result, the PRS was formulated. The strategy reflects the \nregion\u2019s experience in dealing with the diseases and identifies emerging issues that need to be \naddressed immediately. \n \n  3.  Key Direction of the Strategy \n9.  The regional strategy will support national efforts to prevent and control HIV/AIDS and \nother  STIs  and  strengthen  work  at  the  regional  level  through  improved  coordination, \ncollaboration,  and  partnership  between  regional  organizations  and  national  programs.  The \nstrategy builds on the following eight Pacific themes: (i) leadership; (ii) a safe and healthy \nPacific islands community; (iii) access to good quality services; (iv) human rights and greater \ninvolvement  of  people  with  and  affected  by  HIV/AIDS;  (v)  coordination,  collaboration,  and \npartnership; (vi) funding and access to resources; (vii) planning, monitoring and evaluation, \nsurveillance, and research activities; and (viii) addressing vulnerability. \n \n10.  The strategy\u2019s goal is to reduce the spread and impact of HIV/AIDS while embracing \npeople infected and affected by the virus in Pacific communities. The strategy has three main \n                                                 \n1 The following were the major meetings:  (i) regional meeting in Suva, Fiji Islands (March and April 2004); (ii) Joint \nFiji Great Council of Chiefs\u2013Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS meeting on Accelerating Action Against \nHIV/AIDS in the Pacific, Vuda, Fiji Islands (March 2004); (iii) World Council of Churches (Pacific office) meeting in \nNadi, Fiji Islands (March 2004); (iv) Regional Workshop on HIV/STI Surveillance, Nadi, Fiji Islands (May 2004); (v) \nCouncil of Regional Organizations in the Pacific Working Group on Health and Population meeting in Suva, Fiji \nIslands (May 2004); and (vii) Pacific Regional Consultation on Gender and Development, Nadi, Fiji Islands (May \n2004). \n   ", "    Appendix 2  27 \ncomponents: (i) to increase the capacity of PICTs to achieve and sustain an effective and \nsustainable response to HIV/AIDS; (ii) to strengthen coordination of the regional response and \nto mobilize resources and expertise to help countries achieve their targets; and (iii) to help \nPICTs achieve and report on their national and international targets in response to HIV/AIDS. \nThe strategy is framed within principles that acknowledge the traditional, cultural, and religious \nvalues of the Pacific communities. It affirms the protection and promotion of human rights, is \nbased on partnerships and a multisectoral approach, and is sensitive to gender differences and \nthe concerns of vulnerable groups. \n \nB.  Pacific Regional Strategy Implementation Plan \n11.  Following  the  formulation  of  the  PRS  in  2004,  members  of  the  Pacific  community \ndeveloped  the  Pacific  Regional  Strategy  Implementation  Plan  (PRSIP)  in  January  2005. \nBuilding on the strategy\u2019s eight themes, the PRSIP defines thematic objectives, strategies, and \nkey actions. It articulates a 5-year plan for implementation by regional governments; civil society \norganizations, including nongovernment organizations and the media; regional agencies; and \ndevelopment partners. During the implementation phase, reviews and monitoring and evaluation \nwill be conducted to ensure that the purposes of the strategy are achieved. The implementation \nplan draws clear links between the suggested project objectives and the regional strategy. Table \nA3.1 summarizes the eight themes that guide and inform the PRS and shows how they relate to \neach component of the PRSIP. \n \nTable A3.1: Pacific Regional Strategy and Implementation Plan: \nThemes and Components of the PRS and PRSIP  \n \nPRS Theme   PRSIP Component  \n1.

As  shown  in  Table  A3.1,  the  links  between  the  PRS  and  the  PRSIP  are  clear. \nLeadership support will strengthen the commitment of regional leaders to address HIV/AIDS. \nThis is in line with theme 1 and the outputs of component 1 of the PRSIP. The support for \ncapacity building at the country and regional levels to address HIV/AIDS is in line with themes 2, \n3, 4, and 5 and a number of outputs under components 1 and 2 of the PRSIP. Targeted \nprograms implemented under the strategy, such as the expansion of HIV/AIDS interventions \nthat mitigate risk among the poor, the vulnerable, and the high-risk groups, are in line with \ntheme 8 and components 1 and 3 of the PRSIP.  \n \n   ", "28  Appendix 2                   \n             \n13.  The  PRS  highlights  addressing  vulnerability  as  one  of  its  fundamental  themes  and \nidentifies a number of key vulnerable groups, namely: women; commercial seafarers and their \npartners; individuals with STIs; mobile populations, including international peacekeepers and \nindividuals involved in international tourism ventures; prisoners; commercial and transactional \nsex  workers;  and  men  who  have  sex  with  men.  Special  attention  will  be  given  to  these \nvulnerable  groups  to  ensure  that  HIV/AIDS  prevention,  treatment,  and  care  programs  are \nextended to them. \n \n14.  The  PRS  provides  the  overarching  direction  and  the  PRSIP  sets  out  specific \ninterventions, identifies gaps, and specifies the budget for each activity. The costs of the PRSIP \nhave been estimated at just over $15.0 million and a funding shortfall of $8.5 million has been \nidentified. In addition to project-related funding gaps, several program gaps have been identified \nduring  the  preparation  of  the  Global  Fund  for  AIDS,  Tuberculosis,  and  Malaria  round  5 \nsubmission. The PRSIP Working Group estimates that the total shortfall of funding will be \nconsiderably higher, even taking into account the anticipated funding from round 5.  \n \n15.  Implementing  agents  at  the  country  level  include  the  ministries  of  health,  women\u2019s \naffairs,  and  youth;  civil  society  and  nongovernment  organizations;  and  national  AIDS \ncommittees or their equivalent. Civil societies and nongovernment organizations have links with \nrepresentatives of vulnerable and high-risk groups and represent their interests through the \nregional mechanism for implementing the round 2-funded HIV/AIDS projects. \n \n16.  Implementation of the PRS will involve (i) the development and implementation of a \nregional communications strategy that raises the profile of HIV among regional policy makers \nand opinion leaders through advocacy and awareness- raising efforts; (ii) the development of \ngeneric  behavior  change  communication  materials  that  can  be  readily  adapted  to  the \ninformation needs of different PICTs; and (iii) data from better surveillance of HIV infections and \nbehaviors will providing opportunities to share across the region through networks. \n \n   ", "    Appendix 3  29 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n \n1.  The Pacific region has three major regional HIV/AIDS projects that all fall within the \noverarching guiding principles of the Pacific Regional Strategy on HIV/AIDS 2004-2008 (PRS)   \n(Appendix 3): (i) the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM); (ii) the \nPacific Regional HIV/AIDS Project, funded by the Australian and French governments; and (iii) \nthe Regional Sexually Transmitted Infection(STI)/HIV/AIDS Development Program of the Joint \nUnited Nations Program on HIV/AIDS\u2019 (UNAIDS). In addition, bilateral donors such as France \nand New Zealand are active in HIV/AIDS and STI prevention, treatment, and care activities at \nthe national level. In all cases, every donor has been assigned specific activities under the PRS \nImplementation Plan (PRSIP). \n \nA.   The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria \n \n2.  GFATM was established in 2001 to increase resources to fight three of the world's most \ndevastating diseases\u2014HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria\u2014and to direct those resources to \nareas of greatest need. As a partnership between governments, civil society, private sectors, \nand  affected  communities,  GFATM  represents  an  innovative  approach  toward  international \nhealth  financing.  Its  funds  provide  for  products,  such  as  antiretrovirals  and  other  drugs, \ncondoms, and diagnostic equipment. Currently 55% of committed funds go for the purchase of \ndrugs and other commodities, and the rest is used to strengthen infrastructure and expand the \ntraining of health care workers and support personnel.  \n \n3.  GFATM finances programs over a period of 5 years by first committing money for 2 \nyears and then for an additional 3, depending on the results achieved during the first phase. \nTotal pledges by all donors through the end of 2008 amount to $5.4 billion. These donors \ninclude 45 countries (Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the United States, and several European \ncountries), major foundations, and private donors. GFATM has approved a total of $3.1 billion \nover 2 years to almost 300 programs in 127 countries and 3 territories. \n \n4.   GFATM has had five rounds of applications. The call for applications for round 5 of \nfinancing was closed in June 2005 and is currently being reviewed. In 2002, 11 small Pacific \n1\nisland countries  applied for round 2 and were approved for a multicountry HIV/AIDS grant of \n$6.034 million to be implemented and coordinated by staff of the Secretariat of the Pacific \nCommunity (SPC). The 5-year Pacific Islands Regional Multicountry Project, which is still being \nimplemented, aims at (i) strengthening STI, HIV, and behavioral surveillance in five countries \nand enhancing laboratory capacity, including blood safety; (ii) improving STI and HIV services \nby 2007; and (iii) reducing the risk of HIV and other STIs through targeted interventions.  \n \n5.  Specific activities under the Pacific Islands Regional Multicountry Project include (i) \nholding workshops and planning meetings for HIV surveys to be conducted in six sites (Fiji \nIslands, Kiribati, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu) ($44,000); (ii) strengthening \nregional and local laboratories ($120,607); (iii) improving STI and HIV services by developing \ncurricula, training health staff and traditional healers, holding workshops, and providing drugs \n($75,973); (iv) developing a comprehensive care, treatment, and support system by conducting \nneeds assessments ($15,000); and (v) reducing the spread of HIV and STIs by means of \ntargeted  interventions  for  youth  by  developing  information,  education,  and  communication \n                                                 \n1  Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, \nTuvalu, and Vanuatu. \n   ", "30  Appendix 3                   \n             \nmaterials, distributing condoms, conducting training of trainer programs for peer educators, and \ndeveloping advocacy programs.  \n \n6.  Despite successful implementation of GFATM round 2, specific funding gaps exist in the \nfollowing  high-priority  areas:  (i)  advocating  condom  use,  including  distribution  and  social \nmarketing; (ii) working intensively with vulnerable and high-risk individuals (for example, STI \npatients, mobile populations, transactional sex workers, men who have sex with men, and the \npartners of these people); (iii) scaling up voluntary confidential counseling and testing services \nand ensuring good access by vulnerable and high-risk groups; and (iv) adopting an aggressive \napproach to strengthening STI diagnosis and treatment. To address some of these gaps, 14 \nPacific  island  countries  submitted  a  proposal  for  GFATM  round  5  for  $9.946  million.  This \nproposal  was  developed  through  extensive  consultative  processes  with  stakeholders  from \nministries  of  health  and  civil  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  with  country \ncoordinating mechanisms.2  \n \nB.  Bilateral Donors \n \n  1.  Australia \n \n7.  Australia has two regional HIV/AIDS-related projects in the Pacific. The 5-year Pacific \nRegional HIV Project (PRHP) commenced in 2004, with A$12.5 million in funding from the \nGovernment of Australia and \u20ac1 million from the Government of France. (SPC, in cooperation \nwith  other  institutions,  is  responsible  for  implementing  this  project.  The  PRHP  has  been \ndesigned  to  help  strengthen  the  capacity  of  Pacific  island  governments,  NGOs,  and \ncommunities to develop, implement, and evaluate multisectoral responses to HIV/AIDS. The \nproject  is  a  direct  response  to  the  need  for  cooperation,  planning,  technical  design,  and \nmanagement and evaluation of HIV/AIDS responses in the Pacific. The PRHP consolidates \nprogress made under earlier regional initiatives and assists countries to develop or strengthen \nmultisectoral  national  planning  and  response.  In  addition,  Australia  and  New  Zealand  are \ncofunding a UNAIDS program coordinator position in the amount of A$246,000 for 3 years \n(2003\u22122006).  The  position  is  important  for  coordinating  United  Nations  activities  that  will \ncomplement  the  new  regional  HIV/AIDS  project.  The  project  aims  to  increase  political \nunderstanding and commitment, strengthen the management and surveillance of STIs, and \nimprove care for people with HIV/AIDS. \n \n8.  The PRHP contributed to the development of a regional strategy on HIV/AIDS, including \na  regional  communications  strategy  and  enhancement  of  HIV/AIDS  and  STI  surveillance \ncapacity  in  the  region.  Today  the  PRHP  assists  the  capacity  development  of  national \ngovernments and NGOs to effectively implement HIV/AIDS and STI prevention and control \nactivities. The second component of the PRHP incorporates a grant facility to support local \nprojects. The aim of the scheme is to provide both government and NGOs of 14 independent \nstates  in  the  Pacific3  with  access  to  funds  that  will  contribute  to  the  development  and \nimplementation  of  their  multisectoral,  national  HIV/AIDS  and  STI  strategic  plans.  This  will \n                                                 \n2  PDMCs that were consulted include Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall \nIslands, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Island, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Regional organizations that were \nconsulted include the Fiji School of Medicine, International Federation of Red Cross, Marie Stopes International, \nInternational Planned Parenthood Federation, the United Nations system, Institute of Applied Legal Studies, \nPeople Islands AIDS Foundation, Pacific Regional HIV/AIDS Project, and Wan Smol Bag.  \n3  The 14 countries are Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, \nFederated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and \nVanuatu. \n   ", "    Appendix 3  31 \nsupport the functions of national AIDS councils or their equivalent, ensure a local response to \nidentified priorities, and enable effective scaling up of national HIV/AIDS responses by offering \nsupport to a wider range of organizations. To date, this project has helped 12 of the 14 countries \ndevelop national strategic plans.4  \n \n  2.  France \n \n9.  In  the  Pacific,  France  concentrates  on  francophone  countries,  including  French \nPolynesia,  Maurice  Island,  New  Caledonia,  Seychelles,  Vanuatu,  and  Wallis  and  Futuna. \nFrance, together with Australia, established the Franco-Australian Pacific Regional HIV/AIDS \nand STI Initiative (component 1 of the PRHP). The goal of the initiative is to reduce the \nvulnerability to and impact of HIV/AIDS in Pacific island countries and territories (PICTs). The \npurpose is to strengthen the capacity of Pacific island governments, NGOs, and communities to \nundertake an effective, sustainable, multisectoral response to HIV/AIDS. The project identifies a \nregionally coordinated approach as integral to preventing HIV transmission within and between \nPICTs. The project supported the development of the Pacific Regional Strategy on HIV/AIDS \n2004-2008, which sets the groundwork for a regional coordinated response to HIV/AIDS in the \nPacific. In addition, on a regional basis, France funds A$2,119,262 for surveillance and survey \nactivities  through  SPC.  Specifically,  France  is  funding  a  regional  surveillance  specialist  in \nNoumea, New Caledonia, and funds surveys in countries that are not covered under GFATM. \n  \n  3.  New Zealand \n \n10.  New Zealand is committed to ensuring that the eight Millennium Development Goals are \nreached by 2015 by focusing specifically on three of the goals: goal 4: reduce child mortality; \ngoal 5: improve maternal health; and goal 6: combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases. \nNew Zealand's core geographical focus in health is the Pacific region.  \n \n11.  Regionally, New Zealand is spending NZ$730,000 to fund the Pacific Islands AIDS \nFoundation for 3 years. The organization works to raise awareness and mobilize support for \nHIV/AIDS action in the Pacific by promoting positive living, positive health, positive partnerships, \nand  positive  action  and  prevention.  Furthermore,  New  Zealand  contributes  NZ$175,000 \nannually to a direct mail project that distributes information on safe sex and condoms by mail. \nThe project allows people in remote and urban areas to access information confidentially. \nAdvertisements  in  newspapers  and  on  the  radio  and  a  web  site  inform  people  about  the \navailability of free information. Since the service became available in November 2002, it has \ndealt with more than 8,500 requests and distributed 200,000 condoms. Safe sex information is \nalso distributed through night clubs, taxi stands, shoeshine boys, and street boys.  \n  \n  4.  United Nations System \n \n12.  The United Nations agencies present in the Pacific (World Health Organization, United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund, United Nations Population Fund, United Nations Development Fund \nfor Women, International Labor Organization, and United Nations Development Programme) are \ncollectively working with UNAIDS to carry out work on HIV/AIDS from the perspectives of their \ndifferent mandates. Their efforts have included reviewing the sexual abuse and exploitation of \nchildren and developing school curricula (United Nations Children\u2019s Fund); providing support for \n                                                 \n4  The French government added funds to this project to support improved second-generation surveillance in the \nFrench-affiliated territories. Six US-affiliated islands, such as Guam and the Northern Marianas, are included \nthrough funding from the United States.   \n   ", "32  Appendix 3                   \n             \nlocal condom social marketing (United Nations Population Fund); reviewing HIV-related legal \nissues (United Nations Development Programme); providing laboratory support, training in the \ntreatment and care of HIV-infected patients, and holding a workshop on second-generation \nsurveillance (World Health Organization); and holding meetings with the police, the military, and \nother occupational groups about workplace policies (International Labor Organization, UNAIDS). \nUNAIDS has used its project acceleration funds for a variety of small projects. In addition, the \nAsia-Pacific Leadership Forum, funded by the Australian Agency for International Development, \nthe  US  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  others,  has  been  working  to  develop \nadvocacy capacity among government, religious, private industry, and community leaders.    \n \n12.  UNAIDS is the main advocate for global action on HIV/AIDS by leading an expanded \nresponse to the epidemic. In the Pacific, UNAIDS has been providing ongoing technical advice \nand support to ministry of health focal points and liaising with the National Advisory Committee \non AIDS. In addition, UNAIDS, together with the Asia Pacific Leadership Forum, aims to (i) \nincrease political understanding of and commitment to HIV/AIDS and development issues, (ii) \nstrengthen STI management and surveillance, (iii) create a more caring and compassionate \nenvironment  for  people  living  with  HIV/AIDS  and  their  families,  (iv)  increase  the  extent  of \ncondom use to help prevent HIV and STIs, (v) strengthen civil society organizations dealing with \nHIV/AIDS, and (vi) reduce high-risk behavior by young people. \n \n13.  The International Labor Organization seeks to mobilize the labor sector in reducing the \nspread and impact of HIV/AIDS while embracing people infected and affected by the virus in \nPacific  communities.  For  the  Pacific,  this  goal  includes  (i)  creating  and  implementing  a \nregulatory environment that supports good practices in relation to HIV/AIDS in the workplace, (ii) \nhaving employers and employees develop workplace policies, and (iii) having employers adopt \na wider community response to HIV.  \n \n14.  The United Nations Population Fund, together with the United Nations Educational, \nScientific, and Cultural Organization, is engaged in helping ministries of education integrate sex \neducation, through secondary school curricula. The United Nations Population Fund office in \nSuva, Fiji Islands, is responsible for an HIV/AIDS program in the South Pacific subregion and \ncontributes  to  the  (i)  strengthening  of  PICT  capacity  to  develop,  implement,  monitor,  and \nevaluate  multisectoral  national  HIV/AIDS  strategic  plans;  (ii)  the  creation  of  a  supportive \nenvironment for HIV/AIDS responses; and (iii) the improvement of service delivery systems for \nHIV prevention.5\n \n15.  The World Health Organization has provided technical support throughout the Pacific to \ndevelop plans and conduct training in relation to AIDS and STIs and has helped ministries of \nhealth strengthen STI services and review alternative testing strategies for HIV. In Kiribati, for \nexample, The World Health Organization assisted the Ministry of Health to conduct a cross-\nsectional  survey  of  STI  prevalence  that  collected  demographic,  behavioral,  and  clinical \ninformation from about 400 seafarers and women. The World Health Organization serves as the \nlead agency within the United Nations system for HIV/AIDS treatment, care, and support and for \npreventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV.  \n                                                 \n5 The subregion includes the following countries: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, \nMarshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.  \n   ", "    Appendix 3  33 \n \nC.  International Nongovernment Organizations \n \n16.  Across the region, a range of local, regional, and international NGOs is implementing \nHIV/AIDS  and  STI  activities  along  with  comprehensive  sexual  and  reproductive  health \nprograms. NGOs active in HIV/AIDS prevention programs in many PICTs include the Red \nCross, the National Council of Women, the National Council of Churches, youth councils, and \nthe Council of Chiefs.  \n \n17.  The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent supports activities \nfocusing on safe blood and HIV/AIDS implemented under GFATM. In 2004, the International \nRed Cross in the Pacific improved the quality of ongoing first aid training and promoted blood \ndonor recruitment through a series of targeted workshops at the national level. Guidelines have \nbeen developed to promote the integration of HIV/AIDS awareness into all core programs of \nnational Red Cross societies. A project using puppet shows to disseminate information about \nHIV/AIDS was implemented in Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, and Samoa. Other activities in the fight \nagainst HIV/AIDS are being implemented in 11 PICTS6 and include (i) safe blood activities; (ii) \nHIV education and prevention programs through national societies, including peer education; \n(iii) care and support programs; (iv) advocacy; and (v) anti stigmatization and discrimination \ncampaigns. \n  \n18.  One of the most influential NGOs in the region is the church. Regional seminars on \nHIV/AIDS prevention and education involving key church leaders have been conducted, and \nsome church groups support sexual and reproductive health issues. For example, the World \nCouncil  of  Churches  in  the  Pacific  brought  together  religious  leaders  from  various  Pacific \ncountries, including Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Papua \nNew Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, to address the HIV/AIDS \nissue from theological, cultural, and sociological perspectives. The meeting culminated in the \nNadi  Declaration,  which  states  the  churches\u2019 commitment  to  HIV-positive  people  and  sets \npriorities for the churches in improving knowledge about HIV/AIDS. \n                                                 \n6  The 11 countries are Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Papua \nNew Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.  \n   ", "34  Appendix 4                   \n             \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nReduction of the  A trend of decreased  Regional Millennium  \u2022  The baseline \nspread and impact of  incidence of HIV by  Development Goal reports  prevalence of HIV/AIDS \nHIV/AIDS in the  2012  produced by the United  is as low as it is \nPacific    Nations Development  currently believed to be \n  Reduced economic and  Programme  or at least within a \nsocial impact of the    range of 10%. \nHIV/AIDS epidemic  Regional reports by  \u2022  Regional programs \n  UNAIDS  such as GFATM \nReduced mortality and    continue to support \nmorbidity attributed to  Monitoring and evaluation  HIV/AIDS efforts in the \nAIDS in the region  reports of the Pacific  Pacific. \nRegional Strategy on   \nHIV/AIDS 2004\u20132008  Risks \n  \u2022  The economic situation \nUNGASS reports  in PDMCs worsens and \n  detracts governments\u2019 \nattention from HIV/AIDS \nefforts. \n\u2022  Other health issues \nassume greater urgency \nin PDMCs and detract \nhealth authorities\u2019 \nattention and focus. \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved  By 2009, HIV infection  Regional reports by  \u2022  The Secretariat of the \nmanagement and  rates in vulnerable  UNAIDS and the World  Pacific Community is \ndelivery of HIV/AIDS  populations are no  Health Organization  able to retain its \nprevention activities  more than 1%    HIV/AIDS staffing and \nin the Pacific through    Monitoring and evaluation  expertise. \nthe targeting of  reports of the Pacific   \nvulnerable  Regional Strategy on   \npopulations  HIV/AIDS 2004\u20132008 \n   \nUNGASS reports \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Project Objectives \n \n1.  The overall objective of the Project is to reduce the spread and impact of HIV/AIDS in \nthe Pacific. The outcome of the Project will be to consolidate the effective prevention responses \nbeing undertaken by the Pacific developing member countries and the various key stakeholders \nactive in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The project outcomes are (i) improved targeting and \nmanagement of HIV/AIDS in the Pacific; (ii) improved coverage of prevention and care of HIV in \nvulnerable populations, in particular seafarers, men who have sex with men, commercial sex \nworkers,  and  young  people;  (iv)  enhanced  management  of  non-HIV  sexually  transmitted \ninfections (STIs) through the establishment of a network of STI clinics; and (iii) focused project \nmanagement. \n \nB.  Project Beneficiaries \n \n2.  Research  conducted  by  the  Commission  on  Macroeconomics  and  Health  20011 \nindicates that high prevalence of diseases such as malaria or HIV/AIDS is associated with \nsignificantly lower rates of economic growth. For example, the impact of HIV/AIDS on the \nannual rate of economic growth ranges from 0 to 0.2% increase in adult prevalence.2  \n \n3.  Investments  resulting  in  a  decrease  in  disease  prevalence,  are  therefore;  likely  to \ngenerate  considerable  national  economic  benefits.  Infectious  diseases  tend  to \ndisproportionately affect poor people who suffer from poor nutrition and often live in crowded \nconditions. The proposed project interventions have been designed to specifically address the \npoor  through  capacity  development,  improved  access  to  health  facilities,  and  provision  of \nequipment and drugs in areas of priority need. Marginalized women are at particular risk of \nbeing drawn into commercial sex work, where the risk of HIV infection is high. \n \n4.  A number of vulnerable groups in the region, which include seafarers, transport workers, \nmembers  of  the  military,  and  participants  in  international  peacekeeping,  are  sources  of \nremittances  and  generate  significant  export  earnings  for  many  Pacific  nations.  Increased \nprevalence among these groups would result in decreased revenues for dependent families and \nin some cases reduced performance of national economies. Investment in interventions to curb \ninfection among these subpopulations would therefore have significant positive economic and \nequity impacts. \n \nC.  Rationale for Investment \n \n5.  The total Asian Development Bank (ADB) investment of $8.0 million for this Project will \nfocus  on  infectious  disease  prevention  and  care  activities  that  the  private  market  has \nundersupplied. A key element of the Project will be capacity development to enhance the \nPacific\u2019s response to the pandemic. A number of training activities will be pursued within each of \nthe  components,  including  training  in  surveillance  techniques  and  improved  STI  case \nmanagement and support for HIV-positive people.  \n \n6.  The  private  market  also  undersupplies  health  information  and  products  because  of \nincomplete information about the benefits of investments in health and nutrition and how to \n                                                 \n1  WHO. 2001.

Unpublished.  \n ", "46  Appendix 9 \nmake  such  investments  cost  effective;  externalities  in  some  markets;  differences  between \nprivate and social discount rates leading to private decisions that do not adequately reflect long-\nterm benefits; and intrahousehold decision making that favors adults (especially male adults) \nover  children  (especially,  girls),  leading  to  under-investment  in  children\u2019s  human  capital, \nespecially in girls\u2019 human capital, relative to socially desired levels.3  \n \n7.  The targeting of activities will ensure that vulnerable groups that are not often reached \nwill benefit from HIV prevention and care interventions, because interventions such as youth \neducation, seafarer training materials, and enhanced capacity of nongovernment organizations \nthat support men who have sex with men and commercial sex workers are central to investment \nwithin component 3. \n \nD.  Cost-Benefit Analysis \n \n8.  The quantitative cost-benefit analysis for the Project follows the methodologies outlined \nin  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.4  Key  assumptions  include  the \nfollowing: \n(i)  Discount rate. The economic opportunity cost of capital was assumed to be \n12%. Most health project analyses use 3% as a discount factor; therefore, future \nbenefits are likely to be given greater value. To harmonize this analysis with \nother project appraisal in non-health sectors, a higher discount rate is used.  \n(ii)  Projection of project benefits and costs. The period of analysis covers 20 \nyears and benefits and costs are converted into constant 2006 dollar prices.  \n(iii)  Economic cost of labor. The opportunity cost of labor or the shadow wage rate \n(SWR) for both urban and rural adults was calculated at $2,000 per year.5  \n \nE.  Economic Costs \n \n9.  Base investment costs are in constant 2006 dollar prices. Taxes and duties account for a \nsmall proportion of the project costs. Incremental recurrent costs are calculated for the 20 years \nfollowing the five-year project implementation period.  \n \nF.  Economic Benefits \n \n10.  The Project will improve the socioeconomic condition of the target beneficiaries. Key \nproject benefits are to be estimated in the following ways: (i) cost savings due to increased \nhealth awareness and reduced disease prevalence, and (ii) enhanced income of both rural and \nurban income earners who care for the sick. Costs and benefits are outlined in Table A9.1 for \ninvestment and recurrent expenditures over a 20-year projection. \n \n                                                 \n3  Knowles, J. 2003.

Improved HIV and STI management will reduce the burden of these diseases and \ngenerate economic benefits largely through reduced out-of-pocket expenditures and decrease \ncosts associated with lost labor through elevated numbers of sick days. In summary, key \nbenefits include cost savings due to increased health awareness and improved HIV and STI \ncontrol and increased incomes because of the reduction in time taken off work as sick leave or \nto care for sick family members.  \n \n12.  Resource or out-of-pocket savings may flow from (i) increased access to health services \nto reduce transport costs; and (ii) more efficient and rational diagnosis and treatment to reduce \ncost of treatment.6 Improvements in health status as a result of health awareness activities lead \nto significant decreases in out-of-pocket health expenditures.

Adults often have to care for sick children, or they may contract an infectious disease \nthemselves and suffer reduced work productivity and foregone income because of premature \ndeath. The nature of these productivity losses have received limited attention in the literature, \nalthough demographic and household surveys indicate that considerable time is lost through \ntransportation of HIV/AIDS-affected family members to health facilities in Africa and Asia.10 \nAssumptions  used  to  estimate  the  economic  impacts  of  current  levels  of  prevalence  are \nprovided in Table A9.2. \n \nG.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n14.  The Project is estimated to lead to the avoidance of nearly 4,000 HIV infections across \n10 Pacific countries over a 20-year period and to an annual decrease in STI cases of nearly \n2,000 per year. The EIRR from this impact is estimated to be 16%, and an economic net \npresent value (NPV) of $3.1 million is calculated. \n \nH.  Financial Sustainability Analysis \n \n15.  The Project\u2019s recurrent costs include the procurement of medical supplies for STI clinics \nand  ongoing  institutional  support  for  surveillance.  These  costs  represent  only  a  small \npercentage of government health expenditures in the 10 target Pacific nations. Overall, they \nrepresent less than 3% of central government expenditures in the relevant countries, but note \nthat health expenditures vary considerably across the implementation area.

Likewise, central government contributions to overall health spending vary from 2.9% in \nTuvalu to 16.0% in Samoa. As a percentage of government health spending, recurrent costs \nfrom the ADB supported project are likely to be minimal, that is, less than 5%. \n \nJ.  Conclusions \n \n17.  The literature indicates that economic returns from investments in health have been \nsubstantial. The private market, however, fails to invest appropriately in health prevention and \ncare activities. Economic analysis suggests that investment in HIV/AIDS control in the Pacific \nwill be economically attractive and also financially sustainable. Vulnerable groups will be the key \nbeneficiaries from such investment, particularly young people and marginalized women. \n                                                 \n11 WHO. 2004.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Pacific region: \nProgress toward poverty reduction has taken place in all project countries. Health issues and access to health \nservices have been identified as high-priority areas for Pacific islanders in the participative poverty assessments \nundertaken in Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs). The region's economies are generally weak, and \nincreasingly  complex  issues,  including  disease  epidemics,  rapid  population  growth  and  urbanization,  and \nglobalization, demand attention.  \nIn recent decades, many PDMCs have achieved improvements in the area of health: life expectancy has increased, \ninfant and child mortality rates have decreased, and immunization coverage has been extensive. However, infectious \ndiseases such as tuberculosis, dengue fever, and malaria are on the rise. In addition, a worrying rise in the number \nof HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infection (STI) cases is apparent in several countries along with an equally \nworrying lack of data on the actual situation. As a result, many PDMCs are facing a double burden of prevention and \ntreatment of persistent, traditional, infectious ailments along with a rising tide of new and nonommunicable diseases.  \nUnder-reporting  of  HIV/AIDS  cases  and  the  lack  of  testing  facilities  have  resulted  in  relatively  low  HIV/AIDS \nprevalence rates being cited in official statistics. With the exception of Papua New Guinea, the major form of \ntransmission is through heterosexual contact. Even though HIV/AIDS prevalence rates are lower than in other regions, \nthe underlying social, cultural, economic, and demographic conditions are such that a similar rapid spread of the \ndisease is possible. These conditions include a youthful population with a high incidence of youth pregnancies and \nSTIs; movements in, through, and out of the region by mobile population groups; slow or negative economic growth \nand the consequential, lack of employment opportunities; and sociocultural practices that pattern the behavior of men \nand dictate the status of women. \n \nInfectious diseases tend to disproportionately affect poor people, who tend to suffer from poor nutrition and often live \nin crowded conditions. The proposed project interventions have been designed to specifically address these groups \nthrough developing capacity, improving access to health facilities, and providing equipment and drugs in areas of \npriority needs. Marginalized women are at particular risk of being drawn into commercial sex work, where the risk of \nHIV infection is, high, and special provisions will be made to address this issue. The Project will help reduce the \nspread and impact of HIV/AIDS and  other STIs in the project countries by (i) strengthening surveillance, (ii) \ncommunity-based interventions for HIV/AIDS prevention, and (iii) targeted interventions for vulnerable groups. The \noutcome of the Project will be improved management and delivery of HIV/AIDS prevention activities in the Pacific \nthrough the targeting of vulnerable populations. The Project will help minimize the social and economic impacts of \nHIV/AIDS and help target countries\u2019 progress toward their 2015 health-related Millennium Development Goals of \nreducing mortality rates and halting, to the extent possible, and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nMuch of the Pacific is still characterized by reliance on subsistence agriculture, although urbanization is increasing. \nParticipatory assessments of hardship in six PDMCsb revealed that hardship was equated with a lack of economic and \nemployment opportunities as a result of poor education, lack of access to land for gardens or cash crops, poor access \nto good water and sanitation facilities, poor health, and living alone or depending on others. These pre-existing factors \ncontribute to the spread of HIV/AIDS and other STIs.  \n \n ", "    Appendix 10  51\n \nHIV/AIDS has significant socioeconomic impacts on poor people, diverting scarce resources into health care and \nremoving the ability to work. The Project will focus on strengthening surveillance and implementing community-based \ninterventions for HIV/AIDS prevention. These will include targeting people at high risk, such as women, commercial  \nseafarers and their partners, individuals with STIs; mobile populations (including international peacekeepers and \nindividuals involved in international tourism ventures), prisoners, commercial and transactional sex workers, and men \nwho have sex with men (including indigenous sexual minorities such as fa\u2019afafine and fakaleiti). Project activities will \nbenefit those at high risk, but will also benefit the poor and other vulnerable groups because of specific provisions that \nwill be made. The poor and vulnerable suffer from a higher burden of diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, and have \nlimited access to both public and private health services. By improving people\u2019s health situation, especially among  \nvulnerable groups or the poor, the Project will reduce the burden of HIV/AIDS and STIs and generate economic and \nsocial benefits as follows: (i) increased health awareness activities will lead to improvements in health status, which \ndecreases out-of-pocket expenditures; (ii) increased STI treatment and administration of antiretroviral drugs will \ndecrease the number of people having to miss work; and (iii) increased HIV/AIDS and STI awareness will lead to \nbetter preventive measure, increased tolerance for people living with HIV/AIDS, and reduce discrimination against \npeople living with HIV/AIDS at the work place and in the household. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nThe Project design took into account the inputs of key stakeholders in the development of the Pacific Regional \nStrategy (PRS) on HIV/AIDS 2004\u20132008 as well as the consultative process used to develop the PRS Implementation \nPlan. The design also took advantage of the consultative processes and mechanisms used to develop the Global \nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM) round 5 submission in June 2005. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) is a member of the GFATM Country Consultative Mechanism, which monitors the two GFATM projects. \nPrimary  institutional  stakeholders  include  ministries  of  health,  women\u2019s  affairs,  and  youth;  civil  society,  and \nnongovernment organizations. These organizations have existing links with representatives from vulnerable and high-\nrisk groups and represent their interests through regional GFATM round 2 activities and mechanisms.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe project design took into account the existing participation mechanism for developing the PRS. The stakeholders\u2019 \ninvolvement will continue during project implementation. The PRS is the result of extensive consultation among \nnational health representatives, regional organizations, and bilateral and multilateral donors. The Project will build on \nthese existing mechanisms and ensure that a participation strategy is integrated into overall project implementation. \nThe targeting of vulnerable people in the Project will require extensive consultations, focus group discussions, \nsurveys, and so on to design activities that are most appropriate for the target group. These activities will be \nincorporated into the Project.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \n The PRS recognizes that HIV/AIDS is a gender issue and that the age at which women are being infected is \ndecreasing. The PRS addresses gender issues by encouraging equitable attention to and participation by women in \nregional HIV/AIDS activities. Estimates indicate that under current major HIV/AIDS projects, between 50% and 65% of \ntarget beneficiaries are women. The ADB Project falls under the overarching goal of the PRS and will complement or \nexpand on current activities. Every component of the Project will address gender issues. \n \n The sector analysis identifies women as being particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS for various reasons, notably, their \nsocioeconomic status and lack of power in national and community decision-making processes. Currently, many \nwomen in the Pacific are in single--partner relationships and/or are homemakers, but are accounting for an increase in \nHIV/AIDS infections because their partners often have multiple sex partners. For example, the wives of seafarers and \nother mobile workers are highly vulnerable to becoming infected with HIV by their husbands. Thus HIV/AIDS \nawareness workshops for seafarers and other mobile populations will be coupled with workshops for seafarers\u2019 wives. \nThese workshops will ensure that the maximum number of women can participate through rapid needs assessments \nthat will be conducted ahead of time.  \n \n Has an output been prepared?
