I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Irrigation Management Improvement Project.1 \n \n2.  The project is designed to realize the full production potential of large-scale irrigation \nschemes in Bangladesh. It will address the recurrent lack of sustainable management, operation, \nand maintenance (MOM) and increase water productivity by transferring MOM schemes to \nprivate operators and introducing innovative infrastructure modernization.2  The project will focus \non modernizing the Muhuri Irrigation Project (MIP) in Chittagong division. It will also finance a \nfeasibility study and detailed design for modernizing the Ganges\u2013Kobadak Irrigation Project in \nKhulna division and the Teesta Irrigation Project in Rangpur division.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The  primary  sources  of  water  in  Bangladesh  are  local  rainfall  (about  250  cubic \nkilometers  (km3)  annually)  and  transboundary  inflows  (about  1,000  km3  annually),  derived \nmainly from the Brahmaputra, Ganges, and Meghna rivers. Bangladesh occupies only 8% of the \ntotal drainage area of these rivers but is located at their downstream end. The result is an \nabundant excess of surface water during the summer monsoon months and water shortfalls \nduring  the  winter  dry  months.  The  impossibility  of  developing  dam  facilities  prevents  flow \nregulation throughout the year.  Despite being scarce, water is not well managed.  Minimal \nattention  is  given  to  water  use  efficiency  and  equitable  allocation.  Many  farmers  rely  on \ngroundwater to supplement the limited and irregular surface water supplies. However, in many \nareas, the use of groundwater is significantly constrained by arsenic contamination and aquifer \nlimitations. Consequently, the minimum flows required to meet total dry season demands are \nless than what is available from surface and groundwater. Competition for water is increasing \nbetween sectors including agriculture, domestic and industrial water use, navigation, fisheries, \nand conservation of natural eco-habitats. Possible changes in temperature and rainfall patterns \ndue to global warming may also modify crop-water requirements and water availability, and \nadversely widen the current gap between supply and demand. \n \n4.  Performance of irrigated agriculture and large irrigation schemes. In 2010, 31.5% \nof  the  population  was  living  below  the  poverty  line.  Although  agriculture\u2019s  share  of  gross \ndomestic product has declined, it is the primary economic sector in rural areas and provides \n63% of rural employment. Bangladesh has a net cultivable area of around 8 million hectares \n(ha). In FY2012, about 5.3 million ha were irrigated; total rice production was 33.5 million tons \nwith 56% being produced during the dry season.3 Irrigated agriculture productivity remains \nchronically  low;  since  FY2004  paddy  yields  have  averaged  3.6  tons/ha.4 The  low  land \nproductivity  is  attributable  to  unreliable  irrigation  supply;  inadequate  agriculture  extension \nservices; and poor access to farm inputs, markets, and agricultural credit services. Around \n550,000 ha or 11% of the total irrigated area is under large irrigation schemes.5 However, only \n46% of this area is currently irrigated during the dry season.   \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.   \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for Preparing the \nIrrigation Management Improvement Project (TA 8154-BAN). \n3  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2011.

Dhaka. \n5  Large irrigation schemes have command areas of 2,000 ha or more. ", "2   \n5.  The lack of efficient and sustainable MOM continues to impact the productivity of large \nirrigation  schemes.  In  2012,  MOM  cost  recovery  from  project  beneficiaries  of  the  Muhuri, \nGanges\u2013Kobadak, and Teesta irrigation schemes averaged 24%: Muhuri 63%, Teesta 18%, \nand Ganges\u2013Kobadak 0.26%. As a consequence, the schemes\u2019 infrastructure is degraded and \nneeds  rehabilitation  and  modernization.  Other  factors  include  inadequate  government \nfinancing,6 lack of beneficiary empowerment and engagement in MOM, and limited capacity of \npublic agencies resulting in weak service delivery. Specific issues in MIP are (i) inadequate \nbudget  for  system  MOM;  (ii)  lack  of  distinction  between  annual,  periodic,  or  emergency \nmaintenance of a system; and (iii) poor cost recovery from water management groups.7  \n \n6.  Since 2000 substantial efforts have been made to improve irrigation MOM through the \nintroduction of participatory irrigation management, which has been generally successful on \nsmall and medium-sized schemes in Bangladesh but yielded limited results for large schemes. \nThe variable performance of participatory irrigation management in improving irrigation MOM is \ninternationally documented and private sector participation through public\u2013private partnership \n(PPP) is seen as an alternative approach. It has demonstrated promising results in a few \ndeveloping countries such as Brazil, Ethiopia, and Morocco but is still to be developed in Asia. \nIn  2009,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  the \nBangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) to examine alternative approaches of service \ndelivery agreements and management arrangements including PPP for sustainable irrigation \nMOM in large irrigation schemes.8 The TA proposed a conceptual framework for engaging a \nthird party operator to address the shortcomings of the MIP\u2019s MOM. It established the basis for \nthe social and economic feasibility of the approach and confirmed farmers\u2019 willingness to pay. \n \n7.   The National Water Policy, adopted in 1999, sets out a comprehensive framework for \nthe water sector in general and for large surface water irrigation schemes, including a strategic \nvision comprising private irrigation MOM through leasing, concession, or management contracts. \nThe government has established policy, legal, institutional, and planning frameworks for the \nwater sector, which provide a suitable environment for developing necessary sector reforms. \nThe Water Act, promulgated in May 2013, revised and consolidated existing laws that govern \nthe ownership, utilization, and financial management of water.  \n \n8.  The  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015  recognizes  the  need  to  increase  agricultural \nproductivity, foster crop diversification, and boost public spending on rural infrastructure.9 The \nplan also presents a strategic direction for medium- and large-scale surface water irrigation. At \nits highest level, the strategy focuses on modernization and improved management of existing \nirrigation systems  and expansion of irrigation areas. To reduce public costs in sustainably \noperating these schemes and to improve delivery service, the strategy encourages the use of \nPPP wherever appropriate. As part of an overall investment program for the water sector, the \ngovernment has approved an investment plan to rehabilitate and modernize all large surface \nwater irrigation schemes at an estimated total cost of $745 million. The project will support the \nmodernization of the MIP\u2019s infrastructure and MOM, including transferring MOM to the private \nsector. The project will finance preparation of a modernization strategy, including feasibility \nstudies and detail designs, for the Ganges\u2013Kobadak and Teesta irrigation projects. \n                                                \n6  The government\u2019s budget appropriation for maintenance met about 50% of requirements for the three schemes. \n7  For 2009\u20132010, the budget was $126,000 against a demand for $710,000; the irrigation service charge was \n$12,000 against a target of $430,000. \n8  ADB. 2009.

MIP construction was completed in 1986. The design enabled dry season irrigation as \nwell as supplemental wet season irrigation by constructing the Feni Closure Dam and Regulator \nto create a reservoir downstream of the confluence of the Feni, Muhuri, and Kalidash\u2013Pahalia \nrivers. The backwater from the barrage enters the natural khals (channels) and canal network \nby gravity. From there it was to be lifted by about 800 low-lift diesel pumps to irrigate the fields. \nThe project was to increase the dry season rice area from about 6,000 ha to 20,000 ha. Initially, \nfarmers experienced major improvements in production and were able to cultivate much larger \nareas with rice; however, siltation of the reservoir and khals due to lack of maintenance and \nreduced runoff in the river has reduced the benefits over the years. The area irrigated in the dry \nseason decreased to 11,300 ha. The increased cost of diesel fuel combined with low pump \nefficiency and decrease in the rice price contributed to discouraging farmers from cultivating. \nOpportunities to substantially increase water use efficiency and reduce pumping cost through \ninnovative  design  modernization  and  improved  MOM  were  identified  during  the  project \npreparatory TA and will be supported by the project. \n \n10.  The project is consistent with ADB's Strategy 202010 and country partnership strategy for \nBangladesh, 2011\u2013201511 by reinforcing core areas of operations (such as infrastructure and \nwater  resources  management)  and  investing  in  irrigation  infrastructure  modernization.  It \nproposes recruiting the private sector to achieve effective and sustainable management, which \nfollows five of the seven key thematic drivers of the  country partnership strategy: (i) good \ngovernance and capacity development, (ii) environmental sustainability and climate resilience, \n(iii) private sector development, (iv) gender equity, and (v) knowledge solutions through the \npromotion of innovative irrigation modernization designs. The project is in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 as it has a strong focus on improving water use \nefficiency and water productivity.12 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact will be sustained high growth in agriculture. The outcome will be increased \nproductivity and sustainability of the MIP. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  The project will have three outputs: \n(i)  Performance-based  irrigation  management  and  agriculture  support \nservices  established.  The  output  will  include  contracting  private  irrigation \nmanagement operator under 5-year performance-based management contracts. \nThe construction phase irrigation management operator (C-IMO) will supervise \nmodernization  works,  establish  sustainable  MOM,  and  provide  agricultural \nsupport services for the MIP. Efficient management systems will be adopted to \nmaximize water use efficiencies, and develop sustainable and reliable irrigation \nservice delivery. Viable and effective operation and maintenance (O&M) cost \nrecovery  mechanisms  will  be  set  up  to  achieve  100%  cost  recovery.  The \nobjective will be to bring the MIP scheme to the profitability and sustainability \nrequired to enable recruitment of a long-term (15 years) management phase \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2008.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.13 BWDB will be the executing agency. A PMU led by a \nproject director with at least the rank of superintending engineer will be established in BWDB\u2019s \nmain office in Dhaka. A project implementation unit will be established in the MIP, with a director \nappointed to supervise MIP modernization implementation in the field. For the Teesta and \nGanges\u2013Kobadak irrigation projects, a design support unit led by an executive engineer will be \nset up at each project site. The design support unit will support preparation of the modernization \nstrategy, feasibility,  and  detail  designs for  the two  schemes.  A  project  steering  committee \nchaired by the secretary of the Ministry of Water Resources and comprising representatives \nfrom  all  relevant  departments  will  review  project  progress,  resolve  critical  implementation \nissues,  and  provide  strategic  and  policy  guidance  when  required.  An  implementation \ncoordination committee will be established in the MIP under the leadership of the BWDB chief \nzonal  engineer  with  representatives  from  relevant  department  local  offices,  farmer \norganizations, and the C-IMO. The committee will be tasked with resolving conflicts and issues \nrelated  to  implementation  of  the  works  and  the  C-IMO  performance-based  management \ncontract. \n \n16.  Additional financing may be considered if the project performs well. The output (iii) of the \nproject will support the preparation of additional financing. These include feasibility studies and \ndetail designs for modernizing the Ganges\u2013Kobadak and Teesta irrigation projects. \n \n17.  For the MIP, BWDB will recruit a private consulting company or consortium through \ncompetitive selection and enter into a 5-year management contract agreement. The C-IMO will \nbe responsible for (i) the delivery of efficient service and revenue collection to recover the cost \nfor MOM, (ii) construction supervision of MIP civil works, (iii) participatory design of level 3 \nsystem modernization,14 and (iv) development of pilot agricultural demonstrations and income \ngenerating activities. It is envisaged that after 5 years the M-IMO will be recruited through a 15-\nyear lease contract to maintain the MOM levels established during the 5-year first stage. The \ncontract will be awarded through a competitive tender based on (i) a fixed fee for the lease with \nbidders presenting a financial offer for the water charge, or (ii) a predetermined water charge \n                                                \n13  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 Levels 1, 2, and 3 correspond to primary, secondary, and tertiary drainage and irrigation networks. \n ", "6   \nwith bidders presenting a financial offer for the lease. After 15 years, the contract will be \nretendered. \n \n18.  Procurement of works, goods, and services financed by ADB will be carried out in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nConsultant selection and engagement will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). In view of BWDB\u2019s lack of \nexperience with performance-based management contracts and the need to ensure expeditious \nmobilization, the government requested ADB to recruit the project management and design \nconsultant (PMDC) and the C-IMO. BWDB retains the responsibility for negotiating and signing \nthe contract with the PMDC and C-IMO, issuing the notice to proceed, and supervising their \nservices. The PMDC and C-IMO recruitment will adopt a 90:10 quality\u2013cost ratio since a high \nlevel of expertise is essential to design performance-based irrigation management approaches \nfor  the  Ganges\u2013Kobadak  and  Teesta  irrigation  projects  and  to  establish  a  strong  and \nsustainable  management  organization  for  the  MIP.  In  addition,  incentives  linked  to  the \nperformance of the C-IMO consultant will be paid against achievement of key milestones. \nBWDB,  with  support  from  the  PMDC,  will  monitor  the  C-IMO\u2019s  performance  against  the \nmilestones.  Least-cost  selection  will  be  used  for  small  consulting  assignments,  including \nexternal audits, independent safeguards monitoring, and simple studies. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  June 2014\u2013June 2019 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2019 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Project steering committee \nMinistry of Water Resources secretary (chair)  \nMinistry  of  Agriculture,  Ministry  of  Local  Government  Rural  Development  and \nCooperatives, Ministry of Environment and Forests, Economic Relations Division, \nImplementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division,  Planning  Commission, \nBangladesh Water Development Board, Department of Agriculture Extension, Ministry \nof Fisheries and Livestock  and a representative of the ADB \n(ii)   Executing agency   Bangladesh Water Development Board \n(iii)  Implementation unit  Project management unit in Dhaka and in the field (77 staff)  \nProcurement   International competitive bidding  8 contracts (works)  $34.00 million \nShopping  7 contracts  $0.31 million \nConsulting services   Project management and design  580 person-months (82  $7.10 million \n  consultant (quality- and cost-based  person-months \nselection)  international and 498 \nFull technical proposal 90:10  person-months national) \nConstruction phase irrigation  868 person-months (47  $8.00 million \nmanagement operator (quality- and cost- person-months \nbased selection)  international, 821 \nFull technical proposal 90:10  person-months national) \nPanel of experts  14 person-months (4  $0.15 million \nIndividuals  person-months \ninternational and 10 \nperson-months national) \nSafeguard monitoring, studies, audits  Several contracts  $0.30 million \n(least-cost selection) \n ", "7 \nAspects  Arrangements \nRetroactive financing  ADB may, subject to its policies and procedures, allow on request, advance \nand/or advance  contracting and retroactive financing of eligible expenditures incurred for civil works, \ncontracting  equipment, materials, and consulting services.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n  \n20.  The modernization of the MIP irrigation infrastructure will substantially improve water \ndelivery services and revenue collection for MOM, and promote overall water use efficiency. \nThe MIP modernization option relies on the latest innovations and is tailored for the scheme. \nThe MIP, which relies on low-lift pumps at the tertiary level, will adopt prepaid smart card meters \nand control systems combined with a piped tertiary distribution system. Pumping costs will be \nreduced by using efficient electric motors and axial pumps. Power surveys confirm that the \nadditional  load  of  5.8  megawatts  can  be  accommodated  under  the  current  and  planned \nsubstation capacity and power generation. As per regulation, the pumps would not operate \nduring the peak period from 5:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. As a precaution, mitigation measures were \nbuilt in the design to reduce the possible impact of load shedding. The project will test solar-\npowered pilot pumps.15 All technologies have been successfully adopted under the Barind Multi-\nPurpose Development Authority scheme, and local and regional capacity is sufficient to ensure \nquality  construction  and  maintenance.  The  MIP  modernization  program  will  bring  several \nbenefits including (i) estimated 39% water use efficiency gains from reduced conveyance losses \nand  adoption  of  volumetric  pricing;  (ii)  flexible,  on-demand  irrigation  supply  to  support \nintensification and diversification; (iii) 100% recovery of MOM costs through prepaid system with \na 10% reduction of pumping charges paid by farmers to pump operators; and (iv) a substantial \nmitigation of corruption risk by eliminating cash payments to pump operators. \n \n21.  Water balance studies for the MIP reassessed the maximum potential command areas, \nfactoring climate change impacts and transboundary issues. The water balance and land use \nstudies for MIP reveal that of a potential cultivable area of 38,600 ha, about 11,300 ha are \ncurrently irrigated from surface water during the  dry season. With efficiency gains through \nmodernization and crop diversification, the command area of combined schemes would be \nexpanded to about 17,000 ha. This factors climate change, which anticipates by 2050 a possible \nincrease in temperature of 2\u00b0C with increased monsoon rainfall pattern of 0%\u201320% and peak \n                                                \n15 The pilots were designed with the support of the Energy for All Initiative. \n ", "8   \nrainfall  intensities  of  around  15%.  Climate  adaptation  is  incorporated  into  the  design  by \nincreasing the drainage capacity from a 1:10-year to 1:25-year return period. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  Economic analysis undertaken for the MIP indicates that the project is economically \nviable. The project provides benefits by increasing the irrigated area from 11,300 ha to about \n17,000 ha, increasing crop intensity from 107% to 187%, increasing yields by up to 50% for \npaddy rice, and increasing cash crop production. The economic internal rate of return for the \nMIP is estimated at 21%. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the economic internal rate of \nreturn remains at 12% under the scenarios of project costs increasing by up to 103%, and \nproject  benefits  reducing  by  up  to  33%.  However,  incremental  benefits  to  the  project  are \nsensitive to a reduction in the area irrigated and construction delays. The direct beneficiaries of \nthe project are the MIP farmers and the benefit distribution analysis confirms that small farmers \nand sharecroppers will share a substantial proportion of the total project benefits. \n \n23.  Financial  analysis  was  carried  out  to  assess  the  conditions  for  ensuring  financial \nsustainability of the proposed M-IMO approach under the MIP and its affordability for farmers. \nCurrently, only 60% of the potential irrigable area is irrigated and farmers pay the tariff of \n$138/ha to  private  pump  operators.  Due to the  high  inefficiency  of the  diesel  pumps  and \nreduced command area, this tariff is only sufficient to cover the cost of pump O&M. It does not \ncover any other MOM costs, and this has led to the deterioration of the scheme infrastructure \nand its productivity. The project will increase the irrigated area to about 17,000 ha through \nincreased water use efficiency. It will reduce O&M pumping cost by switching from diesel to \nelectricity pumps. Combined, these will raise the overall revenue of the scheme to sufficiently \ncover its sustainable MOM. The farm budget analyses reveal that the farmers will generate an \naverage  income  of  $460/ha  (with  the  project)  as  against  $50/ha  (without  the  project).  In \nprinciple, farmers could afford to pay for the full cost of the capital investment and level 1 MOM; \nhowever, this would require raising the tariff to $260/ha, which is significantly more than they \ncurrently pay and hence may not be immediately acceptable.16 A tariff of $124/ha may be \nconsidered as an interim tariff. It would fully finance MOM of levels 2 and 3 of the system \nincluding a reasonable profit margin for the M-IMO. Once farmers\u2019 incomes increase to the level \nexpected at project completion, level 1 O&M cost may also be transferred to the farmers and the \nwater tariff would be increased by about $26/ha.17 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy  was explained and discussed with the government and \nBWDB.  Measures  are  included  in  the  project  to  mitigate  risks  including  (i)  independent \nconstruction supervision, (ii) reduced number of contracts, and (iii) provision of procurement \nexperts. Financial management and procurement capacity assessments of BWDB conclude that \nBWDB has sufficient experience and capacity to manage the project funds as well as adequate \nfund flow, accounting, and budgeting arrangements. However, improvements are required in \nseveral areas including (i) the need for a full-time accountant at the PMU, (ii) training in ADB \ndisbursement and procurement guidelines, (iii) requirement to produce internal audit reports for \nthe relevant zone and circle 6 months after project effectivity, and (iv) provision of a statement of \naudit needs to ensure that audited project financial statements are received on a timely basis.18 \n                                                \n16 Levels 1, 2, and 3 correspond to primary, secondary, and tertiary drainage and irrigation networks.  \n17 Excluding BWDB establishment costs. \n18 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n25.  The project is consistent with the broad development goal of the Sixth Five-Year Plan of \nBangladesh, which includes achieving food security, making adequate infrastructure available, \nand pursuing environment-friendly development. A poverty and social analysis was completed \nfor the MIP. The irrigation scheme modernization will reduce poverty incidence in the project \narea by about 7%.19 The beneficiaries will be marginal, small, medium, and large landholders, \nsharecroppers, landless, destitute women, households headed by women, minority groups, as \nwell as the general population in the area of influence, numbering about 1.4 million people, of \nwhich more than 60% live below the poverty line.  The MIP will create direct employment \nopportunities for the poor during the construction of water-related infrastructure. The project \nsupports effective gender mainstreaming. The key gender issues in the MIP area generally \ninclude noninvolvement of women directly in farming, wage labor, trading, skilled crafts, and \nrunning businesses and market stalls. They also do not migrate seasonally for work, although \nthey do manage their household economy when husbands are absent. The gender action plan \nprepared  has  measurable  targets  and  responsibilities.  The  proposed  activities  are \nmainstreamed,  with  no  separate  resource  allocation.  Specific  gender  design  features  are \nincluded in 50% or more project outputs. The project will contribute to improving women's \naccess to the project benefits. Under the MIP, 5% of employment generated from civil works \nand 20% of employment related to smartcard recharge vending will be reserved for women.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n26.  Resettlement (category C). The requirement for temporary relocation and resettlement \nduring the scheme rehabilitation was avoided by reducing the cross sections (steeper side \nslopes) of canals in populated areas. A resettlement framework was prepared, in accordance \nwith the government\u2019s laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), as a \nprudent measure to address any involuntary resettlement-related uncertainty during project \nimplementation, should any issue arise. BWDB has experience in dealing with safeguards \nincluding with ADB projects and will be supported by appropriate consultant specialists. \n \n27.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No indigenous peoples, as defined for operational \npurposes by the Safeguard Policy Statement, are affected by the MIP. \n \n28.  Environment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination  was  prepared  in \naccordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement. The negative impacts are typical for any \nconstruction activities involving earth works and can easily be mitigated through adoption of \nmeasures described in the environmental management plan. Consultations were undertaken \nwith affected stakeholders and a suitable grievance redress mechanism proposed to resolve \nany  project-related  grievances.  PMDC  environment  specialists  will  support  the  PMU  in \nmonitoring and supervising implementation of the MIP environmental management plan. \n \nF.   Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.20 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nproject are expected to outweigh the costs. \n                                                \n19 About 36% of country residents have a monthly household income of less than $112 (categorized as \u201cextreme \npoor\u201d); 23% have a monthly income of $112\u2013$150 (categorized as \u201cpoor\u201d). \n20 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nChanges in government affects  ADB maintains close dialogue with the government and other stakeholders \ncommitment to develop PPP for  to ensure commitment remains and the project communication campaign \nirrigation  keeps farmers and local politicians engaged. \nBWDB personnel resist transfer  BWDB field staff are provided opportunities to join private operators.  \nto private operators \nPrivate sector is reluctant to  The project follows a two-stage approach.
