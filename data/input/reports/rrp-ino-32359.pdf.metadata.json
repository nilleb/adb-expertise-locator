The IMRP \nemphasizes  a  participatory  approach  to  the  management  of \nirrigation and water resources in a decentralized administrative and \nfiscal  framework.  The  salient  aspects  of  the  Project  include: \n(i) strengthening of the capacity of district governments to act as \nthe focal point for development and management of irrigation and \nwater resources; (ii) strengthening and empowering  of the water \nusers  associations  (WUAs)  and  their  federations  (WUAFs)  for \neffective  participation  in  irrigation  management;  (iii) transfer  of \nirrigation  management  to  WUAs/WUAFs;  (iv) technical  and \nfinancial assistance to WUAs/WUAFs for undertaking needs-based \nrepair  and  rehabilitation  of  selected  structures  in  irrigation \nschemes; (v) establishment of a water resources information and \nasset management; and (iv) support for project coordination and \nmonitoring  including  establishment  of  a  project  performance \nmanagement system at district, provincial, and national levels.  \n \nThe Project will be implemented in 25 districts in the provinces of \nLampung, Banten, West Java, Central Java, East Java, and South \nSulawesi.  \n   \nRationale  Irrigated agriculture  has helped  Indonesia substantially increase \nfood production, create rural employment, and reduce poverty. The \ndevelopment and operation and maintenance (O&M) of irrigation \nhave claimed a significant part of public resources, but the sector \ncontinues  to  have  inadequate,  inappropriate,  and  dilapidated \ninfrastructure. Consequently, physical and fiscal sustainability of \nirrigated  agriculture  has  been  a  matter  of  concern  for  the \nGovernment and its development partners. \n \nThe  O&M  and  sustainability  issues  were  studied  in  the  1990s \nunder various investment and technical assistance projects. These \nstudies concluded that major constraints to sustainable irrigation \nmanagement were: (i) policy and institutional constraints, (ii) weak \nand low level of stakeholder participation, and (iii) and inadequate \nassessment and funding of O&M. As a major departure from the \ntraditional top-down decisions focusing on construction activities, \nthe  Government  launched  in  1995  the  ADB-assisted  Farmer \nManaged Irrigation Systems Project with direct involvement of local \ngovernments  and  beneficiary  farmers  in  the  decision-making ", "iv        \ngovernments  and  beneficiary  farmers  in  the  decision-making \nprocess,  with  farmer  contribution  toward  O&M  and  scheme \nrehabilitation  and  upgrading costs. This was followed by large-\nscale pilot-testing of a program of major policy and institutional \nreforms  under  a  World  Bank-assisted  irrigation  and  water \nresources  management  project.  The  initial  results  were  highly \nencouraging  and  formed  the  basis  of  comprehensive  policy \nreforms in water resources and irrigation management initiated by \nthe Government in 1999.  \n \n  In 1999, the Government formally adopted the IMRP, which was \nsupported by a law issued in 2001. The IMRP aims at (i) making \ndistrict governments responsible for planning, development, and \nmanagement  of  irrigation;  and  (ii) transferring  irrigation \nmanagement to WUAs/WUAFs. In 2001, the Government adopted \na new national water resources policy to promote integrated water \nresources management within a basin to ensure sustainable use of \nwater  resources  by  various  sectors.  A  bill  for  a  Water  Law, \nincorporating the IMRP and the national water resources policy, is \npresently being reviewed by the national Parliament. \n \nThe proposed project forms part of a joint initiative by multilateral \nand  bilateral  funding  agencies  involved  in  Indonesia\u2019s  water \nresources sector to provide technical and financial assistance in a \ncomplementary manner to support implementation of the sector \nreforms. The ongoing administrative and fiscal decentralization and \nthe water sector reforms are mutually reinforcing and provide a \nunique  opportunity  to  improve  and  ensure  the  sustainability  of \nwater resources development and irrigated agriculture. \n   \nObjectives  The  long-term  objectives  are  increased  economic  growth  and \nreduced poverty in 25 districts of rural Indonesia. The immediate \nobjectives are decentralized management of irrigation systems on \na sustainable basis and increased yields of irrigated crops.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The Project will cost about $126.0 million equivalent comprising \n$30.6 million in foreign exchange and $95.4 million equivalent in \nlocal currency. \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nSource  Foreign   Local  Total  Percentage \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nADB through ADF  5.7  13.3  19.0  15.1 \nADB through OCR  20.5  33.5  54.0  42.8 \nNetherlands Grant  4.4  10.6  15.0  11.9 \nCentral and Regional   -  25.5  25.5  20.2 \n   Governments \nWUAs  -  12.5  12.5  10.0 \nTotal  30.6  95.4  126.0  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund,  \n OCR = ordinary capital resources, WUA = water users association. \n   ", "      v\nLoan Amount and Terms  $54.0 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and \n$19.0 million  from  its  Asian  Development  Fund  resources.  The \nOCR loan will have a 22-year term including a grace period of 7 \nyears,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per \nannum,  a  front-end  fee  of  0.5%,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The ADF loan will \nhave a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with \nan interest charge of 1% per year during the grace period and \n1.5% per year during the remaining period.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented over a period of  7 years. The \nArrangements  implementation  responsibilities  will  be  shared  by  the  national \ngovernment  sector  agencies  and  the  regional  governments  at \nprovincial and district levels. A national steering committee will \nprovide  overall  policy  guidance  and  oversee  project \nimplementation,  and  will  be  assisted  by  a  national  project \ncoordination  and  monitoring  office  (PCMO).  Each  executing \nagency will establish a national project management unit (PMU). \nEach participating province and district will establish a provincial \nPCMO and district PCMO. Each district will establish an irrigation \ncommission  (IC)  comprising  government  and  nongovernment \nmembers, for planning and management of irrigation within  their \nrespective districts. WUAs will be assisted to develop irrigation \nmanagement  plans  (IMPs)  for  their  schemes.  IMPs  will  be \nreviewed and approved by ICs and will be implemented by WUAs. \nRehabilitation and upgrading works of irrigation schemes will be \ncarried out by WUAs on a cost-sharing basis.  \n   \nExecuting Agencies  Executing  agencies  are:  (i) Directorate  General  of  Water \nResources  of  the  Ministry  of  Settlement  and  Regional \nInfrastructure, (ii) Directorate General of Regional Development of \nthe  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  and  (iii) Directorate  General  of \nAgricultural Facilities of the Ministry of Agriculture. \n   \nProcurement  All goods and related services financed under the ADB loan will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  \n   \nConsulting Services  An estimated 1,653 person-months (pm) of consulting services, \ncomprising  213  pm  international  and  1,440  pm  domestic \nconsultants, will be required to assist the Government and WUAs \nin  implementing  the  Project.

WUAs/WUAFs  covering  about  625,000 \nhectares (ha) will be strengthened. About 250,000 ha of service \narea  will  be  transferred  to  WUAs  through  a  partnership \narrangement requiring them to bear full O&M costs within 3 years \nof  transfer.  Improved  irrigation  performance  will  benefit  some \n1.5 million  farming  families;  about  40%  of  them  are  poor \nsmallholders  or  landless  tenants.  The  inclusive  approaches  to \nparticipation in irrigation management will strengthen access to \nresources  and  give  voice  in  the  decision-making  process  to \ndisadvantaged members of the community, including the poor and \nwomen, thereby addressing an important dimension of poverty and \ngovernance. \n \nBased  on  an  analysis  of  the  five  core  subproject  schemes, \nanticipated incremental farm income would range from 26\u2013162% of \nwithout-project levels. Distribution analysis in the core schemes \nindicates that as much as 42% of the overall net economic gains \nwould accrue to the tail reaches, constituting about one third of the \nservice area. A poverty impact analysis of these schemes indicates \nthat 32% of the net economic benefits would accrue to the poor. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The  successful  implementation  of  the  Project  will  require \nstakeholders  concerned  to  agree  and  adjust  to  the  policy  and \ngovernance  regime  changes  that  are  being  promoted  by  the \nProject. While most of the stakeholders involved in the ongoing \nreform initiatives have been receptive to these changes, some  \nmay be slow in responding to the needs for change during project \nimplementation. This risk will be mitigated by a demand-driven \nsector approach and  by the emphasis on public information and \ncapacity building activities during initial years. \n \nThe  governance  risks  associated  with  decentralization  will  be \nmitigated  through  improved  service  delivery  and  management \ncapacity at district and WUA levels and enhanced transparency \nand participation in project implementation. Provision has been \nmade for media dissemination and information campaigns about \nthe Project, resources made available for  the Project,  and the \nexpected  outputs.  District-level  activities  will  be  approved  and \noverseen by the IC. Most O&M and repair and rehabilitation works \nin  irrigation  systems  will  be  carried  out  by  WUAs.  A  local \naccounting firm will assist in maintaining and monitoring project \naccounts at district and provincial levels. \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Participatory Irrigation Sector Project.1 \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Analysis of Irrigated Agriculture \n2.  Agriculture in Indonesia is dominated by rice and, more generally food crop cultivation. \nAbout 82% of the rice produced in the country is grown under irrigation. Irrigated agriculture \ncovers 6.2 million hectares (ha), of which about 60% is served by large systems (greater than \n4,000 ha) and medium systems (500 ha to 4,000 ha), and the remaining 40% is served by small \nsystems (below 500 ha). Of the total irrigated area, 5.0 million ha are publicly managed and \n1.2 million ha, all comprising small systems, are managed by farmers. The average cropping \nintensity is 155% with an average paddy yield of about 4.5 metric tons (t)/ha.2  \n3.  Investment in irrigation and drainage infrastructure was a major component of the \nGovernment\u2019s  agriculture  and  rural  development  strategy  from  1969  to  1999.  Given  the \navailability  of  cheap  labor,  fertile  land,  plentiful  water  resources,  and  favorable  climatic \nconditions, irrigation investments were economically efficient and helped improve food security \nand reduce rural poverty. As a result of these investments, rice production increased at 4.8% \nper annum over the period 1969\u20131989 when Indonesia moved from being one of the world\u2019s \nmajor  rice  importers  to  achieving  and  maintaining  trend  self-sufficiency  (since  1984).3 \nIndonesia\u2019s current position with regard to food security is, however, fragile and during the latter \nhalf  of  the  1990s,  it  depended  on  international  markets  for  up  to  10%  of  its  annual \nrequirements.4  \n4.  Intensive  cultivation  of  rice,  a  labor-intensive  crop,  increased  rural  incomes  and \nsubstantially contributed to the reduction of rural poverty incidence from 40% in 1970 to 16.5% \nin 1997. The financial crisis in 1997 and successive occurrences of El Ni\u00f1o and widespread \ndrought raised the poverty incidence to 23.5% in 1999. The incidence  came down to about \n18.2% in 2002, with urban and rural poverty incidence at 14.4% and 21.1%, respectively. \nDespite these difficulties, about 43% of the country\u2019s labor force is employed in agriculture, \nmostly in rice production and related activities.  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Sustainability of Irrigated Agriculture \n5.   Notwithstanding  its  impressive  contribution  to  food  security  and  people\u2019s welfare, \nirrigated agriculture faces increasingly complex problems, and the viability and sustainability of \nirrigation has been a major concern of the Government and its development partners. The \ndevelopment and operation and maintenance (O&M) of irrigation claimed a significant share of \npublic  resources  invested  in  agriculture,  but  the  sector  continues  to  have  inadequate, \ninappropriate, and decaying infrastructure. This unsatisfactory status of irrigation facilities is \nlargely  due  to  inadequate  O&M.  Irrigation  O&M  has  been  the  responsibility  of  provincial \n                                                 \n1    ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Participatory Irrigation Sector Project.  Manila \n(TA No. 3793-INO, for $800,000, approved in December 2001) \n2    In comparison, the average cropping intensity and paddy yield under irrigated conditions in the Philippines are \n137% and 3.7 t/ha, respectively.   \n3   Trend self-sufficiency, in contrast to absolute self-sufficiency, implies maintaining rice production at or near \nconsumption levels so that in years of good harvest, Indonesia may export marginal quantities of rice and import \nsimilar small amounts in years of poor harvest.   \n4   Rice imports peaked at 4.75 million metric tons in 1999. ", "2                                                                                                                                                                                     \ngovernments, with funding support from the national Government, but a de facto \u201cdeferred \nmaintenance culture\u201d has necessitated major periodic rehabilitation of facilities. The investment \nin such rehabilitation is substantially higher than what would have been the cost if there had \nbeen adequate routine and periodic maintenance. \n6.   In 1987, the Government adopted the irrigation operation and maintenance policy aimed \nat addressing the sustainability issue through a set of measures including (i) ensuring adequate \nand  timely  O&M  funding,  (ii) gradual  introduction  of  irrigation  service  fees,  (iii) improved \ngovernment management of large irrigation systems, and (iv) transfer of irrigation systems of \nless than 500 hectares to  water users associations (WUAs). Despite some apparent initial \nsuccesses, the irrigation operation and maintenance policy failed to improve irrigation O&M and \nsustainability, largely because of inadequate involvement of local governments and WUAs in the \nformulation of the policy and its implementation. O&M budgets were raised to $80 million \nequivalent in 1987 and remained at that level until 1997, but 60\u201385% of this was used  to \nsupport provincial staff and the balance for urgent repair and rehabilitation activities. There was \nno provision of government accountability for services to farmers, and the farmers were not \nconvinced  that  payment  of  irrigation  service  fees  (in  effect,  a  central  government  tax  on \nirrigation)  would  improve  government  services.  The  small  scheme  management  turnover \nprogram to WUAs achieved about one third of its target, but the program objectives were not \nachieved as most of the WUAs were established following a top-down approach, and provisions \nfor post turnover government guidance and support were unclear.  \n7.  The O&M and sustainability issues were studied in the 1990s under various ongoing \nprojects and programs including the Technical Assistance (TA) for Assessment of Options for \nSustainable Irrigation Development.5 These reviews and other studies concluded that major \nconstraints to sustainable irrigation management were (i) policy and institutional constraints, \n(ii) weak and low level of stakeholder participation, and (iii) inadequate assessment and funding \nof O&M. \n8.   The policy guidelines and regulatory frameworks for the water resources sector, as \nprovided in the Water Law No. 11 of 1974, placed the central Government at the focal point for \nplanning, development, and management of all activities for the sector including irrigation. The \ncentral Government\u2019s functions as provider and regulator of water sector activities were shared \nby various agencies, with fragmented mandates and responsibilities. The  former Directorate \nGeneral of Water Resources Development (DGWRD), the key agency in the sector, was \nresponsible for irrigation development and it implemented its projects through offices set up in \nthe provinces for this purpose. The provincial governments maintained their own provincial \nwater resources services, which were responsible for O&M. District governments\u2019 involvement \nin irrigation was mostly in the provision of agricultural services, with little or no participation in \nirrigation development and O&M.  \n9.   The national and provincial agencies delivered the services with little participation of \nfarmer beneficiaries and their institutions. In developing farmer institutions, emphasis was on \nfollowing a top-down uniform model, leading to the establishment of nominal WUAs that were \nmostly inactive and failed to serve their purpose. Moreover, the rights and responsibilities of \nWUAs were not properly defined and most of them lacked legal recognition. Lack of farmer \nparticipation during planning and design phases led to the construction of facilities that often did \nnot meet local technical requirements and failed to ensure construction quality. The overall \nenvironment at the system level did not provide any incentives to farmers and WUAs in taking \n                                                 \n5    ADB. 1996.  Technical Assistance to the Republic of  Indonesia for  Assessment of Options for Sustainable \nIrrigation Development. Manila.  (TA No. 2695-INO, for $1,200,000, approved on 5 November 1996)  ", "    3 \ngreater responsibility for system O&M and fostered a mentality of dependence on government \nassistance.  \n10.  There is considerable imprecision with regard to the definition  of O&M and a lack of \nappreciation of the costs involved. O&M budgets were prepared by provincial governments \nbased on a \u201cservice area\u201d in a government system rather than on needs in the system. This, \ncoupled with a low allocation per unit area, often led to a situation where O&M needs of many \nsystems were grossly under funded resulting in their rapid deterioration, and traditionally the \nGovernment addressed these issues through much more expensive rehabilitation. Improving \nthe sustainability of  irrigation will require  preparation  of  a  needs-based budget  with better \ndefinition of O&M costs to include all operational costs for staff, equipment, and facilities, and \nroutine and periodic maintenance of irrigation systems.  \n11.  In 1995, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the Farmer-Managed Irrigation \nSystems Project (FMISP)6 with a major reorientation of government assistance to irrigation \ndevelopment and management focusing on a participatory approach to irrigation management, \nincluding the objective of mobilizing farmer contribution of labor and materials toward the O&M \nand rehabilitation and upgrading (R&U) costs. This was a major departure from the traditional \ntop-down decisions focusing on construction activities. In 1998, the Government initiated large-\nscale pilot testing of a program of policy and institutional reforms in irrigation management \nunder the World Bank-assisted Java Irrigation Improvement and Water Resources Management \nProject  (JIIWMP)  covering  the  provinces  in  Java  Island.  The  initial  results  were  highly \nencouraging and formed the basis of a comprehensive water sector policy reform under a Water \nSector Adjustment Loan of the World Bank approved in 1999. \n2.  Recent Developments \n12.  National Water Resources Policy. As envisaged under the World Bank Water Sector \nAdjustment Loan policy matrix, which was endorsed by ADB, a national water resources policy \n(NWRP) was prepared and formally adopted by the Government in December 2001. The NWRP \naims for integrated water resources management within a river basin to ensure sustainable, \neconomic, and multisector allocation and use of water. It provides a framework for coordination \nat  national  and  regional  levels  among  various  agencies  involved  in  water  resources \ndevelopment, management, and use. A bill on a new Water Law is presently being reviewed by \nParliament, and the law is expected to be enacted by December 2003.  \n13.  Irrigation Management Policy Reform. As part of the overall policy initiatives in the \nwater resources sector, the Government has embarked on major reforms for improving the \nsustainability of irrigated agriculture. The Government issued, in April 1999, a decree on the \nirrigation management reform program (IMRP), with participatory irrigation development and \nmanagement  as  the  core  of  the  agenda.  The  reform  principles  have  been  elaborated  in \nsubsequent  government  regulations  and  ministerial  decrees,  particularly  Government \nRegulation No. 77 on Irrigation issued in December 2001. The reform envisages WUAs to take \nthe primary responsibility for O&M and periodic rehabilitation while the Government will have a \nduty to assist; government assistance will be conditional  on local efforts for O&M. Irrigation \nsystems will be transferred to WUAs through an irrigation management agreement (IMA), which \nclarifies the rights, authority, and responsibility of  the WUA and the Government, including \nprovision of continued government assistance for repair and improvements that are beyond the \ncapacity of the WUA.

(Loan No. 1378 \u2013INO, for \n$26.3 million) \n ", "4                                                                                                                                                                                     \nrehabilitation. ISF was a central government tax and farmers were not convinced that it was \nused efficiently for O&M activities. \n14.  The IMRP redefines irrigation institutions, with the district as the focal point for planning \nand funding irrigation development and management. It provides for the establishment, in each \ndistrict, of (i) a multi-stakeholder irrigation commission (IC)\u2014comprising government officials \nconcerned  and  nongovernment  members  including  WUA  representatives,  academics,  and \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)\u2014with  authority  for  overall  management  of  irrigation \nactivities in the district, and (ii) a kabupaten (district) irrigation improvement fund (KIIF) with \ncentral and  district government contributions to assist WUAs in sustainable management of \nirrigation systems. The Ministry of Finance issued a ministerial decree on 30 June 2003 on the \nestablishment of KIIFs in districts and the mechanism of fund flow through KIIFs. Similarly, the \nMinistry of Home Affairs  issued a ministerial decree on 30 June 2003 on roles of sector \ninstitutions at provincial and district levels. Provincial institutions are responsible for managing \nriver basins that cross district boundaries, and assist district governments (when so requested \nby districts) in irrigation and water resources management. The national institutions will be \nresponsible for setting national policies, standards, and guidelines; macro planning; and other \naspects of sector management.  \n15.  The participatory concept that underpins the IMRP, including the objective of mobilizing \nfarmer  contributions  of  labor  and  materials  toward  O&M  and  rehabilitation  costs,  was \nsuccessfully implemented first in FMISP and subsequently in JIIWMP. Although the levels and \nmethods of farmer contributions have been adjusted over time for various reasons, including \nIndonesia\u2019s economic crisis, FMISP has retained the principle of farmer contributions and the \noverall experience has been encouraging. JIIWMP was completed in 2000 and the institutional \nand policy reforms initiated under the project have been supported since then in 12 provinces, \nincluding the four Java provinces, under the Netherlands-assisted Indonesia Water Resources \nand Irrigation Reform Implementation Project (IWIRIP) approved in 2001. Under JIIWMP and \nIWIRIP, about 400 WUA federations (WUAFs) have been established in about 235 schemes \ncovering about 315,000 ha, each WUAF nesting a series of WUAs at the secondary canal level. \nGovernance and management of 61 schemes covering 73,000 ha have been transferred to \nWUAFs. Initial assessment indicate that there were substantial quality and fiscal efficiency gains \nin O&M and R&U works carried out by WUAs themselves following the participatory approach.  \n  3.  Opportunities \n16.  Continued Support for Policy Reforms. The ongoing administrative and fiscal reforms \n(under the Regional Autonomy and Fiscal Autonomy Acts of 22 and 25, respectively, of 1999) \nand the water sector reforms are mutually reinforcing, both in concept and timing, and provide \nan excellent opportunity for changing the approach to management of water resources in \ngeneral and irrigation infrastructure in particular, to ensure their sustainability. The IMRP and \nGovernment  Regulation  77  formalize  initiatives  in  recent  projects  for  overcoming  the \nsustainability  issues  confronting  irrigated  agriculture.  The  new  paradigms  will  require \nstrengthening of district-level institutions responsible for planning, developing, managing, and \nregulating  irrigation  and  water  resources.  As  part  of  the  ongoing  decentralization  of  the \nGovernment, about two thirds of the 25,000 staff complement of  the Directorate General of \nWater Resources (DGWR) were devolved in 2002 to district and provincial governments. District \ngovernments have taken initiatives to develop effective partnerships with WUA for sharing \nirrigation management responsibility. WUAs will need to be reactivated or  strengthened for \neffective  O&M  of  irrigation  schemes.  The  capacity-building  activities  will  need  to  be \ncomplemented by an investment program, using the KIIF, to catalyze technical, institutional, and \nmanagement improvements in existing irrigation systems.  ", "    5 \n4.  External Assistance Coordination  \n17.  The  external  funding  agencies  active  in  the  sector  have  been  working  with  the \nGovernment in a coordinated manner in developing and implementing the policy reforms in the \nwater resources sector, including irrigation. The proposed Project forms part of joint initiatives \nby ADB, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Japan Bank for International \nCooperation, Netherlands, World Bank, and other agencies to provide technical and financial \nassistance to support implementation of the sector reforms. On that basis,  the focus of the \nProject will be on capacity building and sustained operation of existing small and medium-scale \nschemes, and consolidation of gains in improving water resources management in recent ADB-\nassisted projects. The Netherlands Government has agreed in principle to cofinance the Project. \nThe World Bank approved, in June 2003, a Water Resources and Irrigation Sector Management \nProgram (WISMP), using its adjustable program loan modality. WISMP will be implemented in \n70 districts in 12 provinces, including the six provinces of the proposed Project. In the common \nsix provinces, each project will cover a separate set of districts. A table on external assistance \nto the irrigation sector is given in Appendix 1.  \n  5.  Lessons Learned \n18.  ADB  assistance  to  the  irrigation  sector  has  amounted  to  $1,526 million,  including \n$8.5 million in TA, covering 36 projects. These projects have aimed primarily at increasing rice \nproduction, and improving income and living conditions of farmers through the provision of \nirrigation  and  flood  control.  Nineteen  of  these  projects  have  been  post  evaluated. Seven \nprojects were rated as generally successful and 10 as partly successful in achieving their \nintended objectives, while two projects were considered unsuccessful, largely because of low \neconomic viability. \n19.  The projects helped increase crop production, but their achievements in terms of service \narea and crop yields have sometimes been below expectation. Shortfalls were due, among \nother  things,  to  limited  availability  of  water  resources  to  meet  increasing  water  demand, \ninadequate  O&M  and  periodic  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  facilities, lack of an effective cost \nrecovery system for funding O&M costs, and insufficient agricultural support services.  \n20.  Post evaluation experience highlighted the importance of formulating and designing \nirrigation projects in the context of a broad river basin development scheme, considering the \naggregate supply and demand situation for water and associated economic costs and benefits. \nTo enhance the sustainability of benefits, it was suggested that the Government should adopt \nreasonable cost-sharing arrangements with farmer beneficiaries to promote efficient use of \nwater  resources  and  to  generate  funds  to  cover  adequate  levels  of  O&M  and  periodic \nrehabilitation costs. The experience emphasized the need for local government and beneficiary \nparticipation, in the planning, design, implementation, and O&M of irrigation systems to enhance \nlocal ownership. Inadequate beneficiary participation was acknowledged as the single most \nimportant  factor  in  project  underperformance  compared  with  other  commonly  occurring \nimpediments, including poor design, implementation delays, cost overruns, price fluctuations, \nand institutional deficiencies in implementing agencies.  \n21.  Most earlier irrigation projects aimed to provide new, or to improve existing, irrigation \ninfrastructure for large-scale, publicly managed irrigation systems. Experience has shown that \nthere are fewer risks associated with small and medium-scale schemes, and ADB's recent \nassistance to the irrigation sector has been directed to smaller systems, including farmer-\nmanaged or village irrigation schemes, with relatively low levels of technical complexity. \n22.  Sector policy reforms being undertaken are based on the lessons learned in the past \nand ongoing projects in the sector. The Project will support implementation of the policy \n ", "6                                                                                                                                                                                     \nreforms, and its design has incorporated careful attention to specific lessons learned from the \nADB-assisted projects. The Project incorporates (i) a high level of beneficiary participation, at all \nstages of preparation and implementation; (ii) direct involvement of local governments and other \nstakeholders in project preparation and implementation; (iii) a flexible implementation schedule \nbased on the capacity of local government agencies to coordinate, manage, and implement the \nProject; (iv) strengthening of agricultural support services; (v) coverage of small and medium-\nscale irrigation schemes; and (vi) strengthening of water resources information management, \ntaking into account the increasing demand for multisector uses. \n  6.  ADB\u2019s Sector Objectives and Strategies \n23.  Indonesia\u2019s Country Strategy and Program (2003\u20132005) has the following development \nobjectives:  reducing  poverty,  improving  governance,  supporting  decentralization,  managing \nnatural resources and the environment, and strengthening the economy through infrastructure \ninvestments and private sector participation. In the agriculture and rural development sector, \nADB\u2019s  strategy  for  Indonesia  is  to  reduce  poverty  by  increasing  farm  productivity  and \nempowering the rural community. ADB\u2019s strategy for  the environment and natural resources \nsector emphasizes promoting sustainable management of natural resources in a decentralized \nframework, with increased stakeholder participation in the decision-making process. For water \nresources, the strategy underscores water conservation, efficiency improvement in irrigation, \nand a holistic approach to resource management within a river basin. The Project is fully \nconsistent with the strategy for Indonesia. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT  \nA.  Objective and Scope \n24.  The long-term objectives are increased economic growth and reduced poverty in 25 \ndistricts  of  rural  Indonesia.  The  immediate  objectives  are  decentralized  management  of \nirrigation systems on a sustainable basis and increased yields of irrigated crops. The project \nframework is given in Appendix 2. \n25.  The Project will cover the following provinces: (i) Lampung, (ii) Banten, (iii) West Java, \n(iv) Central Java, (v) East Java, and (vi) South Sulawesi. Nearly 75% of  Indonesia\u2019s irrigation \narea is in Java Island, and in Lampung and South Sulawesi provinces. ADB has approved 22 \nprojects for a total amount of $1.02 billion to support irrigation and water resources development \nin  these  provinces,  which  have  a  good  understanding  of  ADB\u2019s  project  implementation \nprocedures and systems. The provinces have started implementing the IMRP, and the Project \nwill assist in consolidating the gains and improving the sustainability of past investments.  \n26.  The  Project  will  follow  a  demand-driven  approach  to  irrigation  management \nimprovement, accommodating districts\u2019 funding constraints and varying degrees of institutional, \ntechnical, and management capabilities. In the context of the Project, \u201csubproject\u201d refers to a \ndistrict with all water resources and irrigation infrastructure, institutions, and stakeholders in it, \nand an irrigation scheme selected for project support is a \u201csubproject scheme\u201d. A list of potential \ndistricts in the six provinces is given in Appendix 3. \nB.  Components and Outputs \n27.  The Project will comprise three components, i.e., Part A: Irrigation Management; Part B: \nWater Resources Information and Asset Management; and Part C: Project Coordination and \nMonitoring. ", "    7 \n1.  Part A: Irrigation Management \n28.  The component will comprise (i) capacity building of districts, (ii) capacity building of \nWUAs,7  (iii) sustainable  operation  of  irrigation  infrastructure,  and  (iv) irrigated  agriculture \nsupport. \na.  Part A-1: Capacity Building of Districts \n29.  The  Project  will  develop  institutional  capacity  of  about  25  district  governments  to \neffectively discharge the responsibility devolved to them in accordance with the IMRP, under the \ndecentralized framework of government. Specifically, the Project will assist district governments \nin  (i) formulating  policy  guidelines  and  regulations  in  conformity  with  the  relevant  national \npolicies and regulations, (ii) strengthening relevant district agencies for efficient delivery of \npublic services related to the Project, and (iii) developing and implementing district irrigation \nmanagement plans (DIMPs).  \n30.  Policy guidelines and district irrigation regulations  will be prepared using an inclusive \nparticipatory process with extensive stakeholder consultations. They will address district-specific \nissues  and  concerns,  in  addition  to  meeting  the  national  policy  requirements.  The district \nirrigation  regulations,  to  be  approved  by  the  district  legislature,  will  provide  the  basis  for \nestablishing a KIIF, which would then be used for subsequent project implementation.  \n31.  Each district will establish an IC comprising government officials concerned with irrigated \nagriculture and non-government members including WUAs representatives. Initially, the district \nwill establish a district working group which, after the enactment of district irrigation regulations, \nwill be converted to an IC. Among the initial priorities of IC will be the review of existing \ninstitutional arrangements for irrigation management and the identification of capacity building \nneeds across the sector. The organizational structure and staffing of the relevant agencies, \nincluding the district water resources services and  the district agricultural services, will be \nreviewed and rationalized, and staff training needs will be assessed and staff will be trained. \nStaff training will focus on improving the professional, technical, and managerial efficiency of \nstaff, and making government agencies more service oriented. Activities will be undertaken in \ncoordination with the  Sustainable Capacity Building for Decentralization Project, approved in \n2002.8 The Project will support visits of selected district staff and WUA members to irrigation \nschemes  within  the  country  and  region  where  the  participatory  approach  to  irrigation \nmanagement is being successfully implemented.  \n32.  The information on the status of existing irrigation systems in districts will be updated \nand  a  DIMP  will  be  prepared.  The  plan  will  aim  at  improving  the  physical  and  financial \nsustainability of irrigation systems by introducing the participatory approach to management. \nThe plan will also form the basis for a sector investment program in the medium  to long term. \nThe DIMP will include a program for strengthening WUAs; transfer of schemes to WUAs \nthrough an IMA; and funding requirements for a satisfactory level of O&M  as well as periodic \nand emergency replacement and rehabilitation. The DIMP will be reviewed and updated every \nyear, particularly taking into account the experience gained in implementing Part A-3.  \nb.  Part A-2: Capacity Building of Water Users Associations \n33.  The  subcomponent  will  focus  on  strengthening  WUAs  in  the  project  area  through \n(i) irrigation  reform  information  campaigns,  and  (ii) establishing and/or strengthening about \n                                                 \n7    Henceforth, WUA is used as a generic term and includes WUAFs or the apex WUAF. \n8   ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Sustainable Capacity Building for Decentralization Project. Manila.

IMRP policies will be disseminated at the field level through media publicity and \nworkshops  for  farmers  engaged  in  irrigated  agriculture.  In  establishing  and  strengthening \nWUAs, emphasis will be given to taking advantage of existing traditional/customary institutions \nfor irrigation management that are now recognized by the Government Regulation on Irrigation. \nMultiple WUAs in a large scheme will be assisted to federate into a WUAF and/or an apex \nWUAF. WUAs will also be assisted in obtaining legal status through registration with the district \nauthority. As part of this process, legal literacy will also be provided to help individual water \nusers and their associations better understand their rights and responsibilities under the new \npolicies. Legal assistance will also be provided in formulating management agreement and in \nutilizing their legal status to contract with third parties in connection with irrigation management \nand  in  improving  irrigated  agriculture.  Institutional  strengthening  support  to  WUA  will  be \nprovided initially for  1 year  and thereafter for  2 more years during implementation of the \nirrigation management plan (IMP) for the scheme.  \nc.  Part A-3: Sustainable Operation of Irrigation Infrastructure \n34.  After initial strengthening, the WUA will be assisted in the following: (i) undertaking a \nparticipatory  rural  appraisal  to  assess  scheme  performance  and  identify  requirements  for \nimproving O&M; (ii) formulating an IMP covering a 5-year period; (iii) preparing a needs-based \nbudget for priority activities for (a) an adequate level of O&M and (b) periodic rehabilitation of \nselected items as sustainable replacement of rehabilitation (SRR); and (iv) preparing a budget \nfor scheme R&U, if required, to address the effects of past deferred maintenance. SRR is low-\nlevel periodic replacement/rehabilitation designed to ensure that the deferred maintenance cycle \nis broken and that irrigation systems performance is maintained at or close to the original design \nlevel. WUAs will be eligible for SRR assistance only after they have demonstrated an improved \nlevel of routine O&M. About 137,000 ha will be rehabilitated and upgraded. Routine O&M costs \nwill normally be wholly financed by WUA; otherwise, the IMP will include an action plan showing \nhow the WUA will provide full funding of routine O&M within an agreed time frame, normally 3 \nyears, by gradually increasing irrigation service charges.  \n35.  The IMP will be reviewed by the district agencies for technical, financial, and economic \nviability and compliance with the Project\u2019s environment management plan (EMP); resettlement \ncompensation policy framework and procedural guidelines (CPFPG); gender action plan; and \nindigenous people\u2019s participatory planning framework. The IMP will be approved and prioritized \nby the IC, and harmonized with the DIMP and district priorities. The actual criteria for delineating \nthe eligibility of government assistance for O&M, SRR, and R&U will be worked out by individual \ndistricts, in consultation with national and provincial agencies concerned, according to  the \nspecific condition of the districts. Normally all activities involving unskilled labor, e.g., canal \ndesilting, cutting weeds, earthworks to restore canal shape, will be fully managed by WUA, \nwhile repairs that require substantial cash expenses or specialized engineering expertise or \nequipment not available locally, will be eligible for government support.  \n 36.  Following the approval of  the  IMP,  an  IMA  will  be  negotiated  between the district \ngovernment and by the WUA. The IMA will incorporate the approved IMP and define the \nresponsibilities of the WUA in managing the scheme, as well as the  technical and financial \nsupport and services to be provided  by the district government. An agreed mechanism for \nconflict resolution will be included. In case of relatively large schemes, O&M responsibility for \nheadworks and main canals may be retained by the district water resources services (DWRS), \nWUAs being responsible only for downstream facilities. Such sharing of responsibility will be \noutlined in the respective IMAs.  ", "    9 \nd.  Part A-4: Irrigated Agriculture support \n37.  The subcomponent will provide support for dissemination of new technologies that were \ntested and recommended for field use by the Ministry of Agriculture under various programs \nincluding  the  ADB-assisted  Participatory  Development  of  Agricultural  Technology  Project.9 \nSupport will also be provided for improving farmer access to agricultural inputs and services, \nand this will be achieved through strengthening technical, organizational, managerial, and \nbargaining capacity of WUAs for better deals with inputs and service providers and making the \nproviders responsive and accountable to clients. Performance of similar programs within the \nproject area and elsewhere in the country will be assessed and findings taken into consideration \nin designing a pilot study that will be  tested in five districts.  After validating the design, the \nactivity will be extended in a phased approach to other districts.  \n2.  Part B: Water Resources Information and Asset Management  \n38.  This  component  will  improve  and  expand  the  operation  of  the  water  resources \ninformation management system and facilities established in DGWR to provide access to quality \ndata and information for multisector use. The institutional arrangements for managing the Water \nResources Data Center at DGWR Central Office will be strengthened, and the Water Resources \nData Center will be integrated into the regular organizational structure of DGWR. Additional staff \nwill be recruited and trained for data processing and providing value-added services to users. \nData requirements and information systems necessary for efficient water resources planning \nand management, and effective asset management at district level, will be assessed; hardware, \ntogether with appropriate generic software models, will also be provided. The design of the \ndistrict water resources information management system and its implementation will be in line \nwith the decision support system and the database concept and architectural design developed \nunder  JIIWMP.  District  staff  will  be  trained  and  provided  with  facilities  for  studying  and \ndeveloping irrigation and water resources asset management modules. \n3.  Part C: Project Coordination and Monitoring \n39.  The  Project  will  support  (i) operation  of  a  national  steering  committee  (NSC); \n(ii) establishment and operation of a national project coordination and monitoring office (PCMO); \n(iii) financial  accounting  and  monitoring  of  the  Project;  and  (iv) development  of  a  project \nperformance management system (PPMS) at national, provincial, and district levels. \n40.  The Government  established, in 2002, an NSC for guiding all water resources and \nirrigation development programs in the country. The Project will support the establishment and \noperation  of  the  national  PCMO  as  the  NSC  secretariat  for  the  Project  and  for  overall \ncoordination and monitoring of project activities. A domestic accounting firm (consultant) will be \nengaged to ensure that project financial accounting reports and financial monitoring reports are \nprepared  accurately  and  at  regular  quarterly  intervals  by  each  project \nimplementation/management office at district, provincial, and national levels. The consultant will \nalso  train  government  staff  in  developing  their  capacity  in  accounting  and  financial \nmanagement. \n41.  The PPMS will encompass (i) monitoring physical and financial progress as well as the \neconomy and efficiency in achieving major activities; (ii) monitoring the level and adequacy of \nparticipation of various stakeholders in planning and implementing project activities, particularly \ndistrict capacity building and improving the performance of irrigation schemes; (iii) monitoring \n                                                 \n9    ADB. 1997. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Participatory Development of Agricultural Technology Project. Manila. (Loan No. \n1526-INO, approved in 1997 for $63.8 million) \n ", "10                                                                                                                                                                                     \nthe  Project\u2019s  social,  environmental,  and  economic  impacts,  including  the  establishment  of \nbenchmark  information  and  data;  and  (iv) developing  a  mechanism  for  making  necessary \nadjustments in the project design and implementation arrangements in light of the PPMS \nfindings. The design of the PPMS will take into account the monitoring and evaluation systems \ndeveloped  under  TA  1363-INO:  Strengthening  Project  Benefit  Monitoring  and  Evaluation \nActivities of the Directorate General of Water Resources Development. \nC.  Special Features \n42.  Poverty Targeting. The project design includes a combination of measures to maximize \npoverty impact. The rural poverty incidence in the six provinces that will receive support for \nirrigation  management  improvement  ranges  between  20%  and  29%,  with  a  six-province \naverage of 26%. Within the rural population,  the incidence of poverty is much higher in  the \nagriculture sector than  in other sectors, and was estimated at 40% in 1999. The subproject \nselection  criteria  give  priority  to  districts  that  have  a  relatively  high  incidence  of  poverty. \nSimilarly, poverty data and the potential benefits for the poor will be duly considered in selecting \nindividual  irrigation  schemes.  A  variety  of  measures  targeting  poor  and  disadvantaged \nindividuals or groups will be used, including: (i) guidelines for WUA strengthening (which will \nrequire special attention to inform and include tenant farmers in the collective decision-making \nprocess);  (ii) use  of  local  labor  and  materials  in  implementing  scheme  improvement;  and \n(iii) equity  in  water  allocation  and  management,  particularly  in  terms  of  meeting  the \nrequirements of tail-enders in the service area. \n43.  Gender and Development. Despite their extensive involvement in irrigated agriculture, \nwomen have not been well represented in irrigation management, nor in training, meetings, and \nother activities carried out under earlier programs. While recognizing the need to respect local \nvalues and beliefs and while respecting the choices of both men and women about taking part in \nspecific activities, the Project will pursue suitable opportunities to promote greater involvement \nof women in the decision-making process of irrigation management. The project design provides \nfor specific measures to achieve this, as outlined in Table 2 of the Summary Poverty Reduction \nand Social Strategy and  Gender Plan in Appendix 4. Poverty and social issues are further \ndiscussed in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n44.  Environment.  All  three  components  of  the  Project  aim  at,  among  other  things, \nsustainable water resources management and environmental protection. The only activities \nlikely to have some negative impact relate to subcomponent A-3: Sustainable Operation of \nIrrigation Infrastructure. An initial environmental examination of the five schemes studied during \nproject preparation was undertaken and findings are summarized in Appendix 5. The findings \nindicate that improved O&M will lead to improved irrigation and environmental management in \nall schemes. However, construction activities in rehabilitation and upgrading some selected \nscheme, if not undertaken properly, may have  a short-term negative environmental impact. \nDistrict-level staff and WUA members will be trained in environmental screening of the irrigation \nschemes proposed for project support. A project environmental management plan (EMP) for \nenvironmental mitigation, complying with government regulations, has been prepared to guide \nthe WUAs and district authorities and is included in Supplementary Appendix B. \n45.  Resettlement  and  Land  Acquisition.  Since  the  Project  focuses  on  improving  the \nmanagement of existing systems, resettlement and land acquisition are not expected to be \nsignificant. None of the core subproject schemes would require any significant land acquisition \nor resettlement. Nonetheless, a CPFPG has been prepared (Supplementary Appendix C) and \nwill guide all land acquisition and resettlement activities. A summary of the CPFPG is given in \nAppendix 6 on Land Acquisition, Resettlement, and Indigenous Peoples.  ", "    11 \n46.  Indigenous People. The communities likely to be affected by the Project are already \nengaged in cultivating irrigated rice. They include groups speaking various local languages and \nwith distinct ethnic identities. In terms of livelihood systems, education, and representation in the \nlocal bureaucracy, there is little significant risk of any group of people being disadvantaged \nbecause  of  their status  as  an  ethnic  minority  or  indigenous  people.  Available  information \nsuggests that the Project would not affect groups with special vulnerabilities that would require \npreparation of a separate indigenous people\u2019s development plan. If such groups are identified \nwho may be significantly affected by project implementation, then such plans will be prepared in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples, and implementation of project activities \nat such sites would be conditional on  ADB\u2019s approval of the relevant  plans. An indigenous \npeople\u2019s participatory planning framework is given in Appendix 6. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n47.  The total cost of the Project (including taxes, price contingencies, and interest during \nconstruction) is estimated at $126.0 million equivalent (Table 1), of which $30.6 million (25%) is \nthe direct and indirect foreign exchange cost, including about $6.0 million for interest and other \ncharges during construction. The balance of $95.4 million equivalent (75%) is the local currency \ncost.

Financing Plan \n48.  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $19.0 million  equivalent  from  its  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  resources  to  finance  $5.7 million  of  the  foreign  exchange  costs  and \n$13.3 million equivalent of  the local currency costs. The loan will have a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1% per year during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per year during the remaining term. \n49.  In addition, the Government has requested a loan of $54.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to finance $20.5 million of  the foreign exchange costs and $33.5 million \nequivalent of the local currency costs. The loan will have a 22-year term including a grace \nperiod of 7 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 0.5% (the fee will be \ncapitalized  in  the  loan),  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \n ", "12                                                                                                                                                                                     \nAgreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. \n50.  The Government of Indonesia has requested the Government of  the Netherlands to \nprovide grant financing for the Project, and the latter has agreed in principle to provide a grant of \n$15.0 million equivalent. The grant, to be administered by ADB, will cover $4.4 million of the \nforeign exchange costs and $10.6 million equivalent of the local currency costs. \n51.  ADB and the Netherlands Government will finance 60% of the local cost of the Project. \nThis is principally because of the nature of the works envisaged under the Project, which are \nmainly  capacity  building  of  local  governments  and  WUAs,  and  small-scale  repair  and \nrehabilitation of existing irrigation schemes. The Project is classified as a poverty intervention \nproject and will contribute significantly on combating poverty and improving living conditions of \npeople in the Project area. Therefore, the ADB\u2019s and the Netherlands\u2019 financing a large part of \nthe  local  cost  is  justified  on  project  considerations.  The  Government  (including  local \ngovernments) and WUAs will finance the remaining local currency cost equivalent to about \n$38.0 million. The Government will cover all taxes and duties, recurrent expenditures during \nimplementation, land acquisition and resettlement,  and environmental mitigation measures, \nestimated to cost $25.5 million. The estimated WUA contribution will total about $12.5 million \nequivalent and form part of the incremental O&M, SRR, and R&U costs.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management and Coordination \n52.  The  Project  will  be  executed  by the  Ministry  of  Agriculture through  the Directorate \nGeneral of Agricultural Facilities (DGAF), Ministry of Home Affairs  through the Directorate \nGeneral  of  Regional  Development  (BANGDA),  and  Ministry  of  Settlement  and  Regional \nInfrastructure through DGWR. The project implementing agencies (IAs) are as follows:  \n(i)  Part A-1: Capacity Building of Districts\u2014district governments;  \n(ii)  Part A-2: Capacity Building of Water User Associations\u2014district governments; \n(iii)  Part A-3: Sustainable Operation of Irrigation Infrastructure\u2014provincial and district \ngovernments; \n(iv)  Part A-4: Irrigated Agriculture Support\u2014district governments; ", "    13 \n(v)  Part  B:  Water  Resources  Information  and  Asset  Management\u2014DGWR,  and \nprovincial and district governments; and \n(vi)  Part  C:  Project  Monitoring  and  Coordination\u2014National  Planning  and \nDevelopment Agency (BAPPENAS), in cooperation with BANGDA, DGAF, and \nDGWR. \n53.  Each EA will establish a national project management unit (national PMU) in Jakarta, \ncomprising a project director and an adequate number of qualified technical, accounting, and \nfinancial staff. The national PMU under DGWR will be responsible for: (i) recruiting consultants \nfor  improving  O&M  efficiency  undertaking  SRR  and  R&U  activities,  and  water  resources \ninformation management system; (ii) overseeing the implementation of civil works, O&M-related \nactivities, and water resources data gathering for management information system; and (iii) \noverseeing procurements by WUAs. The national PMU under BANGDA  will: (i) oversee and \nfacilitate capacity building of districts and WUAs, issuance of district irrigation regulations, and \nthe  strengthening  of  the  legal  status  of  WUAs;  and  (ii)  recruit  and  supervise  institutional \ndevelopment  and  capacity  building  consultants.  The  national  PMU  under  DGAF  will  be \nresponsible  for:  (i)  recruiting  consultants  for  agricultural  support  services;  (ii)  overseeing \nagricultural  extension  training  and  development  of  cooperatives;  and  (iii)  assisting  WUA \nmembers in adopting irrigated agriculture technologies, formation of cooperatives, and providing \naccess to ongoing rural financial services. \n54.  Each participating province will establish a provincial PCMO at Provincial Planning and \nDevelopment Agency (Provincial BAPPEDA) level, comprising provincial staff of relevant sector \nagencies and members of civil society. The provincial PCMO will assist provincial government \nand technical agencies  to (i) identify additional subproject districts for project participation; \n(ii) help NSC in monitoring and coordinating project activities and coordinate with other similar \nprojects and programs being implemented in the province; (iii) facilitate backstopping to districts \non engineering and agricultural aspects; (iv) maintain provincial directories of service providers \nfor use by participating districts and WUAs; (vi) facilitate collection and dissemination of district-\nlevel  implementation  experiences  through  workshops,  discussions,  and  newsletters;  and \n(vii) formulate an annual work plan (AWP) for the province. AWP will document the activities to \nbe undertaken during the year including their commencement and completion dates, status of \npreparation,  expected  outputs,  and  budget  requirements.  The  provincial  water  resources \nservices and agricultural services will be designated the provincial project implementation units. \n55.  Each of the participating provinces will establish 2 provincial project implementation units \n(Provincial PIUs) at the provincial water resources services and provincial agricultural services \n(PWRS  and  PAS).  The  PWRS  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  developing  water  resources \ninformation and asset management system at provincial level, and implementing works relating \nto irrigation infrastructure and O&M efficiency improvements when a subproject scheme covers \nmore  than  one  district.  The  PAS  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  overseeing  the  institutional \ndevelopment and agricultural support services at district and WUA levels. \n56.  Provincial PCMOs will be replicated at district level by district PCMOs, chaired by district \nBAPPEDAs. District AWPs will be reviewed and endorsed by ICs. District water resources \nservices and agricultural services  will serve as district  project implementation units  and will \nsupervise  project  implementation  on  a  day-to-day  basis.    Similarly,  each  district  will  also \nestablish two PIUs at the district water resources services and district agricultural services. \n57.  At the national level, the Project will be guided by the NSC, chaired by the Deputy \nChairman for Infrastructure, BAPPENAS. The EAs and other relevant national agencies will be \nrepresented on the NSC at the director general level. The NSC will provide policy guidelines, \napprove  subproject  district  selection  and  AWP  for  the  Project,  and  oversee  project \n ", "14                                                                                                                                                                                     \nimplementation. The NSC will meet as necessary, and at least twice a year. A national PCMO \nwill serve as the secretariat for the NSC. National PCMO officials will include the Director (Water \nand Irrigation) of BAPPENAS (chairperson) and representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture, \nMinistry of Home Affairs, and Ministry of Settlement and Regional Infrastructure, and they will be \nsupported by technical and accounts staff. The national PCMO will be responsible for the overall \nplanning of project activities; reviewing and consolidating the AWPs and corresponding budget \nestimates received from project EAs and IAs; financial management, monitoring, and evaluation \nof project implementation; coordinating recruitment of consultants; procurement of equipment \nand materials by EAs and IAs; development and operation of the PPMS; and preparing and \nsubmitting reports to the Government and ADB. \n58.  A project organization chart is given in Appendix 8. \n2.  Subproject Selection \n59.  Five core subproject districts in five project provinces were selected and studied during \nthe project preparatory technical assistance phase. In each core subproject district, an irrigation \nscheme was selected and technical, institutional, social, environmental, and economic aspects \nwere studied in detail. Additional subproject districts will be selected for participation in the \nProject in accordance with a selection process. The selection will be made by NSC, based on a \ndistrict application through the Provincial PCMO showing commitment to comply with the policy, \ninstitutional, and financial requirements of the Project. Higher priority will be given to those \ndistricts that (i) have high a incidence of poverty and a high number of established and active \nWUAs, (ii) have started implementing the policies set out under the decentralization laws, \n(iii) commenced  reviews  and  capacity  building  of  district  institutions,  and  (iv) started \nparticipatory  programs  with  WUAs  to  maintain  irrigation  infrastructure.  Subproject  district \nselection criteria are summarized in Appendix 9.  \n3.  Implementation Period \n60.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 7 years, commencing in early 2004. A \nsummary project implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 10.  \n4.  Procurement \n61.  Goods  and  services  financed  wholly  or  partly  by  ADB  lending  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with the ADB Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works for SRR and R&U will be \neligible for loan financing. WUAs will share part of the civil works costs in SRR and R&U in the \nform of cash, labor, or local materials, and such civil works packages will be carried out \nfollowing PAI 3.05 in Appendix 2 to A Guide on Community Participation in Procurement. The \ncontract ceiling during the first year will be  $10,000 equivalent, which may be increased in \nsubsequent  years  to  $25,000  equivalent,  with  prior  ADB  permission,  upon  satisfactory \ncompletion of the  previous contract by the WUA. In the event  that a package exceeds the \nceiling, DWRS will award the contract through local competitive bidding (LCB). Civil works in \nthat  part  of  the  irrigation  scheme  (mostly  headworks  and  main  canals  of  relatively  large \nschemes), which have not been transferred to WUAs, may be carried out by DWRS through \nLCB. LCB contracts costing the equivalent of $100,000 or less will be awarded in accordance \nwith the Government\u2019s standard procedure for such works as set forth in Presidential Decree \nNo.  18/2000  with  necessary  clarifications  and  modifications  for  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. A standard LCB document for civil works will be prepared by \nDGWR and approved by ADB for use in the Project. The contracts will provide for engagement \nof labor and use of local materials to be provided by the WUAs.   ", "    15 \n62.  Equipment to be procured under the Project consists primarily of  that required  for \ncommunications equipment, training materials, vehicles, and office equipment and furniture. All \ncontract packages are expected to be below $500,000 each. Any contract of $500,000 or above \nwill  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding.  Each  contract  with  an \nestimated  cost  of  between  $100,000  and  $500,000  will  be  awarded  through  international \nshopping. Minor equipment and materials costing less than $100,000 will be procured through \ndirect  purchase.  A  tentative  list  of  packages  of  goods  and  services,  excluding  consulting \nservices, is given in Appendix 11. \n5.  Consulting Services \n63.  The Project will require an estimated 1,653 person-months (pm) of consulting services: \n213 international and 1,440 domestic. This  relatively large input  stems from  the need for \ncapacity  building  and  the  expert  assistance  required  to  support  the  highly  decentralized \nimplementation arrangements, and the need for intensive interaction with water users and field-\nlevel  staff  in  widely  dispersed,  small and medium-scale irrigation schemes, and the large \nelement of training and transfer of knowledge in the Project. These requirements also include \nthe services of a domestic accounting firm for financial accounting of the Project and preparing \nquarterly financial monitoring reports for the Project. Consultants will be selected and engaged \nthrough firms in accordance with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to  ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. In selecting \nconsultants, the quality and cost-based selection method will be used. An outline of the terms of \nreference of consulting services is given in Appendix 12. ADB has approved the Government\u2019s \nrequest for advance action for the recruitment of consultants, and the Government has been \nadvised that such approval does not commit ADB to approve the Project.  \n64.  The  Project  will  also  engage  NGOs  and  local  educational  institutions  for  WUA \nstrengthening  and  assist  them  in  IMP  preparation  and  implementation.  The  NGOs  and \ninstitutions will be engaged by WUAs from a list of service providers selected by the province \nconcerned, based on experience and qualifications of the NGOs. District-level training will be \ncontracted out to educational and research institutions and other qualified service providers, as \nthe need arises, in accordance with competitive selection procedures acceptable to ADB. \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n65.  The allocation of funds for project activities will be made annually on the basis of \nconsolidated AWPs approved by NSC and ADB. Loan and grant proceeds and counterpart \nfunds will be channeled through the DIP (development budget allocation to central government \nbudget) and DIPP (development budget allocation to province/district government budget). Fund \nflow arrangements are given in Appendix 13.  \n66.  The  Ministry  of  Finance\u2019s  Directorate  General  of  Budget  will  establish two imprest \naccounts, one for  ADF loan and the other for OCR loan, for each EA at Bank Indonesia to \nexpedite disbursement of loan proceeds, particularly for expenditures under small contracts. \nThe  imprest  accounts  will  be  maintained  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. The initial deposits will be based on expected disbursement for the \nfirst 6 months of implementation, and will not exceed $3 million in aggregate. The statement of \nexpenditure (SOE) procedure may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures for civil \nworks, capacity building, training, small procurements, and NGO services, and to liquidate \nadvances  provided  in the imprest accounts in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook and other arrangements agreed with the Government. \n \n ", "16                                                                                                                                                                                     \n7.  Accounting and Auditing \n67.  Each EA and IA will maintain separate records and accounts for goods and services \nfinanced out of loan proceeds and disclose the use thereof. WUAs will maintain accounts in a \nformat to be specified in IMAs, and their books and records will be open to public access, and \nmay be audited at random by independent auditors to be engaged under the Project. Summary \ninformation on scheme-level expenditures will be posted on office boards for public view. The \nnational PCMO will prepare consolidated financial statements for the Project, and have them \naudited annually in accordance with sound auditing principles by the sovereign audit agency of \nthe Government or other auditors acceptable to ADB. The auditor\u2019s report will also include the \nauditor\u2019s opinion on the use of imprest account and SOE procedures. Copies of audited \naccounts and auditor\u2019s reports will be submitted to ADB within 9 months of the end of each \nfiscal year.  \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n68.  The national PCMO will have overall responsibility for project performance monitoring \nand evaluation. A  PPMS will be designed and put into operation under Part C of the Project \n(para. 41). The PPMS findings will be incorporated in quarterly project progress reports to be \nprepared by the national PCMO. Quarterly project progress reports will be submitted to ADB, \nthe Netherlands embassy in Jakarta, NSC, and the project EAs and IAs within 45 days of the \nend of the reporting period. The national PCMO will also prepare and submit a consolidated \nproject completion report to ADB and the Netherlands embassy within 6 months of  project \ncompletion. \n69.  In addition to regular reviews, a midterm review will be undertaken by ADB jointly with \nthe governments of Indonesia and the Netherlands in 2007 to assess the implementation status, \nreview the project parameters, and take appropriate measures to achieve the project objectives.  \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Benefits \n70.  A major thrust of the Project is the capacity building of district governments and WUAs \nwith regard to sustainable management of irrigation and water resources. A significant part of \nthe project costs relates to these activities. The economic benefits accruing from the investment \nin capacity building cannot be quantified, but the benefits would be realized through enhanced \ntechnical skills and significant efficiency gains in planning and management of irrigation, both at \ngovernment and users\u2019 levels. These gains would result in increased efficiency in delivering \nirrigation and reduced O&M and rehabilitation costs. The cost-effectiveness of the proposed \ninvestment in capacity building would be ensured through a competitive process drawing on \nboth government and private sector service providers. \n71.  Given the sector approach and the participatory emphasis, decisions on the types of \nschemes that would be assisted for O&M, SRR, and R&U would be made at the decentralized \nlevel with possible differential outcomes on the overall economic performance of the Project. \nThe selection criteria would require assessment of the anticipated economic returns at the \nscheme approval stage to ensure individual scheme viability. To provide indicative economic \noutcomes from the project activities, four core schemes were studied and analyzed in detail \nduring the  project preparatory technical assistance. The core schemes represented diverse \nprospective schemes (small and medium-sized, and secondary canals of large schemes, and a \ncombined  use  of  surface  and  groundwater  with  different  technical  and  institutional \ncharacteristics and future potential) and different typology of interventions. The anticipated \neconomic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for the core schemes ranged from 19% to 60% and ", "    17 \nwere not sensitive to cost overruns, incremental benefit shortfall, or appreciation in the value of \nthe local currency against the dollar (Appendix 14, para. 13). \nB.  Financial, Social, and Poverty Reduction Benefits \n72.  Sustaining and improving performance of the irrigation systems would help enhance the \nlivelihoods of rural people, including tenants, owner-cultivators, agricultural laborers, as well as \nlandowners, through higher and more stable incomes. On the core schemes, anticipated per \nhectare incremental incomes  are in the  range of Rp1.2 million\u20132.8 million,  or  26\u2013162% of \nwithout-project levels. Increases are anticipated to be highest in the tail end reaches where \npresent irrigation supplies are lowest in volume and reliability and, as a consequence, cropping \nintensities and crop yields are lowest and incidence of income poverty highest (Appendix 14, \nTables A14.1 and A14.5). Distributional analysis of the core schemes indicates that as much as \n42% of the overall net economic gains would accrue to the tail reaches, accounting for about \n33% of the total service area, which would help reduce income disparities (Appendix 14, Table \nA14.7). The poverty impact analysis of the core schemes indicates that 32% of the net economic \nbenefits would accrue to the poor. With 40% of the population employed in the agriculture sector \nliving below the poverty line, the Project will have a major impact on combating poverty and \nimproving income distribution in the project area. \n73.  Empowering rural people in irrigation system management decision making would help \nbuild  social  capital  within  the  irrigation  management  institutions.  Inclusive  approaches  to \nparticipation in irrigation management would strengthen access to resources and give voice in \ndecision making to disadvantaged members of the community, including the poor and women, \nthereby addressing an important dimension of poverty and governance. The access to irrigation \nwater of poor farmers within the irrigation service area will be safeguarded and participation of \nwomen in irrigation management will be promoted (Appendix 4, Table 2).  \nC.  Policy Impact and Institutional Benefits \n74.  The IMRP and NWRP make a paradigm shift in the Government\u2019s policy on irrigation \nand  water  resources  management,  and  the  Project  will  provide  important  support  for \nimplementing the new policy initiatives. It will help build capacity within and outside government \ninstitutions for a participatory approach to resource management and enhance transparency \nand accountability in management decisions. The policy action transferring the management of \ngovernment schemes  (covering 250,000 ha) to WUAs and  to the district government  that \nassumes the emergency and periodic rehabilitation responsibility on a cost-sharing basis will \nimprove the physical and financial sustainability of irrigation infrastructure. \n75.  The Project will further some of these policy changes through innovation and addition of \nnew elements. It will introduce a fundamental change in the planning of irrigation development \nat regional level through the DIMP approach. DIMP will assist the districts in addressing the \nirrigation management issues in a systematic manner, taking into account the problems and \npotential in the district as a whole, rather than planning to address issues in individual schemes \nin isolation, and with greater efficiency in allocation of resources.  \n76.  The Project  will rationalize and strengthen the institutional arrangements for irrigation \nmanagement at district level and strengthen the technical and managerial skills of staff and \nmake them more responsive to stakeholder needs in the sector. WUAs\u2019 option to source certain \nservices  from  the  private  sector  will  encourage  government  agencies  to  be  more service \noriented. Strengthening of WUAs will improve governance and management at scheme level.  \n77.  The Water Resources Data Center in Jakarta will be integrated into the DGWR regular \norganization structure, and technical and professional capability will be strengthened to provide \n ", "18                                                                                                                                                                                     \nvalue-added services to its users within and outside DGWR. Tools and techniques provided will \nenhance district-level quality assurance and asset management in the water resources sector. \nD.  Environmental Impact \n78.  The project interventions will improve the efficiency of resource use, and  generate a \npositive  environmental  impact.  Any  short-term  negative  impacts  that  might  occur  during \nrehabilitation of some irrigation and drainage structures will be mitigated in accordance with the \nenvironmental management plan (Supplementary Appendix B). \nE.  Sustainability \n79.  The participatory principle underpinning the Project\u2019s design will help develop a sense of \nownership  among  various  stakeholders  and  this,  in  turn,  will  enhance  the  Project\u2019s \nsustainability. The introduction of SRR will break the deferred maintenance cycle, while the \nresulting reduction in the need for major rehabilitation will make available resources to expand \nSRR and to undertake emergency rehabilitation works through the demand-driven, cost-sharing \nmechanism of KIIF. Similarly, the irrigation management transfer to WUAs will relieve the \nGovernment of significant financial costs in subsidizing routine O&M, and government financial \nassistance will then be more effectively used for sustaining and further expanding the reforms. \n80.  The subproject scheme analysis indicates that in financial terms farmers could afford to \npay the incremental O&M costs estimated at Rp85,000 per hectare, which on the core schemes \nrepresents 3\u201314% of the immediate incremental benefits and 3\u20137% of the incremental benefits \nat full development. While the potential ability of the farmers to pay the incremental costs is \nrecognized,  they  will  be  motivated  to  pay  through  a  variety  of  practical  ways  including \n(i) allowing in-kind contributions and promoting transparent accountable institutions  that build \nconfidence among farmers that their fees and contributions will be well used; and (ii) providing \nassurance that the Government will continue to assist in matters beyond local financial capacity, \nin ways that encourage cost sharing with beneficiaries. \n81.  Analysis of the current budget and expenditure patterns for core project districts shows \nthat  on  average  the  counterpart  funding  requirements  for  project  activities  during  project \nimplementation would be about 0.2% and 0.8% of the revenues and development expenditures, \nrespectively.  During  the  post  project  period,  the  annual  funding  requirements  to  fulfill \ngovernment commitments to sustainable irrigation management would be 0.8% of the district \nrevenues and 2.7% of the present development expenditures, respectively.  Assuming that \ncurrent  trends  in  funding  are  maintained,  the  district  governments  would  have  sufficient \nresources to sustain the Project\u2019s impact. \nF.  Risks \n82.  District Participation. All district governments visited during project preparation realize \nthe  importance  of  improving  water  resources  management  and  were  enthusiastic  in \nimplementing sector reforms. However, the risk remains that some districts may not be keen to \nsubject themselves to the transparency requirements and participatory approach demanded by \nthe Project. The risk is mitigated by the sector approach, with project participation determined \non a competitive basis where the potential participating districts are much larger than can be \naccommodated (25 districts out of 63 potential districts will be selected).  \n83.  Interagency Coordination. Much of the authority and responsibility vested to date in \nthe national sector agencies for project implementation will be transferred to local governments, \nand the national agencies will be expected to provide important technical and advisory support \nto the local government agencies concerned. The Project will be implemented during a period of \nevolving decentralization and as a result might face coordination problems between national ", "    19 \nsector agencies and regional governments. The risk  will be mitigated by providing a forum \nthrough NSC for discussing the coordination and related issues. \n84.  Governance and Anticorruption Measures. Good governance assumes an important \ndimension  in  the  Project  because  of  the  emphasis  on  decentralized  implementation.  The \nconcern will be addressed by strengthening both the service delivery and management capacity \nat  district  and  WUA  levels,  and  the  participatory  approach  to  project  planning  and \nimplementation, thereby improving transparency and accountability. District-level activities will \nbe approved and overseen by the  IC comprising government officials and non-government \nmembers including WUA representatives. The activities for legal education, legal services, and \ncommunity capacity building  will also  pay  particular  attention  to  good  governance, and to \nhelping water users understand and act on their rights. Most O&M and repair and rehabilitation \nworks will be carried out by the WUAs, unless these require special skills, techniques, or \nequipment not available locally. A recent audit by the World Bank of works carried out by WUAs \nin JIIWMP confirms that the quality of these works is, in most cases, better than similar works \ncarried out by domestic contractors, and involved lower unit cost. Summary information on \nscheme-level expenditures will be posted on office boards for public view.  The Project  will \nprovide for resources to establish financial management services at national, provincial, and \ndistrict levels and to undertake independent scheme-level audits. \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n85.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  Funds from the loan and grant proceeds and the corresponding counterpart \nfunds,  necessary  to  finance  the  project  activities,  will  be  made  available \nthroughout  the  project  implementation  period  by  earmarking  the  funds, \nnotwithstanding (a) any reallocation of authority or responsibility for channeling of \nexternal  assistance  and  provision  of  corresponding counterpart contributions \nbetween  the  central  Government,  provinces,  and  the  districts  or  (b)  any \nrequirements for provision of matching counterpart funds for funding the project \nactivities  from  each  of  the  participating  districts  arising  from  the  full \nimplementation of Laws Nos. 22 and 25 of 1999 and Ministry of Finance KepMen \nNo. 35 of 2003, unless otherwise agreed by ADB; \n(ii)  The proceeds of the loan and grant will be disbursed to project provinces and \ndistricts throughout the project implementation period by budgetary transfers of \nfunds earmarked for such purposes, unless otherwise agreed by ADB; \n(iii)  All counterpart funds for project implementation will be provided in a timely \nmanner and, to such end, all IAs will submit by 1 September of each year \nthrough the  national PMU concerned to NSC, the AWP and budget for the \nfollowing  fiscal  year,  including  (a) a  report  on  planned  program  and \nachievements during the first 9 months of the current year and the current budget \nsituation; (b) analysis of the next year\u2019s program and fund requirements; and \n(c) the  requested  budget  allocation  from  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds  and \ncounterpart funds; \n(iv)  Each of the participating provinces and districts will approve the CPFPG, and \nCPFPG provisions will be adhered to in case there are any land acquisitions \nand/or resettlements; \n ", "20                                                                                                                                                                                     \n(v)  Selection of subproject districts will be carried out in accordance with the agreed \nselection criteria;  \n(vi)  The  participating  provinces  and  districts  will  establish  environmental \nmanagement and monitoring systems at district level and will comply with the \nrequirements of the EMP; and \n(vii)  The proportion of women participants will be maintained at not less than 33% in \nthe training programs at district level and 15% in training programs at scheme \nlevel, and district irrigation regulations will recommend that the proportion of \nwomen in the elected officials of WUAs will be not less than 15%.  \nB.

Country Poverty Partnership Agreement \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \nIrrigated agriculture is a major source of food and income for rural households below the poverty line and \nfor those above the poverty line, but still at risk of poverty, who depend on irrigation. This includes \nsmallholders and tenant farmers who make up the majority of cultivators. Irrigation reduces risk and \nincreases  livelihood  security.  Equitable  and  secured  access  to  water,  and  participation  in  water \nmanagement has a major impact on the livelihood opportunities for poor rural people. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis \nProposed Classification: Poverty Intervention   Thematic  Classification: Economic Growth and \nGood Governance \nIrrigation increases and stabilizes the production of rice and other crops, ensuring food and income for \nsmall farmers and agricultural laborers in the project provinces. Rural poverty rates in the six provinces \nthat will receive support for irrigation management range from 20% to 29%. The five core subproject \ndistricts have poverty incidence ranging from 18% to 30% against the national average poverty incidence \nof  18.2%.  The  incidence  of  poverty  among  households  employed in agriculture is higher at 40%, \naccounting for 58% of total poor in the country. The incidence of poverty is an important criterion in \nsubproject district selection, and the proportion of poor among the project beneficiaries are expected to \nbe significantly higher than 20%. The poverty impact ratio for the core schemes has been estimated at \n0.32. \n \nC.

Description of the Project \n \n1.  The Project will assist decentralized management of irrigation and water resources, \nimprove the efficiency and productivity of irrigation systems, increase and diversify farm income, \nand  reduce  poverty.  While  capacity  building  at  the  district  government  and  water  user \nassociation (WUA) level will be a major focus of the Project, it will also provide support for \nundertaking  routine  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and  selected  rehabilitation  and \nupgrading (R&U) of existing irrigation schemes. It is these aspects of the Project that were the \nfocus of the initial environmental evaluation (IEE) studies to ensure that the beneficial impacts of \nthe Project are fully realized and any negative impacts are adequately mitigated. Separate IEE \nreports have been prepared for the five core subproject schemes, which then allowed generic \nconclusions to be drawn on the overall environmental impact of the Project.  \n \nB.  Description of the Environment \n \n2.  The six provinces in the project area experience a tropical monsoon climate and benefit \nfrom rainfall brought generally from October to March by the movement of the intertropical zone \nof convergence. The climate of the southern part of South Sulawesi and northern part of Central \nand East Java provinces has a more extended and distinct dry season than other parts in the \nproject area. Climate is also affected by altitude and exposure to prevailing winds so that quite \nhigh rainfall in the higher areas of the drier provinces is more prevalent.  \n \n3.  Within the six provinces, five core subproject districts were studied in detail. The type, \nsize, and number of irrigation schemes in the core subproject districts are given in Table A5.1. \nMost of the schemes are classified as small and medium scale. The absence of large schemes \nshould be noted; these are generally found on flatter terrain and are not being targeted under \nthe Project. \n \nTable A5.1: Irrigation Scheme Type, Size, and Numbers in Core Subproject Districts \n \nArea/Number  Irrigated Area (ha)  Number of Schemes \nType, Size  Sinjai  Banyumas  Garut  Madiun  Lampung  Sinjai,  Banyuma Garut,  Madiun  Lampung \nSouth  Central  West  East  Selatan  South  s, Central  West  East  Selatan \nSulawesi  Java  Java  Java  Lampung  Sulawesi  Java  Java  Java  Lampung \nVillage  17,650  5,949  35,370  0  17,690  122  233  329  0  122 \nPIK  5,770  6,369  5,770  0  0  29  136  29  0  0 \nGovt.-                     \nmanaged \nSmall   2,847  5,398  2,847  8,238  5,840  8  47  8  82  23 \n50\u2013500 ha \nMedium   5,577  3,315  7,577  12,305  9,780  7  4  8  11  13 \n500\u20132,000 \nha \nLarge   0  3,617  0  2,435  0  0  1  0  1  0 \n>2,000 ha \nGroundwater  230  0  230  0  0  12  0  12  0  0 \nTotal  30,314  24,648  51,564  22,973  33,090  159  471  159  94  158 \nha = hectare, PIK = small irrigation schemes \nSource: District Government Inventories from either Sub Dinas Pengairan or BAPPEDA. \n \n4.  The five core subproject irrigation schemes chosen for further analysis were generally \nlocated in areas with a longer dry season, i.e., with 3\u20134 months of less than 100 millimeters \n(mm) rain per month, in rolling to hilly and steep terrain with low average plot sizes, as these \nareas are generally associated with poorer farmer groups. The schemes are generally supplied \n ", "32  Appendix 5 \nby small weirs  that provide run-of-river flows into small to medium-sized canals and supply \nwater to terraced land on plateaus in some of the provinces (West Java, South Sulawesi) and \nrolling to flatter provinces (Lampung, East Java, and Central Java).  \n \n5.  The schemes have been extensively modified by human occupation (sometimes for \ncenturies) so the chances of any interruption to an existing natural ecosystem are considered \nvery low. Also, with the virtual absence of natural ecosystems, there is also very low risk of \nencountering and impacting the habitat of any listed endangered species of flora and fauna. \n \nC.  Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n6.  The IEE findings are summarized in Table A5.2. The IEE has concluded that on balance, \nthe beneficial environmental impacts of the Project will considerably exceed the minor negative \nimpacts that will be associated only with the activities related to rehabilitation and upgrading \n(R&U). The beneficial impacts of the Project include: (i) more efficient allocation of water \nresources, which are increasingly under pressure by other sectors such as urban water supply, \nindustry, and energy; (ii) improved routine O&M resulting from the project focus on increased \ninvolvement of WUA in scheme governance; and (iii) increase in agricultural production through \nmore efficient use brought about by improved O&M and R&U. However, construction activities \nin R&U, if not undertaken properly, may have short-term negative environmental impacts. \nMeasures incorporated in the project design to mitigate  such impacts are discussed in the \nfollowing paragraphs.  \n \n7.  Environmental Management Plan. To ensure that the Project takes full account of its \nenvironmental  responsibilities,  a  project  environment  management  plan  (EMP)  for \nenvironmental impact mitigation has been prepared (Supplementary Appendix B). This EMP will \nbecome part of the operational guidelines and criteria to be placed in the project administration \nmemorandum. Provision has been made for training of WUA members, district water resources \nservices  (DWRS),  and  other  agencies  concerned  on  EMP  requirements,  including \nenvironmental monitoring.  \n \n8.  Problems Related to Construction. Typical short-term negative environmental impacts \nassociated with R&U activities involving weirs and control and drop structures in canals may \ninclude:  (i) the  use  of  borrow  areas, rarely rehabilitated,  such as quarries for construction \nmaterials, leads to unsightly sites along local roads; (ii) the use of river channel materials can \nincrease channel scouring and water  turbidity, which will have short-term impacts on local \nfisheries; (iii) if timber is required for construction, it is often extracted from local forests that are \nin steeper terrain, thus leading to the risk of soil erosion; and (iv)  local traffic patterns are \ndisrupted. Environmental awareness through training and involvement of local WUAs in the \nconstruction activities will minimize the potential negative impacts. Construction in a scheme will \nbe approved in two or three packages to be undertaken by WUAs over 2\u20133 years, and approval \nof second or third package by the district authorities will be subject to fulfillment of several \nconditions, including adherence to the EMP.  \n \n9.  Problems Related to Operations. A potential problem during the operational stages of \nirrigation projects is the pollution of surface  water and groundwater due to the overuse of \ninorganic fertilizers and pesticides. Such overuse has declined significantly in Indonesia due to \nthe withdrawal of subsidies and the increasing awareness of the negative impacts of overuse. \nThe Project will provide continued support to public awareness through agricultural extension \nservices. The water resources information management system component of the project will \nprovide for monitoring of surface  water and groundwater quality in project districts, and the ", "  Appendix 5  33 \nfindings will help assess the effectiveness of project design in controlling agricultural pollution \nand initiate other measures if required. \n \n10.  Environmental  Monitoring.  The  project  performance  management  system \nsubcomponent  for  overall  monitoring  and  assessment  of  project  performance  provides  for \nenvironmental  monitoring,  including  undertaking  baseline  surveys.  There  will  also  be  an \nallocation  of  funds  to  hire  local  nongovernment  organizations,  universities,  or  qualified \nindividuals to carry out ad hoc evaluations or surveys on an as-needed basis. \n \nTable A5.2: Initial Environmental Examination Findings of Core Schemes \n \n  Core  Scheme  Scheme    \nProvince  Subproject  Name  Type  Observation \nDistrict \n         \nLampung  Lampung  Baturaja  Small, multivillage,  Environmental impacts of the \nSelatan  multiethnic  proposed options are of minor \nbackground  significance.

Based on the evidence of the five core subproject schemes examined in the field, the \nenvironmental impacts of the Project are assessed to be of minor significance. Nonetheless, all \nadditional  subprojects  to  be  selected  will  require  environmental  assessments  using  the \nIndonesian  AMDAL  (environmental  assessment)  system  and  the  Project\u2019s  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (Supplementary  Appendix  B).  In  some  circumstances,  the  resulting \nassessment may mean that a detailed environmental impact assessment  would need to be \nprepared as part of project design. However, based on the results of the field work to date, it is \nnot anticipated that  an environmental impact assessment will  be required for the types of \nsubprojects being proposed. \n ", "34  Appendix 6 \nLAND ACQUISITION, RESETTLEMENT AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLES \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  The Project provides for supporting the sustainable operation of irrigation infrastructure \nin subproject schemes through an intensive participatory process. Of the four core subproject \nschemes prepared, two entail minimal land acquisition and none involves any resettlement or \nimpacts on indigenous people (IP). A large number of additional schemes will be selected for \nproject  support  but  none  of  these  is  expected  to  have  any  major  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement (LAR). Similarly, none of these schemes will have any significant impact on \nindigenous  people  requiring  the  preparation  of  an  indigenous  people\u2019s development plan \n(IPDP). Nonetheless, measures have been incorporated in the project design to adequately \naddress land acquisition, resettlement, and IP issues as they occur during the course of project \nimplementation. \n \nB.  General Policy \n \n2.  LAR and IP issues will be handled in accordance with national law and relevant ADB \npolicies.  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (as  detailed  in  the  ADB  Handbook  on \nResettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good  Practice)  requires  the  sector  loans  to  prepare  (i) a \ncompensation policy framework and procedural guidelines (CPFPG) for the subprojects; (ii) an \ninitial poverty and social assessment  for each subproject indicating  the magnitude of  LAR \nimpacts; and (iii) land acquisition and resettlement plans (LARPs) for each subproject whose \ninitial  poverty  and  social  assessment  indicates  significant  LAR  impacts.  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples requires that (i) each initial poverty and social assessment should indicate \nthe magnitude and type of IP impacts; (ii) a specific IP action plan  should be prepared, if \nimpacts  are  limited;  and  (iii) a  stand-alone  indigenous  people\u2019s  development  plan  (IPDP) \nincluding an implementation budget and schedule should be prepared if impacts are severe. A \nCPFPG and an  IP action plan have been prepared to guide the LAR and IP issues of the \nProject. \n \nC.  Compensation Policy Framework and Procedural Guidelines \n \n3.  The CPFPG reflects the main LAR preparation and implementation principles. These \ninclude: (i) negative impacts will be minimized as much as possible; (ii) compensation will be \nsufficient to improve or at least restore pre-project incomes and living standards of affected \npersons;  (iii) affected  persons  will  be  fully  consulted  on  compensation  options  and  land \nacquisition planning; (iv) asset compensation will be provided at replacement rates; and (v) lost \nasset compensation and rehabilitation provisions/allowances will be provided in full before \nground  leveling  and  demolition.  ADB  approval  of  a  subproject  involving  significant  land \nacquisition or resettlement will be subject to ADB's approval of the LARP.  \n \n4.  The CPFPG stipulates eligibility and entitlements for land and eventual house or income \nlosses, and sets rehabilitation subsidies as follows:  \n(i)  permanent agricultural/residential land losses will be compensated in cash at \nmarket rates; \n(ii)  temporary land losses will be paid in cash at market rates;  \n(iii)  house and building losses will be compensated in cash at replacement rates, free \nof demolition expenses and salvaged materials; \n(iv)  crop losses will be paid in cash at market rates;  ", "  Appendix 6  35 \n(v)  relocation expenses covering transport costs will be paid to the affected persons; \nand \n(vi)  compensation for business losses based on tax declarations will be paid to each \naffected person for each month of interruption of business activities. \n \n5.  As  for  LAR  processing  procedures,  CPFPG  establishes  that  (i) after  subproject \nidentification and completion of preliminary design, the district government, as the implementing \nagency (IA), will carry out an initial social assessment (ISA) to determine preliminary impact \ndata and the socioeconomic features of the  affected persons; (ii) if subproject impacts are \nidentified as significant, a full LARP will be prepared; (iii) if impacts are identified as less than \nsignificant, only a short LARP will be prepared. \n \n6.  The CPFPG also details the main organizational features and tasks of the LAR process: \n \n(i)  The Minister of Home Affairs has overall supervisory, reviewing, and financial \nresponsibility  for  LAR.  Water  users  associations  (WUAs)  will  prepare  and \nimplement specific LARPs with the full participation of their members and support \nof  district  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  units  for  tasks  such  as  asset \nvaluation, entitlement delivery, and issuance of land acquisition, demolition, and \nbuilding  permits.  Field  tasks  such  as  paying  compensation,  selecting \nreplacement land, and providing livelihood support will rest with village and WUA \npersonnel. \n \n(ii)  Subproject schemes, including LARPs, will be designed and implemented by the \nWUAs  based  on  an  irrigation  management  plan  prepared  with  the  full \nparticipation  of  WUA  members  and  beneficiary  communities.  A  primer \nsummarizing the CPFPG will be sent to all affected persons and the CPFPG and \nLARP in Bahasa Indonesia will be  made available at the WUA office of each \nscheme that require land acquisition. The same documents in English will be put \non the ADB web site. Primers for subprojects in IP areas will be compiled in local \nlanguages. \n \n(iii)  Grievances will first be lodged within the WUA. If no settlement is reached within \n2 weeks, the complainant will have 1 month to raise the case with the district land \nacquisition and resettlement unit. If still unresolved within 2 weeks, the case \nshould be sent to the office of the  bupati (district governor). Final appeal is \navailable in the courts \n \n(iv)  Both internal and external monitoring of LAR will be carried out. The district \ngovernment will set a monthly reporting system involving the land acquisition and \nresettlement  units.  External  monitoring  will  be  assigned  to  an  independent \ninstitution such an NGO or a local university. External monitoring will be carried \nout on a selective basis for schemes with substantial impacts resulting from LAR \nand/or involvement of vulnerable peoples. External monitoring will be conducted \nthrough one or two field visits, and monitoring reports will be submitted to the \ndistrict project coordination and monitoring office which in turn will pass them to \nthe national project coordination and monitoring office.  At project conclusion, the \nexternal monitoring agency will prepare a report providing a comprehensive \nevaluation of the LAR program. \n \n ", "36  Appendix 6 \n(v)  Unit compensation rates for items negatively affected by each subproject and \ndetailed budgets for impacts compensation will be provided in each LARP. Cost \nestimates will be adjusted annually, based on the inflation rate of the preceding \nyear.  \n \nD.  Indigenous People\u2019s Participatory Planning Framework \n \n7.  \"Isolated  vulnerable  peoples\"  (IVPs)  is  the  term  used  officially  by  the  Indonesian \nGovernment to describe groups that have the characteristics of \"indigenous people\" as used in \nADB policy (the rest of this appendix will use the term \u201cIVPs\u201d). For the purposes of this Project, \nIVPs are defined as those that present varying degrees of the following characteristics: (i) a \nclose attachment to ancestral territories and to the natural resources in these areas; (ii) self-\nidentification  and  identification  by  others  as  members  of  a  distinct  cultural  group;  (iii) an \nindigenous  language,  different  from  the  common  regional  language;  (iv) the  presence  of \ncustomary social and political institutions; and (v) primarily subsistence-oriented production \nactivities. \n \n8.  IVPs are not prevalent in all the potential project locations and were not identified during \nfield works for the subproject schemes. It is possible that they may be found in some areas of \nthe provinces of Lampung and South Sulawesi during implementation of the Project. The \nfollowing steps will be taken to ensure that, where groups of IVPs exist, the Project caters to \ntheir specific needs: \n \n(i)  During the facilitator training, facilitators will be trained in the identification of \nIVPs.  Through  baseline  surveys  and  community  self-help  exercises  and \ndiscussions  on  community  empowerment,  facilitators  will  identify  the \npresence and numbers of groups of IVPs in the community and report this to \ntheir supervisor; \n \n(ii)  For  the  areas  where  groups  of  IVPs  are  identified,  the  supervisor  will \norganize  orientation  training  for  relevant  facilitators  in  how  to  work  with \ngroups  of  IVPs  in  a  useful  way  to  identify  mechanisms  for  effective \nparticipation, and address specific challenges in working with such groups;  \n \n(iii)  Facilitators will be hired locally to the extent possible and will be familiar with \nsuch groups. They will also be rotated as necessary to ensure that those that \nhave been trained in working with groups of IVPs, or have specific skills that \nwould be beneficial in working with such groups, are made available in the \nright places; \n \n(iv)  Where groups of IVPs are identified, efforts will be made to ensure that at \nleast one community cadre is from the group and able to communicate easily \nwith the group; and \n \n(v)  Where  the  isolated  vulnerable  group  speaks  a  language  different  from \nBahasa Indonesia, relevant brochures and documents will be translated into \nthe appropriate language. \n \n9.  These steps will be aimed at ensuring that IVPs participate fully in the Project, are aware \nof their rights and responsibilities, and are able to voice their needs during the community ", "  Appendix 6  37 \nsurvey exercise and irrigation subprojects formulation. In addition,  IVPs will be encouraged to \nsubmit subproject proposals that cater to groups\u2019 needs. \n \n10.  Initiatives under the IP action plan will be commensurate with the impact severity level of \neach subproject affecting vulnerable groups. Impact severity is defined based on the degree of \nvulnerability of the affected peoples and the type of impacts, i.e: \n \n(i)  limited  impacts  occur  when  (a)  the  affected  peoples  are  fully  integrated  in \nmainstream society and in control of the local administrative system, and/or (b) \nimpacts do not have broad community or sociocultural dimensions; and \n \n(ii)  severe  impacts  occur  when  (a)  the  affected  peoples  maintain  a  degree  of \nsociocultural  and  institutional  distinction  from  mainstream  society  and/or  (b) \nimpacts carry a broad sociocultural dimension and have wide community effects. \n \n11.  Action  for  limited  impacts  will  include  a  brief  assessment  of  the  affected  peoples\u2019 \nsocioeconomic and cultural status and the strategy and outline of actions to address associated \nconcerns. The action plan will be included in the irrigation management plan (IMP) or the LARP. \nAction  for  severe  impacts  will  be  documented  in  a  stand-alone  IPDP  providing  (i) an \nassessment of the affected peoples\u2019 situation; (ii) an assessment of eventual LAR impacts and \nrelated  compensation  plan,  and  (iii) a  community  action  plan  (CAP)  detailing  needed \nrehabilitation/development  provisions  and  related  implementation  mechanisms/processes. \nIPDPs will be designed/implemented through a participatory framework involving the affected \npeoples and other stakeholders and will include specific budgets and schedules. The likelihood \nof a stand-alone IPDP being necessary for the Project is very low as a review of typical \nschemes has concluded that only minor impacts involving LAR may result from the rehabilitation \nand upgrading of existing irrigation schemes. \n \n12.  Where IVPs  are  identified,  the  irrigation  commission will require the district project \nimplementation unit to report on the IVPs\u2019 participation in the Project.

Introduction \n1.  Financial and economic analyses were undertaken to evaluate the sustainability of the \nfive core subproject schemes selected as basis in preparing the Project. Financial analysis \nexamined the sustainability of the subproject schemes from farmers\u2019 points of view; economic \nanalysis  determined  the  incremental  benefits  from  the  expected  increase  in  agricultural \nproduction following improved scheme operation. \nB.  Major Assumptions \n2.  The Project has an implementation period of 7 years and the economic life of the project \ninterventions has been assumed to be 20 years. For this analysis, the interbank exchange rate of  \nRp8,500 per US dollar prevailing at the time of project appraisal, has been used. A discount rate \nof 12% has been used to ascertain the net present value (NPV) and also as a cut-off point for the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR). \n3.  Financial benefits and costs are estimated in constant mid-year 2002 terms. Financial \nfarmgate prices are based on findings of the surveys undertaken for the feasibility study during \n2002. The analysis uses a world price numeraire where economic prices for traded crop outputs \nand inputs have been based on the World Bank Commodity Price Projections. Prices for rice \npaddy, soybeans, and phosphatic and potassic fertilizers are estimated at import parity, while \nthose for nitrogenous fertilizers at export parity (Supplementary Appendix E). Labor costs have \nbeen shadow-priced at 0.80 of the wage rates while other inputs have been adjusted by the \nstandard conversion factor of 0.90. Due to technical, management, and institutional factors, \nirrigation  supplies  within  a  given  scheme  are  unevenly  distributed,  resulting  in  significant \ndifferences in cropping patterns, cropping intensities, and yields in different reaches within the \nservice area. Table A14.1 shows that with one exception, the cropping intensity declines and \nincidence of poverty rises as one moves further down on an irrigation system. Using crop models \nfor the overall scheme and the reach specific cropping pattern and cropping intensity data, \nreach- and scheme-specific farm models have been developed. For the financial analysis, only \nthe hired labor has been costed while for the economic analyses both family and hired labor has \nbeen costed. Farm models and budgets are given in Supplementary Appendix E. \nTable A14.1: Reach-Wise Differences in Cropping Intensity and Poverty Incidence \n(%) \nItem  Upper Reach  Middle Reach  Tail Reach  Overall \nA.

Project Benefits \n5.  Benefit  Area  and  Households.  The  Project  will  strengthen  irrigation  and  water \nresources management capacity of 25 district governments and will train 5,000 district staff. \nWhile the participatory and needs-based nature of the Project makes it difficult to determine the \nlevel and combinations of training activities on a particular scheme, it is anticipated that 36,250 \nmembers from 6,250 water users associations (WUAs) will be trained. It is envisaged that 6,250 \nschemes benefiting from the Project will cover about 0.63 million hectares (ha) of irrigated area \nand will represent 1.5 million households. Table 14.2 summarizes the project coverage in terms \nof beneficiary population and area. \nTable A14.2: Project Beneficiary Population and Area \n \nHousehold \nNumber of  Coverage  Irrigated Area Coverage \nDistricts/WUAs/Schemes  WUAs/Schemes  (\u2019000)  (ha) \nWUAs Receiving Capacity Building  6,250  1,500  625,000 \nWUAs Receiving O&M Support  2,500  600  250,000 \nWUAs Receiving SRR Support  6,250  1,500  625,000 \nSchemes Receiving R&U  1,376  330  137,600 \nO&M = Operation and Maintenance; R&U = Rehabilitation and Upgrading; WUA = Water Users\u2019 Association \nSource: PPTA 3793 Final Report 2002. \n \n6.  Quantified Benefits. In the with-project scenario, the main agricultural benefits will be in \nthe form of increased cropping intensities and improved dry season rice yields. It is the lower \nreaches of irrigation systems in the dry season when the water shortages are most obvious. \nFarmers in the upper reaches can grow two or more crops while those in the lower reaches \ncannot  fully  cultivate  during  the  dry  season.  Current  yields  in  general  are  lower  than  the \nprovincial averages suggesting large yield disparities within the provinces and highlighting the \npotential for improvement. Disparities are also significant between the seasons where  on the \nsame field and with some management skills, the dry season yields are 13% to 20% lower than \nthe wet season levels. It is anticipated that management and infrastructure improvements will \nlead to higher cropping intensities and improved rice yields in both wet and dry seasons, with the \nhighest increases in the reaches that are water short at present.  \n7.  In the without-project scenario, the practice of deferred maintenance is expected to \ncontinue and as a result system efficiencies are expected to deteriorate, which will in turn lead to \nlower  cropping  intensities,  lower  rice  yields,  and  greater  income  inequalities.  Detailed \nengineering assessments carried out on the sample schemes show that over the next 20 years \nas much as one third of the annual agricultural production can erode away. To be on the more \nconservative side, the analysis assumes that in the absence of the Project, lost production over a \nperiod of 20 years will be only 10% of the prevailing levels. \n8.  Given that present rice yields in the core schemes are lower than the provincial averages \nand that irrigation supplies can be significantly improved, the feasibility study findings envisage \nthat on the sample schemes the yields can increase by 15% to 75% and cropping intensities by \nup to 40%. For the purposes of this analysis, more conservative yield and cropping intensity \nincreases  have  been  assumed.

Nonquantified Benefits. Apart from the crop production benefits, there are a number of \nbenefits that cannot be readily quantified, including (i) improved planning and management of \nirrigation assets brought about by the district irrigation management plans at district level and \nirrigation management plan at scheme level; (ii) rationalization and capacity building of district-\nlevel services; (iii) empowerment (including legal empowerment) of WUAs and their female \nmembers;  (iv) reduced  cost  and  improved  quality  of  rehabilitation  resulting  from  greater \ninvolvement of WUAs in scheme governance; and (v) improved access to quality information and \ndata for water resources management. Benefits derived from institutional strengthening and \ngood governance will have a wider impact in the project districts.  \n10.  A number of nonquantified benefits in reality are also critical institutional improvements \nrequired in bringing about and sustaining the quantified benefits, and the benefits attributed to \nthese are actually positive externalities. For example, the organization and capacity building of \nWUAs is a basic building block of project implementation and sustainability. However, besides \nincreased production, the full benefits also include a legally aware and civic-minded body of \npeople and more transparent project implementation, both of which have an impact that is not \njust limited to project implementation. \nD.  Assessment of Financial Returns to Irrigators \n11.  Results of the financial analyses are summarized in Table A14.5. The results show that at \nfull development, the net farm incomes are expected to increase by 26% to 162%. With the \nexception of farms in the middle reach of the scheme in Banyumas where control on flooding in \nthe middle reach will greatly improve crop production, increases in farm income are anticipated \nto be highest on the tail reaches and lowest on the upper reaches. Given that the incidence of \npoverty is highest in the tail reaches and the lowest in the upper reaches, higher incremental \nfarm incomes to the lower reaches will help reduce the current  income inequalities.

Assessment of Economic Returns \n12.  Investment and Recurrent Costs. All costs are in constant year 2002 terms. Investment \ncosts are net of price contingencies and interest during construction. The local content of the \ncosts has been adjusted by the standard conversion factor while the foreign component has \nbeen taken at its full value. The district-level capacity building and project coordination and \nmonitoring, including the relevant consultant inputs, help deliver the planned interventions and \nservices, and hence costs  of these are appropriately apportioned to individual schemes. The \ncosts associated with project coordination and monitoring have also been apportioned among \ncomponents  according  to  the  relative  size  of  investment  costs  on  these  and  included  as \noverheads. \n13.  Economic Worth. Results of the economic analysis summarized in Table A14.6 show \nthat the EIRR for individual schemes ranges from 19% to 60% and the NPV at a discount rate of \n12% ranges from $0.04 million to $0.48 million. The schemes generate a collective EIRR of 29% \nand an NPV of $0.82 million. Switching values have been estimated to determine the maximum \ncost overrun and the maximum reduction in incremental benefits at which the scheme will still be \neconomically  viable.  Collectively,  sample  schemes  remain  economically  viable  with  cost \noverruns of up to 102% or reduction in the incremental benefits of up to 50%. In view of the \nrecent appreciation in the value of rupiah, the lowest exchange rate against the US dollar at \nwhich the individual schemes will remain viable has been estimated to range from Rp6,064 to \nRp7,605 and for the collective sample, Rp6,246. \nTable A14.6: Anticipated Scheme Level Economic Worth \n \n  Switching Values \nScheme  EIRR  NPV  Cost  Incremental Benefit  Exchange Rate a \n(%)  ($ \u2018000)  Overrun (%)  Shortfall (%)  (Rp/$) \nBaturaja\u2013South Lampung  20    44    46  31  7,097 \nSerayu/Gambarsari\u2013Banyumas  28    128    108  52  6,064 \nSewu\u2013Madiun  60    479    285  74  6,090 \nBalakia\u2013Sinjai  19    172    40  28  7,605 \nAll Sample Schemes  29    823    102  50  6,246 \nEIRR= economic internal rate of return; NPV= net present value; Rp = rupiah \na  Fluctuations in the exchange rate will affect the foreign exchange component of the construction and O&M costs \nand the economic prices of traded inputs and outputs.

Poverty Impact Assessment \n14.  Table A14.7 summarizes the poverty impact analysis and calculation of the poverty \nimpact ratio (PIR)4 for the four core schemes. The net economic benefits from crop production \n(difference in net present value of economic and financial benefits) are estimated to be about \n                                                 \n4   PIR compares net economic benefits to the poor with net economic benefits of the Project. \n ", "52  Appendix 14 \nRp966.3 million of which 74% are expected to accrue on the tail reaches of the system. Gains for \nthe labor are expected to be about Rp421.0 million from scheme improvement activities and \nRp105.4 million from the operation and maintenance activities. Given that the hired labor will only \nbe required where the works are contracted out, the gains to the hired labor are expected to be \nabout Rp105.2 million.2 Government revenue gains amount to Rp491.1 million from the system \nimprovement activities and Rp5.5 million from the operation and maintenance activities. Overall \nnet economic gains are expected to be about Rp2,062.8 million of which 11% accrue to the \nirrigators on the upper reaches, while 17% and 42% accrue to the irrigators in the middle and tail \nreaches, respectively. The anticipated share of the hired labor is expected to be about 5% and \nthat of the Government about 24%. \n15.  Apportioning the gains between the poor and those above the poverty line within each of \nthe irrigator subgroups and labor, and assuming that government tax revenues will be evenly \nexpended among the population, the Project yields a PIR of 0.32. \nTable A14.7: Poverty Impact Ratio, Core Schemes  \n(Rp million) \n \n  Financial  Economic  Net  Irrigators  Irrigators  Irrigators  Labor  Govt./  Overall \nBenefits/  Present  Present  Economic  on the  on the  on the  Economy \nCosts  Valuea  Valuea  Benefits  Upper  Middle  Tail \nReach  Reach  Reach \n                   \nIncremental Benefits                   \n Net Output                    \n - Upper Reach    4,551    4,621    71    70           \n - Middle Reach    3,009    3,194    185      185         \n - Tail Reach    6,121    6,833    712        712       \nIncremental Costs                   \nImplementation Costs   -4,911   -4,920    491         491     \nLabor-Implementation   -2,105   -1,684    421    105    105    105       \n  O&M                   \n- Materials & Equip. by    -55    -50    6          6     \nGovt. \n- Materials & Equip. by    -735    -662    74    25    25    25       \nWUAs and WUAF \n- Labor    -527    -422    105    35    35    35       \nNet Present Use    5,348    7,411    2,083    235    350    876   105    497   \nGains and Losses          235    350    875   105    497   2,083 \nProportions of the          26    33    42    25    18   \nPoor (%) b c \nNet Benefits to the            61    115    368    28    90    683 \nPoor \nPoverty Impact Ratio                     0.32 \nO&M = operation and maintenance, WUA = water users association, WUAF = water users association federation. \na At a discount of 12%. \nb Based on project preparatory technical assistance survey data. \nc To be on the conservative side, poverty incidence for labor has been assumed at the rural poverty incidence. \nd Government of Indonesia.

Budget and expenditure patterns for the core project districts were analyzed to ascertain \navailability of the counterpart funding (i) to implement the project activities, and (ii) to sustain the \nproject activities in the  post project period. The 2000 budget and expenditures data for core \nproject  districts  was  inflated  to  2002  levels  and  was  compared  with  counterpart  funding \nrequirements for an average district. During course of the project implementation, counterpart \nfunding  requirements  are  anticipated  to  range  from  Rp14 million  in  the  first  year  to \nRp1,046 million in the third year, which on average are 0.2% of the revenue and 0.8% of the \ndevelopment expenditures.
