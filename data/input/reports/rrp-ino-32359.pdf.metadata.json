The  IMRP \nemphasizes  a  participatory  approach  to  the  management  of \nirrigation and water resources in a decentralized administrative and \nfiscal  framework.  The  salient  aspects  of  the  Project  include: \n(i) strengthening  of  the  capacity  of  district  governments  to  act  as \nthe  focal  point  for  development  and management of irrigation and \nwater  resources;  (ii) strengthening  and  empowering  of  the  water \nusers  associations  (WUAs)  and  their  federations  (WUAFs)  for \neffective  participation  in  irrigation  management;  (iii) transfer  of \nirrigation  management \n(iv) technical  and \nfinancial assistance to WUAs/WUAFs for undertaking needs-based \nrepair  and  rehabilitation  of  selected  structures \nirrigation \nschemes;  (v) establishment  of  a  water  resources  information  and \nasset  management;  and  (iv) support  for  project  coordination  and \nmonitoring  including  establishment  of  a  project  performance \nmanagement system at district, provincial, and national levels.  \n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  25  districts  in  the  provinces  of \nLampung, Banten, West Java, Central Java, East Java, and South \nSulawesi.  \n \nIrrigated  agriculture  has  helped  Indonesia  substantially  increase \nfood production, create rural employment, and reduce poverty. The \ndevelopment  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  irrigation \nhave  claimed a significant part of public resources, but the sector \ncontinues  to  have  inadequate,  inappropriate,  and  dilapidated \ninfrastructure.  Consequently,  physical  and  fiscal  sustainability  of \nirrigated  agriculture  has  been  a  matter  of  concern  for  the \nGovernment and its development partners. \n \nThe  O&M  and  sustainability  issues  were  studied  in  the  1990s \nunder various investment and technical assistance projects. These \nstudies  concluded  that  major  constraints  to  sustainable  irrigation \nmanagement  were:  (i) policy and  institutional  constraints,  (ii) weak \nand low level of stakeholder participation, and (iii) and inadequate \nassessment  and  funding  of  O&M.  As  a  major  departure  from  the \ntraditional  top-down  decisions  focusing  on  construction  activities, \nthe  Government  launched  in  1995  the  ADB-assisted  Farmer \nManaged Irrigation Systems Project with direct involvement of local \ngovernments  and  beneficiary  farmers  in  the  decision-making \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nof \n\nand \n\nirrigation; \n\n(ii) transferring \n\ngovernments  and  beneficiary  farmers  in  the  decision-making \nprocess,  with  farmer  contribution  toward  O&M  and  scheme \nrehabilitation  and  upgrading  costs.  This  was  followed  by  large-\nscale  pilot-testing  of  a  program  of  major  policy  and  institutional \nirrigation  and  water \nreforms  under  a  World  Bank-assisted \nresources  management  project.  The  initial  results  were  highly \nencouraging  and  formed  the  basis  of  comprehensive  policy \nreforms in water resources and irrigation management initiated by \nthe Government in 1999.  \n \nIn 1999, the Government formally adopted  the  IMRP, which was \nsupported  by  a  law  issued  in  2001. The  IMRP  aims  at  (i) making \ndistrict  governments  responsible  for  planning,  development,  and \nmanagement \nirrigation \nmanagement to WUAs/WUAFs. In 2001, the Government adopted \na new national water resources policy to promote integrated water \nresources management within a basin to ensure sustainable use of \nwater  resources  by  various  sectors.  A  bill  for  a  Water  Law, \nincorporating the IMRP and  the national water resources policy, is \npresently being reviewed by the national Parliament. \n \nThe  proposed  project  forms  part  of  a  joint  initiative  by  multilateral \nand  bilateral  funding  agencies  involved  in  Indonesia\u2019s  water \nresources sector to provide technical and financial assistance in a \ncomplementary  manner  to  support  implementation  of  the  sector \nreforms. The ongoing administrative and fiscal decentralization and \nthe  water  sector  reforms  are  mutually  reinforcing  and  provide  a \nunique  opportunity  to  improve  and  ensure  the  sustainability  of \nwater resources development and irrigated agriculture. \n \nThe  long-term  objectives  are  increased  economic  growth  and \nreduced  poverty  in  25  districts  of  rural  Indonesia.  The  immediate \nobjectives are decentralized management of irrigation systems on \na sustainable basis and increased yields of irrigated crops.  \n \nThe  Project  will  cost  about  $126.0 million  equivalent  comprising \n$30.6 million  in  foreign  exchange  and  $95.4 million  equivalent  in \nlocal currency. \n\nSource \n\nForeign  \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n($ million) \n\nPercentage \n\n5.7 \n20.5 \n4.4 \n- \n\nADB through ADF \nADB through OCR \nNetherlands Grant \nCentral and Regional  \n   Governments  \nWUAs  \nTotal \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund,  \nOCR = ordinary capital resources, WUA = water users association. \n\n13.3 \n33.5 \n10.6 \n25.5 \n\n19.0 \n54.0 \n15.0 \n25.5 \n\n12.5 \n126.0 \n\n- \n30.6 \n\n12.5 \n95.4 \n\n15.1 \n42.8 \n11.9 \n20.2 \n\n10.0 \n100 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nObjectives \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nv\n\nLoan Amount and Terms  $54.0 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and \n$19.0 million  from  its  Asian  Development  Fund  resources.

A  national  steering  committee  will \nproject \nguidance \nprovide \nimplementation,  and  will  be  assisted  by  a  national  project \ncoordination  and  monitoring  office  (PCMO).  Each  executing \nagency  will  establish  a  national  project  management  unit  (PMU). \nEach  participating  province  and  district  will  establish  a  provincial \nPCMO  and  district  PCMO.  Each  district  will  establish  an  irrigation \ncommission  (IC)  comprising  government  and  nongovernment \nmembers,  for  planning  and  management  of  irrigation  within  their \nrespective  districts.  WUAs  will  be  assisted  to  develop  irrigation \nmanagement  plans  (IMPs)  for  their  schemes.  IMPs  will  be \nreviewed and approved by ICs and will be implemented by WUAs. \nRehabilitation  and  upgrading  works  of  irrigation  schemes  will  be \ncarried out by WUAs on a cost-sharing basis.  \n \n(i) Directorate  General  of  Water \nExecuting  agencies  are: \nResources  of \nthe  Ministry  of  Settlement  and  Regional \nInfrastructure,  (ii) Directorate General of Regional Development of \nthe  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  and  (iii) Directorate  General  of \nAgricultural Facilities of the Ministry of Agriculture. \n \nAll goods and related services financed under the ADB loan will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  \n \nAn  estimated  1,653  person-months  (pm)  of  consulting  services, \ninternational  and  1,440  pm  domestic \ncomprising  213  pm \nconsultants,  will  be  required  to  assist  the  Government  and  WUAs \nin  implementing  the  Project.

WUAs/WUAFs  covering  about  625,000 \nhectares  (ha)  will  be  strengthened.  About  250,000  ha  of  service \nthrough  a  partnership \narea  will  be \narrangement requiring them to bear full O&M costs within  3 years \nof  transfer.  Improved  irrigation  performance  will  benefit  some \n1.5 million \nthem  are  poor \nsmallholders  or  landless  tenants.  The  inclusive  approaches  to \nparticipation  in  irrigation  management  will  strengthen  access  to \nresources  and  give  voice  in  the  decision-making  process  to \ndisadvantaged members of the community, including  the poor and \nwomen, thereby addressing an important dimension of poverty and \ngovernance. \n \nBased  on  an  analysis  of  the  five  core  subproject  schemes, \nanticipated incremental farm income would range from 26\u2013162% of \nwithout-project  levels.  Distribution  analysis  in  the  core  schemes \nindicates  that  as  much  as  42%  of  the  overall  net  economic  gains \nwould accrue to the tail reaches, constituting about one third of the \nservice area. A poverty impact analysis of these schemes indicates \nthat 32% of the net economic benefits would accrue to the poor. \n \n\nimplementation  of \n\nthe  Project  will  require \nstakeholders  concerned  to  agree  and  adjust  to  the  policy  and \ngovernance  regime  changes  that  are  being  promoted  by  the \nProject.  While  most  of  the  stakeholders  involved  in  the  ongoing \nreform  initiatives  have  been  receptive  to  these  changes,  some  \nmay be slow in responding to the needs for change during project \nimplementation.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  a  demand-driven \nsector  approach  and  by  the  emphasis  on  public  information and \ncapacity building activities during initial years. \n \nThe  governance  risks  associated  with  decentralization  will  be \nmitigated  through  improved  service  delivery  and  management \ncapacity  at  district  and  WUA  levels  and  enhanced  transparency \nand  participation  in  project  implementation.  Provision  has  been \nmade  for  media  dissemination  and  information  campaigns  about \nthe  Project,  resources  made  available  for  the  Project,  and  the \nexpected  outputs.  District-level  activities  will  be  approved  and \noverseen by the  IC. Most O&M and repair and rehabilitation works \nin  irrigation  systems  will  be  carried  out  by  WUAs.  A  local \naccounting  firm  will  assist  in  maintaining  and  monitoring  project \naccounts at district and provincial levels. \n\nRisks and Assumptions  The  successful \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \n\n1. \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Participatory Irrigation Sector Project.1 \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Analysis of Irrigated Agriculture \n\n2. \nAgriculture in Indonesia is dominated by rice and, more generally food crop cultivation. \nAbout  82%  of  the  rice  produced  in  the  country  is  grown  under  irrigation.  Irrigated  agriculture \ncovers 6.2 million hectares (ha), of which about 60% is served by large systems (greater than \n4,000 ha) and medium systems (500 ha to 4,000 ha), and the remaining 40% is served by small \nsystems  (below  500  ha).  Of  the  total  irrigated  area,  5.0 million  ha  are  publicly  managed  and \n1.2 million  ha,  all  comprising  small  systems,  are  managed  by  farmers.  The  average  cropping \nintensity is 155% with an average paddy yield of about 4.5 metric tons (t)/ha.2  \n\n3. \nInvestment  in  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure  was  a  major  component  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  agriculture  and  rural  development  strategy  from  1969  to  1999.  Given  the \navailability  of  cheap  labor,  fertile  land,  plentiful  water  resources,  and  favorable  climatic \nconditions, irrigation investments were economically efficient and helped improve food security \nand  reduce  rural  poverty.  As  a  result  of  these  investments,  rice  production  increased  at  4.8% \nper annum over the period  1969\u20131989  when  Indonesia  moved  from  being  one  of  the  world\u2019s \nmajor  rice  importers  to  achieving  and  maintaining  trend  self-sufficiency  (since  1984).3 \nIndonesia\u2019s current position with regard to food security is, however, fragile and during the latter \nhalf  of  the  1990s,  it  depended  on  international  markets  for  up  to  10%  of  its  annual \nrequirements.4  \n\n4. \nIntensive  cultivation  of  rice,  a  labor-intensive  crop,  increased  rural  incomes  and \nsubstantially contributed to the reduction of rural poverty incidence from 40% in 1970 to 16.5% \nin  1997.  The  financial  crisis  in  1997  and  successive  occurrences  of  El  Ni\u00f1o  and widespread \ndrought  raised  the  poverty  incidence  to  23.5%  in  1999.  The incidence  came  down  to  about \n18.2%  in  2002,  with  urban  and  rural  poverty  incidence  at  14.4%  and  21.1%,  respectively. \nDespite  these  difficulties,  about  43%  of  the  country\u2019s  labor  force  is  employed  in  agriculture, \nmostly in rice production and related activities.  \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nSustainability of Irrigated Agriculture \n\n5. \n Notwithstanding  its  impressive  contribution  to  food  security  and  people\u2019s  welfare, \nirrigated agriculture faces increasingly complex problems, and the viability and sustainability of \nirrigation  has  been  a  major  concern  of  the  Government  and  its  development  partners.  The \ndevelopment and operation and maintenance (O&M) of irrigation claimed a significant share of \npublic  resources  invested  in  agriculture,  but  the  sector  continues  to  have  inadequate, \ninappropriate,  and  decaying  infrastructure.  This  unsatisfactory  status  of  irrigation  facilities  is \nlargely  due  to  inadequate  O&M.  Irrigation  O&M  has  been  the  responsibility  of  provincial \n\n                                                 \n1    ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of  Indonesia for Participatory Irrigation Sector Project.  Manila \n\n2   \n\n(TA No. 3793-INO, for $800,000, approved in December 2001) \nIn  comparison,  the  average  cropping  intensity  and  paddy  yield  under  irrigated  conditions  in  the  Philippines  are \n137% and 3.7 t/ha, respectively.   \n\n3   Trend  self-sufficiency,  in  contrast  to  absolute  self-sufficiency,  implies  maintaining  rice  production  at  or  near \nconsumption levels so that in years of good harvest, Indonesia may export marginal quantities of rice and import \nsimilar small amounts in years of poor harvest.   \n\n4   Rice imports peaked at 4.75 million metric tons in 1999. \n\n\f2                                                                                                                                                                                     \n\ngovernments,  with  funding  support  from  the  national  Government,  but  a  de  facto  \u201cdeferred \nmaintenance culture\u201d has necessitated major periodic rehabilitation of facilities. The investment \nin  such  rehabilitation  is  substantially  higher  than  what  would  have  been  the  cost  if  there  had \nbeen adequate routine and periodic maintenance. \n\n In 1987, the Government adopted the irrigation operation and maintenance policy aimed \n6. \nat addressing the sustainability issue through a set of measures including (i) ensuring adequate \nand  timely  O&M  funding,  (ii) gradual  introduction  of  irrigation  service  fees,  (iii) improved \ngovernment  management  of  large  irrigation  systems,  and  (iv) transfer of irrigation systems of \nless  than  500  hectares  to  water  users  associations  (WUAs).  Despite  some  apparent  initial \nsuccesses, the irrigation operation and maintenance policy failed to improve irrigation O&M and \nsustainability, largely because of inadequate involvement of local governments and WUAs in the \nformulation  of  the  policy  and  its  implementation.  O&M  budgets  were  raised  to  $80 million \nequivalent  in  1987  and  remained  at  that  level  until  1997,  but  60\u201385%  of  this  was  used  to \nsupport provincial staff and the balance for urgent repair and rehabilitation activities. There was \nno  provision  of  government  accountability  for  services  to  farmers,  and  the  farmers  were  not \nconvinced  that  payment  of  irrigation  service  fees  (in  effect,  a  central  government  tax  on \nirrigation)  would  improve  government  services.  The  small  scheme  management  turnover \nprogram  to  WUAs  achieved  about  one  third  of  its  target,  but  the  program  objectives  were  not \nachieved as most of the WUAs were established following a top-down approach, and provisions \nfor post turnover government guidance and support were unclear.  \n\n7. \nThe  O&M  and  sustainability  issues  were  studied  in  the  1990s  under  various  ongoing \nprojects and programs including the  Technical  Assistance  (TA) for Assessment of Options for \nSustainable  Irrigation  Development.5  These  reviews  and  other  studies  concluded  that  major \nconstraints  to  sustainable  irrigation  management  were  (i) policy  and  institutional  constraints, \n(ii) weak and low level of stakeholder participation, and (iii) inadequate assessment and funding \nof O&M. \n\n  The  policy  guidelines  and  regulatory  frameworks  for  the  water  resources  sector,  as \n8. \nprovided in the Water Law No. 11 of 1974, placed the central Government at the focal point for \nplanning, development, and management of all activities for the sector including irrigation. The \ncentral Government\u2019s functions as provider and regulator of water sector activities were shared \nby  various  agencies,  with  fragmented  mandates  and  responsibilities.  The  former  Directorate \nGeneral  of  Water  Resources  Development  (DGWRD),  the  key  agency  in  the  sector,  was \nresponsible for irrigation development and it implemented its projects through offices set up in \nthe  provinces  for  this  purpose.  The  provincial  governments  maintained  their  own  provincial \nwater  resources  services , which were responsible for O&M. District governments\u2019 involvement \nin  irrigation  was  mostly  in  the  provision  of  agricultural  services,  with  little  or  no  participation  in \nirrigation development and O&M.  \n\n  The  national  and  provincial  agencies  delivered  the  services  with  little  participation  of \n9. \nfarmer  beneficiaries  and  their  institutions.  In  developing  farmer  institutions, emphasis was on \nfollowing  a  top-down  uniform  model,  leading  to  the  establishment  of  nominal  WUAs  that  were \nmostly  inactive  and  failed  to  serve  their  purpose.  Moreover,  the  rights  and  responsibilities  of \nWUAs  were  not  properly  defined  and  most  of  them  lacked  legal  recognition.  Lack  of  farmer \nparticipation during planning and design phases led to the construction of facilities that often did \nnot  meet  local  technical  requirements  and  failed  to  ensure  construction  quality.  The  overall \nenvironment at the system level did not provide any incentives to farmers and WUAs in taking \n\n                                                 \n5    ADB. 1996.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic of  Indonesia for  Assessment  of  Options  for  Sustainable \n\nIrrigation Development. Manila.  (TA No. 2695-INO, for $1,200,000, approved on 5 November 1996)  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n3\n\ngreater responsibility for system O&M and fostered a mentality of dependence on government \nassistance.  \n\n10. \nThere  is  considerable  imprecision  with  regard  to  the  definition  of  O&M  and  a  lack  of \nappreciation  of  the  costs  involved.  O&M  budgets  were  prepared  by  provincial  governments \nbased on  a  \u201cservice  area\u201d  in  a  government  system  rather  than  on  needs  in  the  system.  This, \ncoupled with a low allocation per unit area, often led to a situation where O&M needs of many \nsystems were grossly  under  funded  resulting  in  their  rapid  deterioration,  and  traditionally the \nGovernment  addressed  these  issues  through  much  more  expensive  rehabilitation.  Improving \nthe  sustainability  of  irrigation  will  require  preparation  of  a  needs-based  budget  with  better \ndefinition  of  O&M  costs  to  include  all  operational  costs  for  staff,  equipment, and facilities, and \nroutine and periodic maintenance of irrigation systems.  \n\nIn  1995,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  Farmer-Managed  Irrigation \n11. \nSystems  Project  (FMISP)6  with  a  major  reorientation  of  government  assistance  to  irrigation \ndevelopment and management focusing on a participatory approach to irrigation management, \nincluding the objective of mobilizing farmer contribution of labor and materials toward the O&M \nand  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  (R&U) costs. This was a major departure from the  traditional \ntop-down decisions focusing on construction activities. In 1998, the Government initiated large-\nscale  pilot  testing  of  a  program  of  policy  and  institutional  reforms  in  irrigation  management \nunder the World Bank-assisted Java Irrigation Improvement and Water Resources Management \nProject  (JIIWMP)  covering  the  provinces  in  Java  Island.  The  initial  results  were  highly \nencouraging and formed the basis of a comprehensive water sector policy reform under a Water \nSector Adjustment Loan of the World Bank approved in 1999. \n\n2. \n\nRecent Developments \n\n12. \nNational Water Resources Policy. As envisaged under the World Bank Water Sector \nAdjustment Loan policy matrix, which was endorsed by ADB, a national water resources policy \n(NWRP) was prepared and formally adopted by the Government in December 2001. The NW RP \naims  for  integrated  water  resources  management  within  a  river  basin  to  ensure  sustainable, \neconomic, and multisector allocation and use of water. It provides a framework for coordination \nat  national  and  regional  levels  among  various  agencies  involved  in  water  resources \ndevelopment, management, and use. A bill on a new Water Law is presently being reviewed by \nParliament, and the law is expected to be enacted by December 2003.  \n\n13. \nIrrigation  Manageme nt  Policy  Reform.  As  part  of  the  overall  policy  initiatives  in  the \nwater  resources  sector,  the  Government  has  embarked  on  major  reforms  for  improving  the \nsustainability  of  irrigated  agriculture.  The  Government  issued,  in  April  1999,  a decree on  the \nirrigation  management  reform  program  (IMRP),  with  participatory  irrigation  development  and \nmanagement  as  the  core  of  the  agenda.  The  reform  principles  have  been  elaborated  in \nsubsequent  government  regulations  and  ministerial  decrees,  particularly  Government \nRegulation No. 77 on Irrigation issued in December 2001. The reform envisages WUAs to take \nthe primary responsibility for O&M and periodic rehabilitation while the Government will have a \nduty  to  assist;  government  assistance  will  be  conditional  on  local  efforts  for  O&M.  Irrigation \nsystems will be transferred to WUAs through an irrigation management agreement (IMA), which \nclarifies  the  rights,  authority,  and  responsibility  of  the  WUA  and  the  Government,  including \nprovision of continued government assistance for repair and improvements that are beyond the \ncapacity of the WUA. The system of irrigation service fees has been abolished, and WUAs have \nbeen authorized to levy and collect beneficiary contributions and use them for maintenance and \n\n                                                 \n6    ADB. 1995. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of  Indonesia  for  the  Farmer-Managed Irrigation  Systems  Project. Manila.  (Loan  No.  1378  \u2013INO, for \n$26.3 million) \n\n \n\n\f4                                                                                                                                                                                     \n\nrehabilitation.  ISF  was  a  central  government  tax  and  farmers  were  not  convinced  that  it  was \nused efficiently for O&M activities. \n\n14. \nThe IMRP redefines irrigation institutions, with the district as the focal point for planning \nand funding irrigation development and management. It provides for the establishment, in each \ndistrict,  of  (i) a  multi-stakeholder  irrigation  commission  (IC)\u2014comprising  government  officials \nconcerned  and  nongovernment  members  including  WUA  representatives,  academics,  and \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)\u2014with  authority  for  overall  management  of  irrigation \nactivities  in  the  district,  and  (ii) a  kabupaten  (district)  irrigation  improvement  fund  (KIIF)  with \ncentral and  district  government  contributions  to  assist  WUAs  in  sustainable  management  of \nirrigation systems. The Ministry of Finance  issued a ministerial decree on 30 June 2003 on the \nestablishment of KIIFs in districts and the mechanism of fund flow through KIIFs. Similarly, the \nMinistry  of  Home  Affairs  issued  a  ministerial  decree  on  30  June  2003  on  roles  of  sector \ninstitutions  at  provincial  and  district  levels.  Provincial  institutions  are  responsible  for  managing \nriver basins that cross district boundaries, and assist district governments (when so requested \nby  districts)  in  irrigation  and  water  resources  management.  The  national  institutions  will  be \nresponsible  for  setting  national  policies,  standards,  and  guidelines;  macro  planning; and other \naspects of sector management.  \n\n15. \nThe participatory concept that underpins the IMRP, including the objective of mobilizing \nfarmer  contributions  of  labor  and  materials  toward  O&M  and  rehabilitation  costs,  was \nsuccessfully implemented first in FMISP and subsequently in JIIWMP. Although the levels and \nmethods  of  farmer  contributions have been adjusted over time  for  various  reasons, including \nIndonesia\u2019s  economic  crisis,  FMISP  has  retained  the  principle  of  farmer  contributions  and  the \noverall experience has been  encouraging. JIIWMP was completed in 2000 and the institutional \nand policy reforms initiated under the project  have been supported since then in 12 provinces, \nincluding the four Java provinces, under the Netherlands-assisted Indonesia Water Resources \nand  Irrigation  Reform  Implementation  Project  (IWIRIP)  approved  in  2001.  Under  JIIWMP  and \nIWIRIP,  about  400  WUA  federations  (WUAFs)  have  been  established  in  about  235  schemes \ncovering about 315,000 ha, each WUAF nesting a series of WUAs at the secondary canal level. \nGovernance  and  management  of  61  schemes  covering  73,000  ha  have  been  transferred  to \nWUAFs. Initial assessment indicate that there were substantial quality and fiscal efficiency gains \nin O&M and R&U works carried out by WUAs themselves following the participatory approach.  \n\n \n\n3. \n\nOpportunities \n\nissues  confronting \n\n16. \nContinued Support for Policy Reforms. The ongoing administrative and fiscal reforms \n(under the Regional Autonomy and Fiscal Autonomy Acts of 22 and 25, respectively, of 1999) \nand the water sector reforms are mutually reinforcing, both in concept and timing, and provide \nan  excellent  opportunity  for  changing  the  approach  to  management  of  water  resources  in \ngeneral  and  irrigation  infrastructure  in  particular,  to  ensure  their  sustainability.  The  IMRP  and \nGovernment  Regulation  77  formalize  initiatives  in  recent  projects  for  overcoming  the \nsustainability \nirrigated  agriculture.  The  new  paradigms  will  require \nstrengthening  of  district-level  institutions  responsible  for  planning,  developing,  managing,  and \nregulating  irrigation  and  water  resources.  As  part  of  the  ongoing  decentralization  of  the \nGovernment,  about  two  thirds  of  the  25,000  staff  complement  of  the  Directorate  General  of \nWater Resources (DGWR) were devolved in 2002 to district and provincial governments. District \ngovernments  have  taken  initiatives  to  develop  effective  partnerships  with  WUA  for  sharing \nirrigation  management  responsibility.  WUAs  will  need  to  be  reactivated  or  strengthened  for \neffective  O&M  of  irrigation  schemes.  The  capacity-building  activities  will  need  to  be \ncomplemented by an investment program, using the KIIF, to catalyze technical, institutional, and \nmanagement improvements in existing irrigation systems.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n5\n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance Coordination  \n\n17. \nThe  external  funding  agencies  active  in  the  sector  have  been  working  with  the \nGovernment in a coordinated manner in developing and implementing the policy reforms in the \nwater  resources  sector,  including  irrigation.  The  proposed  Project  forms  part  of  joint initiatives \nby ADB, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Japan Bank for International \nCooperation,  Netherlands,  World  Bank,  and  other  agencies  to  provide  technical  and  financial \nassistance  to  support  implementation  of  the  sector  reforms.  On  that  basis,  the  focus  of the \nProject will be on capacity building and sustained operation of existing small and medium-scale \nschemes, and consolidation of gains in improving water resources management in recent ADB-\nassisted projects. The Netherlands Government has agreed in principle to cofinance the Project. \nThe World Bank approved, in June 2003, a Water Resources and Irrigation Sector Management \nProgram (WISMP), using its adjustable program loan modality. WISMP will be implemented in \n70 districts in 12 provinces, including the six  provinces of the proposed Project. In the common \nsix provinces, each project will cover a separate set of districts. A table on external assistance \nto the irrigation sector is given in Appendix 1.  \n\n \n\n5. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n18. \nADB  assistance  to  the  irrigation  sector  has  amounted  to  $1,526 million,  including \n$8.5 million in  TA, covering 36 projects. These  projects have aimed primarily at increasing rice \nproduction,  and  improving  income  and  living  conditions  of  farmers  through  the  provision  of \nirrigation  and  flood  control.  Nineteen  of  these  projects  have  been  post  evaluated.  Seven \nprojects  were  rated  as  generally  successful  and  10  as  partly  successful  in  achieving  their \nintended objectives, while  two  projects  were  considered  unsuccessful,  largely  because  of  low \neconomic viability. \n\n19. \nThe projects helped increase crop production, but their achievements in terms of service \narea  and  crop  yields  have  sometimes  been  below  expectation.  Shortfalls  were  due,  among \nother  things,  to  limited  availability  of  water  resources  to  meet  increasing  water  demand, \ninadequate  O&M  and  periodic  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  facilities,  lack  of  an  effective  cost \nrecovery system for funding O&M costs, and insufficient agricultural support services.  \n\n20. \nPost  evaluation  experience  highlighted  the  importance  of  formulating  and  designing \nirrigation  projects  in  the  context  of  a  broad  river  basin  development  scheme,  considering  the \naggregate supply and demand situation for water and associated economic costs and benefits. \nTo  enhance  the  sustainability  of  benefits, it was suggested that the Government should adopt \nreasonable  cost-sharing  arrangements  with  farmer  beneficiaries  to  promote  efficient  use  of \nwater  resources  and  to  generate  funds  to  cover  adequate  levels  of  O&M  and  periodic \nrehabilitation costs. The experience emphasized the need for local government and beneficiary \nparticipation, in the planning, design, implementation, and O&M of irrigation systems to enhance \nlocal  ownership.  Inadequate  beneficiary  participation  was  acknowledged  as  the  single  most \nimportant  factor  in  project  underperformance  compared  with  other  commonly  occurring \nimpediments,  including  poor  design,  implementation  delays,  cost  overruns,  price  fluctuations, \nand institutional deficiencies in implementing agencies.  \n\n21.  Most  earlier  irrigation  projects  aimed  to  provide  new, or  to  improve  existing, irrigation \ninfrastructure  for  large-scale, publicly managed irrigation systems. Experience has shown that \nthere  are  fewer  risks  associated  with  small  and  medium-scale  schemes,  and  ADB's  recent \nassistance  to  the  irrigation  sector  has  been  directed  to  smaller  systems,  including  farmer-\nmanaged or village irrigation schemes, with relatively low levels of technical complexity. \n\n22. \nSector  policy  reforms  being  undertaken  are  based  on  the  lessons  learned  in  the  past \nand  ongoing  projects  in  the  sector.  The  Project  will  support  implementation  of  the  policy \n\n \n\n\f6                                                                                                                                                                                     \n\nreforms,  and  its  design  has  incorporated careful attention to specific lessons learned from the \nADB-assisted projects. The Project incorporates (i) a high level of beneficiary participation, at all \nstages of preparation and implementation; (ii) direct involvement of local governments and other \nstakeholders in project preparation and implementation; (iii) a flexible implementation schedule \nbased on the capacity of  local government agencies to coordinate, manage, and implement the \nProject;  (iv) strengthening  of  agricultural  support  services;  (v) coverage  of  small  and  medium-\nscale  irrigation  schemes;  and  (vi) strengthening  of  water  resources  information  management, \ntaking into account the increasing demand for multisector uses. \n\n \n\n6. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Objectives and Strategies \n\n23. \nIndonesia\u2019s Country Strategy and Program (2003\u20132005) has the following development \nobjectives:  reducing  poverty,  improving  governance,  supporting  decentralization,  managing \nnatural resources and  the  environment, and strengthening the economy through infrastructure \ninvestments  and  private  sector  participation.  In  the  agriculture  and  rural  development  sector, \nADB\u2019s  strategy  for  Indonesia  is  to  reduce  poverty  by  increasing  farm  productivity  and \nempowering  the  rural  community.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  environment  and  natural  resources \nsector emphasizes promoting sustainable management of natural resources in a decentralized \nframework,  with  increased  stakeholder  participation  in  the  decision-making process. For water \nresources,  the  strategy  underscores  water  conservation,  efficiency  improvement  in  irrigation, \nand  a  holistic  approach  to  resource  management  within  a  river  basin.  The  Project  is  fully \nconsistent with the strategy for Indonesia. \n\nA. \n\nObjective and Scope  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT   \n\n24. \nThe  long-term  objectives  are  increased  economic  growth  and  reduced  poverty  in  25 \ndistricts  of  rural  Indonesia.  The  immediate  objectives  are  decentralized  management  of \nirrigation  systems  on  a  sustainable  basis  and  increased  yields  of  irrigated  crops.  The  project \nframework is given in Appendix 2. \n\n25. \nThe Project will cover  the  following  provinces:  (i) Lampung,  (ii) Banten,  (iii) West  Java, \n(iv) Central  Java,  (v) East  Java,  and  (vi) South Sulawesi. Nearly 75% of  Indonesia\u2019s irrigation \narea is in Java Island, and in Lampung and South Sulawesi provinces. ADB has approved 22 \nprojects for a total amount of $1.02 billion to support irrigation and water resources development \nin  these  provinces,  which  have  a  good  understanding  of  ADB\u2019s  project  implementation \nprocedures and systems. The provinces have started  implementing the  IMRP, and the Project \nwill assist in consolidating the gains and improving the sustainability of past investments.  \n\nThe  Project  will \n\nfollow  a  demand-driven  approach \n\n26. \nirrigation  management \nimprovement, accommodating districts\u2019 funding constraints and varying degrees of institutional, \ntechnical,  and  management  capabilities.  In  the  context  of  the  Project,  \u201csubproject\u201d  refers to a \ndistrict  with  all  water  resources  and  irrigation  infrastructure,  institutions, and stakeholders  in  it, \nand an irrigation scheme selected for project support is a \u201csubproject scheme\u201d. A list of potential \ndistricts in the six provinces is given in Appendix 3. \n\nto \n\nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n27. \nThe Project will comprise three components, i.e., Part A: Irrigation  Management; Part B: \nWater  Resources  Information  and  Asset  Management;  and  Part  C:  Project  Coordination and \nMonitoring. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n7\n\n1. \n\nPart A: Irrigation Management \n\n28. \nThe  component  will  comprise  (i) capacity  building  of  districts,  (ii) capacity  building  of \nWUAs,7  (iii) sustainable  operation  of  irrigation  infrastructure,  and  (iv) irrigated  agriculture \nsupport. \n\na. \n\nPart A-1: Capacity Building of Districts \n\n29. \nThe  Project  will  develop  institutional  capacity  of  about  25  district  governments  to \neffectively discharge the responsibility devolved to them in accordance with the IMRP, under the \ndecentralized framework of government. Specifically, the Project will assist district governments \nin  (i) formulating  policy  guidelines  and  regulations  in  conformity  with  the  relevant  national \npolicies  and  regulations,  (ii) strengthening  relevant  district  agencies  for  efficient  delivery  of \npublic  services  related  to  the  Project,  and  (iii) developing  and  implementing  district  irrigation \nmanagement plans (DIMPs).  \n\n30. \nPolicy  guidelines  and  district  irrigation  regulations  will  be  prepared  using  an  inclusive \nparticipatory process with extensive stakeholder consultations. They will address district-specific \nissues  and  concerns,  in  addition  to  meeting  the  national  policy  requirements.  The  district \nirrigation  regulations,  to  be  approved  by  the  district  legislature,  will  provide  the  basis  for \nestablishing a KIIF, which would then be used for subsequent project implementation.  \n\nEach district will establish an IC comprising government officials concerned with irrigated \n31. \nagriculture and non-government members including WUAs representatives. Initially, the district \nwill establish a district working group which, after the enactment of  district irrigation regulations, \nwill  be  converted  to  an  IC.  Among  the  initial  priorities  of  IC  will  be  the  review  of  existing \ninstitutional  arrangements  for  irrigation  management  and  the  identification  of  capacity  building \nneeds  across  the  sector.  The  organizational  structure  and  staffing  of  the  relevant  agencies, \nincluding  the  district  water  resources  services  and  the  district  agricultural  services,  will  be \nreviewed  and  rationalized,  and  staff  training  needs  will  be  assessed  and  staff  will  be  trained. \nStaff  training  will  focus  on  improving  the  professional,  technical,  and  managerial  efficiency of \nstaff,  and  making  government  agencies  more  service  oriented.  Activities  will  be  undertaken  in \ncoordination  with  the  Sustainable  Capacity  Building  for  Decentralization  Project,  approved  in \n2002.8 The Project will support  visits  of  selected  district  staff  and  WUA  members  to  irrigation \nschemes  within  the  country  and  region  where  the  participatory  approach  to  irrigation \nmanagement is being successfully implemented.  \n\n32. \nThe  information on the  status  of existing irrigation systems in  districts  will  be  updated \nand  a  DIMP  will  be  prepared.  The  plan  will  aim  at  improving  the  physical  and  financial \nsustainability  of  irrigation  systems  by  introducing  the  participatory  approach  to  management. \nThe plan will also  form the basis for  a sector investment program in the medium  to long term. \nThe  DIMP  will  include  a  program  for  strengthening  WUAs ;  transfer  of  schemes  to  WUAs \nthrough an  IMA; and funding requirements for  a  satisfactory level of O&M  as well as  periodic \nand emergency replacement and rehabilitation. The DIMP will be reviewed and updated every \nyear, particularly taking into account the experience gained in implementing Part A-3.  \n\nb. \n\nPart A-2: Capacity Building of Water Users Associations \n\n33. \nThe  subcomponent  will  focus  on  strengthening  WUAs  in  the  project  area  through \n(i) irrigation  reform  information  campaigns,  and  (ii) establishing  and/or  strengthening  about \n\n                                                 \n7    Henceforth, WUA is used as a generic term and includes WUAFs or the apex WUAF. \n8   ADB. 2002.

IMRP policies will be disseminated at the field level through media publicity and \nworkshops  for  farmers  engaged  in  irrigated  agriculture.  In  establishing  and  strengthening \nWUAs, emphasis will be given to taking advantage of existing traditional/customary institutions \nfor irrigation management that are now recognized by the Government Regulation on Irrigation. \nMultiple  WUAs  in  a  large  scheme  will  be  assisted  to  federate  into  a  WUAF  and/or  an  apex \nWUAF. WUAs will also be assisted in obtaining legal status through registration with  the district \nauthority.  As  part  of  this  process,  legal  literacy  will  also  be  provided  to  help  individual  water \nusers  and  their  associations  better  understand  their  rights  and  responsibilities  under  the  new \npolicies.  Legal  assistance  will  also  be  provided  in  formulating  management  agreement  and  in \nutilizing their legal status to contract with third parties in connection with irrigation management \nand  in  improving  irrigated  agriculture.  Institutional  strengthening  support  to  WUA  will  be \nprovided  initially  for  1  year  and  thereafter  for  2  more  years  during  implementation  of  the \nirrigation management plan (IMP) for the scheme.  \n\nc. \n\nPart A-3: Sustainable Operation of Irrigation Infrastructure \n\n34. \nAfter  initial  strengthening,  the  WUA  will  be  assisted  in  the  following:  (i) undertaking a \nparticipatory  rural  appraisal  to  assess  scheme  performance  and  identify  requirements  for \nimproving O&M; (ii) formulating an IMP covering a 5-year period; (iii) preparing a needs-based \nbudget for priority activities for (a)  an  adequate  level  of  O&M  and  (b)  periodic  rehabilitation  of \nselected items as sustainable replacement of rehabilitation (SRR); and (iv) preparing a budget \nfor scheme R&U, if required, to address the effects of past deferred maintenance. SRR is low-\nlevel periodic replacement/rehabilitation designed to ensure that the deferred maintenance cycle \nis broken and that irrigation systems performance is maintained at or close to the original design \nlevel. WUAs will be eligible for SRR assistance only after they have demonstrated an improved \nlevel of routine O&M. About 137,000 ha will be rehabilitated and upgraded. Routine O&M costs \nwill normally be wholly financed by WUA; otherwise, the IMP will include an action plan showing \nhow the WUA will provide full funding of routine O&M within an agreed time frame, normally 3 \nyears, by gradually increasing irrigation service charges.  \n\n35. \nThe IMP will be reviewed by the district agencies for technical, financial, and economic \nviability and compliance with the Project\u2019s environment management plan (EMP); resettlement \ncompensation  policy  framework  and  procedural  guidelines  (CPFPG);  gender  action  plan; and \nindigenous people\u2019s participatory planning framework. The IMP will be approved and prioritized \nby the IC, and harmonized with the DIMP and district priorities. The actual criteria for delineating \nthe eligibility of government assistance for O&M, SRR, and R&U will be worked out by individual \ndistricts,  in  consultation  with  national  and  provincial  agencies  concerned,  according  to  the \nspecific  condition  of  the  districts.  Normally  all  activities  involving  unskilled  labor,  e.g.,  canal \ndesilting,  cutting  weeds,  earthworks  to  restore  canal  shape,  will  be  fully  managed  by  WUA, \nwhile  repairs  that  require  substantial  cash  expenses  or  specialized  engineering  expertise  or \nequipment not available locally, will be eligible for government support.  \n\n 36. \nFollowing  the  approval  of  the  IMP,  an  IMA  will  be  negotiated  between  the  district \ngovernment  and  by  the  WUA.  The  IMA  will  incorporate  the  approved  IMP  and  define  the \nresponsibilities  of  the  WUA  in  managing  the  scheme,  as  well  as  the  technical  and  financial \nsupport  and  services  to  be  provided  by  the  district  government.  An  agreed  mechanism  for \nconflict  resolution  will  be  included.  In  case  of  relatively  large  schemes,  O&M  responsibility  for \nheadworks and main canals may be retained by the district water resources services (DWRS), \nWUAs  being  responsible  only  for  downstream  facilities.  Such  sharing  of  responsibility  will  be \noutlined in the respective IMAs.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n9\n\nd. \n\nPart A-4: Irrigated Agriculture support \n\n37. \nThe subcomponent will provide support for dissemination of new technologies that were \ntested  and  recommended  for  field  use  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  under various programs \nincluding  the  ADB-assisted  Participatory  Development  of  Agricultural  Technology  Project.9 \nSupport  will  also  be  provided  for  improving  farmer  access  to  agricultural  inputs  and  services, \nand  this  will  be  achieved  through  strengthening  technical,  organizational,  managerial,  and \nbargaining capacity of WUAs for better deals with inputs and service providers and making the \nproviders  responsive  and  accountable  to  clients.  Performance  of  similar  programs  within  the \nproject area and elsewhere in the country will be assessed and findings taken into consideration \nin  designing  a  pilot  study  that  will  be  tested  in  five  districts.  After  validating  the  design,  the \nactivity will be extended in a phased approach to other districts.  \n\n2. \n\nPart B: Water Resources Information and Asset Management  \n\n38. \nThis  component  will  improve  and  expand  the  operation  of  the  water  resources \ninformation management system and facilities established in DGWR to provide access to quality \ndata and information for multisector use. The institutional arrangements for managing the Water \nResources Data Center at DGWR Central Office will be strengthened, and the Water Resources \nData Center will be integrated into the regular organizational structure of DGWR. Additional staff \nwill  be  recruited  and  trained  for  data  processing  and  providing  value-added services to users. \nData  requirements  and  information  systems  necessary  for  efficient  water  resources  planning \nand management, and effective asset management at district level, will be assessed; hardware, \ntogether  with  appropriate  generic  software  models, will  also  be  provided.  The  design  of  the \ndistrict  water  resources  information  management  system   and  its  implementation  will  be  in  line \nwith the decision support system and the database concept and architectural design developed \nunder  JIIWMP.  District  staff  will  be  trained  and  provided  with  facilities  for  studying  and \ndeveloping irrigation and water resources asset management modules. \n\n3. \n\nPart C: Project Coordination and Monitoring \n\n39. \nThe  Project  will  support  (i) operation  of  a  national  steering  committee  (NSC); \n(ii) establishment and operation of a national project coordination and monitoring office (PCMO); \n(iii) financial  accounting  and  monitoring  of  the  Project;  and  (iv) development  of  a  project \nperformance management system (PPMS) at national, provincial, and district levels. \n\n40. \nThe  Government  established,  in  2002,  an  NSC  for  guiding  all  water  resources  and \nirrigation development programs in the country. The Project will support the establishment and \noperation  of  the  national  PCMO  as  the  NSC  secretariat  for  the  Project  and  for  overall \ncoordination and monitoring of project activities. A domestic accounting firm (consultant) will be \nengaged to ensure that project financial accounting reports and financial monitoring reports are \nprepared \nproject \nimplementation/management office at district, provincial, and national levels. The consultant will \nalso \nfinancial \nmanagement. \n\ntrain  government  staff \n\nin  accounting  and \n\ntheir  capacity \n\nin  developing \n\naccurately \n\nquarterly \n\nintervals \n\nregular \n\neach \n\nand \n\nby \n\nat \n\nThe PPMS will encompass (i) monitoring physical and financial progress as well as the \n41. \neconomy  and  efficiency  in  achieving  major  activities;  (ii) monitoring  the level and adequacy of \nparticipation of various stakeholders in planning and implementing project activities, particularly \ndistrict  capacity  building  and  improving  the  performance  of  irrigation  schemes;  (iii) monitoring \n\n                                                 \n9    ADB. 1997. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of  Indonesia for the  Participatory  Development  of  Agricultural  Technology  Project.  Manila.  (Loan No. \n1526-INO, approved in 1997 for $63.8 million) \n\n \n\n\f10                                                                                                                                                                                     \n\nthe  Project\u2019s  social,  environmental,  and  economic  impacts ,  including  the  establishment  of \nbenchmark  information  and  data;  and  (iv) developing  a  mechanism  for  making  necessary \nadjustments  in  the  project  design  and  implementation  arrangements  in  light  of  the  PPMS \nfindings. The design of the PPMS will take into account the monitoring and evaluation systems \ndeveloped  under  TA  1363-INO:  Strengthening  Project  Benefit  Monitoring  and  Evaluation \nActivities of the Directorate General of Water Resources Development. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nPoverty Targeting. The project design includes a combination of measures to maximize \n42. \npoverty  impact.  The  rural  poverty  incidence  in  the  six  provinces  that  will  receive  support  for \nirrigation  management  improvement  ranges  between  20%  and  29%,  with  a  six-province \naverage  of  26%.  Within  the  rural  population,  the  incidence  of  poverty  is  much  higher  in  the \nagriculture  sector  than  in  other  sectors,  and  was  estimated  at  40%  in  1999.  The  subproject \nselection  criteria  give  priority  to  districts  that  have  a  relatively  high  incidence  of  poverty. \nSimilarly, poverty data and the potential benefits for the poor will be duly considered in selecting \nindividual  irrigation  schemes.  A  variety  of  measures  targeting  poor  and  disadvantaged \nindividuals  or  groups  will  be  used,  including:  (i) guidelines for WUA strengthening  (which  will \nrequire special attention to inform and include tenant farmers in the collective decision-making \nprocess);  (ii) use  of  local  labor  and  materials  in  implementing  scheme  improvement;  and \n(iii) equity  in  water  allocation  and  management,  particularly  in  terms  of  meeting  the \nrequirements of tail-enders in the service area. \n\n43. \nGender and Development. Despite their extensive involvement in irrigated agriculture, \nwomen have not been well represented in irrigation management, nor in training, meetings, and \nother activities carried out under earlier programs. While recognizing the need to respect local \nvalues and beliefs and while respecting the choices of both men and women about taking part in \nspecific activities, the Project will pursue suitable opportunities to promote greater involvement \nof women in the decision-making process of irrigation management. The project design provides \nfor specific measures to achieve this, as outlined in Table 2 of  the Summary Poverty Reduction \nand  Social  Strategy  and  Gender  Plan  in  Appendix  4.  Poverty  and  social  issues  are  further \ndiscussed in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n\nEnvironment.  All  three  components  of  the  Project  aim  at,  among  other  things, \n44. \nsustainable  water  resources  management  and  environmental  protection.  The  only  activities \nlikely  to  have  some  negative  impact  relate  to  subcomponent  A-3:  Sustainable  Operation  of \nIrrigation Infrastructure. An initial environmental examination  of the five schemes studied during \nproject  preparation  was  undertaken  and  findings  are  summarized  in  Appendix  5.  The  findings \nindicate that improved O&M will lead to improved irrigation and environmental management in \nall  schemes.  However,  construction  activities  in  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  some  selected \nscheme,  if  not  undertaken  properly,  may  have  a  short-term  negative  environmental  impact. \nDistrict-level staff and WUA members will be trained  in environmental screening of the irrigation \nschemes  proposed  for  project  support.  A  project  environmental  management  plan  (EMP) for \nenvironmental  mitigation, complying with  government regulations,  has  been  prepared  to  guide \nthe WUAs and district authorities and is included in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\nResettlement  and  Land  Acquisition.  Since  the  Project  focuses  on  improving  the \n45. \nmanagement  of  existing  systems,  resettlement  and  land  acquisition  are  not  expected  to  be \nsignificant. None of the core subproject schemes would require any significant land acquisition \nor  resettlement.  Nonetheless, a  CPFPG  has  been  prepared  (Supplementary  Appendix  C)  and \nwill guide all land acquisition and resettlement activities. A summary of  the CPFPG is given in \nAppendix 6 on Land Acquisition, Resettlement, and Indigenous Peoples.  \n\n\f \n\n \n11\n\n46. \nIndigenous  People.  The  communities  likely  to  be  affected  by  the  Project  are  already \nengaged in cultivating irrigated rice. They include groups speaking various local languages and \nwith distinct ethnic identities. In terms of livelihood systems, education, and representation in the \nlocal  bureaucracy,  there  is  little  significant  risk  of  any  group  of  people  being  disadvantaged \nbecause  of  their  status  as  an  ethnic  minority  or  indigenous  people.  Available  information \nsuggests that the Project would not affect groups with special vulnerabilities that would require \npreparation  of  a  separate  indigenous  people\u2019s  development  plan.  If  such  groups  are  identified \nwho may be significantly affected by project implementation, then such plans will be prepared in \naccordance with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples, and implementation of project activities \nat  such  sites  would  be  conditional  on  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  the  relevant  plans.  An  indigenous \npeople\u2019s participatory planning framework is given in Appendix 6. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n47. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  (including  taxes,  price  contingencies,  and  interest  during \nconstruction) is estimated at $126.0 million equivalent (Table 1), of which $30.6 million (25%) is \nthe direct and indirect foreign exchange cost, including about $6.0 million for interest and other \ncharges during construction. The balance of $95.4 million equivalent (75%) is the local currency \ncost.  A  summary  of  cost  estimates  is  given  in  Appendix  7  and  details  are  available  in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nItem \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nIrrigation Management  \n1.

The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an  interest  charge  of  1%  per  year  during  the  grace \nperiod and 1.5% per year during the remaining term. \n\n49. \nIn addition, the Government has requested a loan of $54.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital  resources  to  finance  $20.5 million  of  the  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $33.5 million \nequivalent  of  the  local  currency  costs.  The  loan  will  have  a  22-year  term  including  a  grace \nperiod of 7 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  a  front-end  fee  of  0.5%  (the  fee  will  be \ncapitalized  in  the  loan),  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \n\n \n\n \n\nA. \n\n \n\n\f12                                                                                                                                                                                     \n\nAgreement.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. \n\nThe  Government  of  Indonesia  has  requested  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands  to \n50. \nprovide grant financing for the Project, and the latter has agreed in principle to provide a grant of \n$15.0 million  equivalent.  The  grant,  to  be  administered  by  ADB,  will  cover  $4.4 million of  the \nforeign exchange costs and $10.6 million equivalent of the local currency costs. \n\n51. \nADB and the Netherlands Government will finance  60% of the local cost of the Project. \nThis is  principally  because  of  the  nature  of  the  works  envisaged  under  the  Project,  which  are \nmainly  capacity  building  of  local  governments  and  WUAs ,  and  small-scale  repair  and \nrehabilitation  of  existing  irrigation  schemes.  The  Project  is  classified  as  a  poverty intervention \nproject and will contribute significantly on combating poverty and improving living conditions of \npeople in the Project area. Therefore, the ADB\u2019s and the Netherlands\u2019 financing a large part of \nthe  local  cost  is  justified  on  project  considerations.  The  Government  (including  local \ngovernments)  and  WUAs  will  finance  the  remaining  local  currency  cost  equivalent  to  about \n$38.0 million.  The  Government  will  cover  all  taxes  and  duties,  recurrent  expenditures  during \nimplementation,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  environmental  mitigation  measures, \nestimated  to  cost  $25.5 million.  The  estimated  WUA  contribution  will  total  about  $12.5 million \nequivalent and form part of the incremental O&M, SRR, and R&U costs.

The project implementing agencies (IAs) are as follows:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPart A-1: Capacity Building of Districts\u2014district governments;  \n\nPart A-2: Capacity Building of Water User Associations\u2014district governments; \n\nPart A-3: Sustainable Operation of Irrigation Infrastructure\u2014provincial and district \ngovernments; \n\n(iv) \n\nPart A-4: Irrigated Agriculture Support\u2014district governments; \n\n\f \n\n \n13\n\n \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nPart  B:  Water  Resources  Information  and  Asset  Management\u2014DGWR,  and \nprovincial and district governments; and \n\nPart  C:  Project  Monitoring  and  Coordination\u2014National  Planning  and \nDevelopment  Agency  (BAPPENAS),  in  cooperation  with  BANGDA,  DGAF,  and \nDGWR. \n\n53. \nEach  EA  will  establish  a  national  project  management  unit  (national  PMU)  in  Jakarta, \ncomprising a project director and  an  adequate  number  of  qualified  technical,  accounting, and \nfinancial staff. The national PMU under DGWR will  be responsible for: (i) recruiting consultants \nfor  improving  O&M  efficiency  undertaking  SRR  and  R&U  activities,  and  water  resources \ninformation management system; (ii) overseeing the implementation of civil works, O&M-related \nactivities,  and  water  resources  data  gathering  for  management  information  system;  and  (iii) \noverseeing  procurements  by  WUAs.  The  national  PMU  under  BANGDA  will:  (i)  oversee  and \nfacilitate capacity building  of districts and WUAs, issuance of district irrigation regulations, and \nthe  strengthening  of  the  legal  status  of  WUAs ;  and  (ii)  recruit  and  supervise  institutional \ndevelopment  and  capacity  building  consultants.  The  national  PMU  under  DGAF  will  be \nresponsible  for:  (i)  recruiting  consultants  for  agricultural  support  services;  (ii)  overseeing \nagricultural  extension  training  and  development  of  cooperatives;  and  (iii)  assisting  WUA \nmembers in adopting irrigated agriculture technologies, formation of cooperatives, and providing \naccess to ongoing rural financial services. \n\n54. \nEach participating province will establish a provincial PCMO at  Provincial Planning and \nDevelopment Agency (Provincial BAPPEDA) level, comprising provincial staff of relevant sector \nagencies and members of civil society. The provincial PCMO will assist provincial government \nand  technical  agencies  to  (i) identify  additional  subproject  districts  for  project  participation; \n(ii) help NSC in monitoring and coordinating project activities and coordinate with other similar \nprojects and programs being implemented in the province; (iii) facilitate backstopping to districts \non engineering and agricultural aspects; (iv) maintain provincial directories of service providers \nfor use by participating districts and WUAs; (vi) facilitate collection and dissemination of district-\nlevel  implementation  experiences  through  workshops,  discussions,  and  newsletters;  and \n(vii) formulate an annual work plan (AWP) for the province.  AWP will document the activities to \nbe  undertaken  during  the  year  including  their  commencement  and  completion  dates,  status  of \npreparation,  expected  outputs,  and  budget  requirements.  The  provincial  water  resources \nservices and agricultural services will be designated the provincial project implementation units. \n\n55. \nEach of the participating provinces will establish 2 provincial project implementation units \n(Provincial PIUs) at the provincial water resources services and provincial agricultural services \n(PWRS  and  PAS).  The  PWRS  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  developing  water  resources \ninformation and asset management system at provincial level, and implementing works relating \nto irrigation infrastructure and O&M efficiency improvements when a subproject scheme covers \nmore  than  one  district.  The  PAS  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  overseeing  the  institutional \ndevelopment and agricultural support services at district and WUA levels. \n\n56. \nProvincial PCMOs will be replicated at district level by district PCMOs, chaired by district \nBAPPEDAs.  District  AWPs  will  be  reviewed  and  endorsed  by  ICs.  District  water  resources \nservices  and  agricultural  services  will  serve  as  district  project  implementation  units  and  will \nsupervise  project  implementation  on  a  day-to-day  basis.    Similarly,  each  district  will  also \nestablish two PIUs at the district water resources services and district agricultural services. \n\nAt  the  national  level,  the  Project  will  be  guided  by  the  NSC,  chaired  by  the  Deputy \n57. \nChairman for Infrastructure, BAPPENAS.  The EAs and other relevant national  agencies will be \nrepresented  on  the  NSC  at  the  director  general  level.  The  NSC  will  provide  policy  guidelines, \napprove  subproject  district  selection  and  AWP  for  the  Project,  and  oversee  project \n\n \n\n\f14                                                                                                                                                                                     \n\nimplementation. The NSC will meet as necessary, and at least twice a year. A  national PCMO \nwill serve as the secretariat for the NSC. National PCMO officials will include the Director (Water \nand  Irrigation)  of  BAPPENAS  (chairperson) and representatives of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture, \nMinistry of Home Affairs, and Ministry of Settlement and Regional Infrastructure, and they will be \nsupported by technical and accounts staff. The national PCMO will be responsible for the overall \nplanning of project activities; reviewing and consolidating the AWPs and corresponding budget \nestimates received from project EAs and IAs ; financial management, monitoring, and evaluation \nof  project  implementation;  coordinating  recruitment  of  consultants;  procurement of equipment \nand  materials  by  EAs  and  IAs ;  development  and  operation  of  the  PPMS;  and  preparing  and \nsubmitting reports to the Government and ADB. \n\n58. \n\nA project organization chart is given in Appendix 8. \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Selection \n\n59. \nFive core subproject districts in five project provinces were selected and studied during \nthe project preparatory technical assistance  phase. In each core subproject district, an irrigation \nscheme was selected and technical, institutional, social, environmental, and economic aspects \nwere  studied  in  detail.  Additional  subproject  districts  will  be  selected  for  participation  in  the \nProject in accordance with a selection process. The selection will be made by NSC, based on a \ndistrict application through the Provincial PCMO showing commitment to comply with the policy, \ninstitutional,  and  financial  requirements  of  the  Project.  Higher  priority  will  be  given  to  those \ndistricts that  (i) have high  a  incidence  of  poverty  and  a  high  number  of  established  and  active \nWUAs,  (ii) have  started  implementing  the  policies  set  out  under  the  decentralization  laws, \n(iii) commenced  reviews  and  capacity  building  of  district \ninstitutions,  and  (iv) started \nparticipatory  programs  with  WUAs  to  maintain  irrigation  infrastructure.  Subproject  district \nselection criteria are summarized in Appendix 9.  \n\nThe Project will be implemented over a period of  7 years, commencing in early 2004. A \n\n60. \nsummary project implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 10.  \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n61. \nGoods  and  services  financed  wholly  or  partly  by  ADB  lending  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  the  ADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  for  SRR  and  R&U  will  be \neligible for loan financing.  WUAs will share part of  the civil works costs in SRR and R&U in the \nform  of  cash,  labor,  or  local  materials,  and  such  civil  works  packages  will  be  carried  out \nfollowing PAI 3.05 in  Appendix 2  to A Guide on Community Participation in Procurement. The \ncontract  ceiling  during  the  first  year  will  be  $10,000  equivalent,  which  may  be  increased  in \nsubsequent  years  to  $25,000  equivalent,  with  prior  ADB  permission,  upon  satisfactory \ncompletion  of  the  previous  contract  by  the  WUA.  In  the  event  that  a  package  exceeds  the \nceiling,  DWRS  will  award  the  contract  through  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB).  Civil  works in \nthat  part  of  the  irrigation  scheme  (mostly  headworks  and  main  canals  of  relatively  large \nschemes), which have  not  been  transferred  to  WUAs ,  may  be  carried  out  by  DWRS  through \nLCB. LCB contracts costing the equivalent of $100,000 or less will be awarded in accordance \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  standard  procedure  for  such  works  as  set  forth  in  Presidential  Decree \nNo.  18/2000  with  necessary  clarifications  and  modifications  for  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  A  standard  LCB  document  for  civil  works  will  be  prepared  by \nDGWR and approved by ADB for use in the Project. The contracts will provide for engagement \nof labor and use of local materials to be provided by the WUAs. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n15\n\n62. \nEquipment  to  be  procured  under  the  Project  consists  primarily  of  that  required  for \ncommunications equipment, training materials, vehicles, and office equipment and furniture. All \ncontract packages are expected to be below $500,000 each. Any contract of $500,000 or above \nwill  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding.  Each  contract  with  an \nestimated  cost  of  between  $100,000  and  $500,000  will  be  awarded  through  international \nshopping. Minor equipment and materials costing less than $100,000 will be procured through \ndirect  purchase.  A  tentative  list  of  packages  of  goods  and  services,  excluding  consulting \nservices, is given in Appendix 11. \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n63. \nThe Project will require an estimated 1,653 person-months (pm) of consulting services: \n213  international  and  1,440  domestic.  This  relatively  large  input  stems  from  the  need  for \ncapacity  building  and  the  expert  assistance  required  to  support  the  highly  decentralized \nimplementation arrangements, and the need for intensive interaction with water users and field-\nlevel  staff  in  widely  dispersed,  small  and  medium-scale  irrigation  schemes,  and  the  large \nelement  of  training  and  transfer  of  knowledge  in  the  Project.  These  requirements also include \nthe services of a domestic ac counting firm for financial accounting of the Project and preparing \nquarterly financial monitoring reports for the Project. Consultants will be selected and engaged \nthrough  firms  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  In  selecting \nconsultants, the quality and cost-based selection method will be used. An outline of the terms of \nreference of consulting services is given in Appendix 12. ADB has approved the Government\u2019s \nrequest  for  advance  action  for  the  recruitment  of  consultants,  and  the  Government  has  been \nadvised that such approval does not commit ADB to approve the Project.  \n\n64. \nThe  Project  will  also  engage  NGOs  and  local  educational  institutions  for  WUA \nstrengthening  and  assist  them  in  IMP  preparation  and  implementation.  The  NGOs  and \ninstitutions  will  be  engaged  by  WUAs  from  a  list  of  service  providers  selected  by  the  province \nconcerned,  based  on  experience  and  qualifications  of  the  NGOs.  District-level  training  will  be \ncontracted out to educational and research institutions and other qualified service providers, as \nthe need arises, in accordance with competitive selection procedures acceptable to ADB. \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n65. \nThe  allocation  of  funds  for  project  activities  will  be  made  annually  on  the  basis  of \nconsolidated  AWPs  approved  by  NSC  and  ADB.  Loan  and  grant  proceeds  and  counterpart \nfunds will be channeled through  the DIP (development budget allocation to central government \nbudget) and DIPP (development budget allocation to province/district government budget). Fund \nflow arrangements are given in Appendix 13.  \n\n66. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance\u2019s  Directorate  General  of  Budget  will  establish  two  imprest \naccounts,  one  for  ADF  loan  and  the  other  for  OCR  loan,  for  each  EA  at  Bank  Indonesia  to \nexpedite  disbursement  of  loan  proceeds,  particularly  for  expenditures  under  small  contracts. \nThe  imprest  accounts  will  be  maintained  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook.  The  initial  deposits  will  be  based  on  expected  disbursement  for  the \nfirst 6 months of implementation, and will not exceed $3 million in aggregate. The statement of \nexpenditure  (SOE)  procedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  for  civil \nworks,  capacity  building,  training,  small  procurements,  and  NGO  services,  and  to  liquidate \nadvances  provided  in  the  imprest  accounts  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook and other arrangements agreed with the Government. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16                                                                                                                                                                                     \n\n7. \n\nAccounting and Auditing \n\n67. \nEach  EA  and  IA  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  goods  and  services \nfinanced out of loan proceeds and  disclose the use thereof. WUAs will maintain accounts in a \nformat to be specified in IMAs, and their books and records will be open to public access, and \nmay be audited at random by independent auditors to be engaged under the Project. Summary \ninformation  on  scheme-level expenditures will be  posted on office boards for public view. The \nnational  PCMO  will  prepare  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  Project,  and  have  them \naudited annually in accordance with sound auditing principles by the sovereign audit agency of \nthe Government or other  auditors acceptable to ADB.  The auditor\u2019s report will also include  the \nauditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  use  of  imprest  account  and  SOE  procedures.  Copies  of  audited \naccounts  and  auditor\u2019s  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  9  months  of  the  end  of  each \nfiscal year.  \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n68. \nThe  national  PCMO  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  project  performance  monitoring \nand evaluation. A  PPMS  will  be  designed  and  put  into  operation  under  Part  C  of  the  Project \n(para.  41).  The  PPMS  findings  will  be  incorporated  in  quarterly  project  progress  reports  to  be \nprepared by the  national  PCMO.  Quarterly  project  progress  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB, \nthe  Netherlands  embassy  in  Jakarta,  NSC,  and  the  project  EAs  and  IAs  within  45  days  of  the \nend  of  the  reporting  period.  The  national  PCMO  will  also  prepare  and  submit  a  consolidated \nproject  completion  report  to  ADB  and  the  Netherlands  embassy  within  6  months  of  project \ncompletion. \n\n69. \nIn  addition  to  regular  reviews,  a  midterm  review  will  be  undertaken  by  ADB  jointly  with \nthe governments of Indonesia and the Netherlands in 2007 to assess the implementation status, \nreview the project parameters, and take appropriate measures to achieve the project objectives.  \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n70. \nA major thrust of the Project is the capacity building of district governments and WUAs \nwith regard to  sustainable  management  of  irrigation  and  water  resources.  A significant part of \nthe project costs relates to these activities. The economic benefits accruing from the investment \nin capacity building cannot be quantified, but the benefits would be realized through enhanced \ntechnical skills and significant efficiency gains in planning and management of irrigation, both at \ngovernment  and  users\u2019  levels.  These  gains  would  result  in  increased  efficiency  in  delivering \nirrigation  and  reduced  O&M  and  rehabilitation  costs.  The  cost-effectiveness  of  the  proposed \ninvestment  in  capacity  building  would  be  ensured  through  a  competitive  process  drawing  on \nboth government and private sector service providers. \n\nGiven  the  sector  approach  and  the  participatory  emphasis,  decisions  on  the  types  of \n71. \nschemes that would be assisted for O&M, SRR, and R&U would be made at the decentralized \nlevel  with  possible  differential  outcomes  on  the  overall  economic  performance  of  the  Project. \nThe  selection  criteria  would  require  assessment  of  the  anticipated  economic  returns  at  the \nscheme  approval  stage  to  ensure  individual  scheme  viability.  To  provide  indicative  economic \noutcomes  from  the  project  activities,  four  core  schemes  were  studied  and  analyzed  in  detail \nduring the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  The  core  schemes  represented  diverse \nprospective schemes (small and medium-sized, and secondary canals of large schemes, and a \ncombined  use  of  surface  and  groundwater  with  different \ninstitutional \ncharacteristics  and  future  potential)  and  different  typology  of  interventions.  The  anticipated \neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs) for the core schemes ranged from 19% to 60% and \n\ntechnical  and \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n17\n\nwere not sensitive to  cost overruns, incremental benefit shortfall, or appreciation in the value of \nthe local currency against the dollar (Appendix 14, para. 13). \n\nB. \n\nFinancial, Social, and Poverty Reduction Benefits \n\nSustaining and improving performance of the irrigation systems would help enhance  the \n72. \nlivelihoods of rural people, including tenants, owner-cultivators, agricultural laborers, as well as \nlandowners,  through  higher  and  more  stable  incomes.  On  the  core  schemes,  anticipated  per \nhectare  incremental  incomes  are  in  the  range  of  Rp1.2 million\u20132.8 million,  or  26\u2013162%  of \nwithout-project  levels.  Increases  are  anticipated  to  be  highest  in  the  tail  end  reaches  where \npresent irrigation supplies are  lowest in volume and reliability and, as a consequence, cropping \nintensities  and  crop  yields  are  lowest  and  incidence  of income poverty  highest (Appendix 14, \nTables A14.1 and A14.5). Distributional analysis of the core schemes indicates that as much as \n42%  of  the  overall  net  economic  gains  would  accrue  to  the  tail  reaches,  accounting for  about \n33% of the total service area, which would help reduce income disparities (Appendix 14, Table \nA14.7). The poverty impact analysis of the core schemes indicates that 32% of the net economic \nbenefits would accrue to the poor. With 40% of the population employed in the agriculture sector \nliving  below  the  poverty  line,  the  Project  will  have  a  major  impact  on  combating  poverty  and \nimproving income distribution in the project area. \n\n73. \nEmpowering rural people in irrigation system management decision making would help \nbuild  social  capital  within  the  irrigation  management  institutions.  Inclusive  approaches  to \nparticipation in irrigation management would strengthen access to resources and give voice in \ndecision making to disadvantaged members of the community, including the poor and women, \nthereby addressing an important dimension of poverty and governance. The access to irrigation \nwater of poor farmers within  the  irrigation service area will be safeguarded and participation of \nwomen in irrigation management will be promoted (Appendix 4, Table 2).   \n\nC. \n\nPolicy Impact and Institutional Benefits \n\nThe  IMRP  and  NWRP  make  a  paradigm  shift  in  the  Government\u2019s  policy  on  irrigation \n74. \nand  water  resources  management,  and  the  Project  will  provide  important  support  for \nimplementing the new policy initiatives. It  will help build capacity within and outside  government \ninstitutions  for  a  participatory  approach  to  resource  management  and  enhance  transparency \nand accountability in management decisions. The policy action transferring the management of \ngovernment  schemes  (covering  250,000  ha)  to  WUAs  and  to  the  district  government  that \nassum es  the  emergency  and  periodic  rehabilitation  responsibility  on  a  cost-sharing  basis  will \nimprove the physical and financial sustainability of irrigation infrastructure. \n\n75. \nThe Project will further some of these policy changes through innovation and addition of \nnew elements. It will introduce a fundamental change in the planning of irrigation development \nat  regional  level  through  the  DIMP  approach.  DIMP  will  assist  the  districts  in  addressing  the \nirrigation  management  issues  in  a  systematic  manner,  taking  into  account  the  problems  and \npotential in the district as a whole,  rather than planning to address issues in individual schemes \nin isolation, and with greater efficiency in allocation of resources.  \n\nThe Project  will  rationalize  and  strengthen  the  institutional  arrangements  for  irrigation \n76. \nmanagement  at  district  level  and  strengthen  the  technical  and  managerial  skills  of  staff  and \nmake them more responsive to stakeholder needs in the sector. WUAs \u2019 option to source certain \nservices  from  the  private  sector  will  encourage  government  agencies  to  be  more  service \noriented. Strengthening of WUAs will improve governance and management at scheme level.  \n\n77. \nThe Water Resources Data Center in Jakarta will be integrated into the DGWR regular \norganization structure, and technical and professional capability will be strengthened to provide \n\n \n\n\f18                                                                                                                                                                                     \n\nvalue-added services to its users within and outside DGWR. Tools and techniques provided will \nenhance district-level quality assurance and asset management in the water resources sector. \n\nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\nThe  project  interventions  will  improve  the  efficiency  of  resource  use,  and  generate  a \n78. \npositive  environmental  impact.  Any  short-term  negative  impacts  that  might  occur  during \nrehabilitation of some irrigation and drainage structures will be mitigated in accordance with the \nenvironmental management plan (Supplementary Appendix B). \n\nE. \n\nSustainability \n\n79. \nThe participatory principle underpinning the Project\u2019s design will help develop a sense of \nownership  among  various  stakeholders  and  this,  in  turn,  will  enhance  the  Project\u2019s \nsustainability.  The  introduction  of  SRR  will  break  the  deferred  maintenance  cycle,  while  the \nresulting reduction in  the need for major rehabilitation will make available resources to expand \nSRR and to undertake emergency rehabilitation works through  the demand-driven, cost-sharing \nmechanism  of  KIIF.  Similarly,  the  irrigation  management  transfer  to  WUAs  will  relieve  the \nGovernment of significant financial costs in subsidizing routine O&M, and government financial \nassistance will then be more effectively used for sustaining and further expanding the reforms. \n\n80. \nThe subproject scheme analysis indicates that in financial terms farmers could afford to \npay the incremental O&M costs estimated at Rp85,000 per hectare, which on the core schemes \nrepresents 3\u201314% of the immediate incremental benefits and 3\u20137% of the incremental benefits \nat full development.  While  the  potential  ability  of  the  farmers  to  pay  the  incremental costs is \nrecognized,  they  will  be  motivated  to  pay  through  a  variety  of  practical  ways  including \n(i) allowing  in-kind  contributions  and  promoting  transparent  accountable  institutions  that  build \nconfidence among farmers that their fees and contributions will  be well used; and (ii) providing \nassurance that the Government will continue to assist in matters beyond local financial capacity, \nin ways that encourage cost sharing with beneficiaries. \n\n81. \nAnalysis of the current budget and expenditure patterns for core project districts shows \nthat  on  average  the  counterpart  funding  requirements  for  project  activities  during  project \nimplementation would be about 0.2% and 0.8% of the revenues and development expenditures, \nrespectively.  During  the  post  project  period,  the  annual  funding  requirements  to  fulfill \ngovernment  commitments  to  sustainable  irrigation  management  would  be  0.8%  of  the  district \nrevenues  and  2.7%  of  the  present  development  expenditures,  respectively.  Assuming  that \ncurrent  trends  in  funding  are  maintained,  the  district  governments  would  have  sufficient \nresources to sustain the Project\u2019s impact. \n\nF. \n\nRisks \n\n82. \nDistrict Participation. All district governments visited during project preparation realize \nthe  importance  of  improving  water  resources  management  and  were  enthusiastic  in \nimplementing sector reforms. However, the risk remains that some districts may not be keen to \nsubject themselves to the transparency requirements and participatory approach demanded by \nthe  Project.  The  risk  is  mitigated  by  the  sector  approach, with project participation determined \non  a  competitive  basis  where  the  potential  participating  districts  are  much  larger  than  can  be \naccommodated (25 districts out of 63 potential districts will be selected).  \n\n83. \nInteragency  Coordination.  Much  of  the  authority  and  responsibility  vested  to date  in \nthe national sector agencies for project implementation  will be transferred to local governments, \nand the national agencies will be expected to provide important technical and advisory support \nto the local government agencies concerned. The Project will be implemented during a period of \nevolving  decentralization  and  as  a  result  might  face  coordination  problems  between  national \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n19\n\nsector  agencies  and  regional  governments.  The  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  providing  a  forum \nthrough NSC for discussing the coordination and related issues. \n\n84. \nGovernance and Anticorruption Measures. Good governance assumes an important \ndimension  in  the  Project  because  of  the  emphasis  on  decentralized  implementation.  The \nconcern will be addressed by strengthening both the service delivery and management capacity \nat  district  and  WUA  levels,  and  the  participatory  approach  to  project  planning  and \nimplementation,  thereby  improving  transparency  and  accountability.  District-level  activities  will \nbe  approved  and  overseen  by  the  IC  comprising  government  officials  and  non-government \nmembers including WUA representatives. The activities for legal education, legal services, and \ncommunity  capacity  building  will  also  pay  particular  attention  to  good  governance,  and  to \nhelping water users understand and act on their rights.  Most O&M and repair and rehabilitation \nworks  will  be  carried  out  by  the  WUAs,  unless  these  require  special  skills,  techniques,  or \nequipment not available locally. A recent audit by the World Bank of works carried out by WUAs \nin JIIWMP confirms that the quality of these works is, in most cases , better than similar works \ncarried  out  by  domestic  contractors,  and  involved  lower  unit  cost.  Summary  information  on \nscheme-level  expenditures  will  be  posted  on  office  boards  for  public  view.  The Project  will \nprovide  for  resources  to  establish  financial  management  services  at  national,  provincial,  and \ndistrict levels and to undertake independent scheme-level audits. \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n85. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  project \n\nimplementation  period  by  earmarking \n\nFunds  from  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds  and  the  corresponding  counterpart \nfunds,  necessary  to  finance  the  project  activities,  will  be  made  available \nthroughout \nfunds, \nnotwithstanding (a) any reallocation of authority or responsibility for channeling of \nexternal  assistance  and  provision  of  corresponding  counterpart  contributions \nbetween  the  central  Government,  provinces,  and  the  districts  or  (b)  any \nrequirements for provision of matching counterpart funds for funding the project \nfull \nactivities \nimplementation of Laws Nos. 22 and 25 of 1999 and Ministry of Finance KepMen \nNo. 35 of 2003, unless otherwise agreed by ADB;

This  includes \nsmallholders  and  tenant  farmers  who  make  up  the  majority  of  cultivators.  Irrigation  reduces  risk  and \nincreases  livelihood  security.  Equitable  and  secured  access  to  water,  and  participation  in  water \nmanagement has a major impact on the livelihood opportunities for poor rural people. \n \nB. \nProposed Classification: Poverty Intervention  \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\nYES \n\nThematic  Classification:  Economic  Growth  and \nGood Governance \n\nParticipation Process \n\nIrrigation  increases  and  stabilizes  the  production  of  rice  and  other  crops,  ensuring  food  and  income  for \nsmall  farmers  and  agricultural  laborers  in  the  project  provinces.  Rural  poverty  rates  in  the  six  provinces \nthat  will  receive  support  for  irrigation  management  range  from  20%  to  29%.  The  five  core  subproject \ndistricts have poverty incidence ranging from 18% to 30% against the national average poverty incidence \nof  18.2%.  The  incidence  of  poverty  among  households  employed  in  agriculture  is  higher  at  40%, \naccounting  for  58%  of  total  poor  in  the  country.  The  incidence  of  poverty  is  an  important  criterion  in \nsubproject  district  selection,  and  the  proportion  of  poor  among  the  project  beneficiaries  are  expected  to \nbe  significantly  higher  than  20%.  The  poverty  impact  ratio  for  the  core  schemes  has  been  estimated  at \n0.32. \n \nC. \nStakeholder analysis prepared: \nParticipation Strategy prepared: \nThe  participation  strategy  for  activities  supported  under  the  loan  will  focus  on  empowering  water  users \nassociations (WUAs) and their  federations (WUAFs) in the governance of irrigation systems. Government \nfield staff and assigned  nongovernment  organizations/research institutions will assist in the establishment \nand strengthening of  WUAs/WUAFs. WUAs/WUAFs will prepare irrigation management plans), enter into \nirrigation management agreements with the district government, take over the governance of the scheme, \nand undertake  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and  improvement  activities  on  a  cost-sharing  basis, \nwith financial support from the kabupaten irrigation improvement fund. \n \n \nD. \nGender Plan Prepared \nThe  gender  and  development  strategy  will  include  various  steps  to  enhance  women\u2019s  access  to \ninformation,  participation  in  irrigation  management  institutions  and  ability  to  protect  their  interests  and \nimprove  their  livelihoods.

While  capacity  building  at  the  district  government  and  water  user \nassociation  (WUA)  level  will  be  a  major  focus  of  the  Project,  it  will  also  provide  support  for \nundertaking  routine  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and  selected  rehabilitation  and \nupgrading (R&U) of existing irrigation schemes. It is these aspects of the Project that were the \nfocus of the initial environmental evaluation (IEE) studies to ensure that the beneficial impacts of \nthe Project are fully realized and any negative impacts are adequately mitigated. Separate IEE \nreports  have  been  prepared  for  the  five  core  subproject  schemes , which then allowed generic \nconclusions to be drawn on the overall environmental impact of the Project.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe six provinces in the project area experience a tropical monsoon climate and benefit \nfrom rainfall brought generally from October to March by the movement of the intertropical zone \nof convergence. The climate of the southern part of South Sulawesi and northern part of Central \nand East Java provinces has a more extended and distinct dry season than other parts in the \nproject area. Climate is also affected by altitude and exposure to prevailing winds so that quite \nhigh rainfall in the higher areas of the drier provinces is more prevalent.  \n \nWithin  the  six  provinces,  five  core  subproject  districts  were  studied  in  detail.  The  type, \n3. \nsize, and number of irrigation schemes in the core subproject districts are given in Table  A5.1. \nMost of the schemes are classified as small and medium scale. The absence of large schemes \nshould  be  noted;  these  are  generally  found  on  flatter  terrain  and  are  not  being  targeted  under \nthe Project. \n \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nTable A5.1: Irrigation Scheme Type, Size, and Numbers in Core Subproject Districts \n \n\nArea/Number \n\nType , Size \n\nIrrigated Area (ha) \nMadiun \nEast \nJava \n\nSinjai \nSouth \nSulawesi \n17,650 \n5,770 \n \n\nBanyumas \nCentral \nJava \n\nGarut \nWest \nJava \n5,949  35,370 \n5,770 \n6,369 \n \n \n\nLampung \nSelatan \nLampung \n17,690 \n0 \n \n\nSinjai, \nSouth \nSulawesi \n122 \n29 \n \n\n0 \n0 \n \n\nNumber of Schemes \n\nBanyuma\ns, Central \nJava \n\nMadiun \nEast \nJava \n\n2,847 \n\n5,577 \n\n5,398 \n\n2,847 \n\n8,238 \n\n5,840 \n\n3,315 \n\n7,577 \n\n12,305 \n\n9,780 \n\n0 \n\n3,617 \n\n0 \n\n2,435 \n\n0 \n\n8 \n\n7 \n\n0 \n\n230 \n30,314 \n\n0 \n\n230 \n24,648  51,564 \n\n0 \n22,973 \n\n0 \n33,090 \n\n12 \n159 \n\n0 \n471 \n\n12 \n159 \n\nha = hectare, PIK = small irrigation schemes \nSource: District Government Inventories from either Sub Dinas Pengairan or BAPPEDA. \n \n4. \nThe  five  core  subproject  irrigation  schemes  chosen  for  further  analysis  were  generally \nlocated  in  areas  with  a  longer  dry  season,  i.e.,  with  3\u20134 months of less than 100  millimeters \n(mm)  rain  per month,  in  rolling  to  hilly  and  steep  terrain  with  low  average  plot  sizes, as these \nareas are generally associated with poorer farmer groups.

Also,  with  the  virtual  absence  of  natural  ecosystems, there is also  very  low  risk  of \nencountering and impacting the habitat of any listed endangered species of flora and fauna. \n \nC. \n \n6. \nThe IEE findings are summarized in Table A5.2. The IEE has concluded that on balance, \nthe beneficial environmental impacts of the Project will considerably exceed the minor negative \nimpacts  that  will  be  associated  only  with  the  activities  related  to  rehabilitation  and  upgrading \n(R&U).  The  beneficial  impacts  of  the  Project  include:  (i) more  efficient  allocation  of  water \nresources , which are increasingly under pressure by other sectors such as urban water supply, \nindustry,  and  energy;  (ii) improved  routine  O&M  resulting  from  the  project  focus  on  increased \ninvolvement of WUA in scheme governance; and (iii) increase in agricultural production through \nmore efficient use brought about by improved O&M and R&U.  However, construction activities \nin  R&U,  if  not  undertaken  properly,  may  have  short-term  negative  environmental  impacts. \nMeasures  incorporated  in  the  project  design  to  mitigate  such  impacts  are  discussed  in  the \nfollowing paragraphs.  \n \n7. \nEnvironmental Management Plan. To ensure that the Project takes full account of its \nfor \nenvironmental \nenvironmental impact mitigation has been prepared (Supplementary Appendix B). This EMP will \nbecome part of the operational guidelines and criteria to be placed in the project administration \nmemorandum. Provision has been made for training of WUA members, district water resources \nincluding \nservices \nenvironmental monitoring.  \n \n8. \nProblems Related to Construction. Typical short-term negative environmental impacts \nassociated  with  R&U  activities  involving  weirs  and  control  and  drop  structures  in  canals  may \ninclude:  (i) the  use  of  borrow  areas,  rarely  rehabilitated,  such  as  quarries  for  construction \nmaterials,  leads  to  unsightly  sites  along  local  roads;  (ii) the use of river channel materials can \nincrease  channel  scouring  and  water  turbidity,  which  will  have  short-term  impacts  on  local \nfisheries; (iii) if timber is required for construction, it is often extracted from local forests that are \nin  steeper  terrain,  thus  leading  to  the  risk  of  soil  erosion;  and  (iv)   local  traffic  patterns are \ndisrupted.  Environmental  awareness  through  training  and  involvement  of  local  WUAs  in  the \nconstruction activities will minimize the potential negative impacts. Construction in a scheme will \nbe approved in two or three packages to be undertaken by WUAs over 2\u20133 years, and approval \nof  second  or  third  package  by  the  district  authorities  will  be  subject  to  fulfillment  of  several \nconditions, including adherence to the EMP.  \n \nProblems Related to Operations. A potential problem during the operational stages of \n9. \nirrigation  projects  is  the  pollution  of  surface  water  and  groundwater  due  to  the  overuse  of \ninorganic fertilizers and pesticides.  Such overuse has declined significantly in Indonesia due to \nthe withdrawal of subsidies and the increasing awareness of the negative impacts of overuse. \nThe  Project  will  provide  continued  support  to  public awareness  through  agricultural extension \nservices.  The  water  resources  information  management  system  component  of  the  project  will \nprovide  for  monitoring  of  surface  water  and  groundwater  quality  in  project  districts,  and  the \n\nresponsibilities,  a  project  environment  management  plan \n\n(DWRS),  and  other  agencies  concerned  on  EMP \n\nrequirements, \n\n(EMP) \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n33 \n\nfindings  will  help  assess  the  effectiveness  of  project  design  in  controlling  agricultural  pollution \nand initiate other measures if required. \n \n10. \nEnvironmental  Monitoring.  The  project  performance  management  system \nsubcomponent  for  overall  monitoring  and  assessment  of  project  performance  provides  for \nenvironmental  monitoring,  including  undertaking  baseline  surveys.  There  will  also  be  an \nallocation  of  funds  to  hire  local  nongovernment  organizations,  universities,  or  qualified \nindividuals to carry out ad hoc evaluations or surveys on an as-needed basis. \n\n \nTable A5.2: Initial Environmental Examination Findings of Core Schemes \n\nScheme \nName \n\nScheme  \nType \n\n \nObservation \n\n \nProvince  \n\n \n\nCore \nSubproject \nDistrict \n \n\nLampung  Lampung \n\nSelatan \n\n \nBaturaja \n\nCentral \nJava \n\nCilacap \nand \nBanyumas \n\nSerayu \n\nEast  \nJava \n\nMadiun \n\nDam \nSewu \n\nSouth \nSulawesi \n\nSinjai \n\nBalakia 1 \nand 2 \n\n \nSmall, multivillage, \nmultiethnic \nbackground \n\nCovers secondary \ncanal of a larger \noverall scheme \n\nMedium-sized, \nwith groundwater \nbeing proposed for \nuse in the tail end \narea \n\nMedium-sized \nscheme in steep \nterrain with \nterraced plateau \n\n \nEnvironmental impacts of the \nproposed options are of minor \nsignificance.

Nonetheless, all \nadditional  subprojects  to  be  selected  will  require  environmental  assessments  using  the \nIndonesian  AMDAL  (environmental  assessment)  system  and  the  Project\u2019s  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (Supplementary  Appendix  B).  In  some  circumstances,  the  resulting \nassessment  may  mean  that  a  detailed  environmental  impact  assessment  would  need  to  be \nprepared as part of project design. However, based on the results of the field work to date, it is \nnot  anticipated  that  an  environmental  impact  assessment  will  be  required  for  the  types  of \nsubprojects being proposed. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nLAND ACQUISITION, RESETTLEMENT  AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLES \n\nBackground \n\nGeneral Policy \n\n \nA. \n \nThe Project provides for supporting the sustainable operation of irrigation infrastructure \n1. \nin  subproject  schemes  through  an  intensive  participatory process. Of the four core subproject \nschemes  prepared,  two  entail  minimal  land  acquisition  and none involves any resettlement or \nimpacts  on  indigenous  people (IP). A large number of additional schemes will be selected for \nproject  support  but  none  of  these  is  expected  to  have  any  major  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  (LAR).  Similarly,  none  of  these  schemes  will  have  any  significant  impact  on \nindigenous  people  requiring  the  preparation  of  an  indigenous  people\u2019s  development  plan \n(IPDP).  Nonetheless,  measures  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project  design  to  adequately \naddress land acquisition, resettlement, and IP issues as they occur during the course of  project \nimplementation. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nLAR  and  IP  issues  will  be  handled  in  accordance  with  national  law  and  relevant  ADB \npolicies.  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (as  detailed  in  the  ADB  Handbook  on \nResettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good  Practice)  requires  the  sector  loans  to  prepare  (i) a \ncompensation policy framework and procedural guidelines (CPFPG) for the subprojects; (ii) an \ninitial  poverty  and  social  assessment  for  each  subproject  indicating  the  magnitude  of  LAR \nimpacts;  and  (iii) land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  (LARPs) for each subproject whose \ninitial  poverty  and  social  assessment  indicates  significant  LAR  impacts.  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples requires that (i) each initial poverty and social assessment  should indicate \nthe  magnitude  and  type  of  IP  impacts;  (ii) a  specific  IP  action  plan  should  be  prepared,  if \nimpacts  are  limited;  and  (iii) a  stand-alone  indigenous  people\u2019s  development  plan  (IPDP) \nincluding an implementation budget and schedule should be prepared if impacts are severe. A \nCPFPG  and  an  IP  action  plan  have  been  prepared  to  guide  the  LAR  and  IP  issues  of  the \nProject. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe  CPFPG  reflects  the  main  LAR  preparation  and  implementation  principles.  These \ninclude:  (i) negative  impacts  will  be  minimized  as  much  as  possible;  (ii) compensation will be \nsufficient  to  improve  or  at  least  restore  pre-project  incomes  and  living  standards  of  affected \npersons;  (iii) affected  persons  will  be  fully  consulted  on  compensation  options  and  land \nacquisition planning; (iv) asset compensation will be provided at replacement rates; and (v) lost \nasset  compensation  and  rehabilitation  provisions/allowances  will  be  provided  in  full  before \nground  leveling  and  demolition.  ADB  approval  of  a  subproject  involving  significant  land \nacquisition or resettlement will be subject to ADB's approval of the LARP.  \n \n4. \nlosses, and sets rehabilitation subsidies as follows:  \n\nThe CPFPG stipulates eligibility and entitlements for land and eventual house or income \n\nCompensation Policy Framework and Procedural Guidelines \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\npermanent  agricultural/residential  land  losses  will  be  compensated  in  cash  at \nmarket rates; \ntemporary land losses will be paid in cash at market rates;  \nhouse and building losses will be compensated in cash at replacement rates, free \nof demolition expenses and salvaged materials; \ncrop losses will be paid in cash at market rates;  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n35 \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nrelocation expenses covering transport costs will be paid to the affected persons; \nand \ncompensation for business losses based on tax declarations will be paid to each \naffected person for each month of interruption of business activities. \n\n \n5. \nAs  for  LAR  processing  procedures,  CPFPG  establishes  that  (i) after  subproject \nidentification and completion of preliminary design, the district government, as the implementing \nagency  (IA),  will  carry  out  an  initial  social  assessment  (ISA)  to determine preliminary impact \ndata  and  the  socioeconomic  features  of  the  affected  persons ;  (ii) if  subproject  impacts  are \nidentified  as  significant,  a  full  LARP  will  be  prepared;  (iii) if impacts are identified as less than \nsignificant, only a short LARP will be prepared. \n \n6. \n \n\nThe CPFPG also details the main organizational features and tasks of the LAR process: \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nThe  Minister  of  Home  Affairs  has  overall  supervisory,  reviewing,  and  financial \nresponsibility  for  LAR.  Water  users  associations  (WUAs)  will  prepare  and \nimplement specific LARPs with the full participation of their members and support \nof  district  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  units  for  tasks  such  as  asset \nvaluation, entitlement delivery, and issuance of land acquisition, demolition, and \nbuilding  permits.  Field \ntasks  such  as  paying  compensation,  selecting \nreplacement land, and providing livelihood support will rest with village and WUA \npersonnel. \n\nSubproject schemes, including LARPs, will be designed and implemented by the \nWUAs  based  on  an  irrigation  management  plan  prepared  with  the  full \nparticipation  of  WUA  members  and  beneficiary  communities.  A  primer \nsummarizing the CPFPG will be sent to all affected persons and the CPFPG and \nLARP  in  Bahasa  Indonesia  will  be  made  available  at  the  WUA  office  of  each \nscheme that require land acquisition. The same documents in English will be put \non the ADB web site. Primers for subprojects in IP areas will be compiled in local \nlanguages. \n\nGrievances will first be lodged within the WUA. If no settlement is reached within \n2 weeks, the complainant will have 1 month to raise the case with the district land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  unit.  If  still  unresolved  within  2  weeks,  the  case \nshould  be  sent  to  the  office  of  the  bupati  (district  governor).  Final  appeal  is \navailable in the courts \n\nBoth  internal  and  external  monitoring  of  LAR  will  be  carried  out.  The  district \ngovernment will set a monthly reporting system involving the land acquisition and \nresettlement  units.  External  monitoring  will  be  assigned  to  an  independent \ninstitution such an NGO or a local university. External monitoring will be carried \nout on a selective basis for schemes with substantial impacts resulting from LAR \nand/or involvement of vulnerable peoples. External monitoring will be conducted \nthrough  one  or  two  field  visits,  and  monitoring  reports  will  be  submitted  to  the \ndistrict project coordination and monitoring office which in turn will pass them to \nthe national project coordination and monitoring office.  At project conclusion, the \nexternal  monitoring  agency  will  prepare  a  report  providing  a  comprehensive \nevaluation of the LAR program. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n(v) \n\nUnit  compensation  rates  for  items  negatively  affected  by  each  subproject  and \ndetailed budgets for impacts compensation will be provided in each LARP. Cost \nestimates will be adjusted annually, based on the inflation rate of the preceding \nyear.  \n\nIndigenous People \u2019s Participatory Planning Framework \n\n \nD. \n \n7. \n\"Isolated  vulnerable  peoples\"  (IVPs)  is  the  term  used  officially  by  the  Indonesian \nGovernment to describe groups that have the characteristics of \"indigenous people\" as used in \nADB policy (the rest of this appendix will use the term \u201cIVPs\u201d). For the purposes of this Project, \nIVPs  are  defined  as  those  that  present  varying  degrees  of  the  following  characteristics:  (i) a \nclose  attachment  to  ancestral  territories  and  to  the  natural  resources  in  these  areas;  (ii) self-\nidentification  and  identification  by  others  as  members  of  a  distinct  cultural  group;  (iii) an \nindigenous  language,  different  from  the  common  regional  language;  (iv) the  presence  of \ncustomary  social  and  political  institutions;  and  (v) primarily  subsistence-oriented  production \nactivities. \n \n8. \nIVPs are not prevalent in all the potential project locations and were not identified during \nfield works for the subproject schemes. It is possible that they  may be found in some areas of \nthe  provinces  of  Lampung  and  South  Sulawesi  during  implementation  of  the  Project.  The \nfollowing  steps  will  be  taken  to  ensure  that,  where  groups of  IVPs  exist, the Project caters to \ntheir specific needs: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nDuring the facilitator training, facilitators will be trained in the identification of \nIVPs.  Through  baseline  surveys  and  community  self-help  exercises  and \ndiscussions  on  community  empowerment, \nthe \npresence and numbers of  groups of IVPs in the community and report this to \ntheir supervisor; \n\nfacilitators  will \n\nidentify \n\nFor  the  areas  where  groups  of  IVPs  are  identified,  the  supervisor  will \norganize  orientation  training  for  relevant  facilitators  in  how  to  work  with \ngroups  of  IVPs  in  a  useful  way  to  identify  mechanisms  for  effective \nparticipation, and address specific challenges in working with such groups;  \n\nFacilitators will be hired locally to the extent possible and will be familiar with \nsuch groups. They will also be rotated as necessary to ensure that those that \nhave been trained in working with  groups of IVPs, or have specific skills that \nwould  be  beneficial  in  working  with  such  groups,  are  made  available  in  the \nright places; \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(iv)  Where  groups  of  IVPs  are  identified,  efforts  will  be  made  to  ensure  that  at \nleast one community cadre is from the group and able to communicate easily \nwith the group; and \n\n(v)  Where  the  isolated  vulnerable  group  speaks  a  language  different  from \nBahasa Indonesia, relevant brochures and documents will be translated into \nthe appropriate language. \n\n \n\n \n\nThese steps will be aimed at ensuring that IVPs participate fully in the Project, are aware \n9. \nof  their  rights  and  responsibilities,  and  are  able  to  voice  their  needs  during  the  community \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n37 \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nsurvey  exercise  and  irrigation  subprojects  formulation.  In  addition,  IVPs will be encouraged to \nsubmit subproject proposals that cater to groups\u2019 needs. \n \n10. \nInitiatives under the IP action plan will be commensurate with the impact severity level of \neach subproject affecting vulnerable groups. Impact severity is defined based on the degree of \nvulnerability of the affected peoples and the type of impacts, i.e: \n \n\nlimited  impacts  occur  when  (a)  the  affected  peoples  are  fully  integrated  in \nmainstream  society  and  in  control  of  the  local  administrative  system,  and/or  (b) \nimpacts do not have broad community or sociocultural dimensions; and \n\nsevere  impacts  occur  when  (a)  the  affected  peoples  maintain  a  degree  of \nsociocultural  and  institutional  distinction  from  mainstream  society  and/or  (b) \nimpacts carry a broad sociocultural dimension and have wide community effects. \n\n \n11. \nAction  for  limited  impacts  will  include  a  brief  assessment  of  the  affected  peoples\u2019 \nsocioeconomic and cultural status and the strategy and outline of actions to address associated \nconcerns. The action plan will be included in the irrigation management plan (IMP) or the LARP. \nAction  for  severe  impacts  will  be  documented  in  a  stand-alone  IPDP  providing  (i) an \nassessment of the affected peoples\u2019 situation; (ii) an assessment of eventual LAR impacts and \nrelated  compensation  plan,  and  (iii) a  community  action  plan  (CAP)  detailing  needed \nrehabilitation/development  provisions  and  related \nimplementation  mechanisms/processes. \nIPDPs  will  be  designed/implemented  through  a  participatory  framework  involving  the  affected \npeoples and other stakeholders and will include specific budgets and schedules. The likelihood \nof  a  stand-alone  IPDP  being  necessary  for  the  Project  is  very  low  as  a  review  of  typical \nschemes has concluded that only minor impacts involving LAR may result from the rehabilitation \nand upgrading of existing irrigation schemes. \n \n12.  Where  IVPs  are  identified,  the  irrigation  commission  will  require  the  district  project \nimplementation unit to report on the IVPs\u2019 participation in the Project. Provisions will be made in \nthe  project  performance  management  system  for  monitoring  the  involvement  of  IVPs.  Any \nissues  or  complaint  will  be  raised  with  the  irrigation  commission.  Designated  staff  within  the \nproject implementation unit will be responsible for following up on complaints and ensuring that \nthey are handled adequately.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 38   Appendix 7\n\n                                                                  SUMMARY COST TABLES\n\nTable A7.1: Expenditure Accounts Project Cost Summary\n \n \n\n% Total\nBase\nTotal\nCurrency Exchange Costs Exchange Costs\n\n($ Million)\nForeign\n\n%\nForeign\n\nLocal\n\n I.

Financial  analysis \nexamined  the  sustainability  of  the  subproject  schemes  from  farmers\u2019  points  of  view;  economic \nanalysis  determined  the  incremental  benefits  from  the  expected  increase  in  agricultural \nproduction following improved scheme operation. \n\nB. \n\nMajor Assumptions \n\n2. \nThe Project has an implementation period of 7 years and the economic life of the project \ninterventions has been assumed to be 20 years. For this analysis, the interbank exchange rate of  \nRp8,500 per US dollar prevailing at the time of project appraisal, has been used. A discount rate \nof 12% has been used to ascertain the net present value (NPV) and also as a cut-off point for the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR). \n\nFinancial  benefits  and  costs  are  estimated  in  constant  mid-year  2002  terms.  Financial \n3. \nfarmgate prices are based on findings of the surveys undertaken for the feasibility study during \n2002. The analysis uses a world price numeraire where economic prices for traded crop outputs \nand  inputs  have  been  based  on  the  World  Bank  Commodity  Price  Projections.  Prices  for  rice \npaddy,  soybeans,  and  phosphatic  and  potassic  fertilizers  are  estimated  at  import  parity,  while \nthose for nitrogenous fertilizers at export parity (Supplementary Appendix E). Labor costs have \nbeen  shadow-priced  at  0.80  of  the  wage  rates  while  other  inputs  have  been  adjusted  by  the \nstandard  conversion  factor  of  0.90.  Due  to  technical,  management,  and  institutional  factors, \nirrigation  supplies  within  a  given  scheme  are  unevenly  distributed,  resulting  in  significant \ndifferences  in  cropping  patterns,  cropping  intensities,  and  yields  in  different  reaches within the \nservice  area.  Table  A14.1  shows  that  with  one  exception,  the  cropping  intensity  declines  and \nincidence of poverty rises as one moves further down on an irrigation system. Using crop models \nfor  the  overall  scheme  and  the  reach  specific  cropping  pattern  and  cropping  intensity  data, \nreach- and scheme-specific farm models have been developed. For the financial analysis, only \nthe hired labor has been costed while for the economic analyses both family and hired labor has \nbeen costed. Farm models and budgets are given in Supplementary Appendix E. \n\nTable A14.1: Reach-Wise Differences in Cropping Intensity and Poverty Incidence \n(%) \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nUpper Reach \n \n160 \n227 \n\nMiddle Reach \n \n125 \n76 \n\n1.

The  Project  will  strengthen  irrigation  and  water \nresources  management  capacity  of  25  district  governments  and  will  train  5,000  district  staff. \nWhile the participatory and needs-based nature of the Project makes it difficult to determine the \nlevel and combinations of training activities on a particular scheme, it is anticipated that 36,250 \nmembers from 6,250 water users associations (WUAs) will be trained. It is envisaged that 6,250 \nschemes benefiting from the Project will cover about 0.63 million hectares (ha) of irrigated area \nand will represent 1.5 million households. Table 14.2 summarizes the project coverage in terms \nof beneficiary population and area. \n\nTable A14.2: Project Beneficiary Population and Area \n\nNumber of \nWUAs/Schemes \n\nHousehold \nCoverage \n(\u2019000) \n\nIrrigated Area Coverage \n(ha) \n\n6,250 \n2,500 \n6,250 \n1,376 \n\n1,500 \n600 \n1,500 \n330 \n\n625,000 \n250,000 \n625,000 \n137,600 \n\nDistricts/WUAs/Schemes \nWUAs Receiving Capacity Building \nWUAs Receiving O&M Support \nWUAs Receiving SRR Support \nSchemes Receiving R&U \nO&M = Operation and Maintenance; R&U = Rehabilitation and Upgrading; WUA = Water Users\u2019 Association \nSource: PPTA 3793 Final Report 2002. \n \n6. \nQuantified Benefits. In the with-project scenario, the main agricultural benefits will be in \nthe  form  of  increased  cropping  intensities  and  improved  dry  season  rice  yields.  It  is  the  lower \nreaches  of  irrigation  systems  in  the  dry  season  when  the  water  shortages  are  most  obvious. \nFarmers  in  the  upper  reaches  can  grow  two  or  more  crops  while  those  in  the  lower  reaches \ncannot  fully  cultivate  during  the  dry  season.  Current  yields  in  general  are  lower  than  the \nprovincial  averages  suggesting  large  yield  disparities  within  the  provinces  and  highlighting  the \npotential  for  improvement.  Disparities  are  also  significant  between  the  seasons  where  on the \nsame field and with some management skills, the dry season yields are 13% to 20% lower than \nthe  wet  season  levels.  It  is  anticipated  that  management  and  infrastructure  improvements  will \nlead to higher cropping intensities and improved rice yields in both wet and dry seasons, with the \nhighest increases in the reaches that are water short at present.  \n\n7. \nIn  the  without-project  scenario,  the  practice  of  deferred  maintenance  is  expected  to \ncontinue and as a result system efficiencies are expected to deteriorate, which will in turn lead to \nlower  cropping  intensities,  lower  rice  yields,  and  greater  income  inequalities.  Detailed \nengineering assessments carried out on the sample schemes show that over the next 20 years \nas much as one third of the annual agricultural production can erode away. To be on the more \nconservative side, the analysis assumes that in the absence of the Project, lost production over a \nperiod of 20 years will be only 10% of the prevailing levels. \n\nGiven that present rice yields in the core schemes are lower than the provincial averages \n8. \nand that irrigation supplies can be significantly improved, the feasibility study findings envisage \nthat on the sample schemes the yields can increase by 15% to 75% and cropping intensities by \nup  to  40%.  For  the  purposes  of  this  analysis,  more  conservative  yield  and  cropping  intensity \nincreases  have  been  assumed.  Table  A14.3  summarizes  crop  yields  while    Table  A14.4 \nsummarizes  the  cropped  areas  and  cropping  intensities  for  the  without-  and  with-project \nscenarios.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nTable A14.3: Without- and With-Project Crop Yields on Sample Schemes  \n(t/ha) \n\nRice Paddy (HYV) \nWet Season  \n\nRice Paddy (HYV) \nDry Season  \n\nRice Paddy \nLocal Variety  \n\nScheme \nBaturaja\u2013South Lampung \nSerayu/Gambarsari\u2013Banyumas  \nSewu\u2013Madiun \nBalakia\u2013Sinjai \nHYV= high-yielding variety \nSource: Asian Development Bank Assessment based on the feasibility study findings (PPTA 3793 Final Report 2002). \n \n\nWith \nFuture \n3.84 \n3.90 \n4.00 \n3.60 \n\nPresent \nWithout \n3.50 \n- \n- \n2.50 \n\nPresent \nWithout \n3.20 \n3.25 \n3.50 \n3.00 \n\nPresent \nWithout \n4.00 \n3.75 \n4.00 \n3.70 \n\nWith \nFuture \n4.00 \n4.00 \n4.00 \n4.00 \n\nWith \nFuture \n3.50 \n- \n- \n2.75 \n\nTable A14.4: Without- and With-Project Areas and Cropping Intensities on Sample \nSchemes  \n\n \n\n \n\nScheme Area \n(hectare) \n\nCropping Intensity (%) \n\n304 \n369 \n1,324 \n836 \n\nWith Project \n163 \n213 \n211 \n180 \n\nWithout Project \n130 \n170 \n185 \n150 \n\nScheme \nBaturaja\u2013South Lampung \nSerayu/Gambarsari\u2013Banyumas \nSewu\u2013Madiun \nBalakia\u2013Sinjai \nSource: Asian Development Bank Assessment based on the feasibility study findings (PPTA 3793 Final Report 2002). \n \n9. \nNonquantified Benefits. Apart from the crop production benefits, there are a number of \nbenefits  that  cannot  be  readily  quantified,  including  (i) improved  planning  and  management  of \nirrigation  assets  brought  about  by  the  district  irrigation  management  plans  at  district  level  and \nirrigation  management  plan  at  scheme  level;  (ii) rationalization  and  capacity  building  of  district-\nlevel  services;  (iii) empowerment  (including  legal  empowerment)  of  WUAs  and  their  female \nmembers;  (iv) reduced  cost  and  improved  quality  of  rehabilitation  resulting  from  greater \ninvolvement of WUAs in scheme governance; and (v) improved access to quality information and \ndata  for  water  resources  management.  Benefits  derived  from  institutional  strengthening  and \ngood governance will have a wider impact in the project districts.  \n\n10. \nA number of  nonquantified  benefits  in  reality  are  also  critical  institutional  improvements \nrequired  in  bringing  about  and  sustaining  the  quantified  benefits,  and  the  benefits  attributed  to \nthese  are  actually  positive  externalities.  For  example,  the  organization  and  capacity building of \nWUAs  is  a  basic  building  block  of  project  implementation  and  sustainability.  However,  besides \nincreased  production,  the  full  benefits  also  include  a  legally  aware  and  civic-minded  body  of \npeople  and  more  transparent  project  implementation,  both  of  which  have  an  impact  that  is  not \njust limited to project implementation. \n\nD. \n\nAssessment of Financial Returns to Irrigators \n\n11. \nResults of the financial analyses are summarized in Table A14.5. The results show that at \nfull  development,  the  net  farm  incomes  are  expected  to  increase  by  26%  to  162%.  With  the \nexception of farms in the middle reach of the scheme in Banyumas where control on flooding in \nthe middle reach will greatly improve crop production, increases in farm income are anticipated \nto be highest on the tail reaches and lowest on the upper reaches. Given that the incidence of \npoverty  is  highest  in  the  tail  reaches  and  the  lowest  in  the  upper  reaches,  higher  incremental \nfarm incomes to the lower reaches will help reduce the current  income inequalities. \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n51 \n\nTable A14.5: Anticipated Impact on Net Farm Incomes \n\nScheme \nBaturaja\u2013South Lampung \nSerayu/Gambarsari\u2013Banyumas  \nSewu\u2013Madiun \nBalakia\u2013Sinjai \nSource:  Asian  Development  Bank  Mission  Assessment  based  on  the  feasibility  study  findings  (PPTA  3793  Final \n \n\nUpper Reach \n29 \n48 \n27 \n28 \n\nIncrease in Farm Income (%) \nMiddle Reach \n40 \n162 \n32 \n26 \n\nAverage Farm \nSize (hectare) \n0.46 \n0.28 \n0.50 \n0.58 \n\nTail Reach \n50 \n56 \n44 \n90 \n\nReport 2002). \n\nE. \n\nAssessment of Economic Returns \n\n12. \nInvestment and Recurrent Costs. All costs are in constant year 2002 terms. Investment \ncosts  are  net  of  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction.  The  local  content  of  the \ncosts  has  been  adjusted  by  the  standard  conversion  factor  while  the  foreign  component  has \nbeen  taken  at  its  full  value.  The  district-level  capacity  building  and  project  coordination  and \nmonitoring,  including  the  relevant  consultant  inputs,  help  deliver  the  planned  interventions  and \nservices,  and  hence  costs  of  these  are  appropriately  apportioned  to  individual  schemes.  The \ncosts  associated  with  project  coordination  and  monitoring  have  also  been  apportioned  among \ncomponents  according  to  the  relative  size  of  investment  costs  on  these  and  included  as \noverheads. \n\n13. \nEconomic Worth.  Results  of  the  economic  analysis  summarized  in  Table  A14.6  show \nthat the EIRR for individual schemes ranges from 19% to 60% and the NPV at a discount rate of \n12% ranges from $0.04 million to $0.48 million. The schemes generate a collective EIRR of 29% \nand an NPV of $0.82 million. Switching values have been estimated to determine the maximum \ncost overrun and the maximum reduction in incremental benefits at which the scheme will still be \neconomically  viable.  Collectively,  sample  schemes  remain  economically  viable  with  cost \noverruns  of  up  to  102%  or  reduction  in  the  incremental  benefits  of  up  to  50%.  In  view  of  the \nrecent  appreciation  in  the  value  of  rupiah,  the  lowest  exchange  rate  against  the  US  dollar  at \nwhich  the  individual  schemes  will  remain  viable  has  been  estimated  to  range  from  Rp6,064  to \nRp7,605 and for the collective sample, Rp6,246. \n\nTable A14.6: Anticipated Scheme Level Economic Worth \n \n\nSwitching Values \n\n \nScheme \n\nBaturaja\u2013South Lampung \nSerayu/Gambarsari\u2013Banyumas  \nSewu\u2013Madiun \nBalakia\u2013Sinjai \nAll Sample Schemes  \nEIRR= economic internal rate of return; NPV= net present value; Rp = rupiah \na  Fluctuations in the exchange rate will affect the foreign exchange component of the construction and O&M costs \nand the economic prices of traded inputs and outputs.

Gains for \nthe  labor  are  expected  to  be  about  Rp421.0 million  from  scheme  improvement  activities  and \nRp105.4 million from the operation and maintenance activities. Given that the hired labor will only \nbe required where the works are contracted out, the gains to the hired labor are expected to be \nabout  Rp105.2 million.2  Government  revenue  gains  amount  to  Rp491.1 million from the system \nimprovement activities and Rp5.5 million from the operation and maintenance activities. Overall \nnet  economic  gains  are  expected  to  be  about  Rp2,062.8 million  of  which  11%  accrue  to  the \nirrigators on the upper reaches, while 17% and 42% accrue to the irrigators in the middle and tail \nreaches, respectively. The anticipated share of the hired labor is expected to be about 5% and \nthat of the Government about 24%. \n\n15. \nApportioning the gains between the poor and those above the poverty line within each of \nthe  irrigator  subgroups  and  labor,  and  assuming  that  government  tax  revenues  will  be  evenly \nexpended among the population, the Project yields a PIR of 0.32. \n\nTable A14.7: Poverty Impact Ratio, Core Schemes  \n(Rp million) \n \n\n \nBenefits/ \nCosts  \n\nFinancial \nPresent \nValue a \n\nEconomic \nPresent \nValue a \n\nNet \nEconomic \nBenefits  \n\nIrrigators \non the  \nUpper \nReach \n\nIrrigators \non the  \nMiddle  \nReach \n\nIrrigators \non the  \nTail \nReach \n\nLabor \n\nGovt./ \nEconomy \n\nOverall \n\n \nIncremental Benefits  \n Net Output  \n - Upper Reach \n - Middle Reach \n - Tail Reach \nIncremental Costs  \nImplementation Costs \nLabor-Implementation \n  O&M \n- Materials & Equip. by \n\nGovt. \n\n- Materials & Equip. by \nWUAs and WUAF \n\n- Labor \nNet Present Use \nGains and Losses \nProportions of the \nPoor (%) b c \nNet Benefits to the \nPoor \nPoverty Impact Ratio  \n\n \n \n \n  4,551 \n  3,009 \n  6,121 \n \n  -4,911 \n  -2,105 \n \n \n\n-55 \n\n \n \n \n  4,621 \n  3,194 \n  6,833 \n \n  -4,920 \n  -1,684 \n \n \n\n-50 \n\n \n\n-735 \n\n \n\n-662 \n\n \n-527 \n  5,348 \n \n \n\n \n-422 \n  7,411 \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n71 \n185 \n712 \n\n491 \n421 \n\n6 \n\n74 \n\n \n105 \n  2,083 \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n70 \n\n185 \n\n712 \n\n105 \n\n105 \n\n105 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nO&M = operation and maintenance, WUA = water users association, WUAF = water users association federation. \na At a discount of 12%. \nb Based on project preparatory technical assistance survey data. \nc To be on the conservative side, poverty incidence for labor has been assumed at the rural poverty incidence. \nd Government of Indonesia.

The  2000  budget  and  expenditures  data  for  core \nproject  districts  was  inflated  to  2002  levels  and  was  compared  with  counterpart  funding \nrequirements  for  an  average  district.  During  course  of  the  project  implementation,  counterpart \nfunding  requirements  are  anticipated  to  range  from  Rp14 million  in  the  first  year  to \nRp1,046 million  in  the  third  year,  which  on  average  are  0.2%  of  the  revenue  and  0.8%  of  the \ndevelopment expenditures.
