THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nand a proposed grant, both to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the additional financing of \nthe Dhaka Environmentally Sustainable Water Supply Project.1 \n \n2.  The ongoing Dhaka Environmentally Sustainable Water Supply Project (the ongoing \nproject) will provide more reliable and improved security of water supply in Dhaka by developing \na  new  surface  water  supply  scheme  and  improving  the  existing  distribution  network.  The \nadditional financing (the project) will finance the cost overrun of the ongoing project, and a change \nin scope to (i) include a secondary distribution pipeline to ensure the overall outcome of the \nongoing  project,2 and  (ii)  empowerment  of  women  and  vulnerable  groups  in  low-income \ncommunities (LICs) and improving their access to basic infrastructure and social services. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Urbanization and water supply issues in Dhaka. The population in Dhaka is growing \nrapidly, and is expected to increase from 20 million in 2018 to 28 million in 2030 at an average \nannual growth rate of 3.0%, exacerbating the challenges in Dhaka\u2019s urban environment.3 Basic \ninfrastructure and services, including water supply, are often insufficient. The Dhaka Water Supply \nand Sewerage Authority (DWASA) provides water supply to about 20 million people. It currently \nrelies heavily on groundwater, but extraction has been increasing to meet demand, resulting in \ngroundwater depletion, with levels declining by 2\u20133 meters per year.4 Further groundwater \ndepletion (with groundwater lowering about 5 meters per year by 2030) will  potentially lead to \nwidespread land subsidence, associated higher flood level particularly combined with floods of \nincreasing magnitude due to climate change, and severe shortfall in drinking water supply.5 To \naddress this, DWASA is increasing its reliance on surface water resource from the current 22% \nto 70%. However, the main existing source of surface water in Dhaka is polluted, and it is \nincreasingly difficult to produce water of acceptable quality through treatment; this makes it \nessential for DWASA to find a good quality, sustainable water source. \n \n4.  Support of the Asian Development Bank to the ongoing project. To support DWASA\u2019s \nstrategy  (para.  3),  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  concessional  loan  of \nSDR165.0 million ($250 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) for the \nongoing project on 22 October 2013. The loan closing date is 30 June 2023 following two \nextensions.6 The ongoing project will provide more reliable and improved security of water supply \nin Dhaka, using the Meghna River as a new water source. The river is about 30 kilometers (km) \neast of Dhaka, and has water of good quality and ample quantity even during the dry season. The \nongoing project supports the development of a water intake, raw water transmission line, a water \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2013.

It also improves the existing distribution network \nto reduce nonrevenue water (NRW). Package 1, the largest package (which includes an intake, \nraw water transmission line, and WTP), is cofinanced by (i) Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement \n(AFD) for \u20ac47 million ($64 million equivalent), partially administered by ADB; and (ii) the European \nInvestment Bank for \u20ac100 million ($136 million equivalent), not administered by ADB.  \n \n5.  Performance of the ongoing project. The ongoing project is performing well. While it \nexperienced startup delays (para. 6), it is now on track with solid progress to meet its outcome. \nUnder output 1 (new surface water supply system developed), package 1 is being steadily \nimplemented with 40% of design and construction works completed as of 31 July 2021. Package \n2 for treated water transmission line  was awarded in May 2021. Package 3.1 for primary \ndistribution line is expected to be awarded in September 2021. Output 2 (distribution network \nstrengthened) has been completed in July 2021 except for small packages, and has overachieved \nthe 376 km targets for improved distribution networks by about 120 km. Under output 3 (project \nmanagement and administration adequately supported), the project management unit (PMU), the \ntwo teams of management and supervision consultants, and three nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) are fully in place.7 As of 31 July 2021, ongoing project cumulative contract awards were \nat 97%, with disbursements at 69%, while time elapsed was 80%. All fiduciary and safeguard \npolicy requirements have been met. Management of risks is satisfactory. The current project \nperformance  rating  is  \u2018on  track.\u2019  The  ongoing  project  is  highly  relevant  in  addressing  the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) and future pandemics as it will establish a sustainable and safe \nwater supply system which is essential for basic hygiene.  \n \n6.  Rationale for additional financing. The ongoing project is experiencing cost overruns. \nProcurement of package 1, using a design-build-operate (DBO) contract, took about 3.5 years \nbecause of (i) an unfavorable security situation in Dhaka, which led to five extensions of the bid \nsubmission deadline; (ii) litigation filed by a bidder; (iii) the complexity of evaluating the DBO \ncontract; and (iv) lengthy government approval process for this large contract. After the contract \naward in May 2018, the government procedures for land acquisition required an additional year, \nand delays were experienced in the release of cofinancier funds. While these issues were \nsubsequently  settled,  the  overall  delays  led  to  a  price  escalation  of  $84.9  million  by  the \ncommencement of package 1 in May 2019.8 In addition, because the design by the awarded \nbidder differed technically from the outline design at appraisal, the contract amount of package 1 \nwas increased by $49.9 million to $329.2 million. During bid evaluation, it was concluded that the \nproposed design was technically more robust and necessary to address liquefaction and river \nerosion risks.9 The land acquisition cost for the overall project also increased by $42.8 million \nbecause of changes in local law. Lastly, the financiers\u2019 loans depreciated by $45.7 million due to \ncurrency fluctuation. These factors, together with the associated increase in taxes and duties by \n$78.0 million, consultant cost by $16.2 million, and other items,10 resulted in an aggregate cost \noverrun of $336.0 million in the ongoing project including the government portion. Also, the \ngovernment has requested a new scope of package 3.2, at a cost of $56.2 million, for secondary \ndistribution pipeline, as it is essential to achieve the overall project outcome (footnote 2).  \n \n7.  Additional financing is a suitable modality as it will ensure continuity of the ongoing works, \n \n7  The progress of the ongoing Gender Action Plan is in the Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  To settle the issues, DWASA has (i) increased the safeguard team\u2019s inputs to smoothly process land acquisition, \nand (ii) set up a clear process for EIB fund flow with specific timeline and procedures at each milestone. \n9  While there is no other DBO package in the project, the lessons were discussed in detail, and DWASA and the \ngovernment gained more experience in DBO evaluation processes. \n10 Other items are $18.5 million for recurrent cost, small packages in output 2, and price escalation since mid-2019. \n \n ", "3 \nand efficiency by using the same implementation and project management arrangements. To \navoid any further funding shortfall, DWASA and the government will (i) conduct third-party vetting \nof any future variation proposal by the contractors; (ii) strengthen cost containment; and (iii) \nstrengthen the PMU, especially on safeguards, to accelerate contractors\u2019 access to sites. The \noverall project (i) remains technically feasible, economically viable, financially sound, and in \ncompliance with safeguard covenants; (ii) is accorded high priority by the government (para. 9); \n(iii) retains the same development objectives as the ongoing project and strengthens them with \nthe new output 4 ($5.7 million) for gender empowerment (para. 12); and (iv) is consistent with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (para. 9). The overall project is expected to be completed by \n30 September 2025, within 3 years from the closing date of the ongoing project (30 June 2023). \n \n8.  Lessons. Key lessons from the ongoing project and other ADB-funded projects in urban \nand water sector include (i) a thorough assessment should be made of the capacity of the \nexecuting agency and the government to evaluate a complex contract modality; (ii) project \nreadiness should be as high as possible; (iii) the project implementation period should fully reflect \nthe local security situation, and capacity of the executing agency and the government to introduce \na new contract modality; (iv) to minimize the risk of cost increases, the quality of site investigation \nshould be as high as possible, even for DBO contracts;11 and (v) adequate support for capacity \nbuilding is necessary for smooth land acquisition. ADB will continue to document and disseminate \nthe lessons learned from this project to inform future projects.  \n \n9.   Alignment with strategic priorities. The overall project aligns with the government\u2019s \nEighth Five Year Plan 2021\u20132025 which prioritizes meeting  the basic needs of the people amid \nrapid urbanization.12 It also aligns with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Bangladesh, 2021\u2013\n2025, that aims to ease urban infrastructure constraints.13 It will contribute to the following ADB \nStrategy 2030 operational priorities (OPs): (i) making cities more livable (OP4) and tackling \nclimate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental \nsustainability (OP3) by improving water supply in Dhaka through an environmentally sustainable \nscheme;  (ii)  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity  (OP6)  by  strengthening \nDWASA\u2019s  capacity;  (iii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality  (OP2)  by  building  basic \ninfrastructures with an emphasis on, and empowering women in, LICs; and (iv) addressing \nremaining poverty and reducing inequalities (OP1) by providing basic infrastructure in LICs.14  \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n10.  The overall project is aligned with the following impact: improved access to and quality of \nsustainable water supply services in Dhaka.15 The overall project will have the following outcome: \nmore reliable and improved security of water supply and sanitation in Dhaka.16 The additional \nfinancing will finance cost overruns and the change in scope under the three outputs of the \nongoing project, and finance a new output 4. \n \n11.  Outputs 1, 2, and 3. Output 1 (new surface water supply system developed) will develop \n \n11 The successful bidder of package 1 conducted their own detailed site survey. They submitted the technical proposal \nbased on the findings, which led to the cost increase, driven in particular by more robust intake and WTP structures.  \n12  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Planning. 2020.

Output 2 (existing distribution network \nin zone 6 strengthened) will improve the existing distribution network in zone 6 as a continuation \nof DWASA\u2019s efforts toward NRW reduction including new or regularized connections in LICs. The \nadditional financing will finance cost overruns under the remaining small packages under output \n2. Output 3 (DWASA\u2019s management and administration capacity improved) remains unchanged.  \n \n12.  Output 4: Empowerment of women and vulnerable groups supported. The additional \nAsian Development Fund (ADF) grant financing will be critical in broadening the access of women \nand vulnerable groups in LICs to basic infrastructure and social services, while enabling them to \nact  upon their rights through  sector-focused legal  empowerment  initiatives in line  with the \nSustainable  Development  Goal  (SDG)  5  transformative  gender  agenda.  It  will  (i)  expand \nDWASA\u2019s gender equity strategy to emphasize women\u2019s equitable rights to clean water and \nsanitation and address this consideration in DWASA\u2019s training modules, tools, and programs;  \n(ii) develop socially and gender inclusive emergency response plans for DWASA informed by the \nCOVID-19 experience, for dissemination and possible replication across other water utilities in \nBangladesh and in the region;18 (iii) strengthen women's representation and effective participation \nin governance structures and processes in CBOs to (a) inform financial decisions and budgetary \nallocations for basic infrastructure and social services addressing the needs of women and \nvulnerable  groups;  and  (b)  contribute  to  gradual  institutionalization  of  legal  empowerment \ninitiatives (legal literacy and legal aid services) that address, among other issues, the increased \nrate of gender-based violence; and (iv) develop gender-inclusive toilets and bathing facilities in \nselected LICs. The ADF grant will support a range of transformative reforms that would have been \nimpossible to support through the loan proceeds for the additional financing that will fund cost \noverruns of the investment project. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n13.  Support for strategic improvement of water supply in Dhaka. Since 2007, ADB has \nbeen supporting DWASA\u2019s strategic direction to improve water supply services. The completed \nand ongoing ADB-funded projects established district-metered areas and rehabilitated water \nsupply networks, contributing to lower NRW and more judicious use of existing water.19 The \noverall project will be mutually complementary to these efforts by connecting the new bulk water \nsupply  system  using  surface  water  resources  to  the  improved  network,  thereby  providing \ncontinuous water supply service to the citizens with sustainable resources.20 ADB has been also \nholistically  supporting  DWASA\u2019s  institutional  strengthening. 21  Further,  ADB  has  provided \n \n17 Output 1 will contribute to switching from ground water to surface water source, and avoiding further land subsidence \nand associated higher flood level that takes longer to subside. \n18 For item (ii), the grant will support DWASA\u2019s gender commitments and facilitate more holistic reforms in its programs, \ni.e., upscaling of water, sanitation, and hygiene activities and COVID-19 pandemic-related responses. \n19  ADB. 2007.

For the proposed additional financing, climate mitigation is estimated to cost $56.46 million \nand climate adaptation is estimated to cost $34.63 million. ADB and AFD will finance 76.1% of \nmitigation costs and 89.6% of adaptation costs.27 The climate mitigation cost is derived mostly \nfrom use of energy-efficient pumps. The climate adaptation cost is derived mostly from switching \nfrom ground to surface water source.28 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The implementation arrangements of the ongoing project, including the executing and \nimplementing agency, will remain unchanged.29 These are summarized in Table 3 and described \nin detail in the PAM (footnote 23).

Climate change assessment and climate risk and vulnerability assessment \nwere prepared to assess climate change risks and capture climate change financing. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n21.  Economic analysis. Economic analysis was conducted for the overall project. The \neconomic rationale for the government\u2019s intervention is sound, as the project aims to provide \nstronger and more sustainable urban basic services focusing on water supply in Dhaka City. The \neconomic internal rate of return of the overall project is estimated at 12.4%, which is higher than \nthe economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCC) estimated at 9.0%,32 indicating significant \neconomic returns. The results of the sensitivity analysis are also satisfactory against all downside \nrisks. In addition, the project is expected to further increase its economic viability if unquantifiable \nbenefits such as environmental improvements are included in the analysis.33  \n \n22.  Financial analysis. Financial analysis was conducted to assess the financial viability of \nthe overall project based on expected project revenues and capital and O&M expenditures.34 The \nfinancial internal rate of return is estimated at 3.2%, higher than the weighted average cost of \ncapital of 1.2%, indicating that the overall project would generate sufficient revenues to cover both \ncapital and O&M expenditures. The financial projections for DWASA (carried out for 25 years) \nalso indicate that DWASA would have sufficient revenues to cover its O&M costs as well as the \ninterest  and  principal  payments  for  its  debts,  except  for  a  brief  period  (FY2024\u2013FY2029). \nConsidering that an annual tariff increase of more than 5% requires government approval, \nDWASA needs to enhance its revenue base by (i) further reducing NRW ratio through the ongoing \nADB-funded Dhaka Water Supply Network Improvement Project (footnote 19); (ii) reducing O&M \ncosts through proper asset management and more efficient operation including establishing \nstandard  operating  procedures;  and  (iii)  enlisting  continued  government  support,  including \nconsolidating  tariff  structure  (being  prepared  under  the  Dhaka  Water  Supply  Network \nImprovement Project). ADB will provide continued policy advice and capacity-building support to \nfacilitate DWASA\u2019s financial sustainability.35  \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n23.  The contractor of package 1 will be engaged during the first 3 years of O&M to confirm \ntheir functionality and transfer O&M skills to DWASA. A draft O&M plan was developed, describing \nstandard  operating  procedures  and  budget,  and  will  be  elaborated  during  implementation. \nDWASA\u2019s financial performance is projected to stay strong with its revenue to basically cover both \nthe O&M and capital costs (para. 22). It will be further enhanced by the efficiency improvements \nincluding  assets  automation  and  NRW  reduction.  The  project  will  support  environmental \nsustainability, by switching from ground water to surface water resources. ADB support for \nMeghna River protection is proposed in monitoring the quality of effluent into the river (para. 13).36 \n \nD.  Governance \n \n24.  Financial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  for \n \n32 The EOCC of 12.0% used for the ongoing project was also considered to compare the economic viability between \nthe overall and ongoing projects. The sensitivity analysis based on an EOCC of 12% showed the overall project to \nbe satisfactory only against an increase in O&M costs and delays in operation.   \n33 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 Project revenues were estimated based on the expected tariff increases and beneficiary population. For future tariff \nincreases, the average annual tariff increase (8.4%) for the last 10 years was considered.  \n35 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 ADB. 2020. Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh, 2021\u20132023. Manila. \n \n ", "9 \nDWASA  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines.37 It  found  that  DWASA  has  experience  in \nimplementing ADB-assisted projects including the ongoing project and has adequate financial \nmanagement capacity to (i) record the required financial transactions, (ii) provide reliable financial \nstatements and audit reports in a timely basis, and (iii) safeguard the financial assets. However, \nthe assessment concluded that the financial management risk is substantial because (i) new \naccounts staff lack experience in ADB requirements; (ii) there is scope to improve financial \nreporting; (iii) counterpart funding is insufficient; (iv)  internal audit function to cover all externally \nfinanced projects is insufficient; (v) fixed asset management is suboptimal at the entity level; and \n(vi) there have been a number of audit observations, some of which are long outstanding.38  \n \n25.  These risks will be mitigated by (i) an ongoing training to the accounts staff on financial \nreporting and audit requirements, (ii) improving the quality and comprehensiveness of annual and \nquarterly financial reporting, (iii) establishing a project audit reply and settlement committee to \nmonitor audit observations and ensure corrective actions are undertaken in a timely manner, and \n(iv) improving asset management practices and systems at the entity level. Moreover, the project \nwill maintain separate books of account in accordance with accounting standards acceptable to \nADB, and the detailed project financial statement will be audited annually by an independent \nauditor in accordance with auditing standards acceptable to ADB. \n \n26.  Procurement. All procurement of goods and works and consultant recruitment under the \nproject will adhere to the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The DBO \ncontract includes 3 years of O&M (para. 23), which enables private sector participation for \nsustainable O&M, and building the skills of DWASA staff. A merit point system will be adopted for \nthe evaluation of technical proposals of package 3.2, involving the relatively complex secondary \ndistribution line.39 These key aspects in the contracts is expected to contribute to value for money.  \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and DWASA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 23). Integrity due diligence was conducted.40 Integrity risks \nwere identified, arising from adverse media coverage and complaints relating to DWASA\u2019s \noperation and projects. Mitigation measures include continued monitoring by the project team of \nthe project from an integrity perspective, increased oversight during procurement, as well as \nstrengthened transparency of and publicity regarding DWASA\u2019s projects.41 \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n28.  Poverty and social. In Dhaka, people living in LICs generally lack legal access to water \nsupply and sanitation, and must depend on illegal water lines or water vendors, and pay higher \ncharges.  Under  the  ongoing  project,  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  have  been \norganized to make LIC residents eligible for legal water connections, either through legalization \nor  new  connections.  The  CBOs  have  been  responsible  for  payment  of  water  tariffs  and \nmaintenance of the community water points. Under the ADF grant, community toilets and bathing \n \n37 ADB. 2015.

Gender. The ADF grant (gender thematic pool) will enable DWASA to deepen and sustain \nthe gender impact of its operations, by committing to an enhanced gender equity strategy, in line \nwith the transformative gender agenda under SDG 5. An integrated approach to women\u2019s \nempowerment  will  be  pursued  by  (i)  enhancing  the  targets  for  women\u2019s  participation  and \nleadership in decision making, (ii) promoting targeted legal empowerment initiatives for women, \n(iii) engaging men and boys in women\u2019s empowerment, and (iv) supporting women\u2019s greater \nresilience to and preparedness for natural hazards and disasters. This integrated approach to \nwomen\u2019s empowerment presents prospects for replication in similar utilities and agencies in \nBangladesh  and  the  region.  More  specifically,  the  ADF  grant  will  (i)  support  DWASA\u2019s \ncommitment to (a) women\u2019s increased leadership (up to 40%) in executive bodies of CBOs and \n(b) women\u2019s increased membership (up to 50%) in CBOs; (ii) enable DWASA to act on its \ncommitment to sustained access to water supply and sanitation by women and vulnerable groups \nby promoting access to legal empowerment services;43 (iii) engage men and boys to address \ngender  stereotypes  and  discriminatory  practices  including  gender-based  violence,  through \nadvocacy and awareness; and (iv) enhance women\u2019s resilience to external shocks by developing \nemergency response plans informed by the gendered impact of COVID-19.  \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n30.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  classification  of  the \nadditional financing and implementation of the ongoing project is described in paras. 31\u201334, along \nwith the potential safeguard impacts under the additional financing.44 \n \n31.  Environmental safeguards (category B). The additional financing is category B for \nenvironment, based on the assessment that environmental impacts are site-specific, with few if \nany that are irreversible, while mitigation measures are mostly readily available. A draft initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) with an environmental management plan was prepared in line \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and government laws. Based on the IEE, no significant \nadverse environmental impacts are envisioned. No project site is located in a sensitive area, and \nany impacts during construction and O&M can be avoided and/or mitigated through measures in \nthe  environmental  management  plan.  Further,  an  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework (EARF) was prepared for components under the ADF grant that will be prepared after \nthe ADB Board of Directors approval, for which limited impacts are anticipated. The EARF \nprovides site selection criteria to ensure that environmental impacts are not significant. It will also \nguide DWASA in the environmental assessment and preparation of assessment documents for \nthis  infrastructure.  The  environmental  assessment  documents  shall  be  submitted  for  ADB \nclearance prior to the start of construction.  \n \n32.  The  package  under  the  new  scope  (package  3.2)  will  be  awarded  only  after  the \ncorresponding draft IEE is finalized.  Contracts under the  ADF grant will be awarded after \ncorresponding assessment reports are finalized based on the EARF. All statutory clearances and \nno objections will be obtained prior to start of construction. Capacity building and training for this \n \n42 To enhance awareness regarding water use, water quality, and public hygiene, public awareness campaign activities \nunder the ongoing project will continue under the additional financing, including those that address COVID-19. \n43 These initiatives include capacity building programs to support women\u2019s legal empowerment and the establishment \nof a network of community-based legal service providers for effective provision of legal literacy and aid services to \nwomen and vulnerable groups, in the area of rights with regard to water supply and sanitation, gender-based and \ndowry-related violence, inheritance and family laws, and child marriages. \n44 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n \n ", "11 \npackage will be included in the project\u2019s overall capacity building program.45 Grievances will be \nhandled following the project grievance redress mechanism in the PAM (footnote 23). DWASA \nwill prepare a semiannual environmental monitoring report for ADB review and disclosure. \n \n33.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  additional  financing  is  category  B  for \ninvoluntary resettlement, based on the assessment that the project would cause only temporary \neconomic impacts during civil works. No land acquisition or permanent and significant impacts \nare anticipated. A draft resettlement plan for package 3.2 for the secondary distribution line was \nprepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and the laws of Bangladesh.46 \nThe measures in the draft resettlement plan are adequate to deal with identified risks. The draft \nresettlement plan will form part of the contract documents, updated during finalization of detailed \ndesign and submitted to ADB for review. The draft and the updated resettlement plan will be \ndisclosed  to  project-affected  people  and  on  the  ADB  and  project  websites.  In  addition,  a \nresettlement framework was prepared for components of the project financed by the ADF grant \nthat will be prepared after Board approval. The civil works under the ADF grant are proposed to \nbe located on government land, with no acquisition of private land required; possible resettlement \nimpacts are therefore anticipated to be limited. The resettlement planning documents shall be \nsubmitted to ADB for clearance upon finalization of the sites and prior to the start of construction. \nThe resettlement framework will guide DWASA in preparing appropriate resettlement planning \ndocuments. DWASA has demonstrated the capacity to manage resettlement impacts. Project \nconsultants  will  further  support  DWASA  in  enhancing  such  capacity.  DWASA  will  prepare \ncombined semiannual social monitoring reports for ADB review and disclosure for the ongoing \nloan and additional financing. \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project is category C for indigenous peoples in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. No indigenous peoples impacts, involving \ndirect or indirect impacts to the dignity, human rights, livelihood systems or territories, or natural \nor cultural resources that are used, owned, occupied, or claimed by indigenous peoples as their \nancestral domain or asset are anticipated. None of the affected persons surveyed belongs to \ntribes, minor races, ethnic sects, and communities. 2011 census by the Bangladesh Bureau of \nStatistics does not report the presence of any tribes, minor races or ethnic sects and communities \nin the project area including potential area where ADF grant-funded infrastructure will be located. \n \nG.

The figure is added to indicate the project\u2019s contribution \nto OP 4.1. Continuous water supply means that the water supply service will be provided for 24 hours, 7 days a week. \nc  The target LICs will be identified during implementation. In the LICs, community toilets and bathing facilities with \nseparate male and female arrangements and appropriate fecal sludge management will be built. \nd  The water intake is designed to be climate change resilient with longer inlet pipes, higher ground level, and a more \nrobust structure to withstand river floods.  \ne  The WTP is designed to be climate change resilient with a higher ground level and extensive soil reinforcement to \nwithstand floods in the nearby river. \nf  The new indicator 1d refers to both treated water transmission mains and the primary distribution mains with distinct \nfunctions. The total length is also updated to add 3 km as a result of design adjustments during implementation. \ng  Output 2 supports rehabilitation of the existing network, the networks under output 1 will be newly built. \nh A part of the planned new and legalized connections in the project area have been provided through DWASA\u2019s own \ninitiative outside the project, and thus removed from the targets. The updated survey in the target area concluded \nthat the number of LICs and its population significantly reduced due to rapid urbanization in the area, and also due \nto employment losses related to COVID-19 pandemic. The area of output 2 is much smaller and has less LICs \ncompared to the areas of outputs 1 and 4. \ni  Stakeholder groups refer to religious leaders, teachers, youth, community groups, and other relevant social groups. \nj  Topics under the awareness raising campaign and activities will include gender-based violence, discrimination against \nwomen based on inheritance and family laws, child marriages, divorces, dowry-related violence, and discrimination \nagainst hijras (persons whose gender identity is neither male nor female) and differently abled, unpaid care work. \n \nContribution to the ADB Results Framework  \nThe expected values and methodological details for all OP indicators to which this operation will contribute results are \ndetailed in Contribution to Strategy 2030 Operational Priorities (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2).
