It will improve transport connectivity in \nNepal,  with  a  focus  on  providing  faster  and  better  access  to  social  services  and  economic \nopportunities. The project roads are also integral to the international and regional road network \nsystem that connects Nepal to India, and will facilitate closer trade integration and contribute to \nNepal\u2019s  export  competitiveness.  The  project  will  have  a  transformational  impact  by  facilitating \nnational and regional integration.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nIn  Nepal,  transportation  connectivity  is  one  of  the  country\u2019s  most  critical  bottlenecks  to \nreducing  poverty  and  sustaining  inclusive  economic  growth.  With  its  challenging  mountainous \nterrain, roads are the predominant mode of transport in the country, carrying 90% of passengers \nand goods. However, Nepal has the lowest road density among countries in South Asia (about \n14 km per 100 square kilometers and 0.9 km per 1,000 people), and the overall efficiency and \nreliability of the road network is poor.3 Consequently, high transport cost and poor connectivity \nlimit  access  to  opportunities  and  hinder  job  creation  and  delivery  of  services.  It  also  impedes \ntrade with neighboring countries as the cost of importing and exporting becomes much higher, \nand undermines development of competitive industries in Nepal, such as high-value agriculture, \nagro-processing, and manufacturing.4 Nepal needs to deliver on its economic potential and this \nrequires  significant  investment  in  road  improvements  to  ensure  faster  and  better  access  to \nsocial services, domestic and international markets, and employment opportunities. Accordingly, \nthe  government\u2019s  Fourteenth  Plan  (FY2017\u20132019)  will  be  prioritizing  the  development  of  the \ncountry's physical infrastructure to integrate with those of neighboring countries.5 \n \n4. \nIn  support  of  the government\u2019s  plan, the  proposed  project  will  rehabilitate  and  upgrade \ntwo critical sections of Nepal\u2019s strategic road network, which comprises the East\u2013West highway \n(115  km  Narayanghat\u2013Butwal  section)  and  its  feeder  road  (45  km  Bhairahawa\u2013Taulihawa \nsection).6 The East\u2013West highway is the main arterial road cutting across the entire width of the \ncountry in Terai area (southern lowland plains bordering India). The project influence area is at \nthe center of the East\u2013West highway, which is the most productive region in Nepal and supports \ngrowing industries in agriculture and related processing, services (education and health), trade, \nand  tourism.  Narayanghat  is  one  of  the  fast\u2013growing  cities  where  a  large  number  of  business \n\n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided a grant for preparing the feasibility and detailed design study.

Manila (Grant 0227-NEP). \n\n3  By comparison, regional figures in terms of kilometers per 1,000 people are as follows: Bhutan 6.5, Sri Lanka 4.7, \n\nIndia 3.0, and Bangladesh 1.9. \n\n4   Nepal\u2019s primary trading partner is India, which accounts for 60% of exports and 80% of imports. \n5   Government  of  Nepal,  National  Planning  Commission.  2016.  An  Approach  Paper  of  Fourteenth  Plan  (FY2017\u2013\n\n6   Nepal\u2019s strategic  road  network consists  of  12,494  km of  which  3,460  km is  national  highways  and the  remaining \n\n2019). Kathmandu. \n\nfeeder roads. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nand trading houses are based, and Bhairahawa is a major trading city located in the country\u2019s \nfirst  special  economic  zone  to  increase  trade  between  Nepal  and  India.  This  area  also \nencompasses the  Lumbini  Zone,  which  is  a  Buddhist  pilgrimage  site  and  was  accorded World \nHeritage  Site  status  by  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization \n(UNESCO). 7 Its  main  gateway,  the  Gautam  Buddha  Airport,  is  currently  being  upgraded  to \ninternational standards under Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing.8 \n \n5. \nThe  proposed  project  is integral  to  the government\u2019s Transport  Sector  Strategy  (2016\u2013\n2021)  with  a  focus  on  improving  the  country\u2019s  strategic  road  network  and  progressively \nexpanding the capacity of the East\u2013West highway and its feeder roads.9 The upgraded project \nroads will help ease growing traffic congestion and improve transport connectivity internally and \nwith  India.  It  will  bring  significant  advantages  to  the  overall  social  economic  development  and \nsupport  Nepal\u2019s  goal  to  graduate  from  the  status  of  least\u2013developed  country  to  a  developing \ncountry by year 2022. The proposed project is in line with the strategic objective of increasing \nconnectivity and access to basic services and markets, and promoting tourism as described in \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2013-2017.10 It  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations \nbusiness plan, 2016\u20132018 for Nepal.11   \n \n6. \nRegional  connectivity.  The  project  roads  are  integrated  with  an  international  and \nregional road network system that connects Nepal to the state of Uttar Pradesh in India.12 The \nmain  benefit  will  be  improved  connectivity  to  Bhairahawa  and  its  inland  clearance  depot  and \nland  custom  station,  a  transit  point  that  handles  a  substantial  volume  of  imports  and  exports \nbetween Nepal and India. This will complement ADB\u2019s ongoing assistance to the Department of \nCustoms,  which  include  reengineering  its  business  process  and  providing  equipment  and \ncapacity  development  to  modernize  customs  clearance  systems.  Collectively,  the  proposed \nproject  will  facilitate  increased  trade  with  India  and  other  countries  in  the  region,  such  as \nBangladesh, and help contribute to Nepal\u2019s export competitiveness. This is consistent with the \nobjectives of ADB\u2019s support for the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation.13 \n \n7. \nClimate  change  adaptation. The project roads are located in the tropical climate zone \nwith  moderately  high  rainfall,  80%  of  which  occurs  during  the  monsoon  months  (from  June  to \nSeptember). In anticipation of rainfall extremes, likely both in terms of intensity and frequency, \nroad  improvements  include  appropriate  adaptation  measures  in  terms  of  hydrology  and \ndrainage design. These include formation levels of the roads so that road embankments are not \ninundated  during  peak  flooding  in  the  area,  cross  drainage  requirements  to  ensure  adequate \nopenings through bridges and culverts, additional subsurface drainage structures and roadside \ndrains  to keep the roads free from  water  logging  during  heavy  rains,  and  protective  measures \nfor structures, which are vulnerable to river erosion. \n\n                                                 \n7   The  World  Heritage  List  includes  981  sites  that  are  considered  to  form  part  of  humankind\u2019s  cultural  and  natural \n\nheritage and to have outstanding universal value. \n\n8  ADB.  2009.

Road traffic accidents are rising in Nepal due to the increasing number of \n8. \nvehicles and unsafe road conditions. In response, the government has prepared a Road Safety \nAction Plan (2013\u20132020) with five pillars of road safety suggested in the United Nations Decade \nof Action for Road Safety 2011\u20132020, which comprises safer roads and road environment, safer \nusers,  safer  vehicles,  safer  speeds,  and  post-crash  response  management.14 In  keeping  with \nthis,  project  preparation  identified  potential  safety  issues  based  on  an  appraisal  of  the  roads, \nroad  sides,  and  the  existing  operating  environment;  and  an  assessment  of  likely  situations \nresulting  from  the  proposed  upgrading  of  the  project  roads.  This  led  to  the  adaptation  of \nappropriate measures, including service lanes to segregate slow-moving local traffic from fast-\nmoving through traffic, pedestrian-friendly features such as walkways on both sides of the roads \nin  settlement  areas,  disabled-friendly  pedestrian  crossings,  and  the  establishment  of  road \naccident emergency response systems at critical locations. \n \n9. \nSustainable  maintenance.  The  government  has  increased  the  annual  budget  for  the \nmaintenance  of  the  country\u2019s  strategic  road  network\u2014from  NRs2.601  billion  in  FY2013  to \nNRs3.693 billion in FY2015\u2014thanks to increasing revenue from fuel levies, vehicle registration \nfees,  and  tolls.  However,  while  the  budgetary  need  is  being  substantively  met,  the  actual \nutilization  has  not  kept  pace. 15  Therefore,  there  is  a  need  to  enhance  capacity  and \nimplementation  arrangements.  In  this  regard,  civil  works  contracts  for  the  project  roads  will \ninclude  post-completion  performance-based  maintenance  for  5  years.  It  aims  to  assess  the \nefficacy of adapting long-term performance-based maintenance by the private sector in Nepal, \nand encourage its use where appropriate. The possible benefits include better quality assurance \nand  greater  efficiency,  which  can  further  enable  the  prioritization  of  budget  allocation  for  road \nmaintenance.  ADB  is  providing  technical  assistance  to  the  Department  of  Roads  (DOR),  the \nimplementing  agency  of  the  proposed  project,  to  modernize  road  asset  management  and \nsupport the implementation of performance-based maintenance contracts.16 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe  impact  will  be  enhanced  transport  connectivity  within  Nepal  and  with  neighboring \ncountries,  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  Fourteenth  Plan  (FY2017\u20132019)  (footnote  5).  The \noutcome will be improved road transport system. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \nThe project will have the following outputs: (i) road network rehabilitated and upgraded, \nand (ii) road safety and maintenance improved. A total of 160 km of roads will be upgraded to \nfour lanes,17 with proper median and shoulders, safety features, and better climate resilience.18 \nPerformance-based  maintenance  included  in  works  contracts  will  be  undertaken  for  5  years \nafter  construction  to  ensure  better  asset  quality  and  improved  maintenance.19 The  project  will \n\n                                                 \n14  Government  of  Nepal,  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  &  Transport  Management.  2013.

The  principal \nbenefits considered in the analysis are (i) savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time, and \n(ii)  reduced  accidents  from  upgrading  the  roads  from  two  lanes  to  four  lanes.  The  estimated \neconomic internal rate of return is 17.1% for the Narayanghat\u2013Butwal section and 14.9% for the \nBhairahawa\u2013Lumbini\u2013Taulihawa section. The sensitivity analysis indicates that both roads have \nan economic internal rate of return above 12% even with adverse variation in costs and benefit \nstreams,  confirming  the  economic  viability  of  the  project.  In  addition  to  the  quantified  benefits, \nthe  project  will  bring  significant  advantages  to  the  overall  economic  development  by  ensuring \nsmooth traffic flow on the main transport corridors of Nepal.  \n \n18.  \nFinancial  sustainability. The budget allocation for strategic road network maintenance \nincreased  annually  since  2011,  meeting  100%  of  routine  and  70%  of  periodic  maintenance \nneeds  as  of  2015.  The  government  developed  a  5-year  Strategic  Road  Plan  (2016\u20132021)  to \nimprove funding for periodic maintenance to 100% and ensure sustainable funding (footnote 9). \nIt aims to construct new roads and repair major roads, which is expected to reduce maintenance \nneeds.  To  support \ninclude  performance-based \nmaintenance  in  civil  works  contracts  for  5  years  to  ensure  better  asset  quality  and  improved \nmaintenance. DOR\u2019s capacity on fund and asset management is being strengthened through an \nongoing ADB technical assistance (footnote 16).  \n \nC. \n\nfinancial  sustainability, \n\nthe  project  will \n\nGovernance \n\n19. \nInstitutional.  DOR,  the  implementing  agency,  was  established  in  1961  under  the \nMOPIT. DOR is responsible for the development and maintenance of the strategic road network, \nwhich  comprises  the  national  arterial  roads,  and  major  feeder  roads  connecting  to  local  and \nrural roads. DOR is headed by a director general who reports to the secretary of MOPIT. DOR \nis  experienced  in  implementing  ADB  projects.  DOR\u2019s  capacity  is  further  strengthened  by  a \nWorld  Bank  project23 and  an  ADB  project,24 which  includes  training  for  feasibility  studies  and \npractices in contract management and quality assurance. \n \n20. \nFinancial management. The project financial management risk is considered moderate. \nDOR has an adequate capacity in financial accounting and ADB disbursement procedures, with \na qualified chief project accountant and two assistant accountants. However, improvements are \nrequired  in  the  areas  of internal  audit,  manual  accounting  systems,  and staff understanding of \nADB policy and procedures. The project will engage a full-time financial expert stationed in the \nproject  implementation  unit  (PIU)  to  conduct  internal  checks  and  controls,  and  work  on  the \nintegration of project accounting with DOR\u2019s financial management information systems. \n \n21. \n Procurement  and  anticorruption.  Procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  government  promulgated \nthe  Public  Procurement Act (2007)  and  Public  Procurement  Regulations (2007),  both  of  which \nare generally acceptable to ADB and encompass best international procurement practices. The \nPublic Procurement Monitoring Office was assigned as the national procurement oversight body \nunder  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  Council  of  Ministers.  The  government  will  publish \nproject  information  on  DOR\u2019s  website,  including  business  opportunities  associated  with  the \nproject.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \n                                                 \n23 The World  Bank\u2019s support  focuses  on management  information  systems,  road  safety, safeguard  implementation, \n\nquality control, and human resources management. \n\n24 ADB. 2006.

The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 20). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n22. \nPoverty  reduction  and  social  impact.  The  project\u2019s  direct  area  of  influence  includes \n673,000 people living in 24 villages and municipalities crossed by the project roads. The poverty \nrate  in  the  project  area  is  18.0%,  which  is  below  the  national  average  of  25.2%.  The  major \nsources  of  income  are  trade  and  business  (18%),  remittances  (18%),  services  (11%),  rent \n(10%),  and  agricultural  produce  (8%).  Tourism  is  prominent  and  growing  in  the  project  area, \ngiven  that  the  roads  link  to  the  UNESCO  World  Heritage  site  of  Lumbini  and  the  Chitwan \nNational Park. The results of household surveys and focus group discussions conducted as part \nof  the  poverty  and  social  assessment  indicate  that  the  project  will  increase  economic  and \nemployment  opportunities.  The  project  will  generate  an  estimated  1,460,000  person-days  of \nemployment over the construction and maintenance periods. \n \nGender.  The  poverty  and  social  analysis  included  a  gender  assessment  based  on  the \n23. \nsocioeconomic  characteristics  of  2,634  women  and  consultations  with  139  women.  Overall, \nwomen  were  supportive  of  the  project  because  of  the  potential  access  to  economic \nopportunities  and  services.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  and  a \nGender  Action  Plan:  Gender  Equality  and  Social  Inclusion  (GESI)  Action  Plan  was  prepared, \nwhich includes the following activities: (i) integrate socially inclusive pedestrian design features, \nsuch  as  106 disabled-friendly  pedestrian  crossings,  41.7  km  of  walkways  on  both  sides  of  the \nroads,  28  km  of  service  lanes,  and  drainage  and  safety  features;  (ii)  train  women  living  in  the \nChitwan  National  Park  buffer  zone  in  income-generating  activities  and  community  forest \nmanagement; (iii) conduct training in leadership and team management for women members of \nthe  community  forest  user  groups;  (iv) target  at  least  30%  women  participation  in  the  tree \nplantation  program;  (v)  conduct  road  safety  awareness  campaigns  to  communities  along  the \n(pedestrians,  drivers,  parents, \ncorridor, \nschoolchildren,  and  professional  drivers,  with  targets  for  women  and  schoolgirls);  and \n(vi) conduct public awareness campaigns on preventive human trafficking to 2,000 communities, \nand  on  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually  transmitted  infections  to  500  communities.  GESI  experts  and \nfield staff will be hired to ensure the effective implementation of the GESI action plan. \n \n24. \nHIV  and  human  trafficking.  The National Centre for AIDS and STD Control under the \nMinistry  of  Health  and  Population  coordinates  activities  under  the  National  AIDS  Strategy, \n2006\u20132011,  which  emphasizes  prevention  as  the  most  effective  response.25 The  Ministry  of \nWomen,  Children,  and  Social  Welfare  coordinates  activities  to  counter  human  trafficking.  A \nlarge amount of information and print material on human trafficking has been developed with the \nsupport of the United States Agency for International Development, which will be reproduced for \nuse  in  project  areas.  The  project  incorporates  measures  to  mitigate  HIV  risks  and  counter \nhuman  trafficking  by  having  consultants  conduct  awareness  programs  in  the  corridors  of \ninfluence.  The  civil  works  contractors  will  carry  out  sexually  transmitted  infection  and  human \ntrafficking  awareness  sessions  for  their  laborers  at  work  sites,  which  will  be  monitored  by  the \nconstruction supervision consultant (CSC). \n \n\nto  3,000  community  members \n\nreaching  out \n\n                                                 \n25 Government of Nepal, National Centre for AIDS and STD Control. 2011.

Since 24 km of the Narayanghat\u2013Butwal road is adjacent to \nthe  buffer  zone  of  the  Chitwan  National  Park,  wildlife  cross  the  road  at  a  number  of  points. \nSpecies include the Bengal tiger (endangered) and greater one-horned rhinoceros (vulnerable), \nwhich  are  protected  under  the  National  Parks  and  Wildlife  Conservation  Act  of  Nepal.26 The \ndraft  environmental  impact  assessment  for  this  road  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  6 \nJune  2016.  The  Bhairahawa\u2013Lumbini\u2013Taulihawa  road  is  classified  category  B  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Though the road is located near the UNESCO \nWorld  Heritage  site  of  Lumbini,  the  Department  of  Archaeology  confirmed  that  the  project  will \nnot affect the site because the road will not be widened at the section passing near the site. An \ninitial  environmental  examination  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  22  August  2016. \nPotential  significant  impacts  of  the  Narayanghat\u2013Butwal  road  will  be  the  obstruction  of  wildlife \nmovement during construction and operation. To mitigate this risk, five animal underpasses will \nbe  constructed  and  a  biodiversity  conservation  plan  and  compensatory  afforestation  program \nwill  be  implemented  to  ensure  that  there  are  no  measurable  adverse  impacts,  no  net  loss  of \nbiodiversity, and all lesser impacts are mitigated.  \n \n26. \nOther  anticipated  impacts for  both  roads  involve  dust,  noise,  exhaust,  construction  and \ndomestic  waste,  water  contamination,  occupational  health  and  safety,  erosion,  siltation,  and \ntraffic  congestion  during  construction  and  air  pollution  and  road  safety  during  operation.  The \nenvironmental  management  plan  includes  measures  to  manage  these  impacts,  which  will  be \nmandatory  for  implementation  by  the  contractor.  Meaningful  consultations  were  held  with \naffected persons and key stakeholders such as the Department of National Parks and Wildlife \nConservation,  Chitwan  National  Park,  World  Wildlife  Fund  Nepal,  and  the  Department  of \nArchaeology.  The  project  will  include  recommendations  on  the  design  of  animal  underpasses \nand  biodiversity  conservation  activities.  The  environmental  impact  assessment\u2019s  grievance \nredress mechanism will alleviate concerns of affected persons and stakeholders during project \nimplementation. \n \n27. \nA  PIU  environmental  officer  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  the  implementation  of \nenvironment safeguards under the project. The CSC, comprising a team of environmental and \nwildlife  specialists,  will  support  the  PIU.  The  civil  works  contractor  will  be  required  to  have  a \nteam  of  environmental,  health,  and  safety  officers  to  ensure  proper  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental  management  plan.  An  external  monitor  will  be  recruited  to  conduct  third\u2013party \nmonitoring on the implementation of environment safeguards. \n  \n28. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  land  acquisition  and resettlement  impacts \nwere adequately assessed and the social due diligence confirms that impacts are moderate. A \ntotal of 49 households (271 persons) are expected to be affected, among which 32 households \n(189  persons)  will  be  significantly  affected  (i.e.,  physical  relocation;  household  losing  10%  or \nmore  of  its  land).  Most  of  the  structures  affected  are  commercial  (60%)  and  belong  to \nnon-titleholders.  The  project  is  expected  to  require  the  acquisition  of  minor  strips  of  land  (160 \nsquare meters), affecting 18 households, most of which will lose less than 10% of their plot.  \n \n29. \nThe \n\nResettlement plans for each road were disclosed on the ADB website on 28 July 2016.27 \nresettlement  assistance \nresettlement  plans  provide  mitigation  measures  and \n\n                                                 \n26  As classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. \n27 Resettlement  Plan:  Narayanghat\u2013Butwal  Road;  Resettlement  Plan:  Bhairahawa\u2013Lumbini\u2013Taulihawa  Road \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\ncommensurate  to  the  impacts  identified.  The  entitlement  matrix  includes  measures  to  ensure \ncompensations  at  replacement  cost,  shifting  and  reconstruction  assistance,  and  special \nmeasures  for  vulnerable  households  such  as  financial  assistance  and  participation  in  a  skills \ntraining  program.  DOR,  given  its  familiarity  with  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement  requirements, \nwill  implement  the  resettlement  plans.  An  individual  resettlement  consultant  will  support  the \nDOR in supervising resettlement activities, and a field-based resettlement team under the CSC \nwill  supervise  day-to-day  implementation.  A  capacity  building  workshop  on  land  acquisition, \nrehabilitation, and resettlement implementation for key DOR staff, the PIU, and the project site \noffices  will  be  conducted  at  the  onset  of  the  project.  Resettlement  and  social  impacts,  and \nmitigation measures were discussed with local residents.  \n \n30. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C). The  project will  improve  existing  corridors and thus \nwill not have any impact on the culture, human rights, or livelihood systems. No tribal, ancestral, \nor customary land exists in the project areas. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31. \nThe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.
