THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Northern Smallholder Livestock \nCommercialization Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will support the ongoing transition of smallholder livestock farming from \nsubsistence to be commercialized and integrated into livestock value chains (LVCs) to meet \ndomestic and increasing international market demands for good quality Lao meat products.2 It \nwill be implemented in 12 districts of the four northern provinces of Houaphanh, Luang Namtha, \nLuang Prabang, and Xiengkhouang, which remain among the poorest provinces in the Lao \nPDR.3  The  project  will  improve  selected  LVCs  to  meet  recognized  industry  standards  for \nproduction, live animal handling, slaughtering, processing, and vending. The higher standards \nwill improve domestic public health by providing safe meat products for domestic consumption, \nopen  export  opportunities,  and  enhance  the  humane  treatment  of  the  animals.  Incomes \nthroughout the LVCs will be raised by more efficient meat production and processing to respond \nto expanding demand\u2014domestic and export. The livestock and meat production industry will be \nput  on  a  sustainable  growth  path  through  the  dissemination  of  technical  and  business \nknowledge and skills, as well as improved access to credit throughout the LVC, along with \nsupport for enabling regulatory reforms. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  In 2013, agriculture and natural resources contributed 24% of gross domestic product \nand 65% of employment; livestock and fish comprised 10%. Agriculture is dominated by rice \nproduction on about 61% of land under cultivation. Of the total Lao population of 6.2 million, \nabout 69% reside in rural areas, more than 50% are smallholder subsistence farmers with \nincomes below $300 per year, and only about 30% are fully food secure.4 While women are \nactive in agriculture and natural resource activities and account for 54% of the workforce, \ngender gaps exist in extension services, market information, and financial services. \n \n4.  The  livestock  subsector  is  an  important  source  of  income  and  store  of  wealth  for \nsmallholders, with 89% owning one or more types of animals. Smallholders raise more than \n95% of all livestock; a few commercial pig and poultry enterprises are located near major urban \nmarkets. Large ruminant livestock production in smallholder farming systems is increasingly \nimportant, especially in upland terrain where the project is located, and provides a multitude of \nfunctions such as meat for sale or consumption, storage of wealth, fertilizer for crops, and \ndraught power for transport and cultivation.  \n \n5.  Annual domestic meat demand is rising at 5% and is forecast to increase strongly over \nthe next decade. The government has set a target to increase meat production from about \n210,000 tons per year in 2012 to 365,000 tons by 2020.5 Currently the country produces \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Preparing the Northern Smallholder   \nLivestock Commercialization Project. Manila.  \n3  The project will be carried out in Houaphanh\u2019s Aed, Viengxay, and Xiengkhor districts; Luang Namtha\u2019s Nalae, \nSing,  Viengkham,  and  Viengphoukha  districts;  Luang  Prabang\u2019s  Phonexay  and  Phoukhuon  districts;  and \nXiengkhouang\u2019s Khoun, Nonghet, and Phaxay districts.  \n4  Smallholder refers to a farming family household; in the project area, the average size is six people. \n5  W. Stur and P. Phengsavanh. 2014. Lessons Learnt from the LDP and Assessment of Livestock Value Chains in \nNorthern Lao PDR. Vientiane: International Fund for Agricultural Development. ", "2   \napproximately 63% of total domestic meat consumption. In the domestic market, beef and pork \naccount for around 80% of meat consumed, with prices increasing rapidly given the disparity \nbetween supply and demand.6 Presently, smallholders have no difficulty selling their livestock, \nhowever, traders are unable to source enough animals within the country to supply urban \nmarkets and increasingly they find that sourcing supplies from Thailand is easier. If this trend \ncontinues, smallholders will be at risk of being excluded from supplying urban markets. \n \n6.  Prices tend to be higher across the borders, where 25% of total cattle produced in the \nLao PDR are informally exported. Available information suggests current exports are less than \n10% of potential demand. Informal trade results in increases in disease spread, while reducing \nprices and profits to smallholders and traders, as well as government revenues. The ASEAN \n(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Economic Community, planned for 2015, is set to \nsimplify trade among members and is likely to lead to greater economic potential for the Lao \nPDR, as it is strategically located in the center of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). To fully \nbenefit from the ASEAN Economic Community, and to be competitive in it, the Lao PDR must \novercome  several  challenges,  including  (i)  limited  producer  capacity,  (ii)  low  quality  feed,  \n(iii)  poor  animal  husbandry,  (iv)  fragmented  market  infrastructure  with  limited  processing \nfacilities, (v) lack of credit and services, (vi) lack of product standards and enabling regulations \nfor domestic and export trade, and (vii) information failures along the supply chains. Moreover, \nthere is shortage of veterinarians, animal husbandry technicians, and qualified meat processors. \n \n7.  Weak LVCs hamper the potential of livestock production to reduce poverty offered by \ngrowing domestic and export market demand. The entire LVC, including the slaughtering of \nanimals for human consumption, is essentially unregulated. Slaughtering usually is done on \nsimple slabs within urban and peri-urban areas. Butchers, except for a few (usually foreign) \ncatering to an elite market, are untrained. The animals face an undignified and traumatic end. \nThe meat is rarely tested and its quality is reduced under existing conditions. Waste from the \nslaughtering process is released untreated into the environment. Food safety and its impact on \npublic health is a major concern. In response, the government recently issued the Law on Food \n(2013), requiring hazard analysis and critical control point compliance for food safety systems. \n \n8.  The project provinces have a combined population of 1,106,502 and a total area of \n1,235,237 hectares; more than 38% of the districts are classified as poor. Due to the upland \nterrain, livestock production is one of the few ways to earn agricultural income; it provides about \n50%  of  smallholder  annual  cash  income.7  An  assessment  of  the  potential  of  districts  for \nlivestock commercialization resulted in 12 being selected for inclusion in the project (footnote 3). \n \n9.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  sector  development  objectives  as \npresented in its Seventh National Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2011\u20132015, Strategy for \nAgricultural Development 2020, and Agricultural Master Plan, 2011\u20132015, which promote the \nexpansion of market-oriented agricultural production in an environmentally sensitive manner. It \nis consistent with the government\u2019s objectives to improve food safety and public health. \n \n10.  The  project  is  aligned  with  (i)  the  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  which  emphasizes  food  security,  agricultural  productivity,  and \ninclusive  agribusiness  development  connecting  farmers  to  local  and  global  food  markets;8        \n                                                \n6  For example, in Luang Prabang city, the price of beef increased by 40% from 2010 to 2013.  \n7  ADB.  2005.

The  project  builds  upon  ongoing  and  past  projects  including  the  Smallholder \nDevelopment Project, the Nam Ngum River Basin Development Sector Project, the Sustainable \nNatural  Resource  Management  and  Productivity  Enhancement  Project,12  and  the  Northern \nRegion Sustainable Livelihoods through Livestock Development Project (LDP),13 cofinanced by \nthe International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).14 In the project provinces, the LDP \nprovided technically sound extension of approximately 1,600 production groups with about eight \nsmallholders each. Key successes were (i) significant increases in smallholder incomes,15 (ii) an \neconomic internal rate of return estimated at 15.7%, (iii) smallholder investments in livestock \nexpected to yield financial internal rates of return of up to 60% (cattle) over 20 years, and  \n(iv) creation of momentum toward a long-term process of modernizing and commercializing \nsmallholder livestock production, and providing a foundation for the proposed project.  \n \n12.  Since 1979, ADB and IFAD cooperation in Lao PDR agriculture and rural development \nprojects  has  been  highly  effective.  This  will  continue  with  the  project  through  parallel \ncollaborative cofinancing. ADB and IFAD designed the project together capturing lessons from \nproject and sector experience, including the need to (i) holistically link production, knowledge, \ninfrastructure, and credit within the LVC; (ii) allow ample time for smallholders to accept new \npractices; (iii) use participatory stakeholder approaches; (iv) strengthen technical and business \ncapacity  of  smallholder  livestock  production  and  marketing  groups  (SLPMGs);  \n(v) strengthen the link between formal education and actual practice; (vi) improve extension \ncapacity of government and the private sector; (vii) avoid overly ambitious project targets;  \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2012.

The project has innovations that highlight ADB\u2019s value addition. This will be the first \ninvestment project to address the need for quality certification through the LVC in the Lao PDR. \nIt will make use of the pioneering experience in the coffee industry where certified value chains \nwere developed and Lao coffee is now increasingly being exported. It will cooperate with ADB\u2019s \nSecond  Private  Sector  and  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises  Development  Program \n(Subprogram 2) to test public\u2013private partnerships in agriculture.17  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact of the project will be increased incomes for smallholder livestock producers \nin the project areas. Its outcome will be increased livestock sales from sustainable smallholder \nproduction in the project areas. \n \nC.  Outputs \n15.  Focusing on cattle, pig, and goat LVCs, the project will have four outputs.  \n \n16.  Output 1: Strengthened capacities of smallholders and other livestock value chain \nactors. Activities to strengthen the LVC production and technical skill base include (i) organizing \nand technical training of SLPMGs in good agriculture practice;  (ii) providing training for LVC \nparticipants, including private sector input providers, traders, and butchers to improve meat \nquality, control transboundary animal diseases, improve sanitation, and develop food safety \nstandards; (iii) providing LVC and investment environment enhancing policy and regulatory \nsupport; and (iv) improving the Northern Agriculture and Forestry College curricula and good \npractice in animal butchering, and providing opportunities for scholarship and intern experience.  \n \n17.  Output  2:  Livestock  value  chain  infrastructure  strengthened.  Activities  include \nassisting SLPMGs to obtain needed equipment and materials to improve production; and, for \ndemonstration and training purposes, construct or improve slaughtering and meat processing \nfacilities and provincial and district wet markets.  \n \n18.  Output 3: Capacity to access credit improved. Activities include providing SLPMGs \nbusiness training for commercial livestock operations including basic bookkeeping, marketing, \nand contract farming; and the preparation of group and individual business plans. The business \nplans will enhance access to credit from any source.  \n \n19.  Output  4:  Project  management  enhanced.  Activities  include  building  counterpart \ncapacity  to  ensure  that  financial  management  and  procurement,  civil  works  design  and \nsupervision, environmental and social safeguards monitoring, and operation and maintenance \nplans for project facilities are compliant with ADB, IFAD, and government requirements.  \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2013.

As  chair  of  a  provincial  interagency  steering  committee,  one  vice-governor  will  be \nresponsible for coordination in each province. The provincial agriculture and forestry offices of \nthe project provinces will be the implementing agencies, with responsibility for reporting to the \nprovincial  vice-governor and the NPMO. Each  provincial agriculture and forestry office will \nestablish  a  provincial  implementation  unit  (PIU)  to  provide  day-to-day  support  for  project \nimplementation and facilitate inputs from relevant provincial line departments for activity design \nand implementation. A provincial project coordinator from the provincial agriculture and forestry \noffices and a full-time deputy coordinator will manage the PIUs. Each PIU, with the assistance \nof the district implementation unit, will ensure that consultation actions are carried out with \nprovincial and district stakeholder agencies and village authorities. Meetings will be arranged \nwith smallholders, village leaders, poor households, and private livestock traders to identify \n                                                \n20  ADB will finance civil works and equipment, vehicles for the national project management office (NPMO), \nconsulting services, stakeholder consultations, NPMO implementation costs, incremental project management \nstaff, and all project operation costs.

Individual consultants will be recruited to assist with  the early start-up stage. Loan \nimplementation  consultants  will  be  recruited  to  supplement  technical  and  implementation \ncapacity  constraints  during  project  implementation.  MAF  has  considerable  experience  in \nprocuring  civil  works  and  goods  and  services  under  ADB  projects.  All  procurement  and \nrecruitment of consultants to be financed by the ADB loan will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time).  The government\u2019s public procurement \nlegislation  and  regulations  (as  acceptable  to  ADB)  will  be  applied  for  packages  below \ninternational competitive bidding thresholds for goods and works, which will be procured using \nnational competitive bidding, subject to modifications listed in the national competitive bidding \nannex. IFAD will administer its contribution, which will be available in 2016. A detailed division of \nthe  project  components  financed  by  ADB  and  IFAD  is  provided  in  the  PAM.  Consultant \nrecruitment for the IFAD-financed components will be guided by IFAD\u2019s procurement guidelines. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n28.  The technology issues relate to animal husbandry, slaughterhouses, meat processing, \nand wet market design and operation. The challenges will be (i) technology transfer to ethnic \ngroups living in remote areas with lower education, (ii) limited private sector capacity to provide \n ", "8   \ninput supplies, and (iii) weak regulatory environment throughout the LVC. The project will utilize \ntraining materials developed by the LDP and other prior ADB or IFAD projects; encourage and \nfacilitate private sector expansion of input supply chains, especially vaccines; and support policy \nreforms that encourage adoption of appropriate technologies by LVC participants. \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n29.  The economic viability assessment quantified the gain in combined value added to \nlivestock  by  the  target  SLPMG  households  plus  other  households  (a  total  of  9,000).  The \nproject\u2019s economic internal rate of return is estimated at 15%.23 Sensitivity analysis shows that \nthe project\u2019s economic viability is highly sensitive to the price of fattened cattle but is reasonably \nrobust with respect to the adoption rate assumptions and project costs. The slaughterhouse and \nwet market investments are expected to bring unquantified sector benefits in improved food \nsafety, public health, and urban environment through the development of institutional capacity \nfor regulatory enforcement and proposed actions to address market failure to supply meat \nprocessed in accordance with appropriate food safety standards. Projected financial statements \nfor infrastructure indicate the investments will be financially sustainable. \nC.   Governance \n30.  The  project  financial  management  arrangements  are  adequate.  The  financial \nmanagement assessment indicates that MAF is capable of undertaking financial management \nof the project.24 The NPMO will ensure the detailed consolidated project financial statements are \naudited by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB in accordance with international auditing \nstandards and the government's audit regulations. MAF will submit the audited project financial \nstatements in English to ADB within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year. The national financial \nmanagement  specialist,  an  individual  consultant,  will  be  responsible  for  developing  and \nstrengthening NPMO and PIU staff capacity in financial management procedures to facilitate \nefficient operation of imprest and subaccounts, and reporting of the financial management of the \nproject to the government, ADB, and IFAD. The project will establish a website to disclose \nimplementation  progress  and  bid  notifications  and  their  results,  and  provide  a  grievance \nmechanism for corrupt practices.  \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MAF. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \nD.  Poverty and Social \n32.   Poorer segments of the community will benefit from the project through: (i) employment \ngenerated by expanded LVC commercial operations; (ii) training and credit to increase their \nparticipation in the SLPMGs and LVCs; (iii) scholarship awards; and (iv) participatory land use \nplanning that helps to preserve areas that are useful for them. The impact for women is \npotentially greater than for men, considering the greater labor inputs they provide in animal \nhusbandry  and  marketing. The  project  is  categorized  effective gender  mainstreaming. The \nproject  gender  action  plan  integrates  the  participation  of  women  into  the  project  by  their \ninclusion: (i) in SLPMGs and their committees; (ii) in all project-supported training; (iii) in on farm \ndemonstrations; (iv) as trained agricultural extension workers; (v) in production contracts with \nagribusinesses; (vi) as trained market vendors. The project will report sex-disaggregated data. \n \n                                                \n23  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24  Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "   9 \nE.  Safeguards \n33.  Environment  (category  B).  Improvements  in  meat  production,  slaughtering, \nprocessing, and vending practices and infrastructure will have positive environmental impacts. \nAdditional  training  will  be  provided  for  NPMO  and  provincial  project  management  office \nsafeguard staff. The environmental assessment and review framework and list of responsibilities \nfor environmental management are in the PAM to guide the government in carrying out an \nappropriate  environmental  assessment  and  taking  corresponding  measures  to  deal  with \npotential environmental impacts.25 Environmental management plans will be prepared during \nproject implementation when specific sites and designs are refined and confirmed. \n \n34.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). LVC infrastructure may require small parcels of \nland that may affect some crops and structures but will not result in significant resettlement \nimpacts. Interventions that would fall under category A will not be included in the project. The \ngovernment and ADB have agreed on a resettlement framework that guides screening for \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts and sets out procedures, resources, and responsibilities for \npreparing resettlement plans for potential category B activities.26 Resettlement plans will be \nprepared  during  project  implementation  when  specific  sites  and  designs  are  refined  and \nconfirmed. Any required resettlement plans will be submitted to, and approved and monitored \nby, ADB before the selected activities are implemented. Compensation, allowances, operation \nand administration costs, surveys, monitoring, and reporting will be financed from the loan \nproceeds. An adequate budget for resettlement plan preparation and implementation will be \nallocated accordingly as well as provision of resettlement specialists.  \n  \n35.  Ethnic groups (category B). Project activities will not cause involuntary changes in \nethnic  groups\u2019  livelihood  systems,  cultural  practices,  ancestral  domains,  food  production \npractices, or cultural cohesion; or unwanted dependence on external market forces. They will \nnot lead to exclusion of any ethnic group.27 Possible negative impacts will be avoided if possible \nor will be compensated accordingly. Impacts are expected to be overwhelmingly positive since \nactivities  are  for  the  economic  and  social  improvement  of  the  total  population.  Specific \nmeasures  to  deal  with  potential  negative  impacts  and  to  encourage  participation  and \ncontribution of ethnic groups require customized approaches and interventions. An ethnic group \ndevelopment framework agreed upon by the government and ADB was prepared and resources \nallocated for its implementation to guide the preparation of an ethnic group plan for potential \ncategory B subprojects based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). 28 The executing \nand implementing agencies are experienced in carrying out such plans. No plans were prepared \nduring  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  as  specific  project  sites  had  not  been \nconfirmed. ADB will approve and monitor the plans before a subproject is implemented.  \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n36.  The project\u2019s integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major \nrisks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.29 \n                                                \n25  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26  Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n27  Lao, Khmou, and Hmong are the major indigenous peoples in the project area and fall under ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  description  of  indigenous  peoples.  \u201cEthnic  group\u201d  is  the  government\u2019s  preferred  term  for \nindigenous peoples (Constitution of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, 2003, article 8). \n28  Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework: Ethnic Group Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n29  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nPublic Financial Management:  A framework of procedural requirements is set out in the PAM, reporting, and \nWeak public financial management  auditing requirements.
