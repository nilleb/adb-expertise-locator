The  higher  standards \nwill improve domestic public health by providing safe meat products for domestic consumption, \nopen  export  opportunities,  and  enhance  the  humane  treatment  of  the  animals.  Incomes \nthroughout the LVCs will be raised by more efficient meat production and processing to respond \nto expanding demand\u2014domestic and export. The livestock and meat production industry will be \nput  on  a  sustainable  growth  path  through  the  dissemination  of  technical  and  business \nknowledge  and  skills,  as  well  as  improved  access  to  credit  throughout  the  LVC,  along  with \nsupport for enabling regulatory reforms. \n \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nIn  2013,  agriculture  and  natural  resources  contributed  24%  of  gross  domestic  product \nand  65%  of  employment;  livestock  and  fish  comprised  10%.  Agriculture  is  dominated  by  rice \nproduction  on  about  61%  of  land  under  cultivation.  Of  the  total  Lao  population  of  6.2  million, \nabout  69%  reside  in  rural  areas,  more  than  50%  are  smallholder  subsistence  farmers  with \nincomes  below  $300  per  year,  and  only  about  30%  are  fully  food  secure.4  While  women  are \nactive  in  agriculture  and  natural  resource  activities  and  account  for  54%  of  the  workforce, \ngender gaps exist in extension services, market information, and financial services. \n \n4. \nThe  livestock  subsector  is  an  important  source  of  income  and  store  of  wealth  for \nsmallholders,  with  89%  owning  one  or  more  types  of  animals.  Smallholders  raise  more  than \n95% of all livestock; a few commercial pig and poultry enterprises are located near major urban \nmarkets.  Large  ruminant  livestock  production  in  smallholder  farming  systems  is  increasingly \nimportant, especially in upland terrain where the project is located, and provides a multitude of \nfunctions  such  as  meat  for  sale  or  consumption,  storage  of  wealth,  fertilizer  for  crops,  and \ndraught power for transport and cultivation.  \n \n5. \nAnnual domestic meat demand is rising at 5% and is forecast to increase strongly over \nthe  next  decade.  The  government  has  set  a  target  to  increase  meat  production  from  about \n210,000  tons  per  year  in  2012  to  365,000  tons  by  2020.5  Currently  the  country  produces \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Preparing the Northern Smallholder   \n\nLivestock Commercialization Project. Manila.  \n\n3  The  project  will  be  carried  out  in  Houaphanh\u2019s  Aed,  Viengxay,  and  Xiengkhor  districts;  Luang  Namtha\u2019s  Nalae, \nSing,  Viengkham,  and  Viengphoukha  districts;  Luang  Prabang\u2019s  Phonexay  and  Phoukhuon  districts;  and \nXiengkhouang\u2019s Khoun, Nonghet, and Phaxay districts.  \n\n4   Smallholder refers to a farming family household; in the project area, the average size is six people. \n5   W. Stur and P. Phengsavanh. 2014. Lessons Learnt from the LDP and Assessment of Livestock Value Chains in \n\nNorthern Lao PDR. Vientiane: International Fund for Agricultural Development. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\napproximately 63% of total domestic meat consumption. In the domestic market, beef and pork \naccount  for  around  80%  of  meat  consumed,  with  prices  increasing  rapidly  given  the  disparity \nbetween supply and demand.6 Presently, smallholders have no difficulty selling their livestock, \nhowever,  traders  are  unable  to  source  enough  animals  within  the  country  to  supply  urban \nmarkets  and  increasingly  they  find  that  sourcing  supplies from  Thailand  is  easier.  If  this  trend \ncontinues, smallholders will be at risk of being excluded from supplying urban markets. \n \n6. \nPrices tend to be higher across the borders, where 25% of total cattle produced in  the \nLao PDR are informally exported. Available information suggests current exports are less than \n10% of potential demand. Informal trade results in increases in disease spread, while reducing \nprices  and  profits  to  smallholders  and  traders,  as  well  as  government  revenues.  The  ASEAN \n(Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations)  Economic  Community,  planned  for  2015,  is  set  to \nsimplify  trade  among  members  and  is  likely  to  lead  to  greater  economic  potential  for  the  Lao \nPDR, as it is strategically located in the center of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). To fully \nbenefit from the ASEAN Economic Community, and to be competitive in it, the Lao PDR must \novercome  several  challenges,  including  (i)  limited  producer  capacity,  (ii)  low  quality  feed,  \n(iii)  poor  animal  husbandry,  (iv)  fragmented  market  infrastructure  with  limited  processing \nfacilities, (v) lack of credit and services, (vi) lack of product standards and enabling regulations \nfor domestic and export trade, and (vii) information failures along the supply chains. Moreover, \nthere is shortage of veterinarians, animal husbandry technicians, and qualified meat processors. \n \n7. \nWeak  LVCs  hamper  the  potential  of  livestock  production  to  reduce  poverty  offered  by \ngrowing  domestic  and  export  market  demand.  The  entire  LVC,  including  the  slaughtering  of \nanimals  for  human  consumption,  is  essentially  unregulated.  Slaughtering  usually  is  done  on \nsimple  slabs  within  urban  and  peri-urban  areas.  Butchers,  except  for  a  few  (usually  foreign) \ncatering to an elite market, are untrained. The animals face an undignified and traumatic end. \nThe  meat  is  rarely  tested  and its  quality  is  reduced  under  existing  conditions. Waste from  the \nslaughtering process is released untreated into the environment. Food safety and its impact on \npublic health is a major concern. In response, the government recently issued the Law on Food \n(2013), requiring hazard analysis and critical control point compliance for food safety systems. \n \n8. \nThe  project  provinces  have  a  combined  population  of  1,106,502  and  a  total  area  of \n1,235,237  hectares;  more  than  38%  of  the  districts  are  classified  as  poor.  Due  to  the  upland \nterrain, livestock production is one of the few ways to earn agricultural income; it provides about \n50%  of  smallholder  annual  cash  income.7  An  assessment  of  the  potential  of  districts  for \nlivestock commercialization resulted in 12 being selected for inclusion in the project (footnote 3). \n \n9. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  sector  development  objectives  as \npresented in its  Seventh  National  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  Strategy  for \nAgricultural  Development  2020,  and  Agricultural  Master  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  which  promote  the \nexpansion of market-oriented agricultural production in an environmentally sensitive manner. It \nis consistent with the government\u2019s objectives to improve food safety and public health. \n \n10. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  (i)  the  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  which  emphasizes  food  security,  agricultural  productivity,  and \ninclusive  agribusiness  development  connecting  farmers  to  local  and  global  food  markets;8        \n\n                                                \n6   For example, in Luang Prabang city, the price of beef increased by 40% from 2010 to 2013.  \n7   ADB.  2005.

Key successes were (i) significant increases in smallholder incomes,15 (ii) an \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  estimated  at  15.7%,  (iii)  smallholder  investments  in  livestock \nexpected  to  yield  financial  internal  rates  of  return  of  up  to  60%  (cattle)  over  20  years,  and  \n(iv)  creation  of  momentum  toward  a  long-term  process  of  modernizing  and  commercializing \nsmallholder livestock production, and providing a foundation for the proposed project.  \n \nSince 1979, ADB and IFAD cooperation in Lao PDR agriculture and rural development \n12. \nprojects  has  been  highly  effective.  This  will  continue  with  the  project  through  parallel \ncollaborative cofinancing. ADB and IFAD designed the project together capturing lessons from \nproject  and sector  experience,  including  the  need  to (i)  holistically  link  production, knowledge, \ninfrastructure,  and  credit  within  the  LVC;  (ii)  allow  ample  time  for  smallholders  to  accept  new \npractices; (iii) use participatory stakeholder approaches; (iv) strengthen technical and business \ncapacity  of \n(SLPMGs);  \n(v)  strengthen  the  link  between  formal  education  and  actual  practice;  (vi)  improve  extension \ncapacity  of  government  and  the  private  sector;  (vii)  avoid  overly  ambitious  project  targets;  \n                                                \n9   ADB. 2012.

The provincial agriculture and forestry offices of \nthe project provinces will be the implementing agencies, with responsibility for reporting to the \nprovincial  vice-governor  and  the  NPMO.  Each  provincial  agriculture  and  forestry  office  will \nestablish  a  provincial  implementation  unit  (PIU)  to  provide  day-to-day  support  for  project \nimplementation and facilitate inputs from relevant provincial line departments for activity design \nand implementation. A provincial project coordinator from the provincial agriculture and forestry \noffices and a full-time deputy coordinator will manage the PIUs. Each PIU, with the assistance \nof  the  district  implementation  unit,  will  ensure  that  consultation  actions  are  carried  out  with \nprovincial  and  district  stakeholder  agencies  and  village  authorities.

MAF  has  considerable  experience  in \nprocuring  civil  works  and  goods  and  services  under  ADB  projects.  All  procurement  and \nrecruitment  of  consultants  to  be  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  government\u2019s  public  procurement \nlegislation  and  regulations  (as  acceptable  to  ADB)  will  be  applied  for  packages  below \ninternational competitive bidding thresholds for goods and works, which will be procured using \nnational  competitive  bidding,  subject  to  modifications  listed  in  the  national  competitive  bidding \nannex.

The  challenges  will  be  (i)  technology  transfer  to  ethnic \ngroups living in remote areas with lower education, (ii) limited private sector capacity to provide \n\n   7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ninput supplies, and (iii) weak regulatory environment throughout the LVC. The project will utilize \ntraining materials developed by the LDP and other prior ADB or IFAD projects; encourage and \nfacilitate private sector expansion of input supply chains, especially vaccines; and support policy \nreforms that encourage adoption of appropriate technologies by LVC participants. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\n29. \nThe  economic  viability  assessment  quantified  the  gain  in  combined  value  added  to \nlivestock  by  the  target  SLPMG  households  plus  other  households  (a  total  of  9,000).  The \nproject\u2019s economic internal rate of return is estimated at 15%.23 Sensitivity analysis shows that \nthe project\u2019s economic viability is highly sensitive to the price of fattened cattle but is reasonably \nrobust with respect to the adoption rate assumptions and project costs. The slaughterhouse and \nwet  market  investments  are  expected  to  bring  unquantified  sector  benefits  in  improved  food \nsafety,  public  health,  and urban environment  through the  development  of  institutional  capacity \nfor  regulatory  enforcement  and  proposed  actions  to  address  market  failure  to  supply  meat \nprocessed in accordance with appropriate food safety standards. Projected financial statements \nfor infrastructure indicate the investments will be financially sustainable. \n\nC.  \n\nGovernance \n\nThe  project \n\nfinancial  management  arrangements  are  adequate.  The \n\n30. \nfinancial \nmanagement  assessment  indicates  that  MAF is  capable of  undertaking financial  management \nof the project.24 The NPMO will ensure the detailed consolidated project financial statements are \naudited by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB in accordance with international auditing \nstandards and the government's audit regulations. MAF will submit the audited project financial \nstatements in English to ADB within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year. The national financial \nmanagement  specialist,  an  individual  consultant,  will  be  responsible  for  developing  and \nstrengthening  NPMO  and  PIU  staff  capacity  in  financial  management  procedures  to  facilitate \nefficient operation of imprest and subaccounts, and reporting of the financial management of the \nproject  to  the  government,  ADB,  and  IFAD.  The  project  will  establish  a  website  to  disclose \nimplementation  progress  and  bid  notifications  and  their  results,  and  provide  a  grievance \nmechanism for corrupt practices.  \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n31. \nwith the government and MAF. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n32. \n Poorer segments of the community will benefit from the project through: (i) employment \ngenerated  by  expanded  LVC  commercial  operations;  (ii)  training  and  credit  to  increase  their \nparticipation in the SLPMGs and LVCs; (iii) scholarship awards; and (iv) participatory land use \nplanning  that  helps  to  preserve  areas  that  are  useful  for  them.  The  impact  for  women  is \npotentially  greater  than  for  men,  considering  the  greater  labor  inputs  they  provide  in  animal \nhusbandry  and  marketing.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The \nproject  gender  action  plan  integrates  the  participation  of  women  into  the  project  by  their \ninclusion: (i) in SLPMGs and their committees; (ii) in all project-supported training; (iii) in on farm \ndemonstrations;  (iv)  as  trained  agricultural  extension  workers;  (v)  in  production  contracts  with \nagribusinesses; (vi) as trained market vendors. The project will report sex-disaggregated data. \n \n\n                                                \n23  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24  Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment \n\n(category  B). \n\n33. \nin  meat  production,  slaughtering, \nImprovements \nprocessing,  and  vending  practices and  infrastructure  will  have positive environmental  impacts. \nAdditional  training  will  be  provided  for  NPMO  and  provincial  project  management  office \nsafeguard staff. The environmental assessment and review framework and list of responsibilities \nfor  environmental  management  are  in  the  PAM  to  guide  the  government  in  carrying  out  an \nappropriate  environmental  assessment  and  taking  corresponding  measures  to  deal  with \npotential  environmental  impacts.25  Environmental  management  plans  will  be  prepared  during \nproject implementation when specific sites and designs are refined and confirmed. \n \n34. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). LVC infrastructure may require small parcels of \nland  that  may  affect  some  crops  and  structures  but  will  not  result  in  significant  resettlement \nimpacts.  Interventions that  would fall  under  category  A  will  not  be  included  in the  project. The \ngovernment  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  a  resettlement  framework  that  guides  screening  for \ninvoluntary  resettlement  impacts  and  sets  out  procedures,  resources,  and  responsibilities  for \npreparing  resettlement  plans  for  potential  category  B  activities.26  Resettlement  plans  will  be \nprepared  during  project  implementation  when  specific  sites  and  designs  are  refined  and \nconfirmed.  Any  required  resettlement  plans  will  be  submitted  to,  and  approved  and  monitored \nby,  ADB  before the selected  activities  are  implemented.  Compensation, allowances,  operation \nand  administration  costs,  surveys,  monitoring,  and  reporting  will  be  financed  from  the  loan \nproceeds.  An  adequate  budget  for  resettlement  plan  preparation  and  implementation  will  be \nallocated accordingly as well as provision of resettlement specialists.  \n  \nEthnic  groups  (category  B).  Project  activities  will  not  cause  involuntary  changes  in \n35. \nethnic  groups\u2019  livelihood  systems,  cultural  practices,  ancestral  domains,  food  production \npractices,  or  cultural  cohesion;  or  unwanted  dependence  on  external  market  forces.  They  will \nnot lead to exclusion of any ethnic group.27 Possible negative impacts will be avoided if possible \nor will be compensated accordingly. Impacts are expected to be overwhelmingly positive since \nactivities  are  for  the  economic  and  social  improvement  of  the  total  population.  Specific \nmeasures  to  deal  with  potential  negative  impacts  and  to  encourage  participation  and \ncontribution of ethnic groups require customized approaches and interventions. An ethnic group \ndevelopment framework agreed upon by the government and ADB was prepared and resources \nallocated  for  its  implementation  to  guide  the  preparation  of  an  ethnic  group  plan  for  potential \ncategory  B  subprojects  based  on  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  28  The  executing \nand implementing agencies are experienced in carrying out such plans. No plans were prepared \nduring  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  as  specific  project  sites  had  not  been \nconfirmed. ADB will approve and monitor the plans before a subproject is implemented.  \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe project\u2019s integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major \n36. \nrisks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan.29 \n\n                                                \n25  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26  Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n27  Lao,  Khmou,  and  Hmong  are  the  major  indigenous  peoples  in  the  project  area  and  fall  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  description  of  indigenous  peoples.  \u201cEthnic  group\u201d  is  the  government\u2019s  preferred  term  for \nindigenous peoples (Constitution of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, 2003, article 8). \n\n28  Indigenous  Peoples  Planning  Framework:  Ethnic  Group  Planning  Framework  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n29  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n   9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nPublic Financial Management: \nWeak public financial management \nsystems and shortage of skills. \n\nCorruption: Lao PDR is ranked 154 \nout of 178 in Transparency \nInternational\u2019s 2010 index. \n\nMitigating Measures \nA framework of procedural requirements is set out in the PAM, reporting, and \nauditing requirements. A long-term project accountant (consultant) will be \nrecruited to help set up the accounting systems and provide capacity \ndevelopment. \nSince the government\u2019s Anticorruption Law (2005), a series of laws have \nbeen passed to strengthen public expenditure and financial management. \nThe National Legislative Assembly has set up a hot line to address \ncorruption. \nA long-term procurement specialist (consultant) will be recruited to help \nestablish correct procurement procedures and provide capacity development. \n\nProcurement: Inadequate \nknowledge and experience in \nprocurement. \nInstitutional Arrangements: \nUnclear roles and responsibilities \nand lack of experience in MAF and \nthe provincial agriculture and forestry \noffices. \nSustainability: Price fluctuations \nand officially induced market \ndistortions. \n\nPAM defines roles and responsibilities in detail. MAF and provincial \nagriculture and forestry offices are experienced on ADB projects principally \nthrough the previous LDP project, and implementation will be phased to \nconcentrate limited capacity on fewer activities at any one time. Consulting \nservices will provide support. \nDemand for meat is rapidly rising and will continue. Law on Food (2013) \nprovides additional backing for long term improvements in the livestock value \nchain that the project will be supporting. \nMAF = Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, PAM = project administration manual. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n37. \nThe  government  and  MAF  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n38. \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement.  \n \n\nThe government and MAF have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n39. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR14,164,000  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  the \nNorthern  Smallholder  Livestock  Commercialization  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nloan agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n 30 October 2014 \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n\nDesign Summary \n\nPerformance Targets and Indicators \nwith Baselines \n\nImpact \nIncreased incomes \nfor smallholder \nlivestock producers \nin the project areas \n\nBy 2026: \nAverage annual smallholder income in \nthe project areas increases to  \nKN8.0 million (baseline 2014:  \nKN3.4 million) \n\nOutcome \nIncreased livestock \nsales from \nsustainable \nsmallholder \nproduction in the \nproject areas \n \n\nOutputs \n\n \n\n1.
