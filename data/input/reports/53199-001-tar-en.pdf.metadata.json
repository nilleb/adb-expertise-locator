The  Livable  Cities  Investment  Project  will  support  the  inclusive  and  sustainable \ndevelopment of the secondary cities of Bavet, Kampot, and Poipet by providing (i) access to \nimproved wastewater services to 26,850 people, (ii) improved solid waste management services \nbenefitting 91,130 people, (iii) reduced flooding through improved urban stormwater and drainage \nsystems benefitting 23,960 people, and (iv) capacity development to strengthen the institutional \ncapacity of the municipal administrations in the operation and maintenance (O&M) of public \nservices. \n \n2.  Urban development and planning constraints. From 2008 to 2019, the population of \nCambodia population grew at an average of 1.4% per year, from 13.4 million to 15.5 million in \nand, by 2030, is expected to reach 20 million. During the same time, the urban population has \nincreased at a rate of 8.1% per year from 2.60 million to 6.14 million, representing an increase \nfrom 19.5% to 39.4%.1 Currently, most of the urban population is concentrated around the capital \ncity of Phnom Penh, but it is slowly spreading to secondary cities where limited access to urban \ninfrastructure and services is resulting in increased environmental degradation and deteriorating \nlivability. The provision of basic infrastructure services is critical to attracting private sector \ninvestments and promoting economic competitiveness.2 However, the weak institutional capacity \nand limited availability of resources of the municipal administrations constrain effective planning \nand service delivery to meet the needs of the growing population. \n \n3.  Access to urban infrastructure and services. In 2019, about 46.7% of the urban \npopulation had access to piped water supply in dwellings, with 10.6% reliant on piped water in a \ncompound, public taps or standpipes. About 44.8% of the urban population had access to a pour \nor flush toilet connected to sewerage, and 34.7% had access to a pour or flush toilet connected \nto a septic tank or pit.3 Many cities across the country experience poor wastewater service caused \nby the absence of wastewater treatment plants and poor sanitation management. Untreated \nsewage is commonly discharged directly to the open environment through combined sewers and \nroad drains or indirectly via open canals. Solid waste services are limited and often outsourced to \nprivate contractors, but inconsistent performance of the waste contractors and weak enforcement \nhave resulted in a large proportion of solid wastes remaining uncollected, dumped in open canals \nor the open environment, or burned. There are no sanitary landfills operate in the country. \n \n4.  Institutional arrangements. As part of the decentralization reform, the government \nadopted a subdecree in December 2019 under which planning, delivery, and O&M of public \nservices are delegated to the municipal administrations.4 Continued technical support from the \nline ministries however will be required as the municipal administrations are unable to effectively \ndeliver these services, primarily because of their limited financial independence, lack of technical \ncapacity, and human resource constraints. Unlike for water supply provision and solid waste \nservices in some cities, private sector investments in the delivery of urban services for wastewater \nand stormwater are limited because of low revenue potential. \n \n1  Government of Cambodia. 2020.

Under the subdecree, the municipal administrations, through the Public Works, \nTransportation, Hygiene, Environment, and Public Order Office, will provide public services including wastewater, \nstormwater drainage, and solid-waste management. \n \n ", "2 \n \n5.  Project area. The country partnership strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), for \nCambodia, 2019\u20132023 identified the need to focus on the development of the cities of Bavet, \nKampot, and Poipet because of their location along the Greater Mekong Subregion Southern \nEconomic Corridor, their potential to service cross-border trade (for Bavet as the key border entry \npoint to Cambodia from Viet Nam, and Poipet as the key border entry point from Thailand), and \nopportunities to promote tourism (Kampot). 5 \n \n6.  Access to services in the project area. Access to infrastructure in the project area is \nlimited.  There  are  currently  no  wastewater  treatment  plants  in  operation,  with  significant \nproportion of raw sewage discharged to the open environment through a series of combined \nsewers and road drains. Stormwater and solid waste services are also inadequate. Table 1 \nprovides an overview of the state of urban infrastructure and services in the three project cities. \n \nTable 1: Status of Urban Infrastructure and Services \nProjected  Piped water  Stormwater  Solid waste \nPermanent  Permanent  supply  Sanitation  (% population  (% household \nPopulation  Population  (% coverage,  (% safely  experiencing  collection \nCity  (2020)  (2040)  24 hours)  managed)b  flooding)c  coverage) \nBavet  44,570  73,500  57a  26  6  14 \nKampot  40,500  66,400  77  23  22  38 \nPoipet  110,500  203,500  50a  9  15  16 \na  Operated by a private service operator under a license arrangement with the Ministry of Industry, Science, \nTechnology and Innovation (previously Ministry of Industry and Handicraft). \nb  Fecal sludge is contained by onsite sanitation and not discharged to the open environment. \nc  Proportion of population experiencing flooding in their yard at least once a year based on a comprehensive city \nsurvey conducted in December 2019\u2013January 2020. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n7.  Financial capacity and operation and maintenance. The financial capacity of the \nmunicipal administrations of the three participating cities is weak because of limited access to \nfinancial resources and revenue streams. The municipal administrations rely heavily on transfers \nfrom the central government to subsidize their operations and to maintain a break-even cash \nsituation.6 Revenue from operating public utility services is limited, and the O&M of the combined \nwastewater and drainage network has been funded by the municipal budget and central transfers. \n \n8.  Policy framework. The government is guided by the Rectangular Strategy Phase IV \n(RSIV) which aims to promote economic development, strengthen the capacity and governance \nof public institutions, improve service delivery, and foster inclusive and sustainable development.7 \nThe RSIV is supported by the National Strategic Development Plan 2019\u20132023, which details an \naction plan to develop cities with improved services.8 It outlines a national target to achieve 100% \nservice coverage for both water supply and sanitation by 2025 and to strengthen the management \nof solid waste. \n \n9.  Project design. The project will have the following impact: livability of secondary cities \nimproved. It will have the following outcome: access to urban infrastructure and services in \n \n5  ADB. 2019.

The outputs are: (i) policy and regulatory environment improved, \n(ii) urban infrastructure improved, and (iii) institutional effectiveness and governance improved. \nThe project is estimated to cost $194.1 million. The government has requested a concessional \nloan of $180.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. \n \n10.  ADB value addition. ADB\u2019s decade-long involvement in the water and sanitation sector \nhas supported the government to improve the livability of cities by increasing access to basic \ninfrastructure.9 Under the  proposed  project,  ADB  assistance  will  broaden  its  focus to  also \nundertake long-term planning by supporting the government in adopting good practices in urban \nand infrastructure planning and providing tools for effective enforcement, to ensure that cities are \ndeveloped sustainably. The project will support the government to identify the infrastructure need \nand land and resources required to promote growth, target capacity development of the municipal \nadministrations and governance arrangement to ensure the long-term sustainability of public \nservices, and provide continued support to strengthen women\u2019s engagement in the sector.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n11.  The  government  recognizes  that  sustainable  urban  development  must  address \n(i) unplanned urbanization, (ii) existing and potential inequalities regarding access to services; \n(iii) socioeconomic development opportunities, and (iv) the local institutional capacity of the \nsubnational and municipal administrations to plan and create livable cities. It has made progress \nin addressing this through the RSIV, which promotes developing land use master plans and sector \nmaster plans.10 \n \n12.  However, many cities are still without an approved land use master plan, and only two \nprovincial spatial plans have been approved so far.11 Progress has been hindered because \npreparing  these  plans  requires  significant  resources  from  the  subnational  and  municipal \nadministrations, where capacity is already stretched and limited. Where land use master plans \nare  available,  a  disconnect  exists  between  what  has  been  proposed  and  what  is  being \nimplemented largely because of a lack of capacity and a weak regulatory and enforcement regime. \nDeveloping comprehensive sector master plans that detail how infrastructure should be delivered \nto service the current and projected demands of each city has not been institutionalized. As a \nresult, urban development across many cities remains unregulated and fragmented, with limited \ncoordination between urban growth and national and provincial land use strategies. \n \n13.  The technical assistance (TA) aligns with the government\u2019s strategy to develop land use \nplans to facilitate urban planning, strengthen the capacity and governance of public institutions, \nimprove service delivery, and promote inclusive and sustainable development. The TA will \ncomplement the ensuing project, which will focus on improving access to urban infrastructure and \nstrengthening the capacity of the municipal administrations of the participating cities to deliver \nsustainable and efficient urban services. The TA will support the subnational and municipal \n \n9  ADB. 2012. Greater Mekong Subregion Southern Economic Corridor Towns Development Project. Manila; ADB. \n2015.

It \nwill also facilitate the development of a land management and enforcement framework to monitor \nthe implementation of the planning documents. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n14.  Output 1: Spatial and land use planning improved. This output will facilitate (i) creating \nprovincial spatial plans for Svay Rieng and Kampot;12 (ii) reviewing and updating the municipal \nland use master plans for all participating cities;13 (iii) drafting municipal land use plans that \nconsider future growth and development, including changes in land use and climate change; \n(iv) developing  detailed  plans  (urban  designs)  for  specific  priority  areas  and  appropriate \ndevelopment control rules (special conservation areas, border zone areas, coastal, riverfront) in \nthe participating cities; and (v) designing a coordination and enforcement framework to monitor \nadherence to the plans and to improve urban management and development in these cities. \nDeveloping spatial and land use plans will involve extensive consultations and participation from \ngovernment and line ministries, community representatives, and other stakeholders, including the \nprivate sector. Workshops will be conducted in the cities and provinces to provide information on \nthe planning process and objectives, to obtain public inputs on the development and vision of the \ncities and provinces, and to present and obtain feedback on the key strategies and plans. A \ndetailed consultation strategy that defines the engagement methods and considers involving a \nbroad range of stakeholders will be developed.14 \n \n15.  Output 2: Institutional capacity and governance strengthened. This output aims to \nimprove the technical capacity of the subnational and municipal administrations in spatial and \nurban  planning.  A  capacity  building  needs  assessment  will  be  conducted  to  inform  the \ndevelopment of a comprehensive training framework and tools to address the skills gap,15 and a \ndetailed capacity development and training program will be developed and implemented. The \nprogram\u2019s objective is to increase knowledge and understanding of the processes involved in \n(i) planning and developing cities, (ii) preparing spatial and land use plans, (iii) conducting spatial \nmapping, and (iv) holding consultations and stakeholder engagement.16 To ensure continuous \nand long-term capacity development, the program will include training materials and specialist \ntraining of key nominated focal points involved in urban development from the central and \nsubnational administrations, to continue the capacity building activities in the long term.17 The \nMinistry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction is revising the Law on Land \n \n12 The provincial spatial plan for Banteay Meanchey is being developed through an ongoing ADB project (ADB. \nCambodia: Second Urban Environmental Management in the Tonle Sap Basin Project). \n13 Municipal land use master plans were endorsed by the government in 2018 for Kampot and 2019 for Bavet and \nPoipet. These will require updates to reflect changes to the city development. \n14 Modalities for workshops, training, and consultations will depend on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic \nsituation. These will be conducted virtually if limited in-country, face-to face sessions are not feasible. \n15 The TA will build on the lessons from the TA for Capacity Development for Urban Management (TA 8121) financed \nby the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, which aimed to build capacity in urban management and local development \nplanning. The TA established a training program for urban management but noted that long-term support was \nrequired to strengthen technical capacity, particularly at the subnational level. \n16 A consultancy service engaged under the TA will develop the training program. The terms of reference for the TA \nwill incorporate opportunities to engage with qualified training partners. Development partners, including Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank, will be invited to \nparticipate in workshops, seminars, and training sessions to share information and knowledge on urban and \ninfrastructure planning, based on project experiences. \n17 The training program is envisaged to benefit at least 100 government officials. However, the modality for the training \nwill depend on the COVID-19 situation (footnote 14). \n \n ", "5 \nManagement, Urban Planning and Constructions, and the TA will provide guidance on developing \nsupporting technical standards, guidelines, and regulations to facilitate the implementation of the \nrevised law once enacted. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $2 million, of which $2 million will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items \nare  listed  in  Appendix  1.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart  staff,  access  to  reports  and  information,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The \ngovernment was informed that TA approval does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The executing agency will be the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and \nConstruction, the key central agency managing national, regional, provincial, and municipal \nmaster planning.
