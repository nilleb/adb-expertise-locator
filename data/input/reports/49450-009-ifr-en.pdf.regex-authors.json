BACKGROUND \n \n1.  On 22 June 2017, the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved \nthe Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility.1 The facility will finance renewable energy \nprojects in the 11 smallest Pacific island developing member countries.2 Its overall estimated cost \nof $750 million includes ADB financing of up to $200 million. Upon approval, the Board delegated \nauthority to the President to approve loans and/or grants to each targeted country for qualifying \nprojects.  \n \n2.  The facility will finance the grant to Nauru for the Solar Power Development Project. The \nproject will finance (i) a grid-connected solar power plant with a capacity of 6 megawatts (MW) of \nalternating current; and (ii) a 2.5-megawatt-hour (MWh), 5 MW battery energy storage system \n(BESS) to enable smoothing of intermittent solar energy. The system will be fully automated and \nintegrated with the existing diesel generation system (17.9 MW of installed capacity, currently \noperated manually) to optimize solar energy use, enable optimal BESS charging and discharging, \nand allow optimal shut-off of the diesel engines. This will reduce Nauru\u2019s reliance on diesel for \npower generation and decrease production costs. The project will also support the institutional \nstrengthening of Nauru Utilities Corporation (NUC). Project preparatory technical assistance (TA) \nwas used to carry out project-enabling activities  such as a Solar Power Expansion Plan for Nauru, \nproject feasibility study, detailed design, and plant procurement contract bidding documents.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Country background. Nauru is a single isolated island in the South Pacific, with a land \narea of 21 square kilometers and a population of 13,300 in 2017. It is a small island developing \nstate that is classified by ADB as a fragile and conflict-affected situation Nauru\u2019s economy is \nnarrowly based on revenue from the Nauru Regional Processing Centre and the sale of fishing \nlicenses. In the 1970s, Nauru had one of the world\u2019s highest national incomes per capita because \nof its phosphate industry; however, by the late 1990s, the economy had contracted severely as \nproduction slowed. Although broad fiscal management reforms helped improve government \nfinances, the country faces the difficult task of ensuring fiscal sustainability in the medium term. \n \n4.  Energy security. Nauru relies heavily on imported diesel for power generation. In 2018, \nonly about 3% of its total electricity came from solar photovoltaic installations; the rest came from \ndiesel generators.4 All fuel is imported through Nauru\u2019s single commercial port, which is highly \nvulnerable to severe weather events and the effects of climate change. This dependence on \nimported fossil fuel exposes the nation to price shocks from fluctuating fuel prices and creates the \nrisk of power outages if diesel supply is interrupted. The Government of Nauru is committed to \nimproving energy security and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and has set ambitious \nrenewable energy targets for power generation by 2020 in the Nauru Energy Road Map, 2018\u2013\n2020. Electricity demand is generally flat at about 4 MW. That is expected to increase minimally. \n \n1  ADB. 2017. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Pacific Renewable \nEnergy Investment Facility. Manila. \n2  Besides Nauru: the Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Samoa, \nSolomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.  \n3  ADB provided project preparatory TA for the Solar Power Development Project under the Pacific Renewable Energy \nInvestment Facility (TA 9242-REG). \n4  As of November 2018, Nauru had 807 kilowatts (kW) of installed solar power capacity. \n \n ", "2 \nUncertainty surrounds future demand because it depends on whether large power consumers \nsuch as Australia\u2019s processing center, Republic of Nauru Phosphate Corporation, or the new \nNauru Port are connected to the national grid. \n \n5.  Energy sector development. The cost of power generation in Nauru is high\u2014regularly \nmore than $0.40 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), depending on international fuel prices. Historically, \ntariffs did not cover the cost of supplying power, so the government had to bear annual subsidy \ncosts of $3 million\u2013$4 million.5 However, this situation is rapidly improving, in part because of \nADB\u2019s recent TA support to developing legislation for NUC, preparing a corporate strategy for \nNUC,    preparing  tariff  and  subsidy  policy  reforms  (including  a  subsidy  for  disadvantaged \nresidents), preparing an asset management and maintenance plan, improving NUC\u2019s accounting \nsystems, and implementing a revised corporate governance structure.6 In 2017, ADB financed \ntwo high-efficiency diesel generators and a new switchgear through the Electricity Supply Security \nand Sustainability Project, to help supply baseload, reduce power outages, and improve system \nreliability and efficiency. This improved revenue, operations, and service reliability. But the legal \nframework to develop renewable energy is limited; and institutional reforms, tariff revisions, and \nprivate sector engagement for renewable energy are needed. \n \n6.  Barriers to sector development. The government and NUC have limited borrowing \ncapacity, and available government funds and revenue from electricity customers are insufficient \nto finance capital costs. NUC operates a 500-kilowatt (kW) solar plant, funded by the United Arab \nEmirates, and is constructing a 1.0 MW solar plant, funded by the Government of New Zealand \nand the European Union. Despite this progress, NUC requires (i) further financial assistance for \nlarge solar assets; (ii) support to integrate new assets into the grid; (iii) capacity building in the \nareas  of  solar  power  generation  and  BESS  maintenance  to  ensure  grid  stability;  and \n(iv) assistance in financial management, gender mainstreaming, and project implementation. \n \n7.  Proposed  solution.  Sector  improvements  noted  in  para.  5  have  created  favorable \nconditions for NUC to integrate new renewable energy assets into its fleet. In 2018, ADB, through \nthe Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility, provided TA to assess options for integrating \nnew sources of power and to develop a solar expansion plan for NUC. The TA team identified a \nsolar power system supported by a BESS to be the least-cost option for reducing dependence on \ndiesel while improving electricity supply and reliability. With the project, the levelized cost of \nenergy will be about $.30 per kWh\u2014a significant improvement from the current rate of $.40 per \nkWh. Integrating new solar assets into Nauru\u2019s grid can reduce the country\u2019s dependence on \nfossil  fuels,  decrease  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions,  and  strengthen  NUC\u2019s  commercial \nperformance. \n \n8.  The project will finance a 6 MW solar plant and the 2.5 MWh, 5 MW BESS, to be integrated \nwith the diesel generation system already in place (17.9 MW of installed capacity). It will also fund \na project implementation consultant (PIC) to support NUC during detailed design, construction, \ninstallation, and commissioning; and to train NUC personnel. The project will improve energy \nsecurity and help Nauru reduce about 11,155 tons of CO  emissions per year. \n2\n \n \n5  Nauru Utility Corporation annual reports. https://www.nuc.com.nr/annual-reports. \n6  ADB. 2011.

Alignment with development strategies. The project supports the operational priorities \nof ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 by (i) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, \nand enhancing environmental sustainability; (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality; and \n(iii) strengthening governance and institutional capacity.7 The project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 because it supports a country that is both a small island developing state and in a \nfragile and conflict-affected situation. Also, the project will directly support the target of 50% \nrenewable energy for Nauru under the Nauru Energy Road Map 2018\u20132020, and assist the \ncountry in achieving its nationally determined contributions under the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change. The project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business \nplan for 11 small Pacific island countries, 2019\u22122021.8 \n \n10.  Processing under the Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility. The project will \nbe processed under the renewable energy investment facility and meets the following qualifying \ncriteria, set out in the report and recommendation of the President for the facility (footnote 1): \n(i) the  project  scope  includes  renewable  energy  generation  and  support  for  energy  sector \ninfrastructure, such as a BESS and mini grid system; (ii) Nauru is one of the 11 smallest Pacific \nisland developing member countries; (iii) the project is included in the Nauru Energy Road Map \n2018\u20132020; and (iv) the project is classified category B for environment. \n \n11.  Lessons from past projects. ADB\u2019s previous energy projects in Nauru and across the \nPacific experienced issues with (i) technical compatibility, i.e., connectivity with the existing \nsystem; (ii) limited transport infrastructure to ship project equipment from overseas; and (iii) \nforeign exchange risks during project implementation. 9 These lessons were considered in the \ndesign of this solar power project. First, the engineering design will ensure connectivity between \nthe grid, the BESS, the generators, and other existing associated facilities. Second, government \ncounterpart funds are being used to contract a local state-owned enterprise to conduct site \npreparation with local equipment and materials and ADB is supporting Nauru to build a port which \nwill improve shipping during the project\u2019s construction phase.10 Third, foreign exchange risk is \nanticipated to be minimal since the project is not cofinanced and only one currency will likely be \nused. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  reliable,  affordable,  secure,  and \nsustainable energy supply to meet the socioeconomic development needs of Nauru.11 The project \nwill have the following outcome: the use of renewable energy within the grid will have increased \nand the cost of electricity generation will have decreased. NUC, the state-owned power and water \nutility, will supply reliable and cleaner electricity. Once this project\u20146 MW solar photovoltaic plant \nand BESS\u2014and the New Zealand project\u20141 MW solar photovoltaic plant\u2014are completed, solar \npower  generation  will  have  increased  from  1,180 MWh/year  to  15,500  MWh/year  and  will \nrepresent 47% of the electricity generation mix on the island. NUC has now approached the \nGovernment of New Zealand to fund an assessment of pumped hydroelectric energy storage to \nallow load shifting and enable up to 90% renewable energy penetration. \n \n7  ADB. 2018.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  Design  features.  The  project  team  assessed  technical  feasibility  options  covering \ngeneration  (least  cost  and  proven  technology),  equipment  selection  and  layout,  grid \ninterconnections,  ground  conditions,  topographical  issues,  communication  networks,  and \nprotection requirements. It also considered connectivity with adjacent power generation assets, \nease of construction, ease of operation, and ease of decommissioning. The design incorporates \ninterconnection with the existing diesel engines and solar installations. The technology was \nselected to match the existing systems, which will contribute to ease of operation. The chosen \noption will reduce the requirement for diesel-generated power and thereby reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions and the costs of electricity generation in Nauru. \n \n21.  Climate change mitigation measures. The project will support climate change mitigation \nby reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO . Once complete, the solar facility will \n2\ngenerate about 12.4 MWh of power every year. During solar generation or battery load shifting, \nthe diesel generators will be in shut-off mode and will turn on only when required (at night and \nwhen batteries are exhausted). Lower diesel consumption will reduce about 11,155 tons of CO  \n2\nequivalent per year from Nauru\u2019s emission total. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  Economic aspects. Economic analysis indicates that the project is economically viable, \nwith an economic internal rate of return of 10.4%\u2014well above ADB\u2019s minimum economic internal \nrate of return of 9.0%. Quantified benefits include (i) savings in avoided fuel costs from a partial \nswitch from diesel-based to solar generation (non-incremental benefits), (ii) new beneficiaries\u2019 \nwillingness to pay for improved and expanded electricity services (incremental benefits), and \n(iii) environmental gains from reduced carbon emissions. Sensitivity analysis confirms that risks to \n ", "7 \n \nthe project\u2019s economic viability are generally low and are mitigated by conservative assumptions \nin the valuation of costs and benefits.13 \n \n23.  Financial aspects. The incremental revenues from the project are derived from savings \nin fuel costs brought about by the replacement of diesel-based generation with solar power. \nOperation and maintenance costs for solar power plants are minimal and would be accounted for \nin NUC\u2019s finances by the reduced cost of power generation on the island. The financial internal \nrate of return (FIRR) and financial net present value were computed at April 2019 price levels. \nThe estimated FIRR is 5.6%, which exceeds the weighted average cost of capital at 1.76%. The \nfinancial viability was tested in sensitivity analysis, which shows that the FIRR is robust under \nvarious adverse conditions: (i) 20% increase in capital costs, (ii) 20% increase in operational \ncosts, (iii) 20% reduction in revenue, and (iv) 1-year delay in project implementation. The financial \nsustainability  analysis  conducted  at  NUC  level  demonstrates  that  NUC  can  absorb  the \nincremental operation and maintenance expenditures of about 6%\u20137% of its total expenditure, \nincluding the system replacement costs scheduled for 2033 and 2043. \n \nC.

ADB\u2019s regional TA for Legal Readiness for Climate \nFinance and Climate Investments included a review of the legal readiness for investments in \nNauru's renewable energy program.14 It found that the legal framework is adequate to implement \nthis project. However, as the country develops this program further, it will be advantageous to \nalso strengthen the legal framework. The main recommendation of the review was for Nauru to \nprepare an energy act to improve the legal clarity for energy management in Nauru. DCIE \nrequested support for the government to prepare an energy act, and ADB agreed to provide \nsupport under the regional TA. \n \n25.  Financial management. The overall financial management risk before mitigation is rated \nsubstantial. The main risks are weak internal control because of the absence of an internal audit \nfunction within NUC, and weak asset management policies. ADB will closely monitor the financial \nmanagement risks during project implementation. The proposed mitigation measures include \n(i) adding covenants to the grant agreement to ensure adequate insurance coverage for assets, \nand (ii) strengthening internal controls to improve accountability. \n \n26.  Reforms for efficiency and sustainability. ADB is providing regional TA to help utilities \nin the Pacific revise governance arrangements, and conduct commercial and technical reforms to \nbecome more financially sustainable.15 For Nauru, this will include (i) a comprehensive diagnostic \nassessment of the utility\u2019s performance against standard industry indicators  such as revenue per \nkWh and energy losses, (ii) an assessment of completeness of the utilities asset registry, \noperational and maintenance performance, (iii) a review of financial management and accounting \ncontrols and procedures, and  (iv) a review of sector regulation and governance, including tariff \npolicies and procedures.  The TA will work with NUC to integrate the diagnostic assessment \nresults into NUC\u2019s strategy and business plans  \n \n27.  Procurement and implementation risks, and mitigation measures. ADB assessed the \nprocurement capacities of NUC and DOF, and found the overall project procurement risk to be \n \n13 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 ADB. 2019.

ADB will disburse funds directly to the plant procurement contractor (PPC) and the PIC. NUC \nwill supervise the procurement of works and goods and the selection of consultants. It will monitor \nthe performance of the PPC and PIC. NUC will prepare regular financial reports and engage an \nexternal auditor acceptable to ADB to prepare annual audited project financial statements. All \nproject-related expenses will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, \nas amended from time to time). Procurement will be based on ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). \n \n28.  Corruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand discussed with the government, DOF, and NUC. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n29.  The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. Overall, it will benefit women \nin Nauru by reducing the cost of electricity generation, which in turn should result in lower user \ntariffs and benefit women in their household and productive roles. Women in Nauru face various \nchallenges, not least barriers to equal participation in the workforce, job segregation, and gender-\nbased violence. The gender action plan includes proactive measures to encourage women\u2019s \neconomic empowerment and support their access to technical roles in the energy sector, both \nthrough the project and by changing the social norms that have kept women from working in the \nfields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Gender action plan activities will \n(i) support women in leadership and technical roles in Nauru\u2019s energy sector, including renewable \nenergy generation; (ii) provide income-generating opportunities for women in skilled and unskilled \nwork; (iii) help institutions develop and adopt a gender strategy and policies (e.g., maternity policy, \nflexible working arrangements); (iv) increase awareness among schools and students, especially \nfemale students, of technical career options, including in the field of renewable energy; and \n(v) provide  gender  training  to  contractors  and  the  project team,  with  a  particular focus  on \nHIV/AIDS and gender-based violence. The PIC will include a social safeguards and gender \nspecialist, and NUC will appoint a gender focal point for the project. \n \n30.  All households in Nauru are connected to electricity supply from the grid. The project will \nreduce the costs of generating electricity, which will ease the pressure on the government to raise \ntariffs for residential customers, and thus benefit the poor.16 The project will generate a small \nnumber of temporary jobs during construction, and will increase the capacities of NUC employees \nthrough project implementation support, training, and an institutional strengthening program \ndelivered by the PIC\u2014with gender inclusion targets. Outreach programs in schools will raise \nawareness of work opportunities related to science and technology, including renewable energy. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n31.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.17 \n \n32.  Environment (category B). The project will be developed on a 6-hectare site previously \nmined for phosphate. The site and its surrounding area contain little if any vegetation of habitat \n \n16 A previous tariff review supported by ADB led to the third-lowest rates in the Pacific for residential customers, with \nlow rates for initial usage and prepayment options. These initiatives have benefited poor households. \n17 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "9 \n \nor conservation value. The initial environmental examination confirms that the project will have no \nsignificant impacts on environmental and social attributes of the project impact area. The project \nwill not result in loss of habitats of endemic, endangered, or significant terrestrial biodiversity, or \nof protected areas. The examination report includes an EMP that will be integrated into bid and \ncontract documents, and will guide the contractors in preparing more detailed construction EMPs, \nto be reviewed and cleared by DCIE and ADB before site activities begin. The PIC will support \nNUC in monitoring compliance of any project activity with the requisite environmental safeguards. \n \n33.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  will  be  implemented  on \n10.55 hectares of land leased by NUC since 2017 and available up to 2047. The lease contract \nwith 799 landowners is for 20 years, with the option to renew it for another 10 years\u2014covering \nthe life of the solar project. The contract also provides for a review of the terms and conditions, \nincluding the lease rate, every 5 years, or whenever changes are made to the official land lease \nrates set by the government, consistent with the requirement of Nauru\u2019s Constitution. The project \nwill not result in physical or economic displacement or involuntary resettlement. The project team \nconfirmed the land ownership records with the Department of Lands, and undertook consultations \nwith landowners as part of the due diligence to ensure compliance with government laws and \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The due diligence confirmed the need to implement the \nfollowing corrective actions: (i) collect additional signatures from landowners of lot sections 249 \nand 265 to meet the required 75% signatures both by number and interest, as required by the \nLand Act; and (ii) make sure that NUC pays outstanding rent to all unpaid landowners who were \nunable to provide the required bank accounts, especially those residing overseas, or sets up an \ninterest-earning escrow account to deposit all the unpaid rent. These corrective actions, required \nas a condition to grant effectiveness, are currently being implemented by the government. The \nPIC will provide additional support to NUC to set up a mechanism for monitoring payments in the \nfuture to ensure compliance with the Land Act. Other key stakeholders were consulted and will \ncontinue to be consulted during implementation. \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No indigenous peoples who can be defined as distinct \nand vulnerable live on the island. The population is 94% ethnic Nauruan; the other 6% hail from \nvarious countries. \n \n F.
