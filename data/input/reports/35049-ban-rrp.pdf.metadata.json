Although there have \nbeen improvements to and development of the road network of the \nsouthwest zone, links with the rest of the country across the Padma \nRiver are still only by ferry. The capacity of ferry services is very \nlimited, and waiting time at ferry ghats is about 1 hour for buses and \nlight vehicles and 2 hours for trucks. In addition, the riverbanks of the \nPadma are very unstable, and the river width changes frequently, \nleaving  approach  ghats  seasonally  inoperative.  The  expansion  of \nexisting  ferry  terminals  is  made  difficult  by  these  conditions. \nMoreover, there is an urgent need to replace dangerous ferry and \nlaunch operations between Dhaka and the southwest region by safer \nand more reliable surface transport. Overloaded vessels frequently \nsink  in  this  waterway  when  passing  through  the  treacherously \nturbulent confluence of the Padma and Meghna rivers. \n \nThe  social,  economic,  and  industrial  underdevelopment  of  the \nsouthwest zone\u2014which encompasses Bangladesh\u2019s second major \nport,  Mongla;  its  third  main  city,  Khulna;  and  the  inland  port  at \nBenapole\u2014is due in part to difficult access across the Padma River \nto the rest of the country. A bridge across the Padma River will \ncertainly strengthen links between the southwest and north-central \nzones.  A  highway  bridge,  in  particular,  will  enhance  freight  and \npassenger transportation between  Dhaka and major points in the \nsouthwest zone and contribute substantially to the development of \nthe southwest zone as well as to national economic growth. \n \nThe TA loan will assist the Government in preparing the detailed \nengineering  documents  and  procurement  of  Padma  bridge \nconstruction. \n   \n ", "ii   \nImpact and Outcome  The TA loan will facilitate project preparation for an investment loan \nto  construct  the  Padma  bridge  connecting  the  economically \ndepressed  southwest  zone  to  the  economically  more  advanced \neastern zone of the country. It will minimize technical uncertainty and \nensure readiness to implement the follow-on loan project. The follow-\non  project  will  help  the  Government  achieve  poverty  reduction \nthrough  economic  growth  by  improving  transport  efficiency  and \nstrengthening the integration of road networks.  \n   \nProject Investment  The  investment  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $22  million, \nPlan   including taxes and duties of $2.8 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  The  equivalent  in  various  currencies  of  Special  Drawing  Rights \n11,179,000  from  the  Special  Fund  resources  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will be provided. The proposed loan will \nhave a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an \ninterest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter.     \n   \nEstimated Project  28 February 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nPeriod of Loan  1 March 2008\u250031 August 2010 \nUtilization \n   \nExecuting Agency  Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority (JMBA) \n   \nImplementation  Under JMBA, a project implementation unit (PIU) will be established \nArrangements  and headed by the project director (chief engineer level) supported by \na  deputy  project  director,  two  project  engineers,  a  finance  and \naccounting  staffer,  and  an  administrative  staffer.  The  PIU  will  be \nsupported by two sets of independent monitoring arrangements. A \nteam of checking engineers will be engaged and assigned outside of \nthe PIU to independently review the design criteria, specifications, \ndrawings, and other documents submitted by the design consultants \nand  check  the  detailed  design  to  ensure  that  it  meets  project \nobjectives.  An  independent  panel  of  experts  (POE)  will  be \nestablished\u2014again  outside  of  the  PIU\u2014to  independently  guide, \nmonitor, and advise on the detailed design.  \n   \nConsulting Services  An international consulting firm associated with domestic consulting \nfirms  will  prepare  scheme  designs;  conduct  necessary  technical \nstudies;  and  develop  detailed  engineering  design  and  tender \ndocuments for the main bridge, approach roads, and river-training \nworks, as well as assist JMBA in undertaking tender actions including \ncontractors prequalification, preparation of selection criteria, tender \nevaluation,  and  final  contract  documentation.  About  545  person-\nmonths of international consulting services and 399 person-months of \ndomestic will be required from various experts. \n ", "  iii\n  The consultants will be selected and appointed by the quality-based \nselection method using full technical proposals in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time).  \n \nAt  the  request  of  the  Government,  ADB  will  carry  out  consultant \nselection on behalf of the Government, while the Government will \nretain its authority for contract negotiation and signing.  \n \nIndividual consultants will be engaged by JMBA for the POE, and a \nfirm will be engaged as checking engineers. The consultants will be \nexperts  of  international  repute.  About  120  person-months  of \ninternational inputs will be required for these services. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The TA loan will facilitate project preparation for an investment loan \nBeneficiaries  to  construct  the  Padma  bridge  connecting  the  economically \ndepressed  southwest  zone  to  the  economically  more  advanced \neastern zone of the country. It will minimize technical uncertainty and \nensure readiness to implement the follow-on loan. \n \nThe Padma bridge will be a large-scale infrastructure project, and its \nconstruction and operation will significantly benefit various sectors of \nthe  economy  of  Bangladesh  nationally  and  regionally.  The  road \ndistance from Dhaka to nearly all major destinations in the southwest \nregion will be reduced by 100 kilometers (km) or more, which will \nbring tremendous savings in passenger and commodity movement \ntime and costs, as well as vehicle operation and maintenance costs, \nwhile lengthening the useful life of vehicles and reducing the import \nbill for fuels. With the bridge, capital inflow will increase, promoting \nindustrial  and  commercial  activity  and  improving  economic  and \nemployment opportunities for local people, who will also gain better \naccess  to  healthcare  facilities  and  modern  health  technologies \navailable at Dhaka. Easier communication will help expand education \nand training facilities, and the resulting skills development will ensure \nthe availability of high-quality workers. The export of skilled workers \nwill increase wage earnings. Riverbank protection will reduce bank\nerosion  and  the  incidence  of  worsened  vulnerability  and  poverty \namong  people  displaced  by  erosion.  During  construction, \nunemployed  local  people  will  get  employment,  and  increased \ncommercial activity will facilitate income generation among locals. \nThe  country  will  be  physically  integrated  through  the  fixed  link, \nreducing economic disparity and deprivation. An estimate of multiplier \neffects on the Padma bridge investment shows the bridge increasing \nthe national GDP growth rate by 1.2% and the gross product in the \nsouthwest  region  by  35%,  as  well  as  generating  additional \nemployment  opportunities  of  743,000  person-years,  which  equals \n1.2% of the total labor force of Bangladesh. \n \n \n ", "iv   \n  The  southwest  region  has  one  of  the  highest  poverty  rates  in  a \npoverty-stricken country. About 42% of the national population lived \nin March 2004 below the absolute poverty line. In Khulna division in \nthe southwest, the poverty incidence was 46%, which is much higher \nthan Dhaka\u2019s 33%. The poor in the project area will reap immediate \nbenefits  from  the  bridge  construction  in  the  form  of  employment \nduring  construction,  additional  employment  in  relocated  related \nactivities,  subsistence  allowances  and  other  benefits  from \nresettlement, and increased trading income during construction. In \nthe long-term, the impact of the bridge on poverty reduction will be \neven more significant, as the economic benefits generated by the \nbridge and accruing to the poor will be greater than their share of the \nGDP.  \n   \nRisks and  The political and security situation could become unfavorable to the \nAssumptions  implementation of detailed engineering design for the Project and to \nthe  country\u2019s  prioritization  of  resources  for  the  main  construction \nproject. ADB will need to closely monitor the situation and coordinate \nwith the local donors\u2019 group to ensure adequate protection. \n \nTimely provision of the Government\u2019s counterpart funding is essential \nfor the safe delivery of the Project on schedule and is particularly at \nrisk when the finances of the Government are squeezed.   \n \nThe findings from the social and environmental impact study will need \nto be discussed thoroughly with affected people during the detailed \ndesign stage. To achieve smooth implementation of the investment, \nthe environmental and social concerns of affected people will need to \nbe taken into account in developing the project design.   \n \nIn view of massive land acquisition and resettlement induced by the \nbridge  and  its  associated  infrastructure,  the  Government  should \nallocate  sufficient  resources  to  plan,  operate,  and  manage  land \nacquisition and resettlement, paying particular attention to restoring \naffected people\u2019s livelihood in a country where land is scarce and \npoverty is pervasive. The detailed design consultants will develop an \nincome-restoration  program  to  address  livelihood  issues.  Since \ngovernance in matters related to resettlement and land acquisition \nwill be a risk, an external monitoring mechanism will be developed. \n \nTo  strengthen  project  implementation  capacity,  JMBA  should  be \nrestructured as a division under the Ministry of Communications and \nhave a separate land acquisition, resettlement, and environment unit \nas proposed by the Jamuna Bridge Impact Study. This study pointed \nout that establishing social and environmental units within JMBA, and \nwith the necessary staff and support from management consultants, \nwas  essential  to  enabling  the  implementation  of  the  plans  for \nresettlement, land acquisition, and environmental management. \n ", "89o  00'E 91o  45'E\nBANGLADESH\nPADMA MULTIPURPOSE BRIDGE DESIGN PROJECT\nPanchagarh\nThakurgaon\nNilphamari\nLalmonirhat N\nSayedpur\nRangpur Kurigram\n25 o 30'N Dinajpur Parbatipur Teesta R. 0 25 50 75 25 o 30'N\nKilometers\nI N D I A Gaibandha\nJoypurhat Bahadurabad Tamabil\n    Sherpur Sunamganj Chhatak\nNawabganj NaoRg aAo nJ S H A H I BograJBamuhna uRJ.aapmuralpur BMrayhmmaepnustrian Rg.h NetrokoMnoahanganj S YK uLsh Hiy aEra T R.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ntechnical assistance loan to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Padma Multipurpose \nBridge Design Project (the Project). \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The  transport  system  in  Bangladesh  is  extensive  and  diversified,  comprising  about \n140,000 kilometers (km) of roads, 2,855 km of railroads, 5,970 km of perennial and seasonal \nwaterways linking more than 15 major river ports and terminals spread all over the country, two \nmajor seaports, and seven airports. The primary road network, connecting national and regional \nroads and district roads, totals 20,800 km,1 and secondary roads total 115,000 km. National and \nregional roads and district roads are administered by the Roads and Highways Department \n(RHD), and bridges of at least 1,500 meters (m) are administered by the Jamuna Multipurpose \nBridge  Authority  within  the  Ministry  of  Communications  (MOC).  Secondary  roads  are \nadministered  by  the  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  within  the  local \ngovernment division. \n \n3.  The performance of the road sector has consistently improved in recent decades, aided \nby the extension of the road network and demand for road transport that increased rapidly in the \n1990s at an average annual rate of 8.4% for passengers and 8.2% for freight, or almost double \nthe average gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 4.7%. The modal share of transport has \ngradually shifted in favor of roads. From 1975 to 2005 the modal share of road transport rose \nfrom 54% to 70% for passenger traffic and from 35% to 72% for freight, making roads the \nprincipal mode of transport. The transport sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n4.  Roads  are  important  for  the  regional  cooperation  emphasized  in  the  long-term \ndevelopment strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). At the center of the South Asia \ngrowth quadrangle and surrounded by India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Myanmar, Bangladesh will \naccommodate most intraregional transit shipments in the region. Asian Highways, conceived \nand pursued by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific \n(UNESCAP) as a road network linking Asia and Europe, will pass through Bangladesh, making \nit  the  link  between  South  and  Southeast  Asia.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  for  the  road  sector  in \nBangladesh should foster a conducive environment for regional cooperation and maximize \ndevelopment impact over South Asia.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Transport Network in Bangladesh \n \n5.  The  subcontinent\u2019s  major  rivers\u2014the  Padma,  Jamuna  (Brahmaputra),  Ganges,  and \nMeghna\u2014have  geographically  divided  Bangladesh  since  independence  in  1971  into  four \nprincipal  zones:  north-central  (Dhaka  Division),  east  (Chittagong  and  Sylhet  divisions), \nnorthwest (Rajahahi Division), and southwest (Khulna and Barisal divisions). The road network \nhas been developed and now provides good links connecting the northwest, north-central and \n                                                 \n1  The primary road network comprises 3,086 km of national roads, 1,751 km of regional roads, and 15,962 km of \ndistrict roads. District roads are the ones connecting national and regional roads.  \n ", "2   \neast zones, encompassing the national capital, Dhaka. This development includes five highway \nbridges that have been constructed over the major rivers. Three bridges cross the Meghna \nRiver  and  its  tributaries  (Meghna  bridge,  Meghna-Gumti  bridge  and  Bhairab  bridge);  one \nmultipurpose (highway and railway) bridge crosses the Jamuna (Bangabandhu bridge); and one \nbridge crosses the Ganges (Paksey bridge). \n \n6.  The  Padma  River  separates  the  southwest  zone  from  other  parts  of  the  country, \nespecially the north-central zone, where the national capital of Dhaka is located. Although there \nhave been improvements and developments of the road network of the southwest zone, links \nwith the rest of the country across the Padma River are still by ferry only. The transport capacity \nof ferry services is very limited, and waiting time at ferry ghats is about 1 hour for buses and \nlight vehicles and 2 hours for trucks. In addition, the riverbanks of the Padma are very unstable, \nand  the  river  width  changes  frequently,  leaving  approach  ghats  seasonally  operative  and \ncomplicating the expansion of existing ferry terminals. Moreover, there is an urgent need to \nreplace dangerous ferry and launch operations between Dhaka and the southwest region by a \nsafer and more reliable surface transport system. Overloaded vessels frequently sink in the \nwaterways passing through the treacherously turbulent confluence of the Padma and Meghna \nrivers.  \n \n7.  The social, economic, and industrial underdevelopment of the southwest zone\u2014which \nencompasses Bangladesh\u2019s second major port, Mongla; its third main city, Khulna; and the \ninland port at Benapole\u2014is due in part to difficult access across the Padma River to the rest of \nthe  country.  A  bridge  across  the  Padma  River  will  certainly  strengthen  links  between  the \nsouthwest and north-central zones. A highway bridge in particular will enhance freight and \npassenger transportation between Dhaka and major points in the southwest zone, thereby \ncontributing substantially to the development of the southwest zone as well as to national \neconomic growth. \n \n8.  Bangladesh will bestride Asian Highway Route A-1, which is planned under UNESCAP \nto connect Asia to Europe (Tokyo, Japan, to Kapikule, Turkey, via Pusan, Beijing, Delhi, and \nIstanbul). One section of this corridor is to connect Kolkata in India to Dhaka through Mawa and \nBhanga in the area near the Padma River, which will become an important highway for trade \ngoods between Bangladesh and India.   \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Strategy for Transport Sector Development \n \n9.  Addressing transport bottlenecks has become more urgent in the era of global trade \nfollowing the lapse of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, to reduce the cost of doing business and \nimprove the overall investment climate. ADB's public sector operations will build on several \ndecades of progress by encouraging the progressive adoption of policy and institutional reforms \nin the transport sector by (i) adopting a holistic view and network approach to the transport \nsector, with a focus on its sustainability and the effects of development on the environment and \nsociety; (ii) assuming a major role in helping the Government sequence its transport reforms to \nimprove the safety, efficiency, and quality of service; (iii) supporting private sector participation \nand partnership in infrastructure operation and management; (iv) improving sector governance, \nincluding  that  of  the  Chittagong  Port  Authority,  RHD,  and  Bangladesh  Railway;  and  (v) \npromoting subregional cooperation by developing strategic transport links and cross-border \narrangements. \n \n ", "    3\n10.  In line with this strategic direction, ADB\u2019s Bangladesh country strategy and program \n2006\u201320102 spelled out that  \n(i)  future ADB assistance in the sector would be linked to (a) continued institutional \nreform of RHD with due attention to improved governance and transparency \nincluding  capacity  building,  (b)  sustainable  financing  of  road  maintenance \nincluding the establishment of an appropriate mechanism for funding operation \nand maintenance (O&M), and (c) improved road safety; \n(ii)  support would be provided for the development of the Padma bridge, building on \nlessons learned from the path-breaking Jamuna Bridge Project; \n(iii)  this mega project would link the eastern and southwestern parts of Bangladesh \nat Mawa-Jajira to provide a strategic overland route between Bangladesh and its \nneighboring countries through India; and  \n(iv)  assistance would also be provided to identify opportunities to involve the private \nsector  to  ensure  that  the  bridge  is  operated  and  managed  on  a  financially \nsustainable basis. \n \n3.  Government\u2019s Strategy for Transport Sector Development \n \n11.  Road Transport. The critical problem facing the road sector is the maintenance and \nimprovement of the network to raise the quality and safety of road operations. Various options \nfor  financing  road  maintenance  and  operations  will  be  explored.  The  establishment  of  an \nautonomous road maintenance fund to ensure adequate and stable recurrent financing of roads \nwill be considered. The multi-modal transport system link will be expanded to include, among \nother areas, the Export Processing Zone and areas producing coal, hard rock, mining fertilizer, \ncement, and tea for the speedy and efficient movement of cargo and passengers. Monitoring \nindicators  will  be  set  to  assess  progress  in  such  key  areas  as  increased  allocations  for \nmaintenance and levels of cost recovery and more effective road traffic management to improve \nroad safety, traffic control, and overloading enforcement.  \n \n12.  The rural road network has reached an extent that makes it appropriate to invest in \nquality rather than expansion. This will mean greater emphasis on high-quality construction \nusing  labor-based  technologies,  maintaining  and  upgrading  the  existing  network,  and \nundertaking selective expansion to ensure balanced rural-urban linkages. In doing so, more \nemphasis needs to be given to developing growth centers and rural roads to connect villages \nwith growth centers and feeder roads, as well as providing rural roads with such drainage \nstructures as bridges and culverts. \n \n13.  The Government will accord priority to (i) increasing expenditures on maintenance; (ii) \nconstructing a coastal highway link; (iii) preparing an integrated road master plan with RHD, \nDhaka Transport Coordination Board, and LGED; (iv) establishing a national highway authority; \n(v) constructing the Padma bridge by JMBA; (vi) upgrading of Dhaka\u2013Chittagong, Dhaka\u2013\nKhulna, Dhaka\u2013Sylhet, and Dhaka\u2013Tangail roads to four lanes; (vii) constructing flyovers at \nrailway crossings on important highways; (viii) constructing the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong expressway; \nand (ix) constructing a ring road on the outskirts of Dhaka. \n \n14.  Railway  Transport.  The  role  of  Bangladesh  Railway  in  the  economy  has  been \nconstrained by its limited infrastructure and low efficiency of services vis-\u00e0-vis competing modes \nof transportation. Sustained reforms are to enhance the contribution of railways to the economy \nand to contain the adverse budgetary impact of its operations. The reconstruction of Bangladesh \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2005. Bangladesh: Country Strategy and Program 200-2010. Manila. \n \n ", "4   \nRailway\u2014including corporatization and commercialization with private participation\u2014are critical \nto developing the sector and improving the efficiency of services. Linking Bangladesh Railway \nwith the railways of neighboring countries through strategic partnership has a high potential for \ncatalyzing economic growth, poverty reduction, and the commercial viability of the sector. \n15.  The Government will place the emphasis on (i) reducing Bangladesh Railway\u2019s net \noperating loss and expanding its capacity for freight traffic, (ii) transparent accounting of system \nlosses at various level of operation, (iii) regaining passenger traffic, (iv) improving tracks and the \nsignaling system, (v) adopting public service obligation involving all branch lines to serve the \nlocal poor people in backward and remote areas, (vi) providing adequate funds for routine and \nperiodic maintenance, (vii) adopting modern methods of track maintenance, and (ix) outsourcing \ninfrastructure development and maintenance works to the private sector. \n \n16.  Inland Waterway Transport. The inland waterway system carries a large volume of \ntotal freight but is not used to its full potential due to the silting of waterways, lack of ghat \nberthing facilities, and obstructions caused by low or narrow road bridges and irrigation channel \nsluice gates. To better realize the full potential of the inland waterways, the following factors, \namong others, will be considered: (i) inter-project coordination to facilitate clearances under \nroad  bridges  and  the  needs  of  country  boats  in  siting  and  designing  sluice  gates,  (ii) \nencouraging local authorities to organize self-financed ghat facilities through user charges, and \n(iii) setting and enforcing standards for the bridge network and berthing facilities. \n \n17.  The Government will look into the possibility of (i) promoting private sector investment, \n(ii) improving cost recovery mechanisms, (iii) promoting water transportation in the south and \nwest zones, (iv) introducing computerized data processing, (v) providing necessary subsidies for \ncoastal passenger services, (vi) improving the operational efficiency of coastal routes, and (vii) \nintroducing sea truck and hydrofoil services to St. Martins Island. \n \n4.  Project Preparation Activities Undertaken  \n \n18.  In 2000, the Government conducted a pre-feasibility study for constructing a bridge \nacross the Padma River to connect the southwest zone to the north and east zones. The pre-\nfeasibility report3 established the technical and economic viability of the Padma bridge and \nrecommended several potential sites. In 2001, at the request of the Government, the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA) commenced a full-fledged feasibility study for the \nPadma bridge. In February 2004, the feasibility study team recommended in their interim report \nthe Mawa-Janjira site as the crossing location of the Padma bridge, which was concurred with \nand confirmed by the Government in July 2004. In 2005, the feasibility study team submitted \ntheir final report,4 which reaffirmed the technical and economic viability of the Padma bridge and \nrecommended the construction of (i) a two-lane dual carriageway cable-stayed (or extradosed) \nbridge measuring 5,580 m long and 25 m wide with provision of future rail tracks, (ii) a two-lane, \ndual carriageway approach road 12 km long and 25 m wide, and (iii) bank protection works \nalong 16.3 km of river. The estimated cost was $1.26 billion at 2004 prices.  \n \n19.  In the course of conducting the feasibility study, the Government requested key aid \nagencies\u2014i.e., the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), World Bank, and ADB\u2014to \nextend their support for the construction of the Padma bridge through a similar cofinancing \n                                                 \n3  Rendel, Palmer and Tritton, Nedeco, and Bangladesh Consultants Ltd. 2000. Padma Bridge Study-Prefeasibility \nReport.Tokyo.  \n4  Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2005. The Feasibility Study of the Padma Bridge. Tokyo. \n ", "    5\narrangement adopted for construction of the Jamuna bridge.5 The key aid agencies came to an \nunderstanding that (i) such a large project could hardly be financed by a single aid agency, (ii) \nthe exemplary donor coordination and cooperation rendered for constructing the Jamuna bridge \nshould be replicated for constructing the Padma bridge, and (iii) subsequent project preparation \nworks would be jointly coordinated through donors\u2019 local consultative group meetings.  \n \n20.  With  the  JICA  feasibility  study\u2019s  recommendation  in  hand  to  move  ahead,  the \nGovernment requested ADB to extend its support for TA to supplement JICA\u2019s feasibility study \nand a TA loan to supplement JICA\u2019s detailed design consultancy. In 2005, ADB provided TA6 to \ncomplement JICA\u2019s feasibility study, particularly for establishing the robust financial viability of \nthe Project and for developing a public-private partnership (PPP) scheme for financing with \ncommercial and revenue risks transferred to the private sector. The final TA report, issued in \nMay 2007, confirmed the technical and economic viability of the Padma bridge project with a \nmodified project cost of $1.48 billion at 2006 prices.  \n \n5.  External Assistance \n \n21.  JBIC, World Bank, Department for International Development (DFID), and JICA are \nmajor aid agencies that have supported the road sector in Bangladesh. The People\u2019s Republic \nof China, Denmark, Italy, Kuwait, Netherlands, and Switzerland also provided bilateral support. \nAid agency assistance has been closely coordinated through local consultative group meetings \nthat address all issues related to the road sector. JBIC, World Bank, and ADB supported the \nconstruction of the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge, which was the most expensive and one of the \nmost technically challenging transport infrastructure investment ever attempted in Bangladesh. \nJBIC  financed  the  construction  of  the  Paksey  and  Rupsa  bridges,  which  connected  the \nnorthwest  to  the  southwest  and  help  direct  cross-border  traffic  from  Nepal  and  Bhutan  to \nMongla  Port.  With  these  bridges  constructed,  ADB\u2019s  Road  Network  Improvement  and \nMaintenance Project in the northwest and initiative to facilitate cross-border traffic through \nBangladesh came to have more critical development impact. External assistance to the road \nsector is summarized in Appendix 3. \n \n6.  Lessons Learned \n \n22.  The project completion report7 of the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Project spelled out \ncritical factors for the successful delivery of such a large-scale multipurpose bridge project as \nfollows:  \n(i)  Project  preparation  should  adopt  a  participatory  approach  involving  all \nstakeholders,  particularly  for  preparing  environmental  and  social  mitigation \nmeasures. \n(ii)  The successful implementation of large and complex projects critically requires a \ncapable executing agency with strong project-management skills supported by \ngood consultants, which requires in turn more attention and resources invested in \ncapacity building and the institutional development of the executing agency. \n(iii)  Project  design  should  address  expected  impacts  on  poverty  and  contain  a \nmethodology  and  procedure  for  collecting  and  analyzing  data  required  for \nevaluating impacts on and benefits for the poor.  \n                                                 \n5  For the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Project, JBIC, World Bank, and ADB each committed $200 million. The \nproject ended up with the actual cost of $753.7 million funded with $200 million from JBIC, $199.1 million from the \nWorld Bank, $207.0 from ADB, and $147.6 million in Government counterfunding. \n6  ADB. 2005. Bangladesh: Preparing the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project. Manila.  \n7  ADB. 2000. Bangladesh: Jamuna Multipurpose Project Completion Report. Manila. \n \n ", "6   \n23.  In  2001,  ADB  provided  TA8  for  the  Jamuna  Bridge  Impact  Study.  The  TA  report \nrecommended the following aspects be considered in the design and construction of the Padma \nbridge: \n(i)  There should be greater attention paid to social and environmental components \nin  the  project  design  stage.  The  preparation  and,  more  importantly, \nimplementation of the social and environmental components of large civil works \nprojects must be given the same attention as the preparation of the physical \ncomponents. \n(ii)  The management structure is of critical importance to the implementation of \nenvironmental and social aspects of the project. The establishment of social and \nenvironmental units within the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority (JMBA), \nwith the necessary staff and support from the management consultants, was \ninstrumental in enabling the implementation of the plans for resettlement, land \nacquisition, and environment management. \n(iii)  Poverty reduction should be more overtly recognized as going beyond the goal of \nmerely not inflicting economic damage. The Jamuna bridge resettlement program \nattempted to improve the lot of impoverished affected people who did not own \nhomesteads  but  lost  their  place  of  residence  by  providing  squatters  with  a \nhomestead plot of 100 square meters either through the purchase of private land \nor at a resettlement site. \n(iv)  Project-induced increases in demand for land and the subsequent impact on \nproperty values should be taken into account both as a positive means of cross-\nsubsidizing poverty reduction in the design of the Padma bridge and in terms of \ntheir adverse impacts on, and compensation paid to, relocated people thrown \nonto the open market.  \n(v)  Compensation packages should take into account worsening land scarcity and \nhigher property values. The cash-for-land policy was widely acclaimed because it \nreduced the risks associated with occupational changes but is likely to achieve its \nobjectives only if property values are adequately taken into account.  \n(vi)  A large-scale infrastructure project such as the Padma bridge should be broadly \nconceived  in  economic  development  terms.  Land  resource  opportunities \ngenerated by the Padma bridge should be analyzed in a broader context than \nnarrowly focused transport economics and incorporated into the project design. \n \n24.  The terms of reference for the detailed design take into account the lessons learned \nthrough  the  Jamuna  Multipurpose  Bridge,  particularly  the  importance  of  the  participatory \napproach to be undertaken at a pre-design stage, the implementation of environmental and \nsocial aspects of the project, and institutional capacity development.   \n \n7.  Policy Dialogue \n \n25.  Policy  dialogue  was  conducted  with  the  Government  to  determine  institutional \narrangements for the design and construction of the Padma bridge and its operation after \nconstruction. The Government will  \n(i)  establish  a  competent  bridge  authority  through  a  restructured  JMBA  to  be \nheaded by an executive director, who will be the secretary of bridge division \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2001.

THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n26.  The TA loan will be to facilitate project preparation for an investment loan to construct \nthe Padma bridge connecting the economically depressed southwest zone to the economically \nmore advanced eastern zone of the country. It will minimize technical uncertainty and ensure \nreadiness  to  implement  the  follow-on  loan  project.  The  follow-on  project  will  help  the \nGovernment  achieve  poverty  reduction  through  economic  growth  by  improving  transport \nefficiency and strengthening integrated road networks. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n27.  The Project will develop detailed design of the Padma bridge, including river-training \nworks and approach roads, and assist JMBA in engaging contractors, which will be carried out \nthrough four continual processes of (i) scheme design, (ii) technical studies, (iii) detail design, \nand (iv) tender action.  \n \n1.  Scheme Design \n \n28.  Notwithstanding previous feasibility studies, the Project will develop outline designs for \ndifferent options for the main bridge, approach roads, and the river-training works to enable the \noptions to be objectively compared with each other. Each option will be developed in sufficient \ndetail to demonstrate that the project objectives and design criteria have been complied with, \nallow accurate estimation of construction costs, and enable a detailed construction program to \nbe prepared. Then an objective method for comparing the options will be formulated to select \nthe preferred scheme design.  \n \n29.  To develop different options for scheme designs, design criteria should be established. \nIn the process of scheme design, the Project will prepare comprehensive design criteria that \nachieve the objectives of the Project. The design criteria will include all rail-related elements \nincluding track and track-support systems regardless of whether or not the railway will be \ninstalled immediately following completion of the crossing. Similarly the design criteria shall \ninclude all aspects relating to the installation or future installation of utilities on the bridge. It \n                                                 \n9  The Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority Ordinance 1985, as amended up to 23 November 1998, \nassigns the executive director of JMBA as a member-cum-secretary of the authority while including a \nsecretary of MOC as a member-cum-vice chairman of the authority. This structure effectively places the \nexecutive director, the chief executive of JMBA, under the secretary of MOC, which weakens the chief \nexecutive of JMBA and makes JMBA\u2019s business processes ineffective.  \n \n ", "8   \nshould clearly state all assumptions regarding loads imposed on the bridge and the expected \nbridge movements so that the effects of these movements can be accounted for in the design \nof the utilities. Preliminary design criteria are in Appendix 4. \n \n30.  As  part  of  scheme  design,  (i)  a  comprehensive  and  detailed  cost  estimate  will  be \nprepared, (ii) an economic and financial evaluation model will be developed comparable to \nthose produced in the earlier feasibility studies to verify the economic and financial viability of \nthe scheme designs, (iii) a strategy for the Padma bridge will be developed for JMBA to contact \nout O&M including toll collection after construction; and (iv) possibilities for PPP for either \nconstruction or O&M of the bridge will be looked into\u2014probably, for the former, through gap \nfunding arrangements.  \n \n31.  The outputs of this stage include (i) confirmation of the scope of construction works; (ii) a \nreport on possibilities for PPP; (iii) confirmation of contract strategy; (iv) a final alignment; (v) \nupdated  plans  for  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  environment  management;  (vi)  an \nenvironmental impact assessment and environment management plan for the Padma bridge \nand new resettlement sites; (vii) design criteria; (viii) a project cost estimate and cost sensitivity \nanalysis; (ix) technical specifications and tender documents for technical studies; (x) an O&M \nstrategy;  (xi)  an  economic  and  financial  evaluation;  (xii) a  scheme design  report  including \nscheme design drawings and performance specifications for proprietary elements and typical \ndetails; and (xiii) photomontage or computer-generated images showing the proposed scheme.  \n \n2.  Technical Studies \n \n32.  Technical studies prior to or during the detailed design phase will be needed to provide \nimportant information that will reduce uncertainty associated with technical and commercial \naspects of the Project. The technical studies will include (i) geotechnical investigations; (ii) wind \ntunnel testing; (iii) topographic surveying; (iv) bathymetric surveying: and (v) river flow, scour \nand hydrological studies, and physical modeling. The Project will determine the extent of the \nstudies listed above and any other studies considered appropriate to the overall objective of \nreducing risk to an acceptable level.  \n \n33.  Once technical studies are completed, the technical, commercial, economic, and other \nimplications of the results will be assessed. This will lead to the revision of the design criteria, \nupdating of scheme designs,  and  updating of the project cost estimate as required to reflect \nthe results of the studies. In addition, interpretative reports summarizing the engineering issues \narising from the technical studies will be prepared, including geotechnical interpretative reports, \naerodynamic stability reports, and any other reports required to assist with the timely and \nefficient progress of contractor engagement.  \n \n34.  The outputs of this stage will include (i) interpretative reports for all technical studies and \n(ii) an assessment of implications on scheme design including, where relevant, changes to (a) \ndesign criteria, (b) the scheme design report, (c) the project cost estimate and cost sensitivity \nanalysis, (d) the economic and financial evaluation, and (e) other relevant findings. \n \n3.  Detailed Design \n \n35.  The Project will prepare the detailed engineering design and all tender documentation \nfor all of the works based on the selected final scheme design using state-of-the-art techniques, \nmethods, and standards to produce an efficient, robust, and buildable design that complies fully \nwith the agreed design criteria in conformity with international codes and standards and, where \n ", "    9\nrelevant, published design and detailing guides. The detailed engineering design will show what \nassumptions have been made regarding the construction sequence and methods and, where \nrelevant,  assumptions  regarding  creep,  shrinkage,  and  other  time-dependent  effects.  The \ndesign and specifications will state the pre-cambers required or alternately specify requirements \nfor the contractor to determine pre-cambers or casting curves. As part of detailed engineering \ndesign,  illustrative  designs,  design  specifications,  and  construction  specifications  will  be \nprepared, on the basis of which the project cost estimate and the O&M cost estimate will be \nupdated.  \n \n36.  All  contract  documents  for  each  construction  contract  will  be  prepared  including \nmaterials and workmanship specifications, bills of quantities, instructions to tenderers, and any \nfurther  documentation  required  to  complete  the  tender  packages.  The  design  will  be \naccompanied by a comprehensive standalone materials and workmanship specification. The \nspecification will utilize, wherever possible and appropriate, international codes or standards for \nsupplying component materials, measuring, and testing. The specification will include tolerances \nthat reflect assumptions made in the design. Conditions will be prepared for each contract \nbased on an agreed standard form such as one published by FIDIC. \n \n37.  The outputs of this stage will include (i) detailed engineering design drawings for all \nelements  of  the  works  sufficient  to  enable  construction  to  progress,  (ii)  materials  and \nworkmanship specifications, (iii) final design criteria, (iv) design reports, (v) design certificates, \n(vi) bills of quantities and schedules of activities, (vii) contract conditions, (viii) instructions to \ntenderers, (ix) all further tender documents sufficient to permit competitive tenders to be sought \nin the international market, (x) a project cost estimate and expenditure profile, (xi) an O&M \nmanual, and (xii) estimates of future bridge O&M costs. \n \n4.  Tender Action \n \n38.  The  Project  will  assist  JMBA  with  the  prequalification  procedure  for  each  of  the \ncontracts, which will include preparing prequalification and selection criteria, assistance with \nadvertising, reviewing and assessing submissions, interviewing, and preparing a prequalification \nreport. The Project will prepare, in advance, a tender evaluation strategy based on agreed \ntechnical  and  commercial  criteria,  and  assist  JMBA  in  assessing  all  tenders  and  making \nrecommendations as to which contractor should be selected for each contract. \n \n39.  The outputs of this stage will include (i) contractor prequalification and selection criteria; \n(ii) comprehensive responses to all tender queries; (iii) a tender evaluation strategy; (iv) a tender \nassessment report, where relevant, including (a) technical evaluation of construction proposals, \n(b) financial evaluation of commercial proposals, and (c) review of construction schedule and  \nresource mobilization; and (v) final contract documentation.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n40.  Throughout the design stages, the work of detailed engineering design consultants will \nbe reviewed, monitored, checked, and guided by two sets of external monitoring arrangements \nto ensure that the final output of the design consultants meets project objectives. Firstly, the \nProject  will  engage  a  team  of  checking  engineers  who  will  review  the  design  criteria, \nspecifications, drawings, and other documents submitted by the design consultants and check \nthe detailed design to ensure that it meets the project objectives and is safe, buildable, and \neconomic. The checking engineers will perform a fully independent structural analysis, both \nstatic and dynamic, to determine the load effects in the structure and to check the compliance of \n \n ", "10   \nthe design with requirements and design criteria. The checking engineers will be separately \nengaged by JMBA.   \n \n41.   Secondly, the Project will establish an independent panel of experts (POE) to guide, \nmonitor, and advise on the detailed design. The POE will consist of internationally recognized \nexperts  in  various  specialties  required  by  the  Project  and  will  be  selected  by  JMBA  in \nconsultation with the development partners including ADB, World Bank, JBIC, and JICA. The \nPOE will be an effective means of ensuring transparency and governance in determining the \nalignment of the bridge and the access roads and the scope of river-training works, which will \nhave considerable socioeconomic implications on the economy at large as well as on potentially \naffected people. The POE will meet with the design consultants at regular intervals throughout \nall phases of the Project and may request additional justification from the design consultants for \nany aspect of the Project.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan  \n \n42.  The project investment cost is estimated at $22.0 million equivalent, including taxes and \nduties of $2.8 million. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 5. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amountsa\nA.  Base Costb  \n  1.  Detailed Design Consultant  16.9 \n  2.

Financing Plan \n \n43.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $17.6 million equivalent from its Special Funds \nresources. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years and an \ninterest charge of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The \nGovernment will transfer the loan proceeds to the Executing Agency, JMBA, through its fiscal \nbudgetary allocation in the form of a government grant. \n ", "    11\n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  17.6  80 \nGovernment  4.4  20 \n  Total  22.0  100 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n44.  JMBA will be the Executing Agency of the Project. A project implementation unit (PIU) \nwill be established under JMBA, which will be headed by the project director (chief engineer \nlevel) supported by a deputy project director, project engineers as required, a finance and \naccounting staffer, and an administrative staffer. The PIU will be supported by two sets of \nindependent  monitoring  arrangements.  Checking  engineers  will  be  engaged  and  assigned \noutside of the PIU to independently review the design criteria, specifications, drawings, and \nother documents submitted by the design consultants and check the detailed design to ensure \nthat it meets project objectives. The POE will be established\u2014again outside of the PIU\u2014to \nindependently guide, monitor, and advise on the detailed design.  \n \n45.  The PIU will (i) monitor the progress of day-to-day project implementation, (ii) provide \nassistance to the design consultant team in carrying out their tasks, (iii) act as a coordinator for \nchecking engineers and the POE so that they can function properly, (iv) prepare withdrawal \napplications for design consultants, (v) prepare project progress and status reports as required, \nand (vi) maintain project accounts and loan financial records for auditing. The structure of \nproject implementation arrangements is in Appendix 6. \n  \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n46.  The Project will be implemented over 2 years from March 2008 to February 2010. \nDetails of the implementation schedule are in Appendix 7. \n \n3.  Consulting Services \n \n47.  An international consulting firm associated with national consulting firms will prepare \nscheme designs; conduct necessary technical studies; develop detailed engineering design and \ntender documents for the main bridge, approach roads, and river-training works; and assist \nJMBA in undertaking tender actions including contractor prequalification, the preparation of \nselection criteria, tender evaluation, and final contract documentation. About 545 person-months \nof international and 399 person-months of national consulting services will be required for \nvarious experts. Outline terms of reference for these services are in Appendix 8. Detailed terms \nof reference are in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n48.  The consultants will be selected and appointed by the quality-based selection method \nusing full technical proposals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The quality-based selection method is adopted because \nthe  detailed  design  entails  high  failure  costs,  which  would  have  significantly  impact \n \n ", "12   \ncommunities,  the  environment,  and  government  finances.  It  is  envisaged  that  the  detailed \ndesign consultant, subject to satisfactory performance, may be engaged as the construction \nsupervisor under the follow-on loan. The contract for the Project will cover only detailed design. \nThe procurement plan is in Appendix 9. \n \n49.  At the request of the Government, ADB will carry out consultant selection for the design \nconsultant on behalf of the Government, while the Government will retain its authority for \ncontract negotiation and contract signing. After the completion of the Jamuna Multipurpose \nBridge, JMBA was downsized and has mainly carried out O&M of the Jamuna Multipurpose \nBridge. JMBA\u2019s staff skills mix has been realigned in line with the change in its core function \nfrom managing the construction of a large bridge to its O&M. While JMBA\u2019s staff strength will be \nupgraded as it undertakes the construction of the Padma bridge, its current capacity is hardly on \na par with complex construction management works. Considering insufficient capacity in JMBA, \nand that stakeholders cannot afford to delay consultant recruitment, the Government and ADB \nagreed  that  ADB  would  carry  out  consultant  recruitment  and  selection  on  behalf  of  the \nGovernment. \n \n50.  The POE, consisting of internationally recognized experts in various specialties required \nby the Project, will be selected by JMBA in consultation with the local donors\u2019 group including \nADB, World Bank, JBIC, and JICA. The composition of the POE, comprising approximately 50 \nperson-months, is expected to include experts with skills in bridge and structural engineering, \nhighway engineering, river training works, environment and resettlement impact assessment, \nand structured financing for concession arrangements. Recruitment will be carried out on an \nindividual basis, as no firm would be able to assemble a team of internationally reputed experts \nrequired  for  the  POE,  each  of  whose  contribution  depends  on  individual  experiences  and \nknowledge. The outline terms of reference for the POE are in Appendix 10. \n \n51.  A firm of senior engineers, with total inputs of about 70 person-months, will be recruited \nas the checking engineers using the quality- and cost-based method. The checking engineers \nwill review and comment on (i) design drawings, (ii) design statements or reports, (iii) design \ncriteria documents, (iv) site survey and geotechnical investigation reports, (v) materials and \nworkmanship specifications, (vi) wind tunnel test proposals and reports, (vii) the scope and \nrequirements  of  all  technical  studies  and  any  special  investigations  proposed,  (viii)  the \nconstruction  method  and  erection  sequence  assumptions,  (ix)  other  reports  relating  to  the \ndesign and construction, and (x) the design program and project management information. The \nterms of reference (TOR) of the checking engineers will be developed by the design consultant, \nand will be reviewed and recommended by the POE to JMBA.  \n \n4.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n52.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  Government  and  JMBA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of JMBA and consultants and other service \nproviders  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The  Government  will  also  allow  and  assist  ADB \nrepresentatives\u2019 carrying out random spot checks on the work in progress and the utilization of \nfunds for the Project. \n ", "    13\n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n53.  Loan funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). An imprest account will be established under JMBA to \ndisburse the incremental administrative support component in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. The initial amount to be deposited into the imprest account will be 6 \nmonths of estimated expenditures or 10% of the loan amount allocated for the incremental \nadministrative support component, whichever is lower. Statement of expenditure procedures will \nbe  used  for  reimbursing  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidating  the  imprest  account  for  any \nindividual payment transaction up to $3,000 equivalent. The ceiling for statement of expenditure \nwill be in line with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) \nand applicable for contracts below $100,000. \n  \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \na.  Accounts and Audit \n \n54.  JMBA will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and \nservices financed from loan proceeds, financing resources received, expenditures incurred for \nthe Project, and local funds. The accounts will be set up in accordance with sound accounting \nprinciples.  In  addition  to  the  audit  conducted  by  the  comptroller  and  auditor  general, \nconsolidated  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  by \nrecognized private sector auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited reports and related financial \nstatements will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to \nwhich they relate.  \n \nb.  Reports \n \n55.  The consultant appointed under the Project will submit monthly progress reports to \nJMBA and ADB. JMBA will ensure that the consultant includes in the reports the status of land \nacquisition and resettlement and other activities that will take place concurrently with project \nimplementation but are not directly included in the scope of engineering services. Within 3 \nmonths of the Project\u2019s physical completion, the Government will prepare a completion report in \na format acceptable to ADB. \n \n7.  Project Review \n \n56.  ADB staff will review project implementation through regular or special review missions. \nBased  on  the  project  schedule,  a  mid-term  review  will  be  carried  out  around  January  or \nFebruary  2009.  Terms  of  reference  for  the midterm  review  will  be  included  in  the  project \nadministration memorandum to be prepared by ADB\u2019s inception mission for the Project.  \n \n \n ", "14   \n8.  Advance Action on Recruitment of Consultants  \n \n57.  ADB allows advanced recruitment of consultants for detailed design and construction \nsupervision on the understanding that such action will not necessarily commit ADB to financing \nthe Project or the ensuing investment project.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Socioeconomic Benefits and Impacts \n \n58.  The Padma bridge will be a large-scale infrastructure project, and its construction and \noperation will significantly benefit various sectors of the economy of Bangladesh nationally and \nregionally. The road distance from Dhaka to nearly all major destinations in the southwest \nregion will be reduced by 100 kilometers (km) or more, which will bring tremendous savings in \npassenger  and  commodity  movement  time  and  costs,  as  well  as  vehicle  operation  and \nmaintenance costs, while lengthening the useful life of vehicles and reducing the import bill for \nfuels. With the bridge, capital inflow will increase, promoting industrial and commercial activity \nand improving economic and employment opportunities for local people, who will also gain \nbetter access to healthcare facilities and modern health technologies available at Dhaka. Easier \ncommunication  will  help  expand  education  and  training  facilities,  and  the  resulting  skills \ndevelopment will ensure the availability of high-quality workers. The export of skilled workers will \nincrease wage earnings. Riverbank protection will reduce bank erosion and the incidence of \nworsened vulnerability and poverty among people displaced by erosion. During construction, \nunemployed local people will get employment, and increased commercial activity will facilitate \nincome generation among locals. The country will be physically integrated through the fixed link, \nreducing economic disparity and deprivation. An estimate of multiplier effects on the Padma \nbridge investment shows the bridge increasing the national GDP growth rate by 1.2% and the \ngross product in the southwest region by 35%, as well as generating additional employment \nopportunities of 743,000 person-years, which equals 1.2% of the total labor force of Bangladesh \n(footnote 2). The economic internal rate of return of the main investment was estimated at \n14.8% by the JICA study (footnote 2) and at 17.6% by ADB\u2019s supplementary TA (footnote 4) \n \n59.  The southwest region has one of the highest poverty rates in a poverty-stricken country. \nAbout 42% of the national population lived in March 2004 below the absolute poverty line. In \nKhulna Division in the southwest, the poverty incidence was 46%, which is much higher than \nDhaka\u2019s  33%.  The  poor  in  the  project  area  will  reap  immediate  benefits  from  the  bridge \nconstruction in the form of employment during construction, additional employment in relocated \nrelated activities, subsistence allowances and other benefits from resettlement, and increased \ntrading  income  during  construction.  In  the  long-term,  the  impact  of  the  bridge  on  poverty \nreduction will be even more significant, as the economic benefits generated by the bridge and \naccruing to the poor will be greater than their share of the GDP. The summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \nB.  Land Acquisition, Resettlement, and Environmental Impact \n \n60.  An assessment of land acquisition and resettlement conducted as part of the feasibility \nstudy found that the project will need to acquire 755 hectares (ha) of land for the construction of \nthe bridge and its associated infrastructure, including the development of five resettlement sites. \nIn addition, about 163 ha of land will be temporarily required for construction sites for a period of \nabout 6 years. The project also requires the acquisition of bank-line and eroded land. The \nassessment predicts that (i) the project will displace about 20,000 people from their homesteads \n ", "    15\nand business enterprises, (ii) 30,000 people in 10,000 households will lose their income and \nlivelihoods due to the loss of agricultural land, and (iii) 25,000 people will suffer income loss \nfrom affected fisheries, services, trading and transportation, and wage employment. Some of \nthese people will be affected indirectly upon the opening of the bridge to traffic. Altogether, \nabout 75,000 people in 22,000 households will be affected directly and indirectly.  \n \n61.  The Land Acquisition Ordinance of 1982 establishes procedures to redress grievances \narising out of ownership of land. Recourse to law is, however, always a complicated and time-\nconsuming process, which usually discriminates against the poor for their lack of knowledge and \nresources  for  litigation.  Some  grievances  can  be  easily  resolved  out  of  court  through  a \ntraditional grievance redress mechanism, i.e., a community-based grievance redress committee, \nwhich proved its effectiveness for the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Project. Grievance redress \ncommittees will be established in each union where land acquisition will take place. Each \ncommittee will consist of (i) a representative of JMBA, at the level of deputy director or assistant \ndirector;  (ii)  the  area  manager  of  the  implementing  nongovernment  organization;  (iii)  the \nchairman of the union parishad where the complaint is registered; (iv) one representative of \naffected people; (v) a female member of the local union parishad; (vi) a headmaster of a local \nhigh school primary school and (vii) a representative from concerned deputy commissioner \noffice.  The  committee  will  be  constituted  under  an  administrative  order  of  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications. The main task of the committee will be to hear the grievances of individuals \naffected by land acquisition. Where a grievance relates to the issues covered by the arbitration \nprocedures outlined in the Land Acquisition Ordinance of 1982, the committee will advise the \ncomplainant to seek redress in the appropriate court of law. Where a grievance relates to \nproject-specific definition of entitlements and entitled persons, the committee is empowered to \ngive a verdict that will be final. \n \n62.   While the proposed TA loan is classified as a \u201cC\u201d project, the proposed investment is \nclassified as an \u201cA\u201d project in accordance to the ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Requirement \n2003. The proposed investment is also classified as a red project in accordance with the \nBangladesh  Environmental  Conservation  Act  1995.  Therefore,  the  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA) will be updated for the Padma bridge during detailed design. In addition, the \nEIA for the new resettlement site will also be updated in accordance with ADB\u2019s environmental \nrequirements.  The  EIA  for  the  Padma  bridge  and  new  resettlement  site,  including  the \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) will be prepared in accordance with the Government \nand ADB\u2019s environmental assessment requirement. The feasibility study included the initial EIA, \nthe findings of which will be used as a basis to determine the scope of the EIA. The EIA report, \nincluding the EMP, that will be updated as part of this detailed design funded by this proposed \nloan  will  be  submitted  to  the  Department  of  Environment  as  the  basis  for  obtaining \nenvironmental clearance.  \n \n63.  The salient findings from the initial environmental assessment study were reported as \npart of the feasibility study but have not yet been included in the proposed mitigation measures \nand proper management plan. The salient findings include the following:  \n(i)  The impact of the bridge on regional hydrology and flooding patterns, as the \nhigh-water level of the Padma River rises due to the bridge construction, is not \nexpected to be significant, but detailed assessment will be required. \n(ii)  Adequate openings on the planned right bank approach road are required for \ndrainage. \n(iii)  Limited  erosion  and  siltation  is  expected,  but  detailed  assessment  will  be \nrequired. \n \n ", "16   \n(iv)  About 325,000 trees will need to be cut for the Project, requiring a detailed \nassessment to identify appropriate mitigation measures. \n(v)  About  58  ponds  covering  4.18  ha  and  74  ditches  covering  2.66  ha  will  be \naffected by the Project. \n(vi)  Fish production losses of about 11 tons per year may be compensated by fish \nculture in new ponds in borrow pits. \n(vii)  No ecologically protected and sensitive area will be affected by the investment \nproject, and there is no exclusive habitat of any endangered species near the \nProject site. However, the Padma River is  known as a secondary habitat of two \ncritically  endangered  species,  the  gangetic  gharial  and  dolphin,  whose  main \nhabitat is the Ganges River. \n(viii)  The Padma River is an important migratory route for hilsa fish.  \n \n64.  The Project will prepare a land acquisition plan, resettlement plan, EIA, and EMP on the \nbasis of the detailed design of the bridge, fully taking into consideration the lessons learned \nfrom  the  Jamuna  Multipurpose  Bridge  Project,  particularly  the  importance  of  adopting  a \nparticipatory approach during the pre-design stage and of institutional capacity development.  \n \nC.  Risks \n \n65.  The implementation of the Project should properly manage the following risks: \n(i)  The political and security situation could be unfavorable to the implementation of the \ndetailed  engineering  design  of  the  Project  and  to  the  country\u2019s  prioritization  of \nresources for the main construction project. ADB will need to closely monitor the \nsituation and coordinate with the local donors\u2019 group to ensure adequate protection.   \n(ii)  Timely provision of the Government\u2019s counterpart funding is essential for the safe \ndelivery of the Project on schedule but may be particularly at risk when the finances \nof the Government are squeezed.   \n(iii)  The  findings  from  the  social  and  environmental  impact  study  will  need  to  be \ndiscussed thoroughly with affected people during the stage of detailed design. To \nachieve smooth implementation of the investment, the environmental and social \nconcerns of affected people will need to be taken into account in developing the \nproject design.   \n(iv)  In view of the massive land acquisition and resettlement induced by the bridge and \nits associated infrastructure, the Government should allocate sufficient resources to \nplan,  operate,  and  manage  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  paying  particular \nattention to restoring affected people\u2019s livelihood in a country where land is scarce \nand  poverty  is  high.  The  detailed  design  consultants  will  develop  an  income-\nrestoration  program  to  address  livelihood  issues.  Since  governance  in  matters \nrelated to resettlement and land acquisition will be a risk, an external monitoring \nmechanism will be developed.   \n(v)  To strengthen project implementation capacity, JMBA should be restructured as a \ndivision  under  MOC  and  have  a  separate  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and \nenvironment  unit  as  proposed  by  the  Jamuna  Bridge  Impact  Study.  The  study \npointed out that the establishment of social and environmental units within JMBA, \nwith  the  necessary  staff  and  support  from  management  consultants,  was \ninstrumental in enabling the implementation of the resettlement, land acquisition, and \nenvironment management plans.  \n \n ", "    17\nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n66.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n67.  The Government will provide counterpart funding for the Project in a timely manner in \naccordance with its annual approved development plan allocation and in accordance with the \nproject financing plan. \n \n68.  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Plan.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  a \nresettlement plan is updated based on detailed design of the Project and in accordance with its \napplicable laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), Operation \nManual F2 on Involuntary Resettlement (2003), Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good \nPractice (1998), and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) and submit it to ADB for review and \napproval. \n \n69.  The Government will ensure that land acquisition to be undertaken during the detailed \ndesign stage proceed in accordance with its applicable laws and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement (1995) and Operation Manual F2 on Involuntary Resettlement (2003), as set out in \nthe agreed upon resettlement plan, which includes (i) compensation and entitlements to affected \npeople as stipulated in the resettlement plan; (ii) timely provision of funds and disbursements to \naffected people; (iii) adequate supervision, monitoring, and reporting by the JMBA; (iv) adequate \ninformation  dissemination  and  consultation  with  affected  people;  (v)  documentation  of \nconsultation and grievances; and (vi) regular reporting of progress to ADB. \n \n70.  The Government will ensure that the resettlement plan should include establishment of a \ngrievance redress committee in each union where land acquisition will take place. A grievance \nredress committee will consist of (i) a representative from JMBA at the level of deputy/assistant \ndirector, (ii) the area manager of nongovernment organization concerned, (iii) the chairperson of \nthe Union Parishad where the complaint is registered, (iv) a representative from affected people, \n(v) a woman member of the union Parishad, (vi) a head master of local high/primary school, and \n(vii)  a  representative  from  concerned  deputy  commissioner  office.  The  grievance  redress \ncommittee shall be entitled to give a verdict regarding a Project specific definition of entitlements \nand entitled persons.   \n \n71.  Environment. The Government will ensure that the EIA including the EMP for the \nproposed Padma Bridge and also for the new resettlement site are in accordance with the \nGovernment and ADB\u2019s environmental assessment requirement. The Government will ensure \nthat  adequate  consultation  with  affected  people  as  part  of  the  preparation  of  these \nenvironmental  assessment  studies  will  be  carried  out  and  the  environmental  concerns  of \naffected people will be addressed in the project design.  \n \n72.  Selection of Consultants. ADB will carry out consultant selection processes for the \ndesign consultant on behalf of the Government in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants,  while  the  Government  will  retain  its  authority  for  contract  negotiation  and \ncontract signing. In selecting the independent checking engineer and appointing members of \npanel of experts of Bangladesh nationality, the Government will obtain ADB\u2019s prior concurrence. \nIn appointing members of panel of experts, JMBA, will prepare a short list, which should be \napproved by ADB. \n \n ", "18   \n73.  Bid Documents. The Borrower will ensure that all works contract documents to be \nprepared under the Project for the ensuing investment project will incorporate provisions and \nbudget  to  the  effect  that  contractors  (i)  comply  with  all  applicable  labor  laws  and  related \ninternational treaty obligations and do not employ child labor, as defined under Bangladesh law; \n(ii) provide safe working conditions for male and female workers; (iii) implement the provisions \nset  forth  in  the  Project-specific  Gender  Strategy;  and  (iv)  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  and  human \ntrafficking prevention and awareness campaigns in the campsites and corridors of influence.  \n \n74.  Construction  Supervision.  The  Government  will  adopt  the  FIDIC  mechanism  for \nconstruction supervision. All design and construction contracts must adopt standard FIDIC \nforms of contract, which must be applied without any modification of the normal responsibilities \nof the parties. \n \n75.  Operation and Maintenance. The Government will develop a technically and financially \nsustainable  operation  and  maintenance  scheme  applicable  to  major  bridges  including  the \nPadma bridge. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n76.  Restructuring of JMBA. The Government will restructure JMBA to be headed by an \nexecutive director who will be the secretary of bridge division under MOC dealing with the \nauthority;  have  a  separate  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  environment  unit;  and  be \nsupported by capable staff resources. The restructuring of JMBA should be approved by the \nCabinet before the loan becomes effective.   \n \n77.  Subsidiary  Loan  Agreement.  The  Government  will  execute  the  subsidiary  loan \nagreement, prepared in a form and substance acceptable to ADB. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n78.

Overview of the Transport Sector \n1.  An adequate and efficient transport system is a prerequisite to economic development. It \nis  recognized  that  investment  to  improve  transport  efficiency  is  the  key  to  expanding  and \nintegrating markets. The transport system in Bangladesh comprises roads, railways, inland \nwaterways, two seaports, maritime shipping, and civil aviation. \n \n2.  Transport demand in Bangladesh has grown faster than the GDP, doubling between \n1974 and 1984 to 35 billion passenger-kilometers. In 1996, it reached 72 billion passenger-\nkilometers.  Freight  transport  has  increased  at  a  similar  rate  and  reached  10  billion  ton-\nkilometers in 1996. However, the shares of transport modes have not increased in the same \nproportion. The road sector carries the majority of passenger traffic, having increased from 54% \nin 1974 to 73% in 1996, mainly at the expense of rail. In the freight sector, transport by water is \nmore dominant but with a slightly eroding share of 37% in 1974 and 30% in 1996. In comparison, \nroad transport increased to 63% in 1996, again mainly at the expense of rail transport. Thus, the \nfaster expansion of the country\u2019s road network, as well as the increase in road vehicle numbers, \nhas made the road sector dominant, though freight transport by water remains substantial. \n \n3.  The transport sector in Bangladesh is confronted with numerous problems. Some are \ncommon to all sub-sectors while some are sub-sector specific. Major common problems are the \nfollowing:  \n(i)  Physical constraints. These arise from difficult terrain, numerous river crossings, \nperiodic flooding, poor soil condition, siltation and erosion of rivers, riverbank \nsliding, etc. \n(ii)  Maintenance deficiencies. Proper maintenance and timely rehabilitation of the \ntransport network, rolling stock, and capital assets is lacking. Development funds \nare  allocated  largely  by  the  Planning  Commission,  while  the  funds  for \nmaintenance  are  allocated  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  as  part  of  current \nexpenditure.  There  is  very  little coordination  between  these  two  agencies  in \ndetermining development and maintenance allocations. \n(iii)  Unrealistic pricing policy. Although pricing should ideally be based on cost \nrecovery, in reality it is not commensurate to the cost of providing services. Fares \nand rates in all transport sub-sectors are fixed well below the combined cost of \ntransport. This has resulted in perpetual losses in the total transport sector and \nput pressure on the total allocation for other sectors of the economy.  \n(iv)  Inherent weaknesses of the institutional and policy framework. These have \nturned the transport parastatals into perpetual loss-making concerns. \n(v)  Poor liquidity position of most of the transport sector parastatals. Almost all \nparastatals  have  accumulated  substantial  long-term  debts.  Poor  financial \nperformance has caused debt servicing by the parastatals to deteriorate, placing \na heavy burden on the government budget. \n(vi)  Waste  of  resources  because  of  incoherent  planning.  Allocations  to  the \ntransport sector during planning rarely considers inter-modal priorities based on \ncost effectiveness and an optimal modal mix. \n(vii)  Investment and operation problems. These arise from inadequate coordination \namong ministries and parastatals.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  21\nB.  Subsector Profile \n \n1.  Road Sector \n \n4.  The Government\u2019s responsibility for roads is divided between the Roads and Highways \nDepartment (RHD), which is responsible for the planning, construction, and maintenance of \nnational highways, regional highways, and zila roads (formerly feeder road A), and the Local \nGovernment Engineering Department (LGED), which is responsible for upazila roads, union \nroads, and village roads (formerly feeder road B). \n \n5.  National highways connect the national capital with district headquarters, port cities, and \ninternational highways. Regional highways connect different regions and district headquarters \nnot connected by national highways. Feeder roads are of two types, namely zila roads (formerly \nfeeder road A) and upazila roads, union roads, and village roads (formerly feeder road B). Zila \nroads  connect  the  thana  headquarters  with  upazila  headquarters.  Upazila  roads  connect \nimportant  growth  centers  to  the  main  arterial  road  network.  Union  roads  connect  union \nheadquarters with growth centers or local markets or with each other. Village roads connect \nvillages with union headquarters, local markets, farms, and ghats or with each other. \n \n6.  In mid-2003, the total length of road network under RHD was 21,000 kilometers (km), of \nwhich 12,500 km was paved and 8,500 km was earthen. National highways total 3,090 km \n(15%), regional highways 1,750 km (8%), and feeder roads 16,000 km (77%). At the end of \n2000, the total length of different categories of road under LGED stood at 41,179 km (62%) \npaved and 24,717 km (38%) earthen. \n \n7.  Table 1 shows the number of vehicles registered in Bangladesh over a recent 6-year \nperiod. Non-motorized vehicles are regulated by local authorities, and their actual number is \nunknown. The table below indicates that some 594,000 vehicles were registered in 2001, with \n46% being motorcycles. Few motorcycles can be observed in the Dhaka region, as they are \nmore abundant mainly in northern areas of the country. While buses and microbuses make up \nonly 5% of vehicles, they are important for carrying large numbers of passengers over long \ndistances. \n \nTable A2.1: Number of Registered Vehicles in Bangladesh \nAAGR \nType  1995  1996  1997  1998  1999  2000  2001 \n(%) \nCar/Taxi  63,218  74,493  82,861  88,840  94,042  98,682  106,028  9.09 \nJeep/Microbus  29,207  32,015  33,774  36,479  38,748  40,260  43,337  6.81 \nBus  13,406  13,287  13,386  13,762  13,939  14,269  14,859  1.74 \nMinibus  10,466  11,052  11,918  12,520  12,999  13,399  14,597  5.72 \nTruck  33,210  35,475  36,257  38,990  41,008  43,728  46,203  5.67 \nAutorickshaw/Tempo  52,340  62,548  69,094  73,497  75,637  78,767  79,144  7.31 \nMotorcycle   178,257   188,669   200,749   215,274   231,785   246,395   271,204  7.25 \nOther  8,161  8,685  10,286  11,534  14,151  15,511  18,402   14.65 \nTotal  388,265  426,224  458,325  490,896  522,309  551,011  593,774  7.34 \nAAGR = annual average growth rate. \nSource: Bangladesh Road Transport Authority. \n \n8.  Whereas in 1971 there were around 40,000 motor vehicles, at present there are almost \n600,000, following an average growth rate of around 10% per year. In the future, as the country \nbecomes more prosperous, high growth can be expected in light vehicles. Different vehicles \n \n ", "22  Appendix 2 \nhave different rates of utilization. For example, in Bangladesh commercial vehicles, and in \nparticular buses, are used intensively. Large buses operating on intercity routes are utilized up \nto 80% of the time, while most other vehicles average around 60% utilization. \n \n9.  The main problems associated with road transport are (i) inadequate allocation of funds \nfor the maintenance of roads and vehicles; (ii) losses due to operating old, dilapidated vehicles; \n(iii) heavy management with excess manpower; (iv) poor maintenance and rehabilitation of road \ninfrastructure; (v) poor administration of road safety measures and environmental issues; (vi) \nmixing of motorized and non-motorized traffic; (vii) lack of all weather accessibility because of \nhigh investment costs due to periodic flooding and the consequent height requirement of road \nembankments; and (viii) numerous river crossings requiring many bridges and/or ferry links. \n \n2.  Railway Sector \n \n10.  Bangladesh Railway is the only mode of transport operated by the public sector. Rail \ntransport consists of both broad-gauge and meter-gauge lines. Broad gauge accounts for 34%, \nwhile meter gauge accounts for 66%. Bangladesh railway operates all over the country through \n255 stations in the eastern region and 234 stations in the western region. Bangladesh Railway \nprovides three types of rail services: intercity, mail express, and local passenger. In FY1995, \nintercity trains carried 22% of total rail passengers, express trains 39%, and local trains 39%. \nRailway freight traffic has declined over the years. In 1969 freight traffic carried by rail was about \n4.9 million tons, declining by 1994 to 2.7 million tons. Ton-km has also reduced over the years. \nNet ton-kms in 1994/95 stood at 759 million, declining from 1,265 million in 1969/70. Railway \nfreight traffic constituted only 7% of the total freight traffic in 1996/97. Major commodities carried \nby rail are food grain, fertilizer, cement, coal, stone and ballast, petroleum products, jute, salt, \nand sugarcane. \n \n11.  A notable improvement in the rail network is provided by Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge. In \nAugust 2003 the rail link opened over this bridge from Dhaka to the northwest region, but only \nfor passenger services. \n \n12.  The  main  problems  associated  with  rail  transport  are  (i)  financial  losses  with  the \ndiversion  of  passenger  and  freight  traffic  from  rail  transport  to  road  transport;  (ii)  excess \noverhead expenditures, low operating revenue, and high operating costs; (iii) losses from ticket-\nless travel, especially on local trains; (iv) poor operational efficiency because of inadequate fund \nallocation  for  the  maintenance  of  tracks  and  rolling  stocks;  and  (v)  the  failure  of  railway \nmanagement to operate railways with commercial considerations. \n \n3.  Inland Waterway Sector \n \n13.  The  basic  inland  waterway  transport  system  comprises  a  triangle  of  two  seaports, \nChittagong and Mongla, with the Dhaka-Narayanganj metropolitan area. While the total length of \nwaterways is around 14,000 km, the length of navigable waterways is 5,968 km in the rainy \nseason and 3,600 km in the dry season. There are 23 coastal island ports and seven ferry ghats \nlocated  at  Paturia,  Nagarbari,  Daulatdia,  Bhuapur,  Sirajganj,  Mawa,  and  Char  Janajat.  In \naddition there are 233 Bangladesh Inland Waterways Transport Authority (BIWTA) launch ghats \nand over 1,000 other ghats around the country. \n \n14.  More than half of the country\u2019s land area and 75% of its commercial activities are \nsituated  within  10  km  of  a  navigable  waterway  during  all  seasons.  The  waterways  are \ndeveloped and maintained by BIWTA and, despite problems of siltation and reduced stream flow \n ", "  Appendix 2  23\nduring the dry season, provide a cost-effective means of transport. The Bangladesh Inland \nWaterways Transport Corporation (BIWTC) maintains a few intercity passenger traffic lines and \nlimited inland waterway cargo traffic. The private sector provides the majority of inland water \nservices. The service providers are organized into a number of associations.  The eleven major \nports are administered and managed by BIWTA. Contracts are made with the private sector \noperators to deliver the necessary services.  \n \n15.  The main problems associated with water transport are (i) siltation of inland waterways \nand lack of adequate navigation aids; (ii) poor operational efficiency of the BIWTC fleet (most of \nthe vessels in its fleet are old and costly in terms of fuel consumption and maintenance and \nrepair costs); (iii) heavy losses from unprofitable BIWTC passenger services on coastal routes \nand inefficient cargo services on other routes; (iv) poor operational efficiency of Chittagong Port \nfrom inadequate arrangements for carriages as well as for loading and unloading containers; (v) \noperational problems because of siltation of channels from anchorage to the port area (proper \ndredging cannot be undertaken because of financial constraints of port authorities); and (vi) \noperational problems at Mongla Port due to siltation of approach channels and the lack of \nmultipurpose berths and ancillary equipment. \n \nC.  Transport Sector Management  \n \n1.  Sector Management Structure \n \n16.  The transport sector consists of a number of sub-sectors including roads, railways, \ninland waterways, maritime shipping and civil aviation. The transport sector is managed and \ndeveloped by four line ministries: Ministry of Communications (MOC) for road and rail; Ministry \nof Shipping for water transport and ports; Ministry of Civil Aviation for air transport; and Ministry \nof Local Government, Rural Development, and Cooperatives for rural roads. Below the ministry \nlevel  there  are  nine  parastatals  involved  in  transport  operations:  Bangladesh  Railway, \nBangladesh Road Transport Corporation, BIWTC, BIWTA, Bangladesh Shipping Corporation, \nCivil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh, Biman Bangladesh Airlines, Chittagong Port Authority, \nand Mongla Port Authority. In addition, there is the relatively new Jamuna Bridge Division under \nMOC, with the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority, established in 1985, placed under the \nJamuna Bridge Division in 1995. \n \n2.  Government\u2019s Sector Expenditure \n \n17.  The  development  of  an  adequate  and  efficient  transport  system  is  seen  by  the \nGovernment  of  Bangladesh  as  a  prerequisite  for  both  initiating  and  sustaining  economic \ndevelopment. The Government is committed to the development of the transport sector, which is \nevident from the allocation of public sector funding during the fiscal years of 1997\u20132002. The \ntotal public sector outlay for the period from 1997 to 2002 is estimated to be Tk859 billion, of \nwhich  Tk110  billion  (13%)  is  allocated  to  the  transport  sector.  This  is  the  second  largest \nproportion of the public budget, the largest proportion of Tk129 billion (15% of the total budget) \nbeing for education.  \n \n3.  Government\u2019s Transport Sector Strategy \n \n18.  Road Transport. The critical problem facing the road sector is the maintenance and \nimprovement of the network to raise the quality and safety of road operations. Various options \nfor  financing  road  maintenance  and  operations  will  be  explored.  The  establishment  of  an \nautonomous road maintenance fund to ensure adequate and stable recurrent financing of roads \n \n ", "24  Appendix 2 \nwill be considered. The multimodal transport system link will be expanded to include, among \nother areas, the Export Processing Zone and areas producing coal, hard rock, mining fertilizer, \ncement, and tea for the speedy and efficient movement of cargo and passengers. Monitoring \nindicators  will  be  set  to  assess  progress  in  such  key  areas  as  increased  allocations  for \nmaintenance and levels of cost recovery and more effective road traffic management to improve \nroad safety, traffic control, and overloading enforcement.  \n \n19.  To ensure a sound road transport system, the responsibility for management of different \ntypes  of  roads  among  RHD,  LGED,  and  municipal  government  institutions  will  be  clearly \nassigned. Similarly, effective coordination among relevant ministries and agencies, and formal \nmechanisms of interaction with nongovernment stakeholders, will be instituted. To ensure the \nsatisfactory performance of responsibilities, high priority should be given to building up the \ncapacity  of  agencies  like  the  Bangladesh  Road  Transport  Authority  and  local  government \ninstitutions. \n \n20.  The rural road network has reached an extent that makes it appropriate to invest in \nquality rather than expansion. This will mean greater emphasis on high-quality construction \nusing  labor-based  technologies,  maintaining  and  upgrading  the  existing  network,  and \nundertaking selective expansion to ensure balanced rural-urban linkages. In doing so, more \nemphasis needs to be given to developing growth centers and rural roads to connect villages \nwith growth centers and feeder roads, as well as providing rural roads with such drainage \nstructures as bridges and culverts. \n \n21.  Pressure is increasing on urban transport systems in most cities. Ownership of motor \nvehicles is growing faster than the population. This growth exceeds the accommodating ability \nof road space. This has become a major impediment of the efficient working of road systems \nand the urban economy in Dhaka. This mega city of 10 million people living in a very limited \narea cannot meet transport needs with surface modes of transport only. It is imperative to build \nunderground and other mass transit systems. \n \n22.  Railway  Transport.  The  role  of  Bangladesh  Railway  in  the  economy  has  been \nconstrained by its limited infrastructure and low efficiency of services vis-\u00e0-vis competing modes \nof transportation. Sustained reforms are to enhance the contribution of railways to the economy \nand contain the adverse budgetary impact of its operations. The reorganization of Bangladesh \nRailway\u2014including corporatization and commercialization with private participation\u2014are critical \nto developing the sector and improving the efficiency of services. Linking Bangladesh Railway \nwith the railways of neighboring countries through strategic partnership has a high potential for \ncatalyzing economic growth, poverty reduction, and the commercial viability of the sector.. \n \n23.  Inland Waterway Transport. The inland waterway system carries a large volume of \ntotal freight but is not used to its full potential due to the silting of waterways, lack of ghat \nberthing facilities, and obstructions caused by low or narrow road bridges and irrigation channel \nsluice gates. To better realize the full potential of the inland waterways, the following factors, \namong others, will be considered: (i) inter-project coordination to facilitate clearances under \nroad  bridges  and  the  needs  of  country  boats  when  siting  and  designing  sluice  gates,  (ii) \nencouraging local authorities to organize self-financed ghat facilities through user charges, and \n(iii) setting and enforcing standards for the bridge network and berthing facilities. \n ", "  Appendix 3  25\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SECTOR, 1977\u20132006 \n \nSource  Project Amount  Year of\n($ million)  Approval\nA.

Project Scope  \n \n1.  The Padma Multipurpose Bridge Design Project (the Project) comprises the following six \nmain  elements.  The  design  consultant  shall  determine  the  optimum  arrangement  for  the \nconstruction  contracts  for  the  different  elements,  taking  into  account  the  interfaces  and \nrelationships  among  them.  Each  element  may  be  procured  under  a  separate  construction \ncontract or, alternatively, some elements may be combined into a single contract to produce a \nsmaller number of separate contracts.  \n \n2.  River-Training Works. Extensive river-training works are required on each side of the \nriver to confine the flow of the river within the extent of the main bridge and prevent erosion and \npossible undermining of the abutments and approaches.  \n \n3.  Main  Bridge  Across  the  Padma  River. The main bridge is a multi-span structure \napproximately 5.6 kilometers (km) long crossing the Padma River. As the future rail line will run \nbetween the two carriageways, the bridge will include a short viaduct at each end to link with \napproach embankments and carry one carriageway of the highway over the railway so that the \nhighway and railway may diverge at each end.  \n \n4.  Eastern Approaches. On the east side (left bank) the Project includes a short length of \napproach road embankment and the toll plaza for westbound traffic. In addition, provision shall \nbe made for the future railway approach embankment, and the extent of the works to be \nprovided under this Project is to be determined by the design consultant to suit the final road \nand rail alignment.  \n \n5.  Western Approaches. On the west side (right bank) the Project includes approximately \n12 km of approach road embankment and the toll plaza for eastbound traffic. This approach \nroad includes several bridges and culverts. In addition, provision shall be made for the future \nrailway approach embankment, and the extent of the works to be provided under this Project is \nto be determined by the design consultant to suit the final road and rail alignment. The railway \nworks on the west side may include space for a future railway station. \n \n6.  Associated Bridge End Facilities (East Side). The bridge end facilities on the east \n(Mawa) side will include, in addition to any other requirements that the design consultant may \ndetermine, the following: \n(i)  toll plaza and toll collection facilities for westbound traffic;  \n(ii)  weigh-in-motion station and weigh bridge; \n(iii)  service area with offices and facilities for future operation and maintenance staff;  \n(iv)  small compound with offices and accommodation facilities to be used by the \ncontractor, engineer, and client during construction and also by the client and \nothers during the ongoing operation phase; \n(v)  whatever end facilities are required to connect the high-voltage power cables on \nthe bridge with the surrounding power transmission network; \n(vi)  whatever end facilities are required to connect the gas pipes on the bridge with \nthe surrounding gas pipe system; \n(vii)  whatever end facilities are required to connect the telecommunications and other \nservices carried by the bridge with the surrounding networks; and \n(viii)  all necessary safety and security provisions associated with the above. \n \n \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \n7.  Associated Bridge End Facilities (West Side). The bridge end facilities on the west \n(Janjira) side will include, in addition to any other requirements that the design consultant may \ndetermine, the following: \n(i)  toll plaza and toll collection facilities for eastbound traffic;  \n(ii)  weigh-in-motion station and weigh bridge; \n(iii)  service area with offices and facilities for future operation and maintenance staff;  \n(iv)  large compound with offices and accommodation facilities to be used by the \ncontractor, engineer, and client during construction and designed to be converted \ninto a major hotel and tourist resort with leisure and recreation facilities (part of \nthis compound shall be designated for use by the client and others during the \nongoing operation phase); \n(v)  visitor center to house a permanent exhibition describing the project and other \nmatters of interest in the area, which can be used as a tourist attraction and \neducational facility during construction to explain the works and celebrate the \nachievement of planning, designing, and constructing such a crossing; \n(vi)  whatever end facilities are required to connect the high-voltage power cables on \nthe bridge with the surrounding power transmission network; \n(vii)  whatever end facilities are required to connect the gas pipes on the bridge with \nthe surrounding gas pipe system; \n(viii)  whatever end facilities are required to connect the telecommunications and other \nservices carried by the bridge with the surrounding networks; and \n(ix)  all necessary safety and security provisions associated with the above. \n \n8.  The design consultant is required to determine the precise scope, content, and extent of \neach element of the works after detailed consultation with the parties involved, and to carefully \ndefine  the  precise  boundary  between  each  element  of  the  works  to  be  carried  out  under \nseparate contracts.  \n \n9.  The design life for the crossing shall be 100 years. This requirement defines the basis \nfor the derivation of the characteristic imposed loads and environmental effects to be considered \nin the design. The assumption of a design life of 100 years does not mean that the crossing will \nnot be fit for its purpose at the end of that period, or that it will continue to be serviceable for that \nperiod without adequate inspection and maintenance and the repair and replacement of certain \nmaterials and components. The definition of a design life presupposes the establishment and \nroutine operation of an adequate and thorough inspection and maintenance regime covering all \naccessible structural and nonstructural parts.  \n \n10.  Thus it is to be expected that some materials and components such as bridge deck \nsurfacing, bearings, movement joints, corrosion protection paint systems, safety barriers, and \ncertain other parts will require repair and/or replacement at much shorter intervals. The following \nminimum periods are given as guidance to what would be expected as minimum service life for \nthe various components and are to be verified by the design consultant:  \n(i)  Bridge deck surfacing: period to first resurfacing > 25 years. \n(ii)  Bridge bearings: period to first major maintenance/replacement > 40 years. \n(iii)  Movement joints: period to first major maintenance/replacement > 25 years.  \n(iv)  Corrosion protection: period to first re-coating > 20 years. \n(v)  Corrosion protection: period between subsequent re-coatings > 10 years.  \n \nB.   Crossing Facilities  \n \n11.  The bridge is to carry the following facilities:  \n ", "  Appendix 4  29\n(i)  Highway.  The bridge is required to carry dual two-lane carriageways with a \ndesign traffic speed of 100 km per hour (km/hr). Each carriageway shall comprise \ntwo traffic lanes each 3.5 meters (m) wide and a hard shoulder 2.5 m wide. The \nbridge is intended to carry motorized vehicles only, not pedestrians, cycles, or \nrickshaws, and no special provision shall be made for a cycle or pedestrian path \non any part of the bridge. \n(ii)  Railway. Provision shall be made for the future addition of a single-track broad-\ngauge railway along the centerline of the bridge. The design rail speed is 60 \nkm/hr. Different locations of the railway in the bridge cross section have been \nconsidered in the feasibility studies and development of the project, including the \noption of placing the railway on one edge of the bridge, as it is on the Jamuna \nbridge, but there is a strong preference for the railway to be carried along the \nbridge centerline at the Padma crossing. A central corridor shall be provided for \nthe future rail provision. The bridge shall be designed for the loadings arising \nfrom  the  proposed  future  railway  from  the  outset,  including  all  realistic \ncombinations  of  railway  loading  with  highway  and  other  imposed  and \nenvironmental load effects. There must be no need for future strengthening of the \nbridge to accommodate the railway when it is added at a future date. A walkway \nfor use by railway maintenance staff and to permit safe emergency egress from \nthe train shall be provided along one or both sides of the track.  \n(iii)  Power transmission line. The bridge will be required to carry a 400 kilovolt (kV) \npower  transmission  line  as  part  of  the  developing  power  supply  network  in \nsouthwest Bangladesh. The Jamuna bridge carries a 230 kV power transmission \nline  overhead  on  tapering  cylindrical  masts,  but  this  type  of  solution  is  not \npreferred for the Padma bridge. The preferred solution is for the power cables to \nbe carried in a special duct supported on a cantilevered section of the deck along \none edge of the bridge girder. This will require that special safety and security \nprecautions are adopted and incorporated into the design of the system.  \n(iv)  High-pressure  gas  main. The bridge is to carry a gas pipe 30 inches (76 \ncentimeters) in diameter, which is expected to operate at a pressure of 1,000 \npounds  per  square  inch.  The  gas  pipe  shall  be  supported  either  under  the \ncantilevered section of deck on the opposite side of the bridge from the power \ncables or in an alternative position taking due account of the requirement for \neasy access for maintenance and the need to ensure the safety and security of \nthe gas pipe. The gas pipe shall not be carried inside a closed box girder bridge \nsuperstructure.  \n(v)  Ducts  for  telecommunication  cables  and  other  services.  The  bridge  is \nrequired to carry telecommunications cables with additional capacity in the form \nof at least three empty ducts for the addition of future cables. It is to be expected \nthat this will involve the provision of about six continuous ducts with an internal \ndiameter not less than 150 millimeters. A continuous power supply system shall \nbe provided within the bridge to provide lighting for safe passage through and \ninspection of the interior. In addition, suitable electrical outlets shall be provided \nat regular intervals along the bridge interior for the purpose of powering hand \ntools and equipment.  \n(vi)  Traveling maintenance trolley system. To facilitate longitudinal access through \nthe bridge for inspection and maintenance staff, and to enable the rapid transfer \nof  materials  and  equipment  along  the  bridge  to  facilitate  inspection  and \nmaintenance work, a traveling maintenance trolley system shall be provided. The \nparticular performance requirements of the trolley system shall be developed by \nthe design consultant in line with similar facilities provided on other long bridges.  \n \n ", "30  Appendix 4 \nC.   Design Standards and Requirements \n \n12.  The design consultant shall determine the most appropriate and applicable standards \nand codes of practice to be adopted in the design of the various elements of the works, taking \ninto account any national requirements and preferences in Bangladesh as well as current \ninternational  best  practice.  Where  an  element  of  the  works  is  not  adequately  covered  by \nrecognized, published codes and standards, the design consultant shall develop and propose \nsuitable design standards.  \n \n1.  River-training Works \n \n13.  The design consultant shall propose appropriate standards and criteria for the design \nand construction of river-training works. In arriving at these standards and criteria, it shall study \nall available and relevant international standards and codes of best practice for river-training \nworks and the stabilization of soft riverbanks, and make reference to the work carried out in \nconnection  with  the  Jamuna  bridge  project  and  other  relevant  documents,  including  the \nfollowing:  \n(i)  study reports and design documents for the Jamuna bridge, 1989\u20131998; \n(ii)  Standard Design Manual, Bangladesh Water Development Board, 1994;  \n(iii)  Evaluation  Report  of  Bank  Protection  and  River  Training  Pilot  Project  and \nGuidelines  and  Design  Manual  for  Standardized  Bank  Protection  Structures \n(FAP-21/22, 2001); \n(iv)  reports on the Jamuna-Meghna River Erosion Mitigation Project (2002) and other \nriverbank protection projects in Bangladesh; and \n(v)  standards, guidelines, and research papers in India, Japan, and other countries.  \n \n14.  In addition, the design consultant shall take note of the results of recent monitoring of \nriverbed  scour  adjacent  to  the  guide  bunds  at  the  Jamuna  bridge  and  take  them  into \nconsideration when developing appropriate design criteria.  \n \n2.  Bridge Structural Design  \n \n15.  The design consultant will propose appropriate structural design standards and criteria \nto be used as the bases for designing the main bridge. It is expected that these will be based on \neither British or American standards, but the design consultant may also wish to consider other \nsuitable, well-established international standards. The design consultant shall ensure that the \nstandards adopted for the project represent a coherent, consistent, and comprehensive set of \ndesign rules for all aspects of the structural design.  \n \n16.  It is noted that British Standard BS5400, the comprehensive design standard for bridges \npreviously used for the design of the Jamuna bridge, is due to be withdrawn in the near future \nwith the advent of the Structural Eurocodes in Europe. Nevertheless, the design consultant may \npropose them if he determines that they would be the most appropriate set of standards to use \nfor the Padma project. Alternatively, the design consultant may wish to propose a set of design \nstandards  based  on  American  Association  of  State  Highway  and  Transportation  Officials \nstandards  or  a  combination  of  British  and  American  standards  where  this  would  be  more \nappropriate. \n \n17.  If a combination of standards is proposed, the design consultant shall take care to \nensure full compatibility in the different approaches to the definition of characteristic loads and \npartial safety factors so as to achieve consistency in the safety margins to be built into the \n ", "  Appendix 4  31\ndesign. The design consultant shall present a well-argued case for whichever set of design \ncriteria is proposed and shall obtain the approval of the client before proceeding with the \ndetailed design.  \n \n3  Railway Standards  \n \n18.  The requirements of Bangladesh Railway shall be taken into account in deriving the \nappropriate design standards for the railway, bearing in mind that the provision of the railway \nitself is expected to be under a subsequent contract placed after the bridge is completed. The \nfollowing basic requirements have so far been established but need to be reviewed by the \ndesign consultant in determining the appropriate design standards: \n(i)  The bridge is to carry a single broad-gauge (1,676 millimeter) non-electrified \ntrack. \n(ii)  Foreign railways standards and criteria are to be considered because there is a \npossibility that freight wagons owned by those railways may use the bridge in the \nfuture. \n(iii)  The proposed train speed limit on the bridge is 60 km/hr. \n(iv)  Train length is limited to 528 meters and weight to 19,570 kilonewtons. The rail \nclearance envelope dimensions and rail track construction details shall be agreed \nwith Bangladesh Railway to define the geometric and loading criteria to be used \nin the design of the bridge. \n \n4.  Approach Roads and Embankments  \n \n19.  Once it is constructed, the project highway will become a part of the National Highway \nNo. 8 of Bangladesh. In addition, the highway is listed in the United Nations Economic and \nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) Intergovernmental Agreement of 26 \nApril 2004 as a link of Asian Highway Route 1. Therefore, in addition to considering the most \nappropriate  international  highway  design  standards  to  be  adopted  for  the  design  of  the \napproach roads, the design consultant shall take note of the following two relevant design \nstandards:  (i)  Roads  and  Highway  Department  (RHD)  Geometric  Design  Standards  of \nBangladesh and (ii) Asian Highway Classification and Design Standards of UNESCAP. These \ntwo standards would suggest different classifications for the project highway as follows: (i) type \n2 (design speed 80 km/hr) of the RHD Geometric Design Standards, and (ii) primary, level \nterrain (design speed 120 km/hr) of the Asian Highway Classification and Design Standards. \n \n20.  The design consultant shall determine the most appropriate set of standards and criteria \nfor the highway to suit the proposed design speed of 100 km/hr. The entire route between the \ntoll plazas is to be a controlled, tolled crossing, and unauthorized access shall be prevented by \nsuitable  security  systems.  The  design  of  the  approach  roads  across  open  country  on \nembankments shall take this into account.  \n \n5.  Power Transmission Lines  \n \n21.  The bridge is to carry a 400 kV power line comprising at least six high-voltage power \ncables. There is currently no other 400 kV power line in Bangladesh, so the design consultant \nshall  refer  to  current  international  best  practice  from  other  countries  in  determining  the \nappropriate design standards to be adopted in this case.  \n \n ", "32  Appendix 4 \n22.  The preferred solution proposed in the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) \nreport after consultation with the Ministry of Power and the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh \nis for the cables to be carried in a duct along the edge of the bridge rather than overhead on tall \nmasts. This solution has arisen partly because of the preference identified in the JICA report for \nan extradosed (or cable stayed) structural system for the bridge, which would be incompatible \nwith  overhead  power  lines.  There  are  some  advantages  and  some  disadvantages  to  this \nproposal, and the design consultant shall evaluate them when arriving at the optimal final \ndesign.  \n \n23.  With the cable duct along the edge of the bridge deck, access to the cables is much \neasier than with an overhead system, and the design will need to incorporate special measures \nto  ensure safety  and  security.  Unauthorized access  to  the  cables shall  be  prevented,  but \nsuitable provision for controlled access for inspection and maintenance staff shall be made. The \ndesign shall include a suitable safety fence outside the duct at the edge of the bridge or a \ncontinuous clip-on safety rail system for use with a safety harness to ensure the safety of \ninspection and maintenance staff.  \n \n24.  It is to be expected that the cables will be placed in a bed of sand within the duct, and \nthat if necessary the duct can be mounted on resilient mountings to absorb vibrations from \npassing road and rail traffic and to provide added electrical isolation. With an overhead power \nline system, movement joints would not be necessary. Placing the cables in a duct requires \nsuitable movement joints at intervals to accommodate thermal expansion and contraction. The \ndesign consultant shall develop an appropriate solution using U-bends or other devices to \naccommodate the necessary movements, taking care to ensure that such joints are visually \nunobtrusive but also accessible for inspection and maintenance.  \n \n25.  At each end of the bridge, the cables will emerge from the bridge duct and pass into an \ninsulator arrangement and thence to the overland overhead transmission line mast system. \nParticular care is needed at these points to ensure safety and prevent unauthorized access to \nthe power cables. The arrangement of the bridge end facility is to be determined by the design \nconsultant in consultation with the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh so that sufficient space \nis provided and suitable arrangements are included in the construction contracts. The actual \nsupply and installation of the power cables and all associated connection facilities at each end \nwill be under a separate contract after completion of bridge construction.  \n \n6.  High Pressure Gas Main  \n \n26.  The high-pressure gas main shall be designed in accordance with the requirements of \nPetrobangla with reference to appropriate recognized international design standards such as \nthe American Petroleum Institute (API) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) codes \nas well as the Bangladesh Natural Gas Safety Rules 1993.  \n \n27.  The gas supply requirement is currently identified as a single gas pipe 30 inches (76 \ncentimeters) in diameter and operating at a pressure of 1,000 pounds per square inch. The \ndesign consultant shall study options for the bridge to carry the same gas supply capacity but \nwith two smaller gas pipes instead of one large one to provide some redundancy in the system \nfor maintenance or in case of any other reason to shut a pipe down. In this case, the two pipes \nshall not be carried side-by-side but shall be suitably separated to provide the necessary safety \ndistance between them as required by normal safety standards. Such options may include \ncarrying one pipe above and one below the cantilevered bridge deck, or placing one pipe in the \n ", "  Appendix 4  33\ncentral corridor adjacent to the railway line behind a suitable safety barrier, perhaps beneath the \nwalkway.  \n \n28.  The number, size, and location of the gas pipe(s) in the bridge cross section is to be \ndecided by the design consultant after design development and after further consultation with \nPetrobangla and others to suit the final design of the bridge. The gas pipe(s) will require \nmovement joints at intervals to be determined by the design consultant. Such joints may involve \nlarge U-bends or special in-line concertina or sliding type joints. From the point of view of \naesthetics, the in-line type of joint is preferred since U-bends tend to be very large and require \nlarge supporting platforms mounted outside of the bridge. The design consultant shall devise a \njoint type and arrangement that suit the functional requirements and provide easy access for \ninspection and maintenance without spoiling the overall appearance of the bridge. The pipe \nsupports shall be designed to be as neat and tidy as possible, with a minimum of sliding or \nmoving joints.  \n \n7.  Telecommunications and Other Small Electrical and Data Services  \n \n29.  The  design  consultant  shall  propose  suitable  design  standards  based  on  current \ninternational  best  practice  for  the  design  of  the  ducts  within  the  bridge  girder  for  future \ntelecommunications and small power and data cables. The ducts shall be placed within the \nbridge deck structure at a location where they are unlikely to get damaged but where they are \nreadily accessible for inspection and maintenance. They shall be designed in accordance with \nthe  requirements  of  Bangladesh  Telegraph  and  Telephone  Board,  including  the  adequate \nprovision of movement joints and service chambers as required. The ducts shall be arranged in \ntwo groups within the bridge cross section, separated by a distance of at least 3 meters, so that \nsensitive data cables need not be placed immediately adjacent to any electrical supply cables \nthat may cause interference.  \n \n8.  Drainage \n \n30.  As rainwater drainage from the bridge may be permitted to discharge into the river; there \nis no requirement for a piped drainage system on the bridge to take rainwater runoff back to the \nabutments. However, it is undesirable to allow potential pollution of the waterway from spillage \nof oil, fuel, or other potential contaminants on the roadway. Therefore the design consultant \nshall consider the provision of a drainage system that includes separation sumps to catch \npotential contaminants and prevent them from discharging directly into the river.  \n \n31.  The outlets from the sumps that discharge water into the river shall be designed as  \nsuitable spouts to ensure that the water flows freely away from the structure to prevent wetting \nand possible staining of concrete surfaces or any other parts of the structure. Particular care \nshall be taken to prevent water entering the structure or any parts intended to remain dry, and to \nprevent  water  from  reaching  the  bearings  and  other  components  susceptible  to  corrosion. \nMovement joints shall be detailed to ensure that any water penetrating the joint does not stain or \ndamage structural parts or components underneath.  \n \n ", " \n3\n4\n \n \n \n \n \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES    \n \nA\n  p\np\nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Categorya   e\nn\nd\n  ix\nItem  Tk Million  $ Million  % Base   5 \nForeign  Local  Total  Foreign  Local  Total  Cost \nA.

Objectives \n \n1.  The design consultant for the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Design Project (the Project) \nwill prepare detailed engineering documentation required for implementation. In summary, the \ndesign consultant will (i) develop design criteria, (ii) prepare scheme designs for all elements of \nthe Project, (iii) prepare detailed designs for a significant part of the Project, (iv) prepare a \nstrategy for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the bridge, (v) define requirements for any \nfurther investigations or tests, (vi) prepare tender documents for all elements of the Project, and \n(vii) assist with the prequalification and appointment of contractors who will be responsible for \nconstruction. \n \nB.  Scope of Works \n \n1.  Scheme Design \n \n2.  Review  Previous  Studies. A number of previous studies have been undertaken in \nconnection with establishing a fixed crossing at the selected site; they are summarized as \nfollows: (i) Padma Bridge Study \u2013 Prefeasibility Report, by Rendel, Palmer & Tritton, Nedeco \nand Bangladesh Consultants Ltd (February 2000); (ii) The Feasibility Study of the Padma \nBridge, prepared by Nippon Koei Co., Ltd., in association with Construction Project Consultants, \nInc., under contract to the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) (March 2005); (iii) \nPreparing the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project, by STUP Consultants P. Ltd. (September \n2006); and (iv) Land Acquisition Plan (LAP), Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) & Environmental \nManagement Plan (EMP), prepared by Bangladesh Consultants Ltd. (June 2006). These reports \nsummarize the considerable amount of work already undertaken to date. The design consultant \nshall review these reports and verify any technical, economic, or commercial findings given in \nthem that have a direct bearing on the Project as it develops. \n \n3.  Confirm Scope of Construction Works. The design consultant is required to review \nthe scope of works proposed in the various preliminary studies and confirm the scope of the \nconstruction works. This includes determining the full requirements for all aspects of the Project \nincluding the main bridge, approaches, bridge end facilities, river-training works, and all other \nworks that are required to achieve the project objectives. \n \n4.  Review  and  Confirm  Contract  Strategy.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  Project  will  be \nconstructed under several contracts awarded to different contractors. The design consultant is \nrequired to define the precise split of responsibility between the individual construction contracts \nand to define the interfaces. The initial break down of construction contracts, which shall be \nreviewed and modified as necessary by the design consultant as required, is as follows: \n \nTable A8.1: Contract Packages \n \nPackage  Type of Work \nContract 1  Main Bridge \nContract 2  River-training Works \nContract 3  Approach Roads and Bridge End Facilities (Mawa Side) \nContract 4  Approach Roads and Bridge End Facilities (Janjira Side) \nContract 5  Site Accommodation for Engineers and Contractors staff \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates and consultant\u2019s report. \n \n ", "40   Appendix 8 \n5.  Bridge  End  Facilities.  The  bridge  end  facilities  include,  in  addition  to  any  other \nrequirements that the design consultant may determine, the following: \n(i)  toll plaza and toll collection facilities for traffic; \n(ii)  weigh-in-motion station and weigh bridge; \n(iii)  service area with offices and facilities for future operation and maintenance staff;  \n(iv)  small compound with offices and accommodation facilities to be used by the \ncontractor, engineer, and client during construction and also by the client and \nothers during the ongoing operation phase; \n(v)  whatever end facilities are required to connect the high-voltage power cables on \nthe bridge with the surrounding power transmission network; \n(vi)  whatever end facilities are required to connect the gas pipes on the bridge with \nthe surrounding gas pipe system; \n(vii)  whatever end facilities are required to connect the telecommunications and other \nservices carried by the bridge with the surrounding networks; and \n(viii)  all necessary safety and security provisions associated with the above. \n \n6.  Develop Design Criteria. The consultant shall prepare comprehensive design criteria \nthat achieve the objectives of the Project. The design criteria shall be prepared and presented in \nsuch a way that they can be readily applied by the design consultant, panel of experts (POE), \nchecking engineer, and any other design consultant such as one that may be engaged under a \ndesign and construct contract. The design criteria shall include all rail-related elements including \ntrack and track support systems regardless of whether or not the railway will be installed \nimmediately following the completion of the crossing. Similarly, the design criteria shall include \nall aspects relating to the installation or future installation of utilities on the bridge. It should \nclearly state all assumptions regarding loads imposed on the bridge and the expected bridge \nmovements so that that the effects of these movements can be accounted for in the design of \nthe utilities. \n \n7.  Develop  Scheme  Design.  Notwithstanding  earlier  feasibility  studies,  the  design \nconsultant is required to develop outline designs for a number of different options for the main \nbridge,  approach  roads,  and,  if  appropriate,  river-training  works  to  enable  options  to  be \nobjectively compared with one another. Each option shall be developed in sufficient detail to \ndemonstrate that the project objectives and design criteria have been complied with and to \nenable  preliminary  construction  costs  to  be  estimated  and  a  construction  program  to  be \nprepared. The design consultant shall then formulate an objective method for comparing the \noptions to select the preferred scheme design. \n \n8.  Project Program. The design consultant is required to prepare a program for all aspects \nof the Project including activities within the design consultant\u2019s scope and those undertaken by \nothers, hereafter referred to as the project program. The project program should reflect the \nagreed procurement strategy and scheme designs for all elements of the Project. It should be \nachievable  and  be  accompanied  by  a  commentary  that  identifies  options  or  alternative \nscenarios where appropriate. \n \n9.  Develop O&M Strategy. It is anticipated that an operation and maintenance (O&M) \ncontractor will be appointed for the Project by the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority (JMBA) \nunder a 5-year contract tendered on a competitive basis in strategy similar to that adopted for \nthe Jamuna bridge. \n \n10.  Risk  Register.  The  design  consultant  is  required  to  prepare  and  maintain  for  the \nduration of the Project a detailed risk register. This register will identify technical, commercial, \n ", "Appendix 8  41\ncontractual, environmental, program, financing, and other risks. It will identify the probability of \noccurrence, mitigating measures required, residual risks, and consequences should the risk \ncome to pass. It should identify those responsible for addressing the risks and at what stage the \nrisks are to be addressed. \n \n11.  Define Additional Studies. Additional studies prior to or during the detailed design \nphase are expected to be needed to provide important information that will reduce uncertainty \nassociated with technical, program, and commercial aspects of the Project. The additional \nstudies are expected to include (i) geotechnical investigations; (ii) wind tunnel testing; (iii) a \ntopographic survey; (iv) a bathymetric survey; and (v) river flow, scour, and hydrological studies \nand physical modeling. The design consultant shall identify the extent of the above studies and \nany other studies considered appropriate that may serve the overall objective of reducing risk to \nan acceptable level. As part of this undertaking the design consultant should define in detail \nwhere  and,  if  appropriate,  how  the  additional  studies  should  be  executed  and  what  their \nobjectives are. \n \n12.  Specifications  and  Contract  Documents  for  Additional  Studies.  The  design \nconsultant shall prepare and agree a strategy for undertaking the additional studies along with \ncost  estimates  and,  as  noted  earlier,  a  program  for  completion.  The  design  consultant  is \nrequired to prepare comprehensive detailed technical specification setting out the objectives of \nthe studies, the required deliverables, and what information will be provided by the design \nconsultant to form part of the studies. These technical specifications should, where appropriate, \nset out the minimum requirements for tests, e.g., scale, duration, sample type, etc. \n \n13.  Terms of Reference for Checking Engineers. The roles of the checking engineers will \nbe to review the design criteria, specifications, drawings, and other documents submitted by the \ndesign consultant and to check the detailed design to ensure that it meets the project objectives \nand is safe, buildable, and economic. The scope of the checking engineers\u2019 check is expected \nto  be  limited  to  the  main  bridge  but  may  also  include  river-training  works  and  other  civil \nengineering works forming part of the Project if agreed with JMBA. The proposed terms of \nreference (TOR) should be endorsed by the POE. \n \n14.  Assist JMBA with Appointment of Checking Engineers. The checking engineers will \nbe appointed by JMBA. The design consultant shall assist JMBA with every aspect of the \nchecking  engineers\u2019  appointment  including  preparing  tender  documents  and  submission \nrequirements, prequalification, assessment of tenders, and final appointment. The curricula \nvitae  of the candidates should be reviewed and accepted by the POE. \n \n15.  Project Cost Estimate. The design consultant shall prepare a preliminary cost estimate \nbroken down into the different contracts showing the projected expenditure profile throughout \nthe Project on a month-by-month basis for each construction contract and any other works \nassociated with the Project. \n \n16.  Economic and Financial Evaluation. The design consultant shall develop economic \nand  financial  models  like  those  produced  in  earlier  feasibility  studies.  They  shall  include \nevaluations that are directly comparable to those produced previously but should be expanded \nand refined in whatever way that the design consultant sees as appropriate. The economic \nevaluation will output the predicted economic internal rate of return, benefit-to-cost ratio, and net \npresent value for the Project. Sensitivity studies should be undertaken in a way similar to those \ndone at the feasibility stage. The financial evaluation aims to measure and evaluate financial \naspects of the Project including, but not limited to, (i) analysis of toll rates and predicted traffic \n \n ", "42   Appendix 8 \nvolume, (ii) analysis of revenue from charges levied to utility companies, (iii) tax and customs \nrevenues,  (iv)  project  construction and  O&M  costs,  and  (v)  analysis  of  probable  financing \nmethods, both private and conventional. From this financial evaluation the design consultant \nshall prepare income and expenditure profiles for the Project. \n \n17.  Review  Possibilities  for  Public-Private  Partnerships.  The  design  consultant  is \nrequired to appoint an expert in public-private partnership (PPP) and finance to review options \nfor PPP on any aspects of the Project. Some work has already been undertaken looking at PPP \noptions. This is to be reviewed and updated for both the construction and post-construction \nstages. In addition the design consultant shall explore, with JMBA and donor agencies, the \npossibility of gap funding on PPP schemes. It is currently considered that there is limited scope \nfor PPP involvement in the project but that the greatest opportunity for PPP is most likely in the \nO&M  stage  of  the  Project.  The  design  consultant  shall  report  on  any  identified  PPP \nopportunities and pay particular attention to any possible PPP models for the O&M phase, \nmaking recommendations on the preferred options. \n \n18.  Scheme Design Reports. At a point in the program to be approved by JMBA, the \ndesign consultant shall submit an interim scheme design report. This shall include details and \ngeneral arrangement drawings of the options considered and a preliminary assessment of the \npreferred option. The design consultant shall make a presentation of the interim scheme design \nto  JMBA,  other  representatives  of  the  Government,  donor  agencies,  and  other  relevant \nauthorities. Any comments received from relevant parties shall be considered and incorporated \ninto the development of the final scheme design. The design consultant shall prepare and \nsubmit  a  final  scheme  design  report  that  will  include  general  arrangement  drawings  and \npresentation  images  for  planning  and  promotional  purposes.  The  report  will  include \ncomprehensive details of the studies in sufficient detail to allow close scrutiny by others. The \nreport must set out a full justification for the recommendations made. \n \n2.  Additional Studies \n \n19.  The design consultant shall propose additional studies and surveys required to complete \nthe  detailed  design.  The  agreed  additional  studies  shall  be  carried  out  under  the  full \nresponsibility of the design consultant, regardless of any subcontracting arrangement that may \nbe needed. If any subcontracting arrangement is required, the design consultant is responsible \nfor  recruitment,  technical  supervision  of  the  additional  studies,  and  finalization  of  the  final \nreports of the studies.  \n \n20.  The  design  consultant  shall  assess  the  implications  of  the  results of  the  additional \nstudies and, where relevant, identify any requirements for further testing that may have arisen. \nThe design consultant shall seek approval to undertake such further testing. The implications of \nthe results of the additional tests will be fully evaluated by the design consultant. The design \ncriteria should be revised as required to reflect the results of the additional studies. In addition, \nthe  design  consultant  shall  ascertain  the  technical,  commercial,  economic,  and  other \nimplications arising from the results of the additional studies. Further detailed analysis and \ndevelopment of the scheme design is assumed to be undertaken at the commencement of \ntender actions. After completion of the additional studies, the design consultant will be required to \nupdate the project cost estimate and the project program. As in scheme design, the project cost \nestimate and project program must be comprehensive in their coverage and should include \nsensitivity studies. \n \n ", "Appendix 8  43\n3.  Detailed Design \n \n21.  Update Final Scheme Design. As soon as possible in the detailed design phase, the \ndesign consultant shall update the final scheme design based on the results and findings of the \nadditional studies. This update shall take into account any reports prepared as part of the \nadditional studies and any interpretative reports prepared by the design consultant or others.   \n \n22.  Detailed  Engineering  Design.  Based  on  the  agreed  contract  strategy,  the  design \nconsultant is required to prepare detailed designs for all parts of the Project except those \nidentified as being for detailed design by contractors. The design consultant shall use state-of-\nthe-art techniques and standards to produce an efficient, robust, and buildable design that \ncomplies fully with the agreed design criteria developed in scheme design. The design shall \nconform to international codes and standards, and, where relevant, reference shall be made to \npublished  design  and  detailing  guides.  Proprietary  analytical  software  should  generally  be \nindependently verified and in all cases benchmarked against known or published solutions. \nAnalytical techniques used in the detailed design should be described in the design report. \n \n23.  Design Certificates. The design consultant shall submit to JMBA design certificates \nsigned by the design consultant\u2019s project director that itemize all drawings and, if appropriate, \nbar-bending schedules for all detailed design elements of the Project except where detailed \ndesigns are to be prepared by contractors. The certificates shall be in an agreed format and \nreflect the design consultant\u2019s obligations under contract. \n \n24.  Liaison with  Checking  Engineers. The design consultant is required to liaise and \ncooperate in a proactive manner with the checking engineers supplying design information for \nchecking in accordance with an agreed schedule. The checking engineers will be required to \nprovide check certificates as a key deliverable. The check certificates will state that the checking \nengineers  are  satisfied  that  the  design  complies  with  the  design  criteria.

Introduction \n \n1.  The panel of experts (POE) should consist of internationally renowned and respected \nindividual engineers who are widely acknowledged to be experts in their field. The members of \nthe POE should possess among them acknowledged expertise and experience in at least the \nfollowing disciplines and skills: (i) design, construction, and maintenance of bridges over water \nwith spans greater than 100 meters; (ii) design, construction, and maintenance of river-training \nworks of a similar scale and importance to this Project; (iii) design and construction of deep \npiled foundations in soft river deposits, including knowledge of the effects of scour and the \nprediction of pile group flexibility; (iv) seismic design of bridges and structure with specific \nknowledge of the seismicity of the region; and (iv) specific knowledge of the behavior and \nenvironment of the Padma River and the surrounding areas. It is possible that some of the \nmembers of the POE may possess expertise and experience in more than one of these areas. It \nis to be expected that the POE should include some members of the earlier POE for the \nJamuna bridge project, since their experience there would be helpful in this case. \n \n2.  The POE should consist of not fewer than five and not more than eight individuals \nincluding the chair. It is expected that the POE will include some experts resident in Bangladesh \nand familiar with the procedures and systems for design and construction in Bangladesh, as \nwell as other experts drawn from around the world. Ideally, the numbers of Bangladeshi and \nInternational experts should be approximately balanced. \n \nB.  Scope of Works \n \n3.  The POE is required to provide expert advice in connection with the project as required \nfrom time to time by JMBA, and to carry out periodic reviews of the procedures followed and the \nresults produced by the design consultant, checking engineers, and construction contractors \nthroughout the Project. \n \n4.  The POE shall organize itself under the leadership and guidance of its chair so that any \ncomments, suggestions, or advice from any of its members are assembled, reviewed, and \nagreed upon by all its members and submitted to JMBA as comments, suggestions, or advice \nfrom the POE as a whole. \n \n5.  During phase 1, the members of the POE will each receive from JMBA copies of monthly \nprogress reports and selected other reports prepared by the design consultant and checking \nengineers. Any comments and observations on these reports made by the individual members \nof the POE as a result of their review shall be assembled by the chairman and submitted to \nJMBA within 21 days of receipt.  \n \n6.  Similarly, during phase 2, the members of the POE will each receive from JMBA copies \nof monthly  reports of progress on the construction works and selected other reports. Any \ncomments and observations on these reports shall be assembled by the chair and submitted to \nJMBA within 21 days of receipt, as in phase 1. \n \n7.  Every 3 months or so throughout the Project, the POE shall assemble in Bangladesh for \na mission to review and comment on the progress of the work. Each mission is expected to last \napproximately 1 week and should include meetings with JMBA, the design consultant, the \ncontractors (during phase 2) and other key organizations to discuss matters of importance at \n ", "54   Appendix 10 \nthat time. During phase 2, these missions shall include a visit to the site to inspect the works \nand enquire about progress, quality control, materials and workmanship standards, etc. \n \n8.  At  the  end  of  each  mission,  the  POE  shall  submit  a  report  to  JMBA  making  any \nobservations, comments, or suggestions that the members of the POE collectively consider \nshould be made, and collating together any interim comments that have been made by the POE \nmembers during the previous 3-month period. \n \n9.  On some occasions, JMBA may request one or more members of the POE to visit an \noff-site manufacturing, fabrication, or testing facility to conduct an inspection and provide a \nwritten report. This may either coincide with a normal 3-monthly mission to Bangladesh or \nrequire an additional visit. \n \n10.  In  addition,  the  POE  is  expected  to  respond  to  any  specific  queries  on  particular \ntechnical issues on which JMBA may require independent expert advice during the course of \nthe project. Such queries will be put to the POE through the chair, and the response will be \nprovided through the chair. \n \n11.  In the event that any disagreement arises between the design consultants and the \nchecking engineer regarding a matter relating to the acceptability or suitability of the design, the \ndesign criteria or any other matter that cannot easily be resolved between them, the POE may \nbe asked by JMBA to review the issues in question and provide an independent opinion on the \nmatter to help the design consultant and checking consultant reach agreement. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  55 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh \n \nThe Padma bridge will be a large-scale infrastructure project, and its construction and operation will significantly \nbenefit various sectors of the economy of Bangladesh nationally and regionally. The road distance from Dhaka to \nnearly all major destinations in the southwest region will be reduced by 100 kilometers (km) or more, which will bring \ntremendous savings in passenger and commodity movement time and costs, as well as vehicle operation and \nmaintenance costs, while lengthening the useful life of vehicles and reducing the import bill for fuels. With the bridge, \ncapital inflow will increase, promoting industrial and commercial activity and improving economic and employment \nopportunities for local people, who will also gain better access to healthcare facilities and modern health technologies \navailable at Dhaka. Easier communication will help expand education and training facilities, and the resulting skills \ndevelopment will ensure the availability of high-quality workers. The export of skilled workers will increase wage \nearnings. Riverbank protection will reduce bank erosion and the incidence of worsened vulnerability and poverty \namong  people  displaced  by  erosion.  During  construction,  unemployed  local  people  will  get  employment,  and \nincreased commercial activity will facilitate income generation among locals. The country will be physically integrated \nthrough the fixed link, reducing economic disparity and deprivation. An estimate of multiplier effects on the Padma \nbridge investment shows the bridge increasing the national GDP growth rate by 1.2% and the gross product in the \nsouthwest region by 35%, as well as generating additional employment opportunities of 743,000 person-years, which \nequals 1.2% of the total labor force of Bangladesh. \n \nThe southwest region has one of the highest poverty rates in a poverty-stricken country. About 42% of the national \npopulation lived in March 2004 below the absolute poverty line. In Khulna Division in the southwest, the poverty \nincidence was 46%, which is much higher than Dhaka\u2019s 33%. The poor in the project area will reap immediate benefits \nfrom the bridge construction in the form of employment during construction, additional employment in relocated related \nactivities,  subsistence  allowances  and  other  benefits  from  resettlement,  and  increased  trading  income  during \nconstruction. In the long-term, the impact of the bridge on poverty reduction will be even more significant, as the \neconomic benefits generated by the bridge and accruing to the poor will be greater than their share of the GDP.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                          Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe southwest region of the country is isolated and comparatively underdeveloped. Construction of the proposed \nbridge over the Padma River at the Mawa-Janjira point at the junction of Munshiganj and Shariatpur districts of Dhaka \nDivision will bring tangible economic growth and social benefits to the people of the country, particularly in the \nsouthwestern region. The impact of the bridge on poverty reduction will be measured using some indicators like (i) \nchanges in the level of income and expenditure of the project impact area households; (ii) changes in type of work, \nemployment, job turn-over, and average daily wage; (iii) changes in agriculture, business and prices; (iv) increased \nmobility, migration, and community action; and (v) changes in undertaking higher education, etc. The benchmark \npoverty situation will be assessed using a baseline survey before starting the Project to enable poverty monitoring.  \n \nAlthough declining, the incidence of poverty is still very high in Bangladesh. According to the preliminary report of the \nhousehold income and expenditure survey in 2005, 40% of the national population in 2005 lived below the absolute \npoverty line and about 25% below the hardcore poverty line. Barishal Division had the highest incidence of poverty in \n2005, according to the report, with 52% of the people in the division living below the absolute poverty line, which is \nsubstantially higher than the national average. Poverty incidence in Khulna Division is about 46%. Dhaka Division \n(representing the project districts of Munshiganj, Shariatpur, and Madaripur) has the lowest incidence of poverty \ncompared to the national average. About 32% people in Dhaka Division lived below the poverty line in 2005. The \nincidence of hardcore poverty in the project division is 19.9%, 35.5% in Barishal Division, and 31.6% in Khulna \nDivision. \n \n ", "56   Appendix 11 \nA socioeconomic survey conducted on 390 households in April\u2013August 2006 in the project-influenced areas Mawa on \nthe east bank of the Padma River and Janjira on the west bank indicated that the incidence of poverty in the area was \nlower than the division average. About 30% of the households in the project-affected area lived under the absolute \npoverty line, compared with 33% in Dhaka Division, in March 2004. Poverty incidence is higher on the Janjira side, \nalmost double that of the Mawa side. Households living under hardcore poverty line are 7.5% on the Mawa side and \n11.94% on the Janjira side. The households covered during the socioeconomic survey consider the perceived \nsocioeconomic benefits of the Project in terms of improved access to socioeconomic services, increased employment \nopportunities, and improved transport services.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nThe public consultation process began in the project area in 1999 as part of the first pre-feasibility study. The \npotentially affected communities and other stakeholders were consulted through a number of meetings during the \nsecond pre-feasibility study (2003\u20132004) and the feasibility study (2004\u20132005). As part of the preparation process of \nproject preparatory technical assistance as of January\u2013February 2006, JMBA officials and their consultants conducted \na series of meetings with primary and secondary stakeholders in the project area.  \nPeople were consulted severally at different locations covering the whole project area through information and \nconsultation meetings, participating rapid assessment, focus group discussion, and grassroots workshops at three \nlocations  (Bakhorer,  Kandi,  Mawa,  and  Naodoba)  with  the  participation  of  all  level  of  stakeholder  during  the \nresettlement action plan study. The potential impacts (negative and positive) of the Project were disclosed among the \nproject community, and their views were recorded in the consultation process by Japan International Cooperation \nAgency  study  team  (2004\u20132005)  and  the  consultants  of  the  Jamuna  Multipurpose  Bridge  Authority  (JMBA) \nresettlement action plan study. These consultation meetings provided the affected people with opportunities to \nexpress their concerns about land acquisition, compensation, and resettlement. The extensive consultative process \nraised the level of awareness of the Project and gained local support. Similarly, in April\u2013September 2006 consultation \nmeetings and focus group discussions at selected villages on both banks of the river at Mawa and Janjira were \nconducted. Ten villages were selected\u2014three from the Mawa side, six from the Janjira side, and one from the \nupstream char land adjacent to the Kaorakandi ferry terminal\u2014for consultation and a socioeconomic survey of sample \nhouseholds. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nTo maximize the benefits of the Project to community members in the project area, the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge \nAuthority  will  encourage the contractors to hire labor from the local communities for civil  works construction. \nUnemployed youths can be provided with training for various technical works at the construction site. There are \nexamples from JMBA\u2019s experience of unskilled local laborers training on the job and being deployed by contractors to \nother projects, even outside the country. In the selection of resettlement sites and market relocation sites, local \nleaders and communities were consulted closely to direct the Project's benefits to the most critical areas. Local views \nand suggestions were given due consideration in developing project components and designing the resettlement and \nenvironmental management plans.  \n \nStakeholders' participation will be encouraged in the design phase and will be ensured during implementation of the \nresettlement plan by involving local representatives in (i) the valuation of property to be acquired by setting up property \nvaluation  advisory  committees,  (ii)  conflict  resolution  through  resettlement  advisory  committees,  (iii)  grievance \nresolution  through  grievance  redress  committees,  and  (iv)  identifying  replacement  land  in  land  identification \ncommittees. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe proposed bridge project will displace 283 households headed by women, amounting to 9% of the total households \nto be displaced. About half of the affected people are female. The construction of the bridge will not only affect those \ndisplaced or losing their land and property, but also other people with some interest in it. This relates to social issues \nrelating to women under traditional cultural and religious points of view. Especially on the Mawa side, the construction \nyard is proposed in a location surrounded by villages. The site is proposed to be linked with the riverbank at \nKumarbhog using an existing road to ease the transportation of equipment and construction materials by river. The \nproposed relocation villages and the only market to be relocated also raise social issues, including gender issues, that \n ", "  Appendix 11  57 \nneed to be addressed during the planning phase. The use of river by men and women from the neighboring villages is \na factor in the management of the service area for the proposed bridge construction. It is anticipated that women will \nbe at risk of sexually transmitted infections and human trafficking during construction. \nA gender action plan will be developed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development with the aim of \n(i) establishing and using temporary river ports at locations other than the present ones; (ii) developing construction \nyards; (iii) designing and developing the service area on the Janjira side; (iv) constructing river-training dykes on the \nJanjira side; (v) identifying, designing, and developing relocation villages, including the allocation and distribution of \nplots; (vi) identifying, designing, and developing a relocated market, including the allocation and distribution of \ncommercial parcels of land; (vii) designing a framework for the determination of losses and entitlements under the \nresettlement plan; (viii) designing livelihood-reconstruction and income-restoration programs as components of the \nresettlement plan; (ix) employing unskilled and semi-skilled labor in civil works construction; and (x) designing a \nmanagement plan to address the issues of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking. \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n \nE.  Social Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n        \nItem  Significant/    Plan Required \nNot Significant/  Strategy to Address Issues \nNone   \n Significant  A full resettlement plan will be prepared in accordance   Full \n  with the Policy on Involuntary Resettlement of the Asian   \nResettlement   Not significant  Development Bank (ADB) under this technical assistance   Short \n  (TA) loan on the basis of the detailed design of the bridge   \n None  and approach roads. The design consultant is required to   None \nconsider engineering designs that avoid or minimize land \nacquisition to the extent possible. \n    The  study  on  public-private  partnerships  will  have  to   \n   Significant  consider the optimum toll rate to ensure that the poor   Yes \nAffordability    obtain benefits by being road users.   \n Not significant    No \n \n None \n    The Project will explore and establish a sound safety   \n   Significant  management system at the site with monitoring and safety   Yes \nLabor    audit functions to ensure the safety of laborers.   \n Not significant    No  \n \n None \n    No indigenous peoples were found residing in the project   \n   Significant  area during project preparatory TA study.

If any impacts on indigenous peoples are    No \n  identified, then appropriate mitigation will be undertaken in \n None  the  form  of  either  the  preparation  of  an  indigenous \npeoples  development  plan  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) or the integration of \nspecific  actions  in  favor  of  indigenous  peoples  in  the \nrelated resettlement plan, depending on the magnitude of \nthe project impacts and sensitivity of indigenous peoples \nissues. \n    The  incidence  of  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  in   \nOther Risks   Significant  Bangladesh is very low at present. However, the Project   Yes \nand/or    may  threaten  to  worsen  the  situation  as  internal  and   \nVulnerabilities   Not significant  external migrant workers gather at the construction sites.    No  \n    A plan for managing sexually transmitted infections will be \n None  designed in this TA loan to address HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking issues during the construction period under the \ngender action plan.  \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20071115163405+08'00'", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0.5 for Word", "Keywords": "padma multipurpose bridge design, bangladesh technical assistance investment loan, padma bangladesh bridge project, bangladesh technical assistance loan project, rrp: ban 35049", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20071210140249+08'00'", "Company": "Asian Development Bank", "SourceModified": "D:20071114023613", "Title": "Padma Multipurpose Bridge Design Project"}}
