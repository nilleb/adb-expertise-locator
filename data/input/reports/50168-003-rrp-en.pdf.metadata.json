It supports critical fiscal and public \nexpenditure  management  (PEM)  reforms  to  improve  the  quality  of  government  spending  on \nhealth,  education,  social  protection,  and  infrastructure.  It  is  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s \nreform  priorities  to  (i)  align  medium-term  expenditure  with  the  National  Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan, 2015\u20132019 (RPJMN)1 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); (ii) \ncomplete  the  national  public  expenditure  framework;  and  (iii)  improve  fiscal  transfers  and \nspending of subnational governments.2 The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy,  2016\u20132019. 3 Subprogram 3  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan \n2019\u20132021 for Indonesia.4 The proposed subprogram is aligned with the operational priorities of \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 to (i) strengthen governance and institutional capacity (operational priority \n6), (ii) accelerate progress on gender equality (operational priority 2), and (iii) mainstream climate \nin national development plans (operational priority 3).5  \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \nProgrammatic approach and budget support. FPEMP uses a programmatic approach, \n3. \nwhich aligns ADB\u2019s support with the government\u2019s reform program over a medium- to long-term \nhorizon.  The  ADB  Board  of  Directors  approved  the  programmatic  approach,  comprising  three \nsubprograms,  and  subprogram 1  in  September  2016.  Subprogram  1,  totaling  $500 million  and \nconsisting  of  12  policy  actions,  mapped  the  government\u2019s  medium-term  expenditure  with  the \nRPJMN and SDGs and improved national and subnational PEM.6 Subprogram 2, totaling $500 \nmillion and comprising 13 policy actions, was approved in June 2018.7 It supported reforms linking \nspending  with  targets  under  the  RPJMN  and  SDGs,  and  strengthened  PEM  reforms  by \nsynchronizing planning with the budget cycle. All completed policy actions in subprograms 1 and \n2  have been maintained,  with no reversals.  The focus  of  subprogram  3 is  on  (i)  implementing \nSDG-related  reforms,  including  climate  mainstreaming,  social  assistance,  and  labor  market \nactivation  programs;  and  (ii)  making  fiscal  transfers  to  subnational  governments  more \nperformance-based. The inclusion of the post-program partnership framework (P3F), 2020\u20132025 \nwill enable ADB to continue supporting reforms in these areas and provide a platform to support \nthe government\u2019s focus on human capital development.  \n\n \n\n1  National Development Planning Agency. 2014.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fMacroeconomic context. Indonesia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average \n4. \nannual rate of 5.0% between 2014-2018, continuing a strong economic expansion since the Asian \nFinancial Crisis of 1997-98.8 The government has maintained a prudent fiscal stance, with deficits \nbelow the statutory limit of 3.0% of GDP and debt estimated at 30.0% of GDP in 2018. Inflation \nmoderated from 6.4% in 2014 to 3.2% in 2018 and is expected to remain subdued. As of 2017, \nall three major credit rating agencies put Indonesia's sovereign credit rating at investment grade \ndue to strong growth prospects, supportive macroeconomic policy, and structural reform agenda. \nHowever, the current account has remained in deficit since 2012, with reliance on portfolio capital \nflows for its financing, which exposes the country to external uncertainties.  \n \n5. \nDevelopment  problem.  The  proposed  subprogram  3  comes  at  a  critical  juncture  for \nIndonesia. It is designed to maintain the momentum of its development efforts at a time when the \nquality  of  public  spending  is  critical  to  realize  development  outcomes  under  the  RPJMN  and \nSDGs.  Since  2015,  the  government  has  made  substantial  progress  in  terms  of  increased  and \nbetter targeted public spending on SDG-related sectors such as infrastructure, health, education, \nand social protection. Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, improved from 0.41 \nin 2014 to 0.39 in 2016 at the beginning of subprogram 2, and 0.38 in 2019. Moreover, the national \npoverty  rate  declined  from  11.3%  in  2014  to  9.4%  in  2019.  However,  several  development \nindicators  still  lag  behind  the  established  targets.  The  Gini  coefficient  remains  higher  than  the \ntarget of 0.36 in the RPJMN, with inequality of opportunity a key challenge. The poverty rate has \nnot met the target of 7.0%\ua7f78.0% set in the RPJMN. About 20.8% of the total population, or 56 \nmillion people, are clustered marginally above the poverty line (Rp361,496 per month in 2017).9 \nThese people are vulnerable to economic shocks such as natural disasters and  fluctuations in \nfood and commodity prices, which erode their ability to earn incomes, and are at risk of being \npulled back into poverty.10 While the unemployment rate declined to 5.0% in 2019 from 6.2% in \n2015, job growth is predominantly in low-productivity, low-wage informal sectors. In 2019, 22.6% \nof youth are not in employment, education, or training (NEET), and the proportion is higher among \nyoung women (28.7%).11 Those categorized as NEET tend to come from low-income families and \nface job entry barriers, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality. \n \n6. \nIncreased investment in people and regional development needed. Recognizing the \nneed  to  optimize  fiscal  spending  for  inclusive  growth  and  development,  the  government  has \nstrengthened  its  fiscal  policy  framework  and  decentralization  efforts  to  improve  the  quality  of \nspending  and  service  delivery,  with  emphasis  on  the  poorest  40%  of  households.  The  energy \nsubsidy  reform  in  2015  has  resulted  in  a  substantial  reduction  of  budget  allocation  for  energy \nsubsidies. In the 2019 State Budget, the budget allocation for energy subsidies amounted to $9.9 \nbillion  (Rp140.3  trillion)\u2014less  than  half  of  $25.6 billion  (Rp362  trillion)  in  2014  (Figure).  This \nreform,  coupled  with  tax  administration  reforms,  created  fiscal  space  for  increased  pro-poor \nspending,  especially  in  infrastructure  and  social  protection  programs.  During  subprogram  2 \n(2018), despite lower fiscal deficits, budget allocations were increased as follows: (i) education, \nfrom $26.2 billion to $30.8 billion; (ii) health, from $6.5 billion to $7.6 billion; (iii) social protection, \nfrom $9.8 billion to $11.4 billion; and (iv) infrastructure, from $19.0 billion to $29.0 billion. However, \nto reach the government\u2019s Gini coefficient target of 0.36, reduce the poverty rate further, and meet \nthe  various  SDG  targets,  stronger  economic  and  fiscal  performance  as  well  as  continuous \ntargeted  spending  on  education,  health,  infrastructure,  and  social  protection  programs  will  be \n\n \n\n8   ADB forecasts growth of 5.1% for 2019 and 5.2% for 2020, with external uncertainty a key risk to the outlook. \n9  World Bank. 2019.

The government has identified the challenges it needs to address \nto meet its RPJMN and SDG targets.12 They include (i) insufficient implementation of the medium-\nterm framework and SDG programs, (ii) incomplete national public expenditure management, and \n(iii) fiscal transfers to subnational governments that are not performance-based. \n \n8. \nInsufficient  implementation  of  the  medium-term  framework  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment  Goal  programs.  Aligning  the  medium-term  expenditures  with  the  RPJMN  and \nSDG targets is a work in progress. Under subprogram 2 (footnote 7), the National Coordination \nTeam for SDGs, chaired by the President of Indonesia, was established. The team is mandated \nto undertake coordination, planning, monitoring, and reporting on SDG implementation, using a \nunified results framework, including mapping the SDGs against RPJMN targets. Despite progress, \nseveral constraints must be overcome to fully integrate the national development agenda into the \nexisting  medium-term  framework.  First,  although  the  government  has  issued  a  national  SDG \naction plan, the absence of financing, gender and climate mainstreaming strategies, and regional \naction plans, hampers SDG implementation. Consequently, the government\u2019s SDG priorities have \nnot been fully translated into actions at the national line agencies and subnational governments. \nSecond,  the  difficulty  in  meeting  the  SDG  targets  is  reflected  in  the  ad  hoc  implementation  of \nsocial  assistance  and  labor  market  activation  programs  to  address  poverty,  inequality,  and \nunemployment. Despite the focus on social assistance programs, implementation is often on a \nper  program  basis,  making  the  programs  less  efficient  and  effective.  Similarly,  labor  market \nactivation programs are in their infancy and do not specifically target youth and girls to shorten \nthe school-to-work transition.  \n \n9. \nIncomplete national public expenditure management framework. Although important \nprogress  has  been  made  during  earlier  subprograms  (footnotes  6  and  7),  the  national  public \n\n12 Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n\n2). \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fFiscal \n\ntransfers \n\nexpenditure  framework  is  still  incomplete,  which  weakens  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  public \nservice  delivery,  ultimately  undermining  development  outcomes.  The  constraints  are  (i)  lack of \ndetailed operating guidance for the use of multiyear contracts, (ii) the absence of legal certainty \nfor the Macroeconomic and Fiscal Policy Framework (KEMPPKF), and (iii) underutilization of the \nunified  planning  and  budget  system  (KRISNA).  The  2018  Presidential  Regulation  on  Public \nProcurement  of  Goods  and  Services  issued  under  subprogram  2  is  an  important  milestone  to \nimprove the efficiency of public procurement. The regulation aimed to address issues of multiple \nprocurement  contracts  and  delayed  disbursements,  especially  capital  expenditure  through  the \nimplementation of multiyear contracts. However, this implementation is limited until the Ministry \nof Finance (MOF) issues the implementing regulations, including defining the approval threshold \nfor multiyear contracts. Similarly, the KEMPPKF, which provides the framework to synchronize \nbudget preparation with the medium-term expenditure framework, is based on internal guidelines \nand lacks legal certainty. This reduces the accountability of the budget process. Finally, although \nthe KRISNA system was launched for the preparation of the 2018 budget under subprogram 2, \nthe system has not been fully utilized to review budget allocation, including for national priorities \nsuch as climate change and gender mainstreaming.  \n \n10. \nto  subnational  governments  are  not  performance-based. \nIntergovernmental fiscal transfer mechanisms are an integral part of fiscal decentralization and \nhave  seen  important  improvements  during  subprograms  1  and  2. 13  Under  the  earlier \nsubprograms,  the  channels  for  fiscal  transfers  were  expanded  and  allocation  increased \nsignificantly. The government also introduced reporting requirements to increase accountability \nof subnational government spending. However, the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system has \nnot addressed widening regional disparities as it is not performance-based. For example, in 2018 \nthe per capita income in Jakarta is about $17,571 (Rp248 million), almost 14 times higher than in \nEast Nusa Tenggara. Three constraints are present. First, no systematic procedures are in place \nin the disbursement of the Specific Allocation Fund (DAK) to synchronize activities across sectors \nand  line  ministries  to  avoid  overlapping  results.  Second,  the  methodology  for  allocation  of  the \nVillage Fund is generic and does not consider the different levels of development among villages, \nthus  failing  to  address  regional  disparity.  Third,  although  the  performance  indicators  of  the \nRegional Incentive Fund (DID) have been refined, they are still not directly linked to SDG targets \nsuch as reducing stunting and maternal mortality rates. These constraints have led to delays in \ndisbursement and inefficiencies in subnational government spending.  \n \nB. \n \nGovernment\u2019s  reform  agenda.  The  government\u2019s  medium-term  strategy  is  to  create \n11. \nsustainable and equitable economic growth by optimizing revenue, improving spending quality, \nreorienting  subsidy  schemes  to  targeted  social  assistance  programs,  and  decentralizing  fiscal \nauthority.  Together  with  the  commitment  to  increase  spending  in  pro-poor  sectors,  the \ngovernment is also increasing the quality of expenditure through PEM reforms. On the revenue \nside, Indonesia seeks to increase its tax-GDP ratio from about 10.0% in 2016 to 12.7%\u201313.3% \nby  2021,  eventually  reaching  15%.  To  achieve  this,  the  government  implemented  tax \nadministration reforms, including broadening the coverage of taxpayers. The reforms contributed \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n \n\n13 The main channels of intergovernmental fiscal transfers in Indonesia are (i) the General Allocation Fund to support \nrecurring spending; (ii) the Specific Allocation Fund (DAK) for specific investment expenditures aligned with national \npriorities; (iii) the Revenue-Sharing Fund, which covers natural resources; and (iv) the Regional Incentive Fund (DID), \nwhich provides an incentive to subnational governments to improve their performance. In addition, a fifth channel, \nthe Village Fund, was introduced in 2015 to help the lowest level of governments finance development. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fto increased tax collection of about $7 billion, equivalent to a tax-GDP ratio of 11.5%, in 2018. \nThe government is committed to sustain these reforms with support from development partners.  \n \n12. \nReform  accomplishments.  At  the  inception  of  the  programmatic  approach,  the \ngovernment agreed to accomplish six prior actions (triggers) and seven policy milestones as the \nbasis for subprogram 3.14 During the processing of subprogram 3, three prior actions (2, 7, and \n11) were strengthened to enhance their legal status and improve the governance of DAK fiscal \ntransfer. Subprogram 3 comprises 13 policy actions, all of which have been accomplished. \n \n13.  Medium-term  expenditure  aligned  with  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan \nand Sustainable Development Goal targets. This reform area supports SDG 3 (good health), \nSDG 4 (quality education), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 8 (decent work), and SDG 13 (climate \naction). The reforms also build on accomplishments under subprograms 1 and 2, including the \nissuance and implementation of presidential regulations on SDGs, which established the National \nCoordination Team for SDGs. There were four key accomplishments in subprogram 3. First, the \ngovernment  launched  the  SDG  road  map,  which  included  a  financing  chapter  for  SDG \nimplementation. This is critical, as the financing chapter assessed the costs of the various SDG \nprograms,  available  government  resources,  and  innovative  means  to  crowd  in  private  sector \nfinancing.  Climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation,  and  gender  mainstreaming  strategies, \nincluding  sex-disaggregated  data,  were  also  incorporated  in  the  road  map.  Second,  the \ngovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  SDGs  is  reflected  in  its  increased  budget  allocation  for  pro-poor \nexpenditure. From 2018 to 2019, budget allocations have increased as follows: (i) education, from \n$30.8 billion to $34.9 billion; (ii) health, from $7.6 billion to $8.7 billion; (iii) social protection from \n$11.4 billion to $14.2 billion; and (iv) infrastructure from $29.0 billion to $29.4 billion.15 \n \n14. \nThird, supplementing the budget increase, the government enhanced the efficiency and \ntargeting of its social assistance programs by combining the food assistance and conditional cash \ntransfer (PKH) programs into one smart card. The food assistance program, pilot tested during \nsubprogram 1 and extended to 1.4 million households during subprogram 2, has been expanded \nto 15.6 million households. The government also doubled the amount of benefit for the 10 million \nhouseholds of the PKH from Rp1.2 million in 2016 to Rp2.4 million in 2019. In addition, the benefit \nstructure  of  the  PKH  was  improved  from  a  flat  annual  rate  to  a  basic  assistance  rate,  with \nadditional benefits added according to family conditions such as the presence of pregnant women, \nchildren  under  five,  elderly,  and  family  members  with  disabilities.  The  National  Team  for \nAcceleration of Poverty Reduction estimated that reforms in the social assistance programs have \nthe potential to bring the national poverty rate down to about 6% and reduce the Gini coefficient \nto  0.376.16 Analysis  of  the  shift  from  the  rice  subsidy  program  to  noncash  social  assistance \nshowed  that  inclusion  of  poor  households  in  the  bottom  25%  improved  by  3%  in  2018,  and \ninclusion  of  non-targeted  households  decreased  from  9%  in  2017  to  5%  in  2018.  Finally,  to \naddress youth unemployment and enhance human capital development through skills upgrade of \nemployees,  the  government  pilot  tested  several  labor  market  activation  programs,  including \nvocational  training  facilities  for  religious  schools  and  skills  development  centers  to  inform  the \n\n \n\n14 Prior actions are considered to be loan disbursement conditions, and policy milestones strengthen the program. A \ncomparison of the original and the revised subprogram 3 reform actions is in Summary Assessment of Policy Actions \nUnder Subprogram 3 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n15 During subprogram 3 (from April 2018 to August 2019), the budget allocation for education, health, social assistance, \n\nand infrastructure had a real increase of 5.6% on an aggregate basis. \n\n16 The National Team for The Acceleration of Poverty Reduction. 2018.

This reform area contributes to the \nimplementation  of  SDG  9  (industry,  innovation,  and  infrastructure).  It  aims  to  strengthen  the \nalignment  of  budget  planning  with  the  medium-term  fiscal  objectives  and  to  address  the \nbottlenecks of state budget disbursement, by providing greater control over and flexibility of public \nexpenditures. The reforms also build on accomplishments under subprograms 1 and 2, including \nimproved budget transparency, issuance of presidential regulations on multiyear contracts, and \ndevelopment  of  the  KRISNA  system for  coherence between planning  of national  priorities and \nbudgeting. In subprogram 3, reforms were undertaken to improve the efficiency and effectiveness \nof  public  spending.  First,  more efficient  disbursement  of  capital  expenditures  by  line  ministries \nwas achieved with the issuance of implementing rules and regulations for multiyear contracts by \nthe MOF and National Public Procurement Agency. The regulation provided flexibility and enabled \nline ministries to approve their own multiyear contracts of up to $14 million for construction work \nand $1.4 million for the procurement of goods and services. Flexibility is also provided, so that \nline  ministries  can  request  to  extend  the  duration  and  increase  the  ceiling  of  the  multiyear \ncontracts, as well as reallocate the composition within the contract.  \n \n16. \nSecond, efficiency, disbursement, and financial reporting at the spending unit level was \nenhanced  through  automated  payment  and  online  monitoring  of  financial  management.  To \nachieve this, the MOF integrated the features of electronic budget requests and payment into one \napplication and expanded its use from 322 spending units in 2018 to more than 1,000 spending \nunits in 2019. Third, the government strengthened the effectiveness of the budget process with \nthe  full  implementation  of  KRISNA  in  the  MOF,  National  Development  Planning  Agency \n(BAPPENAS),  all  line  ministries,  and  subnational  governments  to  prepare  the  2019  budget. \nKRISNA  was  also  used  to review  gender-responsive  and  climate  adaptation  allocations  in  the \n2019 budget, which strengthened linkage with national priorities. The government also enhanced \nthe  medium-  to  long-term  effectiveness  of  public  spending  by  including  the  long-term  fiscal \nsustainability assessment and framework (up to 2045) as part of the KEMPPKF. This enabled the \ngovernment  to  plan  its  long-term  fiscal  commitment  to  include  factors  such  as  demographic \ntransition  and  long-term contingent  liabilities.  Further,  the  accountability  of  the  KEMPPKF  was \nimproved with the upgrade of its legal status to ministerial decree. \n \n17. \nFiscal  transfers  and  subnational  governments\u2019  spending  for  service  delivery \nimproved. This reform area strengthened the PEM of subnational governments. These reforms \ncut  across  several  SDGs  at  the  subnational  level,  including  good  health  (SDG  3),  quality \neducation  (SDG  4),  and  infrastructure  (SDG  9).  The  reforms  build  on  accomplishments  under \nsubprograms 1 and 2, including increased and more targeted intergovernmental fiscal transfers, \nand the  introduction  of  a  compliance mechanism to  strengthen monitoring  and  disbursements. \nThere were three key accomplishments in subprogram 3. First, the government increased budget \nallocations for the Village Fund from Rp60 trillion in 2018 to Rp70 trillion in 2019, and reformulated \nallocations toward poor and lagging villages.18 Subsequent disbursements of the Village Fund are \nperformance-based and subject to implementation progress. \n\n \n\n17 ADB. 2015. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for Support for the Nationwide Rollout of JobStart \n\nPhilippines. Manila; and Skillnet Ireland. https://www.skillnetireland.ie/. \n\n18 The basic allocation, which provides uniform budget allocation to each village, was reduced to 72% in 2019 from \n90% in 2017. The formula allocation, which depends on various characteristics of villages, including poverty rates, \nwas  increased  to  25%  in  2019  from  10%  in  2017.  The  government  also  introduced  affirmative  allocation,  which \nprovides additional allocations to villages in the three poorest income deciles, accounting for 3% of total allocations. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fSecond, the government implemented reforms to enhance the efficiency and governance \n18. \nof  DAK  for  local  infrastructure.  Subnational  governments  were  required  to  utilize  KRISNA  to \nsynchronize programs, projects, and activities to avoid overlapping end results across sectors, \nline ministries, and subnational governments. The disbursements of DAK are also conditional on \nproject  performance.  An  independent  internal  control  body,  which  reports  directly  to  the  city \nmayor,  was  introduced  to  undertake  an  oversight  role  in  DAK  utilization  and  disbursements. \nThese reforms improved budget absorption of the subnational governments from 84.2% in 2017 \nto 88.1% in 2018. Third, the government continued to increase DID transfers from Rp8.5 trillion \nin 2018 to Rp10 trillion in 2019 and strengthened the linkages between DID allocations and SDG \noutcomes. In 2019, the criteria for DID allocations included SDG-related performance indicators \nsuch as: (i) infant immunization, (ii) childbirth receiving professional services at medical facilities, \n(iii)  reduced  incidence  of  stunting,  and  (iv)  climate-resilient  infrastructure.  This  is  critical  to \nincentivize subnational governments to implement programs to meet the SDGs.  \n \n19. \nPost-program  partnership  framework.  The P3F  provides  for  a structured  dialogue  in \nthe  medium  term  and  represents  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  continue  supporting  the  government\u2019s \nSDG reform agenda via technical assistance (TA).19 Through the FPEMP, the government has \ndeveloped  the  SDG  implementation  framework  and  has  implemented  reforms  to  improve  the \nquality  of spending  through  PEM reforms  in the  national  and subnational  governments.  These \nreforms enabled the government to focus on implementing SDG initiatives to address inequality \nof opportunity. The P3F reflects the government\u2019s commitment to sustain reform and will enable \nADB to support specific initiatives including the conditional cash transfer program and programs \nto address unemployment. Key activities include implementing labor market activation programs \nto address youth unemployment and skills development, and better targeting the conditional cash \ntransfer program. This may lead to a new program to support the government\u2019s focus on human \ncapital development.  \n \n20. \nADB\u2019s experience. ADB has supported reforms in PEM and social assistance programs \nby recognizing the need for a building block approach in the medium term. In 2001, ADB provided \nTA to set up the public financial management and PEM framework at the national and subnational \nlevels.20 This  was  followed  by  support  for  the  government  to  build  a  modern  national  public \nfinancial  management  system,  including  a  public  debt  management  office,  in  2005. 21 In  the \nsecond phase, ADB provided support to introduce financial management information systems in \n147 local governments and to decentralize the tax framework.22 Since 2012, ADB has provided \nTA  to  improve  the  fiscal  sustainability  of  social  security,  strengthen  the  fiscal  decentralization \nframework, and improve fiscal risk management of contingent liabilities arising from accelerated \ninfrastructure  investment.  ADB  also  supported  the  government\u2019s  reform  agenda  to  improve  its \ninvestment climate, develop the capital market, and improve access to finance.23 \n\n \n\n19 ADB. 2016.

ADB\u2019s  experience,  particularly  through  its  support  of  the  Millennium \n21. \nDevelopment  Goals,  provided  three  key  lessons  that  have  been  incorporated  in  the  program \ndesign.24 First, PEM reforms are successful when they are linked to a country\u2019s commitment to \ninternational goals. The program linked reforms to SDGs. Such linkage provided an overarching \nframework for these reforms and obtained high-level commitment from the government. Second, \nADB learned that meeting SDG targets requires implementing reform programs at the subnational \nlevel.25 Implementation can be made more effective by providing an incentive framework for local \ngovernments  to  meet  SDG  indicators.  This  program  linked  DID  to  indicators  on  stunting  and \nmaternal  mortality.  Third,  gender  mainstreaming  reforms,  including  the  determination  of  sex-\ndisaggregated  indicators,  should  be  integrated  in  the  national  strategy  and  action  plan.  The \nprogram incorporated gender mainstreaming in the SDGs road map and regional action plans.  \n \nADB\u2019s  value  addition  to  program  design  and  implementation.  ADB\u2019s  long-term \n22. \nengagement and structured policy dialogue with the government helped prioritize and sequence \nlegal,  policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  reforms.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  spans  all  three  reform \nareas. In the area of SDG implementation, ADB supported development of the SDGs Roadmap \nwhich included the financing chapter and integrated gender mainstreaming strategy (footnote 19). \nThe  Roadmap  estimated  that  Indonesia  needs  to  spend  over  $700  billion  for  SDG-related \nprograms from 2020 to 2030 and provided the strategy for the government to finance this including \nthrough  private  sector  financing.  In  addition,  ADB  began  pilot  testing  labor  market  activation \nprograms  for  youth  unemployment  and  skills  upgrades,  based  on  experience  from  successful \nimplementation of similar programs in the Philippines such as the JobStart program (footnote 17). \nIn the area of national PEM reforms, ADB provided support for the government to draft the long-\nterm fiscal framework report, which was attached to the KEMPPKF. The 2019 budget benefited \nfrom  such  analysis.  ADB  also  improved  governance  by  supporting  capacity  development  of \ngovernment  internal  auditors  and  public  finance  officers. 26  At  the  subnational  level,  ADB \nsupported capacity building for PKH supervisors on case management, complaints handling, and \nimplementation of PKH in remote and disadvantaged areas.27  \n \n23. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  The  government  leads  development  partner \ncoordination in the areas of PEM reforms and SDG implementation. ADB coordinates dialogue \nand activities closely with the IMF and the World Bank. ADB joined the IMF\u2019s Public Investment \nManagement  Assessment  mission  in  2019  and  the  PEM  reforms  under  the  program  are \ncomplementary to the World Bank\u2019s Third Fiscal Reform Development Policy Loan approved in \nMay 2019.28 Following cofinancing of subprograms 1 and 2, German development cooperation \nthrough KfW approved cofinancing of \u20ac500 million for subprogram 3. ADB and KfW conducted \njoint missions to discuss the policy matrix, and coordinated SDG reforms with the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme. ADB also coordinated with the bilateral development agencies of the \ngovernments of Australia, France, and the United States on PEM reforms.29 \n\n \n\nLoan for Subprogram 3 to the Republic of Indonesia for the Financial Market Development and Inclusion Program. \nManila. \n\n24 Independent  Evaluation  Department.  2017.

Three out of four outcome indicators in the Design \nand Monitoring  Framework  have  been  achieved  early.  The  proportion  of  targeted  national  and \nsubnational spending has increased by 22.3% from the baseline of Rp995.0 trillion ($70.4 billion) \nin  2015  to  Rp1,216.6  trillion  ($86.1  billion)  in  2019.  The  2017  Public  Expenditure  Financial \nAccountability (PEFA) report showed improvement in the indicator on  expenditure composition \noutturn, which rose from a D in 2012 to C+ in 2017.30 This target is now revised upward to B. The \nrating for aggregate expenditure outturn remained the same, as budget realization was 88.6% for \n2015  and  89%  for  2016.  However,  there  have  been  significant  improvements  for  the  budget \nrealization which recorded 94% for 2017 and 99% for 2018, respectively. In addition to the PEFA, \nthe  Open  Budget  Index  reported  improved  scores  for  transparency  and  budget  oversight. \nLikewise, the IMF reported improvements in the quality and efficiency of public investment.31 The \nprogram impact assessment estimates that the economic and social benefits of the program were \n$4.8 billion\u2013$7.6 billion.32 The benefits are derived from increased and targeted public spending, \nequivalent to adding an annual average of 6.5%\ua7f710.4% to priority sector spending.  \n \nD. \n \n25. \nThe government has requested a single tranche loan of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 3.33\n The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace  period  of  3  years  with  a  straight-line  repayment  method  and  an  annual  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe  draft  loan  agreement.  The  average  loan  maturity  is  9.25  years,  and  there  is  no  maturity \npremium payable to ADB. KfW approved cofinancing of \u20ac500 million. The loan size is based on \nIndonesia\u2019s  financing  needs,  the  development  impact  of  the  policy  reform  package,  and \ndevelopment spending arising from the reforms. For 2019, the government\u2019s projected total gross \nborrowing requirement is estimated at $59.6 billion. To finance the deficit, the government plans \nto raise about $53.4 billion from the issuance of securities, $5.9 billion from official development \nassistance, and $0.3 billion from nonofficial development assistance sources. Climate mitigation \nis estimated to cost $26.04 million, and climate adaptation is estimated to cost $57.29 million. \n \nE. \n \n26.  \nThe MOF\u2019s Fiscal Policy Agency, as the executing agency, is responsible for coordinating \nprogram-related  reforms.  Implementing  agencies  include  the  directorates  general  of  budget, \ntreasury, and fiscal balance in MOF; and BAPPENAS. The implementation period for subprogram \n3 is from April 2018 to August 2019. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n27. \nSafeguards.  Subprogram  3  will  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  affect \nindigenous  people  or  the  environment.

Subprogram 3 is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming at \n28. \nentry. Key reforms that mainstreamed gender included integrating gender strategy into the SDG \nRoadmap,  improvement  of  the  PKH  to  provide  additional  benefit  for  families  with  pregnant \nwomen, elderly and people with disabilities, and inclusion of indicator to reduce maternal mortality \nfor  the  regional  incentive  fund.  In  addition,  increased  expenditure  in  education,  health,  and \ninfrastructure will reduce poverty and help the bottom 40% of the population.  \n \n29. \nGovernance.  In  2017,  Indonesia  scored  either  A  or  B  (both  considered  above  basic \nalignment with international good practice) on 17 out of 31 indicators in the World Bank\u2019s PEFA \nreport (footnote 30). Indicators with particularly good assessment results include transparency of \npublic  finance,  and  accounting  and  reporting.  Government  regulations  issued  in  2017 \nstrengthened the legal and regulatory frameworks for public financial management, mandating \ncoordination  between  BAPPENAS  and  the  MOF  in  planning,  budgeting,  and  subsequent \nregulations.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government. \n \nRisk and mitigating measures. Two key risks have been identified in the program.34 The \n30. \nfirst pertains to macroeconomic risks, particularly in relation to tighter global financial conditions. \nThis is mitigated by Indonesia\u2019s sound macroeconomic fundamentals, and appropriate monetary \nand fiscal policies. Second is the inadequate capacity, especially at the subnational level. ADB is \nproviding  TA  to  improve  subnational  government  capacity  for  SDG  implementation  (para.  22). \nModerate risks include ineffective implementation of the medium-term expenditure framework and \nperformance-based budgeting, and lower revenue that may hamper critical expenditure for SDG \nimplementation.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n31. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement as described in detail  in the  loan \nagreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n32. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan  of  $500,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  subprogram  3  of  the  Fiscal  and  Public \nExpenditure Management Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms \nand conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n34 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n2 October 2019 \n\n \n\n\fCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nHousehold income inequality reduced (National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2015\u20132019)a \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\n \n\nResults Chain \n\nEffect of the \nReform \nSocial sector and \ninfrastructure \nspending improved \n\nReform Areas \nunder \nSubprogram 3 \n1.
