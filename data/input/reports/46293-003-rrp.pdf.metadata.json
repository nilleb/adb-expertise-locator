It will contribute to the creation of 27,000 tourism-related jobs in the \nLao PDR by: (i) paving 70 kilometers (km) of rural roads to open new areas for private tourism \ninvestment and improve access to markets and social services for 15,000 people; (ii) improving \nenvironmental  services  in  areas  important  for  cross-border  tourism  to  reduce  public  health \nhazards  for  35,000  residents  and  2.4  million  annual  visitors,  beginning  in  2019;  and  (iii) \nfacilitating business support services for at least 500 small and medium-sized enterprises.3 The \nproject  will  strengthen  regional  cooperation  and  integration  by  implementing  regional  tourism \nstandards,  promoting  multicountry  tour  circuits,  and  supporting  structured  policy  dialogue  to \nreduce  nonphysical  barriers  to  travel.  The  project  investment  plan  is  in  line  with  the  GMS \nTourism Sector Strategy,4 and the government\u2019s National Tourism Strategy, 2012\u20132020.5 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nRegional  context.  Among  country  groupings  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  the  GMS  has  a \nstrong  comparative  advantage  in tourism  as  a result  of  its  diverse  cultural  and natural  assets, \ngood  international  air  and  land  transport  connections  between  gateway  destinations,  and \nsurging  demand  for  intraregional  leisure  travel.  International  tourist  arrivals  are  growing  by \n12.4% per year; in 2012 arrivals reached an all-time high of 44.8 million, and generated $44.3 \nbillion  in  receipts.  Tourism  supports  7  million  jobs  and  creates  positive  economic  impacts  in \nother  service  and  productive  sectors.  About  one-third  of  international  arrivals  visit  at  least  two \ncountries while travelling in the GMS and millions of residents cross borders each year for day \ntrips.  GMS  countries  are  eager  to  strengthen  subregional  tourism  cooperation  and  recently \nreaffirmed  their  commitment  to  promote  cross-border  tourism  under  the  GMS  Economic \nCooperation  Program  Strategic  Framework,  2012\u20132022. 6  Nevertheless,  underinvestment  in \npublic  infrastructure  beyond  the  major  gateways  remains  a  critical  constraint  that  restrains \nexpansion of private tourism enterprises and dispersal of benefits to less-developed areas.7 \n \n4. \nNational  priorities. The Lao PDR received 3.33 million international tourists in 2012, a \n22% increase over 2011, but accounting for less than 8% of GMS arrivals. Travel and tourism \ncontribute  5.3%  of  gross  domestic  product  and  support  134,000  jobs,  equal  to  4.5%  of  total \nemployment.8 The government\u2019s National Tourism Strategy is consistent with the GMS Tourism \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

London. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nSector  Strategy,  which  prioritizes  transport  and  urban  infrastructure  upgrades,  education  and \ntraining,  and  policy  enhancements  to  improve  the  business  enabling  environment.  The  2005 \nTourism Law provides the legal basis for the strategy, setting out the parameters for creation of \na  sustainable  tourism  industry  that  contributes  to  national  development  and  strengthens \ninternational  cooperation.  Strategic  objectives  are  to:  (i)  generate  employment  and  income for \nlocal  people,  (ii)  strengthen  tourism  destination  management,  (iii)  expand  public\u2013private \ncooperation in tourism, and (iv) diversify tourism products and services. The estimated cost of \nthe government\u2019s investment program for tourism between 2011 and 2015 is $118 million. \n \n5. \nKey issues. Although the Lao PDR has many cultural and natural tourist attractions with \ngood development potential, tourism is highly concentrated in Vientiane Capital, which accounts \nfor 43% of international arrivals and 47% of hospitality investment. Women comprise about half \nof  tourism  workers;  however,  many  are  employed  in  low-skill,  low-wage  jobs,  and  are \nunderrepresented  in  tourism  management.  The  key  impediments  to  more  inclusive  and \ngeographically  dispersed  growth  are  insufficient  last-mile  transport  infrastructure  in  secondary \ndestinations;  weak market  linkages between the  tourism  industry  and other  economic  sectors; \nand  limited  institutional  capacity  to  promote  local  tourism-related  enterprise  development. \nConsequently, at least 40% of tourism receipts leave the country in the form of tourism-related \nimports.  Inadequate  environmental  infrastructure  and  low  service  standards  suppress  tourist \nlength of stay, spending, and yield, resulting in average receipts per visitor of about $154\uf0bethe \nlowest in the GMS and much less than the benchmark of $1,390 in Asia and the Pacific.9 \n \n6. \nTo  remove  these  constraints  and  engender  a  more  equitable  pattern  of  tourism \ndevelopment, the project will upgrade access roads that link rural tourist attractions with urban \ncenters, improve environmental services in areas important for tourism, and support training and \ncapacity building for destination management organizations and local entrepreneurs.10  Project \ninvestments  are  designed  to  catalyze  additional  private  investment  in  tourism  superstructure \nand  services,  boost  tourist  spending  and  related  job  creation  in  underdeveloped  areas,  and \nensure that tourism growth is environmentally and socially sustainable.11 \n \n7. \nRelated policies and strategies. The project is consistent with the Lao PDR\u2019s Seventh \nNational  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  which  aims  to  promote  sustainable \neconomic growth and reduce poverty and inequality. Project outputs will contribute to economic \ndiversification  and  human  resource  development,  and  strengthen  the  participation  of  women \nand  ethnic  groups  in  national  development.  The  emphasis  on  improving  connectivity  between \nurban and rural areas, strengthening value chains linked to the rapidly growing tourism sector, \nand  creating  jobs  for  unskilled  and  semiskilled  workers  is  closely  aligned  with  the  overarching \nobjectives  of  the  ADB\u2019s  Lao  PDR  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016:  inclusive  and \nsustainable economic growth and poverty reduction.12 The project reinforces regional efforts to \nincrease cross-border investment flows and develop the GMS corridors into economic corridors.  \n \n8. \nDevelopment  coordination.  The  GMS  Tourism  Working  Group  is  the  forum  for \ncoordinating regional tourism sector assistance. Senior GMS tourism officials and ADB co-chair \nsemiannual  working  group  meetings  to  guide  implementation  of  the  GMS  Tourism  Sector \nStrategy  and  identify  policy  issues  for  elevation  to  the  annual  GMS  tourism  ministers  meeting \nand  the  triennial  GMS  summit.  In  the  Lao  PDR,  sector  coordination  is  led  by  the  Ministry  of \n                                                \n9  United Nations World Tourism Organization. 2013.

Parallel \nfinancing opportunities will be actively sought during implementation. \n \nLessons.  ADB\u2019s  GMS  tourism  sector  assistance  program  and  completed  tourism \n9. \nprojects in the Lao PDR are rated successful.14 Lessons from past projects include the need to \n(i) analyze tourism demand in project areas to guide selection of infrastructure investments, (ii) \nimprove  cross-sector  coordination  and  build  synergies  with  other  ADB  assistance,  (iii)  provide \ncapacity  building  for  project  management  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  (iv) \npromote  tourism-related  private  enterprise  development  alongside  infrastructure  to  expand \nincome-generating  opportunities  for  local  residents.  Applying  these  lessons,  the  project  has \nselected  relevant  infrastructure  subprojects  based  on  robust  market  analysis, 15  as  well  as \ncomplementarities with other ADB and development partner assistance for urban development, \nwater  supply  and  sanitation,  vocational  training,  and  tourism.  Capacity  building  for  entities \nresponsible for infrastructure O&M, and parallel support for small enterprises led by women and \nethnic  groups,  will  enhance  the  sustainability  of  project  outputs  and  ensure  benefits  reach \nvulnerable  groups.  The  project  has  deliberately  selected  infrastructure  and  capacity-building \ninterventions  that  will  connect  lower-income  groups  to  basic  services  and  markets  and  enable \nthem to access tourism employment, education, health care, and other opportunities. \n \nSpecial features. The project will (i) strengthen collaboration between government, the \n10. \nprivate sector, civil society, and local communities to improve tourism destination management; \n(ii) demonstrate how tourist entry fees and charges can help finance the maintenance of public \ngoods  such  as  heritage  sites,  roads,  and  environmental  services;  (iii)  strengthen  knowledge \npartnerships  among  GMS  and  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  members;  and  (iv) \nleverage service sector opportunities to accelerate widening of the GMS corridors into economic \ncorridors by linking secondary tourism destinations with increasingly affluent regional markets. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  increased  tourism  employment  for  people  living  in \nunderdeveloped segments of the GMS Central Corridor. The outcome will be increased tourism \nreceipts  in  Champassak,  Khammouane,  Luangprabang,  and  Oudomxay.  By  2019,  aggregate \nannual tourism receipts in the project provinces will increase to $330 million, helping to stimulate \nthe  creation  of  27,000  additional  tourism-related  jobs  by  2025.  Based  on  current  workforce \nparticipation rates, it is expected that 50% of these jobs will be held by women. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe project outputs are (i) improved last-mile tourism access infrastructure, (ii) improved \nenvironmental  services  in  cross-border  tourism  centers,  (iii)  strengthened  institutional  capacity \nto  promote  inclusive  tourism  growth,  and  (iv)  effective  project  implementation  and  knowledge \nmanagement.

Contract  packaging  will  attract  contractors  with  suitable \nqualifications  and  ensure  efficient  procurement.  Capacity-building  programs  will  help  small \nentrepreneurs to become more competitive and improve the business enabling environment. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nAn  economic  analysis  was  conducted  for  all  infrastructure  subprojects  following  ADB \nguidelines.21 Quantified  benefits  are  (i)  increased  tourism  receipts  arising  from  an  increase  in \ntourists  visiting  project-supported  destinations  and  staying  0.4\u20131.1  days  longer;  (ii)  vehicle \noperating  cost  savings  from  reductions  in  road  roughness;  and  (iii)  for  the  Chom  Ong  Cave \naccess road improvement subproject, a combination of tourism benefits, vehicle operating cost \nsavings, and increased income for farmers that will arise from increased agricultural production. \nThe  base  case  results  indicate  all  subprojects  are  economically  viable  with  an  estimated \neconomic internal rate of return exceeding the assumed economic opportunity cost of capital of \n12%. Returns range from 13.0% for Chom Ong Cave access improvements to 37.8% for access \n                                                \n19 ADB.  2002.

Findings of the analysis are consistent with the \npast  performance  of  other  ADB-financed  public  tourism  infrastructure  in  the  Lao  PDR;  when \nsimilar assumptions were applied, the infrastructure generated internal rates of return of 13.2%\u2013\n50.3%.22 All subprojects remain viable under adverse scenarios tested.23 \n \n23. \ntheir \ncomponents  were  considered  nonrevenue-generating,  and  a financial  sustainability  analysis  of \nthe  departments  of  public  works  and  transport (DPWTs) that  will  be  responsible for O&M  was \ntherefore  completed.  Based  on  historical  revenue  and  expenditure  statements,  the  analysis \nfound  that  Khammouane  and  Luangprabang  DPWTs  will  have  sufficient  funds  to  cover \nincremental O&M, but Oudomxay DPWT will require additional funds for periodic maintenance \nof the Chom Ong Cave access road. The government has committed to provide sufficient funds \nfor  this  purpose  through  an  assurance  in  the  loan  agreement.  A  separate  analysis  for  small \ninfrastructure under the responsibility of DICTs found that revenue from tourist user fees will be \nsufficient to cover O&M costs of all facilities developed by the project.25 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nthe \n\nimprest \n\nfund  procedures,  suggests \n\n24. \nAn  assessment  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies\u2019  capacity  to  undertake \nprocurement  and  financial  management  envisaged  under  the  project,  including  the  use  of  the \nimplementation \nstatement  of  expenditure  and \narrangements and internal control systems are suitable.26 Measures to mitigate risks identified\u2014\nsuch  as  the  potential  for  corruption  from  weak  procurement  oversight  and  the  shortage  of \nfinancial  management  skills\u2014will  be  addressed  by  applying  standard  ADB  bidding  documents \nand embedding consultants in the PCU and PIU to provide on-the-job training and help prepare \na  project-specific  financial  management  manual.  While  incumbent  MICT  staff  members  have \nexperience  with  ADB  guidelines,  all  counterparts  will  receive  additional  training  to  ensure \nprocurement,  financial  management,  and  disbursement  are  undertaken  following  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Compliance with ADB\u2019s financial reporting and external audit requirements \nwill  be  monitored  by  review  missions  and  normal  project  supervision.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and \nMICT.

Initial  consultations  with  residents,  government  officials,  and  civil  society  confirm  broad \nsupport for the project. Consultation with these groups will continue throughout the project cycle \nfollowing the consultation and participation plan and stakeholder communications strategy in the \nPAM.  The  project  includes  resources  to  assist  counterparts  effectively  implement  social  and \nenvironmental  safeguards.  Monitoring  requirements  and  appropriate  grievance  redress \nmechanisms are in the safeguards documents. \n \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  prepared  for  the  project\u2019s  area  of \n27. \ninfluence,  based  on  current  information.  The  potential  environmental  impacts  are  not \nirreversible,  diverse,  or  unprecedented.  Expected  impacts  and  risks  are  site  specific,  with \nappropriate  mitigating  measures  in  subproject-specific  environmental  management  plans \n(EMPs).  Works  in  sensitive  environments  such  as  caves  and  near  physical  cultural  resources \nwere  designed  in  consultation  with  DICTs,  following  international  good  practice  and  national \nlaws  and  regulations.  Infrastructure  subprojects  falling  within  the  boundaries  of  the  United \nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization World Heritage Site in Luangprabang \nwill be consistent with the current safeguarding and enhancement plan. The IEE and EMPs will \nbe  updated  and  finalized  at  the  detailed  design  stage  with  involvement  of  cave  experts  and \ncultural  heritage  specialists.  Updated  versions  of  the  documents  will  be  cleared  by  the \ngovernment  and  ADB,  posted  to  the  ADB  website,  and  form  part  of  bidding  documents.  The \nfinal IEE and EMPs will guide construction supervision and the preparation of site management \nplans with environmentally sensitive O&M guidelines. \n \n28. \nThe  project  will  have  minor  LAR  impacts,  involving  no  physical  dislocation  of  affected \npersons. Resettlement plans were prepared for each subproject with LAR, commensurate with \nthe  extent  and  degree  of  the  expected  impacts.  Improvement  of  the  access  road  and  ferry \nterminal  in  Chomphet  District  will  cause  temporary  disruption  of  21  businesses  and  require \npartial dismantling of nonresidential structures. The upgrading of the 54 km rural road to Chom \nOng Cave will require minor land acquisition from six households. Road upgrades to Xang Cave \nwill  result  in  minor  loss  of  garden  areas  and  trees  of  three  households.  Initial  costs  of  land \nacquisition  and  compensation  are  estimated  at  $53,000.  This  amount  is  considered  adequate \nbased  on  the  census  and  inventory  of  losses  prepared  in  consultation  with  affected  persons. \nProject information was disclosed to all affected persons and a cutoff date for their inclusion in \nthe  resettlement  plans  was  established  during  resettlement  consultations.  The  project \ninformation booklet will be updated and disseminated during the detailed measurement survey.  \n\n                                                \n28 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 The  project  will  collaborate  with  the  Child  Safe  Tourism  Campaign  in  cooperation  with  World  Vision,  the  United \n\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime, and Interpol. \n\n30 ADB. 2011.
