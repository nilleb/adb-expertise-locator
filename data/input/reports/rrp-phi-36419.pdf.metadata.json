Compliance  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nenvironmental guidelines as applicable to financial intermediaries \nwill be required. \n \nCategory C: Involuntary resettlement \nCategory C: Impact on indigenous people \n \nThe  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Development  Support  Project \n(SMEDSP) \nintegral  part  of  coordinated  support  of \ndevelopment partners to help the Government implement its SME \nDevelopment  Plan  2004\u20132010.  The  SMEDSP  and  associated \nprojects will (i) support policy initiatives to strengthen the enabling \nenvironment  by  simplifying  registration  and  licensing  processes, \nestablish  a  Philippine  business  registry,  and  develop  a  blueprint \nfor a movables collateral registry; (ii) help meet the funding gap for \nSMEs  by  providing  a  credit  line  to  SB  Corporation,  with  a \nGovernment  guarantee,  aimed  at  viable  SMEs  that  currently  do \nnot have access to bank financing, and  a partial credit guarantee \n(PCG) \nto \nencourage  selected  private  sector  financial  institutions  to  expand \ntheir  SME  portfolio,  particularly \nto  qualified  medium-size \nenterprises outside the target client group of SB Corporation; (iii) \nstrengthen  SB  Corporation\u2019s  credit  underwriting  and \nrisk \nmanagement;  and  (iv)  help  establish  a  comprehensive  and \ncredible credit information system through an equity investment in \nthe  planned  credit  information  bureau  (CIB).  The  SMEDSP  is \nprocessed in parallel with technical assistance (TA) Strengthening \nSME  Credit  Management  Systems  and  a  Japan  Fund  for \nInformation  and  Communication  Technology  (JFICT)  project \nDeveloping  the  Philippine  business  registry,  which  will  support \nitems (i) and (iii).  \n \nIn 2002, SMEs in the Philippines contributed 32% of value added, \nand  accounted  for  8%  of  business  establishments  and  31%  of \nemployment.  SMEs\u2019  direct  contribution  to  total  manufacturing \nexports  was  approximately  24%,  but  the  indirect  contribution  as \nsuppliers  to  large  exporters  is  likely  to  be  higher.  SMEs  thus \ncomprise a vital subsector in the economy in terms of employment \nand  value  added.  However,  effective  SME  operation \nis \nconstrained by lack of supportive policies; cumbersome and costly \n\nfacility  without  Government  counter  guarantee \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n \n\n \n\nto  provide \n\nregistration  and  licensing  processes;  lack  of  a  national  business \nregistry  and  collateral  registry;  and  lack  of  comprehensive  credit \ninformation, which hampers SME lending.  \n \nAccess  to  and  availability  of  finance,  another  key  constraint, \nreflects (i) banks\u2019 reluctance to expand SME lending following the \nAsian  financial  crisis  (SME  lending  is  perceived  to  be  costly  and \nrisky  in  relation  to  revenues  generated  compared  with  other \ninvestments) and lack of credible credit information; and (ii) SMEs\u2019 \ndifficulty  preparing  and  presenting  credible  business  plans  and \nrealistic cash-flow estimates, and providing sufficient collateral for \nbank lending. The Government and development community have \nthe  development  of  business \nresponded  by  supporting \ndevelopment  services  (BDS)  to  help  SMEs  with  business  plans, \nfinancial  management,  marketing,  and  accounting.  In  1991  the \nGovernment  set  up  SB  Corporation \nloans  and \nguarantees to SMEs, in particular those that are viable and either \nneed  loans  below  banks\u2019  minimum  limit  or  cannot  meet  banks\u2019 \nstringent collateral requirements.  \n \nIn  July  2004,  the  Government  presented  the  SME  Development \nPlan  2004\u20132010  to  improve  the  enabling  environment  for  SMEs \nand thereby contribute to increased SME share in value added\u2014\nfrom  32%  to  40%  by  2010.  President  Arroyo\u2019s  10-point  agenda \nand  the  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan  (MTPDP) \n2004\u20132010  also  highlight  SME  support  as  central  to  creating  at \nleast  6  million \nthe \nestablishment  of  a  credit  bureau  as  one  of  the targeted  activities \nto promote SME development. \n \nThe  SME  Development  Plan  includes  a  number  of  activities  to \nimprove the enabling environment for SMEs, i.e., from registration \nand  licensing  to  micro  issues  of  providing  BDS  throughout  the \ncountry, assisting SMEs with matching, market access information \nand  even  product  design.  The  plan  does  not  address  the  overall \npolicy  and  regulatory  framework  affecting  enterprises,  large  and \nsmall,  such  as  financial  sector  issues,  taxation,  competition \nframework,  corporate  recovery  and  insolvency  law,  and  need  for \nmore developed infrastructure.  \n \nThe  SMEDSP  is  to  help  the  Government  implement  the  SME \nDevelopment  Plan, \nin  cooperation  with  other  development \npartners, \nto  promote  SME  development  and  broad-based \neconomic  growth.  In  President  Arroyo\u2019s  10-point  agenda  and  the \nMTPDP, the concrete target is to create at least 6 million jobs in 6 \nyears by promoting SMEs, tripling financing available, supporting \nentrepreneurs, and developing land for agricultural business. The \nSMEDSP and associated projects will support this objective by (i) \nimproving  the  enabling  environment  for  SMEs,  (ii)  stimulating \nSME  development  by \nfinance  and \naugmenting  financial  resources  at  SB  Corporation,  and  (iii) \n\njobs  by  2010.  The  MTPDP \n\nfacilitating  access \n\nincludes \n\nto \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nexpanding  private  sector  lending  for  medium-size  enterprises \nsupported by a PCG. This combination of a public sector loan and \nprivate  sector  PCG  allows  for  targeting  of  different  segments  of \nthe SME market and catalyzing expanded SME finance through a \ndemonstration  effect.  The  SMEDSP  will  effectively  complement \nefforts  by  other  development  partners \nthat  concentrate  on \nproviding  BDS  to  SMEs  nationwide,  as  well  as  efforts  to  support \npolicymaking  by  the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry.  The \nassociated  projects  will  support  targeted  SME  issues;  macro \npolicies are beyond the scope of this Project.  \n \nThe total cost is estimated at $38.5 million equivalent.  \n\nADB  will  provide  a  credit  line  of  \u00a52,746,625,000  ($25  million \nequivalent) \nto  SB  Corporation.  ADB\u2019s  proportion  of  SB \nCorporation  funding  for  relending  and  onlending  will  not  exceed \n65%, based on present funding sources. \n \nA  loan  of  \u00a52,746,625,000  ($25  million  equivalent)  with  the \nguarantee of the Republic of the Philippines, from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a \n15-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  36  months,  an  interest \nrate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n \n \nSB  Corporation  will  onlend  the  loan  to  SMEs  in  local  currency. \nThe  Philippine  Government  will  bear  the  exchange  rate  risk,  and \nwill  charge  up  to  5%  per  annum  for  the  guarantee  including  the \nforeign  exchange  risk  cover.  However,  the  rate  is  still  subject  to \nreview  by  the  Department  of  Finance  (DOF),  which  will  issue \nrules to implement the foreign exchange risk cover and guarantee \npremiums  payment  structure  once  the  review  is  completed.  SB \nCorporation  will  use  the  loan  for  its  wholesale  lending  via \naccredited  participating  financial  institutions  (PFIs)  and  its  retail \nlending.  SB  Corporation\u2019s  wholesale  lending  products  range  in \nsize  from  P100,000  ($1,790)  to  P15,000,000  ($267,900)  with \nmaturities from 1\u20135 years. In the wholesale lending program, as of \n1  June  2005,  SB  Corporation  was  charging  PFIs  the  following \nrelending  rates:  7.2%  up  to  90  days,  7.5%  91\u2013181  days,  7.8% \n182\u2013270  days,  8.2%  271\u2013360  days,  9.2%  1\u20133  years,  9.7%  3\u20135 \nyears, and 10.2% 5\u20137 years. The PFIs add charges ranging from \n4\u20138% to cover their costs and reflect the perceived risk. The retail \nloans range from P200,000 ($3,670) to P5,000,000 ($89,200) with \nmaturities up to 5 years. The interest rates as of 1 June 2005 are \n9.5%  for  fully  secured  loans  up  to  1  year,  13.8%  for  1\u20133  years, \nand  14.5%  for  3\u20135  years.  An  additional  charge  is  made  for \npartially secured loans, where at least 50% is secured, of 1% per \nannum, and 2% for less than 50% secured loans.

Monthly  charges  to  PFIs  are \ncomputed  based  on  80%  of  MART  1  (Money  Market  Association \nof the Philippines) plus 0.1%, plus gross receipts tax (GRT) while \ninterest rates on retail loans are computed based on Sulong (SME \nUnified  Lending  Opportunities \nfor  National  Growth)rates \ndetermined by the government financial institutions. \n \nThe  loan  comprises  two  phases.  The  first  $10  million  equivalent \nwill  be  available  for  drawdown  upon  loan  effectiveness  by  SB \nCorporation for relending to accredited PFIs under the wholesale \nlending  window.  Following  a  comprehensive  review  after  about \n18  months  to  assess  the  loan\u2019s  utilization  and  impact  and  the \noutcome  of \n(TA)\u2014\nStrengthening  SME  Credit  Management  Systems,  another  $15 \nmillion  equivalent  will  be  available  for  drawdown.  Of  this  $15 \nmillion,  $10  million  equivalent  will  be  for  relending  through  PFIs, \nand  $5  million  equivalent  for  SB  Corporation\u2019s  retail  lending \nutilizing  enhanced  techniques  developed  under  the  associated \nTA .  \n \nThe SMEDSP will be implemented over 5 years. The closing date \nfor  submission  of  drawdown  applications,  and  approval  and \nauthorization  for  disbursements  from  the  loan,  will  be  within  5 \nyears  of  the  date  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  closing  date  for \ndisbursements  will  be  6  months  after  the  closing  date  of \nwithdrawal application, approval, and authorization. \n \nOctober 2010 \n \n\ntechnical  assistance \n\nSB Corporation \n \nSB Corporation will implement the SMEDSP. The Southeast Asia \nGovernance  Finance  and  Trade  Division  (SEGF)  of  ADB  will \nmonitor implementation. \n \nProvisions  of  ADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement  applicable  to \ndevelopment finance institutions will be followed. All procurement \nwill  be  made  from  ADB  member  countries.  Subborrowers  will  be \nencouraged  to  procure  goods  through  international  competitive \nbidding  and/or \nshopping  when  applicable. \nProcurement  will  be  conducted  transparently  and  in  conformity \nwith the ADB anticorruption policy. \n \nADB  will  provide  a  PCG  to  selected  PFIs  without  Government \ncounterguarantee. The PCG will have an overall limit of P1 billion \n(equivalent to $18.40 million at current exchange rates); the PFIs \nwill  cover  the  remaining  risk  of  P1  billion.  In  addition  to  the \nproposed  50/50  risk-sharing  scheme  between  ADB  and  the  PFI, \nADB  will  negotiate  a  first-loss  provision  (based  on  the  PFI\u2019s  loss \n\ninternational \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nTerms  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nEstimated             \nCompletion   Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements  \n\n \nEquity Investment in the \nCredit Information \nBureau (CIB) \n\nexperience)  to  be  entirely  assumed  by  the  PFI.  Subject  to \napproval  from  the  Director  General  of  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector \nOperations  Department \n(PSOD)  and  ADB\u2019s  Guarantee \nCommittee,  as  well  as  satisfactory  due  diligence  by \nPSOD, primarily those local banks that are accredited in the ADB \nregional  Trade  Finance  Facilitation  Program  and  international \nbanks will be considered for inclusion in the PCG facility.  \n \nThe  PFIs  will  pay  ADB  a  predetermined  fee,  which  will  be \nreviewed  at  least  annually.  The  fee  will  be  market-driven  and \ndetermined  for  each  PFI  based  on  the  risks  identified  during  the \ndue diligence process and the risk-sharing mechanism agreed to \nby ADB and the PFI. The PCG facility is expected to be extended \nto  2\u20135  banks  for  an  aggregate  exposure  to  ADB  of  up  to  P1 \nbillion. PCG sublimits per PFI are set at the peso equivalent of up \nto P500 million. The SME borrower of each PFI will have a PCG \nlimit of up to the peso equivalent of P12.5 million which means the \nmaximum  exposure  per  borrower  will  be  up  to  the  aggregate \namount of P25 million.  \n \nThe  PCG  facility  will  be  available  for  5  years.  Since  each  loan \nguaranteed  under  the  facility  may  have  a  maximum  repayment \nterm of up to 3 years depending on its risk profile, the facility will \nhave a maximum tenor of up to 8 years.  \n \nOctober 2013 \n\nThe  ADB  PSOD,  in  close  collaboration  with  the  Office  of \nCofinancing  Operations,  will  structure,  process,  and  monitor  the \nPCG facility. \n \nADB will invest up to $1 million (not to exceed 25% of total project \ncost) in the CIB. The CIB is intended to function as the repository \nof  all  relevant  credit  information  including  tax  and  insurance \nhistory of corporate, individual, SME, and microfinance borrowers. \nIt may also produce credit reports containing detailed information \non  the  credit  history  of  the  individual  or  corporation,  and  credit \nratings. \n \nThe  CIB  is  proposed  to  be  established  under  the  Credit \nInformation  Systems  Act,  currently  being  discussed  by  Congress \nand  Senate.  The  Senate  Committee  on  Banks,  Financial \nInstitutions, and Currencies has reviewed and endorsed the draft \nbill. This legislation is expected to be passed in the second half of \n2005  and  once  approved,  the  CIB  is  expected  to  be  established \nwithin  eight  months.  The  CIB  will  be  established  as  a  separate \nentity  under  the  Corporation  Code.  Bangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas \n(BSP),  is  expected  to  own  up  to  49%  of  the  shares;  51%  will  be \nowned by private sector institutions, related industry associations, \nand strategic partners. \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n \n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\ntargeted  under \n\n \nThe  ADB  PSOD  will  coordinate,  process,  and  monitor  the  equity \ninvestment. \n \nThe SMEDSP, associated TA, and JFICT project are expected to \ncontribute  to  an  improved  enabling  environment  for  SMEs,  a \nstronger SB Corporation better equipped to expand its wholesale \nand retail portfolio, expanded SME lending by SB Corporation and \nPFIs,  and  job  creation  by  SMEs.  SMEs  are  expected  to  benefit \nfrom  the  better  business  environment,  improved  access  to,  and \navailability of, finance.  \n \nData  from  SB  Corporation\u2019s  previous  lending,  calculations  based \non  the  additionality  created  per  P1  million  of  lending  by  SB \nCorporation, suggest that at least 2,000 SMEs can be expected to \nborrow  through  the  SMEDSP.  This  could  translate  into  at  least \n5,500 additional jobs created directly. Given the diversity of SMEs \nand  the  fact  that  they  differ  in  terms  of  labor  intensity  in \nproduction,  more  specific  targets  cannot  be  detailed.  In  addition, \nindirect  job  creation  may  result  among  suppliers  and  buyers. \nThese  estimates  of  static  effects  indicate  a  small  fraction  of  the \njob  creation \nthe  10-point  agenda,  but \ncomplementary  government  and  development  agency  sponsored \nprograms  targeting  SMEs  and  microenterprises  are  expected  to \ncontribute  to  job  creation  as  well  as  efforts  to  bring  informal \nentrepreneurs and enterprises into the formal sector. \n \nOne  of  the  main  factors  affecting  SMEDSP  is  overall  the \nthe \nmacroeconomic  environment.  Current  projections \nPhilippines indicate an average 4.9% annual real gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  growth \ninflation  on  a \ndownward trend to about 4% and the budget deficit being reduced \nto about 1% of GDP by 2009. Adverse developments in the world \neconomy  could  dampen  growth  prospects  in  the  Philippines. \nConversely, stronger than projected growth in the world economy \ncould lead to higher growth.  \n \nThe main assumptions for the SMEDSP also carry some risks that \nare  addressed  by  mitigating  measures.  The  assumptions  are  (i) \nthe  Government  is  strongly  committed  and  has  the  capacity  to \nimplement  the  SMEDSP  as  an  integral  part  of  a  comprehensive \nsupport  program  for  SME  development;  (ii)  SB  Corporation  has \nsufficient  capacity  to  absorb  the  ADB  loan;  (iii)  SB  Corporation\u2019s \ncredit expansion has no potential adverse impact on private sector \nbanks;  and  (iv)  private  sector  banks  have  the  capacity  to \neffectively utilize the resources, including the PCG.  \n \n \nThe  Government  is  strongly  committed  to  supporting  SME \ndevelopment by implementing the SME Development Plan 2004\u2013\n2010, and President Arroyo\u2019s 10-point agenda as expanded in the \nMTPDP.  The  MTPDP  also  emphasizes  the  need  to  increase \n\nfor  2005\u20132009,  with \n\nfor \n\n\f \n\nvii\n\ninvestment and trade, and recognizes that the high cost of doing \nbusiness must be reduced, and infrastructure must be modernized \nif  growth  and  employment  targets  are  to  be  realized.  An  action \nprogram to prioritize and implement the SME Development Plan is \ndeveloped  to  ensure  appropriate  sequencing  of  activities  and \nsecuring  budgetary  allocations  and/or  development  funding  for \nactivities.  The  SME  Donor  Working  Group  is  an  active  forum  for \ncollaboration to ensure that efforts are complementary. \n \nSB Corporation is expected to be able to channel funds effectively \nthrough  accredited  PFIs  as  these  are  experienced  SME  lenders \nwith  a  broad  network  of  branches.  The  selection  criteria  used \nunder  the  accreditation  system  of  SB  Corporation  are  quite \nconservative  and  correspond  to  ADB  Guidelines  on  Financial \nIntermediary  Loans  for  selecting  PFIs.  SB  Corporation  has \ndeveloped  a  model  for  retail  lending,  and  has  a  proven  track \nrecord  of  SME  financing  operations  and  a  strong  pipeline  of \nprojects for both retail and wholesale funding. The associated TA \nwill  strengthen  SB  Corporation\u2019s  credit  underwriting  and  risk \nmanagement.  Upon  enactment  of  amendments  to  the  SME \nMagna  Carta,  Republic  Act  6977,  SB  Corporation  will  have  (i) \ndiscretion in its staffing and remuneration policies, (ii) a sovereign \nguarantee reinstated, and (iii) greater discretion over funding and \ninvestment decisions.  \n \nNo  adverse  effect  on  commercial  bank  lending  is  expected  to \nresult from SB Corporation\u2019s loan expansion as the target groups \nare  not  adequately  served  by  commercial  banks.  With  the \nestablishment  of  the  CIB,  the  commercial  banks  will  gain  access \nto comprehensive credit information on SME borrowers, enabling \nthem to make more informed credit decisions. \n \nTo ensure effective utilization of the PCG, allocation will be based \non  demand  projected  by  the  selected  banks.  ADB  will  bear  the \noperational risk of the PFIs in terms of their credit assessment and \ndue  diligence  in  identifying  credit-worthy  SMEs.  These  risks  are \nmitigated by the (i) negotiated first-loss provision, (ii) loss-sharing \nstructure of the SMEDSP where the PFI will cover a 50% share of \ncredit  loss,  (iii)  annual  review  of  the  PFI\u2019s  credit  program  where \nADB reserves the right to cancel the unused limit, and (iv) the PFI \naccounting  for  a  credit  risk  equivalent  to  the  full  extent  of  the \nunguaranteed  portion  (i.e.,  no  third  party  insurance,  guarantees, \nor government subsidy) to increase PFIs commitment to the credit \nprogram. \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan  to  the  Small  Business  Guarantee  and  Finance  Corporation  (SB  Corporation)  to  be \nguaranteed by the Republic of the Philippines; (ii) a proposed partial credit guarantee (PCG) to \nselected private sector financial institutions without a Government counterguarantee; and (iii) a \nproposed  equity  investment  in  the  planned  credit  information  bureau  (CIB)  for  the  Small  and \nMedium Enterprise Development Support Project (SMEDSP).  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \n2. \nThe  SMEDSP  was  developed  in  response  to  a  Government  request  for  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) assistance in implementing the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) \nDevelopment Plan 2004\u20132010. The Government views SME development as central to poverty \nreduction efforts through generation of employment opportunities and development of a sound \nand broad-based private sector. An ADB project preparatory technical assistance (TA) analyzed \nthe Government\u2019s SME development policies and actions to date, issues and constraints facing \nSMEs, and the operational and financial status of SB Corporation.1 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nIn 2002, SMEs in the Philippines contributed 32% of value added, and accounted for 8% \nof business establishments and 31% of employment. Shares of value added and sales by SMEs \nfollow  an  increasing  trend,  from  30%  and  31%  respectively  in  1998,  compared  with  21%  and \n22% in 1983, and 28% and 28% in 1993. The SMEs\u2019 direct contribution to total manufacturing \nexports was approximately 24%, but the indirect contribution as suppliers to large exporters is \nlikely to be higher. SME are thus a vital subsector in the economy.  \n \n4. \nSmall  enterprises  are  defined  as  those  with  asset  size  between  P3,000,000  and \nP15,000,000, while medium enterprises have assets between P15,000,000 and P100,000,000. \nBy  definition  based  on  number  of  employees,  a  small  enterprise  is  one  that  employs  10\u201399 \npeople,  while  a  medium  enterprise  employs  100\u2013199.2 In  2001,  the  total  825,000  registered \nbusiness  establishments  included  61,759  registered  small  and  2,923  medium  enterprises;  the \nvast  majority  were  microenterprises.  SMEs  are  found  in  practically  all  subsectors.  However, \nmost (more than 78%) are concentrated within a fairly traditional range of product groups: food \nprocessing; garments;  gifts,  toys,  and  handicrafts;  metal  working;  footwear  and  leather  goods; \nwood  and  bamboo  products;  and  building  materials.  In  terms  of  geographic  distribution,  the \nNational Capital Region accounts for 24.4% of all SME establishments and 40% of employees.  \n \nThe  importance  of  SMEs  to  the  Philippine  economy  is  reflected  in  the  SME  Magna \n5. \nCarta,  or  Republic  Act  6977  enacted  in  1991.3 The  act  summarizes  the  SME  policy  goals:  to \nraise  productivity,  ensure  access  to  modern  technology  and  financing,  and  lower  the  costs  of \ndoing business. The act also launched three major initiatives: (i) created the SME Development \nCouncil  as  the  primary  body  for  developing  the  SME  sector  through  policy  formulation, \ninterdepartmental  coordination,  and  promotion  of  SME  development  programs;  (ii)  specified \nmandatory credit allocations by all banks to SMEs: 6% of lending to small enterprises and 2% to \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

SB Corporation is under \nthe Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).  \n \n6. \n In July 2004, President Arroyo announced a 10-point agenda of reforms for her 6-year \nterm.  The  first  item  is  creation  of  at  least  6  million  jobs  in  6  years  through  support  for  SME \ndevelopment by tripling credit available to SMEs, developing land for agricultural business, and \nstimulating entrepreneurship. The Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) 2004\u2013\n2010  includes  targets  for  SME  lending  and  provides  strategies  for  government  financial \ninstitutions  (GFIs)  involved  in  lending  to  SMEs.  Executive  Order  391  directs  all  government \nagencies  to  implement  the  MTPDP  and  submit  quarterly  scorecards  to  monitor  progress.  The \nGovernment  also  presented  the  SME  Development  Plan  2004\u20132010,  a  comprehensive  sector \ndevelopment  plan  to  be  implemented  by  concerned  Government  agencies  in  partnership  with \nthe  private  sector  and  development  partners.  The  plan  identifies  eight  strategies,  each  with \nspecific activities. The SME plan is the result of numerous inputs from DTI, Small and Medium \nEnterprise  Development  Council,  and  industry  associations  in  the  Philippines,  as  well  as \ndevelopment  assistance-funded  studies  and  TA. 4  With  implementation  of  the  plan,  the \nGovernment projects SME gross value added will increase to 40% of the total, and SME exports \nwill grow at 16% annually based on the gross domestic product (GDP) growth targets for 2004\u2013\n2010 developed by the National Economic Development Authority.  \n \n7. \nThe SME Development Plan identifies activities to improve the enabling environment for \nSMEs, such as improving registration and licensing processes, providing business development \nservices  (BDS)  throughout  the  country,  assisting  SMEs  with  matching,  and  developing  market \naccess information and even product design. The plan does not address the overall policy and \nregulatory  framework  affecting  SMEs,  such  as  financial  sector  issues,  taxation,  competition \nframework,  corporate  recovery  and  insolvency  law,  labor  market  policies,  and  need  for  more \ninfrastructure  development.  Instead  the  plan  focuses  on  tangible  issues  that  will  have  a  direct \nimpact on SME operations. An action program for implementing the SME Development Plan in \na  sequenced  and  coordinated  manner  has  been  developed  and  was  presented  during  SME \nweek  in  July  2005.  Lead  agencies  and  key  people  responsible  for  each  activity  have  been \nidentified. The key people are tasked with bringing stakeholders together for each activity and \ndetermining  actions  needed,  sequencing \nfor \nimplementation. DTI has provided a general prioritization of activities based on sequencing and \nfund availability. The action program will have time-bound targets for the initiatives. Appendix 2 \nprovides a matrix of activities in the SME Development Plan, including designated lead agency \nby activity and how development partners\u2019 ongoing or planned activities match. The plan does \nnot capture all SME-related activities and projects supported by the development partners.  \n \nWhile the Philippines financial sector weathered the Asian financial crises comparatively \n8. \nwell, the adverse effects on SMEs have been significant in terms of availability of and access to \nfinance.  As  of  September  2004,  banks  had  an  estimated  P3,914  billion  of  assets.  Despite \nrelatively  high  levels  of  liquidity,  rising  levels  of  nonperforming  loans  and  the  deteriorating \nbusiness environment led to reduced lending by Philippine banks. Domestic credit to the private \nsector  as  percentage  of  GDP  decreased  from  62%  in  1997  to  34%  in  2003.  Of  total  bank \n\nthe  actions,  and  determining  resources \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB.1999  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  Strengthening  Export  Competitiveness. \nManila  (TA  3045-PHI)  and  ADB.  2003  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Project  to \nImprove  SME  Access  to  Finance.  Manila  (TA  4070-PHI)  are  among  the  references.  The  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency provided advisory TA to draft the SME Development Plan. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\nlending by June 2004, 12.1% was to SMEs, a decline from 13% in 2002.5 By June 2004, loans \nto  small  enterprises  accounted  for  6.5%  of  gross  loans  and  medium  enterprises  5.2%.  This  is \nlower  than  in  other  comparable  countries  in  the  region.  In  Indonesia  the  share  of  small \nenterprise  lending  was  18%  of  gross  loans  in  both  2002  and  2003,  and  given  that  Indonesia \ndefines  a  small  enterprise  as  one  with  5\u201320  employees,  the  difference  is  even  sharper.  The \n5.3% year-on-year decline in the commercial banks\u2019 aggregate loans and discounts from P983 \nbillion  in  2002  to  P931  billion  in  2003  also  indicates  that  banks  channel  funds  to  more  liquid \nassets  such  as  short-term  interbank  loans  and  trading  account  securities  (i.e.,  short-term \ninvestment in government and corporate debt instruments), where credit risk perception is lower, \ninstead  of  meeting  the  credit  demand  from  the  corporate  sector.  Alternative  formal  sources  of \nfunding  are  limited  for  SMEs.  The  equity  market  is  relatively  small  and  the  corporate  bond \nmarket is tiny;6 SMEs are not able to meet the requirements for tapping these markets. Venture \ncapital and lease financing are also limited. Small enterprises in particular tend to rely more on \ninformal  sources  of  finance,  which  can  be  more  costly  and  far  less  stable  than  a  bank  credit \nregarding interest and repayment terms.  \n \nIn  1999,  the  Government  responded  by  directing  two  GFIs,  SB  Corporation  and \n9. \nPhilEXIM  (Philippine  Export  Import  Credit  Agency),  to  start  direct  lending  to  SMEs  in  their \nrespective target areas. Until then, SB Corporation had offered guarantees and loans to SMEs \nvia accredited financial institutions. SB Corporation\u2019s current mandate is to support viable SMEs \nthat  cannot  access  bank  finance  because  they  cannot  meet  banks\u2019  stringent  requirement  for \ncollateral, for example. SB Corporation accepts a broader range of assets as collateral and at \nhigher  value  than  banks,  which  tend  to  only  accept  titled  prime  real  estate.  SB  Corporation  is \nalso willing to lend to SMEs that have been in operation for a shorter time than the 3 years of \nprofitable  operations  normally  required  by  banks.  As  the  SMEs  become  more  established  SB \nCorporation  plans  to  graduate  them  to  become  bank  clients.  Thus  SB  Corporation  has  a  very \ndistinct  mandate  and  target  group.  For  direct  lending,  SB  Corporation  developed  a  system  for \nevaluating applications at its five offices; applications that meet a set of criteria are sent to the \ncredit committee at the head office for decision. Using its own offices as well as DTI\u2019s regional \noffices and bureaus to disseminate information on both the wholesale lending, guarantees, and \nthe direct lending program, SB Corporation aims to reach SMEs nationwide.  \n \nPhilEXIM\u2019s main line of business was export credit guarantees and export finance. Direct \n10. \nSME lending has been limited due to lack of funds and a shortage of staff experienced in SME \nlending. In October 2004, PhilEXIM\u2019s board decided to move away from direct lending to SMEs \nand  instead  focus  on  guarantees  and  insurance  to  importing  and  exporting  enterprises  in  an \neffort to streamline operations and focus on core activities. \n \n11. \nOn  21  November  2002,  the  Monetary  Board  of  the  central  bank,  Bangko  Sentral  ng \nPilipinas  (BSP),  relaxed  prudential  regulations  in  order  to  broaden  SME  access  to  financing. \nThe  ruling  detailed  in  Circular  No.  364  of  9  January  2003  reduced  the  risk  weight  of  qualified \nSME and microfinance portfolios to 75% from 100%. Basel II7 due to come into effect in 2006, \nallows qualified retail portfolios to be risk-weighted at 75% as well.  \n \n\n                                                 \n5   The  upward  adjustment  of  the  asset  size  ceiling  of  medium  enterprises  in  2001  from  P60  million  to  P100  million \n\nmade it easier for commercial banks to directly comply with SME credit allocation.  \n\n6   Total  market  capitalization  of  the  Philippine  Stock  Exchange  was  62%  of  GDP  in  2003  and  corporate  bonds \n\n7  Basel  II  is  the  new  capital  adequacy  framework  for  banks  developed  by  the  Basel  Committee  on  Banking \n\noutstanding amounted to 1.26% of GDP. \n\nSupervision due to come into effect 2006.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nThe Policy and Enabling Environment \n\nA conducive policy environment is vital for SMEs to flourish, and contribute to economic \n12. \ngrowth  and  employment.  That  generally  means  clear,  predictable,  and  simple  rules  regarding \nlicensing, registration, taxation, and collateral registration so that SMEs can start operations and \naccess  finance.  While  the  SME  Magna  Carta  formed  the  framework  for  the  overall  policy \ndirection,  SMEs  still  face  a  policy  environment  that  is  not  adequately  supportive.  Major  policy \nissues to improve the investment climate, such as revisions to the incentive system, competition \npolicies  expanded  to  more  sectors,  and  changes  to  the  tax  system  are  examined  in  the  ADB \nreports  Improving  the  Investment  Climate  in  the  Philippines  and  the  draft  Private  Sector \nAssessment  for  the  Philippines.  The  ADB  Southeast  Asia  Regional  Department  is  analyzing \noptions  to  address  some  of  these  measures  under  a  broader  private  sector  development \ninitiative.  However,  significant  targeted  policy  measures  also  have  a  direct  effect  on  the  SME \nenabling environment.  \n \n13. \nA  number  of  surveys  have  revealed  that  SMEs  perceive  registration  and  licensing \nprocedures  to  be  cumbersome  and  costly  with  the  process  taking  an  average  of  59  days  and \nrequiring  11  procedures.  Furthermore,  they  cite  collateral  problems  as  hindering  access  to \nfinance.8 Growth  and  export-oriented  SMEs  identify  insufficient  market  knowledge  and  market \naccess  as  issues.  The  framework  for  registration  and  licensing  is  indeed  complicated.  Single \nproprietorships register with DTI, while partnerships and corporations register with the Securities \nand Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition, every enterprise needs to get a license from the \nlocal  government  unit  (LGU);  this  must  be  renewed  annually.  Registration  with  DTI  and  SEC \nserve  as  name  registration,  while  the  LGU  license  in  effect  allows  the  company  to  become \noperational  as  the  license  indicates  that  the  company  satisfies  all  national  and  LGU \nrequirements  to  operate  in  its  respective  field.  The  LGUs  thus  have  the  most  reliable  data  on \nactive  companies.  In  addition,  the  National  Internal  Revenue  Code  requires  all  business \nestablishments to register with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to comply with the firm\u2019s \nobligation  to  pay  national  income  taxes,  and  act  as  a  Government  withholding  tax  agent.  The \nSME  Development  Council  has  found  that  many  SMEs  register  with  DTI  solely  to  register  the \nbusiness name, long before they start operations, which some never do. The SME Development \nPlan (Activity 48) calls for streamlining and facilitating registration and licensing processes.  \n \n14. \nBecause  of  the  variety  of  registering  agencies  and  the  separate  licensing  process,  no \nsingle  comprehensive  national  business  registry  serves  as  (i)  name  registration  for  the \ncompany,  (ii)  BIR  registry,  (iii)  repository  of  LGU  licensed  enterprises,  (iv)  registry  where \nfinancial  institutions  can  verify  loan  applications  from  companies,  (v)  data  source  for  the \nNational  Statistics  Office,  and  (vi)  database  for  DTI  policymaking.  To  address  this,  the  SME \nDevelopment Plan recommends development of the Philippine business registry (PBR) as one \nactivity.  Now  designed,  the  registry  is  ready  to  be  established.  Implementation  will  be \nundertaken in phases, starting with the agencies involved, i.e., BIR, DTI, SEC, and major LGUs \nthat have electronic systems and can interface with the other agencies. Over time, the registry \nwill  be  linked  to  other  government  agencies  such  as  Department  of  Labor  and  Employment, \nNational  Statistics  Office,  and  Social  Security  System.  The  PBR  is  envisaged  to  provide \nelectronic  registration  and  submission  of  licensing  requests,  which  would  simplify  processes, \nlower  costs,  and  enhance  governance.  Thus  the  basic  requirements  for  SME  registration  and \n\n                                                 \n8   Project preparatory technical assistance survey. World Bank. 2004.

They \ndisseminate  information  on  government  programs  on  financing  and  market  linkages,  and \nprovide advisory services on facilitation, linking, and networking. About 60 full-time DTI business \ncounselors  provide  consulting  and  advisory  services  in  DTI  regional  offices  and  SME  centers. \nThe  Philippine  Trade  and  Training  Center  accredits  individuals  who  successfully  complete  its \nbusiness  management  systems  course  as  business  counselors.  The  Financial  Executives \nInstitute of the Philippines and the Management Association of the Philippines are expected to \ncomplement  the  pool  of  DTI  business  counselors  by  offering  volunteers  from  among  its \nmembers as business counselors to SMEs. The Japan International Cooperation Agency plans \nto  extend  assistance  to  strengthen  DTI  counselor  services.  Thus  significant  human  resources \nare  available  in  DTI  centers  to  assist  SMEs  with  a  range  of  issues.  Adding  services  for \nregistration  and  licensing  should  be  the  logical  extension  from  counseling.  In  the  longer  term, \nthe DTI SME centers could be one-stop shops for SME registration and licensing. For a fee, the \ncenters could process papers and ensure the company is duly registered in the national system. \n \n\n2. \n\nAccess to and Availability of Finance  \n\n \nIn  focus  group  discussions  for  the  recent  national  survey  on  SMEs  by  the  Employers \n16. \nConfederation of the Philippines and the International Labour Organization as well as a survey \nunder  the  project  preparatory  TA,  business  owners  and  BDS  providers  described  access  to \nfinancing  as  the  most  pressing  constraint  facing  SMEs.  Access  to  commercial  banks  is \nparticularly limited for small firms, which are able to source only 5\u20137% of their financing needs \nfrom  banks.  Most  SME  entrepreneurs  rely  on  family,  friends,  business  partners,  and  informal \nfinancing sources. In a survey of SMEs that have not accessed bank financing, inability to meet \ncollateral requirements was the top constraint. While 92% of the 62 banks surveyed under the \nproject  preparatory  TA  offered  short-term  working  capital  facilities  to  SMEs,  only  53%  offered \nfixed asset financing instruments. Access to trade and supplier financing is also limited.9 \n \n17. \nBanks  perceive  SMEs  as  riskier  than  larger  firms  due  to  their  low  capital  base,  limited \nproduct lines leading to greater vulnerability to business cycle fluctuations, and vulnerability to \ndeterioration  in  receivables  collections  or  loss  of  a  key  officer,  among  others.  SMEs  are  also \nperceived  to  have  weak  financial  discipline,  with  business  funds  often  mixed  with  the  owners\u2019 \npersonal  funds;  and  generally  to  have  weak  accounting  systems.  SMEs  rarely  use  banks  to \nmanage  their  payroll  or  for  working  accounts,  and  the  bank-client  relationship  tends  to  be \nweaker than for medium to large companies. For the banks, each SME transaction is therefore \ncostly,  as  it  generally  requires  more  staff  resources  in  relation  to  the  revenue  that  the  loan \ngenerates  compared  with  lending  to  larger  firms  with  which  the  bank  has  a  solid  bank-client \nrelationship.  One  remedy  has  been  for  banks  to  only  accept  titled  real  estate  as  collateral, \ngenerally value it at 60% of appraised value, and set the loan floor at P1 million ($17,860), thus \nconcentrating their SME lending to a certain market segment.  \n \nSeventy  percent  of  SME  lending  is  collateral  based,  but  many  SMEs  either  have \n18. \ninsufficient  collateral  or  cannot  have  it  properly  registered  because  of  the  lack  of  a  movable \ncollateral  registry.  Banks  must  undertake  their  own  assessments  of  the  ownership  of  the \nmovable  collateral,  which  makes  the  process  longer  and  more  costly.  The  lack  of  a  movable \n\n                                                 \n9   Forty-three  percent of respondent banks of ACER survey  offer receivable financing and 25% offer letter of credit \n\nfinancing. However, SME utilization of these facilities was low.    \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\ncollateral registry system hampers all lending and private sector development. The Government \nrecognizes that creation of a movable collateral registry is important for long-term SME growth.  \n \n19. \nThe  Philippines  does  not  have  a  comprehensive  credit  bureau  because  of  legal \nimpediments to reporting credit information. This has led to inaccurate credit assessments and \nhigher  risk  for  lenders.  Meanwhile,  borrowers  face  long  credit  application  processes,  higher \ninterest  rates,  and  credit  rationing.  The  proposed  Credit  Information  Systems  Act  (CISA), \ncurrently  being  discussed  in  Congress  and  Senate,  aims  to  address  the  lack  of  credit \ninformation. The CISA will have a central credit bureau at its core (due to be established by the \nend  of  2005)  and  will  govern  the  interplay  of  information  between  providers  and  subscribers. \nBSP  will  play  a  critical  role  as  the  largest  shareholder  and  supervisor.  BSP  involvement  will \nprovide the necessary credibility as well as ensure comprehensive collection of banking data.  \n \n20. \nSMEs  have  difficulty  preparing  audited  financial  statements,  and  business  plans  with \nsales  and  revenue  projections  that  meet  bank  requirements.  Because  of  difficulty  accessing \nformal finance, new SMEs tend to rely on their own or relatives\u2019 funds, and expensive informal \nfinance.  DTI  recognizes  this  and  offers  counseling  and  some  assistance  through  its  SME \ncenters; a number of development agencies are providing BDS to SMEs throughout the country. \nThe  BDS  include  preparation  of  business  plans,  financial  management,  marketing,  and \naccounting, which in turn will ensure that SMEs can present proper business plans to banks on \nwhich to base a cash-flow analysis that can substitute for or complement collateral for lending. \nIn addition to the SME centers, in 2002 DTI introduced SME caravans to extend the reach to the \nprovinces.  Each  caravan,  with  4\u20135  experts  in  areas  such  as  marketing,  trade,  finance,  and \ntechnology,  provides  advisory  services  and  conducts  business  clinics.  In  2002,  five  caravans \nvisited five provinces; in 2003, 36 caravans visited 29 provinces. In most cases, SMEs are not \ncharged  for  these  DTI  services.  Usually,  only  the  administrative  costs  incurred  for  organizing \nseminars/workshops  under  the  SME  caravans  are  borne  by  the  participants.  For  further \nconsultation,  however,  SMEs  pay  full  service  fees  to  BDS  providers.  According  to  a  2003 \nsurvey,  conducted  jointly  by  the  Employers  Confederation  of  the  Philippines  and  International \nLabour  Organization,  of  1,000  SMEs  nationwide,  80%  of  those  who  utilized  the  DTI  services \nfound them effective.  \n \nSB Corporation is mandated to be the national leader in small enterprise finance, not in \n21. \nvolume but in innovative products and outreach, thereby achieving a demonstration effect. SB \nCorporation  targets  underserved  SMEs  that  are  viable  but  cannot  access  bank  finance  and \ntypically  need  smaller  loans  than  most  banks  normally  offer.  Under  the  wholesale  lending \nprogram or rediscounting facility, SB Corporation accredits financial institutions nationwide and \nthen provides credit for SME lending through these accredited banks, thereby providing SMEs \nwider  access  to  short-  and  medium-term  financing.  The  SB  Corporation  funding  provides  the \naccredited banks with a wider array of SME loan products to offer their clients. A key advantage \nof SB Corporation products is that the pass-on rate from SB Corporation is fixed and the conduit \nbank  can  therefore  offer  fixed  terms  to  their  clients  as  opposed  to  revising  interest  rates  each \nmonth. Another advantage is the longer term products that SB Corporation offers with terms up \nto  7  years.  Since  1994,  SB  Corporation  disbursed  (as  of  December  2003)  P8.53  billion  ($152 \nmillion) benefiting 5,158 SMEs.  \n \n22. \nSB  Corporation  started  retail  lending  operations  in  1999  when  the  private  financial \ninstitutions slowed  their  lending  to  SMEs.  Direct  loans  disbursed  to  1,207  SMEs  from  1999  to \nDecember  2003  aggregated  P1.4  billion  ($25  million).  Retail  lending  is  coursed  through  SB \nCorporation\u2019s  five  offices,  where  account  officers  review  the  applications  and  make  an  initial \nassessment of whether the applicant meets the basic borrowing requirements, and if so and a \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\nsite visit is favorable, then the application is sent to the credit committee at head office in Manila \nfor approval. The SMEs targeted in the direct lending are those that are viable, but need small \nloans, have a short track record and insufficient collateral to meet banks\u2019 normal requirements. \nThe development aspect of SB Corporation is to support these viable SMEs with a view to move \nthem to bank financing after 3\u20135 years. SB Corporation also has a guarantee program offering \nparticipating  banks  guarantees  on  their  SME  loans,  thereby  allowing  expansion  of  SME \nportfolios. Total guarantees issued amount to P8.66 billion for 4,675 accounts. Even though SB \nCorporation  is  a  GFI  it  does  not  have  a  sovereign  guarantee,  and  this  in  combination  with  a \nprocessing cycle that is perceived by participating banks as long and cumbersome are cited as \nthe main reasons for banks limited interest in applying for SB Corporation\u2019s guarantee program. \nDetails about SB Corporation are in Appendix 3.  \n \nRecognizing  the  comparatively  low  levels  of  SME  lending  and  the  cumbersome \n23. \nprocedures surrounding it, the Government launched the SME Unified Lending Opportunities for \nNational  Growth  (SULONG)  program  in  2003.  The  aim  was  to  facilitate  SME  financing  by \nsimplifying  and  standardizing  GFI  lending  procedures,  including  those  of  SB  Corporation,  to \nmake loan processing swifter. SME centers and DTI provincial offices disseminate information \nto help SMEs tap the SULONG program. Small business counselors and technical staff facilitate \nSME access the SULONG program by helping them fill out loan application forms, generating \ndocuments  required,  and  following  up  on  the  status  of  loan  processing  with  SB  Corporation. \nInitially  interest  rates  were  fixed  for  different  types  of  maturity  loans  making  the  SULONG  a \nsuboptimal  lending  product  for  the  GFIs.  Therefore  the  SULONG  committee  requested  in \nSeptember  2004  that  the  cap  be  lifted  allowing  the  GFIs  to  differentiate  market-based  rates \naccording  to  the  client  and  type  of  loan.  In  October  2004  a  decision  was  made  to  move  to \nformula-based interest rates reflecting funding costs and credit risks.  \n \n24. \nDuring  preliminary  discussions  of  the  ADB  Private  Sector  Operations  Department \n(PSOD)  with  six  local  and  international  commercial  banks,  the  banks  expressed  interest  in \nexpanding their SME lending portfolios beyond the legally mandated 8%. The renewed interest \nof  domestic  banks  in  the  SME  market  results  from  increased  competition  and  tight  margins  in \nthe  large  borrower  segment,  as  well  as  BSP  regulatory  incentives  to  encourage  lending  to \nSMEs. However, domestic banks cite capital constraints and insufficient SME collateral as the \nmain constraints to profitable expansion of their SME portfolio. An increased level of lending to \nSMEs  would  require  increased  capital,  but  problems  with  nonperforming  assets  limit  their \noptions.  BSP  encourages  banks  to  remove  nonperforming  assets  to  free  up  resources  for \nlending and strengthen the banking system at large. Removing these assets, however, by sale \nto an asset management company is normally done at significantly discounted face value. This \nmeans  that  banks  have  to  realize  losses  that  in  turn  require  more  capital  to  meet  the  capital \nadequacy ratio requirement. Hence, banks that cannot raise sufficient capital may opt to reduce \nSME  lending  and  continue  to  invest  in  less  risky  assets,  and  only  slowly  deal  with  the \nnonperforming assets.  \n \n25. \nLocal and international commercial banks tend to rely on collateral for SME lending, and \ntypically only titled real estate. Some SMEs lack this, and even though their revenues may be \nsubstantial (such as medium-size call centers) they have difficulty accessing finance based on \ncash flow alone. International banks would also like to diversify their loan portfolios to improve \ntheir  risk  profile  and  broaden  their  sources  of  revenue.  They  are  therefore  interested  in \nexpanding to the SME market. Among the options they are considering is a channel financing \nstructure  that  puts  more  emphasis  on  cash  flow  than  collateral.  This  structure  identifies \nmultinational  company  clients  of  the  bank  and  the  dealers  with  payables  to  the  multinational \ncompany.  The  international  bank  will  lend  the  dealer  an  amount  equal  to  the  amount  in  the \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nmultinational company\u2019s invoice. The dealer then sells to the final consumer and upon payment \nrepays  the  international  bank.  This  type  of  structure  can  be  expanded  to  the  SME  market \nprovided the bank can share the risk.  \n \n \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n3. \n\n26.   ADB, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and World Bank have shifted their focus \nfrom  loans  to  the  industry  sector  in  general  to  SME  and  microenterprise  finance  and  support. \nADB,  International  Finance  Corporation,  and  Netherlands  Development  Corporation,  have \nequity  in  Planters  Development  Bank,  the  leading  thrift  bank  active  in  SME  lending.  Deutsche \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) has been providing TA for SMEs, primarily \nchanneled via DTI, specifically targeting the Visayas region and focusing on BDS and capacity \nbuilding. The Japan International Cooperation Agency provided assistance to DTI to formulate \nthe SME Development Plan 2004\u20132010 and sponsor a resident SME policy adviser to DTI. The \nCanadian  International  Development  Agency  has  been  providing  TA  for  private  enterprise \ndevelopment  since  the  early  1990s,  working  directly  with  industry  associations.  Kredistanstalt \nf\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW)  is  planning  to  provide  a  credit  line  to  SB  Corporation  in  2005, \nspecifically targeting the Visayas to complement GTZ efforts in that region. ADB is part of the \nSME  Donor  Working  Group,  which  meets  regularly  to  coordinate  ongoing  and  planned \nassistance, and ensure complementary assistance and collaboration. Major external assistance \nis described in more detail in Appendix 4. \n\n4. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nADB  draft  guidelines  for  SME  projects,  developed  in  2004,  draw  upon  previous \n\n \n27. \nexperience with SME projects. The main recommendations include the following: \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nADB  public  and  private  sector  operations  need  to  work  more  closely  to \ncomplement each other. \nPublic  sector  operations  should  primarily  focus  on  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment  including  regulatory,  business  registration,  governance,  stronger \nfinancial  sector,  and  building  of  appropriate  institutions  and  capacity  of  the \nfinancial sector. \nFuture SME operations should use a cluster approach or interlinked projects. A \nproject should not try to address all possible issues. Rather, it should be viewed \nas  a  building  block  to  develop  a  business  environment  conducive  for  SME \ndevelopment. \nSME  operations  must  be  closely  coordinated  with  other  external  aid  agencies \nand, where possible, activities linked with other aid agency support in the sector.  \n\n \nIn 1996, the World Bank undertook a detailed empirical analysis of its SME support over \n28. \n20  years  in  three  countries  (Ecuador,  Philippines,  and  Sri  Lanka).10 The  study  concluded  that \ncredit lines for term financing need to be designed carefully to achieve expected outcomes. Key \nlessons  include  the  need  to  ensure  realistic  expectations  and  projections  of  job  creation, \ndevelop SME credit underwriting skills, and focus on improving the policy environment to ensure \naccess to financing.  \n \n29. \nThe  SMEDSP  and  associated  projects  are  designed  to  take  lessons  learned  into \nconsideration given that they are joint public-private sector operations. The SMEDSP includes a \n\n                                                 \n10  World Bank. 1998. Support for Smaller Enterprises. Precis No. 173.

The Project involves close coordination with other development partners active \nin the SME sector whose activities are complementary.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAsian Development Bank Country and Sector Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  update  2004\u20132006  for  the  Philippines11 is \n30. \naligned  with  the  Government\u2019s  MTPDP  2001\u20132004;  the  focus  is  poverty  reduction.  SME \ndevelopment  is  identified  as  promoting  sustainable  growth  and  generating  employment,  while \npromoting private sector development. The CSP update stresses public-private partnerships for \nsustainable SME development. The CSP 2005\u2013200712 closely reflects the priorities in the new \nMTPDP  2004\u20132010,  which  takes  the  10\u2013point  agenda  as  a  starting  point  and  emphasizes \nsupporting  entrepreneurs  and  SMEs  in  the  effort  to  create  new  jobs  and  to  promote  broad-\nbased  growth.  The  CSP  also  stresses  the  need  to  consider  the  fiscal  situation  and  carefully \ntarget  and  structure  investment  loans  via  GFIs  to  have  minimum  budgetary  impact,  while \nensuring that the financial position and performance of the GFI is strengthened during a project.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n31. \nThe  overall  goal  of  the  SMEDSP  and  associated  projects  is  to  help  the  Government \nimplement  its  SME  Development  Plan  2004\u20132010  in  cooperation  with  other  development \npartners, and by supporting SME development to contribute to broad-based economic growth to \ngenerate employment opportunities. In President Arroyo\u2019s 10-point agenda and the MTPDP, the \nconcrete  target  is  to  create  at  least  6  million  jobs  in  6  years  through,  among  other  things, \npromoting SMEs by tripling financing available, supporting entrepreneurs, and developing land \nfor  agricultural  business.  The  SMEDSP  and  associated  projects  supports  this  objective  by \nimproving  the  enabling  environment  for  SMEs;  stimulating  SME  development  by  facilitating \naccess to finance and augmenting financial resources at SB Corporation; and expanding private \nsector lending for medium enterprises supported by a PCG. This combination of a public sector \nloan and private sector PCG allows for targeting of different segments of the SME market and \ncatalyzing  expanded  SME  finance  through  a  demonstration  effect.  The  associated  TA 13 will \nenhance  SB  Corporation\u2019s  capacity  and  performance  in  supporting  SME  development.  The \nSMEDSP  will  effectively  complement  efforts  by  other  development  partners  that  mostly \nconcentrate on providing BDS to SMEs nationwide, as well as efforts to support policymaking by \nDTI. \n \nB. \n  \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nCredit Line to SB Corporation for Onlending to SMEs \n\n32. \nPrivate sector financial institutions will be responsible for the bulk of the credit expansion \nenvisioned  in  President  Arroyo\u2019s  10-point  agenda.  GFIs,  specifically  SB  Corporation,  should \nplay  a  catalytic  role  in  making  this  happen.  SB  Corporation  will  continue  to  extend  loans  to \nSMEs  underserved  by  banks  because  of  insufficient  collateral  or  credit  history,  but  that  are \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2004 Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006): Philippines.

As they acquire sound credit \nrecords  through  the  retail  or  wholesale  program,  these  SMEs  will  be  able  to  access  bank \nservices\u2014the  target  for  this  is  3\u20135  years.  SB  Corporation\u2019s  lending  is  expected  to  provide  a \ndemonstration effect and thereby be catalytic. The lending targets for SB Corporation and other \nGFIs  active  in  supporting  micro  and  SMEs  are  detailed  in  the  MTPDP  and  monitored  by \nquarterly scorecards. Concurrently, amendments to the SME Magna Carta have been submitted \nto  Congress  for  passage.14 The  proposed  amendments  will,  among  other  things,  (i)  allow  SB \nCorporation  discretion  in  staffing  and  remuneration  policies,  (ii)  reinstate  the  sovereign \nguarantee, and (iii) provide greater discretion in funding and investment.  \n \n33.  With the appreciation that viable SMEs are experiencing an immediate funding gap, the \nSMEDSP  will  provide  a  credit  line  of  $25  million  equivalent  in  two  phases  to  augment  SB \nCorporation\u2019s  funds  for  onlending  to  SMEs  either  indirectly  (i.e.,  through  its  wholesale \noperations) or directly (i.e., through its retail operations): $20 million equivalent is expected to be \nmade available for SB Corporation\u2019s wholesale operation and $5 million equivalent for its retail \noperation.  In  both  cases,  the  aim  is  to  support  SB  Corporation\u2019s  strategy  of  targeting  viable \nSMEs  that  satisfy  SB  Corporation\u2019s  lending  criteria,  which  are  more  lenient  than  those  of \ncommercial  banks.  Smaller  and  export-oriented  SMEs  with  good  business  prospects  will  be \ntargeted. While the Project has no geographic limitations, lending to SMEs in Mindanao will be \nencouraged.  In  parallel,  KfW  will  extend  a  loan  to  SB  Corporation  in  coordination  with  the \nSMEDSP  for  onlending  to  micro  and  small  enterprises  in  the  Visayas  region  through  selected \nbanks accredited with SB Corporation.  \n \n34. \nUpon loan effectiveness, $10 million equivalent of SMEDSP loan will be made available \nfor drawdown, to be used to augment SB Corporation\u2019s wholesale lending. The second amount \nof $15 million equivalent will be made available for drawdown following a comprehensive review \nto be undertaken about 18 months after the first withdrawal, and subject to (ii) 70% drawdown of \nthe first $10 million equivalent and outstanding in SME loans, and (iii)  the credit scoring model \nand  new  credit  underwriting  and  risk  management  reporting  formats  developed  under  the \nassociated TA being introduced (footnote13).  \n \n\n2. \n\nPartial  Credit  Guarantee  to  Selected  Commercial  Banks  to  Expand  SME \nPortfolios \n\n \n35. \nTo  encourage  lending  to  medium-size  enterprises  falling  outside  of  the  scope  of  SB \nCorporation, a PCG facility of P1 billion (currently equivalent to $18.40 million) will be offered to \nselected participating financial institutions (PFIs) without a Government counter guarantee. The \nPCG facility will guarantee up to 50% of well-defined SME loan portfolios. The tentative size of \nthe PCG facility is P1 billion, which translates to an aggregate guaranteed portfolio size of P2 \nbillion. The PCG facility is expected to be extended to 2\u20135 banks with a sublimit of up to P500 \nmillion per bank.  \n \n36. \nThe SME borrower of each PFI will have a PCG limit of up to P12.5 million, which means \nthat the maximum exposure per borrower will be up to an aggregate amount of P25 million. To \nfurther  mitigate  risk,  ADB  will  negotiate  a  risk-sharing  structure  with  the  PFIs,  which  will  take \nplace on two levels. First, a first loss limit over the entire guaranteed portfolio will be defined that \nwill be fully absorbed by the PFI. The first loss will be based on the historic loss experience of \nthe  PFI.  Second,  any  loss  in  excess  of  the  first  loss  will  be  shared  with  the  PFI  at  an  agreed \nrate,  up  to  50%.  PSOD  will  coordinate,  process,  and  monitor  the  PCG  facility.  Details  of  the \n\n                                                 \n14  Passage of the draft amendments to the SME Magna Carta is expected by the end of 2005.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\nPCG facility for private sector PFIs are in Appendix 6. The summary of the Indicative Terms and \nConditions of the Guarantee Agreement can be found in Appendix 7. \n \n37. \nThe  PFI  selection  process  for  the  PCG  will  be  linked  to  the  regional  Trade  Finance \nFacilitation  Program  approved  by  ADB  in  late  2003  and  currently  under  implementation  in  the \nPhilippines  as  well  as  in  other  developing  member  countries.  The  initial  due  diligence  by  the \nprogram team will be utilized with additional evaluation on the underwriting process specifically \nof SME borrowers. Hence, primarily those Philippine banks that are accredited institutions in the \nTrade Finance Facilitation Program15 will be initially targeted under the facility to gain first-hand \nexperience  in  its  dealings  with  these  domestic  banks.  The  PFI  list  can  also  be  extended  to \nADB\u2019s investee bank, Planters Development Bank, where ADB has prior credit experience and \ndealings. International banks, with a strong position in the SME sector in other countries and/or \nthe willingness to enter the SME market in the Philippines, will also be considered.  \n \n38. \nSubsequent to Board approval, PSOD will undertake the final identification of the PFIs. \nPSOD  will  work  closely  with  Office  of  Cofinancing  Operations  (OCO)  and  the  Southeast  Asia \nDepartment (SERD) to determine terms and conditions for the PCG facility. The final structure \nof the facility will be finalized through a PCG agreement between each PFI and ADB subject to \napproval from the Director General of PSOD and ADB\u2019s Guarantee Committee. The agreement \nwill  include  ADB\u2019s  recommended  underwriting  criteria  for  the  selection  of  SMEs.  This  will  look \ninto the creditworthiness of the individual SME, including its financial performance and business \nplan.  The  shareholder  structure  and  SME  management  will  be  evaluated,  specifically  with \nrespect  to  reputation  and  financial  resources.  A  sample  list  of  SME  underwriting  criteria  is  in \nAppendix  8.  The  terms  and  condition  of  the  PCG  facility  agreement  may  be  different  for  each \nPFI  depending  on  the  participating  bank\u2019s  SME  underwriting  capability,  SME  experience,  and \nnature  of  the  existing  SME  portfolio.  To  gain  experience  in  SME  portfolio  evaluation  and \nmonitoring, ADB intends to initially launch the PCG facility with 2\u20133 local and international banks \nexperienced  in  SME  lending.  In  the  case  of  international  banks,  their  experience  with  SME \nlending in other countries will most likely be replicated in the Philippines.  \n \n39. \nThe PFIs will use the PCG facility to improve their capital efficiency ratio and to diversify \ntheir  loan  portfolio  thus  increasing  their  willingness  and  capacity  to  lend  to  the  SME  sector. \nADB\u2019s  guarantee  on  the  loan  attracts  a  0%  risk  weighting  and  therefore  allows  the  PFI  to \nincrease  its  lending  capacity  without  necessitating  an  increase  in  capital,  nor  exceeding  its \nexposure limits or breaching prudent underwriting criteria.  \n \nThe PCG is not intended to crowd out the guarantee operation of SB Corporation. While \n40. \nthe ADB guarantee targets medium-size companies, SB Corporation\u2019s guarantee is for smaller \ncompanies and PhilEXIM\u2019s guarantee program is only available to importers and exporters. The \nPCG facility aims to meet the needs of the underserved middle market, which are beyond the \nscope of operations of SB Corporation and PhilEXIM. These borrowers can be underserved, for \ninstance,  due  to  their  need  for  a  higher  loanable  amount  or  larger  number  of  employees  (i.e., \nmore than 200 but still not acceptable to banks). The definition of medium-size enterprise may \nbe different for each PFI, particularly for international banks, although measures will be taken to \nensure that the benefit of the guarantee falls to a new market previously underserved by the PFI. \nADB\u2019s  PCG  facility  provides  an  alternative  guarantee  facility  for  private  sector  banks  facing \n\n                                                 \n15   Allied  Bank,  Asia  Trust  Bank,  Banco  de  Oro,  Bank  of  the  Philippine  Islands,  China  Bank,  Equitable-PCI  Bank, \nLand  Bank,  Metro  Bank,  Philippine  Bank  of  communications,  Prudential  Bank,  Rizal  Commercial    Banking \nCorporation, Security Bank, and Union Bank.  \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\nconstraints  in  the  structure  or  requirements  of  SB  Corporation,  such  as  (i)  the  nonsovereign \nstatus of SB Corporation\u2019s guarantee, and (ii) long application processing time.  \n \n41.  Measurement of the number of additional SME  loans provided by the PFIs because of \nthe PCG facility will be based on each PFI and SME. As part of the PCG agreement, ADB will \nrequire  regular  reports  indicating  the  borrowers  included  in  the  guaranteed  loan  portfolio, \nincrease  in  the  PFI\u2019s  credit  facilities,  and  disbursement  for  each  SME  borrower  resulting  from \nestablishment of the PCG facility. Upon initiation and annually thereafter, ADB can ask the PFI \nto submit a copy of the credit review of each SME borrower included in the guaranteed portfolio. \nAs  well  as  providing  ADB  with  information  on  the  available  credit  facilities  and  the  amount \nactually borrowed from all the banks, this will indicate the increased assistance provided to each \nSME due to the establishment of the PCG facility. \n \n\n3. \n\nEquity Investment in the Credit Information Bureau \n\n \n42. \nThe proposed equity investment in the CIB is up to $1 million, not to exceed 25% of the \ntotal  project  cost  initially  estimated  at  $4  million.  The  CIB  will  be  established  as  a  corporate \nentity under the Corporation Code with BSP owning up to 49% in the company. Besides ADB, \nprivate  sector  institutions,  related  industry  associations,  and  strategic  partners  are  invited  to \nhave an equity stake.  \n \n43. \nThe  main  CIB  product  will  be  consolidated  credit  information.  The  CIB  will  collect \nrelevant credit-related information in connection with a borrowers\u2019 application for and availment \nof a credit facility from banks, their affiliates and subsidiaries, and other credit providers. Access \nto the CIB will be provided to the submitting entities as well as special accessing entities, which \nmay be other private credit bureaus and private credit-rating agencies. Confidential information \nunder the Bank Secrecy Law, Foreign Currency Deposit Act, and General Banking Law will not \nbe included.  \n \n44. \nEstablishment of the CIB will be supported by the proposed CISA (para. 19). The CISA \nstipulates  that  any  company  established  under  the  act  will  be  authorized  to  collect \ncomprehensive  credit  information  on  any  type  of  borrower  and  to  release  credit  information, \ncredit  reports,  and  credit  ratings  to  accessing  entities,  such  as  domestic  banks,  other  credit \nproviders, and any other lender in the country. Each borrower will have access to his/her credit \ninformation and will have the right to dispute any inaccuracy. \n \nThe CIB is intended to improve sharing and dissemination of information through a credit \n45. \ninformation system that will result in the following: (i) ability of lenders to more accurately identify \ngood  borrowers;  (ii)  creation  of  a  better  risk  management  process;  (iii)  increase  in  volume  of \nlending;  (iv)  extension  of  credit  to  underserved  sectors  such  as  micro,  small,  and  medium \nenterprises;  and  (v)  strengthening  of  credit  discipline  leading  to  the  overall  lowering  of  default \nrates. Details of the proposed equity investment are in Appendix 9. \n \nC. \n \n46.  \nFirst,  the  SMEDSP  is  a  combination  of  public  and  private  sector  modalities  to  ensure \nthat  different  segments  of  SMEs  are  reached.  The  smaller  and  newer  SMEs  will  be  targeted \nthrough the credit line to SB Corporation. Larger SMEs that have limited access to bank finance \nwill be targeted under the PCG. The two financing facilities effectively complement each other.  \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n47.   Second,  the  credit  line  will  be  released  in  phases  with  a  holistic  approach  to  SB \nCorporation\u2019s  operations  aimed  at  improving  financial  performance  and  expanding  lending  in \nsupport of the SME Development Plan. Therefore, during the first phase the wholesale lending \nprogram  will  be  supported,  and  during  the  second  phase,  retail  lending  will  be  supported  as \nwell. The retail lending will make use of the results of the associated TA (footnote 13) aiming at \nintroducing  enhanced  credit  evaluation,  underwriting,  and  risk  management  practices.  Thus \nsuccess  in  the  first  phase  of  the  SMEDSP  will  pave  the  way  for  the  second  phase.  SB \nCorporation aims to graduate borrowers to become clients of private sector financial institutions. \nIn  this  context,  SB  Corporation\u2019s  relatively  small  size  is  appropriate  as  it  plays  a  limited, \ncomplementary role to the private sector by focusing on an underserved and important group of \nSMEs.  Because  of  this,  the  ADB  credit  line  is  expected  to  (i)  demonstrate  that  SME  lending \nbased  on  alternative  collateral  and  cash  flows  is  profitable,  (ii)  contribute  to  sustainable  SME \nfinancing in the targeted market, and (iii) expand the future client base of private sector banks \nby identifying and nurturing viable SMEs. \n \n48. \nThird,  the  SMEDSP  was  processed  in  conjunction  with  TA  and  a  Japan  Fund  for \nInformation  and  Communication  Technology  (JFICT)  project  to  best  utilize  different  ADB \nmodalities to support SME development.16 Assistance funded by the JFICT is central to support \nactivities  to  improve  the  enabling  environment  for  SMEs  by  implementing  two  key  activities  in \nthe SME Development Plan: implementing the PBR design and streamlining the registration and \nlicensing  processes.  The  first  activity  is  a  complex  undertaking  to  create  a  database  and \nelectronic  interfaces  between  the  government  agencies  concerned.  Initially,  the  JFICT  project \nwill streamline and link BIR, DTI, SEC, and LGUs that have electronic systems. Subsequently, \nother government agencies will be interfaced with the registry, such as the Department of Labor \nand Employment, National Statistics Office, and Social Security System. Initially to be operated \nby  DTI,  The  PBR  may  subsequently  become  a  separate  entity.  The  registry  will  also  be  the \nvenue for electronic registration and over time for LGU licensing applications, thereby reducing \nthe  cost  and  time  required  for  registration  and  licensing,  enhancing  transparency  and \ngovernance of the process. A general set of basic requirements needed for registration and for \nlicensing, which should be applicable nationwide, has to be developed and forms standardized. \nWhile this may be perceived as intruding on the Local Government Code by limiting freedom to \nset  licensing  requirements,  the  aim  to  at  least  ensure  that  SMEs  across  the  nation  have  the \nsame  basic  requirements  to  operate  in  their  respective  fields.  PBR  implementation  will  take  1 \nyear, and is expected to start as soon as budget funds are released. The target for PBR to be \noperational is mid-2006. A summary of the JFICT supported project is in Appendix 10. \n \nFourth,  the  associated  TA,  Strengthening  SME  Credit  Management  Systems,  has  two \n48. \nobjectives: (i) to strengthen SB Corporation\u2019s credit underwriting and risk management, and (ii) \nto  work  with  DTI  to  develop  a  blueprint  for  a  movables  collateral  registry.  Such  a  registry  will \nfacilitate  secured  transactions  based  on  movable  collateral  and  expand  the  options  for  SME \nfinance. The blueprint encompasses a review of existing laws and recommendations related to \npotential amendments and/or new legislation that might be required to expand the framework for \nsecured  transactions  to  encompass  movable  property.  In  addition,  a  strategy  is  needed  to  set \nup the collateral registry. This involves identifying and working with key stakeholders, from the \npublic and private sectors, who will oversee the creation of the registry, maintain it, and use it. \nThe  output  will  be  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  creating  the  movable  collateral  registry.  A \nsummary and framework for the associated TA is in Appendix 5.  \n \n\n                                                 \n16 The JFCIT Project Developing the Philippine Business Registry was approved by the Government of Japan on 28 \n\nMay, 2005 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nD. \n\nProposed Project Loan \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n1. \n \nSB  Corporation  has  requested  a  loan  of  \u00a52,746,625,000  ($25  million  equivalent)  from \n49. \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  loan  with  Government \nguarantee  will  have  a  15-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility, and a commitment fee of 0.75 per annum and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin  the  draft  loan  agreement.17 SB  Corporation  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its \ndecision  to borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n50. \nTo  avoid  foreign  exchange  risk  and  to  comply  with  its  management  policy,  SB \nCorporation  will  sign  a  separate  agreement  with  the  Philippine  Government  to  exchange  the \ndollar- or yen-denominated loan into a peso-denominated liability. The Government will charge \nup  to  5%  per  annum  for  the  guarantee  including  the  foreign  exchange  risk  cover  for  a  dollar \nloan. The charge for a yen loan may be different. However, the rate for the guarantee including \nforeign exchange risk cover is still subject to review by the Department of Finance. The rules to \nimplement the foreign exchange risk cover and guarantee premiums payment structure will be \nissued when completed. \n \n51. \nreach 65%. \n \n\nADB\u2019s  proportion  of  SB  Corporation  funding  for  relending  and  onlending  will  at  most \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\na. \n\nSB Corporation Relending to PFIs and Onlending to SMEs  \n\n \n52. \nA  total  of  $20  million  equivalent  of  the  ADB  loan  will  be  lent  through  SB  Corporation\u2019s \naccredited  PFIs  for  onlending  to  eligible  SMEs.  SB  Corporation\u2019s  wholesale  lending  products \nrange from P100,000 ($1,790) to P15 million ($267,900) and with maturities from 1\u20135 years. In \nthe wholesale lending program, the relending rates that SB Corporation charges PFIs is, as of 1 \nJune 2005: 7.2% up to 90 days, 7.5% 91\u2013181 days, 7.8% 182\u2013270 days, 8.2% 271\u2013360 days, \n9.2% 1\u20133 years, 9.7% 3\u20135 years, and 10.2 5\u20137 years. The PFIs add charges ranging from 4% \nto  8%  to  cover  their  costs  and  reflect  the  perceived  risk.  From  the  ADB  loan,  $5  million \nequivalent  will  be  allocated  to  SB  Corporation\u2019s  retail  lending.  The  retail  loans  range  from \nP200,000 ($3,670) to P5,000,000 ($89,200) with maturities up to 5 years. The interest rates as \nof 1 June 2005 are 9.5% for fully secured loans up to 1 year, 13.8% for 1\u20133 years, and 14.5% \nfor  3\u20135  years.  An  additional  charge  of  1%  per  annum  is  made  for  loans  partially  secured  (at \nleast  50%  secured),  and  2%  for  less  than  50%  secured.  SB  Corporation  will  create  revolving \nfunds from repaid subloans to make new loans under the same criteria. Monthly charges to PFIs \nare computed based on 80% of MART 1 (benchmark rate of the Money Market Association of \nthe Philippines) plus 0.1% plus gross receipts tax (GRT),  while interest rates on retail loans are \ncomputed based on Sulong rates determined by the GFIs. \n \n\n                                                 \n17  If  the  loan  is  not  approved  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  by  30  June  2006,  a  front  end  fee  of  1%,  or  such  other \n\namounts to be determined by the Board, will be applied.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n \n\nSB  Corporation  has  accredited  PFIs,  using  criteria  that  include  (i)  good  standing  with \n53. \nBSP; (ii) positive net income and net worth for the past 3 years; (iii) nonperforming loan ratio of \nnot  more  that  20%;  (iv)  qualified  staff  and/or  loan  desk  for  SME  loans;  (v)  capital  adequacy, \nasset quality, management quality, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk (CAMELS) \nrating  of  at  least  3  based  on  the  BSP  scoring  system;  and  (vi)  satisfactory  track  record  under \nother  wholesale  loan  facilities.  The  accreditation  requirements  basically  correspond  to  ADB \nGuidelines on Financial Intermediary Loans18 for selecting PFIs. \n \n \n \n54. \nSB  Corporation\u2019s  criteria  for  eligibility  will  apply  as  well  as  ADB  safeguard  policies.  All \nSMEs  are  eligible  under  wholesale  and  retail  lending  except  those  engaged  in  farm  level \nagriculture or aquaculture production, trading of imported goods, trading of liquor and cigarettes \nor illegal substances, and housing projects. SB Corporation also requires SMEs to comply with \nthe  environmental  laws  of  the  Philippines  and  keep  sound  financial  accounts.  All  Philippine \nmanufacturing  enterprises  must  obtain  an  environmental  compliance  certificate  from  the \nDepartment of Environment and National Resources, which is to be renewed annually.  \n \n\nSME Eligibility \n\nb. \n\nc. \n\nProject Management \n\nSB Corporation, the Executing Agency will implement the SMEDSP and is implementing \n55. \nthe associated TA (Appendix 5). DTI will implement the component on developing a movables \ncollateral registry. In addition, ADB will coordinate with other development projects supported by \nmembers of the SME Donor Working Group, in particular with KfW to ensure complementarity \nbetween the ADB credit line and associated TA to SB Corporation and KfW\u2019s planned credit line \nand TA to SB Corporation.  \n \n\nd. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n56. \nThe  SMEDSP  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  from  loan  effectiveness.  The  closing \ndate for submission of drawdown applications, and approval and authorization for disbursement \nfrom  the  loan,  will  be  within  5  years  of  the  date  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  closing  date  for \ndisbursements  will  be  6  months  after  the  closing  date  of  the  submission  of  withdrawal \napplication, approval, and authorization. \n \n\ne. \n\nProcurement \n\n57. \nSubborrowers will be encouraged to follow ADB guidelines for procurement applicable to \ndevelopment  finance  institutions  with  SB  Corporation  assistance  when  applicable.  These \nguidelines  require  subborrowers  to  (i)  demonstrate  that  procurement  procedures  adopted  are \nappropriate in the circumstances; (ii) ensure that goods and services to be financed by subloans \nare purchased with consideration to economy and efficiency at a reasonable price, given time of \ndelivery,  quality,  and  efficiency;  and  (iii)  ensure  that  all  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  by \nsubloans  are  procured  from  ADB  member  countries.  Subborrowers  will  be  encouraged  to \nprocure  goods  through  international  competitive  bidding  and/or  international  shopping  when \nsuch procedures are applicable in the interest of economy and efficiency.  \n \n\n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2003.

To  expedite  project  implementation  through  timely  release  of \nADB  funds  for  eligible  expenditures,  SB  Corporation  will  establish  a  yen  imprest  account \nexclusively for the Project at Landbank of the Philippines. The limit of the imprest account will be \nthe  estimated  subproject  expenditure  for  6  months  or  20%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is \nlower.  The  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  will  be  used  to  liquidate  and  replenish  the \nimprest  account.  SB  Corporation  will  maintain  disbursement  documentation  in  support  of \nexpenditures and make them available to ADB for examination.  \n \n\ng. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n\nSB Corporation will maintain a separate set of project accounts acceptable to ADB . The \n59. \nCommission  on  Audit  will  audit  these  accounts,  and  SB  Corporation  will  provide  ADB  with \ncopies  of  the  accounts  and  audit  reports  within  6  months  of  the  completion  of  each  financial \nyear.19 A separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure \nprocedures  should  be  included  in  the  audit  report.  Delay  in  submission  of  audited  financial \nstatements with acceptable quality may result in ADB suspending loan disbursements.  \n \nSB  Corporation  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  a  quarterly  report  on  the  operational  and \n60. \nfinancial performance of SB Corporation and SMEDSP implementation within 2 months after the \nend of each quarter; (ii) a projected annual disbursement schedule, broken down by quarters by \n15  December  each  year;  (iii)  updated  5-year  financial  projections  of  SB  Corporation  by  31 \nMarch  each  year;  and  (iv)  a  project  completion  report  within  3  months  of  project  completion  \ndetailing  project  implementation,  project  costs,  loan  recoveries,  financial  conditions  of  SB \nCorporation, and other details that ADB may consider necessary. \n \n\nh. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nSB  Corporation  and  ADB  will  carry  out  project  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The \n\n61. \ndesign and monitoring framework will be used to monitor overall progress and benefits.  \n \n\ni. \n\nSafeguard Measures \n\n62. \nThe credit line is classified as \u201cfinancial intermediary\u201d for the purpose of compliance with \nADB safeguard policies. The SMEDSP is expected to have minimal environmental impact. The \neligibility  criteria  for  SME  borrowers  are  listed  in  para.  54.  SB  Corporation  undertakes \nenvironmental due diligence, following the manual developed by the Development Bank of the \nPhilippines, with guidelines for loan applications, site visits, audits, and performance monitoring. \nStaff  also  follow  the  Handbook  of  Environmental  Standards.  Compliance  is  assured  by  the \ncompliance  officer,  who  is  a  member  of  the  Management  and  Credit  Committee.  SB \nCorporations\u2019  environmental  policies  are  referred  to  in  Appendix  3.  The  ADB  Regional \nEnvironment  and  Social  Safeguard  Division  classified  the  SMEDSP  as  category  C  for  both \n\n                                                 \n19  ADB  has  no  objections  to  the  Commission  on  Audit  undertaking  the  audit  as  ADB  has  found  the  audit  process \nsatisfactory. On 27 January  2005, the Monetary  Board of BSP approved the exemption of government-owned or \ncontrolled banks from the requirement of an annual financial audit by an external auditor on the grounds that the \nbanks\u2019 full public accountability and compliance with banking laws and regulations can be reasonably assured with \nthe  concurrent  audit  and  examination  being  conducted  by  the  Commission  on  Audit  and  BSP,  which  are  both \n0presently applying the risk-based approach to audit and examination.    \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  impact  on  indigenous  people.20 Since  the  loans  to  SMEs  will  be \nmainly  for  light  manufacturing,  trade,  and  service  sectors,  adverse  impacts  on  indigenous \npeople and involuntary resettlement are highly unlikely.  \n \n\nj. \n\nProject Review \n\nProposed Partial Credit Guarantee  \n\nADB,  with  SB  Corporation  assistance,  will  carry  out  a  comprehensive  review  of  the \n63. \nSMEDSP about 18 months after loan effectiveness. The review will assess progress of lending \nunder the first phase of the loan, evaluate progress in improving the enabling environment and \nin strengthening of SB Corporation\u2019s credit evaluation and risk management practices through \nassessing implementation of the deliverables from the associated TA and utilization of the PCG. \nADB  will  conduct  annual  project  reviews  during  project  implementation.  The  results  of  review \nmissions  will  be  shared  with  BSP,  Department  of  Finance,  DTI,  and  National  Economic \nDevelopment Authority.  \n \nE. \n \n64. \nThe  PCG  facility  will  have  an  overall  limit  of  up  to  P1  billion  (currently  equivalent  to \n$18.40 million); the PFIs will cover the remaining risk of up to P1 billion. Sublimits per PFI are \nset  at  up  to  the  peso  equivalent  of  up  to  P500  million.  In  addition  to  the  50/50  risk-sharing \nscheme  between  ADB  and  the  PFI,  ADB  will  negotiate  a  first  loss  provision  to  be  entirely \nassumed  by  the  PFI.  The  first  loss  will  be  a  reflection  of  the  loss  experience  of  each  PFI. \nAppendix 6 provides details on the PCG.  \n \nADB will enter into PCG agreements with each PFI, to define the portfolio to be covered \n65. \nincluding  the  PFI\u2019s  SME  target  benchmarks  and  the  loss  limit  for  that  PCG.  The  conditions  of \neach  PCG  will  be  determined  on  a  case-by-case  basis  based  on  the  due  diligence  of  the  PFI \nand  its  SME  lending  processes  and  operations.  Terms  and  conditions  for  each  PCG  will  be \ndetailed in a term sheet in line with the parameters described in Appendix 7, subject to approval \nfrom the  Director General of PSOD  and the ADB Guarantee Committee (Appendix 8 provides \nsample  underwriting  guidelines).  Each  PCG  agreement  will  follow  a  standardized  format  and \ndetail  the  requirement  for  monthly  reporting,  as  well  as  prompt  information  on  any  potential \nlosses  or  defaults  in  the  portfolio.  ADB  will  monitor  the  utilization  of  the  PCG  facility  through \nannual  on-site  review  of  the  PFIs\u2019  exposure  to  SMEs,  specifically  the  portfolio  quality \nunderwritten by the PFIs, completion of agreed business targets indicated in the business plans, \nand compliance with ADB negative lists. ADB will retain the option to modify existing guarantee \nparameters  with  adequate  notice,  or  suspend  new  SME  loan  inclusions  under  the  guaranteed \nportfolio. \n \n66. \nThe  PCG  facility  is  classified  as  \u201cfinancial  intermediary\u201d  for  the  purpose  of  compliance \nwith  ADB  environmental  protection  and  social  safeguard  guidelines  and  policies.  ADB  will \nestablish  an  environment  management  system,  specified  for  each  PFI  under  the  guarantee \nagreement  to  ensure  the  PFIs  adhere  to  ADB  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines  (2003),  as  well  as  to  ADB  policies  on  involuntary  resettlement, \nindigenous  peoples,  and  procurement.  ADB  will  require  the  PFIs  under  the  guarantee \nagreements  to  acknowledge  in  progress  reports  that  all  borrowers  comply  with  health,  safety, \nand  environmental  regulations  and  standards  as  well  as  public  consultation  requirements \napplicable in the Philippines. Since the PFIs\u2019 loans to SMEs will be largely in the service, trade, \nand  light  manufacturing  sector,  involuntary  resettlement  or  detrimental  impacts  on  indigenous \n\n                                                 \n20  Memos signed on 19 April and 6 May 2004 respectively.  \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nProposed Equity Investment  \n\npeople are unlikely. As for environmental safeguards, ADB due diligence will identify areas for \nremedy, including negative lists and training as necessary. \n \nF. \n \n67. \nThe proposed equity investment in the CIB will be up to $1 million, not to exceed 25% of \nthe  total  project  cost  initially  estimated  at  $4  million.  Details  of  the  terms  and  implementation \narrangements  for  the  equity  investment  will  be  made  available  only  after  the  CISA  is  passed \n(para.  19).  The  Senate  Committee  on  Banks,  Financial  Institutions,  and  Currencies  has \nreviewed and endorsed the draft bill which is targeted for approval before the end of 2005.  \n \n68. \nFollowing  board  approval  and  the  passing  of  the  CISA,  PSOD  will  conduct  a  thorough \ndue  diligence  on  the  equity  investment  and  present  its  findings  to  the  Private  Sector  Credit \nCommittee.  BSP  is  currently  developing  a  detailed  business  plan,  which  once  finalized  will  be \nreviewed by PSOD. PSOD will submit a detailed investment proposal covering all key aspects \nof  the  equity  investment  including  financial  projections,  and  information  on  the  concept, \nstructure,  management,  and  ownership  of  the  company.  ADB\u2019s  final  decision  to  invest  will  be \nsubject to approval by the Private Sector Credit Committee and successful completion of legal \ndocumentation. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impact  \n\nA. \n \nThe  SMEDSP,  associated  TA,  and  JFICT  project  are  expected  to  contribute  to  an \n69. \nimproved enabling environment for SMEs, a financially stronger SB Corporation better equipped \nto  expand  its  portfolio  at  the  wholesale  and  retail  level,  expanded  SME  lending  by  SB \nCorporation and commercial banks, improved access to credit information by banks and other \ncredit providers, and increased SME growth and job creation by SMEs. SMEs are expected to \nbenefit from better access to and augmented availability of finance. The project preparatory TA \nreport  provided  estimates  based  on  previous  lending.  During  1994\u20131997  under  the  wholesale \nlending  window  P1  million  lent  generated  3.18  additional  jobs,  and  under  the  retail  window \n1999\u20132003  P1  million  lent  generated  6.74  additional  jobs.  Using  that  as  a  guide,  a  static \ncalculation  indicates  at  least  3,500  and  1,800  additional  jobs  under  the  two  lending  windows \nrespectively. However, any estimates can only give indicative figures given the variety of SMEs \nin  terms  of  labor  intensity.  Successful  project  implementation  will  result  in  increased  SME \ninvestments,  output,  exports,  and  employment;  but  exact  targets  for  each  variable  are  not \nrealistic.  The  SMEDSP  will  be  effectively  complemented  by  other  development  programs \ntargeted  at  BDS  (GTZ  and  Canadian  International  Development  Agency),  microenterprises \n(United States Agency for International Development), SMEs in the Visayas region (KfW), and \npossible further assistance by other development partners. A summary of poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy considerations is given in Appendix 11.  \n \nB. \n \n70. \nOne of the main factors affecting SMEDSP is overall the macroeconomic environment. \nCurrent  projections  for  the  Philippines  indicate  an  average  4.9%  annual  real  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth for 2005\u20132009, with inflation on a downward trend to about 4% and the \nbudget deficit being reduced to about 1% of GDP by 2009. Adverse developments in the world \neconomy could dampen growth prospects in the Philippines; conversely, higher than projected \ngrowth in the world economy could lead to higher growth.  \n\nRisks and Assumptions  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\n \n71. \nThe  main  assumptions  for  the  SMEDSP  also  carry  some  risks  that  are  addressed  by \nmitigating  measures.  The  assumptions  are  (i)  the  Government  is  strongly  committed  and  has \nthe capacity to implement the SMEDSP as an integral part of a comprehensive support program \nfor  SME  development;  (ii)  SB  Corporation  has  sufficient  capacity  to  absorb  the  ADB  loan;  (iii) \ncredit expansion of SB Corporation will not have any potential adverse impact on private sector \nbanks; and (iv) private banks have the capacity to effectively utilize the resources, including the \nPCG.  \n \n72. \nThe Government is strongly committed to supporting SME development by implementing \nthe SME Development Plan 2004\u20132010, and President Arroyo\u2019s 10-point agenda as expanded \nin  the  MTPDP  2004\u20132010.  The  MTPDP  emphasizes  the  need  to  increase  investments  and \ntrade, and recognizes that the high cost of doing business must be reduced, and infrastructure \nmodernized  to  realize  growth  and  employment  targets.  The  action  program  to  prioritize  and \nimplement  the  SME  Development  Plan  will  ensure  appropriate  sequencing  and  securing \nbudgetary allocations or aid funding for activities. The SME Donor Working Group is an active \nforum for collaboration to ensure that efforts are complementary. \n \n73. \nSB  Corporation  is  expected  to  be  able  to  channel  funds  effectively  through  accredited \nPFIs  as  these  are  experienced  SME  lenders  with  a  broad  network  of  branches.  The  selection \ncriteria used under the accreditation system of SB Corporation are quite conservative and can \ncorrespond  to  ADB  Guidelines  on  Financial  Intermediary  Loans  for  selecting  PFIs.  SB \nCorporation  has  developed  a  model  for  retail  lending,  has  a  proven  track  record  of  SME \nfinancing  operations,  and  a  strong  pipeline  of  projects  for  both  retail  and  wholesale.  The \nassociated TA will strengthen SB Corporation\u2019s credit underwriting and risk management. Upon \nenactment  of  amendments  to  the  SME  Magna  Carta,  Republic  Act  6977,  SB  Corporation  will \nhave (i) discretion in its staffing and remuneration policies, (ii) a sovereign guarantee reinstated, \nand (iii) greater discretion over funding and investment decisions.  \n \n74. \nAs a GFI, SB Corporation abides by Executive Order 138, which limits GFIs to providing \nwholesale funds to private financial institutions engaged in retail lending. The order only allows \nGFIs  to  provide  retail  services  to  the  target  sectors  not  adequately  served  by  private  financial \ninstitutions.  Thus  retail  lending  operations  of  SB  Corporation  are  mandated  to  support  SMEs \nunderserved  by  the  private  sector  financial  institutions.  Expanding  SB  Corporation  lending \noperations  has  no  potential  adverse  impact  on  private  sector  banks.  On  the  contrary,  SB \nCorporation aims to capture the underserved segment of the SME market and has a policy to \ngraduate its borrowers to become private sector bank clients. SB Corporation\u2019s capacity will be \nstrengthened through TA to ensure that credit expansion is undertaken in a prudent manner. \n \n75. \nTo  ensure  effective  utilization  of  the  PCG,  PCG  allocation  will  be  made  based  on  the \ndemand projected by the selected banks. ADB will also bear the operational risk on the PFIs in \nterms of their credit assessment and due diligence in identifying reliable SMEs. These risks are \nmitigated by the (i) loss-sharing structure of the project where the PFI will cover 50% share on \ncredit loss, (ii) annual review of the PFI\u2019s credit program where ADB reserves the right to cancel \nthe unused limit, and (iii) the PFI accounting for a credit risk equivalent to the full extent of the \nunguaranteed  portion  (i.e.  no  third  party  insurance,  guarantees,  or  government  subsidy)  to \nincrease commitment to the credit program. \n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances  \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and/or  SB  Corporation  have \n\n76. \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nSB Corporation will implement the lending strategy outlined in the MTPDP, and \nstrengthen  its  financial  performance  and  risk  management  with  support  of  ADB \nTA. The performance targets to be reached include, at least an annual return on \nassets of no less than 2.0%, capital adequacy ratio not less than 10% by 2009, \nand  nonperforming  loan  ratio  below  the  industry  average  by  the  end  of  2009 \n(based on BSP\u2019s classification of SB Corporation). \n\nSB  Corporation  will  actively  advocate  for  the  amendment  of  the  SME  Magna \nCarta  to  (a)  reinstate  the  sovereign  guarantee  to  SB  Corporation,  (b)  allow  SB \nCorporation\u2019s board greater discretion in funding and investment decisions, and \n(c)  allow  SB  Corporation  to  independently  determine  staffing  structure  and \nremuneration. Implementation will be undertaken immediately upon enactment of \nthe  amendments  SB  Corporation  will  undertake  a  review  of  human  resource \npolicies,  remuneration,  and  organizational  structure  to  assess  whether  current \nstaffing is optimal to undertake the added responsibilities and manage expanded \nfunding to meet performance targets.  \n\nSB  Corporation  will  develop  a  separate  strategy  with  performance  and  financial \ntargets for its guarantee products to meet the overall strategy of supporting SME \nfinance outlined in the MTPDP.  \n\nframeworks \n\nSB Corporation will assess and report by 2009 the feasibility, regulatory, and risk \nmanagement \nto \ncomplement  lending  such  as  (a)  funds  for  start-up  businesses,  and  (b)  venture \ncapital \nfor  such \nmodalities. \n\nfunds:  and  assess  possible  public-private  partnerships \n\nfor  alternative  modalities  of  SME \n\nfinance \n\nSB  Corporation  will  ensure  that  SMEs  adhere  to  Government  environmental \nlaws; \nregulations  and  standards;  and  ADB  environmental  procedures, \nrequirements,  and  guidelines,  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  for  activities \nfinanced under the Project; and undertake appropriate monitoring and mitigation \nmeasures.  \n\n(vi) \n\nDTI  will  make  the  PBR  operational  within  1  year  from  the  release  of  funds  and \nstart of implementation. \n\n(vii)  DTI  will  assess  alternative  modes  of  collateral  including  a  personal  guarantee \n\nsystem and secured transactions based on movable property. \n\n \n77.  \nIn  addition  all  PFIs  participating  in  the  PCG  will  ensure  that  the  guaranteed  SMEs \nadhere to Government environmental laws, regulations and standards, and ADB environmental \nprocedures,  requirements,  and  guidelines,  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  for  activities  being \nfinanced under the Project, and undertake appropriate monitoring and mitigation measures. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21\n\n \n\nPSOD\u2019s Investment Limits \n\nB. \n \nThe  proposed  private  sector  assistance,  which  is  PSOD\u2019s  14th  in  the  Philippines,  will, \n78.  \nonce  approved  by  the  Board,  represent  1.42%  of  PSOD\u2019s  total  exposure,21 increase  country \nexposure  to  6.98%,  and  increase  exposure  to  SMEs  to  1.42%.

\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAN OVIERVIEW OF SMALL BUSINESS GUARANTEE AND FINANCE CORPORATION \n \n\nA. \n\nOwnership, Management and Organization, and Supervision \n\n1. \nThe  Small  Business  Guarantee  and  Finance  Corporation  (SB  Corporation),  a \ngovernment financial institution (GFI), was established on 24 January 1991 under Republic Act \n6977 also known as the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Magna Carta, to function as the \nSME  financing  champion  of  the  national  Government.  Subscribed  and  paid-up  capital  as  of \nDecember  2003  amounted  to  P1.8  billion  contributed  by  five  government  entities  and  the \nGovernment.1 \n \nA nine-member board of directors governs SB Corporation, comprising a representative \n2. \neach  of  the  five  shareholders,  three  private  sector  representatives  and  the  chief  executive \nofficer who is also the chairs. The chair is responsible for overall operations of SB Corporation, \nassisted by a president and seven group heads. SB Corporation\u2019s head office is in Makati City, \nMetro Manila; it has two regional offices in Cebu and Davao, and two representative offices in \nLuzon. Total number of employees is currently 138. As a GFI, SB Corporation is subject to the \nSalary Standardization Law. \n \nOn 16 November 2001, SB Corporation merged with the Guarantee Fund for Small and \n3. \nMedium Enterprises, a guarantee fund operated by the Livelihood Corporation attached to the \nOffice  of  the  President.  It  had  offered  guarantee  services  to  participating  financial  institutions \n(PFIs)  lending  to  SMEs  since  the  start  of  its  operations  in  1984.  With  the  merger,  the \nGovernment became the largest shareholder of SB Corporation.2 \n \n4. \nSB Corporation is supervised by Bangko Sentral Ng Pilipinas (BSP) and adheres to BSP \nregulations on loan classification, provisioning, and single borrower limits even though it is not \nlicensed as a bank. As a GFI, SB Corporation is audited annually by the Commission on Audit, \nwhich publishes the audits on its website, as well as providing print copies.  \n \n5. \nIn March 2004, a new Oracle-based management information system was implemented \ncovering  retail  lending,  wholesale  credit  lines,  and  guarantees.  The  standardized  features \nensure  that  all  necessary  data  are  entered  into  the  database  and  performance  analysis  and \nevaluations  can  be  done  by  line  of  business  or  even  further  refined,  such  as  by  subsector, \ngeographic region, company asset size, or loan size. Retail lending data for all retail loans since \n2002 has been input to the system to allow effective follow-up and analysis of loan performance \nand defaults. The plan is to put in all data for retail lending since it started in 1999 to form the \nbasis for a credit-scoring model. The number of loans is not sufficient for a full-fledged statistical \nmodel but do support work on a judgmental model and provide data for the associated technical \nassistance  (TA)  aimed  at  improving  the  credit  underwriting  process.  Likewise,  the  database \nprovides  SB  Corporation\u2019s  management  and  board  with  detailed  data  to  support  decisions  on \nthe  various  lending  and  guarantee  programs,  as  well  as  facilitates  financial  management  and \nplanning. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Land Bank of the Philippines, Development Bank of the Philippines, Social Security System, Government Service \n\nInsurance System, and Philippine National Bank. \n\n2   The current shareholdings  are: national Government  44.30%, Landbank of  the Philippines 20.05%, Development \nBank of the Philippines 11.14%, Social Security System 11.14%, Government Service Insurance System 11.14%, \nand Philippine National Bank 2.23%.  \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nB.  \n\nOperations  \n\n6. \nSB  Corporation\u2019s  operations  cover  three  areas:  guarantees,  and  wholesale  and  retail \nSME  lending.  The  target  market  is  classified  into  three  groups  of  SMEs:  bankable,  nearly \nbankable,  and  prebankable  but  viable  SMEs.  For  bankable  SMEs,  the  SB  Corporation  offers \nwholesale  lending  facilities  to  help  SMEs  obtain  funding  from  the  formal  financial  sector  at \nreasonable  interest  rates  with  longer  payment  terms.  For  nearly  bankable  SMEs,  SB \nCorporation offers guarantee facilities allowing SMEs access to credit from the formal financial \nsector  by  securing  a  certain  percentage  of  the  loan  (up  to  85%).  For  prebankable  but  viable \nSMEs, SB Corporation provides direct loans for short-term receivables, purchase order and/or \nletter  of  credit  financing  as  well  as  working  capital  and  fixed  asset  financing.  Features  that \ndifferentiate  SB  Corporation\u2019s  lending  from  banks  is  that  SB  Corporation  offers  smaller  loans, \nwith  longer  repayment  terms  at  fixed  interest  rates.  In  terms  of  collateral,  SB  Corporation \naccepts a broader range of collateral (e.g., real estate, motor vehicles, receivables, purchasing \norders,  and  corporate  guarantees)  compared  with  banks  that  mainly  accept  titled  prime  real \nestate lots. Collateral is valued at 64% of principal. This is in order to reach the target group of \nSMEs with smaller financing needs than commercial banks tend to accommodate. \n \n7. \nGuarantee operations started in 1992, and by 31 December 2003, SB Corporation had \nguaranteed  a  total  of  4,675  accounts  for  P8.66  billion.  Cumulative  guarantee  payments  from \n1993  to  2002  were  at  P101.64  million  ($1.8  million)  with  recoveries  of  P44.86  million  ($0.8 \nmillion).  The  payments  represent  4.8%  of  total  guarantees  approved  and  issued  by  SB \nCorporation  for  the  same  period.  The  process  for  guarantees  is  as  follows.  Applications \nreceived  from  PFIs  are  reviewed  by  the  Credit  Guarantees  Group  at  SB  Corporation.  They \nundertake  a  second  due  diligence  of  the  application  and  if  complete  and  favorably  evaluated, \nthe application is then sent to the Credit Committee for approval. The Credit Guarantees Group \nis seriously understaffed resulting in long processing times, and this, in combination with the fact \nthat  SB  Corporation  does  not  have  a  sovereign  guarantee,  are  cited  by  banks  as  reasons  for \ntheir limited use of SB Corporation\u2019s guarantee.  \n \n8. \nThe  wholesale  lending  window  was  introduced  in  1994.  SB  Corporation\u2019s  board \naccredits  financial  institutions  if  they  meet  specified  criteria.  Financial  institutions  can  be \naccredited either through a fast-track or regular process. The fast-track process applies to the \ntop 50% of expanded commercial banks in the Philippines and the top five commercial banks. \nThe minimum criteria for these banks are (i) the bank must be in good standing with BSP and/or \nlisted  at  the  Philippine  Stock  Exchange,  (ii)  have  a  satisfactory  track  record  of  dealing  with \ncredits  with  other  GFIs,  (iii)  have  a  nonperforming  loan  ratio  below  20%,  and  (iv)  a  CAMELS3 \nrating of 3 at BSP. All other banks are accredited through the regular process, which include a \nqualitative  evaluation  of  the  financial  institutions  performance  for  the  3  years  preceding \naccreditation. Ratios are calculated for profitability, collection efficiency, solvency, and liquidity. \nThe qualitative evaluation includes assessments of (i) the management, board, and key offices; \n(ii)  ownership  structure;  (iii)  background  and  history  of  the  bank;  (iv)  compliance  BSP\u2019s \nregulations on single borrower limits, DOSRI (director, officer, shareholder of the bankd or their \nrelated interests) rules, loan loss provisioning, and capitalization; (vi) compliance with the legally \nmandated lending to SMEs; and (vii) rate of lending activity. Accredited financial institutions then \nget  access  to  a  credit  line  for  onlending  to  SMEs  in  SB  Corporation\u2019s  target  groups.  As  of \nJanuary  2005,  30  PFIs  were  accredited  and  active.  Some  smaller  banks  reportedly  seek  SB \nCorporation  accreditation  more  as  a  seal  of  good  standing  than  as  a  means  to  augment  their \nlending  resources  and  thus  tend  to  make  limited  use  of  SB  Corporation\u2019  wholesale  lending \n\n                                                 \n3   CAMELS stands for capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3          31 \n \n\nfacility. The most active PFIs promote SB Corporation\u2019s products to the intended target groups. \nA  strong  feature  of  SB  Corporation\u2019s  products  is  that  the  interest  rates  are  fixed,  and  PFIs \nusually revise interest rates monthly for their own lending products.  \n \nEligible  SMEs  cannot  be  engaged  in  farm-level  agri/aqua  production,  extractive \n9. \nindustries (mining/quarrying); trading of imported goods, liquor, or cigarettes; housing projects; \nor  trading  of  banned  substances.  The  loans  range  from  P100,000  to  P15,000,000  with \nmaturities between 1\u20135 years. In the wholesale lending program, 1 June 2005 SB Corporation \nwas  charging  PFIs  relending  rates  of  7.2%  up  to  90  days,  7.5%  91\u2013181  days,  7.8%  182\u2013270 \ndays, 8.2% 271\u2013360 days, 9.2% 1\u20133 years, 9.7% 3\u20135 years, and 10.2% 5\u20137 years. The PFIs \nadd  charges  ranging  from  4\u20138%  to  cover  their  costs  and  reflect  the  perceived  risk.  Monthly \ncharges  to  PFIs  are  computed  based  on  80%  of  MART  1  plus  0.1%  plus  gross  receipts  tax. \nPFIs  own  funding  costs  vary  but  the  average  deposit  rate  for  pesos  in  May  2005  was  5.1%. \nFrom 1994 to December 2003, P8.53 billion were disbursed  benefiting 5,158 SMEs.  \n \n10. \nThe  accredited  and  active  financial institutions  include  (i)  commercial  banks:  Banco  de \nOro, Bank of Commerce, Development Bank of the Philippines, Equitable Bank, Land Bank of \nthe Philippines and Philippine National Bank; (ii) thrift banks: Bank, Anchor Savings, Asia Trust \nBank,  Dumaguete  City  Development,  First  Consolidated,  Insular  Savings  Bank,  Malayan \nSavings  Bank,  Planter\u2019s  Development  Bank,  Postal  Savings  Bank,  and  Robinsons  Savings \nBank;  (iii)  rural  banks:  Bank  of  Florida,  BMS  Rural  Bank,  Cooperative  Bank  of  Miramis, \nEnterprise  Capital  Bank,    Excel  Rural  Bank,  First  Macro  Bank,  Maranao  Rural  Bank,  and \nProvidence Rural Bank, and nonbank financial institutions; and (iv) Landbank of the Philippines \nLeasing  and  Majalco  Finance.  Through  this  network  of  accredited  financial  institutions  SB \nCorporation has a nationwide reach for their products.  \n \n11. \nRetail lending was started in 1999 following a Government decision to ensure that SMEs \nhad access to credit after the Asian financial crises. SMEs course their applications through SB \nCorporation\u2019s offices in Manila, Cebu, or Davao, where they are screened by account officers, \nwho  ensure  that  applications  are  complete.  A  site  visit  is  undertaken  before  applications  are \nsent to the credit committee in the Manila office for approval. From 1999 to December 2003, a \ntotal  of  P1.4  billion  had  been  disbursed  to  1,207  SMEs.  The  nonperforming  loan  ratio  of  the \ndirect lending was recorded at 6.7% as of 31 December 2003.  \n \n12. \nSMEs  eligible  for  loans  under  the  retail  lending  window  must  have  between  P500,000 \nand P1,000,000 in assets, be at least 60% Filipino owned if it is a corporation, and must have at \nleast a 1 year profitable track record. Eligible SMEs cannot be engaged in farm-level agri/aqua \nproduction, extractive industries (mining/quarrying), trading of imported goods, housing projects, \nor  vice-generating  activities  (tobacco).  The  minimum  loan  amount  granted  is  P200,000,  and \nmaximum  P5  million.  The  repayment  term  is  up  to  5  years  and  interest  rates  are  fixed.  The \nrange  of  acceptable  collateral  includes  real  estate,  motor  vehicles,  equipment,  assignment  of \nreceivables, and corporate guarantees. The interest rates as of 1 June 2005 are 9.5% for fully \nsecured loans up to 1 year, 13.8% for 1\u20133 years, and 14.5% for 3\u20135 years. An additional charge \nis  made  for  partially  secured/at  least  50%  secured  loans  of  1%  per  annum,  and  2%  for \npartially/less  than  50%  secured  loans.  Interest  rates  on  retail  loans  are  computed  based  on \nSulong rates determined by the GFIs. \n \n13. \nIn 2004 SB Corporation launched a new business line to broaden its support for SMEs, \nthe Equity Ventures Program, aimed at supporting the financing needs of SMEs that are \u201cready \nto develop into a higher level of marketing, technical, management and operation.\u201d SMEs must \nbe proprietorships/partnerships and meet a number of requirements. The amount of investment \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n  Financial Performance  \n\nis limited to P20 million or 40% of authorized capital of the SME whichever is lower. Along with \nsponsors  SB  Corporation  can  provide  equity  investments  on  a  50:50  basis  through  an \ninvestment  fund.  The  investment  fund  will  exit  after  4\u20135  years  through  redemption  of  stock, \ninitial public offering, or sale to a third party. The first equity investment was approved in 2004, \nfor P6 million in convertible notes.  \n \n14. \nIn  July  2003,  SB  Corporation\u2019s  management  appointed  a  management  committee  and \ncredit  committee  member  as  environmental  rules  and  standards  compliance  officer.  SB \nCorporation  is  currently  using  the  Handbook  of  Environmental  Standards  and  the  Manual  on \nEnvironmental  Due  Diligence  in  Project  Evaluation  developed  by  Development  Bank  of  the \nPhilippines  (DBP).  The  manual  has  a  step-by-step  procedure  for  applying  environmental  due \ndiligence  to  the  evaluation  of  loan  applications,  and  guidelines  for  site  visits,  environmental \naudits, and performance monitoring. DBP was ISO 14001 certified by SGS Switzerland SA from \n2002\u20132004  for  its  successful  implementation  of  an  environmental  management  system.  SB \nCorporation management has authorized recruitment of a consultant to review the manual and \nprocesses\u2014and if deemed necessary\u2014adapt and update it specifically for SB Corporation and \ntheir  focus  on  SMEs.  In  addition  to  the  environmental  due  diligence  undertaken  by  SB \nCorporation,  banks  require  an  environmental  compliance  certificate  from  the  Department  of \nEnvironment and Natural Resources from companies involved in manufacturing. \n \nC. \n \n15. \nHistorical  Performance. Table A6 shows SB Corporation\u2019s financial performance over \nthe  past  5  years,  and  projections  for  2005\u20132009.  At  present,  SB  Corporation  appears  to  be \nhighly liquid, with cash and Government securities accounting for slightly more than 47% of total \nassets.  However,  under  the  terms  of  its  borrowing  arrangement  with  DBP,  SB  Corporation  is \nrequired  to  maintain  Government  securities  equal  to  its  DBP  borrowings.  This  requirement \nnotwithstanding,  a  key  challenge  for  SB  Corporation  is  to  reduce  these  lower  yielding  assets, \nand replace them with higher yielding loans.  \n \n16. \nThe  loan  portfolio  at  fiscal  year  (FY)  2004  accounts  for  approximately  45%  of  total \nassets. Direct lending operations are projected to grow by about 30% per year over the next 5 \nyears.  At  this  pace  the  portfolio  will  double  in  size  by  fiscal  year-end  (FYE)  2007.  Over  the \nprojection period, SB Corporation also plans steady reductions in nonperforming loans (NPLs), \nwith the ratio of NPLs to total loans set to fall from 24% at FYE2004, to 8% by FYE2009. NPLs \ninclude  called  guarantees  that  have  been  converted  to  loans  (by  nature  past  due  and  thus \nnonperforming); NPLs from direct lending operations are significantly lower than the total NPL \nfigure if the called guarantees are excluded. At FYE2004, SB Corporation estimates NPLs from \nits direct lending to be approximately 6%, well under control and substantially below the industry \naverage of about 14%. It estimates wholesale lending will account for slightly more than 60% of \ntotal  lending  as  of  FYE2004.  Retail  lending  is  presently  35%  of  the  portfolio.  At  present,  SB \nCorporation  does  a  small  amount  of  microlending  (on  a  wholesale  basis,  to  microfinance \ninstitutions, which accounts for 3% of the portfolio as of FYE2004.  \n \nSB  Corporation  must  maintain  a  strong  capital  base  in  order  to  support  its  guarantee \n17. \nbusiness.  As  of  FYE2004,  shareholders\u2019  equity  is  estimated  to  be  67%  of  total  assets.  While \nfrom the point of view of creditors and regulators, this strong capital base is a source of comfort, \nthe  challenge  for  management  is  to  leverage  the  equity  base  in  order  to  generate  returns \nsufficient to create enterprise value. SB Corporation is a profitable operation, and the estimate \nfor FYE2004 is 3.3% return on assets.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3          33 \n \n\nComparison  of  SB  Corporation  with  Philippine  Banks.  SB  Corporation\u2019s  financial \n18. \nperformance  in  key  areas  compares  favorably  to  Philippine  commercial  banking  industry \naverages.  Evaluating  SB  Corporation\u2019s  audited  financial  statements  in  comparison  to  BSP\u2019s \npublished Selected Performance Indicators for the banking system as of 31 December 2003, SB \nCorporation emerges as significantly better capitalized: 79% equity to total assets, versus 13% \nfor  commercial  banks,  and  more  profitable,  as  measured  by  return  on  assets:  1.8%  versus \nbanks\u2019 1.1%. Regarding NPLs, SB Corporation\u2019s average was slightly below industry average, \nof  13.1%  versus  the  banks\u2019  13.6%  (both  figures  as  of  31  December  2003).  In  addition,  SB \nCorporation  maintains  significantly  higher  reserve  coverage  of  NPLs  than  the  average  for \nbanks, with provisions equal to 72.2% of NPLs as of 31 December 2004, versus 51.6% average \nreserve coverage for banks as of 30 September 2004.  \n \nProjected Performance. For the upcoming 5 years, fiscal years 2005 through 2009, SB \n19. \nCorporation  plans  to  reduce  cash  and  Government  securities  to  no  more  than  15%  of  total \nassets.  As  the  portfolio  grows,  wholesale  lending  will  increase  to  71%  of  the  loan  portfolio  by \nFYE2009, while retail and microfinance institution lending are expected to account for 14% and \n15%, respectively, by FYE2009. Over the projection period, borrowings (liabilities) will increase \nsubstantially,  and  the  ratio  of  equity  to  total  assets  will  be  reduced  to  43.4%  by  FYE2009. \nNonperforming  loans  (from  own  lending,  that  is,  outside  of  SB  Corporation\u2019s  guarantee \noperations)  will  be  reduced  gradually,  from  about  6%  in  2004,  to  4.4%  in  2009;  overall,  NPLs \nwill be reduced to 8%, from the present nearly 21% registered as of end-2005. New borrowings, \nincluding  long-term  loans  from  ADB,  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development,  and \nKreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau,  will  supplement  equity.  Management  projects  fairly  steady \nprofitability over the next 5 years driven by sound spread management combined with effective \ncost control. Spread projections adequately take into consideration increased borrowing costs; \nprojected  spreads  are  lower  than  during  the  preceding  3  years.  In  addition,  salary  and \nadministrative expenses increase steadily in absolute terms, though not as a percentage of total \nassets,  meaning  that  management  has  considered  the  necessity  to  expand  the  size  of  the \noperations to support portfolio growth.  \n \n20. \nThe key challenge for SB Corporation\u2019s managers is to increase balance sheet leverage \n(by expanding lending operations funded with borrowings), and at the same time control the rise \nin  operating  costs  as  the  portfolio  grows.  SB  Corporation\u2019s  projections  are  free  of  excessively \noptimistic assumptions. The projected growth in total lending of about 30% per year represents \nthe  single  assumption  that  could  be  characterized  as  even  moderately  aggressive.  ADB  can \ntake great comfort from the primarily wholesale nature of SB Corporation\u2019s operations, and the \nstrong  demand  for  funds  from  SB  Corporation\u2019s  PFIs.  In  addition,  SB  Corporation  is  clearly \ncommitted  to  maintaining  credit  quality,  which  means  that  loan  portfolio  quality  will  not  be \nsacrificed  in  the  interests  of  asset  growth.  Furthermore,  the  complementary  TA  will  assist  SB \nCorporation to strengthen loan product development and credit underwriting, along with financial \nmanagement. In short, the projections are reasonable and achievable, and the organization is \nsound and capable. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nItem \n\nBalance Sheet \n\nAssets \n\nLoans, Net \n\nROPOA, Net (4) \n\nFixed Assets \n\nOther Assets \n\nTotal Assets \n\nLiabilities \n\nCurrent Liabilities \n\nLong-term Borrowings \n\nTotal Liabilities \n\nShareholders' Equity \n\nTable A3:SB Corporation - Key Financial Data \n(P millions) \n\n31 Dec \n2002 \n\n31 Dec \n2003 \n\n21 Dec \n2004 \n\n31 Dec \n2005 \n\n31 Dec \n2006 \n\n31 Dec \n2007 \n\n31 Dec \n2008 \n\n31 Dec \n2009 \n\n(1)\n\n \n\n(1)\n\n \n\n(2)\n\n \n\n(3)\n\n \n\n(3) \n\n \n\n(3) \n\n \n\n(3)\n\n \n\n(3)\n\nCash and Government Securities \n\n1,172       1,145        1,526        2,069        1,933        1,769           909           974 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLiabilities and Shareholders' Equity \n\n629       1,203        1,439        1,754        2,353        3,035        3,887        5,013 \n\n75            73             67             63             58             50             47             47 \n\n114          113           112           110           109           107           106           104 \n\n60            62             76             98           110           124           123           154 \n\n2,050       2,596        3,220        4,095        4,563        5,086        5,072        6,293 \n\n30            34             63           106           128           143           135           192 \n           \u2013          500        1,000        1,761        2,137        2,521        2,374        3,369 \n\n30          534        1,063        1,867        2,264        2,664        2,509        3,561 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPaid-in Capital \n\n1,875       1,875        1,875        1,923        1,971        2,060        2,150        2,240 \n\nRetained Earnings \n\n145          187           283           306           328           361           413           492 \n\nTotal Shareholders' Equity \n\n2,019       2,062        2,158        2,229        2,299        2,421        2,563        2,731 \n\nTotal Liabilities and Shareholders' \nEquity \n\n2,050       2,596        3,220        4,095        4,563        5,086        5,072        6,293 \n\nIncome Statement \n\nInterest Income \n\nInterest Expense \n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n150          147           256           320           352           406           451           526 \n\n2              3             46             88           117           138           144           169 \n\nNet Interest Income \n\n149          144           210           232           235           268           307           357 \n\nOther Income/Expense \n\n(22)          (20)           (24)          (26)          (17)          (15)          (19)          (23)\n\nOperating Expenses \n\n72            81             90           103           116           130           147           166 \n\nNet Income \n\n54            42             96           103           102           123           142           169 \n\nRatios (%) \nCash & Govt Securities as % of Total \nAssets \nBorrowed Funds as % of Total Assets \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal Liabilities to Equity \n\nEquity to Total Assets \n\n57\n\n0\n\n2\n\n99\n\n44\n\n19\n\n26\n\n79\n\n47\n\n31\n\n49\n\n67\n\n51\n\n43\n\n84\n\n54\n\n42 \n\n47 \n\n99 \n\n50 \n\n35 \n\n50 \n\n110 \n\n48 \n\n18\n\n47\n\n98\n\n51\n\n15\n\n54\n\n130\n\n43\n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3          35 \n \n\nNPLs % of Total Outstanding Loans (5) \n\nWholesale Lending as % of Total \nLending (6) \n\nGrowth of Net Loan Portfolio \n\nNet Margin (Net Income / Total \nRevenue) \n\nROA (Average Assets after 2002)) \n\nROE (Average Equity after 2002) \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n25\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n36\n\n3\n\n3\n\n \n\n \n\n13\n\n\u2013\n91\n\n28\n\n2\n\n2\n\n \n\n \n\n24\n\n61\n20\n\n37\n\n3\n\n5\n\n \n\n \n\n21\n\n68\n22\n\n32\n\n3\n\n5\n\n16 \n\n70 \n34 \n\n \n\n \n\n29 \n\n2 \n\n5 \n\n12 \n\n70 \n29 \n\n \n\n \n\n30 \n\n3 \n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n\n10\n\n70\n28\n\n31\n\n3\n\n6\n\n8\n\n71\n29\n\n32\n\n3\n\n6\n\n \n\u2013 = not available (1) Actual based on Annual Reports audited by the Commission on Audit , (2) Estimated, (3) Projected, \n(4) Real and other properties owned or acquired, and (5) Nonperforming loans.  \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n1. \nA  number  of  development  agencies  provided  various  assistance  to  micro,  small,  and \nmedium  enterprises.  Agrarian  and  rural  projects  target  micro  and  small  enterprises.  Bilateral \nagencies and United Nations technical assistance (TA) agencies tend to focus their activities on \nstrengthening business development services (BDS) for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) \nand capacity building of microfinance institutions. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  supported  SME  development  under  the  Third \n2. \nDevelopment Bank of the Philippines (DBP) Project approved in 1991 with a loan of $100 million \nequivalent  for  SME  capital  investment,  via  DBP\u2019s  wholesale  lending  and  its  participating \nfinancial institutions (PFIs).  \n \n3. \nThe World Bank financed agrarian, micro, and small enterprises through the Landbank \nof  the  Philippines,  including  (i)  the  Agricultural  Loan  Fund  ($120  million)  for  agriculture  and \nagribusiness  projects  nationwide;  and  (ii)  Countryside  Loan  Funds  I,  II,  and  III  ($150  million \neach)  to  finance  various  economic  sectors.  The  third  of  these  loans,  approved  in  1998  for  $5 \nmillion, was used for microcredit lending through the People\u2019s Credit and Finance Corporation. \n \n4. \nThe  International  Finance  Corporation,  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department, \nand Netherlands Development Corporation have equity stakes in Planters Development Bank, \nthe largest SME bank in the Philippines. \n \n5. \nKredistanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW,  German  Financial  Cooperation)  provided  DM15 \nmillion  for  the  Small  and  Micro-enterprise  Credit  Project  II  of  the  Landbank  of  the  Philippines \nand Philippine Business for Social Progress. The project used the Philippine Business for Social \nProgress  as  a  second-tier  wholesaler  of  funds  to  accredited  PFIs  for  onlending  to  micro, \ncottage,  and  small  enterprises.  KfW  also  funded  the  Window  III  facility  of  DBP  for  highly \ndevelopmental  loans.  Currently,  KfW  is  preparing  an  SME  credit  line  to  SB  Corporation  of  \u20ac6 \nmillion  for  onlending  via  selected  PFIs  to  SMEs  in  the  Visayas  region.  A  TA  for  \u20ac600,000  to \nstrengthen the capacity of SB Corporation will accompany the planned credit line. \n  \nThe  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  funded  the  Rural  Farmers  and  Agrarian \n6. \nSupport  Credit  Program  with  $89  million.  It  is  exclusively  aimed  at  financing  postharvest \nfacilities and production credit of cooperatives members. \n \nto \n7. \nmicroenterprises  through  the  Credit  Union  Empowerment  and  Strengthening  Program, \nMicroenterprise  Access  to  Banking  Services  Project,  and Credit  Policy  Improvement  Program. \nThese  projects  assist  microfinance  institutions  through  training  and  consultation  on  the  best \napplication  for  credit  cooperative  management.  The  Microenterprise  Access  to  Banking \nServices  Project  has  trained  113  rural  bank  units  since  its  start  in  1998.  Originally  Mindanao-\nbased,  it  has  been  expanded  under  the  Rural  Bankers  Association  of  the  Philippines  and  will \ncontinue offering TA and training to rural banks in the Philippines through 2004. \n \n8. \nThe United Nations Development Programme provided a grant of $803,000 for TA under \nthe  Microfinance  Support  Program.  The  3-year  program  aims  to  increase  the  capacity  of  20 \nmicrofinance institutions through training. \n \n\nInternational  Development  gives  support \n\nThe  United  States  Agency \n\nfor \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4          37 \n \n\nThe Japan International Cooperation Agency has provided assistance to DTI since early \n9. \n2003 in formulating a long-term SME development plan, which so far has resulted in the SME \nDevelopment Plan 2004\u20132010. \n \nThe  Canadian  International  Development  Agency  has  been  funding  various  SME \n10. \ndevelopment projects since early 1990s. In September 2002, the agency approved phase II of \nthe  Private  Enterprise  Accelerated  Resource  Linkages  Project,  a  5-year  initiative,  aimed  at \nsupporting  SME  development  throughout  the  Philippines  by  strengthening  business  support \norganizations  and  investment  promotion  groups.  In  April  2003,  it  approved  phase  II  of  the \nBusiness Advisory Project, a 5-year project geared toward provision of BDS through Canadian \nand  local  advisers.  Local  adviser  corps  will  be  developed  in  cooperation  with  Philippine \nBusiness for Social Progress. In January 2005 a local consultant was recruited to work with DTI \nin prioritizing and coordinating implementation of activities under the SME Development Plan. \n \n11. \nDeutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ)  has  launched  the  SME \nDevelopment for Sustainable Employment Program in Visayas. Formerly known as the Private \nSector Development Program, the new program intends to create business-friendly framework \nconditions,  develop  BDS  market  for  SMEs  and  microenterprises,  improve  their  access  to \nmiddle-  and  long-term  finance,  and  improve  vocational  training  and  upgrading.  It  will  provide \n\u20ac12 million over 8 years and will integrate the ongoing Promotion of Vocational Training Project \nof GTZ into the program. Apart from cooperation among German institutions such as Centrum \nfur  Internationale  Migration  und  Entwicklung,  German  Development  Service,  Internationale \nWiterbildung und Entwicklung, and KfW, cooperation will also be sought with other development \nagencies, especially with international financing institutions such as ADB, International Finance \nCorporation, and International Fund for Agricultural Development. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nASSOCIATED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUMMARY AND FRAMEWORK \n\nto  ensure \n\nthat  appropriate  non-asset-based \n\nInstitutional Capacity Building at SB Corporation  \n\n \n1. \nThe  technical  assistance  (TA),  Strengthening  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  (SME) \nCredit Management Systems1 is to strengthen the credit underwriting and risk management of \nthe  Small  Business  Guarantee  and  Finance  Corporation  (SB  Corporation),  and  work  with  the \nDepartment  of  Trade  and  Industry  to  develop  a  blueprint  for  a  movables  collateral  registry \n(Table A5).  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  TA  will  provide  international  expertise  to  SB  Corporation  managers  and  staff  in \nsupport of building efficient, profitable lending businesses that can achieve substantial outreach. \nSB  Corporation  needs  to  strengthen  its  capacity  to  evaluate  the  profitability,  credit  risk,  costs, \nand  efficiency  of  both  its  wholesale  and  retail  lending  operations.  The  TA  will  be  enhance \ncapacity to analyze costs, profitability, and credit risk in each of its two main lines of business. \nThe management information system will be improved, utilizing its Oracle-based system.  \n \n3. \nThe TA will examine the retail loan underwriting process. SB Corporation currently has a \nmore  flexible  approach  to  securing  loans,  and  accepts  a  broader  range  of  collateral,  than  do \ncommercial  banks.  A  specialist  in  loan  product  development  will  work  with  SB  Corporation \nlending  methodologies  are \nmanagement \nincorporated into their underwriting process. The underwriting techniques should allow pledged \nitems  secured  via  a  registry  of  movable  property  to  be  accepted  as  collateral.  This  would \nminimize paperwork, processing times, and transaction costs, and expand lending volumes.  \n \n4. \nThird,  the  TA  will  help  SB  Corporation  develop  a  proprietary  credit-scoring  model  that \nincorporates  SB  Corporation\u2019s  own  underwriting  standards,  and  draw  upon  lessons  learned \nfrom its own lending experience. Credit-scoring models allow financial institutions to streamline \nloan  processing,  and  thereby  increase  the  volume  of  business.  The  model  can  identify \nborrowers with poor risk profiles by evaluating key factors impacting payment performance. SB \nCorporation\u2019s database of retail customers provides an appropriate starting point for identifying \nkey  factors  affecting  credit  quality;  this  direct  customer  experience  is  necessary  to  develop  a \ncredit-scoring model that fits SB Corporation. As a result of reviewing underwriting policies and \nprocedures  and  developing  a  credit-scoring  model,  loan  products  may  be  streamlined  or \nredesigned to be better tailored to SB Corporation\u2019s clients, and be more profitable as well.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe  TA  will  create  the  blueprint  for  a  movable  collateral  registry.  Existing  laws  and \nrecommendations  will  be  reviewed  as  they  related  to  potential  amendments  and/or  new \nlegislation  required  to  expand  the  framework  for  secured  transactions  to  encompass  movable \nproperty.  A  strategy  for  developing  the  collateral  registry  involves  identifying  and  working  with \nkey stakeholders, from both the public and private sectors, who will oversee the creation of the \nregistry,  maintain  it,  and  use  it.  The  output  will  be  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  creating  the \nmovable collateral registry \n\nEnhance Legal Environment for Secured Transactions \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB.  2004.

The  introduction  of  market-based  products  to  enhance  the  channeling  of \n1. \nexisting liquidity of the financial system to small and medium enterprise (SME) lending is a key \ninnovation  supported  under  the  Project.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  partial  credit \nguarantee  (PCG)  facility,  which  in  partnership  with  selected  participating  financial  institutions \n(PFIs) shares the credit risks and rewards associated with SME lending, will raise the comfort \nlevel  of  PFIs  by  (i)  leveraging  the  PFIs\u2019  resources,  (ii)  assisting  PFIs  to  develop  client \nrelationships  with  SME  clients,  and  (iii)  introducing  good  practice  for  SME  lending  in  the \nPhilippines.  The  PCG  facility  will  initially  draw  on  international  PFIs  (based  in  the  Philippines \nand  with  existing  experience  in  SME  lending  in  other  emerging  markets)  and  primarily  top  tier \ndomestic PFIs that are accredited in the recently approved Trade Finance Facilitation Program1 \nof ADB and that have both well-established underwriting procedures of an international standard \nand experience in similar lending methodologies. Once ADB has gained initial experience with \nthe  PCG,  more  qualified  domestic  PFIs  are  expected  to  follow  the  first  tier  PFIs  and  develop \nsimilar methodologies for SME lending.2 \n \n2. \nObjective  of  the  PCG  Facility.  The  objective  of  the  PCG  facility  under  the  Project  is \ntwofold:  first,  to  leverage  through  a  market-based  approach  existing  financial  resources  of  the \nfinancial system for lending to an SME segment currently underserved by PFIs; and second, to \nprovide  catalytic  support  for  innovative  financial  products  and  approaches  in  new  and  less \nfamiliar markets. Once successfully tested with PFIs, such products will be expanded among a \nlarger  number  of  PFIs.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  PCG  facility  is  a  higher  volume  of  SME \nlending by commercial PFIs in Philippines.  \n \nA. \n\nFacility Design \n\n3. \nStructure.  ADB will share the credit risk of SME loans with selected PFIs that are also \nparticipants in the Trade Finance Facilitation Program project and have been identified by ADB \nin a thorough due diligence process. ADB will issue PCGs to PFIs to guarantee repayment of an \nagreed  portion  (up  to  50%)  of  the  SME  loan  portfolio.  The  PCGs  will  have  agreed  cover \namounts and time frames to be selected following a due diligence process. The PCGs will detail \nthe risk- and reward-sharing arrangements for individual loans within a defined portfolio of loans \nextended by the PFIs to SMEs. The loan portfolio covered under each PCG may be revolving, \nand the portfolio composition may change over time based on lending decisions of the PFI as \nagreed with ADB. ADB will not be involved in the lending decisions of the PFIs, but will agree \nwith the PFIs on the lending selection criteria and risk management process. To underscore the \nmarket  approach,  the  PCG  facility  will  be  provided  through  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations \nwithout government counterguarantee. Terms and conditions will be market based. \n \n4. \nScope.  The  PCG  facility  is  proposed  to  have  an  overall  limit  of  P1  billion  (currently \nequivalent to $18.40 million). PCGs will be issued for each PFI based on demand and prudent \n                                                 \n1   Accredited institutions in the Trade Finance Facilitation Program are: Allied Bank, Asia Trust Bank, Banco De Oro, \nBank  of  the  Philippine  Islands,  China  Bank,  Equitable-PCI  Bank,  Land  Bank,  Metro  Bank,  Philippine  Bank  of \nCommunication,  Prudential  Bank,  Rizal  Commercial  Banking  Corporation,  Security  Bank,  and  Union  Bank.    . \nAlthough  the  main  target  banks  will  be  the  local  banks  participating  in  the  Trade  Finance  Facilitation  Program \nProgram, the PCG facility can also be extended to ADB\u2019s investee bank, Planters Development Bank, where ADB \nhas prior credit experience and dealings. \n\n2   Starting the PCG facility program with a mix of one local and one international bank would be preferred, in order to \ncreate  an  atmosphere  of  competition,  diversify  the  risks,  and  draw  useful  comparisons  between  the  underwriting \nstyles and experience of the different institutions.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6      \n\n43\n\npractices,  starting  with  lower  amounts  that  can  be  gradually  increased  within  the  overall  PCG \nfacility limit. This PCG facility is expected to be extended to some 2\u20135 PFIs with sublimit set at \nup to the peso equivalent of P500 million per PFI. In addition to the 50/50 risk sharing scheme, \nADB will negotiate a first loss provision (i.e., based on the PFI\u2019s historical first loss experience) \nwhere the PFI will assume full coverage of loan defaults associated with the portfolio\u2019s first loss.  \n \n5. \nPrudent  Phasing-in  and  Close  Monitoring.  Since  the  product  is  relatively  new  for \nADB,3 the PCG facility will commence operation with primarily those domestic PFIs accredited in \nthe  Trade  Finance  Facilitation  Program  and  international  banks  that  have  well  established \nunderwriting  procedures  of  an  international  standard  and  experience  in  similar  lending \nmethodologies elsewhere, before expanding to other qualified domestic and international PFIs. \nLikewise, the portfolio of guaranteed loans will expand gradually. The tenor of guaranteed loans \nwill  be  limited  to  36  months,  although  initially  the  PCG  will  be  targeted  at  shorter  maturities. \nOnce ADB is satisfied with the track record of the PFI and its SME borrowers, portfolio targets \nmay be revised to encourage PFIs to expand to riskier segments.  \n \n6. \nThe PCG facility will be available for issuance of PCGs to PFIs for 5 years from the date \nof  establishment  of  the  facility.  Since  each  loan  guaranteed  under  the  facility  may  have  a \nmaximum repayment term of up to 3 years depending on its risk profile, the facility will have a \nmaximum tenor of up to 8 years.  \n \nPricing.  The  PFI  will  pay  ADB  a  predetermined  fee,  which  will  be  reviewed  annually. \n7. \nThe fee will be market based and determined for each PFI based on the risks identified during \nthe due diligence process and the risk-sharing mechanism agreed between ADB and the PFI.  \n \nB. \n\nImplementation and Monitoring \n\n8. \nGuarantee  Agreements,  Reporting,  and  Management.  ADB  will  enter  into  PCG \nagreements with each PFI, defining the portfolio to be covered including the PFI\u2019s SME target \nbenchmarks  and  the  loss  limit  for  that  PCG.  The  conditions  of  each  PCG  agreement  will  be \ndetermined on a case-by-case basis based on the due diligence of the PFI and its SME lending \nprocesses and operations. Terms and conditions for each PCG will be detailed in a term sheet \nin  line  with  the  parameters  described  in  the  project  documents,  subject  to  approval  from  the \nDirector General of PSOD and the ADB Guarantee Committee. Each PCG agreement will follow \na  standardized  format  and  detail  the  requirement  for  regular  reporting,  as  well  as  prompt \ninformation on any potential losses or defaults in the portfolio. ADB will monitor the utilization of \nthe  PCG  facility  through  regular  on-site  review  of  the  PFIs\u2019  exposure  to  SMEs,  especially  the \nportfolio quality underwritten by the PFIs and completion of agreed business targets indicated in \nthe business plans, and will require compliance with ADB negative lists. ADB has the option to \nmodify  existing  guarantee  parameters,  with  adequate  notice,  or  suspend  new  SME  loan \ninclusions under the guaranteed portfolio. \n \n9. \nPrior  to  the  implementation  of  any  specific  guarantee  activity,  PSOD  will  produce  an \ninternal strategy paper to be approved by the Director General of PSOD, which will be based on \na  survey  of  best  practices  for  SME  lending  from  both  multilateral,  US  and  European  sources. \nThe  paper  will  describe  how  ADB's  participation  will  improve  the  current  SME  lending \nenvironment  and  practices  in  the  Philippines.  The  paper  will  articulate  the  procedures  and \nguidelines for SME co-lending that will be the basis of negotiation with any PFI and address all \naspects of risk management of ADB's exposure including credit analysis, scoring and approval, \n                                                 \n3   The first such PCG facility was approved by the ADB Board on 19 December 2003 under the Pakistan SME Sector \nDevelopment Program (ADB. **Year**.

Manila.), \nwhich follows a similar approach. \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nloss  provisioning  and  write  off  policies.  It  will detail  the  reporting  requirements  of  any  PFI  and \nthe legal structure of such a relationship including termination provisions. PSOD shall be able to \nmonitor any PFI SME loan portfolio and arrive at objective credit judgments on individual credits \nas needed as well as the overall portfolio. \n \nLoss  Determination,  Adjustment,  and  Claims  Payment.  Risks  guaranteed  under \n10. \neach  PCG  are  losses,  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  loss-sharing  ratios,  resulting  from \nirrecoverable  principal  and/or  interest  payment  default  on  loans  included  in  the  guaranteed \nportfolio.  Losses  are  determined  by  the  PFI  in  a  transparent  manner,  which  will  include \nappropriate  documentation  of  defaults  of  loans  included  in  the  guaranteed  portfolio.  ADB  will \nreimburse  the  PFI  for  the  guaranteed  percentage  of  losses  arising  from  guaranteed  risks. \nClaims will be paid in pesos, subject to the limit of the PCG for that PFI. \n \nSafeguard  Policies.  The  PCG  facility  is  classified  as  \u201cfinancial  intermediary\u201d  for  the \n11. \npurpose  of  compliance  with  ADB  safeguard  policies.  ADB  will  establish  an  environment \nmanagement  system,  specified  for  each  PFI  under  the  guarantee  agreement  to  ensure  PFIs\u2019 \nadherence  to  ADB  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines \n(2003);  as  well  as  to  ADB  policies  on  involuntary  resettlement,  indigenous  peoples,  and \nprocurement.  ADB  will  also  require  PFIs  under  the  guarantee  agreements  to  acknowledge  in \nprogress  reports  that  all  borrowers  comply  with  health,  safety,  and  environmental  regulations \nand standards, as well as public consultation requirements applicable in the Philippines. Since \nthe  PFIs\u2019  loans  to  SMEs  will  be  largely  in  the  service,  trade,  and  light-manufacturing  sector, \ninvoluntary  resettlement  or  detrimental  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  are  unlikely.  As  for \nenvironmental safeguards, ADB\u2019s due diligence will identify areas for remedy, including negative \nlists and training as necessary.  \n\n \n\n\fSUMMARY OF THE INDICATIVE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PARTIAL CREDIT \nGUARANTEE FACILITY  \n\nAppendix 7         \n\n45\n\n \n\nFacility \n \n\nMaximum Guaranteed \nAmount  \n\nGuarantor \n\nGuaranteed Risks \n\nLevel of Guaranteed \nRisks \n\nAvailability Period \n\nFacility Term \n\nGuaranteed Loan \nPortfolio \n\nGuaranteed Borrowers \n\n \n\n \n\nA  revolving  local  currency  partial  credit  guarantee  facility  issued  to \nparticipating financial institutions (PFIs), covering an agreed level of \nguaranteed risks associated with their portfolio of loans (and or other \ncredit)  provided  to  small  and  medium  enterprise  (SME)  customers \nunder the facility.  \n \nThe  maximum  aggregate  liability  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  under  the  facility  will  not  exceed  P500  million  per  PFI\u2014the \nmaximum  guaranteed  amount.  The  maximum  aggregate  liability \nstated  will  constitute  claims  on  loss  of  principal  and/or  interest \npayments.  \n \nADB will be the sole guarantor.  \n \nA  credit  loss  resulting  from  the  nonpayment  by  the  borrower \ncontinuing  for  a  certain  period  as  specified  under  the  claim  event \nsection. \n \nUp  to  50%  of  the  guaranteed  loan  portfolio,  which  would  allow  the \nguaranteed portfolio to increase in value up to P1 billion.  \n \nADB will negotiate a first loss provision with the PFI, computed as a \npercent  of  the  guaranteed  loan  portfolio.  The  first  loss  amount  is \nequivalent to the PFI\u2019s aggregate SME portfolio\u2019s loss experience in \nthe past 3 years. ADB and the PFI will cover losses above this level \nequally. \n \nNew  loans  may  be  added  to  the  guaranteed  portfolio  for  up  to  5 \nyears from the date of signing legal documentation. This availability \nperiod  may  be  extended  upon  mutual  consent,  subject \nto \napplicability and relevance under prevailing market conditions. \n \nEach  loan  guaranteed  under  the  facility  may  have  a  maximum \nrepayment  term  of  up  to  3  years  depending  on  its  risk  profile.  As \nsuch, the facility will have a maximum tenor of up to 8 years.  \n \nThe  PFI  will  bear  the  risk  of  the  unguaranteed  portion  of  the \nguaranteed  loan  portfolio  to  the  full  extent,  i.e.,  there  should  be  no \ninsurance  (except \ninsurance),  no \ngovernment  guarantee  nor  any  other  instrument  that  reduces  the \nPFI's exposure on the guaranteed portfolio to a lower amount. \n \n \nThe  guaranteed  borrowers  will  be  carefully  selected  SMEs  in  the \nPhilippines  (the  SME  definition  of  the  PFI  will  apply),  which  meet \nprudent  credit  evaluation  and  due  diligence  guidelines  established \nby  the  PFI  and  acceptable  to  the  guarantor.  The  PFI  will  retain  the \n\nfor  property  and  casualty \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nGuaranteed Loans \n\nCosts \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClaim Event and \nProcedure \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nflexibility  to  change  the  selection  criteria  with  approval  of  ADB  if \nmarket conditions warrant such a change. \n \nThe  maximum  exposure  per  borrower  will  be  up  to  the  aggregate \namount  of  P25  million.  This  translates  to  a  maximum  guaranteed \namount of P12.5 million per borrower.  \n \nThe maximum tenor is 3 years. \n \nDepending on the particular business strategy and focus of the PFI, \nthe facility will be used to \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\n \n  \n\nopen import letters of credit,  \nprovide short-term working capital loans,  \noffer bank guarantee facilities,  \nprovide trade finance loans to borrowers,  \nfinance equipment, \nfinance leases,  \nacquire goods and services, and  \nfor  the  provision  of  any  other  types  of  credits  as  agreed \nby the PFI and the guarantor. \n\n \nAll external advisory and expert fees, including legal fees, incurred in \nrelation to this facility will be paid by the PFI within 10 working days \nafter  receipt  of  such  invoice.  The  guarantor  will  engage  external \nexperts or advisers only with the prior written consent of the PFI and \non terms and conditions acceptable to the PFI, including the experts\u2019 \nor  advisers\u2019  scope  of  work, \nthe  agreed  rates,  and  billing \narrangements (such approval will not be unreasonably withheld). \n \n\n(i)  Upon ADB\u2019s confirmation that the first loss amount has been \nexceeded, the PFI writes a demand letter. This will allow the \nPFI to draw on the partial credit guarantee facility subject to \nthe following: \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA  specific  guaranteed  loan  in  the  PFI's  guaranteed  loan \nportfolio  has  been  called  back  by  the  PFI,  and  the  PFI  has \nnotified  the  guarantor  that  such  loan  amount  has  been \noutstanding or not fully recovered for a period exceeding 180 \ndays since the guaranteed loan was called back; or \n\nA borrower is declared bankrupt or insolvent and the PFI has \nnotified  the  guarantor  that  such  loan  amount  has  been \noutstanding or not fully recovered for a period exceeding 180 \ndays since such event; and \n\nThe  PFI  notifies \nthe  unrecovered, \nthe  guarantor  of \noutstanding  exposure  of  the  PFI  related  to  the  specific \nguaranteed  loan  as  of  the  date  when  the  loan  was  called \nback plus 180 days; \n\n\fAppendix 7         \n\n47\n\n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n\n \n(ix) \n\nThe PFI confirms that no event of default has occurred (see \nbelow for a definition);  \n\nThe  PFI  submits  to  the  guarantor  copies  of  all  legal \ndocumentation relating to the specific guaranteed loan; \n\nThe  PFI  requests  a  disbursement  under  the  partial  credit \nguarantee facility in an amount pro rata of the guarantor' risk \nsharing of the loss amount. \n\n(viii)  Once the Guarantor has paid his portion of the loss amount \nas notified by the PFI as of the date the loan has been called \nback plus 180 days, the payment obligation of the guarantor \nunder  the  partial  credit  guarantee  facility  in  respect  of  such \nrelevant guaranteed loan will be terminated. Notwithstanding \nthe  foregoing,  in  case  that  during  the  enforcement  process \nrecovered  amounts  are  not  sufficient  to  cover  taxes  paid, \nreasonable  out-of-pocket  legal  fees  and  expenses  incurred \nand actually paid by the PFI in connection with enforcement \nof  the  security  related  to  a  specific  loan,  the  guarantor  will \nproportionally participate in the payment of such taxes, fees, \nand expenses. \n\nAny obligation of the guarantor to pay under the partial credit \nguarantee  facility  agreement  in  connection  with  a  particular \nguaranteed  loan  will  terminate  12  months  after  the  final \nmaturity  of  such  loan  included  in  the  PFI's  guaranteed  loan \nportfolio. \n\n \nAny credit loss subsequently recovered by the PFI, including but not \nlimited  to,  proceeds  from  restructuring  of  the  guaranteed  loan  and \ncollateral recovery, will be applied to the credit loss amount on a pro \nrata basis between ADB and the PFI.  \n \nThe guarantor reserves the right at their sole discretion at all times \nto suspend and/or cancel the unused limit.

ADB, related industry associations and specific strategic investors will be invited \nto have an equity stake. The total project cost is estimated to be maximum $4 million. \n \n2. \nThe purpose of making CIB a private corporation majority owned by the BSP is to strike \na  balance  between  the  credibility  and  integrity  that  the  BSP  ownership  would  add  and  the \nnecessity  of  giving  CIB sufficient  flexibility  to  conduct  its  operation  in  an  efficient manner.  The \nBSP involvement will also ensure the comprehensive collection of data from the banking sector \nand  their  affiliates/subsidiaries.  Industry  associations  have  also  been  identified  as  possible \nowners  of  the  bureau  instead  of  individual  banks  or  other  lending  institutions  to  rule  out  the \npossible  conflicts  of  interest.  ADB,  on  the  other  hand,  will  provide  the  needed  international \ncredibility  and  stability.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  establishment  of  credit  bureaus  in  other \ncountries1 will also improve investor and user confidence in CIB\u2019s operations.  \n \nB. \n\nSupervision  \n \nThe Monetary Board2 will oversee the operation of CIB and promulgate the implementing \n3. \nrules  and  regulations  (IRR).  It  will  ensure  compliance  with  various  provisions  of  the  proposed \nCredit Information Systems Act (CISA) specifically covering the following: (i) restrictions on the \nuse  and  transfer  of  credit  information,  (ii)  rights  of  borrowers  to  access  their  respective  credit \ninformation and dispute the factual accuracy of the same, and (iii) sanctions to be imposed by \nCIB  on  submitting  entities  for  non  reporting,  delayed/  erroneous  reporting  and  on  accessing \nentities for breach of confidentiality, misuse of credit information.  \n\n \nOrganization Structure and Management \n\nC. \n \n4. \nCIB will have a board of directors and ADB will have the right to be represented. CIB will \nhire  a  chief  executive  officer  with  relevant  financial  sector  experience  who  will  run  the  day-to-\nday operations. The chief executive officer will be supported by a team of senior officers from \nthe private sector. \n \nD. \n \n\nBusiness Strategy \n\n1. \n\nCorporate Strategy and Scope of Operation \n\n \nCIB  is  intended  to  function  as  the  repository  of  all  relevant  credit  information  including \n5. \ntax  and  insurance  history  of  corporate,  individual,  and  microfinance  borrowers.  It  may  also \nproduce credit reports, containing detailed information on the credit history of the  individual or \n\n                                                 \n1   Under  TA  3829  (ADB.  2003.    Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  Strengthening  Business \nDevelopment  Services  for  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises.  Manila.),  ADB  provided  a  technical  assistance  to  the \nGovernment of Indonesia to conduct a feasibility study and prepare a business plan for the establishment of Credit \nInformation Bureau. \n\n2   The Monetary Board exercises the powers and functions of the BSP, such as the conduct of monetary policy and \nsupervision of the financial system.

This  requirement  for  banks,  their \naffiliates and subsidiaries to submit information, enforced by the BSP, will ensure the quality and \ncompleteness  of  the  CIB\u2019s  database.

CIB will also strengthen credit discipline of the borrowers. \n \n\n2. \n\nIndirectly  Improve  Credit  Access  and  Borrowing  Cost  of  Underserved \nMarket \n\n \nThe  availability  of  credit  information  and  debt  service  track  record  of  all  borrowers  will \n10. \nassist in shifting the existing credit appraisal focus on collateral. This is particularly the case for \nlower-tiered  borrowers  such  as  small  and  medium  enterprises  and  microfinance  entities.  The \nability to obtain consolidated and reliable information from one source also assists in reducing \nprocessing  time  and  costs  to  the  lenders,  which  will  in  turn  reduce  financing  cost  of  the \nborrower. \n\n \n3. \n\nCatalytic and Demonstration Effect  \n\n \n11. \nADB\u2019s  investment  is  perceived  as  helping  attract  private  sector  equity  investors  and \nemploy  professional  management.  This  is  particularly  beneficial  for  CIB  in  the  event  that  its \ninitial public offering plan moves forward. \n \nF. \n \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\nInsufficient Demand for CIB\u2019s Services \n\n1. \n \n12. \nThe success and profitability of CIB will depend on the level of utilization of the identified \naccessing entities. Factors affecting utilization include competition from other credit information \nproviders, bureau integrity and poor service quality. The presence of BSP as well as the ADB as \nequity investors augurs well in initially providing integrity to CIB. To raise credibility in the market \nand ensure service quality, it must employ competent management with sufficient experience in \nthis field.  \n \n\n2. \n\nData Integrity  \n\n \n13. \nIn a centralized credit information system, inaccurate and disparaging credit information \ncould result in devastating financial consequences for the person or institution involved.  In the \noriginal  scheme  contemplated,  the  basic  safeguard  is  the  right  of  borrowers  to  know  the \ninformation about them so that they will be able to protect themselves. Moreover, the Monetary \nBoard,  through  the  implementing  rules  and  regulations,  will  prescribe  administrative  sanctions \non accessing entities and other parties who breached the confidentiality of, or misuse, the data. \nThe  sanctions  contemplated  could  be  in  the  nature  of  fines  and/or  denial  of  access  to  the \nsystem.  As  the  bureau\u2019s  major  shareholder,  BSP  can  exercise  influence  within  the  board  and \nensure that the quality and accuracy of the information are being maintained. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n3. \n\nRegulatory and Supervision \n\n \n14. \nKey  to  CIB\u2019s  continued  viability  is  the  ability  to  collect  accurate  information  in  a  timely \nmanner.  BSP  will  be  relied  on,  given  its  ability  to  exercise  influence  over  the  banking  system, \nwhich  are  the  main  providers  of  information  to  the  bureau.  The  Monetary  Board  as  well  as \nbureau\u2019s  management  will  handle  credit  information  disputes  between  the  lenders  and \nborrowers,  maintain  privacy  of  borrowers,  and  ensure  compliance  with  provisions  approved \nunder the CISA.  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n55\n\nSUMMARY OF JFICT GRANT PROJECT \n \n\nI.

The  PBR  aims  to  reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business  and  improve  the  business  climate  in  the \nPhilippines, and it is comprises (i) a web-based business registration system to cover all legal business \nestablishments  under  different  authorities,  and  (ii)  a  service  tool  for  trade  and  business  development \nfacilitation.  \n \nThe project has three phases: (i) phase I: the various business databases of Department of Trade and \nIndustry (DTI) including those of the Board of Investments (BOI) will be upgraded and harmonized with \nthe  business  registration  system  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Commission;  (ii)  phase  II:  the  integrated \ndatabases  developed  under  phase  1  will  be  linked  to  the  Bureau  of  Internal  Revenue,  Social  Security \nSystem,  Philippine  Economic  Zone  Authority,  and  selected  local  government  units  (LGUs)  that  are \nprepared  for  the  e-government  initiative  through  a  registry  system,  providing  a  common  interagency \nreference and validation point; a PBR portal will be established; and (iii) phase III, entry points to other \nLGUs  and  e-ready  organizations  such  as  Department  of  Labor  and  Employment,  Philippine  Health \nInsurance  Corporation,  and  one-stop  business  centers  such  as  small  and  medium  enterprise  (SME) \ncenters will be increased. A business facilitation system will be developed as an integral complementary \nfunction of the PBR, and installed in SME centers and LGUs as the delivery channels in this phase.  \n \nThe  project  will  (i)  improve  governance  by  reducing  discretional  manual  processes  in  business \nregistration; (ii) enhance the efficiency of business registration procedures through interfacing DTI system \nwith  other  systems;  (iii)  improve  the  policymaking,  monitoring,  and  marketing  functions  of  the \nGovernment using  a knowledge management  tool  to  generate  various statistical  and  analytical  reports; \n(iv) promote business opportunities within domestic and international trade through a business facilitation \nplatform;  and  (v)  help  business  enterprises  lower  their  operational  costs  by  streamlining  submission  of \ninformation to various Government agencies and others. \n \nPBR  is  in  line  with  the  e-government  Initiatives,  which  will  apply  information  and  communication \ntechnology to various government projects to enhance the quality and efficiency of government services \nto  the  public  and  the  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan  2004\u20132010,  which  calls  for  efficient \ngovernment-to-business and government-to-government transactions. Moreover, it supports the 10-point \nagenda of President Arroyo on item 1, 5, and 7, namely job creation, developing digital infrastructure, and \ndeveloping Subic and Clark bases. \n \nThe project will help the Government implement phases I and III of the PBR development plan.  \n \nExpected Key Performance Indicators (maximum 5 indicators): \n(cid:131)  Number of business entities registered in the database \n(cid:131)  Time required for business registration \n(cid:131)  Number of users accessing PBR for business registration and business facilitation services \n(cid:131)  Success rate of business enterprises \n(cid:131)  Statistical and analytical reports for improved policymaking, monitoring, and marketing functions \n\nof Government  \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nA. \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national priority \nin country poverty analysis?  \n\n \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?  \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \nContribution  of  the  sector  or  subsector  to  reduce  poverty  in  the  Philippines:  The  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  poverty    reduction  strategy  recognizes  support  to  SMEs  as  a  key  aspect  of  fighting  poverty.  The  Philippines \npoverty  partnership  agreement  states  that  \u201cin  order  to  achieve  the  poverty  reduction  priorities  of  the  agreement  the \ngovernment  agrees  to  encourage  broad-based  growth  and  equitable  development,  credit  support  for  small  and \nmedium  enterprises  (SMEs)  will  be  extended  in  partnership  with  the  private  sector  and  civil  society  to  create  jobs, \nespecially in the rural areas, and to provide the basis for expanding the domestic market.\u201d For its part ADB agrees \u201cto \nsupport  Government  efforts  to  increase  the  efficiency  of  financial  markets  and  reform  industrial  policy  in  order  that \nresources may be allowed to flow towards the more competitive and productive sectors of the economy, particularly \nmicroenterprises, SMEs and rural enterprises.\u201d \nThe proposed project is in line with the poverty partnership agreement. \n \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention  \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nThe Project is designed to respond to the Government\u2019s SME Development Plan which targets SMEs specifically and \nSME development in turn is a key sector in meeting the trade and investment targets set in the Government\u2019s Medium \nTerm  Philippine  Development  Plan  2004\u20132010.  The  Project  is  a  growth  oriented  and    aimed  at  and  expected  to \ncontribute  to  an  improved  enabling  environment  for  SMEs,  increased  employment  opportunities,  generate  personal \nincome  and  tax  revenues  through  its  support  for  nationwide  business  development.  SMEs  are  expected  to  benefit \nfrom better access to finance and augmented availability of finance. The project preparatory assistance (PPTA) report \nprovided estimates of job creation based on previous lending. During 1994\u20131997 under the wholesale lending window \nP1 million lent generated 3.18 additional jobs, while under the retail window 1999\u20132003 P1 million lent generated 6.74 \nadditional jobs. Using that as a guide a static calculation points to at least 3,500 and 1,800 additional jobs under the \ntwo lending  windows. However, any estimates can only give indicative figures given the variety of SMEs in terms of \nlabor  intensity. The  expected  increase  in  jobs  represents  only  a  small  number  of  the  Government\u2019s  overall  target  of \ncreating at least 6 million jobs (including 3 million entrepreneurs) by 2010. However increased SME activity can also \nhave positive indirect effects on job creation. Thus the impact on poverty is through expected direct and indirect job \ncreation as a result of successful project implementation.  \n \n\nC.
