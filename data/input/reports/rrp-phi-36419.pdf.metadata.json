Compliance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nAssessment  environmental guidelines as applicable to financial intermediaries \nwill be required. \n   \nSocial Sector  Category C: Involuntary resettlement \nAssessment  Category C: Impact on indigenous people \n   \nProject   The Small and Medium Enterprise Development Support Project \nDescription  (SMEDSP)  is  an  integral  part  of  coordinated  support  of \ndevelopment partners to help the Government implement its SME \nDevelopment  Plan  2004\u20132010.  The  SMEDSP  and  associated \nprojects will (i) support policy initiatives to strengthen the enabling \nenvironment by simplifying registration and licensing processes, \nestablish a Philippine business registry, and develop a blueprint \nfor a movables collateral registry; (ii) help meet the funding gap for \nSMEs  by  providing  a  credit  line  to  SB  Corporation,  with  a \nGovernment guarantee, aimed at viable SMEs that currently do \nnot have access to bank financing, and a partial credit guarantee \n(PCG)  facility  without  Government  counter  guarantee  to \nencourage selected private sector financial institutions to expand \ntheir  SME  portfolio,  particularly  to  qualified  medium-size \nenterprises outside the target client group of SB Corporation; (iii) \nstrengthen  SB  Corporation\u2019s  credit  underwriting  and  risk \nmanagement;  and  (iv)  help  establish  a  comprehensive  and \ncredible credit information system through an equity investment in \nthe  planned  credit  information  bureau  (CIB).  The  SMEDSP  is \nprocessed in parallel with technical assistance (TA) Strengthening \nSME  Credit  Management  Systems  and  a  Japan  Fund  for \nInformation  and  Communication  Technology  (JFICT)  project \nDeveloping  the  Philippine  business  registry,  which  will  support \nitems (i) and (iii).  \n   \n  Rationale  In 2002, SMEs in the Philippines contributed 32% of value added, \nand accounted for 8% of business establishments and 31% of \nemployment.  SMEs\u2019  direct  contribution  to  total  manufacturing \nexports was approximately 24%, but the indirect contribution as \nsuppliers  to  large  exporters  is  likely  to  be  higher.  SMEs  thus \ncomprise a vital subsector in the economy in terms of employment \nand  value  added.  However,  effective  SME  operation  is \nconstrained by lack of supportive policies; cumbersome and costly \n ", "ii     \nregistration and licensing processes; lack of a national business \nregistry and collateral registry; and lack of comprehensive credit \ninformation, which hampers SME lending.  \n \nAccess  to  and  availability  of  finance,  another  key  constraint, \nreflects (i) banks\u2019 reluctance to expand SME lending following the \nAsian financial crisis (SME lending is perceived to be costly and \nrisky  in  relation  to  revenues  generated  compared  with  other \ninvestments) and lack of credible credit information; and (ii) SMEs\u2019 \ndifficulty preparing and presenting credible business plans and \nrealistic cash-flow estimates, and providing sufficient collateral for \nbank lending. The Government and development community have \nresponded  by  supporting  the  development  of  business \ndevelopment services (BDS) to help SMEs with business plans, \nfinancial management, marketing, and accounting. In 1991 the \nGovernment  set  up  SB  Corporation  to  provide  loans  and \nguarantees to SMEs, in particular those that are viable and either \nneed loans below banks\u2019 minimum limit or cannot meet banks\u2019 \nstringent collateral requirements.  \n \nIn July 2004, the Government presented the SME Development \nPlan 2004\u20132010 to improve the enabling environment for SMEs \nand thereby contribute to increased SME share in value added\u2014\nfrom 32% to 40% by 2010. President Arroyo\u2019s 10-point agenda \nand  the  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan  (MTPDP) \n2004\u20132010 also highlight SME support as central to creating at \nleast  6  million  jobs  by  2010.  The  MTPDP  includes  the \nestablishment of a credit bureau as one of the targeted activities \nto promote SME development. \n \nThe SME Development Plan includes a number of activities to \nimprove the enabling environment for SMEs, i.e., from registration \nand licensing to micro issues of providing BDS throughout the \ncountry, assisting SMEs with matching, market access information \nand even product design. The plan does not address the overall \npolicy and regulatory framework affecting enterprises, large and \nsmall,  such  as  financial  sector  issues,  taxation,  competition \nframework, corporate recovery and insolvency law, and need for \nmore developed infrastructure.  \n   \n  Impact and Outcome  The SMEDSP is to help the Government implement the SME \nDevelopment  Plan,  in  cooperation  with  other  development \npartners,  to  promote  SME  development  and  broad-based \neconomic growth. In President Arroyo\u2019s 10-point agenda and the \nMTPDP, the concrete target is to create at least 6 million jobs in 6 \nyears by promoting SMEs, tripling financing available, supporting \nentrepreneurs, and developing land for agricultural business. The \nSMEDSP and associated projects will support this objective by (i) \nimproving  the  enabling  environment  for  SMEs,  (ii)  stimulating \nSME  development  by  facilitating  access  to  finance  and \naugmenting  financial  resources  at  SB  Corporation,  and  (iii) \n ", "  iii\nexpanding  private  sector  lending  for  medium-size  enterprises \nsupported by a PCG. This combination of a public sector loan and \nprivate sector PCG allows for targeting of different segments of \nthe SME market and catalyzing expanded SME finance through a \ndemonstration effect. The SMEDSP will effectively complement \nefforts  by  other  development  partners  that  concentrate  on \nproviding BDS to SMEs nationwide, as well as efforts to support \npolicymaking  by  the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry.  The \nassociated  projects  will  support  targeted  SME  issues;  macro \npolicies are beyond the scope of this Project.  \n   \n  Cost Estimates   The total cost is estimated at $38.5 million equivalent.  \n    \n  Financing Plan  ADB  will  provide  a  credit  line  of  \u00a52,746,625,000  ($25  million \nequivalent)  to  SB  Corporation.  ADB\u2019s  proportion  of  SB \nCorporation funding for relending and onlending will not exceed \n65%, based on present funding sources. \n   \n  Loan Amount and  A  loan  of  \u00a52,746,625,000  ($25  million  equivalent)  with  the \n  Terms  guarantee of the Republic of the Philippines, from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a \n15-year term including a grace period of 36 months, an interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n \n   \n  Allocation, Relending,  SB Corporation will onlend the loan to SMEs in local currency. \n  and Onlending Terms  The Philippine Government will bear the exchange rate risk, and \nwill charge up to 5% per annum for the guarantee including the \nforeign exchange risk cover. However, the rate is still subject to \nreview  by  the  Department  of  Finance  (DOF),  which  will  issue \nrules to implement the foreign exchange risk cover and guarantee \npremiums payment structure once the review is completed. SB \nCorporation  will  use  the  loan  for  its  wholesale  lending  via \naccredited participating financial institutions (PFIs) and its retail \nlending. SB Corporation\u2019s wholesale lending products range in \nsize  from  P100,000  ($1,790)  to  P15,000,000  ($267,900)  with \nmaturities from 1\u20135 years. In the wholesale lending program, as of \n1 June 2005, SB Corporation was charging PFIs the following \nrelending rates: 7.2% up to 90 days, 7.5% 91\u2013181 days, 7.8% \n182\u2013270 days, 8.2% 271\u2013360 days, 9.2% 1\u20133 years, 9.7% 3\u20135 \nyears, and 10.2% 5\u20137 years. The PFIs add charges ranging from \n4\u20138% to cover their costs and reflect the perceived risk. The retail \nloans range from P200,000 ($3,670) to P5,000,000 ($89,200) with \nmaturities up to 5 years. The interest rates as of 1 June 2005 are \n9.5% for fully secured loans up to 1 year, 13.8% for 1\u20133 years, \nand  14.5%  for  3\u20135  years.  An  additional  charge  is  made  for \npartially secured loans, where at least 50% is secured, of 1% per \nannum, and 2% for less than 50% secured loans. SB Corporation \n ", "iv     \nwill create revolving funds from repaid subloans to make new \nloans  under  the  same  criteria.  Monthly  charges  to  PFIs  are \ncomputed based on 80% of MART 1 (Money Market Association \nof the Philippines) plus 0.1%, plus gross receipts tax (GRT) while \ninterest rates on retail loans are computed based on Sulong (SME \nUnified  Lending  Opportunities  for  National  Growth)rates \ndetermined by the government financial institutions. \n \nThe loan comprises two phases. The first $10 million equivalent \nwill be available for drawdown upon loan effectiveness by SB \nCorporation for relending to accredited PFIs under the wholesale \nlending window. Following a comprehensive review after about \n18 months to assess the loan\u2019s utilization and impact and the \noutcome  of  the  associated  technical  assistance  (TA)\u2014\nStrengthening  SME  Credit  Management  Systems,  another  $15 \nmillion  equivalent  will  be  available  for  drawdown.  Of  this  $15 \nmillion, $10 million equivalent will be for relending through PFIs, \nand  $5  million  equivalent  for  SB  Corporation\u2019s  retail  lending \nutilizing  enhanced  techniques  developed  under  the  associated \nTA .  \n \nPeriod of Utilization  The SMEDSP will be implemented over 5 years. The closing date \nfor  submission  of  drawdown  applications,  and  approval  and \nauthorization for disbursements from the loan, will be within 5 \nyears  of  the  date  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  closing  date  for \ndisbursements  will  be  6  months  after  the  closing  date  of \nwithdrawal application, approval, and authorization. \n \nEstimated Project  October 2010 \nCompletion Date   \n \nExecuting Agency   SB Corporation \n \nImplementation  SB Corporation will implement the SMEDSP. The Southeast Asia \nArrangements  Governance  Finance  and  Trade  Division  (SEGF)  of  ADB  will \nmonitor implementation. \n   \nProcurement   Provisions  of  ADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement  applicable  to \ndevelopment finance institutions will be followed. All procurement \nwill be made from ADB member countries. Subborrowers will be \nencouraged to procure goods through international competitive \nbidding  and/or  international  shopping  when  applicable. \nProcurement will be conducted transparently and in conformity \nwith the ADB anticorruption policy. \n \nPartial Credit Guarantee  ADB will provide a PCG to selected PFIs without Government \n  counterguarantee. The PCG will have an overall limit of P1 billion \n  (equivalent to $18.40 million at current exchange rates); the PFIs \n  will  cover  the  remaining  risk  of  P1  billion.  In  addition  to  the \n  proposed 50/50 risk-sharing scheme between ADB and the PFI, \n  ADB will negotiate a first-loss provision (based on the PFI\u2019s loss \n ", "  v\n  experience)  to  be  entirely  assumed  by  the  PFI.  Subject  to \n  approval  from  the  Director  General  of  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector \n  Operations  Department  (PSOD)  and  ADB\u2019s  Guarantee \n  Committee,  as  well  as  satisfactory  due  diligence  by \n  PSOD, primarily those local banks that are accredited in the ADB \nregional  Trade  Finance  Facilitation  Program  and  international \nbanks will be considered for inclusion in the PCG facility.  \n \nTerms   The  PFIs  will  pay  ADB  a  predetermined  fee,  which  will  be \nreviewed  at  least  annually.  The  fee  will  be  market-driven  and \ndetermined for each PFI based on the risks identified during the \ndue diligence process and the risk-sharing mechanism agreed to \nby ADB and the PFI. The PCG facility is expected to be extended \nto 2\u20135 banks for an aggregate exposure to ADB of up to P1 \nbillion. PCG sublimits per PFI are set at the peso equivalent of up \nto P500 million. The SME borrower of each PFI will have a PCG \nlimit of up to the peso equivalent of P12.5 million which means the \nmaximum  exposure  per  borrower  will  be  up  to  the  aggregate \namount of P25 million.  \n \nThe PCG facility will be available for 5 years. Since each loan \nguaranteed under the facility may have a maximum repayment \nterm of up to 3 years depending on its risk profile, the facility will \nhave a maximum tenor of up to 8 years.  \n \nEstimated              October 2013 \nCompletion   Date \n \nImplementation  The  ADB  PSOD,  in  close  collaboration  with  the  Office  of \nArrangements   Cofinancing Operations, will structure, process, and monitor the \nPCG facility. \n   \nEquity Investment in the  ADB will invest up to $1 million (not to exceed 25% of total project \nCredit Information  cost) in the CIB. The CIB is intended to function as the repository \nBureau (CIB)  of  all  relevant  credit  information  including  tax  and  insurance \nhistory of corporate, individual, SME, and microfinance borrowers. \nIt may also produce credit reports containing detailed information \non the credit history of the individual or corporation, and credit \nratings. \n \nThe  CIB  is  proposed  to  be  established  under  the  Credit \nInformation Systems Act, currently being discussed by Congress \nand  Senate.  The  Senate  Committee  on  Banks,  Financial \nInstitutions, and Currencies has reviewed and endorsed the draft \nbill. This legislation is expected to be passed in the second half of \n2005 and once approved, the CIB is expected to be established \nwithin eight months. The CIB will be established as a separate \nentity under the Corporation Code. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas \n(BSP), is expected to own up to 49% of the shares; 51% will be \nowned by private sector institutions, related industry associations, \nand strategic partners. \n ", "vi     \n \nImplementation  The ADB PSOD will coordinate, process, and monitor the equity \nArrangements  investment. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The SMEDSP, associated TA, and JFICT project are expected to \nBeneficiaries  contribute  to  an  improved  enabling  environment  for  SMEs,  a \n  stronger SB Corporation better equipped to expand its wholesale \n  and retail portfolio, expanded SME lending by SB Corporation and \nPFIs, and job creation by SMEs. SMEs are expected to benefit \nfrom the better business environment, improved access to, and \navailability of, finance.  \n \nData from SB Corporation\u2019s previous lending, calculations based \non  the  additionality  created  per  P1  million  of  lending  by  SB \nCorporation, suggest that at least 2,000 SMEs can be expected to \nborrow through the SMEDSP. This could translate into at least \n5,500 additional jobs created directly. Given the diversity of SMEs \nand  the  fact  that  they  differ  in  terms  of  labor  intensity  in \nproduction, more specific targets cannot be detailed. In addition, \nindirect  job  creation  may  result  among  suppliers  and  buyers. \nThese estimates of static effects indicate a small fraction of the \njob  creation  targeted  under  the  10-point  agenda,  but \ncomplementary government and development agency sponsored \nprograms targeting SMEs and microenterprises are expected to \ncontribute  to  job  creation  as  well  as  efforts  to  bring  informal \nentrepreneurs and enterprises into the formal sector. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  One  of  the  main  factors  affecting  SMEDSP  is  overall  the \nmacroeconomic  environment.  Current  projections  for  the \nPhilippines indicate an average 4.9% annual real gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  growth  for  2005\u20132009,  with  inflation  on  a \ndownward trend to about 4% and the budget deficit being reduced \nto about 1% of GDP by 2009. Adverse developments in the world \neconomy  could  dampen  growth  prospects  in  the  Philippines. \nConversely, stronger than projected growth in the world economy \ncould lead to higher growth.  \n \nThe main assumptions for the SMEDSP also carry some risks that \nare addressed by mitigating measures. The assumptions are (i) \nthe Government is strongly committed and has the capacity to \nimplement the SMEDSP as an integral part of a comprehensive \nsupport program for SME development; (ii) SB Corporation has \nsufficient capacity to absorb the ADB loan; (iii) SB Corporation\u2019s \ncredit expansion has no potential adverse impact on private sector \nbanks;  and  (iv)  private  sector  banks  have  the  capacity  to \neffectively utilize the resources, including the PCG.  \n   \nThe  Government  is  strongly  committed  to  supporting  SME \ndevelopment by implementing the SME Development Plan 2004\u2013\n2010, and President Arroyo\u2019s 10-point agenda as expanded in the \nMTPDP.  The  MTPDP  also  emphasizes  the  need  to  increase \n ", "  vii\ninvestment and trade, and recognizes that the high cost of doing \nbusiness must be reduced, and infrastructure must be modernized \nif growth and employment targets are to be realized. An action \nprogram to prioritize and implement the SME Development Plan is \ndeveloped  to  ensure  appropriate  sequencing  of  activities  and \nsecuring  budgetary  allocations  and/or  development  funding  for \nactivities. The SME Donor Working Group is an active forum for \ncollaboration to ensure that efforts are complementary. \n \nSB Corporation is expected to be able to channel funds effectively \nthrough accredited PFIs as these are experienced SME lenders \nwith a broad network of branches. The selection criteria used \nunder  the  accreditation  system  of  SB  Corporation  are  quite \nconservative  and  correspond  to  ADB  Guidelines  on  Financial \nIntermediary  Loans  for  selecting  PFIs.  SB  Corporation  has \ndeveloped  a  model  for  retail  lending,  and  has  a  proven  track \nrecord  of  SME  financing  operations  and  a  strong  pipeline  of \nprojects for both retail and wholesale funding. The associated TA \nwill  strengthen  SB  Corporation\u2019s  credit  underwriting  and  risk \nmanagement.  Upon  enactment  of  amendments  to  the  SME \nMagna Carta, Republic Act 6977, SB Corporation will have (i) \ndiscretion in its staffing and remuneration policies, (ii) a sovereign \nguarantee reinstated, and (iii) greater discretion over funding and \ninvestment decisions.  \n \nNo adverse effect on commercial bank lending is expected to \nresult from SB Corporation\u2019s loan expansion as the target groups \nare  not  adequately  served  by  commercial  banks.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan  to  the  Small  Business  Guarantee  and  Finance  Corporation  (SB  Corporation)  to  be \nguaranteed by the Republic of the Philippines; (ii) a proposed partial credit guarantee (PCG) to \nselected private sector financial institutions without a Government counterguarantee; and (iii) a \nproposed equity investment in the planned credit information bureau (CIB) for the Small and \nMedium Enterprise Development Support Project (SMEDSP).  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  The  SMEDSP  was  developed  in  response  to  a  Government  request  for  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) assistance in implementing the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) \nDevelopment Plan 2004\u20132010. The Government views SME development as central to poverty \nreduction efforts through generation of employment opportunities and development of a sound \nand broad-based private sector. An ADB project preparatory technical assistance (TA) analyzed \nthe Government\u2019s SME development policies and actions to date, issues and constraints facing \nSMEs, and the operational and financial status of SB Corporation.1 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  In 2002, SMEs in the Philippines contributed 32% of value added, and accounted for 8% \nof business establishments and 31% of employment. Shares of value added and sales by SMEs \nfollow an increasing trend, from 30% and 31% respectively in 1998, compared with 21% and \n22% in 1983, and 28% and 28% in 1993. The SMEs\u2019 direct contribution to total manufacturing \nexports was approximately 24%, but the indirect contribution as suppliers to large exporters is \nlikely to be higher. SME are thus a vital subsector in the economy.  \n \n4.  Small  enterprises  are  defined  as  those  with  asset  size  between  P3,000,000  and \nP15,000,000, while medium enterprises have assets between P15,000,000 and P100,000,000. \nBy definition based on number of employees, a small enterprise is one that employs 10\u201399 \npeople, while a medium enterprise employs 100\u2013199.2 In 2001, the total 825,000 registered \nbusiness establishments included 61,759 registered small and 2,923 medium enterprises; the \nvast majority were microenterprises. SMEs are found in practically all subsectors. However, \nmost (more than 78%) are concentrated within a fairly traditional range of product groups: food \nprocessing; garments; gifts, toys, and handicrafts; metal working; footwear and leather goods; \nwood and bamboo products; and building materials. In terms of geographic distribution, the \nNational Capital Region accounts for 24.4% of all SME establishments and 40% of employees.  \n \n5.  The importance of SMEs to the Philippine economy is reflected in the SME Magna \nCarta, or Republic Act 6977 enacted in 1991.3 The act summarizes the SME policy goals: to \nraise productivity, ensure access to modern technology and financing, and lower the costs of \ndoing business. The act also launched three major initiatives: (i) created the SME Development \nCouncil  as  the  primary  body  for  developing  the  SME  sector  through  policy  formulation, \ninterdepartmental coordination, and promotion of SME development programs; (ii) specified \nmandatory credit allocations by all banks to SMEs: 6% of lending to small enterprises and 2% to \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines to Improve SME Access to Finance. Manila \n2  Small and Medium Enterprises Development Council Resolution 1, 16 January 2003, and Bangko Sentral ng \nPilipinas Circular 376, 20 March 2003. \n3  Republic Act 6977 was enacted in 1991 and amended in 1997 by Republic Act 8289. \n ", "2     \nmedium enterprises; (iii) created the Government-owned financial institution SB Corporation to \nlend to SMEs nationwide at better terms than banks could offer, i.e., by offering smaller loans \nwith longer maturities based on more flexible collateral requirements. SB Corporation is under \nthe Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).  \n \n6.   In July 2004, President Arroyo announced a 10-point agenda of reforms for her 6-year \nterm. The first item is creation of at least 6 million jobs in 6 years through support for SME \ndevelopment by tripling credit available to SMEs, developing land for agricultural business, and \nstimulating entrepreneurship. The Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) 2004\u2013\n2010  includes  targets  for  SME  lending  and  provides  strategies  for  government  financial \ninstitutions (GFIs) involved in lending to SMEs. Executive Order 391 directs all government \nagencies to implement the MTPDP and submit quarterly scorecards to monitor progress. The \nGovernment also presented the SME Development Plan 2004\u20132010, a comprehensive sector \ndevelopment plan to be implemented by concerned Government agencies in partnership with \nthe private sector and development partners. The plan identifies eight strategies, each with \nspecific activities. The SME plan is the result of numerous inputs from DTI, Small and Medium \nEnterprise  Development  Council,  and  industry  associations  in  the  Philippines,  as  well  as \ndevelopment  assistance-funded  studies  and  TA. 4  With  implementation  of  the  plan,  the \nGovernment projects SME gross value added will increase to 40% of the total, and SME exports \nwill grow at 16% annually based on the gross domestic product (GDP) growth targets for 2004\u2013\n2010 developed by the National Economic Development Authority.  \n \n7.  The SME Development Plan identifies activities to improve the enabling environment for \nSMEs, such as improving registration and licensing processes, providing business development \nservices (BDS) throughout the country, assisting SMEs with matching, and developing market \naccess information and even product design. The plan does not address the overall policy and \nregulatory framework affecting SMEs, such as financial sector issues, taxation, competition \nframework, corporate recovery and insolvency law, labor market policies, and need for more \ninfrastructure development. Instead the plan focuses on tangible issues that will have a direct \nimpact on SME operations. An action program for implementing the SME Development Plan in \na sequenced and coordinated manner has been developed and was presented during SME \nweek in July 2005. Lead agencies and key people responsible for each activity have been \nidentified. The key people are tasked with bringing stakeholders together for each activity and \ndetermining  actions  needed,  sequencing  the  actions,  and  determining  resources  for \nimplementation. DTI has provided a general prioritization of activities based on sequencing and \nfund availability. The action program will have time-bound targets for the initiatives. Appendix 2 \nprovides a matrix of activities in the SME Development Plan, including designated lead agency \nby activity and how development partners\u2019 ongoing or planned activities match. The plan does \nnot capture all SME-related activities and projects supported by the development partners.  \n \n8.  While the Philippines financial sector weathered the Asian financial crises comparatively \nwell, the adverse effects on SMEs have been significant in terms of availability of and access to \nfinance. As of September 2004, banks had an estimated P3,914 billion of assets. Despite \nrelatively high levels of liquidity, rising levels of nonperforming loans and the deteriorating \nbusiness environment led to reduced lending by Philippine banks. Domestic credit to the private \nsector as percentage of GDP decreased from 62% in 1997 to 34% in 2003. Of total bank \n                                                 \n4  ADB.1999 Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for Strengthening Export Competitiveness. \nManila (TA 3045-PHI) and ADB. 2003 Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for the Project to \nImprove SME Access to Finance. Manila (TA 4070-PHI) are among the references. The Japan International \nCooperation Agency provided advisory TA to draft the SME Development Plan. \n ", "    3 \nlending by June 2004, 12.1% was to SMEs, a decline from 13% in 2002.5 By June 2004, loans \nto small enterprises accounted for 6.5% of gross loans and medium enterprises 5.2%. This is \nlower  than  in  other  comparable  countries  in  the  region.  In  Indonesia  the  share  of  small \nenterprise lending was 18% of gross loans in both 2002 and 2003, and given that Indonesia \ndefines a small enterprise as one with 5\u201320 employees, the difference is even sharper. The \n5.3% year-on-year decline in the commercial banks\u2019 aggregate loans and discounts from P983 \nbillion in 2002 to P931 billion in 2003 also indicates that banks channel funds to more liquid \nassets  such  as  short-term  interbank  loans  and  trading  account  securities  (i.e.,  short-term \ninvestment in government and corporate debt instruments), where credit risk perception is lower, \ninstead of meeting the credit demand from the corporate sector. Alternative formal sources of \nfunding are limited for SMEs. The equity market is relatively small and the corporate bond \nmarket is tiny;6 SMEs are not able to meet the requirements for tapping these markets. Venture \ncapital and lease financing are also limited. Small enterprises in particular tend to rely more on \ninformal sources of finance, which can be more costly and far less stable than a bank credit \nregarding interest and repayment terms.  \n \n9.  In  1999,  the  Government  responded  by  directing  two  GFIs,  SB  Corporation  and \nPhilEXIM (Philippine Export Import Credit Agency), to start direct lending to SMEs in their \nrespective target areas. Until then, SB Corporation had offered guarantees and loans to SMEs \nvia accredited financial institutions. SB Corporation\u2019s current mandate is to support viable SMEs \nthat cannot access bank finance because they cannot meet banks\u2019 stringent requirement for \ncollateral, for example. SB Corporation accepts a broader range of assets as collateral and at \nhigher value than banks, which tend to only accept titled prime real estate. SB Corporation is \nalso willing to lend to SMEs that have been in operation for a shorter time than the 3 years of \nprofitable operations normally required by banks. As the SMEs become more established SB \nCorporation plans to graduate them to become bank clients. Thus SB Corporation has a very \ndistinct mandate and target group. For direct lending, SB Corporation developed a system for \nevaluating applications at its five offices; applications that meet a set of criteria are sent to the \ncredit committee at the head office for decision. Using its own offices as well as DTI\u2019s regional \noffices and bureaus to disseminate information on both the wholesale lending, guarantees, and \nthe direct lending program, SB Corporation aims to reach SMEs nationwide.  \n \n10.  PhilEXIM\u2019s main line of business was export credit guarantees and export finance. Direct \nSME lending has been limited due to lack of funds and a shortage of staff experienced in SME \nlending. In October 2004, PhilEXIM\u2019s board decided to move away from direct lending to SMEs \nand instead focus on guarantees and insurance to importing and exporting enterprises in an \neffort to streamline operations and focus on core activities. \n \n11.  On 21 November 2002, the Monetary Board of the central bank, Bangko Sentral ng \nPilipinas (BSP), relaxed prudential regulations in order to broaden SME access to financing. \nThe ruling detailed in Circular No. 364 of 9 January 2003 reduced the risk weight of qualified \nSME and microfinance portfolios to 75% from 100%. Basel II7 due to come into effect in 2006, \nallows qualified retail portfolios to be risk-weighted at 75% as well.  \n \n                                                 \n5  The upward adjustment of the asset size ceiling of medium enterprises in 2001 from P60 million to P100 million \nmade it easier for commercial banks to directly comply with SME credit allocation.  \n6  Total market capitalization of the Philippine Stock Exchange was 62% of GDP in 2003 and corporate bonds \noutstanding amounted to 1.26% of GDP. \n7 Basel II is the new capital adequacy framework for banks developed by the Basel Committee on Banking \nSupervision due to come into effect 2006.  \n ", "4     \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  The Policy and Enabling Environment \n12.  A conducive policy environment is vital for SMEs to flourish, and contribute to economic \ngrowth and employment. That generally means clear, predictable, and simple rules regarding \nlicensing, registration, taxation, and collateral registration so that SMEs can start operations and \naccess  finance.  While the  SME  Magna  Carta  formed  the  framework  for  the  overall  policy \ndirection, SMEs still face a policy environment that is not adequately supportive. Major policy \nissues to improve the investment climate, such as revisions to the incentive system, competition \npolicies expanded to more sectors, and changes to the tax system are examined in the ADB \nreports  Improving  the  Investment  Climate  in  the  Philippines  and  the  draft  Private  Sector \nAssessment for the Philippines. The ADB Southeast Asia Regional Department is analyzing \noptions  to  address  some  of  these  measures  under  a  broader  private  sector  development \ninitiative. However, significant targeted policy measures also have a direct effect on the SME \nenabling environment.  \n \n13.  A  number  of  surveys  have  revealed  that  SMEs  perceive  registration  and  licensing \nprocedures to be cumbersome and costly with the process taking an average of 59 days and \nrequiring 11 procedures. Furthermore, they cite collateral problems as hindering access to \nfinance.8 Growth and export-oriented SMEs identify insufficient market knowledge and market \naccess as issues. The framework for registration and licensing is indeed complicated. Single \nproprietorships register with DTI, while partnerships and corporations register with the Securities \nand Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition, every enterprise needs to get a license from the \nlocal government unit (LGU); this must be renewed annually. Registration with DTI and SEC \nserve as name registration, while the LGU license in effect allows the company to become \noperational  as  the  license  indicates  that  the  company  satisfies  all  national  and  LGU \nrequirements to operate in its respective field. The LGUs thus have the most reliable data on \nactive  companies.  In  addition,  the  National  Internal  Revenue  Code  requires  all  business \nestablishments to register with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to comply with the firm\u2019s \nobligation to pay national income taxes, and act as a Government withholding tax agent. The \nSME Development Council has found that many SMEs register with DTI solely to register the \nbusiness name, long before they start operations, which some never do. The SME Development \nPlan (Activity 48) calls for streamlining and facilitating registration and licensing processes.  \n \n14.  Because of the variety of registering agencies and the separate licensing process, no \nsingle  comprehensive  national  business  registry  serves  as  (i)  name  registration  for  the \ncompany,  (ii)  BIR  registry,  (iii)  repository  of  LGU  licensed  enterprises,  (iv)  registry  where \nfinancial  institutions  can  verify  loan  applications  from  companies,  (v)  data  source  for  the \nNational Statistics Office, and (vi) database for DTI policymaking. To address this, the SME \nDevelopment Plan recommends development of the Philippine business registry (PBR) as one \nactivity.  Now  designed,  the  registry  is  ready  to  be  established.  Implementation  will  be \nundertaken in phases, starting with the agencies involved, i.e., BIR, DTI, SEC, and major LGUs \nthat have electronic systems and can interface with the other agencies. Over time, the registry \nwill be linked to other government agencies such as Department of Labor and Employment, \nNational  Statistics  Office,  and  Social  Security  System.  The  PBR  is  envisaged  to  provide \nelectronic registration and submission of licensing requests, which would simplify processes, \nlower costs, and enhance governance. Thus the basic requirements for SME registration and \n                                                 \n8  Project preparatory technical assistance survey. World Bank. 2004. Doing Business 2005. Washington, DC: World \nBank.  \n ", "    5 \nlicensing regardless of location, and the design of standardized forms will have to be developed \nand implemented to make the PBR a truly national registry.  \n \n15.  DTI has established SME centers around the country; 10 are fully operational. They \ndisseminate  information  on  government  programs  on  financing  and  market  linkages,  and \nprovide advisory services on facilitation, linking, and networking. About 60 full-time DTI business \ncounselors provide consulting and advisory services in DTI regional offices and SME centers. \nThe Philippine Trade and Training Center accredits individuals who successfully complete its \nbusiness  management  systems  course  as  business  counselors.  The  Financial  Executives \nInstitute of the Philippines and the Management Association of the Philippines are expected to \ncomplement  the  pool  of  DTI  business  counselors  by  offering  volunteers  from  among  its \nmembers as business counselors to SMEs. The Japan International Cooperation Agency plans \nto extend assistance to strengthen DTI counselor services. Thus significant human resources \nare  available  in  DTI  centers  to  assist  SMEs  with  a  range  of  issues.  Adding  services  for \nregistration and licensing should be the logical extension from counseling. In the longer term, \nthe DTI SME centers could be one-stop shops for SME registration and licensing. For a fee, the \ncenters could process papers and ensure the company is duly registered in the national system. \n \n2.  Access to and Availability of Finance  \n \n16.  In focus group discussions for the recent national survey on SMEs by the Employers \nConfederation of the Philippines and the International Labour Organization as well as a survey \nunder the project preparatory TA, business owners and BDS providers described access to \nfinancing  as  the  most  pressing  constraint  facing  SMEs.  Access  to  commercial  banks  is \nparticularly limited for small firms, which are able to source only 5\u20137% of their financing needs \nfrom banks. Most SME entrepreneurs rely on family, friends, business partners, and informal \nfinancing sources. In a survey of SMEs that have not accessed bank financing, inability to meet \ncollateral requirements was the top constraint. While 92% of the 62 banks surveyed under the \nproject preparatory TA offered short-term working capital facilities to SMEs, only 53% offered \nfixed asset financing instruments. Access to trade and supplier financing is also limited.9 \n \n17.  Banks perceive SMEs as riskier than larger firms due to their low capital base, limited \nproduct lines leading to greater vulnerability to business cycle fluctuations, and vulnerability to \ndeterioration in receivables collections or loss of a key officer, among others. SMEs are also \nperceived to have weak financial discipline, with business funds often mixed with the owners\u2019 \npersonal funds; and generally to have weak accounting systems. SMEs rarely use banks to \nmanage their payroll or for working accounts, and the bank-client relationship tends to be \nweaker than for medium to large companies. For the banks, each SME transaction is therefore \ncostly, as it generally requires more staff resources in relation to the revenue that the loan \ngenerates compared with lending to larger firms with which the bank has a solid bank-client \nrelationship. One remedy has been for banks to only accept titled real estate as collateral, \ngenerally value it at 60% of appraised value, and set the loan floor at P1 million ($17,860), thus \nconcentrating their SME lending to a certain market segment.  \n \n18.  Seventy  percent  of  SME  lending  is  collateral  based,  but  many  SMEs  either  have \ninsufficient collateral or cannot have it properly registered because of the lack of a movable \ncollateral  registry.  Banks  must  undertake  their  own  assessments  of  the  ownership  of  the \nmovable collateral, which makes the process longer and more costly. The lack of a movable \n                                                 \n9  Forty-three percent of respondent banks of ACER survey offer receivable financing and 25% offer letter of credit \nfinancing. However, SME utilization of these facilities was low.    \n ", "6     \ncollateral registry system hampers all lending and private sector development. The Government \nrecognizes that creation of a movable collateral registry is important for long-term SME growth.  \n \n19.  The  Philippines  does  not  have  a  comprehensive  credit  bureau  because  of  legal \nimpediments to reporting credit information. This has led to inaccurate credit assessments and \nhigher risk for lenders. Meanwhile, borrowers face long credit application processes, higher \ninterest  rates,  and  credit  rationing.  The  proposed  Credit  Information  Systems  Act  (CISA), \ncurrently  being  discussed  in  Congress  and  Senate,  aims  to  address  the  lack  of  credit \ninformation. The CISA will have a central credit bureau at its core (due to be established by the \nend of 2005) and will govern the interplay of information between providers and subscribers. \nBSP will play a critical role as the largest shareholder and supervisor. BSP involvement will \nprovide the necessary credibility as well as ensure comprehensive collection of banking data.  \n \n20.  SMEs have difficulty preparing audited financial statements, and business plans with \nsales and revenue projections that meet bank requirements. Because of difficulty accessing \nformal finance, new SMEs tend to rely on their own or relatives\u2019 funds, and expensive informal \nfinance.  DTI  recognizes  this  and  offers  counseling  and  some  assistance  through  its  SME \ncenters; a number of development agencies are providing BDS to SMEs throughout the country. \nThe  BDS  include  preparation  of  business  plans,  financial  management,  marketing,  and \naccounting, which in turn will ensure that SMEs can present proper business plans to banks on \nwhich to base a cash-flow analysis that can substitute for or complement collateral for lending. \nIn addition to the SME centers, in 2002 DTI introduced SME caravans to extend the reach to the \nprovinces. Each caravan, with 4\u20135 experts in areas such as marketing, trade, finance, and \ntechnology, provides advisory services and conducts business clinics. In 2002, five caravans \nvisited five provinces; in 2003, 36 caravans visited 29 provinces. In most cases, SMEs are not \ncharged for these DTI services. Usually, only the administrative costs incurred for organizing \nseminars/workshops  under  the  SME  caravans  are  borne  by  the  participants.  For  further \nconsultation, however, SMEs pay full service fees to BDS providers. According to a 2003 \nsurvey, conducted jointly by the Employers Confederation of the Philippines and International \nLabour Organization, of 1,000 SMEs nationwide, 80% of those who utilized the DTI services \nfound them effective.  \n \n21.  SB Corporation is mandated to be the national leader in small enterprise finance, not in \nvolume but in innovative products and outreach, thereby achieving a demonstration effect. SB \nCorporation targets underserved SMEs that are viable but cannot access bank finance and \ntypically need smaller loans than most banks normally offer. Under the wholesale lending \nprogram or rediscounting facility, SB Corporation accredits financial institutions nationwide and \nthen provides credit for SME lending through these accredited banks, thereby providing SMEs \nwider access to short- and medium-term financing. The SB Corporation funding provides the \naccredited banks with a wider array of SME loan products to offer their clients. A key advantage \nof SB Corporation products is that the pass-on rate from SB Corporation is fixed and the conduit \nbank can therefore offer fixed terms to their clients as opposed to revising interest rates each \nmonth. Another advantage is the longer term products that SB Corporation offers with terms up \nto 7 years. Since 1994, SB Corporation disbursed (as of December 2003) P8.53 billion ($152 \nmillion) benefiting 5,158 SMEs.  \n \n22.  SB  Corporation  started  retail  lending  operations  in  1999  when  the  private  financial \ninstitutions slowed their lending to SMEs. Direct loans disbursed to 1,207 SMEs from 1999 to \nDecember 2003 aggregated P1.4 billion ($25 million). Retail lending is coursed through SB \nCorporation\u2019s five offices, where account officers review the applications and make an initial \nassessment of whether the applicant meets the basic borrowing requirements, and if so and a \n ", "    7 \nsite visit is favorable, then the application is sent to the credit committee at head office in Manila \nfor approval. The SMEs targeted in the direct lending are those that are viable, but need small \nloans, have a short track record and insufficient collateral to meet banks\u2019 normal requirements. \nThe development aspect of SB Corporation is to support these viable SMEs with a view to move \nthem to bank financing after 3\u20135 years. SB Corporation also has a guarantee program offering \nparticipating  banks  guarantees  on  their  SME  loans,  thereby  allowing  expansion  of  SME \nportfolios. Total guarantees issued amount to P8.66 billion for 4,675 accounts. Even though SB \nCorporation is a GFI it does not have a sovereign guarantee, and this in combination with a \nprocessing cycle that is perceived by participating banks as long and cumbersome are cited as \nthe main reasons for banks limited interest in applying for SB Corporation\u2019s guarantee program. \nDetails about SB Corporation are in Appendix 3.  \n \n23.  Recognizing  the  comparatively  low  levels  of  SME  lending  and  the  cumbersome \nprocedures surrounding it, the Government launched the SME Unified Lending Opportunities for \nNational Growth (SULONG) program in 2003. The aim was to facilitate SME financing by \nsimplifying and standardizing GFI lending procedures, including those of SB Corporation, to \nmake loan processing swifter. SME centers and DTI provincial offices disseminate information \nto help SMEs tap the SULONG program. Small business counselors and technical staff facilitate \nSME access the SULONG program by helping them fill out loan application forms, generating \ndocuments required, and following up on the status of loan processing with SB Corporation. \nInitially interest rates were fixed for different types of maturity loans making the SULONG a \nsuboptimal  lending  product  for  the  GFIs.  Therefore  the  SULONG  committee  requested  in \nSeptember 2004 that the cap be lifted allowing the GFIs to differentiate market-based rates \naccording to the client and type of loan. In October 2004 a decision was made to move to \nformula-based interest rates reflecting funding costs and credit risks.  \n \n24.  During  preliminary  discussions  of  the  ADB  Private  Sector  Operations  Department \n(PSOD) with six local and international commercial banks, the banks expressed interest in \nexpanding their SME lending portfolios beyond the legally mandated 8%. The renewed interest \nof domestic banks in the SME market results from increased competition and tight margins in \nthe large borrower segment, as well as BSP regulatory incentives to encourage lending to \nSMEs. However, domestic banks cite capital constraints and insufficient SME collateral as the \nmain constraints to profitable expansion of their SME portfolio. An increased level of lending to \nSMEs  would  require  increased  capital,  but  problems  with  nonperforming  assets  limit  their \noptions. BSP encourages banks to remove nonperforming assets to free up resources for \nlending and strengthen the banking system at large. Removing these assets, however, by sale \nto an asset management company is normally done at significantly discounted face value. This \nmeans that banks have to realize losses that in turn require more capital to meet the capital \nadequacy ratio requirement. Hence, banks that cannot raise sufficient capital may opt to reduce \nSME  lending  and  continue  to  invest  in  less  risky  assets,  and  only  slowly  deal  with  the \nnonperforming assets.  \n \n25.  Local and international commercial banks tend to rely on collateral for SME lending, and \ntypically only titled real estate. Some SMEs lack this, and even though their revenues may be \nsubstantial (such as medium-size call centers) they have difficulty accessing finance based on \ncash flow alone. International banks would also like to diversify their loan portfolios to improve \ntheir  risk  profile  and  broaden  their  sources  of  revenue.  They  are  therefore  interested  in \nexpanding to the SME market. Among the options they are considering is a channel financing \nstructure  that  puts  more  emphasis  on  cash  flow  than  collateral.  This  structure  identifies \nmultinational company clients of the bank and the dealers with payables to the multinational \ncompany. The international bank will lend the dealer an amount equal to the amount in the \n ", "8     \nmultinational company\u2019s invoice. The dealer then sells to the final consumer and upon payment \nrepays the international bank. This type of structure can be expanded to the SME market \nprovided the bank can share the risk.  \n \n  3.  External Assistance \n26.   ADB, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and World Bank have shifted their focus \nfrom loans to the industry sector in general to SME and microenterprise finance and support. \nADB,  International  Finance  Corporation,  and  Netherlands  Development  Corporation,  have \nequity in Planters Development Bank, the leading thrift bank active in SME lending. Deutsche \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) has been providing TA for SMEs, primarily \nchanneled via DTI, specifically targeting the Visayas region and focusing on BDS and capacity \nbuilding. The Japan International Cooperation Agency provided assistance to DTI to formulate \nthe SME Development Plan 2004\u20132010 and sponsor a resident SME policy adviser to DTI. The \nCanadian  International  Development  Agency  has  been  providing  TA  for  private  enterprise \ndevelopment since the early 1990s, working directly with industry associations. Kredistanstalt \nf\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW)  is  planning  to  provide  a  credit  line  to  SB  Corporation  in  2005, \nspecifically targeting the Visayas to complement GTZ efforts in that region. ADB is part of the \nSME  Donor  Working  Group,  which  meets  regularly  to  coordinate  ongoing  and  planned \nassistance, and ensure complementary assistance and collaboration. Major external assistance \nis described in more detail in Appendix 4. \n4.  Lessons Learned \n \n27.  ADB  draft  guidelines  for  SME  projects,  developed  in  2004,  draw  upon  previous \nexperience with SME projects. The main recommendations include the following: \n \n  (i)  ADB  public  and  private  sector  operations  need  to  work  more  closely  to \ncomplement each other. \n  (ii)  Public  sector  operations  should  primarily  focus  on  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment  including  regulatory,  business  registration,  governance,  stronger \nfinancial  sector,  and  building  of  appropriate  institutions  and  capacity  of  the \nfinancial sector. \n  (iii)  Future SME operations should use a cluster approach or interlinked projects. A \nproject should not try to address all possible issues. Rather, it should be viewed \nas  a  building  block  to  develop  a  business  environment  conducive  for  SME \ndevelopment. \n(iv)  SME operations must be closely coordinated with other external aid agencies \nand, where possible, activities linked with other aid agency support in the sector.  \n \n28.  In 1996, the World Bank undertook a detailed empirical analysis of its SME support over \n20 years in three countries (Ecuador, Philippines, and Sri Lanka).10 The study concluded that \ncredit lines for term financing need to be designed carefully to achieve expected outcomes. Key \nlessons  include  the  need  to  ensure  realistic  expectations  and  projections  of  job  creation, \ndevelop SME credit underwriting skills, and focus on improving the policy environment to ensure \naccess to financing.  \n \n29.  The  SMEDSP  and  associated  projects  are  designed  to  take  lessons  learned  into \nconsideration given that they are joint public-private sector operations. The SMEDSP includes a \n                                                 \n10  World Bank. 1998. Support for Smaller Enterprises. Precis No. 173.

The Project involves close coordination with other development partners active \nin the SME sector whose activities are complementary.  \n \n5.  Asian Development Bank Country and Sector Strategy \n30.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) update 2004\u20132006 for the Philippines11 is \naligned  with  the  Government\u2019s  MTPDP  2001\u20132004;  the  focus  is  poverty  reduction.  SME \ndevelopment is identified as promoting sustainable growth and generating employment, while \npromoting private sector development. The CSP update stresses public-private partnerships for \nsustainable SME development. The CSP 2005\u2013200712 closely reflects the priorities in the new \nMTPDP 2004\u20132010, which takes the 10\u2013point agenda as a starting point and emphasizes \nsupporting entrepreneurs and SMEs in the effort to create new jobs and to promote broad-\nbased growth. The CSP also stresses the need to consider the fiscal situation and carefully \ntarget  and  structure  investment  loans  via  GFIs  to  have  minimum  budgetary  impact,  while \nensuring that the financial position and performance of the GFI is strengthened during a project.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n31.  The overall goal of the SMEDSP and associated projects is to help the Government \nimplement  its  SME  Development  Plan  2004\u20132010  in  cooperation  with  other  development \npartners, and by supporting SME development to contribute to broad-based economic growth to \ngenerate employment opportunities. In President Arroyo\u2019s 10-point agenda and the MTPDP, the \nconcrete target is to create at least 6 million jobs in 6 years through, among other things, \npromoting SMEs by tripling financing available, supporting entrepreneurs, and developing land \nfor agricultural business. The SMEDSP and associated projects supports this objective by \nimproving the enabling environment for SMEs; stimulating SME development by facilitating \naccess to finance and augmenting financial resources at SB Corporation; and expanding private \nsector lending for medium enterprises supported by a PCG. This combination of a public sector \nloan and private sector PCG allows for targeting of different segments of the SME market and \ncatalyzing expanded SME finance through a demonstration effect. The associated TA13 will \nenhance SB Corporation\u2019s capacity and performance in supporting SME development. The \nSMEDSP  will  effectively  complement  efforts  by  other  development  partners  that  mostly \nconcentrate on providing BDS to SMEs nationwide, as well as efforts to support policymaking by \nDTI. \n \nB.  Outputs \n  \n1.  Credit Line to SB Corporation for Onlending to SMEs \n32.  Private sector financial institutions will be responsible for the bulk of the credit expansion \nenvisioned in President Arroyo\u2019s 10-point agenda. GFIs, specifically SB Corporation, should \nplay a catalytic role in making this happen. SB Corporation will continue to extend loans to \nSMEs underserved by banks because of insufficient collateral or credit history, but that are \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2004 Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006): Philippines.

As they acquire sound credit \nrecords through the retail or wholesale program, these SMEs will be able to access bank \nservices\u2014the target for this is 3\u20135 years. SB Corporation\u2019s lending is expected to provide a \ndemonstration effect and thereby be catalytic. The lending targets for SB Corporation and other \nGFIs  active  in  supporting  micro  and  SMEs  are  detailed  in  the  MTPDP  and  monitored  by \nquarterly scorecards. Concurrently, amendments to the SME Magna Carta have been submitted \nto Congress for passage.14 The proposed amendments will, among other things, (i) allow SB \nCorporation  discretion  in  staffing  and  remuneration  policies,  (ii)  reinstate  the  sovereign \nguarantee, and (iii) provide greater discretion in funding and investment.  \n \n33.  With the appreciation that viable SMEs are experiencing an immediate funding gap, the \nSMEDSP will provide a credit line of $25 million equivalent in two phases to augment SB \nCorporation\u2019s  funds  for  onlending  to  SMEs  either  indirectly  (i.e.,  through  its  wholesale \noperations) or directly (i.e., through its retail operations): $20 million equivalent is expected to be \nmade available for SB Corporation\u2019s wholesale operation and $5 million equivalent for its retail \noperation. In both cases, the aim is to support SB Corporation\u2019s strategy of targeting viable \nSMEs  that  satisfy  SB  Corporation\u2019s  lending  criteria,  which  are  more  lenient  than  those  of \ncommercial banks. Smaller and export-oriented SMEs with good business prospects will be \ntargeted. While the Project has no geographic limitations, lending to SMEs in Mindanao will be \nencouraged. In parallel, KfW will extend a loan to SB Corporation in coordination with the \nSMEDSP for onlending to micro and small enterprises in the Visayas region through selected \nbanks accredited with SB Corporation.  \n \n34.  Upon loan effectiveness, $10 million equivalent of SMEDSP loan will be made available \nfor drawdown, to be used to augment SB Corporation\u2019s wholesale lending. The second amount \nof $15 million equivalent will be made available for drawdown following a comprehensive review \nto be undertaken about 18 months after the first withdrawal, and subject to (ii) 70% drawdown of \nthe first $10 million equivalent and outstanding in SME loans, and (iii)  the credit scoring model \nand  new  credit  underwriting  and  risk  management  reporting  formats  developed  under  the \nassociated TA being introduced (footnote13).  \n \n2.  Partial Credit Guarantee to Selected Commercial Banks to Expand SME \nPortfolios \n \n35.  To encourage lending to medium-size enterprises falling outside of the scope of SB \nCorporation, a PCG facility of P1 billion (currently equivalent to $18.40 million) will be offered to \nselected participating financial institutions (PFIs) without a Government counter guarantee. The \nPCG facility will guarantee up to 50% of well-defined SME loan portfolios. The tentative size of \nthe PCG facility is P1 billion, which translates to an aggregate guaranteed portfolio size of P2 \nbillion. The PCG facility is expected to be extended to 2\u20135 banks with a sublimit of up to P500 \nmillion per bank.  \n \n36.  The SME borrower of each PFI will have a PCG limit of up to P12.5 million, which means \nthat the maximum exposure per borrower will be up to an aggregate amount of P25 million. To \nfurther mitigate risk, ADB will negotiate a risk-sharing structure with the PFIs, which will take \nplace on two levels. First, a first loss limit over the entire guaranteed portfolio will be defined that \nwill be fully absorbed by the PFI. The first loss will be based on the historic loss experience of \nthe PFI. Second, any loss in excess of the first loss will be shared with the PFI at an agreed \nrate, up to 50%. PSOD will coordinate, process, and monitor the PCG facility. Details of the \n                                                 \n14  Passage of the draft amendments to the SME Magna Carta is expected by the end of 2005.  \n ", "    11 \nPCG facility for private sector PFIs are in Appendix 6. The summary of the Indicative Terms and \nConditions of the Guarantee Agreement can be found in Appendix 7. \n \n37.  The PFI selection process for the PCG will be linked to the regional Trade Finance \nFacilitation Program approved by ADB in late 2003 and currently under implementation in the \nPhilippines as well as in other developing member countries. The initial due diligence by the \nprogram team will be utilized with additional evaluation on the underwriting process specifically \nof SME borrowers. Hence, primarily those Philippine banks that are accredited institutions in the \nTrade Finance Facilitation Program15 will be initially targeted under the facility to gain first-hand \nexperience in its dealings with these domestic banks. The PFI list can also be extended to \nADB\u2019s investee bank, Planters Development Bank, where ADB has prior credit experience and \ndealings. International banks, with a strong position in the SME sector in other countries and/or \nthe willingness to enter the SME market in the Philippines, will also be considered.  \n \n38.  Subsequent to Board approval, PSOD will undertake the final identification of the PFIs. \nPSOD will work closely with Office of Cofinancing Operations (OCO) and the Southeast Asia \nDepartment (SERD) to determine terms and conditions for the PCG facility. The final structure \nof the facility will be finalized through a PCG agreement between each PFI and ADB subject to \napproval from the Director General of PSOD and ADB\u2019s Guarantee Committee. The agreement \nwill include ADB\u2019s recommended underwriting criteria for the selection of SMEs. This will look \ninto the creditworthiness of the individual SME, including its financial performance and business \nplan.  The  shareholder  structure  and  SME  management  will  be  evaluated,  specifically  with \nrespect to reputation and financial resources. A sample list of SME underwriting criteria is in \nAppendix 8. The terms and condition of the PCG facility agreement may be different for each \nPFI depending on the participating bank\u2019s SME underwriting capability, SME experience, and \nnature  of  the  existing  SME  portfolio.  To  gain  experience  in  SME  portfolio  evaluation  and \nmonitoring, ADB intends to initially launch the PCG facility with 2\u20133 local and international banks \nexperienced in SME lending. In the case of international banks, their experience with SME \nlending in other countries will most likely be replicated in the Philippines.  \n \n39.  The PFIs will use the PCG facility to improve their capital efficiency ratio and to diversify \ntheir loan portfolio thus increasing their willingness and capacity to lend to the SME sector. \nADB\u2019s guarantee on the loan attracts a 0% risk weighting and therefore allows the PFI to \nincrease its lending capacity without necessitating an increase in capital, nor exceeding its \nexposure limits or breaching prudent underwriting criteria.  \n \n40.  The PCG is not intended to crowd out the guarantee operation of SB Corporation. While \nthe ADB guarantee targets medium-size companies, SB Corporation\u2019s guarantee is for smaller \ncompanies and PhilEXIM\u2019s guarantee program is only available to importers and exporters. The \nPCG facility aims to meet the needs of the underserved middle market, which are beyond the \nscope of operations of SB Corporation and PhilEXIM. These borrowers can be underserved, for \ninstance, due to their need for a higher loanable amount or larger number of employees (i.e., \nmore than 200 but still not acceptable to banks). The definition of medium-size enterprise may \nbe different for each PFI, particularly for international banks, although measures will be taken to \nensure that the benefit of the guarantee falls to a new market previously underserved by the PFI. \nADB\u2019s PCG facility provides an alternative guarantee facility for private sector banks facing \n                                                 \n15  Allied Bank, Asia Trust Bank, Banco de Oro, Bank of the Philippine Islands, China Bank, Equitable-PCI Bank, \nLand  Bank,  Metro  Bank,  Philippine  Bank  of  communications,  Prudential  Bank,  Rizal  Commercial    Banking \nCorporation, Security Bank, and Union Bank.  \n ", "12    \nconstraints in the structure or requirements of SB Corporation, such as (i) the nonsovereign \nstatus of SB Corporation\u2019s guarantee, and (ii) long application processing time.  \n \n41.  Measurement of the number of additional SME loans provided by the PFIs because of \nthe PCG facility will be based on each PFI and SME. As part of the PCG agreement, ADB will \nrequire  regular  reports  indicating  the  borrowers  included  in  the  guaranteed  loan  portfolio, \nincrease in the PFI\u2019s credit facilities, and disbursement for each SME borrower resulting from \nestablishment of the PCG facility. Upon initiation and annually thereafter, ADB can ask the PFI \nto submit a copy of the credit review of each SME borrower included in the guaranteed portfolio. \nAs well as providing ADB with information on the available credit facilities and the amount \nactually borrowed from all the banks, this will indicate the increased assistance provided to each \nSME due to the establishment of the PCG facility. \n \n3.  Equity Investment in the Credit Information Bureau \n \n42.  The proposed equity investment in the CIB is up to $1 million, not to exceed 25% of the \ntotal project cost initially estimated at $4 million. The CIB will be established as a corporate \nentity under the Corporation Code with BSP owning up to 49% in the company. Besides ADB, \nprivate sector institutions, related industry associations, and strategic partners are invited to \nhave an equity stake.  \n \n43.  The  main  CIB  product  will  be  consolidated  credit  information.  The  CIB  will  collect \nrelevant credit-related information in connection with a borrowers\u2019 application for and availment \nof a credit facility from banks, their affiliates and subsidiaries, and other credit providers. Access \nto the CIB will be provided to the submitting entities as well as special accessing entities, which \nmay be other private credit bureaus and private credit-rating agencies. Confidential information \nunder the Bank Secrecy Law, Foreign Currency Deposit Act, and General Banking Law will not \nbe included.  \n \n44.  Establishment of the CIB will be supported by the proposed CISA (para. 19). The CISA \nstipulates  that  any  company  established  under  the  act  will  be  authorized  to  collect \ncomprehensive credit information on any type of borrower and to release credit information, \ncredit reports, and credit ratings to accessing entities, such as domestic banks, other credit \nproviders, and any other lender in the country. Each borrower will have access to his/her credit \ninformation and will have the right to dispute any inaccuracy. \n \n45.  The CIB is intended to improve sharing and dissemination of information through a credit \ninformation system that will result in the following: (i) ability of lenders to more accurately identify \ngood borrowers; (ii) creation of a better risk management process; (iii) increase in volume of \nlending; (iv) extension of credit to underserved sectors such as micro, small, and medium \nenterprises; and (v) strengthening of credit discipline leading to the overall lowering of default \nrates. Details of the proposed equity investment are in Appendix 9. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n46.   First, the SMEDSP is a combination of public and private sector modalities to ensure \nthat different segments of SMEs are reached. The smaller and newer SMEs will be targeted \nthrough the credit line to SB Corporation. Larger SMEs that have limited access to bank finance \nwill be targeted under the PCG. The two financing facilities effectively complement each other.  \n \n ", "    13 \n47.   Second,  the  credit  line  will  be  released  in  phases  with  a  holistic  approach  to  SB \nCorporation\u2019s operations aimed at improving financial performance and expanding lending in \nsupport of the SME Development Plan. Therefore, during the first phase the wholesale lending \nprogram will be supported, and during the second phase, retail lending will be supported as \nwell. The retail lending will make use of the results of the associated TA (footnote 13) aiming at \nintroducing enhanced credit evaluation, underwriting, and risk management practices. Thus \nsuccess  in  the  first  phase  of  the  SMEDSP  will  pave  the  way  for  the  second  phase.  SB \nCorporation aims to graduate borrowers to become clients of private sector financial institutions. \nIn  this  context,  SB  Corporation\u2019s  relatively  small  size  is  appropriate  as  it  plays  a  limited, \ncomplementary role to the private sector by focusing on an underserved and important group of \nSMEs. Because of this, the ADB credit line is expected to (i) demonstrate that SME lending \nbased on alternative collateral and cash flows is profitable, (ii) contribute to sustainable SME \nfinancing in the targeted market, and (iii) expand the future client base of private sector banks \nby identifying and nurturing viable SMEs. \n \n48.  Third,  the  SMEDSP  was  processed  in  conjunction  with  TA  and  a  Japan  Fund  for \nInformation  and  Communication  Technology  (JFICT)  project  to  best  utilize  different  ADB \nmodalities to support SME development.16 Assistance funded by the JFICT is central to support \nactivities to improve the enabling environment for SMEs by implementing two key activities in \nthe SME Development Plan: implementing the PBR design and streamlining the registration and \nlicensing  processes.  The  first  activity  is  a  complex  undertaking  to  create  a  database  and \nelectronic interfaces between the government agencies concerned. Initially, the JFICT project \nwill streamline and link BIR, DTI, SEC, and LGUs that have electronic systems. Subsequently, \nother government agencies will be interfaced with the registry, such as the Department of Labor \nand Employment, National Statistics Office, and Social Security System. Initially to be operated \nby DTI, The PBR may subsequently become a separate entity. The registry will also be the \nvenue for electronic registration and over time for LGU licensing applications, thereby reducing \nthe  cost  and  time  required  for  registration  and  licensing,  enhancing  transparency  and \ngovernance of the process. A general set of basic requirements needed for registration and for \nlicensing, which should be applicable nationwide, has to be developed and forms standardized. \nWhile this may be perceived as intruding on the Local Government Code by limiting freedom to \nset licensing requirements, the aim to at least ensure that SMEs across the nation have the \nsame basic requirements to operate in their respective fields. PBR implementation will take 1 \nyear, and is expected to start as soon as budget funds are released. The target for PBR to be \noperational is mid-2006. A summary of the JFICT supported project is in Appendix 10. \n \n48.  Fourth, the associated TA, Strengthening SME Credit Management Systems, has two \nobjectives: (i) to strengthen SB Corporation\u2019s credit underwriting and risk management, and (ii) \nto work with DTI to develop a blueprint for a movables collateral registry. Such a registry will \nfacilitate secured transactions based on movable collateral and expand the options for SME \nfinance. The blueprint encompasses a review of existing laws and recommendations related to \npotential amendments and/or new legislation that might be required to expand the framework for \nsecured transactions to encompass movable property. In addition, a strategy is needed to set \nup the collateral registry. This involves identifying and working with key stakeholders, from the \npublic and private sectors, who will oversee the creation of the registry, maintain it, and use it. \nThe output will be a time-bound action plan for creating the movable collateral registry. A \nsummary and framework for the associated TA is in Appendix 5.  \n \n                                                 \n16 The JFCIT Project Developing the Philippine Business Registry was approved by the Government of Japan on 28 \nMay, 2005 \n ", "14    \nD.  Proposed Project Loan \n1.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n49.  SB Corporation has requested a loan of \u00a52,746,625,000 ($25 million equivalent) from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  loan  with  Government \nguarantee  will  have  a  15-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, and a commitment fee of 0.75 per annum and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan agreement.17 SB Corporation has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n50.  To  avoid  foreign  exchange  risk  and  to  comply  with  its  management  policy,  SB \nCorporation will sign a separate agreement with the Philippine Government to exchange the \ndollar- or yen-denominated loan into a peso-denominated liability. The Government will charge \nup to 5% per annum for the guarantee including the foreign exchange risk cover for a dollar \nloan. The charge for a yen loan may be different. However, the rate for the guarantee including \nforeign exchange risk cover is still subject to review by the Department of Finance. The rules to \nimplement the foreign exchange risk cover and guarantee premiums payment structure will be \nissued when completed. \n \n51.  ADB\u2019s proportion of SB Corporation funding for relending and onlending will at most \nreach 65%. \n \n2.  Implementation Arrangements \n \na.  SB Corporation Relending to PFIs and Onlending to SMEs  \n \n52.  A total of $20 million equivalent of the ADB loan will be lent through SB Corporation\u2019s \naccredited PFIs for onlending to eligible SMEs. SB Corporation\u2019s wholesale lending products \nrange from P100,000 ($1,790) to P15 million ($267,900) and with maturities from 1\u20135 years. In \nthe wholesale lending program, the relending rates that SB Corporation charges PFIs is, as of 1 \nJune 2005: 7.2% up to 90 days, 7.5% 91\u2013181 days, 7.8% 182\u2013270 days, 8.2% 271\u2013360 days, \n9.2% 1\u20133 years, 9.7% 3\u20135 years, and 10.2 5\u20137 years. The PFIs add charges ranging from 4% \nto  8%  to  cover  their  costs  and  reflect  the  perceived  risk.  From  the  ADB  loan,  $5  million \nequivalent will be allocated to SB Corporation\u2019s retail lending. The retail loans range from \nP200,000 ($3,670) to P5,000,000 ($89,200) with maturities up to 5 years. The interest rates as \nof 1 June 2005 are 9.5% for fully secured loans up to 1 year, 13.8% for 1\u20133 years, and 14.5% \nfor 3\u20135 years. An additional charge of 1% per annum is made for loans partially secured (at \nleast 50% secured), and 2% for less than 50% secured. SB Corporation will create revolving \nfunds from repaid subloans to make new loans under the same criteria. Monthly charges to PFIs \nare computed based on 80% of MART 1 (benchmark rate of the Money Market Association of \nthe Philippines) plus 0.1% plus gross receipts tax (GRT),  while interest rates on retail loans are \ncomputed based on Sulong rates determined by the GFIs. \n \n                                                 \n17  If the loan is not approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors by 30 June 2006, a front end fee of 1%, or such other \namounts to be determined by the Board, will be applied.  \n ", "    15 \n53.  SB Corporation has accredited PFIs, using criteria that include (i) good standing with \nBSP; (ii) positive net income and net worth for the past 3 years; (iii) nonperforming loan ratio of \nnot more that 20%; (iv) qualified staff and/or loan desk for SME loans; (v) capital adequacy, \nasset quality, management quality, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk (CAMELS) \nrating of at least 3 based on the BSP scoring system; and (vi) satisfactory track record under \nother wholesale loan facilities. The accreditation requirements basically correspond to ADB \nGuidelines on Financial Intermediary Loans18 for selecting PFIs. \n \n    b.  SME Eligibility \n \n54.  SB Corporation\u2019s criteria for eligibility will apply as well as ADB safeguard policies. All \nSMEs  are  eligible  under  wholesale  and  retail  lending  except  those engaged  in  farm  level \nagriculture or aquaculture production, trading of imported goods, trading of liquor and cigarettes \nor illegal substances, and housing projects. SB Corporation also requires SMEs to comply with \nthe environmental laws of the Philippines and keep sound financial accounts. All Philippine \nmanufacturing  enterprises  must  obtain  an  environmental  compliance  certificate  from  the \nDepartment of Environment and National Resources, which is to be renewed annually.  \n \nc.  Project Management \n55.  SB Corporation, the Executing Agency will implement the SMEDSP and is implementing \nthe associated TA (Appendix 5). DTI will implement the component on developing a movables \ncollateral registry. In addition, ADB will coordinate with other development projects supported by \nmembers of the SME Donor Working Group, in particular with KfW to ensure complementarity \nbetween the ADB credit line and associated TA to SB Corporation and KfW\u2019s planned credit line \nand TA to SB Corporation.  \n \nd.  Implementation Period \n56.  The SMEDSP will be implemented over 5 years from loan effectiveness. The closing \ndate for submission of drawdown applications, and approval and authorization for disbursement \nfrom the loan, will be within 5 years of the date of loan effectiveness. The closing date for \ndisbursements  will  be  6  months  after  the  closing  date  of  the  submission  of  withdrawal \napplication, approval, and authorization. \n \ne.  Procurement \n57.  Subborrowers will be encouraged to follow ADB guidelines for procurement applicable to \ndevelopment  finance  institutions  with  SB  Corporation  assistance  when  applicable.  These \nguidelines require subborrowers to (i) demonstrate that procurement procedures adopted are \nappropriate in the circumstances; (ii) ensure that goods and services to be financed by subloans \nare purchased with consideration to economy and efficiency at a reasonable price, given time of \ndelivery, quality, and efficiency; and (iii) ensure that all goods and services to be financed by \nsubloans  are  procured  from  ADB  member  countries.  Subborrowers  will  be  encouraged  to \nprocure goods through international competitive bidding and/or international shopping when \nsuch procedures are applicable in the interest of economy and efficiency.  \n \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2003.

All disbursement under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with the ADB \nLoan Disbursement Handbook. To expedite project implementation through timely release of \nADB  funds  for  eligible  expenditures,  SB  Corporation  will  establish  a  yen  imprest  account \nexclusively for the Project at Landbank of the Philippines. The limit of the imprest account will be \nthe estimated subproject expenditure for 6 months or 20% of the loan amount, whichever is \nlower. The statement of expenditure procedure will be used to liquidate and replenish the \nimprest  account.  SB  Corporation  will  maintain  disbursement  documentation  in  support  of \nexpenditures and make them available to ADB for examination.  \n \ng.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n59.  SB Corporation will maintain a separate set of project accounts acceptable to ADB . The \nCommission on Audit will audit these accounts, and SB Corporation will provide ADB with \ncopies of the accounts and audit reports within 6 months of the completion of each financial \nyear.19 A separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure \nprocedures should be included in the audit report. Delay in submission of audited financial \nstatements with acceptable quality may result in ADB suspending loan disbursements.  \n \n60.  SB  Corporation  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  a  quarterly  report  on  the operational and \nfinancial performance of SB Corporation and SMEDSP implementation within 2 months after the \nend of each quarter; (ii) a projected annual disbursement schedule, broken down by quarters by \n15 December each year; (iii) updated 5-year financial projections of SB Corporation by 31 \nMarch each year; and (iv) a project completion report within 3 months of project completion  \ndetailing  project  implementation,  project  costs,  loan  recoveries,  financial  conditions  of  SB \nCorporation, and other details that ADB may consider necessary. \n \nh.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n61.  SB Corporation and ADB will carry out project benefit monitoring and evaluation. The \ndesign and monitoring framework will be used to monitor overall progress and benefits.  \n \ni.  Safeguard Measures \n62.  The credit line is classified as \u201cfinancial intermediary\u201d for the purpose of compliance with \nADB safeguard policies. The SMEDSP is expected to have minimal environmental impact. The \neligibility  criteria  for  SME  borrowers  are  listed  in  para.  54.  SB  Corporation  undertakes \nenvironmental due diligence, following the manual developed by the Development Bank of the \nPhilippines, with guidelines for loan applications, site visits, audits, and performance monitoring. \nStaff also follow the Handbook of Environmental Standards. Compliance is assured by the \ncompliance  officer,  who  is  a  member  of  the  Management  and  Credit  Committee.  SB \nCorporations\u2019  environmental  policies  are  referred  to  in  Appendix  3.  The  ADB  Regional \nEnvironment and Social Safeguard Division classified the SMEDSP as category C for both \n                                                 \n19  ADB has no objections to the Commission on Audit undertaking the audit as ADB has found the audit process \nsatisfactory. On 27 January 2005, the Monetary Board of BSP approved the exemption of government-owned or \ncontrolled banks from the requirement of an annual financial audit by an external auditor on the grounds that the \nbanks\u2019 full public accountability and compliance with banking laws and regulations can be reasonably assured with \nthe concurrent audit and examination being conducted by the Commission on Audit and BSP, which are both \n0presently applying the risk-based approach to audit and examination.    \n ", "    17 \ninvoluntary resettlement and impact on indigenous people.20 Since the loans to SMEs will be \nmainly  for  light  manufacturing,  trade,  and  service  sectors,  adverse  impacts  on  indigenous \npeople and involuntary resettlement are highly unlikely.  \n \nj.  Project Review \n63.  ADB, with SB Corporation assistance, will carry out a comprehensive review of the \nSMEDSP about 18 months after loan effectiveness. The review will assess progress of lending \nunder the first phase of the loan, evaluate progress in improving the enabling environment and \nin strengthening of SB Corporation\u2019s credit evaluation and risk management practices through \nassessing implementation of the deliverables from the associated TA and utilization of the PCG. \nADB will conduct annual project reviews during project implementation. The results of review \nmissions  will  be  shared  with  BSP,  Department  of  Finance,  DTI,  and  National  Economic \nDevelopment Authority.  \n \nE.  Proposed Partial Credit Guarantee  \n \n64.  The PCG facility will have an overall limit of up to P1 billion (currently equivalent to \n$18.40 million); the PFIs will cover the remaining risk of up to P1 billion. Sublimits per PFI are \nset at up to the peso equivalent of up to P500 million. In addition to the 50/50 risk-sharing \nscheme between ADB and the PFI, ADB will negotiate a first loss provision to be entirely \nassumed by the PFI. The first loss will be a reflection of the loss experience of each PFI. \nAppendix 6 provides details on the PCG.  \n \n65.  ADB will enter into PCG agreements with each PFI, to define the portfolio to be covered \nincluding the PFI\u2019s SME target benchmarks and the loss limit for that PCG. The conditions of \neach PCG will be determined on a case-by-case basis based on the due diligence of the PFI \nand its SME lending processes and operations. Terms and conditions for each PCG will be \ndetailed in a term sheet in line with the parameters described in Appendix 7, subject to approval \nfrom the Director General of PSOD and the ADB Guarantee Committee (Appendix 8 provides \nsample underwriting guidelines). Each PCG agreement will follow a standardized format and \ndetail the requirement for monthly reporting, as well as prompt information on any potential \nlosses or defaults in the portfolio. ADB will monitor the utilization of the PCG facility through \nannual  on-site  review  of  the  PFIs\u2019  exposure  to  SMEs,  specifically  the  portfolio  quality \nunderwritten by the PFIs, completion of agreed business targets indicated in the business plans, \nand compliance with ADB negative lists. ADB will retain the option to modify existing guarantee \nparameters with adequate notice, or suspend new SME loan inclusions under the guaranteed \nportfolio. \n \n66.  The PCG facility is classified as \u201cfinancial intermediary\u201d for the purpose of compliance \nwith  ADB  environmental  protection  and  social  safeguard  guidelines  and  policies.  ADB  will \nestablish an environment management system, specified for each PFI under the guarantee \nagreement to ensure the PFIs adhere to ADB Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines  (2003),  as  well  as  to  ADB  policies  on  involuntary  resettlement, \nindigenous  peoples,  and  procurement.  ADB  will  require  the  PFIs  under  the  guarantee \nagreements to acknowledge in progress reports that all borrowers comply with health, safety, \nand  environmental  regulations  and  standards  as  well  as  public  consultation  requirements \napplicable in the Philippines. Since the PFIs\u2019 loans to SMEs will be largely in the service, trade, \nand light manufacturing sector, involuntary resettlement or detrimental impacts on indigenous \n                                                 \n20  Memos signed on 19 April and 6 May 2004 respectively.  \n ", "18    \npeople are unlikely. As for environmental safeguards, ADB due diligence will identify areas for \nremedy, including negative lists and training as necessary. \n \nF.  Proposed Equity Investment  \n \n67.  The proposed equity investment in the CIB will be up to $1 million, not to exceed 25% of \nthe total project cost initially estimated at $4 million. Details of the terms and implementation \narrangements for the equity investment will be made available only after the CISA is passed \n(para.  19).  The  Senate  Committee  on  Banks,  Financial  Institutions,  and  Currencies  has \nreviewed and endorsed the draft bill which is targeted for approval before the end of 2005.  \n \n68.  Following board approval and the passing of the CISA, PSOD will conduct a thorough \ndue diligence on the equity investment and present its findings to the Private Sector Credit \nCommittee. BSP is currently developing a detailed business plan, which once finalized will be \nreviewed by PSOD. PSOD will submit a detailed investment proposal covering all key aspects \nof  the  equity  investment  including  financial  projections,  and  information  on  the  concept, \nstructure, management, and ownership of the company. ADB\u2019s final decision to invest will be \nsubject to approval by the Private Sector Credit Committee and successful completion of legal \ndocumentation. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impact  \n \n69.  The  SMEDSP,  associated  TA,  and  JFICT  project  are  expected  to  contribute  to  an \nimproved enabling environment for SMEs, a financially stronger SB Corporation better equipped \nto  expand  its  portfolio  at  the  wholesale  and  retail  level,  expanded  SME  lending  by  SB \nCorporation and commercial banks, improved access to credit information by banks and other \ncredit providers, and increased SME growth and job creation by SMEs. SMEs are expected to \nbenefit from better access to and augmented availability of finance. The project preparatory TA \nreport provided estimates based on previous lending. During 1994\u20131997 under the wholesale \nlending window P1 million lent generated 3.18 additional jobs, and under the retail window \n1999\u20132003 P1 million lent generated 6.74 additional jobs. Using that as a guide, a static \ncalculation indicates at least 3,500 and 1,800 additional jobs under the two lending windows \nrespectively. However, any estimates can only give indicative figures given the variety of SMEs \nin terms of labor intensity. Successful project implementation will result in increased SME \ninvestments, output, exports, and employment; but exact targets for each variable are not \nrealistic.  The  SMEDSP  will  be  effectively  complemented  by  other  development  programs \ntargeted  at  BDS  (GTZ  and  Canadian  International  Development  Agency),  microenterprises \n(United States Agency for International Development), SMEs in the Visayas region (KfW), and \npossible further assistance by other development partners. A summary of poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy considerations is given in Appendix 11.  \n \nB.  Risks and Assumptions  \n \n70.  One of the main factors affecting SMEDSP is overall the macroeconomic environment. \nCurrent projections for the Philippines indicate an average 4.9% annual real gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth for 2005\u20132009, with inflation on a downward trend to about 4% and the \nbudget deficit being reduced to about 1% of GDP by 2009. Adverse developments in the world \neconomy could dampen growth prospects in the Philippines; conversely, higher than projected \ngrowth in the world economy could lead to higher growth.  \n ", "    19 \n \n71.  The main assumptions for the SMEDSP also carry some risks that are addressed by \nmitigating measures. The assumptions are (i) the Government is strongly committed and has \nthe capacity to implement the SMEDSP as an integral part of a comprehensive support program \nfor SME development; (ii) SB Corporation has sufficient capacity to absorb the ADB loan; (iii) \ncredit expansion of SB Corporation will not have any potential adverse impact on private sector \nbanks; and (iv) private banks have the capacity to effectively utilize the resources, including the \nPCG.  \n \n72.  The Government is strongly committed to supporting SME development by implementing \nthe SME Development Plan 2004\u20132010, and President Arroyo\u2019s 10-point agenda as expanded \nin the MTPDP 2004\u20132010. The MTPDP emphasizes the need to increase investments and \ntrade, and recognizes that the high cost of doing business must be reduced, and infrastructure \nmodernized to realize growth and employment targets. The action program to prioritize and \nimplement  the  SME  Development  Plan  will  ensure  appropriate  sequencing  and  securing \nbudgetary allocations or aid funding for activities. The SME Donor Working Group is an active \nforum for collaboration to ensure that efforts are complementary. \n \n73.  SB Corporation is expected to be able to channel funds effectively through accredited \nPFIs as these are experienced SME lenders with a broad network of branches. The selection \ncriteria used under the accreditation system of SB Corporation are quite conservative and can \ncorrespond  to  ADB  Guidelines  on  Financial  Intermediary  Loans  for  selecting  PFIs.  SB \nCorporation  has  developed  a  model  for  retail  lending,  has  a  proven  track  record  of  SME \nfinancing  operations,  and  a  strong  pipeline  of  projects  for  both  retail  and  wholesale.  The \nassociated TA will strengthen SB Corporation\u2019s credit underwriting and risk management. Upon \nenactment of amendments to the SME Magna Carta, Republic Act 6977, SB Corporation will \nhave (i) discretion in its staffing and remuneration policies, (ii) a sovereign guarantee reinstated, \nand (iii) greater discretion over funding and investment decisions.  \n \n74.  As a GFI, SB Corporation abides by Executive Order 138, which limits GFIs to providing \nwholesale funds to private financial institutions engaged in retail lending. The order only allows \nGFIs to provide retail services to the target sectors not adequately served by private financial \ninstitutions. Thus retail lending operations of SB Corporation are mandated to support SMEs \nunderserved  by  the  private  sector  financial  institutions.  Expanding  SB  Corporation  lending \noperations has  no  potential  adverse  impact on  private sector  banks.  On  the contrary,  SB \nCorporation aims to capture the underserved segment of the SME market and has a policy to \ngraduate its borrowers to become private sector bank clients. SB Corporation\u2019s capacity will be \nstrengthened through TA to ensure that credit expansion is undertaken in a prudent manner. \n \n75.  To ensure effective utilization of the PCG, PCG allocation will be made based on the \ndemand projected by the selected banks. ADB will also bear the operational risk on the PFIs in \nterms of their credit assessment and due diligence in identifying reliable SMEs. These risks are \nmitigated by the (i) loss-sharing structure of the project where the PFI will cover 50% share on \ncredit loss, (ii) annual review of the PFI\u2019s credit program where ADB reserves the right to cancel \nthe unused limit, and (iii) the PFI accounting for a credit risk equivalent to the full extent of the \nunguaranteed portion (i.e. no third party insurance, guarantees, or government subsidy) to \nincrease commitment to the credit program. \n \n ", "20    \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances  \n76.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and/or SB Corporation have \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  SB Corporation will implement the lending strategy outlined in the MTPDP, and \nstrengthen its financial performance and risk management with support of ADB \nTA. The performance targets to be reached include, at least an annual return on \nassets of no less than 2.0%, capital adequacy ratio not less than 10% by 2009, \nand nonperforming loan ratio below the industry average by the end of 2009 \n(based on BSP\u2019s classification of SB Corporation). \n \n(ii)  SB Corporation will actively advocate for the amendment of the SME Magna \nCarta to (a) reinstate the sovereign guarantee to SB Corporation, (b) allow SB \nCorporation\u2019s board greater discretion in funding and investment decisions, and \n(c)  allow  SB  Corporation  to  independently  determine  staffing  structure  and \nremuneration. Implementation will be undertaken immediately upon enactment of \nthe amendments SB Corporation will undertake a review of human resource \npolicies, remuneration, and organizational structure to assess whether current \nstaffing is optimal to undertake the added responsibilities and manage expanded \nfunding to meet performance targets.  \n \n(iii)  SB Corporation will develop a separate strategy with performance and financial \ntargets for its guarantee products to meet the overall strategy of supporting SME \nfinance outlined in the MTPDP.  \n \n(iv)  SB Corporation will assess and report by 2009 the feasibility, regulatory, and risk \nmanagement  frameworks  for  alternative  modalities  of  SME  finance  to \ncomplement lending such as (a) funds for start-up businesses, and (b) venture \ncapital  funds:  and  assess  possible  public-private  partnerships  for  such \nmodalities. \n \n(v)  SB Corporation will ensure that SMEs adhere to Government environmental \nlaws;  regulations  and  standards;  and  ADB  environmental  procedures, \nrequirements,  and  guidelines,  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  for  activities \nfinanced under the Project; and undertake appropriate monitoring and mitigation \nmeasures.  \n \n(vi)  DTI will make the PBR operational within 1 year from the release of funds and \nstart of implementation. \n \n(vii)  DTI will assess alternative modes of collateral including a personal guarantee \nsystem and secured transactions based on movable property. \n \n77.   In addition all PFIs participating in the PCG will ensure that the guaranteed SMEs \nadhere to Government environmental laws, regulations and standards, and ADB environmental \nprocedures, requirements, and guidelines, as amended from time to time, for activities being \nfinanced under the Project, and undertake appropriate monitoring and mitigation measures. \n \n ", "    21 \nB.  PSOD\u2019s Investment Limits \n \n78.   The proposed private sector assistance, which is PSOD\u2019s 14th in the Philippines, will, \nonce approved by the Board, represent 1.42% of PSOD\u2019s total exposure,21 increase country \nexposure to 6.98%, and increase exposure to SMEs to 1.42%. The proposed investment is \nwithin ADB\u2019s country, industry, and single project exposure limits for private sector projects. \n \nC.  Conditions for Disbursement under Phase Two \n \n79.   The second phase of the loan to SB Corporation of $15 million equivalent will be made \navailable for drawdown subject to (i) utilization of the loan in accordance with the terms of the \nloan agreement, (ii) 70% drawdown of the first $10 million equivalent and outstanding in SME \nloans, and (iii) the credit scoring model and new credit underwriting and risk management \nreporting formats developed under the associated TA being introduced (footnote 13).  \n \nVI.

GUARANTEE AND FINANCE CORPORATION \n \nA.  Ownership, Management and Organization, and Supervision \n1.  The  Small  Business  Guarantee  and  Finance  Corporation  (SB  Corporation),  a \ngovernment financial institution (GFI), was established on 24 January 1991 under Republic Act \n6977 also known as the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Magna Carta, to function as the \nSME financing champion of the national Government. Subscribed and paid-up capital as of \nDecember  2003  amounted  to  P1.8  billion  contributed  by  five  government  entities  and  the \nGovernment.1 \n \n2.  A nine-member board of directors governs SB Corporation, comprising a representative \neach of the five shareholders, three private sector representatives and the chief executive \nofficer who is also the chairs. The chair is responsible for overall operations of SB Corporation, \nassisted by a president and seven group heads. SB Corporation\u2019s head office is in Makati City, \nMetro Manila; it has two regional offices in Cebu and Davao, and two representative offices in \nLuzon. Total number of employees is currently 138. As a GFI, SB Corporation is subject to the \nSalary Standardization Law. \n \n3.  On 16 November 2001, SB Corporation merged with the Guarantee Fund for Small and \nMedium Enterprises, a guarantee fund operated by the Livelihood Corporation attached to the \nOffice of the President. It had offered guarantee services to participating financial institutions \n(PFIs)  lending  to  SMEs  since  the  start  of  its  operations  in  1984.  With  the  merger,  the \nGovernment became the largest shareholder of SB Corporation.2 \n \n4.  SB Corporation is supervised by Bangko Sentral Ng Pilipinas (BSP) and adheres to BSP \nregulations on loan classification, provisioning, and single borrower limits even though it is not \nlicensed as a bank. As a GFI, SB Corporation is audited annually by the Commission on Audit, \nwhich publishes the audits on its website, as well as providing print copies.  \n \n5.  In March 2004, a new Oracle-based management information system was implemented \ncovering  retail  lending,  wholesale  credit  lines,  and  guarantees.  The  standardized  features \nensure that all necessary data are entered into the database and performance analysis and \nevaluations can be done by line of business or even further refined, such as by subsector, \ngeographic region, company asset size, or loan size. Retail lending data for all retail loans since \n2002 has been input to the system to allow effective follow-up and analysis of loan performance \nand defaults. The plan is to put in all data for retail lending since it started in 1999 to form the \nbasis for a credit-scoring model. The number of loans is not sufficient for a full-fledged statistical \nmodel but do support work on a judgmental model and provide data for the associated technical \nassistance (TA) aimed at improving the credit underwriting process. Likewise, the database \nprovides SB Corporation\u2019s management and board with detailed data to support decisions on \nthe various lending and guarantee programs, as well as facilitates financial management and \nplanning. \n \n                                                 \n1  Land Bank of the Philippines, Development Bank of the Philippines, Social Security System, Government Service \nInsurance System, and Philippine National Bank. \n2  The current shareholdings are: national Government 44.30%, Landbank of the Philippines 20.05%, Development \nBank of the Philippines 11.14%, Social Security System 11.14%, Government Service Insurance System 11.14%, \nand Philippine National Bank 2.23%.  \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nB.   Operations  \n6.  SB Corporation\u2019s operations cover three areas: guarantees, and wholesale and retail \nSME lending. The target market is classified into three groups of SMEs: bankable, nearly \nbankable, and prebankable but viable SMEs. For bankable SMEs, the SB Corporation offers \nwholesale lending facilities to help SMEs obtain funding from the formal financial sector at \nreasonable  interest  rates  with  longer  payment  terms.  For  nearly  bankable  SMEs,  SB \nCorporation offers guarantee facilities allowing SMEs access to credit from the formal financial \nsector by securing a certain percentage of the loan (up to 85%). For prebankable but viable \nSMEs, SB Corporation provides direct loans for short-term receivables, purchase order and/or \nletter of credit financing as well as working capital and fixed asset financing. Features that \ndifferentiate SB Corporation\u2019s lending from banks is that SB Corporation offers smaller loans, \nwith longer repayment terms at fixed interest rates. In terms of collateral, SB Corporation \naccepts a broader range of collateral (e.g., real estate, motor vehicles, receivables, purchasing \norders, and corporate guarantees) compared with banks that mainly accept titled prime real \nestate lots. Collateral is valued at 64% of principal. This is in order to reach the target group of \nSMEs with smaller financing needs than commercial banks tend to accommodate. \n \n7.  Guarantee operations started in 1992, and by 31 December 2003, SB Corporation had \nguaranteed a total of 4,675 accounts for P8.66 billion. Cumulative guarantee payments from \n1993 to 2002 were at P101.64 million ($1.8 million) with recoveries of P44.86 million ($0.8 \nmillion).  The  payments  represent  4.8%  of  total  guarantees  approved  and  issued  by  SB \nCorporation  for  the  same  period.  The  process  for  guarantees  is  as  follows.  Applications \nreceived from PFIs are reviewed by the Credit Guarantees Group at SB Corporation. They \nundertake a second due diligence of the application and if complete and favorably evaluated, \nthe application is then sent to the Credit Committee for approval. The Credit Guarantees Group \nis seriously understaffed resulting in long processing times, and this, in combination with the fact \nthat SB Corporation does not have a sovereign guarantee, are cited by banks as reasons for \ntheir limited use of SB Corporation\u2019s guarantee.  \n \n8.  The  wholesale  lending  window  was  introduced  in  1994.  SB  Corporation\u2019s  board \naccredits  financial  institutions  if  they  meet  specified  criteria.  Financial  institutions  can  be \naccredited either through a fast-track or regular process. The fast-track process applies to the \ntop 50% of expanded commercial banks in the Philippines and the top five commercial banks. \nThe minimum criteria for these banks are (i) the bank must be in good standing with BSP and/or \nlisted at the Philippine Stock Exchange, (ii) have a satisfactory track record of dealing with \ncredits with other GFIs, (iii) have a nonperforming loan ratio below 20%, and (iv) a CAMELS3 \nrating of 3 at BSP. All other banks are accredited through the regular process, which include a \nqualitative  evaluation  of  the  financial  institutions  performance  for  the  3  years  preceding \naccreditation. Ratios are calculated for profitability, collection efficiency, solvency, and liquidity. \nThe qualitative evaluation includes assessments of (i) the management, board, and key offices; \n(ii)  ownership  structure;  (iii)  background  and  history  of  the  bank;  (iv)  compliance  BSP\u2019s \nregulations on single borrower limits, DOSRI (director, officer, shareholder of the bankd or their \nrelated interests) rules, loan loss provisioning, and capitalization; (vi) compliance with the legally \nmandated lending to SMEs; and (vii) rate of lending activity. Accredited financial institutions then \nget access to a credit line for onlending to SMEs in SB Corporation\u2019s target groups. As of \nJanuary 2005, 30 PFIs were accredited and active. Some smaller banks reportedly seek SB \nCorporation accreditation more as a seal of good standing than as a means to augment their \nlending resources and thus tend to make limited use of SB Corporation\u2019 wholesale lending \n                                                 \n3  CAMELS stands for capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk.  \n   ", "Appendix 3          31 \n   \nfacility. The most active PFIs promote SB Corporation\u2019s products to the intended target groups. \nA strong feature of SB Corporation\u2019s products is that the interest rates are fixed, and PFIs \nusually revise interest rates monthly for their own lending products.  \n \n9.  Eligible  SMEs  cannot  be  engaged  in  farm-level  agri/aqua  production,  extractive \nindustries (mining/quarrying); trading of imported goods, liquor, or cigarettes; housing projects; \nor  trading  of  banned  substances.  The  loans  range  from  P100,000  to  P15,000,000  with \nmaturities between 1\u20135 years. In the wholesale lending program, 1 June 2005 SB Corporation \nwas charging PFIs relending rates of 7.2% up to 90 days, 7.5% 91\u2013181 days, 7.8% 182\u2013270 \ndays, 8.2% 271\u2013360 days, 9.2% 1\u20133 years, 9.7% 3\u20135 years, and 10.2% 5\u20137 years. The PFIs \nadd charges ranging from 4\u20138% to cover their costs and reflect the perceived risk. Monthly \ncharges to PFIs are computed based on 80% of MART 1 plus 0.1% plus gross receipts tax. \nPFIs own funding costs vary but the average deposit rate for pesos in May 2005 was 5.1%. \nFrom 1994 to December 2003, P8.53 billion were disbursed  benefiting 5,158 SMEs.  \n \n10.  The accredited and active financial institutions include (i) commercial banks: Banco de \nOro, Bank of Commerce, Development Bank of the Philippines, Equitable Bank, Land Bank of \nthe Philippines and Philippine National Bank; (ii) thrift banks: Bank, Anchor Savings, Asia Trust \nBank,  Dumaguete  City  Development,  First  Consolidated,  Insular  Savings  Bank,  Malayan \nSavings Bank, Planter\u2019s Development Bank, Postal Savings Bank, and Robinsons Savings \nBank;  (iii)  rural  banks:  Bank  of  Florida,  BMS  Rural  Bank,  Cooperative  Bank  of  Miramis, \nEnterprise Capital Bank,  Excel Rural Bank, First Macro Bank, Maranao Rural Bank, and \nProvidence Rural Bank, and nonbank financial institutions; and (iv) Landbank of the Philippines \nLeasing  and  Majalco  Finance.  Through  this  network  of  accredited  financial  institutions  SB \nCorporation has a nationwide reach for their products.  \n \n11.  Retail lending was started in 1999 following a Government decision to ensure that SMEs \nhad access to credit after the Asian financial crises. SMEs course their applications through SB \nCorporation\u2019s offices in Manila, Cebu, or Davao, where they are screened by account officers, \nwho ensure that applications are complete. A site visit is undertaken before applications are \nsent to the credit committee in the Manila office for approval. From 1999 to December 2003, a \ntotal of P1.4 billion had been disbursed to 1,207 SMEs. The nonperforming loan ratio of the \ndirect lending was recorded at 6.7% as of 31 December 2003.  \n \n12.  SMEs eligible for loans under the retail lending window must have between P500,000 \nand P1,000,000 in assets, be at least 60% Filipino owned if it is a corporation, and must have at \nleast a 1 year profitable track record. Eligible SMEs cannot be engaged in farm-level agri/aqua \nproduction, extractive industries (mining/quarrying), trading of imported goods, housing projects, \nor vice-generating activities (tobacco). The minimum loan amount granted is P200,000, and \nmaximum P5 million. The repayment term is up to 5 years and interest rates are fixed. The \nrange of acceptable collateral includes real estate, motor vehicles, equipment, assignment of \nreceivables, and corporate guarantees. The interest rates as of 1 June 2005 are 9.5% for fully \nsecured loans up to 1 year, 13.8% for 1\u20133 years, and 14.5% for 3\u20135 years. An additional charge \nis  made  for  partially  secured/at  least  50%  secured  loans  of  1%  per  annum,  and  2%  for \npartially/less than 50% secured loans. Interest rates on retail loans are computed based on \nSulong rates determined by the GFIs. \n \n13.  In 2004 SB Corporation launched a new business line to broaden its support for SMEs, \nthe Equity Ventures Program, aimed at supporting the financing needs of SMEs that are \u201cready \nto develop into a higher level of marketing, technical, management and operation.\u201d SMEs must \nbe proprietorships/partnerships and meet a number of requirements. The amount of investment \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \nis limited to P20 million or 40% of authorized capital of the SME whichever is lower. Along with \nsponsors  SB  Corporation  can  provide  equity  investments  on  a  50:50  basis  through  an \ninvestment fund. The investment fund will exit after 4\u20135 years through redemption of stock, \ninitial public offering, or sale to a third party. The first equity investment was approved in 2004, \nfor P6 million in convertible notes.  \n \n14.  In July 2003, SB Corporation\u2019s management appointed a management committee and \ncredit  committee  member  as  environmental  rules  and  standards  compliance  officer.  SB \nCorporation is currently using the Handbook of Environmental Standards and the Manual on \nEnvironmental Due Diligence in Project Evaluation developed by Development Bank of the \nPhilippines (DBP). The manual has a step-by-step procedure for applying environmental due \ndiligence to the evaluation of loan applications, and guidelines for site visits, environmental \naudits, and performance monitoring. DBP was ISO 14001 certified by SGS Switzerland SA from \n2002\u20132004 for its successful implementation of an environmental management system. SB \nCorporation management has authorized recruitment of a consultant to review the manual and \nprocesses\u2014and if deemed necessary\u2014adapt and update it specifically for SB Corporation and \ntheir  focus  on  SMEs.  In  addition  to  the  environmental  due  diligence  undertaken  by  SB \nCorporation, banks require an environmental compliance certificate from the Department of \nEnvironment and Natural Resources from companies involved in manufacturing. \n \nC.    Financial Performance  \n \n15.  Historical Performance. Table A6 shows SB Corporation\u2019s financial performance over \nthe past 5 years, and projections for 2005\u20132009. At present, SB Corporation appears to be \nhighly liquid, with cash and Government securities accounting for slightly more than 47% of total \nassets. However, under the terms of its borrowing arrangement with DBP, SB Corporation is \nrequired to maintain Government securities equal to its DBP borrowings. This requirement \nnotwithstanding, a key challenge for SB Corporation is to reduce these lower yielding assets, \nand replace them with higher yielding loans.  \n \n16.  The loan portfolio at fiscal year (FY) 2004 accounts for approximately 45% of total \nassets. Direct lending operations are projected to grow by about 30% per year over the next 5 \nyears. At this pace the portfolio will double in size by fiscal year-end (FYE) 2007. Over the \nprojection period, SB Corporation also plans steady reductions in nonperforming loans (NPLs), \nwith the ratio of NPLs to total loans set to fall from 24% at FYE2004, to 8% by FYE2009. NPLs \ninclude called guarantees that have been converted to loans (by nature past due and thus \nnonperforming); NPLs from direct lending operations are significantly lower than the total NPL \nfigure if the called guarantees are excluded. At FYE2004, SB Corporation estimates NPLs from \nits direct lending to be approximately 6%, well under control and substantially below the industry \naverage of about 14%. It estimates wholesale lending will account for slightly more than 60% of \ntotal lending as of FYE2004. Retail lending is presently 35% of the portfolio. At present, SB \nCorporation  does  a  small  amount  of  microlending  (on  a  wholesale  basis,  to  microfinance \ninstitutions, which accounts for 3% of the portfolio as of FYE2004.  \n \n17.  SB Corporation must maintain a strong capital base in order to support its guarantee \nbusiness. As of FYE2004, shareholders\u2019 equity is estimated to be 67% of total assets. While \nfrom the point of view of creditors and regulators, this strong capital base is a source of comfort, \nthe challenge for management is to leverage the equity base in order to generate returns \nsufficient to create enterprise value. SB Corporation is a profitable operation, and the estimate \nfor FYE2004 is 3.3% return on assets.  \n \n   ", "Appendix 3          33 \n   \n18.  Comparison of SB Corporation with Philippine Banks. SB Corporation\u2019s financial \nperformance  in  key  areas  compares  favorably  to  Philippine  commercial  banking  industry \naverages. Evaluating SB Corporation\u2019s audited financial statements in comparison to BSP\u2019s \npublished Selected Performance Indicators for the banking system as of 31 December 2003, SB \nCorporation emerges as significantly better capitalized: 79% equity to total assets, versus 13% \nfor commercial banks, and more profitable, as measured by return on assets: 1.8% versus \nbanks\u2019 1.1%. Regarding NPLs, SB Corporation\u2019s average was slightly below industry average, \nof 13.1% versus the banks\u2019 13.6% (both figures as of 31 December 2003). In addition, SB \nCorporation  maintains  significantly  higher  reserve  coverage  of  NPLs  than  the  average  for \nbanks, with provisions equal to 72.2% of NPLs as of 31 December 2004, versus 51.6% average \nreserve coverage for banks as of 30 September 2004.  \n \n19.  Projected Performance. For the upcoming 5 years, fiscal years 2005 through 2009, SB \nCorporation plans to reduce cash and Government securities to no more than 15% of total \nassets. As the portfolio grows, wholesale lending will increase to 71% of the loan portfolio by \nFYE2009, while retail and microfinance institution lending are expected to account for 14% and \n15%, respectively, by FYE2009. Over the projection period, borrowings (liabilities) will increase \nsubstantially, and the ratio of equity to total assets will be reduced to 43.4% by FYE2009. \nNonperforming  loans  (from  own  lending,  that  is,  outside  of  SB  Corporation\u2019s  guarantee \noperations) will be reduced gradually, from about 6% in 2004, to 4.4% in 2009; overall, NPLs \nwill be reduced to 8%, from the present nearly 21% registered as of end-2005. New borrowings, \nincluding  long-term  loans  from  ADB,  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development,  and \nKreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau,  will  supplement  equity.  Management  projects  fairly  steady \nprofitability over the next 5 years driven by sound spread management combined with effective \ncost control. Spread projections adequately take into consideration increased borrowing costs; \nprojected  spreads  are  lower  than  during  the  preceding  3  years.  In  addition,  salary  and \nadministrative expenses increase steadily in absolute terms, though not as a percentage of total \nassets, meaning that management has considered the necessity to expand the size of the \noperations to support portfolio growth.  \n \n20.  The key challenge for SB Corporation\u2019s managers is to increase balance sheet leverage \n(by expanding lending operations funded with borrowings), and at the same time control the rise \nin operating costs as the portfolio grows. SB Corporation\u2019s projections are free of excessively \noptimistic assumptions. The projected growth in total lending of about 30% per year represents \nthe single assumption that could be characterized as even moderately aggressive. ADB can \ntake great comfort from the primarily wholesale nature of SB Corporation\u2019s operations, and the \nstrong demand for funds from SB Corporation\u2019s PFIs. In addition, SB Corporation is clearly \ncommitted to maintaining credit quality, which means that loan portfolio quality will not be \nsacrificed in the interests of asset growth. Furthermore, the complementary TA will assist SB \nCorporation to strengthen loan product development and credit underwriting, along with financial \nmanagement. In short, the projections are reasonable and achievable, and the organization is \nsound and capable. \n \n \n \n ", "34  Appendix 3 \nTable A3:SB Corporation - Key Financial Data \n(P millions) \n31 Dec  31 Dec  21 Dec  31 Dec  31 Dec  31 Dec  31 Dec  31 Dec \nItem  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009 \nBalance Sheet  (1) (1) (2) (3) (3)  (3)  (3) (3)\nAssets                 \nCash and Government Securities  1,172       1,145        1,526       2,069       1,933        1,769           909          974 \nLoans, Net  629       1,203        1,439       1,754       2,353        3,035        3,887       5,013 \nROPOA, Net (4)  75            73             67            63            58             50             47            47 \nFixed Assets  114          113           112          110          109           107           106          104 \nOther Assets  60            62             76            98          110           124           123          154 \nTotal Assets  2,050       2,596        3,220       4,095       4,563        5,086        5,072       6,293 \nLiabilities and Shareholders' Equity                 \nLiabilities                 \nCurrent Liabilities  30            34             63          106          128           143           135          192 \nLong-term Borrowings             \u2013         500        1,000       1,761       2,137        2,521        2,374       3,369 \nTotal Liabilities  30          534        1,063       1,867       2,264        2,664        2,509       3,561 \nShareholders' Equity                 \nPaid-in Capital  1,875       1,875        1,875       1,923       1,971        2,060        2,150       2,240 \nRetained Earnings  145          187           283          306          328           361           413          492 \nTotal Shareholders' Equity  2,019       2,062        2,158       2,229       2,299        2,421        2,563       2,731 \n                \nTotal Liabilities and Shareholders' \nEquity  2,050       2,596        3,220       4,095       4,563        5,086        5,072       6,293 \n                \n  2002 2003 2004 2005 2006  2007  2008 2009\nIncome Statement                 \nInterest Income  150          147           256          320          352           406           451          526 \nInterest Expense  2              3             46            88          117           138           144          169 \nNet Interest Income  149          144           210          232          235           268           307          357 \nOther Income/Expense  (22)         (20)           (24)         (26)         (17)          (15)          (19)         (23)\nOperating Expenses  72            81             90          103          116           130           147          166 \nNet Income  54            42             96          103          102           123           142          169 \nRatios (%)                 \nCash & Govt Securities as % of Total \nAssets  57 44 47 51 42  35  18 15\nBorrowed Funds as % of Total Assets  0 19 31 43 47  50  47 54\nTotal Liabilities to Equity  2 26 49 84 99  110  98 130\nEquity to Total Assets  99 79 67 54 50  48  51 43\n   ", "Appendix 3          35 \n   \n                \nNPLs % of Total Outstanding Loans (5)  25 13 24 21 16  12  10 8\nWholesale Lending as % of Total \nLending (6)  \u2013 \u2013 61 68 70  70  70 71\nGrowth of Net Loan Portfolio  \u2013 91 20 22 34  29  28 29\n                \nNet Margin (Net Income / Total \nRevenue)  36 28 37 32 29  30  31 32\nROA (Average Assets after 2002))  3 2 3 3 2  3  3 3\nROE (Average Equity after 2002)  3 2 5 5 5  5  6 6\n                 \n\u2013 = not available (1) Actual based on Annual Reports audited by the Commission on Audit , (2) Estimated, (3) Projected, \n(4) Real and other properties owned or acquired, and (5) Nonperforming loans.  \n ", "36  Appendix 4 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n \n1.

Kredistanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW, German Financial Cooperation) provided DM15 \nmillion for the Small and Micro-enterprise Credit Project II of the Landbank of the Philippines \nand Philippine Business for Social Progress. The project used the Philippine Business for Social \nProgress  as  a  second-tier  wholesaler  of  funds  to  accredited  PFIs  for  onlending  to  micro, \ncottage,  and  small  enterprises.  KfW  also  funded  the  Window  III  facility  of  DBP  for  highly \ndevelopmental loans. Currently, KfW is preparing an SME credit line to SB Corporation of \u20ac6 \nmillion for onlending via selected PFIs to SMEs in the Visayas region.

The  technical  assistance  (TA),  Strengthening  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  (SME) \nCredit Management Systems1 is to strengthen the credit underwriting and risk management of \nthe Small Business Guarantee and Finance Corporation (SB Corporation), and work with the \nDepartment of Trade and Industry to develop a blueprint for a movables collateral registry \n(Table A5).  \n \nA.  Institutional Capacity Building at SB Corporation  \n \n2.  The TA will provide international expertise to SB Corporation managers and staff in \nsupport of building efficient, profitable lending businesses that can achieve substantial outreach. \nSB Corporation needs to strengthen its capacity to evaluate the profitability, credit risk, costs, \nand efficiency of both its wholesale and retail lending operations. The TA will be enhance \ncapacity to analyze costs, profitability, and credit risk in each of its two main lines of business. \nThe management information system will be improved, utilizing its Oracle-based system.  \n \n3.  The TA will examine the retail loan underwriting process. SB Corporation currently has a \nmore flexible approach to securing loans, and accepts a broader range of collateral, than do \ncommercial banks. A specialist in loan product development will work with SB Corporation \nmanagement  to  ensure  that  appropriate  non-asset-based  lending  methodologies  are \nincorporated into their underwriting process. The underwriting techniques should allow pledged \nitems secured via a registry of movable property to be accepted as collateral. This would \nminimize paperwork, processing times, and transaction costs, and expand lending volumes.  \n \n4.  Third, the TA will help SB Corporation develop a proprietary credit-scoring model that \nincorporates SB Corporation\u2019s own underwriting standards, and draw upon lessons learned \nfrom its own lending experience. Credit-scoring models allow financial institutions to streamline \nloan  processing,  and  thereby  increase  the  volume  of  business.  The  model  can  identify \nborrowers with poor risk profiles by evaluating key factors impacting payment performance. SB \nCorporation\u2019s database of retail customers provides an appropriate starting point for identifying \nkey factors affecting credit quality; this direct customer experience is necessary to develop a \ncredit-scoring model that fits SB Corporation. As a result of reviewing underwriting policies and \nprocedures  and  developing  a  credit-scoring  model,  loan  products  may  be  streamlined  or \nredesigned to be better tailored to SB Corporation\u2019s clients, and be more profitable as well.  \n \nB.  Enhance Legal Environment for Secured Transactions \n \n5.  The TA will create the blueprint for a movable collateral registry. Existing laws and \nrecommendations  will  be  reviewed  as  they  related  to  potential  amendments  and/or  new \nlegislation required to expand the framework for secured transactions to encompass movable \nproperty. A strategy for developing the collateral registry involves identifying and working with \nkey stakeholders, from both the public and private sectors, who will oversee the creation of the \nregistry, maintain it, and use it. The output will be a time-bound action plan for creating the \nmovable collateral registry \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2004.

Rationale and Objective \n \n1.  Rationale. The introduction of market-based products to enhance the channeling of \nexisting liquidity of the financial system to small and medium enterprise (SME) lending is a key \ninnovation supported under the Project. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) partial credit \nguarantee (PCG) facility, which in partnership with selected participating financial institutions \n(PFIs) shares the credit risks and rewards associated with SME lending, will raise the comfort \nlevel  of  PFIs  by  (i)  leveraging  the  PFIs\u2019  resources,  (ii)  assisting  PFIs  to  develop  client \nrelationships  with  SME  clients,  and  (iii)  introducing  good  practice  for  SME  lending  in  the \nPhilippines. The PCG facility will initially draw on international PFIs (based in the Philippines \nand with existing experience in SME lending in other emerging markets) and primarily top tier \ndomestic PFIs that are accredited in the recently approved Trade Finance Facilitation Program1 \nof ADB and that have both well-established underwriting procedures of an international standard \nand experience in similar lending methodologies. Once ADB has gained initial experience with \nthe PCG, more qualified domestic PFIs are expected to follow the first tier PFIs and develop \nsimilar methodologies for SME lending.2 \n \n2.  Objective of the PCG Facility. The objective of the PCG facility under the Project is \ntwofold: first, to leverage through a market-based approach existing financial resources of the \nfinancial system for lending to an SME segment currently underserved by PFIs; and second, to \nprovide catalytic support for innovative financial products and approaches in new and less \nfamiliar markets. Once successfully tested with PFIs, such products will be expanded among a \nlarger number of PFIs. The expected outcome of the PCG facility is a higher volume of SME \nlending by commercial PFIs in Philippines.  \n \nA.  Facility Design \n3.  Structure. ADB will share the credit risk of SME loans with selected PFIs that are also \nparticipants in the Trade Finance Facilitation Program project and have been identified by ADB \nin a thorough due diligence process. ADB will issue PCGs to PFIs to guarantee repayment of an \nagreed portion (up to 50%) of the SME loan portfolio. The PCGs will have agreed cover \namounts and time frames to be selected following a due diligence process. The PCGs will detail \nthe risk- and reward-sharing arrangements for individual loans within a defined portfolio of loans \nextended by the PFIs to SMEs. The loan portfolio covered under each PCG may be revolving, \nand the portfolio composition may change over time based on lending decisions of the PFI as \nagreed with ADB. ADB will not be involved in the lending decisions of the PFIs, but will agree \nwith the PFIs on the lending selection criteria and risk management process. To underscore the \nmarket approach, the PCG facility will be provided through ADB\u2019s private sector operations \nwithout government counterguarantee. Terms and conditions will be market based. \n \n4.  Scope. The PCG facility is proposed to have an overall limit of P1 billion (currently \nequivalent to $18.40 million). PCGs will be issued for each PFI based on demand and prudent \n                                                 \n1  Accredited institutions in the Trade Finance Facilitation Program are: Allied Bank, Asia Trust Bank, Banco De Oro, \nBank of the Philippine Islands, China Bank, Equitable-PCI Bank, Land Bank, Metro Bank, Philippine Bank of \nCommunication, Prudential Bank, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation, Security Bank, and Union Bank.  . \nAlthough the main target banks will be the local banks participating in the Trade Finance Facilitation Program \nProgram, the PCG facility can also be extended to ADB\u2019s investee bank, Planters Development Bank, where ADB \nhas prior credit experience and dealings. \n2  Starting the PCG facility program with a mix of one local and one international bank would be preferred, in order to \ncreate an atmosphere of competition, diversify the risks, and draw useful comparisons between the underwriting \nstyles and experience of the different institutions.  \n ", "Appendix 6       43\npractices, starting with lower amounts that can be gradually increased within the overall PCG \nfacility limit. This PCG facility is expected to be extended to some 2\u20135 PFIs with sublimit set at \nup to the peso equivalent of P500 million per PFI. In addition to the 50/50 risk sharing scheme, \nADB will negotiate a first loss provision (i.e., based on the PFI\u2019s historical first loss experience) \nwhere the PFI will assume full coverage of loan defaults associated with the portfolio\u2019s first loss.  \n \n5.  Prudent Phasing-in and Close Monitoring. Since the product is relatively new for \nADB,3 the PCG facility will commence operation with primarily those domestic PFIs accredited in \nthe Trade Finance Facilitation Program and international banks that have well established \nunderwriting  procedures  of  an  international  standard  and  experience  in  similar  lending \nmethodologies elsewhere, before expanding to other qualified domestic and international PFIs. \nLikewise, the portfolio of guaranteed loans will expand gradually. The tenor of guaranteed loans \nwill be limited to 36 months, although initially the PCG will be targeted at shorter maturities. \nOnce ADB is satisfied with the track record of the PFI and its SME borrowers, portfolio targets \nmay be revised to encourage PFIs to expand to riskier segments.  \n \n6.  The PCG facility will be available for issuance of PCGs to PFIs for 5 years from the date \nof establishment of the facility. Since each loan guaranteed under the facility may have a \nmaximum repayment term of up to 3 years depending on its risk profile, the facility will have a \nmaximum tenor of up to 8 years.  \n \n7.  Pricing. The PFI will pay ADB a predetermined fee, which will be reviewed annually. \nThe fee will be market based and determined for each PFI based on the risks identified during \nthe due diligence process and the risk-sharing mechanism agreed between ADB and the PFI.  \n \nB.  Implementation and Monitoring \n8.  Guarantee  Agreements,  Reporting,  and  Management.  ADB  will  enter  into  PCG \nagreements with each PFI, defining the portfolio to be covered including the PFI\u2019s SME target \nbenchmarks and the loss limit for that PCG. The conditions of each PCG agreement will be \ndetermined on a case-by-case basis based on the due diligence of the PFI and its SME lending \nprocesses and operations. Terms and conditions for each PCG will be detailed in a term sheet \nin line with the parameters described in the project documents, subject to approval from the \nDirector General of PSOD and the ADB Guarantee Committee. Each PCG agreement will follow \na  standardized  format  and  detail  the  requirement  for  regular  reporting,  as  well  as  prompt \ninformation on any potential losses or defaults in the portfolio. ADB will monitor the utilization of \nthe PCG facility through regular on-site review of the PFIs\u2019 exposure to SMEs, especially the \nportfolio quality underwritten by the PFIs and completion of agreed business targets indicated in \nthe business plans, and will require compliance with ADB negative lists. ADB has the option to \nmodify  existing  guarantee  parameters,  with  adequate  notice,  or  suspend  new  SME  loan \ninclusions under the guaranteed portfolio. \n \n9.  Prior to the implementation of any specific guarantee activity, PSOD will produce an \ninternal strategy paper to be approved by the Director General of PSOD, which will be based on \na survey of best practices for SME lending from both multilateral, US and European sources. \nThe  paper  will  describe  how  ADB's  participation  will  improve  the  current  SME  lending \nenvironment and practices in the Philippines. The paper will articulate the procedures and \nguidelines for SME co-lending that will be the basis of negotiation with any PFI and address all \naspects of risk management of ADB's exposure including credit analysis, scoring and approval, \n                                                 \n3  The first such PCG facility was approved by the ADB Board on 19 December 2003 under the Pakistan SME Sector \nDevelopment Program (ADB. **Year**. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on \n{a} Proposed Loan{s} {and Technical Assistance Grant(s)} to the {full name for DMC} for {project title}. Manila.), \nwhich follows a similar approach. \n ", "44  Appendix 6 \nloss provisioning and write off policies. It will detail the reporting requirements of any PFI and \nthe legal structure of such a relationship including termination provisions. PSOD shall be able to \nmonitor any PFI SME loan portfolio and arrive at objective credit judgments on individual credits \nas needed as well as the overall portfolio. \n \n10.  Loss  Determination,  Adjustment,  and  Claims  Payment.  Risks guaranteed under \neach  PCG  are  losses,  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  loss-sharing  ratios,  resulting  from \nirrecoverable principal and/or interest payment default on loans included in the guaranteed \nportfolio.  Losses  are  determined  by  the  PFI  in  a  transparent  manner,  which  will  include \nappropriate documentation of defaults of loans included in the guaranteed portfolio. ADB will \nreimburse the PFI for the guaranteed percentage of losses arising from guaranteed risks. \nClaims will be paid in pesos, subject to the limit of the PCG for that PFI. \n \n11.  Safeguard Policies. The PCG facility is classified as \u201cfinancial intermediary\u201d for the \npurpose  of  compliance  with  ADB  safeguard  policies.  ADB  will  establish  an  environment \nmanagement system, specified for each PFI under the guarantee agreement to ensure PFIs\u2019 \nadherence  to  ADB  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines \n(2003);  as  well  as  to  ADB  policies  on  involuntary  resettlement,  indigenous  peoples,  and \nprocurement. ADB will also require PFIs under the guarantee agreements to acknowledge in \nprogress reports that all borrowers comply with health, safety, and environmental regulations \nand standards, as well as public consultation requirements applicable in the Philippines. Since \nthe PFIs\u2019 loans to SMEs will be largely in the service, trade, and light-manufacturing sector, \ninvoluntary  resettlement  or  detrimental  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  are  unlikely.  As  for \nenvironmental safeguards, ADB\u2019s due diligence will identify areas for remedy, including negative \nlists and training as necessary.  \n ", "Appendix 7         45\nSUMMARY OF THE INDICATIVE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PARTIAL CREDIT \nGUARANTEE FACILITY  \n \n \nFacility  A revolving local currency partial credit guarantee facility issued to \n  participating financial institutions (PFIs), covering an agreed level of \nguaranteed risks associated with their portfolio of loans (and or other \ncredit) provided to small and medium enterprise (SME) customers \nunder the facility.  \n \nMaximum Guaranteed  The maximum aggregate liability of the Asian Development Bank \nAmount   (ADB) under the facility will not exceed P500 million per PFI\u2014the \nmaximum  guaranteed  amount.  The  maximum  aggregate  liability \nstated  will  constitute  claims  on  loss  of  principal  and/or  interest \npayments.  \n \nGuarantor  ADB will be the sole guarantor.  \n \nGuaranteed Risks  A  credit  loss  resulting  from  the  nonpayment  by  the  borrower \ncontinuing for a certain period as specified under the claim event \nsection. \n \nLevel of Guaranteed  Up to 50% of the guaranteed loan portfolio, which would allow the \nRisks  guaranteed portfolio to increase in value up to P1 billion.  \n \nADB will negotiate a first loss provision with the PFI, computed as a \npercent of the guaranteed loan portfolio. The first loss amount is \nequivalent to the PFI\u2019s aggregate SME portfolio\u2019s loss experience in \nthe past 3 years. ADB and the PFI will cover losses above this level \nequally. \n \nAvailability Period  New loans may be added to the guaranteed portfolio for up to 5 \nyears from the date of signing legal documentation. This availability \nperiod  may  be  extended  upon  mutual  consent,  subject  to \napplicability and relevance under prevailing market conditions. \n \nFacility Term  Each  loan  guaranteed  under  the  facility  may  have  a  maximum \nrepayment term of up to 3 years depending on its risk profile. As \nsuch, the facility will have a maximum tenor of up to 8 years.  \n \nGuaranteed Loan  The  PFI  will  bear  the  risk  of  the  unguaranteed  portion  of  the \nPortfolio  guaranteed loan portfolio to the full extent, i.e., there should be no \ninsurance  (except  for  property  and  casualty  insurance),  no \ngovernment guarantee nor any other instrument that reduces the \nPFI's exposure on the guaranteed portfolio to a lower amount. \n \n \nGuaranteed Borrowers  The guaranteed borrowers will be carefully selected SMEs in the \nPhilippines (the SME definition of the PFI will apply), which meet \nprudent credit evaluation and due diligence guidelines established \nby the PFI and acceptable to the guarantor. The PFI will retain the \n ", "46  Appendix 7 \nflexibility to change the selection criteria with approval of ADB if \nmarket conditions warrant such a change. \n \nGuaranteed Loans  The maximum exposure per borrower will be up to the aggregate \namount of P25 million. This translates to a maximum guaranteed \namount of P12.5 million per borrower.  \n \nThe maximum tenor is 3 years. \n \nDepending on the particular business strategy and focus of the PFI, \nthe facility will be used to \n \n(i)  open import letters of credit,  \n(ii)  provide short-term working capital loans,  \n(iii)  offer bank guarantee facilities,  \n(iv)  provide trade finance loans to borrowers,  \n(v)  finance equipment, \n  (vi)  finance leases,  \n   (vii)  acquire goods and services, and  \n(viii)  for the provision of any other types of credits as agreed \nby the PFI and the guarantor. \n \nCosts  All external advisory and expert fees, including legal fees, incurred in \n  relation to this facility will be paid by the PFI within 10 working days \n  after receipt of such invoice. The guarantor will engage external \n  experts or advisers only with the prior written consent of the PFI and \n  on terms and conditions acceptable to the PFI, including the experts\u2019 \n  or  advisers\u2019  scope  of  work,  the  agreed  rates,  and  billing \n  arrangements (such approval will not be unreasonably withheld). \n   \nClaim Event and  (i)  Upon ADB\u2019s confirmation that the first loss amount has been \nProcedure  exceeded, the PFI writes a demand letter. This will allow the \n  PFI to draw on the partial credit guarantee facility subject to \n  the following: \n   \n  (ii)  A  specific  guaranteed  loan  in  the  PFI's  guaranteed  loan \n  portfolio has been called back by the PFI, and the PFI has \n  notified  the  guarantor  that  such  loan  amount  has  been \n  outstanding or not fully recovered for a period exceeding 180 \n  days since the guaranteed loan was called back; or \n   \n  (iii)  A borrower is declared bankrupt or insolvent and the PFI has \n  notified  the  guarantor  that  such  loan  amount  has  been \n  outstanding or not fully recovered for a period exceeding 180 \n  days since such event; and \n   \n  (iv)  The  PFI  notifies  the  guarantor  of  the  unrecovered, \n  outstanding  exposure  of  the  PFI  related  to  the  specific \n  guaranteed loan as of the date when the loan was called \n  back plus 180 days; \n   \n ", "Appendix 7         47\n  (v)  The PFI confirms that no event of default has occurred (see \n  below for a definition);  \n   \n  (vi)  The  PFI  submits  to  the  guarantor  copies  of  all  legal \n  documentation relating to the specific guaranteed loan; \n   \n  (vii)  The PFI requests a disbursement under the partial credit \n  guarantee facility in an amount pro rata of the guarantor' risk \n  sharing of the loss amount. \n   \n  (viii)  Once the Guarantor has paid his portion of the loss amount \n  as notified by the PFI as of the date the loan has been called \n  back plus 180 days, the payment obligation of the guarantor \n  under the partial credit guarantee facility in respect of such \n  relevant guaranteed loan will be terminated.

Ownership \n \n1.  The credit information bureau (CIB) will initially be established as a corporate entity \nunder the Corporation Code and it is anticipated that the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) will \nown up to 49%. ADB, related industry associations and specific strategic investors will be invited \nto have an equity stake. The total project cost is estimated to be maximum $4 million. \n \n2.  The purpose of making CIB a private corporation majority owned by the BSP is to strike \na balance between the credibility and integrity that the BSP ownership would add and the \nnecessity of giving CIB sufficient flexibility to conduct its operation in an efficient manner. The \nBSP involvement will also ensure the comprehensive collection of data from the banking sector \nand their affiliates/subsidiaries. Industry associations have also been identified as possible \nowners of the bureau instead of individual banks or other lending institutions to rule out the \npossible conflicts of interest. ADB, on the other hand, will provide the needed international \ncredibility  and  stability.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  establishment  of  credit  bureaus  in  other \ncountries1 will also improve investor and user confidence in CIB\u2019s operations.  \n \nB.  Supervision  \n \n3.  The Monetary Board2 will oversee the operation of CIB and promulgate the implementing \nrules and regulations (IRR). It will ensure compliance with various provisions of the proposed \nCredit Information Systems Act (CISA) specifically covering the following: (i) restrictions on the \nuse and transfer of credit information, (ii) rights of borrowers to access their respective credit \ninformation and dispute the factual accuracy of the same, and (iii) sanctions to be imposed by \nCIB on submitting entities for non reporting, delayed/ erroneous reporting and on accessing \nentities for breach of confidentiality, misuse of credit information.  \n \nC.  Organization Structure and Management \n \n4.  CIB will have a board of directors and ADB will have the right to be represented. CIB will \nhire a chief executive officer with relevant financial sector experience who will run the day-to-\nday operations. The chief executive officer will be supported by a team of senior officers from \nthe private sector. \n \nD.  Business Strategy \n \n1.  Corporate Strategy and Scope of Operation \n \n5.  CIB is intended to function as the repository of all relevant credit information including \ntax and insurance history of corporate, individual, and microfinance borrowers.

The Credit Information System will cover all borrowers. The borrowers would then have \nthe right to know the credit information about them and will be able to dispute inaccurate \ninformation.  \n \nE.  Justification and/or Development Impact \n \n1.  Support of Financial Sector Development  \n \n9.  The  proposed  investment  helps  develop  a  sound  credit  risk  management  practice \namong the lenders and borrowers, consequently contributing to a more stable financial system. \nThe lenders\u2019 improved access to accurate and reliable credit information will enable them to \nmake more informed credit decisions. CIB will also strengthen credit discipline of the borrowers. \n \n2.  Indirectly  Improve  Credit  Access  and  Borrowing  Cost  of  Underserved \nMarket \n \n10.  The availability of credit information and debt service track record of all borrowers will \nassist in shifting the existing credit appraisal focus on collateral. This is particularly the case for \nlower-tiered borrowers such as small and medium enterprises and microfinance entities. The \nability to obtain consolidated and reliable information from one source also assists in reducing \nprocessing  time  and  costs  to  the  lenders,  which  will  in  turn  reduce  financing  cost  of  the \nborrower. \n \n3.  Catalytic and Demonstration Effect  \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s investment is perceived as helping attract private sector equity investors and \nemploy professional management. This is particularly beneficial for CIB in the event that its \ninitial public offering plan moves forward. \n \nF.  Risks and Safeguards \n \n1.  Insufficient Demand for CIB\u2019s Services \n \n12.  The success and profitability of CIB will depend on the level of utilization of the identified \naccessing entities. Factors affecting utilization include competition from other credit information \nproviders, bureau integrity and poor service quality. The presence of BSP as well as the ADB as \nequity investors augurs well in initially providing integrity to CIB. To raise credibility in the market \nand ensure service quality, it must employ competent management with sufficient experience in \nthis field.  \n \n2.  Data Integrity  \n \n13.  In a centralized credit information system, inaccurate and disparaging credit information \ncould result in devastating financial consequences for the person or institution involved.  In the \noriginal  scheme  contemplated,  the  basic  safeguard  is  the  right  of  borrowers  to  know  the \ninformation about them so that they will be able to protect themselves. Moreover, the Monetary \nBoard, through the implementing rules and regulations, will prescribe administrative sanctions \non accessing entities and other parties who breached the confidentiality of, or misuse, the data. \nThe sanctions contemplated could be in the nature of fines and/or denial of access to the \nsystem. As the bureau\u2019s major shareholder, BSP can exercise influence within the board and \nensure that the quality and accuracy of the information are being maintained. \n ", "54  Appendix 9 \n3.  Regulatory and Supervision \n \n14.  Key to CIB\u2019s continued viability is the ability to collect accurate information in a timely \nmanner.

Grant Development Objective(s) and Expected Key Performance Indicators \nThe Project will support the Philippine Government\u2019s initiative to develop the Philippine business registry \n(PBR). The PBR aims to reduce the cost of doing business and improve the business climate in the \nPhilippines, and it is comprises (i) a web-based business registration system to cover all legal business \nestablishments under different authorities, and (ii) a service tool for trade and business development \nfacilitation.  \n \nThe project has three phases: (i) phase I: the various business databases of Department of Trade and \nIndustry (DTI) including those of the Board of Investments (BOI) will be upgraded and harmonized with \nthe business registration system of the Securities Exchange Commission; (ii) phase II: the integrated \ndatabases developed under phase 1 will be linked to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, Social Security \nSystem, Philippine Economic Zone Authority, and selected local government units (LGUs) that are \nprepared for the e-government initiative through a registry system, providing a common interagency \nreference and validation point; a PBR portal will be established; and (iii) phase III, entry points to other \nLGUs and e-ready organizations such as Department of Labor and Employment, Philippine Health \nInsurance Corporation, and one-stop business centers such as small and medium enterprise (SME) \ncenters will be increased. A business facilitation system will be developed as an integral complementary \nfunction of the PBR, and installed in SME centers and LGUs as the delivery channels in this phase.  \n \nThe  project  will  (i)  improve  governance  by  reducing  discretional  manual  processes  in  business \nregistration; (ii) enhance the efficiency of business registration procedures through interfacing DTI system \nwith  other  systems;  (iii)  improve  the  policymaking,  monitoring,  and  marketing  functions  of  the \nGovernment using a knowledge management tool to generate various statistical and analytical reports; \n(iv) promote business opportunities within domestic and international trade through a business facilitation \nplatform; and (v) help business enterprises lower their operational costs by streamlining submission of \ninformation to various Government agencies and others. \n \nPBR  is  in  line  with  the  e-government  Initiatives,  which  will  apply  information  and  communication \ntechnology to various government projects to enhance the quality and efficiency of government services \nto the public and the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan 2004\u20132010, which calls for efficient \ngovernment-to-business and government-to-government transactions. Moreover, it supports the 10-point \nagenda of President Arroyo on item 1, 5, and 7, namely job creation, developing digital infrastructure, and \ndeveloping Subic and Clark bases. \n \nThe project will help the Government implement phases I and III of the PBR development plan.  \n \nExpected Key Performance Indicators (maximum 5 indicators): \n(cid:131)  Number of business entities registered in the database \n(cid:131)  Time required for business registration \n(cid:131)  Number of users accessing PBR for business registration and business facilitation services \n(cid:131)  Success rate of business enterprises \n(cid:131)  Statistical and analytical reports for improved policymaking, monitoring, and marketing functions \nof Government  \n ", "56  Appendix 11 \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Philippines: The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) poverty  reduction strategy recognizes support to SMEs as a key aspect of fighting poverty. The Philippines \npoverty partnership agreement states that \u201cin order to achieve the poverty reduction priorities of the agreement the \ngovernment agrees to encourage broad-based growth and equitable development, credit support for small and \nmedium enterprises (SMEs) will be extended in partnership with the private sector and civil society to create jobs, \nespecially in the rural areas, and to provide the basis for expanding the domestic market.\u201d For its part ADB agrees \u201cto \nsupport Government efforts to increase the efficiency of financial markets and reform industrial policy in order that \nresources may be allowed to flow towards the more competitive and productive sectors of the economy, particularly \nmicroenterprises, SMEs and rural enterprises.\u201d \nThe proposed project is in line with the poverty partnership agreement. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention  \n \nThe Project is designed to respond to the Government\u2019s SME Development Plan which targets SMEs specifically and \nSME development in turn is a key sector in meeting the trade and investment targets set in the Government\u2019s Medium \nTerm Philippine Development Plan 2004\u20132010. The Project is a growth oriented and  aimed at and expected to \ncontribute to an improved enabling environment for SMEs, increased employment opportunities, generate personal \nincome and tax revenues through its support for nationwide business development. SMEs are expected to benefit \nfrom better access to finance and augmented availability of finance. The project preparatory assistance (PPTA) report \nprovided estimates of job creation based on previous lending. During 1994\u20131997 under the wholesale lending window \nP1 million lent generated 3.18 additional jobs, while under the retail window 1999\u20132003 P1 million lent generated 6.74 \nadditional jobs. Using that as a guide a static calculation points to at least 3,500 and 1,800 additional jobs under the \ntwo lending windows. However, any estimates can only give indicative figures given the variety of SMEs in terms of \nlabor intensity. The expected increase in jobs represents only a small number of the Government\u2019s overall target of \ncreating at least 6 million jobs (including 3 million entrepreneurs) by 2010. However increased SME activity can also \nhave positive indirect effects on job creation. Thus the impact on poverty is through expected direct and indirect job \ncreation as a result of successful project implementation.  \n \n \nC.
