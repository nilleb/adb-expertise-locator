It  will  rehabilitate  three \nsmall hydropower plants (SHPs) on Upolu and construct three new SHPs on Upolu and Savai\u2019i. \nThe  project  will  also  provide  training  to the  Electric  Power  Corporation  (EPC)  on  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of the SHPs for up to two years after plant commissioning.3  The project will \nresult in greater energy security and sustainability for Samoa. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nSamoa is a Pacific island country divided into the two main islands of Upolu and Savai\u2019i \n3. \nand  two  minor  outer  islands,  with  a  total  population  of  188,000  people.  About  70%  of  the \npopulation  lives  on  Upolu,  the  main  island  and  location  of  the  capital,  Apia.  Around  95%  of \nhouseholds have access to grid electricity, while the remaining 5% are connected to small diesel \ngenerators or solar systems in urban and rural areas. Samoa had a total installed grid-connected \npower capacity in 2012 of about 42 megawatts (MW), composed of 30 MW diesel generators, 11 \nMW hydropower plants, one MW biofuel power plant, and small distributed solar plants in the few \nkilowatt range. Samoa\u2019s electricity consumption is about 90 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per year.   \n \n4. \nSamoa is heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels. In 2012, total fuel imports amounted to \nabout  95  million  liters,  or  10%  of  Samoa\u2019s  total  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).4 This  heavy \nreliance  is  reflected  in  Samoa\u2019s  electricity generation  matrix,  in  which  60.0%  is generated from \ndiesel,  38.9%  hydropower,  1.0%  biofuel  (coconut  oil),  and  0.1%  solar.  For  EPC,  Samoa\u2019s  sole \npower  utility,  imported  fuel  is  by  far  the  single  largest  expense  item,  representing  74%  of  total \ngeneration costs and 51% of overall costs. The new and rehabilitated hydropower capacity to be \nprovided by the project will save about 3.6 million liters of diesel per year. \n \n5. \nSamoa is also vulnerable to natural disasters and the potential effects of climate change. \nCyclone  Evan  made  landfall  in  Upolu  on  13  December  2012,  seriously  damaging  the  island\u2019s \npower generation and distribution systems. Following the government\u2019s request for support from \ndevelopment  partners  for  a  post-disaster  needs  assessment,  ADB  and  other  organizations \nfielded  a  joint  mission  in  January  2013.  The  post-disaster  needs  assessment,  completed  in \nMarch  2013,  included  an  inventory  of  damage  to  the  power  distribution  grid  and  three \nhydropower plants. The Recovery Framework that emerged from the assessment was approved \n\n                                                 \n1   Contributors: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain and Sweden. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.    \n3   ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB 2013. Technical Assistance to Samoa for Preparing the \nRenewable  Energy  and  Power  Sector  Rehabilitation  Project.  Manila  (TA  8308-SAM  for  $750,000  approved  on 20 \nDecember 2012, financed by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund-other sources). \n\n4  About 67% was consumed by the transport sector; 21% was used for electricity generation; and the remaining 12% \n\nwas consumed by the commercial, agriculture, forestry, and residential sectors. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nby  the  cabinet  of  Samoa  in  March  2013,  prioritizing  rehabilitation  of the  hydropower  plants  and \nrecognizing the need to increase resilience.  \n \n6. \nThe power sector in Samoa is well governed and managed. Operating responsibilities for \nmanaging  the  sector  are  vested  in  EPC,  a  wholly  government-owned  corporation  and  the  sole \nutility  in  the  power  sector,  with  the  main  objective  of  operating  as  a  commercial  business.  The \nElectricity  Act,  2010  provides  the  legal  framework  for  regulating  the  electricity  sector,  including \nthe  establishment  of  the  Office  of  the  Electricity  Regulator  to  set  and  monitor  electricity  tariffs. \nThe reliance on imported fuel is reflected in EPC\u2019s high average electricity tariff, which as of June \n2013 was $0.41 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) (ST0.9877/kWh). Under the regulations, EPC can pass \non  fuel  costs  directly  to  consumers  and  charge  an  inflation-indexed  non-fuel  tariff.  The  tariff \ntherefore  consists  of  a  base  energy  rate,  or  non-fuel  component,  of  $0.31/kWh;  and  a  variable \nfuel  surcharge  component,  currently  $0.10/kWh.  The  non-fuel  component  covers  operational \ncosts, overhead expenses, and depreciation of equipment.    \n \n7. \nFinancing for the project will be partially through ADB\u2019s Disaster Response Facility (DRF). \nDuring the 10th replenishment of the Asian Development Fund (ADF XI), ADB and ADF donors \nagreed to pilot test the DRF in the ADF XI period, 2013\u20132016.5 The DRF policy provides that, in \nthe  event  of  a  natural  disaster,  an  ADF-only  country  can  access  up  to  100%  of  its  annual \nperformance-based allocation from the DRF to respond to disasters. The government has sought \nADB\u2019s  assistance  in  rehabilitating  the  hydropower  plants  damaged  by  Evan,  and  requested \naccess  to  ADB\u2019s  DRF,  which  is  justified  given  the  severity  of  the  cyclone  that  caused  damage \nand  loss  equivalent  to  28%  of  GDP.  This  project  will  be  the  first  for  which  ADB  is  providing \nassistance from the DRF. \n \n8. \nThe proposed project will support the government\u2019s efforts to reduce Samoa\u2019s reliance on \nimported fossil fuels for power generation by providing a secure, sustainable, and clean source \nof electricity. The project will construct, install, and rehabilitate SHPs with an overall capacity of \n5.50  MW  on  Upolu  and  Savai\u2019i.  The  proposed  project  will  enhance  EPC\u2019s  O&M  programs \nthrough  a  capacity  building  and  knowledge  transfer  program  to  last  up  to  2  years  after  SHP \ncommissioning. Technical designs will ensure climate and disaster resilience.  \n \nADB has solid experience in the power sector in Samoa. In 2007, with ADB\u2019s support, the \n9. \ngovernment prepared the Power Sector Expansion Project (PSEP).6 The PSEP is improving the \nquality, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of power supply by supporting EPC\u2019s investment plan to \nmeet  growing  demand,  improving  the  financial  performance  and  operational  efficiency  of  EPC, \nand  establishing  effective  regulation  of  the  power  sector.  The  PSEP  also  developed  feasibility \nstudies for a number of SHPs, some of which are part of the proposed project.  \n  \n10. \nThe government\u2019s Strategy for the Development of Samoa, 2012\u20132016; its Energy Sector \nPlan,  2013\u20132016;  and  EPC\u2019s  corporate  plan,  2013\u20132015  all  emphasize  developing  indigenous \nand  renewable  energy  resources  as  a  high  development  priority  to  reduce  the  economy\u2019s  risk \nexposure  to  foreign  exchange  fluctuations  and  fuel  price  increases.  The  project  is  in  line  with \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016 for Samoa, which makes energy a priority \narea of support and sets a primary goal of reducing the country\u2019s dependence on imported fossil \nfuels by generating power from its own renewable energy sources.7 \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2012.

The executing agency will be the Ministry of \n15. \nFinance  (MOF).  The  implementing  agency  will  be  EPC.  The  existing  project  management  unit \n(PMU)  and  project  steering  committee (PSC)  established  under the  PSEP  will  be  continued for \nthe implementation of the project.11   \n\n                                                 \n8  Financing  will  include  all  goods,  works,  associated services  for  design  and engineering,  supply  and  installation  of \nequipment,  construction  works,  commissioning  and  O&M  knowledge  transfer  program;  the  project  owner\u2019s \nengineers; and sea, air, and land transportation cost (national and international), including insurance and freight to \nproject sites and warehouses.  \n\n9  A country\u2019s eligibility for ADF grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its risk of debt distress. The \nlatest debt sustainability analysis determined that Samoa had a high risk of debt distress and was therefore eligible \nto receive 100% of its ADF allocation as grants. The government will receive $1 million in insurance compensation \nfor damages caused by Evan to the Samasoni, Alaoa, and Fale o Fee SHPs, which will be part of the government\u2019s \ncontribution  to  the  project.  In  the  event  the  government  receives  any  additional  insurance  compensation  for \ndamages caused by Evan to these SHPs and associated power system components and power distribution grid, the \nfull  amount  of  any  such  additional  insurance  compensation,  over  the  ADF  grant  amount  allocated  to  the \nrehabilitation  component,  shall  be  used  to  finance  any  additional  scope  of  the  rehabilitation  component  of  the \nproject, and to reduce the amount of DRF grant proceeds allocated to the rehabilitation component, as appropriate.  \n10 Other  development  partners  have  signaled  a  strong  interest  in  cofinancing  the  project.  At  the  time  of  ADB  grant \nnegotiations  with  the  government,  the  cofinancing  was  not  yet  approved  by  the  respective  governments  and \ntherefore was not included in this report as cofinancing under the project. Upon donor cofinancing being confirmed, \nthe scope of the project may be enlarged to cover additional new SHPs, with processing made in accordance with \nADB. 2010. Additional Financing: Enhancing Development Effectiveness. Manila. \n\n11 The  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  MOF  and  composed  of  representatives  of  EPC;  the  Ministry  of  Natural \nResources and Environment; the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Labour; the Office of the Attorney General; the \nSamoa Water  Authority;  and  the  Ministry  of Women  and  Social  Development.  The committee  will  oversee  project \nimplementation, support sustainability, and ensure effective assistance to all project stakeholders and beneficiaries. \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nProcurement  of  goods,  works,  services  and  the  consultancy  component  of  the  turnkey \n16. \ncontractor will be conducted through a single turnkey contract.12 The turnkey contract will include \nfinal  design  and  engineering,  supply  and  installation  of  equipment,  construction  works  and \ncommissioning,  and  an  O&M  knowledge  transfer  program  for  at  least  2  years  after  plant \ncommissioning. The rationale is to cover 1 year of normal guarantee time of equipment and one \nadditional year of the hydrology cycle for conducting any needed system upgrades.  \n \n17.   Efficient  project  implementation  related  to  the  turnkey  contract  will  be  provided  by  the \nproject owner\u2019s engineers, and will include preparation of bidding documents; assistance during \nthe  bidding  process;  and  supervision  of  the  project  design,  supply,  construction,  and \ncommissioning.  EPC  has  requested  ADB  to  help  select  the  engineers,  which  will  assist  EPC \nduring procurement of the turnkey contract. The engineers will have expertise on implementation \nand  supervision  of  small  hydropower  projects  and  will  be  engaged  using  the  fixed  budget \nselection  method,  which  is  considered  justified  because  of  the  project\u2019s  technical  complexity. \nProcurement of consultancy services will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Goods and works will be procured \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). Minor \ngoods  and  services  costing  under  the  equivalent  of  $100,000  will  be  procured  by  the \nimplementing  agency  through  shopping  procedures  and  direct  payment.  The  government, \nthrough EPC, will own the SHPs.  \n \n18. \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  with  completion  estimated  in  December \n2018.  To  expedite  implementation,  the  government  has  requested,  and  ADB  has  approved, \nadvance  procurement  action  for  goods,  works,  and  consultancy  services.

The  equipment \ndesign options have been carefully analyzed based on best engineering practices. Constructed \nin line with quality standards specifically conceived for hard marine environments and conditions, \nthe selected design calls for the project to provide complete preassembled middle-voltage switch \ngear and control equipment. The design of the SHPs will incorporate adequate climate-proofing \nmeasures  to  lessen  the  potential  negative  impacts  of  extreme  weather  events  (e.g.,  cyclones) \nthroughout  the  life  cycle  of  the  project.  All  equipment  will  be  provided  with  remote  control, \nmonitoring,  and  protection  systems  standard  in  the  SHP  industry,  saving  O&M  costs  and \nrequirements  for  technical  personnel.  The  turnkey  contractor  will  provide  specialized  O&M \nknowledge transfer to EPC staff to ensure sustainable operation. \n\nThe capacity of the project\u2019s new and rehabilitated SHPs will be smoothly synchronized \n20. \nand  integrated  into  the  existing  electricity  networks,  since  hydropower  produces  base  load \nelectricity  without  intermittence.  This  will  contribute  to  a  sustainable,  stable,  and  reliable \nelectricity  system,  allowing  diesel  generation  to  shut  down  at  off-peak  hours,  and  the  existing \ndiesel  units  to  perform  at  their  optimum  fuel  consumed  to  electricity  generated  ratio.  The  new \nand  rehabilitated  SHPs  under  the  project  will  also  complement  future  planned  new  solar \nphotovoltaic, wind, and biomass power generating facilities, contributing to the utility\u2019s least-cost \ndevelopment.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nAll  financial  costs  and  benefits  have  been  expressed  in  mid-2013  prices.  The  project \nfinancial analysis quantifies costs and benefits of the project for the implementing agency of the \nproject  and  for  the  investment  project  as  a  whole.  Project  financial  costs  include  (i)  the  initial \ncosts of the hardware and electrical works needed for the installation and integration of the new \nand  rehabilitated  SHPs  with  the  existing  electrical  grid;  (ii)  annual  and  periodic  O&M \nexpenditures,  excluding  those  needed  for  replacement  parts;  and  (iii)  consulting  services \nrequired for design, tendering, training, and project supervision. The financial costs exclude the \nprice contingencies.  \n \nA  financial  appraisal  of  the  project  was  undertaken  using  with-  and  without-project \n22. \nscenarios  over  a  25-year  operational  period,  with  the  residual  value  at  the  end  of  this  period \nassumed as zero. In the interest of a conservative analysis, no tariff increase was assumed. The \nproject\u2019s financial internal rate of return is estimated to be 15.00%. This compares favorably with \nthe estimated weighted average cost of capital at 9.23%, indicating that the project is financially \nviable.  The  sensitivity  tests  showed  robust  results  for  all  scenarios,  with  the  resulting  financial \ninternal  rates  of  return  exceeding  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  9.23%.  Sensitivity \nanalyses were undertaken on the financial and economic results to examine the impacts of the \nfollowing changes to key assumptions and project risks: (i) an implementation delay of 1 year, (ii) \na  10%  reduction  in  hydropower  generation,  (iii) a  15%  reduction  in  hydropower  generation,  (iv) \nan increase in replacement costs of 10%, (v) a 10% drop in diesel prices, (vi) a 10% increase in \ndiesel  prices,  and  (vii)  a  combination  of  a  15%  reduction  in  generation  and  a  10%  increase  in \nO&M costs. The project remains financially  viable under each of these scenarios, with financial \ninternal rates of return of 12.09%\u201315.00%. \n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nEconomic  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  new  and  rehabilitated  SHP  project \n23. \ncomponents by comparing the discounted costs and benefits under the with- and without-project \nscenarios  over  2014\u20132041  in  constant  2013  prices.  The  without-project  case  represents  a \ncontinuation of the existing situation, and the with-project case represents the project investment \nscenario.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  estimated  to  be  31.08%.  The  EIRR \ncompares favorably with the 12% economic opportunity cost of capital, indicating that the project \nis economically viable. Under the same scenarios considered in the sensitivity analysis, the EIRR \nremains robust at 25.69%\u201326.37%.  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nFinancial  management.  To  facilitate  cash  flow  during  project  implementation,  the \n24. \nexecuting  agency  will  approve  and  submit  to  ADB  withdrawal  applications  from  the  PMU, \nassisted by the project owner\u2019s engineers for direct payment procedure for most project goods, \nworks,  services,  and  the  consultancy  component  of  the  turnkey  contractor.  Disbursements  of \ngrant funds under the project will be to procure goods, works, services, and related consultancy \ncomponent  of  the  turnkey  contractor.  A  financial  management  assessment  of  EPC\u2019s  internal \ncontrols  and  accounting  and  audit  procedures  was  undertaken.  EPC\u2019s  financial  management \npractices  and  procedures  are  considered to  be generally  adequate for  both the  implementation \nand operational phases of the project. The PMU established within EPC is responsible for project \nfinancial  management  and  accounting.  The  PMU  utilizes  EPC\u2019s  existing  financial  management \nand accounting systems in undertaking these functions. EPC\u2019s accounts and reporting structures \nare based on international financial reporting standards. \n \nProcurement  capacity.  A  procurement  capacity  assessment  was  completed,  which \n25. \nindicates  that  Samoa\u2019s  procurement  regulations  and  procedures  are  comprehensive.  Even \nthough  EPC  has  a  functioning  procurement  unit,  it  would  still  benefit  from  the  expertise  of  the \nturnkey  contractor.  ADB  will  review  the  project\u2019s  procurement  processes.  The  PMU  is  also \nresponsible  for  the  PSEP,  which  is  still  under  implementation  and  thus  has  recent  experience \nwith ADB procurement policies.  \n \n26. \nwith the government, MOF, and EPC. \n \nD. \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe  project  is  classified  as  general  intervention  as  it  indirectly  addresses  poverty \n27. \nreduction.  The  proposed  project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  reconnecting  to  the  grid \nSHPs  damaged  during  Evan,  and  by  reducing  the  country\u2019s  reliance  on  volatile  and  costly \nimported fossil fuels for power generation. The public and businesses will benefit as the project \nwill allow EPC to provide high-quality services at lower costs. The generation of electricity from \nhydropower  will  help  reducing  in  Samoa\u2019s  dependence  on  imported  fossil  fuels  for  power \ngeneration. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  as  some  gender  elements.  It  will  not  directly  improve  women\u2019s \n28. \naccess  to  social,  economic,  and  financial  resources.  The  project  will  employ  at  least  15%  of \nfemale workforce in the project area, including professional staff for local construction contracts \nfor  hydropower  installations,  which  will  offer  equal  pay  for  equal  work.  The  resettlement  plan \nincludes  women\u2019s  participation  in  all  project  consultations,  disclosure,  detail  measurement \nsurvey, inventory of loss survey, and compensation to both men and women in the household.  \n \n\n\f8 \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\nin \n\nresult \n\nflooding  of \n\nthe  powerhouse  and  damage \n\n29. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  Initial  environmental  examinations  have  been  prepared  for \nthe new and rehabilitation SHP schemes in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009).  The  project  has  been  classified  as  category  B  for  environment  following  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  Initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  have  been  prepared  for \nthe  new  and  rehabilitation  SHP  schemes.  Environmental  flows  have  been  determined  and  no \nsignificant impacts are expected on the existing fish and aquatic resources or riparian habitats as \na result of the project provided that the specified minimum environmental flows are released into \nthe rivers at all times. The main potential environmental impacts will be created by the weirs and \nrun-of-river schemes, upgrading of the access roads, and installation of short sections of cables \nfor  grid  connection.  Impacts  may  include  land  clearing,  earthworks,  dust,  noise,  vegetation \nclearance,  materials  sourcing  and  transportation,  waste  disposal  and  discharges,  and  effects \nassociated with upgrading of access roads. \n \n30. \nClimate change adaptation and resilience measures will be incorporated in the design of \nthe  SHP  structures,  including  suitable  erosion  protection  to  prevent  scour  around  the  intakes. \nThe level of the powerhouse discharge outlet needs to be sufficiently high to prevent any flood-\ninduced  backflow \nto \nthat  may \nelectromechanical equipment.  \n \n31. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The project is not expected to involve physical \ndisplacement  or  relocation  of  people.  The  rehabilitation  of  existing  SHPs  will  be  undertaken  in \nthe existing land acquired in 1921 and 1929, and will not require additional land acquisition. Due \ndiligence  for  existing  facilities  has  been  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement,  and  its  results,  including  measures  for  resolving  historical  concerns  raised  by  local \nvillagers  in  existing  sites,  are  included  in  the  resettlement  plan.  EPC,  in  coordination  with \nrelevant  government  agencies,  will \nthese  measures  during \nfinalize  and \nimplementation. New SHPs are proposed to be developed in partnership with local communities, \nand a joint venture business model is under discussion at the cabinet. The land required for new \nSHPs  is  expected  to  be  acquired  through  negotiation,  with  details  to  be  finalized  after  the \ncabinet\u2019s decision on the business model. A draft resettlement plan has been developed based \non  available  information,  in  anticipation  of  possible  land  acquisition  in  case  the  proposed  joint \nventure business model does not materialize. The resettlement plan will be updated and finalized \nafter the detailed design, including measures for further consultations and collection of detailed \nsocioeconomic information. The resettlement plan has been endorsed by EPC and posted on the \nADB website.  \n \n32. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The majority of the population in the project area are \nPolynesian people of Samoa and not considered to be distinct from the mainstream society. The \nproject  is  not  expected  to  affect  any  distinct  and  vulnerable  group  of  indigenous  peoples  as \ndefined  by  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  does  not  require  an  indigenous  peoples  plan. \nThe project outputs will be delivered in a culturally appropriate manner. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nimplement \n\n33.
