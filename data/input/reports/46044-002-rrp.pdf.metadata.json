I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) proposed \ngrants and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Multi-Donor Clean \nEnergy Fund1, under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility (CEFPF) and administered \nby  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  both  to  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa  for  the \nRenewable Energy Development and Power Sector Rehabilitation Project.2 \n \n2.  The proposed project will support the government\u2019s policy to increase power generation \nfrom renewable sources, rehabilitate damage to the power sector caused by a major cyclone, \nand increase the power sector\u2019s resilience to future natural disasters. It will rehabilitate three \nsmall hydropower plants (SHPs) on Upolu and construct three new SHPs on Upolu and Savai\u2019i. \nThe project will also provide training to the Electric Power Corporation (EPC) on operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of the SHPs for up to two years after plant commissioning.3  The project will \nresult in greater energy security and sustainability for Samoa. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Samoa is a Pacific island country divided into the two main islands of Upolu and Savai\u2019i \nand two minor outer islands, with a total population of 188,000 people. About 70% of the \npopulation lives on Upolu, the main island and location of the capital, Apia. Around 95% of \nhouseholds have access to grid electricity, while the remaining 5% are connected to small diesel \ngenerators or solar systems in urban and rural areas. Samoa had a total installed grid-connected \npower capacity in 2012 of about 42 megawatts (MW), composed of 30 MW diesel generators, 11 \nMW hydropower plants, one MW biofuel power plant, and small distributed solar plants in the few \nkilowatt range. Samoa\u2019s electricity consumption is about 90 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per year.   \n \n4.  Samoa is heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels. In 2012, total fuel imports amounted to \nabout 95 million liters, or 10% of Samoa\u2019s total gross domestic product (GDP).4 This heavy \nreliance is reflected in Samoa\u2019s electricity generation matrix, in which 60.0% is generated from \ndiesel, 38.9% hydropower, 1.0% biofuel (coconut oil), and 0.1% solar. For EPC, Samoa\u2019s sole \npower utility, imported fuel is by far the single largest expense item, representing 74% of total \ngeneration costs and 51% of overall costs. The new and rehabilitated hydropower capacity to be \nprovided by the project will save about 3.6 million liters of diesel per year. \n \n5.  Samoa is also vulnerable to natural disasters and the potential effects of climate change. \nCyclone Evan made landfall in Upolu on 13 December 2012, seriously damaging the island\u2019s \npower generation and distribution systems. Following the government\u2019s request for support from \ndevelopment  partners  for  a  post-disaster  needs  assessment,  ADB  and  other  organizations \nfielded a joint mission in January 2013. The post-disaster needs assessment, completed in \nMarch  2013,  included  an  inventory  of  damage  to  the  power  distribution  grid  and  three \nhydropower plants. The Recovery Framework that emerged from the assessment was approved \n                                                \n1   Contributors: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain and Sweden. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.    \n3  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB 2013. Technical Assistance to Samoa for Preparing the \nRenewable Energy and Power Sector Rehabilitation Project. Manila (TA 8308-SAM for $750,000 approved on 20 \nDecember 2012, financed by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund-other sources). \n4  About 67% was consumed by the transport sector; 21% was used for electricity generation; and the remaining 12% \nwas consumed by the commercial, agriculture, forestry, and residential sectors. ", "2 \n \nby the cabinet of Samoa in March 2013, prioritizing rehabilitation of the hydropower plants and \nrecognizing the need to increase resilience.  \n \n6.  The power sector in Samoa is well governed and managed. Operating responsibilities for \nmanaging the sector are vested in EPC, a wholly government-owned corporation and the sole \nutility in the power sector, with the main objective of operating as a commercial business. The \nElectricity Act, 2010 provides the legal framework for regulating the electricity sector, including \nthe establishment of the Office of the Electricity Regulator to set and monitor electricity tariffs. \nThe reliance on imported fuel is reflected in EPC\u2019s high average electricity tariff, which as of June \n2013 was $0.41 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) (ST0.9877/kWh). Under the regulations, EPC can pass \non fuel costs directly to consumers and charge an inflation-indexed non-fuel tariff. The tariff \ntherefore consists of a base energy rate, or non-fuel component, of $0.31/kWh; and a variable \nfuel surcharge component, currently $0.10/kWh. The non-fuel component covers operational \ncosts, overhead expenses, and depreciation of equipment.    \n \n7.  Financing for the project will be partially through ADB\u2019s Disaster Response Facility (DRF). \nDuring the 10th replenishment of the Asian Development Fund (ADF XI), ADB and ADF donors \nagreed to pilot test the DRF in the ADF XI period, 2013\u20132016.5 The DRF policy provides that, in \nthe event of a natural disaster, an ADF-only country can access up to 100% of its annual \nperformance-based allocation from the DRF to respond to disasters. The government has sought \nADB\u2019s assistance in rehabilitating the hydropower plants damaged by Evan, and requested \naccess to ADB\u2019s DRF, which is justified given the severity of the cyclone that caused damage \nand loss equivalent to 28% of GDP. This project will be the first for which ADB is providing \nassistance from the DRF. \n \n8.  The proposed project will support the government\u2019s efforts to reduce Samoa\u2019s reliance on \nimported fossil fuels for power generation by providing a secure, sustainable, and clean source \nof electricity. The project will construct, install, and rehabilitate SHPs with an overall capacity of \n5.50  MW  on  Upolu  and  Savai\u2019i.  The  proposed  project  will  enhance  EPC\u2019s  O&M  programs \nthrough a capacity building and knowledge transfer program to last up to 2 years after SHP \ncommissioning. Technical designs will ensure climate and disaster resilience.  \n \n9.  ADB has solid experience in the power sector in Samoa. In 2007, with ADB\u2019s support, the \ngovernment prepared the Power Sector Expansion Project (PSEP).6 The PSEP is improving the \nquality, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of power supply by supporting EPC\u2019s investment plan to \nmeet growing demand, improving the financial performance and operational efficiency of EPC, \nand establishing effective regulation of the power sector. The PSEP also developed feasibility \nstudies for a number of SHPs, some of which are part of the proposed project.  \n  \n10.  The government\u2019s Strategy for the Development of Samoa, 2012\u20132016; its Energy Sector \nPlan, 2013\u20132016; and EPC\u2019s corporate plan, 2013\u20132015 all emphasize developing indigenous \nand renewable energy resources as a high development priority to reduce the economy\u2019s risk \nexposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and fuel price increases. The project is in line with \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016 for Samoa, which makes energy a priority \narea of support and sets a primary goal of reducing the country\u2019s dependence on imported fossil \nfuels by generating power from its own renewable energy sources.7 \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2012.

The outcome will be that \ncustomers have access to a higher share of electricity generated by hydropower.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The project will have four outputs. \n \n(i)  Rehabilitation of hydropower plants in Upolu. The project will rehabilitate and \nreconnect  to  the  grid  the  three  SHPs  damaged  by  Evan,  producing  a  total \ninstalled capacity of 4.69 MW\u2014the 1.74 MW Fale ole Fee plant, the 1.05 MW \nAlaoa plant, and the 1.9 MW Samasoni plant.  \n(ii)   New hydropower plants in Upolu and Savai\u2019i. The project will build and connect \nto the existing grid the three new SHPs with a combined capacity of 0.81 MW\u2014\nthe 0.19 MW Faleaseela plant on Upolu, the 0.46 MW Tafitoala plant on Upolu, \nand the 0.16 MW Faleata plant on Savai\u2019i.  \n(iii)  Operation  and  maintenance  knowledge  transfer  program.  The project will \nprovide  capacity  development  to  EPC  through  an  O&M  knowledge  transfer \nprogram, provided by the consultancy component of the turnkey contractor. The \nproject will include preparation of an O&M manual for SHPs and theoretical and \non-the-job training on hydropower asset management, starting 3 months before \nSHP commissioning and continuing up to 2 years after SHP commissioning.  \n(iv)  Efficient project implementation. EPC will be assisted by the project owner\u2019s \nengineers.  \n  \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n13.

The government has requested grants totaling $19.21 million to finance project goods, \nworks,  and  services.8 The  grants  will  comprise  (i)  $10  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources,  (ii)  $8.21  million  from  the  DRF  under  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  and \n(iii) $1.0 million to be financed by the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund, under the CEFPF and \nadministered by ADB. The government will provide a contribution equivalent to $4.62 million.9 \nThe government will make the proceeds of the grants available to EPC under a subsidiary grant \nagreement upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. The financing plan is in Table 2.10  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank a     \nADF (grant)  10.00  41.97 \nDisaster Response Facility under ADF (grant)  8.21  34.45 \nMulti-Donor Clean Energy Fund (grant) b  1.00  4.19 \nGovernment of Samoa c  4.62  19.38 \nTotal  23.83  100.00 \nADF = Asian Development Fund, SHP = small hydropower plant. \na  The ADF grants comprise $10 million from Samoa\u2019s performance-based allocation to finance the construction of \nnew SHPs and SHP rehabilitation components, and $8.21 million from the Disaster Response Facility to finance \nthe SHP rehabilitation component. \nb Under the CEFPF and administered by the Asian Development Bank. The grant comprises $0.2 million to \nfinance the consultancy component of the turnkey contractor (estimate of 7 person-months national and 5 \nperson-months international consultancy services), and $0.8 million to finance the project owner\u2019s engineers \n(30 person-months international). Contingencies included. \nc  The government\u2019s contribution comprises $1.00 million to finance project works and services of the SHP \nrehabilitation component, and $3.62 million to finance taxes and duties.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The government will be the grant beneficiary. The executing agency will be the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF). The implementing agency will be EPC. The existing project management unit \n(PMU) and project steering committee (PSC) established under the PSEP will be continued for \nthe implementation of the project.11   \n                                                \n8  Financing will include all goods, works, associated services for design and engineering, supply and installation of \nequipment,  construction  works,  commissioning  and  O&M  knowledge  transfer  program;  the  project  owner\u2019s \nengineers; and sea, air, and land transportation cost (national and international), including insurance and freight to \nproject sites and warehouses.  \n9  A country\u2019s eligibility for ADF grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its risk of debt distress. The \nlatest debt sustainability analysis determined that Samoa had a high risk of debt distress and was therefore eligible \nto receive 100% of its ADF allocation as grants. The government will receive $1 million in insurance compensation \nfor damages caused by Evan to the Samasoni, Alaoa, and Fale o Fee SHPs, which will be part of the government\u2019s \ncontribution to the project. In the event the government receives any additional insurance compensation for \ndamages caused by Evan to these SHPs and associated power system components and power distribution grid, the \nfull  amount  of  any  such  additional  insurance  compensation,  over  the  ADF  grant  amount  allocated  to  the \nrehabilitation component, shall be used to finance any additional scope of the rehabilitation component of the \nproject, and to reduce the amount of DRF grant proceeds allocated to the rehabilitation component, as appropriate.  \n10 Other development partners have signaled a strong interest in cofinancing the project. At the time of ADB grant \nnegotiations with the government, the cofinancing was not yet approved by the respective governments and \ntherefore was not included in this report as cofinancing under the project. Upon donor cofinancing being confirmed, \nthe scope of the project may be enlarged to cover additional new SHPs, with processing made in accordance with \nADB. 2010. Additional Financing: Enhancing Development Effectiveness. Manila. \n11 The committee will be chaired by the MOF and composed of representatives of EPC; the Ministry of Natural \nResources and Environment; the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Labour; the Office of the Attorney General; the \nSamoa Water Authority; and the Ministry of Women and Social Development. The committee will oversee project \nimplementation, support sustainability, and ensure effective assistance to all project stakeholders and beneficiaries. ", "5 \n \n16.  Procurement of goods, works, services and the consultancy component of the turnkey \ncontractor will be conducted through a single turnkey contract.12 The turnkey contract will include \nfinal  design  and  engineering,  supply  and  installation  of  equipment,  construction  works  and \ncommissioning,  and  an  O&M  knowledge  transfer  program  for  at  least  2  years  after  plant \ncommissioning. The rationale is to cover 1 year of normal guarantee time of equipment and one \nadditional year of the hydrology cycle for conducting any needed system upgrades.  \n \n17.   Efficient project implementation related to the turnkey contract will be provided by the \nproject owner\u2019s engineers, and will include preparation of bidding documents; assistance during \nthe  bidding  process;  and  supervision  of  the  project  design,  supply,  construction,  and \ncommissioning. EPC has requested ADB to help select the engineers, which will assist EPC \nduring procurement of the turnkey contract. The engineers will have expertise on implementation \nand  supervision  of  small  hydropower  projects  and  will  be  engaged  using  the  fixed  budget \nselection method, which is considered justified because of the project\u2019s technical complexity. \nProcurement of consultancy services will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Goods and works will be procured \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). Minor \ngoods  and  services  costing  under  the  equivalent  of  $100,000  will  be  procured  by  the \nimplementing  agency  through  shopping  procedures  and  direct  payment.  The  government, \nthrough EPC, will own the SHPs.  \n \n18.  The project will be implemented over 5 years, with completion estimated in December \n2018. To expedite implementation, the government has requested, and ADB has approved, \nadvance  procurement  action  for  goods,  works,  and  consultancy  services.  Implementation \narrangements are in Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration manual.13  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2014\u2013December 2018 \nProject completion date  31 December 2018 \n Management   Project steering committee: MOF CEO (chair); MOF general manager (vice \n   (i)   Oversight body  chair); CEOs of Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment; Ministry of \nCommerce, Industry and Labour; Ministry of Women and Social Development; \nSamoa Water Authority; and Attorney General (members) \n   (ii)  Executing agency  MOF \n   (iii)  Implementing agency  Electric Power Corporation \n   (iv)  Implementation unit  The project management unit established under the Power Sector Expansion \nProject will serve as project management unit for the project. \nProcurement   Turnkey   One contract composed of  two lots  $19.11 million \nShopping  Three contracts  $0.30 million \nConsulting services (project  Fixed budget  30 person-months (intermittent)  $0.80 million \nowner\u2019s engineers)  selection \nAdvance contracting  For goods, works, and consultancy services \nDisbursement  All grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CEO = chief executive officer, MOF = Ministry of Finance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n                                                \n12 Since the project is financed with ADB-administered cofinancing resources, universal procurement will apply (ADB. \n2013.

The project has been assessed as technically viable, based on an extensive study of the \nload and energy demand records provided by EPC and field investigations. The equipment \ndesign options have been carefully analyzed based on best engineering practices. Constructed \nin line with quality standards specifically conceived for hard marine environments and conditions, \nthe selected design calls for the project to provide complete preassembled middle-voltage switch \ngear and control equipment. The design of the SHPs will incorporate adequate climate-proofing \nmeasures to lessen the potential negative impacts of extreme weather events (e.g., cyclones) \nthroughout the life cycle of the project. All equipment will be provided with remote control, \nmonitoring,  and  protection  systems  standard  in  the  SHP  industry,  saving  O&M  costs  and \nrequirements  for  technical  personnel.  The  turnkey  contractor  will  provide  specialized  O&M \nknowledge transfer to EPC staff to ensure sustainable operation. \n \n20.  The capacity of the project\u2019s new and rehabilitated SHPs will be smoothly synchronized \nand  integrated  into  the  existing  electricity  networks,  since  hydropower  produces  base  load \nelectricity  without  intermittence.  This  will  contribute  to  a  sustainable,  stable,  and  reliable \nelectricity system, allowing diesel generation to shut down at off-peak hours, and the existing \ndiesel units to perform at their optimum fuel consumed to electricity generated ratio. The new \nand  rehabilitated  SHPs  under  the  project  will  also  complement  future  planned  new  solar \nphotovoltaic, wind, and biomass power generating facilities, contributing to the utility\u2019s least-cost \ndevelopment.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  All financial costs and benefits have been expressed in mid-2013 prices. The project \nfinancial analysis quantifies costs and benefits of the project for the implementing agency of the \nproject and for the investment project as a whole. Project financial costs include (i) the initial \ncosts of the hardware and electrical works needed for the installation and integration of the new \nand  rehabilitated  SHPs  with  the  existing  electrical  grid;  (ii)  annual  and  periodic  O&M \nexpenditures,  excluding  those  needed  for  replacement  parts;  and  (iii)  consulting  services \nrequired for design, tendering, training, and project supervision. The financial costs exclude the \nprice contingencies.  \n \n22.  A  financial  appraisal  of  the  project  was  undertaken  using  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios over a 25-year operational period, with the residual value at the end of this period \nassumed as zero. In the interest of a conservative analysis, no tariff increase was assumed. The \nproject\u2019s financial internal rate of return is estimated to be 15.00%. This compares favorably with \nthe estimated weighted average cost of capital at 9.23%, indicating that the project is financially \nviable. The sensitivity tests showed robust results for all scenarios, with the resulting financial \ninternal rates of return exceeding the weighted average cost of capital of 9.23%. Sensitivity \nanalyses were undertaken on the financial and economic results to examine the impacts of the \nfollowing changes to key assumptions and project risks: (i) an implementation delay of 1 year, (ii) \na 10% reduction in hydropower generation, (iii) a 15% reduction in hydropower generation, (iv) \nan increase in replacement costs of 10%, (v) a 10% drop in diesel prices, (vi) a 10% increase in \ndiesel prices, and (vii) a combination of a 15% reduction in generation and a 10% increase in \nO&M costs. The project remains financially viable under each of these scenarios, with financial \ninternal rates of return of 12.09%\u201315.00%. \n ", "7 \n \n23.  Economic  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  new  and  rehabilitated  SHP  project \ncomponents by comparing the discounted costs and benefits under the with- and without-project \nscenarios  over  2014\u20132041  in  constant  2013  prices.  The  without-project  case  represents  a \ncontinuation of the existing situation, and the with-project case represents the project investment \nscenario. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated to be 31.08%. The EIRR \ncompares favorably with the 12% economic opportunity cost of capital, indicating that the project \nis economically viable. Under the same scenarios considered in the sensitivity analysis, the EIRR \nremains robust at 25.69%\u201326.37%.  \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  Financial  management.  To  facilitate  cash  flow  during  project  implementation,  the \nexecuting  agency  will  approve  and  submit  to  ADB  withdrawal  applications  from  the  PMU, \nassisted by the project owner\u2019s engineers for direct payment procedure for most project goods, \nworks, services, and the consultancy component of the turnkey contractor. Disbursements of \ngrant funds under the project will be to procure goods, works, services, and related consultancy \ncomponent of the turnkey contractor. A financial management assessment of EPC\u2019s internal \ncontrols and accounting and audit procedures was undertaken. EPC\u2019s financial management \npractices and procedures are considered to be generally adequate for both the implementation \nand operational phases of the project. The PMU established within EPC is responsible for project \nfinancial management and accounting. The PMU utilizes EPC\u2019s existing financial management \nand accounting systems in undertaking these functions. EPC\u2019s accounts and reporting structures \nare based on international financial reporting standards. \n \n25.  Procurement  capacity.  A  procurement  capacity  assessment  was  completed,  which \nindicates  that  Samoa\u2019s  procurement  regulations  and  procedures  are  comprehensive.  Even \nthough EPC has a functioning procurement unit, it would still benefit from the expertise of the \nturnkey  contractor.  ADB  will  review  the  project\u2019s  procurement  processes. The  PMU  is  also \nresponsible for the PSEP, which is still under implementation and thus has recent experience \nwith ADB procurement policies.  \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, MOF, and EPC. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  The  project  is  classified  as  general  intervention  as  it  indirectly  addresses  poverty \nreduction. The proposed project will contribute to poverty reduction by reconnecting to the grid \nSHPs damaged during Evan, and by reducing the country\u2019s reliance on volatile and costly \nimported fossil fuels for power generation. The public and businesses will benefit as the project \nwill allow EPC to provide high-quality services at lower costs. The generation of electricity from \nhydropower  will  help  reducing  in  Samoa\u2019s  dependence  on  imported  fossil  fuels  for  power \ngeneration. \n \n28.  The project is classified as some gender elements. It will not directly improve women\u2019s \naccess to social, economic, and financial resources. The project will employ at least 15% of \nfemale workforce in the project area, including professional staff for local construction contracts \nfor hydropower installations, which will offer equal pay for equal work. The resettlement plan \nincludes  women\u2019s  participation  in  all  project  consultations,  disclosure,  detail  measurement \nsurvey, inventory of loss survey, and compensation to both men and women in the household.  \n ", "8 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  Environment (category B). Initial environmental examinations have been prepared for \nthe new and rehabilitation SHP schemes in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009).  The  project  has  been  classified  as  category  B  for  environment  following  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) have been prepared for \nthe new and rehabilitation SHP schemes. Environmental flows have been determined and no \nsignificant impacts are expected on the existing fish and aquatic resources or riparian habitats as \na result of the project provided that the specified minimum environmental flows are released into \nthe rivers at all times. The main potential environmental impacts will be created by the weirs and \nrun-of-river schemes, upgrading of the access roads, and installation of short sections of cables \nfor  grid  connection.  Impacts  may  include  land  clearing,  earthworks,  dust,  noise,  vegetation \nclearance, materials sourcing and transportation, waste disposal and discharges, and effects \nassociated with upgrading of access roads. \n \n30.  Climate change adaptation and resilience measures will be incorporated in the design of \nthe SHP structures, including suitable erosion protection to prevent scour around the intakes. \nThe level of the powerhouse discharge outlet needs to be sufficiently high to prevent any flood-\ninduced  backflow  that  may  result  in  flooding  of  the  powerhouse  and  damage  to \nelectromechanical equipment.  \n \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project is not expected to involve physical \ndisplacement or relocation of people. The rehabilitation of existing SHPs will be undertaken in \nthe existing land acquired in 1921 and 1929, and will not require additional land acquisition. Due \ndiligence for existing facilities has been undertaken in accordance with the Safeguard Policy \nStatement, and its results, including measures for resolving historical concerns raised by local \nvillagers  in  existing  sites,  are  included  in  the  resettlement  plan.  EPC,  in  coordination  with \nrelevant  government  agencies,  will  finalize  and  implement  these  measures  during \nimplementation. New SHPs are proposed to be developed in partnership with local communities, \nand a joint venture business model is under discussion at the cabinet. The land required for new \nSHPs is expected to be acquired through negotiation, with details to be finalized after the \ncabinet\u2019s decision on the business model. A draft resettlement plan has been developed based \non available information, in anticipation of possible land acquisition in case the proposed joint \nventure business model does not materialize. The resettlement plan will be updated and finalized \nafter the detailed design, including measures for further consultations and collection of detailed \nsocioeconomic information. The resettlement plan has been endorsed by EPC and posted on the \nADB website.  \n \n32.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The majority of the population in the project area are \nPolynesian people of Samoa and not considered to be distinct from the mainstream society. The \nproject is not expected to affect any distinct and vulnerable group of indigenous peoples as \ndefined by the Safeguard Policy Statement, and does not require an indigenous peoples plan. \nThe project outputs will be delivered in a culturally appropriate manner. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk  assessment  and  risk management  plan.14 The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n                                                \n14 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n34.  The government and MOF have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and grant documents. \n \n35.  The government and MOF have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the grant agreements and project agreement.  \n \n36.  As a condition to effectiveness of the grant from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, the \nCEFPF  grant  agreement  will  have  been  duly  executed  and  delivered,  and  all  conditions \npreceding its effectiveness (other than a condition requiring the effectiveness of the ADB grant) \nwill have been fulfilled.  \n \n37.
