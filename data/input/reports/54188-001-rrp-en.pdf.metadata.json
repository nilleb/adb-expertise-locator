Economic  growth  was  strong  in  early  2020  in  Kazakhstan\u2014above  4%\u2014and  the \nprevious outlook for 2020\u20132022 of average 4% growth and continuous fiscal consolidation was in \nline with the good performance of recent years. But the recessionary effects of the coronavirus \ndisease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  have  significantly  worsened  Kazakhstan\u2019s  macroeconomic \nsituation. The country\u2019s non-oil fiscal deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) for \n2020  is  now  set  to  widen  to  11% (from  8%  in  2019,  and  an  originally  expected  7%  for  2020), \ninterrupting its recent downward trajectory (it was 10% in 2017).  \n\nEarly  health  and  epidemic-control  responses.  The  pre-COVID-19  efforts  initiated  in \n3. \nearly January to build health system response capacity helped cope with current hospitalization \nneeds. Strict social lockdown measures were implemented since March 15 when the first COVID-\n19 cases in the country were confirmed. But the medical emergency remains dangerous.   \n\n4. \nEconomic  and  social  costs  of  COVID-19  response.  The  strict  social  lock-down \nmeasures  introduced  in  March  to  slow  down  the  spread  of  the  virus  imposed  significant \nrestrictions  on  Kazakhstan's  non-oil  economy  and  seriously  hurt  the  country's  macroeconomic \noutlook. Several enterprise surveys undertaken in early April indicated that (i) by the end of March, \n48% of employees had been put on leave without pay and 13% had been terminated; and (ii) for \nthe second quarter of 2020, an estimated 40% of employees could be put on leave without pay \nand  12%  could  be  terminated.  Tourism,  hospitality,  education,  food  services,  retail  trade,  and \nmanufacturing  were  among  the  areas  hit  hardest.  Women  can  be  most  affected  by  these \neconomic restrictions\u2014they account for more than 65% of the labor force in hospitality, education, \nand wholesale and retail trade; own/manage most of the microenterprises; and are a large share \nof the informal labor market. Estimates are of a loss of 1% of GDP per week of social lockdown.    \n\n5. \nThe  pandemic-caused  global  recession  hits  Kazakhstan.  The  economic  and  social \ndifficulties  that  Kazakhstan  began  experiencing  in  March  are  now  being  compounded  by  the \neffects of (i) a new oil price shock (and the collapse in the prices of other commodities), and (ii) \nthe sudden stop of financial flows into emerging markets (EMs). These direct consequences of \nthe global pandemic halved the prices of 80% of Kazakhstan\u2019s exports. Exchange rate pressures \nwere  eased  by  allowing  a  20%  depreciation  of the  tenge  and  by  raising  the  policy  rate,  which \nincreased the debt-servicing costs across the economy. Pressures on the asset quality of banks \nare already constraining the provision of new liquidity to microenterprises and small and medium-\nsized enterprises (SMEs). This added to the ongoing disruptions of the social lock-down. Without \na  fiscal  response,  the  economy  could  contract  by  5.5%.  The  poor  and  vulnerable,  including \nwomen, can be disproportionately affected. Poverty rates may reach 11%\u201313% (from 6.6% now). \n\n6. \nRobust  and  comprehensive  government  response.  To  counter  this  sequence  of \nshocks, the  government  adopted  comprehensive  medical,  public  health,  and  fiscal  stimulus \nmeasures totaling T5.9 trillion (8%\u20139% of GDP, or about $13 billion). The government will self-\nfund more than 81% of this, including with transfers of $4.7 billion\u2013$5 billion from the National \n\n1   Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020.

The sound pre-shock macroeconomic management record of the government \nis  being  instrumental  in  projecting  credibility  to  recent  monetary  and  macroprudential  policy \ndecisions  in  banking  and  exchange-rate  markets.  The  proposed  assistance  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  help  the  government  mitigate  the  medical,  social  and  economic \nimpacts  of the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  Kazakhstan,  by  supporting  its  (i) immediate  COVID-19 \nhealth policy response, (ii) social protection and employment protection measures, and (iii) overall \nstimulus  measures. 2 Kazakhstan\u2019s  CPRO  eligibility  is  summarized  in  Table  1  and  detailed  in \nAppendix 4. The Program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 in helping Kazakhstan address \nremaining  poverty  and  inequality  risks,  accelerate  progress  in  gender  equality,  strengthen \ngovernance and institutional capacity, and foster regional cooperation and integration (para. 23).3 \n\nTable 1: Summary of Assessment of Compliance with Access Criteria for CPRO \nCriteria \n\n1.

Coordination  \nwith the IMF \n\nADB staff assessment \nHealth costs are rising with the COVID-19 epidemic. Significant economic and fiscal costs of the \nsocial lockdown measures have been produced by ongoing disruptions in business turnover and \nemployment. The second pandemic-related shock was dealt by the significant oil price slump. \nExchange rate pressures have also led to a hike in financial costs across the economy. Taking \ninto account the current government anti-crisis response, the depth of the economic \nrecession in 2020 is now expected to be between 0.9% and 2.4%. \nA countercyclical response package (including both tax and expenditure plans and quasi-fiscal \nmeasures to ensure social and employment protection, and to relaunch the economic recovery) \nwas approved in March\u2013April, 2020. It is comprehensive, and sizable. It implies a stimulus of \n8%\u20139% of GDP in 2020 (about $13 billion). Fiscal measures to mitigate disruptions to business \nand employment are targeted and gender-inclusive (including transfers to the vulnerable \npopulation and the potentially most affected segments of the labor market, such as women).  \nKazakhstan\u2019s new monetary regime has served its macroeconomy well, with stable inflation \n(within 4%\u20136% of the target) and added exchange rate flexibility. The NBK improved its systemic \nliquidity management and interest rate transmission mechanism. Kazakhstan\u2019s fiscal \nmanagement has been credible, with non-oil fiscal deficits on a downward trajectory and with \nsustainable levels of public debt. Kazakhstan\u2019s PFM systems are reliable and well tested. As \nobserved by different institutions (e.g., IMF Assessment Letter), macroeconomic management \nprior to the shock was sound, and growth performance was strong (4% on average). \nThe authorities: (i) initiated COVID-19 readiness preparations in early-January, i.e. more than 2-\nmonths before the first COVID case in Kazakhstan, and immediately built-up the capacity of the \nhealth-care system to cope with worst-case hospitalization scenarios; and (ii) announced a 30-\nday state of emergency from 16 March onwards (first cases reported on 13 March), and \nextended to mid-May; with a series of other strict quarantine and social lockdown measures. \nComprehensive health response measures are being fully implemented and are perceived \nto have been effective so far at dealing with the medical emergency. \nKazakhstan\u2019s public sector debt remains sustainable (30% of GDP by 2025, versus the \nprojected 20% pre-COVID) and its net creditor status is now expected to only last until \n2024. Large tapping of the NFRK to finance the crisis response ($10.9 billion in total in 2020) is \nexpected to bring its assets from 34.5% of GDP in 2019 to 30% GDP by 2024, furthering its \nrecent downward trajectory. Borrowing from ADB (e.g. through the proposed CPRO) and other \nconcessional sources will have a negligible but beneficial impact on debt-to-GDP ratio, and \nshould be a priority at this stage in view of lower levels of gross debt. See Debt Sustainability \nAnalysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nADB keeps consulting with the IMF and discusses forecasts and emerging risks. ADB and the \nIMF agree on the appropriateness of the government\u2019s anti-crisis response plans. The IMF \nupdated its debt sustainability analysis for the government and ADB, and provided an \nassessment letter to ADB that describes ongoing consultations with the government. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPRO = COVID-19 pandemic response option, \nGDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International Monetary Fund, NBK = National Bank of Kazakhstan, NFRK = \nNational Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan, PFM = public financial management.  \nSource: ADB. \n\n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n3  ADB. 2018.

As of 2 June 2020, 11,796 COVID-19 cases have been \n7. \nconfirmed in Kazakhstan (the first cases were recorded on 13 March) and 44 related deaths were \nregistered.  The  epidemiological  situation  remains  dangerous.  The  national  health  system  was \nrapidly  upgraded  to  cope  with  the  epidemic,  thanks  to  the  measures  initiated  in  early  January \n2020, i.e., before the epidemic had arrived in the country. This has been recognized to have been \neffective  so  far  at  coping  with  hospitalization  challenges.4 But  strict  social  lockdown  measures \nintroduced to slow the spread of the virus imposed very significant restrictions on businesses and \nemployment and brought a recessionary outlook to Kazakhstan. Microenterprises and SMEs were \nimpacted in particular\u2014their turnover fell by 75%.5 The activities hardest hit directly are tourism, \nhospitality,  education, food services, and manufacturing. Restrictions on economic activity can \nparticularly affect women.6 The health emergency remains a serious challenge and its fiscal costs \nare sizable. OECD estimates point to a loss of 1% of GDP per week of social lockdown.7 \n\nFigure 1: Pandemic-Related Global Recessionary Shocks to Markets \n\nDow Jones (right-hand-side axis; index points) I Crude Oil (left-hand-side axis; USD/Bbl)\n\n                  Source: Trading Economics. https://tradingeconomics.com/.   \n\n \n\n8. \nSecond pandemic-related shock. While the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly overwhelmed \nhealth systems and shut down large segments of economies across the world, from the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) to Europe to the United States, it is becoming particularly damaging in \ndeveloping and emerging economies that are highly dependent on commodity exports or tourism \nrevenues. Kazakhstan's experience is of particular significance. The collapse of the international \nprices  of  oil  and  other  commodities  (which  determine  more  than  80%  of  Kazakhstan\u2019s  export \nrevenue) is sustained by the global recessionary outlook for 2020 (Figure 1).8 Also, a sudden stop \nin  capital  flows  hit  EMs.  The  cumulative  outflows  from  these  markets  since  the  onset  of  the \nCOVID-19  crisis  are  extraordinary  in  magnitude,  even  by  the  standards  of  the  global  financial \ncrisis.9 This will directly affect banks in Kazakhstan with foreign-currency refinancing needs, and \nall firms, individuals and projects in Kazakhstan with debt denominated in foreign currency. \n\n \n\n4  https://twitter.com/hans_kluge/status/1260277518327844866.  \n5  Several enterprise surveys undertaken in early April indicated that (i) by 23 March, 48% of employees had been put \non leave without pay and 13% had been terminated; and (ii) for the second quarter, an estimated 40% of employees \nwould be put on leave without pay and 12% would be terminated. \n\n6  Women account for more than 65% of the labor force in some of the most affected sectors (e.g., hospitality, education, \nand wholesale-retail trade); own or manage 42% of SMEs; and represent a large share of the informal labor market. \n7  OECD. 2020. Tackling Coronavirus (COVID-19), Contributing to a Global Effort: The COVID-19 Crisis in Kazakhstan. \n8  The sustained drop in global demand continues to weigh on investors' sentiment in world commodity markets. Global \ndemand for oil may fall as much as 30% in 2020. Outstanding surpluses also threaten to overwhelm storage capacity \nin many oil-producing countries such as Kazakhstan, and halt production and investments in their oil industries. \n9  Institute of International Finance: https://www.iif.com/Publications/ID/3829; https://www.iif.com/Publications/ID/3840.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n9. \nWithout a fiscal response, the economy could contract in real terms by 5.5% in 2020 \n(instead of the 4% average growth that had been projected for 2020).10 The collapse in export \nrevenues brought about exchange rate pressures that the monetary authorities allowed to take \nhold  while  raising  the  policy  rate  to  12%  (from  9.25%)  to  smooth  the  currency  depreciation \nprocess.  As  a  consequence,  debt-servicing  costs  in  the  economy  have  risen  for  both  local \ncurrency  credit  and foreign  currency  credit contracts,  even  if  the  policy  rate  was  subsequently \nlowered to 9.75% in the face of weakening aggregate demand. This is now affecting the asset \nquality of banks, and will further constrain access to finance for microenterprises and SMEs.  \n \n\nFigure 2: Macroeconomic Pressures on Kazakhstan \n\nGDP Growth Scenarios (in percentage)\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\n-5\n-6\n-7\n-8\n\n \n\nEIU Forecast as of 10 February 2020\n\nEIU Forecast as of 16 March 2020\n\nScenario Without Fiscal Response (Forecast as of 10/04/2020)\n\n \n\nEIU = Economist Intelligence Unit, GDP = gross domestic product, Q = quarter. \nSources: Asian Development Bank; EIU. https://www.eiu.com/n/; Trading Economics. https://tradingeconomics.com/. \n \nSocial vulnerabilities, poverty, and gender risks. Unless countered, the shocks that hit \n10. \nKazakhstan  can  exacerbate  levels  of  poverty  and  social  vulnerability.  Gender  risks  are  also \nrecognizable. These dimensions and risks can be disaggregated by each of the three shocks: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe COVID-19 crisis could increase hospitalization and medication costs to a level \nthat would overwhelm the budgets of the poor and most vulnerable, if infected. It \nalso puts health workers, of whom 70% are women, at risk.  \nThe strict social lockdown measures of the government are crucial in containing \nthe medical emergency. But these measures pose significant risks to livelihoods \nand income generation in business activities where women's participation is high. \nWomen account for more than 65% of the labor force in some of the sectors most \naffected by the current lockdowns. Some hard-hit informal activities include a large \nshare of women.  \n\n(iii)  Without  a  well-targeted  fiscal  response  to  the  current  recessionary  pressures, \npoverty  rates  could  reach  11%\u201313%. 11 Women  could  also  be  disproportionally \naffected by a deep recession, given existing gender disparities in wage levels (in \n2015,  women  workers  earned  only  65.9%  of  men\u2019s  average  wages)  and \nunemployment  rates  (the  unemployment  rate  for  women  was  5.7%  in  2015, \ncompared  with  4.3%  for  men),  and  already  disadvantaged  access  to  finance  in \nnormal  times  (businesses  with  female  managers  face  a  77%  rejection  rate  on \naverage, compared with 17% for businesses with male managers).12 \n\n10 ADB staff and IMF staff projections. \n11 The poverty rate was 6.6% in 2019. Differentials between men (2.6%) and women (2.7%) are not significant. \n12 Women also face higher collateral requirements (loan\u2013value ratio of 260%) than men (170%). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fFiscal  challenges.  The  health  budget  is  expected  to  swell,  as  are  other  expenditure \n11. \nitems. The revised state budget indicates a 10.5% increase in overall expenditure.13 Tax revenue \nrelated to the extractive industries is expected to plummet in 2020, and other tax revenue will also \nbe affected by ongoing business and employment distress. The total reduction in tax revenues in \n2020 is estimated at 20%.14 Originally-allocated transfers from the NFRK to the state budget of \n$6.2 billion will receive an additional and sizable top-up, bringing it to an estimated total of $10.9 \nbillion in 2020 (total transfers in 2018 were $7.6 billion). This depletion of NFRK will be further \ncompounded by lower inflows due to sharp drops in oil revenues and a marked reduction in the \nmarket  value  of  its  financial  assets.  This  is  significant  in  view  of  the  NFRK\u2019s  crucial  role  in \nintergenerational equity and the risks to this mandate (see discussion in para. 27).15 Kazakhstan\u2019s \ndomestic  securities  market  is  still  nascent  (see  para.  26),  and  the  government\u2019s  access  to \ninternational capital markets is now very limited, as indicated by the rise in the risk spreads of \nregional sovereign Eurobonds (figures 3\u20134; Kazakhstan is in the lowest rank of investment grade). \n\n \n\nFigure 3: Eurobonds Sovereign CIS \n(Spread with US Treasuries) \n\nFigure 4:  Eurobonds NIG Sovereign CIS \n(Spread with US Treasuries) \n\n \n\n \n\nCSI = Commonwealth of Independent States, NIG = non-investment grade, US = United States. \nSource: Cbonds Financial Information. Index group: Euro-Cbonds Sovereign CIS.  \n \n12. \nA recession in the Kazakhstan's economy (which represents 50% of Central Asia\u2019s \nGDP) has a substantial regional impact through sharp drops in trade and remittance flows. \nADB established the CPRO to support its developing member countries in countering the severe \nhealth, fiscal and macroeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic currently spreading across \nborders. This was also meant to generate a regional public good and promote an internationally \ncoordinated effort to lower the transmission of infections and mitigate negative cross-border social \nand  economic  spillovers.  The  number  of  nationals  from  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  and \nUzbekistan that work in Kazakhstan and send home remittances has increased substantially in \nrecent years. More than three and a half million migrants of all categories live in Kazakhstan.16 \nEven  though  a  substantial  share  of  remittance  outflows  takes  place  through  informal  means, \nformal money-transfers recorded by the NBK for April 2020 already showed a decrease of 13% \nversus April 2019. Kazakhstan is a significant importer of food and other products from the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and other Central Asian countries. It is a major wheat exporter to regional countries, and \n\n \n\n13 On the expenditure side, the government also had to optimize spending according to evolving priorities, including a \nbudget reallocation of T533 billion, cancellation of some international and local events, and deferment of some capital \nexpenditures. There is also a risk of a further increase in outlays for the import of capital goods. \n\n14 The state budget for the fiscal year 2020 was approved in September 2019 on the premise of global oil prices in the \nrange of $55 per barrel. After Kazakhstan declared a state of emergency, the new base-case scenario assumes an \noil price of $20 per barrel. In 2019, the 30 largest oil and gas companies in Kazakhstan paid almost 50% of all taxes \nto the budget, or T4.6 trillion. While customs duties on crude oil exports constituted 16.9% of tax revenues in 2019, \nthey are estimated to drop by more than 71%, and vanish completely if oil prices remain below $25 per barrel in the \nmedium term. Moreover, the state of emergency and the quarantine measures significantly hurt the service industry. \n\n15 National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Central Asian Bureau for Analytical Reporting, February 2020. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\na serious crisis with prolonged border closures could threaten the food security in Central Asia.17 \nKazakhstan\u2019s pandemic and recession mitigation effort has aspects of a regional public good. \n\nB. \n\nProposed Program, Impacts and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n13. \nA major anti-crisis package was approved of about $13 billion (8%\u20139% of GDP; Appendix \n4, tables A4.1\u2013A4.2 present the measures by on-budget and off-budget categorization),18 with: \nan  effective  health  policy  response  ($338.4  million);  properly  targeted  measures  to  protect \nemployment and the segments of the population that are most vulnerable to the current crisis, \nincluding women ($7.18 billion); and economic stimulus measures ($5.97 billion).19  \n\n1. \n\nCOVID-19 Health Policy Response \n\n \n14. \nEarly  pre-COVID-19  readiness  and  public  health  response  plans.  The  government \nstarted preparations well ahead of the infection breakout in the country and took several swift and \ndecisive containment, health care, and other social measures in response to the COVID-19 threat, \nin close coordination with development partners and neighboring countries (Table 2). \n\nTable 2: Summary of COVID-19 Preparation Measures \n\nMeasures ($338.4 million) \n\n# \n1  On  6  January  2020  the  Ministry  of  Healthcare  (MOH)  approved  the  main  preparedness  activities  to  mitigate \nepidemiological  outbreaks.  International  travelers,  depending  on  the  country  of  origin,  were  placed  under \nmandatory 14-day isolation or self-quarantine. An Inter-sectoral Committee on COVID-19, chaired by the Deputy \nPrime-Minister, was set up to ensure full coordination, and an action plan was approved on 29 January 2020 for \nimmediate  implementation.  All  transportation  between  Kazakhstan  and  countries  highly  affected  by  the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been suspended since 3 February 2020, and screening at entry points and \nmedical monitoring of those coming from countries affected by COVID-19 were established. \n\n2  MOH approved the COVID-19 infection treatment clinic protocol in early February. The protocol is continuously \ndiscussed with leading international specialists and updated to reflect latest developments in the diagnostics and \ntreatment of COVID-19. MOH, with the support of the World Health Organization and the involvement of national \nstakeholders, continues to identify possible improvements in the overall response. During February\u2013March 2020, \nmore than 28,492 beds were deployed in the country for the hospitalization of COVID-19 patients and contact \npersons.a Three fully equipped medical complexes were newly set up. \n\n3  Overall, the government allocated $53.4 million for the procurement of supplies, including central and regional \nprocurement  of  personal  protective  equipment,  disinfectants  and  medicines,  and  medical  devices;  and  an \nadditional  $285 million to boost  the  capacity  of  the  health  care system.b  The  government  also extended free \naccess to full COVID-19-related medical care for all citizens, through the state medical system in public hospitals. \n4  Systematic public communication was established. A hotline was set up for medical professionals and the public. \nInformation  on  the  ongoing  COVID-19  emergency  and  on  individual  protection  measures  is  being  circulated \nthrough various channels such as daily briefings on TV, radio, and social media (e.g., Facebook, Telegram). A \nnewly created webpage (www.coronavirus2020.kz) also provides information and updates. \n\na  Of which 2,669 are for infectious cases, 8,098 are of the pharmacist type, and 17,725 are for quarantine purposes. \nHospitals designated for the treatment of COVID-19 received 182 resuscitation beds with proper equipment (e.g., \nmechanical ventilation devices and monitors). MOH also mobilized more than 10,000 medical workers to provide \nCOVID-19-related medical care and has an additional 802 trained specialists on standby. \n\nb  These are also for anti-epidemiological measures. The total of T125.2 billion includes T40.6 billion for premiums to \ndoctors in the front line, T19.5 billion for payment to medical organizations, T14.8 billion for the preparation of three \nmedical complexes, T30.8 million for food and household sets, T8.1 billion for premiums to employees and medical \nworkers of law enforcement, T4.1 billion for communication services, and T5.6 billion forensic medical examination. \n\nSource: Government of Kazakhstan. \n \n\n17 Kazakhstan placed a quota on the export of wheat flour. This has sparked concerns that the economic crisis brought \nabout by the coronavirus pandemic could spark a wave of food security concerns, with certain countries left short of \ncertain products in the face of hoarding by states. Kazakhstan is a key supplier to Central Asian neighbors, including \nUzbekistan and countries further away such as Afghanistan. \n\n18 All these measures are fiscal in nature, but we refer to those that are off-budget as quasi-fiscal. \n19 A more comprehensive description of all the different anti-crisis initiatives is in COVID-19 Public Health Response \n\nand Countercyclical Response Policies (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f15.  Medical and social lockdown interventions upon the outbreak of COVID-19. When \nthe  first  imported  cases  were  detected  on  13  March  2020,  all  were  immediately  isolated  and \ntreated. Initial infections spread in Nur-Sultan (the capital city) and Almaty (the largest city), and \nall contacts were quarantined and tested. Table 3 summarizes the new actions. \n\nTable 3: Summary of Non-Pharmaceutical and other COVID-19 Interventions \n\nMeasures \n\n# \n1  As an immediate reaction, the just-established Emergency Operations Center (EOC) began 24-hour monitoring \nof  the  COVID-19  situation  globally,  regionally,  and  nationally,  and  started  collecting  information  on  persons \narriving from affected countries. Those arriving from highly affected countries were placed in 14-day quarantine. \n2  When the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic, Kazakhstan declared a state of \nemergency.  All  places  of  mass  gatherings  were  closed,  public  events  were  cancelled,  large  family \ncommemorative events were banned. Stringent enforcement measures aimed at preventing the spread of the \ndisease, such as penalties for persons evading medical examinations, were applied. Quarantines and lockdowns \nwere announced on 17 March 2020 for the country\u2019s three largest cities and were subsequently introduced in \nother regions. The government deployed regional response teams consisting of local government, health care, \nsocial care, civil society, and private sector representatives to identify evolving needs, support vulnerable groups, \nand establish feedback to central coordination teams. Mobile teams were assigned in every region to provide \ncare and to transport suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases to hospitals. \n\n3  The National Reference Laboratory in March received test kits from the People's Republic of China, the Russian \nFederation, and WHO, and jointly with the National Biotechnology Center started to develop own testing systems. \nTo date, no other developing member country in Asia tests more in per capita terms than Kazakhstan. \n\n4  Kazakhstan  intensified  its  surveillance  by  enhancing  the  capacity  for  active  case  finding.  The  Ministry  of \nHealthcare, with the support of WHO, continues to improve the system for contact tracing and monitoring. The \nEOC also developed geographic information system tools to monitor the COVID-19 spread. \n\nSource: Government of Kazakhstan.  \n\n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Protection and Employment Protection Measures \n\n16. \nThe government is implementing initiatives that combine liquidity relief, income support, \nunemployment insurance, and support to the most vulnerable sectors of activity (Table 4; more \ndetails on targeting are included in the design and monitoring framework [DMF], in Appendix 1).  \n\nTable 4: Fiscal Response to Protect Incomes, Jobs, and the Most Vulnerable \n\n# \n1 \n\nMeasures ($7.18 billion in total) \nIncome support. Cash payments ($95 per month) for those who lost labor income under the \nstate of emergency.a The target is 3 million people, and this is implemented by the State Social \nSecurity Fund. All those that work in the informal labor market\u2014mostly women\u2014can apply.  \n2  Food support. A lower value-added tax rate was set for food,b and various other responses \nhelp mitigate the impact of higher food prices. A nationwide food supply program was established \nwith T45.8 billion for local authorities to provide free food sets to more than 1.1 million people \n(primarily elderly people, large families, and people with disabilities, i.e., those registered in the \nsocial vulnerability ledger). In parallel, the government introduced price caps on essential foods. \n3  Social transfers increase. To help vulnerable groups (e.g. pensioners) cope with possible hikes \nin food prices, the government increased all social payments by 10%. This would include about \n32,000 households currently covered by the unconditional cash transfer program, and 129,000 \nhouseholds covered by conditional cash aid under the government\u2019s targeted social support.  \n4  Tax and utility cost relief. In addition to significant utility subsidies and automatic reductions in \nthe tax base, in March 2020 the government introduced tax support measures targeting mainly \nmicro and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in agriculture, trade, and services. This \nincludes a reduction to zero in the rates of property tax (for retail, trade, catering, entertainment, \ntourism, and hospitality businesses), land tax (for agricultural producers), and income tax (for \nindividual  entrepreneurs).  A  six-month  exemption  from  payroll  taxes  was  also  introduced  for \nSMEs in these sectors.

To encourage credit institutions \nto implement this restructuring, deferred loan payment efforts will not entail impairment or provisioning \nfor regulatory requirements. This is expected to release an additional T168.0 billion ($385  million) for \nlending. To ensure the efficient implementation of the measures, the ARDFM is launching mechanisms \nto ensure that a moratorium on payments does not entail negative information on borrowers being sent \nto the Credit Bureau, and mechanisms to ensure that total loan contract payments do not exceed the \ninitially scheduled ones. Borrowers have recourse to the ARDFM for additional review. The ARDFM also \nexpanded  the  list  of  collaterals  in  financing  projects  under  state  business  support  programs  and \nintroduced a  low risk weighting on  loans to SMEs, public\u2013private partnerships, and syndicated  loans. \nThe ARDFM also announced new regulatory measures (tightening of provisions calculation), based on \nthe results of a recent asset quality review (AQR) of the banks, will be postponed until 1 October 2020.c \na  Among other things, this included a ban on interest accrual for consumer loans overdue more than 90 days, no fines \nand penalties for late payments on loans and microcredits if caused by the state of emergency, and a grace period \nof up to 90 days for SMEs and individual borrowers that experience financial hardship. \n\nb   Including a regulatory loosening for lending to SMEs, with a reduction in risk weights for SME exposures. \nc   In August 2019, the NBK had announced the start of a sweeping AQR of the top 14 banks of the country, covering \n87% of total banking assets. The AQR report, published in February 2020, concluded that the majority of assessed \nbanks had sufficient capital to comply with the regulatory standards and to cover expected credit losses. \n\nSource: Government of Kazakhstan. \n\nProgram outcome, impact and outputs.

The  Program  is  designed  to  ensure  that  the  overall  fiscal  stimulus  package  is \nimplemented  and  monitored,  since  the  complementarity  of  all  its  components  is  crucial  to \nsustaining incomes and employment recovery, and the individual targets across all three outputs. \nTo reinforce this requirement, output 3 also includes it as an indicator, implying that 8%\u20139% of \nGDP  in  automatic  and  discretionary  stimulus  measures  will  be  necessary.  The  development \nproblem for the proposed ADB assistance requires this to ensure an effective mitigation of the \ncurrently heightened social vulnerability risks. Taking into account the range of policy responses \nof the government, the depth of the economic recession in 2020 is now expected to be between \na 0.9% contraction (the government assessment) and a 2.4% contraction (assuming very small \nfiscal multipliers, in line with International Monetary Fund [IMF] forecasts) (Figure 5).

Also,  the  abrupt  and  disorderly  nature  of  the  currency  depreciation, \nwhen  it  finally  happened  in  2015,  exacerbated  pressures  in the  banking  system \nand  the  credit  contraction  that  ensued  then  led  to  a  steeper  contraction  in  the \neconomy and likely delayed the economic recovery.25  \nThe  current  emphasis  on  social  protection,  income  support  and  use  of  existing \nstate programs also reflects an important lesson from past countercyclical efforts \nin general: it is difficult to credibly fast-track conventional public works or have a \nlist of \u201cshovel-ready\u201d projects when a crisis arrives.   \n\n(iii)  With  regards  to  coordination,  implementation,  and  reporting,  Kazakhstan\u2019s \ninstitutional division of responsibilities for the anti-crisis plan and PFM systems are \neffective,  and  have  been  well  tested  by  previous  ADB  CSF  assistance.  The \nlessons from past operations (some of which are formally addressed in program \ncompletion  reports)  were  discussed  with  the  government  and  also  informed  the \ncurrently proposed implementation arrangements\u2014by establishing the Ministry of \nFinance  (MOF)  as  the  executing  agency  for  the  proposed  ADB  assistance,  in \ncharge of monitoring and submitting to ADB quarterly reports on budget execution \nand on the flow of funds related to countercyclical measures (as well as appointing \nother key line ministries as implementing agencies to report on the ultimate results \n\n \n\n22 By law, the government is not allowed to seek IMF fiscal financing. It can only seek budget support from development \ninstitutions such as ADB and the World Bank. IMF financing can only be sought by the National Bank of Kazakhstan \n(as the issuer of the liability), and presumably for balance-of-payment reasons. \n\n23 ADB discussions with the IMF have been frequent and productive. In January, the IMF had conducted an Article IV \nconsultation. In March 2020, after the COVID-19 crisis reached Kazakhstan, the IMF held a series of comprehensive \nconsultations  with  the  Ministry  of  National  Economy  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  on  the  revised \nmacroeconomic outlook, fiscal projections, and the government\u2019s crisis response measures.  \n\n24 Discussions between ADB and the WB are frequent. WB budget support for 2020 is likely not possible due to the \n\ndifficulties in designing a meaningful policy-based loan that could still be disbursed in 2020.  \n\n25 Details in: ADB. 2017. Countercyclical Support to Kazakhstan: Project Completion Report. Manila (para. 40). \n\n \n\n\fon site), transaction costs can be minimized and the implementation is effectively \nintegrated in the government\u2019s overall coordination architecture.26  \nLessons  learned  from  previous  CSF  assistance  are  also  integrated  in  the \ndisbursement arrangements for the proposed Program.27 \n\n(iv) \n\n22. \nADB\u2019s  Value  Addition.  ADB  and  Kazakhstan  have  a  trusted  and  multi-faceted \npartnership,  including  in  managing  recent  crises  and  designing  appropriate  countercyclical \nresponses.  A  key  part  of  the  recent  and  ongoing  policy  dialogue  does  benefit  from  past  joint \nreviews  and  assessments  of  the  completed  crises  response  programs,  which  assessed \nsuccesses and weaknesses and identified ways of improving design and implementation of future \nprograms. Technical assistance and knowledge collaboration have been another key means of \nengagement,  which  helped  establish  the  current  avenues  of  crisis  and  reform  related  policy \nengagement  of  ADB:  (i) technical  assistance  initiatives  of  immediate  relief  to  help  pilot  better-\ntargeting approaches are under preparation;28 and (ii) technical assistance to support key crisis-\nmanagement policy decisions is both being implemented29 and under processing (e.g. public debt \nmanagement, fiscal risk management, etc.)30 Ongoing and planned technical assistance will help \nmonitor  the  implementation  of the  government\u2019s anti-crisis  initiatives,  allow  for  ADB  to monitor \nand  provide  real-time  feedback  on  the  implementation  of  these.  In  addition,  ongoing  technical \nassistance  on  public  debt  and  fiscal  risk  management  will  contribute  to  the  design  of  ADB\u2019s \ncomprehensive medium-term engagement with Kazakhstan in support of comprehensive reforms \nin  economic management  and  economic  diversification.  ADB\u2019s  budget  support  and  success  in \ncatalyzing cofinancing from the AIIB will help reduce the worrisome depletion of the NFRK (see \nparas. 27\u201328). This joint ADB-AIIB financing effort will support the regional public goods nature \nof  Kazakhstan\u2019s  anti-crisis  support  efforts  (with  its  potential  health,  employment  and  income \nspillovers  onto  Uzbekistan,  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan).  As  discussed  in  para.  12,  the \nProgram  will  directly  support  the  implementation  of  the  regional  public  goods  pillar  of  ADB\u2019s \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Operational Plan 2019\u20132020,31 and the operational cluster \nfive of CAREC 2030, related to transboundary communicable diseases. \n\n23. \nStrategic  Context  of  ADB  Engagement  in  Kazakhstan.  Under  ADB\u2019s  country \nassistance  in  Kazakhstan,  reform-focused  technical  assistance  is  also  being  designed  to  help \nmitigate  the  potential  crisis-induced  scarring  of  Kazakhstan\u2019s  non-oil  economic  potential.  This \nreform-focused engagement includes priority areas such as micro and SMEs\u2019 access to finance \nand  financial  inclusion  reforms,  green  finance,  and  other  reforms  to  enhance  the  economic \nrecovery and the productive potential of the non-oil economy. These TA areas complement the \nongoing programming of ADB's assistance pipeline for 2021\u20132023, which focuses on supporting \nagricultural  productivity  and  commercialization,  SMEs  development,  and  the  greening  of  the \n\n \n\n26 Past CSF experience in Kazakhstan was satisfactory on the fiduciary front. Several measures in the government's \nanti-crisis program are very well targeted, and the program\u2019s design and monitoring framework fully reflects it. ADB \ntechnical assistance will accompany the implementation effort. Quarterly reporting will ensure frequent consultations.  \n27 Tranching raises the question of what to make disbursement conditional on. Previous experience of \u201ctranching\u201d the \nCSF disbursements was not positive, and it does not seem that it should be repeated. Para. 38 of the completion \nreport for the 2015 CSF highlighted the lack of justification for the special features introduced then as tranche release \nconditions, and its potential counterproductive role in delaying financial support disbursement as a critical design \nsetback. It also questioned the emphasis on issues that were not relevant to the then circumstances of Kazakhstan.  \n28 Through the ADB\u2013Kazakhstan Solidarity Fund (to be cofinanced in parity terms with the Government of Kazakhstan). \nThis  includes  the  piloting  of  better  approaches  to  food  and  medicine  relief  to  vulnerable  people,  establishing \ndedicated business support services to affected SMEs, and assist in skills re-training programs for unemployed. \n29 ADB. 2018.

These are crucial to \n\nthe effectiveness of the government\u2019s anti-crisis measures and efforts during the crisis-recovery phase. \n\n31  ADB.  2016.

This will be explored in close coordination with WB and AIIB.  The Program is aligned with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. Its focus on helping to address current poverty, inequality and gender risks \nis  in  line  with  Operational  Priority  (OP)  1\u2013Addressing  Remaining  Poverty  and  Reducing \nInequalities,  and  with  OP2\u2013Accelerating  Progress  in  Gender  Equality.  Its  support  for \nmacroeconomic and financial stabilization and to ring-fence public service-delivery from ongoing \nfiscal  shocks  is  in  line  with  OP6\u2013Strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity.  As \ndiscussed  in  paras.  12  and  22,  the  Program  is  also  in  line  with  OP7\u2013Fostering  Regional \nCooperation and Integration. \n\nKazakhstan\u2019s Structural Reform Momentum. Kazakhstan is among the top 30 countries \n24. \nin  the  World  Bank's  Doing  Business  ranking,  and  the  government  has  been  adopting \nunprecedented  system-wide  reforms  aimed  at  improving  the  business  climate  and  reducing \nadministrative  barriers  and  business  costs.  These  reforms  have  been  reducing  red  tape  for \nentrepreneurs  and  are  moving  the  whole  country  toward  global  good  practices  in  business \nregulation.33 But reform processes are medium-term in nature and it is crucial to ensure that the \ncurrent  moment  of  economic  and  social  distress  does  not  affect  ongoing  reform  preparation \nprocesses or the reform drive of stakeholders. The government is committed to ensuring that the \nongoing crisis will not affect its reform momentum, and it has re-affirmed its commitment to, for \nexample,  (i)  continue  its  structural  reforms  and  its  ambitious  agenda  for  the  greening  of  the \neconomy, and (ii) fiscal consolidation to reduce public sector dependency on oil-revenues. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\nC. \n \n25. \nAll  the  off-budget  anti-crisis  measures  are  self-funded  by  the  government.  All  the  on-\nbudget anti-crisis measures have already been reflected in the recently approved revisions to the \ngovernment budget.34 These include a combination of automatic and discretionary reductions in \ntax  revenue  of  about  $3.9  billion,  and  of  new  expenditures (net  of  cuts  and  some  expenditure \nrationalizations)35 of about $3.1 billion. Overall, the on-budget anti-crisis package (and net new \nfinancing  needs)  of  the  government  total  about  $7  billion. 36 On  the  funding  side,  additional \ntransfers from the NFRK, the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, will be able to close this gap by \nabout $4.7 billion\u2013$5 billion equivalent. With these additional transfers, the total transfers from the \nNFRK will amount to $10.9 billion in 2020, representing a significant use of NFRK resources (it \nwill deplete more than 18% of the accumulated funds of the NFRK),37 and it is at the limit of what \nwould be consistent with the NFRK's medium-term main mandate. The remaining $2 billion will \nneed to come from additional domestic and external debt issuance (Table 6).  \n\n \n\n32 The  government  is  embarking  on  ambitious  green  economy  reforms,  aiming  to  reduce  environmental  pollution \nthrough  sustainable  waste  management,  the  diversification  of  coal-based  energy  mix  through  use  of  renewable \nenergy sources, and the reduction of energy intensity through comprehensive sector reforms and the development \nof  geothermal  energy  regulations.  ADB  and  the  government  are  working  on  formulating  sector  reforms  and  in \nmodernizing national legislation (e.g. on district heating, waste management and environmental sustainability). \n\n33 Doing Business \u2013 Kazakhstan. \n34 The state budget for 2020 was approved in September 2019 on the premise of global oil prices of $55 per barrel. \n\nThe new base-case scenario assumes an oil price of $20 per barrel.  \n\n35 On  the  expenditure  side,  the  government  also  had  to  optimize  and  reallocate  spending  according  to  evolving \npriorities, including a budget reallocation of T533 billion. It already had cancelled international and local events, and \nannounced plans to cancel or delay some capital expenditures. There is a risk of a further increase in expenditure \noutlays for imports of capital goods because of the sharp local currency depreciation.  \n\n36 The off-budget anti-crisis measures of about $5.6 billion are all funded by other government institutions and SOEs. \n37 As of the end of February 2020, NFRK assets were estimated at $57 billion or 38% of 2019 GDP.  \n\n \n\n\fTable 6: Development Financing Needs in 2020  \n(in T billion, unless otherwise stated) \n\nItem \n\nRevenues \nExpenditures \nBudget balance \nTotal budget financing needed: \n   NFRK transfers (including return transfer) a \n   Borrowing \n\n Net domestic borrowing \n\n     Net external borrowing \n\n   a) From the ADB Program \n   b) From AIIB (cofinancing the Program) \n   c) others b \n\nOriginal \nState \nBudget \n8,616.2 \n12,914.2 \n  (4,298.0) \n4,298.0 \n2,700.0 \n1,598.0 \n1,366.9 \n231.2 \n \n \n231.2 \n\nRevised \nState \nBudget \n6,950.0 \n14,270.7 \n(7,320.7) \n7,320.7 \n4,882.0 \n2,438.7 \n1,682.2 \n755.8 \n430.0 \n322.5 \n3.3 \n\nChange \n\n(1,666.2) \n1,356.5 \n(3,022.7) \n3,022.7 \n2,182.0 \n840.7 \n315.3 \n524.6 \n430.0 \n322.5 \n(227.9) \n\n \n\nChange \n[T/$=430] \n(in $ billion) \n(3.90) \n3.10 \n(7.00) \n7.00 \n 5.00a \n2.00 \n0.70 \n1.30 \n1.00 \n0.75 \n(0.53) \n\n( ) = negative, ADB = Asian Development Bank, AIIB = Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, NFRK = National Fund \nof Republic of Kazakhstan \na  When set in the revised budget, the foreign currency equivalent was $4.7 billion, at a different exchange rate than \n\nthe one in this table.

Kazakhstan\u2019s  public  debt  will  remain  sustainable  for  the \nforeseeable  future  (ADB\u2019s  DSA  is  in  linked  document  7).  The  current  fiscal  effort  is  making  a \nmuch-needed  use  of  the  available  fiscal  space.  But  the  domestic  debt  market,  which  was  still \nnascent  before  the  crisis,  is  still  illiquid. 38 Up  until  now,  government  securities  issuance  had \nfocused on the tenors (i.e. medium to long-term) that were of least interest to most financial market \nplayers (and mostly of interest to pension funds, which display hold-to-maturity behavior and don\u2019t \ncontribute to price discovery), for (i) lack of capacity to manage refinancing risk and (ii) because \nthe  NBK  issues  the  shorter  tenors  of  the  yield  structure  (for  systemic  liquidity  management \npurposes). 39  The  resulting  lack  of  trading  liquidity  in  government  securities  has  now  been \nexacerbated  by  heightened  uncertainty  in  financial  markets  regarding  future  short-term  rates, \nwhich  impairs  pricing.  Even  though  from  May  2020  the  government  securities  issuance  plan \nalready reflects a sharp shift in priority towards shorter, potentially more liquid tenors, 40 it will still \nbe a challenge to fulfill current borrowing plans through an asset class that is still incipient in terms \nof outstanding amounts.41 Government borrowing from ADB or any other form of concessional \nfinance  (like  the  proposed  Program)  will  have  a  minimal  impact  on  debt-to-GDP  ratio  going \nforward, and should be a priority. From a fiscal management perspective and in line with what \nhas  been  the  consensus  technical  advice,  the  government  should  maximize  all  affordable \nborrowing options at the current crisis stage to avoid tapping on the NFRK given that the currently-\nplanned sale of depressed international financial assets will likely result in additional realization \nof valuation losses.42 Kazakhstan public sector remains a net creditor today, but projected debt \nlevels are now expected to reach 30% of GDP by 2024\u20132025.  \n\n \n\n38 ADB TA is supporting MOF\u2019s State Borrowings Department in developing a medium-term debt strategy and market-\nbased borrowing practices to: (i) better optimize risk-cost trade-offs; (ii) chart key actions to develop the government \nsecurities market (and investor base); and (iii) improve agency coordination for cash and debt management.  \n\n39 95% of the amount issued in government securities in 2019 was for tenors of 10\u201320 years.  \n40 https://kase.kz/en/gsecs/release_schedule.  \n41 The trading liquidity of an asset class significantly depends on an adequate level of already outstanding amounts.  \n42 After the currency shocks of 2015, which had an extremely negative impact on the debt portfolio of the government, \nthe  MOF  adhered  to  a  policy  of  borrowing  preferably  in  the  domestic  market,  in  order  to  gradually  level  out  the \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nThe National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Large withdrawals from NFRK in \n27. \n2020\u201321 to finance the current crisis response43 will further worsen a declining trend and bring its \nlevel  to  30%  of  GDP  by  2024\u20132025,  which  will  breach  a  key  threshold  buffer  in  Kazakhstan\u2019s \nfiscal rules. 44 The government might also therefore no longer be a net creditor by 2024. In 2017, \nthe  WB  had  concluded  that  unless  the  new  set  of  fiscal  rules  and  consolidation  plans  were \nadopted, a full depletion of net fiscal savings in around 5\u201310 years would be the result.45 A 2018 \nEBRD  report  for  Kazakhstan  actually  gave  Kazakhstan  only  a  12-year  window  to  build  fiscal \nresilience.46 ADB has also been providing policy advice on debt management development that \nis consistent with the concerns expressed before the crisis by the World Bank, IMF and EBRD, \nand has emphasized the need to (i) target net debt objectives in a way that fully takes into account \nall the financial and institutional trade-offs involved in borrowing vis-a-vis tapping on NFRK, and \n(ii) fully-incorporate the urgency to ring-fence the NFRK against foreseeable depletion risks. As a \nresult of the current crisis and the significant transfers already approved to the revisions to the \nState Budget for 2020, the NFRK is expected to end the year at $57 billion (38% of GDP), which \ncompares with $73 billion at its peak in 2014. Drawing down further on NFRK could affect the \nsovereign rating and increase refinancing costs, and also make market access more sensitive to \nswings  in  investor  sentiment  due  to  external  factors  (e.g.,  global  or  regional  developments).47 \nFurther depletion of NFRK also puts at risk its mandates of inter-generational equity and fiscal \nstabilization. By significantly using fiscal savings sourced from exploring a finite national asset in \nthe  recent  past,  the  NFRK  de-facto  stood  behind  the  capacity  of  the  government  to  keep \nmacroeconomic  and  banking  stability.48 But  these  mandates  are  now  at  risk,  also  due  to  the \nfrequency  of  significant  and  correlated  shocks  to  which  Kazakhstan  is  exposed:  the  current \ndollarization-related  financial  fragilities  in  Kazakhstan,  the  lack  of  a  developed  non-mineral \ntradables  economy  (and  of  a  non-oil  tax  base),  and  the  significant  exposure  to  terms-of-trade \nshocks are all, in many ways, the other side of the past oil revenue boom \"coin\". \n\n \n\ncurrency risks of its debt portfolio. However, the currently higher term premiums in the domestic market and lack of \nliquidity, as well as need for supporting the currency, force a revision in borrowing policy, towards external borrowing. \n43 $10.9  billion  in  2020 and  $5.8  billion in  2021  (based on  fiscal  projections).  By 2022\u20132025,  in  both  ADB  and  IMF \n\nDSAs, additional debt issuance is actually factored in to finance replenishment of the NFRK. \n\n44 The government adopted a new NFRK framework of rules in late 2016. These include the following: (i) the non-oil \ndeficit,  the main  anchor of  fiscal  policy,  was to  be  progressively  decreased  to  7  percent  of  GDP  by  2020, and 6 \npercent by 2025; (ii) guaranteed transfers from the NFRK were to be reduced from the US$8 billion of the time to \nUS$6 billion by 2020 (at 2016 exchange rates); (iii) the NFRK assets are to be maintained at least at 30 percent of \nGDP; (iv) privatization revenues are to flow to the NFRK; and (v) general government debt and external debt of state-\nowned  enterprises  are  not  to exceed  the size  of  NFRK  assets.  These  rules are  enforced  by  the  Commission on \nControl of Usage of NFRK Funds, which is chaired by NBK Governor and includes Prosecutor General, Chairman of \nNational Security Committee, Chairman of Accounts Committee, Chairman of Anti-Corruption Committee, as well as \nministers of finance and national economy as members. Any deviation from the rules need to be approved by the \nPresident of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Parliament.  \n\n45 Kostopoulos, Christos; Sarsenov, Ilyas. 2017.

In this 2017 \nreport, IMF noted that while the debt-to-GDP ratio was expected to remain low in the medium-term scenario, market \naccess on favorable terms could come under question with continued drainage of NFRK assets, as markets would \nexpect Kazakhstan to accumulate financial assets, rather than to drain them, given its oil resources. The IMF has \nhad  TA  discussions  with  MOF  to  simplify  the  fiscal  rule  design  when  timing  is  appropriate.  As  a  key  credibility \nconsideration, fiscal rules should not be changed when they are binding. A key objective however will remain to ring-\nfence the NFRK from further depletion. \n\n48 Kazakhstan benefited greatly from the oil price super-cycle of 2000\u20132014. But funds accumulated at the NFRK were \n(i) used for anti-crisis programs in 2007\u20132010 (during which the fiscal stimulus program totaled US$18 billion, or 15 \npercent of GDP), (ii) used in foreign-currency interventions in 2014\u20132015 (more than US$30 billion), and (iii) used to \nfinance part of the economic recovery package in 2014\u20132017 of more than US$20 billion (12 percent of GDP). \n\n \n\n\fImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe government has requested two loans from ADB\u2014(i) a regular loan of \u20ac454,298,000 \n28. \n($500 million equivalent) and (ii) a regular loan of \u20ac454,298,000 ($500 million equivalent), both \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  but  with  different  tenors,  to  help  finance  the  proposed \nProgram.  The  first  loan  will  have  a  10-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  with  an \nannual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  For  the  first  loan,  based  on  the  straight  line \nmethod, the average maturity is 6.75 years and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \nThe second loan will have a 5-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  For \nthe second loan, based on the straight line method, the average maturity is 4.25 years and there \nis no maturity premium payable to ADB.

In 2018, the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) report on Kazakhstan highlighted \nmany  of  the  same  strengths\u2014e.g.,  budget  reliability;  public  debt  management;  policy-based  fiscal  strategy  and \nbudgeting in general, and legislative scrutiny of budgets in particular; predictability and control in budget execution \nin  general,  and  internal  controls  and  audit  in  particular;  accounting  and  reporting  in  general,  as  well  as  external \nscrutiny and audit\u2014and also identified weak areas for improvement. \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nadministrative  barriers.  Procurement  is  decentralized  to  national  and  regional  bodies  and  is \nexecuted through the government's electronic procurement portal. Public procurement laws also \nwere continually updated to accommodate elements of e-procurement and the requirements of \nthe Eurasian Economic Union. A legal and institutional framework for combating corruption is in \nplace,  51 and  recent  progress  has  been  noteworthy. 52 ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and MOF. \n \n31. \nPoverty and social. Between 2000 and 2019, Kazakhstan made substantial progress in \nreducing  poverty.  As  the  economy  grew  by  an  average  of  7%  during  2001\u20132016,  the  national \npoverty rate dropped from 46.7% in 2001 to 6.6% in 2019. Since 2011, Kazakhstan consistently \nrecorded  low  unemployment  rates,  with more  than  25%  of the  employed  being  self-employed. \nThe current recessionary pressures, if not immediately addressed, may increase poverty levels.53 \nThe  government\u2019s  anti-crisis  package  is  sizable  and  comprehensive  enough  to  counter  these \nrisks. It includes a combination of (i) funding for additional health-related expenditures (which also \nring-fences the poor and most vulnerable from COVID-19-related health costs); (ii) initiatives to \nprovide financial  relief  to  SMEs  and  households;  (iii)  social  protection  initiatives  that  target the \npoor  and most vulnerable  (including  women);  and  (iv)  other fiscal  and  quasi-fiscal  expenditure \nmeasures to help employment recover faster.  \n \n32. \nGender.  The  Program  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  because  the \ncountercyclical response involves social sector measures to preserve the health, incomes, and \nlivelihoods of women, children, and low-income households. The Program reflects key features \nof an effective gender mainstreaming effort, in full recognition of the social vulnerability risks that \nwere identified. The participation of the working-age population in the labor force of Kazakhstan \nis 71.1%, and the country has the highest female labor force participation rate in Central Asia. \nHowever, the gender wage gap (in average wages, unemployment, and access to finance) that \nprevailed  until  the  current  crisis  implies  a  disproportionate  impact  of  the  ongoing  economic \ndisruption  on  women.  The  government\u2019s  planned  efforts  are  an  important  mitigating  factor. \nGender targets were fully integrated into the design and monitoring framework of the Program \n(Appendix 1), both at the outcome level and across all outputs. The proposed program will help \nmanage key gender risks, such as the (i) need for protection of frontline health workers (estimated \nto be at least 55% women); (ii) loss of business by individual entrepreneurs (52% of whom are \nwomen), particularly smaller-scale entrepreneurs (42% of which are women); (iii) loss of income \nby  those  employed  in  the  most  affected  sectors,  most  of  whom  are  women;  and  (iv)  need  for \nsocial assistance to poor households. The proposed Program will ensure that health workers who \nare directly handling COVID-19 cases (at least 55% women) will be provided with properly fitting \npersonal  protective  equipment  and  receive  salary  bonuses.  Women  entrepreneurs  as  well  as \nwomen  workers  will  be  provided  with  tax  and  other  financial  incentives.  Poor  households, \nincluding women-led families, will be provided with social payments and assistance. \n \nSafeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the Program \n33. \nis classified category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The \nProgram  is  not  expected  to  have  any  environmental  or  social  safeguard  impacts  within  the \nmeaning of the Safeguard Policy Statement. The ADB proceeds of the loan will not finance any \n\n \n\n51 The criminal code criminalizes active and passive bribery, attempted corruption, extortion, money laundering, abuse \nof office, and bribe facilitation by third parties. The Agency for Civil Service Affairs and Fight against Corruption has \nbeen coordinating the implementation of a comprehensive Anticorruption Strategy 2015\u20132025, adopted in 2014. \n52 Kazakhstan provides annual reports disclosing revenues from natural resource extraction. Companies disclose what \n\nthey have paid, and the government discloses what it has received.  \n\n53 The  estimates  presented  earlier  in  the  text  are  in  line  with  J.

The  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) engages continually with the government and other development \npartners to devise an effective and appropriate contingency plan, which \ncan  include  a  reorientation  of  resources  from  recovery  measures  to \nadditional income support. \n\nThe  government\u2019s  anti-crisis  measures  seem  targeted  and  sizable \nenough to ensure that the different dimensions of gender risk are fully \naddressed.  ADB  coordinates  with \nthe  government  and  other \nstakeholders in monitoring the situation, and in building the capacity of \nimplementing agencies for gender-based monitoring. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n35. \nThe government has assured ADB that the implementation of the Program shall conform \nto all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in the loan agreement.  \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n \n36. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\n(i)  the  loan  of  \u20ac454,298,000  to  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan  for  the  COVID-19  Active \nResponse and Expenditure Support Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nin  regular  terms,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 10 years, including \na grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially set \nforth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board; and \n\n(ii)  the  loan  of  \u20ac454,298,000  to  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan  for  the  COVID-19  Active \nResponse and Expenditure Support Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nin  regular  terms,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility; for a term of 5 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n\n   \n17 June 2020                                                                                \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMasatsugu Asakawa \n President \n\n54 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nAdverse impacts of COVID-19 on the population\u2019s health, incomes, and economic opportunities \nmitigateda \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nEffect of the Program \n \nSpread of the disease \nmanaged and of poverty \ncontained.b \n \n\nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\n \na.

April 2020. ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Manila. \nb   Given  the  uncertainties  about  the  pandemic's  further  course,  its  economic  effects,  the  need  for  the  government \nresponse to be flexible as the situation evolves, and because new data collection and reporting systems to monitor \nthe crisis are being developed and evolving, it is not yet possible to set more specific and realistic targets than those \nprovided  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (DMF).  Additional  indicators  to  measure  the  effects  may  be \nidentified  later  and  used  to  discuss  the  program\u2019s  effectiveness  as  comprehensively  as  possible  in  the  program \ncompletion report. \n\nc  The national poverty line is defined at 70% of the minimum subsistence rate or, on average for the first quarter of \n\n2020, T21,302. \n\nd   The bonuses are paid on top of the salary, on a monthly basis for the 3 months of March\u2013May, according to the risk \ncategorization of each medical employee. The highest-risk group (doctors and medical staff of intensive care and \nCOVID-19-designated facilities) receive 20 minimum wages (T850,000). The high-risk group (doctors and medical \nstaff  of  ambulance  services,  sanitation  aviation  staff)  receive  10  minimum  wages  (T425,000).  The  moderate-risk \ngroup  (e.g.,  sanitary  epidemiology  service  staff,  laboratory  staff,  doctors  and  medical  staff  of  regular  hospitals, \nmembers of regional emergency command centers) receive 5 minimum wages (T212,500). The payments are based \non actual work time spent by medical staff, based on work attendance and distribution data (which is available). Even \nthough more than 70% of health workers are women, ADB estimates that women will account for 55% of those in \nthe front line. This proportion will be monitored on a regular basis to ensure that the DMF indicator is updated as \nneeded. \n\ne  The ledger of food package recipients includes: children (6\u201318 years) subject to social payments (201,600 people); \nchildren  with  disabilities  under  16  years  and  people  with  disabilities  of  all  groups  and  ages  (692,000);  people  in \ncharge  of  caring  for  a  disabled  child  (82,000);  and  officially  registered  unemployed  people  (150,000).  This  totals \n1,125,600 target beneficiaries. \n\nf  This  would  include  about  32,000  households  currently  covered  by  the  unconditional  cash  transfer  program,  and \n129,000 households covered by the conditional cash transfer program (footnote f). The transfer programs include \nunconditional  and  conditional  cash  aid  under  the  government\u2019s  targeted  social  support  (TSS).  TSS  provides \ncomprehensive social assistance to low-income citizens, divided into 2 types: unconditional and conditional cash aid. \nUnconditional cash aid is provided to families with disabled members or families in which the only able-to-work family \nmember cannot find a job for objective reasons (such as caring for a child aged less than 3 years, a disabled child, \ndisabled persons, or an elderly person dependent on care and assistance). Unconditional cash aid is assigned for \nthe current quarter from the month when a person applies and is paid on a monthly basis. Conditional cash aid is \nintended for families with at least one able-bodied member, employed under the government\u2019s social contracts, and \nis  paid  for  a  maximum  of  3  months.  To  receive  TSS,  low-income  families  (citizens)  must  contact  the  Population \nEmployment Center at the place of residence or, in rural areas, the akim of the village, settlement, or rural district \nwith an application and an identification card. TSS is assigned to citizens with a per capita income that does not \nexceed the poverty rate per each family member. Thus, the TSS amount per person (family) is calculated as the \ndifference between the average per capita income and the poverty rate established in the region, taking into account \neach family member. \n\ng  As discussed in Para 19 of the main text, the program is designed to ensure that the overall fiscal stimulus package \nis implemented and monitored, since the complementarity of all its components is crucial to sustaining incomes and \nemployment recovery, and the individual targets across all three outputs. To reinforce this requirement, output 3 also \nincludes this as an indicator, implying that 8%\u20139% of GDP of net stimulus measures will be necessary. The logical \nframework for the proposed ADB assistance requires this to ensure an effective mitigation of the currently heightened \nsocial vulnerability risks. \n\nh   According to the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructural Development, as of 1 January 2020, 540,200 people had \napplied to the local executive bodies for the subsidized housing finance program, of which 212,500 were civil servants \nand  employees of  budgetary organizations (a majority  of  which  are  women); 120,500  were  families  with  a  single \nparent (who tend to be single mothers); 60,800 were orphans; 43,500 were from people with disabilities (groups 1 \nand 2); 47,800 were from large families; 21,100 were families with children and disabilities; 18,000 were pensioners; \nand 16,000 represented other categories. The housing finance program will be implemented off-budget, financed by \nthe issuance of municipal bonds to Baiterek. \n\nSource: ADB. \n\n \n\n\fLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=54188-001-3   \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n21 \n\nLoan Agreement \nDevelopment Coordination  \nInternational Monetary Fund Assessment Letter \nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy  \nRisk Assessment and Risk Management Plan  \nList of Ineligible Items  \nDebt Sustainability Analysis \nGender Monitoring Matrix \n\nSupplementary Documents \n9. \n10. \n11. \n\nSafeguards Assessment Matrix \nCOVID-19 Public Health Response and Countercyclical Response Policies \nNational Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan  \n\n \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n7. \n8. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nDEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n27 \n\nASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACCESS CRITERIA FOR THE COUNTERCYCLICAL SUPPORT FACILITY AND \nCOVID-19 PANDEMIC RESPONSE OPTION \n\nAccess Criteria \n1. Adverse Impact \nof Exogenous \nShocksa \n\nADB Staff Assessment \na. Fiscal Health costs are rising with the COVID-19 epidemic, with not only the medical emergency but also the implementation \nof health system preparedness measures, and the monitoring and tracing systems since early-January, ramping up dedicated \ncapacity in the health system to cope with worst case hospitalization scenarios, and subsidizing in 100% the COVID-related \nhealth  costs.  The  medical  emergency  is  being  kept  under  control  also  as  a  result  of  the  costly  COVID-19  readiness \nimplementation measures initiated in early-January 2020 to build health system response capacity before the epidemic arrived \nin the country. The significant effort to ramp up the testing operation and the inherent logistics are reinforcing the confidence \nin the entire operation. On the other hand, the strict social containment measures implemented from March onwards, i.e. right \nafter the first confirmed cases, have been effective at dampening the epidemiological growth of COVID-19 in Kazakhstan. \nThe healthcare emergency remains a serious challenge and its fiscal costs are likely to become sizable. \n \nb. Significant economic and fiscal costs of the social lockdown measures will result from can be observed in the ongoing \ndisruptions in business turnover and employment. A recent OECD reportb highlights that \u201cExperts estimate that 300,000 SMEs \nhave stopped working nation-wide. In Almaty, the number of workers in factories decreased by 266,000 people and 80% of \nentrepreneurs have suspended their activities. At least 1.5 million citizens are estimated to be on unpaid leave or have lost \ntheir jobs due to the outbreak of COVID-19. According to official data, SMEs in the sectors most likely to be severely affected \n(trade, tourism, and catering) are estimated to employ over 1.6 million workers\u201d. This economic disruption, if prolonged, can \nbe devastating in the non-oil economy if sustained job losses and bankruptcies cannot be avoided. The lockdown is impacting \nthe micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) sector in particular, as its turnover dropped by 75% according to recent \nenterprise surveys undertaken in early-April. These indicate that: (i) by 23 March, 48% of employees were already put on \nleave without pay and 13% had been terminated; and (ii) for Q2, 40% of employees were expected to be put on leave without \npay  and  12%  would  be  terminated.  Some  of  the  activities  hardest  hit  directly  were:  tourism,  hospitality,  education,  food \nservices, and manufacturing. Women can be most affected by restrictions on economic activity. Women account for more \nthan  65%  of  labor  force  in  some  of  the  most  effected  sectors  (e.g.  hospitality,  education,  wholesale  and  retail  trade), \nown/manage a significant number of microenterprises, and are also a significant share of the informal labor market. \n \nc. The second economic shock came with the significant oil price shock, with large fiscal and financial sector consequences. \nAs the COVID-19 pandemic is shutting down large segments of economies from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to \nEurope to the United States since late February 2020, it is also becoming lethal in many developing and emerging economies \nfor its global external effects. This is hitting Kazakhstan now with particular significance as well. The collapsing of international \nprices of  oil and  other commodities (which determine  85% of Kazakhstan\u2019s export revenue),  is now reinforced by  a clear \nglobal recessionary outlook for 2020. The resulting exchange rate pressures have also led to a hike in financial costs across \nthe economy. A sudden stop in capital flows has also hit emerging markets (EMs). April data shows cumulative outflows from \nEMs since the COVID-19 crisis began that are extraordinary in magnitude, even by the standards of the global financial crisis. \nThis sudden stop, coupled with low commodity prices and global recession, is closing down wholesale external funding lines \nto both financial and non-financial corporate sectors in Kazakhstan alike. This will directly hit financial firms (e.g. banks) with \noutstanding foreign-current debt that needs to be refinanced, but indirectly it will also affect the refinancing possibilities of all \nfirms and individuals with foreign-currency denominated debt. \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nd. Without a fiscal response, the economy can contract in real terms by 5.5% in 2020 (instead of the 4% growth that had also \nbeen projected on average for 2020-2023 as late as in February 2020). The ongoing collapse in export revenues brought \nabout exchange-rate pressures that the monetary authorities allowed to sway while raising policy rates to 12% (from 9.25%) \nto smooth the currency depreciation process. The foreign-exchange reserves that were spent were appropriately geared to \nsimply smooth this exchange-rate realignment. But  debt-servicing costs  in the economy  have\u2014also as a consequence\u2014\ngone up in both local currency credit and foreign currency credit contracts.  This is adding pressures to the asset quality of \nthe banking sector, which can also further constrain access to finance to SMEs going forward. These developments have \nforced significant downward revisions in the macroeconomic and fiscal outlook of Kazakhstan for 2020 now mired in deep \nrecession risks. The ongoing disruptions can leave medium-term scars in the productive potential of its non-oil economy too. \nPoverty rates could reach 11%\u201313%, and vulnerable segments of the population (including women) can be severely affected. \n \ne. Social Vulnerabilities, Poverty and Gender Risks. Unless countered, the sequence of shocks that have hit Kazakhstan can \nalso  impact  poverty  and  social  vulnerability  levels,  and  poverty  rates  could  reach  11%\u201313%.  Gender  risks  are  also \nrecognizable. The several vulnerability dimensions of the current situation can be disaggregated by each of the three shocks:  \n\n(i) the COVID-19 outbreak could bring a hike in hospitalization and medication costs that can overwhelm the budgets of \nthe poor and most vulnerable, if infected. It also puts workers in health most at risk of coming into contact with infected \ncases (more than 70% of health workers are women);  \n(ii) the strict social lockdown measures and other Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) of the government are crucial \nto  slowing-down  the  medical  emergency.  Non-Pharmaceutical  Interventions  (NPIs)  are  actions,  apart  from  getting \nvaccinated and taking medicine, that people and communities can take to help slow the spread of illnesses (NPIs are \nalso known as community mitigation strategies). But these measures pose significant risks to the livelihoods and income-\ngeneration in very specific activities where women have a high degree of participation. Women account for more than \n65% of the labor force in some of the most affected sectors by the current lockdowns. Some hard-hit activities in the \ninformal labor market also include a significant share of women.  These could imply a potentially disproportionate impact \non women;  \n(iii) Women could also be disproportionally affected by a deep recession, given existing gender disparities in wage levels \nand unemployment rates, and already disadvantaged access to finance in normal times. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. Countercyclical \nFiscal Response \ndevelopment \nexpenditures \n(more generally, a \ncountercyclical \nfiscal response)c \n\nf. The country\u2019s non-oil fiscal deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020 is now set to widen to 11% \n(from 8% in 2019, and an originally expected 7% for 2020), also a result of the current discretionary countercyclical efforts \nand interrupt its downward trajectory (it was 10% in 2017). \na. The government has laid out a strong countercyclical fiscal response to mitigate the health, economic and social \nimpacts of the pandemic-related shocks that are now hitting Kazakhstan. Fiscal measures to mitigate the disruptions \non business and employment have been targeted and gender-inclusive (including transfers to the vulnerable population and \nthe potentially-most affected segments of the labor market, which includes women). Countercyclical response plans were \napproved (including both tax and expenditure plans, and quasi-fiscal programs) to ensure financial stability and relaunch the \neconomic  recovery),  in  addition  to  devising  a  safety-net  to  those  that  lose  income.  This  is  presented  in  detail  in  the \nSupplementary Document and in the main text. It is crucial to prevent firm bankruptcies, extended job losses, and financial \ninstability. The proposed ADB assistance will help the government mitigate the medical and economic impacts caused by \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n29 \n\ncoronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19)  pandemic  on  Kazakhstan,  supporting  its  immediate  COVID-19  Health  Policy \nResponse,  measures  to  mitigate  social  distancing  disruptions  on  businesses  and  employment;  and  countercyclical  fiscal \nstimulus plans. The different measures are described in detail in the RRP and in the DMF. For example, in terms of social \nprotection and efforts to protect employment, here is what is already described in Table 4:  \n \n\n\u2022  Cash payments ($95\u2013$100 per month per person) for those who lost labor income under the state of emergency.a \nThe target is to reach 3 million people. All those that work in the informal labor market\u2014mostly women\u2014can apply. \nThis is implemented by the State Social Security Fund, and estimated to cost $877 million.  \n\n\u2022  A lower value-added tax rate was set for food,b and various other responses help mitigate the impact of higher food \nprices: a nationwide food supply program was quickly established and allocated T45.8 billion to local authorities to \nprovide free food sets to more than 1.1 million people (primarily elderly people, large families, and people with \ndisabilities, i.e., those registered in the social vulnerability ledger of the government). In parallel, the government \nintroduced price caps on essential foods. In sum, this initiative is estimated to cost $113 million. \n\n\u2022  To help vulnerable groups such as pensioners absorb the shock of a possible increase in food prices, the \n\n\u2022 \n\ngovernment increased all social payments by 10%. This would include about 32,000 households currently covered \nby the unconditional cash transfer program, and 129,000 households covered by conditional cash aid under the \ngovernment\u2019s targeted social support. This implied an allocation of an additional $503 million. \nIn addition to significant utility subsidies and automatic reductions in the tax base, in March 2020, the government \nintroduced tax support measures targeting mainly micro and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in \nagriculture, trade, and services. This includes a reduction to zero in the rates of property tax (for retail, trade, \ncatering, entertainment, and hospitality businesses), land tax (for agricultural producers), and income tax (for \nindividual entrepreneurs). For SMEs in catering, lodging, transportation, consulting, and tourism, the government \nalso introduced a 6-month exemption from payroll taxes. The government deferred until 1 June 2020 all payments \nof taxes and other compulsory budget payments for SMEs, stopped enforcing the collection of overdue tax \nobligations, suspended the accrual of penalties for overdue tax obligations until August 2020, and extended tax \nreporting deadlines until September 2020. These are estimated to cost close to $5.68 billion. \n\n \nb. The planned fiscal response effort is not only sizable but also properly calibrated to target the segments of the population \nthat are most vulnerable to the current sequence of shocks and risks. It implies a stimulus of 8%\u20139% of GDP in 2020. This \npositive assessment is also shared by the IMF. As stated in the IMF Assessment Letter (Para 8), \u201cthe immediate priority is \nto mitigate the effect of the shocks on the economy. The authorities\u2019 anti-crisis package has the appropriate mix of \nmeasures and targeting to achieve this.\u201d In tables A4.1\u2013A4.2 below we present how the different initiatives fit within the \noverall fiscal stimulus package (split between on-budget and off-budget measures). All these measures are fiscal in nature, \nbut we refer to those that are off-budget as quasi-fiscal. The proposed Program captures them all, through three outputs:  \n \n\nImmediate COVID-19 Health Response Implemented (costing $338 million);  \n\n(i) \n(ii)  Social Protection and Employment Protection Measures Implemented ($7.18 billion); and  \n(iii)  Economic Stimulus Delivered ($5.97 billion). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\nc. It is crucial for the intended objectives of the government response that the entire package is implemented in 2020, which \nwill imply about 8\u20139% of gross domestic product (GDP) in automatic and discretionary stimulus measures (a total of about \n$13 billion). This of course also includes the fiscal implications of the COVID-19 Health Sector and Social Risk Mitigation \nmeasures  that  were  described  above.  All  these  measures  are  part  of  the  package  considered  in  the  proposed  logical \nframework for the ADB assistance. We also present here how the entire package of measures is divided between what is \nexplicitly reflected in the government budget on one-hand, and what is off-budget, in terms of initiatives that are not financed \nby the government budget directly. \n\nNet Fiscal Response: $7.0 billion (4.6% of GDP), ON-BUDGET \n\n \nTable A4.1 \n\nAmount* \n$503 million  \n\n$682 million \n$239 million \n\nPurpose \nSocial  payments  increase  and  social  assistance \n(equal to minimum wage) \nEmployment Roadmap program \nEnbek and Auyl Besygi program (130,000 jobs) \n\n$306 million \n\nBusiness Road Map and support for Agribusiness \n\n$285 million \n\nEpidemiological and other healthcare measures  \n\n$53.4 million \n\n$4.6 billion  \n\n$1.09 billion \n\n$113 million \n\nProcurement of supplies, including personal \nprotective gears, disinfectants and medicines, and \nmedical devices  \nCompensation  of  the  budget  losses  (including \ntaxes, republican and local) \nOther  outright  expenses  (including  utility  bills \nsubsidies) \nFood distribution \n\nNotes \nPension, stipends and other payments  \n\nOutput \n\nAdditional allocation from state budget \nMonotowns  and  rural  employment  stimulus \n(microloans and grants) \nImport substitution and manufacturing projects  \n\nfinancial  stimulus \n\nIncluding \nworkers  \nFor use at both central and regionals levels \n\nfor  healthcare \n\nIncludes compensation for tax expenditures, tax \nlosses and exchange rate losses  \n  \n\nThe significant costs of reduction in food-\nrelated taxes are not counted here \n\n \n\n2 \n\n3 \n3 \n\n3 \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\n3 \n\n2 \n\n2 \n\nTotal: $7.9 billion \n(5.2% of GDP) \n\nAfter deductions from and cancellations of original state expenditure plans of around $0.9 billion: \nTotal new tax and expenditure plans: $7.0 billion \n\nNote: All amounts are in KZT at the exchange rate of KZT440 per USD. \nSource: Ministry of Finance.  \n\n \n\nAmount* \n\n$1.59 billion \n\nQuasi-Fiscal Expenditures: $5.6 billion (3.7% of GDP), OFF-BUDGET \nPurpose \n\nNotes \n\nTable A4.2 \n\nEmployment Roadmap program, off-budget resource \nmobilization by Baiterek Holding (SOE) \n\nAims  to  create  250,000  jobs  through  project \nfinancing sourced from local bond issuances \n\n \nOutput \n\n3 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\n$877 million \n\n$2.27 billion  \n\n$886 million \n\nMonthly  social  assistance  of  $100  to  workers  who \nlost jobs due to the State of Emergency \n\u2018Economy  of  Simple  Things\u2019  program  and  working \ncapital finance from NBK to SMEs \nFinancing construction of affordable housing  \n\nFinanced  from  existing  savings  of  the  State \nSocial Security Fund (off-budget fund) \n6% interest rate on loans and 8% for working \ncapital financed by NBK \nFinanced  through  municipal  bonds \nregions \n\nin  16 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n3 \n\nNote: All amounts are in KZT at the exchange rate of KZT440 per USD. \nSource: Ministry of Finance. \n\n \nd. As head of the State Commission on the State of Emergency, the President of Kazakhstan has taken leadership for the \npublic announcement of measures, in complement to the approved decrees. The sequence of decisions and announcements \nis presented here as a way of formalizing the list of official sources for what is presented above: \n \n\n(i) \n\nOn March 15, a decree was approved \u2018On introduction of state of emergency\u2019: \nhttp://www.akorda.kz/ru/legal_acts/decrees/o-vvedenii-chrezvychainogo-polozheniya-v-respublike-kazahstan.  \n\n(ii)  On March 16, the state of emergency was announced: \n\nhttp://www.akorda.kz/ru/speeches/internal_political_affairs/in_speeches_and_addresses/televizionnoe-\nobrashchenie-glavy-gosudarstva-kasym-zhomarta-tokaeva. \n\n(iii)  On March 16, a decree was approved \u2018On measures for ensuring socio-economic stability\u2019: \n\nhttp://www.akorda.kz/ru/legal_acts/decrees/o-merah-po-obespecheniyu-socialno-ekonomicheskoi-stabilnosti.  \n\n(iv)  Also on March 16, another decree was approved \u2018On further measures for stabilizing the economy\u2019: \n\nhttp://www.akorda.kz/ru/legal_acts/decrees/o-dalneishih-merah-po-stabilizacii-ekonomiki.  \n\n(v)  On March 23, all these instructions to government were made public: \n\nhttp://www.akorda.kz/ru/speeches/internal_political_affairs/in_speeches_and_addresses/vystuplenie-prezidenta-\nkasym-zhomarta-tokaeva-na-zasedanii-gosudarstvennoi-komissii-po-chrezvychainomu-polozheniyu.  \n(vi)  On March 31, all the anti-crisis measures were re-stated during a public update on the COVID-19 situation: \n\nhttp://www.akorda.kz/ru/speeches/internal_political_affairs/in_statements_and_congratulations/zayavlenie-glavy-\ngosudarstva-kasym-zhomarta-tokaeva.  \n\n(vii)  On April 10, a first report to the State Commission on the State of Emergency was delivered: \n\nhttp://www.akorda.kz/ru/speeches/internal_political_affairs/in_speeches_and_addresses/vystuplenie-glavy-\ngosudarstva-na-zasedanii-gosudarstvennoi-komissii-po-chrezvychainomu-polozheniyu.  \n\n(viii)  On April 14, a decree extending the state of emergency was approved: \n\nhttp://www.akorda.kz/ru/legal_acts/decrees/o-prodlenii-deistviya-chrezvychainogo-polozheniya-v-respublike-\nkazahstan.  \n\n(ix)  On April 21, in complement to the decree \u2018On measures for ensuring socio-economic stability\u2019, additional \n\nmeasures were approved: http://www.akorda.kz/ru/legal_acts/decrees/o-nekotoryh-merah-po-stabilizacii-\nekonomiki.  \n\n(x)  On April 29, a new decree extended the state of emergency: http://www.akorda.kz/ru/legal_acts/decrees/o-\n\nprodlenii-deistviya-chrezvychainogo-polozheniya-v-respublike-kazahstan-1.  \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n3. Pre-shock \nRecord of Sound \nMacroeconomic \nManagementd \n\n \n\n(xi)  On May 11, the President of Kazakhstan announced, at the final meeting of Commission on the State of \n\nEmergency, that the State of Emergency was finished, and that the State Commission was reorganized into a \nCommission for restoring economic growth. Some measures for promoting economic recovery were also \nannounced: http://www.akorda.kz/ru/speeches/internal_political_affairs/in_speeches_and_addresses/vystuplenie-\nglavy-gosudarstva-na-zaklyuchitelnom-zasedanii-gosudarstvennoi-komissii-po-chrezvychainomu-polozheniyu.  \n\n(xii)  On May 19, a comprehensive economic recovery plan for measures until the end 2020 was adopted by the \n\ngovernment: https://online.zakon.kz/Document/?doc_id=39292197#pos=416;-35 . It was also announced on the \nsame day: https://primeminister.kz/ru/news/pravitelstvo-prinyalo-kompleksnyy-plan-po-vosstanovleniyu-\nekonomicheskogo-rosta-194594 .  \n\n \na. Growth was relatively strong in early 2020 \u2014above 4%\u2014 and the macroeconomic outlook for 2020-22 was in line with the \ngood performance of recent years: growth projections were of about 4% on average on the back of a projected continuation \nof strong growth in the Kazakhstan non-oil economy. As generally observed by different institutions and the ADB team (and \nexplicitly stated in the IMF Assessment Letter), Kazakhstan\u2019s macroeconomic management prior to the shock had been \ngenerally sound and the country\u2019s growth performance had been strong. \n \nb. Kazakhstan\u2019s new monetary regime has served its macroeconomic management well, with stable inflation (within the 4\u20136 \npercent band of the inflation target) and added exchange-rate flexibility. The NBK improved its systemic liquidity management \nand interest rate transmission mechanism, and it remains committed to developing it further. This is a priority to help monetary \npolicy\u2019s traction over credit conditions in the economy and dedollarization. \n \nc. Kazakhstan\u2019s fiscal management had been credible before the crisis, and with the non-oil fiscal deficit (and the cyclically-\nadjusted non-oil deficit) on a downward trajectory and with sustainable levels of public debt. Kazakhstan has substantial fiscal \nspace and sustainable levels of public debt, and the planned use of buffers in the current juncture is fully justified. As assessed \nby  the  ADB  team  and  confirmed  by  IMF  analysis  (IMF  Assessment  Letter),  Kazakhstan\u2019s  public  sector  debt  will  remain \ncomfortably sustainable for the foreseeable future, and the current countercyclical fiscal effort is making a very appropriate \nand much needed use of the available fiscal space. Public finances are this expected to remain sound, as also shown by \nprojections of fiscal balances in relation to the economy\u2019s cyclical position: the planned adjustments in the primary deficit are \nproperly calibrated to continue supporting growth while dampening the growth of Gross Public Debt Ratio. \n \nd.  The  sound  pre-shock  sound  macroeconomic  management  record  of  the  government  has  now  been  instrumental  in \nprojecting credibility to its recent monetary and macroprudential policy decisions in banking and exchange-rate markets. The \nlatter have been very effective at managing key trade-offs: in early March, the NBK raised its policy rate and intervened for a \ntime to stabilize the foreign exchange (FX) market (interventions were intended to avoid disruptive corrections and did not \ntarget  any  particular  level  of  the  exchange  rate),  but  it  has  since  adjusted  its  policy  rate  given  emerging  weaknesses  in \naggregate demand (while keeping some controls on to limit speculative FX trading). The tenge initially depreciated by about \n18 percent; it has stabilized and regained some of its value recently.  \n \ne. Kazakhstan\u2019s PFM systems are reliable and well-tested. This will be Kazakhstan\u2019s 3rd ADB CSF, which will also benefit \nfrom an overall sound institutional budgetary framework. In 2018, a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) \nreport on Kazakhstane  highlighted many of the same strengths as the ADB Governance Risk Assessmentf that had been \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n33 \n\n4. Structural \nreforms (in the \ncase of the CPRO: \nhealth sector \nresponse to \nCOVID-19 \nepidemic) g \n\ncompleted a few months earlier, which were:  budget  reliability, public debt  management, policy-based fiscal strategy and \nbudgeting in general and legislative scrutiny of budgets in particular, predictability and control in budget execution in general \nand internal controls and audit in particular, accounting and reporting in general, as well as external scrutiny and audit. The \nweaknesses that were also identified have been important areas of ongoing improvement as well.  \n \nd. As assessed by the ADB team and confirmed by IMF analysis (IMF Assessment Letter), Kazakhstan\u2019s public sector debt \nwill remain comfortably sustainable for the foreseeable future, and the current countercyclical fiscal effort is making a very \nappropriate and much needed use of the available fiscal space. \n \na. The government implemented a robust response to control the spread of the COVID-19 and provide urgent medical support \nto affected population. The government has collaborated closely with the WHO, UN agencies and international development \npartners to strengthen the health response.   \n \nb. The authorities: (i) initiated readiness preparations in early-January, i.e. more than 2-months before the first COVID case \nin  Kazakhstan,  (ii)  immediately  built-up  the  capacity  of  the  health-care  system  to  cope  with  worst-case  hospitalization \nscenarios; and (iii) announced a 30-day state of emergency from 16 March onwards (first cases reported on 13 March), now \nextended; with a series of other strict quarantine and social lockdown measures. All these are extensively described in the \nSupplementary Document, and summarized in the main text of this RRP and here: \n\n\u2022  Early Pre-COVID-19 Readiness and Public Health Response Measures. The Government of Kazakhstan started \npreparations well ahead of infection breakout in the country and undertook a set of swift and decisive containment, \nhealthcare  and  other  social  measures  in  response  to  COVID-19.  This  was  done  in  close  coordination  with \ndevelopment  partners  and  governments  of  neighboring  countries.  On  6  January  2020  the  Ministry  of  Healthcare \n(MoH)  approved  the  main  preparedness  activities  to  mitigate  epidemiological  outbreaks.  International  travelers \ndepending  on  the  country  of  origin  placed  under  the  fourteen  days  mandatory  isolation  of  self-quarantine.h  All \ntransportation  between  Kazakhstan  and  countries  highly  affected  by  COVID-19  has  been  suspended  since  3 \nFebruary  2020.  Screening  points  on  entry  and  medical  monitoring  of  those  coming  to  Kazakhstan  from  countries \naffected by COVID-19 was established. MOH approved the COVID-19 infection treatments clinic protocol in early \nFebruary.i During February\u2013March 2020, the government prepared 27,000 beds (28% of total hospital beds in the \ncountry)  for  hospitalization  of  COVID-19  patients  and  contact  persons,  including  182  resuscitation  beds  with \nappropriate  equipment  (mechanical  ventilation  devices  and  monitors,  etc.).  MOH  also  mobilized  more  than  10 \nthousand medical workers to provide COVID-related medical care and has reserved additional reserve of 802 trained \nspecialists for standby deployment. \n\n\u2022  Medical and Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions upon the outbreak of COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, the first \nimported cases were detected, confirmed, all immediately isolated and treated. Initial infections were spread in Nur-\nSultan (the capital city) and Almaty (the largest city) and all contacts were quarantined and tested. As an immediate \nreaction,  the  Emergency  Operations  Center  (EOC)  was  established  by  the  government  and  the  EOC  started \nmonitoring (on a 24 hours basis) COVID-19 situation globally, regionally, and on the country level. The EOC also \ncollected  information  on  how  many  persons  arrived  from  affected  countries,  and  those  that  arrived  from  highly \naffected countries were placed on 14-day quarantine.j Following the announcement of COVID-19 as a pandemic, the \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n5. Debt \nsustainabilityp \n\n \n\nstate of emergency was declared and still remains in place to date.k The government deployed regional response \nteams,  consisting  of  local  government,  healthcare,  social  care,  civil  society,  and  private  sector  representatives  to \nidentify  corresponding  needs,  support  vulnerable  groups,  establish  feedback  mechanism  and  monitor  response \ntransmission. Dedicated ambulatory teams were assigned in every region to provide care and transport of suspected \nand confirmed COVID-19 case to designated hospitals. The National Reference Laboratory in Almaty received test \nkits from Russia, PRC, and WHO in March, and jointly with the National Biotechnology Center started to develop own \ntesting systems. On 6 April, the country received additional  250,000 tests  and ordered  an  additional 300,000. To \ndate,  no  other  DMC  in  Asia  tests  more  in  per  capita  terms  than  Kazakhstan.  Kazakhstan  has  intensified  its \nsurveillance  by  enhancing  capacity  of  active  case  finding.l  The  EOC  developed  a  geographic  information  system \n(GIS) tools to conduct monitoring of COVID-19 spread.m MOH with assistance of development partners conducting \ncontinuous  procurement  of  additional  stockpiles  to  ensure  the  availability  of  essential  medical  disposables  and \nequipment in the designated healthcare facilities. Overall, the government allocated $53.4 million for procurement of \nsupplies, including for the procurement personal protective gears, disinfectants and medicines and medical devices \non a central and regional level. In March 2020,  the government has announced plans to  allocate additional $285 \nmillion  to  enhance  the  capacity  of  the  healthcare  system  (these  $285  million  are  also  for  anti-epidemiological \nmeasures such as, e.g., payment of bonuses to doctors and other employees,  grocery and household packages, \ncommunication services; the total of T125.2 billion includes T40.6 billion for premiums to doctors in the front line, \nT19.5 billion for payment to medical organizations, T14.8 billion for the preparation of three medical complexes, T30.8 \nmillion for food and household sets, T8.1 billion for premiums to employees and medical workers of law enforcement \nbodies as well as military personnel of the National Guard, T4.1 billion for communication services, and T5.6 billion \nforensic medical examination). Three new fully-equipped medical complexes were set-up in record time. In terms of \ndirect healthcare support, the government immediately extended access of uninsured citizens to receive full medical \ncare until 1 July 2020. Appropriate public communication has also been established.n   \n\nc. The government\u2019s health readiness plans are comprehensive, are being fully Implemented, and are perceived to have been \neffective at keeping the medical emergency under control so far, in terms of capacity to cope with current and worse \nhospitalization scenarios. As publicly stated by the WHO Regional Director on May 13, 2020,o the Kazakhstan experience \nis a great example of proactive efforts to stabilize the COVID-19 situation, with strong surveillance, extensive testing, including \nHealth  Workers,  digitalized  data  collection,  timely  prevention  &  intensified  contact  tracing,  and  of  treating  patients \nappropriately. But the situation remains dangerous, and the authorities remain ready to deploy additional measures. \n  \na. Kazakhstan\u2019s public sector debt will remain comfortably sustainable for the foreseeable future. The current fiscal effort is \nmaking a very appropriate and much needed use of the available fiscal space. Kazakhstan public sector remains a net creditor \nat this stage, and its projected debt levels are expected to remain sustainable for the foreseeable future (and projected to rise \nto  29-31%  by  2025).  See  the  debt  sustainability  analysis  (DSA)  conducted  by  ADB  in  early-May  2020.  The  fundamental \nconclusions  of  the  exercises  presented  in  the  DSA  are  very  much  in  line  with  the  following  key  statements  in  the  IMF \nAssessment Letter: \u201cWith consolidation over the medium-term, public debt is projected to rise moderately\u2014from 20 percent \nof GDP in 2019 to 29 percent in 2025. Debt remains sustainable, and buffers are expected to remain strong\u2014at around 30 \npercent of GDP, in line with the threshold under the authorities\u2019 fiscal rules (Para 8)\u201d. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n35 \n\n6. Coordination  \nwith the IMFr \n\nb. The current fiscal effort is making a very appropriate and much needed use of the available fiscal space. Kazakhstan public \nsector remains a net creditor at this stage, and its projected debt levels are expected to remain sustainable for the foreseeable \nfuture (29% by 2025).  \n\nc.  Borrowing  from  ADBq  (and  from  any  other  source  of  concessional  finance)  will  have  a  minimal  (or  negligible)  but  still \nbeneficial impact on debt-to-GDP ratio going forward (and therefore on debt sustainability). This is implicit in the comparison \nwith the counterfactual scenario (on which a DSA is normally and conservatively based on, implicitly) in which deficit-financing \nwas were to be done on market-based pricing terms (even if not available in 2020). Sovereign interest rates on the 10-year \nbonds issued in tenge have increased by about 10% since the beginning of March; likewise, the value of the associated credit \ndefault swaps (CDS) has increased by about 40%. Any concessional financing will have a positive impact on Kazakhstan\u2019s \nprojected gross debt levels, as the latter are predicated on market-based borrowing terms. \n\nd.  Large  tapping  of  the  NFRK  to  finance  the  crisis  response  is  not  expected  to  affect  the  target  of  30%  GDP  by  2025,  a \nthreshold in Kazakhstan\u2019s fiscal rules and still a significant buffer. Thus, the Kazakhstan government is expected to remain \nan external new creditor till 2024\u20132025 at least. See the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) conducted by ADB in early-May \n2020. \n\ne. International foreign-exchange reserves are projected to continue at import coverage ratios above 6\u20136.5, which is both \nsizable and fully adequate to address external debt financing issues and episodes of exchange-rate pressure.   \na. ADB keeps consulting with IMF and discusses macroeconomic forecasts, emerging risks to the macroeconomic and fiscal \noutlook,  and  the  assumptions  that  underpin  projected  impact  of  the  government\u2019s  countercyclical  fiscal  (and  quasi-fiscal) \nstimulus efforts. The World Bank (WB) also holds frequent discussions with ADB on these issues, and the frequency of these \nhave increased with the COVID-19 pandemic. ADB and IMF agree with the appropriateness of government\u2019s countercyclical \nresponse  to  the  current  crisis.  IMF  has  updated  its  DSA  for  ADB  benefit  after  its  recent  informal  consultations  with  the \ngovernment (post Article IV report), and discussions took place on its assumptions. This work is the basis for the forecasts in \nthe IMF Assessment Letter.  \n \nb. IMF has also provided an its Assessment Letter to ADB in April 2020, which also describes states, amongst other issues, \nits support for the government\u2019s anti-crisis measures as an appropriate and well-calibrated use of available fiscal space. It \nalso describes the constructive consultations between the IMF and with the Government of Kazakhstan. As follows. \u201cArticle \nIV consultations are conducted annually, and Kazakhstan receives technical assistance (TA) from the IMF. Relations with \nKazakhstan continue to be characterized by a fruitful policy dialogue, and recent TA has focused on monetary operations, \nrevenue  administration,  public  financial  management,  and  statistics.  The  last  Article  IV  consultation  was  concluded  on \nJanuary 27, 2020 and the staff report was published shortly thereafter (IMF Country Report No. 20/32). The report noted that \nthe authorities\u2019 track record of macroeconomic management prior to the shock had been generally sound and that growth \nperformance had been strong, in an often-challenging environment. It noted that further work is needed to step up structural \nreforms  and  diversification  and  to  improve  governance.\u201d  Although  the  IMF  is  not  involved  in  the  financing  side  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s countercyclical support efforts,s it is currently actively engaged with the government across all the key areas \nrelated  to  macroeconomic  surveillance  and  fiscal  risks,  financial  sector  stability,  and  also  on-going  work  in  financial \nsupervision and monitory policy efforts.   \n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nADB = Asian  Development Bank, CSF = countercyclical support facility, DSA =  debt sustainability analysis, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = \nInternational Monetary Fund, NBK = National Bank of Kazakhstan, NFRK = National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan, NPI = Non-Pharmaceutical \nInterventions, OECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, PFM = public financial management. \na  This sub-criteria reads as: \u201c(\u2026) In the case of the CPRO, the DMC should demonstrate that, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has experienced, or is likely to \nexperience: (i) a severe decline in growth; and (ii) fiscal and financial sector stress. This may be demonstrated through the economic, and health and population \nimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on poor or vulnerable groups.\u201d \n\nb   https://www.oecd.org/eurasia/competitiveness-programme/central-asia/COVID-19-CRISIS-IN-KAZAKHSTAN.pdf \nc   This subcriteria reads as: \u201cThe government has an effective countercyclical development expenditure/policy program to be supported by the CSF; and is committed \nto its implementation. The program includes social protection measures targeting the poor or vulnerable groups. In the case of the CPRO, the DMC\u2019s countercyclical \ndevelopment expenditure/policy program should also include measures that directly address COVID-19 related impacts. The development policy letter should describe \nthe government\u2019s countercyclical expenditure/policy program including its COVID-19 relates measures and its commitment to implement such program\u201d. \n\nd   This sub-criteria reads as: \u201cIn the case of the CPRO, the DMC should demonstrate that the quality and size of the planned adjustment measures, are conducted within \na sound budgetary framework. This may include the presentation of fiscal response measures that are comprehensive, but which are still within a broadly sustainable \nmacroeconomic framework. DMCs with debt sustainability issues will be required to closely follow the requirements set out in para. 1(v).\u201d \n\ne   https://www.pefa.org/assessments/summary/266 \nf   ADB. 2017. Kazakhstan Republic: Country Governance Risk Assessment. Manila. ADB completed a governance risk assessment (GRA) in 2017 according to the \nimplementation guidelines of ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan. The assessment had already concluded in 2017 Kazakhstan had made good \nprogress in building institutions to manage fiscal revenues and expenses and in strengthening country systems in PFM, public procurement and combating corruption \nwith due consideration of the checks and balances between the executive and other branches of the government. \n\ng   This sub-criteria reads as: \u201c(\u2026) In the case of the CPRO in place of the emphasis on structural reforms, the DMC should demonstrate that credible and proactive \nsteps are being taken to address the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its economic impacts on the population, particularly on poor and vulnerable groups. The DMC\u2019s \nCOVID-19  pandemic  response  plan may  include a  wide  range  of  measures  to  address  the  public  health  or  economic impacts  of  the  pandemic.  Where  relevant, \nreference may also be made to medium and longer-term public health and preventative measures that the DMC plans to adopt, particularly those which are intended \nto receive support from conventional PBL\u201d. \n\nh  An Inter-sectoral Committee on COVID-19 chaired by the Deputy Prime-Minister was established to ensure full coordination and an action plan was approved on 29 \n\nJanuary 2020 for immediate implementation. \n\nI    The protocol is continuously discussed with leading international specialists and updated to reflect the latest developments on diagnostics and treatment of coronavirus \n\ninfection. MoH with the support of WHO and the involvement of national stakeholders continues to identify main areas of improvement in the overall response. \n\nj   Those coming from other affected countries were putted under medical monitoring via primary health care centers. \nk   All places of mass gatherings were closed, public events were cancelled, large family commemorative events have been banned. Stringent enforcement measures \naimed at preventing the spread of the disease, such as penalties for persons evading medical examinations, have been applied. A declaration of quarantine and \nlockdown was announced on 17 March 2020 for the country\u2019s three largest cities, and subsequently introduced in other regions. \n\nl    Currently MoH with the support of WHO continues to improve the system for contact tracing and monitoring. \nm   The Biosafety Research Institute (BIR) jointly with the National Center for Biotechnology announced a start of coronavirus vaccine research and development in \n\nKazakhstan. BIR has a formal agreement with WHO for this work. \n\nn   A  hotline  was  established  for  medical  professionals  and the  general  population.  Information  on  the  ongoing  COVID-19  outbreak,  and measures  of  the  individual \nprotection,  is  circulated  through  various  means  including  daily  briefings  on  TV,  radio  and  social  media  (Facebook,  Telegram  and  etc.).  A  web-page \n(www.coronavirus2020.kz) with exhaustive information, including updates on the situation, prevention measures, the state support and fact-checking features. The \nMinistry  of  Industry  and  Infrastructure  Development  created  interactive  communication  map  with  the  live  update  information  on  availability  and  accessibility  of \ntransportation throughout the country. \n\no   https://twitter.com/hans_kluge/status/1260277518327844866. \np  This sub-criteria reads as: \u201cThe borrower\u2019s debt sustainability, including potential impacts of prospective CSF assistance, should be confirmed. International reserves \nare determined to be adequate, taking into account the imports coverage ratio and the short-term external debt financing requirement. Relevant indicators may be \nbased on the debt sustainability analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, or a similar assessment when such a joint analysis is not \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n37 \n\nconducted. In the case of the CPRO, the expansion of eligibility to include group A DMCs means that many will be at high or moderate risk of debt distress. To be \neligible  for  CPRO  support,  all  DMCs  must  be  able  to  demonstrate  that  the  assistance  provided  by  ADB  will  be  integrated  into  a  fiscal  framework  that  does  not \njeopardize the borrower\u2019s debt sustainability or exacerbate weaknesses in fiscal sustainability. Specific reference should be made to the size of the CPRO assistance \nrelative to the borrower\u2019s debt sustainability. Reference to support being received from other development partners should also be made. \nq   The proposed CPRO assistance to Kazakhstan will constitute less than 3% of the country\u2019s gross public debt by end-2020, and 0.6% of GDP. \nr  This sub-criteria reads as: \u201cIf the IMF is not involved in crisis response, ADB will ensure that the country has had constructive consultations with the IMF, such as \nrecently completed or ongoing Article IV consultations.  For both CSF and CPRO, ADB should secure an assessment letter from the IMF confirming the soundness \nof the government\u2019s macroeconomic management and other policies before the Board of Directors considers the proposed assistance. ADB should work closely with \nits counterparts at the IMF to determine that the CSF or CPRO and any related conventional PBL are appropriate, despite the absence of an IMF program.\u201d \n\ns   By law, the Government of Kazakhstan is not allowed to seek IMF fiscal financing (budget support). By law, the Government of Kazakhstan can only seek budget \nsupport from development institutions like ADB or WB. By law, IMF financing can only be sought by the NBK (as the issuer of liabilities), which would probably only \noccur for balance-of-payments stress reasons. As stated above, Kazakhstan foreign-exchange reserves are projected to continue at import coverage ratios above 6-\n6.5, which is both sizable and fully adequate to address external debt financing issues or episodes of exchange-rate pressure. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 14 May 2020) \n \n", "Currency unit \nT1.00 \n$1.00 \n \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n \n", "tenge (T) \n$0.00249 \nT401.8000 \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nCOVID-19 \nCPRO \nCSF \nGDP \nIMF \nMOF \nMOH \nNFRK \nNPI \nPRC \nSMEs \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \ncoronavirus disease \nCOVID-19 pandemic response option \nCountercyclical Support Facility \ngross domestic product \nInternational Monetary Fund \nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Healthcare \nNational Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan \nnon-pharmaceutical intervention \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises \n", "NOTE \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to United States dollars.  \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n \n"]}
