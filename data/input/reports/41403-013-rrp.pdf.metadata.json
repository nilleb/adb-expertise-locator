Through a \nproposed  stand-alone  technical  assistance  (TA)  project  that  will  complement  the  project  and  be \nprocessed  in  2015,  the  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB)  will  also  provide  capacity  development \nsupport  to  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Handicraft  (MIH)  in  the  areas  of  sector  reform  and \nregulation. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nSince its full reintegration into the international development community after elections in \n3. \n1993, Cambodia has continued to rebuild and recover from a conflict-affected past. Investment \nin  the  urban  water  supply  subsector  since  1993  has  centered  primarily  on  Phnom  Penh,  the \ncapital  and  largest  city,  while  infrastructure  and  institutional  development  of  other  public \nwaterworks  (PWWs)  across  the  country  have  suffered  from  inadequate  levels  of  investment. \nThese  PWWs  have  relied  mostly  on  official  development  assistance  from  numerous  bilateral \nand  multilateral  development  partners  for  financial  support,  including  ADB.  Structural  and \norganizational  weaknesses  in  the  water  sector  include  a  lack  of  corporate  status  for  PWWs, \ninsufficient  autonomy  and  accountability,  and  a  high  degree  of  control  by  the  central \ngovernment.  The  lack  of  investment  has  meant  that  PWWs  operate  unsustainably  and  deliver \nsubstandard  services.  Rapid  urbanization  has  exacerbated  the  problem,  and  many  urban \nresidents  lack  access  to  adequate  and  safe  water  supply  and  sanitation  services.  Typical \nproblems  include  old  piping,  inadequate  system  coverage,  poor  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M), intermittent supply of water, water quality issues, and high levels of nonrevenue water \n(NRW).3 Tariff  structures  vary  among  the  PWWs,  and  are  rarely  adequate  to  cover  the  true \ncosts  of  providing  the  water  service.  This  situation  is  in  stark  contrast  to  the  strong \nmanagement, corporatization, staff development, and efficiency that have allowed Phnom Penh \nWater Supply Authority (PPWSA) to flourish over the same period, with support from ADB and \nother development partners. Today, PPWSA is one of the most efficient water utilities in Asia. \n \nCambodia\u2019s  current  population  is  estimated  to  be  14.7  million,  spread  through  24 \n4. \nprovinces and 26 cities and district towns.4 About 20% of the country\u2019s people live in urban areas. \nUrbanization is far outstripping rural population growth, and the urban population is expected to \nreach  30%  of  the  national  total,  by  2030.  Cambodia\u2019s  2015  Millennium  Development  Goals \ntarget to provide 80% of people living in urban areas with access to improved water sources and \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2012.  Urban  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project. \n\nManila. \n\n3  Nonrevenue water is defined as the difference between the amount of water put into the distribution system and the \n\namount of water billed to consumers. \n\n4  Royal Government of Cambodia. 2013. Cambodia Intercensal Population Survey 2013. Phnom Penh. \n\n\f74%  with  access  to  improved  sanitation  have  been  achieved,  with  results  of  88%  and  89% \nrespectively.5 This apparent success has been extremely uneven across the country, however, \nand has had little impact on access to reliable, continuous, and safe piped water supply to the \nurban  households  served  by  the  PWWs.  In  2009,  more  than  78%  of  the  residents  of  Phnom \nPenh  had  access  to  piped  water  supply,  but  the  national  average  was  only  42%.6   Access  in \nurban areas outside the capital ranged from about 12% in Siem Reap to about 64% in Pursat. In \n2013, the level of NRW was 6% in Phnom Penh, but ranged from 10% to 40% in the provincial \ntowns\u2014and the reliability of the figures reported from outside of the capital  is suspect and the \nlevel  of  water  supply  leaked,  wasted,  and  unpaid  for  in  these  areas  could  be  higher.  These \nPWWs  need  to  follow  the  example  set  by  PPWSA,  since  1993,  by  (i)  increasing  water  supply \ncoverage, (ii) improving water quality, and (iii) reducing the current high levels of NRW.  \n \nThe Department of Potable Water Supply (DPWS) under the MIH7 is responsible for the \n5. \ncoordination, policy, and regulation of urban water supply in Cambodia. Of the 12 public water \nutilities  in  the  country,  which  supply  water  to  urban  centers,  two  have  been  transformed  into \nautonomous  water  authorities\u2014PPWSA  in  1996,  and  the  Siem  Reap  Water  Supply  Authority \n(SRWSA)  in  2007.  This  improved  the  financial  and  operational  performance  of  both.  The  MIH \ncontrols  the  remaining  10  PWWs  through  its  provincial  line  agencies,  but  aims  to  transform \nthese  to  autonomous  water  authorities  by  2018.  The  DPWS  licenses  private  water  supply \noperators and regulates all public and private operators\u2019 tariffs, and it is receiving assistance for \nthese activities from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the World Bank. \n \n6. \nTaking into consideration the government\u2019s public debt management strategy to promote \nfinancial autonomy of PWWs and ensure sustainable economic growth, the Ministry of Economy \nand Finance sought ADB financing for the Urban Water Supply Project in February 2012. ADB\u2019s \ncountry  operations  business  plan  includes  an  Asian  Development  Fund  loan  for  the  project  for \n2014 approval. 8 \n \nADB\u2019s  past  support  in  provincial  urban  water  supply  included  the  Provincial  Towns \n7. \nImprovement  Project. 9  It  was  completed  in  2006  and  provided  water  treatment  plants  and \ndistribution  systems  in  six  towns.  In  2009,  ADB  completed  a  regional  TA,  the  Mekong  Water \nSupply  and  Sanitation  Project  in  Cambodia,  the  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic,  and  Viet \nNam.10 The TA prepared feasibility studies for water supply and sanitation in the towns of Kratie \nand  Stung  Treng,  but  no  ADB  financing  followed  due  to  differences  between  ADB  and  the \ngovernment  on  sector  and  tariff  reform.  To  meet  the  urgent  need  in  Kratie,  a  private  sector \ncompany invested in the water supply system. This was not the case at Stung Treng, where a \nsuitable  private  sector  provider  was  not  available.  Identified  as  an  urgent  subproject  in  2009, \nStung Treng\u2019s importance has been increasing, with a new national highway under construction \nconnecting it to Siem Reap and onwards to Thailand, in addition to its established links to the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \n \n\n                                                \n5  World  Health  Organization  and  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund.  2014.

Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fAfter  limited  involvement  since  2006,  ADB  is  seeking  to  reengage  in  and  provide  long-\n8. \nterm  support for the  country\u2019s  urban water  supply  sector, starting  with  this  project.  In  line  with \nthe  government\u2019s  strategy,  the  aim  of  this  assistance  will  be  to  raise  the  performance  of  the \nPWWs  in  the  rest  of  the  country  to  the  standard  achieved  by  PPWSA  in  Phnom  Penh.  The \nproject will address the problems identified by the MIH in its priorities and strategies for 2013\u2013\n2018. These are (i) inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks; (ii) the continued dependence \nof  the  country\u2019s  PWWs,  except  for  PPWSA  and  SRWSA,  on  financial  support  from  the \ngovernment; (iii) old production and distribution systems and inadequate human resources; (iv) \na  lack  of  financial  resources  for  rehabilitating  and  developing  the  sector;  and  (v)  the  overall \ninadequate water supply coverage in the country\u2019s urban areas. \n \n9. \nThe  project  will  provide  additional  new  and  rehabilitated  water  supply  infrastructure  and \nextend system coverage to expand access to safe water in nine towns.11 The MIH selected eight \nPWWs and SRWSA for support under the project. The project aims to (i) address the most urgent \nneeds of the urban water sector by improving and expanding services; and (ii) prepare for sector \nreform with the goals of providing improved 24-hour service coverage and better water quality, as \nwell  as  making  the  PWWs  more  autonomous  and  therefore  more  financially  sustainable.  The \nproject will also provide piped water supply to an additional 58,000 residents through (i) a new \nwater supply system in Stung Treng, (ii) a new distribution zone in Siem Reap, and (iii) system \nexpansion in Kampong Cham and Svay Rieng. In addition, the  project will rehabilitate existing \nwater  treatment  plants  in  seven  towns.  The  project  interventions  will  replicate  initiatives  that \nmade  PPWSA  successful  and  build  on  PPWSA  experience.12 It  will  also  incorporate  lessons \nfrom previous ADB projects.13 The project will help the PWW\u2019s reduce real NRW levels to below \n15% by using improved material and construction practices in its works to complement ongoing \nNRW reduction initiatives by the service providers and other development partners.14 \n \n10. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  (i)  phase  3  of  the  government\u2019s  rectangular  strategy  for \ngrowth,  employment,  equity,  and  efficiency;15 (ii)  Cambodia\u2019s  national  strategic  development \nplan for 2014\u20132018;16 and (iii) the action plan of the MIH to facilitate private sector partnerships, \nstrengthen the management of publicly owned waterworks, and integrate urban water supply with \nurban  environmental  management.  The  project  supports  ADB\u2019s  water  and  sanitation  sector \nassessment,  strategy,  and  road  map  for  Cambodia;  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  Water  Operational  Plan, \n2011\u2013202017 to  improve  the  efficiency  of  water  services.  It  also  aligns  with  the  three  pillars  of \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Cambodia 18  which call for (i) strengthening rural, urban, \nand  regional  linkages  through  investments  in  water  supply  infrastructure  and  services;  (ii) \n\n                                                \n11 The  towns  where  these  plants  will  be  rehabilitated  and  their  populations  in  2012  are  Kampong  Cham  (64,000), \nKampong Thom (46,000), Kampot (48,000), Pursat (51,000), Siem Reap (141,000), Sihanoukville (71,000), Stoung \n(51,000), Stung Treng (34,000), and Svay Rieng (45,000). \n\n12 The factors that have contributed to PPWSA\u2019s success included (i) strong and continuous leadership, (ii) financial \nautonomy, (iii) continuous staff development and performance-based bonuses, (iv) customer-orientated service, (v) \nhigh-quality infrastructure and equipment, and (vi) a strong focus on NRW reduction and energy efficiency. \n\n13 Among lessons learned are the need to (i) promote high quality design for water treatment plants to allow flexible \noperation, (ii) procure good-quality equipment, and (iii) select equipment that can be easily repaired or replaced. \n\n14 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Royal  Government  of  Cambodia.  2013.

It is focusing on \nwater utility management and finance. JICA is also assisting the MIH at the national policy level \nin developing a water law. The World Bank is providing support on the licensing of private water \noperators and related regulation of these. Under new leadership in 2014, the MIH completed a \ncomprehensive  assessment  of  each  of  its  public  water  utilities  and  is  using  the  findings  to \ndevelop short- and medium-term action plans. In particular, the MIH will encourage the PWWs \nto provide  efficient  services and  affordable  tariffs  with full  cost recovery  and savings for future \ninvestment to gradually reduce their reliance on external support.  \n \n12. \nThe  project  does  not  include  urban  sanitation  improvements  because  responsibility  for \nurban  sanitation  and  drainage  systems  lies  with  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport \n(MPWT), not the MIH, and the Ministry of Economy and Finance requested that the project have a \nsingle executing agency. In addition, ADB\u2019s experience from previous project loans19 that required \nworking with both the MPWT and MIH was not entirely successful. However, urban sanitation will \nbe  addressed  as  a  subcomponent  of  ADB\u2019s  proposed  urban  development  projects  with  the \nMPWT. ADB is encouraging the idea of a single agency for urban water supply and sanitation in \nCambodia,  and  will  continue  with  policy  dialogue  during  project  implementation.  The  proposed \nstand-alone  capacity  development  TA  will  include  an  investigation  of  effective  ways  to  combine \nurban water supply and urban sanitation in preparation for possible inclusion by ADB in a sector \nloan planned for 2017. \n \nB. \n \nThe  project\u2019s  impact  will  be  expanded  access  to  sustainable  and  safe  water  supply \n13. \nservices  for  the  urban  population  in  Cambodia.  This  will  contribute  to  the  government\u2019s  2025 \ntarget of 100% coverage. The outcome will be improved water supply infrastructure and service \nprovision in nine towns. By 2019, the project will provide a total of about 438 kilometers (km) of \npipelines  and  about  9,600  new  household  connections  in  the  towns  of  Siem  Reap  and  Stung \nTreng.  \n \nC. \n \n14. \nOutput 1: Existing water supply systems improved in seven towns. The project will \nimprove operational performance of water supply systems in seven towns and ensure that the \nfacilities  operate  at  optimal  level  before  coverage  is  expanded  under  a  proposed  subsequent \nsector  loan.  The  improvements  will  comprise  (i)  new  deep  wells  at  Kampong  Cham;  (ii) \nrehabilitated water treatment plants in seven towns; (iii) rehabilitated or new clear water storage \ntanks in three towns; (iv) rehabilitated pumping equipment in four towns; (v) augmented and/or \nreplaced  water  mains  in  four  towns;  and  (vi)  subsidized  household  connections  along  new \npipeline  routes,20 including  provision  for  2,000  new  connections  for  Kampong  Cham  and  Svay \nRieng.

A JICA-financed project, sourcing \nwater from the Tonle Sap lake, is planned for 2019 and will provide an additional 60,000 m3/day \nto Siem Reap to support the town\u2019s longer term needs. \n \n17. \nOutput  4:  Project  implementation  supported  and  operation  and  maintenance \ndeveloped.  The  project  will  include  project  implementation  support  services  for  the  project \nmanagement  and  implementation  units  in  detailed  engineering  design  and  construction \nsupervision. It will also support other project functions, including safeguards implementation and \nmonitoring, gender and community development, accounting and financial management,  bidding \nand procurement, and disbursement. The project will enhance the skills of and provide on-the-job \ntraining for  the  MIH  and  PWWs  staff  in  project  management  and  design  and  implementation  of \nurban water supply projects and O&M. \n \n18. \nProposed  technical  assistance. ADB  is  planning a  stand-alone  capacity  development \nTA  (para.  2).  The  TA  would  seek  to  build  institutional  capacity  at  the  MIH,  strengthen  sector \nregulation,  and  improve  tariff  reform.  The  scope  of  the  TA  will  be  developed  based  on  the \nproject  needs,  MIH\u2019s  ongoing  sector  reforms,  and  coordination  with  JICA\u2019s  ongoing  capacity \ndevelopment program for the PWWs.  \n \n19. \nSpecial  features  of  the  project. The project design includes (i) its planned support for \nthe MIH\u2019s recent initiative to accelerate sector reform and improve the financial and operational \nperformance  of the  PWWs,  which aims to  increase financial  autonomy for  all  PWWs by  2018; \n(ii) its use of the experience of PPWSA to enhance management and operational efficiency at \nother  waterworks  and  to  improve  service  delivery  and  NRW  management;  (iii)  its  plan  to \noptimize  the  performance  of  existing  facilities  through  targeted  small  investments,  thereby \npaving the way for further investment to increase coverage and quality of services; and (iv) its \nintent to implement a subsidized  water connection policy similar to that used by PPWSA  at all \nPWWs under the project to help poorer households to connect. \n \nD. \n \n20. \nThe project is estimated to cost $37.40 million (Table 1). Major cost items are civil works \n(61.7%),  consulting  services  and  capacity  development  (12.5%),  vehicles  and  equipment \n(2.0%).

An ADB mission visited all subproject sites and discussed all \nproposed  improvements  with  all  eight  PWWs  and  SRWSA.  The  project  has  been  designed  to \naddress  the  operational issues  at  each  water treatment  plant  and  will  ensure that  each facility \noperates at optimum levels when completed. New pipelines will expand coverage in four towns \nand  improve  system  pressures  and  performance  in  the  other  five.  In  response  to  the  MIH\u2019s \nincreased focus on 24-hour supply and water quality, NRW management will be given a higher \npriority, and new water laboratories will be provided at  six of the PWWs. Pipeline replacement \nand an improved quality of materials and construction will reduce NRW. \n \nB. \n \n Economic  and  financial  analyses  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n24. \nguidelines  for  the  project.22 The  following  were  considered  in  the  computation  of  economic \n                                                \n22 Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR):  (i)  value  of  incremental  water,  (ii)  resource  cost  savings  on \nnon-incremental,  (iii)  value  of  water  saved  from  improvement  in  non-technical  losses,  (iv) \nvalue  of  health  benefits,  and  (v)  other  economic  benefits  identified  but  not  quantified  and \nvalued.  The  estimated  base  case  EIRR  ranged  from  12.0%  for  Stung  Treng  to  36.4%  for \nKampot,  higher  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%.  Sensitivity  analyses \nshowed  that  subprojects  were  most  sensitive  to  a  simultaneous  increase  in  costs  and  a \ndecrease  in  benefits.  EIRRs  remain  above  12%  in  all  sensitivity  scenarios  except  for  Siem \nReap and Stung Treng, where EIRRS are marginal  at 10.5% and 9.5%, respectively, for this \nworst case scenario. Overall, EIRR for the project is 13.9%.  \n \n25. \n SRWSA is a state-owned enterprise, and the government will onlend the project funds \nto  SRWSA  at  terms  of  at  least  the  Asian  Development  Fund  interest  rate.  The  financial \nevaluation undertaken for SRWSA concluded that the base case financial internal rate of return \nis 26.3%, higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 0.75%, showing the project to be \nfinancially  viable.  Sensitivity  analysis  showed  that  the  subproject  was  most  sensitive  to  a \nsimultaneous increase in the cost of capital (20%) and O&M (10%), plus a decrease in revenue \n(10%). However, the financial internal rates of return remained above the weighted average cost \nof capital under all scenarios. The eight PWWs operate with varying levels of efficiency and cost \nrecovery.  The  government  will  grant  the  project  funds  on  to  the  PWWs  and  require  them  to \ncommit  to  operational  and  tariff  reforms  that  will  ensure  their  sustainability  and  cover  O&M \nexpenses  and  depreciation  by  2018.  Current  and  proposed  tariffs  are  considered  affordable, \nbased on tariff affordability analyses. \n \nC. \n \n26. \nAn assessment of the financial management and procurement capacity of the executing \nand  implementing  agencies  found  the  project  implementation  and  financial  management \narrangements of the DPWS to be adequate, but noted that the MIH is a new ministry created in \n2014  and  has  no  track  record  on  procurement  or  in  anticorruption  performance.  The  DPWS \nPMU  has  experience  in  managing  externally  funded  projects  and  the  capacity  to  undertake \ninternational and national competitive bidding for civil works packages. The MIH has adequate \nqualified and experienced finance and accounting permanent staff who can be nominated to the \nPMU.  However,  the  staff  has  not  been  trained  on  ADB\u2019s  project  implementation  procedures. \nThe nine implementing agencies have the finance and accounting staff to fill PIU positions, but \nthey  need  training  on  ADB  reporting  procedures.  Output  4  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the \nPMU  and  PIU  staff  through  on-the-job  support  in  project  and  financial  management.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment and the MIH. The PAM contains specific policy requirements (footnote 21).  \n \nD. \n \n27. \nA  socioeconomic  survey  was  conducted  during  project  preparation  in  four  pilot \nsubproject  areas  to  determine  the  socioeconomic  and  gender  characteristics  of  the \npopulations  targeted  to  benefit  from  the  project  in  the  nine  towns.  The  baseline  data  and \nassessment  results  supported  the  preparation  of  the  poverty,  social,  and  gender  analysis \nreport  on  the  nine  subproject  areas,  which  identified  the  poverty,  social  and  gender  issues, \nrisks,  needs,  priorities,  and  opportunities  related  to  the  beneficiaries.  Based  on  this \nassessment,  a  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy,  a  gender  action  plan,  and  a \nstakeholders  communications  strategy  were  prepared.  They  include  measures  to  enhance \nproject benefits and mitigate potential risks to or negative impacts on beneficiaries. \n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fBased  on \n\nthe  project \n\nSafeguards \n\nthe  gender  analysis  and  proposed  actions, \n\nThe  project  will  improve  public  health  and  promote  investment  and  employment \n28. \nopportunities that will benefit the overall population of 551,000 in the nine towns, which includes \n275,000 women and girls. The beneficiaries will include poor and vulnerable households living \nbelow  the  poverty  line,  which  represent  up  to  30%  of  the  individual  town  populations.  The \nproject  will  benefit  households  by  providing  access  to  a  reliable  and  safe  water  supply.  It  is \ndesigned to improve social inclusion. Domestic water supply connections will be made available \nto 11,600 households through subsidies of up to 100%. Potential customers will be trained on \nhow to apply for these connection subsidies.  \n \n29. \nis  gender \nmainstreaming  category  II\u2014effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  gender  action  plan  aims  to \nprovide  project  benefits  for  women,  including  (i)  10%  of  the  employment  in  civil  works \nconstruction  and  in  O&M,  with  the  same  pay  and  job  conditions  as  those  of  men;  (ii) \nparticipation  by  women  in  construction  skills  training  and  upgrading  to  enhance  their \nemployment  opportunities;  (iii)  a  minimum  30%  of  the  places  in  the  PMU  staff  training  to  be \nprovided in planning, design, financial management, procurement, and O&M of project facilities; \n(iv)  the  development  of  greater  gender-sensitivity  and  gender  equity  policies  in  the  executing \nagency,  PMU,  and  PIUs,  including  gender  awareness  training  in  which  at  least  70%  of  the \nparticipants  will  be  males;  (v)  a  guarantee  that  at  least  25%  of  the  staff  and  10%  of  the \nmanagement positions in the executing agency, PMU, and PIUs will be women receiving equal \npay  as  men  in  the  same  positions  by  2019;  and  (vi)  nongovernment  organizations  and  civil \nsociety organizations to be partners for information, education, and communication. \n \nE. \n \n30. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement.  It  involves  no  land \nacquisition or resettlement impacts. It is category C for indigenous people. Both classifications \nare  based  on  the  requirements  outlined  in  ADB\u2019s  operations  manual23 and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (SPS), 2009. Due diligence conducted for each subproject found that none of \nthe  subproject  components  will  involve  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement  impacts. \nMost  of  the  infrastructure  components  for  the  subprojects  are  within  existing  waterworks \ncompounds  and  will  not  require  land  acquisition.  All  trench  and  pipe  installation  works  are \nlocated  in  existing  rights-of-way  and  are  free  from  encroachment.  Temporary  impacts  during \nconstruction from pipeline construction, including other unanticipated impacts, will be addressed \nduring  implementation  based  on  actual  impacts  and  in  accordance  with the  national  laws  and \nADB\u2019s SPS. Any component that involves land acquisition and resettlement and triggers ADB's \nSPS will be excluded from the subproject during implementation. \n \n31. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  The  subprojects  are  not \nexpected  to  cause  any  irreversible  adverse  environmental  impacts.  Initial  environmental \nexaminations  (IEEs)  have  been  prepared  for  six  subprojects.  Environmental  due  diligence \nreports  (DDRs)  were  prepared  for  the  remaining  three,  because  impacts  will  be  within  the \nboundaries of the existing facilities. Potential impacts of climate change and/or natural hazards \non \nIEEs  and  environmental  DDRs,  with \nrecommendations  for  consideration  during  detailed  engineering  design  (DED).  Mitigation \nmeasures for  identified  impacts  are  included  in the  environmental management  plans (EMPs). \nAt  the  DED  stage,  when  the  IEEs  and  EMPs  will  be  updated  and  finalized,  the  proposed \nmitigating measures will  be reviewed and updated.  EMP implementation will be ensured by a \ndesignated environment officer in the PMU.  \n\nthe  project  have  been \n\nintegrated \n\ninto \n\nthe \n\n                                                \n23 ADB. 2013.

Effective  monitoring  at  all  stages  of  subproject  implementation  will  be  ensured.  A \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  will  help  to  facilitate  resolution  of  complaints  regarding  project \nperformance. The resettlement DDRs will be updated after DED to identify any impacts. All the \nDDRs,  IEEs,  and  EMPs  will  be  updated  and  disclosed  after  DED  and  cleared  by  the \ngovernment and ADB prior to contract awards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s information disclosure \nand consultation requirements, the safeguard documents will be posted on ADB\u2019s website. \n \nF. \n \n33. \nKey  risks  are  (i)  lack  of  human  resources  for  project  management  and  implementation, \nand (ii) limited absorptive capacity of the PIUs. The project will provide specific support and on-\nthe-job  training  to  mitigate  these  risks  and  the  MIH  will  ensure  that  additional  qualified  staff  are \nrecruited. Although MIH is a new ministry, new leadership at the MIH is focusing on sector reform \nand transparency. In addition, the project will provide MIH with training in ADB\u2019s procedures and \nguidelines for procurement, project administration, financial reporting, and its anticorruption policy. \nAdditional  support  and  oversight  will  be  provided  by  the  Cambodia  resident  mission,  as  well  as \nthrough  the  proposed  stand-alone  TA.  The  overall  risk  assessment  is  medium,  and  the \nintegrated  benefits  and impacts  are  expected to outweigh the  costs.  Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe government and the MIH have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \n34. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in \nthe project administration manual and loan covenants.
