a proposed loan of \nup to $13,000,000 to \u201cNur Navoi Solar\u201d Foreign Enterprise Limited Liability Company (NNS) for \nthe  Navoi  Solar  Power  Project  in  Uzbekistan.  The  report  also  describes  the  proposed \nadministration of a loan of up to $8,000,000 to be provided by the Canadian Climate Fund for the \nPrivate Sector in Asia II (CFPS II) under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility for the \nNavoi  Solar  Power  Project,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I  acting  under  the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the CFPS II loan. \n \n2. \nThe loan will provide long-term financing, not readily available in Uzbekistan, for a 100-\nmegawatt  (MW)  grid-connected  solar  photovoltaic  power  project.  The financing,  being  the  first \nnonsovereign support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for a renewable power project in \nUzbekistan, represents a meaningful engagement by ADB to mitigate climate change in line with \nStrategy  2030.1 In  addition,  the  ADB  assistance  is  expected  to  have  a  notable  demonstration \neffect  by  crowding  in  financing  from  the  CFPS  II.  As  the  first  major  private  sector  renewables \ninvestment  in  Uzbekistan\u2019s  history  with  long-term  international  financing  from  development \ninstitutions, the project is expected to be a landmark transaction with significant demonstration \neffect for private sector participation in Uzbekistan\u2019s energy sector. In particular, the project will \nestablish  bankable  precedents  intended  to  catalyze  further  private  sector  participation  in \nUzbekistan\u2019s  renewable  energy  sector.  Further,  the  project  has  incorporated  several  design \nfeatures  and  targets  to  improve  basic  rural  infrastructure  for  women  in  communities  near  the \nproject site. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \nProject identification. Uzbekistan is one of the fastest growing economies in Central Asia \n3. \nand grew rapidly over the last decade at an average annual rate of 8%, lifting a significant portion \nof its population out of poverty. 2 The energy sector underpins Uzbekistan\u2019s sustained growth and \nprivate sector development. Uzbekistan\u2019s household electrification rate is almost 100%, but an \naging  and  overloaded  electricity  system  causes  a  sustained  power  demand\u2013supply  gap, \nespecially  in  rural  areas.  In  some  villages,  power  outages  occur  during  the  cold  season \n(December\u2013February), lasting from 6 hours a day to a few weeks. \n \nThe  country\u2019s  installed  power  generation  capacity  is  about  14.0  gigawatts  (GW),  but  the \n4. \navailable capacity is estimated at less than 12.5 GW. There are blackouts in rural areas and cities \nduring the cold season (December\u2013February) when electricity demand is highest. Hardest hit are \nsocially vulnerable communities in the southern and western regions of Uzbekistan. Schools and \nhospitals are unable to operate fully in the cold season because of lack of affordable and reliable \nelectricity, putting educational and health care systems at risk.  \n \n5. \nMost power generation assets are 40\u201350 years old and run on old steam turbine technology \nplants with a weighted average efficiency of 33%, well below the efficiency of modern combined \ncycle gas turbines at 53%\u201356%. \n\n1  ADB.  2018.

Rating  Action:  Moody\u2019s  assigns  issuer  rating  of  B1  to  the  Government  of \n\n \n\nManila. \n\nUzbekistan, outlook stable. 13 February.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n \n\nDespite having significant solar resources, Uzbekistan is highly dependent on inefficient \n6. \nand  old  natural  gas  generation  assets  for  electricity.  To  address  the  issue,  the  Government  of \nUzbekistan plans to rapidly develop its renewable energy sector to facilitate diversification of the \ncountry\u2019s energy mix and attract private investment in the sector. The government targets at least \n25% renewable energy (solar and wind) in terms of capacity by 2030 with plans to install at least \n5 GW of solar capacity. 3 \n \n7. \nIn February 2019, the government, assisted by the World Bank\u2019s Scaling Solar program \nand International Finance Corporation Advisory Services, launched a competitive tender process \nfor the project which will be Uzbekistan\u2019s first utility-scale renewable energy project. The project \nis  Uzbekistan\u2019s  first  private  sector  renewable  energy  investment  and  sets  a  precedent  in \nestablishing  the  bankability  of the  sector,  incorporating  international  best practices  and  project \ndocumentation for future renewable energy financings. \n \n8. \nProject  design.  The  project  constitutes  the  development,  construction,  operation,  and \ntransfer of a 100 MW grid-connected solar photovoltaic power project on a build\u2013operate\u2013transfer \nbasis about 35 kilometers west of Navoi City, in central Uzbekistan.4 The project site was selected \nby the government, and usage rights will be granted to NNS by way of a long-term land lease \nagreement. NNS will sell all its energy output to Joint Stock Company (JSC) National Electric Grid \nof Uzbekistan (NEGU) (the state-owned offtaker) [Confidential information deleted].  \n \n9. \n \n10. \nBorrower.  NNS  is  a  special  purpose  vehicle  wholly  owned  by  Masdar.  [Confidential \ninformation  deleted].  NNS  will  build,  own,  and  operate  the  100  MW  grid-connected  solar \nphotovoltaic power project. \n \n11. \nSponsor.  Masdar  was  established  in  2006  as  a  renewable  energy  company  with  the \nmission  of  supporting  the  United  Arab  Emirates\u2019  leadership  in  the  global  energy  sector,  while \nsustaining the diversification of the country\u2019s economy and energy sources.5 Masdar is a global \nleader in the renewable energy sector and has developed utility-scale, grid-tied projects; small-\nscale  applications  providing  energy  access  to  communities  away  from  the  electricity  grid;  and \ncarbon abatement projects. Since its inception, Masdar has successfully developed an aggregate \n2.7  GW  of  renewable  energy  across  30  countries  with  a  combined  investment  of  $8.5  billion; \nMasdar\u2019s  share  in  these  investments6 amounts  to  $2.7  billion.7 Masdar  is  indirectly  and  wholly \nowned  by  the  Government  of  Abu  Dhabi  through  shareholdings  in  Mubadala  Investment \nCompany Public JSC and Mamoura Diversified Global Holding Public JSC. \n \n12. \n \n13. \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\n3  Government of Uzbekistan. 2020.

The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) share of renewable energy \nsources in the country\u2019s energy mix increased, and (ii) access to electricity improved through the \nconstruction of new electricity-generating capacities.8 \n \n15. \nOutcome. The project will have the following outcome: renewable power delivered to the \ndomestic grid increased.9 The project will generate about 258.2 gigawatt-hours of clean energy \nper annum and will contribute to avoiding 157,502 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually.10 \nThe  project  will  also  boost  local  employment  and  contribute  to  the  local  economy  through \ndomestic purchases. \n \nOutputs. The project will have the following outputs: (i) installation of solar power plant, \n16. \n(ii)  generation  of  local  employment,  (iii)  growth  of  local  economy,  and  (iv) enhanced  gender \nequality in NNS operations. \n \nC. \n \n17. \nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and three of its key operational priorities: (i) addressing remaining poverty \nand reducing inequalities; (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality; and (iii) tackling climate \nchange,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability \n(footnote 1). As the first utility-scale renewable energy project in Uzbekistan, the project will help \nintroduce  solar  power  generation  to  address  climate  change  and  accelerate  low  greenhouse \ngas (GHG) development. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Uzbekistan, 2019\u20132023 stresses \nthe need for ADB to provide private sector financing for a wide spectrum of renewable energy \ninfrastructure. 11  The  project  is  also  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  strategic  emphasis  on \nmaximizing  the  use  of  indigenous  energy  resources,  diversifying  the  fuel  mix  away  from  fossil \nfuels, and reducing GHG emissions. As part of Uzbekistan\u2019s Nationally Determined Contributions, \nthere is a target to reduce annual GHG emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 10% by \n2030 (relative to 2010). GHG reductions are expected to be achieved through various measures, \nincluding the deployment of renewable solar power generation. \n \n18. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent  with  the  ADB  Energy  Policy,  which  emphasizes  promoting  renewable  energy, \nmaximizing  access  to  energy for  all,  and  private  sector  participation to  enhance  energy sector \nefficiency.12 The  project,  with  its  competitive  tariff  for  solar  power  generation,  will  improve  the \ncountry\u2019s energy security, affordability, and sustainability. The project also helps ADB collaborate \nwith the private sector, international development agencies, and multilateral institutions. The ADB \nloan will be categorized as climate financing and help to achieve ADB\u2019s annual climate finance \ntarget of $6 billion by 2020. The project is also strongly aligned with ADB\u2019s proposed sovereign \nsupport  for the country\u2019s ongoing Power Sector Reform Program13 which has specifically laid out \n\n \n\n8  Government  of  Uzbekistan,  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs.  2017.

Past  ADB  support  for  independent  power \n19. \ngeneration projects point to the need to have robust bankable contracts that have been tested in \nmultiple jurisdictions through several macroeconomic and business cycles. This project\u2014by virtue \nof the International Finance Corporation\u2019s advisory role\u2014benefits from a contractual framework \nthat has been developed and tested by multilateral institutions over the medium to long term in \nseveral emerging markets. The long-term sustainability and success of private power generation \nprojects also depend on their tariffs being affordable, offering good value for money, and ranking \nhigh on the economic merit order for dispatch. The highly competitive and entirely transparent \nbidding process for the project has led to a highly affordable and sustainable tariff, which assures \ndispatch of the project. \n\n \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nConfidential information deleted.   \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\n \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nADB's  assistance  will  comprise  (i)  a  senior  loan  of  up  to  $13,000,000;  and  (ii)  the \n\n \nA. \n \n24. \nadministration of a loan of up to $8,000,000 from the CFPS II. \n \nB. \n \n25. \nThe project is the first utility-scale renewable energy project in Uzbekistan. ADB will add \nvalue to the project by providing and helping catalyze third party long-term debt financing, which \nis otherwise unavailable in the market. ADB\u2019s participation will also facilitate the crowding-in of a \nrobust  level  of  equity  capital  from  a  very  credible  sponsor  in  the  project.  Deployment  of \nconcessional loans by ADB from CFPS II will improve the commercial viability and bankability of \nthe  project.  Moreover,  ADB\u2019s  participation  will  add  significant  value  to  the  renewable  energy \nsector  in  Uzbekistan  by  setting  a  precedent  and  acting  as  a  strong  signal  in  support  of  its \ncommercial viability. ADB will also benefit the project through its adherence to ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009)  which  will  ensure  the  adoption  of  international  best  practices  in \nsafeguards management. Finally, ADB has introduced several meaningful gender elements in the \nproject design which will help promote women\u2019s economic empowerment. \n\n14 For the Navoi Solar Project, the World Bank will be providing sovereign-backed partial credit guarantees to support \n\nletters of credit being issued by the offtaker.  \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\nD. \n \n20. \n \n21. \n\nE. \n \n22. \n \nF. \n \n23. \n \n\n \n\n\f5 \n \n\nRisks \n\nThe deployment of a concessional loan from CFPS II was necessary to ensure a financially \n26. \nviable  result  from  the  competitive  bidding  process  and  improve  the  bankability  of  the \nproject.  Concessional terms were provided to bidders on an indicative basis prior to the tender, \nwith the expectation that the value of the concessional support would pass through and result in \na  lower  tariff,  improving  the  tender  result  for  the  offtaker,  and  increasing  the  likelihood  of  a \nsuccessful outcome and subsequent follow-on renewable energy development. This will be the \nfirst project for which ADB will make use of CFPS II to provide blended finance support directly to \na renewable energy project in Uzbekistan. The project is aligned with the DFI Enhanced Principles \nfor Blended Concessional Finance for Private Sector Operations.15 \n \nC. \n \n27. \n \n28. \n \n29. \n \n30. \n \n31. \n \n32. \n \n\nConfidential information deleted.   \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n33. \nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  as  follows:  environment  (category  B),  involuntary  resettlement  (category  B),  and \nindigenous peoples (category C).16 \n \n34. \nADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts  of the  project  and  the measures to  avoid, minimize,  mitigate,  and compensate  for  the \nadverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans. The environmental and social measures and \nthe  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  NNS  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n\n \n\n35. \nNNS has engaged an independent consultant to prepare the  preliminary environmental \nand  social  impact  assessment  to  meet  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements.  The \npotential environmental and social impacts of the project were identified, and effective measures \nto  avoid  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  are  incorporated  in  the \nenvironmental and social management plan. The final impact assessment and management plan, \nincluding  updates  on  the  ecological  survey  investigation,  stakeholder  engagement  plan  and \ngrievance redress mechanism, will be completed prior to construction commencement and as a \ncondition of disbursement. The anticipated environmental impacts, such as noise, vibration, dust, \nwaste generation, and surface water contamination, are generally associated with construction \n\n \n\n15  The  DFI  Enhanced  Principles  for  Blended  Concessional  Finance  for  Private  Sector  Projects seek  to  ensure that \nprojects utilizing blended finance solutions apply the following principles:  (i) additionality and rationale for blended \nconcessional finance; (ii) crowding in and minimum concessionality; (iii) reinforcing private markets; (iv) commercial \nsustainability; and (v) promoting high standards. \n\n16 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n\n \n\n\factivities. Potential impacts during operation are wastewater, solid waste generation, and glaring \neffects from the solar panels. These impacts can be effectively managed by implementing good \nengineering,  construction,  and  housekeeping  practices  as  well  as  preventive  and  control \nmeasures laid out in the site-specific environmental management plans. The solar plant and/or \nits surrounding areas are not in or near environmentally sensitive areas. The nearest residential \ncommunity is about 2.6 kilometers from the solar plant. Therefore, residents will not experience \nany health or safety disturbance or inconvenience during construction and operation. The project \nsite is situated on 267 hectares of land that was formerly used by two leaseholders for grazing \nand  which  cannot  sustain  arable  crops  due  to  poor  soil  quality.  The  environmental  and  social \nimpact  assessment  has  identified  unresolved  compensation  arrangements  between  local \ngovernment authorities and one of the former leaseholders and a subtenant. The environmental \nand social action plan agreed with lenders during appraisal requires NNS to resolve this and any \nunanticipated  economic  displacement  impacts  caused  by  its  temporary  and  permanent  use  of \nland prior to construction commencement.17 The photovoltaic panels that will be used will have \nlimited  levels  of  either  glint  or  glare  and  will  be  equipped  with  antireflective  coating  that  will \nsignificantly  reduce  the  glare  effects  upon  local  communities  and  aircraft.  NNS  will  develop \nstorage,  handling,  and  disposal  procedures  for  broken  or  damaged  panels.  The  annual \nenvironmental  and  social  monitoring  report  that  will  include  information  on  the  project\u2019s \nenvironmental  and  social  performance  and  compliance  is  required  to  be  submitted  to  ADB  for \nreview  and  public  disclosure  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  Occupational  health  and  safety  risks  will  be \nmitigated through the development of a health and safety plan that will include routine training, \nmonitoring,  and  provision  of  personal  protective  equipment.  Environmental  and  occupational \nhealth and safety provisions, consistent with  ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements, \nwill be incorporated into the contractor agreements. \n \n36. \nSome gender elements. Similar to the global challenge of labor participation of women \nin renewable energy,18 the energy sector in Uzbekistan has low women\u2019s representation, mostly \nbecause of the lack of necessary education, lack of awareness of employment options, limited \nopportunities for skills development, and prevailing stereotypes that regard the energy sector as \na  high-risk  profession  that  is  not  suitable  for  women. 19  With  the  predominance  of  male \nrepresentation  in  the  project  site\u2019s  workforce,  implying  higher  risks  of  gender-based  abuses \nespecially during the construction period, and with the limited number of jobs for women due to \nlocal  and  sector  context,  the  focus  of  the  project\u2019s  gender  mainstreaming  is  to  provide  a  safe \nworking environment for female employees and ensure safe interactions with the local population. \nNNS commits to implement measures to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in \nits  business  activities  following  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  (1998).  These \nmeasures are (i) jobs for women during both construction and operation, (ii) sex-segregated staff \nfacilities, (iii) an anti-sexual harassment policy, (iv) annual training for staff and contractors during \nconstruction  and  operation  on  gender  sensitivity  and  a  respectful  work  environment,  and \n(v) women\u2019s  participation  in  local  skills  development  in  renewable  energy.  NNS  will  submit \nperiodic reports on the implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \n37. \nNNS  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \nStrategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \n\n \n\n17 Due to the uncertainty caused by COVID-19, NNS cannot confirm if purpose-built worker\u2019s accommodations will be \nrequired in proximity to the plant site during the construction phase. Should accommodations be necessary, NNS \nhas agreed in the environmental and social action plan to ensure  that local authorities provide alternative grazing \nland to impacted herders prior to construction. NNS will provide replacement and relocation assistance to impacted \nherders.  \n\n18 International Renewable Energy Agency. 2019. Renewable Energy: A Gender Perspective. Abu Dhabi. \n19 ADB. 2018.
