THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed results-\nbased loan to India for the Accelerating State Education Program to Improve Results. \n \n2.  The program will assist the Government of India in enhancing the quality of education \nthrough its flagship program, Samagra Shiksha (Integrated Scheme for School Education). \nFocusing on five selected states, the results-based lending (RBL) will support improvement of \neducation outcomes, particularly foundational learning at the primary level and reduction of \ndropout rates at the secondary level. To achieve these outcomes, the program will help the states \n(i) transform a set of government schools into exemplar schools with essential learning resources, \n(ii)  scale  up  student-centered  interventions  to boost  learning,  and (iii)  strengthen the  core \nelements of state education for overall system improvements. The program also aims to mitigate \nthe  impact  from  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  on  students\u2019  learning  and \nmainstream digital learning and teaching capability across schools. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  India\u2019s economy grew rapidly at an average rate of 7% during 2012\u20132019 but contracted \nseverely during 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The economy was expected to recover \nstarting in 2021, but the recovery may take longer if the COVID-19 pandemic is prolonged with \nthe successive waves of the disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has also disrupted education for \nnearly 250 million students due to more than a year of school closures.1 As India aspires to \nbecome a knowledge-based economy, nurturing a well-educated and competent workforce is \ncrucial. More than half of India\u2019s 1.3 billion population is under age 25, and it will have the world\u2019s \nlargest  and  most  youthful  workforce  by  2026.  Recognizing  the  importance  of  investing  in \neducation for India\u2019s future, the new National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 aims to ensure high-\nquality education for all learners regardless of social and economic backgrounds.2 Overcoming \nCOVID-19 impacts on learning is also a priority in this endeavor. \n \n4.  Education sector. The Government of India has introduced a series of reforms to improve \naccess to schooling over the past 2 decades. Centrally sponsored schemes\u2014such as Sarva \nShiksha Abhiyan (SSA) for grades 1\u20138 since 2002 and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan \nfor  grades  9\u201312  since  2009\u2014have  played  key  roles  in  increasing  access  to  primary  and \nsecondary education with the provision of additional schools and teachers.3 Primary education \nenrollment for both males and females became nearly universal by 2016. Secondary education \nalso made significant progress: during 2006\u20132018, the gross enrollment ratio (GER) increased \nfrom 52% to 80% for secondary grades (9\u201310), and from 29% to 56% for senior secondary grades \n(11\u201312). Gender parity has been achieved across most states, with female enrollment exceeding \nthat of males at all levels of schooling.4 \n \n1  Government of India, Ministry of Education (MOE). 2021. Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE). \nNew Delhi. \n2  Government of India, MOE. 2020. National Education Policy 2020. New Delhi. \n3  Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan is translated as Education for All, and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan as the National \nProgram for Secondary Education. The Right of Children for Free and Compulsory Education Act of 2009 reinforced \nthese schemes, making education a fundamental right of every child aged 6\u201314. \n4  In 2006, there was a significant gender difference in GER in secondary education: 46% for girls versus 58% for boys \nat the secondary level and 25% for girls versus 31% for boys at the senior secondary level. By 2015, GER had \nreached gender parity and subsequently girls\u2019 GER began to exceed that of boys. \n \n ", "2 \n5.  However, this progress in schooling has yet to be translated into improved learning. \nNational achievement surveys (NASs), which have measured students\u2019 learning since 2001, show \nthat students are not acquiring the competencies expected at each grade level. The 2017 NAS \nresults show that one-third of grade 3 students could not read simple texts with comprehension. \nThe share of students who could not perform in grade-specific reading was higher for grade 5 \n(42%) and grade 8 (44%).5 Similarly, the results for grade 10 students indicate low proficiency in \nboth language and mathematics, illustrating that early learning deficits in foundational literacy and \nnumeracy become amplified as students advance to higher grades. Low foundational proficiency \nalso leads to high dropout rates and low completion rates as students move through secondary \neducation. At grades 9\u201310, the dropout rate was about 20% for India overall in school year \n2016/17, and nearly twice as high for government schools (27%) as for private schools (13%).6 \nDropout rates are similar for female and male students, with some variations across the states. \n \n6.  Coronavirus disease impacts. The national lockdown and prolonged school closure \nhave deepened learning deficits among many students, especially those from socially and \neconomically disadvantaged backgrounds and rural areas. While state governments made efforts \nto  deliver  education  through  online  or  other  remote  learning  modalities,  limited  internet \nconnectivity,  inadequate  access  to  digital  devices,  lack  of  digital  learning  materials,  and \ninsufficient  online  teaching  skills  all  posed  daunting  challenges.  Primary  students  suffered \nsignificant learning loss\u2014forgetting what had been learned and not learning new things\u2014during \nthe pandemic, exacerbating already weak foundational skills.7 The learning loss is likely to be \ngreater for students in government schools than in private schools, as government schools are \nless  equipped  with  digital  infrastructure  and  students  are  more  likely  to  be  from  lower \nsocioeconomic status.8  \n \n7.  Issues in the quality of government schools. Government schools across India face \nmany constraints in providing quality education and delivering effective learning outcomes. First, \nearlier efforts such as the SSA and the Right to Education Act, while ensuring school access for \nevery child within a comfortable distance, resulted in creating large numbers of small schools.9 \nThis has posed critical challenges in delivering quality education, such as difficulty in deploying \nteachers to rural areas, a shortage of subject teachers, and inefficiencies in school governance \nand management due to geographic dispersion of schools.10 Many schools were left ill-equipped \nwith basic physical facilities, learning infrastructure (e.g., science laboratories, computer facilities, \nand  libraries),  and  teaching  resources,  which  are  important  as  stimulating  learning \n \n5  Government of India, National Council of Educational Research and Training, Educational Survey Division.

The school year in India usually begins in April\u2013June and ends in March\u2013July in the following \nyear, which varies from state to state.   \n7  Findings from a recent survey show that about 45%\u201365% of primary students lost language abilities (e.g., reading, \nwriting, comprehension) and 25%\u201345% lost math abilities (e.g., identifying numbers, subtraction, basic math for \nproblem solving).

New Delhi. \n ", "3 \nenvironments.11 Poor learning environments in government schools have led many students to \nmove to private schools.12 Yet, girls are more likely than boys to attend government schools, and \nthose from socially disadvantaged groups (i.e., scheduled tribes or scheduled castes) are also \nmore likely to do so.13 Second, a shortage of well-trained and motivated teachers and inadequate \nneeds-based  opportunities  for  continuous  professional  development  (CPD)  hinder  effective \nteaching and learning in classrooms. There is a great need for teachers to strengthen subject \nknowledge and pedagogical skills, improve student-centered practices, and facilitate emerging \ninformation and communication technology (ICT) applications in teaching and assessments. Third, \nschool leadership and management capacity require continuous strengthening to track teaching \nquality, ensure the efficient use of resources, and build accountability mechanisms. Most states \nhave a management information system (MIS), but rigorous analysis of MIS data is not carried \nout to monitor school performance and overall system checks. The institutional support structures \nbelow the district level (i.e., block and cluster resource centers) also need continuous capacity \nbuilding to support schools and teachers and to foster community engagement. \n \n8.  For effective learning in schools, content needs to be relevant and stimulating for students \nwith real-life applications. Currently, subjects cover too much content while students have limited \nliteracy and numeracy skills, and teachers focus on the completion of the syllabus by relying on \nrote learning. Student-centered learning has become popular across the states, emphasizing \nlearning at student\u2019s own pace. But those are yet to be implemented at scale with proper designs \nand adequate teacher training to render significant outcomes. Learning deficiencies at lower \ngrades  eventually  lead  to  weak  employable  skills.  Limited  vocational  orientation  at  senior \nsecondary level also leaves many students unprepared for the world of work. Rapid technological \nadvances are increasing demand for higher-order cognitive skills, problem-solving capability, \ndigital literacy, and technology-oriented skills. For students to acquire higher-order knowledge \nand technical skills, learning contents and practices in basic education need to provide strong \nfoundational skills and abilities for progressive learning and re-learning.  \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n9.  To  address  ongoing  challenges  in  school  education  and  to  improve  the  quality  of \neducation, the Ministry of Education (MOE) launched a new flagship scheme in 2018, Samagra \nShiksha, by combining SSA, Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (footnote 3), and teacher \neducation. Samagra Shiksha aims to provide holistic, integrated support for the states\u2019 school \neducation from preschool to senior secondary schools with a unified implementation structure. \nCompared to the previous schemes, the new scheme shifts its focus to ensuring the quality of \neducation, particularly inclusive and equitable learning outcomes. The NEP 2020 further sets \nquality education priorities for the future, with an emphasis on strong foundational skills and \nlearnability to equip youth with 21st century skills requirements, such as critical thinking, problem-\nsolving, collaboration, and socio-emotional skills.  \n \n \n11 In school year 2016/17, only 53% of government schools reported having functioning drinking water and sanitation \nfacilities. At the secondary level, only 35% had an integrated science laboratory, about 18% had a functional \ncomputer, and only 22% had a functional internet connection (footnote 6). \n12 Enrollment in private schools for grades 1\u20138 increased steadily from 30% in school year 2009/10 to 41% in 2016/17 \n(footnote 6). Private schools tend to be larger and better equipped with teachers, especially subject teachers. The \ncost for private primary schools is regarded as relatively modest, as teachers\u2019 salaries are much lower in private \nschools than in government schools. Learning outcomes tend to be slightly better for private schools, but they are \nstill suboptimal. G. Kingdon. 2017. The Private Schooling Phenomenon in India: A Review.

Aligned with the NEP 2020 vision, the RBL program supports the MOE\u2019s Samagra Shiksha \nimplementation  in  five  selected  states:  Assam,  Gujarat,  Jharkhand,  Tamil  Nadu,  and \nUttarakhand.14 The program will support strategic components of Samagra Shiksha to accelerate \nquality outcomes in government schools, especially improved foundational learning at the primary \nlevel and reduced dropout rates at the secondary level, with special attention to girls and socially \ndisadvantaged groups. To achieve this objective, the program also aligns with the MOE\u2019s new \nexemplar school initiative15 and assists the states in (i) transforming a set of government schools \ninto  exemplar  schools  to  demonstrate  quality  learning  interventions;  (ii)  improving  learning \nenvironments in exemplar schools with essential facilities, teaching and human resources; (iii) \nexpanding student-centered foundational learning at the primary level; (iv) introducing science, \ntechnology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) and 21st century skills learning for \nsecondary students; (v) facilitating technology applications in teaching\u2013learning and augmenting \nlocalized digital learning content based on lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic; (vi) enhancing \nthe capacity of teachers, principals, and local officers; (vii) establishing state assessment cells for \nrobust tracking of learning outcomes; and (viii) strengthening an integrated MIS for rigorous \nmonitoring of school performance and the state school system. The five states vary in terms of \nongoing reforms or interventions. The program will help the states to scale up successful \ninterventions or adopt new interventions to serve the state\u2019s priority needs. In so doing, it will \nassist the states to align core elements of the education system toward coherent outcomes and \noverall system improvements. \n \n11.  Results-based lending. The RBL modality is suitable because (i) various interventions \nrequired to improve the quality of education need a clear focus on results (as opposed to inputs); \n(ii) it incentivizes a number of stakeholders to align their efforts toward a common set of results \nfor system strengthening; (iii) MOE\u2019s centrally sponsored schemes have been implemented \nacross the states since 2002 through the State Implementation Society (SIS), which has well-\nestablished implementation and fiduciary procedures that can be further strengthened with \nresults-based planning and monitoring capacity; (iv) there is strong commitment and ownership \nof the program at both MOE and state levels to establish results-oriented planning and use the \nopportunity for institutional capacity development; and (v) RBL leverages counterpart resources \nfrom  Samagra  Shiksha  to  expand  the  development  impacts  of  financing  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and ensure sustainability. \n \n12.  The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022, \npillar  1:  boosting  economic  competitiveness  to  create  more  and  better  jobs  by  improving \nemployability and productivity of the growing workforce;16 and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational \n41F\npriorities on (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, (ii) accelerating progress \nin  gender  equality,  (iii)  developing  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  (iv)  strengthening \n \n14 The MOE identified five states for the program according to the MOE\u2019s Performance Grading Index 2017/18 by \nconsidering a mix of states in different levels of the Performance Grading Index, population sizes, and geographic \ndispersion. The selection excluded Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, and \nRajasthan, which are covered by the World Bank\u2019s Strengthening Teaching Learning and Results for States program. \nGovernment of India, Department of School Education and Literacy. 2018.

All learning interventions \n(output 2) will be implemented in the exemplar schools to demonstrate innovative teaching and \nlearning solutions, such as interactive and activity-based learning or personalized adaptive \nlearning practices. \n \n16.  Output  2:  Quality  and  relevance  of  learning  improved.  The  output  will  support \ndesigning  new  (or  refining  existing)  learning  enhancement  programs  (LEPs),20 along  with \ncurricular materials and rigorous tracking of LEP results. It will also strengthen assessments\u2014\nboth  formative  and  summative\u2014and  the  use  of  adaptive  learning  tools  to  promote  the \nindividualized-learning approach. For elementary grades (1\u20138), student-centered LEPs will be \nexpanded to improve foundational literacy and numeracy (DLI 5). For secondary grades (9\u201312), \nLEPs will strengthen math and science proficiency through activity-based STEAM learning (DLI \n6), and introduce 21st century skills (e.g., critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and \ncreativity) and vocational education to make education more relevant and nurture employable \nskills.21 All LEPs aim to address the learning loss from COVID-19 impacts and incorporate \n \n18 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n19 The states will use the selection criteria for exemplar schools according to the MOE guidance on the new exemplar \nschool initiative, which will encompass the following: (i) high enrollment schools; (ii) schools with existing basic \ninfrastructure; (iii) girls-only schools, schools with significant tribal populations, and those in remote areas; (iv) \nintegrated schools with grades 1\u201312 (or grades 1\u201310) or the potential to become an integrated school and an anchor \nfor a cluster of small primary and secondary schools that can be absorbed and/or with which resources can be \nshared; and (v) schools located in an environmentally-safe zone away from climate and disaster risks. The number \nof exemplar schools will be around 200\u2013500 in each state for a total of 1,800 across the five states; these schools \nwill consist of some integrated primary and secondary schools, as well as separate primary or secondary schools.  \n20 LEPs refer to various interactive, student-centered learning practices that have been adopted across the states, \nespecially to boost foundational learning in elementary schools or to bridge the learning gap. The most common \napproach is activity-based learning that allows students to learn at their own pace, and often involves grouping \nstudents according to their learning level rather than by their grade. Various activity-based learning approaches have \nbeen tried in India since the 1990s, most notably in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu under the SSA. \n21 STEAM LEPs will incorporate learning materials on the impacts of climate and disaster risks to educate students on \nhow to mitigate and adapt to climate change. It will also build the capacity of teachers on the subject.    \n ", "7 \ncounseling and socio-emotional support for students. Given national priorities on foundational \nlearning and 21st century skills, LEPs for these two areas will not only be implemented in \nexemplar schools but also be scaled up to a larger set of village-level cluster schools in each \nstate.22 About 14,000 cluster schools will benefit from these essential learning interventions. The \ncuration and dissemination of digital learning contents will also be scaled up with local language \ntranslations for their mainstreamed use. All learning materials will incorporate gender- and socially \ninclusive contents, and aim to enhance climate and disaster literacy for students. \n \n17.  Output  3:  Capacity  of  teachers  and  school  leaders  enhanced.  This  output  will \nstrengthen the capacity of teachers and principals by setting up systematic CPD plans as stressed \nby the NEP 2020. Statewide CPD plans will be built on a blended learning modality (both offline \nand online) to enhance teachers\u2019 interactive and student-centered pedagogic skills, application of \ndigital contents and effective delivery of LEPs, and gender- and socially inclusive education (DLI \n7). The CPD promotes peer learning, including formation of mentor teachers. It will also support \nprincipals or headmasters in building their leadership and managerial capabilities to foster \ninstructional leadership and improve school performance (DLI 7). In addition, the output will \nstrengthen the institutional capacity of the state councils of educational research and training \n(SCERTs)  and  district  institutes  of  education  and  training  (DIETs),  through  organizational \nstrengthening and staff training, to support effective teaching\u2013learning with proper materials, \nassessments, and training content for teachers. The output will prioritize teachers and principals \nof both exemplar and cluster schools (hereafter program schools), while CPD plans and capacity \nbuilding for state institutes will bring statewide benefits for school education.  \n \n18.  Output  4:  Management  of  school  education  system  strengthened.  The  output \nsupports the program states to develop outcome-oriented planning and budgeting through the \npreparation of the state\u2019s 5-year perspective plan and a detailed results framework for the RBL \nprogram. It also strengthens the states\u2019 monitoring capacity by setting up an integrated MIS that \nenables real-time, accurate data collection on students, schools, teachers, and staff for effective \nschool management, all incorporating specific demographic information (e.g., gender and social \ncategory) (DLI 8). Some states have already incorporated students\u2019 learning and assessment \ndata (e.g., Tamil Nadu), some have an automated human resource management system (e.g., \nGujarat), and others are in the process of developing similar advanced modules. The states will \nenhance the reliability and use of the MIS to monitor learning processes, strengthen accountability, \nand promote evidence-based planning. The output will also provide training to strengthen the \ncapacity of district and block officers on classroom observations, monitoring of LEPs, mentoring \nof  teachers  and  school  management,  and  promotion  of  community  engagement.  Support \nactivities under the output will bring statewide benefits for overall system strengthening.  \n \n19.  Output 5: National guidelines on quality state education strengthened. This output \nwill support the MOE to establish national guidelines to ensure quality education at the state level \n(DLI 9). It will specifically support the development of national and state curricula frameworks for \nSTEAM and vocational education, and updated standards for learning assessments by the new \nnational assessment center, Performance Assessment, Review, and Analysis of Knowledge for \nHolistic Development, or PARAKH. This output will also help the MOE to promote cross-learning \nacross the states on good practices and innovative solutions based on quality interventions  \nimplemented under the RBL program. \n \n22 Each state is expected to select about 2,000\u20133,000 cluster schools under the RBL program for a total of about 14,000 \nschools in the five states to ensure the widespread benefit of essential learning interventions. Cluster schools will \nrepresent about one school per cluster of villages (gram panchayat, an administrative unit at the village level) that is \nspread across each state. Key learning interventions, once implemented in cluster schools, will also be replicated in \nother village-level schools.  \n \n ", "8 \n20.  Disbursement-linked indicators.23 The results indicators critical for achieving the RBL \nprogram outcome and outputs are chosen as DLIs. These DLIs represent core elements of quality \neducation to be pursued by all program states, while allowing flexibility for each state to be \ninnovative or scale up proven initiatives in the state. The allocation of ADB financing for each DLI \nis based on the significance of its achievement for the program outcome, combined with the scope \nof activities required for DLI achievement (Table 2). DLI 5 (on foundational learning) is allocated \nthe largest share, given its priority and its implementation scale across a larger set of village-level \ncluster schools as well as exemplar schools in each state. Partial disbursement will be allowed \nfor most of DLIs once target achievement has reached a minimum level (e.g., about 60%). \n \nTable 2: Disbursement-Linked Indicators \nDisbursement  Share of Total \nAllocation  ADB \nIndicators  ($ million)  Financing (%) \nOutcome: Education outcomes in primary and secondary schools \n   \nimproved in the five participating states \nDLI 1: Improved proficiency in language and math among primary students  45    9.0 \n(grade 3)     \nDLI 2: Reduced dropout rate at secondary level (from grade 9 to 10)  30    6.0 \nOutput 1: Quality government schools with equitable access increased       \nDLI 3: Exemplar schools established with improved learning environments for  95    19.0 \nquality education     \nDLI 4: Improved provision of secondary subject teachers for quality education   42    8.4 \nOutput 2: Quality and relevance of learning improved     \nDLI 5: Foundational learning in elementary education strengthened through          115    23.0 \nLEPs     \nDLI 6: Science and math learning strengthened for secondary education  54    10.8 \n(grades 9\u201312) through STEAM LEPs     \nOutput 3: Capacity of teachers and school leaders enhanced     \nDLI 7: Statewide continuous development of teachers and school leaders \n52    10.4 \nenhanced to improve interactive teaching practices and effective school \n   \nmanagement with state-specific gender targets \nOutput 4: Management of school education system strengthened     \nDLI 8: State capacity for outcome-based planning and monitoring mechanisms  42    8.4 \nstrengthened     \nOutput 5: National guidelines on quality state education strengthened     \nDLI 9: National guidelines on curriculum and assessments strengthened for \n25    5.0 \nquality state education \nTotal  500    100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank; DLI = disbursement-linked indicator; LEP = learning enhancement program; STEAM \n= science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n21.  DLI verification arrangements. A rigorous verification protocol has been developed for \nDLIs (Appendix 3). For each DLI, program states will submit the required data and reports \nfollowing the verification protocol, which will be reviewed and consolidated by the MOE. An \nindependent verification agency (IVA) will be engaged by the MOE in consultation with ADB to \nverify and confirm the achievement of DLI targets according to the verification protocol. The IVA \nis required to have experience and competency relevant to the RBL program. Key prerequisites \nfor effective implementation of the RBL program are identified as prior results for select DLIs; \nachievement of prior results will be verified by independent technical experts engaged through an \nADB technical assistance (TA).24 \n \n23 All indicators are in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n24 ADB. 2019.

ADB financing will play a catalytic role in consolidating the state\u2019s fragmented efforts with \nan outcome focus to make transformative impacts on the quality of education. ADB adds value \nspecifically in (i) operationalizing exemplar schools to demonstrate quality learning environments \nand interventions that will be replicated within and across the states under the NEP, (ii) mitigating \nCOVID-19 impacts on learning deficits by scaling up foundational learning to village-level schools \nand introducing STEAM and 21st century skills learning, (iii) reorienting classroom practices to \nempower students and teachers through expanded student-centered LEPs, (iv) helping the states \nmainstream digital education with enhanced teacher capability and socially inclusive digital \nlearning materials, and (v) leveraging ADB\u2019s experience in India\u2019s skills sector to facilitate \nintegrated vocational education through partnership with major stakeholders. The ADB assistance \ncomplements the World Bank\u2019s support for quality education in six selected states, creating \nsynergy  for  development  results  under  Samagra  Shiksha.  Finally,  based  on  its  extensive \noperational experience in the region, ADB will also bring knowledge and practical solutions and \nfacilitate the sharing of innovative practices with other states in India and other countries. \n \nF.  Expenditure Framework and Financing Plan \n \n23.  Program expenditures. The RBL program expenditures are estimated at $1,885.6 million \nduring FY2023\u2013FY2027 (Table 3). The budget estimate includes both ongoing expenditures and \nthe incremental budget required for succeeding RBL program interventions. A significant share \nwill come from the select components of Samagra Shiksha aligned with the program outputs. \nMost expenditures (70%) are recurring in nature; these include quality interventions to enhance \nlearning outcomes, capacity building of teachers and professionals, strengthening of governance \ncapacity, and hiring of contract teachers. Capital expenses will account for about 30% of the total \nfor improvements in learning environments (e.g., labs, libraries, digital infrastructure, and ICT-\nenabled classrooms), sex-segregated sanitation facilities, barrier-free facilities in exemplar and \nselected cluster schools, and the MIS. \n \nTable 3: Summary of Program Expenditure Framework, FY2023\u2013FY2027 \n(in 2020 prices) \n    Amount  Share of Total \nItem      ($ million)  (%) \nRecurrent  1,327.9  70.0 \nCapital  557.7  30.0 \n  Total  1,885.6  100.0 \nFY = fiscal year. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n24.  Program financing. The government has requested a regular loan of $500 million from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 20-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the \nstraight-line method, the average maturity is 12.75 years and there is no maturity premium \npayable to ADB.

Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n25.  Various assessments for the RBL program have identified areas for institutional capacity \nand system strengthening, which are included in the program action plan (PAP).25 The PAP has \nbeen agreed with the program states and the MOE, and it will be updated during implementation \nas needed. The PAP includes actions to enhance technical capacity, gender and social inclusion, \nfinancial management, procurement, environmental management, and social safeguards for \noverall program system strengthening. An ADB TA will support and monitor PAP implementation \nto ensure the MOE and the states achieve incremental and sustainable changes.26 \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.  The RBL program will be implemented following the well-established mechanisms of \nSamagra Shiksha that have its personnel at the state, district, block, and cluster levels. The MOE \nis the executing agency responsible for overall program implementation and coordination of \nprogram activities across the states, with assistance from the central program management unit \nand technical experts.27 The MOE and the states will implement the RBL program activities. In \nthe states, the SIS\u2014responsible for Samagra Shiksha\u2014will be each state\u2019s implementing agency, \nheaded by the state project director. Within the SIS, a nodal officer will be appointed to manage, \ncoordinate, monitor, and report on the RBL program with a dedicated team of officers and \nconsultants. The states will implement the program according to each state\u2019s program results \nframework and submit regular progress reports on DLIs and PAP. The MOE will consolidate state-\nlevel  reports  and  provide  periodic  progress reports on  DLIs,  PAP,  and  other  performance \nindicators. The MOE will submit DLI achievement reports to the IVA. Once the verification report \nis ready by the IVA, the MOE will submit a withdrawal application to ADB for disbursement. \n \n27.  Disbursement arrangements. Disbursement will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed  between  the  government  and  ADB.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s consolidated fund. ADB disbursement will be made following the achievement of \nDLIs  and  subsequent  verification  of  DLIs  according  to  verification  protocols. 28  Where \nachievement is partial, partial disbursement may be made from ADB to the MOE as laid out in the \nverification protocol. The prior results linked to $75 million are expected to be achieved within 12 \n \n25 Program Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 The proposed Technical Assistance to India for Strengthening State Education Capacity to Improve Results, which \nwill support the RBL program and be financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, is under processing.  \n27 For the central project management unit, the MOE will engage supporting technical agencies, consultants, and/or \nexperts for the RBL program under the national component (output 5).  \n28 Following ADB\u2019s disbursement to the MOE, the MOE will disburse funds to each of the states based on achievements \nof state-specific DLIs as laid out in the verification protocol. The total amount allocated to the states is the following: \n$105 million for Tamil Nadu, $100 million for Gujarat, $95 million for Assam, $90 million for Jharkhand, $85 million \nfor Uttarakhand, and $25 million for the MOE.

SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n28.  Program  soundness  and  results  assessment.  The  program\u2019s  soundness  was \nassessed with respect to relevance and adequacy. The program is highly relevant to India\u2019s \nnational priority of improving the quality of education and enhancing student learning outcomes. \nIt reflects the NEP 2020 emphasis on strong foundational skills and preparing the youth with \nemployable skills. The program\u2019s focused support to a set of exemplar and cluster schools\u2014\nwhich are geographically representative with attention to socially disadvantaged groups\u2014will \nenable effective implementation of planned interventions. The exemplar schools will serve as \nhosts for the development of school clusters or complexes and become models for the MOE\u2019s \nnew national-level initiative on exemplar schools to replicate quality interventions across the \nstates. Finally, the program will strengthen the capacity of key institutions within the states to \nensure the sustainability of program interventions. The DLIs, PAP, and design and monitoring \nframework have been formulated through a series of consultations with each of the program \nstates. Each state has prepared its own state-level results framework, which helps build strong \nownership of the RBL program. The results framework is designed following an education system \nstrengthening approach, and the DLIs are critical indicators for achieving overall program results, \nsequenced to incentivize good performance. \n \n29.  Economic analysis. The program will improve students\u2019 ability to learn and increase \nfuture employability. It will strengthen foundational and cognitive skills and enhance the overall \neducation  system,  which  in  turn  will  improve  individuals\u2019  labor  market  opportunities  (job \nplacement) and economic returns (wages). A more knowledgeable and skilled workforce is \nessential to the country\u2019s emerging innovation-based economy. Given the program\u2019s structure \n(i.e., results-based modality contributing to an ongoing government program), a cost\u2013benefit \nanalysis was not conducted. \n \n30.  Poverty,  social,  and  gender.  The  program  is  categorized  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. It has a strong gender and social inclusion focus, with attention to those from \nscheduled tribe, scheduled caste, and OBC groups, who mostly attend government schools. \nImproved quality of education will help enhance their employment and livelihood opportunities. \nThe program includes proactive measures in the DLIs and PAP to ensure program benefits to \nwomen, which include (i) inclusion of girls\u2019 only schools in the list of exemplar schools; (ii) \nprovision of adequate sex-segregated sanitation facilities in exemplar schools; (iii) incorporation \nof specific schemes to retain girls (as well as people from scheduled tribe, scheduled caste, or \nOBC groups) in state plans on preventing dropouts; (iv) inclusion of female-specific targets for \ncapacity development of teachers, school leaders, and SCERT and DIET staff; (v) inclusion of a \nmodule on gender- and socially inclusive education in training for teachers and principals; (vi) \n \n ", "12 \ngender and socially inclusive learning\u2013teaching contents; and (vii) segregation of state MIS and \nmonitoring data by gender and social category. \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n31.  Monitoring and evaluation system. The RBL program will be anchored in the Samagra \nShiksha, for which monitoring and evaluation (M&E) processes are well-defined and functional \nacross  the  states  in  most  aspects.  However,  necessary  enhancements  to  state  MIS  and \nmonitoring systems are needed to ensure the availability of adequate data and timely tracking \nand reporting against the DLIs. Strengthening of state MIS systems is one of the DLIs (DLI 8). \nAreas for strengthening include (i) improving the availability and quality of data in the MISs, (ii) \nensuring the availability of quality parameters such as learning outcomes and LEP implementation, \n(iii) developing the capacity of field staff in the program states for proper monitoring and reporting, \nand (iv) filling vacancies in the state MIS team and field staff. Along with the state-level MIS \nenhancement efforts, the RBL program\u2019s M&E system will be supplemented by a dedicated state \nprogram implementation unit with M&E expertise, along with the MOE\u2019s central support for \nperiodic reviews and monitoring. \n \n32.  Fiduciary systems. The financial management, procurement, and anticorruption systems \nassessments confirm that the existing systems under Samagra Shiksha are adequate for the RBL \nprogram with some risk mitigation measures. The overall financial management risk is assessed \nas substantial. The areas for improvement include (i) the Samagra Shiksha financial management \nframework is not consistently applied by the program states; (ii) states have varying capacity with \ndifferent fund flows, accounting systems and processes; and (iii) recurring control issues and audit \nobservations are not addressed in a timely way. Mitigation measures include (i) the MOE will \nconduct assessment of practices and gaps in accounting, staffing, reporting, management and \nflow of funds, and tracking of audit observations; (ii) actions will be taken to build the capacity for \nfinancial  management;  and  (iii)  the  MOE  will  submit  six  monthly  consolidated  financial \nmanagement reports, including actions taken on audit observations. ADB will support the MOE \nand the states to address the issues and enhance their capacity. \n \n33.  The  program\u2019s  procurement  includes  acquisition  of  teaching\u2013learning  materials; \nupgrading of science and ICT labs, sanitation facilities, and digital infrastructure (both hardware \nand software); and hiring of consultants for program implementation. The RBL program will \nexclude  high-value  contracts  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  RBL  policy 29 and  will  follow  the \nprocurement procedures of Samagra Shiksha. The assessment of procurement capacity and \npractices across the states and the MOE indicate that the overall procurement risk is moderate. \nThe areas for improvement include (i) provision of periodic capacity building for procurement staff, \n(ii) procurement planning and monitoring to avoid delays, and (iii) timely disclosure of procurement \ninformation in the relevant website for transparency. \n \n34.  The  national  and  state  anticorruption  systems  are  in  place,  as  well  as  the  MOE\u2019s \nGovernance  and  Accountability  Framework.  Considering  the  scope  of  RBL  program,  the \ncorruption risk is assessed as low. The RBL program will ensure compliance with the Financial \nManagement and Procurement Manual of Samagra Shiksha that requires the highest standards \nof ethics during procurement and execution of government contracts with strict provisions for any \nfraud and corruption. ADB\u2019s Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other \n \n29 High-value procurement includes contracts of $50 million for works, turnkey and supply, and installation contracts; \n$30 million for goods; $20 million for information technology systems and non-consulting services; and $15 million \nfor consulting services. \n ", "13 \nProhibited Activities in Results-Based Lending for Programs were explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the MOE.30 \n \n35.  Safeguard systems. The RBL program is classified category B for environment and \nindigenous peoples, and C for involuntary resettlement in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). The RBL program\u2019s overall safeguard risk is low based on the initial \nsafeguards screening. The program will support upgrading works for learning (e.g., classrooms \nand libraries) and sanitation facilities of the existing schools that are being designated as \nexemplar schools. The works will take place at the existing school premises; hence, there will be \nno land acquisition, resettlement, and legacy issues. The minor upgrading works are likely to \ncause minimal, temporary, and reversible environmental impacts that could be easily mitigated \nthrough environmental management plans. The program safeguard system assessment reviewed \nnational- and state-level environmental safeguard frameworks and the institutional capacity for \naddressing the safeguard risks.31 The assessment found that adequate relevant policies and \nregulations are in place. It identified a few gaps in the areas of site screening, assessment, \nmanagement plans, and monitoring, for which gap-filling measures are proposed in eligibility \ncriteria  for  exemplar  schools,  implementation  of  environmental  management  plans,  and \nsubmission  of  semiannual  monitoring reports. The  safeguard  system related  to  indigenous \npeoples indicates there will be no adverse impacts. The RBL program will improve the quality of \ngovernment schools and provide learning enhancement for students, with special attention to \nthose from scheduled tribe and scheduled caste groups. Hence, the program is expected to have \npositive impacts on the quality of education for indigenous peoples. Some measures to ensure \nthe program\u2019s positive impacts are in the PAP, including consultations with indigenous peoples \ncommunities. The program safeguard system assessment also recommends the strengthening \nof institutional capacity for safeguard monitoring, with the engagement of environment and social \nsafeguard specialists at the national- and state-level implementing agencies. Activities with \npotential category A impacts in the environment or social safeguards will be excluded from the \nprogram. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n36.  The program\u2019s outcomes and outputs will be maintained as they represent core priorities \nof quality education at the national and state levels. Foundational literacy and numeracy are given \nthe highest priority in the NEP 2020 and these will be further emphasized in accordance with the \nmandate from the new National Mission on Foundational Literacy and Numeracy. The operational \nconcepts for government exemplar schools are being replicated across India through MOE\u2019s new \ninitiative on exemplar schools, following the NEP 2020. The sustainability of school-level results \nwill be ensured through the development of school-level quality improvement plans, combined \nwith the state\u2019s incentive mechanisms, which will enhance ownership of school improvement and \nquality interventions. The sustainability of state-level results will be ensured through extensive \ncapacity building of the state\u2019s key institutional stakeholders (e.g., SCERTs and DIETs) and \nimplementation officials at district, block, and cluster levels, as well as through the strengthening \nof the MIS and monitoring systems. In view of the priority given to quality education, both  \nSamagra Shiksha and state financing will be able to sustain the program\u2019s overall results. \n \n \n30 The ADB Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities in Results-Based \nLending for Programs is attached as Appendix 6 of the Program Implementation Document (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Program Safeguard System Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "14 \nD.

LEPs for secondary levels would refer to project-based learning, personalized \nadoptive learning practices with EdTech programs, or other types with strong student-centered learning orientations.  \n ", "    Appendix 3  23 \n \nTarget Values  \nBaseline Value and  Prior results  2022\u20132023  2023\u20132024  2024\u20132025  2025\u20132026  2026\u20132027 \nDLIs   Year  (2021\u20132022)  (Year 1)  (Year 2)  (Year 3)  (Year 4)  (Year 5) \n(grades 9\u201312) through    LEPs  teachers  selected  the STEAM  the STEAM \nSTEAM LEPs  approved in  trained for  STEAM LEPs   LEPs.
