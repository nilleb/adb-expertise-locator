In  2008,  the  municipality  had  a  population  of  about  8.7  million.  Some \n3.5 million people reside in its dense inner urban core. Wuhan\u2019s urban area is divided into three \nparts  (Hankou,  Hanyang,  and  Wuchang  areas)  by  the  Yangtze  and  Han  rivers.  The  proposed \nproject  is  a  key  urban  environmental  initiative  of  Wuhan  municipal  government  (WMG)  with \nnationwide  demonstration  potential.  The  project  will  help  WMG  to  (i)  design  and  implement \nsustainable  solutions  for  the  management  of  wastewater  treatment  plant  (WWTP)  sludge, \nincluding its energy recovery and reuse of biosolids; (ii) improve water quality in urban lakes and \nwater  channels;  (iii)  reestablish  water  circulation  and  improve  resilience  to  floods;  (iv) improve \nthe  environment,  living  conditions,  and  public  health  standards;  and  (v)  enhance  public \nawareness of urban environmental and related public health issues. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe  project  has  a  strong  rationale  both  in  terms  of  urban  development  and \nenvironmental improvement. It follows and complements two previous Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  loans, 1  which  have  the  objective  of  building  the  necessary  wastewater  treatment \ninfrastructure  in  Wuhan.  The  project  supports  the  PRC\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (2008\u2013\n2010):2 promoting efficient infrastructure, strengthening environmental management, supporting \ninclusive  growth,  and  balanced  development.  The  project  is  part  of  Wuhan\u2019s  master  plan \npriorities on sanitation, environment improvements, and urban development and will contribute \nto establishing Wuhan City as a model for sustainable development in the PRC. \n \n4. \nThe  current  sludge  treatment  and  disposal  arrangements  are  not  sustainable  in  the \nPRC.  The  Government  of  the  PRC  is  actively  looking  for  potential  solutions  for  the  country\u2019s \nrapidly increasing volume of sewage sludge. By the end of 2008, 80% of Wuhan Municipality\u2019s \nwastewater  was  being  treated.  The  initial  success  of  the  wastewater  treatment  investment, \nsupported  by  two  prior  ADB  loans,  has  created  an  associated  environmental  challenge  of \neffectively  managing  657  tons  of  sewage  sludge  generated  daily  by  the  existing  WWTPs, \ncreating a serious environmental threat. There is an urgent need for a comprehensive solution \nfor sludge treatment and utilization; and to release the pressure on landfills, which are currently \nthe primary means of disposal. \n \nThe  project  is  the  first  ADB-assisted  project  to  pursue  comprehensive  sludge \n5. \nmanagement  while  fully  attending  to  environmental  concerns  such  as  circular  economy  and \nclimate change mitigation. The policy discussion between the executing agency and the project \nteam  introduced  a  decentralized  and  integrated  approach  for  the  sludge  facilities\u2014based  on \nsludge  digestion  and  drying  for  beneficial  reuse  through  land  application\u2014fully  complying  with \nADB  policies  and  recognized  by  the  PRC  as  the  best  practice  to  support  the  3Rs  policy  of \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2003.

By  doing  so,  the  project  has  also  guided and  reoriented  the  long-\nterm  original  sludge  master  plan  of  the  city  based  on  centralized  treatment  and  solo \nincineration,3 which is controversial in terms of compliance with ADB\u2019s climate change agenda.  \n \nThe project will provide facilities to treat sludge from five of Wuhan\u2019s WWTPs and handle \n6. \nabout  half  (or  350  tons/day  [t/d])  of  Wuhan\u2019s  total  sludge  production.  Three  of  these  WWTPs \nwere built under the earlier ADB-funded loans (footnote 1). Each of the three proposed sludge \ntreatment plants will be built on site and will take advantage of the urban master plan advocating \nfor an integrated, practical, and sustainable concept of urban environmental development. The \nproject  promotes  environmentally  friendly  sludge  digestion  by  (i)  capturing  and  using  clean \nbiogas  of  an  existing  sludge  facility  financed  by  ADB,  and  (ii)  using  the  steam  of  an  existing \nthermal  power  plant  to  dry  sludge  at  the  sludge  treatment  plant.  Both  approaches  reduce \nreliance on external energy sources required for the drying process. Subject to proper analysis \nmonitoring  and  environmental  safeguards,  treated  sludge  will  be  used  as  soil  conditioner,  as \nconstruction material, and for rehabilitating damaged urban land.4 \n \nWhile comprehensive sludge solutions have not been fully recognized and benchmarked \n7. \nby the PRC authorities, the project has a potential of setting national policy decision making on \nsludge management. The beneficiary use of sludge promoted by the project will provide a model \nof  managing  WWTP  sludge,  extend  the  operational  life  of  landfills,  reduce  the  sludge \ntransportation  cost,  and  achieve  greenhouse  gas  reductions,  among  other  environmental \nbenefits. 5 The  project  will  contribute  as  a  pilot  project  to  the  development  of  a  nationwide \nframework  for  sludge  management  by  the  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Urban-Rural  Development, \nsupported by an ADB ongoing advisory technical assistance study\u2014Urban Wastewater Reuse \nand Sludge Utilization Policy Study.6 \n \n8. \nThe project will also pioneer the optimization of WWTPs\u2019 performance. This task will be \ncarried out for the whole of Wuhan. It will improve the performance of infrastructure financed by \ntwo  previous  ADB  projects  (Wuhan Wastewater  Management  Project  and  Wuhan Wastewater \nand Stormwater Management Project [WWSMP]) in Wuhan. The core task will be to ensure the \nsteady performance of the WWTPs, to achieve design effluent parameters, as well as improve \nsludge quality for its beneficial disposal. \n \n9. \nLakes  and  rivers  represent  25%  of  Wuhan\u2019s  urban  area.  They  are  part  of  a  complex \nwater  system  within  the  vast  Jianghan  flood  plain,  naturally  connected  to  the  Han  and  the \nYangtze rivers. This water system and its natural water circulation sustain the healthy condition \nof  lakes.  In  recent  years,  however,  agricultural  activity,  urban  construction  boom,  and \nenvironmental  neglect  altered  the  area.  These  caused  the  disappearance  of  many  lakes,  the \nblocking of connection channels, and restricting of hydraulic circulation. Of the nearly 100 lakes \nexisting in Wuhan City in the middle of the 20th century, only 38 remain. The pollution impact of \nhuge  amounts  of  wastewater  previously  discharged  on  the aquatic  environment  was  amplified \n\n                                                 \n3   Incineration  greatly  reduces  the  volume  of  wastewater  sludge  and  can  take  advantage  of  the  calorific  content  in \nthese  materials.  However,  it  requires  large  capital  investments  in  infrastructure  and  high  operational  costs,  and \nrequires  additional  fuel\u2014usually  fossil  fuel\u2014to  create  the  burn.  Incinerators  in  more  developed  countries  are \nsubject to increasingly strict air pollution control standards, which require increased complexity and costs. \n\n4  See Tang Mountain rehabilitation subcomponent (para. 14). \n5  The main benefits can be quantified as follows: (i) reduction of the annual landfill space capacity by 78,629 cubic \nmeters  (m3)  per  year;  (ii)  prolongation  of  the  existing  landfill  service  life  of  16  years  for  the  Cangshankou  landfill \nsite;  and  (iii)  saving  the  transportation  cost  of  CNY2.15  million  per  year  and  the  landfill  disposal  cost  of \nCNY2.36 million per year. \n\n6  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Urban Wastewater Reuse and Sludge \n\nUtilization Policy Study. Manila (TA 7083-PRC). \n\n\fbecause  of  water  stagnation.  The  result  is  a  degraded  urban  environment  as  well  as  reduced \nassimilative  and  hydraulic  capacity  of  surface  water  to  handle  pollution  and  flood  events.  The \npollution has reached 56% of the local rivers and 89% of the lakes. Wuhan lakes\u2019 water quality \nis currently measured at classes IV\u2013V or worse. \n \n10. \nThe  project  will  address  key  ecological  and  social  needs  to  restore  the  ecological \ncapacity, the natural hydraulic circulation, and water quality in urban surface water systems. It \nwill  increase  water  system  resilience  and  promote  integrated  surface  water  management  to \nimprove  the  urban  environment  and  reduce  the  risk  of  flooding.  The  project  will  unblock  the \nchannels  connecting  the  lakes,  and  support  the  construction  of  wetlands  to  increase  water \nregeneration  and  flood  retention  capacities  in  the  Hanyang  and  Wuchang  areas.  In  parallel,  it \nwill promote point source and nonpoint source pollution control, raise community environmental \nawareness, and conduct institutional strengthening. The creation of healthy and well-managed \nwater  systems  in  Wuhan  will  allow  urban  expansion  in  flood-safe  and  environmentally  clean \nareas to support the city\u2019s sustainable development. The Yangtze flood plain area where Wuhan \nCity is located is significantly vulnerable to climate change. The project will allow the restoration \nof  the  retention  capacity  of  lake  areas  to  mitigate  climate  change  impacts  and  increase  the \nresilience  of  the  city  to  natural  hazards,  such  as  floods  and  drought,  associated  with  climate \nchange. \n \nThe  project,  which  builds  on  experience  of  lake  rehabilitation  in  the  PRC,7 will  be  a \n11. \nmodel  for  lake  rehabilitation  and  integrated  surface  water  management  in  Wuhan  and  for  the \nentire country. In addition, the project will support the development of a water quality model that \nwill assist in long-term planning, water quality assurance and forecast, promoting water balance \nand emergency response.8 \n \n12. \nThe  project  will  enhance  environmental  awareness  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of \ninfrastructure  investments  and  to  maximize  long-term  social  benefits.  The  environmental \nawareness  program  will  focus  on  three  stakeholders  who  generate  and  are  affected  by  point \nand  nonpoint  source  pollution:  (i)  small  businesses  operating  adjacent  to  the  lake  system, \n(ii) communities  living  in  the  project  area,  and  (iii)  schoolchildren  in  the  project  area.  This \nprogram  will  help  ensure  that  regulatory  practices  are  well  understood  and  that  necessary \nbehavior  changes  regarding  nonpoint  source  pollution  are  addressed.  A  capacity  building \nsubcomponent will support further tariff reforms and will conduct a willingness-to-pay survey for \nsludge tariff setting in selected focus group and communities. These initiatives will assist WMG \nto  achieve  full  cost  recovery  of  both  wastewater  and  sludge  management  services  over  the \nmedium term (2018). \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  is  improved  urban  environment,  public  health,  and  living \nconditions in Wuhan Municipality. The outcome of the project is integrated urban water resource \nmanagement, and wastewater sludge treatment and disposal in Wuhan Municipality. \n \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB. 2004.

The  Sanjintan  WWTP  Biogas \nUtilization  and  Sludge  Drying  Plant  will  support  biogas  utilization  from  the  Sanjintan  WWTP \nsludge digestion to dry its own sludge and the sludge of other WWTPs. The dried sludge will be \nsent to the nearby fertilizer plant for reuse as soil conditioner. The existing WWTP9 units include \nthe  anaerobic  digestion  facility  commissioned  in  August  2009.  The  sludge  design  treatment \ncapacity is 100 t/d. The Tangxunhu WWTP Sludge Drying Plant will support the sludge drying \nfacility of 200 t/d capacity for two WWTPs. After the extension of the nearby Baoxie WWTP, its \nraw  sludge  will  also  be  treated  by  the  sludge  facility.  The  sludge  will  be  disposed  of  as  fill-in \nconstruction material, for soil remediation, and as soil conditioner. The steam for sludge drying \nwill be supplied by the nearby Gaoxin Heat Power Plant. The Nantaizihu WWTP Sludge Lime \nStabilization Plant will support the sludge lime stabilization facility with the treatment capacity of \n50  t/d.  The  stabilized  sludge  will  be  utilized  for  the  Tang  Mountain  soil  remediation10 or  as \nbuilding  material.  The  project  will  modify  and  improve  existing  sludge  treatment  in  related \nWWTPs to meet project needs and the respective requirements of the drainage company. The \nproject will also provide sludge transportation trucks and laboratory instruments to monitor and \nanalyze the quality of dried sludge. \n \nComponent 2: Wuhan New Zone lakes and channels rehabilitation and pumping station \n15. \ncomponent  includes  (i)  Longyang  Lake  rehabilitation  comprising  sediment  dredging,  wetland \npark,  artificial  wetland,  aquatic  plant,  and  Tang  Mountain  rehabilitation;  (ii)  Moshui  Lake \nrehabilitation  comprising  sediment  dredging,  artificial  wetland  ecological  project,  and  aquatic \nplants; (iii) Nantaizi Lake rehabilitation comprising sediment dredging, artificial wetlands, aquatic \nplants, and biological buffer area; (iv) six water channels to be rehabilitated including dredging, \nslope protection, greening, and provision of gates to control flows; and (v) Sixin pumping station \nwith initial capacity of 35 cubic meters per second (m3/s) controlling the water flood in Hanyang \narea. \n \n16. \nComponent  3:  Yangchun  Lake  secondary  urban  center  lake  and  channel  rehabilitation \ncomponent  includes  (i)  Yangchun  Lake  rehabilitation  component  comprising  the  recovery  of \n64 hectares (ha) of lake surface, ecological treatment, greening, construction of a storm water \ntreatment  system,  and  18  ha  of  artificial  wetland;  and  (ii)  Heping  water  channels  to  be \nrehabilitated  including  dredging,  slope  protection,  greening,  and  provision  of  gates  to  control \nflows. \n \n17. \nComponent  4:  Capacity  building  and  institutional  strengthening  includes  (i)  package  1: \nproject implementation management consulting services, including training and assistance with \nADB  procedures;  (ii)  package  2:  wastewater  operation  and  maintenance  improvement,  sludge \ntreatment support and exploration of private sector participation for operating the sludge units; \nand (iii) package 3: surface water management and public awareness campaign. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $501.8  million  equivalent,  including  taxes  and \n\n18. \nduties of $26.4 million.

Upon  completion,  project  facilities  will  be  handed  over  to  the  relevant  government \ndepartment or public utility that will act as operational unit for facilities responsible for operation \nand  maintenance.12 Both  Wuhan  Project  Management  Office  and  Wuhan  Urban  Construction \nFunds  Management  Office  are  involved  in  implementation  of  the  ongoing  WWSMP;  financial \nassessments have previously been performed on both organizations and they have been found \nto be satisfactory. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n23. \nThe  project  will  directly  benefit  over  3  million  urban  residents  by  improving  living \nconditions, public health standards, and the urban environment of Wuhan municipality resulting \nfrom  (i)  proper  treatment  and  disposal  of  sludge  from  WWTPs,  (ii)  reduced  pollution  and \nimproved management of surface water bodies in two newly developed areas, and (iii) improved \nprotection from flooding and associated hazards. The project will have a high impact on climate \nchange adaptation and mitigation. \n \nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n24. \nA  financial  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  of  the  revenue-generating  sludge  treatment  and \ndisposal  component  confirmed  financial  viability  by  concluding  that  the  component\u2019s  financial \ninternal rate of return (7.4%) exceeded the weighted average cost of capital (3.3%). A sensitivity \nand risk analysis revealed that the component\u2019s financial internal rate of return is most sensitive \nto  revenue  variations\u2014hence,  timely  tariff  adjustments  and/or  the  availability  of  government \nsubsidies,  as  proposed,  will  be  crucial.  A  financial  analysis  of  Wuhan  Urban  Drainage \nDevelopment  Company  (WUDDC)  evaluated  existing  tariff  and  cost-recovery  arrangements, \nand  concluded  that  the  proposed  WMG  subsidies  to  WUDDC  will  be  required  in  the  short-  to \nmedium-term  as  full  cost  recovery  is  unrealistic  in  the  short  term.  WMG  will  contribute \ncounterpart  funding,  service  loans,  and  shoulder  operation  and  maintenance  costs  for  the \nnonrevenue-generating components. A fiscal analysis indicated that WMG\u2019s annual contribution \nthrough its Wuhan Urban Development Fund will not exceed 7.6% of annual revenues, over the \nprojection  period  (2010-2019).  Therefore, \nthe  nonrevenue-generating  components  are \nconsidered  both  financially  sustainable  and  affordable.  A  financial  management  assessment \nconcluded  that  Wuhan  Project  Management  Office  and  the  implementing  agency  are \nexperienced  in  managing  ADB  projects  and  are  prepared  for  project  implementation.  The \nfinancial management assessment identified several issues that will be addressed, including the \nneed for financial management training for new staff.13 \n \n25. \nThe  economic  analysis  evaluated  technical  options  and  confirmed  that  project \ncomponents are the least-cost options in support of Wuhan\u2019s long-term development plans. The \nproject  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  computed  at  20.48%,  which  exceeds  the  economic \nopportunity cost of capital of 12%. The result is robust relative to the normal range of sensitivity \nanalyses.  Quantifiable  economic  benefits  identified  for  the  sludge  component  are  (i)  land \nsavings  from  prolonged  landfill  life,  (ii)  incremental  landfill  operation  cost  savings,  (iii)  fertilizer \nsavings  from  applying  sludge  as  a  soil  conditioner,  and  (iv)  fuel  savings  from  using  biogas. \nQuantifiable  economic  benefits  of  the  lakes  and  channels  rehabilitation  components  include \n\n                                                 \n12  There  are  three  operating  units:  (i)  Wuhan  Urban  Drainage  Development  Company  (WUDDC)  for  the  sludge \ntreatment  and  disposal  component,  (ii)  Hanyang  District  Water  Bureau  for  the  Wuhan  New  Zone  lakes/channels \nrehabilitation  and  pumping  stations,  and  (iii)  Yangchun  Lake  New  District  Water  Bureau  for  the  Yangchun  lake \nsecondary urban center lakes/channels rehabilitation. \n\n13  A  summary  financial  analysis  and  financial  management  assessment  is  in  Appendix  2  (Financial  Analysis  and \n\nFinancial Management Assessment). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n(i) increased  land  and  real  estate  values,  (ii)  health  benefits,  (iii)  recreation  and  pedagogical \nvalue of wetland parks, and (iv) flood risk reductions.14  \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n26. \nwith the government and WMG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n27. \nThe  project  area  of  Hanyang,  Hongshan,  and  Wuchang  districts  covers  698.5  square \nkilometers  (km2).  In  2007,  701,300  households  and  a  population  of  2,618,000\u2014including \n27,483 poor  households  (3.92%)\u2014inhabited  the  area.  The  average  income  per  capita  per \nmonth was CNY1,196.5 and the unemployment rate was 4.2%.15 \n \n28. \nHealth  impacts. Potential health hazards from improper disposal of WWTP sludge will \nbe  greatly  reduced.  A  health  impact  assessment  was  conducted  during  project  preparation. \nBenefits  from  a  reduction  of  morbidity  and  mortality  from  waterborne  carcinogenic  and \nnoncarcinogenic  diseases  for  local  residents  will  also  accrue  under  the  lakes  and  channels \nrehabilitation components. Public health indicators will be monitored during implementation. \n \nEmployment impacts. The project will directly generate about 3,245 full-time positions16 \n29. \n(38,935  person-months)  during  construction  (3  years)  and  144  full-time  positions17 during  the \noperations  phase.  It  will  indirectly  generate  about  1,841  positions 18  per  year.  Employment \ntargets  for  local  unskilled  workers,  women,  and  vulnerable  groups  and  core  labor  standards \nhave  been  included  in  the  social  action  plan  and  gender  action  plan  (Appendix  2)  and  will  be \nmonitored. HIV, AIDS and sexually transmitted infection awareness training will be included in \ncontractor bidding documents and monitored during implementation. \n \nGender  impacts.  The  project  has  been  designed  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming. \n30. \nWomen  focus  group  discussions  found  that  environmental  improvements  are  anticipated  to \nhave  a  significant  gender  impact,  with  reduced  time  burdens  and  costs  for  healthcare  and \nenvironmental  cleanup.  Women  are  usually  in  charge  of  household  budgets  for  utilities  and \nexpressed greater knowledge about fees. A total of 94.8% expressed willingness to participate \nin  environmental  and  health  awareness  projects  in  addition  to  tariff  programs  planned  by  the \nproject.19 \n \nPublic  awareness  impacts.  Two  public  awareness  programs\u2014environmental  and \n31. \nhealth  awareness  and  public  consultation  for  tariff  increases\u2014will  be  supported  under  the \ncapacity building component. These will help sustain the positive impacts of infrastructure and \nrehabilitation.  The  environmental  and  health  awareness  program  will \nthree \nstakeholders  that  generate  and  are  affected  by  point  and  nonpoint  source  pollution:  (i)  small \nbusinesses  adjacent  to  the  lake  system,  (ii)  communities  living  in  the  project  area,  and \n\nfocus  on \n\n                                                 \n14  A summary economic analysis is in Appendix 2 (Economic Analysis). \n15  The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 2. \n16  Providing total gross income of CNY143 million. \n17  Providing total gross annual income of CNY7.722 million. \n18  Totaling CNY77.335 million gross annual income. \n19 The  gender  action  plan  ensures  (i)  women\u2019s  employment  in  the  project;  (ii)  participation  and  gender-sensitive \ntraining in environmental awareness and public health programs, and outreach for public participation in the tariff \nreform program; and (iii) appropriate gender targets, indicators, and sex-disaggregated data for project monitoring \nand evaluation.  \n\n\f(iii) schoolchildren in the project area. This program will help to ensure that regulatory practices \nare well understood and that necessary behaviour changes regarding nonpoint source pollution \nare  addressed.  The  program  will  be  coordinated  with  existing  environmental  awareness \nprograms  run  by  the  Environmental  Protection  Bureau,  local  nongovernmental  organizations, \nand community-based associations and schools. \n \n32. \nStakeholder  consultation.  During  project  preparation,  local  government  and  line \nagencies, villagers, enterprises, local groups, and other people likely to be directly affected by \nthe project were consulted. A total of 504 households and 100 businesses were surveyed during \nproject preparation. Consultations indicate that the project has a high level of public support. A \nconsultation and participation plan for the project has been prepared.  \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n33. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  impact.  The  land \nacquisition and resettlement impact for the project will be significant. Only components 2 and 3 \nof  the  project  will  entail  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts.  Hongshan  and  Hanyang \ndistricts  will  be  directly  affected  by  the  project,  involving  three  street  committees  and  16 \nadministrative  villages.  In  total,  about  3,423.55 mu20 of  land  will  be  permanently  acquired  and \n555.60 mu will be occupied temporarily. There will be demolition of 126,536 square meters (m2) \nof  residential  houses  and  31,957  m2  of  nonresidential  houses.  In  total,  376  households  with \n1,365  persons  will  be  affected  directly  by  land  acquisition  and  house  demolition.  Another  22 \naffected  enterprises,  institutions  involving  33 employees,  and  14  shops  will  also  suffer \ndemolition impacts. The current resettlement budget for the project is CNY1.5 billion, including \nland  acquisition,  relocation  compensation,  and  all  other  associated  costs.  The  resettlement \nplans  were  disclosed  in  local  language  to  affected  districts  and  villages,  and  resettlement \ninformation  booklets  were  distributed  to  the  affected  persons. 21  The  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement costs will be financed by WMG and the loan from the Agricultural Bank of China. \nOn the impact on indigenous peoples, the project is classified as category C. \n \n34. \nEnvironmental  aspects.  The  project  is  classified  category  A  in  ADB\u2019s  environmental \ncategorization. Four environmental impact assessments (EIAs) were prepared, one for each of \nthe three main structural components, together with the EIA for Sixin pumping station. Extensive \npublic consultation involving surveys, meetings with stakeholders, and focus group discussions \nwas  undertaken  during  the  preparation  of  each  EIA.  The  EIAs  are  based  on  national  laws, \nregulations, and standards applicable in the PRC. \n \nThe  summary  EIA  is  based  on  four  PRC  EIA  reports  prepared  by  an  accredited  local \n35. \nenvironmental research institute, and complies with the PRC\u2019s environmental policy, and ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002),  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003),  and  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009). \nthe  project  will  have  substantial  positive \nenvironmental  and  socioeconomic  benefits  resulting  from  (i)  proper  treatment  and  disposal \ntechnologies  and  facilities  for  sludge  from  the  existing  WWTPs  and  effectively  prevented \nsecondary pollution from the sludge; (ii) unblocked silted lakes and channels, enhanced water \ncirculation  and  self-purification,  restored  ecosystems,  and  the  biological  diversity  of  the  water \nbodies;  (iii)  increased  real  estate  values;  and  (iv)  reduced  greenhouse  gases  emission  by \nsludge  anaerobic  digestion  and  biogas  generation  and  use.  By \nfacilitating  economic \ndevelopment, the project will provide lasting benefits to assist in poverty reduction. The specific \nenvironmental  concerns  of  the  project  include  odor  and  secondary  pollution  from  the  WWTP \n                                                 \n20  A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 m2). \n21  Two full resettlement plans have been prepared and the involuntary resettlement assessment and measures is in \n\nIt  concludes \n\nthat \n\nAppendix 2. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nsludge and dredged sediments, and water quality deterioration of the Yangtze River and project \nlakes and channels. Such concerns have been fully addressed in the tables of potential impacts \nand  mitigation  measures  and  the  environmental  monitoring  program.  A  detailed  training \nprogram  for  capacity  building  has  been  developed  in  the  environmental  management  plan  to \nensure the borrower\u2019s institutional capacity in managing environmental impacts and risks. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe  project  has  no  unusual  technical  risks.  The  river  and  channel  rehabilitation \n36. \ncomponents  will  be  implemented  using  well-established  technologies  and  methods.  Sludge \ndrying  technology  is  relatively  new  in  the  PRC  but  well  proven  internationally,  with  several \ninternational equipment providers active in the PRC. The sludge component equipment will be \nthe \nprocured \nimplementing  agency  and  the  design  institute  in  equipment  specification,  commissioning,  and \noperational capacity building.
