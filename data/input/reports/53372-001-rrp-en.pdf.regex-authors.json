I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Kingdom of Cambodia for the Road Network Improvement Project (Phase 2).  \n \n2.  The project will improve about 48 kilometers (km) of national and provincial roads in \nKandal Province and Prey Veng Province of Cambodia, along the Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS) Southern Economic Corridor (SEC). The project will support the Ministry of Public Works \nand Transport (MPWT) with road asset management, by strengthening the axle load control \nsystem and helping to establish a sustainable road maintenance regime using performance-\nbased road maintenance contracts (PBRMCs). The project will also enhance awareness of road \nsafety and health in project communities by implementing a gender-responsive, community-\nbased road safety program, and carrying out an HIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness and \nprevention program (HTAP). The project will benefit poor rural residents in the project provinces \nby providing improved access to markets and economic opportunities through climate-resilient, \nsafe,  and  more  efficient  connections  to  the  border-crossing  point  between  Viet  Nam  and \nCambodia and other destinations along the SEC. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Macroeconomic  context  and  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Cambodia \ntransitioned to lower middle-income status in 2015 and aspires to attain upper middle-income \nstatus by 2030. Driven by garment exports and tourism, Cambodia\u2019s gross domestic product grew \nby an average of 7.8% per annum during 1998\u20132019, making it one of the fastest-growing \neconomies in the world. In 2020, the global shock triggered by the coronavirus disease (COVID-\n19) pandemic caused a sharp deceleration in Cambodia\u2019s main engines of growth\u2014tourism, \nmanufacturing  exports,  and  construction\u2014which  together  account  for  almost  40%  of  paid \nemployment. The economy contracted by 3.1% in 2020, the sharpest decline in the country\u2019s \nrecent history. The slow post pandemic recovery in global economic activities poses further risks \nto Cambodia\u2019s growth outlook.1 The government has prepared an economic recovery plan that \nseeks to return the economy to growth through continued industrial upgrading and further \ndeepening of Cambodia\u2019s integration into regional and global value chains.2 The project is \nexpected to assist Cambodia\u2019s post-COVID-19 economic recovery and job creation by improving \nthe efficiency of Cambodia\u2019s transport networks and market links. \n \n4.  Importance of the transport sector. The transport sector plays an important role in \npromoting  growth,  employment,  equity,  and  efficiency,  as  recognized  in  the  government\u2019s \nRectangular  Strategy  IV. 3  Development  of  the  transport  sector  to  improve  access  and \nconnectivity, both domestically and regionally, is also an integral part of the GMS initiative and \nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations objectives. Road transport is the principal mode for \nthe movement of goods and people both within Cambodia and between countries in the GMS. \nEspecially in rural areas, roads are critical to social and economic development, as they are the \n \n1  Cambodia\u2019s economy is projected to grow by 4.0% in 2021 and 5.5% in 2022. However, this outlook is threatened \nby the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2021. Asian Development \nOutlook. Manila. \n2  Government of Cambodia. 2020.

The GMS SEC comprises \nthe following four subcorridors, connecting major cities in Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam: \n(i) Central Subcorridor (SEC-1): Dawei\u2013Bangkok\u2013Phnom Penh\u2013Ho Chi Minh City\u2013Vung Tau; \n(ii) Northern  Subcorridor  (SEC-2):  Bangkok\u2013Siem  Reap\u2013Stung  Treng\u2013Pleiku\u2013Quy  Nhon; \n(iii) Southern  Coastal  Subcorridor  (SEC-3):  Bangkok\u2013Trat\u2013Kampot\u2013Ha  Tien\u2013Nam  Can;  and \n(iv) Intercorridor Link (SEC-4): Sihanoukville\u2013Phnom Penh\u2013Stung Treng\u2013Pakse\u2013Savannakhet. \nThe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) GMS Transport Sector Strategy 2030 aims to achieve a \nseamless  network  of  transport  services  that  connects  the  whole  subregion  and  prioritizes \nupgrading  the  GMS  SEC  in  Cambodia  in  particular.  The  GMS  SEC-1  connects  Bangkok \n(Thailand) with Ho Chi Minh City (Viet Nam) via Phnom Penh (Cambodia) and the areas along \nSEC-1 in Cambodia have considerable potential for growth in agriculture and fishery production \nand processing, highlighting the need for increased investment in transport services to provide \nenhanced linkages to markets. \n \n6.  Transport sector issues. The key problems for Cambodia\u2019s transport sector are (i) the \nlack of a clear sector policy framework and ineffective implementation of sector-related laws; \n(ii) inadequate infrastructure investments to meet national and regional needs; and (iii) insufficient \nconsideration of sustainability in the social, environmental, and \ufb01nancial aspects of transport \nsector management. Despite considerable investment in transport infrastructure, 95% of rural \nroads and 70% of provincial roads in Cambodia remain unpaved, and national roads have limited \ncapacity. Overloading and lack of maintenance financing are additional key issues in the road \nsubsector,  highlighting the  need  for  sustainable  road maintenance  and  overloading  control \nthrough  the  introduction  of  an  axle  load  control  mechanism  and  PBRMCs.  The  MPWT  is \nresponsible for managing national and provincial roads. \n \n7.  Government  master  plan  and  the  project  roads.  To  address  these  issues,  the \ngovernment prepared the Intermodal Transport Connectivity and Logistics System Master Plan, \nwhich  aims  to  transform  the  inadequate  transport  system  in  Cambodia  by  building \ncomprehensive,  fully  developed,  high-quality,  sustainable,  and  climate-change-resilient \ninfrastructure that can accommodate the anticipated population and employment growth by \n2030.4 The project roads, national road (NR) 23 and provincial road (PR) 312, located in Kandal \nProvince and Prey Veng Province, connect to the GMS SEC-1 and are included in the project list \nof the master plan. Kandal Province and Prey Veng Province are two evolving rural economic \ncenters that need to be better connected with the regional market. Kandal Province, with total \npopulation of 1,201,581, surrounds the capital Phnom Penh. Farming and fishing are the two main \nindustries of this province. Prey Veng Province, with total population of 1,057,720, is part of the \ngreen belt of Cambodia and contributes about 10% of the national rice crop and tends to have \nthe largest rice surplus. Currently, however, both roads have limited capacity with narrow road \nwidth, weak pavement and inadequate drainage structures. \n \n8.  Disaster and climate change impacts. Many provinces in Cambodia are vulnerable to \nflood-related disasters. The two project provinces, located within the Mekong River basin, have \npoor natural drainage and are often affected by floods. Specifically, Kandal Province is in the zone \nof influence of the Bassac River, a downstream branch of the Mekong River, while Prey Veng \nProvince is in a very flat geographical area. Cambodia\u2019s Climate Change Strategic Plan, 2014\u2013\n2024 recognizes that climate change is causing more frequent and severe flood events, with \n \n4  Government of Cambodia. 2019.

The \nproject areas were rated at a medium level of overall climate risk.5 \n \n9.  Axle load control. Although the MPWT has been trying to improve road maintenance, \nroads are still being damaged by overloaded trucks and require premature repair works. Under \nan earlier ADB-financed project, the MPWT established 27 weigh stations and formed the \nNational Axle Overloading Control Committee to oversee all axle load control activities.6 However, \nfurther assistance is needed for the MPWT to better control overloading. \n \n10.  Road safety issues. Although Cambodia\u2019s road traffic fatality rate declined to 1,761 in \n2018 from 2,226 in 2014, it is still high.7 The number of motorized vehicles in Cambodia doubled \nduring 2013\u20132016, with motorcycles making up more than 80% of the total.8 It is estimated that \nin 2018, the economic cost of road accidents was $350 million, which is more than 2% of \nCambodia\u2019s gross domestic product.9 Road crashes, mainly because of a lack of road safety \nawareness, affect the most active segments of the population: farmers, workers, and students. \n \n11.  Gender dimensions. About 51.5% of Cambodia\u2019s population of 16.4 million are women, \nand about 80.1% of the country\u2019s population lives in rural areas. As of September 2016, there \nwere 2,797 households headed by women in the project areas, which is about 16% of all \nhouseholds.10 Although improved roads will bring positive social impacts for women, the goal of \npromoting significant transformative changes in gender relations and creating jobs for women in \nthe  predominantly  male-dominated  road  construction  industry  is  still  challenging.  Further, \nimproved  connectivity  may  bring  unintended  social  risks  (e.g.,  increased  risk  of  HIV/AIDS \ntransmission, human trafficking, and road accidents). Appropriate measures, including a gender \naction plan (GAP) and programs to increase awareness of HIV/AIDS and an HTAP for both skilled \nand unskilled women in transport industries, are needed. \n \n12.  COVID-19 recovery through the project. The project roads will contribute to recovery \nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic by reducing transport time and costs; opening new economic and \nemployment opportunities through links to new markets and production centers; and increasing \nthe local population\u2019s access to health, education, and other social services. In the short term, the \nproject will create a significant number of construction and other ancillary jobs. Several micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises in the construction value chain will be supported. Over the \nmedium to long term, there is a strong link between improved transport and poverty reduction for \ninclusive growth. Better road access to local and regional markets will also increase opportunities \nfor women to participate in the labor market. \n \n13.  Alignment  with  strategic  framework.

Lessons learned. ADB assistance to Cambodia\u2019s transport sector during 1996\u20132019 \naccounts for about 18% of ADB\u2019s total assistance to the country. The proposed project builds on \nADB\u2019s ongoing and past experience with road and railway projects in Cambodia and other \ndeveloping member countries and incorporates the lessons in the project design by (i) providing \nall-weather access with road surfacing and embankment suitable for local conditions, (ii) ensuring \nproject implementation in a timely manner by managing environment and resettlement safeguard \nissues efficiently and in full compliance with ADB\u2019s policies, and (iii) enhancing road safety and \naxle load control to improve sustainability.13 \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: competitiveness and diversification of the \neconomy enhanced along the GMS SEC (footnote 4). The project will have the following outcome: \ntransport efficiency increased in national and provincial roads along the GMS SEC.14 \n \n16.  Output 1: National and provincial road sections improved with climate-resilient \ndesigns. The project will improve road sections NR23 (20 km) and PR312 (28 km), which are \nsubsections of the GMS SEC network, using cement-stabilized pavement and asphaltic concrete \nsurfacing  and  a  disaster-  and  climate-resilient  design.

The MPWT will aim to employ women for at least 30% of the labor \nfor road maintenance using labor contracting society contracts.15 \n \n17.  Output 2: Axle load control enhanced. The project will enhance axle load control on \nnational and provincial roads in line with the government strategy and the action plan for axle load \ncontrol developed under an ADB technical assistance project.16 Activities under this output will \ninclude provision of vehicles and mobile weighing and support equipment for four mobile teams \nunder the MPWT. The capacity of MPWT staff for management of axle load control will be \nimproved. \n \n18.  Output 3: Awareness of road safety and potential social problems strengthened. \nThe project will strengthen awareness of road safety and potential social problems (e.g., spread \nof HIV/AIDS and human trafficking) in the project provinces.17 Activities under this output will \ninclude a community-based road safety awareness program, and will include local administrators, \ncommunities, drivers, schools, women and children, and other road users. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n19.  The project is the second loan under ADB\u2019s Road Network Improvement Project in phases \nfor Cambodia, with the first loan for phase 1 under implementation and making satisfactory \nprogress.18 ADB has supported the government to develop the road network, improve axle load \ncontrol management, and adopt climate-resilient design for roads, with a close and successful \npartnership with the MPWT.19 The project will further build on this partnership by strengthening \nthe capacity of the MPWT in implementing civil works by improving contract management and \ncontinuing with PBRMCs, which provide (i) clear service-level standards and response times, \n(ii) appropriate risk distribution between the MPWT and contractors, and (iii) implementable \npenalty and incentive mechanisms. The project\u2019s support for the capacity building of the MPWT \nwill also include adding axle load control mobile teams with full equipment to control overloading \nand with ability to apply instant penalty at site (output 2). ADB, the World Bank, and bilateral \ndevelopment  partners  regularly  participate  in  the  Infrastructure  and  Regional  Integration \nTechnical Working Group meetings that began in 2006. ADB has been one of the government\u2019s \nlead partners in developing the road subsector and will continue to play an effective role as \ncatalyst and coordinator.

Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n20.  The project is estimated to cost $90 million (Table 2). The government has requested a \nconcessional loan of $82.05 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the \nproject.  The  government  will  provide  the  equivalent  of  $7.95 million  to  finance  mainly  the \nresettlement cost and interest during construction. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per \nyear thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nTable 2: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nBase Costb (A+B):   \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  The MPWT will be the executing agency, and the project management unit 3 (PMU) under \nthe MPWT will be the implementing agency. The PMU, headed by a full-time project director and \nstaffed with engineering, financial, administrative, and safeguard specialists, will be responsible \nfor the day-to-day management of the project. Implementation arrangements are summarized in \nTable 4 and described in detail in the PAM. \n \n23.  The MPWT and ADB have initiated advance actions to improve project readiness. The \ndetailed engineering design and draft bidding documents for the procurement of civil works have \nbeen prepared with ADB assistance.21 The project implementation consultants will be engaged \nthrough an international consulting firm to supervise all civil works, monitor safeguards, and \nsupport management. All procurement of goods and works will be undertaken in accordance with \nthe ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations \nfor ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2021\u2013December 2028 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2028 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2029 \nManagement \n   (i) Oversight body  Ministry of Economy and Finance \n   (ii) Executing agency  Ministry of Public Works and Transport \n  (iii) Key implementing agency  Project management unit 3, Ministry of Public Works and Transport \n   (iv) Implementation unit  Implementation unit Phnom Penh, 25 staff  \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding: International  2 works contracts  $67.06 million \nadvertisement \n  Open competitive bidding: National  1 goods contract  $0.28 million \nadvertisement; shopping \nConsulting services  Project implementation consultants,  87 international and 318  $3.93 million \nQuality- and cost-based selection  national person-months \nCommunity-based program consultant  54 national person- $0.22 million \n(road safety and social safeguards,  months \nconsultants qualification selection \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance contracting will be used for goods, civil works, and consulting services \nadvance contracting  packages. \n \n20 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 ADB. 2018.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  The project is technically viable. To keep the project roads open to users and traffic in all \nweather conditions, the design includes several climate change adaptation measures, including \nincreased embankment height with stabilized pavement above design flood levels, bioengineered \nembankment slope protection, use of a liquid soil catalyst, and adequate urban and rural drainage \nbased on predicted future rainfall.22  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n25.  The economic evaluation of the project was undertaken comparing life cycle road and user \ncosts with and without the project. The principal benefits considered in the analysis were transport \ncost savings in terms of vehicle operating costs, travel time savings of the existing and incremental \ntraffic, and environmental and road safety benefits. Economic analysis indicated that the project \nis economically viable, with an overall economic internal rate of return of 16.4%. NR23 has an \neconomic internal rate of return of 19.8% and PR312 12.7%, both above the acceptable rate of \nreturn of 9.0%. Sensitivity analysis indicated that, with a 15% increase in capital costs or a 15% \ndecrease in benefits, the overall investment remains economically viable. \n \n26.  The project is nonrevenue generating and will be operated and maintained by the MPWT \nwith annual central budget allocations. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n27.  The  MPWT  is  responsible  for maintenance  of  the  road  network  through  its  budget \nallocations. More than 80% of the national road network is in fair to good condition, indicating that \nthe road network maintenance regime is nearly sustainable. Financial sustainability analysis \nshowed  that  funding  for  road  maintenance  has  increased  substantially  since  2014  and  is \nanticipated to grow at a sustainable rate to meet the maintenance needs.23 Once the 5-year \nperformance-based maintenance period for the project roads provided under the project is over \nin 2028, the MPWT will assume responsibility for maintenance through its regular annual budget \nallocations. The estimated annual recurrent costs for routine maintenance of the project roads are \nestimated  at  $0.3  million  in  constant  prices,  about  0.2%  of  the  MPWT\u2019s  current  routine \nmaintenance  budget,  which  will  not  place  an  excessive  burden  on  the  MPWT.  Periodic \nmaintenance will be required in 2030 and 2037 at a combined estimated cost of $8.0 million in \nconstant prices. Since the project\u2019s financing plan provides for an asphalt concrete overlay during \n2028\u20132029, the MPWT's maintenance budget will not be required for the periodic maintenance \nfor the project roads in 2030.  \n \n22 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). If the recent \nincrease in annual budget allocations is maintained, the MPWT will be able to achieve 100% operation and \nmaintenance coverage of the overall road network by 2029. \n ", "9 \n  \nD.  Governance \n \n28.  Country context. Cambodia is still in the process of developing a robust system of checks \nand balances, but internationally comparable measures of government effectiveness show a \ncontinued improvement in performance.24 An anticorruption law was promulgated in April 2010 \nand provides a robust legal framework that criminalizes corrupt offences and guarantees the \nindependence of the national anticorruption unit. Increased audit coverage is also helping to \nensure greater transparency. The National Audit Authority and National Assembly regularly \ndiscuss  audit findings  and  monitor  follow-up  measures.  There  has  been  good  progress  in \nremoving the backlogs of public disclosure of audit reports by the National Audit Authority. ADB \nis supporting government-led efforts to strengthen public financial management through the \nStrengthening Public Financial Management Program.25 \n \n29.  Procurement. Strategic procurement planning was carried out to identify procurement \nrisks, develop mitigating measures, review procurement options, carry out market analysis, and \nagree on procurement arrangements. The procurement risk is rated low since the MPWT has an \nestablished PMU with experience in managing procurement under projects financed by ADB and \nthe  World  Bank.  The Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  participates  in  the  Bid  Evaluation \nCommittee and Procurement Review Committee for all foreign-funded procurement. Value for \nmoney will be achieved by (i) selecting an implementation and construction supervision consultant \nthrough advance action using the quality- and cost-based selection method, with 90% of the \nweight assigned to quality; and (ii) procuring the civil works package through open competitive \nbidding, considering the size and complexity of road sections. \n \n30.  Institutional capacity. The contract management risk is rated high. Although the MPWT \nhas been implementing ADB-financed projects and there has been good progress, it still depends \non international consultants for implementation support. Capacity development will continue \nunder the project with consultant support, initially through day-to-day assistance. \n \n31.  Financial  management.  The  premitigation  financial  management  risk  is  assessed \nmoderate, mainly because of weaknesses in the country\u2019s public financial management systems \nand improvements needed in the MPWT\u2019s internal control, audit, and information systems. The \nMPWT and the PMU have adequate experience in, and capacity for, implementing ADB-funded \nprojects and will manage project financial management arrangements, including implementing \nproject-specific financial management actions to mitigate risks, as detailed in the PAM. \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the MPWT.  The  specific  policy requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n33.  Poverty. In 2020, 17.8% of Cambodia\u2019s population lived below the national poverty line. \nThe Multidimensional Poverty Index rate 10% for Kandal Province and 18% for Prey Veng \n \n24 Cambodia\u2019s percentile rank on the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) Government Effectiveness index \nincreased from 18.2 in 2010 to 31.7 in 2019. https://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/  \n25 ADB. 2016.

For Kandal province, \n22.2% of its population is vulnerable to poverty and 5.7% live in severe poverty.27 Farming is the \nprimary source of livelihood for more than 60% of the households in the project areas. The project \nwill benefit 2.5 million people (of which 51.2% are women) in project provinces, accounting for \n16.4% of the total population of Cambodia. Greater mobility will contribute to long-term economic \ndevelopment and livelihoods in the project areas by providing better access to public services, \nfacilities, and markets. Road construction under the project will also provide job opportunities for \nlocal households, including poor people, women, and marginalized groups, especially during the \nfarming off-season. \n34. Gender.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  GAP,\nHIV/AIDS, and HTAP awareness programs were developed in collaboration with the MPWT. The\ngender analysis, focus group consultations, and drafts prepared in 2018 for two of the project\nareas formed the basis for the GAP. The HIV/AIDS awareness program and HTAP will ensure\nthat women and men benefit equally and are offered equal opportunities for participation, access\nto information, and employment during road construction and maintenance. The GAP aims to\nsupport key strategies and actions of the MPWT, including (i) offering employment opportunities\nwithin a gender-friendly work environment; (ii) increasing women's skills and bringing lasting\nbenefits that can be used after project completion to generate income; (iii) ensuring gender-\nsensitive  road  safety  community  outreach;  and  (iv)  protecting  women  from  gender-based\nviolence, human trafficking, and transmission of diseases such as HIV/AIDS.\n35. Safe working environment under COVID-19 conditions. Implementation of the project\nwill strictly follow government regulations on a safe working environment, adhering to medical\nregulations and scientific advice. Project parties will incorporate international construction best\npractices on social distancing, effective use of forced air ventilation systems, and wearing of\npersonal protective equipment.\nF. Safeguards\n36. In compliance with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard\ncategories are as follows.\n37. Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination (IEE) and environmental\nmanagement plan (EMP) covering NR23 and PR312 were prepared by the MPWT.28 The IEE\nwas disclosed on the ADB website in June 2021, and locally in the MPWT and provincial\ndepartments of public works and transport and offices of district authorities. Public consultations\nwere  carried  out  to  inform  project  stakeholders  of  the  project  design  and  environmental\nassessment  process,  which  will  continue  during  project  implementation.  The  project\nimplementation consultant will support the PMU in implementing and supervising the EMP.\nEnvironmental complaints will be handled through a grievance redress mechanism.\n38. The project alignments are along the existing NR23 and PR312 and pass through highly\nmodified habitats that can be broadly classified as (i) rural farmland with fields, roadside trees,\nponds and waterways, and few houses; and (ii) urban and peri-urban areas with houses close to\n26 United Nations Development Programme. 2019.

", "11 \nthe existing roads, and with plantations or gardens beyond. The IEE established that the project \nwould not have any adverse environmental impacts on the Bassac Marsh key biodiversity area \nlocated within 1 km of NR23. There is no protected or biodiversity area near PR312. As the \nimprovement and construction of the two roads will be mostly within existing rights of way, \npotential negative environmental impacts will be short term and site specific during construction \nactivities, and will include soil erosion, noise, dust, loss of roadside trees, and impeded access to \ncommunity facilities. The EMP details the mitigation and monitoring measures for identified \nimpacts, institutional arrangements, and budget for implementation. The EMP will be included in \nthe contract bidding documents. \n \n39.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). A total of 67,595 square meters of residential \nand agricultural land will be acquired with 2,005 affected households (8,719 people), of which 172 \nhouseholds (799 people) will experience major impacts and 582 households (2,564 people) are \npotentially vulnerable.29  Two resettlement plans have been prepared with the guidance of the \nGeneral Department of Resettlement, in accordance with government regulations and the ADB \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). Entitlements for the severely affected households and \nvulnerable affected households include compensation at replacement cost for those permanently \nlosing their land and an income restoration program for those losing their income because of land \nacquisition. The resettlement plans have been endorsed and posted on the ADB website.30 \nDuring preparation of the resettlement plans, 576 people were consulted, in addition to the house-\nto-house interviews performed during the preparation of the loss inventory.31 Project information \nwas disclosed to affected people. An updated project information booklet will be distributed before \nthe detailed measurement survey is undertaken during the update of the resettlement plans. A \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  established  to  facilitate  resolution  of  complaints. \nResettlement plans will be updated, cleared by ADB, and disclosed before contract awards. For \nresettlement plan implementation at the provincial level, provincial resettlement subcommittees \nwill coordinate with the General Department of Resettlement. Social safeguards capacity-building \nactivities will be carried out for the MPWT and for resettlement implementation agencies early in \nproject implementation. A qualified and experienced external monitoring organization will be \nengaged  to  provide  independent  verification  of  internal  monitoring  reports  and  assess  the \neffectiveness of resettlement plan implementation. \n \n40.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Much of the population in the project areas is Khmer \nand less than 10% is Cham or other minority groups. Fifty-eight Khmer Islam (Cham) ethnic \nminority households will be affected in NR23,32 and the involuntary resettlement impacts on the \nCham are addressed in the resettlement plan for NR23. The Cham were consulted through focus \ngroup discussions and key informant interviews to ensure that they participate in the project on \nan equal basis and receive culturally appropriate benefits. The social impact assessment shows \nthat the project will not affect the dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or culture of indigenous \npeoples, nor the territories or natural or cultural resources that indigenous peoples own, use, \noccupy, or claim as an ancestral domain or asset. Impacts on the Cham will be mitigated and \ncompensated for under the resettlement plan. The EMP also requires training to build construction \nworkers\u2019 awareness of Cham customs, social norms, and taboos. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n \n29 The total indicative resettlement cost for both the PR312 subproject and the NR23 subproject is $3.1 million. The \namount will be finalized during the final resettlement plan preparation. \n30 Both resettlement plans were disclosed on 4 May 2021. \n31 Wider attendance was not possible because of COVID-19 restrictions. \n32 Seventeen Cham ethnic minority households will experience major impacts because of physical displacement. \n ", "12   \n41.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.33 \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nDelay in finalizing the  ADB  will  provide  regular  guidance  to  the  MPWT,  including  through  a  safeguards \nresettlement plans  consultant supported by technical assistance,a on social safeguard procedures and \nbecause of weak  guidelines based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and closely monitor the \ncoordination among  finalization and implementation of the resettlement plans.
