THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $100,000,000 equivalent in tenge to Joint Stock Company KazTransGas (KTG) for the \nAdvanced Gas Metering Project in Kazakhstan. \n \n2.  The proposed loan will provide long-term local currency financing not readily available in \nthe Kazakhstan market to procure and install up to 1 million advanced smart gas meters across \nKazakhstan. The proposed project, being implemented under the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB)  One ADB modality,1 will help modernize the retail gas metering system using advanced \ntechnology. This will lead to improved operational efficiency and reduced losses and greenhouse \ngas emissions, with no additional cost to customers. The commercial financing to a state-owned \nenterprise supplements ADB\u2019s support to Kazakhstan\u2019s market-based reforms of the natural gas \nsector.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. Kazakhstan has significantly higher oil and gas reserves than \nmany other countries of the former Soviet Union. It has an estimated 30 billion barrels of proven \noil reserves (12th in the world) and 1 trillion cubic meters of proven natural gas reserves (26th in \nthe world).2 Kazakhstan has successfully harnessed its oil and gas resources to reduce poverty. \nThe share of the population below the national poverty line in Kazakhstan, based on income and \nminimum subsistence levels, dropped from more than 44.5% of the population in 2002 to 2.8% in \n2014 because of the development of the major Tengiz, Karachaganak, and Kashagan fields, \nsupported by investments from international oil companies.3 \n \n4.  In  addition  to  investments  in  upstream  oil  and  gas  production,  the  Government  of \nKazakhstan has developed a gas transportation and distribution network to diversify gas export \nroutes and meet domestic gas demand. In August 2007, it signed a 33-year intergovernmental \nagreement with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to develop two gas pipeline projects\u2014the \nAsia Gas Pipeline LLP and the Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP (BSGP)\u2014as 50:50 joint \nventures. The Asia Gas Pipeline LLP exports Turkmen and Uzbek gas through Kazakhstan to the \nPRC. The 1,143-kilometer (km) BSGP pipeline exports gas from western Kazakhstan to the PRC; \nand supplies gas to people in south, central, and east Kazakhstan who previously had limited \naccess to natural gas.   \n \n5.  The oil and gas sectors are managed by two SOEs: (i) Joint Stock Company National \nCompany KazMunayGas (KMG), 90.42% owned by Samruk-Kazyna Sovereign Wealth Fund and \n9.58%  by  the  National  Bank  of  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan,  is  responsible  for  upstream \ndevelopment and all production-sharing agreements for oil and gas; and (ii) KTG, a 100% \n \n1  The One ADB approach encourages collaboration between ADB\u2019s sovereign and nonsovereign operations, synergy \nin knowledge activities between operations and non-operations departments, and integrated solutions through \ncollaboration across sector and thematic groups. \n2  BP. 2019. BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2019: An Unsustainable Path. Press release. 11 June. \n3  Details on international oil companies operating in Kazakh oil and gas fields are in the Sector Overview (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 1); and World Bank. 2017. Stuck in Transition: Reform Experiences \nand Challenges Ahead in the Kazakhstan Power Sector. Washington, D.C. \n \n ", "2 \nsubsidiary of KMG, is the national operator for the midstream and downstream gas subsectors.4 \nThis hierarchy focused the domestic hydrocarbon industry on oil production and export. Natural \ngas activities were not structured as an industry in its own right, but rather as supplementary to \nthe oil industry. \n \n6.  In 2019, the government initiated market-based reforms of the natural gas sector. The \nreforms, supported by the ADB, intend to transform KTG into a stand-alone corporate legal entity \nwith  enhanced  sustainability  and  incentives  to  run  independently  and  efficiently,  including \nimplementing  its  capital  investment  program  (footnote  4). As  a  result,  in  March  2021,  the \ngovernment initiated the process of putting KTG under the direct ownership of Samruk-Kazyna.5 \nThe transformation, planned for completion in 2022, aims to improve the domestic energy mix, \ndevelop high-value industries, and help meet international environmental targets. \n \n7.  In  2013,  the  government  approved  the  Concept  for  Transition  of  the  Republic  of \nKazakhstan to Green Economy to address the country\u2019s high dependence on the fossil fuel \nindustry and the resulting carbon-intensive footprint, with one of the targets being to improve \nefficiency in gas consumption.6 This was followed by the adoption of the General Scheme of \nGasification of Kazakhstan for 2015\u20132030, which aims to gasify 13 regions across the country \nand gradually replace coal with gas for power generation.7 In addition, in 2017, the government \nadopted \u201cDigital Kazakhstan,\u201d a state program to be carried out from 2018 to 2022, with the \nobjective of raising living standards and facilitating economic activities with state-of-the-art digital \ntechnologies.8 Following the state strategy on gasification and digitalization, KTG adopted an \ninvestment program to modernize its metering, billing, and collection system. The project involves \nthe  application  of  advanced  technology  never  used  in  Kazakhstan  and  Central  Asia. \nSubsequently, in 2019, the company approached ADB for medium-term financing. \n \n8.  Gender context. Kazakhstan has developed policy and legal frameworks designed to \nadvance gender equality as a national goal, while the country\u2019s constitution recognizes gender \nequality. Despite this progress, the 2019 Human Development Report data show that women\u2019s \nlabor force participation rate in Kazakhstan is 62.7% compared with 75.5% for men. Legal \nconstraints contribute to gender gaps in the workplace, as women are forbidden from working in \n191 occupations and are required to retire 4 years earlier than men. In addition, notions of \ntraditional roles for women and men persist in Kazakhstan, with women being associated with the \nfamily and home more than the economic and political spheres (footnote 10). Women are \nunderrepresented in executive positions in almost all sectors of the economy, including the energy \nsector where they hold only 12.6% of such positions.9  \n \n \n4  Samruk-Kazyna and the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan are fully owned by the Government of \nKazakhstan. In August 2020, the government decided to put KTG under the direct ownership of Samruk-Kazyna to \nensure a higher degree of autonomy and independence of the gas sector from oil. This was supported by ADB. 2019. \nTechnical Assistance to the Republic of Kazakhstan for Kazakhstan Gas Sector Transformation Initiative Support. \nManila (TA 9816-KAZ). \n5  Decree of the Government of Kazakhstan No. 130 dated 11 March 2021 on Encumbrance of a Strategic Facility with \nthe Rights of the Third Party. \n6  Decree of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan No. 577 dated 30 May 2013 on the Concept of Transition of \nthe Republic of Kazakhstan to \u201cGreen Economy\u201d.  \n7  The gasification plan envisages gas demand in Kazakhstan increasing from 14 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year \nin 2018 to 21 bcm/year by 2028.

The project will finance the procurement and installation of up to 1 million \nadvanced smart gas meters in 10 regions (including two major cities) of Kazakhstan. (Confidential \ninformation deleted.) The absence of an advanced metering system makes it difficult to locate \ngas leakages in a timely manner, causing hazardous incidents and methane emissions.10  \n  \n10.  (Confidential information deleted.) As the next step, KTG plans to procure and install up \nto 1 million smart gas meters equipped with NB-IoT technology in every consumer legal entity \nand private house.  \n \n11.  The smart metering and billing system will enable customers to monitor gas consumption \nonline via mobile devices, leading to demand-side efficiency. It will also allow them to make instant \npayments  and  request  remote  reconnection  in  case  of  disconnection  because  of  delayed \npayments. (Confidential information deleted.) The remotely controlled and easily adjustable \nsystem will also allow KTG to adopt flexible payment terms for gas delivered to the homes of \nvulnerable households headed by women.11 \n \n12.  New smart meters will be able to adjust the gas supply volume in response to temperature \nchanges that affect gas density and pressure, and improve the accuracy of meter reading. \n(Confidential information deleted.) Online metering will also enable KTG to detect gas leakages \nfaster and arrange repairs, limiting methane emissions and improving operational safety. \n \n13.  Gender impact. The installation of smart gas meters is expected to decrease the time \nhouseholds spend on gas billing enquiries and payment, as it removes the need for regular visits \nto KTG offices. The key beneficiaries of this time saving would be women as they have primary \nresponsibility for such duties.12  \n \n14.  Borrower.  KTG,  established  in  2000  and  headquartered  in  Nur-Sultan,  is  an  SOE \nengaged in the transportation, distribution, storage, and sale of natural gas. KTG owns more than \n49,000 km of gas distribution networks and 19,000 km of gas transmission pipelines. KTG holds \nthe  national  gas  operator  status,  with  preemptive  rights  to  purchase  marketable  gas  from \nindependent domestic producers at a regulated price and sell it domestically at a regulated \npremium. It holds exclusive rights to operating the country\u2019s transmission and distribution gas \npipeline. KTG\u2019s market shares for each business segment are 92.5% for domestic gas sales, \n100.0% for gas imports, and 47.0% for gas exports.13 In 2019, KTG sold 15.1 billion cubic meters \n(bcm) of gas in the domestic market to energy and heat companies (5.8 bcm), industry (4.4 bcm), \nresidential houses and apartment blocks (4 bcm), and other consumers (0.9 bcm).14 KTG\u2019s \nextensive pipeline network transports gas produced in Kazakhstan and other Central Asian \ncountries to consumers in the domestic market, the Russian Federation, and the PRC. KTG is \nrated BB by Standard & Poor\u2019s, Baa3 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, and BBB by Fitch Ratings. \n \n10 The main reasons for technical losses in Kazakhstan are corrosion and external interference. In 2018, technical \nlosses associated with accidents and operational defects were estimated at 1.2 million cubic meters. Methane is \nchemically stable and can persist in the atmosphere from a decade to centuries, contributing to long-term climate \nchange impacts. Countries that have ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change must \nreport \u201cfugitive methane emissions\u201d from natural gas transmission and distribution systems (e.g., methane emissions) \ncaused by leaks.  \n11 Vulnerable households will be allowed to make partial payments for the gas consumed, and cover the monthly bill \nwithin a 3-month period.  \n12 Ramboll UK Limited. 2020.

Apartments use gas only for cooking because heating \nand hot water are provided through centralized district heating, so gas consumption is significantly lower. \n \n ", "4 \nFor fiscal year (FY) 2020, KTG reported consolidated revenues of $2,245 million; earnings before \ninterest, taxes, and depreciation of $285 million; and net profit of $633 million. As of 31 December \n2020, KTG\u2019s total assets were $5,484 million, total liabilities were $2,188 million, and total equity \nwas $3,296 million. \n \n15.  Guarantor. Joint Stock Company Intergas Central Asia (ICA) is wholly owned by KTG \nand will provide an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the loan. ICA is the national \noperator for gas pipeline transmission. ICA\u2019s main activities are gas transportation, services for \nunderground gas storage, and operation and maintenance of gas pipelines and distribution \nnetworks. For FY2020, ICA reported revenues of $459 million; earnings before interest, taxes, \nand depreciation of $240 million; and net profit of $135 million. As of 31 December 2020, ICA\u2019s \ntotal assets were $2,188 million, total liabilities were $589 million, and total equity was $1,599 \nmillion. \n  \n16.  COVID-19 impact. The government declared a state of emergency in March 2020 and \nsubsequently imposed a lockdown. KTG has however been allowed to operate at full capacity as \na strategically important company. (Confidential information deleted.) Therefore, the impact of the \nCOVID-19  pandemic  on  KTG\u2019s  financial  and  operational  performance,  and  project \nimplementation has been limited. \n \n17.

The  project  is  aligned  with  following  impacts:  well-being  of  the  population \nincreased  and  quality  of  the  environment  improved,  reducing  environmental  footprint  and \nincreasing energy security (footnote 6). \n \n19.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: environmental sustainability and \noperating efficiency of downstream gas distribution sector improved.15 \n \n20.  Outputs. The project outputs will be (i) modern gas metering and billing system that \nbenefits vulnerable women deployed, and (ii) gender equality of the work environment advanced. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n21.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, in particular the following operational priorities: (i) addressing remaining \npoverty and reducing inequalities; (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality; (iii) tackling climate \nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; and \n(iv) making cities more livable.16 The project is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nKazakhstan, 2017\u20132021,17 focusing on nonsovereign public sector assistance to national holding \ncompanies and the reduction of emissions in the energy sector. \n \n22.

This project is the second nonsovereign transaction being jointly processed by ADB\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Operations Department (PSOD) and Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) \nin the energy sector under the One ADB modality. The project provides a strong opportunity for \nPSOD and CWRD to collaborate and leverage their respective areas of expertise. CWRD\u2019s policy \ndialogue and technical assistance projects in support of gas sector restructuring, combined with \nits strong relationship with the borrower, led to the project origination. CWRD also provided \nsupport on technical and safeguards due diligence. PSOD is mainly responsible for financial and \ncommercial due diligence. Since the financial assistance required for the project is substantial, \nPSOD intends to partially distribute the risk through risk transfer agreements with international \ninsurance companies. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n29.  The ADB assistance comprises of a senior corporate finance loan of up to $100 million \nequivalent in tenge, (Confidential information deleted.)  \n \n \n18 ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n19 ADB. Kazakhstan: Samruk-Energy Restructuring and Transformation Project. \n \n ", "6 \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n30.  The ADB assistance adds significant value as a catalyst for local currency financing. \nKazakhstan\u2019s local banks, while open to financing KTG, are unable to commit loans totaling large \namounts with the requested tenor. In contrast, international commercial lenders, which can lend \nlarger amounts, are unable to provide local currency loans. The ADB financing will also mobilize \ninternational commercial financing from insurers, which will participate in the transaction through \nrisk participation arrangements with ADB. \n \n31.  ADB will add value by ensuring the project adopts satisfactory environmental and social \n(E&S) safeguard standards prepared by ADB\u2019s technical assistance.20 The project will implement \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), thereby adopting internationally recognized E&S \nstandards, including (i) the development of a grievance redress mechanism, (ii) enhanced \nmeasures for meaningful consultation with affected stakeholders, and (iii) augmented monitoring \nof the contractors\u2019 E&S performance. ADB also adds value through  stipulating support for \nvulnerable households headed by women, an increase in certified trainings for women, and an \nincrease in the number of female managers at KTG. Lastly, the project supplements the efforts of \nADB\u2019s sovereign operations to improve the gas sector\u2019s sustainability through introduction of \nmarket-based  reforms  by  transforming  KTG  into  a  standalone  corporate  legal  entity  with \nenhanced governance and economic incentives to run independently and efficiently.  \n \nC.

ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment (category C), involuntary resettlement (category C), \nand indigenous peoples (category C).21 \n \n38.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential E&S impacts of the project \nand the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts in the \nsafeguard reports and plans. Following the requirements for general corporate finance projects, \na corporate audit of the company\u2019s current environmental, health and safety, and social policies \nand procedures against the objectives, principles, and requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement was conducted by a qualified and experienced external expert. This included a review \n \n20 ADB. Kazakhstan: Gas Sector Development in Kazakhstan. \n21 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n \n ", "7 \nof the smart gas metering subproject. The E&S measures and the institutional capacity and \ncommitment of KTG to manage the project\u2019s E&S impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n39.  Based on the audit, it was determined that the environmental, health and safety, and social \nrisks are generally well managed at the corporate level. KTG has developed and implemented a \nset of environmental, health and safety, and social policies, standards, and action plans under its \nintegrated  management  system.  The  review  of  the  subproject  found  that  no  involuntary \nresettlement impacts will be associated with this investment, and no activities will directly and/or \nindirectly affect the dignity, human rights, traditional sociocultural beliefs and practices, and \nlivelihood systems of distinct and vulnerable ethnic minority groups or indigenous peoples. While \nKTG does not anticipate any impacts on the number of contractual employees as a result of \nintroducing  smart  meter  technologies,  it  will  monitor  the  risk  of  unemployment  posed  to \ncontractual staff. If, as a last resort, project-related job losses become necessary, the contractor \nand KTG will develop a retrenchment plan for ADB\u2019s review before implementation.  \n \n40.  Effective gender mainstreaming. KTG has a code of business ethics that prohibits any \ndiscriminatory actions based on personal characteristics such as gender and that includes anti-\nsexual harassment provisions. (Confidential information deleted.) Following ADB\u2019s Policy on \nGender and Development (1998), KTG will incorporate measures to promote gender equality \nand/or women\u2019s empowerment in its business activities. Key features of the gender action plan \nare as follows: (i) the creation of a database of vulnerable households headed by woman during \nthe implementation of the new metering and billing system, (ii) the provision of flexible payment \nterms for gas delivered to vulnerable households headed by women, (iii) an increase in the \nnumber of women participants in certified trainings, and (iv) an increase in the number of women \nin management roles. KTG will submit periodic reports on the implementation of gender measures \nto ADB. \n \n41.  KTG will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy \n(2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor standards. The \nclient will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance with such laws, and \n(ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people will follow \nADB requirements. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n42.  KTG was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
