Environmental  implications  were  reviewed,  and  no \nadverse environmental impacts were identified. \n \nThe  Program  addresses \ninstitutional,  and \norganizational constraints to the effective and efficient functioning \nthe  sustainable  use  of  natural \nof  agricultural  activity  and \nresources.  The  Program  includes  specific  reform  measures  to \n(i) develop a sound policy framework and establish efficient sector \ninstitutions,  (ii) introduce  management  systems  for  sustainable \nuse of natural resources, (iii) formulate sound programs for sector \ninvestment,  (iv) improve the efficiency of sector support services, \n(v) improve  the  efficiency  of  agricultural  commodity  markets,  and \n(vi) restructure state-owned enterprises (SOEs). \n \nThe  agriculture  and  natural  resource  management  sector  has \nsuffered from varying degrees of depredation for nearly 25 years. \nA  combination  of  war,  civil  conflict,  and  enforced  neglect  have \ncombined  to  leave  a  legacy  of  degraded  natural  resources, \nespecially  of  forests  and  rangeland;  damaged  infrastructure;  and \nfragmented \nnongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) and United Nations agencies have worked \neffectively with rural communities throughout this period and have \nhad  positive  impacts  at  the  local  level,  the  severe  drought  in \n1999\u20132001  has  worsened  the  degradation.  Further,  although \ncereal  production  rebounded  dramatically  with  the  improved \nweather  in  2002\u20132003,  crop  yields  are  still  very  low  and  overall \nperformance of the sector remains well below its potential. \n \nThe main task of sector recovery is to improve sector performance \nwhile  rebuilding  its  resilience  through  infrastructure  investment \nand adoption of technologies that reduce vulnerability to drought. \nThe  process  of  recovery  has  indeed  begun,  but  needs  to  be \nbroadened and institutionalized to ensure that it is sustained and \nthat deeper inroads toward rural poverty reduction are achieved. A \nbalance  between  sustainable  natural  resource  use  and  meeting \nthe needs of a very poor and rapidly growing population will also \nneed to be struck if the sector recovery process is to be sustained. \nAs the economy remains overwhelmingly agricultural, the pace of \nrecovery  in  the  sector  will  largely  determine  the  overall  rate  of \neconomic recovery. \n \nThe     Asian   Development   Bank   (ADB) has   worked closely  \nwith     the     Government    and    other  development partners  to \n\ninstitutions.  While \n\nsector \n\n\fthrough  support \n\ndefine  the  required  policy  and  institutional  reforms  under  the \nProgram.  The  concessional  loan  funds  will  help  to  meet  the \nadjustment  costs  associated  with  these  reforms.  The  technical \nassistance (TA) piggybacked to the loan, ADB\u2019s ongoing technical \nassistance cluster (TAC), and other TA for Afghanistan will further \nsupport the reform process. \n \nThe  program  goal  is  to  promote  agricultural  growth  and  poverty \nfor  market-based  policy  reforms, \nreduction \nformulation  of  public  infrastructure  investment  programs,  and \ninstitutional  reform  and  organizational  capacity  building.  The \nprogram purpose is to enhance opportunities for sector revival by \naddressing  key  policy,  institutional  and  organizational  constraints \nto  the  efficient  and  effective  functioning  of  agriculture  and  the \nsustainable  use  of  natural  resources.  The  Program  therefore \nsupports the national objective of household food security and of \nending Afghanistan\u2019s dependence on food aid, and will accelerate \nthe recovery of the broader national economy. \n \nThe  adjustment  and  other  costs  of  the  policy  and  institutional \nreforms  addressed  by  the  program  loan  are  estimated  to  be  at \nleast $94 million. The loan proceeds will be used in part to finance \nsome  of  these  adjustment  costs.  Other  funding  agency  sources \nhave also been identified to finance a portion of the costs. Further, \nmany of the adjustment costs will only arise over the longer term \nand  it  is  expected  that  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  capacity  will \nstrengthen  over  time  to  enable  it  to  meet  the  remaining  financial \ncommitments  without  any  difficulty.  There  is  no  investment \ncomponent under the Program. \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  equivalent  to  $55 million \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Asian  Development  Fund  resources  to  support  the \nproposed  Program,  as  indicated  in  the  attached  development \npolicy  letter.  The  loan  will  be  released  in  two  installments  upon \nsatisfactory  compliance  with  agreed-upon  conditions.  The  first \ntranche of $30 million equivalent will be made available upon loan \neffectiveness.  The  second  tranche  of  $25 million  equivalent  is \nexpected  to  be  made  available  about  12  months  later  upon \nsatisfactory  compliance  with  agreed-upon  conditions,  as  well  as \ncontinued compliance with all previous tranche conditions. \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of Special Drawing Rights 37,581,000 will be provided from \nADB\u2019s  Asian  Development  Fund  to  support  the  Program.  The \nprogram loan will have a repayment period of 40 years, including \na grace period of 10 years, and carry an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum. In addition, the interest charge during the grace period will \nbe capitalized and charged to the loan account. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nii\n\n \n\n \nObjectives \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAllocation \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n\n \nEstimated Program \nCompletion Date \n \nLoan Closing Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niii \n\nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign \nexchange costs of items produced and procured in ADB member \ncountries  (except  items  specified  in  the  negative  list  and  imports  \nfinanced  by  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources).  The  Government \nwill  certify  that  the  volume  of  imports  exceeds  the  amount  of \nADB\u2019s  projected  disbursements  under  the  loan  for  the  given \nperiod.  Counterpart  funds  generated  by  the  loan  will  be  used  by \nthe Government to meet program expenditures and related costs \nof  reforms.  No  relending  is  planned  under  the  program.  ADB  will \nretain the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify \nthe  accuracy  of  the  Government\u2019s  certification.  To  facilitate  the \ntimely  release  of  funds  to  meet  adjustment  costs,  the  loan \nproceeds  may  be  used  to  finance  eligible  imports  incurred  within \n180 days before the date of loan effectiveness. \n \nThe program loan will be disbursed within a period of 18 months, \nbeginning from the date of loan effectiveness. \n \n30 September 2005. \n\n \n30 April 2014. \n \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency (EA) \nand  will  be  responsible  for  disbursing  the  loan  proceeds  and \nmaintaining  records.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Animal \nHusbandry  (MAAH),  Ministry  of  Irrigation,  Water  Resources  and \nEnvironment  (MIWRE),  Ministry  of  Rural  Rehabilitation  and \nDevelopment (MRRD), Ministry of Light Industries and Foodstuffs \n(MLIFS),  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  Da  Afghanistan  Bank \n(DAB),  and \nthe  Administrative  Reforms  and  Civil  Service \nCommission (ARCSC) will be implementing agencies (IAs). Each \nIA  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  relevant  policy  and \ninstitutional  reforms  in  its  sector.  A  national  steering  committee \nwill  be  formed,  chaired  by  the  Minister  of  Finance  or  his \nrepresentative, to coordinate policy decisions that may need to be \ntaken to pursue reforms under the Program. \n \nMinistry of Finance. \n \nNo consulting services will be directly provided under the loan, but \nTA will be attached to the Program to help monitor implementation \nand  support  compliance  with  the  second  tranche  conditions. \nCapacity building in the areas covered under the Program will also \nbe  facilitated  by  linking  program  implementation  and  monitoring \nwith the consultants engaged under the TAC.  \n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nin \n\nreconstruction; \n\nsector  participation; \n\n(v) improved  credit  delivery \n\nThe  Program  will  promote  accelerated  agricultural  growth  and \npoverty  reduction  through  its  support  for  market-based  policy \nreforms, formulation of public infrastructure investment plans, and \ninstitutional  reform  and  organizational  capacity  building  in  key \npublic  ministries.  The  Program  will  also  build  capacity  within  the \nrelevant government ministries to efficiently manage Afghanistan\u2019s \nnatural  resources,  thus  enhancing  the  sustainability  of  the \ndevelopment  process.  Specific  beneficiaries  are  expected  to \ninclude  the  rural  poor,  small  and  marginal  farmers,  nomadic \npastoralists  and  other  livestock  herders,  returning  refugees, \ninternally displaced persons, and demobilized combatants. \n \nThe  following  benefits  can  therefore  directly  or  indirectly  be \nattributed to the different program components: (i) improved public \nsector  efficiency  and  effectiveness;  (ii) improved  efficiency  and \nmore  sustainable  use  of  natural  resources,  particularly  of  water; \n(iii) improved  resource  mobilization  from  domestic  sources  for \n(iv) improved  economic \nrehabilitation  and \nmanagement; \nrural  areas; \n(vi) deeper  and  more  efficient  agricultural  commodity  markets; \n(viii) enhanced \n(vii) increased  private \ninstitutional  efficiency  in  service  delivery;  (ix)  improved  fiscal \nstability; and (x) a more diversified agriculture production base. \n \nImplementation of the Program entails the following risks: \n \nGovernment  commitment  to  the  reform  process  could  weaken  in \nthe run up to the national elections later this year, and a change in \ngovernment in the wake of those elections might result in a policy \nshift.  While  these  risks  are  difficult  to  mitigate,  the  Government\u2019s \nability  to  push  through  a  new  constitution  and  its  performance  in \npursuing  difficult  reforms  under \nthe  Postconflict  Multisector \nProgram  Loan  (PMPL),  in  particular  the  recent  passage  of  the \nCentral  Bank  Law  and  Banking  Law, \nindicates  a  strong \ncommitment to pushing ahead with the structural reform agenda. \nIn  addition,  a  strong  consensus  has  emerged  in  the  country, \nincluding  civil  society  and  the  NGO  community,  on  the  need  for \nfar-reaching reforms in the agriculture sector \n \nThe  overall  political  and  security  situation  remains  a  concern. \nHowever,  increased  funding  has  been  mobilized  to  finance \nreforms  in  the  security  sector,  including  the  police,  and  the \nmandate  of  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO)-led \nInternational  Security  Assistance  Force \n(ISAF)  has  been \nexpanded to cover areas outside Kabul. These developments are \nexpected  to  result  in  an  improvement  in  the  security  situation \nthroughout the country. \n \nWeak institutional capacity may also delay implementation of the \nreform agenda. ADB\u2019s  TAC  for   capacity  building and  other  TA \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nv \n\nfinanced by ADB and development partners has been mobilized to \nhelp  build  capacity  in  the  relevant  government  agencies.  In \naddition,  the  reforms  initiated  under  the  Program  will  themselves \nhelp to build implementation capacity within the Government. \n \nThe  macroeconomic  and  budgetary  situation  may  worsen, \ncausing  a  diversion  of  funds  from  meeting  the  adjustment  and \nother costs associated with the Program\u2019s policy and institutional \nreforms. However, revenue mobilization has improved in the past \nyear as a result of customs reform and recent steps taken by the \nprovinces  to  remit  funds  to  the  central  Government,  and  it  is \nexpected  that  these  positive  trends  will  continue  with  assistance \nfrom the International Monetary Fund. \n \nA  TA  grant  in  the  amount  of  $1  million  will  be  provided  to  assist \nthe  Government  in  (i) program  coordination  and  monitoring, \n(ii) developing  a  comprehensive  land  policy  and  an  appropriate \ninstitutional \ntitling  and  administration, \nland \n(iii) assessing  the  human  resource  needs  of  the  core  sector \nministries,  (iv) assessing  institutional  options  to  meet  the  full \nspectrum  of  rural  credit  needs,  (v) improving  the  efficiency  of \nagricultural  commodity  markets,  and  (vi) developing  procedures \nfor  restructuring  and  divesting  SOEs.  All  procurement  under  the \nTA  grant  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  The  selection  and  engagement  of  consultants  will \nbe  done  by  ADB  through  a  firm  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants.

The  report  also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  for  Agriculture  Policy \nReform, and if the Board approves the propose loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\n \n2. \nA new opportunity for the peaceful development of Afghanistan emerged with the fall of \nthe  Taliban  regime  in  late  2001  and  the  subsequent  political  agreement  reached  between  the \nvarious Afghan factions in Bonn. An Afghan Interim Administration was appointed in the wake of \nthat  agreement  and  governed  the  country  until  an  Emergency  Loya  Jirga  (grand  council)  was \nconvened  in  June  2002,  which  chose  a  new  transitional  administration  headed  by  President \nHamid  Karzai  that  was  to  remain  in  office  for  2  years.  The  transitional  administration \n(Government) is charged with the task of preparing a new constitution and conducting free and \nfair  elections  to  establish  a  fully  representative  government.  A  new  constitution  enshrining  a \nstrong  presidential  system  of  government  was  approved  in  early  January  by  a  Constitutional \nLoya Jirga, paving the way for democratic national elections later this year.  \n \n3. \nThe  Government  has  from  the  outset  been  strongly  committed  to  achieving  financial \nstability  and  maintaining  fiscal  discipline  to  support  economic  reconstruction  and  recovery.  In \nparticular, the economy is to be based on liberal and open markets, led by private sector activity \nwith  minimal  state  intervention.  The  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  coordinate  and  manage  the \nreconstruction  process was  also strengthened  following  adoption  of  the  National Development \nFramework (NDF) in April 2002 (Appendix 1). The NDF focuses on three pillars of development: \n(i) security and human development, (ii) rebuilding physical infrastructure, and (iii) enabling the \ncreation of a viable private sector as the engine for sustainable and inclusive economic growth. \nFor  each  of  these  pillars,  broad  sectoral  programs  have  been  developed  and  individual \nconsultative  groups  (CGs)  established  to  provide  a  mechanism  to  identify  and  select  projects \nwithin the overall resource constraints, as well as to coordinate foreign aid flows.1 This has since \nbeen followed by the preparation of annual national development budgets (NDBs), which seek \nto translate the broad programs and priorities of the NDF into detailed and prioritized investment \nprograms to be funded through the formal budgetary process.  \n \nImpressive  progress  has  been  made  in  achieving  macroeconomic  stability,  and  the \n4. \neconomy  shows  strong  signs  of  recovery  (Appendix  2).  Real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP), \nexcluding  opium  production,  is  estimated  to  have  grown  by  almost  30%  in  2002/032  and  is \nexpected  to  expand  at  a  rate  of  about  20%  in  2003/04.  This  recovery  is  most  visible  in \nagriculture,  reflecting  the  end  of  a  prolonged  drought,  and  in  the  construction  and  services \nsectors,  where  rapid  expansion  is  being  driven  by  funding  agency  assistance.  Prices  have \nremained  broadly  stable  since  the  successful  completion  of  a  currency  conversion  in  early \nJanuary  2003,  reflecting  sound  monetary  and  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  ample  staple  food \nsupplies.  Average  inflation  for  2003  was  virtually  zero  and  exchange  rate  stability  has  been \n                                                 \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is the focal point for transport, agriculture and natural resource management, \nand environment. ADB is also a member of two other CGs covering energy, mining and telecommunications; and \npublic administration and economic management. ADB staff are actively engaged in the proceedings of the CGs. \n2  This corresponds to the Afghan solar year (SY) 1381, which ran from 21 March 2002 to 20 March 2003. The SY \n\n1382 runs from 21 March 2003 to 20 March 2004. \n\n\festablished  with  the  rate  fluctuating  between  AF48-50  per  dollar,  signaling  the  population\u2019s \nconfidence in the new currency. \n \n5. \nSignificant  progress  has  also  been  made  in  improving  fiscal  and  financial  sector \nmanagement. The biggest strides in regard to the former have come on the expenditure side, \nwhich has enabled the Government to resume providing basic public services to the population. \nWhile  fiscal  management  in  the  provinces  remains  problematic,  the  recent  streamlining  of \nprovincial accounts and their planned consolidation into the central accounts at Da Afghanistan \nBank  (DAB)  will  facilitate  more  effective  revenue  centralization.  These  efforts  have  already \nstarted  to  pay  off  and  significant  revenues  are  now  being  transferred  from  the  provinces.  A \nmajor step forward in the financial sector was the recent adoption of the new Central Bank Law \nand  Banking  Law.  This  paves  the  way  for  further  central  bank  modernization  and  the  entry  of \nnew  commercial  banks  into  Afghanistan.  The  new  Central  Bank  Law  in  particular  provides  a \nframework  for  an  independent,  yet  accountable,  monetary  policy  and  the  creation  of  a  sound \nfinancial  system.  Diagnostic  studies  have  been  carried  out  on  the  six  existing  commercial \nbanks,  which  had  virtually  ceased  to  function  in  recent  years,  and  strategies  for  reform  and \nrestructuring are under preparation for those that have qualified for a new banking license. \n \n6. \nNotwithstanding the strong economic recovery and recent progress in structural reform, \nthe remaining reform agenda and financial requirements for continued progress are vast. With a \nper  capita  GDP  (excluding  opium)  of  only  $180\u2013190,  one  of  the  lowest  levels  in  the  world, \nserious  inroads  into  poverty  reduction  or  even  attaining  the  income  levels  of  neighboring \ncountries will require strong economic growth for many years to come. Afghanistan will therefore \ncontinue to require substantial international assistance in the coming years to sustain recovery, \ngrowth, and poverty reduction. Although external assistance has been sizable, a comparison of \nper  capita  aid  levels  with  other  recent  post-conflict  countries  suggests  that  aid  flows  to \nAfghanistan up to this point have been relatively low. Moreover, financial support will have to be \noverwhelmingly  in  the  form  of  grants  or  highly  concessional  borrowing  in  order  to  ensure  that \nAfghanistan\u2019s external debt position is sustainable over the medium term.3  \n \n7. \nWhile  the  economy  should  continue  to  recover,  a  number  of  serious  risks  remain.  In \nparticular, the security situation remains very fragile. Poor security complicates macroeconomic \nmanagement  and  prevents  reconstruction  from  taking  hold  in  many  areas  outside  the  Kabul. \nThe reemergence of opium production is having a profound impact on the economy and there is \na risk that its pervasive corrupting influence could become entrenched. There is also a risk that \nthe  financial  support  of  international  donors,  which  has  been  so critical  to  the  recovery  so  far, \ncould weaken prematurely. Ultimately, the economic outlook will depend on the Government\u2019s \nability  to  maintain  political  as  well  as  macroeconomic  stability  and  to  adopt  strong  policy \nmeasures. In particular, sustainable growth over the medium term will require substantial private \ninvestment, particularly as this will increasingly need to take the place of official assistance. A \nsignificant increase in private investment will in turn require adequate security and stability, as \nwell  as  strong  policy  measures  to  create  an  environment  conducive  to  such  investment.  The \nlatter includes creating a market-oriented regulatory framework and a fair and functioning legal \nsystem, to firmly establish the rule of law and the security of property rights. \n\n                                                 \n3  Various analyses suggest that debt sustainability will be difficult to achieve without very generous relief of existing \nclaims. The bulk of these consist of claims of the former Soviet Union. These claims (nearly $10 billion equivalent), \nnow  from  the  Russian  Federation,  are  currently  under  dispute,  as  the  Government  does  not  recognize  them  as \nthey were largely accumulated during the period of Soviet intervention. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\n \nA. \n \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\n1. \n\nDescription of the Natural Resource Base \n\ninfrastructure;  and \n\nfragmented  sector \n\nrangeland;  damaged \n\n \n8. \nThe  agriculture  and  natural  resource  sector  has  suffered  from  varying  degrees  of \ndepredation for nearly 25 years (Appendix 3). A combination of war, civil conflict, and enforced \nneglect  have  combined  to  leave  a  legacy  of  degraded  natural  resources,  especially  of  forests \nand \ninstitutions.  While \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  United  Nations  (UN)  agencies  have  worked \neffectively  with  rural  communities  throughout  this  period  and  have  had  positive  impacts  at  the \nlocal level, the overall performance of the sector has been poor. The severe drought in 1999\u2013\n2001  has  worsened  the  degradation,  reducing  the  cultivated  rainfed  area  to  less  than  0.5 \nhectares (ha) per annum (compared with an arable area of about 4 million ha). Rainfed cereal \nproductivity  levels  were  very  low  during  the  recent  drought  years,  averaging  only  about  0.6 \nmetric tons (mt) per ha, and rainfed cereal production fell to about 10% of expected production \nin a normal rainfall year. \n \n9. \nAlthough population pressures are increasing, Afghanistan has the capacity to mobilize \nover 7.5 million ha of cultivated land, of which 60% could be irrigated and 20% double-cropped. \nThis  degree  of  land  and  water  use  amounts  to  about  0.4  ha  per  capita,  a  relatively  generous \nratio by regional standards. About 30% of the total cultivated land was irrigated in 1999, much of \nwhich was through community-based small and medium-sized irrigation (river valley) schemes. \nThe  effects  of  war,  drought,  and  neglect  of  these  systems  have  not  been  systematically \nassessed, but the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimated in \n1997  that  about  1.7 million  ha  required  rehabilitation,  and  another  0.7 million  ha  required \nimproved water management. In addition, Afghanistan has 29 million ha of rangeland for use by \nlivestock,  but  animal  numbers  have  fallen  to  about  half  the  level  of  a  decade  ago,  due  to  the \nyears of conflict and prolonged drought. \n \n10. \nForest  cover  is  currently  estimated  at  about  1.3 million  ha,  down  from  1.9 million  ha  in \n1996 and 2.2 million ha in the early 1980s. In recent years, forest cover has diminished, due to \ncommunity demands for fuelwood and illegal logging. Similarly, many orchards were cut down \nfor firewood during harsh winters or destroyed during fighting. It is estimated that forest offtake \nrates are currently exceeding annual regeneration rates, leaving a deficit of about 30,000 ha of \nforest per year. Afghanistan will have little forest and wildlife left in 15 years\u2019 time if deforestation \ncontinues  at  this  pace.  The  demand  for  fuelwood  by  communities  is  estimated  to  be  less \ndamaging  than  illegal  logging,  but  is  nevertheless  destructive.  Similarly,  recent  years  have \nwitnessed  the  cultivation  of  rangeland  as  communities  sought  ways  to  mitigate  the  effects  of \ndrought  and  population  pressure  in  some  areas.  The  widespread  degradation  of  forests  and \nrangeland has resulted in flooding, water scarcity, and severe soil degradation in many areas. \n \n\n2. \n\nRecent Trends and Performance \n\n \n11. \nAgriculture  production,  which  is  estimated  to  support  nearly  85%  of  the  country\u2019s \npopulation  and  account  for  over  50%  of  GDP,4  has  recovered  rapidly  over  the  past  two  years \n\n                                                 \n4  This estimate is based on data from the early 1990s. The share of agriculture in Afghanistan\u2019s GDP may well be \n\nlarger, given the level of destruction of the country\u2019s infrastructure and industrial base. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fwith the return of normal rainfall and improved availability of quality seeds, fertilizers and other \nagricultural inputs. The FAO and the World Food Program estimated that total cereal production \n(primarily  wheat)  was  up  by  nearly  80%  in  2002/03,  reaching  3.6 million  tons,  compared  to \nabout 2 million tons in the preceding year. With continued good precipitation, cereal production \nis  estimated  to  have  increased  by  another  50%  during  the  main  2003/04  cropping  season, \nreaching  5.4 million  tons,  broadly  the  level  Afghanistan  needs  to  achieve  aggregate  self-\nsufficiency in foodgrains.5 Contributing to this increase was the use of land that was left fallow \nduring the drought. However, by putting virtually all idle land back into production at the same \ntime, cereal production has likely reached its upper limit within the current production capacity. \nMany land plots will need to be left fallow in the coming year before they can be planted again, \nwhich may result in lower production levels in 2004/05. The production of fruits and vegetables, \nas  well  as  a  range  of  livestock-related  products  (dairy,  meat,  wool,  and  hides),  has  also \nincreased  over  the  past  two  years,  but  will  take  longer  to  reach  pre-conflict  levels  given  the \nsharp reduction in livestock herds and destruction of orchards. \n \n12.  With  the  recovery  in  agriculture  production,  poppies  have  also  re-emerged  as  a  major \ncash  crop.  Although  poppy  cultivation  was  negligible  in  2001  following  the  successful  ban \nintroduced  by  the  Taliban  during  the  previous  year,  production  in  2002  surged  to  over  3,500 \ntons  of  opium  or  75%  of  the  record  harvest  of  1999.  The  UN  Office  on  Drugs  and  Crime \n(UNODC)  estimates  that  opium  production  increased  further  to  nearly  4,000  tons  in  2003.  In \naddition,  the  number  of  provinces  where  poppy  is  grown  has  increased  from  18  out  of  32  in \n1999  to  28  presently.  It  is  noteworthy  that  production  in  nontraditional  growing  areas  now \nrepresents nearly one-quarter of total production and has expanded by over 300% since 2002. \nThe UNODC estimates that 264,000 families or roughly 7% of the population are now deriving a \ndirect  income  (estimated  at  about  $3,900  per  family,  or  three  times  the  national  average \nincome) from poppy cultivation.  \n \nB. \n \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nStrategic Considerations \n\n \n13. \nIn  1978,  Afghanistan\u2019s  population  of  14 million  was  self-sufficient  in  cereals  and  had  a \nflourishing  export  market  in  horticultural  products.  The  population  is  presently  estimated  at \nabout  20 million,  with  a  rural  population  of  around  16.5 million.  Over  the  past  20  years, \nagricultural technologies have advanced substantially, enabling agricultural systems globally to \nmore  than  keep  pace  with  population  increases.  On  this  basis,  it  is  not  surprising  that \nAfghanistan was able to so quickly regain aggregate self-sufficiency in cereals. While this is a \ndesirable near-term achievement, it is unlikely to be economically efficient over the longer term, \nas  maintaining  self-sufficiency  would  depend  on  investment  in  increasingly  high-cost  irrigation \nsystems  that  would  not  be  justified  by  the  economic  returns  from  cereal  production.  Given \napparent comparative advantages, a more prudent longer-term strategy might involve importing \nmuch of Afghanistan\u2019s staple food needs, while focusing on the production of high-value export \ncrops.  However,  such  shifts  in  production  would  only  be  realized  over  the  longer  term,  and \nwould need to be driven by farm-level decisions based on relative returns of alternative crops. \n \n14. \nresilience \n\nThe  main  task  of  sector  recovery  is  to  improve  sector  performance  while  rebuilding  its \nthat  reduce \ninvestment  and  adoption  of \n\ninfrastructure \n\ntechnologies \n\nthrough \n\n                                                 \n5  This does not  mean that Afghanistan  will not require food assistance. While sufficient grains may be  available in \nthe aggregate, not every Afghan will have access to it. Many Afghans will therefore remain dependent on food aid. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nvulnerability to drought. The process of recovery has indeed begun, but needs to be broadened \nand institutionalized to ensure that it is sustained and that deeper inroads toward rural poverty \nreduction are achieved. A balance between sustainable natural resource use and meeting the \nneeds  of  a  very  poor  and  rapidly  growing  population  will  also  need  to  be  struck  if  the  sector \nrecovery process is to be sustained. As the economy remains overwhelmingly agricultural, the \npace of recovery in the sector will be a key driver of overall economic growth. \n \n\n2. \n\nComprehensive Needs Assessment \n\n \n15. \nA multifunding agency mission led by ADB initiated a comprehensive needs assessment \n(CNA) for the agriculture and natural resource management sector in February 2002 following \nthe Tokyo Conference on Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan in January 2002.6 This laid \nthe  foundation  for  a  more  in-depth  needs  assessment  mission  in  April\u2013May  2002.  These \nmissions  consulted  extensively  with  the  concerned  government  ministries  and  worked  closely \nwith the Afghan Assistance Coordination Agency. The mission also consulted extensively with \nall major funding agencies, as well as key NGOs working in the sector, and undertook field visits \nto Bamiyan province, the Panchir valley, and the Sharmali plains. \n \n16. \nThe  terms  of  reference  of  the  CNA  focused  on  developing  a  series  of  subsector \ndevelopment programs split into two time frames, a short-term program to be completed within \n1\u20132  years,  and  a  medium-term  program  to  be  implemented  over  5  years.  The  subsector \ndevelopment  programs  in  turn  were  to  comprise  investment  activities,  plans  for  institutional \nreform and capacity building, and policy reforms. The assumption underlying the formulation of \nthese programs was one of a market-led economy with the Government pursuing prudent fiscal \nand monetary policies and a liberal trade regime. The CNA was also premised upon continued \npolitical stability and a return to normal climatic conditions. The vision for the sector that was to \nemerge  from  the  CNA  was  also  to  reflect  the  principles  laid  down  in  two  key  documents\u2014the \nJanuary 2002 speech of then Afghanistan Interim Administration Chairman Hamid Karzai at the \nTokyo Conference and the NDF. The key principles are as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  people  of  Afghanistan  must  own  and  implement  the  development  agenda, \nwithin a common strategic framework. \nThe private sector should be the principal instrument of economic growth, within \nan appropriate enabling policy framework. \nAll  sections  of  the  rural  population  should  participate  in  decision  making,  and  a \ncommunity-based approach should promote this participation. \nInvestment in human capital and maximum use of Afghan expertise is essential \nto the recovery process. \nInvestment  decisions  by  external  funding  agencies  must  sit  firmly  within  the \nsector framework and related budgetary norms. \n\n \n17. \nThe  findings  of  the  CNA  were  presented  in  a  comprehensive  final  report  in  June  2002 \nsetting  out  a  development  framework  for  the  sector,  comprising  subsector  strategies  and  an \nassessment  of  needs  over  the  two  time  frames.  Separate  sections  cover  institutional  and \ncapacity-building  needs,  the  policy  reform  agenda,  and  implementation  strategies.  The \ndevelopment framework detailed the need for a number of key policy reviews and preparatory \nwork toward developing a comprehensive policy reform agenda over a 2\u20133 year time frame. The \nframework has subsequently evolved following consultations with the Government and through \n\n                                                 \n6  This included, in addition to ADB, the FAO, World Bank, and United Nations Development Programme. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fthe work of the sector CG, and was updated as part of a major multisector \u201crecosting\u201d exercise \nthat identified the priority areas and external financing requirements for investment projects over \na  seven-year  time  frame.  The  details  of  this  latter  exercise  are  set  out  in  a  report  entitled \n\u201cSecuring Afghanistan\u2019s Future\u201d issued in January 2004. \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons Learned from Asian Development Bank Operations \n\n \n18. \nA  number  of  important  lessons  have  been  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  policy-based  lending \noperations  in  agriculture  that  are  relevant  to  reform  programs  for  agriculture  and  natural \nresource management in Afghanistan. These include recognition of the importance of: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nGovernment ownership of reforms. Experience has shown that sector reform \nprograms are more successful when they build upon and accelerate government-\ninitiated reform processes rather than seek to impose externally conceived policy \nagendas. \nPhasing difficult policy reforms. In view of the dislocations that policy change \ncan cause and the adverse short-term impact of reform on specific groups, it is \nsometimes  necessary  to  pursue  an  incremental  pace  of  reform.  This  may  be \naccomplished  through  a  succession  of  program  loans,  or  through  adoption  of  a \nlonger time frame for program implementation together with multiple tranching. \nFlexibility  in  applying  loan  conditionality.  Sector  development  plans  and \npolicies  need  to  be  adapted  and  modified  in  line  with  changing  circumstances. \nFlexibility  is  therefore  necessary  in  assessing  the  continued  relevance  and \nappropriate timing of loan conditions. \nContinued  policy  dialogue.  Regular  review  and  consultation  missions,  close \ninvolvement  of  resident missions,  and  ongoing  analysis  of  the  impacts  of  policy \nchanges through the provision of concurrent advisory TA have been shown to be \nessential ingredients of successful reform program implementation. \n\n \n19. \nA 2001 study by the Operations Evaluation Department found that program loans rated \nas  generally  successful  shared  three  common  characteristics.  First,  the  government  took  the \nmajor role in designing the program measures and in implementing them. Second, the programs \nwere  developed  at  a  specific  \u201cmacroeconomic  moment,\u201d  when  macroeconomic  vulnerability \ncreated not just a need for borrowing, but also an understanding of the need for reform. Third, \ndelays in meeting specific conditions generally reflected a more realistic time frame for program \nimplementation,  but  did  not  detract  from  the  direction  of  reform.  The  only  program  rated  as \nunsuccessful  also  contained  a  major  lesson,  namely  that  programs  designed  around  formal \nrules and conditionalities need to take account of informal policy reform mechanisms, and of the \nincentive structure for those expected to implement the reforms. \n \nA  number  of  other  important  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  initial  lending  and  nonlending \n20. \noperations  in  Afghanistan  are  also  relevant  in  this  context.  First,  the  strategic  focus  of  ADB \noperations has to be closely linked to the Government\u2019s own strategies and priorities. Second, \ncontinued  emphasis  has  to  be  given  to  capacity  building  and  planning,  program  design  and \nimplementation, administration, and financial management in light of the pervasive institutional \nweaknesses.  Third,  to  the  extent  possible,  external  funds  should  be  channeled  through  the \nformal budgetary process so that resources made available by the international community can \nbe  appropriately  accounted  for  and  linked  to  priority  government  programs.  Finally,  aid \ncoordination is extremely important for avoiding duplication and implementation delays.  \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\n4. \n\nAgriculture in Afghanistan \n\n \n \n\na. \n\nCrop and Livestock Production \n\nThe arable agricultural resource base of about 7.5 million ha is divided into rainfed and \n21. \nirrigated  land.  The  rainfed  area,  which  is  located  largely  in  the  northern  provinces  and \ndominated  by  cereal  production,  is  estimated  at  4 million  ha.  However,  the  area  actually \ncultivated  in  a  given  year  varies  considerably  depending  on  various  factors,  such  as \nprecipitation  and  the  area  left  fallow.  The  recent  succession  of  drought  years  reduced  the \ncultivated  rainfed  area  to  less  than 0.5 million  ha  per  annum,  before  increasing  significantly  in \nthe past 2 years as a result of favorable rains. Rainfed cereal productivity levels were very low \nduring  the  recent  drought  years,  averaging  only  about  0.6  tons  per  ha,  and  rainfed  cereal \nproduction  fell  to  about  10%  of  expected  production  in  a  normal  rainfall  year.  Recovery \nstrategies for these areas must be predicated on the assumption of highly variable rainfall and \nrisk  mitigation.  In  particular,  farmers  must  be  able  to  respond  quickly  and  in  a  cost-effective \nmanner to changes in weather conditions. \n \n22. \nConsiderable  potential  exists  for  productivity  improvements  even  allowing  for  the  low \nand variable rainfall regime. The International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas has \ndeveloped and promoted drought-tolerant varieties and cultural practices for cereals, legumes, \nand  forage  crops  that  could  double  current  yields  and  significantly  increase  returns.  With \nadoption of appropriate micro watershed management and micro water harvesting techniques, \nthere is thus potential for further yield increases. The potential to improve rainfed farming could \nplay an important role in the revival of the agriculture sector and could facilitate faster poverty \nreduction. In the longer term, the possibility that Afghanistan could produce 1.5\u20132.0 million mt of \ncereals  annually  from  its  rainfed  farming  areas  would  have  the  potential  to  transform  its \nagricultural  development.  Food  security  concerns  could  be  relegated  to  very  specific  marginal \nareas, and costly irrigation water could be used primarily for the production of horticultural and \nother  high-value  crops.  A  further  advantage  of  this  approach  is  that  it  is  based  on  the  careful \nmanagement  of  micro  watersheds,  which  means  that  communities  will  be  drawn  into  an \nintegrated  approach  to  natural  resource  use.  This  is  the  traditional  Afghan  approach  that  has \nlargely broken down over the past 25 years. \n \n23. \nLivestock activities, which have long been an integral part of traditional farming systems \nin  Afghanistan,  are  often  rural  households\u2019  only  source  of  cash  income.  However,  the \nproductivity  of  the  subsector  has  decreased  significantly  due  to  declining  feed  supplies  and \novergrazing,  and  to  the  effects  of  animal  diseases  that  are  not  being  adequately  treated.  In \naddition,  much  of  the  irrigated  land  that  formerly  supported  livestock  is  now  without  water. \nSubsector  improvement  has  also  been  constrained  by  traditional  user  rights  and  grazing \npractices  and  a  preoccupation  by  raisers  with  livestock  numbers  rather  than  productivity.  A \nnumber  of  activities  could  be  implemented  to  improve  livestock  productivity  and  restore  the \nsubsector  to  its  former  status,  including  increased  fodder  production,  artificial  insemination, \nvaccination  and  disease  control,  and  animal  health  and  improved  support  services.  These \nactivities would need to be supported within a broader community-based development program. \n \n\nb. \n\nNatural Resource Management \n\n24. \nBy  most  assessments,  Afghanistan\u2019s  natural  resource  base  has  been  severely \ndegraded.  The  extended  drought  is  commonly  cited  as  the  principal  cause,  together  with  the \nprotracted conflict. While the conflict has undoubtedly been a significant factor, the impact of the \ndrought should not necessarily result in a degraded environment. Afghanistan has a history of \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nc. \n\nSector Institutions \n\ndroughts of varying severity and will continue to experience such difficulties. Traditional coping \nand mitigation strategies have broken down under growing population pressures, the collapse of \nthe  rural  economy,  and  control  by  local  elites.  These  strategies  must  be  rebuilt  within  the \ncontext of a community development approach and effective natural resource management. In \nthe  future,  vulnerability  to  drought  must  be  significantly  reduced  by  incorporating  a  range  of \ntechnologies and by strengthening off-farm employment and income-generating activities. \n \n25. \nThe  relatively  low  and  variable  rainfall  regime  places  a  premium  on  the  efficient  and \nsustainable management of Afghanistan\u2019s scarce water resources. There is considerable scope \nat present to make water use planning and management more efficient. For example, only 15% \nof  runoff  contributes  to aquifer  recharge,  and  irrigation  system  efficiency  levels  are  only  about \n25% when a level of 40% could easily be achieved. There are many options to improve system \nefficiency,  including  transferring  operation  and  maintenance  as  well  as  management  to  water \nusers and making the river basin (or sub-basin) the basic unit for planning and management. In \naddition, there is scope to expand the irrigated area. The FAO has estimated long-term water \navailability  at  about  2,800  cubic  meters  per  head  per  year,  which  is  enough  water  to  irrigate \n4 million ha, a significant increase over the current command area of 2.6 million ha. \n \n \n \nThe  first  two  years  since  the  fall  of  the  Taliban  regime  have  seen  a  remarkable \n26. \nreestablishment of basic central government functions, reflecting the effort and commitment of \ngovernment  personnel  and  considerable  funding  agency  support.  Nonetheless,  the  three  core \nsector ministries\u2014Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (MAAH), Ministry of Irrigation, \nWater  Resources  and  Environment  (MIWRE),  and  Ministry  of  Rural  Rehabilitation  and \nDevelopment  (MRRD)\u2014presently  have  limited  capacity  to  provide  efficient  or  cost-effective \nsupport  services  for  agriculture  and  sustainable  natural  resource  management  in  the  more \ndecentralized institutional environment envisaged in the NDF. It is therefore necessary to review \nthe mandates of these ministries and to formulate a more holistic view of their role in promoting \nagricultural  development  and  sustainable  use  of  natural  resources.  In  addition,  the  current \ncomposition of the core sector ministries, their detailed functions and organizational structures, \nand their human resource base all need to be carefully reviewed against the new development \npriorities for the sector. \n \n27.  More  generally,  Afghanistan\u2019s  civil  service  was  seriously  degraded  as  a  result  of  the \nmany years of political upheaval and armed conflict. Some of the key challenges facing the civil \nservice  include:  (i) very  low  salary  levels;  (ii) pervasive  patronage;  (iii) lack  of  biographical \ninformation  on  the  estimated  250,000  strong  public  sector  cadre;  (iv) inappropriate  pay \narrangements, including discretionary salary top-ups; and (v) a dearth of managerial, technical, \nand administrative skills. In addition, there are structural and organizational problems within the \nGovernment  that  make  it  difficult  to  deliver  its  core  functions.  For  the  Government  to  deliver \nresults and to be held accountable to the people of Afghanistan, there is an urgent need to build \nself-confidence, capability, and capacity within the civil service. \n \nPublic  administration  reform  is  being  undertaken  under  the  strategic  framework  of  the \n28. \nPublic Administration Reform and Economic Management program7 as described in the March \n2003  NDB.  The  Administrative  Reforms  and  Civil  Service  Commission  (ARCSC)  is  the \n\n                                                 \n7  The  Public  Administration  Reform  and  Economic  Management  program  aims  to  create  an  effective  central \n\nGovernment that reestablishes national unity on the basis of strong institutions. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\n \n\nd. \n\nLand Ownership and Tenure \n\ninstitution  with  central  responsibility  for  directing  and  coordinating  the  public  administration \nreform  program.  The  immediate  priorities  of  the  public  administration  reform  program  are \ninformed  by  three  decrees  prepared  by  the  ARCSC  and  passed  recently  by  the  Government. \nThe  first  decree  is  concerned  with  the  functions  of  the  ARCSC;  the  second  decree  is  about \npriority  reform  and  restructuring  within  the  ministries  and  the  introduction  of  an  interim  pay \nscale;  and  the  third  decree  sets  out  the  framework  for  externally  funded  allowances  and \nsecondments.  Unless  implementation  takes  place  quickly  and  effectively,  there  is  a  significant \nrisk that the investments that have been made to improve basic services and create an enabling \nenvironment for peace and security will be unsustainable.8  \n \n \n \nAlthough  the  vast  majority  of  Afghans  depend  on  agriculture  for  their  livelihood,  a \n29. \nsignificant proportion of the rural population are either landless or farm plots too small to derive \nsubsistence.  A  large  part  of  the  rural  population  therefore  engages  in  agricultural  activity  as \nsharecroppers, laborers, or tenants. Another striking feature of land tenure in Afghanistan is the \nhigh degree of uncertainty in land ownership, primarily in sharecropping and the closely related \npractice  of  land  mortgaging.  This  involves  a  number  of  complex  relationships  in  which  it  is \ndifficult  to  distinguish  creditors/debtors  from  owners/sharecroppers,  or  to  identify  the  legal  or \naccepted right-holder over the property. Nevertheless, there is a long history of land ownership \nrecord-keeping in Afghanistan, dating back to land grants issued in the 1880s with documents \nrelating  to  land  transfer  according  to  customary,  religious/civil,  and  state  legal  precepts.  This \nhistorical tradition provides a basis on which a national land registry could be constructed. \n \nNo  clear  regime  for  managing  land  rights  exists  and  by  default  many  management \n30. \nfunctions have fallen to the courts, which also handle the bulk of land disputes. With instability \nand coercion by warlords over the past decade, land rights management and dispute resolution \nhave  lost  credibility  in  many  areas.  Most  rural  Afghans  regulate  their  land  ownership  relations \ncustomarily,  without  using  officials  or  courts.  Customary  management  offers  a  strong \nfoundation,  but  strongly  favors  wealthier  elites,  men,  and  dominant  ethnic  groups.  Land  rights \nare  also  governed  by  more  than  one  legal  regime,  including  customary  law,  civil  law,  Islamic \nlaw,  and  state  law.  While  important  differences  exist,  there  is  also  an  unusual  degree  of \ncommonality among these in their treatment of land rights. Nonetheless, a key challenge will be \nto develop a sound and widely accepted legal basis for land rights management. \n \n31.  While  policy  intentions  have  been  discernible  both  through  the  terms  of  state  law  and, \nmore  generally,  in  the  tenure-related  strategies  that  have  been  adopted  over  the  years,  no \nformal land policy has ever been proclaimed in Afghanistan. This gap has resulted in a deeply \nunequal and often unjust system of land-ownership relations among tribes, between agricultural \nand pastoral systems, and among feudally arranged segments of society. These problems have \nbeen  compounded  by  violence,  insecurity,  anarchy,  and  land  grabbing.  While  effective \nimplementation  might  still  be  years  away  given  the  security  situation  in  the  countryside,  it  is \nnevertheless  essential \nformulating  a  more  explicit  and \ncomprehensive strategy and policy to tackle land ownership and tenure issues. In devising such \na strategy and policy, due consideration must be given to equity and achieving a fair distribution \nof arable land, given the importance of farming to rural livelihoods and income generation. It will \n\nthe  Government  begin \n\nthat \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB is assisting in this regard through the TA for Support for Public Administration Reform Program, approved in \n\nDecember 2003 in the amount of $3.4 million. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\ne. \n\nSector Support Services \n\nalso  be  important  that  the  land  rights,  interests,  and  needs  of  rural  women  be  given  special \nattention in this process.  \n \n \n \n32. \nThe Agricultural Research and Technology Transfer System (ARTTS) in Afghanistan no \nlonger  effectively  functions  as  a  result  of  the  widespread  destruction  of  physical  infrastructure \nand loss of skilled human resources, and will therefore have to be rebuilt from the ground up. In \ndoing so, the ARTTS will need to be reoriented away from basic research to adaptive research \nand technology transfer directly related to agricultural development. Internationally, a wealth of \nnew technologies has been developed for dryland areas and the role of the new ARTTS system \nwill  be  to  test,  adapt,  and  disseminate  technologies  suitable  to  local  conditions.  Stronger \nextension  support  will  also  be  necessary  to  develop  horticultural  crops  in  irrigated  areas. \nInstitutional  and  policy  changes  will  be  required  to  support  enhanced  contributions  from \nresearch and technology transfer to agricultural development. The human resources base will in \nturn need to be reoriented and strengthened in line with this new orientation of the ARTTS.  \n \n33. \nThe  input  supply  and  delivery  system  needs  to  be  strengthened  across  the  board  for \nseeds, fertilizer, chemicals, and animal vaccines and medicines. In particular, seed production, \nmultiplication,  and  distribution  will  have  to  be  fully  commercialized  with  state-run  farms \nproducing and testing foundation seeds. Lessons can be drawn from the FAO\u2019s activities related \nto seed production and certification. Fertilizer production, procurement, and distribution should \nalso be left exclusively to the private sector, but subject to government regulatory mechanisms, \nwhich will need to be put in place. While the supply chain would be consolidated and improved \nby turning these functions over to the private sector, there is still a need for the Government to \nintroduce  input  certification  and  quality  assurance  systems,  and  to  continue  producing \nfoundation seeds. \n \n34.  While improved inputs are becoming more widely available, many farmers currently lack \nthe resources to purchase them, especially those who have been displaced by the conflict and \nare  now  returning  to  their  homes  or  have  suffered  from  the  prolonged  drought.  Unfortunately, \nwithout a functioning rural credit system, only those farmers who have access to the rural credit \nprograms  of  NGOs  or  to  informal  credit  sources  (family  members,  money  lenders,  or  hawala \ntraders) will be able to purchase the inputs they need. While several microfinance programs are \ncurrently  in  operation,  it  is  estimated  that  they  cover  only  around  10,000  clients  (representing \nless  than  1%  market  penetration),  though  their  scope  is  expanding  rapidly  under  the \nMicrofinance Investment and Support Facility for Afghanistan (MISFA) initiative. The Agriculture \nDevelopment Bank provided formal finance for farm inputs, machinery, irrigation improvement, \nand a range of agribusiness activities, but has been largely dormant for more than a decade. In \nthe  intervening  period,  there  has  been  a  significant  change  in  approach,  operating  modalities, \nand  international  best  practice  for  rural  financial  institutions.  Moreover,  the  Agriculture \nDevelopment Bank does not qualify for a banking license under the new banking legislation and, \non this basis, has been dissolved. While the remaining commercial banks will cover part of the \ngap that has been created, further assessment studies are necessary to identify viable options \nto meet the full spectrum of rural credit needs. \n \n \n \nAfghanistan faces significant challenges in developing its trade and investment regime. \n35. \nTwenty-five  years  of  civil  conflict  and  war  have  caused  the  country  to  become  isolated  from \ninternational  markets  and  foreign  investors.  In  the  early  1970s,  Afghanistan  was  the  world\u2019s \n\nTrade and Investment Regime \n\nf. \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nlargest  exporter  of  raisins  and  was  a  significant  exporter  of  other  high-value  agricultural \nproducts such as almonds, pistachios, animal products, and handicrafts (especially carpets). In \n1975,  Afghanistan\u2019s  domestic  exports  amounted  to  $226 million,  representing  13% of  GDP.  In \n2002, domestic exports (i.e., excluding opium and transit trade) had fallen to just $130 million, \nrepresenting less than 5% of GDP.  \n \n36. \nThe  Government  has  inherited  a  set  of  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures  that  tend  to \ninhibit  rather  than  encourage  trade  and  foreign  investment.  Businesses  must  comply  with \nonerous, costly, and arbitrary procedures that are often unclear to obtain trade and investment \nlicenses.  The  approach  of  government  and  quasi-government  departments  and  corporations \nemphasizes  control  and  regulation,  rather  than  promotion,  facilitation,  and  investment.  In \naddition  to  having  lost  contact  with  markets  and  customers  in  Europe  and  North  America, \nAfghanistan\u2019s trade and investment institutions have lost most of their skilled and trained people \nto  the  conflict  or  through  emigration.  Access  to  formal  trade  and  investment  finance  is  almost \nnonexistent,  while  basic  telecommunications  infrastructure  still  needs  to  be  installed  in  many \nareas of the country. \n \n37. \nPrivate  investment,  both  domestic  and  foreign,  is  essential  to  rebuilding  Afghanistan\u2019s \nagricultural export  capacity.  Efforts  aimed  at  export  development  must  focus  on  rebuilding  the \ncountry\u2019s  productive  capacity  by  stimulating  flows  of  capital  and  technology  and  facilitating \nmarket access. Afghanistan must therefore (i) reorient its trade and investment approach from \none of regulation and control to one of promotion and facilitation; (ii) reform the current licensing \nand regulatory regime pertaining to exports and investment; and (iii) build the human resources \nand skills needed for the relevant government agencies to support, facilitate, and promote trade \nand investment. A careful review of the entire trade, investment licensing, and regulatory regime \nis  therefore  necessary,  and  all  investment  and  trade  regulations  and  procedures  that  do  not \nserve  a  compelling  national  interest  related  to  public  health  and  safety,  environmental \nprotection, sustainable use of natural resources, or national security should be abolished. At the \nsame time, efforts must be made to improve quality assurance and certification systems so that \nagricultural produce from Afghanistan will meet international standards. \n \n \n \n38. \nThe restructuring\u2014through either partial/total divestiture, commercialization, or closure\u2014\nof the extensive network of state-owned enterprises (SOE) is a critical element of Afghanistan\u2019s \ntransformation to a market economy. Such a reform would eliminate the burden placed on the \nbudget to support these enterprises,9 restore a level playing field between these enterprises and \npotential  private  sector  competitors,  and  reduce  the  scope  for  corruption.  Preliminary  data \nsuggest that public enterprises, many of which are currently not operational, account for about \n70,000  employees.  A  number  of  these  are  in  agro-based  industries,  including  27  enterprises \nranging  from  textiles  to  meat  processing  under  the  Ministry  of  Light  Industries  and  Foodstuffs \n(MLIFS), the Improved Seed Enterprise and Fertilizer Trading Company under MAAH, and the \nHelmand  Valley  Construction  Company  under  MIWRE.10  Very  little  information  is  available  on \nthese enterprises, but few seem to be viable and should be closed or sold to private investors. \n\nState-Owned Enterprises \n\ng. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n9  About  $52 million  was  appropriated  in  the  2003/04  ordinary  budget  to  fund  SOE  operations,  primarily  to  cover \n\nsalary payments of moribund enterprises. \n\n10 The Helmand Valley Construction Company was heavily involved in water resource projects, particularly irrigation \n\ninfrastructure development in the southern part of the country.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fIndeed,  most  SOE  employees  are  being  paid  directly  out  of  the  ordinary  budget,  rather  than \nenterprise revenues.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nA. \n \n39. \nThe  program  goal  is  to  promote  agricultural  growth  and  poverty  reduction  through \nsupport  for  market-based  policy  reforms,  formulation  of  public  infrastructure  investment \nprograms, and institutional reform and organizational capacity building. The program purpose is \nto  enhance  opportunities  for  sector  revival  by  addressing  key  policy,  institutional,  and \norganizational  constraints  to  the  efficient  and  effective  functioning  of  agriculture  and  the \nsustainable use of natural resources. As such, the Program will support the national objective of \nending  Afghanistan\u2019s  dependence  on  food  aid  and  accelerating  the  recovery  of  the  broader \nnational economy. The program framework is in Appendix 4. \n \nThe  Program  supports  achievement  of  NDF  objectives  and  is  consistent  with  the \n40. \noperational  thrusts  of  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  for  Afghanistan  (2003\u2013\n2005).11  The  Program  includes  specific  reform  measures  to  (i) develop  a  sound  policy \nframework  and  establish  efficient  sector  institutions,  (ii) introduce  management  systems  for \nsustainable  use  of  natural  resources,  (iii) formulate  sound  programs  for  sector  investment, \n(iv) improve  the  efficiency  of  sector  support  services,  (v) improve  the  efficiency  of  agricultural \ncommodity  markets,  and  (vi) restructure  SOEs.  The  Program  will  also  promote  greater  market \nintegration  and  strengthen  intersectoral  linkages,  which  will  generate  new  employment \nopportunities for the rural landless, refugees, and ex-combatants. In addition, the Program will \nreinforce  the  pro-poor  benefits  of  the  Postconflict  Multisector  Program  Loan  (PMPL)  and  the \nEmergency  Infrastructure  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation  Project,  which  are  aimed  at \nimproving  governance  and  the  efficiency  of  the  energy,  transport,  and  financial  sectors,  and \nrehabilitating basic infrastructure, respectively. \n \n41. \nThe  proposed  Program  was  formulated  through  intensive  dialogue  with  the  concerned \ngovernment  ministries  and  the  active  participation  of  other  stakeholders  (e.g.,  key  NGOs)  and \ndevelopment partners, in a process that began in early 2002 with ADB\u2019s lead role in the CNA \nexercise. This dialogue was continued in the context of the consultative group for the sector and \nin the recently completed \u201crecosting\u201d exercise, which also helped to foster wide support of the \nproposed  Program  by  other  funding  agencies.  Given  the  starting  point  of  the  Program, \nexpectations  of  the  progress  that  can  be  achieved  during  the  next  18  months  will  need  to  be \nrealistic. In many reform areas, the Program seeks to initiate action by setting out a vision and \nway forward by defining strategies and action plans; in other areas, the Program seeks to carry \nforward  work  that  has  already  begun  and  where  the  objectives  are  more  ambitious.  The \nproposed  reform  measures  are  described  in  more  detail  below,  and  are  also  set  out  in  the \nattached development policy letter and policy matrix (Appendix 5). \n \n\n                                                 \n11 The CSPU was approved in June 2003 and takes into account the Government\u2019s request that all funding agencies \nfocus  assistance  on  three  sectors  to  minimize  overlap  and  duplication  of  effort  and  improve  the  efficiency  and \neffectiveness of their assistance. It was agreed in this context that the ADB would provide loan and TA assistance \nto the transport sector (i.e., roads and civil aviation), energy sector (i.e., power, petroleum, and gas), and natural \nresource  management  sector  (i.e.,  agriculture,  irrigation,  and  environment),  as  well  as  TA  assistance  for \ngovernance and finance.  \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\nThe adjustment costs of the policy, institutional, and organizational reforms agreed upon \n42. \nin the context of the Program are expected to be much larger than the loan amount (see paras. \n58-60).  It  is  expected  that  the  reform  activities  will  prompt  both  Government  and  the  private \nsector to invest in the targeted subsectors. It is also recognized that both the policy reforms and \ninstitutional reforms under the Program will have a distinctly developmental impact, and involve \nthe  dismantling  and  reform  of  existing  underperforming  or  moribund  institutions,  while  at  the \nsame time developing new institutional and organizational arrangements to guide future sector \ndevelopment. The incremental benefits that will be generated under the Program will therefore \ntake  time  to  materialize,  but  are  expected  to  eventually  offset  the  adjustment  and  other  costs \nassociated with program implementation. \n \nB. \n \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n1. \n\nSector Policy Framework and Institutions \n\n43. \nIn  order  to  develop  a  sound  policy  and  institutional  framework,  the  core  sector \nministries\u2014MAAH, MIWRE, and MRRD\u2014have forged a common vision for the development of \nthe  sector.  Accordingly,  a  key  action  under  this  component  has  involved  the  preparation  of  a \njoint agriculture and natural resource management strategy and policy framework outlining the \nkey priorities, strategies, and policies for reviving agricultural growth and promoting sustainable \nuse of natural resources. The framework is based on Pillar 2 of the NDF, and has drawn upon \nongoing  policy  and  strategy  work  in  the  sector,  particularly  the  technical  annex  on  natural \nresource  management  in  \u201cSecuring  Afghanistan\u2019s  Future.\u201d  The  framework  clarifies  the \nrespective roles of the public and private sector in the sector development process as well as \nthe specific functions and responsibilities to be carried out by each of the three ministries. The \nstrategy  and  policy  statement  will  be  followed  by  a  time-bound  action  plan  setting  out  key \nmilestones in the implementation of the sector framework. \n \nThe  Public  Administration  Reform  and  Economic  Management  program  in  the  NDB \n44.  \nissued  in  March  2003  provides  the  strategic  framework  for  public  administration  reform  in \nAfghanistan.  Included  in  this  agenda  is  the  restructuring  of  the  core  sector  ministries  so  that \nthey are better placed to deliver their core public function to provide agricultural support services \nand natural resource management. The three sector ministries have already obtained approval \nfrom the ARCSC of their stage 1 Priority Reforms and Restructuring (PRR) applications for key \ndepartments.  This  has  been  followed  by  preparation  of  time-bound  implementation  plans  that \nset out clearly their objectives, organization structure, staffing levels, lines of accountability, and \nrestructured functions in order to secure stage 2 approval of their PRR proposals.  \n \n45. \nThe  Program  seeks  to  build  on  the  institutional  reform  and  restructuring  of  the  core \nsector ministries in a number of other areas. MAAH, MIWRE, and MRRD will complete studies \nassessing  their  human  resources  training  needs,  including  in  their  field  offices,  and  develop \ntime-bound  action  plans  for  capacity  building  to  address  the  identified  needs.  In  order  to \nimprove  fiscal  management  and  transparency,  the  three  concerned  ministries  have  prepared \nand  submitted  recurrent  and  development  budgets  for  SY1383  and  will  work  to  ensure  that \nfuture  budget  submissions  are  in  line  with  their  reform  and  restructuring  objectives.  The \nProgram also seeks to make a beginning on strengthening the relevant ministries\u2019 field offices \nthrough  preparation  of  time-bound  action  plans  followed  by  their  implementation  in  selected \nareas.  Further,  the  Program  calls  upon  the  Government  to  allocate  the  necessary  budgetary \nresources to ensure effective operation of the sector ministries\u2019 field offices. Finally, ARCSC will \nexamine  the  possibility  of  consolidating  the  sector  ministries  and  reducing  the  number  of  their \n\n \n\n \n\n\fdepartments.  A  plan  in  this  regard  will  be  submitted  to  Cabinet  for  its  consideration  in  the \ncoming year. \n \n\n2. \n\nNatural Resource Management  \n\n \n46. \nBeyond the overarching policy framework and reform of sector institutions, activities will \nbe  undertaken  to  improve  natural  resource  management  and  planning  in  key  areas.  An \nimportant  area  of  focus  will  be  on  water  resources,  which  are  most  critical  to  the  revival  of \nagricultural productivity and growth. As such, developing a long-term strategy to manage water \nresources  and  reduce  vulnerability  to  drought  will  be  vital.  An  initial  activity  is  for  MIWRE  to \ncarry  forward  work  that  has  already  begun  on  a  comprehensive  water  resource  assessment, \nincluding  establishment  of  a  water  resource  database  and  hydrological  network,  which  will \nsupport  the  formulation  and  adoption  of  a  coherent  water  policy  and  subsequent  legislative \nreform.  By  the  end  of  the  program  period,  an  interim  water  policy  will  have  been  drafted  and \nendorsed by the Cabinet, which in turn will provide a basis for reforming the 1981 Water Law. In \nline with international best practice, studies have also been initiated on the development of river \nbasin  organizations,  which  are  expected  to  result  in  the  establishment  of  at  least  two  such \norganizations  on  a  pilot  basis  during  the  program  period.  MIWRE  has  also  agreed  to  adopt \ncommunity-based  operation  and  maintenance  as  well  as  system  management  as  a  guiding \nprinciple  in  formulating  and  implementing  its  irrigation  development  program.  Finally,  MIWRE \nwill prepare a strategy for groundwater development and management, which could serve as an \nimportant safeguard during times of drought. \n \n47. \nActions  will  also  be  taken  to  improve  management  of  livestock  and  forestry  and \nrangeland resources, and to create a legal framework for environmental protection and control. \nThe critical issues to be addressed in regard to livestock, which have been an integral part of \ntraditional farming systems for centuries, include decimation of herds by drought and disease. \nMAAH has compiled a livestock inventory and database as a first step toward the development \nof a resource planning and monitoring system. An assessment study that will provide the basis \nfor the formulation of a livestock development strategy to address the multifaceted issues facing \nthe subsector has also been initiated. Similarly, a forest and rangeland resource inventory and \nassessment  study  has  also  been  initiated,  which  will  provide  the  basis  for  developing  a \ncomprehensive  policy  on  forest  and  rangeland  management.  A  draft  policy  will  be  completed \nand  submitted  to  Cabinet  and  a  public  consultation  process  initiated  in  parallel  in  the  coming \nyear.  Finally,  ongoing  work  to  develop  environmental  protection  legislation  will  be  carried \nforward  under  the  Program.  In  this  connection,  MIWRE  has  prepared  an  initial  draft  of  an \nEnvironmental Protection Act (EPA) that is expected to be finalized in the coming months. The \ndraft legislation will then be submitted to Cabinet for its approval before year end. \n \n48.  Work will also be initiated under the Program to develop a comprehensive national land \npolicy  and  titling  system  through  which  land-use  efficiency  and  equity  will  be  improved.  The \nGovernment has expressed its commitment to creating a policy and institutional framework for \nland  administration  that  is  fair,  efficient,  and  sustainable.  As  such,  the  system  will  seek  to \n(i) increase  tenure  security  for  farmers  and  other  landholders,  (ii) facilitate  efficient  land \ntransactions  and  administration,  and  (iii) provide  farmers  and  other  landholders  with  greater \ncontrol over land management through a full range of market choices. To this end, a high-level \ncommission  has  been  appointed  that  is  initiating  work  toward  formulation  of  a  comprehensive \nland  policy  that  seeks  to  encourage  private  investment  and  protects  the  rights  of  the  poor.  A \ndraft  policy  will  be  submitted  to  the  Cabinet  and  a  public  consultation  process  initiated  on  the \npolicy  by  the  end  of  the  program  period.  An  interministerial  working  group  comprising  the  key \ngovernment  agencies  has  also  initiated  studies  on  the  institutional  framework  for  a  land  titling \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\nsystem and the requirements for a land database. This will be followed by the development of \nappropriate strategies and time-bound action plans. \n \n\n3. \n\nSector Investment Program \n\n \n49. \nThe recently completed \u201crecosting\u201d exercise estimated that $800 million will be required \nfor  the  agriculture  and  natural  resource  management  sector  over  the  next  three  years  and \nanother  $1.5  billion  during  the  ensuing  four  years  (2007-2010).  In  order  to  achieve  these \nobjectives, the Government will have to strengthen the process for preparing sector investment \nprograms.  Efforts  under  the  Program  are  focused  in  particular  on  the  water  resource  sector, \nupon which future increases in agricultural productivity will primarily depend. The outputs of the \nirrigation  system  inventory  and  ongoing  comprehensive  water  resource  assessment  will  be \ncritical  inputs  to  the  process  of  identifying  economically  viable  irrigation  projects.  Particular \nattention  will  be  paid  to  developing  programs  for  rehabilitation  of  traditional  medium  and  large \nirrigation schemes. MIWRE is developing selection criteria that reflect land ownership and titling \nconsiderations as well as an equitable distribution of benefits along gender lines. MIWRE is also \ndeveloping screening procedures to ensure that the investment program is consistent with the \nenvironmental and social safeguard policies of the multilateral financial institutions involved.12 It \nhas  also  been  agreed  that  MIWRE  will  develop  procedures  for  the  transfer  of  ownership  and \nmanagement of irrigation facilities to water users. \n \n50. \nThe future of agriculture in Afghanistan depends on enterprise diversification and greater \ncommercialization. This will require the promotion of high-value crops and livestock enterprises, \nfor  which  adoption  will  need  effective  regulatory  frameworks,  efficient  marketing  systems,  and \nvery  active  participation  of  the  private  sector.  This  is  important  not  only  to  raise  farm  incomes \nand reduce rural poverty, but also to provide an important alternative to the resurgence of opium \nproduction.  While  enforcement  efforts  will  have  to  become  more  effective,  efforts  to  identify \ninvestment opportunities in high-value cash crops and agro-based industries as alternatives to \npoppy  cultivation  must  also  be  stepped  up.  Against  this  background,  MAAH,  MLIFS,  and  the \nMinistry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  are  conducting  studies  on  the  options  available  to  facilitate \ngreater  commercialization  of  agriculture,  particularly  through  the  development  of  high-value \nhorticultural  crops.  This  includes  reviews  of  the  enabling  environment  for  private  sector \nparticipation  in  agricultural  activities  as  well  as  agronomic  and  financial  assessments  of \npromising  alternative  crops.  Strategies  and  time-bound  action  plans  to  increase  private  sector \ninvestment and develop livelihood alternatives to poppy cultivation will be developed based on \nthe outputs from these studies. \n \n\n4. \n\nSector Support Services \n\n \n51. \nThe  national  ARTTS  is  largely  nonfunctional  after  two  decades  of  civil  conflict  and  the \npresent  institutional  structure  is  not  well  suited  to  future  sector  needs  and  priorities.  While \nAfghan  farmers  are  generally  aware  of  the  benefits  of  modern  agro-inputs,  the  present  input \ndelivery  system  lacks  effective  quality  assurance  and  certification  systems,  as  well  as  a \nregulatory framework to ensure delivery of quality agricultural inputs. Effective quality assurance \nand  certification  systems  are  also  lacking  on  the  outputs  side,  but  must  be  developed  if \nagricultural exports from Afghanistan are to gain entry to overseas markets. To address these \n\n                                                 \n12 Assistance is being provided in this regard by advisors engaged under the Technical Assistance Cluster (TAC) to \nthe Republic of Afghanistan for Capacity Building and Reconstruction and Development, approved in May 2002 in \nthe amount of $14.5 million. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fconstraints, MAAH is carrying out studies on input and output certification and quality assurance \nsystems,  the  institutional  requirements  for  a  regulatory  framework  for  agricultural  inputs  and \noutputs,  and \nfor  establishing  an  efficient  and  cost-effective  ARTTS. \nRecommendations and time-bound implementation plans will be developed based on the results \nof these studies. MAAH has also initiated preparation of a modern seed law, and will develop a \nstrategy and time-bound action plan for establishing a national seed bank in order to preserve \nthe indigenous gene pool. \n\nthe  options \n\n \nDeveloping  a  viable  and  effective  rural  financial  system  is  also  crucial  to  the  revival  of \n52. \nagricultural growth. Access to short-term finance in particular will be key if farmers are to afford \nquality  seeds  and  fertilizer.  Currently,  the  only  financial  services  being  provided  in  rural  areas \nare  through  moneylenders,  hawala  traders,  and  various  microcredit  schemes  launched  by \nNGOs and under the MISFA initiative. These presently have limited coverage and do not meet \nthe full spectrum of rural credit needs. The Program will seek to identify viable options to fill this \ninstitutional  gap  through  a  rural  finance  assessment  to  meet  the  full  spectrum  of  rural  credit \nneeds.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  in  association  with  DAB  and  MRRD,  have  initiated \nthe \nassessment  studies,  and  will  develop \nrecommendations that emerge from the studies. Gender-specific constraints to accessing credit \nwill also be addressed in developing these plans.   \n \n\ntime-bound  action  plans \n\nimplement \n\nto \n\n5. \n\nAgricultural Commodity Markets  \n\nto  standard \n\nthose  related \n\ninputs),  except \n\n \n53.   Efficient  agricultural  commodity  markets  are  another  essential  precondition  for  the \ndevelopment  of  a  competitive,  export-oriented  agricultural  sector.  The  Government  has \nindicated its firm commitment under the Program to removing all impediments that inhibit market \nefficiency, particularly restrictions on internal and external movement of agricultural commodities \n(including \ntariffs,  phytosanitary  conditions, \nenvironmental  protection  and  control,  and  drug  trafficking;  and  both  formal  and  informal \nrestrictions  on  private  sector  participation  in  agricultural  activities,  including  production, \nprocessing,  marketing,  exports,  imports  and  distribution.  MOF,  MOC  and  other  relevant \ngovernment agencies will prepare time-bound action plans to remove any existing impediments \non  the  movement  of  agricultural  commodities  or  private  sector  participation  in  agricultural \nactivities.  The  Government  has  also  explicitly  stated  that  it  would  refrain  from  introducing  any \nexplicit subsidies or price supports on agricultural commodities.  \n \n54.  Much of the agricultural production in Afghanistan takes place in areas that are relatively \ninaccessible  and  remote  from  market  outlets  and  the  input  supply  chain.  In  particular,  the \nnetwork  of  farm-to-market  roads  and  agricultural  marketing  infrastructure  has  been  badly \ndegraded  by  25  years  of  civil  conflict  and  war.  The  isolation  of  farming  communities  raises \nproduction  costs  and  perpetuates  rural  poverty.  MAAH  has  therefore  initiated  studies  with  a \nview  to  identifying  options  to  improve  integration  of  agricultural  markets,  including  the \nstrengthening  of  farm-to-market  linkages.  Once  these  studies  are  completed,  a  strategy  and \ntime-bound  action  plan  will  be  prepared  to  implement  the  recommended  options.  In  the \nmeantime, the Government is also proceeding to implement a reconstruction program for farm-\nto-market roads and storage facilities. \n \n\n6. \n\nState-Owned Enterprises \n\n \nIn  line  with  the  policy  enunciated  in  the  NDF,  the  Program  seeks  to  carry  forward  the \n55. \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to SOE restructuring, including divestment of its ownership stake in \nsome  enterprises.  Accordingly,  an  inventory  of  SOEs  has  been  published  and  time-bound \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nImportant Features \n\nrestructuring  plans  will  be  prepared  as  follow  through  on  the  expressed  commitments  in  this \nregard.  The  Government  will  also  develop  a  strategy  and  procedures  for  restructuring  of  its \nSOEs, which will include provisions for market valuations of assets to ensure that the process is \ntransparent and fair, maximizes returns to the Government, and facilitates active private sector \nparticipation. The Government has moved ahead to dissolve the Agriculture Development Bank \nand  has  initiated  divestiture  of  the  Fertilizer  Trading  Company.  Further,  restructuring  of  the \nImproved  Seed  Enterprise  and  Helmand  Valley  Construction  Company,  aimed  at \ncommercialization  of  their  operations  and  establishment  of  independent  private  sector \nmanagement teams, has also been initiated.  \n \nC. \n \nA key feature of the proposed Program is the high degree of domestic ownership of the \n56. \npolicy reform agenda. Extensive consultation was carried out with Government counterparts in \nall the relevant ministries and maximum effort was made to reflect the special circumstances of \nAfghanistan  so  as  to  ensure  a  practical  and  realistic  reform  program.  Consultation  with  other \ndevelopment  partners  has  also  been  extensive,  and  will  help  to  ensure  that  TA  efforts  and \nfinancial  support  to  meet  adjustment  costs  and  investment  needs  in  the  sector  are  well \ncoordinated  (Appendix 6).  A  separate  consultation  with  key  NGOs  was  also  conducted  to \nharmonize  understandings  on  the  critical  issues  confronting  agricultural  development  and \nnatural  resource  management  in  Afghanistan.  The  discussions  with  the  NGO  community \nprovided an important validation of the scope and content of the reform program, given its long \nand extensive experience in implementing rural development activities throughout the country. \n \nAnother  important  feature  of  the  Program  is  its  flexibility  in  terms  of  the  range  of \n57. \noutcomes that would be acceptable to achieve compliance with the tranche release conditions. \nThe policy agenda is deliberately designed to be more flexible and adaptable than is typical for \nprogram  loans,  but  without  impacting  on  its  rigor.  In  each  selected  area  of  focus,  the  agreed \nconditionality signals strong government commitment to seek fundamental reform of the sector. \nBesides reflecting Afghanistan\u2019s extremely difficult circumstances, including significant security \nconcerns  outside  Kabul,  this  formulation  draws  from  ADB\u2019s  overall  experience  with  agriculture \nsector  programs  and  sector  development  programs  as  reported  by  the  Operations  Evaluation \nIn  particular,  overly  ambitious  programs  with  numerous \nDepartment  (paras.  18-20). \nconditionalities  have  tended  to  result  in  disappointing  performance  in  terms  of  implementing \nreforms.  Finally,  in  view  of  the  approaching  election  later  this  year,  the  selection  of  second \ntranche conditions has focused on activities that are less likely to be derailed in the event of a \nchange of government. \n \nD. \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  Special  Drawing  Rights  37,581,000 \n58. \n($55 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds Resources to support the proposed Program. \nThe  loan  amount  was  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  adjustment  and  related  costs  of  the \nproposed  policy  and  institutional  reforms,  taking  into  account  that  some  of  these  costs  are \nindirect  (i.e.,  imposed  through  market  forces)  and  will  not  directly  give  rise  to  government \noutlays.  The  likelihood  that  other  forms  of  financial  assistance  could  materialize  during  the \nprogram  period  was  also  taken  into  consideration  in  determining  the  loan  amount.  Four  main \nadjustment  cost  elements  are  considered:  (i) costs  of  compliance  with  the  new  legal  and \nregulatory systems and standards, (ii) costs of capacity building, (iii) costs of enforcement, and \n(iv) costs  of  price  adjustments.  Adjustment  costs  cover  technical  expert  input,  administrative \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n\fsupport,  training,  compensation,  building  and  equipment  associated  with  compliance,  capacity \nbuilding, and enforcement.  \n \n59. \nThe  major  cost  elements  under  the  reforms  of  the  agriculture  and  natural  resource \nmanagement  sector  are  those  associated  with  (i) developing  the  framework  for  economically \nviable and competitive activities, and sustainable use of natural resources, (ii) establishing the \nhydrological  network  and  pilot  river  basin  organizations,  (iii) establishing  efficient  and  effective \nsector  institutions  through  undertaking  institutional  reform  and  reorganization,  and  capacity \nbuilding, including compensation to retrenched staff, (iv) undertaking feasibility and preparatory \nstudies  to  formulate  a  sector  investment  program,  (v) improving  efficiency  in  input  and  output \nsupport  service  delivery,  and  in  production  systems,  and  (vi) restructuring  SOEs,  including \ncompensation  to  retrenched  staff.  These  and  related  costs  are  estimated  to  be  at  least \n$94 million, consisting of the following major cost categories: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nrehabilitating and restructuring sector ministries ($42.0 million); \nstrengthening field offices of sector ministries ($15.7 million); \nimproving natural resource management and planning ($26.3 million); \ndeveloping an irrigation investment program ($1.3 million); \nestablishing  an  input  and  output  certification  and  quality  assurance  system \n($1.1 million); and \nrestructuring agricultural SOEs ($3.3 million). \n\n \n60. \nThe particular nature of the program lending modality makes it difficult to directly link the \nutilization of loan proceeds during the program period with the specific adjustment costs noted \nabove.  Many  of  these  costs  will  only  arise  over  the  longer  term  and  it  is  expected  that  the \nGovernment\u2019s  fiscal  capacity  will  strengthen  to  enable  it  to  meet  the  remaining  financial \ncommitments  without  any  difficulty.  In  addition,  other  funding  agency  sources  have  been \nidentified to finance a portion of the costs. For example, roughly $20 million of the costs relating \nto natural resource management and planning is expected to be financed through other funding \nagency  interventions,  including  some  ADB-financed  activities.13  Moreover,  implementation  of \nthe Program\u2019s reform  agenda will give rise to a range of benefits (see paras. 82-83) that over \ntime are expected to significantly outweigh the costs. Further details of the adjustment costs are \nin Appendix 7 and Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n61. \nIn view of the exceptionally difficult postconflict circumstances that continue to prevail in \nAfghanistan, the Government has requested the softer Asian Development Fund terms (see the \ndevelopment  policy  letter  in  Appendix 5)  provided  under  the  previous  two  loans  from  ADB  to \nAfghanistan.  It  is  therefore  recommended  that  the  loan  have  a  repayment  period  of  40  years, \nincluding a grace period of 10 years; and carry an interest rate of 1% per year, with a repayment \nof principal at 2% a year for the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% per year thereafter. \nThe interest charge during the grace period will be capitalized and charged to the loan account. \nThese  terms  and  conditions  will  raise  the  grant  element  to  be  comparable  to  International \nDevelopment  Association  terms.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  available  for  disbursement  in  two \ntranches,  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with  agreed-upon  conditions  from  the  date  of  loan \neffectiveness until 30 September 2005.  \n \n\n                                                 \n13 This  includes  the  irrigation  component  of  the  Emergency  Infrastructure  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation  Project \n\nand the proposed Irrigated Agriculture Development Project as well as some World Bank-financed activities. \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\nE. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n \n62.  MOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Program  and  will  be  responsible  for \ndisbursing  the  loan  proceeds,  maintaining  program  records,  and  ensuring  compliance  with  all \npolicy-related conditions. MOF has appointed a program coordinator and assigned appropriate \nstaff  to  assist  in  coordinating,  monitoring,  and  supervising  program  activities.  The  program \nmanagement arrangements will be similar to those adopted under the PMPL, which proved to \nbe very effective in facilitating timely fulfillment of the second tranche conditions.  \n \n63.  MOF, MAAH, MIWRE, MRRD, MLIFS, MOC, DAB, and ARCSC will be the implementing \nagencies (IAs). MOF and the IAs will assume responsibility for implementing all conditions and \nprogram components within their regulatory and development mandates. Each IA will appoint a \nprograms officer, who will liaise with the program coordinator on policy decisions concerning the \nProgram.  MOF  and  the  IAs  will  also  liaise  closely  with  the  activities  of  ADB-funded  advisors \nalready  working  in  the  concerned  ministries  and  departments  under  the  ongoing  TAC  for \ncapacity  building  as  well  as  the  consultants  to be  engaged  under  the  piggybacked  TA  (paras. \n74-81). \n \nIn  addition, a  national  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  Minister  of  Finance  has been \n64. \nestablished to provide program oversight. Committee members will be deputy ministers from the \nconcerned  ministries  and  one  of  the  deputy  governors  from  DAB.  MAAH  will  serve  as  the \ncommittee\u2019s secretariat. The steering committee will meet at least quarterly to review program \nimplementation  and  to  resolve  interministerial  and  other  issues.  The  Program  will  be \nimplemented in close coordination with other aid agencies to avoid duplication of TA efforts and \nto enhance the impact of the reform measures.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n65. \nThe Program will be implemented over a period of 18 months, starting from the date of \nloan effectiveness. The loan will be released in two tranches upon satisfactory compliance with \nagreed  conditions  from  the  date  of  loan  effectiveness  up  to  30  September  2005.  The  loan \nclosing date is 30 April 2014.14 \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n \n66. \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items produced \nand  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  other  than  items  specified  in  the  negative  list  and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources (Appendix 8). In accordance with the \nsimplified  disbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  program  loans,15  goods  and \nservices  produced  and  originating  in  ADB  member  countries  will  be  procured,  with  due \nconsideration  of  economy  and  efficiency,  in  accordance  with  standard  public  procedures  in \nAfghanistan, and normal private sector commercial practices, acceptable to ADB. \n \n\n                                                 \n14 The loan needs to remain open until this date to ensure that the interest charge to be paid during the grace period \n\ncan be withdrawn from the Loan Account by ADB on behalf of the Borrower. \n\n15 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f67.  With  each  withdrawal  request,  the  Borrower  will  be  required  to  submit  a  certification \nconfirming  compliance  with  the  following  formula:  for  each  year  in  which  the  proceeds  of  the \nloan are expected to be disbursed, the annual withdrawal request is less than the value of the \ncountry\u2019s  total  imports  minus  (i) imports  from  nonmember  countries,  (ii) ineligible  imports,  and \n(iii) imports  financed  by  other  official  development  assistance.  ADB  will  have  the  right  to  audit \nthe  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Borrower\u2019s  certification.  Loan \nproceeds  may  be  used  to  finance  eligible  imports  for  which  expenditures  were  incurred  180 \ndays before the loan becomes effective. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n68. \nNo  consulting  services  will  be  directly  provided  under  the  loan.  However,  TA  will  be \npiggybacked to the Program to monitoring and implementation of the second tranche conditions, \nand  is  described  in  paras.  74-81.  The  consultants  engaged  under  this  TA,  together  with  other \nADB-financed  and  externally  provided  consultants,  will  also  support  the  IAs  in  program \nmonitoring and securing compliance with the second tranche conditions. \n \n\n5. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n69. \nThe Government anticipates the local currency counterpart funds generated by the loan \nwill be mainly used to meet the adjustment costs arising from the policy and institutional reforms \nsupported by the Program, and for general sector budgetary support. Further, it is expected that \ninvestments in irrigation development and in other rural infrastructure will be undertaken under \nother projects and programs supported by ADB and other development partners. \n \n\n6. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\n \n70. \nThe loan will be released in two tranches upon satisfactory compliance with the agreed-\nupon  conditions.  The  first  tranche,  equivalent  to  $30 million,  will  be  made  available  upon  loan \neffectiveness.  The  second  tranche  of  $25 million  equivalent  is  expected  to  be  made  available \nabout 12 months later upon satisfactory compliance with the agreed-upon conditions, as well as \ncontinued  compliance  with  all  first  tranche  conditions.16  The  conditions  for  release  of  the  first \nand second tranches are as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\nConditions for First Tranche Release \n\n(a) \n\nSector Policy Framework and Institutions \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPrepare  a \njoint  statement  outlining  key  priorities, \nstrategies, and policies for reviving agricultural growth and \npromoting sustainable use of natural resources. \nSubmit applications for approval of stage 1 of PRR of key \ndepartments of MAAH, MIWRE, and MRRD. \nSubmit recurrent and development budgets for SY1383 of \nMAAH, MIWRE, and MRRD. \n\n                                                 \n16 The specific actions required for tranche release are set out in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f21 \n\n(b) \n\nNatural Resource Management \n\nConfirm  commitment  to  develop  a  comprehensive  policy \non forestry and rangeland management. \nInitiate work on the EPA. \nAppoint  high-level  commission  to  prepare  comprehensive \nland policy. \n\n(c) \n\nAgricultural Commodity Markets \n\nConfirm  intent  to  remove  all  restrictions  on  the  movement \nof agricultural commodities. \nConfirm  intent  not  to  introduce  government  subsidies  or \nprice supports on agricultural products. \nConfirm  intent  to  remove  all  restrictions  on  private  sector \nparticipation in agricultural activities. \n\n(d) \n\nState-Owned Enterprises \n \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nConfirm intent to restructure agricultural SOEs. \nInitiate divestment of the Fertilizer Trading Company. \nDissolve the Agricultural Development Bank. \nInitiate commercialization of the Improved Seed Enterprise \nand Helmand Valley Construction Company. \n\n(ii) \n\nConditions for Second Tranche Release \n\n(a) \n\nSector Policy Framework and Institutions \n\nPrepare  time-bound  action  plans  for  implementing  the \nagriculture sector strategy and policy framework. \nApprove  stages  1  and  2  PRR  applications  for  MAAH, \nMIWRE, and MRRD. \nPrepare  action  plan  for  consolidating  agriculture  sector \nministries and reducing the number of their departments. \nSubmit  recurrent  and  development  budgets  of  MAAH, \nMIWRE,  and  MRRD  for  SY1384  to  MOF  in  line  with \nrestructuring plans. \n\n(b)  Natural Resource Management \n\nfor  groundwater  development  and \n\nComplete  strategy \nmanagement. \nFollowing  public  consultation,  initiate  reform  of  the  1981 \nWater Law based on the interim water policy. \nSubmit \nmanagement policy and initiate public consultation. \n\nto  Cabinet  a  draft \n\nforest  and \n\nrangeland \n\n(viii)  Approve the EPA. \n(ix) \n\nSubmit  draft  land  policy  to  the  Cabinet  and  initiate  public \nconsultation. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAgricultural Commodity Markets \n\n(c) \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nSubmit time-bound action plans for removal of restrictions \non the movement of agricultural commodities. \nMaintain  policy  of  no  subsidies  or  price  supports  on \nagricultural products. \nSubmit  time-bound  action  plan  for  liberalization  of  the \nagriculture  sector  including  removal  of  restrictions  on \nprivate sector participation in agricultural activities. \n\n \nState-Owned Enterprises \n\n(d) \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nDevelop  procedures  for  restructuring  and  divestment  of \nSOEs. \nSubmit  to  Cabinet  time-bound  restructuring  plans  for \nagricultural SOEs. \nComplete divestment of the Fertilizer Trading Company. \nComplete  commercialization  of \nEnterprise and Helmand Valley Construction Company. \n\nImproved  Seed \n\nthe \n\n7. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n71. \nThe  IAs  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  the  progress  in  implementing  program \nreforms.  Monitoring  will  require  close  coordination  between  the  IAs  and  support  will  be \nmobilized  to  rapidly  develop  information  systems  at  the  central,  provincial,  and  local  levels. \nThere are, however, serious capacity gaps in skills relating to field surveys, data collection and \nanalysis,  management  feedback  systems,  and  report  writing.  In  short,  the  Government\u2019s \ncapacity to carry out program impact evaluation is very limited. In view of this, ADB is providing \nTA to build capacity for poverty assessment and statistical compilation.17 ADB will also closely \nmonitor  the  progress  of  program  implementation  and  the  impact  of  the  reforms  on  the \nperformance  of  the  sector.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  continue  to  engage  in  active  policy \ndialogue  throughout  program  implementation,  including  identification  of  additional  reforms  that \nmay be considered necessary or desirable for the sustained development of the sector. \n \n72.  MOF, with assistance from the IAs, will provide ADB with quarterly reports on program \nimplementation,  in  particular  the  policy  actions  set  out  in  the  development  policy  letter  and \npolicy  matrix.  The  reports  will  be  submitted  in  such  form,  detail,  and  regularity  as  ADB  may \nreasonably request, and will include information on progress made and problems encountered \nduring  the  period  in  review,  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  problems  encountered,  the \nproposed detailed activities for program implementation, and the expected progress during the \nnext quarter or period of review. On completion of the Program, but in any event not later than 6 \nmonths after program completion, the Government will prepare and furnish ADB with a program \ncompletion report on the overall impact of the policy reforms.  \n \n\n                                                 \n17 TA for Support for Poverty Assessment and Socioeconomic and Macroeconomic Statistical Capacity Building was \n\napproved in December 2003 in the amount of $1.75 million. \n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f23 \n\n8. \n\nProgram Review \n\n \n73. \nADB will field quarterly program review missions. A midterm review will take place about \n6 months after loan inception to evaluate overall progress toward completion of the envisaged \nactions  under  the  Program,  particularly  those  required  for  release  of  the  second  tranche.  In \naddition,  the  national  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  Minister  of  Finance  will  meet \nperiodically  to  review  progress  under  the  Program.  MOF  will  prepare  a  summary  of  the \ndiscussions of the steering committee, which will be sent to ADB. \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nProgram Coordination \n\n \n74. \nThe  Program  will  address  basic  policy,  institutional,  and  organizational  reforms  in \nagriculture and natural resource management. Accordingly, investment and capacity building in \nthese  areas  will  be  provided  in  part  by  linking  program  implementation  with  the  activities  of \nADB-funded  advisors  already  working  in  the  concerned  ministries  and  departments  under  the \nongoing TAC. However, the Government has determined that additional support will be required \nto effectively implement, sequence, and monitor policy reform actions and has requested ADB \nTA to (i) help facilitate program coordination and monitoring, (ii) develop a comprehensive land \npolicy  and  an  appropriate  institutional  framework  for  land  titling,  (iii) assess  the  human \nresources  and  capacity-building  needs  of  the  core  sector  ministries,  (iv) assess  institutional \noptions to meet rural credit needs, (v) improve the efficiency of agricultural commodity markets, \nand (vi) develop procedures for restructuring and divesting SOEs. Other development partners \nhave  indicated  that  these  are  the  areas  where  assistance  is  urgently  needed  and  where  ADB \nassistance would best be targeted. MOF will be the EA for the TA. \n \nA. \n \n75. \nTo  facilitate  timely  fulfillment  of  the  tranche  release  conditions,  the  TA  will  assist  MOF \nand  the  core  sector  ministries  to,  inter  alia,  (i) maintain  consistency  of  activities  with  the \nProgram\u2019s objectives of promoting agricultural growth and poverty reduction through support for \nmarket-based  policy  reforms,  formulation  of  public  infrastructure  investment  plans,  and \ninstitutional and organizational capacity building; (ii) determine the economic and social impacts \nof  the  policy  reform  measures;  (iii) review  all  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  aspects  for \nconsistency in promoting program objectives; (iv) ensure that the irrigation investment program \nis \nto  social  and  environmental  safeguards  and  gender \nconsiderations;  (v) devise  measures  to  enhance  private  sector  participation  in  agricultural \nresearch, extension, and education; and (vi) ensure that SOEs are restructured with adequate \nemphasis on good governance and financial viability. The TA will also assist the MOF and the \nIAs in developing a program performance monitoring and evaluation system. \n \nB. \n \n76.  With  the  appointment  of  a  high-level  commission  to  oversee  preparation  of  a \ncomprehensive  land  policy,  and  the  appointment  of  an  interministry  working  group  to  initiate \nstudies  on  an  appropriate  framework  for  land  titling  and  administration,  the  Government  has \nsought  assistance  to  bring  international  best  practice  to  bear  in  these  areas.18  Land  tenure \nproblems  arise  in  many  countries  and  there  is  much  to  be  learned  from  their  experiences  in \n\nformulated  with  due  regard \n\nLand Policy and Land Titling \n\n                                                 \n18  Parallel  cofinancing  in  the  amount  of  approximately  $0.8  million  is  also  planned  from  the  Department  for \n\nInternational Development to support the work of the high-level commission and interministry working group. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fHuman Resources Assessment and Capacity Building \n\nreform  and  institution  building.  Issues  of  particular  concern  to  Afghanistan  include  how \ncustomary  and  statutory  land  tenure  regimes  have  been  integrated;  how  an  inexpensive, \ndecentralized, and sustainable land tenure administration can be established; how appropriate \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards  can  be  incorporated;  and  the  proper  role  of  the  state  in \nland  administration  and  land  ownership.  The  TA  will  also  provide  support  for  the  design  and \ninitiation  of  a  public  consultation  process  for  the  draft  land  policy,  and  the  preparation  of  a \ntimetable and action plan to introduce an appropriate system for land titling and administration \n(i.e., a system that includes adequate environmental and social safeguards). \n \nC. \n \n77. \nThe  core  sector  ministries  lack  detailed  information  on  the  numbers  and  capacities  of \ntheir human resources. There is no comprehensive database on actual numbers of employees, \nand no assessment has ever been made of the capacity of the ministries\u2019 human resource base. \nSimilarly,  training  and  professional  development  of  staff  from  the  ministries  has  been \nnonexistent during the long period of conflict. The Government has in this context requested TA \nto  assist  the  core  sector  ministries  in  developing  the  relevant  databases  and  making  an \nassessment of their human resources and institutional development needs in view of their new \nmandates,  and  to  design  training  and  capacity-building  programs  based  on  the  needs \nassessment.  Large  numbers  of  redundancies  will  be  identified  through  this  process,  and \nassistance  will  also  be  necessary  for  the  design  of  appropriate  retrenchment  and  separation \npackages. \n \nD. \n \n78. \nDevelopment  of  rural  finance  is  an  integral  part  of  the  overall  development  of  the \nfinancial  sector.  The  TA  will  assess  the  most  effective  institutional  options  to  meet  the  full \nspectrum  of  rural  credit  needs  from  among  the  current  pilot  projects,  through  the  commercial \nbanking  system,  and  from  newly  identified  programs  and  projects.  This  will  be  followed  by \nassistance  with  preparing  time-bound  action  plans  to  implement  the  desired  options.  Special \nattention  will  be  given  to  assessing  the  credit  needs  of  women,  and  to  identifying  options  and \nsubsequently preparing action plans.  \n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Options for Rural Finance \n\nAgricultural Commodity Markets \n\n79.  With  the  planned  removal  of  formal  and  informal  controls  on  the  movement  of \nagricultural commodities (including inputs) and of impediments to private sector participation in \nagricultural  marketing  activities,  the  Government  has  requested  assistance  in  establishing  an \nappropriate  legislative  and  regulatory  framework  for  agricultural  commodity  markets.  In  this \nconnection,  the  TA  will  seek  to  distill  the  recommendations  of  various  ongoing  diagnostic \nstudies  in  this  regard  and  define  strategies  and  time-bound  action  plans.  The  TA  will  also \nprovide support for establishing input and output certification and quality assurance systems. \n \nF. \n \n80. \nThe  Government  will  need  to  direct,  manage,  and  sequence  the  restructuring  and \ndivestment  of  SOEs  in  a  manner  that  maximizes  returns  to  the  state.  The  TA  will  provide \nassistance in developing procedures to facilitate timely and efficient restructuring of SOEs in line \nwith  this  objective.  To  ensure  that  this  process  is  efficient  and  transparent,  provisions  will  be \ndeveloped to ensure that assets are valued at market prices and that adequate incentives are \n\nRestructuring and Divesting State-Owned Enterprises \n\n24 \n\n \n\n\f25 \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nprovided for active private sector participation. Social safety net provisions will also need to be \ndeveloped to address the retrenchment costs of SOE restructuring.  \n \nG. \n \n81. \nThe total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1,100,000 equivalent, comprising $872,000 \nin  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $228,000  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  finance  $1,000,000  to \ncover the entire foreign exchange cost and $128,000 equivalent of the local currency cost on a \ngrant  basis.  The  Government  will  finance  in  kind  the  balance  of  the  local  currency  cost \namounting  to  $100,000  equivalent.  The  consultants  will  be recruited  by  ADB  through  a  firm  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Selection will be in accordance \nwith quality and cost-based selection methods. An estimated 36 person-months of international \nconsultants will be provided. Any procurement  under the TA will be in  accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. The TA is expected to begin in July 2004 and will be completed by \nSeptember  2005.  Outline  terms  of  reference  and  more  detailed  cost  estimates  are  in \nAppendix 9. \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits \n\n \nA. \n \n82. \nThrough  its  support  for  market-based  policy  reforms,  formulation  of  public  investment \nplans , and institutional reform and organizational capacity building in the core sector ministries, \nthe  Program  will  over  the  longer  term  promote  accelerated  agricultural  growth  and  facilitate \ngreater  inroads  toward  poverty  reduction.  Employment  creation  through  enhanced  on-farm \nproductivity,  greater  commercialization  of  agricultural  production,  promotion  of  agro-based \nindustry,  and  greater  devolution  of  agricultural  support  services,  is  also  expected  to  be \nsignificant.  The  sustainability  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  development  process  is  also  expected  to  be \nenhanced  through  better  informed  and  more  efficient  natural  resource  management.  Specific \nbeneficiaries  are  expected  to  include  the  rural  poor,  small  and  marginal  farmers,  nomadic \npastoralists  and  other  livestock  herders,  returning  refugees,  internally  displaced  persons,  and \ndemobilized combatants. \n \n83. \nThe following are among the benefits that can therefore be directly or indirectly attributed \nto  the  various  program  components:  (i) improved  public  sector  efficiency  and  effectiveness; \n(ii) improved  efficiency  and  more  sustainable  use  of  natural  resources,  particularly  of  water; \n(iii) improved resource mobilization from domestic sources for rehabilitation and reconstruction; \n(iv) improved  economic  management;  (v) improved  credit  delivery  in  rural  areas;  (vi) improved \nefficiency and better integration of agricultural commodity markets; (vii) increased private sector \nparticipation;  (viii) enhanced  institutional  efficiency  in  service  delivery;  (ix)  improved  fiscal \nstability; and (x) a more diversified and profitable agriculture production base. \n \nB. \n \n84. \nenvironment, and as such will face a number of risks. These include the following: \n \n\nThe  Program  will  be  implemented  in  a  changing  political,  institutional,  and  security \n\nRisks \n\n(i) \n\nGovernment commitment to the reform process could weaken in the run up to the \nnational  elections  currently  scheduled  for  September  2004,  and  a  change  in \ngovernment  in  the  wake  of  these  elections  might  result  in  a  policy  shift.  While \nthese  risks  are  difficult  to  mitigate,  the  Government\u2019s  performance  in  pursuing \n\n \n\n \n\n\fdifficult reforms under the PMPL, in particular the recent passage of the Central \nBank  Law  and  Banking  Law,  indicates  a  strong  commitment  to  pushing  ahead \nwith  the  structural  reform  agenda.  President  Karzai\u2019s  success  in  forging  a \nconsensus  during  the  recent  Constitutional  Loya  Jirga  suggest  that  the \nGovernment will continue to move ahead with its reform program in the coming \nyear. In addition, a strong consensus has emerged within the country, including \nwithin civil society and the NGO community, on the need for far-reaching reforms \nin  the  agriculture  sector.  Finally,  the  conditions  for  second  tranche  release  are \nfocused  on activities  that  are  less contentious politically  and  thus  more  likely  to \nproceed in the event of a change in government. \nThe security situation remains a concern in light of the recent attacks on aid staff, \nroad  construction  crews,  and  the  NATO-led  International  Security  Assistance \nForce (ISAF). However, increased funding has been mobilized to finance reforms \nin the security sector (including the police, Afghan national army, and the Ministry \nof  Defense).  In  addition,  the  mandate  of  the  ISAF  was  recently  expanded  to \ncover areas outside Kabul and it will take on more of a peacekeeping role. These \ndevelopments are expected to result in an improvement in the security situation \nthroughout  the  country.  In  addition,  to  enable  the  Government  to  extend  its \nauthority beyond Kabul and to support the reconstruction process, United States \nand  NATO-led  efforts  are  underway  to  deploy  Provincial  Reconstruction  Teams \nin 13 outlying locations over the next few months. \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii)  Weak institutional capacity may also delay implementation of the reform agenda. \nThe ADB\u2019s TAC for capacity building, the TA piggybacked to this loan, and other \nfunding  agency-assisted  TA  will  provide  critical  inputs  to  facilitate  timely  and \neffective  implementation.  In  addition,  the  activities  carried  forward  under  the \nProgram  themselves,  particularly  those  relating  to  the  strengthening  of  sector \ninstitutions, will help to build institutional capacity. \nThe macroeconomic and budgetary situation may worsen, causing a diversion of \nfunds  from  meeting  the  adjustment  and  other  costs  associated  with  the \nProgram\u2019s  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  Afghanistan  has  entered  into  a  staff-\nmonitored program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that should allow \nthe  Government  to  build  on  its  already  good  track  record  and  establish  an \nadequate level of capacity for a possible future upper credit tranche arrangement \nwith the Fund. Further, revenue mobilization has improved as a result of customs \nreform  and  recent  steps  taken  by  the  provinces  to  remit  funds  to  the  central \ncoffers.  It  is  expected  that  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  collect  revenue  and \nmanage its budget will continue to improve through its collaboration with the IMF.  \nExternal  assistance  could  also  fall  short  of  what  is  required.  The  experience  of \npost-conflict countries shows that assistance typically starts to decline after a few \nyears, just at the moment when the recipient country\u2019s capacity to absorb aid and \nuse  it  effectively  is  increasing.  Afghanistan\u2019s  reconstruction  effort  has  only  just \nbegun and will continue to require sizable assistance for several years to come. \nThus far, the commitment of the international community to Afghanistan remains \nstrong.  ADB  will  continue  to  provide  strong  leadership  in  this  regard  by  fulfilling \nits own financial commitments to Afghanistan. \n\n(v) \n\n26 \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f27 \n\nImpact on Poverty \n\nC. \n \n85.  While  no  poverty  assessment  has  been  prepared19  or  poverty  partnership  agreement \nsigned, the Program directly supports achievement of pillars 2 and 3 of the Government\u2019s NDF, \nwhich serve as the country\u2019s de facto poverty reduction strategy (Appendix 10). Agriculture and \nother  rural-based  activities  are  the  main  source  of  income  and  employment  in  Afghanistan, \nproviding  livelihoods  for  nearly  85%  of  the  population.  By  enhancing  rural  livelihoods  and \neconomic  efficiency  in  agriculture,  the  proposed  Program  should  contribute  directly  to  poverty \nreduction and lead to an improvement in a range of other social and economic indicators.  \n \n86. \nNo systematic study has been done on the factors contributing to poverty in Afghanistan, \nbut available information suggests that poverty is associated with low economic growth and the \ncollapse of income-generating and employment opportunities due to the long period of war and \ncivil  conflict.  Other  factors  likely  pertain  to  the  distinctive  features  of  the  agro-ecological \nenvironment  (e.g.,  the  frequent  droughts),  natural  resource  degradation,  land  ownership  and \ntenure,  loss  of  livestock  and  destruction  of  orchards,  access  to  water  and  agricultural  inputs, \navailability of off-farm employment opportunities, refugee/displacement status, gender, ethnicity, \nhousehold status (e.g., with female head or not, educational attainment), and physical disability. \nThe  Program  seeks  to  address,  either  directly  or  indirectly,  a  number  of  these  root  causes  of \npoverty.  In  addition,  the  Program  will  benefit  vulnerable  tribal  groups,  traditional  livestock \nherders, and nomadic pastoralists by supporting development of a policy framework that would \nprovide  them  with  equal  access  to  land  resources  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples. \n \nD. \n \n87. \n The  Program  is  classified  as  category  C  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines.  The  matrix  of  environmental  impacts  (Appendix 11)  indicates  that  the \nadverse  impacts  that  might  arise  during  Program  implementation  are  of  minor  significance. \nAssistance  will  be  provided  by  advisors  engaged  under  the  TAC  to  help  ensure  that  program \nactivities, particularly those relating to preparation of the sector investment program, are carried \nout in accordance with relevant environmental safeguards and policies. In addition, the Program \nis  expected  to  result  in  a  number  of  important  environmental  benefits.  These  include \nstrengthening  the  Government\u2019s  institutional  capacity  for  natural  resource  management  and \nplanning,  and  passage  of  the  country\u2019s  first  comprehensive  environmental  legislation  (i.e.,  the \nEPA). The latter will, inter alia, provide a legal basis for introducing formal environmental impact \nassessment requirements and is expected to result in the eventual creation of an environmental \nprotection agency. \n \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n88. \nthe legal documents: \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the following assurances will be incorporated in \n\n                                                 \n19  Reliable statistics on poverty are not available for Afghanistan. However, various estimates place the proportion of \nthe population living below the threshold of $1 a day or consuming below the FAO\u2019s minimum requirement of 2,453 \ncalories a day per capita at 60\u201380%. Further, preliminary ADB estimates indicate that about 53% of the population \nlive below the poverty line of $90 per capita per annum in 2002 prices. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe  policies  and  actions  taken  before  the  date  of  the  Loan  Agreement  as \ndescribed  in  the  development  policy  letter  and  the  policy  matrix  will  continue  to \nbe in effect for at least the duration of the Program. \nThe  Government  will  adopt  the  other  policies  included  in  the  Program  and \nspecified in the development policy letter and the policy matrix in a timely manner \nand will ensure that the policies and actions continue to be in effect for at least \nthe duration of the Program. \nIn  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples,  the  preparation  of  a \ncomprehensive  land  policy  and  policy  on  forestry  and  rangeland  management \nwill  include the  integration  of  customary  and  statutory  land  tenure  regimes,  and \nwill involve the participation of civil society groups. \nThe Government will use the local currency counterpart funds generated by the \nloan to meet program expenditures and the adjustment costs of reform and will \nchannel the funds to MAAH, MIWRE, MRRD, and the other IAs. \nThe  Government  will  take  into  account  gender-specific  constraints  to  accessing \ncredit and other agricultural services in developing action plans. \n\nConditions for Disbursement \n\nThe  loan  will  be  released  in  two  installments  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with \nthe conditions as specified in the development policy letter and policy matrix. The \nfirst  tranche,  equivalent  to  $30 million,  will  be  made  available  upon  loan \neffectiveness.  The  second  tranche  of  $25 million  equivalent  will  be  made \navailable  upon  satisfactory  compliance  of  the  second  tranche  conditions \nspecified in the policy matrix attached. No withdrawal will be made from the loan \naccount  in  respect  of  the  second  tranche  unless  ADB  is  satisfied,  after \nconsultation with MOF, that sufficient progress has been made. \nBefore  submitting  to  ADB  the  first  application  for  withdrawal  from  the  loan \naccount, the Government will establish a deposit account at DAB. \n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n \n89. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  37,581,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of \nAfghanistan  for  the  Agriculture  Sector  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  a \nterm of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, an interest charge at the rate of 1% per \nannum,  with  the  interest  charge  during  the  grace  period  to  be  capitalized  and  charged  to  the \nloan account, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.  \n \n \n\n        Joseph B.

The draft is based on inputs from the government departments, joint needs assessment \nprocess and inputs from other actors on the ground. \n \n2. \npolicy directions. \n \n3. \nThis early first draft is presented to the participants of the Implementation Group in order \nto convey an early sense of the direction taken by the Interim Administration in the development \nof  the  country,  and  to  place  in  an  appropriate  context  the  priority  projects  presented  in  the \ncourse of the meeting. It is envisaged that within six weeks a National Development Budget will \nhave  been  finalized.  Finalization  will  entail  a  further  series  of  extensive  consultations  with \nministries, international organizations and the nongovernment organization (NGO) community. \n \n4. \nThe  ongoing  process  to  create  the  national  development  budget  has  included  the \nestablishment of the Development Budget Commission, composed of the Ministry of Planning, \nMinistry of Finance, Ministry of Reconstruction, and the AACA. All projects are expected to be \nanchored in one of the programs identified within the National Development Framework, unless \nexceptional circumstances apply. In this regard mechanisms for project and program review are \nbeing established. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThere is a consensus in Afghan society: violence as a means of compelling the majority \nto submit to the will of a minority must end. The people\u2019s aspirations must be represented and \nreflected  in  an  accountable  government  that  delivers  value  on  a  daily  basis.  This  consensus \nforms the foundation for a vision of a prosperous and secure Afghanistan. The current poverty \nof the country is painfully obvious; this vision of a peaceful and prosperous future is a beacon \nthat  can  mobilize  the  energies  of  an  enterprising  and  independent  people,  guide  them  in  their \ncollective and individual pursuits, and reinforce the sense of national unity, mutual dependence, \nand participation in a common enterprise. \n \nOur  people  are  poor,  the  majority  is  illiterate,  but  the  sophistication  of  political  debate \n6. \nand awareness is remarkable, in great part due to the international media. Despite the years of \nwar,  our  opinions  are  also  shaped  by  a  myriad  of  networks  that  link  us  to  the  international \ncommunity.  There  is  a  widespread  desire  to  retain  the  current  international  interest  in  our \ncountry,  and  to  channel  it  in  ways  that  would  lay  the  basis  for  multiple  partnerships  between \ndifferent groups in our society and the global community. \n \n7. \nThis desire for engagement is premised on the hope that international engagement will \nbe  an  instrument  for  ending  our  poverty,  the  reestablishment  of  our  sovereignty  and  national \nunity, and a foundation for sustainable prosperity. Our people\u2019s expectations have been raised \n\nThe National Development Framework \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nby the promises of world leaders that they will be with us for the long haul. The succession of \nvisits and delegations are a sign to our people that the engagement is continuing. \n \n8. \nDiscussions  of  development,  however,  remain  abstract.  Public  opinion  is  shaped  by \nconcrete  manifestations.  If  the  general  discussions  are  not  connected  to  changes  in  the  daily \nlives and experiences of the people, public opinion could easily turn skeptical. \n \n9. \nAfghans  have  been  disappointed  by  the  international  community  before.  Hope  could \nthen be replaced by frustration, and frustration, in a context of raised expectations, is a recipe \nfor  anger,  discord,  and  finally  conflict.  For  us  to capitalize  on  the  current  consensus,  then,  we \nmust deliver, and deliver soon; as words become deeds, belief in the possibility of a safe and \nprosperous future will grow. \n \n10. \nDelivering rapidly, however, does not mean delivering unwisely. We must internalize the \nlessons  of  50  years  of  experience  of  international  assistance.  Afghanistan  offers  a  unique \nopportunity to prove to the skeptics that the aid system is relevant in a post-conflict context, and \nthat difficult challenges can be met with determination, partnership, and vision. \n \n11. \n \n\nFive lessons stand out: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nFirst, the developmental agenda must be owned domestically, and the recipient \ncountry must be in the driver\u2019s seat. \nSecond,  the  market  and  the  private  sector  is  a  more  effective  instrument  of \ndelivering sustained growth than the state. \nThird, without a state committed to investing in human capital, the rule of law, the \ncreation  of  systems  of  accountability  and  transparency,  and  providing  the \nenabling  environment  for  the  operation  of  the  private  sector,  aid  cannot  be  an \neffective instrument of development. \nFourth, people in general and the poor in particular are not passive recipients of \ndevelopment  but  active  engines  of  change.  Sustainable  development  requires \ncitizen  participation  and  adopting  of  methods  of  governance  that  enable  the \npeople  to  take  decisions  on  issues  that  affect  them  and  their  immediate \nsurroundings. \nFifth,  donor-funded  investment  projects,  unless  they  are  anchored  in  coherent \nprograms  of  government,  are  not  sustainable.  Structural  adjustment  programs, \nunless they are translated into feasible projects, do not result in reform. \n\nThe Strategy \n\n \n12. \nThere  is  an  emerging  consensus  that  the  budget  must  be  the  central  instrument  of \npolicy, and that the country should have the capacity to design programs and projects that are \npart of a coherent developmental strategy. All interventions must have clear outcomes, and be \nproperly monitored. \n \nC. \n \nOur developmental strategy has three pillars: The first is to use humanitarian assistance \n13. \nand  social  policy  to  create  the  conditions  for  people  to  live  secure  lives  and  to  lay  the \nfoundations  for  the  formation  of  sustainable  human  capital.  The  second  is  the  use  of  external \nassistance to build the physical infrastructure that lays the basis for a private sector-led strategy \nof  growth,  in  such  a  manner  as  to  support  the  building  of  human  and  social  capital.  The  third \npillar is the creation of sustainable growth, where a competitive private sector becomes both the \nengine of growth and the instrument of social inclusion through the creation of opportunity. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n31 \n\nCutting  across  all  our  activities  will  be  the  issues  of  security,  of  administrative  and \n\nA brief outline of the programs and subprograms contained in each pillar will be provided \n\n \n14. \nfinancial reform, and of gender. \n \n15. \nhere. \n \n\n1. \n\nPillar 1\u2014Humanitarian and Human and Social Capital \n\n \n16.  We are still in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. We are keenly aware of the needs and \nconditions of our vulnerable people. We need immediate action in the following areas: Refugees \nand  returnees;  between  1.4  to  2 million  refugees  are  expected  to  return  to  their  homes,  along \nwith thousands of internally displaced. A systematic and integrated approach will be required if \nwe  are  to  help  them  reintegrate  safely  and  develop  secure  livelihoods  rather  than  end  up  in \nshanty towns. Education, after years of neglect and worse, will be the foundation of economic \ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction.  Vocational  training  is  a  priority,  in  particular  to  assist  the \nmujahadeen,  many  of  whom  have  sacrificed  so  much  in  the  cause  of  freedom,  and  to  assist \nwomen.  Health  and  nutrition  will  require  massive  and  long-term  investment  if  we  are  to  lift \nAfghanistan  from  169  in  the  human  development  index.  Two  areas  need  particularly  urgent \nattention, malnutrition, and better obstetric care that will bring down the unacceptably high levels \nof maternal and infant mortality rates. Afghans have shown a remarkable ability to survive in the \nface  of  disaster,  but  there  is  a  need  to  invest  in  livelihoods  to  facilitate  our  enterprise  in  the \nsearch  for  a  good  living.  And  finally,  after  the  ravages  of  the  Taliban,  we  must  act  fast  to \npreserve  our  national  heritage,  we  must  remember  the  vital  role  of  culture  in  the  process  of \nnational reconstruction and defining Afghan identify. \n \n17. \n \n18.  We  cannot  afford  sectoral  and  localized  projects  that  lead  to  disconnects.  So  we  are \ninitiating  two,  large-scale,  integrated  programs  as  the  foundation  of  much  work  in  this  pillar. \nFirstly we will initiate a national community development program, known as National Solidarity, \nwhich  will  deliver  block  grants  to  communities  across  the  country.  And  secondly  we  have \ndesignated 10 key areas for special attention because they have been worst affected by human \nrights  abuses  and  will  be  centers  of  refugee  and  internally  displaced  person  return.  We  are \nrequesting the United Nations (UN) agencies and bilateral donors to help us develop rapidly a \nseries of projects in these areas. \n \n\nIt is vital that we take an integrated and programmatic approach to all work in this pillar. \n\n2. \n\nPillar 2\u2014Physical Reconstruction and Natural Resources \n\n \n19.  We  intend  to  begin  the  reconstruction  and  expansion  of  the  physical  infrastructure  as \nsoon  as  possible.  The  government  is  committed  to  launching  public  works  programs \nimmediately  in  order  to  offer  opportunities  to  the  unemployed  and  under-employed.  We  have \nidentified a number of programs in this area and are in the process of preparing specific projects \nwithin each of the programs. For example, roads, water and sanitation, and the energy sector all \nneed  urgent  attention.  As  the  country  will  be  rebuilt  by  its  families,  we  also  need  to  ensure \npeople have access to building materials. \n \n20. \nIn  urban  management  our  aim  is  to  invest  in  a  balanced  urban  development  program \nacross  the  country  to  create  viable  cities  that  are  hubs  of  economic  activity,  and  organically \nlinked  to  rural  areas.  With  the  concentration  of  population  in  some  cities,  they  would  play  a \nmajor role in the overall improvement of human development indicators. In terms of municipal \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\ninfrastructure  we  need  to  focus  on  some  immediate  and  pressing  needs  such  as  roads  and \ntransport sewerage, waste management, drinking water and sanitation. \n \n21. \nAs  much  of  the  physical  infrastructure  of  government  has  been  destroyed,  we  will \nimplement  a  national  program  of  construction  that  will  create  or  restore  the  physical \ninfrastructure of government across the country. \n \n22. \nOur  approach  to  physical  infrastructure  is  based  on  lessons  from  international \nexperience.  The  state  will  define  the  areas  of  priorities,  but  it  will  not  be  the  implementing \nagency.  Instead,  we  will  turn  to  the  national  and  international  private  sector  to  help  us  design \nand  implement  our  projects.  Communities  and  NGOs  will  be  asked  to  participate  in \nidentification,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  of  these  programs  and  projects.  We  will  pay  serious \nattention to the operation and maintenance costs of these projects and will be looking closely at \ntheir financial and economic sustainability. The issue of medium to long-term consequences of \nshort-term interventions has already become clear in the health sector. For example, there has \nbeen  considerable  interest  in  the  rehabilitation  or  construction  of  hospitals  in  Kabul.  But  our \nhealth experts are pointing out that the recurrent costs of hospitals located in the capital could \nbe  a  serious  drain  on  resources  that  could  be  more  usefully  directed  towards  preventative \nmedicine. \n \n\n3. \n\nPillar 3\u2014Private Sector Development \n\n \n23. \nThe  implementation  of  the  infrastructure  program  will  give  some  impetus  to  the \ndevelopment of the private sector, but it is in the development of a competitive export-oriented \neconomy that our real hopes for the private sector lie. We are in the fortunate position that the \nEuropean  and  American  markets  are  open  to  our  exports.  We  are  in  the  process  of  being \ngranted  most  favored  nation  status  and  we  are  receiving  strong  support  from  the  US \nAdministration and Congress for textile quotas. \n \n24.  We  need  to  meeting  international  standards  on  health,  organic  agriculture,  child  labor, \ncertificates of origin, and other technical requirements. We will need assistance in these areas \nand consultations with our entrepreneurs to explain the opportunities that exports to Europe will \nprovide. The development of the export market for our agricultural and horticultural products is \ncritical to our strategy of eliminating poppy cultivation. With high-value and low-volume products, \nwe  can  be  confident  of  offering  our  farmers  secure  livelihoods.  We  are  planning  to  use  our \nOverseas  Private  Investment  Corporation  guarantee  to  assist  in  the  development  of  an \nagricultural processing industry. \n \n25. \nRecognizing the enormous international interest in Afghanistan, we are creating a \u201cMade \nin Afghanistan\u201d label and \u201cMade in Afghanistan by Women\u201d label to enable Afghan producers to \nrealize the maximum from their labors. We hope to link Afghan producers to a number of large \ndepartment  stores.  Afghanistan  has  considerable  assets;  sustainable  use  and  development  of \nthese  assets  will  require  foreign  direct  investment.  We  are  working  on  the  relevant  policy  and \nlegal  frameworks  that  would  attract  investment,  including,  for  example,  the  urgent  need  for  a \nbasic regulatory and licensing framework for telecommunications. \n \n26.  We  must  also  use  internal  trade  as  a  way  of  binding  the  country  back  together  again, \neconomically  as  well  as  politically.  Alongside  the  roads  programs  already  mentioned,  this  will \nmean reinvigorating our market places in secondary and tertiary towns, \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n33 \n\na. \n\nGovernance, Financial Management, and Administrative Reform \n\n \n27.  We know that good governance is a precondition for attracting direct foreign investment. \nWe  are  addressing  the  issues  of  financial  management,  auditing,  and  procurement  through \nhiring international private firms chosen on the basis of direct competition. Our goal is to have a \nbudgetary process that would meet the international standards for receiving direct donor support \nfor reconstruction and development projects. Building the domestic revenue collecting ability of \nAfghanistan  will  be  a  key  part  of  the  reconstruction  process.  Revenue  capacities,  and \nparticularly the national unity of the revenue collection system, have been in disarray during the \nrecent period and need to be rebuilt. \n \n28. \nThe  degradation  of  our  financial  institutions  in  fact  offers  us  an  opportunity  to  move \nforward  with  speed  and  determination  in  creating  management  systems  that  will  provide  the \nunderpinning  for  accountability,  efficiency,  and  transparency.  Our  banking  sector  requires  a \nmajor  over-haul,  and  we  are  embarking  on  this  process.  The  central  bank\u2019s  role  is  being \nstrengthened  and  the  government  has  made  a  commitment  in  its  budget  decree  to  observe \nfinancial discipline and not resort to overdraft. We are emphasizing the need for urgent capacity \nbuilding  in  the  central  bank  and  the  banking  sector  and  are  requesting  urgent  technical \nassistance in this area. We are examining the relevant laws and regulations and are preparing a \nseries of measures to provide a firm legal basis for a modern financial sector. \n \n29. \nRule  of  law  is  the  basis  of  good  governance.  The  administration  has  strictly  abided  by \nthe  Bonn  agreement  and  is  determined  to  see  the  Emergency  Loya  Jirga  take  place  on  time. \nWe are determined to use the time remaining to the Interim Administration to prepare proposals \nand plans for strengthening the rule of law and to implement measures that would enhance the \nconfidence of our people in their government. \n \n30.  We  view  the  principle  of  accountable  government  as  applying  as  much  to  our \ndevelopment policy as our administrative and judicial. We in the advanced stages of planning a \nnational community empowerment program, called National Solidarity, which will deliver a series \nof block grants to communities to enable them to make decisions in a participatory manner on \ntheir key priorities. We are planning to cover at least one to two districts in every province under \nthis program. This approach should enable members of the communities to choose their local \nleaders,  and  to  strengthen  their  collective  efforts  in  mobilizing  their  own  resources  to \nsupplement those provided by the government. \n \n31.  We  must  get  the  balance  right  between  Kabul  and  the  provinces,  between  the  urban \ncenters  and  the  rural  areas.  This  is  important  both  to  ensure  an  equitable  balance  in  our \ninvestments,  and  in  terms  of  the  political  and  administrative  relationship.  All  interventions, \nwhether  roads,  sanitation,  power  or  drinking  water,  will  be  chosen  on  the  basis  of  an  even-\nhanded  approach  to  spatial  development  that  focuses  on  needs  not  on  ethnic  group.  While \nKabul\u2019s  needs  are  immense,  and  there  is  an  urgent  need  for  a  comprehensive  reconstruction \nplan of the city, our focus must be the entire country. The physical infrastructure of government \nis  either  destroyed  or  severely  damaged.  We  are  therefore  planning  a  major  program  of \nconstruction of the physical infrastructure of governance across the country. Each ministry and \ndistrict must have a  minimum number of facilities and these facilities should be equipped with \nmeans  of  communication  to  enable  speedy  flow  of  information  between  levels  of  government \nand to connect Kabul to the provinces. Only then will we be able to link up the country under a \nunified government. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n32.  We  have  carried  out  an  assessment  of  the  capacity  of  our  line  ministries  and  have \nreached the conclusion that we need an innovative approach to the rapid building of capacity as \nwell  as  a  strategy  for  reform  of  the  administrative  system.  Our  approach  to  the  immediate \nproblem  is  to  create  implementation  cells  of  between  10  and  40  people  in  line ministries.  The \nstaff of these cells, to be recruited on the basis of clear criteria of merit, technical competence, \nand  clear  definition  of  tasks,  will  be  provided  with  the  resources  to  translate  our  overall \nprograms into specific projects and oversee the implementation of these projects by the private \nsector, NGOs and international contractors. They will be supported by technical assistance from \ndonors  and  will  work  closely  with  AACA  to  enhance  coordination  between  communities,  the \ngovernment, donors, NGOs and the UN. \n \n33.  We will be adopting a similar approach to the provincial administration. \n \n34. \nThe years of conflict degraded the civil service. We now need to start work in earnest on \nthe important task of creating a modern and efficient civil service. The Civil Service Commission \nhas  been  selected  and  will  start  its  work  soon.  It  will  need  to  be  supported  by  strong  analytic \nwork  and  by  inputs  from  key  actors  in  the  development  arena  to  formulate  and  implement  a \ncomprehensive agenda of reform. Of particular importance will be training, in both management \nand technical areas. A civil service training college is being proposed. \n \nPay  scale  is  a  critical  issue.  NGOs,  bilateral,  multilateral  organizations  and  the  UN \n35. \nsystem  have  pay  scales  that  exceed  the  government\u2019s  pay  scale  by  a  factor  of  50  for  their \nnational staff. The differential in pay between international staff and government staff is a factor \nof 1000 to 2000. such an uneven playing field militates against the building of capacity. While \nthe  market  cannot  be  controlled,  there  has  to  be  an  imaginative  and  principled  approach  to \naddressing this critical issue. Donors should make a clear commitment to increasing the number \nof  their  Afghan  national  staff  and  should  join  the  government  in  setting  up  a  task  force  to \npropose  sustainable  solutions  to  this  problem.  Without  a  workable  solution,  this  problem  will \nhaunt all our good intentions for creating capacity. \n \n\nb. \n\nSecurity and the Rule of Law \n\n \nRule  of  law  and  good  governance  depend  on  security.  The  Afghan  state  must  have  a \n36. \nlegitimate monopoly of violence, a corollary of which is that its citizens will not need to pay for \nthe  cost  of  protection  as  individuals.  Freedom  of  movement,  for  commodities  and  ideas,  is \nconstrained  by  perceptions  of  security.  For  example,  many  donors  now  insist  on  staying  in \nKabul, and starting projects there. Kabul\u2019s needs are immense, but in our judgment, there are \nother  parts  of  the  country  that  are  more  secure  than  Kabul.  Thus  does  the  perception  of \ninsecurity exclude areas urgently in need of development assistance from receiving attention. \n \n37.  We  have  prepared  a  detailed  program  for  the  creation,  training,  and  deployment  of  a \nnational police force. We have, however, been constrained from implementing our program by \nlack of funds and exclusion of support for the police from the UNDP-administrated Trust Fund. \nThis constraint is being removed, and we hope to embark on our program very rapidly. We have \nalso formulated our plan for the formation of a national army and the first battalion of the new \narmy has been trained and deployed as the National Guard. \n \n38.  We  will  also  need  to  provide  for  absorption  back  into  society  of  the  mujahadeen,  who \nhave  sacrificed  so  much  for  the  independence  and  dignity  of  this  country.  Absorption  of  the \nmujahadeen  into  the  economy,  society,  and  polity  is  a  significant  challenge.  We  plan  to  meet \nthis challenge through a series of measures. A large scale program of vocational training, based \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n35 \n\non an analysis of the needs of an expanding economy, will be a critical part of this program and \nwe  are  inviting  donors  to  assist  us  in  implementing  this  program  quickly.  Demining  is  also  an \nurgent priority and a precondition for agricultural recovery and freedom of movement. \n \n39.  We  are  counting  on  finding  solutions  to  meeting  the  expenses  of  the  security  sector \nquickly. In Geneva, there have been extensive discussions on meeting the costs of the national \narmy  and  police  and  we  now  need  to  act  rapidly.  Our  developmental  efforts  depend  on  the \nprovision  of  security,  as  without  the  perception  and  reality  of  security  of  person  and  property, \npeople will not feel safe to invest. \n \n40. \nThe judicial system will be revived through a program that provides training, makes laws \nand precedents available to all parts of the system, and rehabilitates the physical infrastructure \nand equipment of the judicial sector. \n \n41. \nOur  vision  of  security,  however,  is  broader  than  the  services  provided  by  the  security \nsector  to  the  citizens.  Security  of  livelihood  is  critical  to  our  endeavor,  to  eliminate  poverty,  to \nprovide social justice, remove barriers to inclusion and to create a society where all citizens are \nprovided with access to equality of opportunity. \n \n\nc. \n\nGender \n\n \n42. \nGender is a critical issue for us. Subjected to the segregationist policies of the Taliban, \nour girls and women need special attention. We do not want gender to be a ghetto. There must \nbe  specific  programs  directed  to  enhancing  the  capabilities  of  our  girls  and  women.  More \nimportantly,  all  programs  must  pay  special  attention  to  gender,  and  not  include  it  as  an \nafterthought. We have to engage in a societal dialogue to enhance the opportunities of women \nand improve cooperation between men and women on the basis of our culture, the experience \nof other Islamic countries, and the global norms of human rights. \n \n\nd. \n\nResearch, Information Management and Policy Making \n\n \n43. \nAs a living document, this framework will be amended, modified, and transformed in the \nlight  of  new  research,  experience,  and  knowledge.  Its  implementation  will  thus  depend  on \naccess to and management of information. Currently, very little reliable information exists, often \ninformation  is  fragmented  and  hoarded.  This  hampers  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  respond  to \npredictable crises and to make policy based on evidence of what works and what does not. \n \n44. \nThe  government  will  create  and  maintain  an  information  management  system  on  all \ndonor  activities.  Standards  for  information  gathering  need  to  be  set,  and  information  shared \npromptly and widely. Timely monitoring and evaluation of programs and projects will be built into \ntheir  design.  The  Afghanistan  Information  Management  System  will  be  one  component  of  this \nlarger  strategy.  We  have  already  received  assistance  and  are  in  the  process  of  implementing \nthis  policy.  All  information  management  systems  created  by  individual  donors  should  provide \ninputs to the government\u2019s information management system currently at the AACA that will be \neventually transferred to the Central Statistical Office. \n \n\ne. \n\nThe Role of the State \n\n \nFinally,  our strategy  of development  provides  a  clear  role  for  the  state.  The  state must \n45. \nprovide security, invest in human capital, and articulate and implement a social policy focused \non assistance to the vulnerable and excluded and the elimination of poverty. It must create an \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nenabling environment for the activities of the private sector, make effective use of aid to attract \ntrade and investment, and put the economy on a sustainable path to growth. \n \n46.  We  thus  need  an  effective  central  government  that  re-establishes  the  national  unity  of \nthe  country  on  the  basis  of  strong  institutions  and  the  rule  of  law.  Simultaneously,  we  are \ncommitted  to  building  on  community  level  participation  and  effective  management  at  the  local \nlevel.  We  do  not  see  government  as  the  producer  and  manager  of  the  economy,  but  as \nregulator and promoter of the entrepreneurial energies of our people. The state will enter into a \ndirect managerial role only when social justice demands its presence. The government will act \nin  partnership  with  communities,  NGOs,  donors,  UN  organizations,  and  the  national  and \ninternational  private  sector  to  implement  its  programs,  and  realize  its  vision.  As  the  legitimate \nrepresentative  of  the  people,  it  is  the  key  task  and  challenge  of  the  government  to  create  the \ninstitutions and organizations that would embody principles and practices of good governance. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n37 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n39 \n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nNatural Resource Management \n\n \n \nA. \n \n1. \nAfghanistan  has  a  total  land  area  of  about  65 million  hectares  (ha)  of  which \napproximately 80% is either mountainous or desert, with forest cover of only around 1.3 million \nha or 2% of the land area. Forest area has declined from 1.9 million ha in 1996. There is one \nnational  park  and  five  protected  areas.  In  recent  years,  forest  cover  has  diminished  due  to \ncommunity  demands  for  fuelwood  and  illegal  logging.  It  is  estimated  that  offtake  rates  are \nexceeding annual growth rates, leaving a deficit of about 30,000 ha of forest per year. If nothing \nis done, Afghanistan will have very little natural forest or its associated wildlife left in 15 years\u2019 \ntime. On purely conservation and environmental grounds, Afghanistan should have at least 5% \nof its land area, or about 3.2 million ha, of forest cover. This in turn would facilitate preservation \nof  the  country\u2019s  rangeland  and  watershed  resources,  and help  to  stem  the  loss  of  biodiversity \nand rural livelihoods. \n \n2. \nIllegal logging is largely a function of the security situation and control of local resources \nby  local  commanders  in  collaboration  with  traders  from  neighboring  countries.  Forestry \nlegislation has been in draft form for many  years, awaiting clarification of tenure and land use \nrights of local tribes in many parts of the country. The lack of a legal framework clarifying tenure, \nuser  rights,  and  oversight  responsibilities,  combined  with  the  collapse  of  government \ninstitutions,  has  led  to  resource  rents  being  controlled  by  local  elites.  Local  communities,  with \nthe  help  of nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  have  attempted  to  protect  forests,  but  local \nleaders  have  disrupted  these  efforts,  which  has  resulted  in  the  disintegration  of  both  social \norganizations and physical barriers such as fencing. \n \n3. \nThe  demand  for  fuelwood  is  estimated  to  be  less  damaging  than  illegal  logging,  but  is \nnevertheless  destructive.  The  issue  needs  to  be  addressed  within  a  policy  framework  of  rural \nenergy  needs  incorporating  provisions  for  community  or  social  forestry  programs.  Similarly, \nrecent  years  have  witnessed  the  cultivation  of  rangeland  as  communities  sought  ways  to \nmitigate  the  effects  of  drought  and  population  pressures  in  some  areas.  These  activities  have \nresulted in the widespread degradation of both forests and rangeland, with consequent flooding, \nwater shortages, and severe soil degradation in many areas. \n \n4. \nGovernment agencies have had a limited role in conservation activities over the last 20 \nyears, with most of the work being done by NGOs. NGOs have been working directly with local \ncommunities  and  community  representatives  (shuras),  and  have  focused  their  activities  on \nsustaining \nthe \ncontribution  of  NGOs  has  been  large,  there  has  been  little  coordination  of  programs  and  only \nlimited efforts have been made to evaluate their effectiveness. This experience and the lessons \nlearned will need to be integrated into future activity planning and mechanisms will need to be \ncreated to link reformed government agencies with NGOs, either through partnerships or formal \ncontractual arrangements. \n \n5. \nThere  is  a  general  consensus  that  the  natural  resources  in  Afghanistan  are  in  poor \ncondition. The extended drought is commonly cited as the principal cause together with the long \nperiod of conflict. While the conflict has undoubtedly been an important contributor, the impact \nof  the  drought  should  not  be  seen  as  an  event  that  necessarily  results  in  a  degraded \nenvironment. Afghanistan has a long history of drought of varying degrees of severity and will \ncontinue  to  experience  such  periods.  Traditional  coping  and  mitigation  strategies  have  broken \n\nlivelihoods  based  on  horticulture  and  agroforestry \n\ninterventions.  While \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nWater Resources \n\ndown  under  growing  population  pressures,  the  collapse  of  the  rural  economy,  and  control  by \nlocal  elites.  Such  strategies  must  be  rebuilt  within  the  context  of  a  community  development \napproach  and  effective  natural  resource  management.  In  the  future,  vulnerability  to  drought \nmust be significantly reduced by incorporating a range of technologies and by strengthening off-\nfarm income-generating activities. Any tendency to misuse natural resources must be countered \nby  appropriate  environmental  management  institutions  backed  by  legislation.  Currently, \nAfghanistan does not have an agency with overall responsibility for natural resource protection. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nWater is Afghanistan\u2019s most precious natural resource. This resource must be managed \nefficiently and sustainably as it is fundamentally scarce and drought is a common occurrence. \nCurrently,  significant  opportunities  exist  to  improve  water  use  planning,  efficiency,  and \nmanagement,  as  only  15%  of  runoff  is  contributing  to  aquifer  recharge  and  irrigation  system \nefficiency  levels  are  only  at  about  25%,  when  a  level  of  40%  should  be  the  norm.  Moreover, \ndemands on the resource base have grown and are expected to continue to grow. The scope \nalso exists to expand the irrigation area. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations (FAO) has estimated long-term water availability at about 2,800 m3 per head per year, \nenough  to  irrigate  5 million ha,  which  is  significantly  higher  than  the  current  command  area  of \n2.6 million ha. \n \n7. \nTotal developed irrigated area in 1978 was estimated by the FAO to be 2.63 million ha, \nconsisting  of  (i) 1.32 million  ha  by  traditional  methods  from  perennial  rivers;  (ii) 0.98 million  ha \nby traditional methods from ephemeral streams, kereze, and arhads; and (iii) 0.33 million ha by \nmodern  systems  from  perennial  rivers.  Only  1.44 million  ha  had  sufficient  water  supply  to \nsupport double cropping. Approximately 2.3 million ha or 90% of the total area uses traditional \nschemes  developed  and  built  by  farmers,  which  are  operated  and  maintained  according  to \ntraditional communal customs and practices. \n \n8. \nThe  effects  of  war  and  neglect  on  these  systems  have  not  been  systematically \nassessed.  While  there  has  been  substantial  financial  and  technical  support  for  rehabilitation \nsince  1989  from  NGOs  and  United  Nations  (UN)  agencies,  comprehensive  data  on  the  scale \nand  extent  of  successful  and  sustainable  rehabilitation  are  not  available.  In  1997,  FAO \nestimated  that  about  1.7 million  ha  required  rehabilitation,  and  another  0.7 million  ha  required \nimproved  water  management.  A  limited  number  of  large  formal  irrigation  systems  have  also \nbeen  built,  operated,  and  maintained  by  the  state,  but  are  now  dysfunctional  and  in  need  of \nmajor  rehabilitation.  These  large  formal  schemes  raise  significant  technical,  institutional,  and \nsocial issues as the schemes will require infrastructure rehabilitation, repairs to dams and other \nmajor  structures,  and  many\u2014particularly  those  in  the  plains  and  in  the  south\u2014have  serious \nwater management problems, including water logging and salinity. \n \n9. \nThe  Government  needs  to  develop  appropriate  policies  to  effectively  manage  and \nmonitor groundwater development and use. Groundwater, whether a part of annual recharge or \nof nonrenewable reserves, could serve as the most important safeguard in times of drought or \nlow  water  availability.  While  this  is  a  principle  mentioned  in  the  1981  Water  Law,  legal  and \nregulatory approaches will require effective public institutions and obedience to the rule of law. \nA promising approach in the interim that is being applied in many areas of the world is to involve \ncommunities directly in conjunctive use and management of surface water and groundwater, in \nsome cases by forming special groundwater management districts in which all water users (of \nboth surface water and groundwater) have an effective role in decision making. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n41 \n\n10.  While the increase in vulnerability to low rainfall can be traced to unsustainable land use \npractices\u2014involving  overgrazing,  deforestation,  and  cultivation  of  marginal  lands\u2014these \npractices  are  an  outcome  of  increased  population  density,  a  shrinking  natural  resource  base, \nand  limited  opportunities  for  alternative  employment  and  income  generation.  When  prolonged \ndrought  occurs,  asset  depletion,  low  agricultural  production,  increased  indebtedness,  low  food \nsupply, poor health, and increased uncertainty sustain a downward spiral in the quality of rural \nlife  that  is  difficult  to  recover  from  when  rainfall  returns  to  normal.  For  this  reason,  providing \nsupport to the off-farm rural economy is a high priority, as efficiently targeted and implemented \nlabor-intensive  interventions  to  rehabilitate  rural  infrastructure,  such  as  roads  and  storage \nfacilities, provide needed employment and livelihood improvement. \n \n11. \nGiven the country\u2019s variable climatic conditions and vulnerability to drought, information \nsystems  on  current  and  expected  weather,  rain,  and  water  accumulation  in  the  winter  snow \npack are important in terms of both farmer decision making and cropping enterprises, and at the \nmacro level in preparing short- and long-term strategies to reduce vulnerability to drought. Such \nstrategies  may  involve  water  conservation  and  improved  efficiencies  in  water  use;  water \nharvesting  and  watershed  management;  small  storage  dams;  and  river  basin  planning  and \nmanagement. In Afghanistan, timely and reliable data on the amount of water stored in the snow \npack are especially important because snowmelt is the primary source of spring runoff and river \nflow. Surveys of snowfall to measure water storage and forecast expected runoff are commonly \nundertaken in river basins in other countries with similar climatic conditions. \n \n12. \nThe river basin (and sub-basin as appropriate) should be the basic unit for planning and \nmanagement. To enable multisector and often conflicting demands to be managed, a national \nwater  coordination  agency  should  be  established  with  responsibility  for  guiding  all  aspects  of \nwater  use  across  government  ministries  (both  planning  and  regulation)  as  well  as  monitoring, \nprotection, and conservation of the resource base. Sustainable management of rivers and their \nuse for irrigation and hydropower as well as other uses, and the management of flood hazards \nand risks, are and will be important determinants of the country\u2019s prosperity. \n \n13. \nThere  is  considerable  scope  for  transferring  management  of  the  larger  irrigation \nschemes  to  beneficiaries.  The  state  owns  about  0.4 million  ha  within  such  schemes.  The \nrehabilitation  of  such schemes  should  be  based  on  an  approach  that is  the  outcome  of  active \ncommunity participation, as community groups should take over system management, including \noperation and maintenance of the infrastructure. \n \nC. \n \n14. \nThe arable agricultural resource base is about 7.5 million ha of cultivable land, which is \ndivided into rainfed and irrigated land. The rainfed area is estimated at about 4 million ha, and is \nlargely  located  in  the  northern  provinces  where  cereal  production  predominates.  The  rainfed \narea actually cultivated in a particular year varies considerably depending upon climatic factors \nsuch  as  precipitation  and  the  area  that  needs  to  be  left  fallow.  The  recent  succession  of  dry \nyears  had  reduced  the  annually  cultivated  rainfed  area  to  less  than  0.5 million  ha  before \nrebounding in recent years. Rainfed agriculture is largely undertaken in the northern provinces \nand is dominated by the production of cereals. \n \n15. \nRainfed  cereal  productivity  levels  have  also  been  low,  averaging  some  0.6  metric  tons \n(mt)  per  ha  in  recent  years,  partly  as  a  result  of  the  drought.  Rainfed  cereal  production  fell  to \nabout  10%  of  expected  production  in  a  normal  rainfall  year  during  that  period.  As  a \nconsequence, food security became a key concern, especially in the north. Recovery strategies \n\nCrop Agriculture \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nfor  these  areas  must  be  predicated  on  the  assumption  of  highly  variable  rainfall  and  risk \nmitigation. In particular, farmers must be able to respond to favorable weather conditions quickly \nand,  since  cereal  yields  and  the  margin  above  subsistence  will  always  be  relatively  low,  in  a \ncost-effective manner. \n \n16. \nFarmers  must  also  have  ready  access  to  quality  seed,  fertilizer,  and  farm  draught  or \nmechanical power. In addition, they will need technical advice on recent developments in dry-\nland  farming  systems,  including  water  harvesting  and  access  to  effective  plant  protection  and \ndisease control systems. To take advantage of quality inputs, farmers will need to have access \nto rural finance. In the last 10 years, NGOs, UN agencies, and in particular the FAO have been \ninvolved  in  agricultural  rehabilitation,  developing  farmer-based  seed  multiplication  programs, \npromoting technology transfer, and supporting agricultural service delivery systems, including of \nmicrocredit. The lessons learned from these experiences need to be incorporated into effective \nstrategies and programs. \n \n17. \nInputs  such  as  seeds,  fertilizer,  and  agrochemicals  are  being  provided  by  a  number  of \nfunding agencies, including NGOs. In some instances, inputs are provided free of charge. There \nis  a  need  for  closer  coordination  of  input  provision  to  ensure  that  both  quantity  and  quality \nissues are adequately addressed. In particular, a consensus needs to emerge on a strategy that \neffectively  moves  the  current  situation  toward  the  government  vision  of  private  sector-led \ndistribution networks for the main inputs. Such a strategy will have to address the appropriate \nrole of the public sector in plant protection programs and the requirements to establish systems \nfor certification and regulation of the quality of seeds, fertilizers, and agrochemicals provided by \nthe private sector. \n \n18. \nThere is considerable potential for productivity improvements even allowing for the low \nand variable rainfall regime. The International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas has \npromoted  drought-tolerant  varieties  and  cultural  practices  for  cereals,  legumes,  and  forage \ncrops that could significantly increase returns and crop yields. With the introduction of extensive \nand  well-designed  micro  watershed  management  and  the  adoption  of  micro  water-harvesting \ntechniques, the potential for further yield increases is significant. The potential to improve rain-\nfed cereal yields suggests that rainfed farming could play an important role in agriculture sector \nrecovery.  Over  the  longer  term,  the  possibility  of  Afghanistan  being  able  to  produce  1.5\u2013\n2.0 million  mt  of  cereals  annually  from  its  rainfed  farming  areas  would  transform  agricultural \ndevelopment. Food security concerns could then be  relegated to very specific marginal areas, \nand  costly  irrigation  water  could,  for  the  most  part,  be  used  to  grow  high-value  cash  crops.  A \nfurther  advantage  of  such  a  strategy  is  that  it  is  based  on  the  careful  management  of  micro \nwatersheds,  which  means  that  communities  would  be  drawn  into  an  integrated  approach  to \nresource  use,  combining  water,  forestry,  rangelands,  and  crops.  This  is  the  traditional  Afghan \napproach, which has largely broken down in the course of the past 20 years. \n \n19. \nThe  relatively  low  and  variable  rainfall  regime  places  a  premium  on  irrigated  land.  It  is \nestimated  that  85%  of  all  agricultural  output  is  derived  from  the  irrigated  areas.  The  general \nmanagement  of  water  resources  and  the  efficiency  of  irrigation  systems  is  therefore  of  critical \nimportance to the whole food economy. While the potential irrigable area has been estimated at \n5 million  ha,  only  2.6 million  ha  have  been  developed,  and  under  normal  conditions  about \n1.4 million  ha  would  have  sufficient  water  for  double  cropping.  The  productivity  of  all  types  of \nirrigation systems could be improved substantially. Firstly, improved on-farm water management \nand  appropriate  inputs  would  substantially  increase  yields.  The  average  national  yield  of \nirrigated  wheat  in  recent  years  has  been  around  1.3  mt  per  ha.  With  improved  water \nmanagement and inputs, a long-term goal of a national average yield for irrigated wheat of 3.0\u2013\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n43 \n\n3.5  mt  per  ha  would  be  feasible.  By  way  of  comparison,  the  average  yield  for  International \nMaize  and  Wheat  Improvement  Center  bread  wheat  lines  in  the  period  1995\u20132000  under  a \nrange  of  agroclimatic  conditions  varied  from  4.6  to  5.7  mt  per  ha.  In  addition  to  yield \nimprovements, better water management would contribute to higher cropping intensities, which \nare  a  function  of  water  availability  and  length  of  growing  season.  Better  water  management \nshould enable the proportion of the irrigated command area that could be double cropped to rise \nfrom 50% to at least 65%. \n \nThe  principal  output  of  the  irrigated  systems  is  wheat,  accounting  for  about  80%  of \n20. \nproduction,  and  a  range  of  horticultural  crops.  It  is  expected  that  the  irrigated  wheat  area  will \ndecline  as  rainfed  wheat  production  becomes  more  productive  and  farmers  begin  contributing \ntoward the cost of the water. The development and rehabilitation of irrigated agriculture requires \nsignificant investment, which has to be recovered, and a single crop of wheat, even at a yield of \n3.0 mt per ha, is not sufficient to recover such costs. A much higher proportion of the irrigated \narea  should  be  devoted  to  high-value  cash  crops.  Agroforestry  and  horticulture  are  small  but \npreviously highly productive subsectors, at one time accounting for 40% of total export earnings. \nSuch crops plus a range of others that have not traditionally been grown in Afghanistan, should \nbe assessed and where feasible piloted. \n \n21. \nThe  long  period  of  conflict  and  recent  drought  have  had  a  devastating  impact  on  the \nhorticulture  industry.  Precise  figures  are  not  available,  but  observation  and  small  surveys \nsuggest that approximately 50% of Afghanistan\u2019s orchards have been destroyed. The feasibility \nof  rehabilitating  the  industry  will  be  determined  by  the  potential  to  compete  in  international \nmarkets.  Other  countries  have  entered  the  markets  vacated  by  Afghanistan  and  regaining  its \nformer  market  share  will  be  difficult.  A  detailed  survey  of  potential  markets  and  their  entry \nrequirements  will  need  to  be  undertaken.  Formerly,  Afghanistan  also  produced  a  number  of \nindustrial  crops  such  as  cotton  and  sugar  beet,  which  were  linked  to  substantial  processing \nfacilities.  These  facilities  are  largely  moribund.  Feasibility  studies  will  be  needed  to  determine \nthe  prospects  for  these  industries,  and  future  investment  in  agribusiness  must  come  from  the \nprivate sector. \n \n22. \nThe  recovery  of  commercial  agriculture  and  much  of  the  cereal  subsector  will  require \nfinance,  which  is  not  readily  available.  The  reestablishment  of  agricultural  credit  facilities \nrequires detailed assessments of the feasibility of introducing both community-based and asset-\nbased lending. There is a need to attract commercial funds into agriculture, which means asset-\nbased lending using land titles as collateral and related bankruptcy procedures. However, such \nlending instruments are not well established. Indeed, with less than 25% of landholders having \nclear legal title to their land, lack of collateral will be a constraint. A review of the rural financial \nsystem to identify an appropriate institutional framework is required, including an assessment of \nexisting bank and nonbank financial institutions. \n \nD. \n \n23. \nLivestock activities have traditionally been part of most farming systems in Afghanistan, \nwith livestock and their products providing farm draught power, family nutrition, raw materials for \nthe production of household goods, and tradable products. Livestock activities have traditionally \nprovided households with their only source of cash income. Previously, the livestock subsector \naccounted for 40% of total export earnings, but it is estimated that at present, subsector exports \nare negligible and livestock numbers are only about half of their level a decade ago. \n \n\nLivestock \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nLivestock  raisers  are  currently  facing  serious  problems  including  loss  of  animals, \n24. \ndecreased  productivity  due  to  declining  feed  supplies  and  overgrazing,  and  the  effects  of \nineffectively  treated  animal  diseases.  Moreover,  much  of  the  irrigated  land  that  formerly \nsupported  livestock  is  now  without  water.  As  a  result,  the  small  poultry  flocks,  which  were \nalmost  exclusively  owned  and  managed  by  women,  have  almost  disappeared  in  many \nhouseholds, while the smallest and poorest farmers who formerly kept at least one cow are now \nwithout any animals. The small ruminant subsector has been hampered by traditional user rights \nand  grazing  practices  even  in  nondrought  periods,  as  well  as  a  preoccupation  with  livestock \nnumbers rather than productivity. \n \n25. \nIn the absence of government provision of animal health and livestock services, a range \nof  development  partners  (FAO,  bilateral  funding  agencies, and  NGOs)  have  supported  project \nactivities over the past decade. These include the establishment of veterinary field units, which \nare  now  in  every  province  and  in  most  districts.  While  it  was  intended  that  these  units  would \nbecome financially self-sufficient, in most locations the drought and conflict have reduced both \ndemand and farmer-client capacity to pay for services. Other key funding agency activities have \ninvolved vaccination programs and deworming treatments. While these activities have provided \na range of benefits, the coverage they currently provide is very limited. \n \n26. \nIn  larger-scale  commercial  and  semi-commercial  livestock  ventures,  most  herds  and \nflocks  have  been  substantially  reduced,  and  earlier  investments  in  assets  such  as  feed  mills, \ncommercial  poultry  operations,  and  milk  processing  facilities  have  largely  been  lost.  To \nreestablish these activities, new investments in commercial poultry and dairy operations will be \nimportant and producers will need to gain access to breeding stock, processed feedstuffs, and \nequipment. Considerable investment will also be required to reestablish feed mills, and poultry \nand  milk  processing  plants.  Investment  is  also  needed  in  commercial  poultry,  red  meat,  and \ndairy  production.  In  addition,  investments  need  to  be  made  in  production  and  processing \nfacilities,  which  add  value  to  livestock  products  for  domestic  consumption  or  export.  These \ninclude  operations  such as  abattoirs,  dairy  processing  plants,  tanneries, wool  processors,  and \nfattening  operations.  The  reestablishment  of  these  facilities  would  also  create  a  market  for \nsmallholder-produced livestock products, which is presently nonexistent. \n \n27.  Within  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Animal  Husbandry  (MAAH),  two  subdirectorates \nare responsible for livestock. Currently, both are ineffective as they lack resources to undertake \nexisting  functions.  Most,  if  not  all,  of  the  staff  will  require  retraining.  Further,  there  are  also \nsignificant  deficiencies  in  private  and  public  sector  skills  in  commercial  poultry  and  dairy \nproduction  that  also  need  to  be  addressed.  The  facilities  that  the  Government  formerly \nmaintained  to  support  livestock  production  are  no  longer  operational,  and  are  mostly \ninappropriate  for  the  anticipated  new  core  functions  of  government  agencies.  The  current \nabsence of reliable information, particularly with respect to livestock numbers and location, and \nfodder resources, is inhibiting development planning interventions and commercial investments \nin the sector. \n \nE. \n \n28. \nThe  Agricultural  Research  and  Technology  Transfer  System  (ARTTS)  was  substantial \nprior to the conflict, though not always focused on the actual needs of the Afghan farmer. This \nsystem  is  now  largely  nonfunctional  as  a  result  of  widespread  destruction  of  the  supporting \ninfrastructure  and  loss  of  skilled  human  resources.  When  fully  operational,  the  MAAH\u2019s \nDepartment  of  Agricultural  Research  consisted  of  11  subdepartments  and  carried  out  its \nfunctions through 24 research stations (seven main and 17 submain), covering the full range of \n\nAgricultural Research and Technology Transfer \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n45 \n\ngeographic  and  agroclimatic  variability  of  the  country.  At  the  height  of  their  activity,  these \nresearch  stations  had  over  1,000  staff  members,  of  whom  25%  were  technical  research  staff, \nand covered a land area of about 1,750 ha. \n \nIn  the  future,  the  ARTTS  network  must  focus  on  adaptive  research  and  technology \n29. \ntransfer  directly  related  to  agricultural  development,  and  should  not  be  involved  in  basic \nresearch.  Internationally,  a  wealth  of  new  technologies  developed  for  dryland  areas  have  now \nbecome  available.  The  major  role  of  ARTTS  should  be  to  test,  adapt,  and  disseminate \ntechnologies  suitable  to  local  climatic  conditions.  Demand-driven,  on-farm  participatory \napproaches  to  research  and  development  will  need  to  be  employed,  focusing  on  farming \nsystems  and  integrated  watershed  planning  techniques  appropriate  to  local  agro-climatic \nconditions. Institutional capacity building and policy innovations will be necessary to support an \nenhanced contribution from agricultural research and technology transfer to rural development. \nHuman  capacity  strengthening  will  also  be  necessary  to  induce  institutional  innovation  in \nagricultural research and technology transfer. This in turn will require new management training \nin methodologies for technology dissemination. \n \nF. \n \n30. \nThe  National  Development  Framework  (NDF)  sets  out  key  principles,  policies,  and \nstrategies  to  guide  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  recovery  and \nreconstruction  program.  This  framework  is  especially  relevant  to  the  agriculture  sector.  The \ninstitutions in these sectors are faced with developing a new vision of their future role, revising \nthe  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  the  sector,  and  the  massive  task  of  institutional \nrestructuring  and  capacity  building  to  enable  the  respective  line  ministries,  including  their \nprovincial and district offices, to lead the recovery and reconstruction effort. The Government\u2019s \nguiding principles in this regard are as follows: \n \n\nInstitutional Reform and Capacity Building \n\nThe  line  ministries  and  other  state  entities  will  be  responsible  for  overall  natural \nresource planning, policies, and related management parameters; the formulation of \nprograms  to  deliver  agreed  upon  public  services  to  the  community  level,  including \ntechnology transfer; the regulation of private sector activities; and the monitoring of \nperformance  of  development  programs.  Implementation,  to  the  extent  possible,  will \nbe  entrusted  to  the  private  sector,  including  the  beneficiary  communities.  In  this \nregard,  the  Government  will  create  an  enabling  environment  for  the  efficient \noperation  of  national  and \nin \nengineering and construction activities). \nLocal  communities  will  be  empowered  to  decide  their  development  priorities,  to \ncontribute  to  implementation  of  their  projects  and  activities  where  possible,  and  to \nmonitor the work of government agencies and the private sector. The Government\u2019s \nstrategy  will  focus  in  the  near-term  on  creating  employment  opportunities  and \nsupporting livelihood improvements at the community level. \n\nfirms  (particularly \n\nthose  engaged \n\ninternational \n\nThere  are \n\nthree  core  ministries \n\n \n31. \nin  agriculture  and  natural  resource \nmanagement. They are the MAAH, the Ministry of Irrigation, Water Resources and Environment \n(MIWRE),  and  the  Ministry  for  Rehabilitation  and  Rural  Development  (MRRD).  The  roles  and \nfunctions of these ministries do not form a coherent structure capable of delivering sustainable \nand  efficient  use  of  natural  resources,  especially  of  water.  There  are  overlapping  functions, \nparticularly  with  regard  to  irrigation  development,  and  significant  gaps  in  the  management  of \nnatural  resources.  It  will  be  necessary  to  review  the  mandates  of  these  ministries  and  to \n\ninvolved \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nformulate  a  more  holistic  view  of  natural  resource  management,  which  will  help  to  ensure \nefficient allocation to the various users of natural resources. \n \n32. \nThe process of internalizing the new vision of the Government in reshaping the roles of \npublic  sector  institutions  at  the  central,  provincial,  and  district  levels  will  be  gradual.  In  effect, \nthere are two parallel processes required. One is to realize the vision in the form of a reformed \nadministrative structure in accordance with the above principles and the envisaged approach to \nnatural resource management. The second is the more pragmatic process of initiating change in \nthe existing agencies and reorienting the attitudes of staff to the future direction of Government \npolicy. The latter process is the more difficult to achieve, and will require clear direction from the \nformer. \n \nIn  broad  terms,  a  clear  institutional  distinction  is  required  between  agencies  with \n33. \nallocative  resource  functions  and  those  with  user  functions.  In  addition,  the  institutional \narrangements should reflect a community-based user approach. The water subsector provides \nan important example of the need for significant institutional reform. In Afghanistan, there is no \ncustodian  of  water  resources  to  set  a  limit  on  the  various  users.  To  the  extent  that  available \nresources are assessed, this is done by MIWRE, which is also the major user of water. In these \ncircumstances,  there  is  no  objective  way  in  which  sustainable  ecosystem  demands  can  be \ndetermined.  The  NDF  promotes  the  concept  of  river  basin  authorities  as  a  means  to  link \ntogether the microwatersheds managed by their respective communities. It is important that the \nconcept  of  river  basin  management  is  not  interpreted  as  a  one-dimensional  focus  on  water. \nRather, it should encompass the full range of natural resources utilized by the communities at \nthe  microwatershed  level.  In  this  way,  the  mandate  of  the  river  basin  authority  would  be \nconsistent with the range of natural resources actually being used. \n \n34. \nThe  current  structure  of  the  core  sector  ministries  reflects  past  preference  for  a  highly \ncentralized  form  of  administration,  which  is  the  antithesis  of  current  guidelines  calling  for \ndecentralized  decision-making  processes.  The  organizational  structure  incorporates  functions, \nwhich  often  include  separate  subsidiary  structures  such  as  input  supply  and  construction \ncompanies. There is considerable scope for divesting ministries of such activities and privatizing \nthe  assets.  The  fertilizer  trading  and  seed  distribution  companies,  and  the  Helmand  Valley \nConstruction Companies, are prime examples in this regard. \n \n35. \nThe field offices of the central ministries will also assume new roles and responsibilities \nin a decentralized system. In particular, these offices will require infrastructure support and staff \ntraining to undertake their new functions. There are certain key activities they should undertake, \nnamely: \n \n\nThey  will  be  key  partners  in  the  participatory  planning  process  based  on \nmicrowatersheds.  Community  representatives  (shuras)  will  play  a  major  role  in \ndetermining community needs in this regard. \nThey  will  coordinate  various  types  of  assistance,  and  guide  NGOs  and  central \ngovernment agencies toward communities most in need. \nThey should also have a role in project finance, at least to the extent of formulating \nbudgets  for  each  of  the  districts,  ensuring  that  the  benefits  from  investment  are \nequitably shared, and monitoring the flow of funds and implementation of projects. \nThey  will  also  have  a  role  to  play  in  contracting  engineering  services  directly, \nassessing proposals from the private sector and NGOs to undertake civil works, and \nensuring that only technically qualified firms and individuals receive contracts. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n47 \n\n(v) \n\nThey  will  establish  and  maintain  up-to-date  sector  databases  and  management \ninformation systems. \n\n \n36. \nGovernment  institutions  have  been  weakened  during  the  long  period  of  conflict. \nMinistries have suffered damage to buildings, loss of skilled resources and equipment in Kabul \nand  the  provinces,  and  generally  lack  the  capacity  to  undertake  their  functions.  A  number  of \nservices  are  currently  being  undertaken  by  NGOs  and  community-based  organizations.  For  a \nlong period, the institutions were not exposed to change or international best practices in public \nsector  management.  The  NDF  emphasizes  a  commitment  to  establishing  an  efficient \ninstitutional  framework  in  the  sector,  which  will  involve  streamlined  government  institutions \nproviding an appropriate policy and regulatory environment for community driven development, \nbased on private sector delivery of  services. Developing capacity to achieve this objective will \nrequire extensive human resources development and skills training. \n \n37. \nThere are currently a relatively limited number of highly skilled professionals available in \ntechnical and management areas to meet the rapidly increasing demand for such services. The \navailable resources are now fully utilized, and a strategy needs to be developed to address the \ngrowing  shortfall.  Key  aspects  will  involve  establishing  and  building  capacities  to  provide \ntraining,  reestablishing  training  institutions,  and  encouraging  the  return  of  skilled  expatriate \nAfghan professionals. The latter have the potential to provide badly needed capacity in modern \nmanagement techniques and economic/technical analysis, among other skills currently in short \nsupply in Afghanistan. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fPROGRAM FRAMEWORK \n\nDesign Summary \n\nPerformance Indicators/ \nTargets \n\nMonitoring \nMechanisms \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n \n\n \n\nPer capita incomes reach levels \nof neighboring countries within \n5 years \n \nAgricultural exports restored to \nlevels of 20 years ago as \npercentage of GDP within 10 \nyears \n \nIrrigation efficiency levels reach \n40% within 10 years \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIncreased participation of \nprivate sector in agricultural \nproduction, marketing, and \nservice provision \n \nGovernment capacity for \nsustainable natural resource \nmanagement \n \nGovernment capacity for \nrational sector policy making \nand planning \n \nRestructuring/divestment of all \nagricultural SOEs \n \nImproved food security for all \nrural households \n \n\nAgriculture sector growth rate \naccelerates \n \nAdministrative and support \nfunctions more effective \n \nIrrigation system efficiency and \nsustainability of natural \nresource use improves \n \n \nLand use equity and efficiency \nimprove \n \n\nGovernment statistics \n \nGovernment progress \nreports \n \n \nADB review missions \n \nPostprogram \nevaluation \n \nStakeholder \nconsultations \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nADB program \ncompletion report \n \nGovernment \npromulgations / acts / \ndecrees \n \nADB review missions \n \nTripartite meeting \n \nAid agency reports \n \nStakeholder \nworkshop \n\nGovernment sustains commitment \nto institution building and policy \nreform \n \nMaintenance of political stability \n \nSustained improvement in the \nsecurity situation \n \n\nGovernment sustains commitment \nto institution building and policy \nreform  \n \nTechnical assistance is \nimplemented effectively \n \nMarket reforms proceed smoothly \n \nCommunity-based resource \nmanagement works effectively \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nGovernment commitment to the \nreform process \n \nExternal assistance (especially \nfrom World Bank, IMF, EU and \nmajor bilateral services) in \ngovernance and the financial \nsector, transport and energy is \nappropriate and forthcoming \n \nRisk: Government unable to \nimplement agreed-upon reforms \n\n48 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\nGoal \n\nPromote agricultural growth \nand poverty reduction \nthrough support for market-\nbased policy reforms, \npublic infrastructure \ninvestment, and \ninstitutional reform and \norganizational capacity \nbuilding  \n\nPurpose \n\nEnhance opportunities for \nsector revival by \naddressing key policy, \ninstitutional and \norganizational constraints \nto the efficient and effective \nfunctioning of agriculture \nand the sustainable use of \nnatural resources \n\nOutputs \n\nSound policy and planning \nframework developed \n \nEfficient and effective \nsector institutions created \n \nCapacity built for \nmanagement and planning \nin key natural resource \nareas \n \nComprehensive land policy \nand land titling system \ndeveloped \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n49 \n\nMonitoring \nMechanisms \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nDesign Summary \n\nFive-year irrigation \ninvestment program \ndeveloped  \n \nStrategy and action plan for \ngreater commercialization \nof agriculture prepared \n \nEfficiency of sector support \nservices improved \n \nEfficiency of agricultural \ncommodity markets \nimproved \n \nSOE restructuring plans \nprepared \n \n(See policy matrix for \ndetails) \nActivities \n\nPreparation and \nGovernment approval of \npriority policy reforms, \ninstitutional and \norganizational frameworks, \nstrategies, and time-bound \naction plans.  \n \n(Specific reform measures \nare detailed in the policy \nmatrix) \nInputs \n\nADB Agriculture Sector \nProgram Loan \n\nPerformance Indicators/ \nTargets \nEconomically and socially viable \nirrigation projects identified \n \n \nPrivate investment in agriculture \nincreased and poppy cultivation \nreduced \n \nAccess to rural finance and \nmodern technology improves \n \nInterregional price differentials \nreflect reasonable margins;

Tadao Chino \nPresident \nAsian Development Bank \nManila, Philippines \n \nDear President Chino, \n \n \nOn behalf of the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan, I would like to thank you for \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  vision  and  leadership  in  assisting  Afghanistan\u2019s \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction.  ADB\u2019s  bold  commitment  at  the  Tokyo  Donors  Conference  in \nJanuary  2002  to  provide  $500 million  in  concessional  assistance  by  June  2004  undoubtedly \nencouraged  other  members  of  the  international  community  to  step  forward  with  generous \nfinancial  commitments  of  their  own.  As  we  discussed  a  few  months  ago  in  Dubai,  it  is  critical \nthat  ADB  make  every  effort  to  ensure  that  the  commitments  it  has  made  to  Afghanistan  are \nfulfilled within the envisaged time frame. I also trust and expect that ADB will show similar vision \nand leadership in announcing its pledge at the Berlin Conference later this month. \n\nIn return, I can assure you that the assistance we have received thus far is operational \nand facilitating progress toward macroeconomic stability and structural reform. In particular, the \neconomy  has  shown  strong  signs  of  recovery  over  the  past  two  years.  Real  GDP  (excluding \nopium  production)  is  estimated  to  have  grown  20-30%  per  annum,  driven  by  rehabilitation \nactivities  and  favorable  rains,  while  prices  have  remained  stable  following  the  successful \ncompletion of a currency conversion early last year. In addition, I note with great satisfaction the \npassage last year of the Central Bank Law and the Banking Law, which was supported through \nthe ADB-financed Postconflict Multisector Program Loan (PMPL). As a result of efforts such as \nthese, both the first and second tranches under the loan were released on time. \n\nDespite \n\nthese  encouraging  developments,  Afghanistan  will  continue \n\nto  require \nsubstantial international assistance in the coming years to facilitate continued stability, recovery, \nand  growth.  As  presented  in  our  recent  report,  \u201cSecuring  Afghanistan\u2019s  Future,\u201d  we  estimate \nthat nearly $30 billion in external financing will be needed over the next 7 years to achieve our \nrehabilitation  and  growth  objectives.  Although  external  assistance  has  been  sizable,  a \ncomparison  of  per  capita  aid  levels  with  other  recent  post-conflict  countries  suggests  that  aid \nflows to Afghanistan up to this point have been relatively low. Continued strong support from the \ninternational community will be needed not only to help our economy recover, but also to avoid \na reversion to violence and the production of opium, as evidenced by the reemergence of poppy \ncultivation and the continuing difficulties in the security situation. In doing so, it will be important \nto  ensure  that  Afghanistan\u2019s  debt  is  sustainable  over  the  medium  term,  and  that  future \ngenerations  are  not  unduly  and  unfairly  burdened.  Development  assistance  must  therefore \ncontinue to be provided on highly concessional terms. \n\nThe  time  is  now  opportune  to  broaden  implementation  of  our  National  Development \nFramework  (NDF),  particularly  Pillar  2  relating  to  physical  reconstruction  and  natural  resource \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n51 \n\nmanagement.  In  this  context,  the  Government  is  taking  the  initiative  to  introduce  policy, \ninstitutional, and organizational reforms to rehabilitate the agriculture sector and strengthen its \ncapacity  for  natural  resource  management.  With  sound  water  resource  management  and  the \nintroduction of sustainable resource management practices in other areas, we believe that the \nagriculture  sector  can  be  revitalized  to  its  former  strength  and  put  on  a  path  of  accelerated \ngrowth. More than any other sector, agriculture is at the core of economic recovery and poverty \nreduction given that more than 80% of the Afghan people are dependent on farming and other \nrural-based activities for their livelihoods. The sector has suffered badly as a result of the civil \nconflict  and  drought,  but  it  must  be  revived  rapidly  and  in  a  sustainable  manner  if  deeper \ninroads are to be made in reducing poverty.  \n\nThe proposed Agriculture Sector Program is therefore a very timely joint initiative of the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  The  Government  has  formulated  the  Program  as  described  below \nthrough  intensive  dialogue  with  ADB  and  active  participation  of  other  stakeholders  and \ndevelopment partners. The Program addresses the key policy, institutional, and organizational \nconstraints  to  the  efficient  and  effective  functioning  of  agriculture  and  the  sustainable  use  of \nnatural resources. As was the case with the PMPL, program monitoring and implementation will \nbe supported by the activities of ADB-funded advisors working in the concerned ministries and \ndepartments  under  capacity-building  technical  assistance  (TA)  initiated  in  2002\u20132003  and \nthrough  the  TA  piggybacked  to  the  loan.  The  Program\u2019s  proposed  reform  measures  are \ndescribed below, and are also set out in the policy matrix attached to this letter. \n\nIn providing financial support for the proposed Program, we recommend a loan amount \nof $55 million on concessional Asian Development Fund (ADF) terms. As you are aware, ADF \nloan  terms  for  the  PMPL  and  Emergency  Infrastructure  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation \nProject were modified on an exceptional basis to increase loan concessionality and reduce the \ndebt burden to a more manageable level. Our situation remains extremely difficult, as evidenced \nby  the  pervasive  poverty  in  the  countryside  and  the  continuing  challenges  we  face  in  nation \nbuilding and forging a national identity. In light of these challenges, it remains difficult for many \nAfghans to foresee the economic basis to support an increased debt burden. Continued access \nto  ADF  loan  funds  at  these  modified  terms  therefore  remains  essential  for  us  to  maintain  the \npolitical consensus necessary to borrow from ADB.  \n\nSector Policy Framework and Institutions \n\nfor \n\nreviving  agricultural  growth  and  promoting  sustainable  natural \n\n \nIn  order  to  develop  a  sound  policy  and  planning  framework  for  agriculture  and  natural \nresource management, we must forge a common vision for the development of the sector. The \nkey  sector  ministries\u2014the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Animal  Husbandry  (MAAH),  Ministry  of \nIrrigation, Water Resources and Environment (MIWRE), and Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and \nDevelopment (MRRD)\u2014have prepared a joint statement outlining key priorities, strategies and \npolicies \nresource \nmanagement. The statement clarifies the respective roles of the public and private sector in the \ndevelopment  process  together  with  the  specific  functions  and  responsibilities  of  each  sector \nministry. The sector strategy and framework embodied in the joint statement is anchored in the \nNDF  and  the  technical  annex  on  natural  resource  management  in  \u201cSecuring  Afghanistan\u2019s \nFuture,\u201d  and  is  aimed  at  creating  a  vibrant,  export-oriented  and  private  sector  led  agricultural \nsector. The core sector ministries will now proceed to prepare time-bound plans setting out key \nmilestones in the implementation of the sector framework. \n\n \nWhile considerable progress has been made over the past 2 years in rehabilitating core \ncentral  government  facilities  and  restoring  basic  operations,  we  recognize  that  the institutional \ncapacity  of  our  sector  ministries  to  undertake  public  functions  and  deliver  services  remains  a \nserious  constraint  on  agricultural  development  and  sustainable  natural  resource  management. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nMoreover, the historical roles and functions of MAAH, MIWRE, and MRRD are not appropriate \nto  delivering  sustainable  and  efficient  use  of  natural  resources,  particularly  of  water,  or  to \ncarrying out the more decentralized institutional approach envisaged in our NDF. Therefore, the \ncore  agricultural  ministries  must  develop  a  new  vision  of  their  future  role  encompassing  a \nfundamental  restructuring  of  their  institutional  structures  and  mandates  if  they  are  to  be \nsuccessful  in  leading  the  recovery  and  reconstruction  efforts  in  the  sector.  The  Public \nAdministration  Reform  and  Economic  Management  program  in  the  NDB  approved  in  March \n2003 provides the strategic framework for the administrative and organizational reforms. \n\nInstitutional  restructuring  and  reorganization  of  the  sector  ministries  has  already  been \ninitiated  through  the  work  of  the  Administrative  Reforms  and  Civil  Service  Commission \n(ARCSC). MAAH, MIWRE, and MRRD have now obtained approval for stage 1 of their Priority \nReforms  and  Restructuring  (PRR)  for  key  departments.  This  is  being  followed  by  the \npreparation  of  time-bound  implementation  plans  for  their  reform  and  restructuring  to  secure \nstage  2  approval  of  their  PRR  proposals.  Simultaneously,  time-bound  action  plans  are  being \nprepared  to  strengthen  the  field  offices  of  the  core  sector  ministries,  with  implementation  to \nbegin  later  this  year.  Studies  have  also  been  initiated  to  assess  the  human  resources  and \ninstitutional  development  needs  of  both  the  central  ministries  and  field  offices,  which  will  be \nfollowed by the formulation of time-bound action plans. In addition, the Government recognizes \nthat  there  are  overlapping  mandates  and  functions  among  the  sector  ministries.  In  this \nconnection,  ARCSC  will  prepare  a  plan  to  consolidate  the  sector  ministries  and  reduce  the \nnumber of their departments within the coming year. \n\nThe  Government  is  also  continuing  with  efforts  to  improve  fiscal  management  and \ntransparency  in  the  sector  ministries.  To  this  end,  MAAH,  MIWRE,  and  MRRD  prepared  and \nsubmitted  detailed  recurrent  and  development  budget  plans  for  SY1383.  The  Government  will \nwork  to  ensure  that  their  future  budget  submissions  are  consistent  with  their  reform  and \nrestructuring plans, and that they continue to receive sufficient budgetary allocations to carry out \ntheir new mandates. \n \nNatural Resource Management \n\nAs the repeated droughts in Afghanistan and dependence on food aid indicate, water is \nby  far  our  most  precious  resource,  and  thus  must  be  managed  in  a  judicious  and  sustainable \nmanner.  MIWRE  has  initiated  a  comprehensive  water  resources  assessment,  which  includes \nefforts  to  build  a  water  resource  database  and  hydrological  networks,  in  order  to  improve  the \ninformation base for our future planning efforts. These activities are also paving the way for the \nformulation  of  an  interim  water  policy,  which  will  be  submitted  shortly  to  the  Cabinet  for  its \napproval,  and  subsequent  reform  of  the  1981  Water  Law.  River  basins  are  among  our  most \nimportant  natural  resources,  and  their  sustainable  management  for  irrigation  and  power \ngeneration  is  critical  to  the  prosperity  of  the  country.  International  experience  has  shown  that \nriver  basin  organizations  are  the  best  instrument  for  managing  water  resources,  and  MIWRE \nhas initiated pilot studies toward the establishment of at least two such organizations before the \nend of 2004. International experience has also shown that operation and maintenance as well \nas  management  of  irrigation  systems  is  best  done  by  the  water  users  themselves,  which \nMIWRE  has  adopted  as  a  guiding  principle  in  formulating  its  irrigation  investment  program. \nMIWRE will also develop a strategy to develop and manage our groundwater resources, which \ncould serve as an important safeguard during times of drought.  \n\nAssessment  studies  have  also  started  with  regard  to  livestock,  and  forestry  and \nrangeland  resources.  Livestock  are  an  integral  part  of  traditional  farming  systems  in \nAfghanistan,  but  herds  have  been  decimated  in  recent  years  by  drought  and  disease.  A \nlivestock inventory has already been completed and MAAH has initiated an assessment study \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n53 \n\nas an input into the formulation of a livestock development strategy. MAAH will also establish a \nlivestock database and monitoring system to facilitate future planning activities in the subsector. \nForests  and  rangelands  also  play  a  vital  role  in  rural  livelihoods,  but  have  been  severely \ndegraded  over  the  past  few  decades.  MAAH  is  carrying  out  a  resource  inventory  and \nassessment that will provide a basis for establishing a database and monitoring system as an \ninterim step toward developing a comprehensive policy on forestry and rangeland management. \nThe draft policy will be submitted to Cabinet and a public consultation process initiated on it in \nthe  coming  year.  Ongoing  work  developing  environmental  protection  legislation  will  also  be \ncarried forward under the Program. In this connection, MIWRE has prepared an initial draft of an \nEnvironmental  Protection  Act  that  is  currently  under  review.  The  draft  legislation  will \nsubsequently be revised and submitted to Cabinet for approval by the end of this year. \n\nEfficient and productive use of land depends on clear and unambiguous land titles. We \nmust develop a policy and institutional framework through which land-use efficiency and equity \nwill  be  improved.  This  will  be  addressed  under  the  Program  through  the  development  of  a \ncomprehensive national land policy and titling system that is fair, efficient, and sustainable. The \nobjective in this regard will be to create a system that (i) increases tenure security for farmers \nand  other  landholders;  (ii) facilitates  efficient  land  transactions  and  administration;  and \n(iii) provides farmers and other landholders with greater control over land management through \na full range of market choices.  \n\n \nTo  this  end,  I  wish  to  inform  you  that  a  high-level  commission  has  been  appointed  to \ndevelop  a  comprehensive  land  policy.  The  commission,  which  comprises  the  MAAH  (chair); \nMinistry of Finance (MOF); Ministry of Mines and Industry; MRRD; MIWRE; and the Department \nof Cadastral Survey under the Office of the President will be charged with the task of developing \na draft land policy for submission to Cabinet within the coming year. In parallel, an imterministry \nworking  group  has  also  been  appointed  and  has  initiated  studies  to  identify  an  appropriate \ninstitutional framework for land administration. We expect that the working group will be able to \nformulate a strategy and time-bound action plan for an appropriate land titling system and land \ndatabase within the coming year. Given their importance, the Directorate of Land in MAAH and \nthe  Department  of  Cadastral  Survey  under  the  Office  of  the  President  together  with  all  the \nrelevant ministries are working jointly on these endeavors. \n \nSector Investment Program \n\n \nWe recognize the need to develop sound sector investment programs, particularly in the \nwater  resources  sector,  upon  which  future  increases  in  agricultural  productivity  will  primarily \ndepend.  The  bulk  of  our  irrigation  facilities  have  been  seriously  damaged,  with  overall  system \nefficiency  rated  at  only  25%.  MIWRE  with  the  assistance  of  ADB  and  other  development \npartners  has  initiated  work  toward  identifying  economically  viable  investment  options  for \nirrigation  development  and  rehabilitation,  drawing  on  the  results  of  the  irrigation  system \ninventory. Work has been initiated to develop a program for rehabilitation of medium- and large-\nscale  irrigation  schemes,  and  selection  criteria  developed  taking  into  account  land  ownership \nand  titling  considerations  as  well  as  an  equitable  distribution  of  benefits  along  gender  lines. \nMIWRE  is  also  developing  screening  procedures  to  ensure  that  the  proposed  development \nprogram is consistent with the safeguard policies of the multilateral financial institutions. It has \nalso  been  agreed  that  MIWRE  will  develop  procedures  for  the  transfer  of  ownership  and \nmanagement of irrigation facilities to water users.  \n\nThe future of agriculture in Afghanistan depends on enterprise diversification and greater \ncommercialization. This will require the promotion of high-value crops and livestock enterprises, \nfor  which  adoption  will  need  effective  regulatory  frameworks,  efficient  marketing  systems,  and \nvery  active  participation  of  the  private  sector.  This  is  important  not  only  to  raise  farm  incomes \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nand  reduce  rural  poverty,  but  also  is  an  important  alternative  to  the  resurgence  of  opium \nproduction.  While  interdiction  efforts  will  have  to  become  more  effective,  efforts  to  identify \ninvestment opportunities in high-value cash crops and agro-based industries as alternatives to \npoppy cultivation must also be stepped up. MAAH, the Ministry of Light Industry and Foodstuffs \n(MLIFS), and the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) have initiated studies on the options available to \nfacilitate  greater  commercialization  of  agriculture,  particularly  through  the  development  of \nhorticultural  crops.  This  will  include  a  review  of  the  enabling  environment  for  private  sector \nparticipation  in  agricultural  activities  as  well  as  agronomic  and  financial  assessments  of \npromising  alternative  crops.  Strategies  and  time-bound  action  plans  to  promote  greater \ncommercialization  of  agriculture  and  identify  livelihood  alternatives  to  poppy  cultivation  will  be \ndeveloped based on the results of these studies.  \n\n \n\nSector Support Services \n\nThe Government recognizes that efficient and cost-effective support service systems are \nalso  essential  for  raising  on-farm  productivity.  Our  national  Agricultural  Research  and \nTechnology Transfer System (ARTTS) is largely nonfunctional after two decades of civil conflict. \nWhile  Afghan  farmers  are  generally  aware  of  the  benefits  of  modern  agro-inputs,  the  present \ninput  delivery  system  lacks  effective  quality  assurance  and  certification  systems,  as  well  as  a \nregulatory  framework  for  agricultural  inputs.  Development  of  effective  quality  assurance  and \ncertification  systems  will  also  be  necessary  on  the  output  side  if  our  agricultural  produce  is  to \ngain  entry  to  overseas  markets.  To  address  these  constraints,  studies  have  been  initiated  to \nidentify appropriate input and output certification and quality assurance systems, the institutional \nrequirements for a regulatory framework for agricultural inputs and outputs, and the options for \nestablishing  an  efficient  and  cost-effective  ARTTS.  Recommendations  and  time-bound \nimplementation plans will be developed based on the results of these studies. MAAH has also \ninitiated work on a modern seed law, and will develop a strategy and time-bound action plan for \nestablishing a national seed bank in order to preserve the indigenous gene pool. \n\nIn a society that has lost most of its personal savings and assets, developing access to \ncredit  will  be  a  crucial  element  in  reviving  agricultural  growth.  Access  to  short-term  finance  in \nparticular will be key if farmers are to afford quality seeds and fertilizer. While a mechanism has \nbeen established for microcredit through the Microfinance Investment and Support Facility and \nNGOs  operate  various  credit  programs,  their  coverage  is  limited  and  does  not  meet  the  full \nspectrum  of  rural  credit  needs.  Moneylenders  and  hawala  traders  also  provide  some  finance, \nbut at very high interest rates. In light of this institutional gap, the MOF in association with Da \nAfghanistan  Bank  (DAB)  and  MRRD  has  initiated  rural  finance  assessment  studies  to  identify \ninstitutional  options  to  meet  rural  credit  needs.  Time-bound  action  plans  will  be  developed  to \nimplement the recommendations that emerge from the studies. Gender-specific constraints and \nopportunities for accessing credit will also be addressed in this context. \n \nAgricultural Commodity Markets \n\n \nEfficient  agricultural  commodity  markets  are  another  essential  precondition  for  the \ndevelopment  of  a  competitive,  export-oriented  agricultural sector.  A  key  policy  objective  under \nthe  Program  is  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  agricultural  commodity  markets.  In  this  context,  I \nwish  to  confirm  the  Government\u2019s  intent  under  the  Program  (i)  to  remove  all  legal  and \ninstitutional  restrictions  on  the  movement  of  agricultural  commodities  (including  inputs)  except \nthose related to standard tariffs, phytosanitary conditions, environmental protection and control, \nand drug trafficking; (ii) not to introduce government subsidies or price supports on agricultural \nproducts; and (iii) to remove all formal and informal restrictions on private sector participation in \nagricultural activities, including production, processing, marketing, and external trade. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n55 \n\nA  large  share  of  agricultural  production  in  Afghanistan  takes  place  in  areas  that  are \n \nrelatively  inaccessible  and  remote  from  market  outlets  and  input  supplies.  In  particular,  the \nnetwork  of  farm-to-market  roads  and  the  agricultural  marketing  infrastructure  have  been  badly \ndegraded  by  25  years  of  civil  conflict.  The  isolation  of  farming  communities  raises  production \ncosts, lowers farm income, and perpetuates rural poverty. MAAH has initiated studies to identify \noptions  to  improve  integration  of  agricultural  markets,  including  the  strengthening  of  farm-to-\nmarket linkages. A strategy and time-bound action plan will be prepared to improve integration \nof agricultural markets based on the results of the studies. In the interim, we are moving ahead \nwith a reconstruction program for farm-to-market roads. \n \nState-Owned Enterprises   \n\nConsistent with the policy enunciated in the NDF, the Government is firmly committed to \nrestructuring  its  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  including  divestment  of  its  ownership  stake. \nAccordingly,  an  inventory  of  SOEs  has  been  published  and  time-bound  restructuring  plans  for \nagricultural SOEs under the control of MAAH and MLIFS will be prepared to carry forward our \ncommitments  in  this  regard.  To  facilitate  implementation  of  these  plans,  the  Government  will \ndevelop a strategy and procedures for restructuring and divestment of SOEs, which will include \nprovisions  for  market  valuations  of  assets  to  ensure  that  the  process  is  transparent  and  fair, \nmaximizes  returns  to  the  Government,  and  facilitates  private  sector  investment.  To  signal  the \nGovernment\u2019s  strong  commitment  to  SOE  restructuring,  we  have  dissolved  the  Agriculture \nDevelopment Bank and initiated divestment of the Fertilizer Trading Company. The Government \nhas  also  initiated  work  to  commercialize  the  operations  of  the  Improved  Seed  Enterprise  and \nHelmand Valley Construction Company. \n \nConclusion \n\n \nI  wish  to  reaffirm  our  request  for  ADB  to  proceed  with  its  financial  support  for  the \nproposed Agriculture Sector Program. I appreciate the consultative approach adopted by ADB \nin preparing the policy reform agenda and can state unequivocally that Government ownership \nof the proposed program is very strong. Given our close association with ADB officials, and our \nfrequent  exchanges  on  sector  policies  and  strategies,  we  were  able  to  quickly  conclude \nnegotiations on a mutually agreed policy matrix. The extensive consultation that has taken place \nduring  Program  preparation  also  ensures  that  ADB\u2019s  assistance  is  well  coordinated  with  the \nactivities of our other development partners. \n\nI am pleased to inform you that the Government has moved on several fronts over the \npast  few  months  with  respect  to  policy  and  institutional  reforms  in  the  agriculture  sector. \nAccordingly,  we  have  been  able  to  achieve  all  the  first  tranche  conditions  included  in  the \nattached policy matrix. All relevant documentation and other supportive evidence to substantiate \nthis  have  been  provided  to  ADB.  The  envisaged  comprehensive  agriculture  sector  reform \nprogram  is  an  outcome  of  the  close  cooperation  between  the  Transitional  Islamic  State  of \nAfghanistan  and  ADB.  I  trust  that  ADB  will  approve  the  loan  expeditiously  and  that  our \npartnership will continue to deepen in a most favorable and constructive manner.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\nPolicy Objectives \n\nframework and \nestablish efficient sector \ninstitutions. \n\n1.1  Prepare an agricultural \n\nand natural resource \nmanagement strategy \nand policy framework. \n\n1.2  Rehabilitate and \n\nrestructure sector \nministries. \n\nAGRICULTURE SECTOR PROGRAM: \nPOLICY MATRIX \n\nActions Prior to First Tranche Release \n(tranche release conditions are in bold) \n\nActions Prior to Second Tranche Release \n(tranche release conditions are in bold) \n\nProgram  goal:  Promote  agricultural  growth  and  poverty  reduction  through  support  for  market-based  policy  reforms, \nformulation of public infrastructure investment programs, and institutional reform and organizational capacity building. \n\nProgram purpose: Enhance opportunities for sector revival by addressing key policy, institutional and organizational \nconstraints to the efficient and effective functioning of agriculture and the sustainable use of natural resources. \nA.

Yes \n\n \n\n \n\n \nSector identified as a national priority in country \npoverty partnership agreement?  Not applicable \n\n \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Afghanistan: \n \nThe proposed program directly supports pillars 2 and 3 of the Government\u2019s National Development Framework \n(NDF), which also serves as the country\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. Agriculture and other rural-based activities \nare the main source of income and employment in Afghanistan, providing livelihoods for nearly 85% of the \npopulation. By improving rural livelihoods, the proposed Program will contribute directly to poverty reduction and \nlead to improvement in a range of other social and economic indicators in Afghanistan. \n\nPoverty Analysis                                       Proposed Classification: Poverty intervention \n\nB. \n                                                                                 Thematic: Economic growth \n \nNo poverty assessment has been prepared and no poverty partnership agreement (PPA) has been signed. \nInitiating and completing work on the preparation of a PPA will be synchronized with the preparation of a full \ncountry strategy and program (CSP), presently scheduled for 2005. Background work for the full CSP, including \ndata collection and preparation of sector roadmaps, was initiated last year. \n \nReliable statistics on poverty are not available for Afghanistan. However, various estimates place the proportion of \nthe population living below the threshold of $1 a day or consuming below the minimum requirement of the Food \nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) of 2,453 kilocalories a day per capita at 60\u201380%. \nMoreover, the average life expectancy is only about 40 years; nearly two thirds of adults are illiterate, and four \nfifths of adult women; 70% of the population are malnourished; and in 1999 less than one third of Afghan children \nwere enrolled in school. Particularly vulnerable are those without any source of food production, employment, or \nincome. Nonmaterial poverty as reflected in physical and social insecurity; isolation; marginalization; alienation; \nand ethnic, religious, and gender discrimination pushes many Afghans further down the poverty ladder. \n \nNo systematic study has been done on the factors contributing to poverty in Afghanistan, but available information \nsuggests  that  poverty  is  associated  with  low  economic  growth  and  the  collapse  of  income-generating  and \nemployment  opportunities  due  to  the  long  period  of  war  and  civil  strife,  particularly  in  rural  areas.  Other  factors \nlikely pertain to the distinctive features of the agro ecological environment (e.g., frequent droughts), state of natural \nresource  degradation,  land  ownership  and  tenure,  loss  of  livestock  and  destruction  of  orchards,  access  to  water \nand  agricultural  inputs,  availability  of  off-farm  employment  opportunities,  refugee/displacement  status,  gender, \nethnicity, household status (e.g., with female head or not, educational attainment), and physical disability. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \nStakeholder analysis?  The proposed Program was formulated through intensive dialogue with the Government \nand the active participation of other stakeholders and development partners, in a process that began in early 2002 \nwith ADB\u2019s lead role in the multifunding agency Comprehensive Needs Assessment for the Agriculture and Natural \nResource Sector. Extensive consultations were undertaken with the concerned line ministries in the course of \npreparing the needs assessment and during program preparation. Discussions also took place with all major \ninternational agencies and funding agencies, and with key nongovernment organizations (NGOs) working in the \nsector.  \n \nParticipation strategy? The NDF signals the Government\u2019s commitment to pursuing a broad-based and \nparticipatory growth strategy. A number of elements in the Program also seek to make the reconstruction and \ndevelopment process more participatory. These include provisions to transfer management as well as operation \nand maintenance of irrigation systems to water users, strengthening field offices of the core sector ministries so \nthat they are more responsive to the felt needs at the local level, and reorienting the agricultural research and \ntechnology transfer system to be more demand driven and participatory in its approach. Finally, despite enormous \nsecurity, logistical, and communications constraints, the Government is committed to participatory processes, as \nreflected in the loya jirga and the public consultations and information sharing being undertaken to prepare the \nnew Constitution. \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 10  \n\n \nD. \n\n \n\nResettlement \n\nNone \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\nNone \n\nLabor \n\nSignificant \n\nSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\nSignificant/ \nNonsignificant/ \nNone \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \n \nPlan Required \n\nThe  irrigation  investment  program  to  be  developed \nunder  the  Program  will  focus  on  rehabilitation  of \nexisting  systems  rather  than  construction  of  new \nsystems  that  might  give  rise  to  displacement.  No \nsale  of  government  land  as  core  or  noncore  assets \nis  envisaged  through  restructuring  of  state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs) . \n\nNo \n\ntraditional \n\nNo  adverse  effects  on  indigenous  peoples  are \nexpected.  Specific  measures  to  benefit  vulnerable \nlivestock  herders,  and \ntribal  groups, \nnomadic  pastoralists  will  be \nthe \ntaken  under \nProgram. These include provision of equal access to \nland  resources  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nintegration  of \nIndigenous  Peoples;  and \ncustomary tenure into the new land policy and policy \non forestry and rangeland management. \n\nthe \n\ngreater \n\ncommercialization \n\nEmployment  creation  through  enhanced  on-farm \nof \nproductivity, \nagricultural  production,  promotion  of  agro-based \nindustry,  and  greater  devolution  of  agricultural \nsupport  services,  is  expected  to  be  significant  over \nthe  longer  term.  In  the  short  run,  retrenchment  of \nemployees through restructuring of sector ministries \nand agricultural SOEs could result in unemployment. \nThese  effects  will  be  mitigated  by  severance \npayments and job placement efforts. For example, it \nis  expected  that  retrenched  technical  staff  from  the \nAgricultural Development Bank will find employment \nin  other  commercial  banks  and  nonbank  financial \ninstitutions. \n\nNo plan required, but \nspecific measures will \nbe taken to assist \nindigenous peoples \n\nProcedures developed \nunder the Program for \nrestructuring and \ndivestment of SOEs \nwill incorporate \nprovisions to address \nretrenchment and other \nsocial costs that may \narise \n\nAffordability \n\nNone \n\nThere are at present no formal government \nsubsidies on agricultural inputs or outputs. \n\nNo \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n\nSignificant \n\nWeak  institutional  capacity  may  cause  problems  in \neffective  service  delivery.
