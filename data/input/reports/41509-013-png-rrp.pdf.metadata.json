It  will  build  on  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  experience  in \nstrengthening health service delivery in rural areas of PNG.1 The project will cover two districts in \neach of the following eight provinces: Eastern Highlands, East Sepik, Enga, Milne Bay, Western \nHighlands, West New Britain, Morobe, and the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.2  \n \n\n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  government's  long-term  Vision  2050;  Development  Strategic  Plan,  2010\u20132030;  and \nMedium Term Development Plan, 2011\u20132015 aim to transform PNG\u2019s health system to achieve \nthe  Millennium  Development  Goals  for  health  and  improve  PNG\u2019s  ranking  in  the  human \ndevelopment index.3 In support of the government\u2019s approach and in line with ADB\u2019s operational \nplan  for  health, 4 ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  PNG,  2011\u20132015,  which  recognizes \nissues of fragility in PNG, includes health as a priority area.5 \n \n4. \nThe  health  status  of  the  population  of  PNG  has  deteriorated  since  1980s  with  severe \nneglect  of  the  health  system,  especially  in  rural  areas,  where  87%  of  the  population  lives.  An \nestimated 40% of rural health facilities have closed or are not fully functioning. Limited resources, \ndeteriorating  infrastructure,  poorly  trained  staff,  and  inadequate  and  declining  access  to  basic \nhealth services are among the main reasons for the decline. \n  \nThe country has widespread poverty and weak health indicators, particularly for maternal \n5. \nand  child  health.  The  infant  mortality  rate  is  57  per  1,000  live  births  and  the  maternal  mortality \nrate  is  733  per  100,000  live  births.6 The  main  health  problems  continue  to  be  communicable \ndiseases, with malaria, tuberculosis, diarrheal diseases, and acute respiratory disease being the \nmajor  causes  of  morbidity  and  mortality.  PNG  has  a  generalized  HIV  epidemic,  driven \npredominantly  by  heterosexual  intercourse.  The  epidemiological  profile  of  PNG,  with  a  heavy \nburden  of  communicable  disease,  indicates  that  significant  gains  in  health  outcomes  could  be \n\n  \n\n                                                \n1   ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance: ADB. 2009.  Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for \n\nStrengthening Rural Primary Health Services Delivery.  Manila.  \n\n2   The government, in consultation with ADB, selected the provinces based on the criteria on health needs and service \ncapacity  in  provinces.  The  Department  of  Health  (DOH)  selected  these  eight  provinces  for  phase  1.  Further \nexpansion  of  the  project  will  be  considered  at  midterm  review.  DOH  has  selected  two  participating  districts  per \nprovince based upon agreed selection criteria. The government will select project sites in each district in accordance \nwith agreed selection criteria for outputs 2, 3, 4, and 5. A map is included to demonstrate the project\u2019s coverage and \nthe distribution of its resources and benefits. \n\n3   PNG ranks 137th of 169 countries in the 2010 human development index.

While \nsome hospital services (e.g., for maternal complications) are essential, more than 80% of health \nproblems can be addressed adequately and at lower cost through the effective delivery of PHC. \nThe  current  poor  health  status  of  the  rural  population  points  to  a  weak  PHC  system  that  lacks \noutreach  services  such  as  for  child  immunization  and  providing  women  with  the  basic  support \nrequired for safe delivery. \n \n6. \nProvinces  and  districts  are  responsible  for  delivering  health  care  services  through \nhospitals,  health  centers,  health  subcenters,  community  health  post  (CHP),  and  aid  posts.  The \n1998  Organic  Law  on  provincial  and  local-level  governments  significantly  decentralized \nresponsibility for delivering health care services to the provinces and districts. 7 However, the law \ndid not adequately address how to implement the changes. In the health sector, only operational \nresponsibilities  have  been  devolved,  while capital  investments  remain  centralized  in  the  public \ninvestment  program.   Provinces  are  allocated  a percentage  of net government revenue  through \nstaffing  and  health  sector  functional  grants,  which  cover  operational  costs  but  not  capital \ninvestment  costs.  Resources,  authority,  and  competency  are \nthus  poorly  aligned  with \ndecentralized responsibility.8 \n \n7. \nTo overcome this misalignment, three provinces have so far exercised the option outlined \nin the 2007 Provincial Health Authorities Act to establish their own provincial health authorities.9 \nIn  addition,  the  government,  recognizing  that  it  needs  to  prioritize  health  service  delivery  in \ndistricts  and  communities,  has  recently  developed  the  concept  of  the  CHP  in  2010.  CHPs  will \nprovide  services  at  the  outer  perimeter  of  the  health    system.  Over  time,  the  government  will \ntransform existing aid posts and health sub-centers into a service able to meet the requirements \nof the National Health Plan (NHP) 2011\u20132010. \n \n8. \nADB  has  provided  support  for  the  PNG  health  sector  since  the  1980s.  The  completed \nHealth  Sector  Development  Program 10  established  the  Health  Sector  Improvement  Program \n(HSIP)  trust  account  in  1998,  which  became  a  major  mechanism  for  administering  extended \ndevelopment assistance to the health sector.11 \n \nThe    HIV/AIDS  Prevention  and  Control  in  Rural  Development  Enclaves  Project 12 has \n9. \nsuccessfully  built  innovative  partnerships  with  non-state service  providers  to  improve  rural  PHC \nservice  delivery.  Under  that  project,  local  health  authorities  in  eight  provinces  established \npartnerships with six large private companies to improve more than 100 rural health facilities and \ntrained  health  workers  and  communities  in  preventing  HIV/AIDS  transmission,  significantly \nincreasing the number of PHC beneficiaries in project areas. \n \n10. \nBuilding  on  the  lessons  and  experience  of  the  existing  project,  the  proposed  project  will \nsupport  the  government  in  implementing  NHP,  as  it  relates  to  rural  health.  The  project  will \nestablish  and  develop  partnerships  between  state  and  other  health  care  service  providers, \nincluding the private sector, churches, nongovernment organizations, and civil society, working at \nthe provincial and district level to strengthen the rural PHC system.  \n\n                                                \n7  Government of PNG. 1998.

The project will expand \nthe  coverage  and  improve the  quality  of  PHC  services for the rural  population by  strengthening \nthe rural health system at the provincial and district level.  \n \n12. \nThe project will be implemented under the sector-wide approach currently in place for the \nhealth  sector. 13  To  avoid  replicating  government  functions,  the  project  will  use  government \nsystems whenever possible, and the government will be responsible for all facility recurrent costs. \nThe  project  will  focus  on  infrastructure  and training that  can  help the government  deliver  health  \nservices more efficiently and effectively,14 building on the strengths of existing health institutions \nrun by the government and others.  \n \nB. \n \nThe project will contribute to improved health for the rural population in project areas. The \n13. \noutcome  will  be  that the  selected  provinces,  in  partnership with non-state  service providers,  will \nefficiently  deliver  high-quality  PHC  to  the  rural  population,  in  particular  to  women  and  children. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nC. \n \n14. \nOutput  1:  National  policies  and  standards.  The  project  will  assist  the  Department  of \nHealth  (DOH)  to  develop  and  implement  policies,  standards,  and  strategies  for  CHPs 15 and \nstrengthen human resources in the health sector within the framework of the NHP.  It will assist \nDOH  in  its  provincial  planning  and  coordination  functions,  including  facility  and  asset \nmanagement,  human  resource  audits,  staff  retention,  and  planning  health  services.  The  project \nwill  provide  improved  health  information  systems  by  applying  information  and  communication \ntechnology  (ICT)  and  geographic  information  systems  (GIS).  This  support  will  (i)  increase  the \navailability  of  information  at  all  levels  of  the  health  sector,  (ii)  enable  provincial  and  district \ngovernments  to  monitor  the  performance  in  the  sector,  and  (iii)  improve  logistics  for  supplying \ndrugs locally. \n \n15. \nOutput 2: Sustainable partnerships between provincial governments and non-state \nactors. The project will help provincial and district governments to develop and formalize existing \nor new partnerships with non-state providers of health  services by forming a partnership board.16 \nThis will facilitate greater coordination and efficiency among diverse health service providers and \nimprove their consistency and accountability. In particular, it will assist provincial governments in \nformalizing  partnerships  and  negotiating  and  implementing  agreements  with  non-state  actors, \nincluding  the  development  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  tools  and  targets.  The  project  will  help \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n13 ADB  supports  the  health  sector-wide  approach  with  other  development  partners:  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational  Development,  New  Zealand  Aid  Programme,  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund,  United  Nations \nPopulation  Fund,  and  World  Health  Organization.  The  sector-wide  approach  was  initially  established  as  a  \n\u201cpartnership arrangement\u201d to support the country\u2019s National Health Plan, 2001\u20132010 under the HSIP in 2004.   \n\n14 Long-term  commitment  and  capacity  development  are  in  line  with  the  ADB\u2019s  approach  to  fragile  countries.

The  project  will \nstrengthen  the  skills  of  health  personnel  in  rural  communities.  It  will  provide  skills  and  capacity \ntraining for health workers and training in facility management and clinical supervision for district \nand provincial managers in participating districts. The project will also support the government to \naddress issues of performance and retention of health workers.  \n \n17. \nOutput  4:  Community  health  facility  upgrading.  The project will build or upgrade two \nCHPs and upgrade and refurbish eight rural health facilities in each of 16 participating districts. It \nwill  provide  medical  equipment  and  small  vehicles  including    cars,  boats,  or  motorbikes.  It  will \nupgrade staff housing, install or upgrade sanitation and waste-management facilities, and supply \nselected health facilities with renewable energy. Design of facilities will take into account climate \nchange impacts, e.g., rising sea levels for facilities on small islands.18  \n \nOutput  5:  Health  promotion  in  local  communities.  The project will increase women\u2019s \n18. \ninvolvement  in all  aspects  of  delivering  community  health services. Through health programs,  it \nwill  support  existing  and  new  initiatives  by  civil  society  organizations  to  increase  knowledge  on \nsanitation,  primary  health  (i.e.,  maternal  and  child  health  and  HIV/AIDS),  and gender  (including \ndomestic and sexual violence) in local communities.19 \n \n19. \nOutput  6:  Project  monitoring,  evaluation  and  management.  The  project  will  support \nplanning, reporting, coordination with development partners, and monitoring and evaluation. It will \nestablish a project support unit (PSU) in DOH. A formative evaluation every 6 months will inform \nstakeholders of project progress, impact, and experiences, including crosscutting aspects such as \ngender and climate change.20 \n \nD. \n \n20. \nThe project is estimated to cost $81.2 million, including taxes and duties. The project cost \nincludes  physical  and  price  contingencies  and  interest  charged  during  implementation.  Table  1 \nsummarizes  the  investment  plan.  Detailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by \nfinancier are in the project administration manual.21 \n \n21. \nSDR  12,435,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help finance  the  project.

To improve aid effectiveness, the Government of PNG has recommended \nthat  all  aid  agencies,  including  AusAID,  channel  their  support  for  improving  rural  health  service \ndelivery  through the  project.  The  Government  of  Australia  will,  through  its  PNG  Health  Delivery \nStrategy  Program,  provide  grant  cofinancing  equivalent  to  $40  million,  to  be  administered  by \nADB.  \n\n \n\n23. \nThe  Government  of  PNG  has  requested  cofinancing  of  $9  million  from  OFID,  to  be \nadministered  by  ADB. 22  OFID  has  provided  its  firm  commitment,  with  OFID  board  approval \nexpected  in  December  2011.  In  the  unlikely  event  that  cofinancing  from  OFID  is  not  provided \nwithin 6 months following the  effectiveness of the loan, the government shall take all necessary \nand  appropriate  steps  to  make  available  all  counterpart  funds  required  for  timely  and  effective \ncompletion  of  the  project  whether  through  either  budget  allocations  or  other  arrangements \nacceptable to ADB, in the absence of which the government and ADB shall agree to scale down \nthe scope of the project and if applicable to adjust the relevant financing arrangements.  \n \nThe government has requested the Japan International Cooperation Agency to provide 12 \n24. \nsenior  volunteers  to  work  in  selected  provinces  as  provincial  partnership  coordinators. 23 The \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) will support \nthe project with technical assistance in their areas of expertise.24 \n\n                                                \n22  The OFID loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 1.75% per annum; \n\nand a service charge of 1%. \n\n23  Volunteers will be retained by the agency under its standard procedures but will work under the project. \n24 Proposed Program for Output 5: Health Promotion in Local Communities; Formative Evaluation (accessible from the \nlist  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).

The economic internal rate \nof  return  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  21%,  exceeding  the  12%  threshold  for  viability. 27 \nUnderestimation is likely, since psychological and consumption benefits associated with improved \nhealth cannot be captured in numerical values. The financial analysis concluded that the project \nis sustainable based on the government\u2019s commitment to cover the costs of personnel, medical \nsupplies,  and  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  all  rural  health  facilities  developed  and \nrefurbished under the project.  \n \nB. \n \n29. \nDOH has implemented numerous aid projects using the HSIP trust account. The financial \nanalysis  found  that  financial  management  arrangements  for  implementing  the  HSIP  are \nadequate,  with  documented  financial  procedures,  computerized  accounting  software,  and  a \nfunctioning  internal  control  system.  Because the financial  management  unit  depends  heavily  on \nexternal  consultants,  the  financial  management  assessment  recommends  providing  adequate \naccounting  expertise. 28  The  procurement  capacity  assessment  concluded  that  DOH  and  the \nnational  procurement  agency  face  significant  challenges  in  terms  of  resources  and  capacity, \ncausing  in  the  past  noncompliance  with  applicable  procedures,  which  could  affect  the \nmanagement  of  project  procurement  through  government  systems.  To  mitigate  these  concerns, \nproject-specific measures to enhance governance and prevent corruption include (i) engaging a \nsenior  accounting  expert  and  an  international  procurement  expert  to  ensure  the  accuracy  of \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n27 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Project Administration Manual (Section V: Financial Management Assessment); Financial Analysis (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nproject accounts and compliance with procurement procedures; (ii) direct payment procedures for \nall  international  and  PSU  consultants  and  other  high-value  goods  and  services,  with  regular \ninternal  audits  of  financial  management  and  procurement  in  addition  to  the  planned  external \naudit;  (iii)  an  evaluation  committee  to  review  criteria  for  tenders  of  small  civil  works;  and  (iv)  a \ndedicated  section  of  the  DOH  website  to  serve  as  the  project  website,  publishing  procurement \nand  performance  data  to  maximize  transparency.29 Risk  mitigation  is  discussed  in  detail  in  the \nPAM and set out in the risk assessment and risk management plan.30 \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n30. \nwith  the  government  and  DOH.  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM.  \n \nC. \n \nThe project is gender category I (gender equity as a theme).31 Project improvements will \n31. \ncontribute to poverty reduction and provide social benefits by expanding coverage and improving \nthe quality  of PHC for  rural  women and  children.32 Many  health problems  in PNG,  such  as  high \nmaternal  and  infant  mortality,  poor  reproductive  health,  poor  nutrition,  and  communicable \ndiseases,  can  be  prevented  with  affordable  access  to  PHC,  including  skilled  professionals \nsupervising  deliveries  and  adequate  medical  equipment,  and  the  project  will  contribute \nsignificantly to improving the health and economic circumstances of rural residents. To increase \nawareness  of  maternal  health,  the  project  will  support  health  promotion  conducted  by  health \nworkers  and  village  health  volunteers.  It  will  employ  a  social,  gender,  and  community \ndevelopment  specialist  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  gender  action  plans  and  report  on \nprogress,  together  with  the  PSU.  The  formative  evaluation  team  will  collect  and  analyze  sex-\ndisaggregated data for all project activities under the gender action plan.   \n \nD. \n \n32. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  environment  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  was \nprepared  to  guide  the  assessment  and  review  of  project  investments.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination  was  prepared  to  provide  DOH  with  technical  guidance  on  expected  environmental \nissues and how to address them in a manner consistent with the Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n \n33. \nSocial  safeguards.  The  project  is  involuntary  resettlement  category  C  and  indigenous \npeoples  category  C  in  accordance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  project  is  not \nexpected  to  require  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement.  All  civil  works  will  be  on  land \ncurrently used by health facilities. A land assessment framework provides detailed guidelines for \nassessing and confirming that the land proposed for each health facility is owned by the state or a \nhealth  services  partner  organization  (e.g.,  a  church)  with  control  over  the  operations  of  the \nexisting facility. Melanesians comprise the vast majority of the PNG population, and the project is \nnot  expected to have any  negative  impact  on  indigenous  peoples. While  a  separate  indigenous \npeoples  plan  is  not  needed,  all  project  outputs  will  be  delivered  in  a  culturally  appropriate  and \nparticipatory manner to meet the needs of various beneficiaries. \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n29 These measures are in line with the recommendations of the ADB\u2019s approach to fragile countries (footnote 14). \n30 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31  ADB.

The \nproject will accelerate in progressive provinces where the site selection criteria \ncan be satisfied notwithstanding pending elections.  \nThe project emphasizes partnership in health service delivery with non-state \nproviders such as churches and private firms, whose capacity to make decisions \nis not directly affected by election-related disruption.  \n\nThe PSU, in line with recommendations of the ADB\u2019s approach to fragile \ncountries, supports capacity development of the executing agency and \nimplementing agencies. \nThe government covenants in the loan agreement require that appropriate \nnumbers of community health post staff are made available; this is also a site \nselection criterion.  \nOutput 1 supports the government in developing a staff incentive program; \noutput 3 provides training in supervision and management. \nOutput 4 includes staff housing as part of the civil works component, providing \nan incentive for staff to stay. \nThe project supports the preparation and delivery of a comprehensive rural \nhealth services training plan including the training of trainers. \nProvinces explicitly agree to provide sufficient human resource and recurrent \ncosts for the new and upgraded facilities.  \n\nPartnership boards under output 2 will be established  or re-launched prior to the \nagreements for effective cooperation.  \nConsultations will be held among stakeholders including provincial and local \ngovernment authorities, private service providers, churches, civil society, and \ncommunities. \n\nThe selection of facility sites and civil work contractors is transparent and \nincludes consultations with local communities. \nCommunity buy-in, and enhanced security, will be developed through community \nparticipation in the partnership boards, which are a precondition for civil works. \nCivil works are scheduled to be implemented from the fourth quarter of 2012 to \n\n                                                \n33  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Framework;
