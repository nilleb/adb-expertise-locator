Achievement  of  this  objective  has \nbeen limited by low long-term economic growth rates, and \nby  employment  growth  well  below  the  rate  of  increase  of \nthe  labor  force.  These  disappointing  outcomes  reflect \npolicy \nhave \ndiscouraged  private  sector  investment,  and  the  crowding- \nout  effects  of  a  relatively  large  public  sector.  Government \nfinances  are  deteriorating  due  to  inadequate  collection  of \nnontax revenue, transfers to public sector enterprises, and \nunbudgeted  spending.  Wages  and  salaries  account  for \nover  57%  of  current  expenditure,  crowding  out \nexpenditures on goods, services, and investments.   \n \nVarious  changes  addressing  these  issues  have  already \ntaken  place,  which  are \nthe  prioritized \nin \ndevelopment  objectives  and  policies  established  in  the \nSeventh  Strategic  Development  Plan,  2001-2003.  The \nGovernment  is  now  actively  seeking  to  accelerate  the \nreform process by implementing the EPSRP.  \n \nThe  objective  of \nto  ensure  overall \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  to  contribute  to  enhanced \nprivate sector-led economic growth.   \n \nThe  EPSRP  comprises  two  main  areas  of  reform:  (i)  fiscal \nreform  measures  aimed  at  achieving  a  sustainable  fiscal \nbalance  and  (ii)  public  service  reform  measures  seeking  to \nimprove public service delivery to the private sector and the \ngeneral public.  \n \nEconomic Growth \nGood Governance \n \nCategory C    \nThe  environmental \nminimal.  \n \n \n \n\nthe  Program  are \n\nimplications  of \n\nthe  EPSRP \n\nline  with \n\nis \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nClassification \n\nEnvironmental  \nAssessment \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nADB Assistance \n\nA.

The loan will have a  24- \nyear  term  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest \nrate  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period,  and  1.5% \nthereafter. \n \nThe  Program  period  will  be  20  months.  The  loan  will  be \nreleased in two tranches of equal size. The first tranche will \nbe  made  available  upon  loan  effectiveness.  The  second \ntranche  is  expected  to  be  released  by  March  2003, \ndepending  upon  satisfactory  implementation  of  agreed \nupon conditions.  \n \n\nstandard \n\n \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  are  expected  to  be  disbursed \nagainst a broad range of imports, subject to a negative list \nof  items.  Procurement  of  goods  will  be  based  on  normal \ncommercial practices for procurement by the private sector \nor \nprocedures \nacceptable  to  ADB  for  procurement  by  the  public  sector, \nexcept  that  in  the  case  of  goods  commonly  traded  on \ninternational  commodities  markets,  procurement  will  be \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  procedures  appropriate  to \nthe trade and acceptable to ADB.  \n \n\nprocurement \n\ngovernment \n\n \n\n \n\nB. \n\n Technical Assistance \n\nCounterpart Funds  Counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  from  the  proceeds  of \nthe loan will be used to finance local currency costs related \nto the implementation of the Program.  \n \nTechnical assistance (TA) in the amount of US$700,000 for \nBuilding  a  Performance-Based  Public  Service  will  provide \nadvisory  services  and  support  capacity  building  to  (i) \nfacilitate  good  governance  practices  and  strengthen  the \nthe \nplanning,  monitoring,  and  reporting  capability  of \nthe  central  human  resource \nministries;  (ii)  establish \nmanagement \nintroduce \nperformance  accountability  for  heads  of  departments;  (iv) \nsupport the introduction of performance-oriented and merit-\nbased remuneration policies and procedures; and (v) assist \nin  the  preparation  of  regulations  and  implementation \nguidelines    for  new  legislation  under  the  EPSRP.  The  TA \nwill  be  financed  by  ADB  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB-\nfunded  TA  program.  It  is  estimated  that  about  28  person-\nmonths of international consulting services will be required. \n\ninformation \n\nsystem; \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Safeguards \n\n \n\nv\n\nThe consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n \nThe  successful  implementation  of  reform  will  require \nconsiderable political will to (i) delegate an increased share \nof management responsibilities to government departments \nwithin  the  reform  framework;  and  (ii)  create  a  transparent, \nconsistent,  and  responsive  policy  environment.  To  date, \nsuch  risks  have  been  mitigated  by  the  strong  commitment \nof most senior government officials to push through the key \npolicy  reforms.  It  is  also  important  to  note  that  the  reform \nprogram  is  strongly  supported  by  the  Privy  Council.  The \nPrime Minister and the minister of finance, both appointed \nwith  the  endorsement  of  the  Privy  Council,  were  selected \nbecause  of  their  recognized  commitment  to  reform,  which \nindicates  that  the  proposed  reforms  are  supported  by  the \nhighest authorities in the country.  \n \nAnother risk is that the Government may lack the capacity \nand  management  resources  to  implement  some  of  the \nimportant  reform  measures,  despite  strong  political  will. \nThis risk will be mitigated by ADB\u2019s TA as well as TA from \nother  funding  agencies.    In  addition,  at  least  20%  of  the \ncounterpart  funds  have  been  earmarked  to  mitigate  the \nimpacts of the public service reform. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed \nloan to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Economic and Public Sector Reform Program (EPSRP). \nThe  Report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Building  a  Performance-\nBased  Public  Service,  and  if  the  proposed  loan  is  approved  by  the  Board,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, shall approve the TA.  \n \n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n2. \nDiscussions  between  the  Government  of  the  Kingdom  of  Tonga  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  on  developing  the  EPSRP  have  been  ongoing  since  1998.  In \nresponse  to  the  Government's  request  for  TA1  to  formulate  the  proposed  EPSRP,  ADB \nsubmitted a draft concept paper, including the institutional framework for EPSRP management, \nto the Government in August 1999. The Cabinet of Ministers approved the draft concept paper \nin  April  2000.  The  Prime  Minister  reiterated  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  the  reform \nprogram  in  a  public  statement  made  in  June  2001.  The  TA  to  prepare  the  EPSRP  and  to \nfacilitate  the  initial  stage  of  implementation  commenced  in  September  2001.  A  consultation \nmission  was  fielded  during  15-20  October  2001,  and  a  fact-finding  mission  during  24 \nNovember\u20138 December 2001, followed by a preappraisal mission during 21-26 January 2002.2 \nIn preparation for the EPSRP, the Cabinet approved  a number of submissions, including all of \nthose designated as first tranche conditions, on 23 January 2002.3  \n \n3. \nAll  reform  measures  have  been  in  preparation  for  an  extended  period  of  1-4  years. \nMoving  forward  now  is  spurred  by  a  number  of  factors\u2014a  worsening  fiscal  situation, \ndisappointing  economic  growth,  and  the  eroded  Tonga  Trust  Fund\u2014which  have  led  to    a \nspecific  \u201cmacroeconomic  moment\u201d  where  macroeconomic  vulnerability  creates  not  just  a  need \nfor  borrowing  but  an  increased  understanding  of  the  need  for  reform.  The  Government  has \ntaken the initiative to compile these reform measures into a coherent  reform program, and has \nestablished  an  organizational  structure  and  a  secretariat  to  ensure  its  implementation.    The \nprogram logical framework (Appendix 1) and the draft policy matrix (Appendix 2) are a result of \nthese  efforts  and  were  discussed  with  senior  government  officials,  private  sector \nrepresentatives, and other key stakeholders. Focus group discussions, hearings and workshops \ninvolving  civil  society  were  organized,  are  still  ongoing,  and  will  continue  during  the \nimplementation of the EPSRP. The program logical framework and the policy matrix outline the \ncontent  of  the  EPSRP,  which  forms  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  overall  reform  program.  The \ncomprehensive  policy  agenda  and  reform  priorities  of  the  Government  go  beyond  the  EPSRP \nand are summarized in the development policy letter (DPL) from the minister of finance found in \nAppendix 3.  \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001.

Mellor,  Financial \nManagement  Specialist;  and  R.  Clendon,  Principal  Counsel,  and  was  subsequently  upgraded  to  an  appraisal \nmission on 5 March 2002. \n\n3  The  approved  submissions  include  (i)  the  Development  Policy  Letter;  (ii)  instructions  for  the  preparation  of  the \nFY2003  budget  estimates  of  revenue  and  expenditure  comprising  all  elements  outlined  in  the  draft  policy  matrix \nagreed  upon  during  loan  fact-finding;  (iii)  preparation  of  proposed  legislation  (a)  to  update  the  Public  Finance \nAdministration  Act,  Public  Revenue  Act,  and  Public  Audit  Act;  and  (b)  to  regulate  public  sector  enterprises;  (iv) \norganizational structure, terms of reference and appointment of a senior public servant for the implementation of \nthe  overall  reform  program.  The  Cabinet  also  discussed  a  report  prepared  by  the  Pacific  Financial  Technical \nAssistance  Centre  (PFTAC)  on    proposed  tax  reforms.  The  minister  of  finance  received  the  requested  approval \nfrom  Cabinet  to  (i)  undertake  wider  consultations  on  the  implications  of  the  proposed  tax  reforms;  and  (ii)  to \ncommence drafting  the necessary legislation. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\nA. \n\nBackground and Recent Economic Performance \n\n \n\n  \nThe  Tongan  economy  grew  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  1.8%  during  1973-1995,  with \n4. \nper capita gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 1.2%. The engine of growth was remittances \nfrom Tongan workers overseas.4 Real government spending also grew strongly. Real GDP grew \nat an average annual rate of 2.2% in the 7-year period from 30 June 1994 to 30 June 2001; but \ngrowth rates ranged from - 0.2% (FY1996) to 6.2% (FY2000). The budget statement for FY2002 \nobserved that the average annual growth for FY1998-FY2000 was estimated at 6.1% in nominal \nterms  and  4.4%  in  real  terms.  This  performance  represents  a  marked  recovery  from  the \nrecession over the FY1996-FY1997 period, when minimal growth was recorded. The turnaround \nin FY2000 was attributed largely to growth in the services sector (5.6%) supported by recovery \nin  the  agriculture  and  fishery  sector,  which  grew  by  10.8%.  The  impact  of  millennium \ncelebrations was a feature of this period, with a 17.9% growth rate in the commerce, restaurant, \nand  hotel  sectors.  Government  administration  and  community  services  became  the  largest \nsector in the monetary economy by the turn of the 21st  century, growing at an average annual \nrate of 5.0%, and accounting for 15.3% of GDP in FY2001. This sector was a major contributor \nto  growth  through  the  1990s  and  into  the  new  millennium.  Economic  indicators  suggest  that \nGDP growth for FY2001 is likely to be in the order of 6% in nominal terms and 3% in real terms. \nThe  anticipated  real  growth  in  GDP  in  FY2002  was  projected  in  June  2001  as  3%  with  some \npotential for improvement.5 \n \n \n5. \nHowever, the forecast for FY2002 was revised downward in December 2001 to 1.5% as \na  result  of  deteriorating  world  economic  conditions.  The  impact  of  tropical  cyclone  Waka  that \ndevastated  the  northern  island  group  of  Vava\u2019u  and  the  Niuas  on  31  December  2001  would \nlower  this  further.  Workers\u2019  remittances  contribute  about  half  of  Tonga\u2019s  foreign  exchange \nearnings, and about 60% of these flows come from thousands of Tongans living in the United \nStates.  In  addition,  disruption  to  international  air  services  has  diminished  fresh  fish  exports  to \nHawaii.  There  will  be  negative  effects  on  government  revenue  as  expenditure  for  imported \ngoods  is  affected  by  these  developments.  It  is  also  clear  that  short-term  reform  measures  for \nincreasing revenues and reducing expenditures that had been foreseen in June-July 2001 will \nnot have much impact in FY2002.  \n\n \n\n6. \nGovernment finances deteriorated from a fiscal deficit of 0.2% of GDP in FY1999, to 0.4 \n% in FY2000 and 2.6% in FY2001 (Figure 1). The fiscal rule that recurrent expenditure should \nnot exceed recurrent revenue was adhered to, but led to a reduction in nonwage expenditures \nto accommodate the increasing wage bill. With the 20% public service wage increase in 2000, \nwages and salaries now account for over 57% of current expenditure, crowding out expenditure \non other goods and services and limiting the availability of domestic resources for investment. \nDisappointing  collection  of  nontax  revenue,  transfers  to  public  sector  enterprises  (PSEs),  and \nunbudgeted spending, including a loan to the national airline, caused total public expenditure to \nrun  ahead  of  budget  estimates  for  FY2002.  In  addition,  there  is  an  estimated  T$30  million \nunfunded liability arising from the public servants\u2019 retirement scheme introduced in 1999. Until \nmid-2001 the Government drew resources from the Tonga Trust Fund6 to cover any emerging \n                                                 \n4   Per capita growth would have been minimal if not for continued outward migration.   \n5  The  International  Monetary  Fund  in  its  staff  report  for  the  2001  Article  IV  consultation,  largely  agreed  with  this \nassessment  of  recent  economic  performance  and  the  outlook  for  FY2002,  but  cautioned  that  reform  and  fiscal \nrestraint are a precondition for this relatively favorable scenario. \n\n6  An  off-budget  fund  established  in  1988  to  hold  proceeds  from  the  former  sale  of  passports  to  Tongan  protected \npersons.  The  resources  were  intended  to  be  used  for  special  development  projects  and  to  mitigate  natural \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nbudget  deficit  and  unbudgeted  expenditures.  This  financial  cushion  allowed  fiscal  discipline  to \ndeteriorate.  It  also  reduced  the  felt  need  to  proceed  with  long-discussed  economic  and  public \nsector  reform  measures.  However,  due  to  poor  performance  of  the  trust  fund,  this  fallback \noption  is  no  longer  available.  The  budget  deficit  that  originally  was  estimated  to  be  TS$6.7 \nmillion  in  FY2002  may  approach  TS$10  million  and  is  financed  by  the    domestic  banking \nsystem. The rise in net credit to the Government and an expansion in credit to the private sector \neroded foreign reserves to US$15.3 million at the end of June 2001, or approximately 2 months \nof import cover, placing pressure on the currency pa\u2019anga.  \n \n\nFigure 1: Government Budget, FY1992-FY2002\n\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n\nTotal revenue and grants (%\nof GDP)\nTotal expenditure (% of GDP)\n\nCurrent balance (% of GDP)\n\nOverall balance (% of GDP)\n\nGDP=gross domestic product. \nSource: International Monetary Fund. 1997, 1998, 2001. \u201cStaff Report for the Article IV \nConsultation.\u201d Washington D.C. \n\n \n7. \nThe inflation rate between June 1985 and June 1995 varied around an average of 8.6%.  \nAs  a  result  of  expansionary  macroeconomic  policies  and  substantial  currency  depreciation, \ndrought and cyclone damage, and higher world prices, inflation went from 5.25% in FY2000 to \n7.0%  in  FY2001  and  is  expected  to  grow  above  10%  in  FY2002.  Broad  money  increased  by \n8.3%  in  FY2000  and  by  an  estimated  35.7%  in  FY2001.  The  latter  increase  was  driven  by  a \n35.1% rise in net domestic assets. Net credit to the Government rose more than fivefold in line \nwith the financing of the fiscal deficit, and credit to nonfinancial PSEs more than doubled, while \ncredit to the private sector grew by around 23.8%. Net foreign assets declined. Monetary policy \nwas  tightened  in  early  FY2001  in  response  to  declining  foreign  reserves,  with  the  National \nReserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) raising the reserve requirement ratio from 12% to 15% and the \nminimum lending rate from 9% to 12%. The Privy Council also approved credit ceilings in July \n2000. However, monetary policy eased during the latter half of the current FY 2002.  \n \nThe external accounts were characterized by large trade deficits throughout the 1990s, \n8. \nlarge  net  private  transfer  flows,  and  a  negative  current  account  balance  that  often  reflected \nforeign borrowing to finance public investment projects. The decline in official foreign reserves \nduring  the  decade  and  the  concomitant  drop  in  import  cover  are  striking  features  during  this \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \ndisasters.  The  fund  was  invested  almost  entirely  offshore  and  by  1998  was  reported  to  have  reached  T$33.5 \nmillion.  The  fund  has  since  been  severely  depleted.  The  Government  has  commenced  an  investigation  into  the \nfund, the results of which are expected to be available shortly.    \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nperiod.  In  FY2001  the  balance  of  payments  deteriorated  further.  The  net  services  account \nmoved  from  surplus  to  deficit,  reflecting  a  decline  in  tourism  receipts,  a  rise  in  transportation \ncosts,  and  the  impact  of  payments  by  the  telecommunications  sector.  The  current  account \ndeficit  consequently  rose  by  approximately  2  percentage  points  of  GDP.  Gross  official  foreign \nreserves in mid-2001 covered less than 2 months of imports of goods and services\u2014well below \nNRBT\u2019s target of at least 3 months. Since July 2000, the pa\u2019anga has been pegged to a basket \nof currencies that includes the Japanese yen in addition to the United States (US), Australian, \nand  New  Zealand  dollars.  Most  of  the  currency  devaluation  followed  the  private  sector  credit \nexpansion  of  FY1998  and  the  subsequent  loss  of  foreign  reserves.  Further  depreciation \noccurred  in  FY2001  as  the  current  account  position  weakened:  21%  against  the  US  dollar, \n6.75% in nominal effective terms, and approximately 5.5% in real effective terms. \n \nTonga has enjoyed relatively buoyant growth in recent years at least partly as a result of \n9. \nan  expansionary  fiscal  and  monetary  policy.  However,  the  country  now  faces  balance  of \npayments  difficulties  and  rising  inflation.  Both  of  these  threats  are  serious,  and  neither  is \nsusceptible  to  a  short-term  solution.  Even  in  the  face  of  severe  restraint,  foreign  exchange \nreserves  would  take  some  time  to  recover  from  the  current  situation  of  less  than  2  months  of \nimport cover to a more comfortable 4-6 months, which was the case in the past. Inflation will put \nfurther pressure on an overstretched budget. The most immediate of these pressures will likely \nbe  for  further  adjustments  to  the  public  service  wage  scale,  which  was  adjusted  upwards  by \n20% in FY2001. Virtually the whole of this increase will have been offset by inflation by the end \nof the current fiscal year. \n \n10. \nIt is fair to say that the existence of the Tonga Trust Fund and remittances from Tongan \noverseas  workers  have  masked    economic  reality  in  Tonga  for  a  long  time.  That  reality  is \nsluggish growth, a public sector that is large in relation to the economy, and heavy dependence \non  the  Government  for  job  creation.  Reform  is  needed  to  address  these  structural  problems \nwhile remittances still continue to underpin a weak domestic economy. \n \nB. \n \n11. \nAt the time of its annual Article IV consultation in June 2001, the International Monetary \nFund  (IMF)  was  critical  of  the  expansionary  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  pursued  in  FY2001. \nThe overall fiscal deficit for FY2001 was then estimated at 2% of GDP and now stands at 1.5%. \nIt  was  also  observed  that  despite  a  rise  in  the  reserve  requirement  from  12%  to  15%  in \nSeptember 2000, excess liquidity, coupled with the low interest paid on NRBT short-term bills, \nhad facilitated strong credit expansion by banks. IMF prescriptions stressed the importance of \nfiscal  and  monetary  tightening  and  early  implementation  of  corresponding  measures  to  regain \nexternal viability. \n \nEconomic  growth  in  FY2002  is  unlikely  to  come  up  to  expectations  established  before \n12. \nthe  events  of  11  September  2001  and  before  the  extent  of  the  world  economic  slowdown \nbecame evident. Remittances are vulnerable to the shock of possible job losses in the ranks of \nexpatriate Tongans.  Imports will decline should there be lower remittances, and consequently \ngovernment  revenues,  which  are  largely  import  related,  will  fall.  Exports  of  niche  agricultural \nproducts may be affected, and some bank assets weakened. \n \n13. \nThe leisurely pace of reform in recent years is no longer compatible with the reality that \nfiscal balance has been lost and monetary policy has few effective instruments at its disposal. It \nshould  be  stressed  that  these  endemic  problems  are  structural  rather  than  cyclical.  There  are \ntwo principal structural problems: \n\nMacroeconomic Issues and Prospects \n\n \n\n \n\n\f5\n\n \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Government has been active in almost every field of economic endeavor. In \naddition  to  public  utilities,  communications,  and  transportation  (both  marine  and \nair), the Government is involved in fishing, tourism, retail trade, and many other \naspects  of  economic  life  that  are  not  normally  regarded  as  traditional  areas  of \ngovernment activity even in small economies. It is essential that these activities \nbe rationalized by closure, divestiture, or corporatization in order to stem losses \nor recycle resources into more productive uses. This will take considerable time, \nsince  almost  none  of  these  endeavors  are  saleable  in  their  present  form,  and \nchanges  will  involve  disruption  of  established  patterns  of  employment  and \neconomic activity that underpin the social sector. Moreover, capital markets are \nvirtually non-existent in Tonga, so privatization will involve foreign ownership or a \nlong wait until the State can realize its investment. \n\n(ii) \n\nThe Government has become the largest employer by far, with nearly 5,000 paid \npositions accounting for over one third of total paid employment. Employment in \nPSEs  adds  nearly  another  2,000  employees  and  raises  the  total  government \nshare  of  paid  employment  to  about  45%.  This  level  of  employment  has  meant \nthat  budgetary  restraint  has  bitten  more  deeply  into  nonwage  and  salary \noperating costs so that the relatively large government labor force is not provided \nwith adequate funds to be effective in all cases. Wages and salaries now account \nfor over 57% of government operating costs net of debt service. Rebalancing is \nclearly needed. \n\n \nThese  two  structural  problems  continue  to  place  a  heavy  burden  on  the  government \n14. \nbudget,  a  situation  that  has  become  untenable.  Given  the  unsatisfactory  collection  of  tax  and \nnontax  revenue  due  to  legislative  loopholes  and  a  weak  revenue  administration,  government \nrevenue falls far below what it should amount to.  \n \n15. \nUntil recently these structural issues were not perceived as actual problems.  It is only \nnow,  with  the  worsening  fiscal  situation,  disappointing  economic  growth,  and  eroded  Tonga \nTrust  Fund,  that  addressing  these  structural  problems  has  become  a  priority.  Economic  and \npublic  sector  reforms  are  now  fundamental  to  Tonga\u2019s  prospects  for  economic  growth  in  the \nyears ahead. Unlike the governments of other Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs), \nthe Government of Tonga has a stable political climate, and to this extent has an advantage in \nbeing able to see a reform program through.  \n \nC. \n \n16. \nThe  Government  of  Tonga\u2019s  development  objectives  and  strategy  are  presented  in  the \ncabinet-approved Seventh Strategic Development Plan, 2001-2003 (SSDP). The Plan identifies \na sustained rise in living standards as the overall development objective, with living standards \ndefined in terms of both income and human development levels. The basic means of achieving \nthis development objective is durable economic growth, which generates economic benefits that \nare shared equitably and permits higher expenditure on education and health. More specifically, \nthe Plan aims to promote (i) a well-educated and skilled labor force; (ii) efficient, well-structured \nPSEs; (iii) a sound enabling environment for private sector-led economic growth; (iv) an efficient \nand  well-structured  government  sector;  (v)  well-maintained  physical \ninfrastructure;  (vi) \nconservation of the environment and efficient use of renewable resources; (vii) participation of \ncivil  society  and  the  community  in  economic  development;  (viii) equitable  distribution  of \n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\ndevelopment  benefits;  (ix)  low  crime  rate  and  enhanced  national  security;  and  (x) stable \nmacroeconomic environment. \n \n17. \nThe Government  acknowledges that, for durable growth to occur, the bulk of investment \nshould  occur  in  the  private  sector  of  a  market  economy  in  which  the  Government  will  play  a \nnumber  of  crucial,  complementary  roles.  These  roles  are  providing  a  stable  macroeconomic \nenvironment,  promoting  education  and  technology,  investing  in  physical  and  institutional \ninfrastructure, providing a social safety net for vulnerable groups, and preventing environmental \ndegradation.  Therefore,  the  SSDP  gives  top  priority  for  funding  purposes  to  a  restructuring \nprogram that is designed to (i) make the Tongan economy more competitive and dynamic, (ii) \nfacilitate and promote the growth of the private sector, (iii) rationalize and raise the efficiency of \nthe Government and public sector enterprises, and  (iv) mobilize domestic saving to raise self- \nreliance in financing investments. The Government\u2019s overall reform agenda, as outlined in the \nDPL, comprises four reform areas: (i) fiscal reform, (ii) public sector reform, (iii) financial sector \nreform,  and  (iv)  private  sector  reform.  While  the  EPSRP  focuses  on  fiscal  and  public  sector \nreform, the Government will also implement the following additional reform measures.  \n \n18. \nThe  objective  of  the  financial  sector  reform  is  to  improve  overall  financial  sector \nperformance  by  (i)  improving  the  effectiveness  of  monetary  policy  and  management,  and  (ii) \nenhancing  financial  intermediation  of  the  Tonga  Development  Bank.  The  SSDP  identifies  two \nmain issues that must be addressed if monetary policy is to better contribute to the maintenance \nof  macroeconomic  stability.  The  first  is  NRBT\u2019s  weak  balance  sheet,  which  currently  prevents \nthe effective use of indirect monetary policy instruments.7 The second issue concerns the need \nto strengthen NRBT\u2019s supervisory capacity in line with the provisions of the Financial Institutions \nAct  of  1991  and  subsequent  amendments,  in  order  to  ensure  adequate  enforcement  of \nprudential regulations covering all financial institutions. In accordance with a cabinet decision of \n23 January 2002, NRBT is responsible for implementation of the financial sector reform and will \nset up a reform team under the reform secretariat. \n \n19. \nAcceleration  of  private  sector-led  economic  growth\u2014the  objective  of  policy  reforms \naimed at encouraging private sector growth\u2014will be addressed through (i) improving the legal \nand regulatory framework for local and foreign investment, and (ii) introducing and progressively \nimplementing  tax  reform.  The  keys  to  promoting  private  sector  development  are  transparency \nand predictability of the business climate. This depends on replacing the discretionary powers of \nbureaucrats and ministers in regard to  business licensing with a clear statement of policy and \nstreamlined  procedures.  A  new  foreign  investment  act  has  been  drafted  with  assistance  from \nthe  Foreign  Investment  Advisory  Service  (FIAS),  and  will  be  introduced  into  the  Legislative \nAssembly  in  the  2002  session.  The  business  climate  will  also  benefit  from  the  removal  of \nambiguity and discretion in matters such as the granting of work and residence visas. Reform \nmeasures  in  support  of  private  sector  development  include  (i)  formulation  of  a  national \ninvestment policy, including the determination of sectors in which foreign investors can invest; \n(ii) passage of the new foreign investment act; (iii) repeal of import licenses and the  Industrial \nDevelopment  Incentives  Act  with  clear  transitional  provisions;  and  (iv)  review  of  land  lease \nregulations.   \n \n\n                                                 \n7  When NRBT was established in 1989, the net foreign assets position was transferred from the Bank of Tonga by \nissuing  NRBT  bills.  In  the  absence  of  financial  support  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  with  a  gradual  loss  of \nforeign  reserves,  NRBT\u2019s  income  position  worsened  to  the  point  where  it  stopped  issuing  3-month  bills  in  1998, \nretaining only 1-month bills on which below-market rates are paid. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nExternal Assistance and Roles of Major Funding Agencies \n\nTax  reform  is  also  considered  important  by  the  business  community  and  by  the \n20. \nGovernment.  Proposed  changes  would  reduce  the  tax  burden  on  businesses  in  part  through \neliminating  the  discrimination  in  the  Industrial  Development  Incentives  Act  by  repealing  it  and \nreplacing it with lower rates on crucial business inputs while transferring the burden of taxation \naway from investment to consumption. These measures would be buttressed by fiscal reform, \nwhich will both reduce the \u201ccrowding out\u201d of business borrowing by government borrowing and \nreduce the extent of government involvement in the market by closing loss-incurring enterprises \nand offering to privatize commercial interests. The Ministry of Labor, Commerce and Industries \nis  taking  the  lead  in  implementing  these  reform  measures  in  support  of  private  sector \ndevelopment. \n \nD. \n \n21. \nADB has been among the major providers of external assistance to Tonga. Other major \nsources  include  the  European  Union  (EU),  World  Bank,  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment  (AusAID),  and  New  Zealand\u2019s  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade  (MFAT).  \nProject-based assistance is also provided by the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). EU assistance has focused on \ninfrastructure development in the Vava\u2019u island group, and the World Bank\u2019s program is focused \non human resource development in the health sector. AusAID\u2019s assistance is concentrated on \nhuman  resource  development  and  institutional  strengthening  in  health,  public  expenditure \nmanagement,  the  legal  sector,  and  fisheries.  MFAT  assistance  focuses  on  human  resource \ndevelopment, outer island and community development, private sector development, and public \nenterprise  reform.  PRC  assistance  is  in  the  education  sector  and  JICA  supports  water  supply \ninfrastructure development. \n \n22. \nThe Government requested ADB to play a leadership role in the design and coordination \nof  external  assistance  for  the  EPSRP.  This  involves  organization  of  a  consultative  group \nmeeting  in  mid-April  2002,  and  ensuring  effective  ongoing  coordination  among  the  various \nexternal assistance agencies. AusAID and MFAT are currently providing complementary TA in \nsupport  of  the  proposed  reform  program.  AusAID\u2019s  TA  aims  to  strengthen  the  Ministry  of \nFinance (MOF) in program budgeting and revenue generation. Continuous staff training for the \nRevenue  Department  forms  part  of  AusAID\u2019s  assistance.  In  addition,  MOF  requested  two  full-\ntime advisors on customs and tax administration, who will commence their assignment in June \n2002.  AusAID  is  also  providing  TA  to  the  Ministry  of  Justice  to  improve  its  management  and \nadministrative  functions.  In  addition  to  the  present  AusAID  country  allocation,  resources  for \nreform initiatives can be made available on request.  \n \n23. \nThe Government Investment Unit of MOF is assisted by TA from MFAT and addresses \npublic enterprise reform including privatization/corporatization. This TA commenced in mid-1999 \nwith  short-term  advisory  inputs.  As  a  result  of  the  renewed  impetus  for  the  overall  reform \nprogram,  the  TA  was  recently  increased.  MFAT  is  also  providing  TA  on  public  service  reform, \nspecifically  in  regard  to  the  creation  of  a  public  service  commission.  As  part  of  MFAT\u2019s  TA \nreview  of  the  education  sector,  consideration  will  be  given  to  training  needs  for  retired  and \nretrenched public servants.  \n \n24. \nThe Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) has completed a review of \nthe current taxation system and has prepared a comprehensive tax reform proposal, which has \nbeen discussed with key stakeholders in Tonga. On 23 January 2002, the Cabinet approved the \ndrafting  of  the  required  legislation  and  authorized  wider  consultations  to  be  conducted.  On \nrequest  of  the  Government,  PFTAC  will  design  a  strategy  and  implementation  timetable  to \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nenhance  the  effectiveness  of  revenue  administration  in  support  of  the  tax  reform.  PFTAC  will \nalso provide assistance in legal drafting of the required tax and customs legislation with a view \nto strengthening tax administration and enforcing compliance in customs, sales, and income tax.  \n \n\nAn  assessment  of  administrative  barriers  to  private  sector  investments  is  being  carried \n25. \nout by FIAS and ADB.8 Tonga was selected as a pilot country because of the EPSRP and the \nurgent  need  to  facilitate  private  sector  development  in  parallel  with  public  sector  reforms.  A \nreview of the foreign investment regime was carried out by FIAS and resulted in a draft foreign \ninvestment  act  with  additional  support  provided  by  AusAID.  The  TA  team  (footnote  1)  has \nprepared drafts for a public finance management act, an audit act, and a public  enterprises act. \nA draft of the public service act will be prepared after recommendations on the establishment of \na public service commission have been reviewed by Cabinet (para. 23). Legislation on tax and \ncustoms administration will be drafted with assistance from PFTAC. The TA team works closely \nwith  AusAID  and  MFAT  advisors  to  enhance  complementarity  and  to  ensure  consistency  of \nadvice as well as to avoid duplication of tasks.  \n \nE. \n \n\nADB\u2019s Operation and Strategy \n\n1. \n\nPast Performance \n\n \nADB has approved 14 loans from the Asian Development Fund, totaling US$42.9 million, \n26. \nto Tonga since it joined ADB in 1972. This includes the most recent loan approved in December \n1996  for  the  power  sector  which  was  cancelled  in  1998  for  its    failure  to  become  effective. \nProject  completion  reports  have  been  prepared  for  all  projects,  9  of  which  have  been \npostevaluated.  Of  the  nine  postevaluated  projects,  eight  were  rated  generally  successful  and \none  project9  in  the  finance  sector  was  rated  partly  successful.  Since  1972,  a  total  of  US$11.4 \nmillion  has  been  provided  for  46  TAs.  Implementation  of  a  number  of  loan  projects  has  been \nconstrained  by  insufficient  availability  of  counterpart  funds,  weak  project  management,  and \ndelays  of  loan  effectiveness  and  procurement  of  goods  and  services.  These  have  been \naddressed through (i) the introduction of project performance management systems, and (ii) the \nGovernment\u2019s confirmation of the projects\u2019 firm anchorage in the national development plans.  \n \nIn  1992,  ADB  informed  the  Government  that  a  stronger  emphasis  would  be  given  to \n27. \neconomic, sector, and policy analysis. For programming, this meant increased attention to the \nmacroeconomic  policy  environment,  the  investment  climate,  and  public  sector  performance. \nSubsequently,  some  TAs  were  implemented  that  reflect  this  change  of  ADB\u2019s  country \noperational focus. Progress has been slow in implementing any reform activities emanating from \nthese TAs carried out since 1992.10  As a consequence, ADB\u2019s future lending and TA program \nwas  made  contingent  on  the  Government\u2019s  willingness  to  undertake  reforms.  ADB  has  not \nprogrammed  new  loans  in  Tonga  since  1996  pending  discussions  with  the  Government  on  its \nreform directions.11  \n \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB.  2000.

Manila. \n11 ADB operations in Tonga were suspended from the end of 2000 until June 2002 due to threatened litigation. Upon \nresolution of these issues, the Government requested ADB to resume its assistance with support for the EPSRP.    \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nLessons  learned  from  these  TAs  include  (i)  the  need  to  integrate  existing  disparate \n28. \nreform measures in the various areas related to the EPSRP, both from the Government and aid \nagencies; (ii) greater emphasis on aid coordination; (iii) greater involvement of the Government \nstarting  from  the  design  stage  of  TAs  and  projects  to  ensure  its  ownership;  and  (iv)  less \nexternally  driven  reform  agendas.12  These  lessons  have  been  incorporated  in  the  process  of \npreparing the EPSRP, and in ensuring a high level of aid coordination and cooperation (paras. \n21-25).   \n \n\n2. \n\nFuture Operations \n\n \nADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy for the New Millennium13 focuses on five broad objectives for its \n29. \nPDMCs:  (i)  continuing  support  for  economic,  governance,  and  public  sector  reform;  (ii) \npromoting private sector development; (iii) promoting a more active role of women in the social, \neconomic, and political spheres; (iv) supporting sustainable environmental management; and (v) \nsupporting  poverty  reduction  as  a  unifying  theme.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  ADB  will \ncontinue  to  assist  in  strengthening  the  capacity  for  governance,  economic  management,  and \ntechnology \npublic  services; \ninfrastructure;  strengthening  financial  sector  management;  and  supporting  the  role  of  civil \nsociety.  This regional strategy for the Pacific is the guiding instrument for the country strategy \nfor Tonga (and also other PDMCs).  It is supported by the economic report under preparation.14 \n \n\nthe  development  of  physical  and \n\ninformation \n\nimproving \n\n30. \nThe Government\u2019s development strategy is expressed in its SSDP. The strategy aims at a \nhigher quality of life and standard of living for all Tongans; cultural evolution, individual fulfillment, \nand  gender  equity;  and  political  and  economic  stability.  In  support  of  its  strategic  development \nplan,  the  Government  is  engaging  in  a  comprehensive  program  of  economic  and  public  sector \nreforms,  which  is  viewed  as  essential  to  achieve  the  objectives  of  economic  growth  and  social \nequity. ADB\u2019s strategy of assistance to Tonga supports the Government\u2019s development strategy \nand reform measures. Assistance to the EPSRP is the cornerstone of ADB\u2019s program for Tonga in \nthe next 3 years. Expansion of ADB\u2019s assistance to other sectors is conditional on the return of \nmacroeconomic stability. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nBackground and Rationale \n\n \n\n \n31. \nThe national strategic vision of Tonga has as its key objective the attainment of a higher \nstandard of living for all Tongans. Achievement of this objective has been limited by a low long-\nterm  economic  growth  rate,  and  by  employment  growth  well  below  the  rate  of  increase  of  the \nlabor  force.  The  situation  reflects  policy  and  governance  environments  that  have  discouraged \nprivate  sector  investment,  and  the  crowding-out  effects  of  a  relatively  large  public  sector. \nConsiderable  efforts  by  ADB  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  in  the  past  to  support  reforms  yielded \ndisappointing results, which were attributed to lack of political will. However, while this situation \nhas  created  a  lot  of  skeptics  about  Tonga,  it  also  highlights  the  importance  of  the  right \nmacroeconomic  moment,  where  macroeconomic  vulnerability  creates  not  just  a  need  for \nborrowing  but  an  increased  understanding  of  the  need  for  reforms  and  the  willingness  to \n\n                                                 \n12  These  lessons  were  summarized  in  the  completion  report  for  TA  2528-TON:  Improved  Budget  System  and \nEconomic Management dated 29 June 1999. The completion report also recommended that ADB proceed with the \npreparation of a TA for the EPSRP.  \n\n13 ADB. 2000. Pacific Strategy for the New Millennium. Manila \n14  A  Pacific  Island  economic  report  for  Tonga  was  prepared  under  a  small-scale  TA  3430-TON:  Preparation  of  an \n\nEconomic Report, for US$124,000, approved on 24 April 2000.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nimplement  them.  Moving  forward  now  is  spurred  by  a  number  of  factors\u2014a  worsening  fiscal \nsituation,  disappointing  economic  growth,  and  the  eroded  Tonga  Trust  Fund.  These  factors \nwere  preceded  by  other  significant  changes.  In  January  2000,  the  reform-minded  Prince \nUlukalala  Lavaka  Ata  was  appointed  Prime  Minister.  In  January  2001,  the  King  appointed  a \nsimilarly  reform-minded  minister  of  finance,  who  continues  to  also  hold  the  position  of  Acting \nGovernor of NRBT. Both are strong advocates of reform and have taken the lead responsibility \nfor the EPSRP. It is also important to note that the reform program is strongly supported by the \nPrivy  Council.15  The  Prime  Minister  and  the  minister  of  finance,  both  appointed  with  the \nendorsement  of  the  Privy  Council,  were  selected  because  of  their  recognized  commitment  to \nreform.  Over  the  past  two  years,  the  Privy    Council  has  approved  several  policy  measures  to \nimprove  the  governance  of  PSEs  and  to  lay  the  groundwork  for  their  corporatization  and \nprivatization. These developments indicate that the highest authorities in the country support the \nproposed  reforms.  The  various  changes  that  have  already  taken  place  are  in  line  with  the \nprioritized  development  objectives  and  policies  established  in  the  SSDP.  Now,  and  not  least \nbecause of the tightening fiscal situation, the Government is actively seeking to accelerate the \nreform process by implementing the EPSRP. \n \nB. \n \n32. \n The objective of the EPSRP is to ensure overall macroeconomic stability and to contribute \nto enhanced private sector-led economic growth. Preconditions for reaching this objective are (i) \nachieving  a  sustainable  fiscal  balance,  and  (ii)  improving  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of \nservice delivery by the public sector.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s overall reform program comprises four main areas of reform: (i) fiscal \n33. \nreform, (ii) public service reform, (iii) financial sector reform, and (iv) private sector reform. The \nEPSRP focuses on two of these reform areas: (i) fiscal reform measures aimed at achieving a \nsustainable  fiscal  balance  through  (a)  strengthening  public  expenditure  management,  (b) \nenhancing  revenue  generation,  and  (c)  improving  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  resource \nuse in the public enterprise sector; and (ii) public service reform measures that seek to improve \npublic service delivery to the private sector and the general public by means of (a) establishing \nthe institutional framework for a performance-oriented public service, and (b) promoting efficient \nand effective performance management.  \n  \n \n34. \nThe  EPSRP,  through  these  two  reform  areas,  will  build  the  legal  and  regulatory \nframework and the institutional capacity to achieve macroeconomic stability and, combined with \nfinancial sector and private sector reform, to contribute to accelerated economic growth.  \n \nC. \n \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n1. \n\nEnsuring Sustainable Fiscal Balance \n\n35. \nThe  approach  to  achieving  sustainable  fiscal  balance  includes  (i)  strengthening  public \nexpenditure management, (ii) enhancing revenue generation, and (iii) improving the efficiency and \n\n                                                 \n15 Tonga is a constitutional monarchy. The legislature,  executive, and  judiciary are separated.  The King appoints \nthe  members  of  the  Privy  Council,  which  comprises  members  of  the  Cabinet  and  the  Governors  of  Vava\u2019u  and \nHa\u2019apai.  The  Legislative  Assembly  is  composed  of  the  members  of  the  Cabinet,  the  Privy  Councilors  as  well  as \nrepresentatives  of  the  nobles  and  of  the  people.  The  33  nobles  elect  9  among  themselves  to  the  Legislative \nAssembly  and  the  people  vote  for  9  representatives.  The  members  of  Tonga's  Human  Rights  and  Democracy \nMovement, although not a formal political party, took seven of the nine parliamentary seats open to commoners in \nthe election in March 2002. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\neffectiveness  of  resource  use  in  the  PSEs.  Sustainable  fiscal  balance  requires  changes  in  both \nlegislation and procedures as well as capacity building in key government agencies. Legislation is \nrequired in the area of public finance, audit, governance of PSEs, tax administration and policy, \nand  public  service  administration.  Progress  has  already  been  made  and  drafts  have  been \nprepared for a public finance management act (merging and updating the current Public Finance \nAdministration  and  Public  Revenue  acts),  a  new  public  audit  act,16  and  a  public  enterprise  act. \nProcedural  change  is  needed  to  ensure  (i)  realistic  economic  forecasting  over  at  least  a  3-year \nperiod; (ii) realistic assessment of all budgetary demands by government departments and PSEs; \nand  (iii)  systematic  management  of  the  public  service,  largely  through  a  program  of  devolution. \nThe  Cabinet    incorporated  procedural  changes  referred  to  under  (i)  and  (ii)  in  the  budget \nguidelines for FY2003 approved on 23 January 2002. The devolution of responsibilities to heads \nof departments forms the core of  public service reform (paras. 46-50 and Appendix 5).  \n \n36. \nThe  key  to  achieving  sustainable  fiscal  balance  in  the  short  term  consists  of  a  strong \ngovernment  commitment  to  the  reform  process  and  a  \u201ctop  down\u201d  approach  to  budget  making. \nThe former involves regular meetings at the Cabinet level to supervise the reform process. The \nlatter  begins  with  developing  a  credible  medium-term  fiscal  framework  that  is  used  to  provide \noverall spending limits for all government-sponsored activity, including forward estimates for at \nleast three years beyond the current budget year. In the medium term, the minister of finance \nneeds the legislative authority to manage the budget execution process. Here the key feature is \ncommitment control to ensure that government spending can adapt to changing circumstances, \nand to ensure that government departments have limited ability to spend beyond agreed upon \nbudget caps.  \n \nThe current revenue administration is operating below desirable standards.  With limited \n37. \ncomputerization, an inadequate number of experienced staff, and lack of training, combined with \nthe  absence  of  a  comprehensive  and  appropriate  set  of  legislative  provisions  to  enforce \ncompliance,  the  administration  is  not  in  a  position  to  effectively  administer  either  the  current \nlegislation  or  the  proposed  system  of  taxes.  The  Government  estimates  US$5  million  in \noutstanding  taxes,  and  it  is  suggested  that  an  effective  audit  program  would  reveal  an  even \nlarger amount.17 Hence, there is an urgent need for the tax administration to be strengthened in \norder both to improve revenues under the current tax regime and pave the way for tax reform. \nHowever  the  benefit  of  increased  revenues  from  improved  tax  administration  will  only  come \ntowards the end of 2003 and thereafter, when capacity for audit and compliance enforcement is \nenhanced  through  hiring  and  training  of  new  staff  and  centralizing  tax  administration  into  one \nlocation.  \n\n \n\n38. \nThe proposed initial improvements to the tax regime include a new legislative basis for \ntax collection and training of staff, particularly in audit and compliance procedures. This system \nhas  to  be  put  in  place  well  in  advance  of  the  proposed  new  tax  system  to  allow  for  the \ndevelopment  of  the  administration  prior  to  the  major  challenges  created  by  a  new  tax  system. \nThe  legislative  changes  to  be  coupled  with  a  general  modernization  of  current  provisions \ninclude: (i) redesigning the objection/appeals process, (ii) redesigning the penalties regime, (iii) \nprovision for seizure and sale of assets to recover outstanding debts, and (iv) introduction of the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) valuation system.  \n \n                                                 \n16  The current Public Audit Act does not extend sufficient protection and independence to the auditor general, whom    \nCabinet may remove on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. The act sets minimal standards and does not \nrequire an analysis and performance report on the financial accounts of ministries, departments, and government \nagencies.  \n\n17  Estimates from the Ministry of Finance.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nThe  adjustment  costs  of  improving  tax  administration  are  estimated  at  US$1.5  million \n39. \nand  include  (i)  hiring  and  training  of  additional  staff,  (ii)  automation  of  tax  and  customs \nadministration,  and  (iii)  centralizing  the  location  of  the  Revenue  Department  to  enable \nautomation. The expected benefits arising from improved collection effort will be a major factor \nin ensuring that fiscal balance is sustained subsequent to FY 2005.   \n \n40. \nThe current tax system in Tonga relies heavily on foreign trade taxes, particularly those \non imports.18 It is affected by an extensive array of exemptions, allowances, and loopholes that \nresult in inequities and inefficiency in tax administration.19 The income tax base is narrow, and \nthe whole taxation system has become regressive. To stimulate the growth of the private sector \nand spread the tax burden across the community, it is proposed to shift the emphasis of taxes \nfrom  \u201ctrade  taxes\u201d  (namely  ports  and  services  tax  and  import  duties),  to  a  limited  domestic \nconsumption  tax.    This  tax  would  be  collected  primarily  at  the  import  stage  and,  with  larger \nbusinesses, at the point of sale of imported or locally produced goods and services.  Coupled to \nthis  would  be  a  reworking  of  individual  and  corporate  income  taxes  to  provide  a  fairer  system \nwith  generally  lower  rates  of  tax  and  the  abolition  of  the  ports  and  services  tax.  PFTAC  has \nassisted  the  Government  in  the  preparation  of  this  new  taxation  system.  A  cabinet  paper  with \nspecific recommendations on tax changes was  discussed by the Cabinet on 23 January 2002 \nand resulted in its approval to undertake wider consultations on the proposed tax reform and to \ndraft  legislation.  The  Government  is  also  in  the  process  of  reviewing  the  tariff  system  in  the \ncontext of the planned accession to the WTO. However, the EPSRP includes improvements in \nthe  current  tax  administration  (para.  35),  as  they  are  necessary  to  achieve  fiscal  balance  and \nare  a  precondition  for  the  new  tax  regime.  The  introduction  of  the  new  tax  regime  itself  is \noutside  the  scope  of  the  EPSRP.  An  outline  of  the  proposed  tax  reform  is  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix A.  \n \n41. \nTonga has an extensive number of PSEs and trading activities owned or partly owned by \nthe Government. The number of PSEs was substantially reduced from 45 in 1997 to 32 in 2002 \n(Table 1).  \n \n42.  Many  of  these  enterprises  are  performing  poorly  and  have  required  additional  financial \nsupport from the Government, resulting in large and unproductive investments in PSEs, which \ncontinue to drain the government budget. Little reliable information is available on employment, \nrevenue,  or  profitability  of  PSEs,  and  most  have  never  paid  any  dividend  to  the  Government \nwhile entertaining higher salary structures than the public service. \n \n\nTable 1: Number and Legal Status of Public Sector Enterprises,1997 and 2002  \n\nLegal Status \n\nCompanies \n\nFinancial Institutions \n\nStatutory Corporations \n\nBusiness Activities \n\n1997\n\n2002\n\n25\n\n3\n\n4\n\n13\n\n15\n\n3\n\n4\n\n10\n\n32\n\n       Total  \nSource: Government Investment Unit, January 2002. \n\n45\n\n \n\n \n                                                 \n18 Trade taxes account for about 13% of GDP at market prices and provide around 65% of government tax revenue. \n\nSales and other taxes provide about 14% of tax revenue, while direct taxes provide about 20%. \n\n19 Database of  PFTAC. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nThere is a commitment to act on the Privy Council decision of December 1995 that MOF \n43. \nshould  submit  a  proposal  for  a  complete  review  of  all  government  investments  to  secure \ndividend payments. A Government Investment Unit (GIU)20 was established within MOF in July \n1999 to implement this review, to monitor PSE performance, and to prepare selected PSEs for \nprivatization and business activities for corporatization. A significant step forward was made in \nApril  2001  with  the  Privy  Council\u2019s  approval  of  Tonga's  overarching  investment  policy.  This \nframework  provides  a  benchmark  for  assessing  government  assets  and  guides  GIU  in  the \nimplementation  of  privatization  and  corporatization.  Since  1997, \nthe  Government  has \ncorporatized  three  business  activities  and  has  undertaken  substantial  preparatory  work  to \nproceed  with  the  corporatization  of  an  additional  four:    the  Agricultural  Machinery  Pool,  \u2018Eua \nForestry, Post Office, and Government Printing.  \n \nReforms to be sponsored under the EPSRP build on the corporatization and privatization \n44. \npolicy framework and the public investment policy, approved by the Cabinet in March and April \n2001, respectively, as well as the Cabinet\u2019s approval (i) to draft a public enterprise act, given on \n23 January 2002; and (ii) to corporatize the Post Office, given on 30 January 2002. The EPSRP \nincludes  the  following  sequenced  reform  measures:  (i)  enacting    the  public  enterprise  act21 \nincluding rules and procedures regulating the relationship between PSEs and Government; and \n(ii) corporatization of at least two government business activities by the end of 2002. MFAT is \ncontinuing to provide TA in these areas, and will consider mobilizing additional specific expertise \nwhen required.  \n \n45. \nThe  third  element  of  fiscal  reform  is  the  privatization  and  corporatization  of  selected \ngovernment  business  activities.  The  financial  adjustment  costs  arising  from  this  activity  are \nestimated  at  around  US$6  million  over  2002-2004.  They  include  the  writing  off  of  accounts \nreceivable, redundancy costs, and provision of working capital less any proceeds from sale of \nassets.  This  amount  does  not  include  contingent  liabilities,  such  as  loans  guaranteed  by  the \nGovernment (US$11.8 million) and loans onlent  by the Government (US$11.9 million).    \n \n  \n\nBuilding a Performance-Based Public Service \n\n 2.  \n\n46. \nThe  need  for  public  service  reform  is  not  new.  The  Cabinet  established  three \nsubcommittees  on  public  service  reform  in  2000  that  reported  on  (i)  the  core  functions  of  the \nGovernment as prescribed by existing laws and regulations, (ii) a plan for public service reform, \nand (iii) the means of implementation. In September 2001, a reform subcommittee of the Cabinet \nchaired  by  the  deputy  prime  minister  was  established  to  ensure  an  appropriate  mechanism  to \ncontrol the strategic direction of the proposed reform program.  The Cabinet also approved the \nsetting  up  of  a  secretariat  to  manage  and  coordinate  the  EPSRP,  and  finalized  the  overall \norganizational structure, which included the appointment of a director for the secretariat, on 23 \nJanuary  2002.  Public  service  reform  measures  seek  to  improve  public  service  delivery  to  the \nprivate sector and the general public by means of (i) establishing the institutional framework for a \nperformance-oriented  public  service,  and  (ii)  promoting  efficient  and  effective  performance \nmanagement. \n \nThe public service establishment in FY2001 totaled 5,443 positions, with 562 vacancies \n47. \nand  461  employees  eligible  for  retirement.  In  addition,  there  were  approximately  700  casual \nworkers paid on a daily basis, although some had been casual for a considerable period of time. \n\n                                                 \n20 Since November 1999, GIU has received TA from MFAT.   \n21  A  draft  public  enterprise  act  has  been  prepared  and  will  be  introduced  into  the  Legislative  Assembly  before \n\nDecember 2002.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nThe  wage  and  salary  bill  constituted  57%  of  the  Government\u2019s  current  expenditure  in  FY2001 \nand  crowded  out  essential  expenditures  on  operation  and  maintenance.  The  Government \naccepts that the size of the public service is unnecessarily large and is committed to rightsizing \nin  a  manner  that  does  not  compromise  the  quality  of  service  delivery.  The  overall  target  for \nrationalization of the public service is expressed in a reduction of wages and salaries from 57% \nto 50% of current expenditure over a 3-year period. In conjunction with the budget guidelines for \nFY2003,  the  Cabinet  instructed  heads  of  departments  to  base  their  departmental  budget \nsubmission on this target. This will be achieved through a combination of (i) natural attrition, (ii) \nenforcement of the retirement age of 60,22 (iii) voluntary early retirement over the age of 50 with \ncompensation  payment,23  (iv)  voluntary  reduction  of  working  hours,  (v)  part-time  employment, \n(vi) reduced entitlement for approved study leave to half-pay for the first year only, (vii) reduction \nof the sick leave entitlement, (viii) reduced annual leave, (ix) freeze of annual salary increments \nfor  2  years,  (x)  introduction  of  merit-based  salary  policy,  and  (xi)  targeted  downsizing.  The \nEPSRP  combines  rightsizing  with  general  organizational  changes  of  the  public  service,  which \ninclude  the  establishment  of  a  public  service  commission  to  strengthen  policy  support  to  the \nCabinet  and  to  improve  performance  management.  The  current  public  service  regulations \n(Estacode)  and  the  Government  Act  are  inconsistent  with  the  principles  of  good  governance. \nThis will be rectified through  a new public service act with revised regulations.  \n \n48. \nThe  third  cabinet  subcommittee  recommended  that  the  planning,  monitoring,  and \nreporting  functions  of  departments  be  strengthened.  The  Cabinet  noted  the  need  to  devolve \nselected responsibilities to line ministries and to have heads of department made accountable \nfor  the  performance  of  their  departments.  The  EPSRP  includes  strengthening  of  performance \nmanagement functions with model plans and reporting formats. Accountability will be enhanced \nwith the introduction of performance agreements for heads of departments and holders of key  \npositions. \n \n49. \nAn  analysis  of  a  baseline  survey  to  establish  a  profile  for  the  Tongan  public  service \nidentified the need for a performance-based remuneration policy.  The job grades, occupational \nclassifications,  and  payscales  of  the  public  service  are  inconsistent  with  the  need  to  reward \nmerit performance and attract and retain competent staff.  A job evaluation exercise integrated \nwith a revision of the current remuneration policy is planned to address this situation. \n \n50. \nThe estimated financial adjustment costs relating to public service reform over the 3-year \nperiod 2002-2004 comprise (i) pension payments of US$4 million, (ii) compensation payments \nof  US$2  million \nfor  voluntary  early  retirement  and  retrenched  public  servants,  (iii) \nimplementation  costs  of  US$0.2  million  for  human  resources  management  information  system \n(HRMIS),  (iv)  establishment  costs  of  US$0.5  million  for  the  reform  secretariat  and  social \nmonitoring  unit,  and  (v)  additional  mitigation  measures  of  US$1  million.  Savings  of  around \nUS$2.6  million  are  expected  from  changes  in  the  size  and  composition  of  the  public  service. \nHowever,  these  benefits  will  most  likely  accrue  towards  the  end  of  the  loan  period  and \nthereafter, due to the varied nature of the proposed rightsizing measures.  \n \n\n                                                 \n22 With the enforcement of the current retirement age of 60, 461 public servant positions (or 9% of the 4,881 filled and \n\nestablished positions) will be vacated. \n\n23The compensation to be awarded to early retirees will be 5% of respective current salary multiplied by the difference \nin  years  between  the  retiree\u2019s  current  age  and  the  official  retirement  age  of  60.  This  compensation  is  midrange \nwhen  compared  with  compensation  offered  by  other  PDMCs,  and  is  seen  by  the  Establishment  Office  to  be \nsufficient to attract an adequate number of volunteer early retirees.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nD. \n \n\nSocial and Environmental Issues \n\n1. \n\nSocial  and Poverty Impact \n\n15\n\n \nTonga  has  achieved  relatively  high  social  indicators  as  a  result  of  government \n51. \ninvestments  in  social  sectors  and  service  provision  over  the  past  30  years.  The  constrained \nfiscal situation will have short and medium-term implications for the provision of all government \nservices if reform measures designed to regain fiscal balance are not introduced within the near \nfuture. With the implementation of the public service reform, aimed at increasing the efficiency \nand effectiveness of the public service, it is anticipated that service delivery to the general public \nwill improve in the medium term.  \n \nThe  major  socioeconomic  impacts  over  the  next  2-3  years  are  likely  be  a  reduction  in \n52. \nincome of approximately 500 or more households, mainly in the capital, Nuku\u2019alofa, due to the \nenforcement  of \nthe  retirement  age,  early  voluntary  retirement,  or  retrenchment  with \ncompensation. Lump sum payments are unlikely to provide long-term social security for retirees. \nHouseholds  depending  on  a  single  income  from  a  public  sector  employee  who  retires  or  is \nretrenched will be the most vulnerable, especially those on a low salary scale and/or where the \nhousehold  has limited access to land. Amendments of the current tax and customs legislation \nwill  enable  the  Government  to  collect  unpaid  taxes  and  duties.  It  is  safe  to  assume  that  the \nmajority of the outstanding taxes are owed by private enterprises and  high-income earners.  \n \n53. \nAssuming  that  Tonga\u2019s  strong  customs  of  family  assistance  will  cushion  the  impact  of \nreduced  public  sector  expenditure  and  provide  traditional  social  safety  net  functions,  the  high \ndependency  ratio  will  continue  to  rise.  Currently  about  20%  of  the  population  provide  for  the \nother  80%.  Those  in  employment  in  Tonga  will  have  increased  financial  obligations,  and  the \ndemand on relatives working overseas will increase.  \n \nTo  mitigate  the  negative  impact  of  rightsizing,  the  EPSRP  includes  social  safety  net \n54. \narrangements. Efforts will be made to ensure that the population of the outer islands will not be \naffected disproportionately. Affected staff (voluntary early retirees and involuntary redundancies) \nwill receive separation payments and will have access to counseling and training to be arranged \nby  the  economic  and  social  impact  monitoring  unit  under  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office  (PMO). \nThis  includes  community-based  financial  management  training,  and  technical  and  business \ntraining  to  mitigate  the  overall  social  and  gender  impacts  of  affected  staff  (paras.  55-57). \nDetailed retrenchment plans will be prepared by departments. The plans will be reviewed by the \neconomic  and  social  impact  monitoring  unit  for  consistency  with  the  principles  of  equity \nconsiderations  and  protection  of  the  vulnerable  as  expressed  in  the  ADB  Social  Protection \nStrategy.24 Mitigation measures will include provisions to ensure that women, public servants in \nthe outer islands, and other affected workers vulnerable to poverty (i) will have equal opportunity \nto participate in the training programs and avail of small business opportunities, and (ii) will not \nbe impoverished by the retrenchment.  \n \n55. \nThe proportion of women in public sector employment may decline, and low-paid female \nclerical workers are likely to be the most vulnerable to retrenchment. Reduction in public sector \nemployment opportunities and possible cuts to expenditure on secondary education are likely to \nincrease  the  number  of  unemployed  young  people.  Self-employment  will  be  an  option  for \nwomen  and  unemployed  youth,  which  will  be  facilitated  through  short-term  business  and \ntechnical skills training. \n\n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2001. Social Protection Strategy. Manila \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n56. \nAn efficient and performance-oriented public service will have positive social impacts by \nimproving the quality of government services to the public. However, Tonga already has a deficit \nof skilled and professional people in the health and postsecondary technical training sectors. It \nis  very  likely  that  these  skilled  public  servants  will  opt  for  early  retirement,  seek  opportunities \nabroad,  and  join  the  ranks  of  Tongan  migrants.  It  is  therefore  essential  that  reform  measures \ninclude  incentives  to  retain  government  employees  with  essential  skills.  These  comprise  (i) \nintroduction  of  performance-based  contracts  for  heads  of  departments  and  senior  public \nservants,  (ii)  revision  of  the  current  remuneration  policy,  and  (iii)  introduction  of  a  merit-based \npay policy.   \n\n \n57. \nAnticipated  private  sector  growth  will  increase  jobs  and  opportunities  for  self-\nemployment  and  will  in  turn  reduce  youth  unemployment.    However  this  requires  that  post-\nsecondary training be more closely matched to labor market demands in Tonga than is currently \nthe case.  \n \nSocial monitoring and public consultation constitute a key element in the reform process. \n58. \nA Tongan participatory/public relations specialist25 is assisting the Government in a broad-based \nconsultative  process  that  engages  members  of  the  public  sector,  the  private  sector,  and  civil \nsociety  through  workshops  and  seminars  targeting  specific  groups  (politicians,  public  sector \nofficials, chamber of commerce, churches, nongovernment organizations [NGOs]) and hearings \nthat bring together representatives of the Government, the business community, NGOs, and the \ngeneral public. Further details on the social and poverty impact are in Appendix 4.  \n \n\n2. \n\nMitigation Measures  \n\n \n59. \nIn  addition  to  financial  compensation  packages  for  voluntary  early  retirees  and \nredundancies,  a  range  of  nonfinancial  mitigation  measures  will  be  available.  Many  public \nservants taking early retirement will still be potentially economically active, and some will have \nskills  and  experience  that  will  make  them  attractive  to  private  sector  employers.    However,  a \nlarge  number  of  civil  servants  who  retire  or  are  retrenched  will  be  in  the  low-pay,  low-skill \ncategory. The Government is concerned about the future of people in this group.  A number of \nretraining  options  will  be  available.  Training  needs  assessments  will  be  carried  out  by  the \neconomic and social impact monitoring unit after the staffing plans have been prepared by each \ndepartment.  Funds  have  been  earmarked  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  to  ensure  that \ncounterpart funds are available for these mitigation measures.  \n\n \n60. \nThere is broad agreement from the private sector that two types of skills are in demand: \n(i) bookkeeping/basic accounting and the use of simple accounting software packages; and (ii) \nword processing and spreadsheet computer applications, and office automation. These possible \njob  opportunities  are  of  particular  interest    mainly  to  clerical  staff,  who  will  be  encouraged  to \nparticipate  in  training  offering  these  skills.  Other  training  options  include  small  business \nmanagement,  technical  skills  and  horticulture.  A  number  of  NGOs  and  government  training \ninstitutions  are  offering  short-term  vocational  training  courses.  These  institutions  will  be \nengaged by the  economic and social impact monitoring unit to carry out tailor-made programs \n(see Appendix 4). \n \n\n                                                 \n25 ADB. 2001.

Prudent financial \n61. \nmanagement practices will be needed to make these funds last.  Because of cultural factors and \ncustomary communal obligations and pressures, training programs targeting only those who will \nbe  leaving  public  service  will  not  be  sufficient.  It  will  be  necessary  to  gain  broad-based \nunderstanding\u2014among  the  families  of  people  leaving  government  employment\u2014of  the \nimportance of financial management at the household level to avoid poverty and increase social \nsecurity.  This  will  be  achieved  through  training  and  awareness  programs  that  will  involve  both \nrural and urban families throughout the country and will be implemented by selected civil society \norganizations. \n \n3. \n\nEnvironmental Issues \n\n \nThe EPSRP is classified as Category C in ADB\u2019s environmental classification system. Its \n62. \nenvironmental  impact  is  expected  to  be  minimal.  The  Program  does  not  deal  directly  with \nenvironmental concerns.  \n \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED LOAN \n\nAmount of Loan and Source of Funds \n\nInterest, Maturity, and Utilization Period \n\nA. \n \nThe  Government  has  asked  ADB  to  provide  a  loan  of  US$10  million  equivalent  from  its \n63. \nSpecial Funds resources to support economic and public sector reforms. The size of the loan is \nbased  on  the  scope  and  costs  of  (i)  fiscal  reforms,  and  (ii)  public  service  reforms.  It  takes  into \naccount  the  importance  and  urgency  of  these  reforms,  and  the  availability  of  funding  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s overall reform program. The total funds required for the reform measures amount to \nUS$15.2  million  over  the  period  2002-2004.  The  proceeds  from  the  program  loan  cover  about \n66% of these financial adjustment costs.  \n \nB. \n \n64. \nThe loan will bear a 24-year maturity, including a grace period of 8 years, and 1% interest \ncharge during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The loan is expected to be utilized over a 20-\nmonth period.  \n \nC. \n \n65.  MOF will be the Executing Agency for the EPSRP and will be responsible for its overall \nimplementation. A fiscal reform team with five senior government officials will be established by \nMOF. The other key agency involved in the implementation of the Program is the PMO. A public \nsector  reform  team,  led  by  the  establishment  office  in  the  PMO,  will  be  responsible  for  the \ncoordination  and  implementation  of  these  reform  activities.  The  Government  established  a \ncabinet  committee  for  reform  in  2000,  and  the  Cabinet  approved  the  overall  organizational \nstructure  of  the  reform  program  and  the  EPSRP  on  23  January  2002.  This  includes  the \nestablishment of a reform secretariat and the appointment of a senior public servant to head it. It \nwill  also  have  additional  staff  and  necessary  resources,  acceptable  to  ADB.  Program \nimplementation  will  be  coordinated  on  a  day-to-day  basis  by  the  secretariat  and  will  be \nundertaken by the two reform teams, which will report monthly to the Cabinet through the reform \nsecretariat  and  the  cabinet  committee  for  reform.  TA  for  implementation  of  the  public  service \nreform will be provided under the EPSRP  (see Appendix 5).  \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nProcurement \n\nDisbursement \n\n \nD. \n \n66. \nIn  accordance  with  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for \nprogram loans,26 goods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries, other \nthan those items specified on a negative list (Appendix 6) and imports financed by other bilateral \nand multilateral sources, will be procured in accordance with standard public sector procedures \nin  the  Kingdom  of  Tonga  and  normal  commercial  practices  for  procurement  by  the  private \nsector,  acceptable  to  ADB.  ADB  has  ensured  that  standard  public  and  private  sector \nprocurement  procedures  used  in  the  country  are  adequate  in  terms  of  competition  and \nefficiency. In the case of goods commonly traded on the international commodity markets, they \nwill be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB.  \n \nE. \n \n67. \nThe proceeds of the loan will be disbursed only to finance the foreign exchange costs of \na broad range of imports, subject to the negative list of ineligible items (Appendix 6). The loan \nwill be disbursed on the basis of a certification provided by the Borrower confirming that, in each \nyear in which EPSRP proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of total imports minus \n(i)  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and  (iii)  imports  financed  under \nother official development assistance, will be equivalent to or greater than the amount expected \nto be disbursed during the year. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds \nand to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. \n \nF. \n \n68. \nCounterpart funds to be generated from the proceeds of the program loan will be used to \nfinance  part  of  the  local  currency  costs  relating  to  the  implementation  of  the  fiscal  and  public \nservice  reforms.  The  total  financial  adjustment  costs  include  (i)  US$1.5  million  for  improved  tax \nadministration,  (ii)  US$6.0  million  for  corporatization  and  privatization  of  selected  government \nbusiness activities, and (iii) US$7.7 million for public service reform. The loan proceeds of US$10 \nmillion  equivalent  represent  about    66%  of  the  estimated  total  adjustment  costs  of  around \nUS$15.2 million. To mitigate the anticipated impacts of public service reform, at least 20% of the \ncounterpart  funds  have  been  earmarked  to  assist  those  affected.  Although  savings  of  around \nUS$7  million  are  expected  to  result  from  reform  activities  supported  by  the  proposed  program \nloan,  these  benefits  are  anticipated  to    materialize  only  towards  the  end  of  the  loan  period  and \nthereafter; thus, they will help to enhance the sustainability of postreform fiscal balances. \n \nG. \n \nADB will carry out periodic reviews of the progress of implementing the EPSRP, and will \n69. \nassess  the  impact  of  the  Program  on  vulnerable  groups  and  other  sectors  of  the  economy. \nFormal  reviews  will  be  undertaken  jointly  by  the  reform  secretariat  and  ADB  every  6  months. \nThe  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  outcome  of  the  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  that  have  implications  for  the  implementation  of  the \nProgram,  and  will  provide  ADB  with  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  policy  proposals  by  other \nmajor funding agencies.  The representatives of the Government, ADB, and other major funding \nagencies  for  the  EPSRP  will  meet  at  least  once  every  6  months  to  review  program \nimplementation. The meetings will continue after the closing of the loan and will form part of the \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n                                                 \n26 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\ncountry  strategy  and  program  (CSP).  A  key  focus  of  monitoring  will  be  performance  on  the \nbroad policy reforms, the results of which will be included in the CSP updates.  \n \n70. \nIn addition to quarterly progress reports on EPSRP performance (to be prepared by the \nreform  secretariat),  the  Government  will  submit  a  program  completion  report  to  ADB  within  3 \nmonths of the loan closing date. This report will evaluate the implementation of the policy reform \nmeasures under the EPSRP, their impact on the economy, lessons learned during the EPSRP \nperiod, and any further reforms and assistance required in the medium term.  \n \n71. \nThe program loan covers the period from April 2002 to December 2003. The loan funds \nwill be released in two tranches of equal size. The time-bound policies and actions to be carried \nout  under  the  EPSRP  are  described  in  the  DPL  (Appendix  3)  and  are  contained  in  the  policy \nmatrix (Appendix 2). The first tranche of US$5 million equivalent will be made available upon loan \neffectiveness.  The  second  tranche  will  be  made  available  when  all  conditions  of  the  second \ntranche  have  been  fulfilled,  as  specified  in  the  policy  matrix.  This  is  targeted  for  March  2003; \nhowever, should the conditions be satisfied earlier, the second tranche may be released earlier.  \n \n72. \nIn  addition  to  preparatory  steps  taken  prior  to  June  2001,  the  Government  has  also \nproceeded  with  the  following  first  tranche  conditions  to  ensure  that    fiscal  balance  can  be \nachieved and the public sector reform can be implemented in a timely and efficient manner.  At \nthe end of January 2002, the situation was as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nto  exceed \n\nintroduction of a temporary hiring freeze on 1 July 2001, which was converted to \na permanent hiring freeze on 23 January 2002;  \ncabinet approval (as part of the budget guidelines adopted on 23 January 2002) \nof (a) budget preparation to include an estimate of government revenues from all \nsources,  including  anticipated  revenues  from  the  Tonga  Trust  Fund,  tax \nrevenues,  and  departmental  cost  recovery  through  fees  and  charges;  (b) \nestablishing  an  overall  expenditure  ceiling  which,  on  the  basis  of  the  forecast, \nwould reestablish fiscal balance between recurrent expenditures and government \nrevenues  no  later  than  FY2005;  (c)  expenditure  ceiling  to  be  set  to  cover  all \ngovernment  spending  on  departmental  budgets  and  public  enterprises  that  can \nreasonably  be  foreseen;  (d)  individual  expenditure  allocations  to  ministries, \nalthough  subject  to  negotiation  during  budget  finalization,    to  be  set  so  as  not \ncollectively \n(net  of  nondepartmental \nexpenditure); \ncabinet  instructions  to  all  heads  of  department,  as  per  budget  guidelines \napproved  on  23  January  2002,  to  prepare  their  annual  budget  estimates  with  a \nview to reducing the wage and salary share of the Government\u2019s cash spending \nnet of debt services from 57% budgeted in FY2002 to 50% in FY2005;  \ncabinet  notification  to  all  departments  and  government  agencies  on  23  January \n2002 that no further extension of credit will be allowed without prior approval by \nthe minister of finance, in accordance with existing legislation, and that monthly \nreports show no new arrears starting March 2002;  \ncabinet approval of the organizational structure of the reform program, including \nthe  establishment  of  a  reform  secretariat  and  appointment  of  a  director  for  the \nsecretariat; \ncabinet approval on 23 January 2003 to update the public finance administration, \npublic revenue, and public audit acts, and to proceed with the drafting of a public \nenterprises act ;   \n\nthe  aggregate  ceiling \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n73. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\ndrafts of the public finance management act and the public enterprise acts to be \navailable and commencement of the legislative process on 8 March 2002;  \ncabinet  discussion  on  23  January  2002  of  the  proposed  tax  reform  and \ninstructions to the minister of finance to proceed with wider public consultations \nand to prepare required legislation; and \ncabinet approval on 30 January 2002 of the corporatization of the Post Office.  \n\nThe second tranche release conditions are as follows:  \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nAn  economic  and  social  impact  monitoring  unit  will  be  established  within  the \nPMO/Central Planning Department.   \nA new public finance management act will be enacted to strengthen the ability of \nMOF to maintain the integrity of the fiscal framework.   \nAmendments  to  the  current  tax  and  customs  legislation  will  be  enacted  with  a \nview to strengthening tax administration and enforcing compliance with customs, \nsales, and income taxes.  \nA  public  enterprises  act  will  be  enacted  to  regulate  the  relationship  between \npublic enterprises and the Government.   \nA  public  service  act  will  be  enacted  to  regulate  the  operations  of  the  public \nservice. \nAn  HRMIS  will  have  been  developed  and  become  fully  operational  within  the \nPMO.  \n\nVI. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n74.  \nIn addition to the loan, it is proposed that ADB provide TA of US$700,000 to support the \nreform secretariat and the establishment office in the PMO with the implementation of the EPSRP \npublic service reforms in building a performance-oriented public service. The TA will (i) facilitate \ngood governance practices and strengthen the planning, monitoring, and reporting capabilities of \nthe ministries; (ii) establish the central HRMIS to provide users with timely, accurate and relevant \nestablishment information; (iii) introduce performance accountability for heads of departments; (iv) \nsupport  the  introduction  of  performance-oriented  and  merit-based  remuneration  policies  and \nprocedures;  and  (v)  assist  in  the  preparation  of  regulations  and  implementation  guidelines    for \nnew  legislation  under  the  EPSRP.  MOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.    The  EPSRP \nreform  subcommittee  of  the  Cabinet  will  provide  overall  guidance  on  implementation.  The \nGovernment will establish a public service reform secretariat under the PMO and will provide (i) \ntwo full-time counterparts, supported by part-time subproject teams; (ii) office accommodation; (iii) \nlocal transportation; and (iv) secretarial support services. The TA will finance 28 person-months of \ninternational consulting services, HRMIS software and license fees, job evaluation methodology, \nworkshops  and  surveys.  ADB  will  select  and  engage  the  team  of  individual  consultants  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The TA will be financed by ADB on \na grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program.  Additional information is provided in Appendix 5.  \n \n\nVII. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS \n\nBenefits \n\nA. \n \n75. \nThe  economic  and  public  sector  reforms  supported  by  the  Program  will  restore  fiscal \nstability, increasing the efficiency of the public sector and creating a conducive environment for \nprivate  sector  growth.  Amendments  to  the  current  tax  and  customs  legislation  and  their \nenforcement  by  a  strengthened  tax  administration  will  not  only  ensure  that  outstanding  taxes, \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nthe \n\nRisks \n\nimprove \n\ninvestment  climate \n\nestimated  at  US$5  million,  will  be  collected,  but  will  also  help  in  achieving  fiscal  balance  and \nimproved  service  delivery.  They  will  also  ensure  transparent  and  predictable  taxation,  reduce \ncorrupt  practices,  and  subsequently \nin  Tonga.  The \ncorporatization  of  government  business  activities  will  fully  expose  these  entities  to  market \nforces,  ensuring  efficient  and  cost-effective  service  delivery  to  their  customers  and  creating \nequal  conditions  with  private  service  providers.  The  EPSRP  will  help  to  achieve  rightsizing  of \nthe  public  service,  while  improving  its  effectiveness  and  efficiency  by  means  of  performance \norientation  and  accountability  mechanisms.  A  key  element  to  achieve  this  is  by  devolving \nfinancial and human resource responsibilities to heads of departments. It will enable a demand- \ndriven and flexible service delivery to the general public and to the private sector in particular. In \nturn, this will improve public sentiments regarding the Government and its employees. Enforcing \nthe established retirement age of 60 and offering voluntary retirement from age 50 will open up \ncareer prospects to younger public servants who otherwise would opt to migrate. These benefits \nwill  offset  short-term  negative  social  impacts.    The  reforms  will  also  increase  economic \nresilience by reducing vulnerability to external circumstances created by the currently excessive \ndependence on overseas remittances and taxes on imported goods. \n \nB. \n \n76. \nPolitical authority is highly centralized  in the King and the Cabinet, and the Government \nexerts a high degree of control over the economy.  The successful implementation of reform will \nrequire  considerable  and  sustained  political  will  to  (i)  delegate  an  increased  share  of \nmanagement  responsibilities  to  government  departments  within  the  reform  framework;  and  (ii)  \ncreate a transparent, consistent, and responsive policy environment. To date, such risks have \nbeen mitigated by the strong commitment of most senior government officials to push through \nthe key policy reforms.  The Government\u2019s establishment of a public-private sector consultative \ncommittee in 1998 was an acknowledgement of the importance of increased public participation \nin the decision-making process. Reform measures have been in preparation for some time, but \nuntil  recently  have  not  been  acted  upon  by  the  Cabinet.  Hence,  they  have  not  been  placed \nbefore the Privy Council and the Parliament. The reform program is strongly supported by the \nPrivy  Council.  The  Prime  Minister  and  the  minister  of  finance,  both  appointed  with  the \nendorsement  of  the  Privy  Council,  were  selected  because  of  their  recognized  commitment  to \nreform.  Over the past 2 years, the Privy Council has also approved several policy measures to \nimprove the governance of PSEs and to lay the groundwork for corporatization and privatization.  \nThese  developments  indicate  that  the  proposed  reforms  are  supported  by  the  highest \nauthorities in the country. \n \n77. \nFor  the  first  time,  Tonga  is  confronted  with  a  situation  that  leaves  the  Government  no \noption but to reform. The fast-deteriorating fiscal situation, the disappointing economic growth\u2014\nafter  the  devastation  caused  by  tropical  cyclone  Waka,  GDP  growth  is  now  estimated  to  be \nbelow  1.5%\u2014and,  most  critical,  the  disappearance  of  the  safety  net,  the  eroded  Tonga  Trust \nFund,  have  together    shaped  the  necessary  specific  \u201cmacroeconomic  moment\u201d  where \nmacroeconomic  vulnerability  has  generated  broad-based  commitment  to  reform.    The \nParliament  is  fully  aware  of  this  situation  and  is  expected  to  fully  support  the  proposed \nlegislative reforms.  \n \n78. \nA major risk is that the Government may lack the capacity and management resources \nto  implement  some  of  the  important  reform  measures,  despite  strong  political  will.  The  TA  for \nbuilding  a  performance-based  public  service  will  support  the  implementation  of  the  public \nservice  reform,  and  activities  associated  with  the  rightsizing  of  the  public  service.  Assistance \nprovided  by  AusAID  on  public  financial  management,  training  of  staff  in  the  Revenue \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDepartment,  and  the  provision  of  two  long-term  advisors  for  tax  and  customs  administration; \nPFTAC\u2019s continuing support for  tax legislation and the tax reform;  and MFAT\u2019s support to the \nGIU on commercialization and privatization of PSEs will all facilitate the timely implementation of \nthe reform agenda.  \n \n\nVIII.  ASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  conditions  for  tranche  release  and  the  standard  assurances,  the \n\n79. \nGovernment has assured ADB that \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nthe policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Loan Agreement, \nas described in the Government\u2019s DPL, will continue in effect for the duration of \nthe program period; \n\nit will promptly adopt the other policies and take the other actions included in the \nEPSRP,  as  described  in  the  policy  matrix,  and  ensure  that  these  policies  and \nactions continue in effect for the duration of the EPSRP; \n\nit will ensure adequate representation of women on committees, task forces, and \nother  public  bodies  dealing  with  the  building  of  a  performance-based  public \nservice; and \n\nit  will  ensure  that  the  private  sector  and  civil  society  groups  are  adequately \ninvolved  in  implementing  the  reforms  through  membership  in  task  forces  and \ncommittees dealing with reform issues.  \n\nIX. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n80. \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 8,020,000 to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Economic and Public Sector \nReform Program from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources  with an interest charge at the rate of 1% \nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  24  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.  \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n 25 April 2002\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n \n\n \n\n           TADAO CHINO \n                President \n\n \n\n\fDesign Summary \n\nPerformance Targets \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nPROGRAM LOGICAL FRAMEWORK \n \n \n\n \n\u2022  Economic growth rate exceeds 3% by \n\n\u2022  Annual inflation rate falls below 5% by \n\nFY2004. \n\nFY2004. \n\nSources of Information \nMonitoring System \n \n\n\u2022  Budget statement \n\u2022  National accounts \n\u2022 \n\nInternational Monetary Fund \nArticle IV Consultations \n\n \n\n \n\nFiscal rule of expenditure not to  \nexceed revenue is adhered to no later \nthan FY2004. \n\n\u2022  Private sector and general public are \nsatisfied with public service delivery. \n\n \n \n\u2022  Public accounts \n \n \n\u2022  Results of opinion poll  \n\n \n \n\u2022  No natural disasters \n\noccur.  \n\n\u2022  Political will can be \n\nsustained. \n\nA.

A specialist1 in social impact \nassessments has evaluated the effects of policy changes under the EPSRP on the stakeholders \nand  vulnerable  groups,  examined  the  current  social  security  system,  and  assessed  the  social \nimplications and poverty impact of the conditionalities under the EPSRP. The methods used for \nthe social impact assessment included individual interviews and focus group discussions with a \nwide range of senior government officials and civil servants, private sector representatives, and \ncivil society groups. Social monitoring and public consultation are a key element of the reform \nprocess.  In  addition,  a  Tongan  participatory/public  relations  specialist  (footnote  1)  is  assisting \nthe  Government  in  a  broad-based  consultative  process  through  workshops  and  seminars, \ntargeting  specific  groups  (politicians,  public  sector  officials,  chamber  of  commerce,  churches, \nand  civil  society  groups)  and  hearings  that  bring  together  representatives  of  the  Government, \nthe business community, civil society groups, and the general public.  \n \nB. \n\nSocioeconomic Context \n\n2. \nPopulation.  The  1996  census  recorded  a  population  of  97,784.  The  total  fertility  rate \nwas calculated at 4.2%, which, although high, has been offset by high emigration rates since the \n1970s; thus the average annual population growth rate since 1986 is low at 0.3% per annum. \nThe  number  of  Tongans  living  overseas  was  estimated  to  be  between  35,000-45,000  in  1993 \nand may now be considerably higher.2  \n \n3. \nUrbanization.  There  has  been  a  massive  shift  from  an  agricultural  subsistence-based \neconomy to  substantial dependence on emigration, remittances, and public sector employment \ncombined  with  increased  urbanization.  Sixty-eight  percent  of  the  population  of  Tongatapu,  the \nmost  populous  island  in  the  group,  live  in  the  urban  area  of  Nuku\u2019alofa,  and  villages  on  the \nisland  are  developing  increasingly  suburban  characteristics.    The  Government  has  recognized \nurban  growth  as  an  issue  of  concern  since  1966,  putting  pressure  on  national  resources  for \nincreased expenditure on physical infrastructure. Efforts continue to distribute services equitably \nbetween  the  rural  and  urban  population.  The  provision  of  high  schools  in  the  outer  islands  \n(Ha\u2019api group, Vava\u2019u, Niuataputopu, and Niuafo\u2019ou) aims to discourage rural-urban migration.  \n \n4. \nDespite extensive socioeconomic changes over the past 30 years, Tongan customs and \ntraditions, the monarchy, the churches, and the extended family continue to be respected and \nemphasized and are all interconnected.  \n \n \n5. \nHuman  Development.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  human \ndevelopment index ranks Tonga sixth out of 14 Pacific Island states.3 On a global scale Tonga \nis  ranked  107.  Tonga\u2019s  relatively  high  ranking  arises  from  its  social  achievements  in  the \nprovision  of  universal  primary  education,  public  health  services,  water,  and  sanitation,  which \nhave produced an almost universally literate population with average life expectancy of 67 years \nbased  on  calculations  in  1996.  Although  Tonga  is  encountering  some  social  problems,  and \n                                                 \n1 A social sector/social impact assessment expert and a participatory/public relations specialist have been engaged. \n\nADB. 2001.

Suva: UNDP.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n43\n\n \n\nalthough  it  lacks  some  modern  democratic  institutions,  it  is  peaceful,  orderly,  and  generally \nequitable  in  comparison  with  some  Pacific  developing  member  countries  (PDMCs)  and  many \ncountries in the Asia and Pacific region.  \n \nGender.  The  gender  equity  and  the  status  of  women  is  higher  in  Tonga  than  in  many \n6. \nother PDMCs in terms of women\u2019s health status, participation rates in secondary education, and \nshare of senior and middle management jobs. However, women have a smaller overall share of \nemployment in the paid labor force.  There is gender disparity in tertiary qualifications. Although \nmore  girls  than  boys  complete  secondary  education,  many  more  men  than  women  have \ntechnical and higher education qualifications. \n \n7. \nThere  is  significant  legal  discrimination  against  women  with  regard  to  property  rights. \nVery  few  women  have  direct  rights  to  own  land,  due  to  a  patrilineal  system  of  land  allocation \nand inheritance adopted in the 19th century. Further, women are not permitted to legally register \nland in their own names.4 This affects women\u2019s access to credit, as significant assets tend to be \nregistered in the names of men.5 Indicative recent surveys6 suggest that more men than women \nin economically active age groups migrate. Accordingly women-headed households (19%  of all \nhouseholds in 1996) constitute a vulnerable group. There is concern that if the law gave every \nwoman equal rights of inheritance with her brothers, control of portions of land might pass from \nthe  control  of  her  own  family  and  come  under  the  control  of  her  husband\u2019s  family.  Although \nkainga  (extended  families)  count  both  males  and  females  as  members  by  birth,  and  accord \nspecial respect to sisters and members of the female descent line, the control of family property \nis patrilineal. This fact has some influence on family decisions about educational investment in \nfavor  of  males,  although  it  is  offset  by  the  fact  that  families  tend  to  invest  in  children  who \nachieve well, irrespective of their gender.  \n \n8. \nPoverty. Among ADB\u2019s 12 PDMCs, Tonga ranks first in the human poverty index. There \nare no recent household income and expenditure data on which firm conclusions about poverty \ncan  be  based.7  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  new  policy  on  poverty  reduction,  a  preliminary  poverty \nassessment  was  carried  out  under  a  regional  technical  assistance.8  The  initial  findings  were \ncompiled and circulated to the Government for comments. Additional data will be gathered for \nfurther  assessment  of  the  poverty  situation  in  Tonga  through  a  small-scale  TA,9  which  was \napproved in 2000, to assist the Government in conducting a household income and expenditure \nsurvey. The poor, in terms of national relativity, are those who suffer \u201cpoverty of opportunity\u201d in \nrelation  to  employment  and  other  chances  to  improve  their  standards  of  living,  particularly  the \nyouthful  majority.  Many  Tongans  live  in  overcrowded,  poor-quality  houses,  in  conditions \nconducive to social stress.  \n \n\n  \n\n                                                 \n4  According to the Women in Law Association (WILA) , women want changes in the law allowing all people the right \nto register land. WILA has undertaken a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization-funded \nsurvey of women\u2019s knowledge and attitudes about their legal status in rural areas and the outer islands. The results \nare currently being analyzed. \n\n5  Most lending agencies including the Tonga Development Bank (TDB) require loans to be secured against saleable \n(or leaseable) assets. TDB has a US$2 million revolving loan fund that makes small loans to persons qualifying as \npoor  or  disadvantaged.  Some  borrowers  from  this  fund  are  women  and  women\u2019s  groups  using  both  group \nguarantees and their husband\u2019s co-signature to secure credit. \n\n6   Government of Tonga. 1999.

The \n9. \nlatter is said to be more of a temporary camp for outer island parents, mainly mothers, caring for \nchildren  attending  school.  The  settlement  at  Patangata  in  a  swampy  area  beside  a  rubbish \ndump  outside  Nuku\u2019alofa  is  more  permanent,  and  most  residents  have  moved  there  from  the \nouter  islands  both  to  find  work  in  the  town  and  to  educate  their  children.  The  standard  of \nhousing  and  general  living  conditions  in  this  settlement  have  improved  dramatically  in  recent \nyears.  The  main  disadvantage  faced  by  residents  is  periodic  flooding  and  associated  health \nrisks.  \n \n10. \nA  high  proportion  of  commoners  have  no  formal  rights  to  land  because  the  numbers \neligible10  to  receive  allotments  of  land  exceed  the  provisions  for  land  distribution  under  the \nConstitution  of  1875,  and  land  availability.  However  most  people  have  access  of  one  kind  or \nanother to land if they need it for housing, to grow food, or to make a simple living. People of \nhigh traditional status have many privileges, not the least of which is access to land that returns \nrents of various kinds, but although Tonga is highly socially stratified, the gap between rich and \npoor is not as great as in many developing countries. \n \n11. \nSocial  problems  are  considered  to  have  increased  along  with  the  growth  in  the  urban \npopulation. Physical assault and theft, including breaking and entering, are among the leading \ntypes  of  crime.  Youth  crime  is  not  significant  in  Tonga,  although  there  are  growing  concerns \nabout  delinquency  in  the  urban  area;  most  criminal  acts  are  committed  by  persons  aged  30-\n35.11 Few data exist on domestic violence, which is included in police statistics with all types of \nassault,  but  it  is  a  recognized  social  problem.  A  recent  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund \n(UNICEF)  study  showed  that  57.4%  of  all  secondary  school  students  interviewed  reported \nhaving sustained one or more deliberate physical injuries in the previous 12 months, and about \none third reported the injuries inflicted by one or both parents.12 The Catholic Women\u2019s League \nhas  recently  established  a  center  for  women  and  children  to  counter  problems  of  domestic \nviolence. \n \n12. \nSocial Safety Nets. There is no formal social security system for all citizens, although \ngovernment  employees  in  established  positions  and  some  private  sector  employees  are \ncovered  by  various  retirement  benefit  arrangements.  The  Government  has  also  agreed  to  the \ncreation of a national retirement fund to provide for employees not covered by the government \nscheme.13  This  will  not  provide  a  social  safety  net  for  its  members  until  the  fund  grows  over \ntime. \n \nThe  Government  provides  for  general  public  welfare  by  allowing  extended  school \n13. \nattendance,  low  government  school  fees,  and  free  government  health  services.  Children  are \nconsidered to have an obligation to support their parents in old age, and various kinds of mutual \nassistance mechanisms exist within families, although these are often severely strained by lack \nof financial resources.  \n \n14. \nTonga  has  a  high  dependency  ratio.  About  20%  of  the  population  support  the  other \n80%.14  Demographic  trends  indicate  that  the  majority  of  migrants  are  able-bodied  adults.  The \n\n                                                 \n10 Firstborn sons inherit land allotments, and all adult males are entitled to receive allotments of land. \n11 Annual Report 2000, Ministry of Police.

A recent survey of 150 rural and peri-urban \nhouseholds  with  elderly  members  showed  that,  of  these  households,  one  third  had  total \ncombined annual incomes of under TS$6,000, one third under TS$12,000, and one third above \nTS$12,000 per annum. Of 208 elderly people surveyed, 15 considered themselves \u201cvery poor, \nlife  is  a  struggle,\u201d  106  said  that  they  were  \u201cpoor,  but  managing,\u201d  83  that  they  were  \u201caverage, \nnormal,\u201d and 1 who was \u201cquite prosperous.\u201d 15 \n \nThe survey showed that household expenditure tended to exceed income in most cases, \n15.  \nparticularly  in  urban  Nuku\u2019alofa.  This  indicates  income  from  remittances,  but  also  borrowing. \nAside from the commercial banks, informal moneylending is easily accessible at very high rates \nof  interest,  and  borrowing  tends  to  be  recurrent,  to  bridge  cashflow  problems.  Most  wage  and \nsalary earners have debts, and many middle or higher income earners have mortgages. Most \nwage  and  salary  earners  have  financial  obligations  to  their  immediate  and  extended  families, \nand to their churches. \n \nRemittances.  Migrant  relatives  assist  many  households,  but  the  relationship  between \n16. \nisland-based  and  overseas  Tongans  tends  to  be  reciprocal.  Children  usually  support  or  assist \ntheir  parents  or  other  relatives  who  raised  them,  whether  they  emigrate  or  remain  in  Tonga. \nMany working emigrant couples send children home, or leave them behind when they emigrate, \nto be taken care of by relatives. Taro and yam\u2014these root crops are a stable diet for Tongans\u2014\nand  traditional  cultural  goods  such  as  bark  cloth,  mats,  and  other  items  are  in  demand  in \noverseas  communities,  and  are  exchanged  for  consumer  goods  or  money  between  island \nresidents and Tongans overseas, through various mechanisms.  \n \n17.  Money  is  often  sent  to  relatives  in  Tonga  by  emigrants,  not  to  support  everyday \nconsumption,  but  as  contributions  to  the  ceremonial  obligations  or  special  needs  of  relatives. \nAnother \u201cremittance\u201d mechanism is short-term emigration, when people go overseas to work in \norder to earn a target sum to bring home for purposes such as building a house, or when groups \ngo overseas to raise funds for special projects from emigrant communities. \n \n18. \nThe  remittance-based  economy  depends  on  a  continued  flow  of  emigrants,  as  once \nmigrants  become  established  overseas,  they  usually  buy  or  lease  homes,  raise  families,  and \ncannot  afford  to  send  much  money  home.  Overseas-born  Tongans  are  much  less  likely  than \nfirst generation migrants to feel an obligation to send money to relatives in their ancestral land. \nThe major source of remittances is from the United States. \n \n19. \nYouth. Over half the population is under 19 years old. Youth are kept at school as long \nas  possible  due  to  employment  aspirations  and  lack  of  employment  opportunities.  The \nsecondary  school  dropout  rate  is  low  but  increases  to  around  22%  in  forms  5  and  6.  The \nemployment service unit in the Ministry of Labor, Commerce and Industries registered 254 job \nseekers in 2000. Some young people registered but refused offers of employment for positions \nsuch  as  shop  assistant  because  they  aspired  to  clerical  positions,  preferably  in  the  public \nservice. \n \n20. \nEducation. Tonga has a high level of educational achievement, with near 100% literacy. \nThere is universal primary education, and  retention of almost all students to the mid-secondary \nschool  level.  The  Government  provides  a  primary  school  for  every  inhabited  island  with  a \nprimary  school-age  population.  Most  are  operated  by  the  Government,  some  by  churches  or \n\n                                                 \n15 Central Planning Department. 2000.

All \napproximately  twothirds  in  nongovernment  schools  have  had  formal  training.    Approximately \nonethird  of  the  total  of  all  grade  6  students  repeat  in  the  hope  of  scoring  well  enough  to  be \noffered  a  place  in  one  of  the  more  prestigious  secondary  schools.  The  emphasis  is  on  an \nacademic  program  from  the  primary  to  the  upper  secondary  and  tertiary  levels.  Educational \nachievement  raises  the  social  status  of  both  the  individual  and  his/her  family.  It  provides \nopportunities  for  emigration.  There  has  been  a  shift  in  migration  opportunities  away  from \nunskilled  labor  towards  skilled  workers  with  technical  and  professional  qualifications.  Higher \neducation also enables entry to employment in the public service, which is considered the most \nprestigious employment at all levels of the service. \n \n21. \nHealth.  Tonga has a high standard of health compared with other lower-middle income \ncountries, with an infant mortality rate of just over 14 per 1,000 live births in 1999. All members \nof  the  public  have  access  to  health  services  and  essential  drugs  at  not  more  than  one  hour\u2019s \ndistance  from  home.  Investments  in  water  and  sanitation  have  reduced  the  incidence \nprevalence of infectious diseases to low levels; immunization coverage is 92.4%; and maternal \nand  child  health  coverage  is  excellent.  Tonga  has  four  hospitals\u2014one  large  and  three  small \nfacilities\u20144 health centers, and 33 maternal and child health centers. \n \n22. \nObesity,  diabetes,  and  cardiovascular  disease  are  becoming  major  national  health \nproblems. There is now a 13% diabetes prevalence rate, affecting increasing numbers of people \nin younger age groups. Car accidents are also an increasing cause of death and disability, and \ncancer  and  mental  illness  rates  appear  to  be  increasing.  Diabetes  is  associated  with  many \ndisease  complications  including  blindness  and  renal  and  cardiovascular  diseases,  which  are \nvery  costly  to  treat.  Diet  is  a  factor.  There  is  a  high  dependence  on  imported  foods  including \nstaples  such  as  flour  and  rice.  Low-grade  fatty  imported  meat  and  poultry  products  such  as \nmutton  flaps  and  turkey  tails  are  widely  consumed  because  they  are  relatively  cheap.  Health \npriority area plans focus on the prevention/reduction of these health problems.  \n \nC. \n\nAssessing the Impact of Reforms under the EPSRP \n\n23. \nThe EPSRP envisages (i) continuation of the existing freeze on new appointments to the \npublic  service,  (ii)  enforcement  of  the  retirement  age  of  60,  and  (iii)  provision  of  lump  sum \nincentive  payments  to  encourage  employees  over  50  to  take  early  retirement.  Currently,  79 \npublic  servants  in  established  posts  are  over  60  years,  and  516  are  over  50  years  of  age.16 \nPublic  service  regulations  require  retirement  at  age  60,  but  the  rule  is  not  enforced.  It  is  not \nknown how many government workers employed on a daily basis (752 in all) are in these age \ngroups.  Under  the  EPSRP,  those  positions  that  have  been  filled  for  long  periods  of  time  by \nemployees on a daily basis will be established, so that the employees holding the posts will be \nentitled to pensions and early retirement benefits if they are in the eligible age groups.  \n \n24. \nA retirement fund for public servants covers workers in the public sector. Under the old \npension scheme, employees had the option of retiring with a pension or a lump sum. The new \nscheme only provides lump sum payments. The Government has a liability of about T$30 million \nto the pension fund, which might constrain its ability to meet a sudden increase in demand for \nlump sum payments, as would occur if it rapidly downsized in the public service. Loan proceeds \nhave been specially earmarked to cover retirement benefits and compensation payments.  \n \n\n                                                 \n16 No gender disaggregation of these figures has been done yet. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n47\n\n \n\nThe  following  potential  socioeconomic  impacts  need  to  be  monitored  over  the  next  5 \n\n25. \nyears to ensure that mitigating policies can be adopted as required.  \n \n26. \nVulnerable Groups. The major socioeconomic impact over the next 2 to 3 years is likely \nbe  a  reduction  in  income  of  approximately  500  or  more  households  due  to  retirement,  early \nretirement,  or  retrenchment  with  compensation.    Households  vulnerable  to  poverty  are  those \nwith only one income earner who retires from public service employment, especially those who \nown no land or are headed by women.17  \n \n27. \nResearch  conducted  by  the  Central  Planning  Department  (CPD)  under  the  Prime \nMinister\u2019s Office (PMO) and the Department of Statistics indicates that lump sum payments do \nnot  provide  long-term  social  security  for  retirees.  A  survey  of  people,  who  had  received  cash \nlump sum payments for retirement or compensation showed that 95% of them spent the money, \ngave it away, repaid debts, or made an unsuccessful investment.  \n \n28. \nIn households where the retrenched sole income earner is on a low salary scale and/or \nwhere  the  household  has  limited  access  to  land,  the  hardship  will  be  greatest.  Lump  sum \npension payouts and severance payments will be made to public sector employees taking early \nretirement or who are made redundant, but the amount will be small for those who had held low-\nwage positions.  A modest increase in those living below or close to the poverty line is a likely \noutcome.  \n \n29. \nAssuming  that  Tonga\u2019s  strong  customs  of  family  assistance  will  cushion  the  impact  of \nreduced  public  sector  expenditure  and  provide  traditional  social  safety  net  functions,  the  high \ndependency  ratio  will  continue  to  rise.  Those  in  employment  in  Tonga  will  have  increased \nfinancial obligations, and the demand on relatives working overseas will increase. \n \n30. \nGender Impacts. No analysis of the gender composition of the public service has been \nmade yet. According to the 1996 census, there were more women (8%) than men (6.8%) in the \noccupational  category  officers,  managers,  and  professionals,  but  women  predominated  in \nclerical positions (13.6% of the female labor force were clerks, compared with 4.6% of the male \nlabor force). If lower wage positions are made redundant, then women will be disproportionately \naffected.  \n \n31. \nUnemployment.  By  encouraging  the  retirement  of  older  members  of  the  service, \nyounger  women  and  men  will  benefit  from  a  streamlined  public  service  with  increased \nopportunities  for  mobility.  However  the  public  service  will  no  longer  provide  as  many \nemployment  opportunities  as  in  the  past.  Postsecondary  training  will  have  to  be  more  closely \nmatched  to  labor  market  opportunities  and  support  growth  in  the  private  sector.  Table  A4.1 \ngives  an  overview  of  the  impact  of  reform  measures  and  proposed  mitigation  and  monitoring \nactivities. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n17  The  number  of  vulnerable  households  is  not  yet  known  and  depends  on  the  combination  of  measures  taken  to \n\nreduce the salary and wage bill. Each ministry and department will decide this separately.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nLabor Markets \n\nTABLE 4.1 Social and Gender Impacts of Successful Implementation of EPSRP \n \n\nChannel \n\nDirect \n\nIndirect \n\nMacro/Structural \n\nMitigation/ Monitoring \n\nSome reduction in demand for \nlabor in the short to medium term \nas a result of public service \nrightsizing and privatization of \nsome public enterprises under the \nfiscal reform component of the \nEconomic and Public Sector \nReform Program (EPSRP) \n \nIncreased demand for labor in the \nmedium to long term as a result of \nprivate sector reform \n \n\nIncreased vulnerability of households \nwith one income earner retiring from \npublic service, especially landless \nand female-headed  households \n \nWomen, who predominate in clerical \npositions, may be disproportionately \naffected. \n \nReduced public service employment \nopportunities for youth \n  \n \n\nReduced public sector \ncontribution to Gross \nDomestic Product (GDP) \ngrowth in the short to \nmedium term, offset by \nprivate sector growth in the \nmedium to long term \n \n \n\nPrices \n \n \n\nIncreased sales tax will raise the \ncost of living while tariff reforms will \nlower it, with the net effect to be \ndetermined \n\nPossible diversion of production time \nto increased domestic food \nproduction \n \n\nTransfers \n \n\nPressure on traditional social safety \nnets in the short term \n \n\nReduction in transfers to public \nenterprises may cause some loss \nof employment. \n \nAgainst this, the Government is \nbetter able to meet public service \npension fund obligations \n \nThe income tax threshold is raised \nto benefit low-income households \n \n\nA return to sustainable \nfiscal management and \nstrengthened monetary \npolicy will reduce \ninflationary pressure and \nraise real interest rates on \nsavings deposits.  \n \n \nImproved public financial \nmanagement lays the \nfoundation for future \nprovision of a formal social \nsafety net.  \n\nSocial/gender and economic \nimpact monitoring by Central \nPlanning Department \n \nBaseline data established \nagainst which changes would be \nmonitored \n \nCommunity-based financial \nmanagement training for retired \nand redundant public sector \nemployees \n \nSeverance compensation for \nvoluntary early retirees and \nredundancies will be paid  \n \nPrices and incomes survey data \ndisaggregated by sex of head of \nhousehold \n \n \n\nEconomic and social monitoring  \n \nBusiness and technical skills \ntraining for self-employment will \nbe available.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \nPerformance-based appointments \nand promotions will increase morale, \nmotivation and performance of public \nservants. \n\n \nAccess to Public \nGoods and \nServices \n\n \nIn the short term, fiscal tightening \nmay cause some loss of access. In \nthe medium to long term, service \ndelivery will improve due to \nperformance orientation and \nmanagement introduced under the \npublic service reform component of \nthe EPSRP, and improved \nallocative efficiency of public \nexpenditure.   \n \n \n\n \nCustomer surveys \n \nPublic service Human Resource \nManagement Information \nSystem includes gender impact \nmonitoring mechanism. \n\n \nReduction in share of \ngovernment expenditure for \nwages and salaries, and an \nincrease in operation and \nmaintenance expenditures, \nlead to improved service \ndelivery to the general \npublic and the private \nsector. \n \nPrivate sector-led economic \ngrowth generates \ngovernment revenue to \nsupport improved service \ndelivery. \n \n \n\nShort-term negative impact on lower income households.

The \npopulation  and  human  resources  development  unit  in  CPD  conducts  socioeconomic  research \nand  collects  and  disseminates  data  for  national  planning  and  policy  development  purposes, \nincluding  contributing  to  the  CPD  Economic  and  Social  Bulletin,  published  twice  yearly.  It  is \nenvisaged  that  social  and  gender  monitoring  of  the  EPSRP  will  become  an  additional \nresponsibility of CPD.   \n \nE. \n \n34. \nIn  addition  to  financial  compensation  packages  for  voluntary  early  retirees  and \nredundancies, a range of nonfinancial mitigation measures will be available. It is likely that up to \n500  people  will  opt  for  training  as  part  of  a  retirement/redundancy  package  over  3  years.  The \neconomic and social impact monitoring unit will establish the training needs of early retirees and \nretrenched public servants. It is anticipated that training requirements will focus on four areas: (i) \nsmall business management; (ii) farm management with technical agricultural content; (iii) basic \naccounting  and  bookkeeping;  and  (iv)  computer  applications,  office  management,  and  office \nautomation.  \n \n35. \nTo  be  effective,  courses  should  last  approximately  16  weeks.  It  is  estimated  that  the \nnumber  of  people  eligible  for  retraining  will  be  around  500.  The  cost  is  estimated  at  around \nUS$500 per person, assuming that courses are offered by local providers or by the University of \nthe South Pacific (USP). Following on these estimates, if 500 people were trained, the total cost \nwould be around US$250,000. A training allowance in the range of US$50 per week of training \nwill be considered.  \n \n36. \nPension payouts and compensation packages are paid in lump sums. Prudent financial \nmanagement  practices  will  be  needed  to  make  these  funds  last.  The  objective  of  person \nfinancial  management  training  is  to  avoid  poverty  and  ensure  public  welfare  through  a  more \neffective use of family income. This will be achieved through a training and awareness program \nthat will involve both rural and urban families throughout the country. Because of cultural factors \nand  customary  communal  obligations  and  pressures,  targeting  only  those  who  will  be  leaving \npublic  service  employment  will  not  be  effective.  It  will  be  necessary  to  achieve  a  broad-based \nunderstanding among the families of people leaving government employment, and the general \npublic as well, of how improved financial management at the household level can avoid poverty \nand increase social security.  \n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n51 \n\nThe  following  training  providers  and  programs  illustrate  the  range  of  existing  training \n37. \nprograms  that    can  be  utilized  in  retraining  of  retrenched  public  servants.  The  programs  are \noffered by PMO, the Ministry of Education, and USP. \n \nThe  Government  Training  and  Development  Unit  (TDU)  under  the  Department  of \n38. \nEducation was established with an initial focus on improving the skills of public servants. From \n1994  on,  this  focus  was  broadened  to  include  the  private  sector  and  NGOs  through  two \npackages of assistance from the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID)  of \nUS$250,000 per annum,  and the New Zealand Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) of \nUS$125,000 per annum. In addition, for the past three years, TDU has provided management \nand a venue for an in-service diploma in public sector management taught by Massey University \nand funded by MFAT. TDU is also planning to offer on-line distance education courses from the \nIllawarra  Institute  of  Technical  and  Further  Education  in  Australia.  TDU  also  manages  New \nZealand training attachment programs funded by MFAT. The Government states its priorities for \ntraining  each  year,  and  course  offerings  are  planned  in  advance.  Requests  are  sought  and \nreceived  from  government  departments,  the  private  sector,  and  NGOs.  There  is  an \nunderstanding  among  the  Government,  AusAID,  and  MFAT  that  training  needs  of  retired  or \nretrenched public servants will be given priority when annual course programs are compiled.  \n \n39. \nThe Distance Education and Community Center specializes in computer and information \ntechnology  training,  and  is  administered  under  the  Ministry  of  Education\u2019s  Community \nDevelopment and Training Center. It also offers diploma courses in agriculture, accounting and \ntourism.    The  ministry  subsidizes  fees.  The  center  specializes  in  short-term  software \napplications  courses.  The  courses  are  available  to  part-time  students,  and  the  duration  is \nbetween  10  and  20  hours  per  course.  Applications  taught  include  Microsoft  Word,  Excel, \nAccess, Power Point, and Desktop Publisher.  \n \n40. \nUSP has a large extension center in Tonga with well-equipped offices and classrooms.  \nApproximately  300  part-time  and  full-time  fee-paying  students  enroll  each  year  in  continuing \neducation courses; university preparatory courses (preliminary and foundation); and certificate, \ndiploma  and  degree-level  programs  in  a  wide  range  of  subjects  including  social  science, \neconomics, accounting, management, science, mathematics, and education. \n \n41. \nContinuing education covers a variety of activities, some of which change from year to \nyear  depending  on  demand  and  the  availability  of  trainers.  The  mandate  for  continuing \neducation activities to be offered by USP is broad; however, the staff and resources allocated to \nthe  USP  center  encourage  a  focus  on  higher  level  programs,  mainly  offered  in  the  distance \neducation mode, or, less frequently, taught in intensive summer schools.  Continuing education \nprograms  have  included  computing  and  other  vocational  skills.    Some  continuing  education \nprograms such as the Pacific Preschool Certificate18 are centrally organized at the USP in Suva, \nand  offered  through  the  distance  education  mode  in  Tonga  and  throughout  the  Pacific  region \nserved by USP. Contact teaching is usually organized after hours to enable people with jobs to \nattend classes. \n \nUSP is able to tailor-make  courses  to   be  offered  at  the continuing education level for \n42. \nsponsored   groups    of   students   requiring  specific  vocational    training   qualifications.  The \nadvantage  of   such  programs  through  USP  is that  motivated students  may  cross-credit the \ncourses toward further study for higher level qualification. \n\n                                                 \n18  The  Pacific  Preschool  Certificate  was  designed  to  train  teachers  employed  in  community-based  preschools.  The \n\nadmission criteria are low, mainly requiring students to be proficient in English. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR BUILDING A PERFORMANCE-BASED PUBLIC SERVICE \n\nBackground and Rationale \n\nA. \n \nA  major  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  policy  reform  program  is  the  initiative  to  build  a \n1. \nperformance-based public service. The need for public service reform has long been recognized. \nPublic  service  reform  committees  were  established  in  2000  and  have  reported  on  (i)  the  core \nfunctions of the Government as prescribed by existing laws and regulations, (ii) a plan for public \nservice reform, and (iii) means of implementation. The task for the Government is to formulate an \nimplementation  plan  of  sequenced  and  meaningful  policy  actions  that  is  commensurate  with \nadministrative capacity. Public service reform is aimed at reducing the size and costs of the public \nservice while maintaining and improving service delivery. Its successful implementation is crucial \nto  fiscal  balance,  improved  governance,  and  effective  economic  policy  reform.  The  Prime \nMinister\u2019s  Office  (PMO)  is  responsible  for  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  public  service \nreform. However, the Government needs to build its capacity to manage the public service reform, \nincluding monitoring of the impact of the reform measures.  \n \nB. \n \n\nThe Technical Assistance \n\n1. \n\nObjective and Scope  \n\n \n2. \nThe  overall  public  service  reform  seeks  to  improve  public  service  delivery  to  the  private \nsector and the general public. The technical assistance (TA) will support this overall goal. It has \nas  its  objective  to  build  a  performance-oriented  public  service  through  (i)  establishing  the \ninstitutional framework for a performance-oriented public service, and (ii) promoting efficient and \neffective  performance  management.  The  TA  will  (i)  facilitate  good  governance  practices  and \nstrengthen the planning, monitoring, and reporting capabilities of all ministries; (ii) establish the \ncentral human resource management information system (HRMIS) to provide users with timely, \naccurate  and  relevant  establishment  information;  (iii)  introduce  performance  accountability  for \nheads  of  departments;  (iv)  support  the  introduction  of  performance-oriented  and  merit-based \nremuneration  policies  and  procedures;  and  (v)  assist  in  the  preparation  of  regulations  and \nimplementation  guidelines    for  new  legislation  under  the  Economic  and  Public  Sector  Reform \nProgram  (EPSRP).  The  TA  will  cooperate  closely  with  the  assistance  provided  for  the \nestablishment  of  a  public  service  commission  by  the  New  Zealand  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs \nand Trade.   \n \n\n2. \n\nCosts and Financing  \n\n \n \n\n3. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  to  be  US$840,000  equivalent,  including  a  foreign \nexchange  cost  of  US$676,000  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  US$164,000  equivalent.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  finance  US$700,000  equivalent  to  cover  the  entire  foreign \nexchange cost and US$24,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. Financing will come from the \nADB-funded TA program. The Government will contribute US$140,000 equivalent in kind for office \nspace, counterpart staff, local transportation, and other services.   \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n4. \nPMO will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will be the owner of all equipment upon \nTA completion. The cabinet committee for reform, supported by the reform secretariat, will provide \noverall guidance for implementation, and a public service reform team will provide the necessary \noffice  support  services.  The  Government  will  provide  full-time  local  counterparts  and,  where \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n53 \n\nnecessary,  part-time  subproject  teams  to  assist  with  implementation.  The  TA  will  finance \ninternational consulting services, HRMIS software and license fees, a job evaluation methodology \nfranchise, workshops, surveys, office equipment, and materials. It is expected that the TA will be \nimplemented  over  24  months  (May  2002-April  2004)  with  intermittent  assignment  of  the \ninternational consultants. The TA will be completed in May 2004.  A total of 28 person-months of \ninternational consulting services are required consisting of (i) a team leader/public service reform \nadvisor  for  15  person-months  on  an  intermittent  basis  to  help  design  and  manage  the  reform \nprocess,  (ii)  an  HRMIS  specialist  for  2  person-months,  (iii)  a  public  sector  job  evaluation/ \nremuneration specialist for 3 person-months, (iv) a performance management/strategic planning \nspecialist  for  4  person-months,  (v)  a  legal  drafting  expert  for  2  person-months,  and  (vi)  other \nspecific experts as required for  2 person-months.
