The  Philippines  recorded  its  first  case  of \n4 Given \nCOVID-19 on 30 January 2020, and the first case of local transmission on 7 March 2020. 3F\nthe threat of COVID-19 to national security, a State of Public Health Emergency was declared on \n8 March 2020 through Proclamation No. 922, and the National Capital Region was placed under \n5  This  was  escalated  to  an  enhanced \ngeneral  community  quarantine  on  15  March  2020. 4F\ncommunity  quarantine for  the whole of  Luzon on  16  March 2020 to  mitigate the spread of  the \nvirus.  On  16  May  2020,  the  government  started  to  relax  the  quarantines  and  the  associated \n6 because of the observed stabilization of the number of \nnonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) 5F\nnew cases.6F\n\n7 However, new cases started to rapidly emerge again by July 2020.    \n\n5. \nThe rapid surge prompted a re-imposition of stricter quarantine measures and NPIs by \nAugust 2020. As a result, the weekly increases in new COVID-19 cases were reduced from a \npeak  of  23,019  during  6\u201312  August  2020  to  9,203  during  17\u201323  December  2020.  The  daily \npositivity  rate\u2014the  share  of  individuals  tested  and  confirmed  positive  in  the  total  number  of \n8  \nindividuals  tested\u2014dropped  from  12.7%  on  1  August  2020  to  6.5%  on  29  December  2020. 7F\nAlthough the NPIs are driving down the number of cases, the risk of rapid spikes in new cases, \nsimilar to those in July 2020, remains. The new coronavirus variants, which have been observed \nto be more contagious, add to this risk. The introduction of COVID-19 vaccination is highly critical \nto lowering the number of new cases and bringing an end to the pandemic. \n\n6. \nCost  to  the  economy.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  drove  the  Philippine  economy  into \nrecession for the first time since the 1998 Asian financial crisis\u2014its gross domestic product (GDP) \n9 Because of the quarantines, unemployment soared \nfor the full year of 2020 contracted by 9.5%.8F\n10 The adverse \nto a record high of 17.7% by April 2020, but came down to 8.7% by October 2020.9F\nimpact  on  employment  has  been  the  greatest  in  services,  particularly  in  contact-intensive \n\n \n\n4   World Health Organization (WHO).

COVID-19 has exacerbated inequalities between women and men in \nterms of livelihoods and economic empowerment, personal safety and security, and responsibility \nfor  household  care  roles.  More  women  (77%)  are  employed  in  crisis-affected  service  sectors \n14 \n(tourism, accommodation, food services, and other service-based livelihoods) than men (47%).1\nUnder COVID-19 situation, intimate partner violence rates are very likely to have increased, in \nline with global trends reported\u2014the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia \nand  the  Pacific  reported  30\u201350%  increase  in  women  calling  dedicated  gender-based  violence \n15  COVID-19  also  affects  mental  health:  reported  cases  of  anxiety  and \nhotlines  during  2020.1\n16 and women suffer particularly because of their heightened burden \ndepression have increased,1\nof care and risk management.   \n\n4F\n\n5F\n\n3F\n\n9. \nImpact on the health system. The pandemic has impacted the health care system by \nexposing  health  workers  to  COVID-19  and  overwhelming  the  bed  occupancy  levels  of  health \nfacilities,  especially  critical  care  beds.  As  the  identification  and  treatment  of  COVID-19  cases \nbecame a priority, the public's access to health services for non-COVID-19 conditions decreased:  \nthe  fear of  infection  led  people (including  women, pregnant  women, new mothers, and people \nwith  chronic  diseases)  to  avoid  going  to  health  care  providers.  Routine  immunizations, \ntuberculosis and HIV services, and sexual and reproductive health services, for instance, were \n17\u2014maternal  deaths  are  estimated  to  have \ndisrupted,  which  intensified  morbidity  and  mortality1\n18  COVID-19  has  severely  affected  the  elderly,  especially  those  60 \nincreased  by  26%  in  2020. 1\nyears and older accounting for 62% of all deaths (footnote 8).  \n\n6F\n\n7F\n\n10. \nAll these impacts starkly highlight the need for urgent COVID-19 vaccination.

The roadmap defines the key considerations for \n12. \nthe selection of vaccines (e.g., safety, efficacy, sensitivity, supply, and cold chain requirement), \nthe  process  and  stages  of  vaccination  from  scientific  evaluation  to  monitoring  and  safety \nsurveillance, and the desired end-state of COVID-19 vaccination. It sets out a prioritization plan \nin line with the guidance from the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) \nof the World Health Organization (WHO).  \n\n13. \nPrioritization  and  allocation  plan.  The  national  government  has  increased  its \nvaccination targets and plans to vaccinate up to 70 million Filipinos in 2021, and all Filipinos by \n2023, with most of the population covered by the end of 2022 (Table 2). It plans to secure up to \n148  million  doses  of  COVID-19  vaccines,  including  free  doses  from  the  COVID-19  Vaccines \nGlobal Access (COVAX) facility for up to 20% of the eligible population and doses from bilateral \narrangements with vaccine suppliers. The government's prioritization and allocation plan (footnote \n3) defines target groups, priorities, and eligibility for the vaccination program in line with SAGE \nand the country context. Group A, the first target group (estimated at 24.7 million or 23% of the \ntotal  population),  prioritizes  frontline  health  workers,  senior  citizens,  people  with  medical \nconditions,  indigent  populations,  and  uniformed  personnel.  Group  B  (up  to  44%  of  the  total \npopulation) covers teachers and social workers; other government workers (national and local); \nother essential workers outside health, education, and social sectors; socio-demographic groups \nat  significant  risk  other  than  senior  citizens  and  indigent  populations  (people  with  disability, \npersons deprived of liberty, people living in high-density areas); overseas Filipino workers; and \nthe remaining Filipino workforce. Group C covers all people not included in Group A or Group B. \n\n \n\n \n\n19  At least six different technology platforms are used in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, and all employ or \nproduce  coronavirus  spike  proteins  to  generate  immunity  to  future  infections.  The  most  common  platforms  are \nnucleic acid technologies used in messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines (e.g., Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines), \nnon-replicating viral vector vaccines (e.g., AstraZeneca, Gamaleya, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines), recombinant \nprotein  vaccines  (e.g.,  Novavax  vaccine),  and  inactivated  virus  vaccines  (e.g.,  Bharat,  Sinopharm,  Sinovac \nvaccines). \n\n20  Vaccine Needs Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21  ADB\u2019s Assessment of the COVID-19 Vaccine Introduction Readiness (accessible from the list of linked documents \n\nin Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nTable 2: Vaccine Allocation Plan for the Philippines, 2021\u20132023  \n\nVaccine Access \n\nTarget \n\nCurrent year \nPrevious year's  \n\nTotal population \n\n2021 \nEligible Population \n% of total \npopulation \n63% \n \n63% \n\nNumber \n(million) \n70 \n \n70 \n\n2022 \nEligible Population \n% of total \nNumber \npopulation \n(million) \n37% \n42 \n63% \n70 \n100% \n112 \n\n2023 \nEligible Population \nNumber \n(million) \n2 \n112 \n114 \n\n% of total \npopulation \n2% \n98% \n100% \n\nSource: Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Of this amount, \u20b112.5 billion (about $260 million) has \nbeen  allocated  from  its  own  resources  and  the  remaining  \u20b170.0  billion  (about  $1.45  billion)  is \nexpected to be secured through loans from multilateral lenders, bilateral partners, and/or other \n26 The government estimates that 84.5% will be spent on the procurement of \nsources (Table 3).2\nvaccines,  and  the  remainder  on  related  items  (e.g.,  logistics,  vaccine  campaign,  risk \ncommunications,  and  monitoring).  The  procurement  of  vaccines  will  be  financed  primarily  by \nmultilateral agencies  and secondarily through bilateral arrangements and government financial \ninstitutions  (i.e.,  Land  Bank  of  the  Philippines  and  Development  Bank  of  the  Philippines).  The \ngovernment  will  finance  the  procurement  of  logistics  and  other  needs  through  the  \u20b12.5  billion \n($52.0  million)  general  appropriations  to  DOH  and  the  \u20b110  billion  ($208.1  million)  continuing \nappropriation under the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act (Bayanihan 2).2\n\n27  \n\n6F\n\n5F\n\nFinancing Need \n\nAmount  \n($ million) \n\nTable 3: COVID-19 Vaccine Program Financing  \nSource of Financing  \n\n \n\nVaccines \nLogistics and other supplies \n\n1,456.51  Unprogrammed funds: multilateral / bilateral loans and domestic loans \n\n260.09  20% or $52.0 million from DOH GAA 2021 \n\n80% or $208.1 million from Bayanihan 2 continuing appropriations \n\n \n\n22  The  Technical  Group  on  Scientific  Evaluation  and  Selection,  which  evaluates  COVID-19  vaccine  candidates, \nincludes  the  following  members:  DOH,  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA),  Research  Institute  for  Tropical \nMedicine, Department of Trade and Industry, Department of Foreign Affairs, National Development Company, and \nthe Vaccine Expert Panel.

The  government  will access  vaccines through the  COVAX facility and \npotential  bilateral  arrangements  with  vaccine  suppliers  such  as  Pfizer-BioNTech,  AstraZeneca, \nModerna, Gamaleya, Johnson & Johnson, the Serum Institute of India for the Novavax-developed \nvaccine,  and  Sinovac.  Pfizer-BioNTech,  AstraZeneca,  and  Moderna  vaccines  have  already \nreceived  EUAs  from  a  stringent  regulatory  authority  (SRA).  As  of  17  February  2021,  Pfizer-\nBioNTech vaccines and AstraZeneca vaccines manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and \nSK  Bioscience  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  were  also  included  in  the  emergency  use  listing  of  the \nWHO.2\n \n17. \nTripartite arrangements. To expand the supply of vaccines, the government developed \ntripartite arrangements between the national government, the vaccine supplier, and the private \nsector or local government units (LGUs). Under this arrangement, the private sector or LGUs will \npurchase and then consign vaccines to the national government. Distribution will be based on the \ngovernment\u2019s prioritization plan and in coordination with the private sector purchasers or LGUs. \nThe implementation guidelines are still being finalized, with around half of the privately purchased \nvaccines  expected  to  be  provided  to  DOH,  and  all  the  LGU-purchased  vaccines  to  those \ndesignated by the LGUs. In both cases, the vaccines will be administered in accordance with the \ngovernment\u2019s prioritization plan.    \n\n28 \n\n7F\n\nDeployment and vaccination plan. The government\u2019s NDVP details actions to address \n18. \ngaps  and  to  supplement  the  government\u2019s  cold  chain  storage  and  logistics  capacity.  The  DOH \nexpects to complete engagement of a third-party private logistics firm by the end of February 2021. \nTo  strengthen  the  tracking  of  vaccines  and  those  who  have  been  vaccinated,  the  Department  of \nInformation  Communications  and  Technology  is  urgently  engaging  a  firm  to  design,  develop,  and \nmanage an electronic VIMS that will interconnect DOH, LGUs, and private sector information systems. \nThe  VIMS  is  expected  to  be  operational  by  March  2021.  Acknowledging  potential  delays  in  the \ncontracting of these two firms, the government\u2019s contingency plan is to use DOH\u2019s existing central \nand regional vaccine warehouses. It will contract a private forwarding firm to help distribute all types \nof  DOH  goods  (such  as  medicines  and  family  planning  commodities)  to  LGUs,  and  the  DOH-\ndeveloped COVID-19 electronic immunization registry to support the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines \nuntil  the  privately  provided  solutions  are  operational.  These  contingencies  are  expected  to  be \nadequate  to  help  manage  the  initial  limited  vaccine  deliveries  until  June  2021.  Vaccine \ncommunications are being scaled up with private sector support through near-daily townhalls with \ndoctors, other health workers, and other sectors involved. Safety surveillance is being enhanced with \nthe  development  of  guidelines  and  training  modules  for  reporting  adverse  events  following \nimmunization, and the setting up of VIMS for COVID-19 vaccines.  \n\n19. \nThe NDVP also defines the institutional arrangements, roles, and responsibilities at DOH, \nother agencies of the central government, and LGUs. LGUs will continue to administer most of \nthe vaccines, as they have usually done with all government-provided vaccines. They are now \npreparing master lists; profiling, screening, and registering their residents; and determining their \npriority populations. LGUs are scaling up their vaccine workforce, mapping vaccination sites, and \npreparing local plans. In parallel, hospitals are preparing plans to vaccinate their staff. DOH  is \n\n \n\nglobal access.  \n\n28  WHO.

Waste  management.  A Health  Care  Waste  Management  Framework  and  an  updated \nmanual are in place, and on-site management of immunization waste will be implemented. The \nDOH,  with  support  from  the  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources  (DENR),  is \nexpected to contract a third-party reverse logistics firm for the transport, storage, and disposal of \nused vaccine vials, syringes, and related waste.  \n\n9F\n\nEffective  development  coordination  and  ADB\u2019s  role.2\n\n30  Development  partner \n21. \ncoordination  on  COVID-19  vaccination  is  carried  out  at  two  levels.  First,  the  Department  of \nFinance chairs the development partners\u2019 COVID-19 working group on vaccine financing, which \ncomprises  DOH,  WHO,  the  United  Nations  Children's  Fund  (UNICEF),  ADB,  AIIB,  the  World \nBank, and Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The working group \nmeets  regularly  to  discuss  policy  and  technical  issues  related  to  vaccine  financing  and \nprocurement. Second,  DOH  has  set  up  a  development  partners\u2019  technical  working  group  on \nCOVID-19 vaccination. The DOH\u2019s Bureau of International Health Cooperation coordinates with \nseveral  development  partners,  including  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  and  United \nStates Agency for International Development, and integrates partner contributions into a common \nresults  framework  and  operational  plan.  This  involves  regular  meetings  among  development \npartners  to  coordinate work  on  various  aspects  of  accessing  and  delivering  safe  and  effective \nCOVID-19 vaccines.  \n\nGovernment request. The government, through the Department of Finance, requested \n22. \nADB to support its COVID-19 vaccination program. It sought financing for advance payment and \nadvance market commitments for COVID-19 vaccines totaling $25 million from the ongoing HEAL \n31 and a new loan of $400 million to procure safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for its \nproject,3\ntarget groups (para. 13). Similarly, the government requested from AIIB a loan in the amount of \n$300 million for joint cofinancing of the proposed HEAL 2. In addition, the government has also \nrequested a loan in the amount of $500 million from the World Bank for vaccine procurement.3\n\n32 \n\n0F\n\n1F\n\nB. \n\nProject Description \n\nImpact  and  outcome.

The  project  will \n24. \nsupport the procurement of safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 through APVAX\u2019s RRC \nin compliance with ADB\u2019s vaccine eligibility criteria and with AIIB cofinancing. It will procure a total \n37 which will be administered to up to 50 million Filipinos by \nof up to 110 million doses of vaccines,3\n2024 based on identified priority populations. The eligible vaccines will be procured through either \nthe  COVAX  facility  or  bilateral  arrangements  with  vaccine  manufacturers  or  distributors.  The \nvaccines  are expected to  be  introduced  swiftly to  priority populations  following  the NDVP, and \naccording to vaccination protocols and standards, such as those governing waste management \n38 the project \nand monitoring of adverse events. With the help of  ongoing technical assistance,3\nteam  will  support  the  VIMS  and  DOH's  communication  management  and  help  develop  and \ndisseminate a gender- and socially- inclusive protocol to  support last-mile  vaccine  outreach to \nmarginalized women and women in especially difficult circumstances (WEDC).  \n\n7F\n\n6F\n\nC. \n\nValue Added by ADB  \n\n25. \n ADB\u2019s support to the Philippines\u2019 health sector since 1994  underscored the need to (i) \nsupport  the  country\u2019s  decentralized  health  system  and  its  institutional  arrangements  for  local \nhealth service delivery; and (ii) include public financial management support to strengthen project \nimplementation, performance, and governance. ADB, under its COVID-19 Active Response and \nExpenditure Support (CARES) program, approved on 23 April 2020 a $1.5 billion countercyclical \nsupport  for  the  Philippines  to  help  the  government  mitigate  the  severe  health,  social,  and \neconomic impacts of COVID-19. ADB supported the health sector in managing COVID-19 through \na $125 million loan under HEAL, a $3.0 million grant for the COVID-19 Emergency Response, \nand $5.0 million in technical assistance for the provision of emergency supplies.3\n\n39 \n\n8F\n\n26. \nHEAL 2 builds on and complements HEAL, which provides $25 million initial support to \nthe  government\u2019s  COVID-19  vaccination  program  and  strengthens  DOH  capacity  to  detect, \ncontain,  and  treat  COVID-19  cases  (footnote  1).  It  complements  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  and  planned \nsupport for universal health care, including a project planned for approval in 2021. ADB will assist \nthe government and DOH with procurement and delivery of certified vaccines in line with APVAX \neligibility  criteria.  It  will  support  ensuring  vaccine  introduction  readiness  together  with  UNICEF \nand WHO.  \n\n27. \nIn addition, technical assistance (footnote 38) will help the government to (i) determine \nsuitable  quantity,  timing,  and  procurement  arrangements  for  eligible  vaccines;  (ii)  monitor  the \nimplementation of its prioritization plan; (iii) strengthen the implementation of its medical waste \nmanagement program; (iv) support gender mainstreaming through activities in the gender action \nplan;  and  (v)  continuously  monitor  and  evaluate  the  implementation  of  COVID-19  vaccination, \nincluding  using  the  VIMS,  to  track  adverse  events  after  vaccination,  disseminate  the  data  and \nexperience  within  the  country  as  well  as  the  region.  It  will  help  the  future  expansion  of  other \nneeded vaccinations such as influenza vaccinations for the elderly and people with disabilities. \n\n \n\n37  This  is expected  to  include 44  million doses  from  the  COVID-19  Vaccines  Global  Access  (COVAX)  whose  cost-\nshare  will  be  financed  by  the  project,  and  6  million  single  doses  of  Johnson &  Johnson  vaccine.

The loan from ADB will \nhave a 10-year term including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan  agreement.  The  government  has  made  its  independent  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility and has given an undertaking that this was not made on the basis \nof any advice from ADB.  \n\nThe AIIB loan will be partially administered by ADB. It will jointly finance supply contracts \n30. \n41 Its terms and conditions will be \nfor vaccines that meet the eligibility criteria under the APVAX.4\n42 Approval of the AIIB loan is \ndescribed in a loan agreement between AIIB and the government. 4\nexpected after ADB\u2019s Board approval of HEAL 2.

It will set up a project management team (PMT) \nwith a project director and a project manager. A technical support unit of individual consultants \n(health experts, a gender specialist, a financial management specialist, a procurement specialist, \nand administration staff) will be engaged to assist the PMT.  \n\n34. \nProcurement  will  be  undertaken  in  a  manner  consistent  with  simplified  and  expedient \nprocedures permitted under the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) \nand Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). Since \nHEAL  2  will  be  financed  under  the  APVAX,  ADB  member  country  eligibility  restrictions  will  be \nwaived, and universal procurement will apply. Majority of procurement will be jointly cofinanced \nwith AIIB; ADB will be the lead cofinancier and its procurement policy will apply to all procurement. \nSome procurement may be financed exclusively by ADB.   \n\n35. \nA proportion of the vaccines will be procured through the COVAX facility. COVAX facility-\nprovided vaccines are eligible expenditures under APVAX. The DOH will also directly negotiate \nwith vaccine manufacturers to agree on bilateral contracts. Prior to being confirmed as an eligible \nexpenditure under the loan, ADB will review the vaccine eligibility criteria and all bilateral vaccine \nagreements to ensure that the terms are acceptable to ADB. Value for money in procurement will \nbe achieved through  (i) selecting candidate vaccine types that are best suited to the domestic \nlogistics  supply  chain  and  distribution  mechanisms;  (ii)  identifying  vaccines  that  will  meet  the \nproject  disbursement  conditions;  (iii)  engaging  with  manufacturers  who  have  advantageous \nvaccine  availability  and  delivery  timelines,  and  (iv)  entering  into  agreements  on  terms  and \nconditions that are reasonable, noting the currently constrained global market for vaccines. Taking \ninto account the global supply situation of vaccines, the Philippines\u2019 legal restriction on financing \nadvance payments, and the urgency for the government to secure vaccines, ADB will finance the \ngovernment\u2019s first 10% advance payment to the Serum Institute of India (SII) for the purchase of \nCovovax, the Novavax vaccine manufactured by SII, under the supply agreement between the \ngovernment and SII, notwithstanding that Covovax does not currently satisfy APVAX\u2019s vaccine \neligibility criteria. If Covovax fails to satisfy APVAX\u2019s vaccine eligibility criteria by 31 December \n2021, or such other date agreed with ADB, the government will repay the 10% advance payment \nin accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Notwithstanding the above, in the event that \nCovovax fails to satisfy the eligibility criteria, and the government secures a refund of all or any \n\n43  Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\npart of the 10% advance payment, the government will refund ADB such amount within 30 days \nof the government\u2019s receipt of the refund, without giving effect to the term of repayment set forth \nin the loan agreement. This proposal is justified on the basis of an ongoing discussion by COVAX \nto  sign  an  advance  purchase  agreement  (APA)  with  SII  for  Covovax  and  SII\u2019s  anticipated \napplication for emergency use listing (EUL) to WHO for Covovax.  It is further justified as SII is \nthe world\u2019s largest vaccine manufacturer in terms of the number of doses produced for 28 WHO \nprequalified vaccines; its manufacturing facilities are certified as operating under current the Good \nManufacturing  Practices  (GMP)  by  WHO;  and  the  AstraZeneca  vaccine  manufactured  by  SII \n(Covishield) has been authorized by Health Canada, the SRA of Canada. ADB\u2019s financing of the \nsecond  advance  payment  under  the  supply  agreement  will  be  subject  to  Covovax  satisfying \nAPVAX\u2019s  vaccine  eligibility  criteria.  ADB\u2019s  financing  of  the  third  payment  will  be  subject  to \nCovovax  continuing  to  satisfy  APVAX\u2019s  vaccine  eligibility  criteria,  and  Covovax  additionally \nreceiving the Philippines FDA authorization, consistent with the loan disbursement conditions for \nother vaccines (para. 51).    \n\nImplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 6 and described in detail in the \n\n36. \nproject administration manual. 4\n \n\n44 \n\n3F\n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated loan closing date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \nRetroactive financing and advance \nfinancing  \n\nTable 6: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \n\nMarch 2021\u2013March 2025 \n31 March 2024 \n30 September 2024 \n\n$700 million \n\nmultiple contracts \n\nDepartment of Finance \nDOH \nDOH Central Office  \nProject management team  \nDirect contracting  \nWithdrawals from the loan account may made for (i) advance financing for up \nto 6 months of estimated eligible expenditures or 50% of the total loan amount \nwhichever  is  lower,  and  (ii)  eligible  expenditures  in  relation  to  vaccine \nprocurement incurred before loan effectiveness but not more than 12 months \nbefore signing of the loan agreement, equivalent to a maximum of 30% of the \nloan amount.

The  government  has  allocated  a  total  of  \u20b182.5  billion  to  implement  the  national \nvaccination  program  (para.15).  However,  given  that  vaccine  supply  contracts  are  still  being \nnegotiated, it is difficult to determine whether the appropriation would be adequate to achieve the \nvaccination  targets.  Moreover,  the  full  funding  requirements  for  logistics,  cold  chain  facilities, \ntransport services, and the VIMS are still being finalized. To supplement potential funding gap, \nthe government is mobilizing financing from the private sector and LGUs.  \n \nC. \n \n39. \nfinancial \nmanagement capacity of the DOH to implement the project.

Based on the assessment, the pre-mitigation risk is rated high \nbecause  of  the  scale  and  complexity  of  the  project.  The  DOH  has  agreed  on  a  financial \nmanagement action plan to address deficiencies in the deployment plan and mitigate the risks by \n(i) completing  an  assessment  of  LGUs\u2019  capacity  to  oversee  vaccine  deployment  prior  to \ndistribution;  (ii)  setting  up  an  asset  register  of  cold  chain  facilities;  (iii)  engaging  a  third  party-\nlogistics  provider;  (iv)  formulating  a  contingency  plan  for  funding;  (v) updating  inventory \nmanagement protocols; and (vi) having Commission on Audit conduct performance, financial, and \ncompliance audits with assistance from ADB.4\n \n40. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  DOH.

While  most  of  the  priority population  groups  for  vaccination  are  dominated  by \n42. \n49 many marginalized women, WEDC (footnote 18), and women in geographically isolated \nwomen,4\nand  disadvantaged  areas  face  significant  barriers  to  accessing  COVID-19  health  support, \nincluding vaccines. The barriers for marginalized women and WEDC include (i) limited time to \nspend commuting to and waiting in long lines at public health facilities that are stretched beyond \ncapacity;  (ii)  mobility  constraints  such  as  cultural  norms  governing  freedom  of  movement;  (iii) \nlimited access to public transportation to reach health facilities; and (iv) the costs associated with \nthe  commute,  and  time  away  from  productive  and  household  responsibilities.  The  DOH  has \nexpressed concerns that its definition of \"social demographic groups at higher risk\" may not be \nsufficiently  comprehensive  to  ensure  the  last-mile  outreach  between  LGU  primary  health  care \nfacilities and vaccine delivery to marginalized women and WEDC. The DOH also acknowledges \nthe essential role of information, education, and communication campaigns; risk communication; \nand community engagement to ensure effective vaccine access and uptake. \n \n43. \nHEAL  2  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Through  ongoing  technical \nassistance  (footnote  38),  the  project  will  make  sure  to  minimize  the  last-mile  service  delivery \nconstraints for marginalized women and WEDC, to maximize vaccine uptake and immunization. \nHEAL  2  will  help  DOH  develop,  approve,  and  disseminate  a  gender-  and  socially-inclusive \nprotocol to reduce the barriers that now hamper both the willingness and ability of marginalized \nwomen  and  WEDC  to  access  COVID-19  health  services  and  vaccines,  and  to  improve  the \ncapacity of LGUs\u2019 primary health care facilities to meet the specific needs of these women for \neffective  vaccine  delivery.  The  protocol  will  be  developed  in  collaboration  with  multiple  DOH \nbureaus and other government departments and be resourced via LGU gender and development \nprogram budgets. In addition, HEAL 2 will support DOH in (i) the analysis of sex-disaggregated \ndata through the VIMS; (ii) specific communication and messaging to marginalized women and \nWEDC  in  major  cities  or  geographically  isolated  and  disadvantaged  areas;  and  (iii)  online \nconsultations and outreach, especially to marginalized and WEDC, to monitor their awareness of \nvaccine safety and gather feedback on  issues that curtail access to  health  services.

Manila. \nd  The government has set target groups and prioritized eligible populations for the vaccination program in line with the \nWHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) and its values framework for the allocation and \nprioritization of COVID-19 vaccination, and the Philippines\u2019 country context. Group A (estimated at 24.7 million or \n23%  of  the  total  population),  the  first  target  group,  prioritizes  frontline  health  workers,  indigent  senior  citizens, \nremaining senior citizens and indigent populations, and uniformed personnel. Group B, the second target group (up \nto 44% of the total population), covers teachers and social workers; other government workers (national and local); \nother essential workers outside health, education, and social sectors; socio-demographic groups at significant risk \nother than senior citizens and indigent populations (persons with disability, persons deprived of liberty, persons living \nin high-density areas); overseas Filipino workers; and the remaining Filipino workforce (as may be determined by \ngovernment agencies). Group C are the remaining Filipinos not included in Group A or Group B. \n\ne  Up to 110 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines are to be procured under the project. The coverage of up to 50 million \n\nFilipinos assumes a waste rate of 10%. \n\nf  This is expected to include 44 million doses from the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) whose cost-share \nwill be financed by the project, and 6 million single doses of Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The estimated coverage of \nup to 50 million Filipinos assumes a wastage rate of 10%. \n\ng  Output  indicators  1b  and 1c  will  be  financed  by  the  following  TAs:  ADB. 2020.

Manila. \n\nh  In alignment with the WHO SAGE equity principle, these protocols and guidelines acknowledge that specific groups \nof the population are less able to access information and services than others. To ensure broad-based coverage of \ninformation and equity in vaccine access, the gender- and socially-inclusive protocols and guidelines will specifically \ntarget marginalized women, women in especially difficult circumstances, and people in geographically isolated and \ndisadvantaged areas as defined by the Magna Carta of Women, Sections 4 (d) and 30. The selected LGUs in big \ncities or geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas will be determined during the inception mission. \n\nContribution to the ADB Results Framework:   \nExpected values and methodological details for all OP indicators to which this project will contribute results are detailed \nin Contribution to Strategy 2030 Operational Priorities (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n19 \n\nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=54171-003-3 \n\n \nLoan Agreement \nVaccine Needs Assessment    \nProject Administration Manual  \nContribution to Strategy 2030 Operational Priorities    \nDevelopment Partner Coordination Matrix \nCountry Economic Indicators    \nDebt Sustainability Analysis   \nCountry National Vaccination Prioritization and Allocation Plan  \nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \nGender Action Plan \nRisk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \nIndicative  Master  List  of  Eligible  Items,  and  Agreed  List  of  Acceptable \nExpenditure Items (\u2018Positive List\u2019), for ADB-financing under the Rapid Response \nComponent \n\n \nSupplementary Documents \n13. \n14. \n15. \n16. \n17. \n18. \n\nEligibility Criteria for Use of Funds under the Rapid Response Component  \nDue Diligence on the Philippine COVID-19 Immunization Waste Management Plan \nStreamlined Strategic Procurement Planning \nFinancial Management Assessment \nSector Assessment (Summary): Vaccines \nADB\u2019s Assessments of the COVID-19 Vaccine Introduction Readiness \n \n\n \n\n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n7. \n8. \n9. \n10. \n11. \n12. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["  \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "ADB \nAIIB \nAPVAX  \nCOVAX \nCOVID-19  \nDENR \nDOH \nEUA \nFDA \nGDP \nHEAL \nLGU \nNDVP \n", "NPI \nRRC \nSAGE \nSRA \nUNICEF \nVIMS \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n  WEDC \n  WHO \n \n", "ECQ \n", "GCQ \n", "MECQ \n", " \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 14 February 2021) \n  \n\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Currency unit \n\u20b11.00 \n$1.00 \n", "peso (\u20b1)  \n$0.02081 \n\u20b148.0500   \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "  \n  \n", "  \n   \n", "coronavirus disease \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank \n\u2013  Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility \n\u2013  COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Department of Environment and Natural Resources \n\u2013  Department of Health  \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Health System Enhancement to Address and Limit COVID-19 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  National Deployment and Vaccination Plan for COVID-19 \n", "emergency use authorization \n", "gross domestic product \n", "local government unit \n", "Vaccines  \nnonpharmaceutical intervention \nrapid response component \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization  \nstringent regulatory authority \n\u2013 \n\u2013  United Nations Children's Fund \n\u2013 \n\u2013  women in especially difficult circumstances \n\u2013  World Health Organization \n", "vaccine information management system \n", " \n", "GLOSSARY \n \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "refers to the implementation of temporary measures imposing \nstringent limitations on movement and transportation of people, \nstrict  regulation  of  operating  industries,  provision  of  food  and \nessential  services,  and  heightened  presence  of  uniformed \npersonnel.  \nrefers  to  the  implementation  of  temporary  measures  limiting \nmovement  and \nregulation  of  operating \nindustries,  and  presence  of  uniformed  personnel  to  enforce \ncommunity quarantine protocols.  \nrefers to the transition phase between ECQ and GCQ, where \nrestricted  mobility  is  imposed  in  select  areas  and  locations \ndetermined to be at a high risk for surge of COVID-19 cases.  \n", "transportation, \n", " \n \n \n", " \n", " \n NOTES \n", " \n", " \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year of the Government of the Philippines ends on 31 December.   \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to United States dollars.   \n \n", " \n", " \n"]}
