The program will achieve this \nthrough  introducing  program  budgeting,  improved  regulation,  increased  budget  and  other \nallocations  for  maintenance,  improved  contracting  and  maintenance  practices  and  institutions \nfor  infrastructure  service  delivery,  and  increased  power  sector  revenue  generation.  Greater \nfinancial  sustainability  of  power  and  water  utilities  will  reduce  fiscal  stress  and  contingent \nliabilities. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nArmenia faces economic challenges and a tight fiscal situation. Although Armenia\u2019s \n3. \nreal gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual average of 4.7% from 2010 to 2014, the \neconomy  remains  vulnerable  to  external  shocks  because  of  its  narrow  export  base  and \ndependence on remittance inflows. With the onset of the recession in the Russian Federation, \nand lowering export demand from its main trading partners, GDP growth moderated from 3.5% \nin 2014 to 3.0% in 2015 and is expected to drop to 2.2% in 2016. Plummeting remittance inflows \nprompted a 30% depreciation of the dram in November 2014. Declining fiscal revenues related \nto lower import tax revenues and rising public expenditures resulted in a surging budget deficit \nthat reached 4.8% of GDP in 2015 from 2.1% in 2014. The deficit is forecast to reach 4.1% in \n2016, possibly higher if economic conditions worsen. In concert with the International Monetary \nFund (IMF), the government plans to reduce the budget deficit to 2.8% of GDP in 2017 through \naggressive  prioritization  of  public  expenditures  and  increasing  revenues  through  a  new  tax \ncode.3 The public debt\u2014GDP ratio is expected to increase from 43.5% in 2014 to 54.0% in 2017 \nand, in line with IMF projections, is expected to moderate to 52.2% by 2021 (footnote 3). Public \ndebt  service  is  expected  to  increase  from  3.6%  of  GDP  in  2015  to  4.2%  in  2017.  The \ngovernment\u2019s  fiscal  consolidation  limits  budget  allocations  for  infrastructure  investment, \noperation, and maintenance in the foreseeable future, emphasizing the need for improved cost \nrecovery, generation of alternative revenues, and better management of fiscal resources. \n \n4. \nInfrastructure  sustainability  is  important  for  inclusive  growth.  Although  Armenia\u2019s \npoverty  head  count  improved  from  35%  in  2011  to  30%  in  2014,  the  incidence  of  income \npoverty remains high and is likely to increase in the context of the ongoing decline in growth.4 \nProviding adequate infrastructure services is critical to supporting economic activity and income \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided preparatory technical assistance for the Infrastructure Sustainability \n\nSupport Program, Phase 2 (TA 9065-ARM). \n\n3  IMF. 2016.

Yerevan. \n\n\fgeneration, especially outside the capital city. Rural Armenia is home to 37% of the population, \nand 36% of the labor force is active in agriculture. However, agriculture contributes only 19% to \nGDP  (2015),  as  many  farms  engage  in  subsistence  activities  and  many  self-employed  people \nare trapped in low-productivity jobs. The poverty head count in secondary towns and rural areas \nof 32% (2015) points to underserved regions, which suffer from poor transport connectivity and \nlow  quality  of  infrastructure  and  utility  services.  As  of  2014,  a  significant  part  of  the  rural \npopulation  had  to  travel  more  than  10  kilometers  (km)  to  reach  agricultural  markets  (57%), \nbanks  (47%),  and  hospitals  (44%)  (footnote  4).  As  rural  households  primarily  access  such \nservices  by  vehicle,  the  poor  condition  of  roads  is  an  important  factor  impeding  economic \nactivity  in  Armenia\u2019s  regions.  While  96%  of  the  urban  population  is  serviced  by  private  water \nconcession  contracts  and  benefit  from  adequate  sanitation,  only  78%  of  the  rural  population \ndoes.5 Armenia  has  100%  access  to  electricity,  but  this  is  being  threatened  by  the  lack  of \nnecessary  capital  to  fund  the  rehabilitation  of  aging  power  infrastructure.  Aging  public \ninfrastructure,  limited fiscal  resources  and  the  lack  of  adequate  prioritization  and management \nof scarce public resources, limit opportunities for inclusive growth, especially in the regions. \n \nRoad  network  sustainability  issues.  Armenia\u2019s  road  network  is  7,531  km  long,  of \n5. \nwhich  1,759  km  (23.4%)  are  interstate  roads  connecting  Armenia  to  its  neighbors,  1,966  km \n(26.1%)  are  republican  roads  that  connect  major  cities  and  towns,  and  3,806  km  (50.5%)  are \nrural  roads.6 The  interstate  roads  have  deteriorated  substantially  with  30%  classified  in  poor \ncondition in 2014, up from 6% in 2010, while the republican roads improved, with 22% of roads \nclassified as poor in 2014 down from 49% in 2010 (footnote 6). It is estimated that 60% of local \nroads  require  rehabilitation  and  that  only  66%  of  communities  have  a  satisfactory  connection \nwith republican or interstate roads (footnote 6).  \n \n6. \nRoad  maintenance  budget  allocations  are  insufficient  to  adequately  maintain  the  road \nnetwork and limit further deterioration. However, opportunities exist to improve maintenance by \nstreamlining functions of government agencies and coordinating maintenance and rehabilitation, \nimproving  information  on  the  maintenance  status,  and  prioritizing  maintenance  needs.  The \nArmenian  Roads  Directorate  (ARD),  which  is  currently  an  agency  under  the  Ministry  of \nTransport,  Communication  and \nInformation  Technology  (MOTCIT),  requires  significant \nstrengthening,  gearing  it  toward  a  gradual  evolution  into  an  independent  body  that  is  able  to \nattract  and  retain  qualified  staff  to  fulfill  its  mandate.  Currently,  the  ARD\u2019s  mandate  is \nundermined by its subordination under MOTCIT, focusing on managing maintenance contracts \nand lacking prioritization of maintenance expenditures. The existing public contract laws under \nwhich the ARD outsources road maintenance work to private companies need to be amended to \npermit performance-based contracts and more flexibility.  \n\n7. \nWater supply sustainability issues. Since 2002, the government has carried out major \nreforms  in  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector.  The  State  Committee  for  Water  Economy \nto  private \n(SCWE)  was  established  and  urban  water  supply  has  been  contracted \nconcessionaires, which has expanded to 92% of the service coverage in urban areas covered \nby  the  concessionaires.  However,  tariff  revenues  are  insufficient  to  cover  operation  and \nmaintenance costs and the government provides an annual $12.6 million equivalent to meet the \nrevenue  shortfall. This  does  not  include  debt service  and full maintenance  expenditures  which \n\n                                                 \n5  World Bank. 2016. World Development Indicators 2016.

Yerevan. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\flead  to  significant  fiscal  contingent  liabilities. 7  The  revenue  of  water  utilities  would  be \nsignificantly improved if nonrevenue water (NRW) caused by leakage and improper metering of \nurban condominiums was eliminated. It is estimated that 183 million cubic meters or $67 million \ncould  be  recovered  annually  from  users,  which  would  provide  significant  fiscal  savings  while \nimproving  utility  services  through  revenues  generated  by  the  concessionaire.  In  addition,  560 \nrural  communities  representing  8%  of  the  population  are  serviced  through  inadequate  local \nwater supply systems that require significant investment to reduce water rationing. \n \nThe  Armenia  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Strategy  (2015)  emphasized  that  revenues \n8. \nfor water supply and sanitation services would need to rise by 140% by 2030 to recover the full \ncost of supply and debt service.8 As for sanitation, only 4 of the 20 wastewater treatment plants \nare  operating,  indicating  the  urgent  need  for  replacement  investment.  The  situation  is \nparticularly severe in rural areas where waste is untreated and stored in cesspits. The strategy \nestimates the cost for water and sanitation investments for communities connected to the piped \nnetwork at $1.32 billion and for unconnected communities, $1.23 billion.  \n \nPower  sector  sustainability  issues.  Since  the  mid-1990s  the  government  has \n9. \nimplemented  a  number  of  significant  reforms  in  the  power  sector,  including  (i)  unbundling  the \nvertically integrated power sector into generation, transmission, and distribution companies; (ii) \nprivatizing  power  and  gas  distribution,  and  most  power  generating  companies;9 (iii)  promoting \nrenewable  energy;  and  (iv)  maintaining  a  cost  recovery  tariff.  However,  Armenia\u2019s  installed \ncapacity  is  4,336  megawatts  (2015)  of  which  only  2,589  megawatts  or  59%  is  currently \navailable,  and  power  transmission  and  distribution  reliability  and  efficiency  is  undermined  by \nassets  that  are  more  than  30  years  old.  Armenia\u2019s  single-buyer  structure  does  not  support \nnational or regional trade of seasonal surplus capacity, which has led to suboptimal energy use \nand  pricing.  Establishing  wholesale  and  export  trading,  and  thus  market-based  pricing,  would \nattract private sector investment and improve power sector sustainability. \n \nUtility  regulation  issues.  Established  in  1997,  the  Public  Services  Regulatory \n10. \nCommission \nregulator  covering  energy,  water,  electronic \ncommunications,  as  well  as  postal  services  and  railways.  Although  it  has  a  well-established \ndecision-making  process,  the  PSRC  has  been  criticized  for  not  explaining  sufficiently  the \nrationale for its key tariff decisions. For example, protests over the PSRC\u2019s power price decision \nin 2015 raised concern about the PSRC\u2019s ineffective public communication. This triggered calls \nfor a more transparent and accountable PSRC. \n \nThe  government\u2019s  strategy.  In  its  Armenia  Development  Strategy,  2014\u20132025,  the \n11. \ngovernment recognizes the need to improve its management of public infrastructure to improve \nconnectivity  and  utility  services,  as  well  as  the  need  for  broad  public  financial  management \n(PFM) reforms. It initiated key reforms as described in paras. 12\u201315.10  \n \n12. \nTransition  from  line  item  budgeting  to  program  budgeting.  The  government \nrecognized that the current line item budgeting is not providing desired performance incentives \nto  manage  expenditures.  By  2018,  all  government  agencies  are  required  to  present  programs \n\nis  a  multi-utility \n\n(PSRC) \n\n                                                 \n7  Dorsch International Consultants. 2014.

Yerevan. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fthat  include  key  performance  indicators  as  expenditure  triggers.  While  this  approach  provides \nmore flexibility by the spending units, the units must justify prioritization of budget allocations to \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  which  retains  its  role  in  allocating  overall  resources  and \nmonitoring efficient use of such resources.11 \n \n13. \nImproving road  sector maintenance. To enhance road maintenance, the government \nwill  introduce  performance-based  contracts  for  the  ARD  contractors.  In  addition,  the  ARD  will \nconcurrently  improve  its  analytical  capability  to  prioritize  maintenance  expenditures.  As  the \ncurrent  government  budget  for  road  maintenance  of  approximately  $23.3  million  annually  is \ninsufficient  to  reverse  the  deterioration  of  road  infrastructure,  the  government  envisages  an \nexpansion of such expenditure within the limited fiscal resources available during 2017\u20132019.12 \nIncreased  budget  allocations  for  road  maintenance  are  included  in  the  government\u2019s \ndevelopment strategy. \n \n14. \nImproving  water  supply  and  sewerage  services  through  a  single  lessor.  The \nsigning  of  a  15-year  lease  contract  with  a  private  single  concessionaire  covering  Armenia\u2019s \nwater supply and sanitation system is expected in the fourth quarter of 2016. Despite the urgent \nneed  to  upgrade  sanitation  assets,  limited  fiscal  resources  called  for  prioritizing  water  supply \nover sanitation investments. The government\u2019s development strategy focuses on investment in \nwater supply, expanding water access to all communities, and full cost recovery. \n \n15. \nAttracting  private  investors  and  optimizing  power  usage.  To  introduce  market \npricing,  the  government  is  taking  the  first  step  toward  a  multibuyer\u2013multiseller  system  through \nthird-party access to the power grid. This will allow large customers to purchase power directly \nfrom  generating  companies.13 These  reforms  facilitate  regional  trade  and  wholesale  trade  of \nsurplus capacity to generate additional revenues, which makes rehabilitation of the aging assets \nand  investments  in  new  assets  attractive  to  investors.  The  reforms  require  legislative  and \nregulatory  amendments  and  investments  that  upgrade  the  power  grid.  Development  partners \nare working with the government to address these needs.  \n \n16. \nADB\u2019s  experience.  The  support  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  improving \nPFM  in  infrastructure  started  with  the  preparation  of  the  Infrastructure  Sustainability  Support \nProgram in 2012.14 The program focused on institutional reforms to align government agencies \nin  the  water  and  road  sectors  with  their  responsibilities  and  avoid  duplication  of  efforts.  In  the \nMOTCIT, program budgeting was initiated, a road sector council was established to coordinate \ninteragency  policy  and  planning,  a  road  sector  regulator  was  created,  and  a  road  financing \nstrategy  was  prepared  to  help  identify  high-level  investment  needs.  The  SCWE  prepared  a \nwater supply financing strategy to help guide future investment, and established a water asset \nmanagement plan and asset registry. Internal audit functions were strengthened in the MOTCIT \nand the SCWE by establishing internal audit committees and preparing risk-based audit plans. \nAlthough  the  program  reforms  piloted  some  aspects  of  program  budgeting,  additional \n                                                 \n11 The  Infrastructure  Sustainability  Support  Program  provided  the  MOTCIT  and  SCWE  with  the  framework  for \nprogram budgeting and piloted program budgeting. Phase 2 of the program will support both agencies as well as \nthe Ministry of Energy, Industry and Natural Resources with the rollout. \n\n12 This excludes development partner funded projects, which may combine capital and maintenance expenditures. \n13 The system operator is responsible for the operation and economic dispatch of the wholesale power market. The \n\ncurrent tariff does not reflect seasonality.  \n\n14 ADB.  2012.  Technical  Assistance  to  Armenia  for  the  Infrastructure  Sustainability  Support  Program.

Manila (Loan 3155-ARM). \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fcapabilities  and  tools  are  required  to  improve  prioritizing  expenditures  which  are  being \naddressed  under  the  program.  The  reforms  to  be  undertaken  in  phase  2  of  the  program \nrepresent  a  natural  sequence  of  the  progress  achieved  in  phase  1.  In  terms  of  investment \nprojects,  ADB  is  funding  the  North\u2013South  Corridor,  the  rehabilitation  of  the  M6  highway, \nrehabilitation of water supply systems in 18 towns and 92 villages, and the rehabilitation of the \npower  transmission  network.  ADB\u2019s  road  investment  projects  are  also  supporting  institutional \nreforms in ARD in particular improved data collection and monitoring of road network condition. \n \nLessons  learned.  Significant investments in infrastructure and ongoing policy dialogue \n17. \nhave revealed a number of important lessons, which have been incorporated into this program. \nPolicy  reforms  must  be  accompanied  by  (i)  reforms  of  involved  agencies  in  building  their \nanalytical  capabilities,  and  (ii)  incentives  to  improve  performance.  Private  participation, \nparticularly in service delivery, can lead to improved outcomes through more efficient provision \nof  quality  services.  However,  government  monitoring  of  contracts  and  strong  independent \nregulators  are  vital  to  ensure  sustained  service  improvements.  Improving  transparency  is  an \nimportant  achievement  when  decision  makers  understand  the  benefits  of  regular  engagement \nwith affected stakeholders.  \n \n18. \nADB\u2019s  value  added  to  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  program.  The \npreparation of phase 2 of the Infrastructure Sustainability Support Program was associated with \nsignificant  policy  dialogue  leading  to  the  introduction  of  a  value-added  tax  on  diesel  and \nincreases in other fuel excise taxes estimated at $63 million over 2017\u20132019. These measures \nprovide  fiscal  resources  for  road  maintenance  expenditure  increases  of  at  least  $35  million. \nAlso, ADB\u2019s policy dialogue provided for maintenance expenditures of $79 million over 15 years \nin  the  new  draft  water  supply  lease  contract.  A  stronger  PSRC  developed  drinking  water  and \nwastewater regulatory rules in public consultation with beneficiaries. Continuing efforts initiated \nunder  the  program,  MOTCIT  and  SCWE  are  now  beginning  to  systematically  implement \nprogram budgeting and improve investment planning and prioritization. ADB also contributed to \npolicy dialogue in power sector reforms and will continue its support in implementing tranche 2 \nreforms under the attached TA. This will help upgrade capabilities of the MOTCIT, SCWE, and \nthe  Ministry  of  Energy,  Industry  and  Natural  Resources  (MOEINR)  via  the  rollout  of  program \nbudgeting;  support  the  PSRC  in  establishing  market  rules  for  a  power  tariff  structure  and \npreparing a power grid code to enable regional power trading; improve ARD\u2019s transparency in \ndecision-making, capacity and operational efficiency, and ability to recruit and retain competent \nstaff; and build the new investment planning and asset management department in the SCWE.15 \nThese  reforms  were  also  as  a  result  of  dialogue  through  the  design  of  ADB\u2019s  investment \nprojects, and they support increased sustainability in these projects as well. \n \n19. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  ADB  coordinates  its  activities  with  a  number  of \ndevelopment  partners.  The  IMF  provided  a  $116  million  extended  fund  facility  in  2014  and \nconducted  its  third  review  in  May  2016.  The  review  concluded  that  the  government\u2019s \nperformance  was  broadly  satisfactory  and  reflected  the  difficult  external  conditions,  including \nfalling  remittance  inflows  and  depressed  commodity  prices.  The  successful  completion  of  the \nthird review  provided for  the  disbursement  of $22  million. The IMF\u2019s  4th  review  is  ongoing  and \nthe IMF is confident that a successful conclusion will be reached with the Armenia authorities, \nand the review will be formally completed after IMF Board consideration on 11 December 2016. \nThe World  Bank  funds  (i)  the  upgrade  of  local  roads  that  connect  to  republican  and  interstate \n\n                                                 \n15 A power grid code is a set of technical specifications that defines the parameters for connecting to a power network \n\nto ensure safe, secure, and proper economic functioning of the power network. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fhighways, (ii) tax administration reforms, and (iii) power transmission system improvement. The \nUnited States Agency for International Development supports power sector reforms, tax reform, \nand  clean  energy  initiatives.  German  development  coordination  through  (i)  KfW  funds  rural \nwater supply systems and power transmission between Armenia and Georgia, and (ii) Deutsche \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit supports PFM improvements.  \n \n20. \nPolicy-based  loan  and  budget  support.  The  proposed  policy-based  loan  leverages \nmultisector  reforms  while  contributing  to  finance  the  budget  deficit  and  ring-fence  specific \nexpenditures  related  to  the  proposed  reforms.  The  program  will  be  disbursed  in  two  tranches \nand  has  attached  TA.  Tranche  1  will  focus  on  (i)  improving  the  independence,  transparency, \nand accountability of the PSRC; (ii) increasing funding for maintenance expenditure for road and \nwater  sectors  and  improving  revenues  of  private  utilities  in  the  water  and  power  sectors;  (iii) \nintroducing  reforms  to  improve  the  transparency  in  decision-making,  capacity,  and  operational \nefficiency  of  ARD;  (iv)  strengthening  SCWE  in  asset  management  and  investment  planning;, \nand (v) encouraging competition among buyers in the power sector. Tranche 2 will focus on (i) \nrolling  out  program  budgeting  across  government,  with  specific  support  to  MOEINR,  MOTCIT, \nand  SCWE;  (ii)  increasing  the  funding  of  PSRC;  and  (iii)  improving  funding  for  water  supply, \nroad maintenance, and power distribution. The program will be executed in 2016 and 2017, with \n16 policy actions to be completed in tranche 1 and 18 policy actions in tranche 2. \n \nEconomic  benefits  and  adjustment  costs  of  reforms.  The  program  will  lead  to \n21. \nincreased  financing  for  maintenance  and  better  management  of  infrastructure  assets  in  the \nroad,  water,  and  power  sectors.  Better  maintenance  reduces  the  need  for  rehabilitation. \nEconomic  benefits  will  be  realized  through  government  cost  savings  on  major  rehabilitation \nworks,  reduced  government  subsidies  to  the  sectors,  and  increased  tax  revenue.  Improved \nrevenues  and  tightly  managed  expenditures  create  fiscal  resources  for  high-priority  needs. \nRoad users will gain economic benefits from reduced transportation costs, and water and power \nconsumers  will  benefit  from  more  reliable  services.  Strengthened  regulation  of  these  sectors, \nimproved  competition  in  the  power  sector,  and  reforms  required  to  export  power  will  have  a \nbroader  positive  impact  on  inclusive  growth.  Total  economic  benefits  from  the  program  are \nsignificant and estimated at $339 million during 2016\u20132019. In addition, the adjustment costs of \nthe reforms are estimated at $67 million during 2016\u20132018.16  \n \n22. \nAlignment with government and  ADB strategies. The program is consistent with the \nArmenia Development Strategy, 2014\u20132025; the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, 2016\u2013\n2019;  and  the  Republic  of  Armenia  Government  Program.17 It  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Midterm \nReview of Strategy 2020; Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020; Sustainable Transport Initiative \nOperational  Plan;  the  Energy  Policy;  country  partnership  strategy,  2014\u20132018;  and  country \noperations business plan, 2016\u20132018.18  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n23. \n\nThe program impact is aligned with improved service delivery in road, water supply and \n\n                                                 \n16 Economic Analysis (available from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Government  of  Armenia. 2012.

The  outcome  will  be  improved  management  and  sustainability  of  road,  water \nsupply, and power sectors. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n24. \nOutput  1:  Improved  public  financial  management  and  utility  regulation.  The \ngovernment will substantially improve PFM through the rollout of program budgeting. Instructed \nby  MOF,  line  agencies  will  implement  program  budgeting.  Under  the  program  the  MOTCIT, \nSCWE,  and  MOEINR  will  build  requisite  capabilities  for  this  purpose.  The  government  will \nimprove  the  PSRC\u2019s  independence,  transparency,  and  accountability,  and  provide  adequate \nfinancing for it to fulfill its mandate. A private concessionaire will be contracted to provide water \nsupply  services  throughout  Armenia  during  2017\u20132031,  and  the  PSRC  is  preparing  drinking \nwater and wastewater rules and model contracts for approval in 2016.  \n \n25. \nOutput 2: Increased financing and improved operations in the road sector. Annual \nroad maintenance expenditure will increase from $23.3 million in 2016 to $42.5 million in 2019\u2014\nan annual average increase of 22%. That increase will be fully funded by road users, with the \nintroduction  of  a  20%  value-added  tax  on  diesel  and  an  increase  in  excise  taxes  on  diesel, \npetrol, and compressed natural gas. These measures are estimated to generate $21 million in \nrevenues  annually.  The  MOTCIT  will  improve  road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  via \nstrengthening ARD\u2019s transparency in decision-making, capacity and operational efficiency. This \nincludes  better  prioritization  through  introducing  international  roughness  index  calculations  as \npart of cost\u2013benefit analysis, broadening the types of maintenance work to be undertaken, using \nsimplified performance-based contracts, and providing greater flexibility on the scope and time \nperiods  covered  in  road  maintenance  contracts.  To  improve  critical  information  for  prioritizing \nrecurrent and capital expenditures for roads, the MOTCIT will issue traffic count and evaluation \nguidelines, install at least 10 traffic count stations, and undertake a pavement condition survey.  \n \nOutput 3: Increased financing and improved operations in the water sector. SCWE \n26. \nwill  sign  a  15-year  lease  contract  with  a  private concessionaire to  deliver  piped  drinking  water \nacross  Armenia  in  2017.  The  SCWE  will  ensure  that  the  signed  lease  contract  with  the  new \nprivate  water  operator  will  include  an  allocation  for  maintenance  of  at  least  $79  million  for  the \nconcession period, to be funded from tariff revenues, thereby limiting fiscal contingent liabilities. \nThe  contract  will  also  include  appropriate  performance  indicators  for  the  daily  availability  of \nwater,  reducing  NRW  and  maintaining  water  quality.  NRW  is  estimated  to  be  as  high  as  75% \n(footnote 7). Under phase 2 of the Infrastructure Sustainability Support Program, the SCWE has \nset  out  a  plan  as the  basis for  negotiations  with the concessionaire  to  reduce  NRW  within the \nnew  lease  contract.19 The  SCWE  will  contract  annual  audits  to  ensure  the  concessionaire\u2019s \ncompliance  with  the  terms  of  the  contract.  To  ensure  proper  management  oversight  of  its \nassets,  the  SCWE  will  establish  an  investment  planning  and  asset  management  unit.  The \ngovernment will also review laws and regulations to improve sanitation services. \n \n27. \nlevel  of  power  sector  competitiveness  and  revenue \ngeneration.  The  MOEINR  intends  to  liberalize  the  power  sector  market  to  make  the  sector \nfinancially  sustainable  and  more  efficient.  It  will  do  this  by  (i)  developing  market  rules  and \nstructure that allow broader competition and opportunity for cross-border and interstate trade of \n\nOutput  4: \n\nIncreased \n\n                                                 \n19 ADB is currently designing a new urban water supply investment project in Armenia. Through this project, work will \nalso be undertaken to strengthen the legal framework related to NRW in condominiums. ADB estimates that NRW \nwould drop by 50% if the issue was resolved in condominiums. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fsurplus seasonal power; (ii) introducing a tariff for the single power distribution company, which \nwill  allow  third  parties  to  access  the  distribution  network,  import  power,  and  enable  direct \ncontracting between power producers and large customers; and (iii) amending the Energy Law \n(2001) to allow greater competition and cross-border and interstate trading. Multiple options for \na future market structure have been developed and some amendments to the Energy Law are \nbeing  proposed.  After  consultation  with  stakeholders,  the  government  will  implement  the \npreferred  market  structure  and  submit  amendments  to  the  Energy  Law  to  the  National \nAssembly.  The  amendments  are  also  necessary  to  ensure  compliance  with  European  Union \nobligations to enable power trading with the European Union network. The PSRC will introduce \na grid code to improve transmission and distribution network operations for the system operator \nand  ensure  technically  sound  cross-border  trading.  Finally,  the  government  will  appoint \nindependent  directors  to  the  boards  of  wholly-owned  power  corporations,  with  at  least  one \nwoman director, to ensure sustainability of reforms through a stronger corporate structure. \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nThe  government  has  requested  a  policy-based  loan  of  $90  million  to  help  finance  the \n28. \nprogram. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, a straight-line \nrepayment  method,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  average  loan \nmaturity  is  9.25  years,  and  there  is  no  maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB.  The  loan  will  be \nreleased in two tranches, subject to compliance with the agreed tranche release conditions. The \nfirst tranche of $60 million will be released upon loan effectiveness, while the second tranche of \n$30 million will be released once tranche conditions have been met. The size of the program is \nbased on the financing needs of Armenia, the development impact of the policy reform package, \nand the development spending arising from the reform. With a projected budget deficit of 4.1% \nof  GDP  for  2016,  possibly  higher  if  economic  conditions  worsen,  the  government  plans  to \nborrow $599 million in 2016 and $503 million in 2017. ADB\u2019s $60 million loan disbursement will \nfinance 10% of the borrowing requirements for 2016 and the $30 million disbursement in 2017 \nwill finance 6% of the required borrowing. Development expenditure on roads, water supply, and \npower is currently projected to be $128 million in 2016 and $131 million in 2017 (Medium-Term \nExpenditure Framework 2017\u20132019). The program will finance 47% of this expenditure in 2016 \nand 23% in 2017. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n29. \nThe MOF is the executing agency and the MOF, MOEINR, MOTCIT, PSRC, and SCWE \nare  implementing  agencies.  The  MOF  will  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  program.  The \nproceeds of the loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  will  monitor  program  implementation  by  review \nmissions  and  discussion  of  progress  with  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  The \nimplementation of the program is expected to be completed by 31 December 2017. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n30. \nTA  is  required  to  assist  the  government  in  implementing  tranche  2.  The  MOF  is  the \nexecuting  agency  and  the  MOF,  MOEINR,  MOTCIT,  PSRC,  and  SCWE  are  implementing \nagencies. The TA  will  require an  estimated  47  person-months  of  expert services,  including  an \nestimated 14 person-months of international and 33 person-months of national expert services. \nThe  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursements will be made in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Handbook  (2010).  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $550,000,  of \nwhich $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis from by ADB's Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF-other sources). The TA will be carried out until 31 December 2017. \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n31. \nThe  poor  coverage  and  quality  of  infrastructure  services  adversely  affect  the  cost  of \ndoing  business  and  access  to  services  by  the  population.  This  leads  to  increased  costs  for \naccessing  markets,  health,  and  education  services  as  well  as  high  costs  for  vehicle  repair  for \nvehicles  using  deteriorated  roads,  and  high  investment  cost  for  individual  acquisition  of  water \nstorage and power generation to secure services when the public system is out of service.  \n \n32. \nUnder  the  program,  the  water  tariff  will  reflect  full  operational  and  maintenance \nexpenditures, key performance indicators, and regular tariff adjustments.20 The performance risk \nis borne by the private concessionaire, while the government will monitor the concessionaire\u2019s \ncontractual  service  performance  obligations.  A  power  distribution  tariff  will  support  full  cost \nrecovery  and  adequate  remuneration  of  power  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution \ncompanies.21 Tariff setting will be supported by a more independent and transparent PSRC. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe  government  is  strengthening  its  PFM  system,  primarily  through  the  full  rollout  of \n33. \nprogram  budgeting. The  MOEINR,  MOTCIT,  and  SCWE  will  be  capable  of  executing  program \nbudgeting,  and  have  strengthened  internal  audit.  While  a  public  expenditure  and  financial \naccountability assessment states that the PFM system performance is robust, weaknesses were \nidentified  in  fiscal  discipline,  allocation  of  resources,  and  cost-effective  service  delivery.22 The \ngovernment\u2019s Anticorruption Council is responsible for setting anticorruption policies and leading \nrelated investigations and imposing remedies. However, the work of the council does not appear \nto  be  effective  as  the  council  does  not  meet  regularly  and  has  not  produced  significant \nrecommendations  for  reform.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n34. \nNo adverse impact on poor and vulnerable groups is expected from the policy reforms. \nImproved program budgeting will increase fiscal resources, enabling the government to secure \nadequate  development  financing,  including  social  expenditures  indirectly  benefiting  the  poor. \nCurrently no women are represented on boards of government wholly-owned power companies. \nThrough  this  program  at  least  one  woman  will  be  appointed  to  each  of  these  boards  to  help \naddress  the  gender  imbalance  and  also  ensure  gender  issues  are  considered  at  the  highest \nlevels of these companies. \n\n                                                 \n20 Under the lease contract, the government will remain the owner of the water supply system. Major capital works \n\nwill need to be funded by the government. The envisaged water tariff will not cover such costs. \n\n21 Generation and transmission tariffs exist. However, the lack of a distribution tariff adversely impacts the revenues \n\nof generation and transmission companies. \n\n22 Public  Expenditure  Financial  Accountability  Secretariat.  2014.

The  program  provides  opportunities  for  introducing  good  practices  for  climate  risk \nmanagement and climate resilience thereby having an attribution to climate adaptation finance. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures in the risk assessment and risk management plan \nare summarized in the table.23 The benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nSummary of Major Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nWeak  economic  conditions  adversely  affect \ngovernment  revenues  and  may  result  in \ncuts  to  government  expenditure,  especially \non road maintenance. \nWeak capacity in government agencies may \nresult in uneven implementation of program \nbudgeting.  \nThe  framework  for  anticorruption  is  poorly \nenforced with government agencies. \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe program will ensure specific increases in budgeted \nroad  maintenance  expenditure  during  2017\u20132019.  Fuel \ntax  increases  will  generate  higher  revenues  to  help \noffset higher maintenance expenditure.  \nDevelopment  partners,  including  ADB,  are  providing \nsupport \nsmooth \ncapacity \nimplementation of program budgeting. \nimplementation  of  program  budgeting  and \nFull \nstrengthened  internal  audit  units,  will  support  better \nenforcement of the anticorruption framework.  \n\nto  ensure \n\nto  build \n\nSources:  ADB.  2013.
