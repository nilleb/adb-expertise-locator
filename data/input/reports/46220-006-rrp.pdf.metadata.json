THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based loan to Armenia for the Infrastructure Sustainability Support Program (Phase 2).1 \nThe report also describes the proposed technical assistance (TA) for Supporting Implementation \nof Phase 2 of the Infrastructure Sustainability Support Program, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.2 \n \n2.  The proposed program aims to improve infrastructure operation and sustainability in \nArmenia through reforms in the road, water, and power sectors. The program will achieve this \nthrough  introducing  program  budgeting,  improved  regulation,  increased  budget  and  other \nallocations for maintenance, improved contracting and maintenance practices and institutions \nfor infrastructure service delivery, and increased power sector revenue generation. Greater \nfinancial  sustainability  of  power  and  water  utilities  will  reduce  fiscal  stress  and  contingent \nliabilities. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Armenia faces economic challenges and a tight fiscal situation. Although Armenia\u2019s \nreal gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual average of 4.7% from 2010 to 2014, the \neconomy  remains  vulnerable  to  external  shocks  because  of  its  narrow  export  base  and \ndependence on remittance inflows. With the onset of the recession in the Russian Federation, \nand lowering export demand from its main trading partners, GDP growth moderated from 3.5% \nin 2014 to 3.0% in 2015 and is expected to drop to 2.2% in 2016. Plummeting remittance inflows \nprompted a 30% depreciation of the dram in November 2014. Declining fiscal revenues related \nto lower import tax revenues and rising public expenditures resulted in a surging budget deficit \nthat reached 4.8% of GDP in 2015 from 2.1% in 2014. The deficit is forecast to reach 4.1% in \n2016, possibly higher if economic conditions worsen. In concert with the International Monetary \nFund (IMF), the government plans to reduce the budget deficit to 2.8% of GDP in 2017 through \naggressive prioritization of public expenditures and increasing revenues through a new tax \ncode.3 The public debt\u2014GDP ratio is expected to increase from 43.5% in 2014 to 54.0% in 2017 \nand, in line with IMF projections, is expected to moderate to 52.2% by 2021 (footnote 3). Public \ndebt  service  is  expected  to  increase  from  3.6%  of  GDP  in  2015  to  4.2%  in  2017.  The \ngovernment\u2019s  fiscal  consolidation  limits  budget  allocations  for  infrastructure  investment, \noperation, and maintenance in the foreseeable future, emphasizing the need for improved cost \nrecovery, generation of alternative revenues, and better management of fiscal resources. \n \n4.  Infrastructure sustainability is important for inclusive growth. Although Armenia\u2019s \npoverty head count improved from 35% in 2011 to 30% in 2014, the incidence of income \npoverty remains high and is likely to increase in the context of the ongoing decline in growth.4 \nProviding adequate infrastructure services is critical to supporting economic activity and income \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided preparatory technical assistance for the Infrastructure Sustainability \nSupport Program, Phase 2 (TA 9065-ARM). \n3  IMF. 2016. Armenia: Third Review Under the Extended Arrangement, and Request for Waiver and Modification of \nPerformance Criteria. IMF Country Report No. 16/246. Washington, DC. \n4  Government of Armenia, National Statistical Service. 2015. Statistical Analytical Report: Social Snapshot and \nPoverty in Armenia. Yerevan. ", "2 \ngeneration, especially outside the capital city. Rural Armenia is home to 37% of the population, \nand 36% of the labor force is active in agriculture. However, agriculture contributes only 19% to \nGDP (2015), as many farms engage in subsistence activities and many self-employed people \nare trapped in low-productivity jobs. The poverty head count in secondary towns and rural areas \nof 32% (2015) points to underserved regions, which suffer from poor transport connectivity and \nlow quality of infrastructure and utility services. As of 2014, a significant part of the rural \npopulation had to travel more than 10 kilometers (km) to reach agricultural markets (57%), \nbanks (47%), and hospitals (44%) (footnote 4). As rural households primarily access such \nservices by vehicle, the poor condition of roads is an important factor impeding economic \nactivity in Armenia\u2019s regions. While 96% of the urban population is serviced by private water \nconcession contracts and benefit from adequate sanitation, only 78% of the rural population \ndoes.5 Armenia has 100% access to electricity, but this is being threatened by the lack of \nnecessary  capital  to  fund  the  rehabilitation  of  aging  power  infrastructure.  Aging  public \ninfrastructure, limited fiscal resources and the lack of adequate prioritization and management \nof scarce public resources, limit opportunities for inclusive growth, especially in the regions. \n \n5.  Road network sustainability issues. Armenia\u2019s road network is 7,531 km long, of \nwhich 1,759 km (23.4%) are interstate roads connecting Armenia to its neighbors, 1,966 km \n(26.1%) are republican roads that connect major cities and towns, and 3,806 km (50.5%) are \nrural roads.6 The interstate roads have deteriorated substantially with 30% classified in poor \ncondition in 2014, up from 6% in 2010, while the republican roads improved, with 22% of roads \nclassified as poor in 2014 down from 49% in 2010 (footnote 6). It is estimated that 60% of local \nroads require rehabilitation and that only 66% of communities have a satisfactory connection \nwith republican or interstate roads (footnote 6).  \n \n6.  Road maintenance budget allocations are insufficient to adequately maintain the road \nnetwork and limit further deterioration. However, opportunities exist to improve maintenance by \nstreamlining functions of government agencies and coordinating maintenance and rehabilitation, \nimproving information on the maintenance status, and prioritizing maintenance needs. The \nArmenian  Roads  Directorate  (ARD),  which  is  currently  an  agency  under  the  Ministry  of \nTransport,  Communication  and  Information  Technology  (MOTCIT),  requires  significant \nstrengthening, gearing it toward a gradual evolution into an independent body that is able to \nattract  and  retain  qualified  staff  to  fulfill  its  mandate.  Currently,  the  ARD\u2019s  mandate  is \nundermined by its subordination under MOTCIT, focusing on managing maintenance contracts \nand lacking prioritization of maintenance expenditures. The existing public contract laws under \nwhich the ARD outsources road maintenance work to private companies need to be amended to \npermit performance-based contracts and more flexibility.  \n \n7.  Water supply sustainability issues. Since 2002, the government has carried out major \nreforms in the water supply and sanitation sector. The State Committee for Water Economy \n(SCWE)  was  established  and  urban  water  supply  has  been  contracted  to  private \nconcessionaires, which has expanded to 92% of the service coverage in urban areas covered \nby  the  concessionaires.  However,  tariff  revenues  are  insufficient  to  cover  operation  and \nmaintenance costs and the government provides an annual $12.6 million equivalent to meet the \nrevenue shortfall. This does not include debt service and full maintenance expenditures which \n                                                \n5  World Bank. 2016. World Development Indicators 2016.

Yerevan. \n ", "3 \nlead  to  significant  fiscal  contingent  liabilities. 7 The  revenue  of  water  utilities  would  be \nsignificantly improved if nonrevenue water (NRW) caused by leakage and improper metering of \nurban condominiums was eliminated. It is estimated that 183 million cubic meters or $67 million \ncould be recovered annually from users, which would provide significant fiscal savings while \nimproving utility services through revenues generated by the concessionaire. In addition, 560 \nrural communities representing 8% of the population are serviced through inadequate local \nwater supply systems that require significant investment to reduce water rationing. \n \n8.  The Armenia Water Supply and Sanitation Strategy (2015) emphasized that revenues \nfor water supply and sanitation services would need to rise by 140% by 2030 to recover the full \ncost of supply and debt service.8 As for sanitation, only 4 of the 20 wastewater treatment plants \nare  operating,  indicating  the  urgent  need  for  replacement  investment.  The  situation  is \nparticularly severe in rural areas where waste is untreated and stored in cesspits. The strategy \nestimates the cost for water and sanitation investments for communities connected to the piped \nnetwork at $1.32 billion and for unconnected communities, $1.23 billion.  \n \n9.  Power  sector  sustainability  issues.  Since  the  mid-1990s  the  government  has \nimplemented a number of significant reforms in the power sector, including (i) unbundling the \nvertically integrated power sector into generation, transmission, and distribution companies; (ii) \nprivatizing power and gas distribution, and most power generating companies;9 (iii) promoting \nrenewable energy; and (iv) maintaining a cost recovery tariff. However, Armenia\u2019s installed \ncapacity  is  4,336  megawatts  (2015)  of  which  only  2,589  megawatts  or  59%  is  currently \navailable, and power transmission and distribution reliability and efficiency is undermined by \nassets that are more than 30 years old. Armenia\u2019s single-buyer structure does not support \nnational or regional trade of seasonal surplus capacity, which has led to suboptimal energy use \nand pricing. Establishing wholesale and export trading, and thus market-based pricing, would \nattract private sector investment and improve power sector sustainability. \n \n10.  Utility  regulation  issues.  Established  in  1997,  the  Public  Services  Regulatory \nCommission  (PSRC)  is  a  multi-utility  regulator  covering  energy,  water,  electronic \ncommunications, as well as postal services and railways. Although it has a well-established \ndecision-making  process,  the  PSRC  has  been  criticized  for  not  explaining  sufficiently  the \nrationale for its key tariff decisions. For example, protests over the PSRC\u2019s power price decision \nin 2015 raised concern about the PSRC\u2019s ineffective public communication. This triggered calls \nfor a more transparent and accountable PSRC. \n \n11.  The government\u2019s strategy. In its Armenia Development Strategy, 2014\u20132025, the \ngovernment recognizes the need to improve its management of public infrastructure to improve \nconnectivity and utility services, as well as the need for broad public financial management \n(PFM) reforms. It initiated key reforms as described in paras. 12\u201315.10  \n \n12.  Transition  from  line  item  budgeting  to  program  budgeting.  The  government \nrecognized that the current line item budgeting is not providing desired performance incentives \nto manage expenditures. By 2018, all government agencies are required to present programs \n                                                \n7  Dorsch International Consultants. 2014. Water Sector Study Armenia.

Yerevan. \n ", "4 \nthat include key performance indicators as expenditure triggers. While this approach provides \nmore flexibility by the spending units, the units must justify prioritization of budget allocations to \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  which  retains  its  role  in  allocating  overall  resources  and \nmonitoring efficient use of such resources.11 \n \n13.  Improving road sector maintenance. To enhance road maintenance, the government \nwill introduce performance-based contracts for the ARD contractors. In addition, the ARD will \nconcurrently improve its analytical capability to prioritize maintenance expenditures. As the \ncurrent government budget for road maintenance of approximately $23.3 million annually is \ninsufficient to reverse the deterioration of road infrastructure, the government envisages an \nexpansion of such expenditure within the limited fiscal resources available during 2017\u20132019.12 \nIncreased  budget  allocations  for  road  maintenance  are  included  in  the  government\u2019s \ndevelopment strategy. \n \n14.  Improving  water  supply  and  sewerage  services  through  a  single  lessor.  The \nsigning of a 15-year lease contract with a private single concessionaire covering Armenia\u2019s \nwater supply and sanitation system is expected in the fourth quarter of 2016. Despite the urgent \nneed to upgrade sanitation assets, limited fiscal resources called for prioritizing water supply \nover sanitation investments. The government\u2019s development strategy focuses on investment in \nwater supply, expanding water access to all communities, and full cost recovery. \n \n15.  Attracting  private  investors  and  optimizing  power  usage.  To  introduce  market \npricing, the government is taking the first step toward a multibuyer\u2013multiseller system through \nthird-party access to the power grid. This will allow large customers to purchase power directly \nfrom generating companies.13 These reforms facilitate regional trade and wholesale trade of \nsurplus capacity to generate additional revenues, which makes rehabilitation of the aging assets \nand  investments  in  new  assets  attractive  to  investors. The  reforms  require  legislative  and \nregulatory amendments and investments that upgrade the power grid. Development partners \nare working with the government to address these needs.  \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s experience. The support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for improving \nPFM in infrastructure started with the preparation of the Infrastructure Sustainability Support \nProgram in 2012.14 The program focused on institutional reforms to align government agencies \nin the water and road sectors with their responsibilities and avoid duplication of efforts. In the \nMOTCIT, program budgeting was initiated, a road sector council was established to coordinate \ninteragency policy and planning, a road sector regulator was created, and a road financing \nstrategy was prepared to help identify high-level investment needs. The SCWE prepared a \nwater supply financing strategy to help guide future investment, and established a water asset \nmanagement plan and asset registry. Internal audit functions were strengthened in the MOTCIT \nand the SCWE by establishing internal audit committees and preparing risk-based audit plans. \nAlthough  the  program  reforms  piloted  some  aspects  of  program  budgeting,  additional \n                                                \n11 The Infrastructure Sustainability Support Program provided the MOTCIT and SCWE with the framework for \nprogram budgeting and piloted program budgeting. Phase 2 of the program will support both agencies as well as \nthe Ministry of Energy, Industry and Natural Resources with the rollout. \n12 This excludes development partner funded projects, which may combine capital and maintenance expenditures. \n13 The system operator is responsible for the operation and economic dispatch of the wholesale power market. The \ncurrent tariff does not reflect seasonality.  \n14 ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to Armenia for the Infrastructure Sustainability Support Program. Manila (TA \n8249-ARM); and ADB. 2014. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed \nPolicy-Based Grant and Technical Assistance Grant to Armenia for the Infrastructure Sustainability Support \nProgram. Manila (Loan 3155-ARM). \n ", "5 \ncapabilities  and  tools  are  required  to  improve  prioritizing  expenditures  which  are  being \naddressed  under  the  program.  The  reforms  to  be  undertaken  in  phase  2  of  the  program \nrepresent a natural sequence of the progress achieved in phase 1. In terms of investment \nprojects,  ADB  is  funding  the  North\u2013South  Corridor,  the  rehabilitation  of  the  M6  highway, \nrehabilitation of water supply systems in 18 towns and 92 villages, and the rehabilitation of the \npower transmission network. ADB\u2019s road investment projects are also supporting institutional \nreforms in ARD in particular improved data collection and monitoring of road network condition. \n \n17.  Lessons learned. Significant investments in infrastructure and ongoing policy dialogue \nhave revealed a number of important lessons, which have been incorporated into this program. \nPolicy  reforms  must  be  accompanied  by  (i)  reforms  of  involved  agencies  in  building  their \nanalytical  capabilities,  and  (ii)  incentives  to  improve  performance.  Private  participation, \nparticularly in service delivery, can lead to improved outcomes through more efficient provision \nof  quality  services.  However,  government  monitoring  of  contracts  and  strong  independent \nregulators are vital to ensure sustained service improvements. Improving transparency is an \nimportant achievement when decision makers understand the benefits of regular engagement \nwith affected stakeholders.  \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s  value  added  to  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  program.  The \npreparation of phase 2 of the Infrastructure Sustainability Support Program was associated with \nsignificant  policy  dialogue  leading  to  the  introduction  of  a  value-added  tax  on  diesel  and \nincreases in other fuel excise taxes estimated at $63 million over 2017\u20132019. These measures \nprovide fiscal resources for road maintenance expenditure increases of at least $35 million. \nAlso, ADB\u2019s policy dialogue provided for maintenance expenditures of $79 million over 15 years \nin the new draft water supply lease contract. A stronger PSRC developed drinking water and \nwastewater regulatory rules in public consultation with beneficiaries. Continuing efforts initiated \nunder  the  program,  MOTCIT  and  SCWE  are  now  beginning  to  systematically  implement \nprogram budgeting and improve investment planning and prioritization. ADB also contributed to \npolicy dialogue in power sector reforms and will continue its support in implementing tranche 2 \nreforms under the attached TA. This will help upgrade capabilities of the MOTCIT, SCWE, and \nthe Ministry of Energy, Industry and Natural Resources (MOEINR) via the rollout of program \nbudgeting; support the PSRC  in  establishing market rules for  a  power tariff structure  and \npreparing a power grid code to enable regional power trading; improve ARD\u2019s transparency in \ndecision-making, capacity and operational efficiency, and ability to recruit and retain competent \nstaff; and build the new investment planning and asset management department in the SCWE.15 \nThese reforms were also as a result of dialogue through the design of ADB\u2019s investment \nprojects, and they support increased sustainability in these projects as well. \n \n19.  Development partner coordination. ADB coordinates its activities with a number of \ndevelopment partners. The IMF provided a $116 million extended fund facility in 2014 and \nconducted  its  third  review  in  May  2016.  The  review  concluded  that  the  government\u2019s \nperformance was broadly satisfactory and reflected the difficult external conditions, including \nfalling remittance inflows and depressed commodity prices. The successful completion of the \nthird review provided for the disbursement of $22 million. The IMF\u2019s 4th review is ongoing and \nthe IMF is confident that a successful conclusion will be reached with the Armenia authorities, \nand the review will be formally completed after IMF Board consideration on 11 December 2016. \nThe World Bank funds (i) the upgrade of local roads that connect to republican and interstate \n                                                \n15 A power grid code is a set of technical specifications that defines the parameters for connecting to a power network \nto ensure safe, secure, and proper economic functioning of the power network. \n ", "6 \nhighways, (ii) tax administration reforms, and (iii) power transmission system improvement. The \nUnited States Agency for International Development supports power sector reforms, tax reform, \nand clean energy initiatives. German development coordination through (i) KfW funds rural \nwater supply systems and power transmission between Armenia and Georgia, and (ii) Deutsche \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit supports PFM improvements.  \n \n20.  Policy-based loan and budget support. The proposed policy-based loan leverages \nmultisector  reforms  while  contributing  to  finance  the  budget  deficit  and  ring-fence  specific \nexpenditures related to the proposed reforms. The program will be disbursed in two tranches \nand has attached TA. Tranche 1 will focus on (i) improving the independence, transparency, \nand accountability of the PSRC; (ii) increasing funding for maintenance expenditure for road and \nwater sectors and improving revenues of private utilities in the water and power sectors; (iii) \nintroducing reforms to improve the transparency in decision-making, capacity, and operational \nefficiency of ARD; (iv) strengthening SCWE in asset management and investment planning;, \nand (v) encouraging competition among buyers in the power sector. Tranche 2 will focus on (i) \nrolling out program budgeting across government, with specific support to MOEINR, MOTCIT, \nand SCWE; (ii) increasing the funding of PSRC; and (iii) improving funding for water supply, \nroad maintenance, and power distribution. The program will be executed in 2016 and 2017, with \n16 policy actions to be completed in tranche 1 and 18 policy actions in tranche 2. \n \n21.  Economic  benefits  and  adjustment  costs  of  reforms.  The  program  will  lead  to \nincreased financing for maintenance and better management of infrastructure assets in the \nroad,  water,  and  power  sectors.  Better  maintenance  reduces  the  need  for  rehabilitation. \nEconomic benefits will be realized through government cost savings on major rehabilitation \nworks, reduced government subsidies to the sectors, and increased tax revenue. Improved \nrevenues and tightly managed expenditures create fiscal resources for high-priority needs. \nRoad users will gain economic benefits from reduced transportation costs, and water and power \nconsumers will benefit from more reliable services. Strengthened regulation of these sectors, \nimproved competition in the power sector, and reforms required to export power will have a \nbroader positive impact on inclusive growth. Total economic benefits from the program are \nsignificant and estimated at $339 million during 2016\u20132019. In addition, the adjustment costs of \nthe reforms are estimated at $67 million during 2016\u20132018.16  \n \n22.  Alignment with government and ADB strategies. The program is consistent with the \nArmenia Development Strategy, 2014\u20132025; the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, 2016\u2013\n2019; and the Republic of Armenia Government Program.17 It is aligned with ADB\u2019s Midterm \nReview of Strategy 2020; Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020; Sustainable Transport Initiative \nOperational Plan; the Energy Policy; country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018; and country \noperations business plan, 2016\u20132018.18  \n \nB.

The outcome will be improved management and sustainability of road, water \nsupply, and power sectors. \n \nC.  Outputs \n24.  Output  1:  Improved  public  financial  management  and  utility  regulation.  The \ngovernment will substantially improve PFM through the rollout of program budgeting. Instructed \nby MOF, line agencies will implement program budgeting. Under the program the MOTCIT, \nSCWE, and MOEINR will build requisite capabilities for this purpose. The government will \nimprove the PSRC\u2019s independence, transparency, and accountability, and provide adequate \nfinancing for it to fulfill its mandate. A private concessionaire will be contracted to provide water \nsupply services throughout Armenia during 2017\u20132031, and the PSRC is preparing drinking \nwater and wastewater rules and model contracts for approval in 2016.  \n \n25.  Output 2: Increased financing and improved operations in the road sector. Annual \nroad maintenance expenditure will increase from $23.3 million in 2016 to $42.5 million in 2019\u2014\nan annual average increase of 22%. That increase will be fully funded by road users, with the \nintroduction of a 20% value-added tax on diesel and an increase in excise taxes on diesel, \npetrol, and compressed natural gas. These measures are estimated to generate $21 million in \nrevenues  annually.  The  MOTCIT  will  improve  road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  via \nstrengthening ARD\u2019s transparency in decision-making, capacity and operational efficiency. This \nincludes better prioritization through introducing international roughness index calculations as \npart of cost\u2013benefit analysis, broadening the types of maintenance work to be undertaken, using \nsimplified performance-based contracts, and providing greater flexibility on the scope and time \nperiods covered in road maintenance contracts. To improve critical information for prioritizing \nrecurrent and capital expenditures for roads, the MOTCIT will issue traffic count and evaluation \nguidelines, install at least 10 traffic count stations, and undertake a pavement condition survey.  \n \n26.  Output 3: Increased financing and improved operations in the water sector. SCWE \nwill sign a 15-year lease contract with a private concessionaire to deliver piped drinking water \nacross Armenia in 2017. The SCWE will ensure that the signed lease contract with the new \nprivate water operator will include an allocation for maintenance of at least $79 million for the \nconcession period, to be funded from tariff revenues, thereby limiting fiscal contingent liabilities. \nThe contract will also include appropriate performance indicators for the daily availability of \nwater, reducing NRW and maintaining water quality. NRW is estimated to be as high as 75% \n(footnote 7). Under phase 2 of the Infrastructure Sustainability Support Program, the SCWE has \nset out a plan as the basis for negotiations with the concessionaire to reduce NRW within the \nnew lease contract.19 The SCWE will contract annual audits to ensure the concessionaire\u2019s \ncompliance with the terms of the contract. To ensure proper management oversight of its \nassets, the SCWE will establish an investment planning and asset management unit. The \ngovernment will also review laws and regulations to improve sanitation services. \n \n27.  Output  4:  Increased  level  of  power  sector  competitiveness  and  revenue \ngeneration. The MOEINR intends to liberalize the power sector market to make the sector \nfinancially sustainable and more efficient. It will do this by (i) developing market rules and \nstructure that allow broader competition and opportunity for cross-border and interstate trade of \n                                                \n19 ADB is currently designing a new urban water supply investment project in Armenia. Through this project, work will \nalso be undertaken to strengthen the legal framework related to NRW in condominiums. ADB estimates that NRW \nwould drop by 50% if the issue was resolved in condominiums. \n ", "8 \nsurplus seasonal power; (ii) introducing a tariff for the single power distribution company, which \nwill allow third parties to access the distribution network, import power, and enable direct \ncontracting between power producers and large customers; and (iii) amending the Energy Law \n(2001) to allow greater competition and cross-border and interstate trading. Multiple options for \na future market structure have been developed and some amendments to the Energy Law are \nbeing  proposed.  After  consultation  with  stakeholders,  the  government  will  implement  the \npreferred  market  structure  and  submit  amendments  to  the  Energy  Law  to  the  National \nAssembly. The amendments are also necessary to ensure compliance with European Union \nobligations to enable power trading with the European Union network. The PSRC will introduce \na grid code to improve transmission and distribution network operations for the system operator \nand  ensure  technically  sound  cross-border  trading.  Finally,  the  government  will  appoint \nindependent directors to the boards of wholly-owned power corporations, with at least one \nwoman director, to ensure sustainability of reforms through a stronger corporate structure. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n28.  The government has requested a policy-based loan of $90 million to help finance the \nprogram. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, a straight-line \nrepayment  method,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The average loan \nmaturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The loan will be \nreleased in two tranches, subject to compliance with the agreed tranche release conditions. The \nfirst tranche of $60 million will be released upon loan effectiveness, while the second tranche of \n$30 million will be released once tranche conditions have been met. The size of the program is \nbased on the financing needs of Armenia, the development impact of the policy reform package, \nand the development spending arising from the reform. With a projected budget deficit of 4.1% \nof GDP for 2016, possibly higher if economic conditions worsen, the government plans to \nborrow $599 million in 2016 and $503 million in 2017. ADB\u2019s $60 million loan disbursement will \nfinance 10% of the borrowing requirements for 2016 and the $30 million disbursement in 2017 \nwill finance 6% of the required borrowing. Development expenditure on roads, water supply, and \npower is currently projected to be $128 million in 2016 and $131 million in 2017 (Medium-Term \nExpenditure Framework 2017\u20132019). The program will finance 47% of this expenditure in 2016 \nand 23% in 2017. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n29.  The MOF is the executing agency and the MOF, MOEINR, MOTCIT, PSRC, and SCWE \nare implementing agencies. The MOF will oversee the implementation of the program. The \nproceeds of the loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2015, as amended from time to time). ADB will monitor program implementation by review \nmissions  and  discussion  of  progress  with  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  The \nimplementation of the program is expected to be completed by 31 December 2017. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n30.  TA is required to assist the government in implementing tranche 2. The MOF is the \nexecuting agency and the MOF, MOEINR, MOTCIT, PSRC, and SCWE are implementing \nagencies. The TA will require an estimated 47 person-months of expert services, including an \nestimated 14 person-months of international and 33 person-months of national expert services. \nThe  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \n ", "9 \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursements will be made in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Handbook (2010). The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of \nwhich $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis from by ADB's Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF-other sources). The TA will be carried out until 31 December 2017. \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n31.  The poor coverage and quality of infrastructure services adversely affect the cost of \ndoing business and access to services by the population. This leads to increased costs for \naccessing markets, health, and education services as well as high costs for vehicle repair for \nvehicles using deteriorated roads, and high investment cost for individual acquisition of water \nstorage and power generation to secure services when the public system is out of service.  \n \n32.  Under  the  program,  the  water  tariff  will  reflect  full  operational  and  maintenance \nexpenditures, key performance indicators, and regular tariff adjustments.20 The performance risk \nis borne by the private concessionaire, while the government will monitor the concessionaire\u2019s \ncontractual service performance obligations. A power distribution tariff will support full cost \nrecovery  and  adequate  remuneration  of  power  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution \ncompanies.21 Tariff setting will be supported by a more independent and transparent PSRC. \n \nB.  Governance \n33.  The government is strengthening its PFM system, primarily through the full rollout of \nprogram budgeting. The MOEINR, MOTCIT, and SCWE will be capable of executing program \nbudgeting,  and  have  strengthened  internal  audit.  While  a  public  expenditure  and  financial \naccountability assessment states that the PFM system performance is robust, weaknesses were \nidentified in fiscal discipline, allocation of resources, and cost-effective service delivery.22 The \ngovernment\u2019s Anticorruption Council is responsible for setting anticorruption policies and leading \nrelated investigations and imposing remedies. However, the work of the council does not appear \nto  be  effective  as  the  council  does  not  meet  regularly  and  has  not  produced  significant \nrecommendations for reform. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n34.  No adverse impact on poor and vulnerable groups is expected from the policy reforms. \nImproved program budgeting will increase fiscal resources, enabling the government to secure \nadequate development financing, including social expenditures indirectly benefiting the poor. \nCurrently no women are represented on boards of government wholly-owned power companies. \nThrough this program at least one woman will be appointed to each of these boards to help \naddress the gender imbalance and also ensure gender issues are considered at the highest \nlevels of these companies. \n                                                \n20 Under the lease contract, the government will remain the owner of the water supply system. Major capital works \nwill need to be funded by the government. The envisaged water tariff will not cover such costs. \n21 Generation and transmission tariffs exist. However, the lack of a distribution tariff adversely impacts the revenues \nof generation and transmission companies. \n22 Public Expenditure Financial Accountability Secretariat. 2014.

The  program  is  classified  category  C  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples and complies with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009).  The  program  provides  opportunities  for  introducing  good  practices  for  climate  risk \nmanagement and climate resilience thereby having an attribution to climate adaptation finance. \n \nE.
