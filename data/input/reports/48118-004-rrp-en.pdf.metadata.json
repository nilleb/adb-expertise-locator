In Myanmar, the original project is being \nimplemented  with  the  National  Health  Laboratory  and  in  13  state,  regional,  and  township \nhospitals.  The  proposed  additional  financing  will  support  implementation  of  the  government\u2019s \nHealth  Sector  Contingency  Plan  (HSCP)  for  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19).3 The  additional \nfinancing  will  provide  targeted  investment  for  31  district  and  township  hospitals  requiring \nimmediate upgrading of clinical care, IPC, and human resource capacity to respond to COVID-19 \nand other future public health threats.4 The additional financing will complement ADB\u2019s support \nunder  the  COVID-19  Active  Response  and  Expenditure  Support  (CARES)  Program. 5  The \nadditional  financing  project  remains  aligned  with  the  outcome  of  the  original  project:  Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS) health system performance with regard to health security improved. \nThe report and recommendation of the President for the original project is accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the original project on 22 November 2016, \nfor a total of $125 million equivalent to Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam (footnote \n1). On 22 May 2020, additional financing of $20 million was approved for the Lao PDR to support \na new project output for emergency response to the COVID-19 outbreak (footnote 1). The project \n\n \n\n1   The original project comprises (i) loans to Cambodia (SDR15,012,000 [$21 million]), the Lao PDR (SDR2,856,000 \n[$4 million]), Myanmar ($12 million), and Viet Nam (SDR56,946,000 [$80 million]); and (ii) a grant to the Lao PDR \n($8  million).  ADB  provided  a  loan  (additional  financing)  to  the  Lao  PDR  ($20  million).  ADB  also  provided  project \npreparatory technical assistance of $1.3 million to Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam. ADB. Greater \nMekong  Subregion  Health  Security  Project;  ADB.

Geneva. \n\n4 Two of the 31 hospitals under the proposed additional financing project, Myawaddy District Hospital and Ye Township \nHospital, are also supported under the original project. Investments for these two hospitals under the original project \nand additional financing project are complementary. \n\n5   The CARES Program for Myanmar supports implementation of the government's COVID-19 Economic Relief Plan, \nincluding  investments  under  Goal  6:  Healthcare  Systems  Strengthening.  ADB.  Myanmar:  COVID-19  Active \nResponse and Expenditure Support Program. \n\n \n\n\f \n\ncompletion  date  is  31  March  2022,  and  the  loan  closing  date  is  30  September  2022.  As  of  2 \nSeptember 2020, against the elapsed project time of 65.0%, implementation of the original project \nin Myanmar was on track. Cumulative contract awards for Myanmar are $3.7 million (31.1% of \nADB financing) and disbursements $4.6 million (38.8%, including advances of $1.3 million). Of \nthe 10 outcome and output indicators for Myanmar, 5 have already been achieved, 4 are partially \nachieved,  and  1  has  yet to  start.  The  delivery  of  expected  outputs  is  rated  successful.  Project \ncovenants, including all safeguard covenants, are either complied with or are being complied with. \nThe identified project implementation risks have been adequately mitigated and the management \nof risks is rated successful.  \n \n4. \nThe  Government  of  Myanmar  has  requested  $30  million  for  the  proposed  additional \nfinancing to strengthen preparedness and response capacity of the health system for COVID-19.6 \nAs  of  18  September  2020,  Myanmar  reported  4,299  confirmed  cases  of  COVID-19,  with  68 \ndeaths.7 Of the confirmed cases, 3,995 are linked to local transmission, with clusters in Rakhine \nState, Yangon and Mandalay.8 Myanmar remains highly vulnerable to a surge in case numbers. \nThe country\u2019s high number of returning migrants from the People\u2019s Republic of China, Thailand, \nand  other  neighboring  countries,  increases  the  risk  for  imported  COVID-19  cases.9 Poor  and \ncrowded  living  conditions  in  urban  and  peri-urban  areas,  with  inadequate  water  and  sanitation \ninfrastructure, create the conditions for local transmission and the potential for spread of COVID-\n19 in the country. The high prevalence of communicable and chronic illnesses that compromise \nimmune  and  respiratory system functioning  increases the  risk  of  comorbidity  and more  severe \nclinical progression of COVID-19.10 While the Ministry of Health and Sports (MOHS) has scaled \nup the country\u2019s testing capacity, the number of tests performed remains the lowest in Southeast \nAsia at 3,906 per million population.11 \n \n5. \nThe MOHS and the World Health Organization (WHO) assess Myanmar\u2019s preparedness \ncapacity  for  responding  to  COVID-19  at  less  than  60%,  with  the  greatest  weakness  at  the \nsubnational level.12 Investment is needed immediately in district and township hospitals,13 which \nare pivotal in the assessment, isolation, and treatment of COVID-19 cases, particularly in remote \nand border areas (footnote 3). District and township hospitals face constraints in three key areas: \n(i) emergency departments and clinical wards lack facilities for separation of infectious patients \nas well as equipment for diagnosis and clinical management of severe respiratory diseases and \ncomorbidities; (ii) systems for IPC and the management of infectious medical waste are weak and \nsupplies  of  personal  protective  equipment  (PPE)  inadequate,  increasing  the  risk  of  COVID-19 \namong health sector staff, patients, and the community; and (iii) health staff, 75% of whom are \n\n \n\n6   The WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020. \nAs  of  18  September  2020,  COVID-19  had  spread  to  188  countries,  with  over  30.1  million  confirmed  cases  and \n946,158 deaths.

These hospitals are \n\nprioritized for investment under the HSCP.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nfemale, lack the requisite knowledge for assessment and clinical management of COVID-19, IPC, \nand psychosocial care for patients.14 Strengthening capacity of medical care services, IPC, and \nhuman resources in district and township hospitals is prioritized under the HSCP.15  \n \nThe proposed additional financing to the health security project is an efficient modality for \n6. \nthe  expedited  delivery  of  support  to  district  and  township  hospitals  under  MOHS\u2019s  COVID-19 \nresponse  (footnote  3).  The  approach  leverages  the  experience  of  MOHS  with  ADB  project \nadministration and its capacity to deliver activities with township and district hospitals. Channeling \nsupport as additional financing to the health security project ensures synergies between targeted \ninvestment to combat COVID-19 and ongoing efforts to strengthen preparedness and capacity to \nrespond to public health threats. The proposed additional financing has been determined to be \ntechnically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound. The project meets the criteria for \nCOVID-19 fast-track processing.16 \n\n \n\n7. \nThe project is aligned with the government\u2019s strong commitment to regional health security \nand achievement of the IHR core capacities (footnote 2). The project is consistent with the ADB \nStrategy  2030\u2019s  operational  priorities  (OPs)  to  (i)  address  remaining  poverty  and  reduce \ninequalities by achieving better health for all (OP1); (ii) accelerate progress in gender equality in \nhuman  development  (OP2);  and  (iii)  foster  regional  cooperation  and  integration,  including  the \npromotion  of  regional  public  goods  to  mitigate  cross-border  risks  of  communicable  disease \n(OP7).17 The project remains aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Myanmar, 2017\u2013\n2021,  which  prioritizes  advancing  regional  public  health  to  reduce  constraints  to  inclusive \ndevelopment.18 The project contributes to the collective goal of the GMS countries to improve the \nGMS health system response to acute public health threats.19 \n \nB. \n \n8. \nimpact:  GMS  public  health  security \nstrengthened.20 The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  GMS  health  system  performance \nwith  regard  to  health  security  improved. 21 The  impact  and  outcome  of  the  project  remain \nunchanged from the original project. The additional financing will help Myanmar comply with the \nrequirements of the IHR and WHO\u2019s Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases, in line with the \noriginal  project  outcome  indicators.22 The  project  expands  the  scope  of  the  original  project  to \nencompass investment to strengthen preparedness for responding to COVID-19 in 31 district and \n\nProject Description \n\nis  aligned  with \n\nThe  project \n\nfollowing \n\nthe \n\n \n\n14 This includes capacity to respond to persons affected by gender-based violence.

Output 4 will be rephrased \nas \u201cemergency preparedness and response capacity for COVID-19 strengthened,\u201d which will fully \ncapture the objectives of the additional financing. In line with the HSCP, activities under output 4 \nwill strengthen capacity across three core areas of district and township hospital service delivery \n(para. 5): (i) clinical management and medical care services, (ii) IPC at the project hospitals, and \n(iii) human resources. \n \n10. \nClinical  management  and  medical  care  services.  Emergency  departments,  isolation \nwards, hospital laboratories, and medical and high-dependency care units will be provided with \nequipment  to support  the  assessment,  isolation,  and treatment  of  patients  with  COVID-19  and \nassociated  comorbidities.  Small-scale  refurbishment  works  will  be  carried  out  to  enable  the \ninstallation and operation of hospital equipment, including equipment to supply oxygen, electricity, \nwater, and other essential inputs. The mix of equipment and scope of works for each hospital will \nbe determined through individual assessments. \n \n11. \nHospital  infection  prevention  and  control.  Small-scale  works  will  prepare  hospital \nwards  for  the  separation  and  isolation  of  infectious  patients  and  provide  separate  facilities  for \nfemale  and  male  patients  and  staff  members.  Autoclaves,  microwave  incinerators,  and  liquid \nwaste treatment tanks will be installed in selected hospitals, improving their management of solid \nand liquid infectious waste.

Achievements from this engagement highlight ADB\u2019s \ncomparative advantage in delivering targeted support at the regional, township and community \nlevels. ADB has leveraged this advantage in its support to the government\u2019s response to COVID-\n19. Initial reprogramming of $6.6 million under the ongoing health security project will address  \nimmediate  subnational  needs  for  laboratory  diagnostics,  emergency  care  equipment,  and \nconsumables.  The  proposed  additional  financing  project  will  complement  this  investment  by \nextending  support  for  the  COVID-19  response  to  additional  district  and  township  hospitals. \nRecognizing  that  resources  are  limited,  ADB  is  coordinating  closely  with  other  development \n\nValue Added by ADB  \n\n \n\n23 The MOHS has identified more than 100 hospitals requiring upgrading to respond to COVID-19.

These guidelines were developed in consultation with the \nWHO and are aligned with WHO\u2019s global guidelines. Detailed engineering assessments will be \nundertaken for each hospital to ensure that the requisite conditions and services are in place for \noptimum  functioning  of  the  equipment.  The  goods  contracts  for  the  installation  of  the  medical \nequipment  will  include  provisions  for  training  hospital  staff  members  on  the  use  of  equipment \nprocured under the project. The purchase of goods will prioritize those for which local agents are \npresent in Myanmar or elsewhere in the region, to facilitate after-sales services relating to spare \nparts, consumables provision, and associated support.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  economic  analysis  was  updated  following  2017  ADB's  Guidelines  on  Economic \n23. \nAnalysis (2017).34 The cost-effectiveness analysis conducted for the additional financing shows \nthat the cost per disability-adjusted life year is less than three times the gross domestic product  \nper  capita,  making  the  intervention  very  cost-effective. 35  The  results  are  robust  to  various \nsensitivity  scenarios.  The  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  conducted  for  the  original  project  was  also \nupdated. An economic internal rate of return of 28.1% was estimated for the additional financing, \nhigher than the economic internal rate of return of the original project of 23.4% and above the \nminimum required threshold of 6.0% for social sector investments.36 \n \nC. \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\nSustainability \n\n24. \nThe financial analysis confirmed that the government has adequate budgetary resources \nto absorb any incremental recurrent costs arising from the additional financing project. The annual \nincremental  cost  as  a  percentage  of  the  government\u2019s  total  health  sector  budget  ranges  from \n0.07% in FY2021 to 0.05% in FY2025. Although the economy grew at 6.8% in FY2019, ADB\u2019s \nestimation  of  the  gross  domestic  product  growth  rate  for  FY2020  has  been  reduced  to  1.8%, \n\n \n\n34 ADB. 2017.

The CERP comprises a mix of health, social, and economic measures, and will help \nstrengthen  the  health  care  system  and  increase  access  to  COVID-19  financing,  including \ncontingency  funds.  The  additional  financing  project  is  likely  to  be  sustainable  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s strong commitment to supporting the health sector. \n \nD. \n \n25. \nThe  government  continues  to  strengthen  its  public  financial  management  (PFM)  with \nsupport from  development  partners  by  reforming  the  PFM system to  improve  governance  and \ntransparency.38 The first phase of the PFM system reform focused on (i) revenue and customs \nand budget planning, execution, and reporting at the Ministry of Planning Finance and Investment; \n(ii) support for the Office of the Auditor General; and (iii) the establishment of the PFM Academy \nto  support  government  capacity  building.  The  budget  process  has  been  improved  significantly \nwith the introduction of the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework. The PFM Academy provides training \ncourses  for  line  ministries,  developed  with  support  from  development  partners,  including  the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF).39 The government started the second phase (2018\u20132022) of \nits  PFM  reform  strategy  with  various  strengthening  activities,  including  improving  procurement \nlaw, internal audit capacity, and financial reporting systems.  \n \n26. \nThe project pre-mitigation financial management and procurement risks are substantial. \nThe additional financing will be implemented by the MOHS through the DOMS. The capacity of \nthe MOHS and the DOMS remains constrained, particularly given the complexity of the supply \nmarket  for  medical  goods.  Limited  capacity  in  procurement  and  financial  management  might \nimpede  emergency  response  activities.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  UNOPS  will  be  engaged  to \nprovide procurement and related services, including for minor civil works. ADB will support the \nMOHS  in  the  recruitment  of  individual  consultants.  A  separate  advance  account  will  be \nestablished at the MOHS through the DOMS. ADB will disburse a substantial portion of the loan \nthrough direct payment arrangements to UNOPS. The Office of the Auditor General will conduct \nthe  external  audit  of  additional  financing  activities  as  part  of  the  annual  audit  process  for  the \noverall  project.  With  the  mitigation  measures,  the  financial  management  and  procurement  risk \nrating is moderate. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOHS.

The  additional  financing  project  will  decrease  communicable  diseases.  It  will \ndirectly lower the risk of COVID-19 spread by strengthening hospital capacity to diagnose, isolate, \nand  treat  COVID-19  patients.  These  interventions  will  improve  hospital  capacity  to  respond  to \nemerging disease threats. The MOHS, through its direct contract with UNOPS, will ensure that all \nworks contracts comply with national labor laws and do not involve (i) forced labor, (ii) child labor, \nand (iii) discrimination in the workplace. \n \n30. \nGender. The additional financing is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The \ngender action plan (GAP) for the original project has been updated to incorporate gender targets \nand actions for output 4. Myanmar\u2019s health workforce is highly feminized (75%): almost all nursing \nprofessionals and more than half of medical practitioners are female.43 However, a high proportion \nof  female  health  workers  are  concentrated  in  lower-level  technical  and  managerial  positions. \nCOVID-19 exacerbate social issues linked to gender inequality, particularly the incidence of GBV. \nThe  gender  and  social  dimensions  of  the  project  are  largely  concerned  with  ensuring  that  (i) \nfacilities  in  the  targeted  hospitals  guarantee  appropriate  privacy  for  female  patients  and  staff \nmembers; (ii) female and male health workers have equal opportunity to participate in trainings \non  COVID-19  clinical  management,  IPC,  laboratory  techniques;  (iii)  female  and  male  health \nworkers have access to appropriately sized PPE; and (iv) female and male health workers have \nthe required knowledge and skills to provide support and referral options to persons affected by \nGBV. The PMU, with the support of a national gender specialist, will monitor GAP implementation. \nA knowledge, attitude, and perception survey will track improvements in health workers\u2019 response \nto  GBV.  Progress  on  GAP  implementation  will  be  included  in  all  progress  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation reports. Project data will be disaggregated by sex to the extent possible.  \n \nF. \n \n31. \ncategories are as follows.44  \n \n32. \nEnvironment (category C). The additional financing will not involve any major civil works \nor  activities  in  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  Each  implementing  agency  will  assign  one \nqualified staff member to monitor and oversee minor renovation works and to establish COVID-\n19  risk  management  protocols  for  contractors  and  equipment  suppliers.  A  national  safeguard \nspecialist will support the PMU and the implementing agencies in setting up environment, health, \nand safety protocols, and will support the PMU in submitting quarterly project progress reports on \nthe  project\u2019s  performance  in  environmental  health  and  safety.
