THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Kingdom of Cambodia for the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program \n(CARES) Program under the Countercyclical Support Facility \u2013 COVID-19 pandemic response \noption (CPRO).1 \n \n2.  The CARES Program, under the CPRO of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), will \nprovide critically needed support to help the government mitigate the adverse health, social, and \neconomic impacts caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. It will provide \ngeneral budgetary support for the delivery of (i) health measures to combat the spread of COVID-\n19; (ii) social assistance and relief for affected people; and (iii) an economic stimulus for hard-hit \nbusiness segments such as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). \n \n3.  Cambodia has a record of sound macroeconomic management, yet is highly vulnerable \nbecause of its open economy and narrow economic base. The reported cases of COVID-19 as of \n23 June are low at 130 (127 recovered and no deaths), but the World Health Organization (WHO) \nwarns that Cambodia remains at high risk of a second wave of the outbreak that would rapidly \noverwhelm the health system. This would further compound the impact of the global slowdown \non  the  key  engines  of  Cambodia\u2019s  economy:  (i)  garments,  textiles,  and  footwear  (GTF);  \n(ii) tourism; and (iii) construction. ADB\u2019s growth forecast for Cambodia for 2020 was revised \ndownward to reflect the expected slowdown from a pre-COVID-19 forecast of 6.8% to \u20135.5%.2   \n \n4.  COVID-19 threatens to undermine Cambodia\u2019s progress in poverty reduction. Vulnerable \ngroups such as women and migrant workers are especially at risk. The crisis will lead to an \nestimated loss of 570,000 jobs and threatens to push an additional 1.1 million people into \nmoderate poverty and 205,000 people into extreme poverty.3 With lower revenues and new \nspending needs, the government\u2019s financing needs for 2020 have also risen from $1.7 billion to \n$3.5 billion, of which $2.2 billion is planned to be financed through external borrowing. The \ngovernment has sought CPRO support of $250 million. Cambodia meets the required CPRO \naccess criteria (Table 1).4 The CARES Program will assist the government in providing a \nresponsive countercyclical stimulus package while maintaining overall macroeconomic stability. \nCambodia will remain at moderately low risk of debt distress following the CARES Program. The \nprogram  is  aligned  with  the  country  partnership  strategy  2019\u20132023  for  Cambodia,5  and \nCambodia\u2019s commitment to collective regional action against COVID-19.6   \n \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria for COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option  \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n1. Adverse impact  The economy is projected to contract by 5.5% due to the pandemic\u2019s impact. \nof exogenous  This will likely lead to increase in unemployment rate from 0.7% to 4.4%, pushing \nshocks  an additional 1.3 million into either moderate or extreme poverty. Due to COVID-\n19, government revenues will decline by 30.9%, with the 2020 fiscal balance is \n \n1  ADB. 2020. Policy Paper: ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Cambodia also remains \nvulnerable  to  a  COVID-19  outbreak.  With  GTF,  tourism  and  construction \naccounting for 43.2% of GDP, economic revival is likely to be slow and complex. \n2. Countercyclical  Government  announced  a  pro-poor  countercyclical  fiscal  response  of  \ndevelopment  $815.7 million (3.2% of the projected 2020 GDP) to support health system \nexpenditures  preparedness, boost social assistance and mitigate the adverse economic \nimpact. The program is pro-poor, and the largest allocation of $300 million is for \npoor and vulnerable groups including women and children.  \n3. Record of  During 2015\u20132019, GDP growth averaged 7.1% underpinned by high FDI \ngenerally sound  inflows, strong export performance, and increasing domestic  demand; and \nmacroeconomic  inflation averaged 2.5%. A deficit in the current account had been offset by large \nmanagement  inflows of FDI and other receipts, and the import cover increased from 5.7 \nmonths to 8.8 months. Pre-COVID-19 domestic revenue mobilization improved \nfrom 17.1% of GDP in 2014 to 25.1% of GDP in 2019. Public debt remained low \nat 29.6% of GDP in 2020. Government deposits reached 22% of GDP in 2019.a \n4. Structural  Cambodia is taking credible steps to strengthen its health system, prevent the \nreforms   spread of COVID-19, and manage the socio-economic impacts of the crisis. The \ngovernment rapidly developed its Master Plan for COVID-19 Response in March \n2020, supported by WHO. It has a strong track record of policy reforms, and its \nCOVID-19 response is focused on the poor and vulnerable. In parallel, triggered \nby concerns on the narrow economic base, the government has also begun \nfocusing on diversification into higher value manufacturing including electronics \nassembly and vehicle parts. Tourism revival will get priority attention through \ntargeted tax relief and the wage subsidy program. \n5. Debt  ADB analysis confirms that the CARES Program will not significantly affect the \nsustainability  overall debt ratio. Public debt is expected to increase from 29.6% of GDP to up \nto 39.9% in 2020\u20132021 due to the contracting economy and worsening fiscal \ndeficit. Cambodia is rated as being at low risk of debt distress.  \n6. Coordination  ADB consulted with the IMF on macroeconomic monitoring and the fiscal \nwith the IMF  response to the COVID-19 crisis.

PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n5.  Cambodia\u2019s health system is under prepared for the pandemic. Cambodia has been \nsuccessful in keeping confirmed COVID-19 cases low due to initial containment efforts, but the \ncountry remains highly vulnerable to a surge partly because of the potentially large number of \nasymptomatic carriers among a young population. Pandemic preparedness remains low, despite \nbeing extremely cost-effective.7 The Ministry of Health (MOH) and WHO assess Cambodia\u2019s \ncountry preparedness capacity at less than 60%,8 with critical deficiencies in prevention, and \ndetection and emergency response capacities, particularly at subnational level.9 At the community \n \n7  Sector Assessment (Summary): Health (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n8  WHO. 2020. Country Preparedness and Response Status for COVID-19 as of 11 May 2020 (accessed 15 May 2020). \n9  WHO. 2020. Electronic State Parties Self-Assessment Annual Reporting (accessed 18 April 2020).  ", "3 \nlevel, rapid response teams, which are currently 22% female, require further capacity for case \ndetection and contact tracing, and a better gender balance to more effectively reach women and \nchildren.  Only  two  laboratories  undertake  reliable  molecular  testing  for  COVID-19,  with  a \nmaximum testing capacity of 900 samples a day,10 and the systems for transferring specimens \nfrom  provinces  outside  Phnom  Penh  are  inadequate.  Referral  hospitals  operate  with  bed \noccupancy at 80%\u2013100% and many lack sufficient measures for patient isolation and intensive \ncare.11 Staff require further training in the clinical management of COVID-19, supported by a more \ngender-balanced response in service delivery.  \n \n6.  Heightened risk of infections from migration. Cambodia\u2019s population is highly mobile, \nboth internally and across the region. In 2019, about 2.5 million Cambodians lived abroad, with \nmore than 1.2 million workers going to Thailand. About 70% of these migrant workers are \nclassified as \u201cirregular\u201d, of whom many cross by land on a daily or seasonal basis.12 By end-April \n2020, about 95,000 migrant workers had reentered Cambodia, mainly from Thailand. Despite \nefforts to screen and quarantine returnees with symptoms, the risk of imported cases is high.13 \nInternally, up to 4.1 million people per year migrate; women outnumber men in both rural\u2013urban \nand urban\u2013urban migration, making up 57% of all migrants to Phnom Penh, and many seek \nemployment in garment factories.14 Female migrant workers experience social and economic \nbarriers to accessing health services, increasing the probability of poor health outcomes.15  \n \n7.  Local outbreak to compound pandemic\u2019s social and economic impacts. Before the \npandemic, the economy was projected to grow by 6.8% in 2020. The growth outlook has \ndeteriorated as the scale of the pandemic increased.16 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) \nWorld Economic Outlook forecasts a contraction of 1.6%.17 The economy is now expected to \ncontract by 5.5% in 2020, resulting in an estimated loss of up to $7.3 billion during 2020\u20132021. A \nrise in COVID-19 cases would impose a direct cost through sickness and loss of life, and an \nindirect cost from measures required to control the outbreak.  \n \n8.  Global pandemic impacting Cambodia\u2019s main growth engines including tourism. \nGTF, tourism, and construction accounted for 43.2% of gross domestic product (GDP); for 73.9% \nof goods and services exported, and for 35.5% of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in 2019. \nTourism services are projected to decline by 37.6% but a slower recovery in the second half of \n2020 would lead to a larger contraction. Tourism employs 6.7% of Cambodia\u2019s workforce with \nemployment  concentrated  in  the  food  and  beverage  sector  (53%),  transport  (19.3%)  and \nrecreational activities (13.7%). Workers in these sub-sectors face job losses, reduced working \nhours, and extended unpaid leave.18 GTF output is projected to fall by 13.4%. As of June 2020, \n121 out of 706 GTF factories have temporarily suspended operations, affecting 130,000 workers \n \n10 As of 23 June 2020, Cambodia had tested 1,931 per 1 million people. \n11 Government of Cambodia.

Adverse impacts may intensify in August when the partial withdrawal \nof preferential duty-free access to European Union markets comes into force.19 Rapid growth of \nconstruction has been driven by foreign investment and is vulnerable to changes in investor \nsentiment. Construction growth is projected to slow from 19.9% to 7.7%.   \n \n9.  Economic shock impacting balance of payments. Import growth slowed to 14.4% in \nthe first quarter of 2020, the lowest level since 2018. First-quarter growth in merchandise exports \nslowed to 9.9%, and tourism receipts were hit by the 38.5% reduction in international visitor \narrivals. Further compression of imports is expected, but the decline in tourism receipts and \nslower export growth will widen the current account deficit from 13.4% of GDP to 23.3%. During \n2015\u20132019, Cambodia was able to finance a current account deficit averaging 10.2% of GDP per \nannum through large inflows of foreign capital. This enabled a steady build-up of reserves and \nimport coverage. Approval of new FDI projects slowed in the first quarter of 2020, and capital \ninflows may prove sensitive to changes in investor sentiment linked to COVID-19. The IMF \nassessment letter notes that a larger and more protracted growth slowdown could put pressure \non Cambodia\u2019s fiscal position and balance of payments.20 \n \n10.  Economic shock increasing finance sector risk. Lending by banks and microfinance \ninstitutions grew from 24.6% of GDP in 2009 to 94.7% in 2019. Most loans are denominated in \nUnited States dollars, and banks and microfinance institutions rely on overseas funding. The \nbanking system has been profitable, and non-performing loans averaged a low 2.2% during  \n2015\u20132019, but vulnerabilities remain elevated. Key sources of risk are high credit concentration \nin construction and related property lending, and lack of consolidated cross-border supervision of \nforeign bank branches. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) has moved quickly to ensure \nliquidity and issued guidance on voluntary loan restructuring. As of 29 April, loans with a total \nvalue of $1.6 billion (6% of the total bank loan portfolio) had been restructured.  \n \n11.  COVID-19 resulting in  significant job  losses.  Cambodia  has  low rates  of  official \nunemployment (0.7% overall, 0.8% of women) but a high incidence of informal employment, which \naccounted for 93% of all employment in 2012.21 Informal sector workers lack access to paid or \nsick leave and other formal job protection. A 5.5% contraction of GDP would lead to a loss of \n570,000 jobs, pushing the unemployment rate from 0.7% to 4.4%. Job losses may be particularly \nsevere for workers in microenterprises and SMEs, which account for 98% of all businesses and \nfor 70% of total employment.22 A survey of 284 SMEs after the COVID-19 outbreak found that \n60% were considering mandatory unpaid leave, and 52% were considering retrenchments.23  \n \n12.  Livelihoods of vulnerable workers at risk. Women are overrepresented among low-\nskilled workers and accounted for 61% of workers in manufacturing, trade, and hotels and \nrestaurants in 2016.24 In the health sector, 52% of all workers are female, many holding lower-\nlevel positions (84% of managers are male).25 The crisis will impact young women in particular, \nwho make up more than 80% of the GTF workforce, lack other income sources, and often remit \n \n19 European Commission. 2020.

The crisis will also impact migrant workers \nand remittances from these workers are an important source of household income. The share of \nremittances in the income of the poorest households income increased from 3% in 2009 to 12% \nin 2017.26 Households with returning migrant workers now face a triple burden from reduced \nremittance incomes, insufficient social protection coverage, and increased risk of infection. \n \n13.  Potential reversal of recent gains in poverty reduction. Poverty will increase unless \nnew support mechanisms are established. The income poverty rate fell from 47.8% in 2007 to \n13.5% in 2014 through rapid growth in wage incomes. 27 About 2.4 million Cambodians (14.5% of \nthe population) are currently registered in the Identification of Poor Households Programme \n(IDPoor). Many households are also highly indebted with personal lending expanding by 33% \nyear on year in 2019.28 COVID-19 is likely to exacerbate the vulnerability of the poor given the \nlimited diversification of income sources and poor access to social protection.  \n \n14.  Elevated fiscal pressure as revenues sharply decline. Government revenues are \nprojected to fall by 30.9% in 2020 relative to the pre-COVID-19 budget forecast. To ensure budget \nstability, the government reduced nonessential recurrent and capital expenditures by $918 million \nto $7.3 billion.29 An additional $475 million was allocated to support the COVID-19 response \npackage, raising planned spending to $7.8 billion, 16% higher than 2019 levels.

Second, the planned additional increases in the Capital Conservation Buffer for banks \nwere delayed until 2021.37 Third, it cut the interest rate for liquidity-providing collateralized \noperations, thus decreasing banks\u2019 funding costs in domestic currency and reduced the interest \nrate on Negotiable Certificates of Deposit to encourage banks to disburse loans.38 Finally, the \nNBC issued a directive on  the restructuring of loans  where repayment capacity had been \nimpacted by COVID-19. \n \n36 Cash-for-work program will be financed from government funds and/or by other development partners.  \n37 The capital conservation buffer requires financial institutions build up buffers of equity and retained earnings that can \nbe drawn down in case of losses.   \n38 The NBC established the liquidity-providing collateralized operations facility to set a benchmark rate for local currency \nborrowing for the market.  ", "9 \n  \n19.  Lessons learned. ADB\u2019s long-term engagement in Cambodia highlights the need for in-\ndepth policy dialogue to ensure inclusive and sustainable development.  Key lessons for ADB\u2019s \nCOVID-19 response include: (i) supporting the government to effectively lead the emergency \nresponse and economic recovery program; and (ii) focusing on the core medium- to long-term \ndrivers of Cambodia\u2019s development, including through regional cooperation and integration, \ndespite the  COVID-19 health  shock.39  Cambodia\u2019s  role  in  regional  cooperation to  manage \ntransboundary health risks and rebuild regional value chains is key to its longer-term recovery.40 \nThe CARES Program enables a timely and comprehensive response to stabilize the economy \nbut further ADB support will be instrumental in strengthening the existing systems and institutions, \nimproving governance, and preparing the economy for recovery. \n \nB.  Proposed Program, Impacts and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n20.  The CARES Program will provide budgetary support to address critical health risks and \nmanage the macroeconomic impacts of COVID-19 through the implementation of countercyclical \nmeasures. The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities (OPs) on \naddressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities (OP1), accelerating progress in gender \nequality (OP2), strengthening governance and institutional capacity (OP6), and fostering regional \ncooperation  and  integration  (OP7).  The  impact  of  the  CARES  Program  will  be  that  the \ntransmission of COVID-19 has been controlled and that its adverse health, economic, and social \nimpacts on the population have been mitigated. The outcome will be that the COVID-19 outbreak \nis effectively managed and its immediate adverse social and economic effects are reduced. The \nthree outputs are as follows: (i) health measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 supported; \n(ii) resources dedicated to social assistance disbursed and relief for affected people implemented; \nand (iii) economic stimulus package for adversely impacted sectors delivered. \n  \n21.  ADB value addition. ADB\u2019s long-term engagement with the Government of Cambodia on \npolicy reforms and institutional strengthening is instrumental to the next phase of support for the \nCOVID-19 response. The CARES Program builds on the rapid assistance provided through \nexisting projects and is linked to a robust forward pipeline of investment projects and technical \nassistance (TA). ADB utilized the GMS Health Security Project41 for the emergency procurement \nof temperature-screening equipment at international checkpoints and to finalize the MOH\u2019s \nGender Strategic Plan 2019\u20132023.42 ADB also supported the MOH website, which hosts the daily \nCOVID-19 surveillance report; the \u201c115\u201d phone hotline, which provides counselling and referral \nservices for gender-based violence victims; and a broader mapping of resources for outbreak \nresponse.43 ADB will procure personal protective equipment to fill supply gaps.44 ADB also \nundertook a joint economic analysis with the MEF to model the impact of COVID-19 on public \nfinances and debt, and provided early advisory support on the economic recovery program.  \n \n22.

This project \naligns with the goal of reaching region-wide universal health coverage and strengthening regional \nhealth cooperation. On social protection, ADB will support piloting of digital technologies for \nimproved identification and enrollment of beneficiaries to strengthen the monitoring of service \ndelivery.46 ADB is providing advisory support and capacity development to the National Social \nProtection Secretariat to develop a social budgeting forecasting system. On economic recovery, \nADB\u2019s 2020 program includes loan financed projects to support agribusiness development and \nimprove the efficiency and reliability of power services; and a grant to help revive tourism in \nheritage areas.

ADB will continue to support finance sector development and policy dialogue to \nsupport trade integration and economic competitiveness.  \n \nC.  Development Financing Needs, Budget Support and Debt Sustainability \n \n23.  The government\u2019s financing needs have doubled from $1.7 billion to $3.5 billion.

The government has requested a concessional loan of $250 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, to help finance the pandemic response and countercyclical support expenditure \nneeds. The CARES Program will be funded by $250 million of concessional ordinary capital \nlending comprising $58.7 million from performance-based country allocation, $113.5 million from \nthe  Disaster  Response  Facility,  $30.0  million  from  regional  cooperation  integration,  and  \n$47.8 million from region-wide reprogramming and savings.

The loan is expected to be disbursed in July \n2020 in a single tranche. The loan size is based on Cambodia\u2019s financing needs. \n \n25.  Debt sustainability. ADB\u2019s assessment concluded that public debt in Cambodia will stay \nmoderately low in the medium term.48 The additional debt of $250 million under the proposed \nCARES Program represents 3.2% of outstanding public debt stock and 0.9% of 2019 GDP and \nwill not significantly affect the overall debt ratio nor the annual debt service obligations. Worsening \nfiscal deficits are expected to drive the total external debt ratio up to 39.9% of GDP in 2020\u20132021, \nwhich is assessed as moderate and not at risk to sustainability.49 The most recent IMF\u2013World \nBank Debt Sustainability Assessment also found that Cambodia is at low risk of debt distress.50 \n \nD.  Development Partner Coordination \n \n26.  The government has played an active role in coordinating development partner support \nthrough the Master Plan for COVID-19 Response and the four working groups (Box 2).51 For \nhealth, the WHO provides coordination and procurement support. The World Bank is supporting \nhealth infrastructure and the provision of medical equipment. United Nations agencies and \nbilateral donors support capacity building and the procurement of supplies. Several partners are \nsupporting the implementation of the cash subsidy scheme. ADB, as co-chair of the development \npartners group, led coordination on behalf of the group with the MEF on the COVID-19 committee \ntasked with the preparation of budget, financing, and social assistance policy. In addition, ADB \ncoordinated with the IMF to obtain its assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on the public \nfinances and debt sustainability.52 The MEF has requested other development partners to draw \non ADB\u2019s in depth assessments for the CARES Program for their own programs. At the request \nof  the  government,  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  and  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency indicated interest in cofinancing and alignment with the CARES Program. \nThe World Bank is also planning to provide budget support to the government for $150 million. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n27.  The MEF will be the executing agency for the CARES Program. To support effective \nimplementation and longer-term recovery, a country engagement framework was established \nbetween ADB and the government.53 The framework includes a policy committee responsible for \nquarterly reporting on the progress of the government\u2019s countercyclical and health response, \nincluding progress made against the gender monitoring matrix targets and the periodic collection \nof sex-disaggregated data on program beneficiaries. Three sub-committees will facilitate the \nengagement with the private sector, civil society organizations, and entities that focus on big data \nanalytics to drive innovative approaches based on the latest available data.54 ADB will provide TA \nsupport  to  help  with  program  implementation  and  monitoring  (footnote  45).  The  program \nimplementation period is July 2020\u2013June 2021. The proceeds of the loan will be withdrawn in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n48 Debt Sustainability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n49 This reflects a scenario in which the deficit is fully financed with new borrowing, rather through a combination of new \nborrowing, and drawdown of existing reserves. \n50 IMF. 2019.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \n28.  Governance.  The  2015  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  indicators \nshowed an improvement in aggregate fiscal discipline, and monitoring and reporting of budget \nexecution.55 Some slippage was noted in indicators related to resource allocation and delayed in-\nyear budget execution reports. There is also substantial inherent financial management risk. \nHowever, ADB\u2019s sector work underpins investments in improving PFM systems. ADB support to \nPFM reforms has been closely aligned to the government\u2019s multistage approach under the four-\nstage Public Financial Management Reform Program 2004\u20132025.56 Notable achievements are: \n(i) strong performance in revenue mobilization; (ii) implementation of a financial management \ninformation  system;  and  (iii)  introduction  of  program  budgeting  across  government.  During  \n2018\u20132019 the government adopted strategies between 2018 and 2019 strengthen planning, \nbudgeting investment management, procurement, and revenue mobilization.57 ADB is supporting \nimproved  operational  efficiency,  adoption  of  integrated  financial  management  systems, \nstrengthening of budgeting and tracking of resources, and better debt management.  \n \n29.  Poverty and social. Cambodia\u2019s gains in poverty reduction are now at risk of a setback \nbecause of COVID-19. The poor are more vulnerable to public health risks, and COVID-19 will \nhave a significant impact on labor market outcomes. It is estimated that 205,000 poor and \nvulnerable workers could fall below the extreme poverty line due to COVID-19, while more than \n1.1 million currently living just above the poverty line are susceptible to falling into moderate \npoverty.58 Household expenditures to meet healthcare needs may lead to further impoverishment. \nThe CARES Program is therefore pivotal in ensuring that the government can meet its critical \nsocial expenditures to safeguard the gains made in reducing poverty and inequality.   \n \n30.  Gender. The CARES Program is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming.  COVID-\n19 is increasing women\u2019s vulnerability to domestic and gender-based violence, lost income, \ninfection, social exclusion because of mobility restrictions, loss of employment, and increased \nfamily care roles. The government\u2019s information, education, and communication materials are \ndelivering gender-sensitive messages on transmission prevention, personal hygiene, and support \nfor people experiencing gender-based violence. The CARES Program supports women\u2019s welfare \nthrough four key channels. First, COVID-19 testing targets high-risk groups such as garment \nworkers (of whom 80% are female) and health care workers (of whom 52% are female). Second, \nthe government will expand the IDPoor program to deliver cash subsidies to more than 2.4 million \npoor and vulnerable people, of which 50% are women, while maintaining existing cash transfers \nfor pregnant women and infants through the first 2 years of life. Third, the government will offer \nwage subsidies to workers in the hardest hit sectors of the economy, including GTF. Finally, the \ngovernment also offered tax exemptions and favorable loan conditions to support struggling \nbusinesses including SMEs, of which 26% are owned by women. \n \n31.  Safeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis classified category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people. The \nprogram is not expected to have any environmental or social safeguards impacts within the \nmeaning of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n55 Government of Cambodia. 2015.

Adverse Impact  Cambodia faces severe impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. While initial health impacts have been limited, its weak health \nof Exogenous  systems would easily be overwhelmed by a surge in cases. Cambodia is highly exposed to negative economic impacts from \nShocks  the pandemic due to its (i) high degree of openness; (ii) narrow economic base; (iii) highly leveraged and dollarized financial \nsector; and (iv) large current account deficit.  \n \nImpact on production, employment, and welfare. The COVID-19 pandemic is already having a large negative impact on \nthe economy. The immediate impacts on the real economy are concentrated in three key sectors: (i) leisure and tourism related \nservices; (ii) GTF; and (iii) construction and real estate. These sectors accounted for almost half of GDP, three quarters of \nexports, and two thirds of GDP growth in 2019.  Services related to leisure and tourism have been impacted by the sharp \ndecline in international visitor arrivals, government policies to promote social distancing, and reduced domestic demand. GTF \nare primarily exported to advanced economies. Production was initially interrupted by shortages of raw materials from the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. These bottlenecks have been resolved but the sector is now being hit by a collapse in export \ndemand. Construction activity has boomed in recent years. Most major construction projects are financed by FDI inflows and \nmany property developments are marketed to non-resident buyers. Bank lending for construction and real estate activity has \nalso grown rapidly, rising from 10.8% of GDP in 2011 to 35.4% of GDP in 2019. Construction activity has been concentrated \nin Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, and market analysis shows that the supply of retail, office, and high-end residential \naccommodation is set to increase significantly in 2020 as ongoing projects are completed. The construction and real estate \nsector is exposed to changes in investor sentiment related to the pandemic and the downturn in global growth. A sharp \ndownturn in the local property markets may have impact on growth and put pressure on banks that have lent to the sector.  \n \nThe direct impact of the pandemic on GTF, tourism, and construction and real estate will spill over to the rest of the economy. \nPrior to COVID-19, the economy was expected to grow by 6.8% in 2020 and 6.7% in 2021. Independent growth forecasts for \n2020\u20132021 were published by ADB, the World Bank, and IMF during March\u2013April 2020 at a time when the global impacts of \nthe pandemic were still emerging. The World Bank initially projected growth of 2.5% in 2020, followed by 5.9% in 2021. In April, \nADB forecast growth of 2.3% in 2020 and 5.7% in 2021. The IMF projected a contraction of 1.6% in 2020 and growth of 6.1% \nin 2021. The global outlook has continued to deteriorate since the IMF\u2019s forecasts were published and the prospect of a very \nrapid recovery in the second half of 2020 has faded.  \n \nADB staff undertook a joint modelling exercise with Cambodia\u2019s Ministry of Economy and Finance to assess the likely \nmacroeconomic impacts of the pandemic. This exercise highlighted the extent of the downside risks to Cambodia\u2019s growth \noutlook due to COVID-19. Under the revised growth projection in ADB\u2019s Asian Development Outlook Supplement (June 2020), \nthe economy is now projected to contract by 5.5% in 2020 before rebounding with growth of 5.9% in 2021. The 2020 projection \nis based on 37.6% (year-on-year) decline in tourism related activities, a 13.4% (year-on-year) decline in GTF production, and \na slowdown in construction and real estate growth to 7.7% (year-on-year).  \n \nThe pandemic will impact on sectors where formal employment is prevalent, such as GTF, and sectors where informality is \nmore common such as construction, trade, hotels, and restaurants. Employment impacts were estimated by applying sector \npoint elasticities for employment with respect to GDP to the projected GDP growth rate. This analysis showed that a contraction ", "Appendix 4  21 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nin GDP of 5.5% could lead to 570,000 job losses in 2020 of which 345,000 people would become unemployed raising the \nunemployment rate from 0.7% in 2019 to 4.4% in 2020 and 225,000 people would move to less productive jobs. An additional \n25,000 workers, or 5%, would drop out of the labor force altogether, while up to 200,000 or approximately 35% would shift to \nlower productivity, lower pay sectors, mainly in agriculture, but also in wholesale and retail trade and other sectors. This would \nresult in an increase in the working poverty rate, or proportion of the employed whose employment-related incomes are not \nsufficient to lift them and their families out of poverty.  \n \nThe impact of COVID-19 on employment and remittances could reverse recent gains in poverty reduction.  The national poverty \nrate decreased from 47.8% in 2007 to 13.5% in 2014. Updated poverty estimates using more recent data are yet to be \npublished, but a projection of past trends suggests that headcount poverty rates continued to fall during 2015\u20132019. An initial \nestimate using data on working poverty found that with an economic contraction of 5.5% of GDP in 2020, 1.1 million people \nwould fall into moderate poverty and 205,000 workers could fall into extreme poverty.a Overall, the impact of the pandemic \nwould be an increase in the estimated share of workers in extreme and moderate poverty in 2020 from an estimated 28% \nunder the baseline scenario, to 44%, reversing important achievements in terms of poverty reduction over the past decade. \n \nFiscal impacts. COVID-19 is expected to lead to a large decline in domestic revenue collection as result of reductions in the \ntax base, reduced corporate and personal income, reduced imports, and lower consumption of luxury goods.  Domestic \nrevenues were forecast by considering recent revenue performance and information from taxpayer filings during Q1 2020. \nUnder the updated baseline scenario, domestic revenues are projected to decline by 30.9% (year-on-year) in 2020 pushing \nthe overall fiscal balance to -12.8% of GDP (including grants) compared to a pre-COVID-19 forecast of -5.9% of GDP.   \n \nMoney and banking. Cambodia has a high level of de-facto dollarization. The USD-KHR exchange rate has remained stable \nduring 2020 but a large share of banking deposits and lending is USD denominated. Lending by banks and microfinance \ninstitutions has grown rapidly in recent years, with total private sector credit rising from 24.6% of GDP in 2009 to 95.3% in \n2019. Most commercial banks are foreign branches or subsidiaries. The banking system has been profitable and has \nmaintained low levels of non-performing loans. However, the most recent IMF Article IV assessment noted that vulnerabilities \nremain elevated.  Key sources of risk include high credit concentration, related party lending risks, lack of consolidated cross-\nborder supervision for foreign banks, and risks related to unregulated lending by real estate developers. Low liquidity is also \nan important source of risk with financial institutions, which continue to draw on funding from abroad, including from parent \nbanks and financial institutions with development purposes such as MFIs. \n \nThe impact of COVID-19 on the real sector will make it harder for some private borrowers to service their loans. The NBC \nissued guidance to banks and microfinance institutions on 27 March to enable voluntary loan restructuring. In the first 4 weeks \nafter this guidance was issued, 18,000 loans, totaling approximately $1.6 billion, or 6% of all bank lending were restructured. \nVoluntary restructuring of loans will help to avoid a sudden spike in non-performing loans and impairment of bank and MFI\u2019s \nloan assets and balance sheets. However, given the reliance on external wholesale financing, some banks and MFIs may face \na mismatch between the time profile of their assets and liabilities. Dollarization limits the ability of NBC to serve as a lender of \nlast resort by providing liquidity to banks and MFIs. \n \n ", "22  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nBalance of payments. Cambodia has a long-standing current account deficit due to imbalances in merchandise trade and \nremittances of profits that are not fully covered by tourism receipts, and other service credits. The current account deficit \naveraged 10.2% of GDP during 2015\u20132019.  Cambodia has been able to fund this deficit through large capital inflows that \nenabled a build up of international reserves from 5.7 months of import cover in 2015 to 8.8 months in 2019. COVID-19 will lead \nto a widening of the current account deficit and may put pressure on the balance of payments.  \n \nPrior to COVID-19, the current account balance was projected at -13.6% of GDP in 2020 and 13.4% of GDP 2021. While some \ncompression of imports is expected due to COVID-19, this will be outweighed by the reduction in merchandise exports, tourism \nreceipts, and remittances. The most recent projection from the IMF is for the current account deficit to widen to -22.2% of GDP \nin 2020, before recovering modestly to -17.6% in 2021. The updated baseline scenario prepared by ADB projects a current \naccount balance of -23.3% of GDP in 2020 and 17.9% in 2021.  \n \nCambodia has seen large increases in FDI and other financing flows since 2018. FDI and other financing inflows are expected \nto remain strong during 2020\u20132021 as implementation of approved FDI projects moves forward thus cushioning the impact of \nthe deterioration of the current account. The IMF\u2019s latest forecast is for official reserves and import cover to decline slightly, to \nthe equivalent of 8 months of import cover. However, there is a clear risk of a sharper slowdown in capital inflows due to slower \nimplementation of ongoing FDI projects, reduced approval of new projects and shifts in investor sentiment. Such a slowdown \nwould put pressure on reserves and could ultimately force much more severe import compression. \n \nHealth impact. As of 23 June 2020, Cambodia has reported 130 cases (90 men, 39 women, 1 unknown) of COVID-19 (127 \nrecovered and 3 cases undergoing treatment) and no deaths. However, there is a high likelihood that current confirmed cases \nunder-report the true incidence of infections.  As of 23 June 2020, Cambodia has only tested approximately 32,281 specimens, \nequating approximately 0.2% of the population, or 1,931 tests per 1 million people. Only two laboratories in the country are \ncapable of undertaking molecular testing for COVID-19, with a maximum testing capacity of 900 samples a day. At a time when \ncountries globally are ramping up their testing capabilities, Cambodia did not report a single new case between 12 April and \n20 May 2020, suggesting daily testing numbers have not been sufficiently increasing. In Cambodia, the Pasteur Institute \nadvises that while there is no \u2018gold standard\u2019 for testing, increasing testing capacity at provincial level and rural areas, \nexpanding epidemiological criteria, carrying out more contact tracing, and targeting vulnerable populations like migrant workers \nand women would better ensure the timely detection and containment of COVID-19. Only 22% of individuals in rapid response \nteams are women, which may make detecting COVID-19 among women and children more challenging.  \n \nThe MOH and WHO have warned that Cambodia faces high likelihood of a second outbreak and would not be able to cope \nwith surges and subsequent mortality. Deficiencies in prevention, detection, and response capacity, particularly at the \nsubnational level, undermine the country\u2019s operational readiness to counter COVID-19. In terms of preparedness for outbreaks, \nCambodia is currently classified as \u2018level 3\u2019 (of 5) ready, signifying that they are less than 60% prepared.  National capacity for \nhealth emergency coordination is hampered by weak provincial mechanisms for incident management and emergency \noperations \u2013 most referral hospitals do not have triage departments. At community-level, awareness of COVID-19 is low and \nhealthcare  workers,  particularly  women,  require  training  in  clinical  management.  Inadequate  systems  for  transferring \nspecimens to national COVID-19 testing laboratories exacerbate the limitations in the country\u2019s diagnostic capabilities.  Women ", "Appendix 4  23 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nhold lower-level roles in the healthcare sector, with 84% of managers being men, which decreases the ability to provide gender-\nbalanced service delivery. \n2. Countercyclical  Summary. The government has formulated a comprehensive pandemic response master plan. The health response is \nDevelopment  presented in a detailed and fully costed Master Plan for COVID-19 Response that was prepared with support from the WHO. \nExpenditures   Four high-level working groups have been established to coordinate measures to minimize socio-economic impacts. The \ngovernment has prepared a strong countercyclical support program of $815.7 million comprising: new expenditures on \nhealthcare for $60.0 million, social protection of $300.0 million, and economic measures including $150.0 million for loans to \nSMEs, $44.5 million for wage subsidies and $97.6 million for tax relief for businesses in the sectors that have been most \nimpacted by COVID-19.  \n \nHealth response. The initial budget for COVID-19 health response has been set at $60.0 million. The budget will support \nimplementation of the Master Plan for COVID-19 Response, prioritizing spending on medical equipment, health facilities, and \nincentives for health workers.  \n \nSocial transfer payments. $300 million is budgeted for the cash subsidy scheme to poor and vulnerable households. The \ngovernment\u2019s IDPoor registry is being used as the foundation for this program. IDPoor was established in 2011 as a mechanism \nfor identifying poor and vulnerable households. Around 14.5% of all households are currently enrolled in the registry. The \nprogram uses village-level enrollment based on a multi-dimensional poverty measure. Households that are evaluated as \n\u2018extremely poor\u2019 are classified as IDPoor 1, while households evaluated as \u2018poor\u2019 are classified as IDPoor 2. Most households \nin the program are in rural areas. The program registration also identifies vulnerable household members including persons \nwith disabilities, young children, and pensioners. Cash transfers will be paid to households that are already registered in IDPoor, \nand registration will be expanded to cover households and individuals who are experiencing economic distress due to COVID-\n19.  \n \nWage subsidies. The government announced partial wage subsidies for furloughed workers in the tourism and GTF industries \nfor up to 4 months. In tourism, 50,451 workers employed by hotels, restaurants, and travel agencies will receive $40 per month \nwith additional contributions from employers. An estimated 506,082 workers in GTF companies will receive $40 from the \ngovernment and $30 from employers. \n  \nSME financing. The government has budgeted $100 million from the national budget to a newly established \u2018SME Bank\u2019. This \nstate-owned bank is expected to work with existing BFIs to enhance SME access to credit. The SME bank was established as \nof January 2020 and could become a conduit for on-lending of government funds to private BFIs. The government has also \nannounced an additional $50 million transfer to the state-owned Rural and Agricultural Development Bank that would support \nlending to agribusiness firms that have been impacted by COVID-19.  \n \nTax relief. The government has announced temporary tax exemptions for businesses in the manufacturing, tourism, and \naviation sector to support businesses that have been affected by the slowdown in visitor arrivals and physical distancing \npolicies. Garment factories are also tax exempt until December 2020. Hotels, guesthouses, and restaurants across 7 provinces \nkey to tourism are exempt from all monthly taxes for up to 6 months. All airlines registered in Cambodia are also exempt from \n ", "24  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \ntax payments until July 2020. Manufacturers that have suspended operations are not required to pay their National Social \nSecurity Fund contributions.  \n3. Pre-shock  A strong track-record.  The IMF assessment letter provides at pre-shock outlook with growth projected at 6.8% for 2020, \nRecord of  supported by strong external demand and continued high levels of foreign investment. Overall, Cambodia has a strong pre-\nGenerally Sound  shock record of sound macroeconomic management. The 2019 Article IV Staff Report (IMF Country Report No.19/387) also \nMacroeconomic  noted ongoing progress toward development goals, including strong progress made on revenue mobilization and prudent fiscal \nManagement   management. The assessment did note that the external position is weakened by risks from rapid credit growth, especially in \nthe real estate sector.  \n \nGrowth and inflation. Cambodia was one of the fastest growing countries in the world over the past two decades, growing by \nan average of 8.0% per annum during 1999-2019. The economy grew by an average of 7.1% per annum during 2015\u20132019, \nand inflation averaged 2.5%. Growth has been supported by high levels of FDI, strong export performance, and rising domestic \nconsumption. Growth has been inclusive and has produced large reductions in poverty, which fell from 50.2% in 2003, to 13.5% \nin 2014 the last year for which official statistics are available. Price stability has been aided by relatively high levels of de-facto \ndollarization.  Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy was projected to grow at an average rate of 6.8% per annum \nduring 2020\u20132021. \n \nBalance of payments. Cambodia has an open economy and has steadily increased its integration into the international \neconomy through trade, investment, and migration. Merchandise exports have grown rapidly and increased by an average of \n12.6% per annum during 2015-2019. However, these exports remain relatively concentrated in a few product categories\u2014 \nespecially GTF\u2014and destination markets. Overall trade volumes are large relative to GDP, and Cambodia has had a persistent \ndeficit in merchandise trade that has only been partially offset by a surplus in services trade. The merchandise trade deficit \nhas been the key driver in the overall current account position, with the deficit averaging 10.2% of GDP during 2015\u20132019. \nThe strong performance in the financial account has enabled Cambodia to build up its foreign exchange reserves since 2015, \nwith import cover increasing from 5.7 months in 2015 to 8.8 months in 2019.  \n \nFiscal policy. Cambodia\u2019s fiscal management has been sound, with an overarching PFM reform strategy helping to improve \nbudget formulation and execution, and a more focused domestic resource mobilization strategy contributing to a rapid increase \nin  domestic  revenue  collection.  Cambodia\u2019s  tax  administration  was  strengthened  under  the  Medium-Term  Revenue \nMobilization Strategy 2014\u20132018 with focused efforts on broadening tax base and improving tax administration. The Revenue \nMobilization Strategy 2019\u20132023 outlines further measures to strengthen revenue collection including the review of tax policies. \nDomestic revenue mobilization has improved significantly, with government revenues rising from 19.6% of GDP in 2015 to an \nestimated 25.9% of GDP in 2019. This has enabled the government to strengthen its provision of public goods while ensuring \nbudget sustainability. Net borrowing averaged 1.5% of GDP during 2015\u20132019, compared to 3.5% of GDP during 2010\u20132014. \nIn fact, domestic revenue collection repeatedly surpassed budget forecasts, and the government opted to save these additional \nrevenues rather than approve supplementary appropriations. As a result, government deposits at the central bank increased \nfrom $1.1 billion (6.8 % of GDP) in December 2014, to $5.92 billion (22.0% of GDP) in December 2019.  \n ", "Appendix 4  25 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nDebt management. Cambodia has been prudent in its management of sovereign debt. Government borrowing is limited to \nconcessional loans from bilateral and multilateral lenders. Public borrowing is transparent with information published online \nregularly in a public debt bulletin. Debt management is reasonably strong, and the government has committed to making further \nimprovements under its Debt Management Strategy, 2019\u20132023. Public debt is low and stood at 29.6% of GDP in 2019, \ncompared to an average of 29.8% of GDP during 2015\u20132019 and 30.7% of GDP during 2010\u20132014.  \n \nMonetary policy and financial sector regulation. Cambodia\u2019s monetary policy aims to maintain price stability. The NBC \ngovernor chairs the Monetary Policy Committee and this committee meets at least 4 times per year to review policy settings. \nCambodia has maintained stable prices and the exchange rate between USD and KHR has remained within a narrow band. \nHowever, the scope for independent monetary and exchange rate policies remains limited due to the high levels of de-facto \ndollarization. The financial sector has grown significantly and has attracted a growing share of new FDI inflows. Facilitating \nregulation has been accompanied by progressive strengthening of bank supervision and oversight.  \n4. Structural  Health. The government has implemented a comprehensive response to control the spread of COVID-19.  The MOH has \nReforms  based their Master Plan for COVID-19 Response on WHO\u2019s Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, and effectively \ncoordinates with health partners to work together and mobilize resources. Cambodia\u2019s costed action plan for health requires \nan indicative necessary budget of $60.0 million, which may increase to $100.0 million (of which 40% will be financed from \nexternal sources). Health responses are categorized into three categories of needs (prevention and detection, clinical \nmanagement and treatment, and coordinating and supporting measures), under community transmission scenario. For \nprevention and detection, the government has allocated approximately $4.7 million for rapid response teams. The MOH has \nassigned and deployed 2,118 trained rapid response team members at below-district level across Cambodia\u2019s 25 provinces, \nfor surveillance, support for testing and laboratories, contact tracing, and specimen transfer. The MOH has temporarily \ndeployed 250 quarantine officials and thermal imaging cameras at border posts and international airports; formed quarantine \nteams composed of representatives from the MOH, the MOL, local authorities, and police and military, who, along with 90,000 \nworkers, are tasked to monitor movement and health of people (both male migrant workers and female spouses who tend to \nmigrate with them).b Public information through phone messages, social media, press briefings, and basic hygiene education \nhas been rapid and widespread. Under clinical management and treatment ($45.4 million), major equipment including 25 \nventilators, 75 patient monitors, 10 thermal imaging cameras, and 100,000 personal protective equipment sets have been \nprocured, including three million masks for garment workers and returned migrants. Minor refurbishments required for isolation \nand treatment centers have started,c and training for clinical management has begun. Coordination and support systems ($9.8 \nmillion) actions include establishment of emergency operation centers in all 25 provinces, incentives for health staff, and \nprovision of food and basic supplies for patients. The MOH has procured an additional 3 million masks for garment workers \n(the majority of whom are women) and returned migrants, recognizing their vulnerabilities. To date, government covers all \ncosts for COVID-19 at health facilities or provides services free of charge elsewhere. \n \nSocial protection. The government is leveraging existing registries and mobile payments technology to rapidly implement a \nnew cash subsidy scheme program to support households that were experiencing food and non-food poverty even before \nCOVID-19 and households and individuals that have been pushed into poverty by COVID-19. The IDPoor registry provides \nthe foundation for the new cash subsidy scheme. This registry includes approximately 14.5% of all households. Payments to \nthese households will be scaled according to household need and cost of living. \n ", "26  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nHouseholds in the IDPoor program receive an Equity Access Card, which enables them to access a variety of programs and \nservices. However, until now no routine cash payments have been linked to the IDPoor database. The government now plans \nto implement a rapid two-phase program to roll out cash subsidies. In phase 1, existing IDPoor 1 and IDPoor 2 households will \nbe invited to register for cash benefits at their local commune. Details from the households Equity Access Card will be \nregistered enabling them to access monthly payments. Phase 2 would involve enrolling new individuals and households onto \nIDPoor through roll-out of a new \u2018On Demand IDPoor program\u2019. This would include urban households.  The government \nestimates that 4\u20136 weeks will be needed to prepare for the launch of phase 1, and that implementation of phase 2 could \ncommence in June 2020 if systems development and recruitment and training of enumerators begin immediately. The overall \nbudget for cash subsidy scheme has been set at $300 million for 2020. Payments will be disbursed through the Wing mobile \nbanking and money transfer platform, which have very broad coverage. \n \nThe government announced partial wage subsidies for furloughed workers in the tourism and GTF industries for up to 4 months. \nIn tourism, 50,451 workers employed by hotels, restaurants, and travel agencies will receive $40 per month with additional \ncontributions from employers. An estimated 506,082 workers in GTF companies will receive $40 from the government and $30 \nfrom employers.  \n \nPublic financial management. The government has put in place a long-term and comprehensive PFMRP which commenced \nin 2005 and has a 4-platform approach with sequenced long-term reforms.  Stage 1 of PFMRP (2005\u20132008) focused on \nenhancing credibility of the budget.  Budget credibility was substantially achieved by 2008 and has been broadly maintained \nsince  then,  through  improvements  in  revenue  mobilization,  public  debt  management,  and  cash  and  bank  account \nmanagement\u2014all of which have been supportive of conservative fiscal policies and aggregate fiscal discipline at most times. \nThis fiscal discipline has underpinned longer term macro-economic stability and high.   \n \nStage 2 of the PFMRP (2009\u20132015) focused on more effective financial accountability, internal controls, and payments system \nfor improved accountability within the PFM system.  Important progress included: (i) design of budget classifications and chart \nof accounts; (ii) development of three-year rolling budget strategic plans and establishing annual program budgeting; (iii) early \nstages of procurement reform; and (iv) strengthening of internal controls and internal audit units.   \nThe current stage of the reform, Stage 3 (2016\u20132020), focuses on improving budget and policy linkages. Key activities under \nstage 3 include further institutionalization of program budgeting, budget integration and unification, and development of new \nbusiness processes and organizational arrangements to support FMIS reforms.  In addition, reforms to establish medium term \nforecasting is underway to link the medium-term fiscal framework and medium-term budget framework as well as further efforts \nto strengthen budget transparency. Successful implementation of stage 3 is integral to strengthening fiscal discipline and \nimproved budget, accounting, and financial management systems to be complemented by more strategic resource allocation \nand greater scope to raise operational efficiency. Further rollout of the FMIS will provide a systematic base for improving the \nquality and integrity of the budget, thereby raising the scope for improved public service delivery. Stage 4 (2020\u20132025) for \nestablishing performance accountability will be the final stage under the long-term framework for reform and will focus on \nimproved performance accountability. Stage 4 will also further strengthen the earlier three stages whereby long-term systems \nand human capacity development initiatives will continue to be pursued. \n ", "Appendix 4  27 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nTrade integration, economic competitiveness, and financial sector development. Cambodia\u2019s development strategy aims \nto maintain high growth through structural transformation and sustained productivity improvement. The government has made \ngood progress in strengthening its overall planning framework and has shown readiness to undertake ambitious reforms. The \nIDP,  2016\u20132025  provides  an  overall  framework  for  reform  and  sets  ambitious  targets  for  growth  of  manufacturing, \ndiversification of manufacturing output and exports, and increased integration of SMEs into manufacturing value chains. The \nIDP  acknowledges  key  challenges  including  Cambodia\u2019s  narrow  industrial  base,  high  level  of  informality,  weak \nentrepreneurship, and low value addition and use of technology. It identifies five key pillars to achieving the overall vision:  \n(i) improvement of policy, regulation and facilitation; (ii) improvement of technical knowledge and skills base; (iii) upgrading of \ninfrastructure and logistics capabilities; (iv) financial sector deepening; and (v) improved labor market regulation. The \ngovernment is currently undertaking a mid-term review of the IDP and is likely to update it to reflect the changing context due \nto COVID-19. The IDP is complemented by sector-level planning for upgrading of infrastructure and improvement of human \ncapital. New plans in key areas such as the power sector, secondary education, and post-secondary technical and vocational \neducation and training are being prepared with ADB support.  \n \nCambodia\u2019s Trade Integration Strategy, 2019\u20132023 provides a strong framework for continued integration into international \nmarkets. The strategy anticipates the likely loss of trade preferences as Cambodia approaches graduation from LDC status \nand has a detailed work plan and action matrix to strengthen trade integration through bilateral and multilateral trade \nagreements. The strategy also includes a detailed domestic reform agenda to improve trade facilitation and upgrade relevant \nvalue chains.  \n \nCambodia has also made good progress in developing its financial sector. ADB has supported a comprehensive program to \nexpand access to credit, improve financial inclusion and banking regulation, and deepen capital markets. This has included \nrestructuring of the state-owned Agricultural and Rural Development Bank, strengthening of the national credit bureau, \napproval of legislation to enable electronic commerce, strengthening consumer protection, and facilitating the development of \ninvestment vehicles. The financial sector continues to be dominated by banking and microfinance, but there has also been \nprogress in developing capital markets, with public offerings of equity in a handful of local firms and the first issuances of local \ncurrency denominated corporate bonds. The next phase of reforms to strengthen the financial sector includes plans for a \nnational deposit protection scheme, further strengthening of banking sector regulation and oversight and development of a \nsovereign bond market.  On the latter, government has expedited its plans for issuing sovereign debt to expand its options for \ndomestic financing from 2021\u20132023 to 2020\u20132021.  \n5. Debt  Cambodia is rated as being at low risk of debt distress. Cambodia\u2019s public debt is moderately low and the outlook is stable \n Sustainability   over the medium term. Fiscal policy in Cambodia was prudent before the crisis, keeping budget deficits in check. Higher \nexpenditure and a plunge in revenues are now expected to sharply widen fiscal deficits. ADB staff\u2019s debt analysis concluded \nthat the public debt is low and stood at 29.6% of GDP in 2019. The contracting economy and worsening fiscal deficit in 2020 \nare expected to drive the debt ratio  up to 39.9% of GDP in 2020\u20132021 on average, from below 30% in 2019.  The proposed \nADB loan of $250 million, on broadly concessional terms, represents just 3.2% percent of Cambodia\u2019s outstanding public debt \nstock of nearly $7.6 billion. The most recent World Bank\u2013IMF debt sustainability assessment was prepared in December 2019. \nUnder this assessment, Cambodia was rated as having strong debt carrying capacity with a maximum threshold for the present \nvalue of debt of 55.0% of GDP compared to an actual value of 22.5% in 2019. Borrowing costs are low, and there is limited \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nexposure to rollover and interest-rate risk. Apart from rising fiscal deficits, some vulnerabilities arise out of contingent liabilities \nfrom public-private partnership projects. \n \nThe CPRO financing of $250 million is equivalent to 0.94% of 2019 GDP. ADB\u2019s debt sustainability assessment highlighted \nthat the CPRO can provide critical countercyclical support but will not significantly affect the overall debt ratio nor the annual \ndebt service. It will be provided within an overall fiscal framework that ensures debt sustainability. Cambodia is planning to \ndevelop its domestic bond market with a tentative timeline for 2021 launch. In time, issuance of domestic bonds will provide \nanother financing source. Additional borrowing under the CPRO will have a minimal impact on the overall debt-to-GDP ratio, \nand Cambodia is expected to remain at low risk of debt distress. \n6. Coordination  The ADB team has consulted and coordinated closely with the IMF on Cambodia\u2019s macroeconomic situation and forward-\nwith the IMF   looking forecasts. The IMF mission confirmed sound macroeconomic management, and fiscal and debt position of Cambodia \npre-crisis, and endorsed the proposed countercyclical support expenditure program. The letter dated 6 May 2020 concludes \nthat expected growth in 2020 is at -1.6%, but downside risks to the outlook are substantial. This is driven largely by external \nfactors: tourism has collapsed; orders for garments from foreign buyers have been cancelled; and large numbers of migrant \nworkers have returned home with a consequent downturn in remittances. If COVID-19 containment measures continue, in \nCambodia or abroad, disruptions to exports, remittances, and inward investment would result in a larger and more protracted \ngrowth slowdown, putting increased pressure on Cambodia\u2019s fiscal position and balance of payments. This may be further \nexacerbated by tighter dollar liquidity and declining prices in the real estate sector. The IMF assessment letter also indicated \nthat with the larger fiscal deficit under the revised IMF growth projection, external debt would increase to 31.0% of GDP in \n 2020 from 29.6% in end-2019 under the assumption that all fiscal financing needs are met by issuing external debt. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, BFI = Bank and Financial Institutions, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPRO = COVID-19 pandemic response option,  \nFDI = foreign directed investment, FMIS = Financial Management and Information System, GDP = gross domestic product, GTF = garments, textiles and footwear, \nIDP = Industrial Development Policy, IDPoor =  Identification of Poor Households Programme, IMF = International Monetary Fund, KHR = Khmer Riel, LDC = less \ndeveloped country, MFI = microfinance institutions, MOH = Ministry of Health, MOL = Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training, NBC = National Bank of Cambodia, \nPFM = public finance management, PFMRP = public finance management reform program, SME = small- and medium-sized enterprises, USD = United States \nDollar, WHO = World Health Organization. \na  Given the lack of recent poverty data, this analysis uses the International Labor Organization\u2019s working poverty estimates as a proxy to examine the likely impact \nof COVID-19 on poverty in Cambodia. \nb  International Organization for Migration. 2019.
