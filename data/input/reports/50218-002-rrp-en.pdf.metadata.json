This challenge is exacerbated by \ndifficulties in bringing public services to the poor and vulnerable. In 2015, 32% of the population \nlived  below  the  poverty  line  and  another  14%  was  classified  \u201cnear  poor.\u201d 1  The  significant \nremaining subnational disparity is also daunting. Much of the country\u2019s rural population has limited \naccess  to  basic  services  or  markets,  so  an  improved  rural  road  network  will  help  promote \neconomic  and  social  inclusion  nationwide  and  in  remote  areas  by  enhancing  job  opportunities \nand incomes for disadvantaged and marginalized groups. \n  \n4. \nLowest rural road access in Asia. 40% of Myanmar\u2019s rural population  live in villages \nwithout access to all-season roads. Asian Development Bank (ADB) studies on rural access in \nMyanmar  have  found  that  4  million  people live  in  the  8,200 villages  that  are  not  connected  by \nroad. 2 Another 20,000 villages with an estimated 10 million people are connected by roads that \nare  not  passable  during  the  rainy  season.  Myanmar\u2019s  rural  access  problem  is  severe  by \ninternational standards, with the Rural Access Index (RAI) estimated at 36%\u2014the lowest in Asia. 3 \nThis lack of access constrains mobility and job opportunities during a large part of the year. The \nproject is located in the Ayeyarwady and Magway regions, which have low levels of access and \nare more vulnerable to disasters triggered by natural hazards. \n \n5. \nUpgrading rural roads. Myanmar needs to build or upgrade more than 50,000 km of rural \nroads by 2030. It has a 95,000 km rural road network, of which 6% is paved and 28% has an \nimproved (gravel or stone macadam) surface, typically in poor condition. In July 2018, the National \nStrategy for Rural Roads and Access was published, which defines the core rural road network \n(CRRN) to ensure better connectivity for rural areas. 4  To meet the national target to connect 80% \n\n                                                 \n1  This refers to the state of living on an income marginally above the poverty line, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau \n\nat an income \"between 100 percent and 125 percent of the poverty line\". \n\n2  ADB. 2016.

Technical Assistance to the \nRepublic of the Union of Myanmar for Transport Sector Reform and Modernization. Manila. \n\n3  The RAI is an internationally used indicator that shows the portion of the rural population that lives less than 2 km \n\nfrom an all-season road. The RAI is indicator 9.1.1 of the Sustainable Development Goals. \n\n4  Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar. 2018. National Strategy for Rural Roads and Access. Nay Pyi \nTaw. The strategy is developed based on the National Transport Sector Development Master Plan (footnote 11) to \naddress specific issues on rural roads. Under the strategy, the CRRN is defined as \u201cthe minimum rural road network \nin a township required to connect all villages to each other and to the higher-level road network.\u201d The Department of \nRural Road Development (DRRD) under the Ministry of Construction (MOC) and regional offices worked together to \n\n \n\n \n\n\fof registered villages by 2030, the government estimates that Myanmar needs to upgrade about \n42,000 km of existing rural roads and construct 10,000 km of new roads. The total cost of this \nprogram is estimated at $2.5 billion, considering only the most basic improvements needed to \nmake the roads all-season. \n \n6. \nDisaster risk. Myanmar has a high risk of disaster triggered by natural hazards, which is \ncompounded by insufficient disaster resilience of the road network. It is also highly exposed to \ntyphoons and floods. 5 Following severe events, the logistics system frequently collapses, cutting \naccess to villages, and entire regions sometimes cannot be reached by emergency response. In \n2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated the Ayeyarwady region, resulting in at least 138,000 casualties \nand  economic  losses  of  more  than  $10  billion.  In  2015,  catastrophic  floods  and  landslides \ndisplaced 1.6 million people and resulted in economic loss equivalent to 3.1% of Myanmar\u2019s gross \ndomestic product. 6 The 2015 floods washed away about 900 bridges and damaged more than \n1,000 km of rural roads, including in the Ayeyarwady and Magway regions. Rural unpaved roads \nare particularly vulnerable to damage during the wet season.  \n \nRural road maintenance. The sustainability of Myanmar\u2019s rural road network is generally \n7. \nlow because of lack of adequate maintenance. Rural road maintenance funding was introduced \nin 2014, but has only increased marginally since then, providing about $150 per km for the existing \nCRRN. Much of this funding is concentrated on a limited portion of the rural road network, leaving \nmost of the network without any maintenance. The implementation modalities for maintenance \nare  not  well  developed,  leading  to  delays  in  implementation  and  putting  a  high  burden  on  the \nDepartment of Rural Road Development (DRRD) for supervision and inspection.  \n \nEmergency maintenance for disaster resilience. Myanmar\u2019s rural road network is of a \n8. \nlow standard, resulting in frequent damage because of seasonal flooding and disasters triggered \nby natural hazards. The DRRD under the Ministry of Construction (MOC) faces frequent damages \nto rural roads that are addressed through annual emergency maintenance. However, the current \ncontracting  mechanisms  cause  delays  in  procurement,  leaving  disaster-damaged  roads \nunrepaired and affected villages without access for extended periods. Many CRRN roads face \nrepeated damage each year, but the DRRD lacks the capacity to remedy the issues. \n \nNational rural road strategy and program. To remedy rural road subsector issues, in \n9. \n2018, the government published the National Strategy for Rural Roads and Access with support \nfrom ADB (footnote 4). One of the objectives of the strategy is to connect 80% of all villages by \nall-season  roads  by  2030.  To  implement  the  strategy,  the  government  plans  to  introduce  a \nnational  rural  road  program,  financed  by  national  and  state  and/or  regional  governments, \ndevelopment partners, and a road fund. 7  \n \n10. \nADB strategy and value added by ADB assistance. The project is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry  operations  business  plan,  2019\u20132021  for  Myanmar  and  is  aligned  with  Strategy  2030 \n(Table 1). 8 Under the National Strategy for Rural Roads and Access and the national rural road \n\n                                                 \n\nconfirm the CRRN in 2017 and 2018, following guidance provided by the policy note (footnote 2).

The project builds on ADB\u2019s past and ongoing experience with road \nprojects in Myanmar, and incorporates the following lessons from past operations: (i) provide road \naccess with pavement surfacing suitable for local challenges and conditions; (ii) consider the local \ncontracting industry in sizing lots for contract packages; and (iii) ensure the project is implemented \nin a timely manner by managing resettlement issues efficiently during project planning. 10 \n \n12. \nRoad selection criteria and the project. The two project regions were selected based \non a ranking of the number and percentage of villages or rural populations with only dry-season \nroad access.11  Maubin and Pantanaw in the Ayeyarwady region, and Myothit and Natmauk in the \nMagway region were prioritized based on a ranking of poverty and access conditions. The DRRD \nidentified networks that are part of the CRRN in the four project townships. Candidate roads were \nranked according to population, the number of villages connected, connectivity to paved national \nroads, and economic rate of return; and additional priority was given to unpaved roads that are \nnot passable during the rainy season and thus have low disaster resilience, and roads that provide \naccess to social services.  \n \n13. \nThe poor and landless account for 8%\u201325% of the population in the project townships. \nChallenges include overcoming years of underinvestment in rural infrastructure as well as poorly \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2017.

The regions score highest in terms of the rural populations that have only dry-season rural road access, \neach with more than 30% of the total number of rural people affected (1.1 million people in Magway, and 2.5 million \npeople in Ayeyarwady). \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\ndeveloped nonfarm economic sectors. The main source of livelihood is agriculture and livestock \nactivities for all four townships. Many producers and farmers are  still isolated, mainly because \nannual natural hazard events disconnect villages from the main road network. This exacerbates \ntheir workload in carrying products, food, wood, or even clean water. The project is expected to \nimprove the villagers\u2019 livelihoods by providing them with connectivity which will enable increased \nparticipation in the national economy and by reducing transportation costs. \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: all-weather and safe road infrastructure \ndeveloped. 12 The project will have the following outcome: disaster-resilient road access for rural \npeople in Ayeyarwady and Magway regions improved. 13 \n \nC. \n \n15. \nOutput 1: Climate-resilient roads rehabilitated. The project will upgrade about 152 km \nof 14 unpaved roads in Ayeyarwady and Magway regions to paved standard, with road widths of \nabout  2.6  meters  (m)  to  3.0  m.  To  increase  disaster  resilience,  especially  in  the  Ayeyarwady \nregion,  the  roads  will  be  raised  above  frequently  occurring  flood  levels,  with  consideration  for \nfuture  climate  change  impacts.  Pavement  surfacing  will  be  with  cement  concrete,  penetration-\nmacadam  or  double  bituminous  surface  treatment.  The  detailed  design  and  implementation \nsupervision (DDIS) consultants will help the DRRD prepare rural road projects for future phases. \n \n16. \nOutput  2:  Rural  road  maintenance  management  strengthened.  The  project  will \ndevelop simple inventories of the CRRN, starting with the project roads. It will cover data on the \ngeographical  location;  length;  cross-section;  historical  maintenance  records;  and  future \nmaintenance plans, budgetary requirements, and evaluations with respect to routine and periodic \nmaintenance.  The  project  will  help  the  DRRD  improve  its  delivery  of  emergency  maintenance \nworks. The DRRD\u2018s current contracting modalities for emergency maintenance are not suitable \nfor this type of maintenance, resulting in delays in starting urgent works to restore access. The \nproject will support the DRRD in developing suitable ex ante contracting modalities (e.g., term-\nbased contracts), which would allow procurement to take place before disasters occur, and works \nto  be  initiated  through  a  simple  work  order.  The  project  will  also  help  the  DRRD  assess  the \ndisaster risk of the rural road network in the project regions by (i) gathering historical disaster loss \nand damage data, flood hazard maps, and climate change impacts, and (ii) integrating them in \nthe CRRN database, to improve the disaster resilience of the roads. Building from this information, \nthe project will develop a pilot emergency management plan for the DRRD for the most disaster-\nvulnerable village in the project region. \n \n17. \nOutput 3: Rural road safety strengthened. Given the improved road conditions to paved \nstandards  at  project  completion,  road  users  will  be  exposed  to  safety  risks  because  of  the \nincreased speeds of motorized vehicles. Traffic is expected to increase, and current traffic may \nchange  behaviors  drastically.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  this  output  will  introduce  a  community-\nbased road safety program. Since most road crashes are attributable to road user behavior, the \nfocus will be on road user education and community enforcement. 14 \n\n                                                 \n12 Government of Myanmar, Ministry of Transport and Communications. 2015.

Detailed  cost  estimates  by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM). 15 \nThe  government  has  requested  (i)  a  concessional  loan  of  $45.40 million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital resources (including $11.6 million allocation from the Disaster Risk Reduction funding set-\naside of concessional ordinary capital resources), and (ii) a grant not exceeding $5.8 million from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. The loan \nwill have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft loan agreement.

Pavement structures have been selected to enable a 10-year design life \nfor double bituminous surface treatment and macadam, and 20 years for concrete, with 20-year \nflood returns for all drainage structures. The underlying traffic projection is based on present traffic \nvolumes,  with  growth  rates  that  consider  Myanmar\u2019s  economic  potential.  All  materials  used  in \nroad  construction  are  locally  procured  except  for  bitumen,  road  signs,  road  furniture,  and \nreinforcement steel in concrete. \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nto  ensure  sustainable  maintenance.  The \n\nB. \n \n23. \nEconomic  viability.  The  project  is  economically  viable.  The  main  benefits  of  the  rural \nroad improvement work under output 1 are reduced vehicle operating costs and shorter travel \ntimes. The overall economic internal rate of return of the project is 11.7%. Each of the 14 project \nroads is economically viable, with economic internal rates of return exceeding 9.6%. 16 \n \n24. \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  DRRD  receives  fiscal  allocations  from  the  central  and \nregional governments for rural road development and maintenance. It estimates its annual budget \nneeds based on requests from its divisions and proposes to the Ministry of Planning and Finance \n(MOPF) for allocation. However, a needs assessment and maintenance budget allocation has not \nbeen  established \nincremental  operation  and \nmaintenance  cost  associated  with  the  project  is  estimated  at  an  annualized  cost  of  about \n$0.6 million, which the DRRD will ensure to be secured in coordination with the MOPF.  \n \nC. \n \n25. \nInstitutional capacity. The procurement management risk is high, mainly because the \nproject is the DRRD\u2019s first large-scale project to be financed by a multilateral development bank, \nand because of DRRD\u2019s capacity constraints. The DDIS consultant will support strengthening the \nDRRD\u2019s capacity in procurement management throughout the project. \n \n26. \nFinancial  management.  The  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  substantial, \nmainly  because  of  weaknesses  in  government-wide  financial  management  systems  and  the \nlimited experience of the DRRD in implementing projects with development partners, including \nADB.  The  DRRD  will  manage  day-to-day  activities  to  mitigate  the  risks.  The  MOC,  under  its \nDepartment  of  Highways  (DOH),  is  implementing  three  other  ADB-financed  projects;  and  the \nMOC  management  has  assured  support  to  the  DRRD,  as  the  DOH  has  knowledge  and \nexperience of ADB policies and procedures. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 14). \n \n27. \nADB  coordinates  with  other  development  partners  such  as  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency  and  the  World  Bank  to  harmonize  support  to  the  government  in  capacity \nbuilding. ADB will extend its ongoing support for the transport sector and to the DRRD through \nthe  existing  technical  assistance  supporting  the  MOC  for  ongoing  projects  (footnote  10)  in \nenvironment and social safeguards, gender, project management, procurement, communication, \nand  project  coordination. 17  The  World  Bank  has  been  helping  the  DRRD  establish  a  proper \naccounting system by introducing automated software, which will be used for this project. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment and the DRRD.  \n \nD. \n \nPoverty. In 2014, 35% of residents of the Ayeyarwady region and 25% of residents of the \n28. \nMagway  region  lived  in  poverty. 18  In  rural  areas,  where  township-specific  data  do  not  exist, \npoverty is higher. The project roads will improve access to markets and socio-economic services, \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n                                                 \n16 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB.  2014.

The \nproject is expected to contribute to higher ex-farm produce prices and lower input costs. It will \nalso  contribute  to  general  economic  development  by  lowering  transport  costs  and  via  time \nsavings, leading to more diversified local economies and additional job opportunities. The road \nselection criteria under the project (paras. 12 and 13) target the most disadvantaged population. \nThe  benefits  of  the  project  vary  by  townships: Maubin,  Myothit,  and  Natmauk  will  benefit  from \nhaving  better  access  to  markets  and  greater  opportunity  to  sell  their  agricultural  products. \nPantanaw  has  a  higher  unemployment  rate  (20.83%),  and  the  project  will  facilitate  increased \naccess to jobs that would generate adequate and stable earnings (footnote 9).   \n\n29.\nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking. The project will improve existing roads and is thus not\nexpected to pose a significant long-term risk with respect to increased  incidence of HIV/AIDS,\nsexually transmitted infections, or human trafficking. However, the increased presence of road\nworkers during construction and increased traffic may elevate the risk of HIV/AIDS transmission\nduring construction. To mitigate this risk, the contractors will implement prevention and assistance\nactivities for their workers. The DDIS consultants will oversee a community-awareness program\nto guide and coordinate all activities. 19\n\nConflict sensitivity approach. In the Ayeyarwady and Magway regions, the project will\n30.\nbenefit all communities and groups in a fair, unbiased, and equal manner.20 Increased connectivity\nunder  the  project  will  create  greater  trade  opportunities  which  could  foster  growth  and  reduce\npoverty. This connectivity will also augment the development impacts of ADB-assisted national\nroads (footnote 10) to reach remote rural areas.\n\nGender  Mainstreaming.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The\n31.\nlack of basic road access for poor rural women amplifies their workload in carrying products, food,\nwood, or even clean water. For this reason, basic access to markets and services within a day-\nreturn basis is particularly important to women. Gender elements in the project include (i) ensuring\nthat  women  constitute  at  least  30%  of  unskilled  labor  during  construction  and  that  gender-\nsensitive measures are incorporated in the contractors\u2019 requirements, including mitigating risks of\nsexual harassment, exploitation, and abuse; 21 (ii) training women in labor-based technology for\nconstruction and road maintenance; 22 and (iii) training women as facilitators in the safe school\nzone program and in community enforcement. 23\n\nE.\n\nSafeguards\n\n32.\nsafeguard categories are as follows. 24\n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009), \n\nthe  project\u2019s \n\n33.\nEnvironment  (category  B).  Initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  reports  were \nprepared  for  the  two  project  regions  of  Ayeyarwady  and  Magway  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  and  Myanmar\u2019s  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Procedure \n(2015), and were uploaded to the ADB website in May 2019. 25 The IEE reports confirm that the \nproposed  upgrading  of  existing  unpaved  roads  to  paved  standard  is  not  anticipated  to  cause \n\n19 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20  Myanmar uses \u201cethnic groups\u201d rather than \u201cindigenous peoples.\u201d \n21  Actual numbers of women hired and trained will be reported, in addition to the actual percentage indicator. \n22  Labor-based technology in road works refers to input of labor that is performed with non-mechanical tool. \n23 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 ADB.

Anticipated  impacts  include  the  generation  of  dust, \nnoise,  and  exhausts  from  haul  trucks  and  hot  mix  plants;  waste  from  construction  and  worker \ncamps;  water  contamination;  and  occupational  health  and  safety  hazards.  These  construction \nimpacts are temporary, localized, and can be mitigated through sound construction practices and \nmeasures defined in the environmental management plan. \n \n34. \nThe  increased  traffic  safety  risks  resulting  from  improved  road  conditions  will  be \naddressed through output 3. Community consultation conducted during the IEE confirmed broad \ncommunity support for the project. Possible community concerns during project implementation \nwill be addressed through the project grievance redress mechanism, coordinated by the DRRD. \nThe capacity of the DRRD will be strengthened through the appointment of qualified environment \nstaff within the DRRD, and the recruitment of specialists under the DDIS consulting services. \n \n35. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  (category  B).  The  project  is \ncategorized B for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  Involuntary  resettlement  impacts  were  identified  in  3  of  the \n14 proposed roads. Anticipated impacts affect four households, including three households losing \nmarginal strips of land together with the associated trees and crops. An additional household will \nlose trees but not land. No loss of structures or physical displacement will occur. No shops or \nother livelihood sources will be affected. Therefore, the involuntary resettlement impacts are not \nsignificant. \n \n36. \nSeveral ethnic groups are present in the project areas of Pantanaw and Maubin townships. \nThe project will benefit all people living in the project area with no bias to any particular group. \nConsultations  with  local ethnic  groups  reveal  that  the  communities  are  well  integrated.  A  draft \ncombined resettlement and ethnic group plan (REGP) has been prepared by MOC in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  in  line  with  the  relevant  rules  and  regulations  of \nMyanmar.  26 \n \n37. \nThe  draft  REGP  will  be  updated  based  on  a  detailed  measurement  survey  during  the \ndetailed design, a complete census survey and socioeconomic assessment. The REGP contains \na  broad  entitlement  matrix,  which  will  cover  any  unanticipated  or  new  impacts  to  be  identified \nduring the detailed design. An institutional mechanism and grievance redress mechanism have \nbeen proposed in the draft REGP, with roles and responsibilities of officials, representatives and \ncommittee  members  delineated  for  various  activities.  The  project\u2019s  communication  and \nparticipation plan has been prepared and included in the PAM. The DRRD and the MOC will be \nsupported by DDIS consultants for updating, implementing, and monitoring the REGP. The DRRD \nwill have designated safeguards staff, and the DDIS consultants will provide on-the-job training \nwhen needed for the implementation and monitoring of the REGP. \n \nF. \n \n38. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan. 27 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n                                                 \n26 Resettlement and Ethnic Group Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nInitial delays occur in project implementation. \n\nWeak government capacity in procurement, \ncontract management, financial management, \nand safeguards delays implementation or leads \nto noncompliance with approved plans. \nExtreme weather events delay civil works or \nrequire an increase in the scope of works. \nThe government\u2019s budget for operation and \nmaintenance falls below the minimum \nrequirements. \n\nInitiate the recruitment of the DDIS consultant under \nadvance action. \nMinimize the number of contracts, set up a project \nfinancial management system, and strengthen project \nmanagement unit capacity through training and day-to-\nday assistance from the DDIS consultant. \nMonitor the status and consider requiring the DDIS \nconsultant to design additional works. \nThe DRRD will allocate annual budget of $0.6 million \nfrom 2025, and improve rural road maintenance \nmanagement with support from DDIS consultant. \n\nDDIS = detailed design and implementation supervision, DRRD = Department of Rural Road Development. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n39. \nThe government, the MOC, and the DRRD have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n40. \nfor the project, which are set forth in the draft loan and grant agreements. \n \n\nThe government, the MOC, and the DRRD have agreed with ADB on certain covenants \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n \n41. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  of  $45,400,000  to  the  Republic  of  the  Union  of  Myanmar  for  the  Rural \nRoads and Access Project,  from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional \nterms, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period \nand 1.5% per year thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board; and \nthe grant not exceeding $5,800,000 to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for \nthe Rural Roads and Access Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian \nDevelopment Fund), on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board. \n\n11 October 2019 \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n \n\n10 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nDisaster-resilient \nroad access for rural \npeople in \nAyeyarwady and \nMagway regions \nimproved \n\nOutputs \n1.
