THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto  the  Republic  of  Kiribati  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  South  Tarawa  Sanitation \nImprovement Sector Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed additional financing is to help meet the current project\u2019s expected cost \noverruns from expenditures incurred in completing the civil works contracts for rehabilitating \nsewerage systems and upgrading ocean sewage outfalls.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Kiribati is a small remote atoll country facing special challenges and constraints to \ndevelopment. The development objectives set out in the Kiribati Development Plan (KDP), \n2016\u20132019  are  inclusive  sustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  along  with \nimproving education and health services, governance, and infrastructure.3 The KDP is aligned \nwith the country operations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for Kiribati;4 Pacific Approach, 2016\u2013\n2020;5 and the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).6 \nIneffective governance arrangements have contributed to the deterioration of South Tarawa\u2019s \nsewerage  network.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Utilities  (MPWU),  the  implementing \nagency for the current project, is responsible for water supply and sanitation sector policy, \nplanning, and regulation, but has insufficient capacity and resources. The Public Utilities Board \n(PUB) is responsible for sewerage services, but has insufficient resources and cannot charge \nfor services. \n \n4.  The current project is financed by ADB, the Government of Australia, the Multi-Donor \nTrust Fund7 under the Water Financing Partnership Facility, and the Government of Kiribati to \nsupport improvements to the health of communities in South Tarawa. Development coordination \nand cooperation between ADB, the cofinanciers, and the government is strong. Current project \nfinancing is $23.10 million. On 17 October 2011, ADB approved a loan in various currencies \nequivalent to SDR4,700,000 ($7.56 million equivalent) and administration of grant cofinancing of \n$13.95 million equivalent from the Government of Australia (footnote 2). The Government of \nKiribati  is  providing  counterpart  financing  of  $0.98  million  equivalent.  The  loan  and  grant \nagreements were signed on 3 May 2012 and declared effective on 1 June 2012. The ADB Multi-\nDonor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility provided additional financing \nof $0.61 million on 14 May 2014.8 The expected project completion date is 30 June 2019, and \nthe loan and grant closing date is 31 December 2019. \n \n                                                \n1  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2011.

The current project encountered initial delays because of significant capacity constraints \nwithin MPWU and the executing agency, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development \n(MFED). This led to the establishment of the Kiribati Fiduciary Services Unit (KFSU) within \nMFED.  MPWU  recruited  an  international  project  technical  advisor  to  support  the  project \nimplementation unit within MPWU, as well as ensure effective project monitoring and evaluation. \nThe project steering committee, the National Infrastructure Development Steering Committee, \nmeets regularly to review project implementation progress and to address issues. \n \n6.  The project performance rating has consistently been on track since January 2015. The \nproject was performing well as of the second quarter (Q2) of 2016.9 \n \n(i)  Delivery of expected outputs. The status of the expected outputs are as follows: \n(a)  Output 1 intends to engage the community in order to improve sanitation \nand hygiene practices among South Tarawa\u2019s population. Of the 11 local \npeople engaged as community mobilizers, eight are women. Through the \nuse of these community mobilizers, the project has successfully engaged \nSouth Tarawa communities and the public. A recent review of community \nsurvey data indicates a marked improvement in hygiene practices and \ncontinued  effort  to  advocate  a  user-pays  principle  to  recover  water \ncharges. \n(b)  Output 2 comprises improvements to the existing sanitation infrastructure. \nThis  includes  the  rehabilitation  of  the  Bairiki,  Betio,  and  Bikenibeu \nsaltwater and sewerage systems and upgrading works on three sewerage \noutfalls. The international competitive bidding (ICB) civil works package \nfor sewerage systems (ICB01) has been ongoing since August 2014. The \nocean sewerage outfall civil works package (ICB02) had been delayed by \nrebidding and a redesign of the due diligence required for the work to fit \nwithin the budget. The contract was awarded in July 2016. MPWU had \nconsidered  using  sludge  digesters  in  ICB01,  but  opted  to  procure \nconventional  drying  beds  instead  as  a  variation  through  the  ICB01 \ncontract.  Procurement  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  April  2017. \nDiscussions are ongoing on establishing an operation and maintenance \n(O&M) contract for up to 5 years following completion of both civil works \npackages.  The  request  for  quotation  for  two  on-site  sanitation  pilot \npackages  was  issued  on  1  July  2016.  These  packages  are  being \nevaluated and are expected to be awarded by September 2016. These \non-site sanitation pilot packages form the first of two candidate subproject \ngroups. This pilot program aims to provide 39 households with on-site \nsanitation  systems,  such  as  septic  tanks  with  system  support,  and \nundertake quarterly effluent and compost quality monitoring program over \na  2\u2013year  period.  An  international  sanitation  engineer  and  a  national \nsanitation engineer have been recruited to implement the program. The \npilot program for the second subproject group is expected to proceed \nprovided there is sufficient funding. Output 2 is anticipated to be delivered \nas expected, ensuring that the PUB effectively manages the wastewater \nin South Tarawa. \n(c)  Output 3 comprises capacity building for MPWU and PUB to improve their \nability to plan and manage water and sanitation services. The capacity \n                                                \n9 ADB. 2010. Additional Financing: Enhancing Development Effectiveness. Manila (para. 52); and ADB. 2011. \nAdditional Financing. Operations Manual. OM H5/BP. Manila (para. 3). \n ", "3 \ndevelopment  component  made  substantial  progress  during  the  first  3 \nyears of project implementation. Training activities under the capacity \ndevelopment plan have been reviewed and discussions are ongoing on \nfurther maintenance and asset management training following completion \nof the physical works. \n(d)  Output 4 involves the creation of a dedicated sanitation maintenance fund \nunder MPWU. The fund will be available to PUB to finance sanitation \nO&M as well as the determination of the tariff structure. The project will \nset  up  $0.74  million  in  grant  funds  for  sanitation  maintenance.  The \ngovernment has concurred with the policy and governance arrangements \nfor establishing the fund. A significant delay occurred when replacing the \nfinancial advisor to support the establishment of the fund, but that position \nhas  now  been  filled  and  will  provide  continued  support  to  MPWU. \nComplementary to the current project, the Pacific Regional Infrastructure \nFacility has provided technical assistance (co-led by ADB and the World \nBank) to advise the government on utility services reform, including a \nreview  of  the  tariff  structure.10 The  revised  design  and  monitoring \nframework proposes to change the time frame for activities under this \noutput to align them with the current status. This output is not yet due. \n(e)  Output 5 is efficient and effective project management provided by MFED \nand  MPWU.  The  KFSU  ensures  effective  project  coordination,  and \nfiduciary and procurement support. The project implementation unit within \nMPWU  provides  direct  project  implementation  support.  MPWU  also \nrecruited  a  consultant  technical  advisor  to  provide  effective  project \nmanagement. Physical work is on track and planned for completion by \nApril 2017. \n \n(ii)  Satisfactory  implementation  progress.  Progress  on  contract  awards  is \nsatisfactory as one of the two major civil works packages is being implemented. \nOverall civil works contract administration is being routinely monitored by the \nsupervising engineer. The contract for project management and implementation \nservices was awarded on 5 June 2012 for $4.1 million and A$1.0 million (totaling \n$5.2 million equivalent). As of July 2016, the current contract amount was about \n$6.7 million because of variations related to additional design and staff inputs. \nThe ICB01 contract was awarded on 31 August 2014 for $5.2 million. With 55% \nof the project time elapsed, the cumulative contract award is 60% ($12.7 million) \nand disbursement is 44% ($9.3 million). \n \n(iii)  Satisfactory compliance with safeguard policy requirements. Compliance \nwith  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  management  plans  and  the \nenvironmental licenses for ICB01 is satisfactory. The Ministry of Environment, \nLands  and  Agriculture  Development  (MELAD),  which  carries  out  routine \ncompliance monitoring, has not reported any major issues. The ICB01 contractor \nroutinely  monitors  its  compliance  with  the  environmental  management  plan \n(EMP); the consulting engineer also checks and audits such compliance. The \ncontractor\u2019s health and safety performance was found to be of best practice. The \ncontractor has implemented its HIV/AIDS prevention program and has engaged \nin community and village cleanup initiatives. \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for the Establishment of the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility Coordination \nOffice. Manila. \n ", "4 \n(iv)  Successful management of risks. The project has managed and mitigated the \nrisks identified during processing and implementation. As such, the successful \nimplementation of the project is not threatened by major risks. Nonetheless, the \nroad infrastructure investment that is being undertaken concurrently still presents \na coordination risk related to underground servicing work. Measures adopted \ninclude regular project coordination briefings ahead of work. Risks are further \nreviewed during administration review missions. \n \n(v)  On track rating. The project\u2019s performance was rated on track as of Q2 2016. \n \n7.  Additional  financing  is  needed  because  costs  were  underestimated  and  the  ocean \nsewerage outfalls package required a redesign. At project inception, the consulting engineers of \nthe project implementation unit reviewed the preliminary designs and background reports that \nhad been prepared under the project preparatory technical assistance.11 They discovered that \nthe design reports for pumps and infiltration galleries needed improvement. The drawings, for \nexample, did not indicate any details about service hole and pipe locations, sizes, and depths. \nThe  information  was  considered  inadequate  for  environmental  assessment  purposes. \nSignificant work was involved in reviewing and producing detailed design drawings and bid \ndocuments,  and  obtaining  environmental  approvals.  The  bid  documentation  was  only \nconsidered conceptual, largely because the design reports and the details of the drawings were \ninadequate. As a consequence, an additional 12 months were required to prepare the bid \ndocuments for the core subprojects. \n \n8.  The  cost  estimate  for  ICB01  at  project  appraisal  was  $5.9  million  (A$6.0  million \nequivalent);12 following the consulting engineers review and detailed design, the cost estimate \nincreased to $6.8 million equivalent (A$6.9 million). The approved contract award value was \nA$7.9 million ($7.4 million equivalent), 31.7% more than the appraisal estimate and 8.2% above \nthe  designers\u2019  revised  estimate.  The  overall  shortfall  totals  $1.24  million  (A$1.33  million \nequivalent).13 Increases were primarily related to mobilization, insurance, and general costs \n(A$2.6 million); and differences in prices of most items (e.g., rehabilitation and installation of \npump  stations,  construction  of  service  holes).  Work  is  ongoing,  and  the  current  approved \nvariation totals A$0.7 million for installation of valves, connections, risers and surface boxes, \nand  hydrants,  as  well  as  the  replacement  of  the  Bikenibeu  saltwater  tower.  A  systematic \nassessment of the condition of these assets found that the identified network assets have \nsignificant corrosion and must be replaced. \n \n9.  The ICB02 contract to rehabilitate the three ocean sewerage outfalls proposed horizontal \ndirectional drilling as the preferred construction methodology. The cost estimate for this package \nat project appraisal was $4.0 million (A$4.1 million equivalent) (footnote 12). Four bidders \nresponded with bid prices from A$7.5 million ($6.7 million equivalent) to A$17.1 million ($15.3 \nmillion equivalent),14 or 67.5%\u2013327.5% above the engineer\u2019s estimate. The bids were indicative \nof the high risks that the market placed on the remote and inaccessible country, and the \narduousness of the work site. An independent review concluded that horizontal directional \ndrilling is not recommended because of unknown geotechnical conditions and the uncertainty \nregarding consistency and ease of drilling through the reef. In view of the high bid prices, the \ntender was canceled in August 2014. The engineer recommended changing the design to the \n                                                \n11 ADB.

The \nestimated costs cover general establishment costs, outfall replacement, and larger diameter \npipes. A temporary outfall pipeline would be required at each outfall location to maintain the \nexisting flows of wastewater. \n \n10.  The ICB02 retendering process took 18 months. The process involved a detailed marine \nsurvey and design, an environmental assessment and public consultations, bid documentation, \nand tender evaluation. Following the tender evaluation, the contract award was awarded in July \n2016 for A$6.9 million ($5.2 million equivalent).15 \n \n11.  The current project meets all eligibility criteria for additional financing16 because it (i) \nremains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound (paras. 17\u201318); (ii) is a \nhigh priority of the government, which has included the investment in the KDP; (iii) retains the \noriginal development objectives; and (iv) is consistent with ADB\u2019s current country partnership \nstrategy for Kiribati (footnote 5). The current project has faced challenges, but no major change \nin the design and implementation arrangements was required. The current project performance \nhas been rated on track since Q1 2015. Additional financing is a suitable modality to make sure \nthat (i) the overall project is successfully completed by the current loan closing date, (ii) the \ntargets and indicators of the design and monitoring framework are successfully achieved, and \n(iii) the project development objective is met. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact and outcome of the project will not change. The impact will be improved \nhealth for the people of South Tarawa. The outcome will be enhanced access to improved \nsanitation infrastructure and services for South Tarawa\u2019s urban population. \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The outputs will not change: (i) sanitation and hygiene practices among South Tarawa\u2019s \npopulation will be improved through a community engagement program; (ii) priority water and \nsanitation infrastructure (i.e., the existing Bairiki, Betio, and Bikenibeu sewerage systems and \nthe three sewerage outfalls) will be rehabilitated and upgraded, and onsite sanitation systems \nwill be improved; (iii) MPWU and PUB will have the capacity to plan and manage water and \nsanitation services through a targeted capacity building program; (iv) a sanitation maintenance \nfund  will  be  available  to  finance  O&M;  and  (v)  MFED  and  MPWU  will  provide  project \nmanagement  and  implementation  services  to  support  effective  and  efficient  project \nimplementation. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n14.   The additional grant of $2.8 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will increase \ninvestment in the project by 12% from the current level. The revised investment plan is in Table \n1. \n \n                                                \n15 The $1.000 = A$1.339 exchange rate is based on the date of the Letter of Acceptance (26 July 2016). \n16 ADB. 2010.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n17.  The overall project has been assessed as technically viable, as demonstrated by the \nabsence of any significant technical issues during the ongoing civil works and the wider sector \nproject  activities.  ICB01  includes  the  rehabilitation  of  the  saltwater  system,  service  holes, \nsewerage systems, pump stations, electrical and/or controls equipment, saltwater towers, and \nintakes. Saltwater pipeline cleaning, jetting, and restoration in Betio is completed; cleaning, \ninspection, and repair of the sewerage system is ongoing. Work on the elevated tanks and \ntowers is ongoing. The Betio saltwater tank has been refurbished and recoated with corrosion-\nresistant  epoxy.  The  other  towers  in  Bairiki  and  Bikenibeu  are  due  for  replacement.  The \nsaltwater tower at Bikenibeu is dilapidated and will be demolished and replaced. The Bairiki \ntower was demolished and work has begun. Work on pumping facilities has started in parallel \nwith the ongoing reticulation upgrades. Work on the ocean sewerage outfalls has not started. \n \n                                                \n18 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n18.  The project\u2019s economic viability was reevaluated based on the higher cost estimates. \nThe revised economic internal rate of return is estimated at 12.7% (from 16.1% in the original \nappraisal), which is considered acceptable as it exceeds the 10.0% economic opportunity cost \nof capital adopted for the analysis.19 The high economic internal rate of return can be attributed \nto  expected  improvements  in  productivity  resulting  from  reduced  incidences  of  mortality, \nparticularly of infants and children under 5 years of age, and from the avoided near-term risk of \na  serious  outbreak  of  potentially  fatal  diseases  such  as  cholera.  The  financial  analysis \nconcluded that the project is sustainable based on the government\u2019s commitment to (i) introduce \ntariffs to cover sewerage O&M costs along with service delivery improvements; and (ii) establish \nthe sanitation maintenance fund to ensure that adequate funds are available to cover the O&M \ncosts of the sanitation system in the short to medium term. \n \nC.  Governance \n19.  Financial management. A public expenditure and financial accountability assessment, \nconducted in Kiribati in 2010, indicated that public financial management is weakened by (i) lack \nof fiscal discipline, (ii) nonretirement of advances, (iii) lack of financial reconciliation between \nMFED and the line ministries, (iv) lack of effective expenditure commitment controls, and (v) \noutdated legislation and regulations.20 Since that assessment, ADB and other development \npartners  have  assisted  the  government  in  designing  and  implementing  the  Kiribati  Public \nFinancial Management Plan, 2011\u20132014.21 Improvements in public financial management have \nbeen noted, and plans are in place to update the public expenditure and financial accountability \nassessment in 2017. \n \n20.  The financial management arrangements for the current project will continue for the \nadditional financing. MFED will continue to be responsible for the overall financial management \nof the project, and a full-time qualified project accountant will continue to handle all financial \nmanagement  activities.  The  project  will  continue  to  use  direct  payment  and  imprest  fund \ndisbursement procedures, and all required audits will be carried out. For the current project, no \naudited  project financial  statements  are  overdue  and  no financial  management  issues  are \npending. All four audited project financial statements were submitted early and were issued with \nunqualified opinions. \n \n21.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MFED.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \n22.  Procurement. KFSU has assisted MPWU in procuring all project goods, works, and \nservices under the current project, with close oversight by ADB. Initially ADB administered the \nselection of project management and implementation consultants. The coordination between \nKFSU and MPWU is ongoing. \n \n \n                                                \n19 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Government  of  Kiribati.  2010.  Kiribati:  Public  Financial  Management\u2014Performance  Report.  Tarawa. \nhttp://asia.ifad.org/web/kiribati/resources/-/resource_library/5919/newsletter. \n21 Government of Kiribati. Kiribati Public Financial Management Plan, 2011\u20132014. Unpublished. \n ", "9 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n23.  The  current  project  will  directly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  provide  social \nbenefits through improved sanitation and hygiene practices, and enhanced access to improved \nsanitation among South Tarawa\u2019s population. This is expected to result in significant health \nimprovements, higher productivity, and lower expenditures on medical treatment. \n \n24.  The project serves the port area of Betio, a prostitution hub, where there is considerable \nrisk of sexually transmitted infections and HIV transmission. While the current HIV prevalence \nrate in South Tarawa is reported to be low, the port is a hub for international fishing vessels and \nabout 30% of the population has a sexually transmitted infection. The current project carries out \nan HIV prevention program for the contractor\u2019s employees and communities near the project \nsite. \n \n25.  Gender. The current project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. Most project \noutputs have specific gender design features to facilitate women\u2019s participation in, and access \nto, project benefits. The gender action plan aims to ensure that any potentially harmful effects \non women are avoided, with specific actions that will allow women to benefit from the project. \nThe gender action plan includes awareness and behavior change campaigns that have been \nongoing  with  support  from  a  community  engagement  and  gender  specialist,  as  well  as \ncommunity mobilizers. The community engagement outreach has been running concurrently \nwith targeted gender training for MPWU, PUB, urban councils, and community leaders. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n26.  Environment. The current project is classified category B for the environment under \nADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) as impacts are site-specific. Mitigation measures are \nin place through approved initial environment examinations, in accordance with the project's \nenvironmental assessment and review framework. Corresponding EMPs have been prepared \nwith national requirements met and environmental licenses issued by MELAD for ICB01 and \nICB02. Since the additional financing is for cost overruns only, with no new or additional civil \nwork, it is classified category C. The environmental assessment found that the project will \nenhance the overall environmental quality of freshwater and nearshore marine areas through \nupgraded sewage and sanitation facilities. An international environment specialist and a national \nenvironment inspector are engaged to ensure compliance monitoring of the EMPs and reporting \nto MELAD. A climate change adaptation risk evaluation was conducted and considered in the \ninfrastructure design. \n \n27.  Involuntary resettlement. The current project is classified category B for resettlement. \nAn updated resettlement plan for the project and a land resettlement review framework are in \nplace to provide guidance for any unanticipated impacts. The additional financing is classified \ncategory C, as it is designated for civil works to replace three sewerage outfalls on public land. \nThe additional financing will not entail any new or additional civil work that would result in land \nacquisition or resettlement. \n \n28.  After detailed design, there is no known legal impediments regarding access to sites, \nand all surrounding landowners have been advised of the work. Safeguards monitoring reports \nfor the original project are regularly submitted and disclosed. \n \n29.  Indigenous peoples. The current project is classified category C for indigenous peoples. \nIt will have no impact on any distinct and vulnerable group of indigenous peoples, as defined \n ", "10 \nunder the Safeguard Policy Statement. The beneficiaries are the people of South Tarawa, who \nare largely from the i-Kiribati ethnic group. All project outputs will continue to be delivered in a \nculturally appropriate and participatory manner. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.22 Overall, the risks are being managed and mitigated under improved \nproject  implementation  arrangements,  in  particular  the  establishment  of  KFSU  and  the \nengagement  of  a  technical  advisor.  The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs. The overall sustainability of the project is being bolstered by institutional \nreforms at PUB and the government\u2019s reinstated subsidy for community service obligations to \nassist O&M funding for water and sewerage infrastructure. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n31.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand legal documents. \n \n32.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the grant agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n33.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not \nexceeding $2,800,000 to the Republic of Kiribati for the additional financing of the South Tarawa \nSanitation Improvement Sector Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n14 September 2016 \n \n                                                \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project Is Aligned with \nCurrent project \nImproved health of South Tarawa\u2019s population \nOverall project \nUnchanged \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nCurrent project  Current project     \nSouth Tarawa\u2019s urban  By 2019, 80% of the South  Census data, and  Climate change impacts \npopulation has  Tarawa community in Bairiki,  household and income  are more severe than \nenhanced access to  Betio, and Bikenibeu has  expenditure survey  predicted by current \nimproved sanitation  access to improved sanitation    models. \ninfrastructure and  (2010 baseline: 64.3%)  WHO and UNICEF joint \nservices    monitoring data \n  Overall project \nOverall project  Unchanged \nUnchanged \nOutputs       \nOutput 1  By 2018   \nCurrent project  Current project   \nSanitation and hygiene  1a.
