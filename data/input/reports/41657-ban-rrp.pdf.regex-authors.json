It will enable people to resume their normal lives by \nrestoring  access  to  livelihoods  and  basic  infrastructure.  The  project \ndesign is based on (i) the joint damage and needs assessment after the \nfloods led by the Government of Bangladesh in October\u2013November 2007 \nwith participation of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Japan Bank for \nInternational  Cooperation  (JBIC),  and  the  World  Bank;  and  (ii)  the \nGovernment\u2019s preliminary estimate of cyclone damage. The assessment \nof  flood  damage  and  needs  was  prepared  in  close  coordination  and \nconsultation with development partners active in Bangladesh including \nthe United Nations and its agencies. The assessment utilized work done \nby  the  Disaster  and  Emergency  Response  Subgroup  of  the  Local \nConsultative Group in Bangladesh. The project design also considered \nthe preliminary damage assessment of the cyclone by various United \nNations  and  government  agencies.  The  Project  supports  increased \ndisaster preparedness and mitigation of damage from future recurrent \nfloods  and  cyclones  by  enhancing  construction  specifications  for \nrehabilitated  infrastructure,  and  improving  early  warning  systems  in \ncooperation with neighboring upstream countries. It includes support for \ncapacity building. \n   \nRationale  The devastating 2007 floods and cyclone, affecting 25 million people in \n51 districts, caused severe damage to livelihood, infrastructure, and other \nassets; and disrupted economic activities, inflicting heavy losses to crops \nand slowing expansion in industries and services. The combined losses \nof the floods and cyclone are estimated at over $3 billion. The losses to \nassets and output because of flooding amount to more than $1 billion. \nPreliminary  assessment  indicates  that  the  cyclone  caused  extensive \ndamage of over $2 billion. The floods and cyclone slowed progress in \npoverty reduction, with the poor and the vulnerable suffering most in \nterms of losses to crops, livestock, property, and housing; and reduced \nincome  opportunities.  The  flood  and  cyclone  impact  is  likely  to  put \npressure on external and domestic balances. The pressure on the current \naccount  will  amplify,  requiring  additional  assistance  to  reduce  the \nexternal  financing  gap.  Pressure  on  the  fiscal  balance  will  increase \nbecause of the rise in expenditures for relief efforts; expansion of food-\nassisted safety nets; and imports of food grains and agricultural inputs, \nparticularly seeds and fertilizer.  ", "ii \nImpact and  The objective of the Project is to contribute to sustainable economic \nOutcome  growth by minimizing the devastating impact of the severe floods and \ncyclone, and reducing future risk from similar hazard events. The Project \nwill  focus  on  priority  areas  identified  through  consultation  with  the \nGovernment, private sector, nongovernment organizations, and other civil \nsociety organizations; and involve community participation. The Project \nincludes capacity building and training to strengthen the Government\u2019s \ndisaster  preparedness  by  adopting  cost-effective  flood  and  cyclone-\nresistant  infrastructure  design  standards  and  improved  early  warning \nsystems through increased subregional cooperation. It has five parts. \n \nPart  A:  Quick-Disbursing  Component:  Provide  import  financing  for \nessential commodities and inputs, particularly for agriculture, needed to \nmitigate the adverse impact of the floods and cyclone, and facilitate quick \nrecovery particularly of crop losses. In accordance with ADB's Disaster \nand Emergency Assistance Policy (2004), the Project will only finance \nessential imports identified for an effective disaster recovery program. \n \nPart B: Rural Infrastructure Component: Rehabilitate and restore rural \ninfrastructure in 23 districts, including 3,000 kilometers (km) of rural roads \nand 9,000 meters of bridges and culverts; and build or repair 300 flood \nand cyclone shelters (including livestock shelters) with sanitary facilities \nto  help  communities,  especially  the  poor,  during  future  floods  and \ncyclones.  \n \nPart  C:  Municipal  Infrastructure  Component:  Rehabilitate  urban \ninfrastructure, including 700 km of roads, 65 km of drains, 850 meters of \nbridges and culverts, as well as footpaths located in 30 pouroshavas \n(municipalities). \n \nPart D: Roads Component: Rehabilitate 800 km of damaged national, \nregional  and  district  roads,  and  64  bridges  and  culverts  within  the \ncountry\u2019s seven road zones.  \n \nPart  E:  Water  Resources  Component:  Rehabilitate  flood  control, \ndrainage,  and  irrigation  facilities;  repair  embankment  breaches;  and \nrepair or replace flood control structures, protective works, and canals \nunder 331 subprojects in 47 districts. \n   \nProject  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $220 million, including \nInvestment Plan   taxes  and  duties  of  $20.5  million.  Since  the  Project  follows  a  sector \napproach, the cost estimates are on a sector basis.  \n   ", "iii \nFinancing Plan  A loan of Special Drawing Rights 75,899,000 (equivalent to $120 million) \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will be provided to help finance the \nProject. The loan will have a maturity of 40 years including a grace period \nof 10 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum, repayment of principal at \n2%  per  year  for  the  first  10  years  after  the  grace  period  and  4% \nthereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan \nagreement. A technical assistance (TA) grant estimated at $200,000 will \nbe attached to the loan project to support financial management and \nmonitoring  and  third  party  scrutiny  of  subproject  selection  and \nimplementation. \n \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation proposes to provide a loan of \n$60  million  equivalent  and  the  Canadian  International  Development \nAgency  proposes  a  grant  of  $10  million  equivalent;  however,  formal \ncommitment  to  provide  such  financing  is  expected  after  ADB  Board \nconsideration of this Project. As it is envisaged that cofinancing will be \nprovided from these donors, which ADB will be requested to administer, \nthe scope of the Project reflects this likely additional funding. In the event \nsuch financing does not materialize, the Project scope will be adjusted to \naccommodate available financing. In view of the need for expediency and \nefficiency  in  ADB's  response  to  the  disaster  and  emergency, \nManagement requests Board approval of the administration of these and \nany  other  cofinanced  funds  obtained  from  development  partners \nsubsequent to the date of Board approval. Approval of such cofinanced \nfunds will be confirmed and approved by Management, and reported to \nthe Board in accordance with the standard reporting procedures. This \nprocedure will be adopted only to the extent that the additional funds \nprovided by cofinanciers will not materially alter or fundamentally affect \nthe objectives, purposes, and scope of the existing Project. Any proposed \ncofinancing that would materially affect the objectives, purpose, or scope \nof  the  Project  will  be  processed  as  a  major  change  of  scope  and \ncirculated to the Board in accordance with ADB's Project Administration \nInstructions 5.04 and the usual practice.  \n \n ", "iv \nAllocation  Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.

The  Emergency  Disaster  Damage  Rehabilitation  Project \nSteering  Committee  (PSC)  chaired  by  the  member,  Programming \nDivision, Planning Commission will provide overall project coordination. ", "v \n   \nThe PSC will monitor overall implementation, resolve interagency issues \nand  procedural  matters,  and  ensure  timely  counterpart  funding.  The \nProject will have strengthened anticorruption measures, including strict \nfinancial management and monitoring, performance auditing, and random \nspot checks. ADB\u2019s project administration functions will be delegated to \nADB\u2019s Bangladesh Resident Mission (BRM) for close supervision and \nmonitoring. \n   \nProcurement  Since the value of individual civil works contracts will be relatively small \nand those will be widely scattered in the disaster-affected areas, they are \nnot likely to attract international contractors. National procurement of civil \nworks  will  follow  the  Government\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Regulations \n(2003) and Public Procurement Act 2006, both generally acceptable to \nADB, and ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). The flexibility provided in ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency \nAssistance Policy will be used where applicable. \n   \nConsulting  Given the tight implementation schedule, the EAs\u2019 uneven institutional \nServices  capacity,  and  the  need  for  accelerated  project  implementation,  the \nProject will require 178 person-months of international and 1,905 person-\nmonths of national consulting services, determined on a needs basis, to \nassist the EAs with overall implementation and ensure quality of civil \nworks, governance, risk management and assessment, and other related \nareas. Consulting firms and individual consultants will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor  engaging  consultants.  At  the  request  of  the  Borrower,  ADB  has \nagreed to engage the consultants on behalf of the Borrower. Considering \nthe urgency and need to expedite project implementation, the consultants \nwill be engaged through single-source selection procedures as provided \nfor under the guidelines. \n   \nProject Benefits  The objective of the Project is to contribute to sustainable economic \nand Beneficiaries  growth by minimizing the devastating impact of the severe floods and \ncyclone, and reducing future risk from similar disasters. It will contribute \nto quick restoration of economic and social activity in the 51 districts for \n25  million  people  seriously  affected  by  the  floods  and  cyclone.  The \nProject  will  focus  on  rehabilitating  infrastructure,  improving  access  to \nhealth and education facilities and markets, and augmenting incomes \nand self-reliance. \n \nConsidering  the  severity  of  damage  and  asset  losses,  the  cost  of \nrehabilitating public infrastructure and facilities is high for the Government \nand local communities. Support in terms of financial assistance, adoption \nof  appropriate  flood-  and  cyclone-resistant  design  standards,  and \nstrengthening  of  disaster  preparedness  and  mitigation  will  be  of \nconsiderable  benefit  in  protecting  the  poor  and  affected  people  from \nfalling further into poverty. It will help rehabilitate families, provide a safer \nand healthier living environment, and stabilize livelihoods. \n \nDisasters, including severe floods and cyclones, disproportionately affect \nthe poor in terms of health, housing, employment, livelihood, and food \nsecurity. The damaged public infrastructure prevents access to health \nand education facilities and markets. Damaged municipal and community \n ", "vi \n  infrastructure, including waste and sewerage facilities, increase health \nrisks especially for the vulnerable and poor. By rehabilitating public and \ncommunity infrastructure, the Project will help restore critical social and \neconomic activities disrupted by the 2007 floods and cyclone. \n \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  provide  about  14  million  person-days  of \nemployment  to  local  skilled  and  unskilled  laborers.  The  Project  will \nencourage and provide for the engagement of women in rehabilitation \nworks of rural and municipal infrastructure.  \n \nThe project benefits will be evident through restored access to basic \nservices  resulting  from  speedy  rehabilitation  of  infrastructure  and \nfacilities, supporting restoration of livelihoods, especially for the poor. \n   \nRisks and  A potential risk is that procedural delays in obtaining various government \nAssumptions  approvals  may  slow  implementation.  Demonstrating  its  strong \ncommitment  to  the  Project,  the  Government  has  adopted  simplified \nprocedures that were successfully followed in past ADB-financed flood \ndamage  rehabilitation  projects.  The  selection  of  EAs  with  extensive \nexperience  in  implementing  ADB-financed  projects,  and  sufficient \ncapacity and familiarity with ADB procedures, the project implementation \narrangements with already established project management units, and \nthe use of consultants directly selected from already engaged consulting \nfirms under ongoing ADB-supported projects under the same EAs, will \nminimize delays at the EA level. Sound macroeconomic management is \nexpected to ensure adequate and timely counterpart funding.  \n \nThe risk of governance-related issues, including potential irregularities in \nprocurement,  is  addressed  by  providing  (i)  detailed  selection  criteria, \nincluding  third  party  scrutiny  of  subprojects;  (ii)  transparent \nimplementation and monitoring mechanisms; and (iii) specific financial \ncontrols, including regular and random audits using external auditors. \nMeasures also include enhanced construction supervision and consultant \nsupport,  strict  application  of  the  Government\u2019s  Public  Procurement \nRegulations 2003 and Public Procurement Act 2006, close monitoring by \nADB, and random procurement and performance auditing at the EA level. \nThe PSC will be supported by monitoring and evaluation specialists from \nthe Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation Division of the Ministry of \nPlanning. In addition, two national consultants will be engaged under the \nTA to provide support for financial management and monitoring, with \nspecific  tasks  of  helping  monitor  all  project  activities  and  conducting \nspecific random and spot checks of subproject implementation. \n \nSince the risk for future disasters, including floods and cyclones, is high \nin Bangladesh, the Project supports and complements the Government\u2019s \nongoing  efforts  and  the  externally  financed  disaster  management \nprogram  and  application  of  risk  reduction  strategies,  particularly  for \ninfrastructure development and rehabilitation. \n   \nTechnical  ADB  will  provide  a  TA  grant  of  $200,000  to  support  financial \nAssistance  management,  procurement  audit,  third  party  scrutiny  of  subproject \nselection and contract execution, and monitoring. \n \n ", " ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Emergency Disaster Damage Rehabilitation \n(Sector) Project. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Financial \nManagement and Monitoring, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will  approve  the  TA.

Disasters and Impact of Climate Change \n2.  Bangladesh\u2019s geographic conditions make it vulnerable to natural disasters, including \ncyclones, storms, floods, droughts, and earthquakes. Severe floods and cyclones often cause \ndamage  and  losses  on  a  massive  scale,  as  Bangladesh  is  one  of  the  10  most  densely \npopulated countries in the world. Since 1904, floods have affected millions of people and \ncaused  more  than  $10  billion  in  damage.1 Riverbank  erosion,  which  often  accompanies \nflooding, contributes to impoverishment and landlessness. Although the country experiences \nnormal flooding almost every year, the incidence of extreme floods has increased over time. \nDuring the last two decades, Bangladesh experienced four major floods in 1988, 1998, 2004, \nand 2007 (Table 1). The damage during normal monsoon floods is also sizable. A comparison \nof natural calamities illustrates that cyclones have the most devastating consequences in terms \nof casualties and losses. Over the years, several cyclones hit Bangladesh, including the major \ncyclones of 1970, 1991 and 2007.  \n \nTable 1: Major Floods in Bangladesh \nItem  1988  1998  2004  2007 \nInundated Area of Bangladesh (%)  60  68  38  42 \nDuration of Flood (days)  23  72  55  24 \nPeople Affected (million)  45  31  36  16 \nTotal Deaths (people)  2,300  1,100  750  1,071 \nLivestock Killed (number)  172,000  26,564  8,318  40,700 \nRice Production Losses (million tons)   1.65  2.06  1.00  1.30 \nRoads Damaged (kilometers)  13,000  15,927  27,970  31,533a \nNumber of Homes Fully/Partly Damaged  7.20  0.98  4.00  1.10 \n(million) \nTotal Losses (Tk billion)  83  118  134  72 \na  All categories of roads, including unpaved, and 10,311 kilometers of paved roads. \nSources: Ministries of fisheries and livestock, and food and disaster management; Asian Development Bank; and \nWorld Bank estimates. \n \n3.  Evidence of the impact of global climate change on the occurrence and magnitude of \nextreme  natural  disasters  is  increasing.  According  to  the  United  Nations  (UN)  Human \nDevelopment Report 2007/2008, Bangladesh is among the countries most affected by climate \nchange, which may cause a large-scale reversal in human development. Climate change will \naffect these countries the most by breaking down agricultural systems, worsening water supply \n                                                 \n1  According to the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, Belgium (http://www.cred.be/).  ", "2 \nscarcity, increasing risk of disease, and triggering mass displacement because of recurring \nfloods and cyclones. The UN report notes that climate change could affect more than 70 million \npeople in Bangladesh. These impacts are envisaged to increase human vulnerability to natural \ndisasters, thus emphasizing the need for improved preparedness and risk mitigation. The details \non floods and other natural disasters in Bangladesh, and damage following the 2007 floods and \ncyclone are given in Appendix 2.  \n \n2.  Disaster Management \n4.  Although Bangladesh has made huge strides in reducing fatalities from natural disasters, \nimprovements are needed in all phases of the hazard risk management cycle. Recognizing this, \nthe Government adopted a holistic and comprehensive risk management approach and strategy \n(Appendix 3). The Ministry for Food and Disaster Management (MFDM) has shifted its disaster \nmanagement  strategy  from  disaster  response  to  disaster  risk  management.  The  disaster \nmanagement strategy has three distinct features to (i) substantially reduce disaster losses in \nlives  and  social,  economic,  and  environmental  assets  of  communities  and  the  nation;  (ii) \nemphasize the integration of disaster risk considerations into national development planning \nand programs to improve sustainable development outcomes; and (iii) include specific actions to \ndevelop  stronger  institutions,  mechanisms,  and  community  capacity  to  systematically  build \nresilience to natural hazards and disasters.  \n \n5.  Several  institutions  are  involved  in  disaster  risk  management,  including  flood  risk \nmonitoring  and  mapping,  such  as  the  Geological  Survey  of  Bangladesh,  Centre  for \nEnvironmental and Geological Information System, Water Resources Planning Organization, \nand Institute of Water Modeling. A series of interrelated national and local institutions have been \ncreated to ensure effective planning and coordination of disaster management and emergency \nresponse. Detailed roles and responsibilities of all national and local disaster management \ncommittees, relevant ministries, divisions, departments, and agencies for risk reduction during \nnormal and emergency response periods are well defined. MFDM acts as the national focal \npoint  and  is  responsible  for  coordinating  national  disaster  management  efforts  across  all \ninstitutions2 through its three agencies: Disaster Management Bureau, Directorate of Relief and \nRehabilitation,  and  Directorate  General  of  Food.  MFDM  has  a  corporate  plan  setting  out \npriorities and broad strategies, and ensuring strong linkages with Government priorities for \nachievement of goals in the national poverty reduction strategy and international commitments, \nsuch as the UN Millennium Development Goals. MFDM recently prepared the National Plan for \nDisaster  Management  2007\u20132015,  which  is  in  the  final  stage  of  approval  by  the  National \nDisaster Management Council. The district offices of the deputy commissioner, the subdistrict \noffices of the upazila nirbahi officer, and the union parishads (the lowest level of administration) \nhave  crucial  roles  in  local  disaster  management.  Details  on  the  Bangladesh  disaster \nmanagement system are in Appendix 3. DFID is supporting Bangladesh to develop a national \nclimate change strategy and action plan. \n \n                                                 \n2  Agencies and institutions involved in disaster management apart from government line ministries and departments \ninclude (i) Fire Services and Civil Defense Department, (ii) Disaster Emergency Centre of Armed Forces Division, \n(iii)  Bangladesh  Meteorological  Department,  (iv)  Flood  Forecasting  and  Warning  Center,  \n(v) Bangladesh Police, (vi) Rapid Action Battalion, (vii) Cyclone Preparedness Programme, (viii) Space Research \nand Remote Sensing Organization, (ix) Geological Survey of Bangladesh, (x) Centre for Environmental and \nGeological Information System, (xi) Water Resources Planning Organization, (xii) Institute of Water Modeling, and \n(xiii) Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. \n ", "3 \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Impact of the 2007 Floods and Cyclone  \n6.  Floods occurred during two short periods over 3 months during July\u2013September 2007. \nThe first from the end of July until mid-August inundated about 30% of the country\u2019s land mass. \nThe second occurred following prolonged and heavy rainfall from the end of August to mid-\nSeptember,  flooding  about  42%  of  the  country\u2019s  land  mass.  With  slow  discharge  at  the \nChandpur  confluence  of  the  Meghna  and  Jamuna  rivers,  the  second  flooding  resulted  in \nfloodwater stagnation in the upper Meghna River basin and the lower Brahmaputra and Ganges \nriver basins. The floods covered 46 districts (40 districts in July to mid-August and an additional \n6 from the end of August to mid-September). The total death toll reached 1,071. The lack of \naccess  to  potable  water  and  sanitation  facilities,  including  contamination  of  thousands  of \ntubewells  and  damage  to  latrines  resulted  in  widespread  outbreaks  of  diarrhea  and  other \nwaterborne disease and contributed to the high death toll. \n \n7.  Floods  caused  heavy  damage  to  household  dwellings,  agriculture,  and  major \ninfrastructure: rural and municipal infrastructure, roads and bridges, and water resources. These \ninclude damage to (i) 8,891 kilometers (km) of paved rural infrastructure, including structures in \n46 districts; (ii) municipal infrastructure in 83 pourashavas (municipalities) covering urban roads, \nbridges, culverts, water supply, and drainage and sanitation systems; (iii) 1,420 km of national, \nregional,  and  district  roads,  including  115  bridges  and  culverts;  and  (iv)  water  resource \nstructures such as large and medium-scale flood control and irrigation schemes, including  \n143 km of fully damaged embankments and 1,381 km partly damaged (Appendixes 5\u20138). The \nflooding also damaged education and health services. \n8.  Cyclone Sidr occurred during 15\u201316 November 2007 and was accompanied by a tidal \nwave. The cyclone was one of the top five worst windstorms in the world, for example it was \nmore severe than the 2005 Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, United States. The cyclone hit \nthe  southern  coastal  districts  with  winds  of  more  than  250  km/hour,  severely  damaging \nhousehold dwellings, crops, livestock, shrimp farms, and infrastructure. It extensively damaged \nthe environment by uprooting trees including in the Sundarbans Reserve Forest. The cyclone \ndamage has not yet been fully assessed. The death toll from the cyclone exceeded 3,300 with \nabout 55,000 injured. The Government\u2019s advance disaster preparations limited the casualties \ncompared with the devastating cyclone of 1991 when some 143,000 were killed. Based on \npreliminary assessment, the cyclone affected about 9 million people, and destroyed or damaged \n1.2 million household dwellings in 30 districts (25 districts were affected by both floods and \ncyclone). The cyclone also damaged 2,770 km roads, 614 km of embankments, and 1,654 \nbrides and culverts, and 9,248 educational institutions (Appendix 2). \n \n9.  Economic  Impacts.  The  2007  floods  and  cyclone  affected  25  million  people  and \nresulted in more than $3 billion of damage. Based on the Government\u2019s damage and needs \nassessment and a joint ADB, Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and World Bank \nreview in November 2007, the losses to assets and output of the 2007 flooding are estimated at \nmore than $1 billion. Although not yet fully assessed, losses resulting from the cyclone are \nestimated  at  over  $2  billion.  The  floods  and  cyclone  added  pressure  to  the  economy  by \naggravating high inflation and slowing growth prospects. The disasters prompted downward \nrevision of the key macroeconomic forecast for fiscal year (FY) 2008. Gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth in FY2008 is expected to be 5.5% compared with 6.5% in FY2007. Substantial \nexternal assistance is needed to offset disaster-induced effects on economic growth, inflation, \nand external and domestic balances. As in the past, the country is likely to prove its resilience in \n ", "4 \nrecovering from the disasters. It is likely to overcome the temporary macroeconomic effects \ngiven  its  sound  macroeconomic  management,  and  well-coordinated  fiscal,  monetary,  and \nexchange rate policies.  \n \n10.  The disasters caused a setback in the agriculture sector by affecting crops, livestock, \npoultry, and fish farms. Farmers in many areas planted summer crops and vegetables after the \nfirst spell of flooding. However, in most areas, transplanted aman3 and replanted vegetables \nwere again affected by the second flooding and the cyclone. Production loss of rice is estimated \nat 1.8 million tons. Jute, sugarcane, and vegetable production suffered considerable damage. \nThe flooding and cyclone also caused damage to small-scale manufacturing, and disrupted \ntransportation and trading in affected areas.  \n \n11.  The flooding and cyclone are likely to put pressure on external and domestic balances. \nDisaster-induced  imports,  including  food  grains,  fertilizers,  and  other  agriculture  inputs  will \ncontribute to a rising trade deficit. This will increase pressure on the current account, which is \nalready under stress because of a slowdown in export growth. The fiscal deficit in FY2008 is \nexpected to rise to 5.5% of GDP compared with 3.2% in the preceding year because of the \nsurge in disaster-induced expenditures for the relief effort, expansion of food-assisted safety \nnets,  and  imports  of  food  grains  and  fertilizer.  The  increase  in  the  fiscal  deficit  will  be \nsustainable if it is accompanied by a rise in external financing. The shortfall in domestic food-\ngrain production heightened inflation, which on a point-to-point basis was at 10.1% in October \n2007, with food inflation at 11.7% and nonfood inflation at 7.4%.  \n \n12.  Social and Poverty Impacts. Despite progress, poverty remains pervasive. In 2005, \nbased on the upper poverty line, poverty incidence was 43.8% in rural areas and 28.4% in \nurban areas. A high incidence of poverty is evident in the disaster-affected districts, ranging \nfrom 26.5% to 41.9%, according to poverty mapping.4 Of the 46 districts affected by the floods, \n10 were severely affected of which 5 had chronic poverty above the national level (35.5%), as \nmeasured by the human poverty index. Chronicity of poverty, as measured by the index, in \nthese 5 districts ranged between 35.5% and 41.9%. The 2007 floods affected both poor and \nnon-poor households in urban and rural areas. However, poor households were hit harder and \nhad difficultly withstanding the negative impacts of the disasters on employment, household \nincome, health, and personal security. River erosion caused damage or loss of houses, arable \nlands, and flood protection infrastructure, which was a major reason for the inundation or \nincreasing severity of floods in many areas mainly affecting households living near major rivers \nlike  the  Brahmaputra  and  Ganges.  Disaster-induced  price  hikes  increased  the  household \nbudget deficit causing higher expenditure on food items and reducing spending on health and \nother nonfood items. Urban slum dwellers who typically live in poorly drained areas suffered \nfrom  long  periods  of  water  logging,  leading  to  increased  incidence  of  diarrhea  and  other \nwaterborne disease.  \n \n13.  The cyclone affected 30 districts, 12 severely. Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics 2005 \ndata indicate that Barisal Division had the highest incidence of poverty measured by both higher \nand lower poverty lines, and all the districts of this division were severely affected by the \ncyclone. The cyclone eroded income and purchasing power of the poor, aggravating their \neconomic and social deprivations. The cyclone-affected areas mostly depend on a single crop, \naman rice, which is usually harvested in November-January. This year\u2019s crop was substantially \n                                                 \n3  Aman, the summer rice crop, generally planted before or during monsoon season and harvested in November-\nJanuary. \n4  Based on 2004 poverty mapping carried out by Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, Dhaka, Bangladesh. \n ", "5 \ndestroyed. The impact on household food security will therefore be severe, as almost a full year \nwill be required to recover deficit rice production. The asset bases, mainly comprising cattle, \nwere also largely destroyed. These pose threats to the income generation capability of affected \nhouseholds.  \n \n14.  Environmental Impacts. The 2007 floods and cyclone had five main environmental \nimpacts: riverbank erosion, soil erosion, water logging, water contamination, and loss of trees. \nRiverbank and soil erosion was exacerbated, especially along embankments on major rivers. \nWater logging caused health risks in urbanized low-lying and flood-prone areas. Persistent \ndrainage congestion, poor solid waste management, and inadequate water and wastewater \ntreatment facilities contributed to unhygienic conditions. Uprooting of trees caused widespread \ndamage to the Sundarban Reserve Forest and other affected areas with serious environmental \nimpacts.  \n \n2.  Immediate Relief and Recovery  \n15.  The Government Response. The Government, in coordination with nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) and international organizations, successfully responded to the immediate \ndisaster emergency needs and assisted those who were affected. MFDM activated district, \nupazila (subdistrict), and union emergency response committees and established an operations \ncenter  in  Dhaka  to  closely  coordinate  relief  activities.  The  Government  deployed  military \npersonnel to help with rescue operations and the distribution of food and relief services. To \nassist the flood-affected people, the Government started a vulnerable group feeding program in \nAugust 2007 targeting 2,981,500 families. By the end of November, 133,720 tons of rice had \nbeen allocated for this program. The Government also distributed clothing and corrugated iron \nsheets, along with cash grants and house-building grants totaling about $11 million.  \n \n16.  The Government and the national and international agencies started relief operations in \nthe cyclone-devastated areas as soon as the high winds and driving rain stopped. By the end of \nNovember 2007, Tk15.4 million had been distributed as cash, 9,790 tons of rice as relief, and \nTk215 million as grants for house repairs. The Government decided to extend the food support \nto vulnerable people of the cyclone-affected districts from December 2007 through the special \nvulnerable group feeding program. About 150,233 tons of rice will be required to operate this \nprogram for 4 months to help restore livelihoods. \n \n17.  Relief Response by the International Community. The consolidated response so far \ntotals $19.5 million for flood relief, sourced from UN core funds, UN\u2019s Central Emergency \nResponse Fund, and contributions from the development partners. The UN and the Government \nconducted a joint assessment of the cyclone damage and needs, and the UN solicited an \nadditional $40 million for October 2007 to March 2008 for immediate relief and early recovery \nactivities. The Disaster and Emergency Response Subgroup (DER) of the Local Consultative \nGroup in Bangladesh has worked closely with UN agencies and meets regularly to coordinate \nthe  emergency  response  of  all  development  partners  including  multilateral  development \nagencies. DER, in coordination with several of its partner organizations, supported the damage \nand  needs  assessment.  For  flood  relief  and  rehabilitation,  the  development  partners  have \ncommitted about $150 million, including $75 million of budgetary support from the World Bank.  \n \n18.  The development partners have expanded their support to residents of cyclone-affected \nareas;  they  committed  about  $223  million  for  immediate  relief  and  rehabilitation  by  mid-\nDecember 2007. In addition, the World Bank provided $247 million to recover from floods and \ncyclone shocks. Meanwhile, the Government appealed to the development partners for support \n ", "6 \nfor  a  long-term  rehabilitation  and  development  plan  for  rebuilding  damaged  infrastructure \nincluding roads, bridges, embankments, schools, and cyclone shelters; and a reforestation \nprogram for the Sundarbans. The Government emphasizes the need for a large-scale, long-\nterm, and sustainable preventive solution to contain damage from natural disasters. \n  \n19.  ADB  Response.  ADB  responded  promptly  to  the  2007  floods.  In  late  July,  the \nBangladesh Resident Mission established a flood monitoring unit to collect key information and \nliaise with other development partners, particularly UN agencies and DER. In response to a \nGovernment  request,  ADB,  JBIC,  and  World  Bank  jointly  fielded  a  damage  and  needs \nassessment mission during 27 September\u20139 October 2007. In close collaboration with the UN \nand other development partners, the mission was to prepare a postflood recovery program. On \n19 November 2007, the Government asked the international community to help mitigate effects \nof the cyclone, resulting in ADB including cyclone mitigation measures in the project design.  \n \n3.   Disaster Damage Rehabilitation Financing Needs \n20.  The assessments estimate the need for (i) $400 million to finance early recovery from \nthe floods by rehabilitating damaged roads and bridges, railway, rural infrastructure, municipal \ninfrastructure, water infrastructure, energy, education, and health sectors; (ii) $450 million to \nfinance urgent restoration of the cyclone damage; and (iii) $1.4 billion for long-term costs of \nsustainable protection against cyclones. Speedy revival of livelihoods is also crucial to the \nrecovery process of those affected by the floods and the cyclone. Impacts on the poor and \nvulnerable,  as  well  as  on  housing,  crops,  livestock,  and  fisheries  must  be  mitigated.  In \nagriculture, the Government's focus is now on the boro rice crop5 following widespread damage \nto the aman crop. For a good boro crop, adequate agriculture inputs, namely imported fertilizer, \nare needed. In anticipation of a shortfall in food-grain production, the Government needs to \nimport at least 1.4 million tons of food grains in FY2008 compared with only 0.2 million tons in \nFY2007. Otherwise, the shortfall in food-grain availability will increase, adding to domestic price \npressures and vulnerability of the distressed people.  \n \n21.  The relief and rehabilitation efforts because of the flooding and the cyclone increased \npressure on the FY2008 budget with additional financing requirements estimated at 0.7% of \nGDP. External assistance is needed for (i) immediate relief and rehabilitation; (ii) import of food \ngrains and fertilizer; and (iii) support for speedy restoration of damaged physical infrastructure, \nincluding adoption of appropriate flood- and cyclone-resistant design standards. The financing \nneeds  for  rehabilitating  livelihoods,  facilities,  and  infrastructure  substantially  exceed  the \nGovernment's budgetary resources.  \n \n4.  Rehabilitation Assistance Program \n22.  On the basis of the Government\u2019s postflood recovery program, the UN damage and \nneeds  assessment  following  the  cyclone,  and  complementing  other  development  partners\u2019 \nefforts; the joint ADB, JBIC, and World Bank mission planned for a three-phased program. \nPhase  one  provides  immediate  recovery  assistance  (up  to  2  years)  to  address  urgent \nrehabilitation activities; phase two: medium-term recovery assistance (up to 5 years) for other \nworks  and  major  mitigation  efforts;  and  phase  three:  long-term  disaster  risk  management \nprogram. Recognizing the extensive damage to public infrastructure, ADB\u2019s timely recovery \nassistance will be critical to help the Government address the large recovery needs through the \nemergency assistance Project, covering phase 1 (up to 2 years).  \n                                                 \n5  Boro, the winter dry season crop, generally planted in December-January and harvested in April-May. \n ", "7 \n \n23.  The Government has a full understanding of possible interventions for other phases \nunder the medium- and long-term programs, especially for water resource management. For \nexample,  riverbank  stabilization  through  cost-effective  means  is  a  precursor  to  other \ninterventions. This calls for the Government\u2019s own initiatives, which the development partners \nmay support. For education, health, and railways,  recovery needs can be effectively addressed \nunder  ongoing  programs.  These  include  the  Railway  Sector  Investment  Program  (jointly \nsupported by ADB, JBIC, and World Bank), and the two large sectorwide program approaches \nsupported by several development partners led by ADB in primary education (Second Primary \nEducation  Development  Program)  and  the  World  Bank  in  health  (Health,  Nutrition,  and \nPopulation Support Program). Similarly, ongoing microcredit programs operated by NGOs, such \nas  PKSF,  could  effectively  channel  credit  to  vulnerable  groups,  including  the  poor.6 The \nGovernment also emphasizes the need to revamp the national cyclone coping strategy. The \ndevelopment partners will assist the Government's large-scale and long-term rehabilitation and \ndevelopment  plan  for  disaster  management.  The  Government  stresses  that  the  external \nassistance for long-term disaster management can be modeled in line with the partnership \nframework for the urban water supply and sanitation sector for Dhaka and Chittagong, jointly \nsupported by ADB, Danish International Development Agency (Danida), the Government of \nJapan, the Government of the Republic of Korea, and the World Bank.7 \n  \n24.  ADB Strategy. ADB\u2019s current country strategy and program8 for Bangladesh prepared \njointly with the Department for International Development (United Kingdom), Government of \nJapan, and the World Bank noted the country\u2019s vulnerability to natural disasters. It emphasizes \n(i) mitigating and managing future floods rather than attempting to prevent them completely; (ii) \nfostering a culture of disaster prevention and resilience at all levels; and (iii) promoting a \ncombination of international, regional, and national interventions to reduce disaster risks and \nimprove mitigation capacity. ADB, in close cooperation with other development partners, is \nsupporting public policies aimed at better preparedness, and adjusting and adapting to regular \nflooding, rather than intervening to alter the natural hydrology, with the exception of selective \nsupport for flood control structures in major urban centers. Recently approved ADB assisted \nprojects have mainstreamed disaster-risk considerations by ensuring that disaster risks are \nassessed during project preparation, designing projects that can withstand anticipated flooding \nand cyclone, and including site-specific disaster control measures.  \n \n25.  One critical issue is to enhance early warning capability by improving flood forecasting \nand increasing accuracy of predictions, adapted to the various needs at different levels, sectors, \nand organizations; and providing stakeholders including the poor and vulnerable groups with \nearly and easily understandable information (see para. 31). Increased regional cooperation and \nsharing of meteorological and hydrological data among countries in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-\nMeghna river basins is essential to reduce the risk and increase preparedness for disasters \nincluding floods. ADB will base its medium- to long-term postflood assistance on the country \nstrategy and program, which identifies disaster preparedness and mitigation as a key priority to \nassist the Government in operationalizing a comprehensive flood forecasting strategy.  \n \n                                                 \n6\n  The World Bank proposes to extend $50 million through PKSF for livelihood restoration of the extremely poor \nunder its postcyclone rehabilitation assistance.  \n7  ADB. 2007.

In  formulating  ADB\u2019s  disaster  recovery \nassistance  program,  Government  capacity,  possibility  for  loan  portfolio  restructuring,  and \npotential use of loan savings under ongoing projects were carefully assessed in line with ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Disaster and Emergency Assistance (2004).9 The portfolio assessment was made in \nlight of the intensified country portfolio review10 and regular project review, particularly during \nthe last 4 years, and in close coordination with concerned Government agencies. Since 2001, \nADB has placed particular emphasis on regularly identifying and canceling Asian Development \nFund (ADF) loan savings by examining physical and financial progress of ongoing projects and \nadjusting their scope and design. Thus, the scope for identifying additional loan savings by \nrestructuring the existing ADF loan portfolio is limited. Nonetheless, savings identified under \nnine projects, amounting to $50 million, were canceled for utilization under the Project.11 \n \n27.  Governance  and  Corruption.  Despite  efforts  by  successive  governments,  weak \ngovernance continues to be a challenge. Efforts in poverty reduction and broad-based economic \ngrowth are constrained by lack of accountability, transparency, predictability, and opportunities \nfor  citizens  to  participate  in  public  decision-making.  Despite  a  consensus  view  on  key \ngovernance constraints and steps to be taken to address them, until the installation of the \ncurrent caretaker Government in January 2007, only modest progress was made in addressing \ncorruption, restoring law and order, and reducing public administrative malaise. The caretaker \nGovernment has demonstrated its strong commitment to pursuing critical governance reforms, \nwith a focus on ensuring free and fair elections, combating corruption, ensuring the separation \nand independence of the judiciary, and improving efficiency and neutrality of the civil service. \nFighting corruption is high on its agenda. It reconstituted the Anti-Corruption Commission with \ncompetent commissioners; framed new laws to tackle corruption; and has taken tough legal and \nprosecutorial actions against a number of politicians, public officials, and businesspeople. The \ncaretaker Government has also acceded to the United Nations Convention against Corruption. \nIn a landmark development, effective 1 November 2007, it separated the judiciary from the \nexecutive in accordance with provisions of the Constitution. The caretaker Government has \nreconstituted the Public Service Commission with a new chairperson and members to remove \ncorruption  and  political  patronage,  and  ensure  neutrality  in  civil  service  recruitment  and \npromotions.  \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2004.

ADB is currently providing TA to the Government to build the capacity of the Anti-\nCorruption Commission12 and provide support for preparing a national integrity strategy.13 The \nrecently approved Good Governance Program14 will support implementation of comprehensive \npolicy reforms in the Anti-Corruption Commission, judiciary, and other institutions to strengthen \nthe Government\u2019s core and sector anticorruption measures. Public procurement, which is an \narea generally associated with high corruption, is undergoing a major reform program supported \nby ADB, World Bank, and other development partners following the new public procurement \nregulations that became effective in October 2003. At the sector level, ADB has assisted in \npreparing anticorruption strategies and vulnerability to corruption assessments, starting with \nChittagong Port Authority and Bangladesh Railway. The training provided under a TA to the \nForeign-Aided Projects Audit Directorate of the Comptroller and Auditor General of Bangladesh \nsupported strengthening of financial management and auditing.15 The TA was also providing \ncapacity  building  and  support  to  strengthen  the  Implementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation \nDivision (IMED) of the Ministry of Planning.  \n \n29.  The proposed Project incorporates several specific anticorruption measures, including  \n(i)  strict  financial  management  with  strengthened  Government  monitoring  and  independent \nmonitoring by a TA consultant, (ii) use of detailed subproject selection criteria, (iii) third party \nscrutiny of all subprojects, (iv) strong project supervision with appropriate consultancy input,  \n(v) regular independent performance and financial auditing to monitor project implementation, \n(vi) delegation of ADB\u2019s project administration responsibility to the Bangladesh Resident Mission \nfor  close  monitoring  and  supervision,  and  (vii)  random  and  independent  spot  checks  of \nimplementation by ADB and consultants. Experience with portfolio management in Bangladesh, \nincluding  the  successful  implementation  of  the  Emergency  Flood  Damage  Rehabilitation \nProject16 completed on schedule in mid-2007, shows that anticorruption measures need to be \naddressed under emergency projects. \n \n30.

To support risk reduction, ADB has provided assistance to mitigate the impact of future \ndisasters  including  floods.20 Encouragingly,  the  Government  shows  full  ownership  of  the \nenvisaged  22  high-priority  interventions  recommended  under  the  Early  Warning  Systems \nStudies TA (footnote 20) for improved water resources and flood management. International \nexperience  in  disaster  management  and  new  global  initiatives,  such  as  the  2005  Hyogo \nFramework of Action21 and review of implementation of the Hyogo Framework of Action at the \n1st and 2nd Asian ministerial conferences on disaster risk reduction (September 2005 in Beijing, \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, and November 2007 in New Delhi, India, respectively) emphasize \nthe need to develop disaster risk reduction measures. These include incorporating resilience in \nreconstruction projects, and developing preventive measures and include them in planning and \ndevelopment processes. These lessons were considered and incorporated in the design of the \nproposed Project.  \n \nBoard of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Southwest Flood Damage \nRehabilitation Project.

The framework defines strategic goals for reducing disaster losses to \nbe achieved for 2005\u20132015 and has 168 countries and international agencies (including ADB) as signatories.    \n ", "11 \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n32.  The  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  contribute  to  sustainable  economic  growth  by \nminimizing the devastating impact of the severe floods and cyclone, and reducing future risk \nfrom similar disasters. It will contribute to quick restoration of economic and social activity in the \n51 districts for 25 million people seriously affected by the floods and cyclone. The Project will \nfocus on rehabilitating infrastructure, improving access to health and education facilities and \nmarkets, and augmenting incomes and self-reliance. The Project includes mitigation of damage \nfrom future recurrent floods and cyclones by enhancing cost-effective construction specifications \nof rehabilitated infrastructure, and supporting capacity building and the Government\u2019s disaster \npreparedness; and improvement to the early warning systems in cooperation with neighboring \ncountries.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n33.  The Project comprises five parts: A, quick-disbursing component; B, rural infrastructure \ncomponent;  C,  municipal  infrastructure  component;  D,  roads  component;  and  E,  water \nresources  component.  In  addition,  a  TA  grant  of  $200,000  will  provide  for  a  procurement \nperformance audit, financial management and monitoring, and third party scrutiny of subproject \nselection and implementation. The Project will incorporate disaster risk reduction strategies, and \nstrengthen partnerships and synergies with other development partners. \n \n34.  Part  A:  Quick-Disbursing  Component.  The  component  will  help  the  Government \nthrough import financing of essential commodities and inputs to mitigate the adverse impact of \nthe 2007 floods and cyclone on agriculture and livelihood. It will provide $75.56 million as quick-\ndisbursing assistance to meet the Government\u2019s additional financing requirement for imports. In \naccordance with ADB's Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, the financing will only be \nused  for  essential  imports  identified  for  an  effective  postflood  and  postcyclone  recovery \nprogram. The Government and ADB have agreed on a list of permissible imports for financing  \n(Appendix 4). \n \n35.  Part B: Rural Infrastructure Component. The component will have an estimated total \ncost of $33.57 million. It will rehabilitate and restore rural infrastructure in 23 districts, including \n3,000 km of rural roads (damaged paved upazila and union roads) and 9,000 meters of bridges \nand culverts. Improved slope protection works at vulnerable points and provision of additional \ndrainage facilities will provide preventive measures for future flood damage. 300 flood, cyclone \nshelters and livestock shelters will be constructed, repaired, and provided with latrines to help \ncommunities,  especially  the  poor,  during  future  floods.  The  design  standard  is  based  on \nimproved Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) standards as developed by the \nProject (Appendix 5). \n \n36.  Part C: Municipal Infrastructure Component. The component will rehabilitate urban \ninfrastructure,  including  roads,  drains,  bridges  and  culverts,  and  footpaths,  located  in  30 \npourashavas. The works include approximately 700 km of roads, 65 km of drains, and 850 \nmeters of bridges and culverts, at an estimated total cost of $20.89 million. The design standard \nis based on improved LGED standards as developed by the Project (Appendix 6). \n \n ", "12 \n37.  Part D: Roads Component. The component will rehabilitate 800 km of flood-damaged \nnational, regional, and district roads and 64 bridges and culverts, within the country\u2019s seven \nroad zones: Barisal, Comilla, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet at an estimated \ntotal cost of $46.43 million. The design standard is based on improved Roads and Highways \nDepartment standards as developed by the Project; and includes, where technically feasible \nand justified, improvements to mitigate the impact of future floods and cyclones, e.g., improved \nslope protection, raising road height above highest flooding level, or allowing additional vents \nwhere water logging leads to overtopping (Appendix 7). \n \n38.  Part E: Water Resources Component. The Bangladesh Water Development Board \nhas identified 331 subprojects in 47 districts (including coastal zone) with an estimated total cost \nof $31.70 million for this component. It includes urgent rehabilitation and improvement works to \nlarge  and  medium-scale  infrastructure  of  flood  control,  drainage,  and  irrigation  facilities  to \nrestore, improve, and reduce future disaster impacts. These facilities include embankments; \nflood  control,  drainage,  and  irrigation  canal  and  structures;  and  protective  works  including \ngroynes,22 spurs,23 and hard points.24 Restoration works include filling embankment breaches, \nresectioning, constructing protective works, and protecting damaged embankments (Appendix \n8). \n \nC.  Special Features \n39.  Consultation,  Coordination,  and  Partnerships.  The  Project  was  formulated  and \nprepared  in  close  consultation  with  the  Government  and  development  partners  active  in \nBangladesh. The project design considers feedback from beneficiaries, including vulnerable \ngroups, during the damage and needs assessment; and is based on the joint damage and \nneeds assessment of the Government, ADB, JBIC and the World Bank in close coordination \nand consultation with other development partners including United Kingdom's Department for \nInternational Development (DFID), the UN and its agencies, and bilateral development partners. \nThe  damage  and  needs  assessment  especially  utilized  work  done  by  DER.  Project \nimplementation will be closely coordinated with the World Bank, UN agencies, and bilateral aid \nagencies; sharing review mission information and progress reporting; and closely monitoring \nand  coordinating  activities,  including  anticorruption  measures.  The  Project  will  be  closely \ncoordinated with the Comprehensive Disaster Management Program implemented by MFDM \nand financed by the United Nations Development Programme, DFID, and European Union. \nParticipation of beneficiaries including the poor, local government institutions, and NGOs in \nsubproject identification, implementation, operation, and maintenance of improved infrastructure \nwill  be  ensured  during  project  implementation.  Local  poor  will  be  involved  in  construction, \noperation, and maintenance activities. \n \n40.  Disaster Risk Reduction and Mitigation. The Project underpins the Government\u2019s \nefforts to increase its preparedness and ability to mitigate future flood and cyclone damage. It \nsupports efforts to enhance Government capacity to develop and adopt improved and more \ncost-effective  flood  and  cyclone-resistant  infrastructure  design  standards;  and  incorporates \nmainstreaming of design standards, such as improved drainage and slope protection, in four \nkey infrastructure sectors/subsectors: rural and municipal, road infrastructure, water resources, \n                                                 \n22 A rigid hydraulic structure built out from the shore (in coastal engineering) or from the bank (in rivers) and interrupts \nthe flow of water and sediment \n23 River engineering structure that is projected from the bank of a stream at some angle to the main flow direction to \ndivert the flow of the river towards the main stream. \n24 Very short rock wall, constructed as a defense or as a boundary, that is used to stabilize a certain location of a river \nbank. \n ", "13 \nand irrigation and drainage. It also integrates rationalization of flood control and drainage, and \nutilizes  new  technologies,  such  as  cost-effective  embankment  protection  using  geotextile \nsandbags  and  including  erosion  prediction.  International cooperation  is  needed  to  address \nenvironmental catastrophes that largely emerge from the global phenomenon of climate change. \nADB will work closely with other development partners to support long-term solutions.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n41.  The project investment cost is estimated at $220 million, including taxes and duties of \n$20.5 million financed by the Government (Table 2). Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 9. \n \nTable 2: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.  Base Costb   \n  1.  Part A: Quick-Disbursing Component  75.56 \n  2.

The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  Special  Drawing  Rights  75,899,000 \n(equivalent to $120 million) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the Project. \nThe loan will carry interest of 1.0% per annum and maturity of 40 years, including a grace period \nof 10 years, with repayment of principal at 2% per year for the first 10 years after the grace \nperiod and 4% thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan \nagreement.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  available  to  all  the  EAs  through  budgetary \nallocations.  \n \n43.  Out of the remaining project cost of $100 million, the Government will provide $30 million \nequivalent and other cofinanciers are expected to finance $70 million equivalent. \n \n44.  Cofinancing Opportunities. An underlying objective of ADB's Disaster and Emergency \nAssistance Policy is to coordinate with development partners, minimize duplication, encourage \ncofinancing, and have a catalytic effect on the provision of additional resources. Several of \nthese partners may be willing to complement ADB's funds for the Project through cofinancing. \nADB has typically sought Board approval for the administration of loan or grant funds from \n ", "14 \ncofinanciers only when cofinancing commitments are in place. ADB has received indications \nfrom several development partners of their interest in providing loans and grants to finance the \nProject. JBIC indicates that it proposes to provide a loan of $60 million equivalent and the \nCanadian International Development Agency a grant of $10 million equivalent; however formal \ncommitment  to  provide  such  financing  is  expected  after  Board  consideration.25 As  it  is \nenvisaged that cofinancing in the form of loans and/or grants will be provided from donors, \nwhich ADB will be requested to administer, the scope of the Project reflects this likely additional \nfunding. In the event such financing does not materialize, the Project scope will be adjusted to \naccommodate  available  financing.  Given  the  need  for  expediency  and  efficiency  in  ADB's \nresponse  to  the  disaster  and  emergency,  Management  requests  Board  approval  of  the \nadministration of these and any other cofinanced funds obtained from development partners \nsubsequent  to  the  date  of  Board  approval.  Management  will  confirm  and  approve  such \ncofinanced  funds,  and  report  to  the  Board  in  accordance  with  the  standard  reporting \nprocedures. This procedure will be adopted only to the extent that the additional funds provided \nby cofinanciers will not materially alter or fundamentally affect the objectives, purposes, and \nscope of the Project. Any proposed cofinancing that would materially affect the objectives, \npurpose, or scope of the Project will be processed as a major change of scope and circulated to \nthe Board in accordance with ADB's Project Administration Instructions 5.04 and the usual \npractice.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management and Coordination \n45.  Following  the  practice  adopted  for  the  ADB-financed  Emergency  Flood  Damage \nRehabilitation  Project  responding  to  the  2004  floods  (see  footnote  16),  overall  project \ncoordination will be provided by the previously established Project Steering Committee (PSC), \nchaired  by  the  member,  Programming  Division,  Planning  Commission.  The  PSC  includes \nrepresentation  from  the  Agricultural  and  Physical  Infrastructure  Divisions  of  the  Planning \nCommission; Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives; Ministry of \nWater Resources; Ministry of Food and Disaster Management; and Ministry of Communications, \nof at least joint secretary level. Development partners may be invited by the Government to \nattend PSC meetings, and issues related to the development partners will be communicated by \nEconomic Relations Division (ERD) on a timely basis. In support of timely subproject approval \nprocedures, the same simplified Government procedures will be followed as were used under \npast ADB-financed flood damage rehabilitation projects, which greatly helped to expedite project \n                                                 \n25  The Government of the Netherlands has also expressed interest in providing $20 million of cofinancing for the \nProject.  \n ", "15 \nimplementation. The PSC will provide input to the discussion on phase two: medium-term \nrecovery assistance (up to 5 years) for other works and major mitigation efforts; and phase \nthree: long-term disaster risk management program (paras. 22 and 23). It will also monitor the \ncontinued implementation of the 22 high-priority interventions recommended under the Early \nWarning Systems Studies TA (para. 31) to improve early warning systems in cooperation with \nneighboring upstream countries. ADB will work closely with other development partners to \nsupport long-term solutions to climate change (see para. 5). The project management structure \nis given in Appendix 10. \n \n46.  The EAs for the Projects will be the following: part A, quick-disbursing component: \nFinance Division, Ministry of Finance; part B, rural infrastructure: LGED; part C, municipal \ninfrastructure:  LGED;  part  D,  roads:  Roads  and  Highways  Department;  and  part  E,  water \nresources: Bangladesh Water Development Board. \n \n47.  Each EA will be responsible in its respective sector/subsector for (i) selection of all \nsubprojects and approval of subprojects not exceeding $200,000 equivalent, (ii) design of civil \nworks, (iii) preparation of tender documents for civil works and goods, (iv) appointment of \nconsultants, and (v) submission of progress reports to the PSC and ADB. For efficiency, existing \nproject management units (PMUs) and project implementation units established in each EA \nunder the Emergency Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project (see footnote 16) will be utilized, \nand provided with adequate staff, resources, and logistical support. The project implementation \narrangements are in Appendixes 5\u20138. \n \n48.  To ensure timely implementation, ADB will delegate responsibility for ADB\u2019s project \nadministration  to  ADB\u2019s  Bangladesh  Resident  Mission,  which  has  extensive  experience  in \nadministering similar projects, and will closely monitor compliance with ADB\u2019s requirements \nunder the Project to ensure quality control, and accelerated implementation of subprojects \nthrough close follow-up and guidance to the EAs on project implementation matters. \n \n2.  Subproject Selection Criteria and Approval \n49.  Subprojects under parts B\u2013E will be identified and selected in accordance with sector-\nspecific  criteria  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB  for  each  project  component \n(Appendixes 5\u20138). In addition, each subproject proposal will be selected on the basis of the \nfollowing general criteria: \n \n(i)  The subproject will rehabilitate or restore damaged infrastructure and facilities \ncaused  by  the  2007  floods  and  cyclone  based  on  the  damage  and  needs \nassessment (Appendix 2) and validated by ADB.  \n(ii)  Baseline data of subproject conditions, risk assessment before project startup, \nand established performance indicators are considered in subproject selection. \n(iii)  Views of available professional expertise of ADB, cofinanciers, or their related \ntechnical  assistance  on  flood  and  cyclone  resistant  design  is  appropriately \nreflected in subproject design. \n(iv)  The subproject does not involve deferred maintenance, unless such maintenance \nwill substantially reduce the prospect of damage from recurrence of floods and \ncyclones.  \n(v)  The  subproject  will  incorporate  appropriate  cost-effective,  flood  and  cyclone \nresistant design standards to the extent possible, with adequate provision for \nquality control.  \n ", "16 \n(vi)  The subproject is technically feasible and cost-effective, and represents a least-\ncost alternative with appropriate adjustment for incorporating flood and cyclone \nresistant designs. \n(vii)  The subproject incorporates beneficiary consultation and input in the selection \nprocess. \n(viii)  The subproject will be completed within the project implementation period.  \n(ix)  The  subproject  will  not  be  financed  by  another  agency,  unless  ADB  is  a \ncofinancier. \n(x)  Priority will be given to subprojects that rehabilitate completed ADB-financed \nprojects. \n(xi)  The  subproject  will  comply  with  the  Government's  environmental  protection \nregulations and ADB's environment policies. The procedure to comply with these \nenvironmental requirements was formulated in the environmental assessment \nand  review  framework  prepared  in  close  consultation  with  the  EAs.  For \nsubprojects requiring an initial environmental examination (IEE), the IEE will be \nprepared  and  included  in  the  subproject  proposal.  Government  environment \nclearance, if required, will be obtained prior to commencing civil work.  \n(xii)  Subprojects  are  not  expected  to  involve  any  land  acquisition  or  involuntary \nresettlement.  If  either  is  required  during  the  Project,  it  will  be  conducted  in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement: A \nGuide  to  Good  Practice  (1998),  and  the  agreed  resettlement  framework \n(Appendix 11) prior to commencing civil works.  \n \n50.  The EAs will prepare subproject proposals in formats agreed to by the Government and \nADB.  The  PMU  concerned  will  be  responsible  for  preparation,  submission,  approval, \nimplementation, and benefits monitoring and evaluation of all subprojects.                                                            \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n51.  As the Project is for emergency assistance, project implementation will be substantially \ncompleted in 30 months i.e., tentatively by 30 June 2010. Because of the inability to undertake \ncivil works during the wet season the project period was extended with 6 months beyond the 2-\nyear project period generally expected under the ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance \nPolicy  (2004).  The  agreed  implementation  schedule  recognizes  the  critical  importance  of \nrestoring key infrastructure as much as possible before the onset of the next rainy season in \nJuly  2008,  and  builds  upon  ADB\u2019s  past  implementation  experience  with  flood  damage \nrehabilitation projects. The EAs submitted work plans to ADB during loan negotiations covering \nthe next dry season up to the end of June 2008. The implementation schedule is in Appendix \n12. \n \n4.  Procurement \n52.  Procurement of works, goods, and services will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  ADB\u2019s  procedures  for  providing  rehabilitation  assistance  after \ndisasters provide for flexible interpretation of these guidelines, so that project activities can start \npromptly. National procurement will be the preferred mode for all civil works because of the \nrelatively short implementation period, small size of contract packages, wide geographic spread \nof the project sites, and need for local awareness and community participation. \n \n ", "17 \n53.  None of the Project\u2019s individual civil works contracts is expected to exceed $3 million. \nProcurement of civil works contracts with estimated values greater than $3 million, if any, will be \nin  accordance  with  international  competitive  bidding  procedures,  contracts  with  estimated \nvalues of $3 million or less will be in accordance with national competitive bidding procedures, \nand generally be in accordance with the Government\u2019s Public Procurement Regulations 2003 \n(PPR), Public Procurement Act 2006, and ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).26 The  PPR  are  generally  acceptable  to  ADB  for  national  competitive \nprocurement procedures and were successfully used in past ADB-financed projects, including \nthe  2005  Emergency  Flood  Damage  Rehabilitation  Project  (footnote  16).  ADB\u2019s  portfolio \nexperience  in  Bangladesh  indicates  that  national  contractors  have  adequate  capacity  to \nundertake such contracts. ADB will review and approve the first two civil works contracts of \neach EA estimated to cost less than $200,000. Once ADB is satisfied with the EAs\u2019 procurement \nprocedures, post-facto approval procedures will be followed. ADB will review and approve all \ncontracts with estimated values exceeding $200,000 equivalent. National competitive bidding for \ncivil  works  will  follow  the  single-stage,  one-envelope  procedure  with  postqualification  and \nbidding period of 21 days. Urgent works will follow the direct procurement method specified in \nthe PPR and ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines.27 To encourage the participation of communities \nand local residents, especially women, and provide them with employment opportunities, small \nearthworks with an estimated cost of $8,000 or less may be awarded, in line with past practices \nfor projects of a similar nature, to labor-contracting societies in accordance with procedures \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n54.  Equipment and materials will be procured under international competitive bidding where \nthe  estimated  cost  is  more  than  $500,000  equivalent;  shopping  will  be  used  where  the \nestimated cost is less than $100,000 and national competitive bidding (or for smaller packages \nwhere  appropriate,  limited  international  bidding)  procedures  where  the  estimated  cost  is \nbetween $100,000 and $500,000. The procurement plan is in Appendix 13. \n \n55.  The Government and each EA will strictly adhere to the PPR\u2019s specified time limits for \nevaluating and awarding contracts. Contract variations will be discouraged and be subject to \nprior ADB approval, except in special circumstances for particular contracts for strong technical \nand economic reasons to maximize social and economic benefits. \n \n5.  Advance Action \n56.  Given the urgency of the Project, ADB approved advance action for the procurement of \ngoods, services, and works and the recruitment of consultants, provided the advance actions \ntake  place  on  or  after  27  September  2007,  the  starting  date  for  the  damage  and  needs \nassessment  and  project  fact-finding.  ADB  advised  the  Government  that  approval  of  such \nadvance action does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project. \n \n6.  Retroactive Financing \n57.  The  Project  provides  for  retroactive  financing  of  immediate  rehabilitation  of  key \ninfrastructure and facilities and for consulting services. ADB management has agreed to provide \n                                                 \n26  The PPR, adopted by the Government in October 2003, provide a major step forward to more efficient and \ntransparent procurement. They entail comprehensive reform of all aspects of procurement and are supported by \nADB and other development partners active in Bangladesh. In the event of any conflict between the PPR and/or \nthe Public Procurement Act 2006 and ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, the latter will apply. \n27  Urgent restoration works are works that can be completed within 3 months before 1 May 2008. Direct contracting \nas specified in Section 3.6 of ADB's Procurement Guidelines can be applied in such cases.    \n ", "18 \nretroactive financing for a maximum 30% of the total loan amount for eligible expenditures \nincurred not earlier than 27 September 2007 (date of project fact-finding), provided that the \nexpenditures are in accordance with agreed procedures, are certified by the EAs, and the \ncertification is acceptable to ADB. Retroactive financing will be approved under the following \nconditions: (i) in accordance with agreed procedures, (ii) verified by ADB, (iii) certified by the \nEAs, and (iv) the certification is acceptable to ADB. ADB advised the Government that provision \nof retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project. \n \n7.  Consulting Services \n58.  Given the tight implementation schedule, the EAs\u2019 uneven institutional capacity, and the \nneed for accelerated project implementation, consulting services will be required to support \nproject implementation. Four design and supervision consultant packages, one for each of parts \nB\u2013E, are included with a total of 178 person-months of international consulting and 1,905 \nperson-months of national consulting services. The person-months are estimated for a project \nscope that includes cofinancing. The four consultant packages will be procured using three \ncontracts,  one  for  each  EA  (procurement  plan  in  Appendix  13  and  terms  of  reference  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  A).  The  consultants  will  support  the  EAs  with  day-to-day  project \nimplementation,  including  (i)  detailed  assessment  and  verification  of  damage  in  each \nsector/subsector; (ii) preparation of environmental assessment reports and implementation of \nenvironmental  management  for  individual  subprojects;  (iii)  identification,  prioritization,  and \nformulation of subprojects; (iv) detailed surveys and damage assessment; (v) preparation of \nplans,  designs,  specifications,  and  cost  estimates  including  cost-effective  enhancement  of \nspecifications  to  strengthen  flood  and  cyclone  resistance;  (vi)  rapid  planning,  design,  and \nimplementation of the works; (vii) preparation of tender and contract documents; (viii) evaluation \nof bids and contract awards; (ix) supervision of construction quality, cost and schedule control, \nmeasurement, and approval of contractor\u2019s work and progress claims; (x) monitoring of works to \nensure  quality  control  and  transparency  among  contractors  and  communities  carrying  out \nsmaller  works;  (xi)  issuance  of  completion  certificates;  (xii)  oversight  of  works  in  each \nsector/subsector and provision of detailed accounting, auditing, and reporting to the PMUs and \nADB; (xiii) preparation of subproject appraisal reports in accordance with Government and ADB \nrequirements  and  selection  criteria;  and  (xiv)  assessment  of  EA  capacity  and  subsequent \ntraining  of  EA  and  PMU  staff  in  methodology  and  procedures  for  damage  and  needs \nassessment, project supervision, appropriate flood and cyclone resistant design standards, risk \nmanagement, and related areas. In addition, the EAs will engage NGOs for implementing and \nmonitoring any resettlement activities, if necessary. \n \n59.  The EA concerned will engage all consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of national consultants. Since the Project must be \ncompleted within 30 months, expeditious selection and fielding of the design and construction \nsupervision consultants will be necessary. Accordingly, ADB has agreed with the Government \non single-source selection of consultants. General conditions for direct selection of consultants \nrequire that the consultants (i) be currently engaged in ongoing ADB-financed projects within the \nEA concerned, or have prior substantial and satisfactory experience with previous ADB-financed \nflood  damage  rehabilitation  projects  in  Bangladesh;  (ii)  have  capacity  to  deploy  needed \nexpertise of relevance and quality at short notice; and (iii) have been selected for ongoing \nprojects following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and have performed satisfactorily \npursuant to the terms of such prior engagements. These arrangements provide for efficient \nrecruitment of consultants under the circumstances. The Government has requested and ADB \nhas agreed to select consultants on behalf of the Government. Consultants\u2019 performance will be \n ", "19 \nclosely  monitored,  with  particular  attention  to  quality  of  work  and  vigilance  in  the  field  to \naccelerate contract execution for timely completion, as per agreed contract period. Continuity of \nkey consultants and senior field engineers should be strictly adhered to, in accordance with \nagreed personnel schedule and work program in respective consultant contract. \n \n8.  Anticorruption Policy \n60.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  EAs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB under the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the EAs and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n61.  ADB will closely monitor anticorruption measures undertaken by the PSC and EAs, carry \nout random and spot checks on procurement and accounts of the Project and subprojects, and \ninspect  facilities  rehabilitated  under  the  Project  for  quality  control.  Adopted  anticorruption \nmeasures were designed based on portfolio implementation experience and preliminary outputs \nunder ongoing TAs supporting good governance (para. 28). They include (i) strict financial \nmanagement with strengthened Government monitoring and independent monitoring under the \nattached TA for financial management and monitoring (para. 68), (ii) use of detailed subproject \nselection criteria, (iii) strong project supervision with appropriate consultancy input, (iv) regular \nindependent performance auditing, and (v) random and independent spot checks by ADB and \nproject consultants. \n \n9.  Disbursement Arrangements \n62.  Unless otherwise described here in the specifics, all disbursements of parts A\u2013E will be \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \nThree imprest accounts, one for each of parts B, C, and E, will be established in Bangladesh \nBank. The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure will be used to reimburse expenditures \nand reimburse/liquidate advances under an imprest account, and be applicable to individual \npayments of $100,000 and less. The concerned EA will be responsible for managing and \nadministering  its  respective  imprest  account  and  SOE  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. The specific additional details relating to each part are as follows: \n \n(i)  Part A. Disbursement of the quick-disbursing component will be based on the list \nof  permissible  imports  (Appendix  4).  Withdrawal  applications  must  be \naccompanied by a certificate of the beneficiary confirming that the value of the \neligible imports is greater than the loan amount claimed for disbursement. \n(ii)  Parts B, C, and E. The initial advances to the imprest accounts will be 6 months \nof  estimated  expenditures  or  20%  of  the  loan  amount  corresponding  to  the \nrespective part. \n(iii)  Part  D.  Disbursement  procedures  will  follow  the  current  practices  for  ADB-\nfinanced road projects with the Roads and Highways Department. Accordingly, \nno  imprest  account  will  be  established.  All  other  disbursement  procedures, \nincluding the SOE procedure, will be applicable. \n \n ", "20 \n10.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n63.  Accounts and Audit. Each EA will maintain records and accounts adequate to identify \nthe  goods  and  services  financed  by  the  loan  proceeds,  financing  received,  expenditures \nincurred, and use of local funds. The accounts will be maintained in accordance with sound \naccounting principles. Consolidated project accounts and related financial statements will be \naudited annually by the comptroller and auditor general of the Government, acceptable to ADB. \nThe audited reports and related financial statements in English should provide an audit opinion \non the financial operations of imprest accounts and SOEs and be submitted to ADB not later \nthan 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate.  \n \n64.  In addition to the Government audit, ADB will conduct project procurement audits during \nimplementation as part of its regular reviews. \n \n65.  Reports. While the PSC will monitor overall implementation progress, each EA will \nprepare brief progress statements and submit these to the PSC with a copy to ADB at the end \nof each month. In addition, each EA will submit quarterly reports to the PSC and ADB. Within 3 \nmonths of physical completion of the Project, the Government will provide ADB through the PSC \nan overall project completion report providing a detailed evaluation of the project design, costs, \ncontractor  and  consultant  performance,  social  and  economic  impact,  and  other  details  as \nrequested by ADB. \n \n11.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n66.  Each  EA  will  carry  out  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Baseline \nindicators and targets for each sector and subproject will be developed prior to implementation \nfor monitoring purposes as well as for checking against selection criteria. The outputs will \nprovide inputs to the Project\u2019s quarterly progress reporting. \n \n12.  Project Review \n67.  ADB will conduct regular reviews throughout project implementation. Given the relatively \nshort implementation period and emergency nature of the Project, no midterm review will be \nconducted unless ADB and the Government deem it necessary. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n68.  IMED, the Implementing Agency for the TA, will appoint a project director at the joint \nsecretary level. The TA will support the PSC, chaired by the member, Programming Division, \nPlanning Commission. The PSC will be actively involved during TA implementation, discussing \nand reviewing TA findings, and providing guidance on various matters. The TA will help the \nGovernment build capacity in (i) financial management and related areas to effectively carry out \nmonitoring  functions;  (ii)  evaluation  of  project  performance;  and  (iii)  third  party  scrutiny  of \nsubprojects, and performance of EAs and loan consultants. The TA will design a monitoring and \nevaluation  strategy,  risk  assessment  approach,  and  assessment  of  cost-effectiveness;  and \nprovide support in performance assessment.  \n \n69.  ADB will provide a grant of $200,000 to finance the TA from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \nThe  Government  will  provide  in-kind  funding  including  counterparts,  office,  and  necessary \ninformation and documents estimated at $45,000. The TA will commence on 15 February 2008 \nand  be  completed  by  30  June  2010.  The  TA  team  will  consist  of  two  national  individual \n ", "21 \nconsultants working in parallel: a financial management specialist intermittently for 24 person-\nmonths and an engineer specialist intermittently for 24 person-months. ADB will recruit the \nconsultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  or  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging national consultants. Outline terms of reference \nfor the consultants are in Appendix 14. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Benefits \n70.  Given  the  emergency  nature  of  the  Project,  previous  economic  analysis  of  similar \nprojects was compared, no new analysis was undertaken at appraisal. Based on experience \nfrom  similar  earlier  projects  providing  emergency  assistance,  the  project  components  are \nexpected to be technically feasible and cost-effective, and represent a least-cost alternative with \nappropriate  adjustment  for  flood  and  cyclone  resistant  designs.  Based  on  initial  damage \nassessment, and considering the project completion report and project performance audit report \nfindings of past flood and cyclone damage rehabilitation projects in Bangladesh, the economic \ninternal rate of return for subprojects is expected to substantially exceed 12%. Reevaluation of \nsimilar components involving rehabilitation of major roads found economic internal rates of \nreturn range from 25.59% to 47.76%.28 The economic benefits of the restoration activities are \nthose accrued at the time of initial construction, but are mostly lost because of flood and cyclone \ndamage. Project-financed restoration will bring infrastructure back to original productivity and \nefficiency. These benefits are high, although not always quantifiable for all project components. \nMost  restoration  works  will  aim  to  meet  immediate  emergency  needs,  but  restoration  of \npermanent structures will improve the ability to withstand future floods and cyclones.  \n \nB.  Poverty and Social Impacts \n71.  Poverty Impact. Basic facilities and key infrastructure must be restored if the affected \ncommunities are to recover from the effects of the 2007 floods and cyclone following the \nimmediate relief support provided by the Government, UN agencies, and bilateral development \npartners. The Project will benefit the residents, especially the poor, in the disaster-affected \nareas by offsetting the food grain and inputs shortfall for effective restoration of livelihood and \nincome. The poor will benefit from restored rural and urban infrastructure, and social services. \nBy rehabilitating vital public and community infrastructure, the Project will help restore essential \neconomic and social activities disrupted by the floods and cyclone. The repair of roads, bridges, \nand improvement of transport infrastructure will restore basic access and services to health and \neducational facilities. Timesavings will facilitate business and nonfarm employment. The greater \naccess to markets for cash crops, vegetables, livestock, and employment; as well as the decline \nin the price of agricultural inputs will contribute to poverty reduction by accelerating growth in \npoor people\u2019s per capita income and assets. The flood control and irrigation measures will \nprotect people exposed to risk of inundation from future flooding and raise agricultural output. \nImproved municipal infrastructure will improve health conditions particularly for slum dwellers \nwith better water supply and sanitation, and create greater access to employment opportunities. \nA summary of the poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 15. The Project will \nbenefit  25  million  people  in  51  districts,  including  women,  men,  children,  and  indigenous \npeoples. The Project will ensure participation of affected people including indigenous people, if \nany, in selection and implementation of the subprojects. The rehabilitation and construction of \n                                                 \n28  ADB. 2005. Project Completion Report on the Southwest Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project. Manila.  \n ", "22 \nflood and cyclone shelters and provision of latrines will help communities, especially the poor, \nduring floods and cyclones.  \n \n72.  Employment Generation. The Project will provide significant employment opportunities \nfor skilled and unskilled labor during implementation. It will create employment opportunities for \nthe poor in the project areas, generating about 14 million person-days of skilled and unskilled \nlabor employment, of which about 20% will be for local destitute women ensuring equal wage \nfor  work  of  equal  value.  The  poverty  reduction  aspects  will  be  enhanced  by  encouraging \ncontractors to engage local workers, including women, in project areas; and by using labor-\ncontracting societies for small earthworks, providing work for poor women in the project areas. \n \nC.  Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement \n73.  Since the Project involves rehabilitation of existing flood and cyclone damaged roads, \nculverts  and  bridges,  and  other  small  urban/municipal  infrastructure,  it  will  not  have  any \nsignificant land acquisition and resettlement. However, a resettlement framework was prepared \nto ensure that if resettlement impacts are identified, the EAs will formulate and implement \nresettlement plans for relevant subprojects in compliance with the Government\u2019s applicable laws \nand regulations, ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and the agreed resettlement \nframework. The framework includes an entitlement matrix that is inclusive, covers all potential \nlosses  at  replacement  cost,  and  ensures  mitigation  including  relocation/resettlement  and \nrestoration of income losses (Appendix 11). \n  \n74.  Wherever necessary, resettlement plans will be prepared and implemented in close \nconsultation  with  the  stakeholders  and  involve  focus  group  discussions  and  meetings, \nparticularly with the people affected by the Project. The plans formulated, according to the \napproved resettlement framework, will be disclosed and made available in Bangla to those \naffected  during  village/community  focus  group  meetings  and  posted  on  the  EA  and  ADB \nwebsites.  The  resettlement  plans  will  outline  complaints  and  grievance  procedures  and \ngrievance redress committees will be established to ensure stakeholder participation in the \nimplementation process. Through public consultations, those affected will be informed that they \nhave  a  right  to  grievance  redressal.  The  resettlement  plans  will  identify  other  institutional \narrangements,  including  involvement  of  NGOs  in  the  implementation  process.  A  total  of  \n$3 million is allocated for environment and social mitigation, as part of the Government funding \nfor parts B\u2013E; this will be reviewed based on resettlement costs. The EAs will provide a \nbiannual  review  and  report  to  ADB  on  land  acquisition  and  all  aspects  of  resettlement \nmanagement. The EAs will prepare an annual report stipulating all aspects of land acquisition \nand resettlement outcomes for ADB. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n75.  The Project is classified as category B, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002). The project IEE identifies the degree of likely impacts and describes possible mitigation \nmeasures. The Project involves only rehabilitation of previously existing infrastructure to be \nused for the same or similar purposes. The IEE concludes that it is not likely to generate any \nsignificant environmental impacts during construction and operation. All subprojects will be \nrequired  to  complete  and  satisfy  an  environmental  assessment  screening  checklist  during \nformulation. Recommended mitigation measures will be incorporated into subproject design and \ncontractors\u2019 work assignments. The Project allocates $3 million for environment and social \nmitigation, as part of the Government funding for parts B\u2013E; this will be reviewed based on \nenvironmental  impacts  identified.  The  Project  is  expected  to  have  several  environmental \n ", "23 \nbenefits,  including  limiting  land  erosion  and  failure  of  embankments  along  damaged \ninfrastructure; and reducing health risks by rehabilitating damaged water supply and sanitation \nfacilities, and cleaning drainage systems. In cases where the rapid environmental assessment \nchecklist  indicates  further  analysis  is  required,29 an  IEE  will  be  conducted  to  identify  and \nimplement mitigation measures and monitoring. The EAs are familiar with ADB\u2019s environmental \nguidelines and procedures. However, to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s environmental policy \nand  with  Government  environmental  requirements,  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedures are provided in the summary IEE (Appendix 16) to guide subproject implementation. \n \nE.  Risks \n76.  A potential risk is that procedural delays in obtaining various Government approvals will \nslow implementation. The Government has shown strong commitment to the Project and has \nadopted simplified procedures, which were successfully used in past ADB-financed flood and \ncyclone damage rehabilitation projects. The selection of EAs with considerable experience in \nimplementing ADB-financed projects and familiarity with ADB procedures, implementation by \nestablished PMUs, and use of existing or directly selected consultants minimizes delays at the \nEA level. In the past, the availability of counterpart funding has not been a problem in ADB \nprojects in Bangladesh. As the country's macroeconomic management continues to be sound \nwith well-coordinated fiscal and monetary policies, adequate counterpart funds are likely to be \nensured.  \n \n77.  Governance-related  issues,  including  corruption,  constitute  another  risk.  This  is \naddressed by detailed subproject selection criteria, transparent implementation and monitoring \nmechanisms, and specific financial controls including regular as well as random audits and the \nuse of external auditors. Measures used include strict construction supervision and strong \nconsultant support, use of the PPR, close monitoring by ADB staff, third party scrutiny of \nsubprojects and monitoring and advice on the performance of the EA and the loan consultants, \nand random procurement and annual performance auditing at the EA level. The PSC will be \nsupported by monitoring and evaluation specialists from IMED. PSC will be supported by two \nexternal consultants who will (i) help monitor all project activities, (ii) conduct random spot \nchecks  during  project  implementation,  and  (iii)  provide  capacity  building  in  key  areas  of \nmonitoring and evaluation. A third risk is recurrence of major disasters and related extensive \ndamage.  This  risk  is  addressed  by  adopting  appropriate  cost-effective  flood  and  cyclone-\nresistant design standards including capacity building, which is expected to reduce damage \nfrom future disasters. The risk of inadequate maintenance is addressed by close monitoring and \nongoing policy dialogue by ADB.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n78.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the executing agencies; \nBangladesh Water Development Board, Finance Division, LGED, and Roads and Highways \nDepartment;  have  given  the  following  assurances,  which  are  incorporated  in  the  legal \ndocuments: \n \n(i)  Project steering committee. The PSC will be established for monitoring the \nimplementation  of  the  Project  and  overseeing  all  project  governance-related \n                                                 \n29   If any subproject requires (i) a change in alignment (for roads, canals, dikes, and bridges) for safety reasons; (ii) \na large borrow pit, or (iii) a large command area (for irrigation), an IEE will be conducted and the IEE report will \nbe sent to ADB for its review and approval. \n ", "24 \nmatters, including any issues that may arise to mismanagement and breach of \nquality standards in design or execution of the Project. It will meet at regular \nintervals but at least once in every 60 days to review progress of the Project. \n(ii)  Subproject selection criteria and monitoring. The Government will ensure \nthat all subprojects meet, to the satisfaction of ADB, the agreed general and \nsector-specific selection criteria and implementation arrangements, and that all \nsubprojects are properly controlled and monitored to the satisfaction of ADB.  \n(iii)  Operation  and  maintenance.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  facilities \nrehabilitated  under  the  Project  are  properly operated  and  maintained  by  the \nrelevant EAs in accordance with sound practices. To this end, within 12 months \nof the date of loan effectiveness, each of the relevant EAs will prepare an action \nplan that will include maintenance plans with funding requirements and other \npertinent elements for year-round effective maintenance of rehabilitated facilities. \nA copy of the action plan will be submitted to ADB for follow-up. The Government \nwill make available, on a timely basis, the necessary funds for operation and \nmaintenance after implementation of the Project.  \n(iv)  Counterpart funds. The Government will allocate and release, on a timely basis, \nadequate counterpart funds from its budget for each fiscal year during project \nimplementation.  \n(v)  Delegation of financial powers. The Government will ensure that delegated \nfinancial powers, as approved by the Ministry of Finance, are followed under this \nProject.  \n(vi)  Beneficiary participation. The EAs will actively seek beneficiary participation in \nthe selection, design, and implementation of all rehabilitation works carried out \nunder the Project.  \n(vii)  Environment.  The  subproject  will  be  implemented  in  compliance  with  the \nGovernment's  environmental  protection  regulations  and  ADB's  environmental \npolicies. The procedure to comply with these environmental requirements was \nformulated in the environmental assessment and review framework prepared in \nclose  consultation  with  the  EAs.  For  subprojects  that  require  an  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  or  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA), \nthese will be prepared and included in the subproject proposal. The Government \nenvironmental clearance, if required, will be obtained prior to commencing any \ncivil works. The Government will ensure that (a) appointment of an environment \nspecialist for each EA shall be included in the budget, and (b) each EA will \nsubmit semiannual reports on the implementation of mitigation measures, as \ndescribed in summary IEE (Appendix 16). \n(viii)  Environment  mitigation  measures.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all \ncontracts financed under the Project include contractual clauses during design \nand construction requiring that all necessary steps be taken to avoid adverse \nconsequences to the natural environment, noise pollution, and environmental \nhygiene-related issues; and as pertains to the selection of sites for extraction of \nconstruction materials and selection of roads for transporting such construction \nmaterials. \n(ix)  Resettlement.  The  Government  will  ensure  that,  to  the  extent  possible, \nsubprojects will not require land acquisition or involuntary resettlement. In the \nevent  that  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement  is  required  for  any \nsubproject, then the Government will prepare a resettlement plan in accordance \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995), ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good \n ", "25 \nPractice  (1998),  and  the  resettlement  framework;  for  submission  to  ADB  for \nreview and approval before any land acquisition is initiated. \n(x)  Gender. The Government will ensure that, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on \nGender and Development (1998), (a) project interventions take into account the \ndifferent impacts and needs of women and men; (b) special features are built into \nsubprojects  to  facilitate  and  encourage  women\u2019s  involvement  and  to  ensure \ntangible  benefits  to  women;  (c)  specific  women-related  interventions  include \nactivities that uplift women from situations of vulnerability to positions of stability; \nand (d) project reporting reflects how gender-related needs are being addressed \nunder the Project, and details the successes encountered, constraints met, and \nmeasures adopted to overcome them. \n(xi)  Core labor standard: The Government will ensure that the civil works comply \nwith all applicable labor laws, do not employ child labor for construction and \nmaintenance  activities,  and  provide  appropriate  facilities  in  construction \ncampsites. The Government will set employment targets for poor and vulnerable \npeople,  particularly  women,  for  all  construction  and  maintenance  activities; \nrequire contractors to use local unskilled labor; and require contractors not to \ndifferentiate wages between men and women for work of equal value. A specific \nclause will be included in bidding documents, and compliance will be strictly \nmonitored during project implementation. \n(xii)  Indigenous people. The Government will ensure that subprojects will not affect \nvulnerable population groups, such as indigenous people. In the event of their \ninvolvement  in  any  of  the  subprojects,  the  Government  will  take  necessary \nactions  required  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  applicable  laws  and \nregulations, and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n(xiii)  Audits.  In  accordance  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  Circular  No.  AM/AB/Ba-\n1/Policy(02)/2006/512, dated 22 May 2007, the Government will ensure that the \nEAs implement internal audits of project activities to ensure productive use of the \nresources and performance evaluation of the Project. \n(xiv)  Anticorruption. The Government will ensure that all agreed measures will be \nstrictly implemented. \n(xv)  Disaster management and risk reduction. The Government will continue to \nmainstream disaster risk management and strengthen the disaster risk reduction \nsystem in accordance with the National Disaster Management Plan. To this end, \nwithin 3 months of the date of loan effectiveness, each of the relevant EAs will \nsubmit to ADB a prioritized and time-bound action plan that will include planned \nmeasures, and necessary actions to reduce disaster risks in planning, design \nand preparation, and implementation of infrastructure projects. The action plan \nwill be jointly monitored by the Government and ADB on a quarterly basis. \n(xvi)  Risk management and maintenance.

Floods in Bangladesh \n \n1.  Floods are the natural disaster causing the most extensive economic and social damage \nin  Bangladesh.  Since  1904,  floods  have  killed  50,513,  injured  102,280,  and  rendered \n32,703,724 homeless. Around 329 million inhabitants have been affected, and flood damage is \nvalued at a minimum of $10 billion.1 In the last 50 years, at least six major floods have affected \nup to 75% of Bangladesh's land area, causing significant economic and social losses.2 Because \nBangladesh is 1 of the 10 most densely populated countries in the world,3 the recurrent floods \nand their effects have caused human suffering on a massive scale (Table A2.1). \n \nTable A2.1: Significant Flood Disasters in Bangladesh 1954\u20132004 \nEvent  Impact \n1954 floods  Affected 55% of the country \n1974 flood  2,000 deaths, followed by famine with 30,000 deaths \n1984 flood  Inundated 52,520 square kilometers  \n1987 floods  Inundated over 50,000 square kilometers, 2,055 deaths \n1988 floods  60% of country inundated, 2,300 estimated deaths, 45 million homeless \n1998 floods  68% of country inundated, 31 million homeless, 980,000 homes damaged,  \n1,100 deaths \n2004 floods  38% of country inundated, 4 million homes damaged, 750 deaths \nSource: Asian Development Bank and World Bank estimates. \n \n2.  The suffering continues even after the floods have subsided. Recurrent floods contribute \nto the shifting of river courses and result in riverbank erosion and siltation. Riverbank erosion \nrenders land uncultivable, and annually deprives an estimated 100,000 inhabitants of their \nlivelihood. Siltation closes the distributary channels' off-takes and deprives distributaries from \nreceiving water from the parent channels during dry months. The result is drought and famine. \nThe damage wrought by floods in Bangladesh is staggering, especially when compared with the \ndamage suffered by other countries that are vulnerable to floods (Table A2.2). \n \nTable A2.2: Effect of Floods in Selected Developing Member Countries \n \nKilled per  Injured per  Homeless per  Otherwise Affected \nCountry \nFlood Event  Flood Event  Flood Event  per Flood Event \nBangladesh  801  1,646  981,512  4,484,569 \nCambodia  138  7  35,726  1,150,095 \nIndonesia  46  2,697  2,169  49,643 \nPhilippines  42  9  7,954  165,597 \nViet Nam  128  28  9,041  769,839 \nSources: EM-DAT: Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance/Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters \n(OFDA/CRED), International Disaster Database, www.em-dat.net - Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Brussels, \nBelgium. 27 September 2004. \n                                                 \n1  EM-DAT: Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance and Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, \nInternational Disaster Database, www.em-dat.net - Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium, 3 October \n2007. \n2  According to EM-DAT, economic damage has increased over the years. In 1984, estimated damage due to floods \nwas valued at $378 million; in 1988, $1 billion; in 1989, $1.2 billion; and in 2004 an estimated $2.2 billion. \n3  Bangladesh has a population of around 140 million inhabiting an area of approximately 147,000 square kilometers. \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \n3.  In  Bangladesh,  on  average  801  people  die  whenever  a  disaster  caused  by  floods \noccurs; on average 1,646 are injured; 981,512 are rendered homeless; and 4,484,569 are \notherwise affected by a flood disaster.  \n \nB.   Causes of Flooding \n \n4.  Bangladesh's  geographic  location,  topography,  and  climate  render  it  extremely \nvulnerable to recurrent flooding. The entire country is a delta formed by sediment deposits \ncarried  by  three  major  rivers\u2014the  Brahmaputra,  Ganges,  and  Meghna.  The  Ganges-\nBrahmaputra-Meghna basin is relatively young and is undergoing a major river-forming process. \nFlooding is a natural part of this process. Bangladesh's topography is mostly flat; 60% of the \ncountry is less than 6 meters above sea level, and around 71% of its land is regularly subject to \nflood inundation. It has a tropical humid climate, and its dry season lasts only 6 months. The \naverage annual rainfall is between 1,200 and 6,500 millimeters. \n \n5.  Bangladesh generally experiences four types of floods: (i) flash floods, (ii) floods caused \nby torrential rains, (iii) river floods, and (iv) floods caused by storm surges and tidal flooding. \nFlash floods, which occur within a period of a few minutes to a few hours, often occur in areas at \nthe foot of the northern and eastern hills, and are the result of heavy rainfall occurring in \nneighboring  upland  areas.  Rain-fed  floods  occur  where  natural  drainage  systems  have \ndeteriorated or have been disturbed by human interference. When intense rainfall takes place in \nthose areas, natural drainage systems cannot carry the runoff generated by the storm and \ntemporary inundation results. River floods result from the snowmelt in the Himalayas, and heavy \nmonsoon rainfall over the Himalayas, Assam, Tripura hills, and upper Brahmaputra and Ganges \nfloodplains outside Bangladesh. When water levels in the three major rivers rise simultaneously, \nextreme flood events occur all over Bangladesh. Storm surges cause floods along coastal \nareas. Storm surges cause high sea levels because of low barometric pressure combined with \nstrong onshore winds. Continental shelves along the Bay of Bengal are shallow, and the coast \nin the eastern portion is conical and funnel-like in shape. \n \n6.  In recent years, urban flooding or inundation has become more prevalent, due to the \npractice of filling low-lying areas within cities and destroying the natural drainage system. As a \nresult, floods have affected metropolitan areas such as Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi, \nand Sylhet; as well as towns like Comilla, Jessore, Mymensingh, Noakhali, and Rangpur. \n \nC.   Flood Management Policies, Strategies, and Control Measures \n \n7.  Government  flood  control  policy  has  been  intertwined  with  issues  of  securing \nBangladeshi's life and property, livelihood, and food security. In 1964, the Government prepared \na water development  master plan that, among other things, recommended construction of \nembankments on major rivers. The plan's implementation continued until the late 1980s, and \nmore than 7,000 kilometers of river embankments were constructed. As a result, the population \ndensity within the protected areas increased, and livelihood activities moved away from fishing \nto intensive agriculture.  \n \n8.  In the 1970s, the Government embarked on small and medium-scale flood control, \ndrainage,  and  irrigation  projects  that  contributed  to  increasing  agricultural  products  and \nprotecting agricultural crops from floods. Total investments in these projects totaled $4.0 billion, \nand provided flood protection to 5.37 million hectares of land, including about 8 million hectares \nof flood-vulnerable land, or 35% of total land area. However, some of these projects had \n ", "  Appendix 2  31 \nadverse environmental impacts, including the alteration of tidal river morphology, and negative \neffects on fish resources and navigation.  \n \n9.  In the mid-1980s, the Government began preparing Bangladesh's National Water Plan. \nThe  plan  focused  on  water  resource  management  and  development  for  agricultural  and \nnonagricultural use. The first phase was completed in 1987 and the second in 1991. The plan\u2019s \nanalysis of flooding was subsequently superseded by the Flood Action Plan, created by the \nGovernment after the 1987 and 1988 floods. The plan comprised approximately 26 components \nincluding  five  regional  studies  and  numerous  thematic  studies  covering  technical, \nenvironmental, and social issues.  \n \n10.  The culmination of the Flood Action Plan was the publication of the Bangladesh Water \nand Flood Management Strategy in September 1995. The National Water Policy was declared \nin 1999. The National Water Management Plan was formulated and approved in March 2004, \nwith  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and  sanitation  as  its  top  priority.  The  National  Water \nManagement Plan envisages the water sector regulated under law with independent regulatory \nbodies formed to ensure quality and cost-effective water service delivery.  \n \n11.  The Government has adopted both structural and nonstructural measures to control \nfloods in Bangladesh. Among the structural measures are the construction of embankments, \npolders, dams, barrages, regulators, sluices, channel improvements, and methods for river \nclosure. Embankments have been found to be the most convenient and economical method of \ncontrolling  floods  for  strategic  and  large  urban  areas.  Nonstructural  measures  for  flood \nmanagement include establishment of the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center. In 1991 the \nGovernment decided to improve the center's forecasting services by developing a flood forecast \nmodel. At present, flood forecast services are provided at 50 stations; flood monitoring is \nconducted at another 30. Flood forecasts have a lead time of 24\u201348 hours, and all forecasts are \ngiven on a real-time basis. Longer lead times are required to issue earlier warnings. In addition, \nmore  data  is  needed  from  the  upper  river  basins  in  neighboring  countries,  as  is  active \ncollaboration with the countries in the subregion on river management issues.  \n \n12.  The ongoing Comprehensive Disaster Management Program being implemented by the \nGovernment through the Ministry of Food and Disaster Management, and financed by the \nUnited Nations Development Programme, Department for International Development (United \nKingdom), and European Union, is helping develop systems and processes, and build capacity \nin  disaster  management.  Approved  in  2003,  the  program\u2019s  objective  is  to  strengthen  the \ncapacity of the disaster management system to reduce unacceptable risks, improve response \nand recovery management at all levels, and effectively integrate and manage the national food \nsecurity system. It provides a strategic institutional and programming approach designed to \noptimize reduction of long-term risk and strengthen the operating capacity for responding to \nemergency and disaster situations including action to improve recovery from these events. The \nprogram  covers  five  strategic  focus  areas:  (i)  professionalizing  the  disaster  management \nsystem; (ii) developing partnerships; (iii) empowering communities;(iv) expanding risk reduction \nprograms  across  a  broader  range  of  hazards;  and  (v)  strengthening  emergency  response \ncapabilities.  \n \nD.  Key Priorities in Flood Management and Risk Reduction \n \n13.  As  a  priority,  the  Government  needs  to  integrate  disaster  risk  considerations  into \nnational development planning and programs to improve sustainable development outcomes \nand  develop  stronger  institutions,  mechanisms,  and  community  capacities  that  can \n ", "32  Appendix 2 \nsystematically build resilience to natural hazards and disasters. Nonstructural measures for \nflood management and protection need to be given higher priority and mainstreamed into the \nGovernment\u2019s planning process.  \n \n14.  Short-term priorities for the Government include to (i) approve the National Disaster \nManagement Plan, (ii) revise the Standard Orders on Disasters; (iii) strengthen the process and, \nenhance capacity in preparing damage and needs assessments; (iv) develop and adopt flood-\nresistant  design  standards  in  public  infrastructure  development;  (v)  update  countrywide \ntopographical and elevation data, and use it to create a digital elevation model; (vi) enhance the \nexisting flood forecasting system with respect to elevation data, and provide linkage to major \ninfrastructure and agricultural land; and (vii) enhance the weather forecasting period from the \ncurrent 2 days to up to 20\u201330 days.  \n \n15.  In  the  medium  term,  improvements  are  needed  in  all  phases  of  the  hazard  risk \nmanagement cycle (preparedness, reconstruction, recovery, and prevention), adopting a more \ncomprehensive  risk  management  approach  and  strategy.  Promulgation  of  a  disaster \nmanagement  act  is  an  important  step  in  strengthening  the  legal  framework.  Increased \nsubregional cooperation in water management issues is critical for sustainable development of \nthe large Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river basin. Urban flooding needs greater attention and \nhigher priority, especially in Dhaka, including more resources allocated for improving drainage \nand sewage in urban areas. \n \nE.

The Ministry of Food and Disaster Management (MFDM), the national focal point for \ndisaster management in Bangladesh, has three agencies Disaster Management Bureau (DMB), \nDirectorate of Relief and Rehabilitation, and Directorate General of Food. Among the many \ngovernment agencies that assist MFDM in its work are (i) Fire Services and Civil Defense \nDepartment;  (ii)  Disaster  Emergency  Centre,  Armed  Forces  Division;  (iii)  Bangladesh \nMeteorological Department; (iv) Flood Forecasting and Warning Center; (v) Bangladesh Police; \n(vi)  Rapid  Action  Battalion;  and  (vii)  Cyclone  Preparedness  Programme.  MFDM  also  has \ntechnical and scientific partnerships with (i) Space Research and Remote Sensing Organization, \n(ii) Geological Survey of Bangladesh, (iii) Centre for Environmental and Geological Information \nSystem,  (iv)  Water  Resources  Planning  Organization,  (v)  Institute  of  Water  Modeling,  \n(vi) Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, and other institutions. The offices of \nthe  deputy  commissioner  in  the  districts,  the  offices  of  the  upazila  nirbahi  officers  in  the \nsubdistricts, and the union parishads at the lowest level of the administration play crucial roles in \ndisaster management. \n \nA.  Organization  \n \n2.  Bangladesh has an elaborate system of disaster management. A series of interrelated \nnational  and  subnational  institutions  have  been  created  to  ensure  effective  planning  and \ncoordination  of  disaster  management  and  emergency  response  (Figure  A3).  The  principal \nnational institutions in disaster management include (i) National Disaster Management Council, \nheaded by the Prime Minister, formulates and reviews disaster management policies and issues \ndirectives; (ii) Inter-Ministerial Disaster Management Co-ordination Committee, headed by the \nMinister of MFDM, implements National Disaster Management Council disaster management \npolicies and decisions; (iii) National Disaster Management Advisory Committee provides advice; \n(iv) Cyclone Preparedness Program Implementation Board, headed by the MFCM secretary, \nreviews  preparedness  activities  for  the  initial  stage  of  an  impending  cyclone;  (v)  Disaster \nManagement Training and Public Awareness Building Task Force, headed by the DMB director \ngeneral,  coordinates  disaster-related  training  and  public  awareness  activities  of  the \nGovernment, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and other organizations; (vi) Focal Point \nOperation Coordination Group of Disaster Management, headed by the DMB director general, \nreviews and coordinates the activities of various departments and agencies related to disaster \nmanagement, and reviews the contingency plan prepared by concerned departments; (vii) NGO \nCoordination  Committee  on  Disaster  Management,  headed  by  the  DMB  director  general, \nreviews and coordinates activities of concerned NGOs in the country; and (viii) Committee for \nSpeedy  Dissemination  of  Disaster  Related  Warning/Signals,  headed  by  the  DMB  director \ngeneral, examines and determines the ways and means for speedy dissemination of warning \nsignals among the people.  \n \n3.  Institutions at the field level include (i) district disaster management committees (DMCs), \nheaded  by  the  deputy  commissioner,  coordinate  and  review  district  disaster  management \nactivities; (ii) upazila DMCs, headed by upazila nirbahi officers, coordinate and review upazila \ndisaster management activities; (iii) union DMCs, headed by the union parishad chairperson, \ncoordinate, review, and implement the unions\u2019 disaster management activities; (iv) pourashava \nDMCs, headed by the pourshava chairpersons, coordinate, review, and implement disaster \nmanagement activities within their area of jurisdiction; and (v) city corporation DMCs, headed by \nthe city corporation mayors, coordinate, review, and implement disaster management activities \nwithin their area of jurisdiction.  \n \n ", "Appendix 3  37 \n \nB.  Legal and Regulatory Framework \n \n4.  The Standing Order on Disasters provides detailed roles and responsibilities for all \nDMCs, relevant ministries, divisions, departments, and agencies for normal risk reduction and \nduring emergency response periods. The Government is enacting a disaster management law.  \n \nC.  Risk Reduction Strategy  \n \n5.  The  Government  has  made  a  shift  in  disaster  management  strategy  from  disaster \nresponse to disaster risk management. The disaster management strategy has three distinct \nfeatures. It aims to substantially reduce disaster losses in lives and in social, economic, and \nenvironmental assets of communities and the nation. It emphasizes the integration of disaster \nrisk considerations into national development planning and programs to improve sustainable \ndevelopment  outcomes.  It  includes  specific  actions  to  develop  stronger  institutions, \nmechanisms,  and  community  capacities  that  can  systematically  build  resilience  to  natural \nhazards and disasters. The priority has been to focus on community preparedness, response, \nrecovery, and rehabilitation.  \n \n6.  Bangladesh has created a model to guide the design of disaster management programs, \nincluding development or review of policy and training course material. The model has three key \nelements:  (i)  defining  the  risk  environment,  (ii)  managing  the  risk  environment,  and  \n(iii)  responding  to  the  threat  environment.  The  model  ensures  that  the  move  to  a  more \ncomprehensive risk reduction culture remains central to all efforts. \n \n(i)  Defining the risk environment. This element promotes the use of scientific \nanalysis  (including  climate  change  impacts)  as  the  basis  for  accurately \ndetermining  the  future  risk  environment  related  to  all  hazards,  sectors,  and \ngeographic  areas.  Bangladesh  has  adopted  the  process  outlined  in  the \nInternational  Risk  Management  Standard,  Australian/New  Zealand  Standard \n(AS/NZS: 4360-1999), to guide all community risk assessments. \n(ii)  Managing the risk environment. This promotes the design of risk reduction \nstrategies (community-based adaptation programs) as an outcome of the risk \nassessment  process;  and  ensures  prevention,  preparedness,  response,  and \nrecovery programs are multihazard focused and move from being hazard generic \nin nature to risk specific. This will enable communities to better understand their \nchanging risk environment and become more resilient through proactive risk \nreduction efforts. \n(iii)  Responding to the threat environment. This involves responding to an actual \nthreat situation. It helps disaster management officials to clearly articulate the \ndifference between risk reduction and emergency response, and understand how \naccurately defining risk environments can influence and enhance emergency \nresponse systems and decisions. \n \nD.  Disaster Management Plans \n \n7.  National Plan for Disaster Management 2007\u20132015. The plan is an outcome of the \nnational and international commitments of the Government and MFDM to address disaster risks \ncomprehensively. The plan was developed to reduce the vulnerability of the poor to the effects \nof  natural,  environmental,  and  human-induced  hazards  to  a  manageable  and  acceptable \nhumanitarian level by (i) bringing a paradigm shift in disaster management from conventional \nresponse  and  relief  practice  to  a  more  comprehensive  risk  reduction  culture,  and  \n ", "38  Appendix 3 \n \n(ii) strengthening the capacity of the disaster management system to improve response and \nrecovery management at all levels. The plan outlines indicative key issues that relevant regional \nand sectoral plans would consider such as (i) risk reduction, (ii) capacity building, (iii) climate \nchange  adaptation,  (iv)  livelihood  security,  (v)  gender  mainstreaming,  (vi)  community \nempowerment, and (vii) response and recovery management. While linked to international and \nnational drivers, the plan\u2019s strategic goals are drawn from the South Asian Association for \nRegional  Cooperation  Disaster  Management  Framework.  MFDM  and  an  interministerial \ncommittee have endorsed it and it is currently awaiting approval by the National Disaster \nManagement Council.  \n \n8.  Corporate Plan 2005\u20132009. MFDM\u2019s corporate plan sets out the priorities and broad \nstrategies for achieving reform within the disaster management sector and ensures strong \nlinkages with Government priorities for the achievement of goals associated with the national \npoverty reduction strategy and international drivers such as the Millennium Development Goals. \nEach  of  the  three  MFDM  agencies  has  prepared  2\u20133  year  strategic  plans  based  on  the \nCorporate Plan and an operations plan detailing the priorities for each 12-month period. These \nplans are used to assist MFDM and its agencies in formulating collaborative partnerships, \nparticularly with NGOs, for sustainable delivery of services relative to each strategy. While this \nis  an  administrative  document,  it  is  expected  to  get  legal  coverage  under  the  disaster \nmanagement act (to be enacted). The plan\u2019s six strategic focus areas are (i) professionalizing \nthe  disaster  management  system,  (ii)  mainstreaming  risk  management  programming \n(partnership development), (iii) strengthening community institutional mechanisms (community \nempowerment), (iv) expanding risk reduction programming across a broader range of hazards, \n(v) strengthening emergency response systems, and (vi) maintaining and strengthening the \nnational food security system, with a focus on ensuring access to sustainable food supplies. \n \nE.  Integration of Disaster Risk Management in Development Programs \n \n9.  Considering vulnerability to natural and environmental hazards, development planning in \nBangladesh has addressed risk reduction in some sector plans. For example, extensive river \nflooding  causes  disruption  and  damage  to  infrastructure,  agriculture,  and  livelihoods.  The \nNational  Water  Management  Plan  underlines  the  importance  of  implementing  effective \nnonstructural measures to reduce the impact of floods and erosion. Recent policies and plans \nrecognize  the  importance  of  participatory  planning  that  focuses  on  sustaining  people\u2019s \nlivelihoods. Drought-induced famine, global warming, cyclonic storms, and other hazards have \nrequired the Government to factor in strategic planning in the national development cycle. The \nNational Environment Management Action Plan takes into account disaster management and \nrisk  reduction  as  a  vital  component  and  need.  The  Integrated  Coastal  Zone  Management \nProgram has components to address risk reduction. However, a holistic and comprehensive risk \nreduction culture needs to be developed within national policies and strategies for disaster risk \nreduction. MFDM\u2019s Comprehensive Disaster Management Program, supported by the United \nNations  Development  Programme,  Department  for  International  Development  (United \nKingdom), and European Union, is helping develop and strengthen human and institutional \ncapacities, increase public participation in risk reduction activities, and educate policy makers to \nachieve wider acceptance of disaster risk reduction concepts to address national and human \ndevelopment problems. \n \n10.  Disaster risk reduction is incorporated in the Poverty Reduction Strategy in the sections \non disaster vulnerability and risk management. The Government\u2019s strategy acknowledges that \ndisaster management involves the management of both risks and consequences of disasters, \nincluding  prevention,  emergency  response,  and  postdisaster  recovery.  The  Medium-Term \n ", "Appendix 3  39 \n \nMacroeconomic Framework covers these issues. The risk reduction approach has not yet been \nfully mainstreamed in the development process. The National Environment Management Action \nPlan formulation process encompasses disaster risk reduction. The national adaptation plan of \naction is being under the leadership of the Ministry of Environment and Forest. Bangladesh is \nrepresented at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change forums. \n \n11.  The National Adaptation Plan of Action will focus attention on three impacts associated \nwith climate change: increasing rise of sea level, changing rainfall patterns, and increasing \nfrequency and intensity of extreme events. In the World Summit on Sustainable Development \nthe Bangladesh delegation, lead by the minister of finance and planning, called for greater \nsupport from developed nations to address critical issues hindering the economic and social \ndevelopment of less-developed nations. In the Bali Summit1, Bangladesh successfully pushed \nforward the issues concerning Bangladesh and the less-developed nations. \n \n                                                 \n1 http://www.un.org/climatechange/ \n ", "4\n  0\n \n \nA\np\np\nFigure A3 Disaster Management Institutions in Bangladesh  e\nn\n  d\nix\nNational Disaster Ma nagement Council    3\n \n \n \n   \nInter-Ministerial Disaster Management    National Disaster Management \nCo-Ordination Committee    AdvisoryCommittee\n \n \n \nMinistry of Food and Disaster Management \n \n \n \nDirectorate of Relief and \n  Cyclone \nDirectorate General Food Rehabilitation   Disaster Management  Preparedness \n \nBureau  Program \n \nImplementation Board \n \nDistrict Disaster Management Committee \n \n \nCity Corporation \n \nDisaster Management \nMunicipal Disaster Management Committee    Zone/Upazila\nCommittee\n \n \nUpazilla Disaster Managem ent Committee \n  Union\n \n \nUnion Disaster Manageme nt Committee \nVillage \n \n \n \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n ", "Appendix 4  41 \n \nLIST OF PERMISSIBLE IMPORTS \n \n \nNo.  Description \n1  Food grain (rice and wheat) \n2  Fertilizer (raw, processed, and urea) \nSource: Asian Development Bank fact-finding mission.\n ", "42  Appendix 5 \nRURAL INFRASTRUCTURE \n \nA.  Damage and Impact \n \n1.  The damage includes paved roads, earthen roads, bridges, culverts, some growth center \nmarkets,  and  flood  shelters.  Some  other  infrastructure  facilities,  such  as,  union  parishad \ncomplexes and ghats, were not included as the extent of damage was not substantial and can \nbe  repaired  by  local  resources.  Immediately  after  the  water  started  to  recede,  the  Local \nGovernment Engineering Department (LGED), together with the help of consultants working \nunder its ongoing projects, carried out an assessment of the flood and cyclone damage of rural \ninfrastructure nationwide. The outcome of the damage assessment shows that the unusual high \nwater flow and longer duration of the flood caused extensive damage to rural roads including \npaved (upazila and union roads) and earthen roads. Some of the damage was due to lack of \nappropriate maintenance and/or lack of skilled work. In the affected areas, only a few road \nembankments were left above water. Wave action generated by strong winds caused erosion \non both sides of the road embankments. The water scoured parts of road embankments that \nhad insufficient waterways. Loaded trucks and buses destroyed the surface of paved roads in \nplaces. Many bridge approaches were washed away when the water receded and traffic was \ncompletely disrupted for many days. In severe cases, only bridges were left and approach roads \non both sides of bridges disappeared.  \n \nB.  Scope \n \n2.  This  project  component  will  rehabilitate  rural  infrastructure,  including  rural  roads \n(damaged paved upazila and union roads), bridges and culverts, and flood and cyclone shelters \n(including livestock shelters) located in the 23 districts (Barisal, Chuadanga Faridpur, Feni, \nGaibandha,  Gopalgonj,  Jamalpur,  Jhenidah,  Khulna,  Kishoregonj,  Kurigram,  Lalmonrihat, \nMadaripur, Magura, Mymensingh, Netrokona, Nilphamari, Noakhali, Rajbari, Rangpur, Satkhira, \nShariatpur,  and  Sherpur).  Subprojects  will  be  selected  in  close  coordination  with  other \ndevelopment partners to avoid any duplication of interventions. Additional districts may be \nadded, on a priority basis, after completion of the damage and needs assessment following the \ncyclone.  \n \n3.  The Project will finance rehabilitation of damage of high priority rural infrastructure. It \nemphasizes  adequate  drainage  at  appropriate  locations.  During  subproject  preparation, \nnecessary consideration will be taken from a hydrological point of view. About 3,000 kilometers \nof rural roads and 9,000 meters of bridges and culverts will be rehabilitated under the Project. \nAppropriate slope protection works at vulnerable points and provision of adequate drainage \nfacilities will be made as preventive measures to reduce future flood and cyclone damage. \nFlood and cyclone refuge shelters developed under asian Development Bank (ADB)-assisted \nThird Rural Infrastructure Development Project1 provided shelter for hundreds of homeless poor \npeople and their cattle. The Government has taken up programs to construct several flood and \ncyclone refuge shelters in the country under different rural development projects. Under this \nproject  component,  300  flood  and  cyclone  shelters  (including  livestock  shelters)  will  be \nconstructed or rehabilitated and provided with latrines to help communities, especially the poor, \nduring future floods and cyclones. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997.

Subprojects will meet the general criteria outlined in the main text of this report (para. \n49) and the following component-specific criteria. Construction of rehabilitation works should be \nimplemented  based  on  priority  selection  criteria  to  be  prepared  by  the  consultants  and \nagreeable to ADB. \n \n(i)  The subprojects will rehabilitate or restore damaged upazila and union paved \nroads, bridges, and culverts that are under LGED's responsibility.  \n(ii)  Priority  must  be  given  to  roads,  structures,  and  protection  works  to  ensure \nreduction of future vulnerability of the infrastructure. \n(iii)  The number of subprojects will be minimized but the estimated contract value \nshould generally be within the approval level of the chief engineer, LGED, to \nallow for speedy approvals of bid evaluations and contracts. \n \n5.  The selection of the first two subprojects to be carried out by the project management \nunit (PMU) will be subject to prior review and approval by ADB before commencement of \ndetailed design. Any subsequent selected subproject exceeding $200,000 equivalent will be \nsubmitted to ADB for concurrence, while selection of subprojects up to $200,000 equivalent will \nbe reported to ADB in a timely manner. Random audits and checks will be undertaken by ADB \nto ensure compliance with requirements of subproject selection criteria and implementation \narrangements.  In  the  event  that  the  subproject  selection  criteria  and/or  implementation \narrangements are not complied with, the subproject will not be eligible for ADB financing.  \n  \nD.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n6.  The total cost required for rehabilitating rural infrastructure under the Project is estimated \nat  $36.05  million  equivalent,  comprising  $5.54  million  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  \n$30.51 million equivalent in local currency costs (Table A5.1).

LGED under the Local Government Division of the Ministry of \nLocal Government, Rural Development, and Cooperatives will be the Executing Agency for \nrehabilitation of rural infrastructure under the Project. LGED has satisfactorily completed past \nADB-financed flood damage rehabilitation projects. Under direct supervision of the additional \nchief engineer (implementation) as the project coordinator, a full time project director will be \nresponsible for overall implementation and coordination of the Project in accordance with the \nsame  procedures  as  the  ongoing  project.  The  PMU  set  up  for  the  2005  ADB-assisted \nEmergency Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project (Part-A: Rural Infrastructure)2 will continue \nworking  for  the  Project.  Executive  engineers  of  each  district,  in  consultation  with  local \ncommunities, will select the subprojects. The team leader of the project consultants will endorse \nthe selection to ensure proper application of selection criteria. \n   \n9.  Procurement. Procurement will follow guidelines for the Project. \n \n10.  Implementation Schedule. The Project will be implemented over 30 months including \ntwo construction seasons, and is expected to be completed by June 2010. LGED submitted \nwork plans to ADB covering the next dry season up to the end of June 2008 during loan \nnegotiations. Start-up activities include (i) detailed assessment of damage to rural infrastructure; \n(ii) preparation of subproject priority selection criteria; (iii) selection of subprojects according to \nthe  established  criteria;  (iv)  preparation  of  detailed  designs,  cost  estimates,  and  tender \ndocuments;  and  (v)  supervision  of  emergency  works  to  be  implemented  under  retroactive \nfinancing arrangements.  \n \n10.

Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 6  45 \nMUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE \n \nA.  Damage and Impact \n \n1.  The 2007 disasters caused severe damage to urban roads; bridges and culverts; and \nwater supply, drainage, and sanitation system in the country; 83 pourashavas (municipalities) \nwere affected severely. Floods together with heavy rains caused extensive damage to municipal \nroads, bridges and culverts, drains, public toilets, etc. Wave action generated by strong winds \ncaused erosion to pourashavas\u2019 peripheral road embankments. Many bridge approaches were \nwashed  away  and  traffic  was  completely  disrupted  for  many  days.  Collapsing  drains  and \nsiltation aggravated the existing shattered environment.  \n \n2.  The disruption of communication by the damage to urban roads and other infrastructure \nhad  a  significant  impact  on  the  livelihood  of  urban  residents.  During  the  floods,  the  main \ncommunication mode in many areas was by country boats. Once the water receded, various \ntypes of waterborne diseases emerged due to the collapse of drainage systems. Due to the \nfloods and cyclone, income of pourashava households was reduced, and resource mobilization \nfrom  pourashavas,  including  revenue  collection,  have  been  affected,  making  restoration  of \ndamaged infrastructure to the preflood state difficult given pourashava resources. Solid waste \ndisposal,  including  health  and  environmental  restoration  in  slums  and  low-income  areas \nrequires immediate attention.  \n \nB.  Scope \n \n3.  This component will rehabilitate urban infrastructure, including roads, drains, bridges and \nculverts,  and  footpaths  located  in  30  pourashavas  (Bhanga,  Brahmanbaria,  Chagolnaia, \nChandpur,  Chowmohani,  Faridpur,  Feni,  Gazipur,  Gopalpur  Tangail,  Goplaganj,  Jamalpur, \nMagura, Manikganj, Mirkadeem, Moksudpur, Munshiganj, Nagarkanda, Narshingdi, Noakhali, \nParsuram, Rajbari, Serajganj, Shahzadpur, Shariatpur, Singair, Singra, Sonaimuri, Sunamganj, \nTangail, and Tongi). This includes pourashavas affected by the July and September 2007 floods \nand cyclone, and involves approximately 700 km of roads, 65 km of drains, and 850 meters of \nbridges and culverts. Additional pourashavas may be added on a priority basis after completion \nof the damage and needs assessment following the cyclone. \n \nC.  Subproject Selection Criteria and Approval  \n \n4.  Subprojects will meet the general criteria outlined in the main text of this report (para. \n49) and the following component-specific criteria. Construction of rehabilitation works should be \nimplemented based on priority selection criteria to be prepared by the consultant and agreeable \nto ADB. \n \n(i)  The subprojects will rehabilitate or restore damaged paved roads, structures, and \ndrains that are the responsibility of the pourashavas. \n(ii)  Subprojects  for  small  infrastructure  (footpaths,  drains,  structures,  etc.) \nrehabilitation within slums in the pourashava area will get priority. \n(iii)  The number of subprojects will be minimized but the estimated contract value \nshould generally be within the approval level of the chief engineer, LGED to allow \nfor speedy approvals of bid evaluations and contracts. \n \n5.  The selection of the first two subprojects to be carried out by the PMU will be subject to \nprior review and approval by ADB before commencement of detailed design. Any subsequent \n ", "46  Appendix 6 \nselected subproject exceeding $200,000 equivalent will be submitted to ADB for concurrence, \nwhile selection of subprojects up to $200,000 equivalent will be reported to ADB in a timely \nmanner.

The 2007 disasters caused extensive damage to the road network. In the initial stage of \nthe floods, road links were under water and the pavement structures became weaker as the \nduration of inundation increased. During this time, they were still traversed by trucks and buses, \nwhich contributed significantly to the destruction of pavement surfaces; however, the need to \nmove people and supplies around the country could not be denied. The next phase of road \ndamage occurred when the second wave flood occurred. As the waters started receding in mid-\nSeptember  and rushed to find convenient outlets, embankments were scoured, abutments \nwashed away, and many bridges and culverts were damaged or disappeared.  \n \n2.  Based on information available to the Roads and Highways Department (RHD), 4,328 \nkilometers (km) of road were submerged, and flooding damaged 1,420 km of pavement, 114 \nbridges and culverts, and three ferry landings. The total cost is estimated at $100 million. \nDamages following the cyclone remains to be fully assessed. \n \nB.  Project Scope \n \n3.  This project component comprises the rehabilitation of damaged national, regional, and \ndistrict roads within the country\u2019s seven road zones: Barisal, Comilla, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, \nRangpur, and Sylhet. This component will cover all repair and rehabilitation of damaged roads \nand bridges. Where technically feasible and justified, the design of the rehabilitation work will be \nimproved where needed, and the focus will be on mitigating damage from future floods  and \ncyclones, e.g., raising a road level above highest flooding level or allowing additional vents \nwhere water logging leads to overtopping. This is in line with the findings of the damage and \nneeds assessment conducted by an ADB-JBIC-World Bank joint mission. The survey identified \npriorities and estimates for the rehabilitation cost. Rehabilitation works will be carried out to \nrestore the facility to the preflood or higher standard as considered cost effective in the long run. \nWhere appropriate, it will include flood and cyclone protection measures to mitigate damage \nfrom future floods and cyclones. \n \nC.    Subproject Selection Criteria and Approval  \n \n4.  Subprojects will meet the general criteria outlined in the main text of this report (para. \n49) and the following component-specific criteria. Construction of rehabilitation works will be \nbased on priority selection criteria prepared by the consultant and agreeable to ADB. \n \n(i)  The  subprojects  will  rehabilitate  or  restore  damaged  roads,  bridges,  and \nculverts that are under RHD responsibility.  \n(ii)  Priority must be given to roads, structures, and protection works to ensure \nreduction of future vulnerability of the infrastructures. \n(iii)  The number of subprojects will be minimized but the estimated contract value \nshould generally be within the approval level of the chief engineer, RHD, to \nallow for speedy approvals of bid evaluations and contracts. \n \n5.  The selection of the first two subprojects to be carried out by the project management \nunit (PMU) will be subject to prior review and approval by ADB before commencement of \ndetailed design. Any subsequent selected subproject exceeding $200,000 equivalent will be \nsubmitted to ADB for concurrence, while selection of subprojects up to $200,000 equivalent will \n ", "50  Appendix 7 \nbe reported to ADB in a timely manner. ADB will undertake random audits and checks to ensure \ncompliance with requirements of subproject selection criteria and implementation arrangements. \nIn the event that the subproject selection criteria and/or implementation arrangements are not \ncomplied with, the subproject will not be eligible for ADB financing.  \n  \nD.    Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n6.  The cost of immediate and short-term restoration work1 amounts to about $50.33 million \nequivalent, including consultant costs of $3.9 million. The foreign exchange component of the \nloan amounts to $19.90 million excluding interest during construction. The total local currency \ncost of $30.43 million includes local taxes and duties, and PMU costs. The cost of consultant \nservices of $3.9 million includes remuneration and other expenses; takes into consideration the \nduration of services; and provides for office equipment, vehicles, office supplies, and vehicle \noperation.

Large and medium-scale rehabilitation works will cover urgent rehabilitation of flood \ncontrol, drainage, and irrigation facilities in 47 districts, and continuous work in adjacent district, \nto restore them to their condition prior to the flood and cyclone, and to restore some of them for \ndisaster prevention. These facilities include embankments; flood control; drainage; irrigation \ncanals and structures; and protective works including groynes1, spurs2, and hard points3. \nRestoration works include filling embankment breaches, resectioning/replacement, protective \nworks,  and  protection  of  damaged  embankments.  Damaged  or  destroyed  flood  control \nstructures and canals may be repaired,  replaced or reexcavated. Subprojects related to the \ndamage following the cyclone may be added on a priority basis, after the damage and needs \nassessment is completed. \n \n3.  The Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), the executing agency, will carry \nout surveys and the consultants prepare detailed design of the damaged facilities for approval \nby BWDB. The consultants will ensure that the quality of works is of cost-effective flood and \ncyclone resistant standard. \n                                                 \n1 A rigid hydraulic structure built out from the shore (in coastal engineering) or from the bank (in rivers) and interrupts \nthe flow of water and sediment \n2 River engineering structure that is projected from the bank of a stream at some angle to the main flow direction to \ndivert the flow of the river towards the main stream. \n3 Very short rock wall, constructed as a defense or as a boundary, that is used to stabilize a certain location of a \nriverbank. \n ", "  Appendix 8  53 \n \n2.

Project Background \n1.  The Project involves rehabilitation of damaged (i) national, regional, and district roads, \nbridges, and culverts under the Roads and Highways Department (RHD); (ii) rural infrastructure \ncomprising upazilla (subdistrict) roads, union council roads, bridges, culverts, and flood and \ncyclone shelters under the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED); (iii) urban and \nmunicipal infrastructure (secondary towns) under LGED; and (iv) water resources under the \nBangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB). The findings of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)-World Bank-JBIC Damage and Needs Assessment Mission of October 2007 do not \nenvisage any significant land acquisition or other resettlement impacts, as the Project focuses \nrehabilitating existing infrastructure. Resettlement plans will be prepared wherever the need for \nland  acquisition  is  identified.  This resettlement  framework  is to  ensure  that  if  resettlement \nimpacts  are  identified,  the  Project\u2019s  executing  agencies  will  formulate  and  implement \nresettlement plans for relevant subprojects in compliance with the Government\u2019s applicable laws \nand  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  agreed  resettlement \nframework for the Project. \n \n2.  As part of the subproject selection criteria, subprojects that may entail land acquisition \nand resettlement will be avoided. In certain cases, the expected changes in the status of a \nsubproject could be (i) raising of the road/bank protection embankment beyond the flood level, \nwhere necessary; (ii) new construction and reconstruction of small bridges and culverts, and in \nsome cases widening bridges and culverts; and (iii) retiring or resectioning flood protection \nembankments. The Government and ADB have agreed on the following resettlement framework \nfor rehabilitation works to guide the Government in preparing resettlement plans as necessary \nduring project implementation. \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n3.  The resettlement framework was prepared as the primary document to provide the basis \nfor preparing resettlement plans for subprojects, where necessary. It identifies the broad scope \nof the Project and outlines the policy, procedures, and institutional requirements for formulating \nresettlement plans during project implementation. It sets out the policies and procedures to be \nadopted by the executing agencies (EAs) in the screening and preparation of resettlement plans \nfor subprojects before submission to ADB for review and approval. The EAs will be responsible \nfor preparing social analyses and resettlement plans for subprojects based on principles and \nguidelines outlined in the resettlement framework. Implementation of the investment subprojects \nis likely to commence from early 2008.  \n4.  The current legislation governing land acquisition for public or development purposes is \nthe Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance (1982). The ordinance does \nnot  cover  project-affected  people  without  land  title  or  ownership  records  such  as  informal \nsettlers and squatters. Also, the compensation does not constitute the market or replacement \nvalue of the property acquired. Furthermore, the ordinance does not take account of the social \nand  economic  consequence  of  land  acquisition  both  in  terms  of  replacement  value  and \nrestoration  of  lost  income.  Thus,  owing  to  the  absence  of  a  policy  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy, a project-specific resettlement framework and resettlement \nprocedural guidelines are adopted. The framework and guideline stipulations will apply to all \nsubprojects approved under the Project.  \n ", "Appendix 11  59 \n5.  The resettlement framework stipulates eligibility and provisions for all types of losses \n(land, crops and trees, structures, businesses and employment, and workdays and wages). \nAffected  households  including  those  of  indigenous  peoples  compensated  by  the  deputy \ncommissioner for lost assets will receive (i) an additional cash grant to match replacement value \nof land and other assets; and (ii) other resettlement assistance such as shifting allowance, and \ncompensation for loss of workdays/income due to displacement. Households headed by women \nand  other  vulnerable  households  such  as  squatters  and  informal  settlers  and  those  of \nindigenous peoples will be eligible for cash assistance for relocation and house reconstruction. \nInformation on affected people including indigenous peoples in the project area is not known as \nthe subprojects are not yet selected. Any adverse impact, if identified, will be mitigated through \nimplementation of the involuntary resettlement plan of the specific subproject. Table A11.1 \npresents an entitlement matrix based on potential losses. The mitigation measures in the matrix \nare  standard  practices  and  consistent  with  ADB-funded  projects  in  Bangladesh.

Procedure for Preparing Resettlement Plans \n  \n6.  During the early stage of subproject preparation and screening, the EAs will carry out an \ninitial social assessment, in parallel with an initial environmental examination, to determine \npotential land acquisition and resettlement. Checklists for land acquisition and resettlement will \ninclude effects, if any, of land acquisition, loss of income/livelihood, and resettlement needs. \nThe results of the initial social assessment will be included in the subproject proposal. The EAs \nwill carry out social impact assessment surveys (census and 20% socioeconomic survey of the \npeople affected by the subproject), based on preliminary technical designs. If the impact is \nsignificant  (200  or  more  people  experience  major  impacts,  i.e.,  physically  displaced  from \nhousing or losing 10% or more of their productive assets), the EA will prepare a full resettlement \nplan for subproject preparation. If the impact is insignificant, meaning less than 200 persons, a \nshort resettlement plan will be required. Like the full resettlement plan, the short plan will ensure \ncompensation, rehabilitation, and relocation arrangements as per the resettlement framework. It \nwill also include measures to ensure that socioeconomic conditions, needs, and priorities of \nwomen  are  identified  and  that  the  process  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  does  not \ndisadvantage women.  \n \n7.  The EAs will review the resettlement plans and submit them to ADB for review and \napproval.  If  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  are  identified  then  an  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment plan will be prepared according to ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n ", "62  Appendix 11 \n \nConsultants preparing the resettlement plans will be familiar with ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements \nfor involuntary resettlement. Detailed terms of reference approved by ADB, will be given to the \nconsultants to ensure that resettlement plans meet ADB\u2019s policy requirements. The terms of \nreference  will  include  a  resettlement  checklist  for  an  initial  social  assessment  to  guide \nsubproject preparation and screening.  \n \nD.  Institutional Responsibilities and Resettlement Cost \n \n8.  Depending on the project component, the concerned EA (i.e., BWDB, LGED, or RHD) \nwill  be  responsible  for  overall  coordination,  planning,  implementation,  and  financing \nresponsibilities.  The  EAs  fully  recognize  the  complexity  of  resettlement  for  project-affected \npeople. They will therefore hire resettlement specialists with the supervision consultants, as well \nas an experienced NGO for resettlement plan implementation with clearly defined scope/tasks. \nThe EAs with assistance from resettlement specialist(s) will undertake a land acquisition survey; \ncensus and asset inventory survey, and prepare a full/short resettlement plan and proposals for \nland acquisition by subcontracting an experienced local agency under the consultancy. During \nthe process, the EA with the assistance of consultant will ensure that (i) the agency responsible \nfor  resettlement  plan  preparation  is  aware  of  the  resettlement  framework  for  resettlement \nplanning so that appropriate entitlements and mitigation measures are established in the plan; \nand  (ii)  resettlement  budgets  are  delivered  on  time  to  the  deputy  commissioner  and  the \nimplementing NGO for timely resettlement plan implementation. The EA will ensure that the \nresettlement plan is submitted to ADB for approval, and that funds for compensation and \nentitlement under the resettlement plan are fully provided to those affected prior to the award of \nthe civil work contract. \n \n9.  The EA will implement the resettlement plans by setting up a resettlement unit within the \nproject management unit (PMU) established by each EA. The resettlement unit, under the \noverall  responsibility  of  the  project  director,  will  undertake  day-to-day  activities  with  the \nappointed NGO and consultants. It  will employ, at the PMU, one senior official of the EA at the \nrank of executing engineer as chief resettlement officer who will supervise implementation with \nthe support of the supervision consultants. At the field level, a resettlement coordinator will be \nassigned in the subproject management offices at the rank of assistant engineer to undertake \nday-to-day  activities  with  the  appointed  NGO.  The  subproject  superintending  engineer  will \nprovide the resettlement coordinator with the necessary administrative support to implement the \nresettlement plans. The project director will ensure the land acquisition with assistance from \ndistrict administrations and the chief resettlement officer. The appointed NGO will open field \noffices, carry out an information campaign, and involve people affected by the subproject, \nincluding women, in the implementation process from the very beginning. The resettlement unit \nwill also form grievance redress committees (GRCs) at the executing agency level with the \nproject director as chair, representative of the implementing NGO as member secretary, and \nrepresentatives of those affected by the subproject including women and representatives of the \nlocal communities as members. \n \nE.   Disclosure, Consultation, and Grievances \n \n10.  The resettlement plans will be prepared and implemented in close consultation with the \nstakeholders and will involve focus group discussions and meetings, particularly with people \naffected  by  the  subproject.  The  resettlement  plans  formulated  according  to  the  approved \nresettlement framework will be disclosed and made available in Bangla to those affected during \nvillage/community focus group discussion meetings. Resettlement plans and the resettlement \nframework will be posted on the websites of each of the EAs (BWDB, LGED, and RHD) and \n ", "Appendix 11  63 \nADB. Further, a copy of the entitlement matrix, translated in Bangla, will be distributed to \naffected families for information at the time of detailed census and socioeconomic surveys for \npreparation of resettlement plans.  \n \n11.  Complaints and grievance procedures will be outlined in the resettlement plans and \nGRCs will be established to ensure stakeholders participation in the implementation process. \nThrough public consultations, those affected will be informed that they have a right to grievance \nredressal. They can call upon support of the implementing NGO to assist them in presenting \ntheir grievances or queries to the GRC. Other than disputes relating to ownership right under \nthe court of law, the GRC will review grievances involving all resettlement benefits, relocation, \nand other assistance. Grievances will be redressed within a month from the date of lodging the \ncomplaints.  \n \n12.  To ensure peoples participation, the NGO will form resettlement advisory committees \ninvolving local leaders and representatives of affected people (both men and women), and \nmembers of local councils. The committees will advise on the best ways to implement the \nresettlement program smoothly and efficiently. The GRC, resettlement advisory committee  joint \nverification team, and property valuation assessment team will be formed and activated during \nland acquisition process to allow those affected to have sufficient time to lodge complaints and \nsafeguard their recognized interests. \n \nF.  Budget \n \n13.  The land acquisition and resettlement budget will include all costs for acquisition of \nassets, relocation/resettlement benefits, income restoration, and all other grants outlined in the \nentitlement  matrix.  The  Government  will  provide  the  entire  fund  for  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, based on subproject cost estimates. Presently, a lump sum of $3 million has been \nincluded as provisional costs to cover all social costs, which will be increased if required during \nproject implementation. The fund for land acquisition will be disbursed through the deputy \ncommissioner  office  and  additional  benefits  will  be  paid  directly  by  the  EA  through  the \nimplementing  NGO.  The  resettlement  specialist  will  determine  the  quantity  of  losses  and \neligibility of assistance and benefits, and produce a resettlement budget for the concerned EA \nfor approval and provision of funds.  \n \nG.   Monitoring and Evaluation \n  \n14.  The  concerned  EA  will  establish  a  monthly  monitoring  system  involving  the  chief \nresettlement officer, resettlement coordinator, and NGOs who will be responsible for monitoring \nthe progress of all aspects of land acquisition/resettlement activities. The project director will \nprovide ADB with quarterly reports on resettlement implementation. The EAs will prepare an \nannual report stipulating all aspects of land acquisition and resettlement outcomes and submit it  \nto ADB. \n ", "  6\n4\n     \nA\nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE  p\np\n  e\nn\nd\n  2007  2008  2009  2010  ix\n 1\nActivity  N  D  Ja  F  Ma  Ap  M  Ju  J  A  S  O  N  D  Ja  F  Ma  Ap  M  Ju  J  A  S  O  N  D  Ja  F  Ma  Ap  M  Ju  2\n \nSelection                                                                 \nand \nengage-\nment  of \nconsul-\ntants \n                                                               \nSelection \nof sub-\nproject, \ndesign, \nand cost \nestimate \n                                                               \nBid \nprocess-\nsing and \ncontract \naward \n                                                               \nImple-\nmenta-\ntion of \ncivil \nworks \nJa = January, F = February, Ma = March, Ap = April, M = May, Ju = June, J = July, A =August, S = September, O= October, N = November, D = December. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n ", "Appendix 13  65 \nPROCUREMENT PLAN \n \nPart B \n \nProject Information \nCountry  People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh \nName of Borrower  People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh \nProject Name  Emergency Disaster Damage \nRehabilitation (Sector) Project, Part B: \nRural infrastructure \nLoan or TA Reference  To be determined (tbd) \nDate of Effectiveness  tbd \nAmount $ (total from all financiers):  $32.72 million for works and  \n$2.48 million for consultant services \nOf which Committed, $  tbd \nExecuting Agency  Local Government Engineering \nDepartment \nApproval Date of Original Procurement Plan  12 December 2007 \nApproval of Most Recent Procurement Plan  12 December 2007 \nPublication for Local Advertisement1  tbd \nPeriod Covered by this Plan  2007\u20132009 \n \nProcurement Thresholds, Goods and Related Services, Works, and Supply and Install \nProcurement Methods  To be used above/below ($) \nICB works  At least    $3,000,000  \nICB goods  At least       $500,000  \nNCB works  Less than $3,000,000   \nNCB goods  Less than    $500,000  \nShopping Works  Less than    $100,000 \nShopping Goods  Less than    $100,000 \n \nProcurement Thresholds, Consultants Services \nProcurement Methods  To be used above/below ($) \nSingle-Source Selection (SSS)  For included package \nConsultants Qualifications Selection (CQS)  Less than $200,000 \nLeast-Cost Selection (LCS)  Less than $100,000 \n \nList of Contract Packages in Excess of $100,000, Goods, Works and Consulting Services \n \nExpected Date  Prior \nContract  Estimated  Procurement  of  Review \nRef   Description  Costs ($)  Methods  Advertisement  (Y/N)  Comments \n1  Consulting  $2.48 million  SSS  Fourth quarter  Y  Financed by ADB, \n07  selected by ADB \n2  Civil works  $32.72 million  NCB  First-third  Y  Financed by ADB \n(250\u2013300  quarter 08  and Borrower \npackages) \nADB = Asian Development Bank, N = no, NCB = national competitive bidding, SSS = single source selection, Y = yes. \n \n1 General procurement notice. \n ", "6\n  6\n \n \nA\np\np\nProposed Detailed Contract Packages  e\nn\n  d\nix\nAggregated Total   1\n3\n   Number   Cost Estimate per  Cost   Mode of   Responsible   \nDescription  of Contracts   Contract ($ million)  Estimate  Procurement  Agency \n           \nA.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.   Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: In 2005, Bangladesh, one of the poorest \ncountries of the world, had 40% of its population living below the poverty line; in rural areas the rate was 43.8%. The country is \ncharacterized by an extensive network of rivers draining around 113 million cubic meters of water to the Bay of Bengal, of \nwhich 90% flows from the upper catchments outside the country. The flat topography, high intensity rainfall, and inadequate \ncapacity of rivers cause drainage congestion, inundation, and flooding during the monsoon. The Brahmaputra and Ganges \nrivers and their tributaries dominate the economic and social life of the country. The cyclones and storms generated in the Bay \nof Bengal also affect the lives, properties, and infrastructure in the coastal areas because of tidal wave, tornadoes, cyclones, \netc. Since 1971, the country has faced almost 200 disasters, including cyclones, floods, droughts, and river erosion, causing \nsevere damage to assets and lives. The poorest income groups are the most vulnerable to disaster and have to struggle to \nrecover the loss of their livelihood almost every year. The disaster-induced rural\u2013urban migration in search of livelihood has \ncreated pressures on urban areas. Many towns and the capital Dhaka also face disasters during monsoons, often due to \nblockage of sewerage and drains, lack of flood protection, and damage to infrastructure and transport facilities. Heavy rain, \nstorms, and influx of water with inadequate drainage lead to water clogging and overflowing of water bodies, flooding of \ncropland, damage of housing, etc. This results in widespread suffering of the poor and deplorable living conditions. In 2007, \nabout 25 million people were affected by floods and the cyclone. Economic activities were hampered leading to large-scale \nunemployment, particularly for the poor working in agriculture. Loss of livestock and crops created severe household budget \ndeficits. Damage of water and sanitation infrastructure led to disease and hazards. The poor became victims of hunger and \nmalnutrition. \n \nIn Bangladesh, investment in rural and urban transport and water management infrastructure is critical for the overall process \nof sustainable poverty reduction. Infrastructure development projects have been highly effective in reducing poverty by directly \nor indirectly generating income, and by creating new employment opportunities especially in the nonformal sectors. Transport \ninfrastructure helps the poor by providing connectivity and access to markets, schools, and health centers. Flood control \nstructures are essential to protect people and assets, promote economic growth, and provide shelter to the poor during \ndisasters. Essential inputs for recovery of agriculture are important for livelihood restoration. The Government\u2019s National \nStrategy  for  Accelerated  Poverty  Reduction  emphasizes  infrastructure  development  for  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction, as well as social protection for the poor.  \n \nThe Project will be instrumental in reducing the vulnerability of the poor, contributing to essential inputs supply; restoring \nconnectivity and access; and improving the environment. Rehabilitation of roads, rural and municipal infrastructure, and flood \nprotection infrastructures will enable poorer groups to benefit directly from employment created in construction, operation, and \nmaintenance of infrastructure; and indirectly though increased economic activities as the result of the Project. It will directly \ngenerate income-earning opportunities of about 14 million person-days for poor women and men. The supply of essential \ninputs for agriculture restoration will be increased. Restoration of transport infrastructure will support employment for the poor \non buses, trucks, and other traditional modes of transport on rural roads; in ancillary support and service provisions; and in \ntrading by facilitating private sector operation. It will facilitate year-round mobility for accessing economic and social services, \nall of which are indispensable to poverty reduction. The flood and cyclone resistant infrastructure designs and rehabilitation of \ndisaster shelters will be helpful to protect residents from future disasters. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has invested in \nmany infrastructure projects; the proposed Project will make a significant contribution to sustaining and enhancing benefits in \nthe infrastructure sector and to reducing poverty by facilitating recovery of livelihoods. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                               Targeting Classification: General intervention \n  1.   Key Issues \nDisasters affect the poor disproportionately in terms of health, housing, employment, livelihoods, and food security. A high \nincidence of poverty is evident in the project area. Of the 10 worst flood-affected districts, 5 have chronic poverty that registers \nabove the national level as measured by the human poverty index. The cyclone affected all districts of the poorest division, \nBarisal. The lower income groups having lost assets and income have been worst affected by the floods and cyclone. The \npoverty analysis and loss estimates are based on assessments and estimates of the Government, United Nations agencies, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and other civil society groups. During the flood and cyclone, more than 42% of the total \narea of 46 districts were inundated affecting about 14 million people. Subsequently the cyclone affected 30 districts of which 12 \nwere  severely  hit. The  floods  and  cyclone  affected  25  million  people.  The  damage  included  roads,  houses,  bridges, \nembankments, railways, and water and sanitation infrastructure. People took refuge in flood and cyclone shelters, mosques, \nschools, and other public buildings; highways; and embankments. About 70,367 tubewells were affected during the flood and \n ", "78 Appendix 15 \n \nabout 70% of the latrines of the cyclone-affected districts were damaged. These required disinfection, repair, and new \ninstallation. Production loss of rice is estimated at 1.8 million tons. The livestock, fisheries, and poultry subsectors suffered \nlosses and unemployment, especially for the poor and women. Microfinance beneficiaries, who are all among the poor and \nmostly women, have suffered loss of their self-employment activities and livelihoods. During the floods, the handloom \nsubsector of Sirajganj experienced damage to about 50%\u201370% of factories causing loss of assets and employment. The \ncyclone extensively damaged fish farms in the coastal districts. The impact on human health was also significant, caused \nmostly by waterborne disease, including diarrhea and subsequent malnutrition and morbidity. The situation was aggravated by \nexorbitant price increases, especially for food items. Loss of income and employment may result in residents selling assets and \nresorting to money lenders. Loss of housing and shelters due to disaster may lead to rural\u2013urban migration. Many losses are \nhidden and cannot be quantified.  \n \nIn many cases, absence or damage of flood control and drainage infrastructure and cyclone-resistant shelter facilities caused \nthe above loses and affected other infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and rural and municipal infrastructure. \n \nFood and shelters are primary needs of people during floods and cyclones. Many affected people were given food, shelter, \nmedicine, clothes, etc. by NGOs, other community groups, development agencies, and philanthropic groups, as well as the \nGovernment. Many were served by community resources. But in the recovery phase, the people have identified poor \ninfrastructure facilities and agriculture inputs as the most important areas for rehabilitation for restoring livelihoods and access \nto other services. \n \n  2.   Design Features \n \nThe project design includes several features that will help reduce poverty directly or indirectly. It will \n\u2022  contribute to importing essential commodities for an effective recovery program to ensure smooth supply in the \nmarket; \n\u2022  include direct employment of poor unskilled women and men in short-term and seasonal labor-intensive construction \nactivities under labor-contracting societies and contractors; \n\u2022  employ poor women in infrastructure maintenance for specific periods; \n\u2022  reconstruct irrigation and water management structures to facilitate agricultural and fisheries production and generate \nemployment; \n\u2022  restore transport communication structures to create employment opportunities in transport and ancillary activities; \n\u2022  restore road infrastructure to help transport goods and services; and  \n\u2022  with  the  improvement  of  infrastructure  and  related  facilities;  support  restoration,  expansion,  and  sustained \noccupational opportunities for the poor in nonagricultural sectors.  \n \nC.   Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \n1.  Not applicable \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe poor were severely impacted by the flood and cyclone and required urgent support for food, medicine, and shelter, which \nwere provided by the Government, United Nations, and NGOs. As time passed, rehabilitation requirements were highlighted. \nImportant among these is employment for income. Wage employment is considered the first priority among the poorest. \nFertilizer, seeds, poultry feed, and capital are needed by farmers and corrugated steel sheets are needed for housing \nrehabilitation. Infrastructure is considered a priority for recovery as well as for long-term protection. Therefore, this emergency \nloan Project is supporting infrastructure restoration to the predisaster situation and a quick recovery program by assisting in \nimporting fertilizer and other necessary inputs for disaster damage recovery. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n  1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during project preparation.  \n \nThis is an emergency support project; assessment and consultation was done jointly with the Government and other partners \nto ensure participation of relevant stakeholders. All the executing agencies (EAs) and others were consulted. A participatory \nprocess was adopted to identify the project components during the joint World Bank-ADB-JBIC mission. Later ADB with the \nGovernment identified areas to be supported by the Project. Consultation with civil society was done and regular interactions \nwere held with the Disaster and Emergency Response Subgroup led by the United Nations Development Programme. The \nneeds assessment and prioritization were done collectively and project components were identified and discussed with all \nmajor stakeholders during the assessment and fact-finding mission. Stakeholders gave high priority to ADB support for \ninfrastructure rehabilitation, including rehabilitation of rural and municipal infrastructure, roads (rural and highways), bridges, \nculverts,  water  conservation,  flood  control,  and  irrigation  and  drainage  schemes.  The  outputs  of  the  mission  were \n(i) formulation of a project design and components, (ii) formulation of criteria for selection and approval of infrastructure for \n ", "Appendix 15  79 \n \nrehabilitation and improvement, and (ii) estimation of budget for rehabilitation support. In addition, mechanisms to ensure \nparticipation of poor and women and ways for EA institutional strengthening were discussed and identified. A TA was proposed \nfor financial management and monitoring of the Project. \n \n  2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment  \n \n  3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, consultant \ninput, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThis is an emergency response project with short duration designed jointly with the Government and other stakeholders, all of \nthe EAs were consulted. They agreed on the following to ensure participation of relevant stakeholders: (i) a participatory \napproach will be followed during project implementation to strengthen Government capacity to implement the Project and to \nincrease sustainability of the infrastructure; and (ii) a sector approach will be followed to identify and approve the subprojects \nbased on specific criteria. The identification, selection, and implementation phase will ensure stakeholder participation in \nimplementation, operation, and maintenance of improved infrastructure. To ensure efficient implementation, a project steering \ncommittee was established with participation of all the EAs and relevant ministries; it is chaired by the member, Programming \nDivision,  Planning  Commission.  The  local  government  institutions  and  NGOs  will  be  involved  during  identification, \nimplementation, and monitoring of the subprojects. Local poor will be involved in construction, operation, and maintenance \nactivities and labor contracting societies will be formed for earthwork and maintenance including tree plantation. \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues   \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: The Project has important gender implications. The rehabilitation of damaged \ninfrastructure will support women in restoring their incomes and accessing various services through the rehabilitation of \ninfrastructure. Substantial short-term and seasonal employment will be created for women in construction and maintenance of \ninfrastructure. Earthwork components will ensure employment of women through the formation of labor-contracting societies. \nEmployment and income-earning opportunities in women\u2019s market corners and platforms will be restored. Women will also \nparticipate in operation and maintenance activities and thereby help restore their incomes. Efforts will be taken to reduce the \ngap in wages for women and men in construction activities. The Project will facilitate women\u2019s mobility for employment, \nincome, and access to services for their families. \n \n2.  Key Actions.

The proposed Emergency Disaster Damage Rehabilitation (Sector) Project will help the \nGovernment of Bangladesh to rehabilitate and restore damages of the 2007 floods and cyclone. \nIt will allow early access to basic services to people and restore economic and social activity in \nthe affected areas, especially for the poor. The Project will follow a sector approach to facilitate \nselection of the highest priority subprojects during implementation.  \n \n2.  The initial environmental examination (IEE) forms an overall initial scoping of the broad \nframework of the Project and allows key environmental issues to be identified so that the \ndetailed subproject formulation can take them into account. Considering the urgent nature of \nProject the IEE was conducted based on assessment of selected affected areas, with varied \nnature of damage with respect to rural and municipal infrastructure; national, regional, and \ndistrict roads and bridges; and flood control and irrigation facilities: 61% of the 2,495 square \nkilometers of this district was affected by the 2007 disasters. Subprojects will be formulated by \nthe respective executing agency based on the specific nature of damage, i.e., rural or municipal \ninfrastructure, water resources, roads, or bridges.  \n \n3.  Environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  were  prepared  to  guide \nenvironmental  screening,  and  categorization  and  selection  of  subprojects;  and  to  facilitate \nenvironmental assessment, public consultation, and information disclosure and compliance with \nthe environmental assessment requirements of the Government and Asian Development Bank \n(ADB).  \n \n4.  The summary IEE (SIEE) was prepared for use by the Project and includes a general \noverview of the Project, brief description of environmental impacts associated with rehabilitation \nactivities in the 2007 disaster damaged areas, and an environmental impact assessment review \nprocedure. \n \nA.  Overview of the Project  \n5.  The Project will rehabilitate high-priority, disaster-damaged infrastructure and facilities by \nproviding civil works; equipment, and materials; and includes consulting services for project \ndesign, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. The rehabilitation will be done by adopting \nappropriate disaster-resistant design standards to reduce damage to infrastructure in the event \nof future flood or cyclone. The Project will be processed and implemented in accordance with \nsector loan requirements.  \n \nB.  Environmental Screening of Sector Impacts and Summary of Likely Subprojects \n1.  Description of Project Activities  \n6.  The Project is spread across the country. The likely project components with project \narea and activities involved are highlighted in Table A16.1. \n \n7.  The rehabilitation work for roads, bridges, and river embankments are likely to be within \nthe right-of-way. No widening is involved. The rehabilitation of roads, river embankments, and \ndrains will focus on the specific damaged section and will not cover an extensive length. \nDepending on the highest flood level, the road embankment height or bridge height may have to \nbe increased. The filling material is likely to be sourced from the right-of-way or from nearby \n ", "82 Appendix 16 \nareas. Most of the material is likely to be transported by road. Construction material is likely to \nbe transported by river for river embankment or protection works. \n \nTable A16.1: Project Components \nProject \nProject Part  Scope of Work \nArea/Zone \nB.  Rural  23 districts  Rehabilitate rural infrastructure facilities including feeder \nInfrastructure  roads, rural roads, bridges, and culverts. Main civil work will \ninvolve restoration and protection of embankment and \ndrainage including tree planting. Flood and cyclone shelters \n(including livestock shelters) will be constructed/repaired \nand provided with latrines to help communities, especially \nthe poor, during future floods and cyclones. Design standard \nis based on improved LGED standards as developed by the \nproject \nC.  Municipal  30 municipalities  Rehabilitate urban infrastructure, including roads, drains, \nInfrastructure  bridges and culverts, and footpaths. Design standard is \nbased on improved LGED standards as developed by the \nProject. \nD.  Roads  7 road zones  Rehabilitate national, regional, and district roads, bridges, \nand culverts. Design standard is based on improved RHD \nstandards as developed by the Project, which includes \nwhere technically feasible and justified, improvements to \nmitigate impact of future floods and cyclones, e.g., improved \nslope protection, raising of road level above highest flooding \nlevel, or allowing additional vents where water logging leads \nto overtopping.  \nE.  Water  47 districts  Rehabilitate large and medium-scale infrastructure flood \nResources   control, drainage, and irrigation facilities to restore, improve, \nand reduce future disaster impacts. These facilities include \nembankments, flood control, drainage, and irrigation canal \nand structures, and protective works including groynes, \nspurs, and hard points. Restoration works will include filling \nembankment breaches, resectioning, protective works, and \nprotecting damaged embankments.  \nLGED =  Local Government Engineering Department, RHD = Roads and Highways Department. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n2.  Description of the Environment \na.   Physical Resources \n \n8.  Bangladesh  is  characterized  by  tropical  monsoon  climate.  Annual  rainfall  is  high, \nbetween 1,200 and 6,500 millimetres. The country has three distinct seasons: winter, summer \nand  monsoon.  Nearly  80%  of  the  annual  rainfall  falls  from  May  to  September  during  the \nmonsoon season, when moisture-laden winds blow from the south and southeast. Flooding is a \nrecurring phenomenon. Bangladesh suffered losses from damaging floods extensively in 1974, \n1988, 1998, 2004, and 2007. The 2007 floods and cyclone have affected a very large area of \nthe country: 51 districts were affected by the 2007 floods and cyclone. Riverbank erosion and \nchannel  migration  is  significant  and  is  associated  with  the  major  system  of  the  country, \nparticularly along the Brahmaputra\u2013Jamuna, Ganges\u2013Padma, and lower Meghna rivers. Most of \nthe country lies in the delta of three of the world's major rivers (Brahmaputra, Ganges, and \nMeghna). A few small tracts of higher land occur in Sylhet, Mymensingh, and Chittagong Hill \nTracts regions. Maximum elevation is 850 meters on the Bangladesh-Myanmar border. The \n ", "Appendix 16  83 \n \nsouthwestern region consists of a large number of dead and cut-off rivers, the coastal part of \nwhich  includes  the  famous  Sundarbans  mangrove  forest,  which  was  extensively  damaged \nfollowing the cyclone. Except for small higher areas of old alluvium rising to about 30 meters in \nthe  northwest  (Barind  tract)  and  north-center  (Madhupur  tract),  the  Ganges\u2013Brahmaputra \ndeltaic plain region is a flat surface of recent alluvium, having a gentle slope and generally with \nan elevation of less than 10 meters above mean sea level. Bangladesh has 230 rivers; 57 are \ntransboundary rivers. \n \n9.  The  geographic  setting  of  Bangladesh  makes  the  country  particularly  vulnerable  to \nnatural  disasters.  The  mountains  and  hills  bordering  almost  three  fourths  of  the  country\u2019s \nfrontier, along with the funnel-shaped Bay of Bengal in the south, have made the country a \nmeeting place of life-giving monsoon rains. Extreme rainfall and earthquakes in the adjacent \nHimalayan range also had effects in Bangladesh. \n \nb.   Ecological Resources \n \n10.  Bangladesh has an estimated 1,010,000 hectares (ha) of forests, covering some 7.8% of \nland area including several national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. The forests are broadly \nclassified into three categories based on the topographic conditions (i) hill forests, (ii) plain sal \nforests, and (ii) mangrove littoral forests. In terms of forestland under forestry use, the hill \nforests contribute 508,991 ha (45.4%) followed by the littoral mangrove forests and coastal \nforests  extending  over  489,872  ha  (43.7%),  and  plain  sal  forest  accounts  for  121,884  ha \n(10.9%) of the forest area. The damage due to floods and cyclones are confined to lower \nreaches. Only a small number of national parks, sanctuaries, or forest areas were affected by \nthe floods, but the cyclone caused extensive damage to littoral mangrove forests in Sundarban.  \n \n11.  The wilderness areas have a wide variety of animal diversity typical of a tropical area. \nThe fauna, specially the wildlife includes 125 species of mammals, 750 species of birds, 125 \nspecies of reptiles, and 9 species of amphibian. The large forest area of the Sundarban in the \nsouthwest is the home of the endangered Bengal tiger. Elephants are found mainly in the \nforests of the Chittagong Hill Tracts districts. Most of the rehabilitation sites are in plains and \nhave natural vegetation. \n \n12.  Hundreds of varieties of fish are found in the country. As per International Union for the \nConservation of Nature, 266 species of freshwater fish and 442 marine species are found in \nBangladesh. While much of the fish is consumed domestically, Bangladesh exports a sizable \nquantity of freshwater fish to India and other neighbouring countries, as well as freshwater \nshrimp  and  lobster.  The  floods  and  cyclone  also  damaged  various  infrastructure  used  by \nfisherfolk. \n \nc.  Economic Development, Social, and Cultural Resources \n \n13.  Bangladesh is the 7th most populous nation in the world. The current population density \nis 750 per kilometer. The total fertility rate is now 3.1 children per woman, compared with 6.2 \nthree decades ago. The overall population growth rate is 1.7%. The population is relatively \nyoung, with the 0\u201325 age group comprising 60%, while 3% are 65 or older. Life expectancy is \n66  years.  The  increased  growth  of  the  urban  population  will  result  in  shortage  of  urban \ninfrastructure such as water supply, sewage, and health facilities. Damage of this infrastructure \ndue to disaster aggravates water supply and sanitation problems.  \n \n ", "84 Appendix 16 \n14.  The country has achieved an average annual growth rate of over 6% during recent \nyears. The middle class and the consumer industry have expanded. Health and education have \nrecently improved as poverty has decreased. \n \n15.  Bangladesh has an extensive and diversified transport system, which includes about \n220,000 km of roads, 2,700 km of railroads, 6,000 km of major waterways, two major seaports \nand  eight  airports.  The  2007  floods  and  cyclone  caused  localized  damage  to  transport \ninfrastructure. Road transport was by far the worse affected transport mode. \n \nd.  Screening  of  Potential  Environmental  Impacts  and  Mitigation \nMeasures \n \n16.  The proposed Project aims to rehabilitate disaster-damaged facilities and infrastructure \nso as to restore critical social and economic activities. As such the positive environmental \nimpacts  are  substantial.  Short-term  minor  negative  impacts  may  be  associated  with  the \nrehabilitation activities (material transportation, earthwork, operation of tar boiler/hot mix plant, \noperation and maintenance of construction machinery, etc.), which can be moderated with the \nadoption of appropriate mitigative measures. Generic mitigation measures and monitoring plans \nare  proposed  based  on  the  type  of  rehabilitation  works  and  preliminary  environmental \nassessment  conducted  during  the  field  visit.  During  implementation,  detailed  site-specific \nenvironmental and social impacts, mitigation measures, and monitoring plan will be assessed \nand developed for subprojects and included in the contract documents. \n \n17.  Air Quality and Noise. Handling of construction materials, equipment movement, and \nother construction activities may generate dust and noise. The impact will be temporary and \nrestricted within the closed vicinity of the construction activities. All vehicles, equipment, and \nmachinery used for construction will be regularly maintained. Water will be sprayed frequently \non dry surfaces, earth mixing sites, and loose material and spoil soil storage areas. Vehicle \ndelivering loose and fine material will be covered. Road embankments will be covered with \nvegetation. Hot mix plant/tar boilers will be located at least 500 meters away and will be located \nat the downwind direction with respect to human settlement. Vehicle and equipment will be fitted \nwith silencers and maintained regularly. Diesel generators will be fitted with acoustic enclosures. \nWork will be restricted to daytime, reducing nuisance from noise. \n \n18.  Soil and Land. The rehabilitation activities under the Project may have adverse impacts \non soil and land. Impacts may include loss of productive area, loss of productive soils due to \nborrowing of earth, soil contamination due to disposal of spoil soils, spread of waste during \ndrains  repair,  and  loss  of  rice  fields  within  or  adjacent  to  the  road  right-of-way  due  to \nclearance/material extraction/dumping of cut spoil. Selection of borrow areas will be based on \ntopography, land use, and drainage pattern. The top soil will be preserved and reused. The \nextraction of construction materials from riverbeds will be minimized. Fuel and lubricants will be \nstored on paved surfaces, away from rivers and streams. Slope protection measures including \nvegetation will be adopted. Appropriate waste handling and management procedures will be \ndeveloped  and  implemented.  Septic  tanks  (adequately  designed)  will  be  provided  at  the \nconstruction camps. \n \n19.  Flora and Fauna. Transport of construction material by river may damage charland1 \nvegetation and animal habitat. Surface runoff and improper handling of construction waste may \n                                                 \n1 The islands of sediment created, accumulated, and stabilized with the change of course of the river \nused for cultivation \n ", "Appendix 16  85 \n \naffect the water quality of rivers and canals, which may impact aquatic fauna. Charland will be \nprotected  from  any  damage  due  to  cutting  or  dredging  for  ship  movement  for  material \ntransportation through river. Precautions will be taken to prevent surface runoff or construction \nwaste finding its way to water bodies. \n \n20.  River  Hydrology  and  Morphology. Reconstruction of embankments and protective \nworks may have morphological impacts on river flow and resulting change in the shape of the \nriverbed  and  river  course.  It  may  also  result  in  drainage  congestion.  Proper  construction \nplanning will be done to avoid drainage congestion. Embankments, protective work, and road \ndesign  will  consider  factors  such  as  highest  flood  level,  river  hydrology  and  morphology, \nriver/channel siltation, drainage pattern, topography, seismicity, and channel encroachment by \nthe population.  \n \n21.  Economic  Impacts.  The  Project  will  have  various  beneficial  impacts  due  to  early \nrestoration of basic infrastructure facilities especially in rural areas. However, a civil work may \ncause some temporary damage to crops and agricultural land due to poor handling of solid \nwastes. All precautions will be taken to ensure that no damage occurs to crops and agriculture \nland due to construction activities. In unavoidable circumstances, the project implementing \nagency  will  follow  the  Government  and  ADB  policies  for  compensation  and  involuntary \nresettlement. During implementation, local villagers will be recruited as much as possible to \nprovide income opportunities and to minimize wastes and pollution generated from work camps. \n \n3.  Institutional Arrangements \n22.  The  Bangladesh  Environment  Conservation  Act  1995  and  The  Environmental \nConservation  Rules  1997  define  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  for \ndevelopment projects in the country. According to these legislations, projects are categorized in \nfour categories (green, amber A, amber B, and red). The clearance requirement defined under \nthe legislation will only apply to subprojects requiring reconstruction/expansion of flood control \nembankment, reconstruction/expansion of roads (regional, national), and bridge (length 100 \nmeters and above), which will fall under the red category. Therefore, environmental clearance \nfrom the Department of Environment (DOE) is not needed for many subprojects. However \nwherever reconstruction of roads, bridges (>100 m) and flood control structures is involved, the \nenvironmental clearance from DOE will be required. In the latter case, an IEE will have to be \ncarried out. The IEE, the proposed terms of reference for environmental impact assessment \n(EIA), environmental management plan (EMP) and no objection certificate (NOC) from the local \nauthority will be submitted to DOE for environmental clearance. \n \n23.  The institutional arrangements already established within each executing agency (EA) \nwill be used. The project management unit (PMU) and the project implementation units (PIUs), \nunder the EAs, will be responsible for undertaking environmental assessment, environmental \nmitigation measures and monitoring, preparation of an IEE and SIEE if necessary, and reporting \nto ADB. The PMUs and PIUs are expected to be facilitated by the Environmental Cell of the EA \nor the environment specialist to be hired for the Project or to be provided by the design and \nsupervision consultant for any environmental issue.  \n \n \n ", "86 Appendix 16 \n4.  Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan \n24.  The  EMP  is  prepared  to  ensure  that  all  adverse  impacts  of  the  subprojects  are \nprevented and properly mitigated. It provides a set of mitigation, monitoring, and institutional \nmeasures to be undertaken in a time-bound manner during design, construction, and operation. \n \n25.  The  environmental  management  and  monitoring  will  be  based  on  IEE/EIA \nrecommendations. The cost of mitigation measures and monitoring will be part of the project \ncost. An environment specialist will be provided for each EA to assist the respective PMU and \nPIU staff in strengthening their capacity to carry out environmental assessment and implement \nmitigation measures. Provision of increasing public awareness on environmental measures will \nalso be included in the budget.      \n \n26.  To ensure effective implementation of the environmental assessment and mitigation \nmeasures, a reporting system is a prerequisite. During construction, the EA will submit a half \nyearly report on implementation of the mitigation measures to ADB.  \n \n5.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n27.  Because of the urgent nature of the Project, conducting a detailed public consultation \nwas not possible. However detailed interactions were made with concerned officials from the \nEAs, NGOs, and government offices, and interviews were held with affected villagers during the \nfield visit undertaken on 21\u201325 October 2007.  \n \n28.  During implementation, further consultation will be conducted for each subproject to \nidentify and take into account any concerns of the villagers and communities about the design \nand  rehabilitation  work.  Necessary  project  information  will  be  shared  with  the  concerned \nvillagers and communities.  \n \n6.  Findings and Recommendations  \n29.  Positive environmental impacts will be substantial. Short-term minor negative impacts \nmay be associated with the rehabilitation activities; these can be addressed with the adoption of \nappropriate  mitigative  measures.  As  per  the  public  consultation,  lack  of  maintenance  of  a \nprotective embankment has caused fast embankment erosion resulting in higher damage from \n2007 floods and cyclone. Provision may be made in the contract to maintain the rehabilitation \nwork for a minimum specified time especially with respect to soil erosion and tree plantation. \nProvision should also be made for monitoring the erosion around bridge sites. \n \nC.  Environmental Assessment and Review Procedure for Future Projects \n30.  The environmental assessment and review procedures have been prepared to guide the \nenvironmental  screening  of  each  subproject  and  facilitate  institutional  arrangements  and \ncompliance with the environmental assessment requirements of the Government and ADB \n(Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 16  87 \n \n1.  Environmental Criteria for Subprojects Selection \n \n31.  The  Project  will  include  subprojects  falling  under  B  and  C  category2 as  per  ADB \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). In addition, all subprojects must comply with the \nenvironmental requirements specified in the ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environment \nAssessment Guidelines.  \n \n32.  To  ensure  environmentally  sustainable  rehabilitation  work,  all  subprojects  will  be \nsubjected  to  an  environmental  assessment  screening  to  identify  subprojects  located  in \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas,  assess  the  potential  negative  environmental  impacts,  and \ndetermine the need for an IEE. If the screening indicates further analysis required3, an IEE will \nbe conducted to identify and implement environmental mitigation measures and monitoring, and \nIEE reports will be sent to ADB for its review. Environment clearance will be obtained from DOE, \nfor subprojects falling under the red category as per The Environmental Conservation Rules \n1997 of Bangladesh.4 An IEE along with terms of reference for an EIA and EMP will have to be \nsubmitted to DOE to obtain environment clearance if applicable for a subproject. An EIA will be \nundertaken as per approved terms of reference and submitted to DOE. The EIA and EMP will \nbe sent to ADB for review. \n \n2.  Responsibilities and Authorities \n33.  Several EAs will be involved in the environmental aspects of the subprojects.  \n \n34.  The institutional responsibilities of the EAs and ADB are given in Table A16.2  \n \n3.  Environmental Assessment Requirement \n \n35.  All subprojects will be screened based on the screening checklist and by considering the \nclassification under Environmental Conservation Rules 1997.  \n \n36.  Subprojects classified as category A will require preparation of a detailed EIA and SEIA \nas per ADB requirements.5 Subprojects classified as category B will require preparation of an \nIEE and SIEE as per ADB requirements. Requisite Government clearance/permissions will be \nobtained  as  applicable  under  Environment  Conservation  Rules,  Bangladesh  Wildlife \nPreservation Order 1973/1974, Forest Act 1927, and Protection and Conservation of Fish Act \n1950. Subprojects classified as category C will not require preparation of an IEE or EIA as per \nADB requirements. However, environmental implications are still reviewed.  \n \n                                                 \n2  The subprojects located in environmentally sensitive areas or ecologically critical areas will be classified as \ncategory A. The environmentally sensitive areas are generally defined as those requiring special management \nattention to protect important scenic values, fish and wildlife resources, historical and cultural values, and other \nnatural systems or processes. Those areas include national forests, mangroves, wetlands, steep slope areas, \nbuffer zones, and areas that cover endangered species. The Environment Conservation Rules 1997 considers the \nfollowing factor while declaring an area ecologically critical: ancient monument, archeological site, forest sanctuary, \nnational park, game reserves, wild animal habitat, mangroves, forests areas, biodiversity of relevant areas, and \nhuman habitat.  \n3  IEEs will be conducted for all subprojects likely to have adverse environmental impacts due to project activities \nsuch as (i) a change in alignment for roads, canals, dikes, and bridges; (ii) borrowing earth from large areas; and \n(iii) construction of a bridge instead of a road due to river morphological changes, and be sent to ADB for review.  \n4  As per the rule and nature of project activity, no project will fall under amber A, amber B, or green category. \n5  For a category A subproject, the summary EIA is made available to the public by posting it on the ADB website no \nlater than 120 days prior to the consideration of the project by ADB board. This condition may not apply in this case \nas it is an emergency flood damage rehabilitation project.   \n ", "88 Appendix 16 \n4.  Procedures for Environmental Assessment of Subprojects \n37.  The procedures for environmental assessment of subprojects must be in line with the \nrequirements  of  the  Government,  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy,  Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines,  and  their  environment  assessment  and  review  procedures.  The \nPMU/PIU  of  the  respective  EA  will  undertake  rapid  environmental  assessment  for  each \nsubproject as per the defined EA screening checklist. The rapid environmental assessment will \nbe submitted to ADB for review and endorsement of the classification. Subprojects selection will \nbe based on the selection criteria described in para. 49. The PIU/PMU will prepare an IEE and \nSIEE. ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines will be used to identify major environmental \nissues. The IEEs and SIEEs will be submitted to ADB, which will review them. Environmental \nclearance, where applicable, must be obtained before submission of the IEE and SIEE to ADB. \nThe PMUs/PIUs will prepare half yearly reports for subprojects, including the implementation \nstatus of mitigation measures and monitoring. \n \nTable A16.2 Institutional Responsibilities \n \nItem  EA   ADB  \nInception  \u2022  Develop EA screening checklist with the help  \u2022  Review and endorse the \nof its environmental cell or hired qualified  developed EA screening \nconsultant   checklists \n\u2022  Submit EA screening checklists to ADB for  \u2022  Review rapid environmental \nreview  assessment and endorse the \n\u2022  Assess the applicability of Environment  environmental categorization (B \nConservation Rule 1997 for obtaining  or C) \nenvironment clearance certificate; if applicable  \u2022  Review IEEs and SIEEs to \nobtain necessary clearance   ensure compliance with the \n\u2022  Check if any restriction for construction of  environmental assessment \ntemporary and permanent embankment and  requirements of the Government \nother structures in the waters of subproject  and ADB \narea is imposed under the Protection and \nConservation of Fish Act 1950 and if yes, \nobtain necessary concurrence/permission \nfrom fishery officer    \n\u2022  Undertake IEEs and SIEEs for subprojects \nwhere they are required in compliance with \nGovernment and ADB requirement. \n\u2022  Undertake EIAs for subprojects falling under \nthe red category as per the Environment \nConservation Rules 1997  \n\u2022  Submit IEEs and SIEEs to ADB for review \n\u2022  Submit EIA wherever prepared in compliance \nwith the national legislation to ADB for review \n\u2022  Confirm to ADB that all statuary environmental \nclearance have been obtained for the \nsubprojects where applicable prior to \ncommencement of work  \n\u2022  Ensure adequate mitigation measures and \nmonitoring requirements are included in the \ncontract documents \nConstruction    \u2022  Implement and ensure implementation of  \u2022  Review the progress of \nadequate mitigation measures and monitoring  implementation of mitigation \nas well as environmentally sound construction  measures and actual impacts as \nmethods    needed during review mission \n ", "Appendix 16  89 \n \nItem  EA   ADB  \n\u2022  Ensure that contractors have access to IEEs  \u2022  Review the half yearly reports \nincluding details of mitigative measures/EMP  and provide necessary feedback \n\u2022  Ensure that contractors understand their  to EA/PMU if necessary   \nresponsibilities to mitigate environmental   \nproblems associated with their construction \nactivities \n\u2022  If any unexpected environmental impacts \noccur, consult with ADB and undertake \nappropriate remedial measures \n\u2022  Prepare and submit half yearly environmental \nmonitoring reports to ADB  \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  EA  =  executing  agency,  IEE  =  initial  environmental  examination,  EMP  = \nenvironmental management plan, SIEE = summary initial environmental examination. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n5.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure Plan \n \n38.  The EA will ensure that public consultation will be conducted for each subproject to \nidentify and take into account the concerns raised by the affected villagers and communities in \nthe  design  and  rehabilitation  work.  Necessary  project  information  will  be  shared  with  the \nconcerned villagers and communities. All documents on environmental issues, including IEEs, \nand progress reports will be properly kept as part of the project documentation and made \navailable to the public if requested. \n \n6.  Staff Requirements and Budget \n39.  Environmental mitigation and monitoring requirements and cost will be based on IEE/ \nEIA recommendations and will be part of the project cost. The recruitment of an environment \nspecialist within the PMU of the EA will be included in the budget to help respective PMU and \nPIU  staff  strengthen  their  capacity  to  carry  out  environmental  assessment  and  implement \nmitigation measures. Provision for increasing public awareness of environmental measures will \nalso be included in the budget.   \n  \nD.  Conclusion \n40.  The 2007 disasters caused four main environmental impacts: riverbank erosion, soil \nerosion,  water  logging,  and  water  contamination  and  health  risk.  The  Project  involves \nrehabilitation of damaged infrastructure and will have substantial benefits particularly in terms of \nlimiting adverse impacts.  \n \n41.  Considering the nature of subproject components, no significant adverse environmental \nimpacts are likely to be associated with the proposed rehabilitation work. The proposed generic \nmitigation  measures  and  detailed  site  specific  mitigation  measures  to  be  identified  during \nimplementation  are  likely  to  minimize  negative  environmental  impacts.  The  environmental \nassessment  and  review  procedures  will  provide  adequate  guidance  to  carry  out  IEE  and \nimplement environmental mitigation measures as well as monitoring in accordance with the \nenvironmental assessment requirements of the Government and ADB. A detailed EIA will be \nrequired for subprojects falling under red category as per the Environmental Conservation Rules \nof Bangladesh or subprojects classified as category A as per ADB guidelines. \n \n  \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080124155508+08'00'", "Author": "Stefan Ekelund", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word", "Keywords": "rrp: bangladesh 41657,emergency disaster rehabilitation, emergency damage project", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20080204141536+08'00'", "Title": "Emergency Disaster Damage Rehabilitation (Sector) Project"}, "author_page": " \n \n \n \n \n \nVice President  L.
