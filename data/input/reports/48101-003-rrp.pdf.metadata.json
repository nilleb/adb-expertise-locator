THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation for a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Guizhou Vocational Education Development \nProgram (GVEDP). The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for capacity \ndevelopment for the GVEDP, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1  \n \n2.  The proposed Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance will support the Guizhou \nProvincial Government (GPG) to improve the quality of technical and vocational education and \ntraining  (TVET)  in  the  province,  and  to  make  TVET  more  relevant  to  employers\u2019  needs. \nDeveloping high-quality TVET is a GPG priority for expanding and developing the provincial \nworkforce  to  facilitate  continued  inclusive  economic  growth,  reduce  rural  poverty,  and  to \nimprove the employment prospects of young workers seeking jobs.2  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  The PRC faces a structural mismatch between the supply and demand of workers and \nappropriate education and skills. The government is increasingly emphasizing the value of \nhighly skilled human capital, which accounted for 38.1% of the PRC\u2019s economic growth during \n1978\u20132008.3 In 2010, the government approved the National Long-Term Strategy on Education \nReform and Development, 2010\u20132020, identifying TVET as the main strategy for educational \nexpansion  to  develop  a  skilled  workforce.  Making  the  TVET  system  more  responsive  to \neconomic growth needs and strengthening links between TVET and industry are essential to \nsupply the skills needed for the envisioned structural economic transformation of the country. \n \n4.  Guizhou is a landlocked province in the southwestern region of the PRC and is among \nthe  least  developed  in  terms  of  socioeconomic  development.  Home  to  about  35  million \npermanent residents, Guizhou has high levels of poverty. About 7.5 million of the province\u2019s \nrural population living below the national poverty line (CNY2,300 per year) are concentrated in \nthe  mountainous  region  in  the  western  part  of  the  province,  while  5.0  million  of  its  total \npopulation are internal migrant workers. The province has the lowest per capita gross domestic \nproduct in the country (approximately $3500, or 50% of national GDP per capita) and low levels \nof industrialization. Its growth is largely reliant on agriculture and traditional services, and public \nservices lag far behind the national average. However, GPG\u2019s ambitious plans to modernize \nand diversify the province\u2019s economy to close the gap in economic output relative to richer \nprovinces have resulted in rapid economic growth, averaging 12% since 2010.4 \n \n5.  To meet the demands of a rapidly growing and diversifying economy, Guizhou needs an \nexpanded workforce with high-level skills that is supported by an upgraded TVET system. \nCurrently, Guizhou is facing a severe shortage of highly skilled workers in priority sectors such \nas  construction,  logistics,  light  industry  equipment  manufacturing,  information  technology, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  ADB provided program preparatory TA to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Guizhou Vocational \nEducation Development Program (TA 8696). \n3  J. Whalley and X. Zhao. 2010. The Contribution of Human Capital to China's Economic Growth. NBER Working \nPaper. No. 16592.

", "2 \nagricultural engineering, and tourism. For example, highly skilled workers comprise only 0.6% of \nthe total workforce in the construction sector.5 This reflects several underlying issues, including \nlow enrollment in TVET colleges (lower than national targets), a high student\u2013teacher ratio \n(30:1, the fourth highest ratio nationally), inadequate relevance of the curricula to labor market \nneeds, and weak capacity of TVET teachers (with 16% failing to meet the requirement for \nacademic qualifications).6 As the economy continues to diversify and grow with new occupations \nneeding new and upgraded skills, so does the demand for skilled graduates. GPG\u2019s strategy is \nto  align TVET to the  needs  of  employers  and  raise  the  socioeconomic  status  of  its  poor \nhouseholds  by  improving  their  employment  prospects.7 To  achieve  this,  the  province  has \nlaunched the Guizhou Modern TVET System Establishment Plan 2013\u20132020, a medium-term \nsector  reform  program,  backed  by  increases  in  financing  since  2010  to  expand  student \nenrollment and improve the quality of demonstration TVET secondary schools and tertiary \ncolleges (collectively referred to as \u201cDemonstration TVET Institutions\u201d).8 \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n6.  The GVEDP will support the PRC\u2019s strategy to develop human resources and play a \ndemonstration role for other provinces in the western region. Strengthening human resources is \none of the priorities under the government\u2019s five-year plan and policy directives of the Third \nPlenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the \nNational Long-Term Strategy on Education Reform and Development, 2010\u20132020.9 The long-\nterm  strategy  aims  for  greater  education  investment  and  sets  TVET  targets,  including  for \ntransforming some schools and colleges into model or demonstration institutions to promote \nsharing of quality resources. The GVEDP will contribute to poverty reduction and inclusive \ngrowth in Guizhou Province by improving skills and employment outcomes. It is aligned with \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015  for  the  PRC,  the  recommendations  of  the \nMidterm Review of Strategy 2020 and with ADB\u2019s education sector strategies which prioritize \nTVET to address the human resource agenda.10 GVEDP also incorporates lessons from ADB\u2019s \npast  and  ongoing assistance  in  PRC\u2019s  education  sector,  including the  need  to  strengthen \neducation relevance to growth sectors. \n \n7.  The  results-based  lending  (RBL)  modality  is  the  most  suitable  to  support  GPG\u2019s  \nmedium-term TVET reforms. As part of consolidation strategy in the sector reform plan, a TVET \ntown has been established with joint financing from GPG, the Guiyang Municipal Government, \nand Qingzhen town government, where some 25 TVET institutions are relocating for increased \nclassroom and dormitory capacity, greater interactivity, and coordination with industry.11 These \ninstitutions have initiated their long-term plans with central, provincial, and local financing, but \nface financing and capacity gaps to realize their full potential as demonstration institutions. In \nsummary, Guizhou has a solid foundation for improving the TVET system, including policies \n                                                \n5  People\u2019s Republic of China. 2014.

To translate this \ncommitment into results and to keep the reforms on track, the nature of the challenges requires \na results- and system-based approach. The RBL will also reduce transaction costs associated \nwith investment project requirements, enable ADB\u2019s financing to leverage wider provincial TVET \nreforms, and strengthen the policy dialogue for future priorities of the TVET reform program. \n \n8.  ADB  financing  will  add  value  by  incentivizing  improvements  in  TVET  quality  and \ncapacity, particularly through teacher training, development of competency based curriculum, \nmodernized training facilities, and system-wide sharing of TVET reforms. ADB\u2019s convening \npower to bring international experience in using RBL to promote sector reform, knowledge \nsharing  and  dissemination  of  lessons  learned  is  highly  valued  by  the  PRC  and  Guizhou \ngovernments. This approach for using and strengthening country systems is appreciated and is \nalready being proposed for additional programs in the PRC.       \n \nC.  Program Scope \n \n9.  The  proposed  GVEDP  (Table  1)  will  support  the  Guizhou  Modern  TVET  System \nEstablishment Plan, 2013\u20132020 by developing vocational education in secondary schools and \ncolleges  that  meets  Guizhou\u2019s  long-term  development  needs  through  an  inclusive  and \nresponsive TVET system. An innovative program that uses RBL to keep the medium-term TVET \nreform  plan  on  track,  it  will  finance  part  of  the  government\u2019s  province  wide  TVET  reform \nprogram to support consolidation, increased education opportunities for students from poor \ncounties, and improved quality and capacity.  \n \nTable 1: Program Scope  \nItem  Government Program   ADB RBL Program (GVEDP) \nOutcome  A strengthened TVET system   An inclusive and responsive TVET system  \nKey outputs   (i)  Quality TVET institutions developed in  (i)  Quality of teaching in TVET \n  Guizhou    institutions strengthened \n(ii)  Quality of TVET improved  (ii)  Responsiveness of TVET institutions \n(iii) Industry partnerships expanded  to labor markets improved \n(iv) TVET system reformed  (iii)  TVET management capacity \n   strengthened \nActivity types   (i)  Development of provincial  (i)  Select demonstration TVET \ndemonstration TVET institutions  institutions\u2019 facilities upgraded  \n(ii)  CBC development  (ii)  Industry-responsive CBC developed \n(iii) Establishment of TVET resource center  and implemented by national \n(iv) Human resource development  demonstration schools and colleges \n(v)  Capacity development and coordination  (iii) Management training for strengthened \ncapacity conducted \n(iv) Provincial TVET management and \nmonitoring system established \n     \nProgram expenditure  $1,610 million (2016\u20132019)  $150 million \n     \nMain financiers and  GPG and local governments in Guizhou  ADB (100%) \nthe respective \nfinancing amounts \n     \nGeographic coverage  The whole of Guizhou Province  Demonstration TVET Institutions and \nGuizhou TVET Schools and Colleges \n     \nImplementation period  2013\u20132020  2016\u20132019 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CBC = competency-based curriculum, GPG = Guizhou Provincial Government, \nGVEDP = Guizhou Vocational Education Development Program, RBL = results-based lending, TVET = technical and \nvocational education and training. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n ", "4 \nD.  Program Results \n \n10.  In  line  with  national  education  reform  strategies,  the  GVEDP\u2019s  impact  will  be  an \nadequately  trained  human  resource  base  that  meets  the  province\u2019s  long-term  economic \ndevelopment needs and maintains social harmony by uplifting the status of its population from \npoor and ethnic minority communities. The outcome will be an inclusive and responsive TVET \nsystem,  measured  by  the  number  of  graduates  produced  by  the  Demonstration  TVET \nInstitutions. This will be achieved through the following outputs:  \n \n(i)  Output  1:  Quality  of  teaching  in  TVET  institutions  strengthened.  The \nGVEDP will transform the learning environment by modernizing and upgrading \nteaching and learning facilities in Demonstration TVET Institutions and training \nteachers  across  Guizhou  TVET  schools  and  colleges.  These  institutions  will \nprovide access to students and teachers from remote areas. To achieve this, the \nGVEDP  will  (a)  increase  the  number  of  practical  training  facilities  in \nDemonstration TVET Institutions, and (b) train teachers across the province to \nstrengthen their pedagogical skills and subject knowledge, including knowledge \nof  relevant  industry  occupational  standards,  and  use  of  student-centered \nteaching strategies and information and communication technology for teaching.  \n \n(ii)  Output  2:  Responsiveness  of  TVET  institutions  improved.  The \nDemonstration  TVET  Institutions  cater  to  competency-based  requirements  of \nindustry  in  priority  sectors,  including  construction,  logistics,  light  industry \nequipment manufacturing, information technology, agricultural engineering, and \ntourism. The GVEDP will develop an updated competency-based curriculum, with \nassociated  learning  material  and  teachers\u2019  guides,  that  meets  the  needs  of \noccupations in the priority industries. These will be developed and implemented \nby Demonstration TVET Institutions for selected majors. Additionally, training, \nstudent  knowledge,  and  practical  skills  will  be  enhanced  through  school\u2013\nenterprise cooperation. \n \n(iii)  Output  3:  TVET  management  capacity  strengthened.  The Guizhou TVET \nsystem  is  made  up  of  selected  demonstration  schools  and  colleges  located \nmostly in the main cities and the larger less-resourced schools and colleges \nscattered across the province. Provincial coordination mechanisms, particularly \nfor quality assurance and monitoring, are relatively weak. The GVEDP will (a) \ntrain  school  and  college  managers  to  improve  capacity  for  implementing \ninstitutional  TVET  reforms;  (b)  establish  and  strengthen  a  provincial  TVET \nmanagement  and  monitoring  system,  including  an  integrated  management \ninformation system (MIS) platform to improve program planning and coordination; \nand (c) improve provincial coordination between departments and institutions \nresponsible for TVET. \n \n11.  The RBL program has a robust and comprehensive results framework.12 The GVEDP \nwill support key results from this program results framework via disbursement-linked indicators \n(DLIs).13 The disbursement allocation is in Table 2. Six DLIs have been selected to focus on the \nmain elements of the results chain and framework and comprise activities and outputs that are \n                                                \n12 Program Results Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 DLI targets, definitions, verification protocols, and an indicative disbursement schedule are in Appendix 3.   \n ", "5 \nachievable and measurable during the four-year program.14 These DLIs represent ADB\u2019s value \nadded and are important measures of improved quality of teaching, improved responsiveness of \nTVET institutions to priority industry needs, and strengthened management of the TVET system. \nThe selected DLIs are essential for realizing the objectives of the provincial TVET plan to \nproduce more skilled graduates that are employable in Guizhou\u2019s priority sectors.   \n \nTable 2: Disbursement-Linked Indicators \n  Disbursement  Share of ADB \n  Allocated  Financing \nResults  Indicator  ($ million)  (%) \nOutcome    Skilled graduates relevant to Guizhou\u2019s   15.0  10.0 \nAn inclusive and responsive  economic growth sectors produced by \nTVET system developed  Demonstration TVET Institutions \nOutput 1        \nQuality of teaching in TVET  Better facilities for quality practical training  30.0  20.0 \ninstitutions strengthened  in Demonstration TVET Institutions     \n30.0  20.0 \nTeachers trained in Guizhou\u2019s TVET \nschools and colleges \nOutput 2  Industry-responsive CBC developed and  22.5  15.0 \nResponsiveness of TVET  implemented by Demonstration TVET     \ninstitutions improved   Institutions for selected majors     \nOutput 3  Managers trained in the Demonstration  22.5  15.0 \nTVET management capacity  TVET Institutions     \nstrengthened  30.0  20.0 \nProvincial TVET management and \nmonitoring system established \n  Total  150.0  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CBC = competency-based curriculum, TVET= technical and vocational education \nand training. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.   \n \nE.

Program financing. The government has requested a loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance the TVET reform program. GPG will provide $1,340 \nmillion for the program, and an estimated $120 million will come from student tuition fees. While \na small share, ADB financing adds value with incentives for quality and capacity improvements. \nThe financing plan is summarized in Table 4. The loan will have a 26-year term, including a \ngrace  period  of  5  years,  straight-line  repayment,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and program agreements. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 15.75 years and the \nmaturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per annum.15 \n \nTable 4: Program Financing Plan (TVET Reform Program) \nSource  Amount  Share of  \n   ($ million)  Total (%) \nGuizhou Provincial Government  1,340  83.2 \nTechnical and Vocational Education and Training Student Tuition Fees  120  7.5 \nAsian Development Bank (Ordinary capital resources loan)  150  9.3 \nTotal  1,610  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n14.  Disbursement arrangements. The ADB loan will be disbursed over 4 years subject to \nthe  achievement  and  verification  of  the  DLIs.  The  initial  disbursement  will  be  after  loan \neffectiveness and upon verification of the prior results, and includes advance financing for year \n1 DLIs in the amount of $15 million. GPG has put much effort and resources into its TVET \nimprovement plan. By 31 December 2015, the Guizhou Education Department (GED) will have \nprepared a provincial teachers\u2019 training plan, as well as a provincial management training plan, \nand at least eight GVEDP schools and colleges will have submitted to GED their training base \nupgradation plans for agreement by ADB. These actions, which will be taken 1 year before the \nplanned  loan  effectiveness,  will  provide  a  strong  foundation  for  implementing  the  GVEDP \neffectively.  Twenty  percent  of  the  loan  will  be  released  against  these  prior  results,  and \nsubsequent disbursements will be made after the relevant DLIs have been met. The Guizhou \nProvincial Finance Department (GPFD) will submit withdrawal applications along with evidence \nverifying the achievement of the DLIs. Disbursements are allowed for early or late achievement \nof DLIs. Partial disbursement is allowed for certain DLIs, as noted in the verification protocols. \nThe program management office (PMO) will collect all reports and information necessary to \nverify achievement and prepare a draft DLI achievement report that will be submitted to GPFD, \nwhich  will  prepare  the  withdrawal  application  and  submit  it  to  ADB  accompanied  by  the \nevidence of DLI achievement. Where ADB identifies issues with DLI achievement, it will relay its \nconcerns to the PMO and GPFD within 1 month of its receipt of the withdrawal application for \nfurther verification. The loan proceeds will be disbursed to the designated account maintained \nby GPFD. Onward disbursement will follow internal funds flow mechanisms established for \nGVEDP by GPG. \n \nF.

While there is reasonably sound capacity in GED to implement GVEDP effectively, \ncapacity development and monitoring of program actions are needed to ensure that the overall \nresults framework is implemented, monitored, and updated to remain a relevant feature of the \n                                                \n15 Loan Agreement and Program Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n ", "7 \nModern TVET System Establishment Plan. A detailed program action plan (PAP) has been \nagreed.16  \n \nG.  Technical Assistance \n \n16.  The capacity development TA is estimated to cost $650,000, of which $600,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). It \nhas four outputs:  (i) an enhanced GED monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system to ensure \neffective  implementation  of  the  DLIs  and  PAP by  developing  an  integrated  MIS to  enable \ncomprehensive  program  monitoring  (disaggregated  by  sex  and  ethnicity),  analysis,  and \nreporting; (ii) support for specific GVEDP activities, including TVET quality at the institutional \nand system level; (iii) capacity building for strengthening program systems, including fiduciary, \nsafeguards and M&E; and (iv) action research and knowledge sharing, and dissemination of \ngood practices and lessons learned from GVEDP implementation to other provinces in the PRC. \nGPG, as executing agency of the TA, will support the TA in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, and other in-kind contributions.17 \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  GPG will be the executing agency and will set up an interagency program leading group \nthat  includes  representatives  from  all  relevant  provincial  departments  to  oversee  GVEDP \nprogress.  GED  has  been  assigned  to  lead  and  oversee  TVET  reform,  but  most  GVEDP \nimplementation activity has been delegated to participating schools. A PMO will be formally \nestablished by GPG to be responsible for day-to-day coordination, program management, and \nprogress monitoring. The implementation period of the proposed program is 1 January 2016 to \n31 December 2019, with activities undertaken during 2015 qualifying for loan disbursement \nunder \u201cpayment for prior results.\u201d18 \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n18.  Technical due diligence has been performed to ensure that the intended outcome of \nGVEDP (i) is achievable through the planned program activities, (ii) is aligned with government \neconomic development planning, (iii) has a clear results framework with a well-defined baseline \nperformance, (iv) is economically justified, and (v) is financially viable and sustainable. This due \ndiligence is presented in a program soundness assessment, with further technical and financial \ndetails provided in other linked documents.19  \n \n19.  The economic analysis confirms that public financing is justified for the program, is \nprovided in an efficient manner, and is sustainable. Financial viability is largely assured as \nexpenditure  estimates  are  based  on  recent  local  experience,  and  are  budgeted  for  in \ngovernment plans with financing sources already identified. Incremental operation costs are \nwithin the planned growth of the GPG education budget as TVET is an increasingly important \neducation sector priority. The economic justification for the GVEDP stems from (i) the increasing \ndemand from employers for skilled workers as the economy further modernizes and develops, \n                                                \n16 Program Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 ADB. 2013.

GVEDP has a strong pro-poor and gender focus. Its emphasis on TVET quality and \ncapacity improvement will result in wider opportunities for both female and male students. In the \nPRC, students from poorer and predominantly rural backgrounds  commonly rely on TVET \neducation as a means to acquire skills that would allow them to gain employment in the modern \nindustrial economy. GVEDP will also benefit ethnic minority students, a disproportionate number \nof whom come from high-poverty rural counties. The results framework has a sex-disaggregated \nbaseline and target indicators justifying the \u201csome gender elements\u201d categorization.  \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n21.  Monitoring and evaluation system. The M&E system assessment confirms that MIS in \nthe schools captures sex-disaggregated data on students, teachers, and managers, and will \nhelp track the outputs and outcome. However, it does not currently capture data on ethnicity as \na matter of routine and M&E arrangements for TVET at the provincial level are quite fragmented. \nThe TA will develop an integrated MIS platform within GED to monitor and report on TVET \nsystem performance and inclusiveness (DLI 6).   \n \n22.  Fiduciary systems. GVEDP will use country fiduciary systems with respect to public \nfinancial  management,  procurement,  and  anticorruption.  These  systems  were  assessed  to \ndetermine  the  degree  to  which  they  will  be  able  to  manage  fiduciary  risks  and  provide \nassurance that RBL program funds are used for their intended purposes, with due consideration \nfor economy and efficiency.20 Mitigating measures to manage fiduciary risks are included in the \nPAP and the program implementation document.21   \n \n23.  The  financial  management  assessment  confirms  that  an  adequate  financial \nmanagement  system  exists  in  GPG  and  the  Demonstration  TVET  Institutions,  with  sound \nbudgeting, payment, accounting, and auditing procedures and practices. The overall risk level is \nlow to moderate, with weak internal audit capacity as the main constraint. The government \nrequires  separate  management,  utilization,  accounting,  and  auditing  of  foreign  funds.  The \nGuizhou  Provincial  Audit  Office  will  be  delegated  by  the  PRC\u2019s  National  Audit  Office  to \nundertake  annual  audits  to  confirm  all  ADB  loan  proceeds  have  been  used  for  legitimate \npurposes under GVEDP. An annual audit report will be submitted within 6 months of the end of \neach fiscal year. \n \n24.  The  procurement  system  assessment  confirms  that  the  procurement  framework  is \naligned with the principles of  competition, efficiency, economy, transparency, fairness, and \nequal  opportunity,  and  that  reasonable  capacity  is  in  place  to  carry  out  procurement  in \naccordance with these principles. Procurement involving high-value contracts will be excluded \nfrom ADB funding.22  \n \n25.  The  anticorruption  assessment  concludes  that  the  risks  of  fraud  and  corruption  for \n                                                \n20 Program Fiduciary Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n21 Program Implementation Document (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Amounts are currently $50 million for works, turnkey and supply, and installation contracts; $30 million for goods; \n$20 million for information technology systems and nonconsulting services; and $15 million for consulting services. \n ", "9 \nGVEDP and the education system are limited and similar to other sectors. This is mainly in the \nareas of financial management and procurement, involving lapses in individual integrity rather \nthan system wide risks. The PRC has promulgated extensive laws and regulations for clean \ngovernment and anticorruption, and in recent years far more actions are being taken against the \nperpetrators of fraud and corrupt practices. The government is also taking more action to make \nit  easier to  report  suspicions,  and  to  strengthen  discipline  inspection  and  prosecutions.  In \nGuizhou,  GED  has  also  issued  documents  to  regulate  teacher  behavior  and  enhance \nanticorruption in the education sector. The Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, \nand Other Prohibited Activities in Results-Based Lending for Programs were explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and GPG (footnote 19). \n  \n26.  Safeguard systems. A program safeguard systems assessment was prepared for the \nGVEDP and discussed with program stakeholders.23 The assessment confirms the safeguard \ncategorization of B for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Activities \nunder Output 1 will involve civil works on existing campuses that may have some temporary and \nsite  specific  environmental  impacts,  with  ongoing  resettlement  with  some  households  in \ntransition due to land acquired historically to construct new TVET campuses for some of the \nDemonstration TVET Institutions. GVEDP\u2019s activities have impacts on ethnic minorities that are \nmainly positive, with the need to maintain or improve inclusiveness. Good practices include          \n(i) the preparation of a strategic environment assessment for the Qingzhen TVET town, as well \nas an environmental impact assessment, including an environmental management plan for each \nTVET  campus  targeted  under  Output  1;  (ii)  land  acquisition,  compensation,  and  fund \ndisbursement were done in accordance with applicable PRC and local regulations, and affected \nhouseholds were satisfied with the compensation package; and (iii) the poverty and social \nanalysis confirmed that the PRC and Guizhou have a supportive policy framework for ethnic \nminorities and systemic issues are related to their inclusion. Specific weaknesses include (i) the \nmethod and timing of disclosure of environmental impact and monitoring reports, and public \nengagement during the construction of new facilities; (ii) follow up monitoring to determine \nwhether adequate housing has been obtained and whether income restoration measures have \nbeen effective; and (iii) weak systemic disaggregated monitoring and reporting on enrollment, \nretention and graduation rates. \n \n27.  Agreed actions to strengthen program safeguard systems include (i) for environment, \nmonitoring, reporting, and public engagement arrangements (covering information disclosure, \nconsultation, and grievance redress); (ii) for involuntary resettlement, the engagement of an \nexternal monitor to conduct semiannual monitoring and reporting on the progress of pending \nresettlement and livelihood restoration activities, and a sample survey of affected households to \nconfirm income recovery and resolution of grievances (if any); and (iii) for indigenous people, \nbetter monitoring, reporting, and consulting to promote inclusiveness. Institutional strengthening \nfor program safeguards will be supported by the capacity development TA. \n \nC.  Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures  \n \n28.  An integrated risk assessment considered potential risks associated with (i) program \nresults,  (ii)  expenditures  and  financing,  (iii)  fiduciary  systems,  and  (iv)  the  operating \nenvironment.  The  main  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5.24 The \nassessment concludes that benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs, with \noverall moderate program risk.  \n                                                \n23  Program Safeguard Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n ", "10 \nTable 5: Summary of Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Ratings  Key Mitigating Measures \nResults     \nTVET institutions are unable to recruit  H  Recognized by GPG as a key issue in the Guizhou Modern TVET \nquality teachers and instructors to deliver    System (2013\u20132020).
