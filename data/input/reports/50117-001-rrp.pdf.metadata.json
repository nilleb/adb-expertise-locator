The Shah Deniz gas field is one of the world\u2019s largest gas fields, \nwith around 1,000 cubic meters (bcm) of gas reserves. In 1996, the State Oil Company of the \nAzerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) signed the Shah Deniz Production Sharing Agreement (SDPSA) \nwith  six  foreign  oil  and  gas  companies  including  BP  (the  operator)  for  the  exploration, \ndevelopment, and production of natural resources from the Shah Deniz gas field. Construction \nand development of Shah Deniz Stage 1 (SD1) started in 2003 and gas production commenced \nin  December  2006.  In  September  2013,  subsequent  to  the  discovery  of  a  new  high-pressure \nreservoir within the Shah Deniz gas field, gas sales agreements (GSAs) for the expansion of the \ngas  field  were  signed  with  nine  European  energy  companies.  In  December  2013,  the  SDPSA \npartners  announced  their  investment  decision  for  the  development  of  Shah  Deniz  Stage  2 \n(SD2). \n \nSGC  has  a  16.67%  interest  in  the  SDPSA.3 SGC  approached  the  Asian  Development \n3. \nBank (ADB) in January 2016 to partly finance its share of the capital expenditure for the Shah \nDeniz  Gas  Field  Expansion  project.4 From  initial  discussions  between  ADB  and  SGC,  ADB \ndetermined  that  the  project  possessed  sound  fundamentals,  including  high-quality  project \npreparatory  work,  an  experienced  operator,  and  strong  local  employment-generation  potential. \nThe  project  is  the  largest  gas  field  development  project  to  date  in  Azerbaijan,  and  will  help \nincrease the total gas production in Azerbaijan from 20 bcm per annum in 2015 to 36 bcm per \nannum  by  2022.  ADB\u2019s  familiarity  with  the  project  (through  its  earlier  financing  to  one  of  the \nother  parties  to  the  SDPSA5)  and  its  experience  in  structuring  emerging  and  frontier  market \ntransactions  will  be  crucial  for  the  successful  financing  of  the  project  and  to  demonstrate  the \nbankability of large-scale financings for future upstream and downstream processing projects in \nAzerbaijan. \n \n4. \n \n5. \nSD2 includes the construction of two new bridge-linked offshore production platforms, 26 \nsubsea  wells  drilled  with  two  semi-submersible  rigs,  500  kilometers  of  subsea  pipelines,  and \nexpansion of the onshore gas processing terminal at Sangachal. Gas extracted from SD2 will be \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2016.

A steering committee \nconsisting  of  an  equal  number  of  members  from  each  SDPSA  partner  is  responsible  for \nmanaging  the  consortium.  BP,  designated  as  the  operator  for  the  project  by  the  SDPSA \npartners,  is  responsible  for  construction  and  operation  of  the  Shah  Deniz  gas  field.  The \nremaining SDPSA partners, including SGC, are purely financial investors and are not involved in \nday-to-day operation of the project. Table 1 lists the composition of the SDPSA. \n\n \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n \n7. \n \n8. \n \n9. \nThe  sponsors  of  SGC  are  the  Republic  of  Azerbaijan  and  SOCAR.  The  Azerbaijan \neconomy  depends  heavily  on  the  hydrocarbon  sector,  which  represented  about  31%  of  the \ngross  domestic  product  and  87%  of  merchandise  exports  in  2015.6 The  sharp  decline  in  oil \nprices  in  2015\u20132016  has  led  to  a significant  drop  in foreign  exchange  reserves  to  $5  billion  in \n2016 from a peak of $15 billion in 2014, resulting in a devaluation of the Azerbaijan manat by \n50% against the United States dollar. The Azerbaijan economy is expected to contract by 1% in \n2016. Sustained investment in the expansion of the Shah Deniz gas field and timely completion \nof  the  project  are  important  to  return  the  Azerbaijan  economy  to  real  positive  growth  in  2017. \nStandard  &  Poor\u2019s  credit  rating  for  Azerbaijan  as  of  July  2016  stood  at  BB+  with  a  negative \noutlook.  SOCAR  is  a  vertically  integrated  oil  and  gas  company  active  in  exploration  and \nproduction of oil and gas, production of petroleum products and petrochemicals, and marketing \nand  distribution  of  these  products  in  Azerbaijan  and  international  markets.  SOCAR  is  100% \nowned by the Republic of Azerbaijan. SOCAR had total revenues of AZN33,103 million in 2015, \nwith an operating income of AZN1,287 million and a loss after tax of AZN1,785 million. As of 31 \nDecember  2015,  the  total  assets  of  SOCAR  were  AZN39,954  million  and  its  net  worth  was \nAZN14,648 million. \n \n10. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nImpacts.  The  successful  development  of  SD2  will  lead  to  the  following  beyond-project \n\n11. \ndevelopment impacts: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  overall  Azerbaijan  natural  gas  sector  will  expand  by  encouraging  foreign \noperators  to  develop  similar  gas  reserves,  bringing  in  much-needed  technical \nknowledge, development experience, and foreign capital. \nThe  increase  in  gas  production  and  opening  of  the  European  market  to \nAzerbaijan gas exports will improve regional integration and diversify Azerbaijani \nexports of natural gas. \n\n                                                 \n6  Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services. 2016. Azerbaijan Country Rating Update, 29 January. London. \n\n\f(iii) \n\nThe successful experience of foreign commercial banks financing a large project \nin Azerbaijan will help increase foreign direct investment for the development of \nother  upstream  gas  field  development  projects  as  well  as  midstream  and \ndownstream petrochemical projects, which use natural gas as feedstock. \n \n\n12. \nOutcome. The project will result in successful production of natural gas from SD2, with \nfirst  production  estimated  in  2018  and  peak  incremental  production  of  16 bcm  per  annum \nachieved  by  2022. The  increased gas  production for  the  export market  will  result  in  increased \nrevenues for the government.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \nOutputs. The successful implementation of the project will result in two outputs: (i) the \n13. \nenvironmentally  safe  and  technically  sound  development  of  the  largest  proven  gas  reserve  in \nAzerbaijan,  and  (ii)  the  creation  of  over  19,000  temporary  jobs  during  construction  and  1,800 \npermanent jobs during operation of the project. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n \n\n14. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports  two  of \nthe  ten  strategic  priorities  under  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020:  infrastructure,  and \nregional cooperation and integration.7 ADB is committed to be a provider of catalytic solutions to \nupper  middle-income  countries  such  as  Azerbaijan,  which  include  increasing  leveraging \nopportunities  with  private  capital.  The  project  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy,  2014\u20132018  for  Azerbaijan,  which  supports  ADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  development  of \nnatural  resources  in  instances  where  it  would  be  instrumental  in  attracting  third-party \ncommercial sources of credit.8  \n \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \n15. \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy,  which  provides  for  assistance  to  gas  field  development, \nand transportation and distribution of gas.9 The project promotes effective regional cooperation \nin  the  energy  sector  to  strengthen  energy  security  and  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Regional \nCooperation and Integration Strategy as well as the Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation \nand  Integration. 10  In  2008,  ADB  endorsed  the  Extractive  Industries  Transparency  Initiative \n(EITI),  which  encourages  governments  to  disclose  their  revenues,  as  well  as  companies  to \npublicize  their  payments  from  oil,  gas,  and  mining  projects,  in  order  to  promote  transparency \nand good governance. Azerbaijan has been a member country of the EITI since 2005 and was \nclassified  as  an  EITI-compliant  country  from  2009  to  2015.  In  April  2015,  Azerbaijan\u2019s  EITI \nstatus was downgraded from compliant to candidate based on concerns related to the ability of \ncivil society to participate meaningfully in the EITI process in the country. Azerbaijan is currently \nimplementing  corrective  actions  recommended  by  the  EITI.  Notwithstanding  Azerbaijan\u2019s  EITI \nstatus, the operator of the project, BP, regularly discloses production volumes as well as capital \nand  operating  expenditure  incurred  in  connection  with  the  project.  SOFAZ  also  discloses  the \nrevenue earned from the project along with taxes and other payments received from the SDPSA \npartners. The SDPSA has also been publicly disclosed. \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2014.

In August 2015, the ADB Board of Directors approved a loan facility of up \nto $475 million to Lukoil Overseas Shah Deniz to partly fund its share of the capital expenditure \nfor the Shah Deniz Gas Field Expansion Project (footnote 5). In August 2011, the ADB Board of \nDirectors  approved  financial  assistance  for  the  Kandym  Gas  Field  Development  Project  in \nUzbekistan, comprising a loan of up to $100 million and a partial risk guarantee of up to $200 \nmillion  to  commercial  lenders for  development  of the  Kandym gas field  in  Uzbekistan.11 ADB\u2019s \ncontinued  engagement  in  oil  and  gas  in  the  region  will  help  improve  standards  of  corporate \ngovernance and transparency in the sector. \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n17. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n\nTable 4: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nArrangements \nExploration of, development of, and production from the Shah Deniz gas field is being \ncarried  out  under  the  SDPSA,  which  sets  the  basic  principles,  rights  and  obligations, \nproduction  sharing,  cost  reimbursement,  and other  terms  and  conditions  for  the  Shah \nDeniz project.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \nThe  SDPSA  governs  the  main  compensation  and  cost  recovery  mechanism,  which \ncompensates  the  SDPSA  operator  (BP)  for  all  operating  costs.  The  balance  of  the \nproduction  is  shared  between  the  Government  of  Azerbaijan  and  SDPSA  partners \naccording  to  an  industry-typical  R-factor  model,  which  compensates  the  SDPSA \npartners at higher levels when capital expenditure is higher. \nSGC\u2019s management structure consists of the general assembly of its shareholders, its \nsupervisory board and its general director, who together with other officers of SGC, are \nresponsible for the day-to-day management of SGC. \nGas production from Shah Deniz Stage 2 is expected to commence in 2018, gradually \nramping up during 2019\u20132021, and stabilizing at 16 bcm per annum from 2022 onward. \n\nA  contracts  committee  and  a  management  committee  supervise  the  procurement  of \ngoods and services in line with the provisions of the JOA. BP, as SDPSA operator, will \nconstruct the main offshore works and will subcontract specialized subsea construction \nworks and onshore construction works to a number of contractors. \nBP,  the  SDPSA  operator,  is  one  of  the  world\u2019s  leading  integrated  oil  and  gas \ncompanies.  BP  has  been  operating  in  Azerbaijan  since  1994  and  has  adequate \nexperience and capability to execute the project. \n\nThe  Consolidated  Upstream  Purchase  Agreement  governs  the  sale  of  gas  by  the \nSDPSA partners to AGSC. BP is appointed as the sellers\u2019 representative and agent for \nthe sale of gas to AGSC.

ADB\u2019s participation in \nthe  transaction  has  prompted  the  disclosure  of  certain  safeguards-related \ndocuments, notably the fishing livelihood management plan. \nADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  transaction  will  help  the  government  to  continue  the \ndevelopment of one of its largest revenue-generating assets in challenging times \nglobally for oil and gas investments. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\n23. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\n \n24. \nConstruction  and  completion  risk.  BP  is  responsible  for  the  construction  of  the \nproject.  The  construction  plan  is  highly  complex,  but  benefits  from  BP\u2019s  extensive  technical \nexperience.  Construction  is  progressing  as  per  schedule  with  adequate  contingencies  for  any \nincrease  in  project  costs.  However,  challenges  in  project  completion  remain,  and  the \ncomprehensive government guarantee for the tenor of the loan is a useful credit enhancement. \n \n25. \n \n26. \n \n27. \n \n28. \n \n29. \nOperations  risk.  The  SDPSA  operator,  BP,  has  extensive  experience  in  the \ndevelopment  and  operation  of  gas  fields  in  Algeria,  Angola,  Azerbaijan,  Indonesia,  the  United \nKingdom, and the United States. BP has successfully operated SD1 since 2006, which provides \ninvaluable  technical  knowledge  and  clear  understanding  of  operational  issues.  The  operating \nand financial strength of BP gives lenders comfort that the operations risk is manageable. \n \n30. \n \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n31. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \ncategory  A  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous  peoples.  The  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  project  have  been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts  are  incorporated  in  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans.  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  requirements  for  financing  of  existing  facilities,  an  environmental  and  social \ncompliance audit for the existing facilities of SD1 and ongoing construction activities as part of \nSD2 was carried out in July 2015 and updated in August 2016. The updated audit did not find \nany  noncompliance  with  ADB  policies  associated  with  the  ongoing  construction  activities  that \nwould  require  the  establishment  of  a  corrective  action  plan.  The  institutional  capacity  and \ncommitment  of  SGC  to  cause  the  operator,  BP,  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \nSangachal  Bay  in  the  Caspian  Sea,  where  the  project  is  located,  contains  key \n32. \nbiodiversity  areas.  According  to  the  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment  (ESIA),  the \nShah Deniz contract area, existing terminal boundary, and SD2 expansion area are not located \nin  the  key  biodiversity  areas.  The  SD2  contract  area  overlaps  with  the  migration  routes  and \nspawning areas of some fish species. The ESIA indicates that construction impacts are minimal, \nwith fish having previously demonstrated avoidance behaviors. Fishing is the dominant threat to \nfish  populations  in  the  Caspian  Sea.  Existing  fish  population  monitoring  programs  established \nfor  SD1  are  satisfactory  to  ADB  and  will  continue.  The  contract  area  may  have  some  overlap \nwith Caspian seal migration pathways. BP engages with and provides support to Caspian Sea \nconservation programs, which provide a whole-of-sea approach to seal conservation. BP has in \nplace  an  ecological  and  wildlife  management  plan.  ADB  will  require  the  borrower  to  procure \n\n\fwithin  its  project  powers,  and  will  monitor  that  the  operator  implements  the  project,  in \ncompliance with the relevant plans and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. \n \n33. \nUnder  the  terms  of  the  SDPSA,  land  for  terminal  operations  and  any  other  facilities \nneeded  are  to  be  acquired  by  SOCAR  and  made  available  to  the  operator.  SOCAR  has \ntransferred  all  lands  required  for  the  SD2  project  to  the  operator.  The  audit  confirmed  that  no \nresettlement issues, including access rights or temporary usage of lands, existed as a result of \nthe  SD1  facilities  and  the  sites  proposed  for  expansion  of  the  terminal  as  part  of  SD2.  No \nindigenous  communities  are  located  in  the  project  influence  area,  so  impacts  on  indigenous \npeoples  are  not  expected.  The  operator  has  prepared  and  implemented  a  small-scale  fishing \nlivelihood  management  plan  to  address  economic  displacement  impacts  on  48  fishermen \ninvolved  in  small-scale  fishing  activities  resulting  from  SD2  pipeline  installation  works  in \nSangachal  Bay,  owing  to  enforcement  of  a  marine  exclusion  zone  for  9.5  months  from \nDecember 2014 to September 2015. All affected fishermen have resumed their fishing activities \nat  the  same  location,  with  the  exception  of  six  fishermen  who  voluntarily  chose  to  move  to \nanother  location  about  40 kilometers from  Sangachal  Bay.  These  six fishermen  have  reported \nadditional  impacts  due  to  increased  transportation  costs  and  lower  productivity  at  the  new \nfishing  location.  The  operator  is  working  out  arrangements  to  address  these  unanticipated \nimpacts  in  consultation  with  the  affected  fishermen.  The  operator  will  monitor  the  fishing \nlivelihood  management  plan  implementation  and  prepare  a  closure  report  once  all  residual \ngrievances are satisfactorily addressed. \n \n34. \nThe  borrower  will  be  required  to  procure  within  its  project  powers  that  the  operator \ncomplies with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001), will \ntake  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards. 12  The \nborrower will report regularly to ADB on the compliance of the operator (and its contractors) with \nsuch  laws.  Information  disclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people  are  expected  to  be \nconducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n35. \nSGC was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\n36. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\n37. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter), 13  ADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the \nGovernment of Azerbaijan has no objection to the proposed assistance to SGC.
