An  environmental \nimpact  assessment  was \nundertaken,  and  the  summary  circulated  to  the  Board  and  made \npublic  through  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  website  on \n31 May 2006.  \n \nThe  Project  is  located  in  southern  Gansu  province,  one  of  the \npoorest  areas  in  the  PRC.  With  a  per  capita  gross  domestic \nproduct  45%  of  the  national  average,  Gansu  ranks  30th  among \nthe  31 administrative  areas.  The  Project  is  designed  to  promote \nsustainable economic growth by constructing an important section \nof  the  high-priority  Lanzhou\u2013Haikou  corridor  and  improving  the \nlocal  road  transport  system.  The  Project  will  (i) provide  an \nintegrated \nin  southern  Gansu  by \ntransport  network \n(km)  Wudu\u2013Guanzigou \nkilometer \nconstructing \nexpressway  and  upgrading  its  associated  357  km  rural  roads, \n(ii) improve  road  transport  services  by  constructing  200  township \nbus  stations  and  pilot-testing  the  road  transport  action  plan,  and \n(iii)  improve  corporate  governance  and  strengthen  institutional \ncapacity through providing consulting services and training. \n \nRemote  and  isolated  with  harsh  natural  conditions,  the  project \narea suffers from inadequate road infrastructure, which is a major \ncause of the high incidence of poverty. Within this area, the focal \nprefecture of the Project (Longnan) has rural poverty incidence of \n42%, and 84% of the population lives in rural areas. About 57% of \nthe  169  townships  do  not  have  all-weather  roads,  while  24%  of \nthe 3,237 villages have no road access and 25% lack bus service. \nNational Highway 212 is in poor condition, and provides the only \nsubstantial link to Sichuan province, and there are no rail lines or \nother  non-road  transport  modes.  Residents  have  limited  mobility \nbeyond  their  localities.  It  takes  10\u201316  hours  to  reach  Lanzhou, \nXi\u2019an,  Chengdu,  and  Chongqing  because  of  poor  and  worsening \nroad  conditions.  Despite  the  region\u2019s  economic  potential,  weak \nroad  infrastructure  impedes  socioeconomic  development.  The \nroad  transport  network  in  southern Gansu  needs  to  be  improved \nto ease access to essential services and to link this poor, isolated \nregion to economic growth centers.  \n \n \n \n\nthe  134 \n\n\fiv \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan \n\nFinancing Plan  \n \n\nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\nto \n\nthe \n\nimprove \n\ninvestment  environment  and \n\nThe Project reflects the ADB road  sector operational strategy for \nthe  PRC,  which  includes  removing  infrastructure  constraints  and \nsupporting  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  The  Project  supports \nthe  Government\u2019s  Western  Region  Development  Strategy,  which \nliving \naims \nconditions.  The project expressway will reduce the trip length by \n50% (from 270 km to 134 km) and cut journey time by 75% (from \n6.5\u20139.0 hours to 1.5\u20132.0 hours). In addition, project interventions \nin  rural  road  upgrading,  township  bus  station  construction,  road \ntransport  action  plan  pilot-testing  and  training  of  local  transport \nauthorities will improve the availability, affordability, and efficiency \nof  the  road  transport  system;  increase  accessibility;  and  reduce \npoverty and isolation. \n \nThe  Project  will  help  promote  sustainable  economic  growth  and \nreduce  poverty  in  southern  Gansu.  It  will  develop  an  efficient, \nsafe, and reliable road transport system. It will also improve rural \npeople\u2019s  access \nincome-earning  opportunities, \nto  markets, \neducation and health services, and social activities. \n \nThe Project will (i) construct a 134-km toll expressway from Wudu \nto  Guanzigou,  (ii)  upgrade  357  km  of  rural  roads,  (iii) construct \n200  township  bus  stations,  (iv)  pilot-test  a  road  transport  action \nplan,  (v) improve  corporate  governance,  and  (vi)  strengthen \ninstitutional capacity by providing consulting services and training. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $1,660  million \nequivalent.  Of  the  $300  million  ADB  loan,  $20  million  will  finance \nrural roads and township bus stations.  \n\n($ million)\n\n% \n18.0 \n43.0 \n20.0 \n19.0 \n100.0 \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nBank of Communications \nMinistry of Communications \nGansu Provincial Government \nTotal \n\nAmount \n300.0 \n712.6 \n332.0 \n315.4 \n1,660.0 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nA loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including \na  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \nfacility,  a \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \nThe ADB loan proceeds will be made available by the Borrower to \nthe  Gansu  provincial  government  (GPG),  which  will  onlend  the \nloan  proceeds  to  Gansu  Changda  Highway  Company  Limited \n\nlending \n\n\f \n\nv\n\n(GCHC) with the same financial terms and conditions as those of \nthe  ADB  loan  with  GCHC  bearing  the  interest  rate  variation  and \nforeign exchange risks. \n \nUntil 30 June 2012 \n \n31 December 2011 \n\n \nGansu  Changda  Highway  Company  Limited  will  be \nthe \nimplementing  agency  responsible  for  the  project  expressway.  The \nGansu  Provincial  Communications  Department  will  implement  the \nrural road and transport service components. \n \nGansu Provincial Communications Department (GPCD)  \n \nGoods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Civil works for the \nexpressway  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive \nbidding,  and  the  civil  works  for  the  rural  roads  and  township  bus \nstations  through  national  competitive  bidding  and  shopping. \nEquipment  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive \nbidding.  Advance  procurement  action \nfor  civil  works,  and \nretroactive financing for eligible expenditures related to civil works, \nestimated at $30 million, were approved on 24 May 2006.  \n \nThe  ADB  loan  will  finance  56  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services for construction supervision; provide expertise \nin  structure  engineering,  traffic  safety  engineering,  and  road \nmaintenance;  and  formulate  a  capacity  development  program. \nThe  international  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  a  firm, \nbased  on  full  technical  proposals  using  the  quality-  and  cost-\nbased selection method in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants.  GPCD  will  engage  and \nfinance \n7,600 person-months  of  national  consulting  services,  including \n350  for  rural  roads  and  transport  services,  to  ensure  proper \ndesign, supervision, and project management, as well as to train \ncounty  communications  bureau  staff;  320  for  environmental \nprotection;  and  30  for  monitoring  socioeconomic  and  poverty \nimpacts. The national consultants will be recruited in accordance \nwith government procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \nThe  expressway  will  take  5\u20137  hours  off  travel  time  and  shorten \n136  km  traveling  distance  between  Wudu  and  Guanzigou. \nImproved  rural  roads  will  link  villages  to  the  higher  levels  of  the \nroad  network  and  hence  to  the  regional  and  national  economy. \nImproved  rural  transport  services  will  link  rural  households  with \nthe  wider  economy  through  passenger  and  other  motor  vehicles \noperating  on  those  roads.  A  developed  transport  network  will \nintegrate  poor,  isolated  regions  with  the  centers  of  economic \ngrowth.

The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  4.6%,  which  is \nhigher than the real weighted average cost of capital. The Project \nwill  benefit  about  4.6  million  people,  of  whom  almost  37%  are \npoor. \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  road  users  (e.g.,  passengers, \ntraders, transport providers, and bus and truck operators), as well \nas  labor,  local  economy  and  the  private  sector.  The  Project  will \nhelp  reduce  traffic  accidents,  vehicle  emissions,  and  traffic noise \nin  the  corridor.  The  Project  will  also  boost  tourism.  Rural \nhouseholds are also important beneficiaries, and will benefit from \nincreased  incomes  through  better  access  to  markets,  off-farm \nopportunities, and also from better access to social services. It will \ncreate  about  56,000  person-years  of  unskilled  jobs  during \nconstruction and 1,700 full-time jobs during operation. Over 60% \nof  the  unskilled  jobs  will  be  filled  by  the  poor,  with  an  estimated \ntotal  of  CNY200 million  in  wage  payments  annually  during \nconstruction,  and  another  CNY15  million  of  wage  payments \nexpected to go to the poor annually after start of project operation. \nThe  ability  and  skills  of  local  communities  will  be  greatly \nenhanced  as  a  result  of  several  years  of  employment  in  the \nproject-related activities. The improved local transport system will \nenhance  the  local  investment  climate  to  attract  more  investment \nto the region and act as a catalyst for future investment.  \n \nThe  Project  has  been  formulated  to  reduce  technical,  economic, \nfinancial,  safety,  and  social  risks.  The  main  technical  risks  are \nassociated with the construction of 61 tunnels, including one that \nis 8 km in length. Consultants have reviewed the proposed design \nand construction methods, and prequalification of contractors will \nfocus  on  their  financial  and  technical  capabilities  in  handling \nsimilar  complex  works.  During  construction,  monitoring  and \ncontract  management  information  systems  will  be  set  up  to \nquickly \nthem.  The \ncontractors will be required to strictly enforce working safety rules \nand  measures.  GPCD  has  experience  and  has  performed \nsatisfactorily in internationally financed projects. \n \nThe  financial  risk  associated  with  construction  and  operation  of \nthe  expressway  will  depend  on  levels  of  traffic,  the  capital  cost, \nand toll rates. To mitigate the financial risks, the GCHC will build \nup  a  commercial  business  environment \nfor  expressway \noperations, the Project will receive substantial injections of equity \nfrom  central  and  provincial  governments,  and  a  market-oriented \ntoll  structure  will  be  adopted.  The  Project  has  no  major \nenvironmental, resettlement, or HIV/AIDS infection risks, and has \nin  place.  GPCD \nmitigation  and  monitoring  mechanisms \ndemonstrated  a  high \nthe \nin  preparing \nresettlement  plan,  environmental  impact  assessment,  and  social \naction development plan.

\n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  PRC  has  made  remarkable  progress  in  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction. \nGross domestic product (GDP) has grown more than 9% per annum since the late 1970s, and \nthe  poverty  incidence  declined  from  33.0%  in  1990  to  13.4%  in  2003.1 Yet,  the  fight  against \npoverty is far from over. The living standards of hundreds of millions of people, particularly in the \nwestern  region,  need  to  be  raised.  The  inadequate  road  network,  road  transport  bottlenecks, \nand  the  resulting  high  transport  costs  and  poor  transport  services  are  a  major  constraint  on \nefficient, sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. \n \n3. \nThe  change  in  the  economy\u2019s  structure  and  increasing  diversification  has  resulted  in  a \nshift  toward  road  transport.2 In  2005,  the  PRC  had  31.8  million  vehicle  fleet  (trucks,  cars,  and \nbuses), and 11.5 million other motorized vehicles (mainly motor-tricycle and agricultural trucks). \nThe privately owned fleet increased from 0.3 million vehicles in 1985 to 23.7 million in 2005, or \n24%  per  year  on  average.  Given  the  low  number  of  vehicles  (2.4)  per  100  people,  large \ninvestments in automotive manufacturing, and reduced tariffs following the PRC\u2019s accession to \nthe  Word  Trade  Organization,  the  vehicle  fleet  will  likely  continue  to  grow  rapidly.  Economic \ngrowth and the rising share of road transport will continue to place heavy demands on the road \nnetwork and intensify the need for capacity expansion in the coming years. \n \nDespite  the  massive  investment  in  road  infrastructure,3 the  road  transport  sector  still \n4. \nconstitutes a serious obstacle to sustainable economic growth, particularly in the western region. \nThe total PRC road network reached 1.93 million kilometers (km) in 2005, of which 1.59 million \nkm  were  classified.4 Expressways  and  class-I  highways  accounted  for  4%  of  the  total  length, \nand class-II highways for about 13%, while 83% (highways in class-III and below) are medium- \nto low-grade paved roads and gravel roads. With only 20 km of roads per 100 km2, and 1.47 km \nper 1,000 inhabitants, road network density is still among lowest in the world. The road network \nis mainly concentrated in east PRC, where road density is 50 km per 100 km2. Providing basic \nroad  access  in  vast  regions,  particularly  in  the  interior  provinces  where  incomes  are  low, \nremains a challenge. Details of the road sector analysis are in Appendix 2. \n \n5. \nThe rural road network is underdeveloped in extent and quality; 38,426 villages, mostly \nin the western region, have no road access at all. Nearly 10,000 townships and 300,000 villages \n\n                                                 \n1  The  number  of  poor  living  below  the  international  standard  of  $1  per  day  (in  purchasing  power  parity  terms),  fell \nfrom 377.3 million in 1990 to 173.2 million in 2003. Over the last 20 years, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nalone  has  accounted  for  over  75%  of  poverty  reduction  in  the  developing  world  (ADB.  2006.  Key  Indicators. \nAvailable: www.adb.org/statistics). \n\n2  From  1990  to  2005,  road  traffic\u2019s  share  of  passenger  traffic  grew  by  8.8%  per  annum,  reaching  929.2  billion \npassenger-kilometer (km), and of freight, by 6.4% per annum, reaching 869.3 billion ton-km. In 2005, road traffic \naccounted for 53.2% of the country\u2019s total passenger traffic and 11.0% of the total freight traffic. \n\n3   The  total  investment  during  the  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP)  reached  CNY1,900  billion,  more  than  double  that  in \n\nthe previous 5 years.  \n\n4   About 1.58 million km of rural roads in poor condition were not considered in the official statistics because they did \n\nnot meet certain Ministry of Communications (MOC) technological standards. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nhave no paved road access. Of the 1.56 million km of total rural roads, 80% are in class-IV and \nunclassified, and 60% have some level of gravel surfacing or are unpaved. Most rural roads lack \nbridges and drainage systems and are often closed during the rainy and winter seasons. As a \nresult, many rural poor in the west reside in either partial or full isolation. \n \n6. \nOver 90% of the poor in PRC live in rural areas. Improving rural roads has substantially \nreduced  poverty.  The  Government  has  accelerated  rural  road  construction  to  close  the \ndevelopment gap between urban and rural areas.5 During the Tenth Five-Year Plan (10th FYP, \n2001\u20132005), investment in rural roads totaled CNY418 billion, three times that in the previous \n5 years.  By  2010,  all  villages  will  have  road  access,  and  all  townships  will  have  paved  roads. \nPaved roads will link all eastern villages, 88% of central villages, and 50% of western villages. \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nProblems and Constraints \n\nDespite  rapid  economic  growth,  development \n\n \nin  different  provinces  has  been \n7. \nimbalanced. In 2005, the GDP per capita of the western provinces was less than half that of the \ncoastal provinces.6 The road network still does not provide adequate access to the poorer inland \nregion;  vast  distances  and  difficult  mountainous  terrain  isolate  it  from  local,  regional,  and \nnational  markets.  Most  exports  and  imports  reach  major  markets  through  other  provinces, \nmeaning that inter-provincial transport development is an important determinant of growth and \ndevelopment. \n \nGansu is on the upper reaches of the Yellow River in northwestern PRC.7 Remote and \n8. \nisolated  with  harsh  natural  conditions,  it  is  one  of  the  least  developed  provinces.  With  a  per \ncapita  GDP  of  CNY6,135  (45%  of  the  national  average),  Gansu  ranked  30th  among  the \n31 administrative areas. Annual per capita rural income was CNY1,980, or 61% of the national \naverage  of CNY3,255.  Of  the  population  of  26.0  million,  7.6  million  are  poor,  defined  as living \nbelow  the  Government  low-income  line  of  CNY852  per  capita  per  year  (which  is  below  the \ninternational poverty line of $1 per person per day). Rural poverty incidence in Gansu is 40%. \n \nInadequate  infrastructure  is  the  main  reason  for  Gansu\u2019s  high  poverty.  Gansu\u2019s  road \n9. \ndensity  is  9.1  km  per  100  km2,  significantly  lower  than  the  national  average  (20.0  km  per \n100 m2).  The  focal  prefecture  of  the  Project  (Longnan)  is  isolated,  suffers  from  poor \ninfrastructure, and has only road transport. No expressway, class-I road, airport, or railway links \nLongnan  to  the  outside  world.    It  takes  10\u201316  hours  to  reach  Lanzhou,  Xi\u2019an,  Chengdu,  and \nChongqing.  National  Highway  (NH)  212\u2014a  combination  of  class-II  (8  km),  class-III  (180  km), \nand class-IV roads (82 km)\u2014provides the only substantial link to Sichuan. Constructed in 1958, \nit  is  narrow  with  steep  slopes,  sharp  turns,  and  low  speed  with  certain  sections  impassible \nduring  the  rainy  and  winter  seasons.  Traffic  congestion  is  growing  and  will  exceed  the  road\u2019s \ncapacity  on  several  stretches  by  2012.  Residents  have  limited  mobility  beyond  their  localities \nbecause  of  higher  transport  costs.  Poor  access  to  transport  constraints  economic  and  social \ndevelopment and contributes to poverty. \n\n                                                 \n5   In 2005, the annual per capita net income of rural households was CNY3,255 ($402), while the annual per capita \ndisposable income of urban households was CNY10,493 ($1,306), three times more than that of rural households. \n6   The average per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in 12 western administrative areas was about 47% the east \n\n7   Gansu is landlocked, surrounded by Shaanxi in the east, Qinghai and Xinjiang in the west, Sichuan in the south, \n\nand Inner Mongolia and Mongolia in the north (Map 1). \n\nPRC. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nPoor roads have led to inadequate and costly transport services in the project area. In \n10. \nLongnan, 820 villages have no direct access to bus services as bus operators are unwilling to \nuse bad roads because of high costs and danger. Transport demand is usually met by various \ninformal  transport  services  such  as  motorized  tricycles  and  dual-purpose  pickups.  Formal  bus \nservices are of better quality, but suffer from low rates of vehicle utilization, resulting in relatively \nhigh unit costs. To sell their products, the rural poor often rely on traders who purchase farmers\u2019 \ngoods  directly  in  the  villages  but  at  prices  well  below  those  in  urban  markets.  The  technical \nassistance survey indicated that 75% of local farmers sell their livestock at farm-gate prices.8 \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment and Asian Development Bank Strategies \n\n \n11. \nThe Government development strategy has shifted to the western region and rural areas \nto promote balanced growth.9 In the road sector, it will do the following: (i) Construct the national \nexpressway network totaling 85,000 km to expand the national trunk highway system (NTHS) to \nlink  all  cities  with  over  200,000  people.  Much  of  this  new  construction  directly  supports  the \nWestern  Region  Development  Strategy  (a  key  theme  of  the  10th  and  11th  FYPs).  (ii) Improve \nrural  roads,  with  emphasis  on  rural  road  maintenance  and  rural  transport  service  to  ensure \nsustainability and efficiency. (iii) Promote regional cooperation. The Ministry of Communications \n(MOC) is investing in the road sector to (i) close network gaps in the western region, (ii) divert \ncentral  budget  (e.g.,  vehicle  purchase  tax)  to  the  rural  transport  system,  and  (iii)  formulate  a \nrural road development framework to attract all sources of funding for rural road improvement. \n \n12. \nADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  in  the  PRC\u2019s  road  sector  gives  high  priority  to  removing \ninfrastructure  constraints  and  supporting  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  ADB  supports \n(i) building roads that connect major growth centers, and improving access in the western and \ncentral regions; (ii) integrating the network so that the NTHS is supported by a system of local \nroads,  particularly  those  that  provide  access  to  poor  areas;  (iii)  promoting  road  safety  and \nreducing  vehicle  emissions;  (iv)  strengthening  the  corporatization  and  commercialization  of \nexpressway  organizations;  (v)  adopting  appropriate  pricing  policies  to  ensure  optimum  use  of \nroad  transport  capacity;  and  (vi)  using  alternative  methods  of  investment  financing,  including \nprivate sector participation. ADB road sector assistance targets the poor western provinces. The \nProject is consistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities and ADB\u2019s strategy. \n \n\n3. \n\nOpportunities \n\n \n13. \nThe  expressway  from  Liangshui  town  in  Wudu  (capital  of  Longnan  [Map 2])  to \nGuangzigou (border with Sichuan) is an important section of the Lanzhou\u2013Haikou national high-\npriority  western  corridor  (2,570  km).  The  project  expressway  will  eventually  connect  Gansu  to \nthe southern seaports of Beihai and Fangcheng in Guangxi, and Haikou in Hainan province, by \ntraversing  the  poor  interior  provinces  of  Gansu,  Sichuan,  Guizhou,  and  Guangxi,  and \nChongqing  municipality.  The  Project  will  promote  inter-provincial  trade  integration  and \ncooperation,  provide  better  business  opportunities,  and  stimulate  economic  growth  within  the \nproject area, and between rural and large urban areas, thereby reducing regional disparities. \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Western Roads Development \n\nProject. Manila. \n\n9   Sustained, rapid growth is a priority in the Government\u2019s 11th FYP (which, unlike the 10th FYP, is a \u201cprogram\u201d rather \nthan a \u201cplan\u201d as it avoids specific targets). Also important is creating a more harmonious society, reducing income \ninequalities,  strengthening  human  resources,  protecting  the  environment,  and  cushioning  the  social  impacts  of \ndevelopment.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ninto  cash  crops, \n\ntourism,  and  establishment  of \n\nSeveral studies and much evidence confirm that transport development reduces poverty \n14. \nand  affirm  the  relevance  of  ADB\u2019s  strategy.10 The  Project  will  upgrade  rural  roads  and  build \ntownship bus stations to connect poor rural areas to main artery roads. The integrated approach \nwill largely remove the barriers to accessibility and foster growth. \n \n15. \nThe  project  area  is  predominantly  agricultural.  Food  crops  include  wheat,  maize, \npotatoes,  and  buckwheat.  The  area  has  more  rain  than  the  rest  of  Gansu,  and  the  mild  and \nslightly humid weather is good for certain cash crops, including Sichuan pepper, olive oil, fruits, \nwalnuts, and medicinal herbs. Longnan possesses minerals (such as lead and zinc) and forests, \nand has the potential for ecological tourism. The main strategy for poverty reduction is economic \ndiversification \nincluding \nagroprocessing  and  mineral  production.  Improved  road  transport  will  increase  the  production \nand export of mineral products, reduce the transport cost for cash crops, and promote tourism. \n \n16. \nExternal assistance to the road sector has come mainly from ADB, the Japan Bank for \nInternational  Cooperation,  and  the  World  Bank.  Since  1991,  ADB  has  extended  33  loans \ntotaling $6.6 billion to finance 4,455 km of expressways and 8,964 km of associated local road \nnetworks. Of the ADB-funded projects, 18 have already been completed and are open to traffic. \nADB  has  also  supplied  60  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects  totaling  $32  million  to  the  road \nsector.  The  advisory  TA  projects  have  addressed  policy  and  institutional  issues,  including \nhighway  planning,  road  safety,  human  resource  development,  socioeconomic  assessment, \ntransport pricing, and mobilization of nongovernment financial resources. The World Bank and \nJBIC have provided about $7.1 billion and \u00a5219 billion, respectively, to finance road investments. \nADB coordinates with both these organizations to ensure that each major development partner \nfocuses  on  different  corridors,  and  information  related  to  policy  advice  is  shared  across  the \ndevelopment community (Appendix 3). \n \n\nindustries, \n\n4. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \n17. \nThe assessment of ADB\u2019s operation portfolio in the PRC road sector highlighted a high \nlevel  of  performance,  both  in  efficacy  and  effectiveness.11 Project  completion  reports  prepared \nfor  18  road  projects  concluded  that  17  were  highly  or  generally  successful  and  1  partly \nsuccessful  (Appendix  3).  The  Gansu  Provincial  Communications  Department  (GPCD)  has \nimplemented  three  externally  financed  road  projects  well  and  without  major  problems.12 While \nthe overall performance of highway projects is by and large satisfactory, a number of the most \nrecent  issues  have  been  identified  for  consideration  in  the  project  design,  including \n(i) insufficient geological investigation, leading to problems with tunnel construction; (ii) deficient \nresettlement  planning  and  implementation; 13 and  (iii)  insufficient  reporting  on  project  benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation. \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB.  2000.

Report  and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China \nfor the Gansu Road Development Project. Manila (construction started in 2005). \n\n13  Some  problems  during  resettlement  were  not  resolved  on  time,  so  resettlement  monitoring,  reporting,  and \n\nsupervision must be strengthened to identify and quickly resolve issues. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nTo  reduce  the  engineering  risks,  complementary  geological  and  soil  investigations  are \n18. \nbeing  undertaken  during  the  design  stage.  A  tunnel  specialist  was  engaged  during  project \npreparation  and  confirmed  that  the  design  of  tunnels  generally  conforms  to  MOC  standards. \nSpecific  measures  will  be  undertaken  to  mitigate  the  risks  (para.  65).  The  Project  will  train \ndomestic  tunnel  experts.  As  for  resettlement,  (i) ADB  explained  its  safeguard  requirements  to \nthe  agencies  early  in  project  preparation,  (ii)  GPCD  established  the  project  resettlement \norganizations  during  the  feasibility  study  stage  to  carry  out  comprehensive  field  surveys  to \nprepare the resettlement plan, (iii) consultations with affected villagers started at the beginning \nof  project  preparation  to  reflect  their  concerns,  and  (iv)  an  external  monitoring  agency  will \nmonitor  resettlement.  To  make  benefit  monitoring  more  effective  and  efficient,  dialogues  were \nheld  with  a  few  key  representative  communities  in  the  project  area,  baseline  indicators  were \nestablished, and monitoring indicators and measures were agreed with GPCD (para. 48). \n \n\n5. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n \n19. \nPolicy  Reform  in  Road  Transport.  Efficient  transport  services  are  as  important  as \nimproving  infrastructure  to  ensure  that  project  benefits  are  passed  on  to  road  users  at  reduced \ncost. Gansu was selected as a case study in the recently completed ADB TA on policy reform in \nroad transport.14 The TA reviewed issues in road freight and passenger transport and prepared a \nroad transport action plan, recommending policy and regulatory measures to improve efficiency, \nsuch as easing bus fare control and bus route selection. As part of the Project, GPCD agreed to \npilot-test  some  of  the  recommendations  in  Longnan.  Experience  from  the  pilot  test  will  be \nreplicated in other areas to enhance the impact of the physical infrastructure improvement under \nthe Project (Appendix 4). \n \n20. \nPromoting  Corporate  Governance.  Gansu  Changda  Highway  Company  Limited \n(GCHC)  was  established  on  16  February  2001  to  construct  and  operate  the  first  World  Bank-\nfinanced  highway.  The  registered  capital  of  GCHC  was  CNY500  million.  It  has  been  an \nimplementing  agency  for  three  internationally  financed  road  projects,  including  the  ongoing \nproject  financed  by  ADB.  It  will  also  be  the  implementing  agency  for  the  project  expressway. \nGCHC  has  the  corporate  governance  structure  required  by  the  Company  Law  and  follows \ncorporate governance practices acceptable to international financial institutes. To help achieve \nsound  corporate  governance  standards,  GPCD  and  GCHC  will  enter  into  a  concession \nframework agreement by 30 September 2007 before project construction starts (Supplementary \nAppendix  A). 15  The  agreement  will  ensure  autonomy  of  operations,  encourage \nthe \nestablishment  of  performance  indicators,  and  facilitate  contracting  out  of  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M). GCHC  will prepare a corporate development plan by 31 December 2008 \nto  assure  a  high  standard  of  corporate  governance,  management,  financial  reporting,  and \nhuman  resource  development.  The  Project  will  train  GCHC  staff  members  to  promote  and \nstrengthen corporate governance. \n \n21. \nFacilitating Private  Sector  Participation. The private sector has been involved in the \nroad  sector  through  cooperative  joint  ventures,  securitization  through  initial  public  offerings, \nrevenue bond financing,16 and build-operate-transfer projects. In Gansu, its participation in road \ndevelopment,  financing,  and  management  remains  embryonic,  mainly  because  low  traffic \nvolumes  and  potential  toll  revenues  are  not  financially  attractive.  However,  GPCD  is \nencouraging private sector participation in the road sector, and some potential private investors \n\n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2004.

Manila.  \n15 The agreement to be signed will include ADB\u2019s Gansu Roads Development Project and this Project.  \n16 Involving the sale of rated notes to institutional investors, accompanied by a pledge of an entity\u2019s cash-flow sources, \n\nwhich could include toll road net revenues. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nhave  shown  interest. 17  Private  sector  financing  options,  including  contracting  out  project \nexpressway O&M, will be examined before project operations. \n \n22. \nPromoting Road Safety. Road safety is a serious issue in the PRC; the fatality rate was \n45 per 10,000 vehicles in 2004. The Road Traffic Safety Law took effect in May 2004. An inter-\nministerial  committee  coordinated  by  MOC,  involving  15  ministries,  was  established  in \nMay 2004  to  develop  and  implement  special  measures  to  enforce  regulations  on  overloaded \ntrucks. The fatality rate gradually improved to 31 per 10,000 vehicles in 2005, which is still very \nhigh  by  international  standards.  The  Project  will  (i)  establish  an  inter-agency  road  safety \ncommittee in Gansu to facilitate project implementation; (ii) ensure, in collaboration with Gansu \nPublic  Security  Bureau,  a  team  of  bureau  personnel  will  patrol  the  project  roads;  (iii) adopt \nspecific  safety  facilities,  such  as  emergency  stop  lanes,  reinforced  pavement  in  tunnels,  and \nreinforced  traffic  signaling;  (iv)  conduct  independent  road  safety  audits  during  design, \nconstruction  and  before  start  of  operation;  (v) install  axle-weighing  stations  at  expressway \nentrances; (vi) establish a traffic surveillance center to monitor operations; and (vii) raise public \nawareness and disseminate road safety knowledge by linking the GPCD website with the ADB \nroad  safety  website.  As  part  of  the  Project,  a  risk  management  plan  will  be  prepared \n(Appendix 5). \n \n23. \nControlling  Vehicle  Emissions. With vehicles rapidly increasing, the Government has \ntaken measures to control vehicle emissions, including regulating the automobile industry, and \nrequiring an annual vehicle test, inspection, and maintenance program. The new measures set \nemission and fuel-efficiency targets, and offer tax incentives to manufacturers for production of \nmore environmentally friendly cars. GPCD will (i) encourage gas stations along the expressway \nto provide clean fuels such as compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas and reformulated \ngasoline  in  addition  to  normal  gasolines,  (ii)  engage  a  qualified  environmental  monitoring \ninstitute  to  monitor  ambient  air  quality  along  the  expressway,  and  (iii)  conduct  a  capacity-\nbuilding  and  training  program.  Because  of  faster  and  shorter  travel,  when  the  project \nexpressway opens in 2012, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxide emissions from \nvehicles are estimated to be at least 20% lower than without the Project (Appendix 5). \n \n \n \n24. \nConstraints and Opportunities. Rural poverty incidence in Longnan is 42%. Roads are \nthe only transport mode in Longnan. Roads and transport services are underdeveloped, which \nis a major cause of poverty. This transport bottleneck needs to be removed to facilitate moving \ngoods and people between rural and urban areas and between Gansu and Sichuan and beyond. \nThe  Project,  a  priority  investment  in  the  11th  FYP,  will  integrate  the  region  with  the  centers  of \neconomic growth (Lanzhou, Xi\u2019an, Chongqing, and Chengdu).18 \n \nProject  Alternatives  Considered. The option of constructing a road of lower technical \n25. \nclass instead of the project expressway was considered but rejected for the following reasons: \n(i) The only road classes with the capacity to carry traffic up to 2020 are four-lane expressways \nor four-lane class-I roads; after 2020, an expressway standard would be required. (ii) The major \ndifference  between  the  expressway  and  class-I  according  to  MOC  design  standard  is  that  \nclass-I  may  be  only  partly  access-controlled  whereas  expressway  class  must  be  fully  access-\n\nRationale \n\n6. \n\n                                                 \n17  GPCD  has  offered,  for  construction  either  as  joint  ventures  or  build-operate-transfer  projects,  three  planned \n\nexpressways as well as eight existing expressways for operation (toll right transfer). \n\n18 In  Sichuan,  the  project  expressway  will  connect  the  planned  expressway  from  Guanzigou  to  Guanguan  (56  km, \ntarget  completion:  2012).  In  Gansu,  it  will  connect  to  the  Minxian\u2013Wudu  (159  km)  and  Lintao\u2013Minxian  (156  km) \nsections  (target  completion:  2015).  The  Lintao\u2013Lanzhou  section  has  opened  to  traffic.  Upon  completion  of  the \nProject, it will connect people along the expressway to Lanzhou through class-II and above highways in Gansu. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\ncontrolled. Thus, the construction costs for the two options differ only in the number and types of \naccess control by overpass or grade separation, which accounts for only 2.5% of the total cost. \n(iii) Reducing  access  control  and  grade  separation  reduces  capacity  and  safety.  Three \nalternative  alignments  were  also  studied  and  compared  from  technical,  economic,  social, \nenvironmental, and resettlement aspects. The proposed alignment has obvious advantages and \nwas therefore selected. Further, rural roads and township bus stations were selected carefully \nfrom the 11th FYP. \n \nValue  Added  by  ADB.  In  addition  to  financing,  ADB  involvement  would  (i) strengthen \n26. \nGPCD and GCHC in institutional arrangement, human resource development, sound corporate \ngovernance,  road  maintenance,  and  management  of  sector  externalities  (safety,  environment, \nand social dimensions); (ii) integrate rural roads that connect the national high-priority corridor \nand  rural  poor  areas,  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  \u201cnew  countryside  development\u201d  initiative; \n(iii) enhance social assessment of road transport design and implementation; and (iv) accelerate \npolicy reforms to improve road transport services. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Project  will  promote  sustainable  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty  in  southern \n27. \nGansu.  It  will  develop  an  efficient,  safe,  and  reliable  road  transport  system.  The  proposed \nexpressway with the total length of 134 km will reduce the trip length from Wudu to Guanzigou \nby 136 km, and resulting of time savings of at least 5 to 7 hours. It will also improve rural access \nto markets, income-earning opportunities, education and health services, and social activities. \n \nB. \n \nThe Project will (i) build a 134-km four-lane access-controlled toll expressway between \n28. \nWudu  and  Guanzigou,  and  its  tunnels  (including  one  that  is  8  km),  bridges,  interchanges  with \ntoll stations, connector roads, administrative stations, and service areas; (ii) upgrade 357 km of \nrural  roads  to  improve  access  to  27  townships  and  275  villages  in  poor  areas;  (iii)  build \n200 township bus stations to provide new bus services; (iv) improve transport services by pilot-\ntesting  a  road  transport  action  plan  in  Longnan;  (v)  promote  corporate  governance;  and \n(vi) strengthen  local  transport  authorities  in  construction  supervision,  road  safety,  asset \nmanagement, and project management by providing consulting services and training. \n \nC. \n \n29. \nEnhancing  Accessibility  to  Low-Income  Areas. Lack of roads feeding into the main \nroad  networks  has  been  identified  as  a  serious  constraint  on  economic  development  and \npoverty reduction in the project area. The Project includes a rural road improvement program, \ncomprising  seven  road  sections  totaling  357  km,  linking  27  townships  and  275  villages.  Rural \nroads  were  selected  on  the  basis  of  road  network  efficiency,  economic  potential,  and  the \nsurrounding  poverty  incidence  and  population  density.  These  roads  will  connect  to  the \nexpressway  through  the  road  network  system.  About  763,000  rural  people,  of  whom  52%  are \npoor, will directly benefit. \n \nThe  rural  roads  will  (i)  be  upgraded  to  classes-III\u2013IV;  (ii)  use  the  MOC  technical \n30. \nstandards  and  follow  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  that  are  acceptable  to  ADB; \n(iii) follow  ADB\u2019s  social  safeguard  policies;  and  (iv)  be  monitored  and  evaluated  to  ensure \nproper  design,  supervision,  and  impact  monitoring.  Planning,  improvement,  and  maintenance \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nwill be highly consultative. Of the ADB loan, $15 million will finance the upgrading of the Wudu\u2013\nLixian section from unclassified or earth track to class-III or class-IV. The upgrading will include \nimproved  road  subgrade,  sealed  pavement  and  improved  drainage,  rehabilitation  of  bridges, \nculverts,  and  traffic  safety  facilities.  The  improved  road  will  reduce  the  distance  from  Wudu  to \nLixian by 23 km (from 164 km to 141 km), not only providing the shortest route for traffic from \nTianshui, the second largest city in Gansu, to Wudu and beyond, but also improving transport \nservices and stimulating other socioeconomic activities (Appendix 6). \n \nImproving  Rural  Transport  Service.  Rural  transport  services  are  underdeveloped  in \n31. \nGansu. In Longnan, 129 townships do not have any bus stations. Currently, passengers board \nbuses on roadsides or at temporary stops which is highly unsafe. The bus service is informal, \ncharges are irregular and sometimes exorbitant, and the frequency is uncertain. The Project will \nbuild  200  township  bus  stations:  100  in  Longnan,  50  in  Tianshui,  and  50  in  Dingxi.  The  total \ninvestment is estimated at $10 million, of which $5 million will be funded from the ADB loan. The \nimproved bus stations and rural roads will provide a more reliable, safe, convenient and regular \nbus service to the local residents. New and improved rural transport services will help the rural \npeople raise their income (Appendix 4). \n \n32. \nSustaining  Rural  Road  Maintenance. Building on new national policy for funding and \nmanaging rural road maintenance announced by the State Council in October 2005, GPCD has \nprepared a provincial regulation and submitted it to the Gansu provincial government (GPG) for \napproval.  Under  the  Project,  a  rural  road  maintenance  plan  was  prepared  and  agreed  with \nGPCD to strengthen the sustainability of the rural network in the project area by (i) developing a \nfunctional core rural road network as a base for establishing a road maintenance management \nsystem and assigning priorities and budgets; (ii) compiling road inventories and basic-condition \ndata,  and  assigning  a  sub-network  manager  for  each  road;  (iii)  enhancing  rural  road  safety \nfacilities  in  the  mountainous  region;  (iv)  preparing  a  rural  road  maintenance  manual  by  the \ninternational  consultant  and  providing  on-the-job  training  to  sub-network  managers,  small \nmaintenance  companies,  and  communities;  (v) conducting  a  200  person-months  training \nprogram for sub-network managers during project implementation; (vi) improving the efficiency \nof  use  of  existing  funds;  and  (vii)  promoting  preventive  maintenance,  including  control  of \noverloading vehicles and timely maintenance during the rainy and winter seasons (Appendix 7). \n \n33. \nTendering  for  Road  Maintenance.  The  Project  will  improve  road  maintenance \noperations  by  conducting  competitive  bidding  for  road  maintenance  with  private  sector \nparticipation. Maintenance works were previously done by GPCD through force account. For the \nsake  of  efficiency,  the  Project  will  develop  standard  bidding  documents  for  procurement  of \nperformance-based  road  maintenance  contracts  with  the  help  of  international  consultants. \nPrivate  sector  participation  in  bidding  for  road  maintenance  will  enhance  competition  and \nimprove quality (Appendix 7). \n \nAdopting  an  Intelligent  Transport  System.  An  intelligent  transport  system  (ITS)19 on \n34. \nexpressways is being introduced in accordance with the national ITS architecture prepared by \nthe  National  ITS  Center.  ITS  objectives  in  Gansu  during  the  11th  FYP  are  to  (i)  introduce  a \nnetwork-wide  expressway  tolling  system;  (ii)  reduce  toll  payment  delay;  (iii)  improve  safety \nthrough  better  monitoring;  (iv) improve  traveler  information;  (v)  assist  in  emergencies;  and \n(vi) improve traffic enforcement, infrastructure maintenance, and computerized management of \nserious incidents. ITS equipment and training will be provided under the Project with the help of \nconsulting  services,  including  (i)  integrated  traffic  control  centers;  (ii) advanced  toll  payment; \n\n                                                 \n19  The  application  of  information  technology  to  transport  is  referred  to  as  ITS,  which  provides  the  ability  to  gather, \n\norganize, analyze, use, and share information about transport systems and their efficient use. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\n(iii) variable  message  displays;  (iv)  use  of  surveillance  technology;  (v) detection  of  blackspot \nlocations  and  weather  conditions;  and  (vi) monitoring  of  speed  limit,  overloaded  vehicles,  toll \npayment,  and  road  safety.  The  ITS  will  produce  key  monitoring  reports,  such  as  traffic \ncomposition and number of road accidents (Supplementary Appendix B). \n \n35. \nDeveloping  Asset  Management. Proper asset management is fundamental to ensure \nroad sustainability. During the project implementation, GPCD will prepare an asset management \ndevelopment plan, which will establish a computerized database system and promote the use of \nmodern  equipment,  and  provide  a  training  program  for  provincial,  county,  and  township \nemployees.  GPCD  will  assign  the  Gansu  Communications  Technical  Vocational  College  to \ndevelop  a  training  program  to  improve  road  asset  management  skills  with  the  help  of \ninternational  consultants.  Equipment  for  the  computerized  system  is  included  in  the  project \nscope and will be financed by the Project (Supplementary Appendix B). \n \nD. \n \n36. \ncontingencies, interest, and other charges during construction (Appendix 8). \n\nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $1,660  million  equivalent,  including \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmountsa \n\n \n\n1.

The Borrower of the loan will be the PRC. The loan will \nhave  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft Loan and Project Agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for \nits decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nThe  ADB  loan  will  finance  18%  of  the  total  project  cost.

MOC and GPG have made budgetary provisions for the counterpart funds. The ADB \nloan proceeds will be made available to GPG, which will, through GPCD, onlend the proceeds \nof the loan to GCHC under an onlending agreement on the same financial terms and conditions \nas those of the ADB loan, with the GCHC bearing the exchange rate and interest rate variation \nrisks and performing the obligations applicable to it in the Project Agreement which are made an \nintegral part of the onlending agreement. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nBank of Communications \nMinistry of Communications \nGansu Provincial Government \n \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n300.00 \n712.60 \n332.00 \n315.40 \n1,660.00 \n\n% \n18 \n43 \n20 \n19 \n100 \n\n \n \nF. \n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n39. \nGPCD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  responsible  for  the  overall  implementation  of \nthe Project. GCHC, the Implementing Agency responsible for the ongoing ADB-financed Gansu \nRoads  Development  Project, 20  will  also  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  the  proposed \nexpressway under the Project. GCHC\u2019s general manager, acting as the project director, will be \nresponsible  for  construction  and  operation  of  the  expressway.  GPCD  will  implement  the  rural \nroad component through the Gansu Provincial Highway Administration Bureau and the transport \nservice  component  through  the  Gansu  Provincial  Transport  Administration  Bureau.  A  project \nimplementation  unit  established  within  GCHC  will  monitor  and  follow  up  implementation; \nfacilitate  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  environmental  protection;  and  ensure  that  local \nconcerns  are  addressed  adequately.  The  unit  will  be  headed  by  a  project  manager,  who  will \noversee  day-to-day  physical  implementation.  Organization  charts  for  GPCD  and  GCHC  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years, from January 2007 to December 2011.

A  procurement  plan  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix D. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nThe  Project  will  finance  56  person-months  of  international  consulting  services:  40  for \n42. \nsupervision of the civil works, 6 each for bridge construction and tunnel construction, and 2 each \nfor road safety and road maintenance. GPCD will engage and finance 7,600 person-months of \nnational  consultants,  350  of  which  will  be  allocated  for  rural  roads  and  transport  services, \n320 for  environmental  protection,  and  30  to  monitor  the  socioeconomic  and  poverty  impacts. \nThe international consultants will be financed by the ADB loan and selected and engaged based \non  a  full  technical  proposal  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  in  accordance \nwith  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.22 The  national  consultants  will  be  financed \nfrom  domestic  resources  and  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  Government  procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB.  GCHC  will  establish  two  resident  supervision  engineer  offices.  The  chief \nsupervision  engineer\u2019s  office  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project  supervision.  The  chief \nsupervision engineer will be assisted by two deputies, one of whom will be the team leader of \nthe  international  consultants.  The  team  leader  will  help  the  chief  supervision  engineer  with \nproject  and  contract  management  activities  during  project  implementation.  Outline  terms  of \nreferences for consultants are in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n \n \n43. \nOn  24  May  2006,  ADB  approved  advance  procurement  for  civil  works  and  retroactive \nfinancing for eligible expenditures related to civil works up to $30 million incurred before the loan \neffectivity date, but not earlier than 12 months before the date of loan agreement signing. The \nadvance  action  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  The \nGovernment  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  the  advance  action  and  retroactive  financing \ndoes not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nto \n\nfor \n\nthe  payments  will  be  made \n\nreimburse  eligible  expenditures \n\n \nThe  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.23 \n44. \nlarge  contracts,  direct  payments, \nBecause  most  of \nreimbursements,  and  commitment  procedures  will  be  used  to  withdraw  loan  funds.

GPCD and GCHC will submit to ADB within 6 months of the \nend  of  each  related  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial \nstatements and an auditor\u2019s report on the Project, all in English. A separate audit opinion on the \nuse  of  the  statement  of  expenditures,  if  any,  will  be  included  as  part  of  the  auditor\u2019s  report. \nDuring the project implementation, GPCD and GCHC will submit quarterly progress reports. To \nfacilitate  project  post-evaluation,  GPCD  and  GCHC  will  furnish  ADB  with  a  completion  report \nwithin 3 months of the end of the Project. \n \n \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy 24 was explained to and discussed with the local and central \n46. \ngovernments.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine the records and accounts of GPCD, GCHC, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n47. \nGPCD  will  (i)  establish  a  supervisory  body  to  prevent  undue  interference  in  business \npractices and to ensure that adequate resources are made available for its effective operation; \n(ii) involve a leading group of officials from the Supervision Division of GPCD, located in GCHC, \ninvolved in bidding, construction, and other operational activities; (iii) hold regular briefings with \nGPCD,  GCHC,  and  the  prosecutor\u2019s  office  to  share  information  on  or  warnings  about  corrupt \npractices;  (iv)  periodically  inspect  contractors\u2019  fund  withdrawals  and  settlement  activities;  and \n(v) adopt a two-contract system whereby the winner of a civil works contract must also sign an \nanticorruption contract with the employer. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nTo  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  its  operations  and  to  be  accountable  for  its \n48. \nperformance to stakeholders, ADB uses the project performance management system (PPMS). \nThe monitoring will use a combined macro and micro approach, the latter focusing on a few key \nrepresentative  communities.  A  basic  monitoring  framework  was  constructed  for  the  Project  to \npermit a more definitive assessment of the actual benefits. GPCD and GCHC have agreed with \nthe  (i)  monitoring  framework,  (ii)  set  of  indicators  to  be  used  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the \nproject\u2019s  impacts,  and  (iii)  representative  villages.  Indicators  were  selected  based  on  the \nfindings  of  the  ADB-financed  TA  for  the  socioeconomic  assessment  of  road  projects 25 and \nproject preparatory TA findings. The baseline values for the indicators were established, where \navailable,  during  project  preparation,  and  will  be  updated  prior  to  and  during  project \nimplementation,  at  project  completion,  and  annually  for  3  years  thereafter.  By  30  September \n2007, GPCD will recruit an independent local institute to provide 30 person-months for surveys, \n\n                                                 \n24  ADB. 1998.

Gansu  has  coordinated  with  Sichuan  and  reached  an \nagreement to implement the Guanzigou\u2013Guangyuan expressway as it is planned in conjunction \nwith the project expressway construction. The traffic volume on the expressway is expected to \ngrow from an average of 5,500 passenger car units (pcu) in 2012 to an average of 11,200 pcu in \n2022, a 7.4% average annual growth rate. It will grow at 7.2% per annum thereafter to reach an \naverage of 22,500 pcu in 2032 (Appendix 12). \n \nB. \n \n51. \nThe  project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  estimated  by  comparing \nscenarios  with  and  without  the  Project.  Without  the  Project,  traffic  volume  would  exceed \ncapacity  of  the  existing  NH212,  congestion  would  worsen,  causing  delay,  thereby  increasing \ntravel  time,  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs),  and  accidents.  With  the  Project,  travel  time  and \nVOCs  would  be  reduced  because  of  higher  speeds  and  shorter  distances;  the  accident  rate \nwould be reduced by eliminating congestion, providing safety features, and separating fast and \nslow  traffic.  Similar  benefits  will  also  accrue  to  the  traffic  on  the  existing  roads.  The  project\u2019s \neconomic costs reflect (i) the capital cost for construction, which include physical contingencies, \nland  acquisition,  and  resettlement;  (ii)  O&M  costs,  which  include  replacing  depreciated \nequipment;  and  (iii)  environmental  monitoring  costs.  The  economic  benefits  are  (i)  savings  in \nVOCs  as  a  result  of  reduced  road  length  and  improved  traffic  and  road  conditions,  (ii)  time \nsavings  for  road  users,  (iii)  savings  in  road  accident  costs  as  a  result  of  fewer  accidents,  and \n(iv) benefits from generated traffic.  \n \nThe Project is economically viable. The EIRR for the whole Project is estimated at 17.9%. \n52. \nThe  EIRR  was  17.5%  for  the  expressway  and  23.0%  for  the  local  road  network.  Sensitivity \nanalysis confirms the robustness of the project\u2019s economic viability. To determine the degree of \nuncertainty for the Project, a risk analysis was conducted. The results of the risk analysis show \nthat the probability of the EIRR to be below 12% is 6.1% (Appendix 13). \n \nC. \n \nIn accordance with the Highway Law and Regulations on Toll Road Management in PRC, \n53. \ntoll rates will be set based on various factors such as technical standard of highway, project cost, \nlocal  price  index,  duration  to  pay  the  loans,  traffic  volume  and  affordability.  The  proposed  toll \n\nFinancial Analysis and Projections \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\nrates26 for the project expressway are considered reasonable to attract sufficient traffic to meet \nthe  criteria  for  EIRR  and  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR).  GCHC  will  undertake  a  toll \nanalysis  before  opening  the  expressway,  and  each  year  for  5  years  thereafter,  to  confirm  the \nappropriate  level  of  toll,  and  it  will  submit  the  results  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and  comments.  If  an \nadjustment of the toll levels is required based on this principle, GCHC will obtain ADB\u2019s review \nand comments before finalizing and submitting it to GPG for approval. \n \n54. \nFinancial  projections  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the \nFinancial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  to  assess  the  financial  viability  and \nsustainability of the Project. The projected financial statements indicate that financial revenues \nwill  be  sufficient  to  cover  O&M  costs  and  debt  service  from  the  six  year  of  operation.  The \nproject\u2019s cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to real terms \nby adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuations. \nThe expressway FIRR is estimated at about 4.6% after taxes\u2014better than the weighted average \ncost of capital of 3.4%, also net of taxes. The expressway is considered to be financially viable \nand sustainable. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the FIRR is robust under adverse conditions \n(Appendix 14).  Financial  management  assessment  found  that  the  Project  meets  the  minimum \nfinancial  management  requirements  and  can  provide  accurate  and  timely  information  on  its \nstatus in the reporting format agreed with ADB (Supplementary Appendix F). \n \nD. \n \n55. \nSocioeconomic Profile. The Project will benefit 2.7 million people in Longnan, of whom \n2.4 million live in rural areas and 996,700 of these live on less than $1 per person per day.27 In \naddition,  50  township  bus  stations  in  each  of  Dingxi  and  Tianshui  prefectures  will  benefit  a \nfurther 1.9 million people. Of the more than 4.6 million project beneficiaries, 1.7 million are poor. \nThe GDP per capita is CNY2,346 in Longnan, CNY3,619 in Tianshui, and CNY2,126 in Dingxi. \nSeven  out  of  nine  counties  in  Longnan,  six  out  of  seven  counties  in  Tianshui,  and  all  seven \ncounties in Dingxi are nationally designated poverty counties. The incidence of rural poverty is \n42%  in  Longnan,  29%  in  Tianshui,  and  39%  in  Dingxi.  There  are  3,237  villages  in  Longnan, \n75%  of  which  are  nationally  designated  poverty  villages.  Once  linked  to  the  major  road \nnetworks, the improved rural transport system will spread the expressway\u2019s benefits to the local \neconomy and rural communities (Appendix 15). \n \n56. \nStakeholder Consultations. Over 5,000 people were interviewed during public opinion \nsurveys,  social  and  environmental  assessment,  resettlement  planning,  and  social  surveys \n(Supplementary  Appendix  G).  Discussions  have  shown  that  support  for  the  Project  is  strong \nbecause  the  area  is  isolated.  The  primary  needs  of  the  local  people  included  jobs  and  better \ninfrastructure. The Project will (i) ensure adequate and timely compensation for land acquisition; \n(ii) hire villagers for construction and source local materials during the Project; (iii) develop small \nbusiness and tourism; (iv) enhance access to markets, jobs, schools and health care facilities; \nand (v) provide overpasses, underpasses, culverts, and interchanges to expressway facilities.28 \n \n57. \nSocial Benefits. The Project will create 56,000 person-years of job opportunities during \nthe construction and 1,700 full-time jobs during the operation. Over 60% of the jobs will be filled \nup  by  the  poor  with  an  estimated  total  of  CNY200  million  in  wage  payment  annually  during \nconstruction,  and  another  CNY15  million  in  wage  payment  annually  after  start  of  project \n\n                                                 \n26  The proposed toll rates are CNY0.35\u2013CNY2 per vehicle-km. Under the current Gansu provincial \u201cgreen passage\u201d \nregulations, local vehicles carrying fresh agricultural produce or livestock are exempt from tolls (Appendix 14).   \n27  In Longnan, 321,000 absolutely poor people live below CNY625 per capita per year and 676,000 poor people live \n\nbelow CNY825 per capita per year (996,700 live below the international poverty line of $1 per year per day). \n\n28  The Project will provide seven interchanges, including two interchanges in Wudu, with a minimum spacing of 5 km. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\noperation.  Local  procurement  of  the  materials  required  for  the  Project  is  estimated  value  of \nCNY200 million, of which 60% is value added in labor. In addition, the construction tax revenue \nto  be  collected  by  local  governments  is  estimated  at  CNY248  million.  This  additional  revenue \nwill  be  used  for  poverty  reduction  and  social  activities,  with  special  attention  to  resettlement \naffected groups, women, and other vulnerable people. The improved road transport system will \nenhance  the  local  investment  climate  to  attract  more  investment  to  the  region  and  act  as  a \ncatalyst for future investment. \n \nCapacity  Building  for  Rural  Communities.  A  reluctance  among  many  residents  to \n58. \naccept  new  ideas,  low  willingness  to  learn  new  skills,  and  lack  of  confidence  are  among  key \nconstraints to reducing poverty. The Project will (i) disseminate information widely to the general \npublic  via  the  mass  media;  (ii)  motivate  community  interest,  support,  and  participation; \n(iii) improve information flows regarding markets, jobs, government policies and initiatives, and \naid programs; and (iv) develop and train local small contractors. Local skills are expected to be \ngreatly enhanced as a result of several years of employment in project-related activities.  \n \nControl  and  Mitigation  of  Epidemic  Diseases.  Improved  transport  and  greater \n59. \npopulation  mobility  might  put  the  residents  at  risk  of  acquiring  sexually  transmitted  infections, \nincluding  HIV/AIDS.  No  HIV/AIDS  cases  have  been  reported  in  the  project  area.  The  Gansu \nCenter  for  Disease  Control  implements  preventive  measures  and  adopts  tight  health  and \nhygiene standards. Such measures include providing education programs; distributing condoms \nto  local  residents;  monitoring  any  outbreaks  and  spread  of  disease;  regularly  inspecting \nconstruction  sites;  using  advocacy  and  awareness  programs;  and  providing  voluntary \ncounseling, testing kits, and education. In carrying out the civil work contracts, the Law on the \nPrevention and Treatment of Epidemic Diseases will be followed (Appendix 16).29   \n \n60. \nEthnic Minorities and Gender Development. Ethnic minorities, predominantly Tibetan \nand  Hui  Muslims,  account  for  2%  of  the  population  in  Longnan.  They  will  not  be  negatively \naffected by the Project. They do not live along the expressway or rural road alignments, so they \nwill  not  be  affected  by  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  However,  special  measures  will  be \ntaken to include them as project beneficiaries (Appendix 16). The Project will also give women \ngreater  access  to  markets,  information,  jobs,  education  and  health  services.  It  will  help  them \ndiversify into cash crops and agroprocessing. The Project will ensure equal job opportunities for \nwomen and ethnic minorities during project construction and operation. \n \n61. \nSmall  Business  Development. The project area has potential for small businesses to \ngrow rapidly, but they have been constrained by an inefficient transport system. The Project will \ntake  initiatives  to  stimulate  (i)  export-oriented  cash  crops  and  agro-industry;  (ii) community-\nbased  tourism  and  eco-tourism;  and  (iii) services  (restaurants,  kiosk,  and  car  repair  shops)  at \ninterchanges, along rural roads and next to township bus stations (Appendix 17). \n \nE. \n \n62. \nThis  is  an  involuntary  resettlement  category  A  project.  GPCD  has  prepared  a \nresettlement  plan  for  the  project  expressway  and  a  resettlement  plan  for  the  rural  roads  and \ntownship bus stations (Appendix 18 and Supplementary Appendix H). The project expressway \nwill cross 83 villages in Wudu district and Wenxian county in Longnan. An estimated 681 ha will \nbe permanently acquired. Based on the PRC standard for impact assessment, 2,834 people will \nlose all their land and agricultural livelihood; since the actual impact will be about one-third loss, \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n                                                 \n29  GPCD will ensure that contractors disseminate information to their employees on the risks of sexually transmitted \ninfections and HIV/AIDS. Local public health offices will disseminate similar information to transport operators, and \nlocal communities, especially women, in the project area.  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Management Plan \n\nan estimated number affected is 8,500 people. About 15,130 square meters of houses will be \ndemolished, requiring the relocation of 151 households with 621 people. No factories or school \nbuildings will be affected. The upgrading of 357 km of rural roads will require relocating about \n100 households  with  400 people,  and  another  500  people  will  be  partly  affected  by  land \nacquisition. The 200 township bus stations do not require land acquisition but will obtain land-\nuse rights for existing construction land in each town. \n \n63. \nGCHC,  in  conjunction  with  the  local  government  land  administration  bureaus,  will  be \nresponsible  for  resettlement  for  the  project  expressway.  The  estimated  resettlement  cost  is \nCNY387 million ($48.3 million equivalent), including taxes and contingencies. The resettlement \ncost for the rural roads and township bus stations is CNY12.4 million ($1.55 million equivalent). \nSince both resettlement plans are based on feasibility studies, GPCD and GCHC must prepare \nand  submit  updated  resettlement  plans  to  ADB  for  approval  before  land  acquisition  and  civil \nworks. The resettlement budgets will be adjusted based on the actual measurement of physical \nlosses  and  approved  compensation  rates.  Affected  persons  (AP)  were  consulted  during  the \npreparation  of  feasibility  studies,  and  resettlement  information  was  disclosed  to  them  by  the \nmedia in April and May 2006. GPCD and GCHC will be responsible for internal supervision and \nmonitoring. Progress reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB quarterly until resettlement \nis completed. GCHC will then prepare a resettlement completion report. GCHC will contract an \nindependent  agency  for external  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  to  prepare  monitoring  reports \nfor submission to GPCD and ADB every 6 months until resettlement is completed. Thereafter, \nannual  evaluation  investigations  will  be  conducted  for  at  least  2 years  and  reported  to  GPCD \nand ADB. \n \nF. \n \nThe Project falls under environmental category A. The environmental impact assessment \n64. \n(EIA)  was  prepared  by  GPCD  and  approved  by \nthe  State  Environmental  Protection \nAdministration on 3 July 2006. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) for rural road and bus \nstations were also prepared. A summary EIA for the Project was prepared and circulated to the \nBoard and made public through ADB's website on 31 May 2006. The EIA and IEEs assessed \nthe environmental impact of the selected alignments of the expressway, the rural roads and the \nbus  stations,  and  prescribed  environmental  protection  and  mitigation  measures,  which  cost \n$85.6 million. The proposed alignment, rural roads, and bus stations do not cross or are not in \nany  protected  areas;  there  are  no  known  rare  or  endangered  species  in  the  project  areas.  To \nensure that all potential adverse environmental impacts are mitigated, GPCD will implement the \nenvironmental management plans (EMP) as specified in the EIA. The EMP will be incorporated \nin the bidding documents and contracts for civil works. \n \nG. \n \n65. \nThe  project  design  has  considered  potential  technical,  economic,  financial,  and  social \nrisks.  The  main  technical  risks  are  associated  with  the  design  and  construction  of  the  many \nproject  tunnels,  particularly  the  8  km  Myaziliang  tunnel.  To  minimize  technical  risks,  (i) the \nProject will be implemented by experienced staff members; (ii) preliminary design will focus on \ngeotechnical  investigations;  (iii)  an  international  tunnel  consultant  will  help  prepare  a  risk \nmanagement  plan;  (iv)  the  prequalification  of  contractors  will  focus  on  their  financial  and \ntechnical capabilities in handling similar works; (v) a contract management information system \nwill help identify technical problems and implement corrective measures on time; and (vi) given \nthe  safety  hazards  associated  with  tunnel  works,  the  contractors  will  be  required  to  strictly \nenforce  working  safety  rules  and  measures.  To  control  the  financial  risks,  the  Project  will \n(i) strengthen  contract  and  cost  management  to  control  potential  cost  overrun,  (ii) inject  more \n\nRisks \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nequity  into  the  Project,  (iii)  introduce  a  market-based  approach  to  formulate  toll  pricing  policy \nand regular review of toll levels to ensure cost recovery, and (iv) build a business environment \nto  generate  non-toll  revenues  along  the  expressway  alignment.  The  social  issues  include \nresettlement  and  HIV/AIDS  infection.  Appropriate  mitigation  measures  are  in  place  in  the \nresettlement plan, SDAP, and EMP. GPCD and GCHC demonstrated a high level of ownership \nin preparing and committing to implement these action plans. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES30 \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government, GPG, GPCD, and GCHC have \n\n \n66. \ngiven the following specific assurances.  \n \nCounterpart  Financing.  The  Government  will,  and  GPG,  through  GPCD  and  GCHC, \n67. \nwill,  ensure  that  provision  of  all  funds  and  resources  necessary  for  construction,  O&M,  and \nmanagement of the Project on a timely basis, and shall take all necessary measures, including \nthe  provision  of  additional  funds,  to  ensure  that  the  GPCD  and  GCHC  can  successfully \nimplement the Project, and operate and manage it after completion. \n \n68. \nConstruction Quality. GPG, through GPCD will ensure that (i) the project expressway, \nrural roads and bus stations are constructed in accordance with the MOC\u2019s technical standards; \nand  (ii)  the  project  construction  supervision,  quality  control,  and  contract  management  are \nconducted in accordance with national standards and internationally accepted practices. \n \n69. \nTransport  Services. GPG, through GPCD will ensure that adequate transport services \nwill be in place so that the project\u2019s benefits will filter down to the rural poor in the project area. \nGPCD will coordinate with other agencies to implement the rural transport services development \nplan. In particular, GPG, through GPCD, will implement the planned public transport facilities in \ntandem with the Project. \n \n70. \nRoad  Transport  Policy  Reform. GPCD will ensure that the road transport action plan \nprepared under ADB-financed TA for policy reform in road transport is implemented in Longnan \nprefecture, if necessary with suitable amendments in consultation with ADB, to improve the road \ntransport efficiency. \n \n71. \nRoad  Safety.  Prior  to  construction  and  operation  of  the  project  expressway  and  rural \nroads, GPG will cause GPCD to (i) establish a road safety inter-agency committee to facilitate \nthe  project  implementation,  and  (ii)  ensure  that  the  independent  road  safety  audits  be  carried \nout and recommendations of these audits are taken into account during project construction and \noperations.  At  least  6  months  prior  to  the  opening  of  the  expressway,  GPG  will,  (i) through \nGPCD, develop and implement a plan to ensure safe operation of road infrastructure facilities; \nand  (ii) establish  a  sufficient  number  of  teams  of  traffic  police  personnel,  in  accordance  with \nnational law and GPG standards, to patrol the project expressway and rural roads and enforce \nthe national regulations. \n \nTolls. In determining the toll level, GPG will take into consideration the levels sufficient \n72. \nto satisfy the GCHC\u2019s minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.2. Six months before the project \nexpressway  opens,  GPCD  through  the  GCHC  will  submit  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and  comment  the \nproposed  toll  structure  and  levels  before  seeking  GPG  approval.  For  the  first  5  years  of \noperation,  GPCD  through  the  GCHC  will  annually  review  the  toll  structure  and  levels,  and \nsubmit  a  report  to  ADB.  GPCD  through  the  GCHC  will  submit  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and  comment \nthe toll level adjustment, if any, before seeking GPG approval. \n                                                 \n30  The complete list of loan assurances is included in the loan and project agreements. \n\n \n\n\fFinancial Ratios. To ensure financial sustainability, GCHC will maintain (i) a debt-equity \n73. \nratio  of  not  more  than  65:35;  (ii) a  working  ratio  (annual  O&M  cost,  but  excluding  periodic \nmaintenance cost, to revenue) of not more than 15%; and (iii) a debt service coverage ratio of \nnot less than 1.2 from the sixth year of operation. \n \n74. \nCorporate  Governance.  GPCD  and  GCHC  will  enter  into  a  concession  framework \nagreement  by  30  September  2007  covering  both  ADB-financed  Gansu  Roads  Development \nProject  and  this  Project  in  a  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB  to  ensure  autonomy  of \noperations,  encourage  the  establishment  of  road  performance  indicators,  and  facilitate \nrefinancing  of  road  sector  assets.  GCHC  will  prepare  a  corporate  development  plan  by \n31 December  2008  to  assure  high  standards  of  corporate  governance,  management  practice, \nand financing reporting.  \n \n75. \nPrivate  Sector  Development.  Six  months  before  the  project  facilities  open,  GPG \nthrough  the  GCHC  will  analyze  the  feasibility  of  attracting  private  sector  investment  funds  for \nfuture  road  sector  investment,  including  possible  private  sector  participation  in  O&M  of  the \nproject expressway, and report its conclusions to ADB. \n \n76. \nRural  Road  Maintenance.  GPG  shall  cause  that  GPCD  (i)  implement  the  rural  roads \nmaintenance  regulation  as  approved  by  GPG,  (ii)  establish  an  efficient  prioritization  and \nmonitoring  system  as  specified  in  the  rural  road  maintenance  plan,  and  (iii)  provide  a  training \nprogram  under  the  project  implementation  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  local  government \nmaintenance  units  and  local  communities.  GPG  shall  cause  the  local  governments  to  ensure \nadequate funding and effective management of project\u2019s rural roads. \n \n77. \nCapacity  Building.  GCHC,  in  consultation  with  GPCD,  will  prepare  a human  resource \ndevelopment  plan.  Before  undertaking  international  training,  the  GCHC  will  prepare  for  ADB\u2019s \nconcurrence a training plan, a program of workshops to be delivered at the GCHC by the people \ntrained  internationally  and  a  list  of  training  equipment  and  aids  to  strengthen  the  GCHC\u2019s \ndomestic training programs. \n \n78. \nEnvironment.  GPG,  through  GPCD  and  GCHC  will  ensure  that  (i)  the  Project  is \ndesigned, constructed and operated in accordance with environmental laws and regulations of \nthe  Government  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  and  the  EIA;  (ii)  the  EMP  and  the \nmitigation measures included therein, as specified in the project EIA are properly implemented; \n(iii) the EMP is updated, at engineering design stage, and incorporated into bidding documents \nand  civil  works  contracts;  (iv)  any  adverse  impact  on  the  environment  that  may  arise  from \nproject implementation activities is promptly mitigated or minimized in accordance with the EMP; \nand  (v) implementation  of  the  EMP,  including  any  safety  breaches,  violation  of  environmental \nstandards, and corrective measures taken thereto, is reported semiannually to ADB. \n \n79. \nVehicle Emissions. At least 6 months prior to the opening of the expressway, GPG will \n(i)  provide  to  ADB  the  national  emission  standards  and  the  penalties  for  infringement  of  such \nstandards; and (ii) ensure that Gansu Provincial Environmental Bureau, Gansu Public Security \nBureau,  and  other  agencies  enforce  the  national  vehicle  emission  standards,  and  fulfill  the \nrequirements of the government strategies. \n \n80. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  GPG  and  GCHC  will  ensure  that  (i)  the \nresettlement  plan  for  the  project  expressway  and  the  resettlement  plan  for  rural  roads  and \ntownship  bus  stations  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  their  terms  and  with  all  applicable \ngovernment laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, (ii) all land and \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\nrights-of-way  required  by  the  Project  be  made  available  in  a  timely  manner,  (iii)  the  timely \nprovision  of  counterpart  funds  and  compensation  and  resettlement  assistance  be  made  to  the  \nAPs prior to dispossession and displacement, to ensure that APs be at least as well off as they \nwould  have  been  in  the  absence  of  the  Project,  (iv)  the  updated  resettlement  plans  (RP)  be \napproved by ADB prior to commencement of land acquisition and house demolition, (v) that civil \nworks  contractors  implement  the  RPs  in  compliance  with  PRC  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB's \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement through contractual requirements and construction supervision, \n(vi) adequate staff and resources be committed to supervising and monitoring the implementation \nof the RPs and satisfaction of ADB's report requirements, (vii) an independent agency acceptable \nto  ADB  be  engaged  by  GPCD  and  GCHC  to  monitor  and  evaluate  results  of  implementation  of \nRPs  and  forward  reports  to  ADB  and  GPCD  as  required,  and  (viii) a  summary  of  the  final \ngovernment audit of resettlement disbursements and expenditures submitted to ADB. \n \n81. \nPoverty  Reduction.  GPG,  through  GPCD  and  GCHC  will  cause  the  contractors \ninvolved  in  the  project  implementation  to  maximize  the  employment  of  local  poor  people, \nincluding  ethnic  minorities,  who  meet  the  job  and  efficiency  requirements  for  construction  and \nmaintenance of the project roads and township bus stations. Such workers will be provided with \nadequate on-the-job training. GPCD will (i) implement the Project in accordance with the SDAP; \nand (ii) monitor the project impact on poverty in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the \nproject performance management system (PPMS). \n \n82. \nLabor  Standards.  GPG  will  ensure  that  all  the  employment  and  labor  standards \nprovided in the applicable laws and regulations of the PRC be complied with, and in particular, \nthat all civil works contractors engaged under the Project (i) provide timely payment of wages on \nat least a monthly basis and safe working conditions to all workers including male and female \nworkers,  with  such  requirements  being  included  in  the  civil  works  contracts  and  monitored  by \nthe  construction  supervision  consultants;  (ii)  provide  employment  opportunity  to  women  and \nethnic minorities, where appropriate, and pay equal wages to the male and female employees \nfor equivalent works; and (iii) not employ child labor in the project works. \n \n83. \nGender and Development. GPG, through GPCD and GCHC will follow ADB\u2019s Policy on \nGender  and  Development  during  project  implementation  and  take  necessary  steps  to \nencourage  women  living  in  the  project  area  to  participate  in  planning  and  implementing  the \nProject,  including  causing  the  contractors  on  maximizing  employment  of  women  in  connection \nthe Project. GPCD will monitor the project\u2019s effects on women during project implementation. \n \nHealth  Risks.  GPCD  and  GCHC,  in  coordination  with  the  appropriate  agencies \n84. \nidentified  by  the  Government  and  the  Center  for  Disease  Control  of  the  GPG,  will  cause  the \ncontractors to disseminate information on the risks of socially and sexually transmitted diseases, \nincluding  HIV/AIDS,  to  their  employees  during  project  implementation.  GPCD  will  cause  the \nappropriate  agencies  to  disseminate  similar  information  to  transport  operators  and  to  local \ncommunities living in the project area during project implementation and operation of the project \nfacilities. GPG, through GPCD, will cause contractors to monitor health risk control according to \nthe Implementation Methods of Epidemic Prevention Law of the PRC (1991). \n \n85. \nAxle  Loads.  GPCD  through  GCHC  will  install  vehicle  axle-weighing  equipment  at \nselected entry points of project expressway and make suitable arrangements for the operation \nof such equipment. Before opening the project expressway, the GCHC  will submit to ADB the \nplan  for  operation  of  the  vehicle  weigh  stations,  including  the  prescribed  axle-load  limits  and \npenalties for infringement. \n\n \n\n\f86.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  GPCD  through  GCHC  will  monitor  and  evaluate  project \nimpacts,  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultants,  as  specified  in  the  PPMS,  to  ensure  that  the \nproject  facilities  are  managed  effectively  and  the  benefits,  particularly  to  the  poor,  are \nmaximized. GPCD will (i) hire a qualified domestic institute to carry out the monitoring activities \nprior to project implementation; (ii) ensure that the local governments, including local statistics \noffices,  collect  the  data  to  measure  the  indicators  in  the  PPMS  prior  to  and  during  project \nimplementation, at completion, and annually 3 years thereafter, with the frequency as specified \nin the PPMS; and (iii) submit to ADB the reports summarizing the key findings of monitoring. \n \n87. \nAsset  Management.  GPCD  will  (i)  prepare  an  asset  management  development  plan, \nwith  the  assistance  of  consultants,  which  will  establish  a  computerized  database  system  and \npromote the use of modern equipment; and (ii) provide a training program to enhance staff skills \nat provincial, county, and township levels.  \n \n88. \nChange  in  Ownership.  In  the  event  that  (i)  any  change  in  ownership  of  the  project \nfacilities,  expressway,  rural  roads,  or  township  bus  stations;  or  (ii)  any  sale,  transfer,  or \nassignment  of  the  Borrower\u2019s  and  GPCD\u2019s  shares  or  interest  or  the  GCHC\u2019s  interest  in  the \nproject expressway is anticipated, the Government, GPCD, and the GCHC will consult with ADB \nat least 6 months prior to the implementation of such change. The Government, GPCD and the \nGCHC will ensure that such change be carried out in a lawful and transparent manner. \n \n89. \nAnticorruption  Measures.  GPG  through  GPCD  will  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s anticorruption policy will be followed. GPCD through the GCHC will also ensure, in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  regulations  and  requirements,  during  project  implementation \nthat  (i) officials  from  the  Discipline  and  Inspection  Bureau  will  be  resident  in  project  offices  for \nbidding, construction, and operations; (ii) an internal audit unit will be established in GCHC; (iii) a \ntwo-contract system will be adopted where the winner of a civil works contract must also sign an \nanticorruption  contract  with  the  employer;  and  (iv)  periodic  inspection  of  contractors  will  be \nundertaken  to  ensure  that  fund  withdrawal  and  settlement  procedures  are  followed.  GPCD  will \ninitiate  liaison  meetings  with  the  Prosecutor's  Office,  on  a  needed  basis,  to  discuss  warnings \nabout or information on corrupt practices. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n90. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nAsian Development Bank and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $300,000,000 to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China for the Southern Gansu Roads Development Project from ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)\u2013based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  25  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n24 November 2006\n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nPerformance Targets/Indicators \n\nData \nSources/Reporting \nMechanisms  \n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21 \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nImpact \nSustainable economic \ngrowth and poverty \nreduction in Gansu \nprovince and the \nproject area \n \n\n \n\u2022  GDP is forecast to increase per annum \nby 7% to 8% for Gansu and 8% to 9% \nfor the project area during 2010\u20132020. \n\n \nGansu Statistics \nYearbook \n \n\n\u2022  Per capita rural income in the project \narea will increase from CNY1,300 in \n2005 to CNY2,500 in 2015. \n\n\u2022  Poverty incidence in the project area is \nreduced from 37% in 2005 to 16% in \n2015. \n\n\u2022  Trade within and between Gansu and \n\nSichuan is forecast to increase by 10% \nduring 2010\u20132015. \n\nGansu Statistics \nYearbook \n \nProvincial and county \nstatistics offices \n\nProvincial and county \nstatistics offices  \n \n\nOutcome \n1.

Investment in road infrastructure during the Tenth Five-Year Plan (10th FYP, \n1. \n2001\u20132005)  reached  CNY1,900  billion,  more  than  double  that  in  the  previous  5  years.  By  the \nend of 2005, the road network reached 1.93 million kilometer (km). Road density increased from \n12.1 km per 100  square kilometer (km2) in 1995 to 20.0 km per 100 km2 in 2005. However, the \ndensity of the road network ranks among the lowest in the world relative to either population or \ngeographic  area,  particularly  in  the  western  region.  With  a  total  length  of  41,330  km,  Gansu\u2019s \nroad  network  accounted  for  2.1%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  roads.  Road  density  in  Gansu  was \n9.1 km per 100 km2, significantly lower than the national average.  \n \n2. \nRoad Transport. Despite efforts to increase transport capacity, serious constraints and \nbottlenecks remain, especially in the road sector. Expressways account for 2% of the total road \nnetwork, class-I highways for 2%, and class-II highways for 13%. About 83% of the remaining \nroads  are  medium-  to  low-grade  paved  road  and  gravel  roads.  Because  of  rapid  economic \ngrowth  since  1978,  demand  for  transport  services  has  increased  many  times.1 The  privately \nowned fleet increased nearly 80 times, from 0.3 million to 23.7 million during 1985\u20132005. Road \npassenger traffic in Gansu grew by 6.4% per annum during 1990\u20132005, lower than the national \naverage of 9.0%. Road freight traffic, in ton-km, grew at 6.0% per year during the same period, \ncompared  with  6.2%  per  year  for  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  as  a  whole.  In  2005, \nthere  were  457,700  trucks  and  passenger  vehicles  in  Gansu,  or  1.8  vehicles  per  100  people, \nlower than national average of 2.4 vehicles per 100 persons. Privately owned vehicles in Gansu \ntotaled 247,300 in 2005. \n \nGovernment  Sector  Development  Strategy.  The  Government  key  sector  strategy \n3. \nduring the 10th FYP is the development of a national trunk highway system (NTHS) to connect \n12 provincial capitals with a population of 500,000 or more. By the end of 2005, 31,000 km of \nthe  NTHS  had  been  completed  and  the  total  NTHS  will  be  completed  by  2007.  In  2001,  the \nMinistry  of  Communications  (MOC)  released  plans  to  construct  the  western  region  corridor \ntotaling 17,500 km. Much of the proposed construction is directed as part of the Government\u2019s \nWestern  Region  Development  Strategy.  By  the  end  of  2005,  11,000  km  of  class-II  and  above \nhighways had been completed and the remaining sections will be completed by 2010. In 2005, \nthe  State  Council  approved  the  National  Expressway  Network  Program  to  expand  the \nexpressway  network  to  85,000 km  by  2020.  The  program  aims  to  connect  all  cities  with  a \npopulation  of  200,000  or  more.  Priority  will  be  given  to  developing  expressways  in  poor,  less \ndeveloped interior regions that lack transport. By the end of 2005, 33,000 km of expressway had \nbeen completed and the rest will be constructed by 2020. \n \n4. \nroads  are  underdeveloped:  38,426 villages  and \n75 townships,  most  of  which  are  in  western  region,  are  not  connected  with  roads.  Out  of \n1.56 million  km  of  the  total  rural  roads  (county  roads  and  below),  80%  are  class-IV  and \nunclassified,  and  60%  of  which  have  some  level  of  gravel  surfacing  or  are  unpaved. \nRecognizing the importance of improved rural roads to poverty reduction and reducing the gap \nbetween  rural  and  urban  economy,  the  Government  announced  plans  in  2003  for  5,300  rural \nroad  projects,  with  a  total  length  of 78,000  km. The  Government  will  accelerate  the  rural  road \nimprovement. In accordance with the National Rural Road Development Plan during 2006\u20132010, \na total of 2.4 million km of rural roads will be upgraded with a total investment of CNY800 billion. \nOf  this,  CNY140  billion  will  be  provided  by  the  central  government.  The  plan  is  that  by  2010, \npaved  roads  will  reach  all  of  townships  across  the  country,  as  well  as  all  villages  in  eastern \nregion, 88% of villages in the central region and 50% of villages in the western region. Villages \nin the western region will at least have access to roads by 2010. \n                                                 \n1   Road  freight  traffic  increased  from  27.4  billion  ton-km  in  1978  to  869.3  billion  ton-km  (32  times)  in  2005.  Road \n\nRural  Road  Network.  Rural \n\npassenger traffic increased from 52.1 billon passenger-km in 1978 to 929.2 billion passenger-km (18 times). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\n5. \nRural  Transport  Services. Poor road conditions have resulted in inadequate transport \nin  rural  poor  areas.  Because  of  poor  roads,  low  demand,  high  operating  costs,  transport \noperators  are  unwilling  to  provide  services  or  are  not  permitted  to  do  so  for  safety  reasons. \nOther  issues  are  inadequate  transport  facilities,  lack  of  competition  in  the  transport  service \nmarket,  and  regulations  on  tariff,  routes,  and  schedules  for  bus  services,  which  have  led  to \ninefficient use of vehicles. MOC has prepared the national rural transport services development \nplan  for  2006\u20132010,  under  which  township  bus  stations  will  connect  all  townships,  and  bus \nstops will connect all villages. This will further enhance benefit flowing to the rural poor. \n \nRoad  Maintenance.  Although  maintenance  expenditure  increased  significantly  in \n6. \nabsolute  terms  in  the  past  decade,  its  share  of  road  expenditures  decreased.  While  highways \nare relatively well maintained, rural road maintenance remains a challenge. In 2005, the State \nCouncil called for reform of rural road maintenance. MOC is closely coordinating with provincial \ngovernments  to  implement  the  policy.  MOC  is  organizing  a  nationwide  rural  road  survey  to \ndevelop the rural road database, which will be introduced in stages to all provinces. \n \nResource  Mobilization.  Despite  massive  investment  in  the  road  sector  (3%  of  gross \n7. \ndomestic  product  on  average  in  2001\u20132005),  funding  is  still  insufficient  to  meet  the  demand. \nDuring the 10th FYP, state subsidy and vehicle purchase tax provided 14% of the financing, and \nthe rest was financed by provincial resources (42%), domestic loans (42%), and foreign loans \n(2%).  The  growing  demand  for  transport  infrastructure  will  require  the  sector  to  shift  from  the \nconventional  financing  modes  toward  the  capital  markets  and  private  sector  investment.  Bond \nissues are also suitable for road projects because of their long-term and stable earning streams. \nHowever, any capital market instrument requires an adequate legal and regulatory framework, \npublic disclosure, and strong credit standing.

General.  Rural  roads  and  rural  transport  services  form  a  rural  transport  system.  In \nsouthern Gansu, rural roads are poor and transport services are inadequate. Passengers board \nbuses on roadsides, which is dangerous, or at temporary bus stops. In Longnan, 129 townships \ndo  not  have  the  lowest-class  rural  bus  station,  820 villages  have  no  direct  access  to  a  formal \nbus services as bus operators are unwilling to provide them because of poor roads, resulting in \nhigh  operating  costs  and  safety  concerns.  Transport  demand  is  met  by  various  informal \ntransport services, typically motor-tricycles, agriculture tractors, and dual-purpose pickups. They \nprovide local services between villages and townships for the villagers, and are more expensive \nthan the regulated fare.1 \n \n2. \nTransport Demand. Social surveys reveal that the average household makes 48 trips per \nyear, of which 56% were motorized for journey length over 6 km. More than 60% of trips take \nplace close to the nearest town or markets. External trips are fewer. Vehicle ownership is low in \nthe project area.2 Walking and bicycling are the major modes of transport for short trips. As the \ndistance increases, so does the number of motorized trips.  \n \n3. \nPassenger Services. Bus fares and routes of the formal bus system are regulated, often \nresulting in inefficient services and low vehicle utilization. Bus fares depend on the type of bus \nand road conditions, with an increase of 20% allowed during holidays. The regulations provide a \nsmall variation between different road classes, e.g., an increase of 5% of base fare is allowed \nfor classes-II\u2013III roads and an increase of 8% of base fare for class-IV and unclassified roads, \nas  against  base  fares  set  on  class-I  and  expressways.  Rural  bus  fares  do  not  reflect \nopportunities  for  improving  vehicle  utilization  and  lowering  unit  operating  costs  through  a \nrelaxation  of  regulatory  restrictions  on  operations  and  schedules.  Average  bus  occupancy  of \naround 65% for inter-prefecture and inter-county routes. \n \n4. \nImportance  of  Rural  Transport  System. Improved rural roads provide the physical link \nfrom  villages  to  the  higher  levels  of  the  road  network  and  hence  to  the  regional  and  national \neconomy.  Since  few  rural  farmers  own  motor  vehicles  and  rural  roads  are  the  only  means  of \ntransport in the project area, rural transport is the only way that rural households are linked to \nthe wider economy. In Suzhou prefecture in Gansu, seven township bus stations were built in \n2003. This resulted in: (i) per capita annual income increase of CNY100 in 2004, (ii) total freight \ntraffic  increased  by  300,000  tons  and  passenger  traffic  increased  by  200,000  people,  and \n(iii) average daily passenger traffic per township bus station reached 300. Other social benefits \nare summarized in Table A4.1, which indicates strong empirical evidence to support the social \nand economic justifications for the provision of an efficient rural transport system. \n\n                                                 \n1   Based on the social surveys, an average unit cost of CNY0.30 per kilometer (km) is paid for trips from a village to a \ntownship  center  (roughly  about  15\u201320  km),  which  is  much  higher  than  regular  bus  fare  for  the  same  distance  in \nperiurban areas in Gansu (CNY0.20 and less per km).  \n\n2   Nearly 40% of households have bicycles, 23% of families own one motorcycle, 20% of families have one animal \n\ncart, and only 11% of households have one agricultural vehicle. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nTable A4.1: Benefits Resulting from Improved Transport Services \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\nImproved rural mobility and life quality (to access markets, schools, clinics, jobs, and service centers, etc.) \n\nA.

The Project focuses on improvement of township-level transport services in \nsouthern Gansu where people lack mobility and have poor accessibility. The basic conditions for \ntownship  bus  station  development  are  in  place  in  the  project  area:  relatively  high  population \ndensity  (an  average  20,000  people  for  each  township),  medium  distance  between  townships \n(about  20  km  away  in  the  project  area),  irrigated  agriculture,  cash  crops,  and  non-agriculture \nemployment.  The  Project  will  (i)  provide  reliable,  safe  and  more  efficient  bus  services; \n(ii) promote  an  efficient  marketing  system\u2014the  township  bus  stations  will  be  close  enough  to \ntownship  markets  that  rural  people  can  sell  their  products  directly  and  in  a  timely  manner  in  \nmarkets  without  the  need  for  traders  and  wholesalers;  (iii)  improve  information  exchange  by \nproviding a kiosk in each station; and (iv) improve access to socioeconomic activities (education, \nhealth  care,  employment,  and  income  generation).  Local  communities  are  enthusiastic  about \ninvesting  in  bus  stations  because  of  their  positive  impacts  on  rural  development,  accessibility, \nand poverty reduction. \n\n \nTownship  Bus  Stations.  The  Project  will  include  the  construction  of  200  class-V \n6. \ntownship bus stations,3 with 100 in Longnan, 50 in Tianshui, and 50 in Dingxi. This component \nwill  benefit  3.9  million  people  living  in  the  200  townships  (1.96  million  people  in  Longnan, \n0.99 million in Tianshui, and 0.95 million in Dingxi). The unit cost of a class-V township station is \nestimated  at  CNY400,000  ($50,000  equivalent).  The  total  cost  of  the  transport  service \ncomponent would be CNY80 million ($10 million), of which $5 million will be financed by Asian \nDevelopment Bank loan. The Project will encourage the active participation of local communities \nin planning, implementation, and monitoring. Local communities that invest in the bus stations \nwill  have  priority \nits  profits.  Gansu  Provincial \nthe  business  and  getting \nCommunications  Department  (GPCD)  agreed  to  ensure  the  bus  stations  construction  are \ncompleted  in  tandem  with  the  project  local  roads  to  ensure  the  efficient  provision  of  services \nwhen the local roads are built. \n \n7. \nImprove Rural Transport Service. Expanding rural transport services is an integral part \nof Gansu\u2019s plan for improving rural transport system. A total of 318 township bus stations had \nbeen  constructed  and  were  being  operated  in  Gansu  by  31  May  2006:  157  are  in  southern \nGansu, with 40 out of 169 townships in Longnan, 69 out of 119 townships in Dingxi, and 48 out \n\nin  running \n\n                                                 \n3   Bus centers are classified by design capacity into class-I\u2013V bus stations and bus stops. The design capacity of a \n\nclass-V station is less than 300 passengers daily with the average construction area of 250 square meters. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n32 \n \nof  113 townships  in  Tianshui.  GPCD  agreed  to  build  all  remaining  township  bus  stations  by \n2010. \n \n8. \nPilot  Policy  Reform.  Asian  Development  Bank  provided  assistance  for  a  technical \nassistance  on  policy  reform  in  road  transport.4 The  technical  assistance  reviewed  the  current \nstatus and issues in road freight and passenger transport, and prepared an action plan of policy \nreform, recommending policy and regulatory measures to improve its efficiency, such as easing \nthe  rules  that  confine  buses  to  individual  routes  and  fixed  schedules,  thereby  reducing  the \npotential for improved productivity, and allowing cost savings to be passed on to road users as \nlower fares. In Longnan, which is in difficult mountainous terrain, roads are the only means of \ntransport.  Main  constraints  facing  Longnan  includes  low  vehicle  use  rates  and  high  vehicle \noperating costs. GPCD has agreed to pilot-test some recommendations listed in the action plan \n(Table A4.2). Experiences gained in Longnan will be expanded to other areas. \n \n\nTable A4.2: Action Plan of Pilot Transport Policy Reform in Longnan Prefecture \n\nAction \n\nBy Whom \n\nComments/Requirements \n\nForm PPIC and assess the possible \nconsequences of policy reform  \n\nGPCD/GTAB  Explain why Longnan was chosen and \n\ndelivery of initial program \n\nIdentify affected provincial regulations/institutions \n \nIdentify bus routes affected \n \nIdentify all participating operators and terminals \n \nIdentify other cities/provinces affected \n \nRationalize vehicle inspection requirements and \nenforcement procedures \n\nDetermine the degree of deregulation of bus \noperators, bus fares, bus routes, and vehicles \nPublicize pilot project \n\nDesign procedures and criteria for operator \nlicenses, route licenses, vehicle licenses,  \nIntroduce new operator and route permits and \nnew bus licenses \n\nEncourage formation of area-based operator \nassociations for small operators \n\nEase existing fare restriction  \nIntroduce measures to prevent predatory \nundercutting \n\nRelax categorization for existing operators \nEase restrictions on bus allocation to routes to \nimprove vehicle and staff productivity \n \n\nGPCD/ \nGTAB/ \nLocal \ngovernment \n\nPPIC \n\nPPIC \n\nPPIC \n\nGPCD \n\nGPCD \n\nGPCD \n\nGPCD \n\n10  Ease market entry conditions \n\nGPCD \n\nDetermination of more detailed \nregulations \n \nOperators serving the prefecture, \nwhether based there or not \n \nDestinations of routes from Longnan \nand terminals used by these routes \nIncorporating with technical \nimprovements \n\nTo be determined based on results of \n2, and 3. \nMedia announcements, presentations, \nworkshops, etc. \nEnsure disadvantageous groups, such \nas poor residents in remote areas, are \ntaken care of with at least minimum-level \nservices, subsidized by the government, \nif necessary \n\nMedia announcement, presentations, \nworkshops, etc. \n\nEnsure market competition is fair and \nnegative externalities, such as \nenvironmental pollution are minimized or \ninternalized by taxes and fees. \nMeasures needed to prevent under-\nsupply of bus service at \u201dcold\u201d hours \nOperators must obtain licenses for new \nroutes \nLow fare rates are more likely to result \nfrom a competitive market, efficient \noperation, and pressure from users on \nlocal service operators.  \n\nGPCD  =  Gansu  Provincial  Communications  Department,  GTAB  =  Gansu  Transport  Administration  Bureau,                 \nNo. = number, PPIC = pilot project implementation committee. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates and technical assistance consultants. \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB. 2004.

Road safety is a serious issue in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The \n1. \nWorld  Health  Organization  estimates  that  road  accidents  cost  the  PRC  economy  from \n$12 billion  to  $21  billion  each  year,  about  1.5%  of  the  gross  domestic  product. 1  In  2005, \n98,738 people were killed and 469,911 were injured in 450,254 road accidents.2 Unless urgent \naction is taken, road traffic fatalities in the PRC are predicted to increase to almost half a million \nper  year  by  2020.  Main  causes  of  the  poor  road  safety  are  (i)  lack  of  interdepartmental \ncoordination and ownership; (ii) poor roads; (iii) a shortage of measures such as data systems \nand  monitoring,  road  safety  audit,  inspection  systems;  (iv)  shortage  of  skilled  staff  and \nresources; and (iv) weak enforcement. \n \n2. \nPolicy  Framework.  The  Government  thus  created  a  15-ministry  committee  under  the \nState  Council  and  promulgated  the  first  Road  Traffic  Safety  Law,  which  took  effect  in  May \n2004.3 The  number  of  accidents  dropped  by  13.1%  from  2004,  the  fatality  rate  decreased  by \n7.8%,  and  number  of  injured  diminished  by  2.3%.  In  2005,  Gansu  had  5,414  accidents, \ninvolving 1,799 fatalities and 5,406 injuries, a decrease of 14.3%, 10.0%, and 2.7% from 2004. \nThe  reduction  in  accidents  in  2005  is  in  part  attributable  to  new  road  safety  law,  coordinated \ngovernment  efforts,  and  strengthened  enforcement.  For  example,  Gansu  introduced  a  10% \nincrease  in  fines  for  overloaded  vehicles  leading  to  a  major  drop  in  the  number  of  crashes \nattributable to overloading.4 \n \nProject  Roads  Safety. The Project will ensure that all the necessary safety measures \n3. \nare in place. An independent road safety audit of the project roads will be carried out during final \ndesign and construction as well as before the opening of the project expressway. Axle-weighing \nequipment will be installed on project roads to control vehicle overloading in the corridor. GPCD \nwill concentrate on the engineering, road safety audit, blind-spot improvement, and operational \nissues, while the Gansu Provincial Security Bureau will deal with the traffic law enforcement. An \nintegrated  plan  has  been  developed  and  will  be  included  in  the  project  administration \nmemorandum to help the agencies to improve road safety in the region. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nWith the growing concern of vehicle emissions in the PRC, the Government is taking a \nseries of measures to control emissions. The Gansu Environmental Protection Bureau (GEPB) \nis  responsible  for  regulating  vehicle  emissions,  in  cooperation  with  the  Gansu  Provincial \nSecurity  Bureau.  Gansu  follows  the  stricter  national  vehicle  emission  control  standards \n(Table A5.1).  By  the  time  the  Project  is  completed,  hydrocarbons,  carbon  monoxide,  and \nnitrogen  oxide  emissions  from  vehicles  on  the  project  roads  are  estimated  to  be  at  least  20% \nlower  than  without  the  Project  because  of  faster  and  shorter  travel.  Under  the  Project,  GPCD \nand GEPB will take the following recommended measures to further control vehicle emissions \nand air pollution (Table A5.2). \n\nVehicle Emissions \n\n                                                 \n1   World Health Organization and Word Bank. 2004.

Technical Assistance \n\nto the People\u2019s Republic of China for Capacity Building in Traffic Safety, Planning, and Management. Manila). \n\n4   Gansu  introduced  the  Provincial  Roads  Safety  Ordinance,  effective  on  1  January  2006.  The  ceiling  of  financial \npenalty for overloading increased from CNY200 to CNY2,000. Overloading cases have substantially decreased. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nTable A5.1: Provincial Vehicle Emissions Control Strategy \n\n \n\n \n\nStrategy \n \nRegulating emission standards  \n \n\nImproving convention fuels \n\nEncouraging alternative or cleane\nfuels \n \n\nInspection/maintenance (I/M) \nprogram \n\nRetiring obsolete vehicles \n\nTargets \n\n \nIssue time-bound permits. \nAdopt performance standards equivalent to Euro II performance standards.  \nAdopt performance standards equivalent to the Euro III by July 2007. \nAdopt performance standards equivalent to the Euro IV by July 2010. \nBy then, vehicle emissions will be reduced by 30\u201350%  \nFor diesel vehicles, they need to use diesel with sulphur levels lower than \n500 parts per million. \nImpose further reductions in sulphur levels upon adoption of new stricter vehicle \nemission standards. \nEncourage production of alternative fuel vehicle or modification of existing \nvehicles to dual fuel engine vehicles.  \nBy 2005, a total of 1,916 buses and 1,546 taxies in Lanzhou had been converted.  \nBy 2005, 8 compressed natural gas filling stations for dual engine vehicle have \nbeen installed. \nGEPB has estimated a mandatory I/M program for vehicle emission control. \nLight-duty vehicles that are less than 6 years old must be inspected every 2 years, \nand annually for other vehicles.  \nEmission control devices are required to be repaired, updated, and installed if the \nvehicle cannot meet the required standards.  \nIn 2004, about 10,714 vehicles were selected for roadside testing.  \nForced retirement of vehicles that are more than 10 years old and failed the \nemission inspection test for three consecutive times. \nThe state subsidizes the loss to the owner according to regulations.  \nIn 2004, Lanzhou retired 1,439 old vehicles that did not meet the standards. \n\nSources: Gansu Environmental Protection Bureau. \n\n \nTable A5.2: Recommended Measures in Vehicle Emissions Control \n\nItem \nStrengthen Gansu Environmental \nProtection Bureau at Various \nLevels \n\nEncourage Gas Stations along the \nExpressway to Provide Clean \nFuels \n \n\nStrengthening Environmental \nMonitoring \n\nCapacity Building \n\nRecommended Measures \nLaunch training programs on vehicle emission control. \nProvide training in emission testing for staff working at testing centers and \nroadside testing. \nEstablish emission testing centers in all municipalities of the province. \nIntroduce well-functioning audit and quality assurance system. \nPromote inspection and maintenance. \nEncourage gas stations to provide clean fuels, such as compressed natural \ngas, liquefied natural gas and reformulated gasoline, in addition to normal \ngasoline.  \nEncourage gas stations to install gasoline vapor capture equipment to reduce \nthe noxious emissions. \nEngage a qualified environmental monitoring institution to monitor ambient air \nquality along the expressway, particularly at sensitive receptors, such as \nschool, hospital, and residential sites. \nConduct a capacity building and training program during project \nimplementation to strengthen the local capacity. \n\nSources: Gansu Provincial Communications Department and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n35 \n\nRURAL ROADS IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM \n\ntotal \n\nroad  network \n\nOverview.  The \n\nin  Longnan  prefecture  has  a \n\n \n1. \nlength  of \n11,297 kilometer (km), mostly in poor condition; of this, 8,893 km (or 80%) is unclassified. There \nare  no  class-I  and  above  roads  and  class-II  roads  account  for  only  3%  of  the  total  length.  In \nLongnan, 787 villages are not connected with roads. Many villages rely on earth tracks that are \nunsuitable for motorized traffic due to poor riding quality, and which become impassable during \nthe rainy and winter seasons. Bridges are of poor quality and take only light loads. Many smaller \nrivers are crossed by fording. Some sections of county roads are currently impassible because \nof  landslides  or  mudflows.  Where  they  are  passable,  vehicle  operation  costs  tend  to  be  high. \nAgricultural tractors and motor tricycles are the main form of motorized transport for both goods \nand people. It is estimated that the lack of roads has resulted in 10\u201320% of agricultural produce \nbeing wasted because of inability to transport it to markets and processing centers. \n \n2. \nPaving the Unpaved Roads for the Poor. It is important to focus on the improvement \nof a core rural road network that would ensure a minimum connectivity for each township to a \nnearby  main  road.  Gansu  Provincial  Communications  Department  agreed  to  integrate  a  local \nroad  component,  comprising  seven  roads  in  total  357  km  to  be  upgraded  from  unclassified  to \nclass-III or IV (Table A6). They were selected on the basis of road network efficiency from the \nprovincial  Rural  Road  Development  Plan,  economic  development  potential,  and  poverty \nincidence  and  population  density.  The  existing  roads  are  in  very  poor  condition,  sections  are \nunpaved,  and  traffic  on  these  roads  has  reached  a  certain  level,  so  it  is  more  economical  to \nupgrade and pave them than maintain the unpaved roads to all weather condition. The total cost \nof  the  program  is  CNY233.8 million  ($29.2  million),  of  which  Asian  Development  Bank  will \nfinance  $15  million  of  Wudu\u2013Lixian  road.  The  rest  will  be  financed  by  the  Government  in \nconjunction of implementation of its Rural Road Development Plan by 2011. \n \n3. \nBenefits.  The  rural  roads  have  been  evaluated.  The  major  cost  savings  will  be  in  the \nform of reduced vehicle operating costs which will ultimately convert to lower agricultural input \ncosts  and  higher  margins  for  agricultural  output.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  rural \nroads network was satisfactory with an overall economic internal rate of return of 23% and a net \npresent value of CNY285.6 million. Gansu Provincial Communications Department will start the \nconstruction  of  the  project  rural  roads  concurrently  with  the  project  expressway  and  be \ncompleted by 2011. The Program will directly benefit 763,000 people, about 52% of whom are \npoor beneficiaries, living below the Government low-income of CNY852 per capita per year. \n \n\nRoad Name \n\nImprovement \n\nTable A6: Rural Roads Improvement Program \n \nTowns \nServed \n\nPopulation \nServed \n\nLength \n(km) \n\n1.

Adequate  and  timely  maintenance  is  important  to  ensure  the \nsustainability  of  rural  roads.  With  the  increasing  length  of  the  road  network,  rapid  increase  in \ntraffic  volumes,  and  the  trend  toward  using  larger  trucks  with  heavier  axle  loads,  there  is  a \ngrowing  concern  about  the  accelerating  maintenance  requirements  in  the  future.  Road  sector \nfunding is still insufficient to meet demand of both construction and maintenance, particularly for \nthe  rural  roads  in  the  west  region.  In  Gansu,  local  road  administrative  units  in  county \ngovernments  are  responsible  for  rural  roads  maintenance,  and  the  quality  of  rural  roads  is \nperiodically monitored by prefecture and provincial highway administration bureau. Main issues \nassociated  with  rural  road  maintenance  are:  (i)  insufficient  funding,  (ii)  inadequate  planning, \n(iii) limited  implementation  capacity,  and  (iv)  lack  of  market-oriented  approach  and  framework. \nRural  road  maintenance  is  generally  done  by  the  road  administrations,  although  it  starts  to \nexperiment with maintenance by contracting out progressively.  \n \n2. \nOverall  Road  Maintenance  Expenditure.  In  Gansu,  the  need  for  maintenance  is \nincreasingly recognized by various levels of the government. In terms of sustainability of overall \nroad maintenance with the resource allocated, about 81\u201385% of the road maintenance fee was \nspent  for  road  maintenance  during  2001\u20132005,  which  met  the  standards  in  Box  A7.  The \nmaintenance  expenditures  exceeded  the  growth  rate  of  the  road  network  and  the  road \nmaintenance fee revenue, which means a net increase in the average maintenance expenditure \nper kilometer. In Gansu, roads with heavy traffic are receiving priorities for maintenance.  \n \n\nTable A7.1: Existing Road Network and Road Maintenance Financing in Gansu \n\n \n\nIndicator \n \n1.

The road maintenance fee is the main dedicated channel to \ncore  road  network  maintenance.  Although  maintenance  is  generally  adequate  for  highways, \nthere  is  an  overall  shortage  of  maintenance  funds  in  Gansu,  particularly  for  the  lower  class \nroads  (class-IV  and  below).  It  is  important  to  (i)  get  a  strong  commitment  from  provincial  and \nlocal  governments,  (ii)  ensure  the  timely  and  adequate  fund  allocation  for  rural  road \nmaintenance,  and  (iii)  utilize  the  limited  funds  more  effectively  by  adopting  competitive \napproaches  to  reduce  the  whole  life-cycle  cost  of  rural  road  maintenance.  The  Project  will \n(i) strengthen local road authorities\u2019 capacity by developing rural road maintenance manual and \nproviding on-the-job training, and (ii) encourage contracting out rural road maintenance to small-\nscale  or  community  contractors  through  clear  and  transparent  procurement  procedures  and  a \ngood monitoring system. Standard bidding documents will be developed under the Project. \n \n4. \nPolicy Framework. In 2005, the People\u2019s Republic of China State Council launched the \nPolicy  Reform  for  Rural  Road  Maintenance.  Under  the  new  policy,  construction  and \nmaintenance of rural roads will be of equal importance. Key points are summarized in Box A7. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n37 \n\nBox A7: State Council Rural Road Policy Framework (issued on 22 October 2005) \n\nDefining the roles and major responsibilities. \nCounty governments are responsible for rural road development and maintenance. \nProvincial governments will be mainly responsible for funding and supervision. \nProviding adequate funding for the rural roads maintenance. \nRoad maintenance shall receive a major share (typically not less than 80%) of the annual \u201croad maintenance \nfee\u201d. The central government funds will be allocated to prop the funding ability of local governments in the \nwest. \nImposing a minimum level of funding for rural road maintenance. \nThe allocation level shall not be lower than CNY7,000 per km per annum for county roads, CNY3,500 per km \nper annum for township roads, and CNY1,000 per km per annum for village roads. \nIntroducing \u201crewarding instead of subsidizing\u201d criteria for funding allocation. \nCentral government will allocate funds on the need-based (towards the west region). Performance indicators \nand proper conditionalities will be adopted. \nAdopting more rigorous financial discipline. \nUsing reimbursement procedure in lieu of biannual appropriation to provinces. \nPromote community consultations and disclosure of monitoring results to communities. \nIntroducing market-oriented mechanism. \nIntroduce public bidding system, and cross-border participation is encouraged. \n\n\u2022 \n \n \n\u2022 \n \n \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Ministry of Communications. \n\n \n5. \nRural  Road  Maintenance  Plan.  There  is  a  need  to  turn  the  State  Council  policy  into \nofficial  regulations  to  provide  a  firm  basis  for  their  adoption.  The  policy  dialogue  about \nmaintenance  with  Gansu  Provincial  Communications  Department  (GPCD)  during  project \npreparation  helped  raise  awareness,  and  GPCD  has  prepared  a  rural  road  maintenance \nregulation  and  submitted  to  Gansu  provincial  government  for  approval.  In  addition,  GPCD \nagreed  to  implement  a  rural  road  maintenance  plan  prepared  during  project  preparation  to \nstrengthen rural road maintenance (Table A7.2). \n \n\nTable A7.2: Rural Road Maintenance Plan \n\n \n\nActivities \nCore rural road \nnetwork \n\nRequirements and Current Progress \n\nDevelop a functional core rural road network plan (started and work is ongoing). \nEstablish a maintenance management system (work is ongoing). \nConduct road condition survey and traffic counts to prepare cost (work is ongoing). \nPrepare maintenance master plan and assign a sub-network manager per each road.  \nPrioritize and bring core network to all weather standards. \nCarry out preventive maintenance according to annual maintenance plan. \nStrengthen contract administration, quality assurance, monitoring and supervision  \nStrengthen road safety and auditing. \n\n \n\n \n\nNon-core rural road \nnetwork \n\nDevelop a sustainable framework for non-core rural road network. \nProvide technical advice to local communities and small maintenance companies. \nProvide basic materials and equipment to local communities and companies. \nIntroduce preventive maintenance mechanism. \n\nCapacity Building \n\nFinancing \n\nAssign a communications college to carry out and conduct on-the-job training. \nDevelop rural road maintenance manual and on-the-job training by small contractors. \n \nPromulgate rural road maintenance regulation in line with the national policy. \nAdopt appropriate rules for access to and use of the maintenance funds. \nTap nongovernment sources and local community participation. \nImprove the efficiency of use of funds and effective monitoring and auditing. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n \n\n \n\u2022 \n \n \n\u2022 \n \n\n\u2022 \n \n\n\u2022 \n \n\n \n\n\fItem   \n\nA.\n\nBase Costc\n1.

section  of  the \nLanzhou\u2013Haikou  artery,  one  of  the  nine  north-south  corridors  of  the  National  Expressway \nNetwork in the People\u2019s Republic of China. The planned transport corridor starts from Lanzhou, \nruns through Lintao, Minxian, Wudu, and Guanzigou in Gansu province, then reaches Sichuan \nprovince to connect Chengdu and Chongqing, and ends at Haikou in Hainan province. This will \nform the shortest route between Lanzhou (capital of Gansu) and Chengdu (capital of Sichuan) \nand Chongqing municipalities in the western People\u2019s Republic of China. \n \n2. \nIn Gansu, the Lanzhou\u2013Lintao section is already open to traffic. The remaining sections \nfrom Lintao\u2013Guanzigou will be constructed in three phases: Lintao\u2013Minxian (156 kilometer [km]), \nMinxian\u2013Wudu  (159  km)  and  WuGuan  (134  km).  Considering  the  existing  and  future \nconnectivity of road network, the WuGuan section is given the priority to construct to meet the \nneeds of the corridor in most economical way. Road conditions between Wudu to Tianshui (via \nPH206 and NH316) and Tianshui to Lanzhou (NH45) are in general good condition (Map 2). In \nSichuan, WuGuan section will connect to the planned expressway of Guanzigou to Guangyuan \n(56  km,  target  completion:  2012).  The  other  expressways  from  Guangyuan  further  south  in \nSichuan  are  either  under  construction  or  already  completed  (Map  1).  The  main  section  of \nChongqing  to  Beihai  (seaport  in  Guangxi)  will  be  completed  by  2010.  Therefore,  upon \ncompletion of the expressway, local people along the expressway will be connected to all main \ncities of Lanzhou, Xi\u2019an, Chongqing and Chengdu by class-II and above highways. \n \nThe project expressway will be built in parallel to existing national highway (NH212) and \n3. \nprovincial highway (PH206). NH212, built in 1958 with a combination of classes-II\u2013III and below \nstandards, is in very poor condition. The length of NH212 from Wudu to Guanzigou is 270 km. \nAll traffic takes a more roundabout route through the mountains, which increases the distance \nand  slows  down  the  average  speed  driven.  The  existing  PH206,  built  in  1957,  is  below  even \nclass-IV standard, with steep slopes and sharp turns, resulting in a high safety risks. In addition, \nan unreliable ferry crossing over Bailong River is not always passable. NH212 and PH206 have \nbecome transport bottlenecks between project area and Sichuan province, impeding exchanges \nof people and goods. The proposed expressway with the total length of 134 km, will reduce the \ntrip  length  from  Wudu  to  Guanzigou  by  136  km,  and  resulting  of  time  savings  of  at  least  5  to \n7 hours. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nFuture  traffic  on  WuGuan  was  based  on  routine  traffic  counts  and  the  comprehensive \norigin  and  destination  (O&D)  surveys  that  were  made  in  May  and  June  2005  at  eight \nobservation stations under the feasibility study. These survey stations were located on NH212, \nPR206  and  other  roads  in  the  project  area.  The  traffic  demand  was  projected  separately  for \nfreight and passenger on the basis of expected increases in population, gross domestic product \n(GDP) and vehicle ownership. GDP growth rates were projected to be 9%, 8%, and 7% for the \nperiods  of  2005\u20132012,  2012\u20132022,  and  2022\u20132032,  respectively.  The  average  demand \nelasticity was 1.1 for passengers and 0.9 for freight. \n \nThe traffic forecasts allow for potential generated and diverted traffic as a result of (i) the \n5. \nadditional traffic generated by the Project through the lower cost of expressway travel; (ii) traffic \ndiverted from the existing rail network from Lanzhou\u2013Baoji\u2013Chengdu because it is already run \nover its capacity; and (iii) potential divert traffic from other road corridors. The traffic projection \nalso takes account of non-modeled local intra zone traffic on the road network. \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n45 \n\n \n6. \nAssignment of traffic was made between every pair of traffic zones. The choice of route \nwithin  the  network  was  based  on  their  perceptions  of  generalized  travel  costs,  a  function  of \ntravel time, distance and associated toll cost, affected by road conditions and traffic congestion. \nWithout  the  Project,  the  existing  roads  will  be  very  congested  in  2012,  resulting  in  expensive \ntravel. With the Project, there will be significant improvement in terms of the performance and \nefficiency of the corridor. It will attract significant vehicle trips, especially of through traffic from \nother  road  corridors,  which  will  reduce  the  number  of  accidents,  vehicle  operating  costs,  and \ntravel time on these roads and thereby directly benefit the project area. \n \nThe  diverted  traffic  from  existing  roads  has  been  calculated  using  Asian  Development \n7. \nBank Toll Diversion Model. Depending on the trip length, 35% to 96% of traffic will divert to the \nproject expressway. The higher diversion is for trips of over 200 km. Generated traffic, arising \nfrom  the  lower  cost  of  expressway  travel,  will  be  related  to  the  decrease  in  cost  by  price \nelasticity. Generated traffic was computed to be 12% for passenger and 9% for freight. Diverted \ntraffic from the railway and other road corridors was assumed at 8% for passenger and 5% for \nfreight. \n \nThe  resulting  traffic  projection  is  given  in  Table  A12  for  the  project  expressway.  The \n8. \nforecast traffic volume on the expressway is expected to grow from average of 5,500 passenger \ncar  units  (pcu)  in  2012  to  an  average  of  11,200  pcu  in  2022,  a  7.4%  average  annual  growth \nrate.  It  will  then  grow  more  slowly  at  7.2%  per  annum  thereafter  to  reach  an  average  of \n22,500 passenger car units in 2032.  \n \n\nTable A12: Average Annual Daily Traffic of Project Expressway \n\n(passenger car units) \n\n \n\n \nRoad Section \n\nShawan\u2013Liangshui \nLiangshui\u2013Wudu \nWudu\u2013Hanwang \nHanwang\u2013Da\u00e1nmiao \nDa\u00e1nmiao\u2013Pipa \nPipa\u2013Luotang \nLuotang\u2013Yujiawan \nYujiawan\u2013Guanzigou \nWeighted Average \n\nGrowth \nRate (%) \n\nGrowth \nRate (%) \n\n \n2012 \n\n8,257 \n14,390 \n8,575 \n6,246 \n5,313 \n3,833 \n3,698 \n4,844 \n5,500 \n\n \n2022 \n\n15,699 \n28,547 \n17,610 \n12,383 \n10,751 \n8,003 \n7,720 \n9,970 \n11,200 \n\n6.6 \n7.1 \n7.5 \n7.1 \n7.3 \n7.6 \n7.6 \n7.5 \n7.4 \n\n \n2032 \n\n29,978 \n54,227 \n36,564 \n26,889 \n21,547 \n16,544 \n16,006 \n21,671 \n22,500 \n\n6.7 \n6.6 \n7.6 \n8.1 \n7.2 \n7.5 \n7.6 \n8.1 \n7.2 \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank and technical assistance consultants estimates. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n \n1. \nGeneral.  The  Project  comprises  a  134-kilometer  (km),  access-controlled  expressway \nbetween Wudu and Guanzigou, upgrading of seven rural roads of total 357 km that connect to \nthe  expressway  through  the  road  network  system,  and  200  township  bus  stations.  The \neconomic analysis incorporates a 5-year implementation period and a 20-year operating period. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the  Project  was  estimated  by  comparing  the \nsituation with and without the Project. Without the Project, traffic will continue to use the existing \nroad  network,  national  highway  (NH212)  and  provincial  highway  (PH206,  which  will  be  more \ncongested  and  expensive  to  maintain  due  to  rapidly  increasing  volume  of  traffic.  Some  travel \nmay  not  take  place  because  of  the  congestion  and  the  resulting  increasing  travel  time  and \nvehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs).  With  the  Project,  traffic  will  benefit  from  faster,  cheaper,  and \nsafer travel due to the rapidly reducing of congestion. Some additional trips will be generated as \nthe  economy  responds  to  lower  transport  costs  and  better  services.  There  will  also  be  some \ndiversion  of  traffic  from  existing  rail  services  in  the  corridor,  mainly  for  fresh  and  consumer \ngoods. \n \n2. \nExpressway  Component.  Economic  evaluation  was  undertaken  using  2006  prices, \nwhich  expressed  in  CNY  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire  with  a  shadow  exchange  rate \nfactor of 1.013 for foreign exchange effects. A shadow price was used to put an economic value \non  the  wages  paid  to  unskilled  labor,  but  not  on  the  wage  paid  to  skilled  labor,  because  no \nskilled  worker  surplus  exists.  A  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.67  was  used  to  convert  the \nfinancial  wage  rate  to  an  economic  opportunity  cost  of  labor.  The  economic  costs  of  the \nexpressway  include  (i)  the  capital  cost,  including  physical  contingence,  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement,  and  environmental  mitigation  costs;  and  (ii)  the  costs  of  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  the  expressway,  including  the  costs  of  replacing  depreciated  equipment. \nThe land acquisition and resettlement costs were based on their opportunity costs, that is, the \nagricultural output forgone and the re-siting of displaced activities. \n \n3. \nThe  economic  benefits  include  (i)  savings  in  VOCs  resulting  from  the  reduced  travel \ndistance  and  improved  road  conditions;  (ii)  savings  in  the  value  of  passenger  time  and  freight \ntied  up  in  transit;  (iii)  savings  resulting  from  fewer  accidents;  (iv)  benefits  to  generated  traffic; \nand (v) savings in capital and O&M costs for NH212. \n \n4. \nThe  project  expressway  will  shorten  the  route  by  136  km.  The  calculations  of  VOC \nsavings allow for differences in roughness, terrain, speed, and congestion, and also allow for a \nchanging vehicle mix for both passenger and freight vehicles and improvements in the vehicle \nperformance. Travel time savings are valued for passengers in vehicles only as the time of crew \nmembers  is  valued  in  the  VOCs.  The  values  used  per  person  hour  are  CNY6.93  for  car \npassengers and CNY1.04 for bus passengers. The economic costs of accidents are estimated \nin terms of direct property damage and forgone income on the basis of national data for 2005. \nThe  average  direct  cost  of  an  accident  is  estimated  at  CNY35,800  on  expressways, \nCNY34,800 on class-II roads, CNY32,800 on class-III roads, and CNY28,500 on class-IV roads. \nThe benefits to generated traffic are estimated at half the VOC and time savings of normal traffic \nas a proxy for willingness to pay. In addition, savings in capital and O&M costs for NH212 and \nPH206 are calculated on the basis of maintaining a volume-to-capacity ratio of 1.0 without the \nProject. The EIRR for the expressway component was estimated at 17.5%, indicating that the \nProject is economically viable, with a net present value of CNY5,161.5 billion. \n \n5. \nRural Road Component. The rural roads for upgrading under the Project were chosen \nbased  on  the  effect  on  overall  road  network  efficiency  and  cost-benefit  analysis,  economic \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n47 \n\ndevelopment  potential  and  population  density.  The  rural  road  costs  include  capital  cost  and \nO&M  costs.  The  principal  benefits  of  the  rural  road  improvement  were  identified  as  (i)  VOC \nsavings, (ii) benefits to generated traffic, and (iii) savings in O&M costs. The seven rural roads \nhave a combined EIRR of 23% per annum with a net present value of CNY285.6 million. \n \n6. \nRural  Transport  Service  Component.  Economic  benefits  of  rural  transport  service \ninclude: (i) time savings, (ii) economic output from the economic and social activities that would \nbe  foregone  due  to  the  loss  of  passenger  travels  resulting  from  unpredictable  bus  schedules \nand/or  poor  weather  conditions,  (iii)  economic  output  of  the  generated  traffic  resulting  from \nimproved  passenger  transport  services,  and  (iv)  traffic  accident  cost  savings.  In  addition,  the \nimproved  transport  services  are  expected  to  generate  substantial  social  values  in  the  form  of \nbroadened socioeconomic opportunities for the rural people. Without the Project, lack of efficient \ntransport  services  causes  produce  spoilage,  delay  of  freight  delivery,  labor  unemployed,  road \naccident,  and  lower  school  attendance.  The  results  from  pilot  projects  undertaken  in  Gansu \nsince 2003 provide strong empirical evidence to support the social and economic justifications \nfor the provision of township bus stations to the rural poor (Appendix 4). \n \n7. \nThe  Whole  Project.  The  Project  as  a  whole  generates  an  estimated  EIRR  of  17.9% \n(Table  A13.1).  The  VOC  savings  from  the  expressway  are  the  major  economic  benefit  (75%) \nfollowed by passenger time savings (13%). Avoided accident costs, savings to generated traffic, \nand other benefits are all relatively small. The benefits of the rural roads, while important to the \nvillages concerned, account for 3.8% of the total benefits. \n \n8. \nThe  results  of  sensitivity  analysis  confirm  the  robustness  of  the  project\u2019s  economic \nviability:  changes  in  the  key  variables\u2014construction  costs,  1-year  delay  in  completion,  and \nbenefits do not significantly affect the economic viability (Table A13.2). The capital cost would \nhave to be 68% higher than estimated for the EIRR to fall to the cutoff rate of 12%. Considering \nthe experience of Asian Development Bank in the People\u2019s Republic of China, such an increase \nin  capital  cost  is  unlikely.  Asian  Development  Bank-financed  road  projects  in  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China have not encountered major cost overruns. \n \n9. \nA  risk  analysis  was  carried  out  to  determine  the  degree  of  uncertainty  on  the  Project. \nEach uncertainty factor (such as capital cost, traffic growth, gross domestic product growth, etc.) \nwas  varied  at  random  within  defined  limits.  The  results  of  the  risk  analysis  showed  with  these \nuncertainties,  that  the  (i)  expected  EIRR,  based  on  the  weighted  average  of  all  simulated \ncombination  is  15.2%  about  2.7%  lower  than  the  base  case  EIRR  of  17.9%  (without \nconsideration of risks); (ii) EIRR associated with assumed probabilities range from a minimum of \n11.9% to a maximum of 17.7%; and (iii) the probability of the EIRR to be below 12% is 6.1%. \n \n10. \nThe economic analysis of the Project was extended to analyze distribution of project net \nbenefits by determining the project effects for various beneficiaries, including road users, labor, \nand  local  economy.  It  was  found  that  road  users  will  receive  the  largest  share  of  net  benefit, \naccounting  for  93%  (65%  for  passenger  traffic  and  28%  for  freight  traffic)  of  the  total  net \nbenefits. \n \n\n \n\n\fTable A13.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n(constant 2006 economic prices, domestic numeraire, CNY million) \n\nTotal \nCost \n\nVOC \nCost \nSavings \n\n \nTime \nSavings \n\n \nAccident \nSavings \n\n \nGenerate \nTraffic \n\n \nFreight \nSavings \n\n \nRail \nDiversion \n\n \nRural \nRoads \n\n \nTotal \nBenefits \n\n \nNet \nBenefits \n\n4\n8\n \n\n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n3\n \n\ni\n\nYear  Without \nProject \nCost \n\n \n\n \n\n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n2029 \n2030 \n2031 \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n38.5 \n38.5 \n40.4 \n42.5 \n44.6 \n46.9 \n49.3 \n51.8 \n54.4 \n57.2 \n58.0 \n58.9 \n59.9 \n60.9 \n61.9 \n63.0 \n64.2 \n65.4 \n66.6 \n68.0 \n69.4 \n\nWith Project Costs \n\nCapital \n\n932.2  \n2,627.6  \n2,202.5  \n2,054.6  \n2,005.4  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nO&M  Rural \nRoads \n93.5  \n70.1  \n46.8  \n11.7  \n11.7  \n1.8  \n1.8  \n1.9  \n1.9  \n2.0  \n2.0  \n2.1  \n2.2  \n2.2  \n2.3  \n2.4  \n2.4  \n2.5  \n2.6  \n2.7  \n2.7  \n2.8  \n2.9  \n3.0  \n3.1  \n3.2  \n\n  43.2 \n  43.2 \n  44.2 \n  45.2 \n  46.3 \n  47.4 \n  48.5 \n  49.7 \n  50.9 \n  52.1 \n  53.4 \n182.6   54.7 \n  56.0 \n  57.4 \n  58.9 \n  60.4 \n  61.9 \n  63.5 \n  65.1 \n  66.8 \n(6,069.12)  68.5 \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nBus \nStations \n32.0 \n24.0 \n16.0 \n4.0 \n4.0 \n5.0 \n5.0 \n5.2 \n5.3 \n5.5 \n5.6 \n5.8 \n6.0 \n6.1 \n6.3 \n6.5 \n6.7 \n6.9 \n7.1 \n7.3 \n7.6 \n7.8 \n8.0 \n8.3 \n8.5 \n8.8 \n\n \n \n\n1,057.7 \n2,721.8 \n2,265.3 \n2,070.3 \n2,021.1 \n11.5 \n11.5 \n10.8 \n10.0 \n9.1 \n8.2 \n7.1 \n6.0 \n4.8 \n3.6 \n4.2 \n187.5 \n5.6 \n6.3 \n7.0 \n7.7 \n8.3 \n9.0 \n9.7 \n0.4 \n(6,058.0) \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n1,075.6 \n1,075.6 \n1,193.1 \n1,323.4 \n1,467.8 \n1,628.0 \n1,805.5 \n2,002.4 \n 2,220.6 \n2,462.5 \n2,730.8 \n2,960.2 \n3,208.8 \n3,478.4 \n3,770.5 \n4,087.2 \n 4,430.4 \n4,802.5 \n5,205.7 \n5,642.8 \n6,116.5 \n \n \n\n( ) = negative, O&M = operation and maintenance, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and technical assistance consultants estimates. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n178.4 \n178.4 \n200.3 \n224.8 \n252.3 \n283.1 \n317.6 \n356.1 \n399.3 \n447.5 \n501.5 \n542.5 \n586.7 \n634.2 \n685.3 \n740.1 \n798.9 \n862.1 \n929.7 \n1,002.1 \n1,079.5 \n \n \n\n \n35.2  \n35.2  \n38.0  \n41.0  \n44.3  \n47.8  \n51.6  \n55.7  \n60.1  \n64.9  \n70.0  \n74.9  \n80.1  \n85.7  \n91.6  \n98.0  \n104.7  \n112.0  \n119.8  \n128.1  \n137.0  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n30.0 \n30.0 \n32.9 \n36.1 \n39.6 \n43.4 \n47.6 \n52.3 \n57.3 \n62.9 \n69.0 \n73.6 \n78.5 \n83.7 \n89.3 \n95.2 \n101.6 \n108.3 \n115.6 \n123.3 \n131.5 \n\n \n4.6 \n4.6 \n5.4 \n6.3 \n7.4 \n8.6 \n10.0 \n11.7 \n13.7 \n16.0 \n18.6 \n20.9 \n23.5 \n26.4 \n29.6 \n33.2 \n37.2 \n41.7 \n46.7 \n52.3 \n58.6 \n\n \n68.4 \n68.4 \n72.9 \n77.6 \n82.6 \n88.0 \n93.7 \n99.8 \n106.3 \n113.2 \n118.3 \n126.5 \n135.4 \n144.9 \n155.0 \n165.9 \n177.5 \n189.9 \n203.2 \n217.4 \n233.2 \n\n \n82.1 \n82.1 \n86.1 \n90.4 \n94.8 \n99.4 \n104.3 \n109.4 \n114.8 \n120.4 \n126.4 \n133.7 \n140.5 \n147.6 \n155.0 \n162.9 \n171.1 \n179.7 \n188.8 \n198.3 \n211.0 \nEconomic Net Present Value \nEconomic Internal Rate of Return  \n\n \n1,474.3 \n1,474.3 \n1,628.7 \n1,799.6 \n1,988.8 \n2,198.3 \n2,430.4 \n2,687.4 \n2,972.1 \n3,287.5 \n3,634.6 \n3,932.4 \n4,253.5 \n4,600.8 \n4,976.3 \n5,382.4 \n5,821.5 \n6,296.2 \n6,809.4 \n7,364.2 \n7,967.1 \n\n(1,057.7) \n(2,721.8) \n(2,265.3) \n(2,070.3) \n(2,021.1) \n1,462.8  \n1,462.8  \n1,617.9  \n1,789.6  \n1,979.7  \n2,190.2  \n2,423.2  \n2,681.4  \n2,967.3  \n3,283.9  \n3,630.3  \n3,744.9  \n4,247.9  \n 4,594.5  \n4,969.3  \n5,374.7  \n 5,813.1  \n6,287.2  \n6,799.7  \n7,353.8  \n14,025.1  \n5,655.9 \n17.9% \n\nTable A13.2: Sensitivity Analysis \n\nScenario \n1.

Construction will be completed in 2011, and the first full \nyear  of  operation  will  be  2012.  The  assumed  foreign  and  local  inflation  rates  are  assumed  at \n1.9%  and  3%  during  the  projection  period.  The  initial  foreign  exchange  rate  used  for  2006  is \nCNY8.02  to  $1.  The  cost  estimates  are  presented  in  current  terms  taking  into  account  the \npotential impacts of domestic and international inflation.  \n \nB. \n \nOperating  revenues  from  tolls  are  projected  based  on  forecast  of  future  traffic  and  a \n2. \nbase  toll  rate  of  CNY0.35  per  passenger  car  per  kilometer  (km).  Corresponding  tolls  for  other \nvehicle types are CNY0.55 for a small bus or a light truck; CNY0.80 for a medium-sized bus or \ntruck; CNY1.25 for a large bus or truck; CNY1.60 for a light articulated truck; and CNY2.00 for a \ntrailer.1 In addition to expressway tolls, Gansu Provincial Communications Department (GPCD) \nproposes to impose tunnel toll rate of CNY3.0 per passenger car per km for tunnels over 1 km in \nlength.2 The toll rates are assumed to increase in current terms to keep up with inflation. There \nwould  be  no  real  increase  of  project  tolls  over  project  life  span.  The  main  purpose  of  the  toll \ncollection is to repay loans, not to maximize the financial rate of return on the entire investment. \nOther income (from fuel sales, rental income, etc.) amounts to 2% of toll revenue.  \n \nAnnual  incremental  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  are  calculated  based  on \n3. \n2006  prices  as  follows:  (i)  toll  operation  cost  totaled  an  estimated  CNY11.05  million  in  2012 \n(300 staff  members  with  annual  wages  of  CNY30,000  per  person,  and  other  administration \nexpenses).  Labor  costs  will  rise  at  a  growth  rate  of  4%  in  real  terms,  and  staff  number  will \nincrease  with  traffic  flows  using  an  elasticity  of  0.05;  (ii)  routine  maintenance  costs  are \nestimated at CNY80,000 per km per annum; and it will increase in line with traffic flows using an \nelasticity  of  0.3;  (iii)  tunnel  O&M  costs  account  for  about  50%  of  total  O&M  expenses  in  the \nopening year. Assumptions include: electricity costs at CNY0.50 per kilowatt hour; labor costs at \nCNY15,000  per  annum;  and  regular  maintenance  costs  at  CNY300,000  per  km;  and \n(iv) environmental monitoring costs at CNY800,000 per annum. All incremental O&M costs are \nprojected  to  increase  annually  in  line  with  domestic  inflation  rates.  In  addition,  periodic \nmaintenance cost would be required after 10 years of operation at a cost of CNY1.2 million per \nkm in 2006 prices. \n \n4. \nThe  Project  will  be  funded  at  39%  by  equity  or  grants,  61%  by  long-term  loans.  The \nBank of Communications (BOC) loan will be repayable over 25 years, including a 5-year grace \nperiod.  For  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  loan,  it  is  assumed  as  25-year  maturity, \nincluding a 5-year grace period, US dollar London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loan. In \naddition, there is 0.75% commitment fee. \n \nApplicable business taxes at a rate of 5.5% are charged on revenue. Corporate income \n5. \ntax at 15% is paid on income after deducting business taxes,3 depreciation and interest charges, \noperating expenses, and any prior year losses carried forward. \n\n                                                 \n1  Under the current Gansu provincial \u201cgreen passage\u201d regulations, to reduce the burden for the poor, local vehicles \ncarrying  fresh  agricultural  produce  or  livestock  are  exempted  from  tolls.  Poor  communities  will  benefit  from  the \nexemption. It is assumed that 10% of such vehicles are exempted from tolls.  \n\n2   It  is  consistent  with  current  practice  in  the  west  region  and  in  accordance  with  the  Toll  Road  Management \n\nRegulation announced by the State Council in September 2004. \n\n3  Concessionary rate applied for qualifying western region companies (including expressway companies). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n6. \nProjected financial statements are presented in Table A14.1. Despite the low profitability, \nthe forecast revenue under the base assumptions are sufficient to cover annual recurrent costs, \ndepreciation, debt repayments on the ADB and BOC loans from the expressway operation from \nthe six year of operation.  \n \nC. \n \n7. \nThe major assumptions used for calculation of financial internal rate of return (FIRR) are: \n(i) all calculations are made in 2006 prices, covering a period from 2007 to 2031; (ii) capital cost \ninclude  all  incremental  capital  expenditures  related  to  the  construction  and  equipment  for  the \nexpressway,  but  exclude  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction;  (iii)  O&M  costs \ninclude  all  annual  incremental  expenses  incurred  in  operating  the  expressway,  but  exclude \ndepreciation and debt repayment provisions; (iv) operating revenues from toll used in financial \nprojections are also adjusted to 2006 prices; and (v) the residual value equal to undepreciated \nvalue of capital investment is included as a benefit of the FIRR calculation. \n \nThe  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC),  after-tax,  in  real  terms  was \n8. \ncalculated  using  estimated  capital  mix  and  costs  of  funds.  Costs  have  been  considered  as \nfollows: (i) the applicable 10 year fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.6% is \nused for ADB debt, (ii) the estimated interest costs of 6.39% per annum is used for the domestic \nloan funds, and (iii) the cost of equity was assumed to be 8%. The cost of debt is also adjusted \nto reflect the impact of income tax of 15%. The nominal cost of debt is converted to the real cost \nof  debt  by  applying  domestic  and  international  average  inflation  rate  for  domestic  and  foreign \ncurrency denominated debt, respectively. \n \n9. \nThe  FIRR  for  the  Project,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  is  4.6%.  This  compares \nfavorably with the WACC, also computed at after-tax basis, of 3.4% (Table A14.2). The Project \nis  considered  both  financially  viable  and  sustainable.  The  sensitivity  of  the  project's  financial \nindicators to cost and revenue variations is shown in Table A14.3. \n \nC. \n \nThe  actual  revenue  and  expenditures  of  GPCD  during  the  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan \n10. \n(10th FYP, 2001\u20132005) and projected Eleventh Five Year Plan (11th FYP 2006\u20132010) are given \nin  Table  A14.4.  Over  the  10th  FYP,  the  expenditures  were  financed  by  vehicle  purchase  tax, \nMinistry of Communication\u2019s subsidy and provincial budget (50%), road maintenance fee (8%), \ntoll revenues (6%), transport service surcharges (12%), and bank loan (24%). New construction \naccounted about 70% of total revenue while maintenance expenditure accounted about 9% of \ntotal revenue.  \n \nBased on the budget forecasts, the financing of the Project will require about 8% of the \n11. \nprojected  annual  total  GPCD  revenue  during  the  11th  FYP.  This  ratio  indicates  the  total \ninvestment  cost  of  the  Project  constitutes  only  a  small  fraction  of  GPCD\u2019s  road  expenses. \nDuring  the  11th  FYP,  the  funds\u2019  allocation  is  expected  to  improve  with  the  new  construction \nbudget projected to remain at the same level (70%) while the maintenance will increase to about \n11% of the total revenue. GPCD has the capacity to mobilize sufficient counterpart funds for the \nconstruction  and  ensure  overall  sustainability  of  the  project  rural  roads  and  township  bus \nstations.  \n\nFinancial Evaluation of Gansu Provincial Communications Department  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nTable A14.1 Projected Financial Statements \n(CNY million) \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n2018 \n\n2019 \n\n2017 \n\n2015 \n\n2010 \n\n2009 \n\n2012 \n\n2013 \n\n2011 \n\n2007 \n\n2014 \n\n2008 \n\n2016 \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n \n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n \n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n \n13.4 \n\n848.0 \n14.2 \n48.2 \n814.0 \n69.0 \n343.2 \n452.0 \n21.0 \n0.0 \n(71.4) \n \n \n105.2 \n\n500.6 \n8.6 \n28.5 \n480.7 \n53.5 \n343.2 \n483.2 \n0.7 \n0.0 \n(407.0) \n \n \n14.1 \n\n604.9 \n10.4 \n34.4 \n580.8 \n59.2 \n343.2 \n476.3 \n16.8 \n0.0 \n(314.7) \n \n \n15.6 \n\n701.8 \n11.4 \n39.9 \n673.3 \n62.3 \n343.2 \n468.7 \n21.7 \n0.0 \n(222.7) \n \n \n16.4 \n\n771.4 \n12.5 \n43.9 \n740.1 \n65.6 \n343.2 \n460.6 \n22.3 \n0.0 \n(151.7) \n \n \n42.8 \n\nItem \n \nA.

Specifically,  the  project\u2019s \nlocal road component of 357 kilometer (km) and 200 township bus stations will help local people to break the transport \nbottleneck and, therefore, add economic values to their fruits, vegetables and animals that have been introduced by \nvarious  poverty  reduction  and  agricultural  development  programs.  Expressway  (especially  interchange  areas),  local \nroads  and  township  bus  stations  will  speed  up  the  development  of  mineral  and  tourism  resources,  and  facilitate  the \nformation of new local growth centers that will have greater impact on poverty reduction. \n \nB. \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nSocioeconomic  Profile.  With  a  per  capita  GDP  of  CNY6,135 (45%  of  the  national  average),  Gansu  ranked  30th \namong the 31 administrative areas. Annual per capita rural income in Gansu was CNY1,980, or 39% lower than the \nnational average of CNY3,255. Annual per capita rural income was CNY1,252 in Longnan, CNY1,326 in Tianshui and \nCNY1,590  in  Dingxi,  or  60%,  59%  and  51%  lower  than  the  national  average  of  CNY3,255.  The  incidence  of  rural \npoverty in Longnan, Tianshui and Dingxi are 42%, 29% and 38%, respectively, which indicates that project area is still \nan  economically  underdeveloped  area  in  the  PRC.  The  Project  will  benefit  2.7 million  people  in  Longnan  (focal \nprefecture  of  the  Project).  In  addition,  50  township  bus  stations  in  Dingxi  and  50 township  bus  stations  in  Tianshui \nprefectures will benefit additional nearly 2 million people (0.99 million in Tianshui and 0.95 million in Dingxi). In total, \nthe Project will benefit 4.6 million people, of whom 37% are poor.  \n \nSocial  Benefits.  It  is  estimated  that  total  56,000  person-years  of  unskilled  jobs  will  be  created  during  the  project \nconstruction and each worker is estimated to earn CNY6,000 per year assuming one worker works 300 days/year and \nearn  CNY20/day,  which  is  4.6  times  higher  than  average  annual  income  per  capita  in  the  Project  impact  areas \n(CNY1,300).  Overy  60%  of  the  jobs  will  be  filled  up  by  the  poor  with  an  estimated  total  of  CNY200  million  in  wage \npayment annually during construction. Using local materials for the project construction will contribute CNY200 million. \nThe Project will also create 1,700 full time jobs in which CNY15 million of wage payments will be received annually by \nthe  poor  during  operation.  In  addition,  the  estimated  tax  revenue  from  the  expressway  construction  to  the  local \ngovernments is CNY248 million. This additional revenue will be  used for poverty reduction and social activities,  with \nspecial attention to resettlement affected groups, women, and other vulnerable people in the region.  \n \nImproved  Rural  Road  Conditions  at  Township  Level.  In  Longnan,  there  are  total  11,297  km  of  roads,  of  which \n8,893 km (79%) are unclassified, The Project will improve 357 km rural roads from unclassified standard to classes-\nIII\u2013IV  standard,  of  which  99  km  in  Wudu  district,  28  km  in  Wengxian  county,  33 km  in  Kangxian  county,  72  km  in \nChengxian county, and 125 km in Lixian county. It is estimated that 763,000 people of poor will benefit from it. \n \nImproved  Access  to  Other  Off-farm  Opportunities.  The  project  road  area  is  rich  in  minerals  (lead,  zinc,  and \nvanadium),  agricultural  products,  forestry,  livestock,  hydropower  generation,  and  tourism  resources.  Longnan  and \nTianshui are hot tourists areas, had attracted over 2 millions tourists in 2005. The number of registered small business \nin Longnan is 27,232 (51% in rural area) in 2004 and it is expected to increase by 20% at project completion.  \n \nImproved  Rural  Transport  Services.  Currently,  there  are  13  inter-provincial  bus  routes  and  85  inter-county  bus \nroutes in Longnan. Most of rural people travel to the township center for marketing, shopping, schooling and accessing \nto the hospital. It is expected to increase by 1.5 times more bus routes for inter-provincial and 2 times more bus routes \nfor inter-county after the project completion. At present, the travel times from Wudu are 10 hours to Lanzhou, 12 hours \nto Xi\u2019an or Chengdu, and 16 hours to Chongqing. It is expected to be half of travel times upon project completion. \n \nC. \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nRural and urban population, bus passengers (long distance and inter- and intra-county), transport operators (freight, \nbus,  and  drivers),  enterprises  (industry,  tourism,  and  traders),  and  local  government  are  identified  as  the  project \nstakeholders. Positive and negative effects to these groups caused by the Project were analyzed by the social survey. \nOver 5,000 people from different stakeholders were consulted during the project preparatory stage. \n \n\nParticipation Process \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f55 \n\n No \n\n Yes  \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nGender Development  \n\n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nBefore  the  alignment  was  finalized,  local  government  and  communities  were  consulted  to  minimize  losses  of  high \nquality arable land. The local people will have an opportunity to participate in the Project. It is estimated that the total \n62 million  unskilled  worker-days  is  required  under  the  Project\u201461,568,982  worker  days  for  the  expressway \nconstruction based on the feasibility study estimates and another 1,700 full-time jobs during operation.  \n \nD. \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:  \n \nAll participants interviewed during social surveys know the HIV/AIDS and 70% of them know some of the preventative \nmeasures. The Project will facilitate women to make more trips and save their travel time. Gansu already has a high \nrate of women involved in road construction and maintenance activities since they prefer local work to going outside. \nThe Project owner  will encourage contractors to provide equal opportunities for  women. For example, about 60% of \nwomen will be engaged for the landscaping work.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nEmployment  quota  of  women  under  the  project  construction  is  agreed  with  the  Executing  Agency  and  included  in \nrelevant sections of the RRP, the Social Development Action Plan, and loan covenant.  \n \nE. \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\nItem \n\n \n \nResettlement \n  \n\n \n \nAffordability  \n \n\n \n \nLabor \n \n\n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n \n\n \nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfor \n\nlabor \n\ntransport  expenditure \n\nthe  poor \nfare  per  person  per  km \n\nA  full  resettlement  plan  (RP)  for  the  expressway  and  connector \nroads  and  a  short  RP  for  the  local  roads  and  bus  stations  have \nbeen prepared in accordance with the government regulations and \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement.

The  economy  is  mainly  supported  by  agriculture,  labor  migration, \nmineral  extraction,  and  hydropower  generation.  Presently,  it  takes  10\u201316  hours  to  reach \nLanzhou,  Xi\u2019an,  Chengdu  and  Chongqing  due  to  poor  roads  condition. 1  At  present,  It  is \nextremely  difficult  to  trade  with  larger  markets  at  a  competitive  price  (transportation  cost  and \ndelivery  time  are  high).  The  transport  bottleneck  has  been  a  major  barrier  for  both  large  and \nsmall businesses development. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  provide  better  link  to  regional  central  markets  (Lanzhou,  Xi\u2019an, \nChongqing and Chengdu), which creates opportunities for local people to expand and start local \nproduce  export-oriented  processing  and  trading.  It  is  expected  that  the  local  produce  export-\noriented  processing  and  trading  business  will  also  increase  by  20%  in  about  5  years  after \nconstruction completion. The Project will result in a booming development of tourism industry.2 \nIn  response  to  this  booming  growth,  there  will  be  high  demand  for  provision  of  services  of \nvarious  types,  including  catering,  handcraft  production  and  trade,  and  local  transport,  etc.  All \ntogether, the Project will result in an overall 25% growth of small business in the project area by \n2015. Such a growth will benefit about 50,000 labors and their families. \n \n3. \nThe project area has potential for the small business to grow rapidly. Proposed initiatives \nto  further  develop  small  business  and  commercial  activities  are  given  in  Box  A17.  These \ninitiatives will be implemented by local government, in cooperation with local road authorities.  \n \n\nBox A17: Proposed Initiatives to Develop Small Business in the Region \n\n \n\u2022 \n\u2022  Establish permanent markets at township level near the township bus stations (direct project \n\nImprove road conditions from village to townships (direct project component). \n\ncomponent). \n\n\u2022  Establish small business incubator at expressway service areas and interchanges along rural \n\nroads and next to township bus stations.  \n\n\u2022  Promote local tourist spots and restaurants along the expressways and local roads by \n\nadvertising on road maps, billboards, and signs to attract more visitors. \n\u2022  Ease the restriction and barriers for farmers to access the micro-credit. \n\u2022  Provide legal advice, trainings, access to capital, and business licenses to form the farmer\u2019s \n\ncooperatives.  \n\n\u2022  Enhance credit services with technical trainings.  \n\u2022 \n\nInvolve local educational institution for community economic development. Government will \ncreate the partnership program between educational institutions and local community.  \n\n\u2022  Disseminate information on procedures to start-up businesses in cooperation with \n\nnongovernment entities and educational institutions. \n\n \nSources: Gansu Provincial Communications Department and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n                                                 \n1   Certain sections of National Highway 212 are almost impassable at present. \n2  Longnan has received 147,200 tourists during the 7-day holiday during 1\u20137 May 2006, a 121% increase over that \nof  the  same  period  of  2005.  Also,  Wenxian  County  is  directly  connected  with  the  Jiuzhaigou  National  Nature \nReserve Park in Sichuan Province.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 18 \n\n59 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n\n \n1. \nOne  resettlement  plan  addresses  impacts  caused  by  the  expressway  component, \nincluding  connector  roads,  based  on  the  project  feasibility  study.  Another  resettlement  plan \naddresses  the  relatively  small  impacts  caused  by  the  rural  road  upgrading  program  and  the \nconstruction  of  200 township  bus  stations.  Prior  to  commencement  of  land  acquisition,  Gansu \nProvincial  Communications  Department  (GPCD)  will  update  both  resettlement  plans  based  on \ndetailed measurement survey and submit them to Asian Development Bank (ADB) for approval. \nDuring project construction, if there is significant material change in project scope or other causes, \nthe resettlement plans will be revised, disclosed to affected persons (APs) and submitted to ADB \nfor approval prior to commencement of such changes. \n\nThe  proposed  expressway  will  permanently  require  681  hectares  (ha)  of  land  of  which \n2. \n12% is non-irrigated farmland, 30% is irrigated farmland, 12% is orchard, 6% is housing plots, and \n40% is floodplain, shrub forest, grassland and wasteland. Another 33 ha of land is estimated to be \noccupied  temporarily  during  the  construction  phase.  Based  on  the  Chinese  standard  for  impact \nassessment, the equivalent of 2,834 persons would lose all their land and agricultural livelihoods. \nSince the expressway will actually cross many parcels of scattered farmland, it is estimated that \nthe  average  loss  of  land  per  household  would  be  33%,  which  means  the  number  of  partially \naffected people would be in the order of 8,500 persons (or about 2,070 households). Along with \nland acquisition, 15,130 square meters of houses will be demolished, necessitating relocation of \n151 rural households (621 persons), which is an average of 2 houses per village.  \n\n3. \nFor  the  upgrading  of  seven  rural  roads,  it  is  estimated  that  about  100  households  with \n400 persons  would  be  relocated  and  another  500  persons  would  be  partially  affected  by  land \nacquisition.  The  200  township  transport  centers  do  not  require  land  acquisition;  instead  they \nobtain  land  use  rights  for  existing  state-owned  construction  land  in  each  town.  Each  center  will \nrequire  1,000\u20131,500  m2  of  land,  for  a  total  of  26.6  ha;  these  sites  have  been  selected  and \nagreements  have  been  signed  between  the  Gansu  Transport  Administration  Bureau  and  each \ntownship government. \n\n4. \nFor  people  unavoidably  affected,  the  resettlement  objective  is  to  achieve  equal  or  better \nincome and living standards in line with the People\u2019s Republic of China Land Administration Law \n(1998), State Council Document No. 28, and the ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. The \nGPCD  will  ensure  that  any  people  losing  land,  housing,  other  assets  or  income  sources  will  be \nassisted  to  fully  restore  their  income  and  living  standards.  In  July  2005,  the  Gansu  provincial \ngovernment  issued  Decree  No.  48  which  stipulates  the  regulations  for  land  compensation, \nresettlement subsidies, young crop compensation, and other measures to carry out resettlement. \nAccording  to  the  policy  and  basic  socioeconomic  conditions  among  project  counties,  land \ncompensation  standards  have  been  established  based  on  16  times  the  average  annual  output \nvalue  (AAOV).  However,  the  AAOV  are  going  to  be  updated  based  on  detailed  survey,  so  the \nactual  compensation  rates  are  not  yet  finalized.  The  estimated  compensation  rates  in  Wudu \nDistrict  and  Wenxian  County  are  estimated  to  range  from  CNY13,000  to  22,300  per  mu  for \nirrigated  farmland;  CNY8,300  to  15,500  per  mu  for  dryland,  cash  forest,  floodplain  and  house \nplots,  CNY17,600  to  32,700  per  mu  for  vegetable  land,  CNY5,000  to  9,300  per  mu  for  shrub \nforest, CNY4,200 to 7,700 per mu for grassland and CNY1,000 for wasteland. If basic farmland is \nacquired, compensation will be calculated on the basis of 30 times AAOV. The land compensation \nrates  for  the  rural  roads  will  follow  the  same  compensation  principles.  Green  crops  will  be \ncompensated  based  on  0.5  times  AAOV.  Those  people  losing  land  temporarily  during \nconstruction will receive a payment equivalent to production value foregone for the period of loss, \nwhich is expected to be 2 years. The land used temporarily will also be restored by the contractor \nto  the  original  condition;  the  contractors  will  deposit  funds  with  Longnan  Land  and  Resources \nOffice to ensure this restoration is completed properly. \n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 18 \n\nFor  structures  to  be  demolished,  replacement  value  will  be  provided  to  the  affected \n5. \nhouseholds  based  on  compensation  rates  adopted  in  Longnan  which  range  from  CNY350  to \nCNY450 per square meter for brick-concrete structure, CNY250 to CNY350 per square meter for \nbrick-wood  structure,  and  CNY150  to  250  per  square  meter  for  earth-wood  structure.  The \nrelocation  will  provide  an  opportunity  to  improve  current  housing  conditions  for  relocated \nhouseholds. Most of these households will be moved a short distance to another site within their \noriginal  group  or  village.  Rural  housing  will  either  be  built  (i)  in  a  scattered  manner  beside \nroadways, or (ii) in a clustered manner close to existing settlements; all sites will be provided with \nwater  supply,  electricity,  telephone,  and  TV  cable.  There  will  be  no  reduction  in  house \ncompensation for depreciation, and people can salvage materials from their old houses.  \n\n6. \nGPCD  will  assume  the  overall  responsibility  for  implementing  resettlement  according  to \nthe approved resettlement plans. For the expressway component, a Resettlement Division within \nthe Gansu Changda Highway Company Limited (GCHC) will be directly responsible to coordinate \nthe planning, implementation, financing and reporting of land acquisition and resettlement for the \nexpressway  and  connector  roads.  A  resettlement  leading  group  and  resettlement  office  was \nestablished  in  Longnan  prefecture  on  21  February  2006.  Offices  will  also  be  set  up  in  Wudu \nDistrict and Wenxian County, and staff will be assigned in all affected townships and villages to \nimplement resettlement. The county land and resources offices will take the primary responsibility \nfor  the  resettlement  consultation,  implementation  and  timely  delivery  of  entitlements,  with \nassistance from townships and villages concerned. \n\n7. \nThe  1998  Land  Administration  Law  requires  disclosure  and  consultation  with  APs. \nAffected  villages  have  been  notified  about  the  key  elements  of  the  resettlement  plan  during \nmeetings  and  interviews.  Resettlement  information  was  disclosed  through  newspapers  to  all \naffected  persons  in  April  and  May  2006.  During  detailed  resettlement  planning,  there  will  be \nfurther notifications and consultations to discuss specific impacts and how they will be addressed. \nThe  county,  township and  village  officials  have ensured  that  any  concerns  raised  by  the  people \naffected will be quickly addressed. \n\n8. \nThe  plan  for  internal  and  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  is  included  in  both \nresettlement plans. The GCHC will engage a qualified domestic monitor to carry out independent \nresettlement monitoring and evaluation. The monitor will ascertain whether APs have (i) received \ntheir  full  entitlements  on  time;  and  (ii)  fully  restored  their  livelihoods,  income  levels,  and  living \nstandards.  The  monitor  will  conduct  a  baseline  survey  prior  to  resettlement,  semi-annual \ninvestigations during resettlement and annual survey updates for two years after the completion \nof  resettlement.  The  household  survey  will  include  a  representative  number  of  those  severely \naffected  by  loss  of  land,  those  losing  housing,  and  those  classified  as  economically  vulnerable. \nThe  monitor  will  provide  ADB  and  GPCD  with  copies  of  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  reports \ntwice a year during resettlement implementation, and once a year after resettlement completion \nfor at least 2 years.
