I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Second Power \nDistribution Enhancement Investment Program.1 \n \n2.  The  investment  program  aims to  improve  the financial  viability  of  Pakistan\u2019s  power \ndistribution sector. By introducing advanced metering infrastructure (AMI)2 to power distribution \ncompanies (DISCOs) throughout Pakistan, the investment program would (i) reduce power \ndistribution losses and improve revenue collection, (ii) reduce power outages by enhancing load \ncontrol and load management, (iii) provide automated power consumption data, (iv) modernize \nthe electricity metering and billing system, and (v) improve customer services by installing the \ncustomer  information  system  (CIS).  AMI  will  be  implemented  in  several  phases  to  cover \nPakistan\u2019s major cities, and industrial and commercial hubs.3  An MFF instead of a stand-alone \nproject  is  proposed  for  investment  because  the  introduction  of  AMI  requires  a  long-term \npartnership between the Government of Pakistan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and \nbeing a large-scale and complex investment, the government intends to implement it in phases \nand MFF has been accordingly designed in multiple tranches to cover different regions.4 \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Energy crisis. Reliable and sufficient electricity supply is the backbone for Pakistan\u2019s \neconomic growth. In the last 10 years, Pakistan has been suffering from electricity shortages, \nleaving 33% of the population without access to electricity, and load shedding of around 25% of \nsystem demand.5 While standby electricity amounted to about 30% in 2003\u20132004, the country \nnow suffers from a severe power crisis resulting in routine load shedding of up to 12 hours in \nurban areas, and 18\u201320 hours in rural areas.6 This is considered to be the worst of four such \nelectricity crises in Pakistan since 1974. It has hurt the country\u2019s economy, as reflected in an \nestimated annual loss of 4%\u20137% in the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), and a 2% \nreduction in real GDP growth. The power shortfall is also deemed to be the major cause of a \ndecline in large-scale manufacturing, which grew by just 1.2% in 2012 and 2.8% in 2013. \nDomestic private investment dropped from 14% of GDP in 2007\u20132008 to an estimated 10.9% of \nGDP in 2012\u20132013. Pakistan\u2019s economic growth slowed in 2013, resulting in a 5-year average \nof 3%, which is well below the 7% annual growth rate necessary for sufficient employment \ncreation to absorb the new entrants into the labor force. The power shortage is dampening \nbusiness confidence, which is already affected by the country\u2019s security situation. \n \n4.  Power distribution sector. The supply\u2013demand gap (5,000 megawatts) is attributed to \nincreased demand, insufficient generation, and system inefficiencies. DISCOs are contributing \nthe most to the inefficiency in delivering generated power. Their system efficiency and financial \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  AMI comprises systems that measure, collect, and analyze energy usage, and communicate with the metering \ndevices either on request or under a schedule. These systems include hardware, software, communication \nsystems, customer energy displays, customer associated systems, meter data management software. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance to develop the proposed \nSecond Power Distribution Enhancement Investment Program (TA 8410).  \n4  A matrix showing a comparison between different financing modalities is in Comparison of Multitranche Financing \nFacility and Project Loan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5  Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Planning, Development and Reforms. 2014. Pakistan Vision 2025. Islamabad. \n6  Government of Pakistan, National Electric Power Regulatory Authority. 2012. State of Industry Report 2012. \nIslamabad. \n ", "2 \nviability are critical to efficient operations and the sector\u2019s sustainability and growth. DISCOs\u2019 \ncustomer tariff does not cover the full cost of power distribution, transmission, and generation \nbecause  the  system  losses  are  higher  than  those  allowed  by  the  regulator  and  revenue \ncollection is low. The cash shortfall hampers DISCOs\u2019 performance, and payments to power-\ngenerating entities are delayed or subsidized by the government. This is not sustainable given \nthe fiscal impact. \n \n5.  Road map and strategic context. The government approved the National Power Policy \n2013 to alleviate the chronic energy crisis through short, medium-, and long-term measures. \nThe government has taken some measures to reduce electricity shortages by adding generation \ncapacity and removing some of the bottlenecks in transmission and distribution systems. The \ngovernment acknowledges the need to develop a long-term investment plan to resolve the \npower crisis, and to bring financial sustainability to the sector. While the policy focuses on the \nmost crippling effect of the crisis by reducing the supply\u2013demand gap, it also envisages reforms \nto make the power sector sustainable and financially viable. For the distribution subsector, the \ngoal of the policy is to improve the operational and financial efficiency of the distribution system. \nA key strategy is to deploy smart meters and real-time monitoring. Other key strategies are the \nexecution of performance contracts that compel the heads of DISCOs to focus on the reduction \nof distribution losses and, in the longer term, the privatization of DISCOs. \n \n6.  Investment plans for generation and transmission, and business plans for distribution \nsystem improvements have been prepared. The investment requirements are significant and \nbeyond the capacity of the country\u2019s development budget, requiring financing from outside. \nWhile ADB, the World Bank, and other bilateral development partners have been requested to \nfund some of these investments, the government itself is also utilizing its development funds \nand encouraging private sector investment to resolve the energy crisis. \n \n7.  Policy  framework.  The  government\u2019s  policy  framework,  Pakistan  Vision  2025, \ndeveloped by the Ministry of Planning, Development and Reforms, is aligned with the strategic \ncontext and recognizes that sufficient, reliable, clean, and cost-effective energy\u2014for now and \nthe future\u2014is indispensable to ensure sustainable economic growth and development. It aims to \n(i)  increase  new  power  generation  with  a  more  balanced  generation  mix,  (ii)  provide \nuninterrupted electricity to all, (iii) increase electricity access to 90% of the population by 2025, \nand (iv) improve demand management. \n \n8.  Pakistan Vision 2025\u2014backed by the National Power Policy, investment plans for power \ngeneration and transmission, and business plans for the distribution sector\u2014will be leading \nPakistan into resolving the power crises. The investment program is one of the key drivers for \nthe government to realize this. ADB, in close coordination with other international financial \ninstitutions and donors, is in continuous dialogue with the government on reforms required to \ncreate the right environment for sector stability, and has agreed on a policy matrix with the \ngovernment, which is being implemented in phases.7 The MFF will support the policy dialogue \nby providing effective tools and inputs to the following three objectives in the policy matrix \nagreed with the government: (i) loss reduction and  collection improvement in DISCOs, (ii) \nimproved demand-side efficiency and strengthened energy conservation, and (iii) improved \nperformance of public sector companies in the power sector. Similarly, the reform program will \ncreate the basis for  the benefits envisaged under the MFF through implementation of tariff \nregulation and subsidy reforms. \n \n                                                \n7 ADB. 2014. Sustainable Energy Sector Reform Program. Manila. \n ", "3 \n9.  ADB assistance and country partnership strategy.  ADB is the leading donor in the \nPakistan  energy  sector  and  provides  funds  for  energy  efficiency,  power  transmission  and \ndistribution,  cross-border  natural  gas  pipelines,  power  generation,  and  renewable  energy \nprojects.  ADB  has  been  engaged  in  program  lending  and  assisting  the  government  in \ndeveloping sector policies and strategies since 2000.8 ADB has supported the government\u2019s \nfocus on enhancing the power distribution and transmission system by upgrading, extending, \nand constructing new grid stations and transmission lines. The existing MFF9 for DISCOs has \nshown satisfactory results with no major implementation issues. ADB has approved all four \ntranches under that MFF, with one financially closed and three under implementation. About \n3,956 megavolt-amperes of transformer capacity and 115 kilometers of transmission lines have \nalready been added to the system through the existing MFF. While the existing MFF focuses on \nenhancements in the grid stations and transmission lines of DISCOs, the second MFF would be \na targeted intervention to secure the metering and billing systems of DISCOs. Support through \nsuch and other ADB interventions is being provided to make DISCOs financially self-sustaining \nwith a true cost-of-service tariff and a transparent multi-buyer\u2013multi-seller model. \n  \n10.  The investment program is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2015\u20132019 \nfor Pakistan, which names the energy sector as one of the key priority areas.10 The program is \nalso included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017, and is consistent with the \ndevelopment coordination framework.11 \n \n11.  Investment program. The government\u2019s sector investment strategy is to resolve the \nfollowing main issues: (i) low revenue collection from public and private customers, and high \nlosses in the distribution system (averaging 18.9% countrywide, and between 9.8% and 39.6% \namong  different  DISCOs);  (ii)  recurring  circular  debt  largely  stemming  from  low  revenue \ncollection;  (iii)  increasing  demand  stress  on  the  transmission  and  distribution  networks; \n(iv) overreliance on fuel imports and failure to exploit additional indigenous resources; (v) low \navailability and efficiency of existing power plants; and (vi) declining power generation from \ncheaper sources (hydro and natural gas). While some of the above issues are being dealt with \nthrough  existing  ADB  interventions,12 issues  (i)\u2013(iii)  will  be  tackled  through  the  investment \nprogram, which follows the government\u2019s strategy for the next 10 years and builds upon the \nexisting ADB MFF for power distribution. \n \n12.  The investment program, through installation of AMI and billing systems, would enhance \nthe operational efficiency of DISCOs, including loss reduction to a level that the regulator deems \nacceptable to be passed on in the tariff, an increase in revenue collection, and efficient use of \navailable power through demand-side management. With its theft-control technology, revenue-\ncollection  enforcement  options  (remote  disconnection  against  nonpayment)  and  load-\nmanagement capabilities, DISCOs would strategically resolve issues relating to high network \n                                                \n8  (i)  Power  Sector  Restructuring  Program  and  technical  assistance  loans,  approved  in  2000;  (ii)  Friends  of \nDemocratic Pakistan Energy Task Force Report, approved in 2010; and (iii) Sustainable Energy Reform Program \nand subprogram 1, approved in 2014. \n9  ADB. 2008.

Overall, \nthese would improve system stability and security, and the financial viability of DISCOs. \n \n13.  The Ministry of Water and Power (MOWP) intends to install AMI throughout the country \nin all major cities, and industrial and commercial hubs, and requested ADB in May 2013 to \nsupport its initiative. Investments worth $4.9 billion\u2014both physical and nonphysical (capacity \nbuilding)\u2014are required, and ADB has been requested to finance a portion of the government\u2019s \ninvestment plan. As part of the feasibility study for adopting AMI, an investment plan for the AMI \nrollout was developed and approved for the Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO) and \nLahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO) under tranche 1 of the investment program. Both \nDISCOs  will  seek  regulatory  approval  of  the  revised  integrated  distribution  business  plan, \nincluding AMI-related investments, within 1 year of project approval. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The  investment  program\u2019s  impact  will  be  improved  financial  viability  of  the  power \ndistribution  sector  in  Pakistan.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  electricity  revenues  in  the \ntargeted regions. The investment program will be implemented throughout Pakistan, covering \nmajor cities, and industrial and commercial hubs. \n \nC.  Outputs \n15.  The investment program will have four outputs: (i) smart meters and communication \nequipment installed and functional, (ii) meter data management system (MDMS) implemented \nand  operational,  (iii)  new  billing  system  and  CIS  implemented  and  operational,  and \n(iv) operations manual updated and monitoring procedure improved. The investment program \nwill improve (i) metering accuracy and reliability, anti-tampering, and fault detection; (ii) tariff \ncollection and billing efficiency; and (iii) load monitoring and management. Tranche 1 will have \nthe same outputs as the investment program, but only with regard to IESCO and LESCO. \n \n16.  AMI will be established in various DISCOs throughout Pakistan in four tranches under \nthe investment program, with the following components: \n(i)  Advance metering infrastructure and billing system. (a) Procurement and \ninstallation  of  smart  meters  and  associated  equipment  at  common  delivery \npoints, 11-kilovolt feeders, and distribution transformers for all customers; (b) \ndevelopment  of  communication  infrastructure;  and  (c)  installation  of  MDMS, \nupgrade of billing system, and CIS. \n(ii)  Capacity  development  of  DISCO  personnel.  Operator  personnel  and \nmanagement will receive training, from suppliers as well as consultants, to be \nable to operate and manage the system effectively. The information technology, \nmetering, and testing departments will be restructured in each DISCO. \n(iii)  Monitoring and updating of documents. Consultants will be hired to monitor \nthe physical progress of each of the program tranches and update the operation \nmanuals. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n17.  The overall financing need for installing AMI throughout the country is $4.9 billion. The \nMFF will finance a portion of this investment program worth $1.25 billion. Eligible expenditures \nwill include goods, works, and consulting services as more particularly described in the detailed \n ", "5 \ncost estimates in the FAM.  The MFF will have four tranches13 from 2015 to 2024. Proceeds of \nthe  loan  under  each tranche  will  be  relent  by  the government to  the  respective  DISCOs. \nTranche 1 is expected to be executed in 2015.

The government has requested an MFF in an amount up to $990 million from ADB's \nordinary capital resources (OCR) and Special Funds resources to help finance a part of the \ninvestment program. The MFF will consist of several tranches, subject to the government's \nsubmission of related periodic financing requests, execution of the related loan and project \nagreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings as set \nforth in the framework financing agreement. \n \n19.  The MFF combines OCR and Special Funds resources, i.e., Asian Development Fund \n(ADF) resources, up to the aggregate MFF amount. The provision of any ADF resources will be \nbalanced by a corresponding reduction in available OCR financing (and vice versa), with total \nfinancing provided under the MFF not to exceed the aggregate MFF total of $990 million. Any \nADF allocation will be subject to (i) the availability of ADF resources, (ii) Pakistan\u2019s access to \nsuch resources pursuant to ADB\u2019s then applicable Graduation Policy14 and the requirements of \nADF donors, and (iii) the availability of such resources to Pakistan given ADB\u2019s then applicable \npolicy on performance-based allocation of ADF resources.15 \n \n20.

A part of ADB\u2019s loan from Special Funds resources for \nthe first tranche of the MFF will be used for project implementation consultants and program \ntranche preparation consultants for tranches 2\u20134. ADB financing constitutes 79.3% of the cost \nof the portion of the investment program that will be supported by the MFF. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nTranche 1  Tranche 2  Tranche 3  Tranche 4  MFF    \n  \n   Share \nAmount   Amount   Amount   Amount   Amount  \n   of Total  \n($ million)  ($ million)  ($ million)  ($ million)  ($ million) \nSource  (%) \nAsian Development Bank             \n    Ordinary capital resources (loan)  380.0  200.0  270.0  120.0  970.0  77.7 \n    Special Funds resources (loan)  20.0  20.0  1.6 \n     \nOthers (Distribution companies)  110.5  50.0  67.5  30.0  258.0  20.7 \nTotal  510.5  250.0  337.5  150.0  1,248.0  100.0 \nMFF = multitranche financing facility, DISCO = distribution company. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n22.  Cofinancing possibilities for the investment program will be explored. If any cofinancing \nis confirmed, all necessary approvals for the incorporation of such cofinancing into the financing \nplan of the MFF, or the relevant project financed or to be financed by the MFF, as applicable, \nwill be obtained. These approvals will include any waiver of member country procurement \neligibility restrictions that might be necessary in connection with the provision of the cofinancing. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  MOWP will be the executing agency of the investment program. Each DISCO will be the \nimplementing agency in its own geographic area of jurisdiction.  Project management units \n(PMUs)  set  up  under  ADB\u2019s  earlier  MFF  for  power  distribution  (para.  9),  which  are  fully \noperational  and  well  familiar  with  ADB  policies  and  guidelines,  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing and monitoring the investment program. A dedicated technical team within each \nPMU will be established with AMI-specific staff resources. The PMUs will be provided with \nconsulting  support  on  project  implementation  covered  by  the  ADF  loan.  Implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the facility administration \nmanual (FAM).16 \n \n                                                \n16 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  Investment program: December 2015\u2013June 2024; tranche 1 (ordinary capital \nresources): December 2015\u2013June 2019; tranche 1 (Asian Development Fund): \nDecember 2015\u2013June 2024 \nEstimated completion date  Investment program: 30 June 2024 \nImplementation unit  Project implementation unit to be set up within the MFF tranche 1 project \nmanagement unit in each DISCO; number of staff to be determined depending on \neach tranche\u2019s scope \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Ministry of Water and Power \nSecretary (chair) \nJoint secretary (DISCOs); joint secretary, Economic Affairs Division; and chief \nexecutive officer (DISCO concerned) (members) \n(ii)   Executing agency  Ministry of Water and Power \n(iii)  Implementing  LESCO, IESCO, MEPCO, PESCO, HESCO, GEPCO, FESCO, QESCO, and SEPCO \nagencies \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  Multiple contracts  $970 million \nConsulting services  QCBS method  344 person-months  $8.2 million \nQCBS method  [TBD] person-months  $10.3 million \nRetroactive financing  ADB may, subject to its policies and procedures, allow upon request advance \nand/or advance  contracting of goods, works, and consulting services.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n24.  Under the investment program, AMI will be rolled out in phases. In the first phase under \ntranche 1 of the MFF, about 2 million customers in two circles of LESCO\u2019s and IESCO\u2019s \nRawalpindi region have been selected, which is about one-third of each company\u2019s clientele. \nOnce developed, the phase will be replicated and implemented in the remaining technically and \ncommercially feasible regions or circles of the various DISCOs. The AMI and billing system will \ninclude state-of-the-art equipment and software that will put Pakistan to the forefront of smart \ngrid technologies in the region. A few pilot advanced metering projects have been successfully \nimplemented in IESCO and LESCO. A small-scale automatic meter reading project is being \npiloted by the United States Agency for International Development in some DISCOs. \n \n25.  DISCO staff will install the meters and communication infrastructure, while the contractor \nwill implement the MDMS, billing system, and CIS. DISCO staff will work under the close \ndirection of the contractor and project implementation consultant, who will also provide training \non AMI operation and maintenance. All parties will be jointly responsible for the successful \ncommissioning of AMI. \n ", "8 \n \n26.  Smart  meters  and  communication  systems.  The  technology  selected  for  smart \nmeters  will  follow  international  standards,  including  some  specific  local  requirements  and \nfunctionalities  needed  to  achieve  the  investment  program\u2019s  targets,  such  as  remote  data \ncollection  for  billing,  remote  disconnection  and  connection  of  the  meters,  alarms  for  theft \ndetection, and demand control. The recommended meters are proven technologies operated all \nover the world. The communication infrastructure proposed in IESCO and LESCO for domestic \nand small and medium-sized commercial customers will be power line carrier (PLC)-based, and \ngeneral packet radio service-based for industrial and high-consumption commercial customers. \n \n27.  Before  recommending  the  PLC-based  communication  infrastructure,  the  feasibility \nconsultants  had  analyzed  all  other  options.  Because  the  radio  frequency  bands  normally \nrequired for this kind of application are not regulatory available, and since massive general \npacket radio service rollout entails high initial investment and operational costs, the feasibility \nstudy recommended PLC as the technically, economically, and financially most viable among \nthe three available options. \n \n28.  Meter data management systems. AMI comprises the head-end system and MDMS to \nremotely exchange information with the meters, process information, and provide the required \nalarms or inputs to manage the meters. The modular design solution recommended in the \nfeasibility study follows international standards, and will allow other meter manufacturers to be \nintegrated in future AMI development in DISCOs. Interoperability and the possibility of using \nseveral brands were carefully considered. The project also incorporates the supporting software \nto manage the information technology networks and the meters\u2019 rollout. The AMI control centers \nwill be duplicated to ensure operational response during unexpected blackouts. \n \n29.  Billing  systems  and  customer  information  system. The  billing  system  and  CIS, \nintegrated with the AMI, will be deployed for the whole customer base of the DISCO concerned \nto fully automate the \u201cmeter to cash\u201d process. The billing system and CIS will also be accessible \nin each customer service center, which will improve the quality of services. The systems will \nallow interfaces with other corporate systems to ensure automatic information flow. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n30.  Economic and financial analyses will be carried out separately for each DISCO and for \neach tranche under the investment program. For tranche 1, the financial internal rate of return is \n12.4%, which is greater than the weighted average cost of capital at 4.8%, confirming the \ninvestment\u2019s financial viability. The financial benefits accrued from a reduction in network losses \ntranslate into more revenues from electricity sales and lower operation and maintenance costs. \nThe economic internal rate of return is 18.6%, which is greater than the economic opportunity \ncost  of  12%,  confirming  the  investment\u2019s  economic  viability.  The  economic  benefits  are \nmeasured based on the value of the tariff net of taxes for incremental power consumption that \nstems from reduced system losses. \n \n31.  The financial performance of IESCO and LESCO was assessed for tranche 1. Except for \nfiscal year 2012, when the fuel cost surged and the timing for tariff increase was substantially \ndelayed, both DISCOs have been financially stable with a low level of debt and are expected to \nremain so even with the investment. The tariffs may need to rise marginally for a short time to \nreflect the cost of financing, but no significant direct impacts on tariffs are expected from the \ninvestment. \n \n ", "9 \nC.  Governance \n32.  The financial management assessment17 for tranche 1 was conducted in November \n2014 and shows that the pre-mitigation risks are substantial. Both IESCO and LESCO are under \na capacity development program with the United States Agency for International Development \nto introduce a new accounting manual and system. Although the DISCOs are familiar with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time), capacity development in \nprocuring such turnkey contracts and contract management is essential. \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the DISCOs. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the FAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social  \n34.  The investment program\u2019s poverty and social impacts are indirect. Improved systems will \nincrease household savings and reduce operating costs of small entrepreneurs who spend \nmuch on backup power generators. The CIS will not only provide facilities to customers for \nbilling  and  accurate  reading,  but  also  allow  them  to  monitor  consumption  trends.  A \ncommunication strategy will be devised to increase public awareness of AMI and its benefits. \n \n35.  With no direct benefits to women, tranche 1 is categorized as having no gender element, \nas detailed in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy.18 The project will also have \nminimal or no social impacts related to HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, and labor. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n36.  No civil works will be required for the AMI. No permanent or temporary land acquisition \nwill occur, nor any impact on assets or livelihoods. No indigenous peoples, as defined in ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009), were identified in areas to be covered by the investment \nprogram, which neither targets nor excludes individuals or specific groups of people. \n \n37.  The  MFF  is  expected  to  have  minimal  environmental  impact,  and  no  involuntary \nresettlement or indigenous peoples impact.19 However, to mitigate any impacts that may arise in \nany of the tranches, an environmental assessment and review framework, and a resettlement \nframework  were  prepared. 20   DISCOs  have  adequately  staffed  environment  and  social \nsafeguard cells within their PMUs to implement the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38.  The investment program\u2019s benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4, and described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n                                                \n17 The financial management assessment was conducted in November 2014. \n18 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Tranche 1 has been categorized as C for environmental impact as well as for involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous peoples, and the potential impacts of future tranches are expected to be the same. \n20 Resettlement Framework, and Environmental Assessment and Review Framework were disclosed on 15 January \n2015 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures by Distribution Companies \nExisting business processes are  The project implementation consultant will update, within 1 year of mobilization, the \nno longer applicable with AMI.  commercial procedures handbook to reflect the changes in business procedures \nrequired for AMI operations. \nNon-integrated solutions will  Focus on integrated solution.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n39.  The government, MOWP, and DISCOs have assured ADB that implementation of the \ninvestment program shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursements as described in detail in the FAM and loan documents. \n \n40.  The government, MOWP, and DISCOs have given ADB certain undertakings for the \nMFF, which are set forth in the framework financing agreement. Specific covenants agreed by \nthe government and DISCOs with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set forth in \nthe loan and project agreements for the respective tranches. \n \n41.  No withdrawal shall be made under any loan agreement for goods, works, or consulting \nservices until ADB has received a relending agreement executed between Pakistan and the \nrelevant DISCO or DISCOs in form and substance satisfactory to ADB. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n42.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the multitranche financing facility to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Second \nPower Distribution Enhancement Investment Program in an aggregate principal amount not \nexceeding the equivalent of $990,000,000, which comprises: \n(i)  the provision of loans from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with interest and \nother  terms  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  applicable  policies \nrelating to Special Funds resources; and \n(ii)  the provision of loans from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest and \nother terms to be determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility \nand is subject to such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n                  Takehiko Nakao \n                  President \n \n30 October 2015\n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nImpact the Program is Aligned with: \nFinancial viability of the power distribution sector improved.1 \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nElectricity revenues  a.
