An environmental impact assessment was undertaken; \nAssessment  the summary was circulated to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nBoard of Directors and placed on the ADB website on 19 May 2008. \n   \nProject Description  The  Ho  Chi  Minh  City\u2013Long  Thanh\u2013Dau  Giay  Expressway  (HLD \nexpressway)  Project  comprises  construction  of  approximately  51 \nkilometers  of  four-lane,  tolled  expressway.  The  expressway  will \ncommence at the junction of the Second Ring Road in District 9, Ho \nChi Minh City (HCMC), and end at a junction with National Highway 1 \nat Dau Giay, Dong Nai Province. It will provide a direct connection \nfrom the center of HCMC to economic growth areas in provinces to the \nnorth of HCMC along National Highway 1, which connects HCMC to \nHanoi.  The  expressway  will  be  a  toll  road,  with  access  initially \nrestricted to three locations: the intersection with the Second Ring \nRoad, the intersection with National Highway 51 at the southern end of \nLong Thanh town, and at Dau Giay. The Project includes construction \nof a major new 1,700-meter bridge over the Dong Nai River at Long \nThanh, and two rest and service areas. \n   \nRationale  The Government\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Plan for 2006\u20132010 \nidentifies  the  need  for  a  network  of  high-capacity,  high-speed \nexpressways to complement the network of national, provincial, and \ncity  roads.  Under  the  Government's  Expressway  Master  Plan, \ndeveloped  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  funding  under \ntechnical assistance for the Expressway Network Development Plan \nProject approved in 2005, a short-term program of priority expressway \nprojects was identified. This program includes the HLD expressway. \n \n  Greater  HCMC  is  the  largest  city  in  Viet  Nam  and  the  country\u2019s \neconomic hub. However, the road network both within and around \nHCMC is becoming heavily congested, travel speeds are decreasing, \nand  transport  costs  increasing.  Relief  to  city  roads  connecting  the \ncenter of HCMC and the port area with roads leading north from the \ncity to central and northern Viet Nam is urgently needed. HCMC also \nlies  at  a  critical  junction  on  the  transport  network  for  the  Greater \nMekong Subregion. \n   ", "ii     \nImpact and Outcome  The  project  impact  will  be  business-led,  pro-poor,  and  sustainable \neconomic growth in HCMC and neighboring provinces. The project \noutcome will be ability of transport users in HCMC and Dong Nai \nProvince to travel from District 9 in HCMC to Dau Giay with lower \ntransport costs on the HLD expressway.  \n   \nProject Investment  The  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $932.4  million \nPlan   equivalent, including taxes and duties of $6.6 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  Total \nSource  Percent \n($ million) \nAsian Development Bank  410.2   44.0 \nJapan Bank for International Cooperationa  517.6   55.5 \nVietnam Expressway Corporation  4.6   0.5 \n  Total  932.4   100.0 \na The amount indicated for the Japan Bank for International Cooperation is \nindicative pending the completion of detailed designs and final cost estimates \n \nA loan of $410,200,000 from the ordinary capital resources of ADB will \nbe  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  plus  a  spread  of  0.20%,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \nThe ADB loan will finance 44% of the total project cost and will fund \n(i) civil works for construction of the Long Thanh\u2013Dau Giay section of \nthe  HLD  expressway,  (ii)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \ncompensation  and  allowances  for  all  of  the Project,  (iii)  consulting \nservices, and (iv) project administration costs of Vietnam Expressway \nCorporation (VEC). ADB's financing will cover all local taxes on the \nADB-financed civil works section. \n \nThe  Government  also  requested  a  loan  of  \u00a550.972  billion  (about \n$444.5 million equivalent) from the Government of Japan through the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). The loan will have a \n30-year term, including a grace period of 10 years and an interest rate \nof 1.2% for the construction loan and 0.01% for consulting services. \nJBIC will finance civil works for the HCMC\u2013Long Thanh section of the \nHLD expressway, an electronic toll collection and traffic information \nand monitoring system for the entire Project, and consulting services.  \n \nVEC will finance the remaining cost of about $4.6 million equivalent. \n   ", "  iii\n  The discrepancy between the JBIC loan amount and the estimated \ncosts  for  the  JBIC-financed  project  components  presented  in  this \ndocument has arisen as a result of the initial JBIC loan amount being \nfixed in October 2007, whereas the estimated costs are based on an \nupdated cost estimate completed in February 2008. A determination of \nthe total amount of funding to be provided by JBIC will be drawn up \nonce detailed designs and final cost estimates are complete (expected \nby the end of March 2009); this amount will be consistent with the final \ncost estimates for the components to be funded by JBIC.  \n   \nAllocation and  The Government of Viet Nam will be the Borrower for the ADB and \nRelending Terms  JBIC loans. The Government will onlend the entire loan proceeds to \nVEC, as the Executing Agency. For the ADB loan, the onlending will \nbe on terms acceptable to ADB, and at ADB\u2019s interest rate applicable \nto  the  loans,  plus  an  onlending  fee  pursuant  to  the  Borrower\u2019s \nregulations. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  31 December 2014 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2014 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  VEC \n   \nImplementation  VEC  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  project  implementation  and \nArrangements  formal correspondence with the line ministries, provincial authorities, \nand ADB. VEC will engage and direct the work of consultants, and will \nprocure and direct all contractors. VEC will delegate responsibility for \nday-to-day project implementation to the Southern Expressway Project \nManagement Unit. The peoples committees of HCMC and Dong Nai \nProvince  have  established  district  compensation  committees  and \ncommune resettlement task forces for all districts through which the \nHLD expressway will pass. The district compensation committees will \nbe responsible for preparing and implementing the resettlement plans. \nVEC  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental management plan during design and construction.  \n   \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007 as amended \nfrom time to time). Civil works to be funded from the ADB loan will be \nprocured through (i) international competitive bidding procedures for \ntwo  contracts  to  construct  the  ADB-funded  section  of  the  HLD \nexpressway, and (ii) national competitive bidding procedures for four \ncontracts to prepare resettlement sites. JBIC will fund the remaining \nfour civil works contracts; procurement will follow JBIC procedures. \nVEC will fund a contract for clearance of unexploded ordnance for the \nentire expressway; procurement will follow Government procedures. \n   \n ", "iv     \nConsulting Services  The consulting service activities to be funded under the Project will be \nundertaken through four contracts, with three funded from the ADB \nloan and one from the JBIC loan. Using ADB loan proceeds, VEC will \nrecruit international consulting firms for the project supervision and \nthird party quality assurance consulting services using quality- and \ncost-based  selection  procedures.  For  the  project  audit  consulting \nservices, VEC will recruit a national consulting firm using consultants\u2019 \nqualifications selection procedures. All recruitments for ADB-funded \ncontracts will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n   \nProject Benefits and  The principal direct benefits generated by the construction of the HLD \nBeneficiaries  expressway include (i) increased efficiency of the movement of goods \nand people in the area around HCMC, the provinces surrounding the \ncity, and along the Greater Mekong Subregion southern and eastern \neconomic corridors; (ii) reduced transport costs in the same area; and \n(iii)  reduced  social  and  economic  costs  of  traffic  accidents.  As \ntransport  costs  are  a  key  input  to  economic  activities,  the  indirect \nbenefits  of  the  expressway  construction  will  be  an  increase  in \neconomic  growth  and  a  contribution  to  the  Government\u2019s  overall \npoverty reduction program. \n   \nRisks and  The main risk to the Project is delayed implementation because of \nAssumptions  slow finalization of detailed designs and procurement of civil works \ncontracts.  This  is  being  addressed  through  the  project  preparation \nwork  undertaken  under  the  ADB-funded  Ho  Chi  Minh  City\u2013Long \nThanh\u2013Dau Giay Expressway Technical Assistance Project. This work \nincludes  all  activities  required  to  facilitate  commencement  of \nconstruction.  The  technical  assistance  is  addressing  the  risk \nassociated  with  VEC\u2019s  limited  capacity  and  experience  with \nmanagement of major projects. It includes a component to address \nregulatory  and  institutional  strengthening  of  VEC.  Under  this \ncomponent, a revised organization structure will be prepared for VEC \nto address the corporation\u2019s future needs.  \n \nThe construction of the HLD expressway is not anticipated to cause \nany major environmental impacts. Impacts during construction will be \nmitigated through implementation of an environmental management \nplan covering both construction and operation phases. Impacts during \noperation are expected to be limited to air and noise pollution due to \nvehicular emissions, and potential water pollution due to accidents. \n \nThe Project will cause significant impacts because of land acquisition \nand resettlement activities. Risks that may arise from these activities \nhave been mitigated through a full resettlement plan and measures to \naddress vulnerable groups, including a gender strategy. Impacts on \nethnic  minorities  will  be  minor  as  only  11  households  from  ethnic \nminorities were identified. These 11 households were found to be well \nintegrated into mainstream society; they will not be affected differently \nthan the main ethnic groups.

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Ho Chi Minh City\u2013Long Thanh\u2013Dau Giay (HLD) \nExpressway Construction Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  In 2007, the Vietnamese economy expanded by an estimated 8.5%,1 one of the fastest \nrates in the world. This performance came on top of an average annual growth rate of 8.1% \nduring 2004\u20132006. In 2007 GDP growth was mainly driven by rapid growth in industry, which \nexpanded by 10.6% and contributed 4.3% to GDP growth; and services, which expanded by \n8.7% and accounted for 3.5% of GDP growth. One of the consequences of this sustained rapid \ngrowth has been an equally rapid increase in the use of motorized vehicles, which is leading to \nincreased congestion on the highway network. If industry is to continue as a major driver of \ngrowth in the Vietnamese economy, development of the highway transport system needs to \ncontinue so that goods and people can be moved efficiently.  \n \n3.  Investments in large infrastructure have played a major role in attracting the private \ninvestment and employment that has underpinned Viet Nam\u2019s remarkable success in reducing \npoverty.  While  the  results  of  recent  investments  in  transport  infrastructure  are  impressive, \ninvestment demands are still considerable and past growth has spawned several complex \nissues. These challenges are identified in several studies and recognized in the Government\u2019s \nSocio-Economic Development Plan for 2006\u20132010;2 they generally fall into three categories: \ntransport management, transport financing, and urbanization. An overview of the road subsector \nis in Appendix 2. \n \n4.  Transport Management. Viet Nam has relatively inefficient transport infrastructure and \nhigh transport costs. Capacity is constrained; less than 5% of national highways have four-\nlanes, and quality is poor. Less than 50% of national highways are considered to be in good \ncondition and more than 30% of bridges have weight restrictions, many waterway crossings \nhave no bridges. Rail transport is inhibited by low speeds and limited capacity; inland waterways \nhave  limited  cargo-handling  facilities.  Thus,  improving  transport  infrastructure  is  crucial  to \ndeveloping a competitive economy. To be competitive, infrastructure must be brought up to \nmodern standards. Viet Nam needs to enact and enforce laws, regulations, and policies that \nencourage transportation to and through Viet Nam in conformity with international practices.  \n \n5.  Transport Financing. Economic growth generates increased demand for infrastructure. \nFunds  from  the  state  budget  are  not  adequate,  even  when  supplemented  with  external \nassistance.  The  World  Bank 3  estimates  planned  annual  expenditure  of  about  \n$2.3 billion for the period up to 2020, compared to total actual expenditures of about $4.0 billion \nduring 2001\u20132005 of which 42% was funded by official development assistance. While both \ndomestic and foreign private funds are potentially available, but they are rarely accessed due to \nregulatory weaknesses. Given that concessionary official development assistance is limited and \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank estimate. \n2  Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2005. The Five-Year Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006\u20132010. Hanoi. \n3  World Bank. 2005. Transport Strategy: Transition, Reform, and Sustainable Management. Washington, DC. ", "2   \nthe demand is great, the Government will need to borrow long-term commercial funds for large \ninfrastructure.  \n \n6.  Urbanization. With economic development, Viet Nam is becoming an increasingly urban \nsociety; demands for urban services are increasing rapidly. Economic opportunities in urban \nareas attract migrants. In 2003, 25% of the country\u2019s population was urban; this is expected to \nreach 45% by 2020. Urban centers now account for about 70% of total economic output, and \nmost foreign direct investment is directed toward cities. The combination of rapidly growing \npopulation and economic growth rates higher than the national average is driving a rapid \nincrease in demand for transport services in urban areas. Meeting these demands for urban \ntransport will require large investments in new roads and public transport, such as mass rail \ntransport and high-speed, high-capacity expressways.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n7.  Traffic volume is increasing rapidly, typically more than 10% a year. Congestion on \nmany major roads is an increasing problem and an inappropriate traffic mix is contributing to \nsevere  road  safety  problems.  The  construction  of  expressways  along  key  corridors  would \nprovide large capacity highways to reduce congestion, absorb traffic growth, and reduce the \nnumber of road safety incidents.  \n \n8.  Greater Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is the largest city in Viet Nam and the country\u2019s \neconomic hub. Its population is forecast to grow by 2.1% per annum from 7.9 million4 in 2008 to \n10.3 million by 2020. Growth in annual trade volume, in terms of value, through HCMC\u2019s port \nexceeded 15% in 2006. The road network both within and around HCMC is already heavily \ncongested, travel speeds are reducing, and transport costs are increasing. Relief is urgently \nneeded by providing city roads connecting the center of HCMC and the port area with (i) the \nsuburbs to the north and northeast of the city and further out to the roads leading north from the \ncity to central and northern Viet Nam, and (ii) the major subregional transport routes along the \nsouthern and eastern economic corridors that meet at HCMC and form part of the Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS) Transport Network under the GMS program. \n \n1.  The Government\u2019s Strategy \n \n9.  The Government is acutely aware of the impact of inadequate infrastructure on growth \nand  poverty  reduction,  and  is  already  beginning  to  see  infrastructure  bottlenecks  affecting \nforeign investment. It wishes to share development more equitably with parts of the country that \nare remote from major urban areas\u2014Hanoi, HCMC, Da Nang, and others. As part of the \nGovernment\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Plan for 2006\u20132010 (footnote 2), the transport \nsector  is  expected  to  promote  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction,  safety  enhancement, \nenvironmental protection, and human resource development. For roads, the Government has \nnoted the need for a network of high-capacity, high-speed expressways to complement the \nnetwork of national, provincial, and city roads. Under the Expressway Master Plan, developed \nwith Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance,5 a short-term program (2006\u20132015) of priority \nexpressway projects was developed consisting of 21 projects covering 1,968 kilometers (km) \nwith an estimated construction cost of $11.556 billion.6 A medium-term program (2016\u20132025) \n                                                 \n4  Estimate includes permanent and transient population. \n5  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Expressway Network Development \nPlan. Manila (TA 4695-VIE). \n6  In 2007 prices. \n ", "  3 \nwas also proposed that included another 8 projects covering an additional 875 km with an \nestimated construction cost of $5.238 billion. \n \n10.  In 2004, Vietnam Expressway Corporation (VEC) was established, as a state-owned \nenterprise under the Ministry of Transport, to invest in expressway construction, management, \nand operation and maintenance (O&M). In establishing VEC, the intent was to allow VEC to \nindependently raise funds without recourse to sovereign guarantees. However, VEC cannot \nissue debt instruments until it obtains a credit rating, which at this time is not practical as VEC \nhas virtually no assets and very limited cash flow. Initial projects will need government support \nuntil VEC establishes a credible financial record that demonstrates capacity to fund the large \ncapital needs required for construction of sections of the expressway network. Establishing this \nfinancial capacity will take some time as the first expressway to begin operation will likely be the \nCau  Gie\u2013Ninh  Binh  Expressway  in  2011.  To  date,  VEC  has  limited  experience  in  project \nmanagement, financial management, procurement, and safeguard issues. The ADB-funded Ho \nChi Minh City\u2013Long Thanh\u2013Dau Giay Technical Assistance Project7 (HLD TA) will implement a \nstrengthening and capacity-building component for VEC that includes tasks to reorganize VEC \nand  put  in  place  financial  information  and  asset  management  systems.  This  work  is  to \nstrengthen the organization structure of VEC, facilitate a change from a state-owned enterprise \nto a commercially oriented infrastructure provider, and position VEC as a viable partner to work \nwith the private sector.  \n \n11.  The legal and regulatory environment for private sector investment in the transport \nsector needs to be improved. Although the country has a generic public\u2013private partnership \n(PPP) law, it does not meet the specific requirements of road subsector PPPs. Further, existing \nroad  subsector  laws  do  not  provide  a  comprehensive  framework  for  PPPs.  Initiating  and \nattracting private investor interest to road PPPs depends on a comprehensive policy. Such a \npolicy is absent in Viet Nam. Under the World Bank-funded Road Network Improvement Project8 \na study on PPP in the road subsector is in progress. This study\u2019s objective is to assist the \nMinistry of Transport to formulate a strategy for development of roads with PPP, and the \npreparation of a policy framework for private sector participation in toll roads. \n \n2.  Lessons  \n \n12.  ADB country portfolio review missions have noted implementation delays in previous \nroad projects, in particular during project start-up. Delays in recruiting consultants or preparing \ndetailed designs have led directly to delays in award of civil works. This is addressed in the \ndesign of the Project by (i) using advance action for selecting consultants, and (ii) incorporating \nall safeguard-related and procurement-related activities in the scope of the HLD TA (footnote 7). \nRecruitment  of  consultants  under  the  HLD  TA  was  completed  in  August  2008.  These \nconsultants  have  commenced  work  on  (i)  preparing  detailed  engineering  designs,  \n(ii)  developing  procurement  documentation,  (iii)  updating  safeguards  documentation,  and  \n(iv) implementing resettlement plans. The intent is that by the time of approval of loans for the \nProject,  updating  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  will  be  in  progress,  and \nprocurement of civil works and consulting services contracts will be well advanced.  \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2007.

As set out in ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for Viet Nam,9 ADB will support the \nGovernment's  investment  program  to  improve  transport  infrastructure  and  reduce  transport \ncosts. The program of investment projects under the country strategy and program form three \nthrusts that are in line with the Socio-Economic Development Plan. The first thrust supports \ninvestment projects to reduce critical transport bottlenecks hampering economic growth in the \nmain development centers. Projects will include investments in urban transport and priority \nexpressway and railway facilities to facilitate the safe and efficient movement of goods and \npeople around, through, and between national centers of major economic activity. The second \nthrust will support social equity aspects of Viet Nam\u2019s transport needs through support to the \ndevelopment of provincial and district roads. The third thrust complements the first two by \nbringing  regional  dimensions  to  the  development  of  the  transport  network  in  terms  of \nconnectivity and competitiveness. \n \n14.  Under the Expressway Network Development Plan (footnote 5), ADB provided technical \nassistance  (TA)  in  response  to  the  Government\u2019s  request  for  assistance  to  plan  the \ndevelopment of an expressway network. The TA funded a study that prepared an expressway \nmaster plan for the long-term development of the country\u2019s expressway network, and identified \npriority expressway projects. An initial assessment was made of each section of the proposed \nexpressway network and an overall ranking was prepared based on estimates of net present \nvalue. Based on this ranking, the HLD expressway was evaluated a very high priority. Given \nthat HCMC is the economic engine of Viet Nam, and the need to ensure that the country\u2019s \neconomic growth continues, addressing the infrastructure restraints of HCMC was given the \nhighest priority. The HLD expressway is included in the 2004 Urban Transport Master Plan and \nFeasibility Study in the Ho Chi Minh Metropolitan Area (often referred to as the HOUTRANS \nstudy), prepared with assistance from the Japan International Cooperation Agency. The ADB-\nfunded  HLD  TA  (footnote  7)  will  complete  all  detailed  project  preparation  documentation \nsufficient  to  allow  construction  work  on  the  HLD  expressway  to  commence.  The  HLD  TA \nincludes a strengthening and capacity building component for VEC (para. 10). Work under the \nHLD TA commenced in September 2008. \n \n4.  External Assistance \n \n15.  External  support  to  roads  in  Viet  Nam  commenced  in  1993  (Appendix  3).  Initially, \nprojects focused on rehabilitating National Highway 1 (QL1), which runs along the country\u2019s east \ncoast  and  acts  as  the  central  spine  for  the  road  network.  These  QL1  projects  were \ncomplemented by improvements under ADB-funded projects to highways connecting QL1 to the \nViet Nam sections of GMS economic corridors. As work on improving QL1 is drawing to a close, \nprojects are increasingly focusing on other parts of the road network and commencing the \nconstruction of an expressway network. ADB has provided a TA loan10 and an investment loan11 \nfor the GMS Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway Project that will fund construction of this expressway \nconnecting Hanoi to the border with the People\u2019s Republic of China at Lao Cai. \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2006.

The impact of the Project will be business-led, pro-poor, and sustainable economic \ngrowth in HCMC and neighboring provinces. The outcome of the Project will be that transport \nusers in HCMC and Dong Nai Province can travel from HCMC District 9 to Dau Giay with lower \ntransport costs on the HLD expressway. At present, all traffic leaving HCMC to the northeast \nhas to pass over the Dong Nai Bridge and then pass through a dense area of industrial estates \ncentered on Ben Hoa. Further, the route provides the only connection from the HCMC port area, \nimmediately  to  the  south  of  the  city  center,  to  all  destinations  to  the  north  of HCMC.  As \neconomic growth centers develop around HCMC, a high-capacity, high-speed transport link is \nneeded to divert heavy port traffic away from the city center and provide direct access to the \nnorth. The HLD expressway provides that link. The benefit to users of the expressway will be a \nreduction in transport costs for the movement of passengers and goods (i) between HCMC and \nthe provinces to the north and northeast of the city, and (ii) along transport links on the GMS \nsouthern  and  eastern  economic  corridors.  The  HLD  expressway  is  a  key  link  in  an \ninterconnected  network  of  expressways  and  ring  roads  around  HCMC  that  is  planned  for \ndevelopment within the next 10 years.12 The impact of this network will be to alleviate transport \nconstraints on development in the HCMC area. \n \n17.  Economic activity in HCMC and the surrounding provinces is a major driver of the \nVietnamese economy, and is focused on the industry and service sectors, which are driven by \nexport  markets.  Industrial  developments  in  the  HCMC  area  include  electronics,  industrial \nprocessing, construction equipment, building materials, and agroproducts. Currently, the city \nhas 15 industrial parks and export-processing zones. The value of the city's industrial activities \nin 2007 is estimated at $6.4 billion, equivalent to 30% of the whole country. The value of goods \npassing through HCMC ports in 2007 is estimated at $36 billion, or 40% of the national total, of \nwhich export revenue reached $18.3 billion accounting for 40% of the country\u2019s total export \nrevenue.13 With growth in the HCMC area exceeding that of the nation as a whole, the demands \nbeing placed on transport infrastructure to support economic activities are rising rapidly and \nmajor investments are required to expand capacity.  \n \n18.  The Project comprises the construction of about 51 km of four-lane expressway. The \nexpressway will commence in District 9 of HCMC at the junction with the Second Ring Road \nand the East\u2013West Highway, a new highway that crosses through the center of HCMC. The \nHLD expressway will end at the junction at Dau Giay with QL 1, the main north\u2013south highway \nlinking HCMC with Hanoi. The alignment passes by the proposed site of the new HCMC \ninternational airport and will relieve congestion on the existing QL 1, through Bien Hoa, for traffic \nentering HCMC from the north. Construction work will include about 21 bridges, of which 20 are \nsmall or medium in scale. The Project will include construction of a new bridge over the Dong \nNai River at Long Thanh; the bridge will have a total length of about 1,700 meters and a width of \n19.75  meters.  The  expressway  will  be  a  toll  road,  with  access  initially  restricted  to  three \nlocations:  the  intersection  with  the  Second  Ring  Road,  the  intersection  with  QL51  at  the \nsouthern end of Long Thanh town, and at Dau Giay. Additional intersections may be provided \nas the road network develops in HCMC and Dong Nai Province, particularly with the proposed \nthird ring road and an expressway from Bien Hoa to Vung Tau. Toll plazas will be constructed at \n                                                 \n12  Planned expressways include Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh, Ben Hoa\u2013Vung Tau, and Dau Giay\u2013Nha Trang. Planned ring \nroads include the second and third ring roads. \n13  Source: http://www.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/eng. \n ", "6   \nthe three interchanges; at the interchange with QL51 the toll booths will be located on the \napproach ramps, not on the expressway itself. In addition two rest and service areas are \nplanned. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n19.  The  core  output  from  the  Project  will  be  that  the  HLD  expressway  is  operating, \nconnecting  HCMC  District  9  with  Dau  Giay.  To  ensure  that  the  Project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are acceptable, the Project will implement full resettlement plans, an \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  prepared  based  on  an  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA), and an HIV awareness and prevention of human trafficking program. Project \ndocumentation incorporates a gender strategy, and the Project will implement a road safety \nawareness campaign and road safety audits. A project performance management system will \nbe  put  in  place  to  monitor  compliance  with  project  requirements  and  to  measure  project \nindicators. The project design includes O&M of the completed expressway under an O&M \nconcession. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n20.  Cofinancing. The Project will be cofinanced by ADB and Japan Bank for International \nCooperation (JBIC). Cofinancing will be on a parallel basis with each civil works and consulting \nservices contract funded by a single financier. However, ADB funding will be applied to all land \nacquisition and resettlement activities for the entire Project, and JBIC will fund an electronic toll \ncollection and traffic information and monitoring system for the entire Project. An agreement \nbetween ADB, JBIC, and VEC confirms that the requirements of ADB\u2019s environment, indigenous \npeoples, and involuntary resettlement policies will apply to the entire Project. \n \n21.  Environmental Assessment. Based on the requirements of ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002), the Project is categorized environment category A. The Government prepared an EIA \nfor the Project and submitted it to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment in July \n2007; it approved the EIA in October 2007. Under the ADB-funded TA for the Expressway \nNetwork Development Plan (footnote 5), the Government\u2019s EIA was updated and additional \nsections added to fulfill the requirements of ADB\u2019s Environment Policy. A summary EIA for the \nProject was prepared and circulated to the ADB Board of Directors and made publicly available \nthrough the ADB website on 19 May 2009. The project area does not include any sensitive \nareas  such  as  national  parks,  protected  areas,  or  special  use  forests  within  or  near  the \nproposed alignment. Endangered, threatened, or rare species of flora and fauna have not been \nfound in the project area. The construction of the HLD expressway is not anticipated to cause \nany major change to the current ecology. \n \n22.  Resettlement Plan. The involuntary resettlement category for the Project is category A. \nA full resettlement plan was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995). A summary of the resettlement plan is in Appendix 4, and the full resettlement plan is \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix A. Based on the results of a census and inventory of \nlosses carried out during project preparation, the project-affected persons (i.e., households, \norganizations, companies) were identified. A total of 975 households will be affected in District 9 \nof HCMC (167 households) and in four districts of Dong Nai Province (808 households). Of \nthese, 31 households in HCMC and 392 households in Dong Nai Province will lose more than \n10% of their productive assets; 309 households will have to relocate to new plots of residential \nland as their land will be either totally acquired or the remaining land will be no longer be viable; \nand 246 households will lose some land but they will retain sufficient residential land to retain or \n ", "  7 \nrelocate structures on the remaining land. The Project will acquire land currently being used by \nthree rubber plantation companies, commune-owned culverts, 15 irrigation canals, church land \nwith a prayer house, and three foundations for transmission towers. In terms of land acquisition, \n307 hectares will be acquired of which 62 hectares are in HCMC and 245 hectares in Dong Nai \nProvince.  \n \n23.  Land Acquisition and Retroactive Financing. The Government requested that ADB \nloan funds be used to finance land acquisition and resettlement activities. As required by ADB\u2019s \nOperation Manuals,14 due diligence assessments focused on the (i) expected productive nature \nof  the  acquisition;  (ii)  suitability  of  land  market  conditions;  (iii)  adequacy  of  administrative \narrangements; (iv) definition of the risk profile of the transaction; and (v) soundness of the \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  arrangements.  From  the  results  of  these  assessments,  ADB \nconcluded  that  all  requirements  had  been  met,  a  copy  of  the  due  diligence  report  is  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  B.  The  Government  also  requested  that  retroactive  financing  be \napproved for land acquisition and resettlement activities. Approval of this request will allow the \nupdating and implementation of the resettlement plan to proceed in parallel with processing of \nthe Project to expedite award of construction contracts and shorten project implementation. \nConsulting services resources to assist in updating and implementing the resettlement plan are \navailable under the HLD TA (footnote 7). However, implementation cannot commence without \naccess to the Project\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement funds. \n \n24.  Public\u2013Private Partnership. As an initial step to the involvement of the private sector in \nthe expressway subsector, an O&M concession will be put in place using competitive bidding \nprocedures. The intent is that the O&M concession will take effect within 2 years of completion \nof construction of the HLD expressway and use documentation being prepared under the HLD \nTA (footnote 7).  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n25.  The project investment cost is estimated at $932.4 million equivalent, including taxes \nand duties of $6.6 million. The total cost includes physical and price contingencies, and interest \nand other charges during implementation. The project investment plan is shown in Table 1, \ndetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 5.  \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n26.  The Government has requested a loan of $410,200,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility plus a spread of 0.20%, a commitment charge of \n0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. The ADB loan will finance 44% of the total project cost: \n(i) civil works for construction of the Long Thanh\u2013Dau Giay section of the HLD expressway,  \n(ii)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  compensation  and  allowances  for  all  of  the  Project,  \n(iii) consulting services, and (iv) VEC's project administration costs. ADB financing will cover all \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2005. Operations Manual.

Eligible  expenses \nincurred by VEC for project administration, and by the city, provincial, and district resettlement \ncommittees in implementing the resettlement plan will include (i) salaries for full-time VEC staff \nengaged  in  administration  of  the  Project;  (ii)  leases,  utilities,  office  equipment  (both  hard \nfurnishings and computer equipment), and communication charges for offices established for \nthe  Project  by  VEC;  (iii)  per  diem,  travel,  and  other  field  allowances;  and  (iv)  lease, \nmaintenance, and operating costs for vehicles acquired by VEC for project use only. \n \n29.  The  Government  also  requested  a  loan  of  \u00a550.972  billion  (about  $444.5  million15 \nequivalent) from the Government of Japan through JBIC. The loan will have a 30-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 10 years and an interest rate of 1.2% for the construction loan and \n0.01% for consulting services. JBIC will finance civil works for the HCMC\u2013Long Thanh section, \nan electronic toll collection and traffic information and monitoring system for the entire Project, \nand consulting services. Counterpart funds from VEC will cover taxes on the JBIC-financed \nproject components. As of October 2007, the agreed amount of funding from JBIC to the Project \nis \u00a550.972 billion, this amount will be provided using a time-slice modality with the first loan for \n\u00a516.643 billion signed in March 2008. Loan documents for the remaining funds will be drawn up \nonce detailed designs and final cost estimates are complete. At that time,16 the total amount of \nfunding to be provided by JBIC, and the value of the second time-slice loan, will be determined \nto be consistent with the final cost estimates for JBIC-funded components. The discrepancy \nbetween the agreed JBIC loan amount and the estimated costs for the JBIC-financed project \ncomponents presented in this document is a result of the initial JBIC loan amount being fixed in \nOctober  2007,  whereas  the  estimated  costs  are  based  on  a  February  2008  update.  The \nGovernment has provided ADB with an assurance that any shortfall in the JBIC financing will be \ncovered from the Government\u2019s own funds. \n \n30.  VEC will finance the remaining cost, about $4.6 million equivalent. The loans from ADB \nand JBIC will be lent to the Government of Viet Nam.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n31.  VEC will be the Executing Agency for the Project. VEC will have overall responsibility for \nproject implementation and formal correspondence with the line ministries, provincial authorities, \nand ADB. VEC will engage and direct the work of consultants, and procure and direct all \ncontractors. It will delegate responsibility for day-to-day project implementation to the Southern \nExpressway Project Management Unit (SEPMU). SEPMU is based in HCMC and will establish \nfield offices in district 9 of HCMC and Long Thanh district, Dong Nai Province. SEPMU has a \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  unit,  headed  by  the  SEPMU  deputy-director,  and  has \nassigned  four  staff  on  a  full-time  basis  to  represent  VEC  on  the  district  compensation \ncommittees  (DCCs).  In  addition,  one  accountant  will  be  responsible  for  administering  and \nmonitoring loan funds for land acquisition and resettlement. Vietnamese regulations require that \nland acquisition and resettlement plans are implemented by the relevant provincial authorities. \nThe peoples committees of HCMC and Dong Nai Province have established DCCs for all \ndistricts through which the HLD expressway will pass. The DCCs will be the implementing \nagencies for the land acquisition and resettlement plans, and be responsible for payment of all \ncompensation and allowances. VEC will ensure that an updated resettlement plan is prepared \nprior  to  any  award  of  civil  works  contracts.  VEC  will  have  overall  responsibility  for \nimplementation  of  the  EMP  during  design  and  construction.  EMP  requirements  will  be \nincorporated into the construction documents; monitoring and enforcement will be ensured by \nthe ADB- and JBIC-funded construction supervision consultants. VEC will implement the EMP \nrequirements during expressway operation, with the provincial departments of natural resources \nand the environment providing the monitoring. Project organization arrangements are shown in \nAppendix 6. \n  \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n32.  The Project will be implemented from December 2008 to June 2014. This assumes that \nconstruction work on the first package will commence by the June 2009 and that the last \npackage will be sufficiently complete for the HLD expressway to be opened for operation by the \nJune  2013.  An  additional  year  is  allowed  to  complete  all  construction  work  and  finalize \npayments. The implementation schedule for the Project is in Appendix 7. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n33.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Civil works to be funded \nfrom the ADB loan will be procured through (i) international competitive bidding procedures for \ntwo contracts to construct the ADB-funded section of the HLD expressway, and (ii) national \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  for  four  contracts  to  prepare  resettlement  sites.  The  first \ninternational  competitive  bidding  contract  will  cover  construction  of  13.9  km  of  the  HLD \nexpressway from the end of the JBIC section at Long Thanh to a point 37.8 km from the start of \nthe  expressway.  The  second  international  competitive  bidding  contract  will  cover  the \nconstruction of 17.2 km of expressway from kilometer 37.8 to the eastern end of the HLD \nexpressway at Dau Giay. Advance contracting procedures will be applied to procurement of civil \nworks contracts. The remaining four civil works contracts will be funded by JBIC and procured \nusing JBIC procedures. JBIC will also fund an equipment contract for an electronic toll collection \nand traffic information and monitoring system for the entire HLD expressway. This contract will \nbe procured using JBIC procedures. VEC will fund a contract for clearance of unexploded \n ", "  11 \nordnance  for  the  entire  expressway.  This  contract  will  be  procured  using  Government \nprocedures. Contract packages are presented in the procurement plan in Appendix 8. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n34.  The consulting service activities to be funded under the Project will be undertaken \nthrough four contracts, with three funded from the ADB loan and one from the JBIC loan. Using \nADB loan proceeds, VEC will recruit international consulting firms for the project supervision \nand third party quality assurance consulting services using quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedures,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time); full technical proposals will be required. For the project audit \nconsulting services, VEC will recruit a national consulting firm using consultants\u2019 qualifications \nselection procedures, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Use of \nconsultants\u2019 qualifications selection procedures and a shortlist comprising only national firms is \njustified as (i) the cost of services is estimated at $180,000, (ii) the number of qualified national \nfirms is sufficient to draw up a shortlist, (iii) national firms have successfully undertaken these \nservices  under  previous  ADB-funded  projects,  and  (iv)  the  preparation  and  evaluation  of \ncompetitive proposals is not necessary given the nature of the services. In the evaluation of \nproposals for all services, except those under consultants\u2019 qualifications selection procedures, \nto calculate the firms\u2019 total scores the technical proposals will be given a weight of 80% and the \nfinancial  proposals  a  weight  of  20%.  About  1,800  person-months  (200  person-months  of \ninternational and 1,600 person-months of national consulting services) will be required. For the \nproject supervision services, the consultants should have expertise in project management, \nhighway engineering, structural engineering, geology, material and quality control, international \nprocurement, toll collection systems, expressway O&M management and works, road safety \nimprovement,  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation,  project  financial  assessment, \ncorporate  financing,  toll  setting,  EIA  and  environmental  management,  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement,  livelihood  development  and  income  restoration  programs,  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment  strategies,  gender  strategies,  HIV  and  sexually  transmitted  infections,  human \ntrafficking, and staff training. For the third party quality assurance services, the consultants \nshould  have  expertise  in  providing  quality  assurance  services  for  major  highway  projects, \nincluding construction of major bridges. Outline terms of reference for consulting services are in \nAppendix 9. VEC has engaged an external monitoring agency under the HLD TA (footnote 7) to \nmonitor the updating and implementation of the resettlement plans. Retroactive financing will \nnot be required for consulting services. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy  \n \n35.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  VEC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \n36.  To ensure transparency and good governance, VEC will publicly disclose on its website \ninformation on how loan proceeds are being used. For each procurement contract, VEC will \ndisclose (i) the list of participating bidders, (ii) name of the winning bidder, (iii) basic details on \n ", "12   \nbidding procedures adopted, (iv) amount of the contract awarded, (v) list of goods and/or \nservices  purchased,  and  (vi)  intended  and  actual  utilization  of  loan  proceeds  under  each \ncontract. VEC will disclose details of resettlement reports on its website. The website will be \nupdated within 2 weeks of each contract being awarded. VEC will submit internal and external \nresettlement  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  every  quarter,  and  place  them  within  2  weeks  of \nsubmission. Moreover, the Government will ensure that all VEC\u2019s project staff are fully aware of \nand comply with Government and ADB procedures, including for implementation, procurement, \nuse of consultants, disbursement, reporting, monitoring, and prevention of fraud and corruption. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n37.  Loan disbursement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  between  the \nGovernment and ADB. A diagram showing the funds flow arrangements is in Appendix 10. Loan \nproceeds will be disbursed directly to the contractors and consultants, based on an approved \ncontract  using  direct  payment  procedures.  An  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  a \ncommercial  bank  acceptable  to  the  Government  and  ADB,  and  be  operated  under  ADB\u2019s \nimprest  account  procedures  as  shown  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  VEC  will \nadminister the imprest account. The initial deposit to the imprest account will be based on \nADB\u2019s share of estimated expenditures to be funded from the imprest account for the first  \n6 months or $40.7 million, whichever is lower. Use of the imprest account will be limited to VEC \nproviding funds for (i) payments for project administration costs, (ii) payments for consulting \nservices, and (iii) replenishment of second generation imprest accounts (SGIAs).   \n \n38.  Five SGIAs will be established in the project districts17 for payment of expenses arising \nfrom implementation of the Project\u2019s resettlement plan. Use of the SGIAs will be in accordance \nwith procedures in ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook. The initial deposit to an SGIA will be \nbased on ADB\u2019s share of estimated expenditures to be funded from the imprest account for the \nfirst 6 months of project implementation or $5 million, whichever is lower. Use of the SGIAs will \nbe limited to VEC providing funds for payments (i) to affected persons for land and other assets \nacquired  to  facilitate  construction  of  the  HLD  expressway;  (ii)  to  affected  persons  for \nresettlement compensation and allowances as set out in the approved updated resettlement \nplan;  (iii)  for  relocation  site  development  and  income  restoration  programs;  and  (iv)  for \nincremental expenses incurred by the city, provincial, and district compensation committees \nnecessary for implementing the approved updated resettlement plan. Liquidation of any amount \npaid from any SGIA for land or other assets will require submission of (i) a valid validation \ncertificate issued by an external valuer acceptable to both the Government and ADB; (ii) the \nresults of the detailed measurement survey for the affected person receiving the payment, \nsigned as agreed by the affected person, setting out the assets to be acquired; (iii) that receipt \nof  payment  is  acknowledged  by  the  affected  person,  and  (iv)  certification  by  the  external \nmonitoring agency that the affected person has received the full payment. VEC will administer \nthe  SGIAs  and  be  responsible  for  ensuring  they  are  operated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements, authorize all withdrawals from the SGIAs, and ensure that all SGIAs are audited \nas part of the regular annual audits of project accounts. The statement of expenditure procedure \nwill be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and liquidate advances to imprest and SGIA \naccounts to facilitate project implementation. The ceiling for each payment under the statement \nof expenditure procedure is $100,000. \n \n                                                 \n17  District 9 in HCMC, and Cam My, Long Thanh, Nhon Trach, and Thong Nhat districts of Dong Nai Province. \n ", "  13 \n39.  Retroactive financing up to a limit of $80 million will be applied to (i) acquisition of land \nand compensation of nonland assets; (ii) resettlement allowances; (iii) incremental expenses for \nthe city, provincial, and district resettlement committees incurred during implementation of the \nproject resettlement plan; (iv) civil works to prepare resettlement sites for the Project; and  \n(v) implementation of appropriate income restoration programs. Use of retroactive financing for \nthese  activities  is  considered  reasonable  as  this  will  allow  the  timely  commencement  of \nconstruction activities. The $80 million represents less than 20% of the ADB loan and is thus \nwithin the limit set out in ADB\u2019s Operations Manual.18 Retroactive financing will be applied only \nto expenditures incurred no earlier than 12 months before the loan signing date and under \narrangements acceptable to ADB. Reimbursement procedures, in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook, will be applied to payments for eligible expenses under retroactive \nfinancing. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n40.  VEC  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  goods  and \nservices  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  project  loan,  financing  resources  received, \nexpenditures incurred for the Project, an audit of resettlement expenditures, and use of local \nfunds. Within 6 months of the close of the each year, VEC will submit audited annual project \naccounts to ADB, which provide a detailed description of the source of funds and expenditures \nmade. Annual project accounts will be audited by an auditor acceptable to ADB, and the \nauditor\u2019s terms of reference will be approved by ADB before commencement of work. The \nannual audit will include a separate audit opinion on the imprest account, SGIAs, and statement \nof expenditures procedure operations.  \n \n41.  Regular progress reports on the Project will be prepared by the construction supervision \nconsultants, reviewed by VEC, and submitted by VEC to ADB. Progress reports will include a \ndescription of the physical progress, status of implementation of updated resettlement plans, \nstatus of work subject to provisions of the EMP, procurement and contractual status, and \nhighlights of any implementation issues. The progress reports will contain a summary of project \naccounts, including details of the latest project expenditures and contract amounts. They will \ninclude an evaluation of progress in implementing the Project. Within 6 months of physical \ncompletion of the Project, VEC will provide ADB with a project completion report covering \ndetails of project implementation, costs, and an evaluation of the Project\u2019s success in meeting \nperformance targets. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n42.  VEC will establish systematic project performance monitoring and analysis throughout \nthe life of the Project and integrate it with the existing management information system. Initially, \nthe monitoring system will develop and conduct sample surveys to establish baseline data for \nsubsequent performance monitoring, and will establish preproject social and economic living \nconditions for the direct project beneficiaries. These baseline surveys will be carried out within  \n1 year of the commencement of services of the supervision consultant and will ensure that \nsufficient  data  is  gathered  to  monitor  the  indicators  set  out  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework for the Project. A second survey will be carried out at project completion and a third \nafter a period of not less than 5 years after project completion. The baseline and impact surveys \nwill include appropriate control areas and assess all interventions under the Project, including \nresettlement and other safeguard interventions that affect the livelihood of project beneficiaries. \n                                                 \n18  ADB. 2006. Operations Manual. Section H4/BP: Retroactive Financing. Manila \n ", "14   \nIn addition, a set of indicators reflecting transport costs, tariffs, and mobility will be developed to \nassess the effects of improved access. District indicators will include agricultural productivity, \neconomic activity, and status of health and education. \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n43.  ADB, together with Government representatives, will undertake regular reviews of the \nProject at about 6-month intervals. At critical periods during implementation of the resettlement \nplans  and  EMPs,  ADB\u2019s  resettlement  and  environment  specialists  will  join  the  reviews.  In \naddition to these regular reviews a comprehensive midterm review of project implementation will \nbe carried out. This midterm review will allow for any necessary midcourse corrections. About 1 \nyear after project completion, a project completion review will document project achievements. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \n44.  Economic  Viability.  Improved  transport  infrastructure  is  critical  for  sustained  rapid \neconomic growth and poverty reduction, and can contribute to regionally balanced and equitable \neconomic growth by stimulating production of goods and increasing trade flows. The Project is \nthe  most  cost-effective  and  least-cost  option  to  accommodate  traffic  growth  in  HCMC  for \nvehicles traveling from the city center to the northeast. The principal direct benefits generated \nby construction of the HLD expressway will be (i) increased efficiency of the movement of goods \nand people in the area around HCMC, the provinces surrounding the city, and along the GMS \nsouthern and eastern economic corridors; (ii) reduced transport costs in the same area; and  \n(iii) reduced social and economic costs of traffic accidents. As transport costs are a key input to \neconomic  activities,  the  indirect  benefits  of  the  expressway  construction  include  increased \neconomic growth and support for the Government\u2019s overall poverty reduction program. Traffic \nvolume on existing roads in the project area has been increasing at about 7% per annum for \npassengers for the last 7 years and about 12% for freight. In certain sections, the capacity is \nsaturated. Approximately 30%\u201340% of the traffic on existing roads is forecast to be diverted to \nthe project expressway. The forecast daily traffic volume on the HCMC\u2013Long Thanh section, for \nexample, is expected to grow from 17,200 vehicles in 2013 to 30,400 vehicles in 2020, a 8.5% \naverage annual growth rate. It will then grow more slowly at 6.7% per annum to reach an \naverage of 42,000 vehicles in 2025 (Appendix 11). \n \n45.  The Project\u2019s economic internal rate of return was estimated by comparing the major \nroad networks of eastern HCMC with and without the Project. Without the Project, traffic will use \nthe existing road network, which will be congested and expensive to maintain because of rapidly \nincreasing traffic. With the Project, congestion on existing roads will be reduced, and traffic on \nboth the project expressway and existing roads will benefit from faster travel. The project \neconomic  costs  include  (i)  capital  costs  and  resettlement  costs,  excluding  tax  and  price \ncontingency; and (ii) the expressway\u2019s O&M cost. The project economic benefits are reduced \nvehicle operating cost and reduced passenger travel times, which will benefit traffic on the \nexpressway and traffic on existing roads. The Project yields an economic internal rate of return \nof 15.6%, indicating that it is economically viable. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of \nthe Project\u2019s economic viability. The capital cost would have to be 45.1% higher than projected, \nor project benefit 31.9% lower than projected, for the economic internal rate of return to fall \nbelow the cutoff rate of 12%. The economic analysis of the Project was extended to analyze the \ndistribution of project net benefits by determining the project effects for various beneficiaries, \nincluding  road  users,  laborers,  and  the  Government  (Appendix  11  and  Supplementary  \nAppendix C). One of the risks that would prevent realization of the full economic benefits of the \nexpressway is the use of the expressway by overloaded trucks. To address this risk the project \n ", "  15 \ndesign includes truck weigh-station facilities. Inflation in Viet Nam accelerated markedly in late \n2007 and early 2008 due to a combination of internal and external factors. The Project is \nunlikely to fuel inflation as the bulk of expenditures will be incurred from 2010 onward when \ninflation is expected to slow to single digits. In the medium to long term, the Project will help \ncontain inflation because it will reduce infrastructure bottlenecks and increase aggregate supply. \n \n46.  Financial Viability. The Project\u2019s financial viability was assessed by (i) determining the \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR), and (ii) analyzing the Project\u2019s financial statements. The \nfinancial viability in terms of the FIRR was assessed by comparing the Project\u2019s FIRR to the \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects (2005). The financial analysis examined the aggregated \ncosts and benefits from toll revenues of the highway, and is based on toll rates of D900 per \npassenger car unit per km. The FIRR of the Project was calculated for 2008 to 2033 using \nconstant  2007  prices. The  projected  financial  statements  for  the  Project  were prepared  in \ncurrent terms using the same period as the FIRR analysis. From this analysis, the Project\u2019s \nFIRR is estimated at 4.0% after tax, this exceeds the weighted average cost of capital, which is \ncalculated as 1.1%, indicating that the Project is financially viable. Sensitivity tests show that the \nFIRR exceeds the weighted average cost of capital even under a range of adverse scenarios. \nThe projected financial statements demonstrate that the Project will have enough retained cash \nto cover O&M costs and annual debt service. The FIRR calculation and the projected financial \nstatements are shown in Appendix 12 and Supplementary Appendix D. The proposed toll rate of \nD900 per passenger car unit per km is considered reasonable19 and affordable, given that \nHCMC is one of the most developed areas of Viet Nam. A review of the proposed toll rate will \nbe undertaken 6 months prior to the opening of the expressway. The review will confirm toll \nrates at opening that are consistent with the financial viability of the Project and meet the \nrequired financial ratios. It will take into account the review of toll regulations to be undertaken \nunder the HLD TA (footnote 7). \n \n47.  Financial Sustainability of VEC. VEC is currently processing or implementing three \nprojects: (i) the Cau Gie\u2013Ninh Binh Expressway Project (50 km, under construction); (ii) the Noi \nBai\u2013Lao Cai Expressway Project (244 km); and (iii) the proposed Project. The total capital \nexpenditures for these three projects will exceed $2.5 billion, with revenues to VEC projected to \ncommence in 2011 when operation of the Cau Gie\u2013Ninh Binh Expressway starts. The analysis \nof financial projections for VEC is based on these activities. This analysis assumes that VEC will \ncharge D900 per passenger car unit per km for the Project and that this will be adjusted to \naccount for inflation. The results show that VEC will have net operating losses until 2016 \nbecause toll revenue will not be sufficient to cover depreciation costs and interest in the initial \noperation stage. However, VEC can maintain positive accumulated cash flow throughout the \noperating period to cover debt service. A net operating profit will be generated from 2017, or  \n7 years from the commencement of operations, on the assumption of a gradual increase in \ntraffic volume. The estimated debt to equity ratio will be 95:5 in 2013, and improve to 77:23 in \n2022 as a result of increased retained earnings. Despite its large-scale investments, VEC will be \nfinancially viable in the medium and long term without additional subsidies during expressway \noperation. VEC needs to establish a financial information system to ensure that investments \ntarget  financially  sustainable  expressway  projects,  through  which  VEC  may  monitor  cost \nrecovery, plan traffic forecasts and toll rates, make projected financial statements, and develop \na debt management strategy. A system to meet this need is to be designed and commissioned \nunder the HLD TA (footnote 7). Financial and institutional analyses of VEC are provided in \nAppendix 13 and financial projections of the Project and VEC are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n                                                 \n19  The toll rate adopted for the Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Expressway (footnote 14) was D800 per passenger car unit per km. \n ", "16   \n \n48.  Environmental Impacts. The project area does not include any sensitive areas such as \nnational parks, protected areas, or special use forests within or near the proposed alignment. \nEndangered,  threatened,  or  rare  species  of  flora  and  fauna  have  not  been  found.  The \nconstruction of the HLD expressway is not anticipated to cause any major change to the present \necological situation. Predicted environmental impacts during construction include air pollution, \nmainly due to dust emission; noise and vibration; water pollution due to fuel spills and improper \nwaste disposal; soil erosion and siltation of water courses due to earthworks and extraction of \nborrow  materials;  and  temporary  obstructions  of  river  flow.  Impacts  during  operation  are \nexpected to be limited to air and noise pollution due to vehicular emissions, and potential water \npollution due to accidents involving transportation of chemicals and other hazardous materials. \nLand use within the project area is dominated by tree plantations (mainly rubber) and paddy \nfields; significant impacts to flora and fauna are not anticipated.  \n \n49.  The  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  EIA  for  the  construction  phase  include  \n(i) treatment of sewage at construction camps and discharge from work sites, and mixing and \ncrushing plants; (ii) dust suppression measures; (iii) maintenance of construction equipment and \nvehicles; (iv) restoration of borrow areas; (v) restriction of high noise activities to daylight hours; \n(vi) installation of temporary noise walls or boards at sensitive sites; (vii) coordination with local \nauthorities on collection and disposal of waste and surplus soil; (viii) provision of concrete \npavement and oil separator in fuel storage sites; (ix) locating crushing and mixing plants away \nfrom sensitive sites; and (x) implementation of slope stabilization measures. The civil works \ncontractors will undertake these mitigation measures, while VEC, with the assistance of the \nsupervision  consultant  will  monitor  the  contractor\u2019s  environmental  performance.  During \noperation, air pollution can be minimized by ensuring a steady flow of traffic and avoiding \ncongestion.  VEC  will  cooperate  with  the  local  authorities  to  ensure  enforcement  of  road \nregulations. Two rows of trees will be planted on each side of the expressway to help minimize \nnoise and the spread of dust. Where the HLD expressway passes through residential areas in \nLong Thanh, sound-insulating walls will be constructed to reduce noise. VEC will prepare an \nemergency action plan for use during expressway operation to address accidents involving \nchemicals and other hazardous materials.  \n \n50.  During detailed design of the expressway, being undertaken under the ADB-funded HLD \nTA (footnote 7), the design consultants will update the EMP and incorporate in the project \ndesign relevant mitigation measures identified in the EMP. VEC will ensure that (i) bidding \ndocuments for the civil works include contract clauses requiring the contractor to implement the \nEMP, (ii) contractors prepare a site-specific EMP based on the actual situation on-site and the \nEMP prepared for the Project, and (iii) the EMP is properly implemented during different project \nphases. Provided the mitigation measures defined in the EMP are implemented appropriately \nbefore and during construction, and throughout the expressway operation, the Project will not \nresult in significant environmental impacts. \n \n51.  Social Impacts. The HLD expressway will be constructed within HCMC and Dong Nai \nProvince, one of the least poor provinces in the country with a poverty rate of 10.33% (Viet Nam \nHousehold Living Standard Survey 2002). Given the low rate of poverty in the project area, and \nthat the expressway is intended to serve long distance traffic, the Project will have limited direct \nimpact  on  poverty  reduction  in  communities  living  along  the  expressway.  Even  though \nexpressways generally do not directly address local poverty, they do address it indirectly by \nfacilitating continued economic growth. Improved transport infrastructure is critical for sustained \nrapid economic growth and overall poverty reduction, and can contribute to regionally balanced \n ", "  17 \nand equitable economic growth by stimulating agriculture production and increasing access to \nemployment opportunities.  \n \n52.  The Project\u2019s social impacts relate to (i) displacing local residents because of land \nacquisition; (ii) losing productive land; (iii) dividing local communities and disrupting the local \nroad network: (iv) increasing traffic risks for people living and working along the highway due to \nthe large volume of traffic and higher vehicle speeds along the highway; and (v) increasing risks \nof  exposure  to  HIV  and  trafficking  of  women  and  children  during  construction  and \npostconstruction phases due to the large volume of transit traffic along the highway. Unless \ncompensation, income restoration measures, and livelihood activities relating to involuntary \nresettlement are delivered on time; these can pose significant risk to the livelihoods of project-\naffected households. The Project is formulated to minimize potential risks. A full resettlement \nplan was prepared that includes compensation and allowances for households that will be \nimpacted by land acquisition and resettlement activities, and an income restoration plan for \npeople who have been significantly affected. Land acquisition for expressway construction can \ndivide existing communities and disrupt existing local transport networks, which could have an \nimpact on the livelihood of local communities. During the detail project design, consultation with \nlocal residents will be undertaken to ensure that underpasses and overpasses are provided. \nThese  will  maintain  the  functions  of  existing  local  roads  and  irrigation  systems  during \nconstruction and operation, and minimize disruption to local peoples' livelihood systems and \nsocial networks.  \n \n53.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The involuntary resettlement category for the \nProject is category A. VEC, together with the local officials of HCMC and Dong Nai Province, \nprepared a full resettlement plan based on the socioeconomic and inventory of losses surveys. \nA summary of the resettlement plan is in Appendix 4, and the full resettlement plan is in \nSupplementary  Appendix  A.  Consultations,  public  meetings,  and  village  discussions  with \naffected  households  and  local  officials  were  carried  out  during  the  resettlement  planning \nprocess. These activities will continue during updating and implementation. DCCs have been \nestablished in HCMC and Dong Nai Province. The DCCs, together with VEC, will update the \napproved resettlement plan based on detailed design of the highway; and implement land \nacquisition, resettlement, livelihood restoration, and income-restoration activities. The estimated \nresettlement cost is $186.05 million, of which about $157.58 million will be required for land \nacquisition and $28.47 million for resettlement allowances and compensation. VEC will be \nresponsible for internal monitoring of resettlement activities, and contract an external monitoring \nagency for independent monitoring and evaluation. The internal and external monitoring reports \nwill be uploaded to VEC\u2019s website, submitted to ADB every quarter, and uploaded to ADB\u2019s \nwebsite  until  the  resettlement  and  income  restoration  programs  are  complete.  The  project \nsupervision consultants will provide formal and on-the-job training to VEC and the DCCs. \n \n54.  HIV and Human Trafficking. In 2003, HCMC residents accounted for 25% of all HIV \ninfections in the country. The city has the fastest growing epidemic in the country with HIV \nprevalence among adults aged 15\u201329 estimated to be about 1.2%, making this one of the worst \nepidemics in Viet Nam. The number of infected females relative to males is increasing each \nyear, indicating increasing heterosexual transmission.20 The influx of construction workers in the \nProject during construction and increased volume of transit traffic in the postconstruction period \nwill  increase  the  risk  of  HIV  and  human  trafficking.  With  improved  transportation  and \ninfrastructure, existing risks and vulnerabilities for HIV transmission, drug use, and trafficking \n                                                 \n20  Ministry of Health, General Department of Preventative Medicine and HIV/AIDS Control. 2005.

Hanoi, Viet Nam. \n ", "18   \nalong  the  highway  will  significantly  increase  if  targeted  risk  mitigation  initiatives  are  not \nimplemented. Reports from nongovernment organizations and aid organizations indicate that \nthe rate of human trafficking from the south to HCMC is high. To mitigate these risks, an HIV \nawareness and prevention of human trafficking program is included in the Project to minimize \nexposure of the local population to these issues (a summary of the program is in Supplementary \nAppendix  E).  The  program  includes  capacity  building  of  VEC,  awareness  campaigns  in \nconstruction camps and communities in the project districts, development of peer educators, \ncommunity monitoring, and distribution of medical equipment to relevant health facilities. Also \nincluded  are  community  awareness  programs  on  human  trafficking,  safe  migration,  and \ncommunity  monitoring.  It  will  be  managed  by  the  construction  supervision  consultant;  a \nsummary of the terms of reference is in Appendix 9. \n \n55.  Ethnic Minorities. The overwhelming majority of the population within the project area \nis from the main ethnic group, the Kinh. Of the 800 households affected by resettlement, only 11 \nbelong to an ethnic minority. These 11 households are disbursed across the project districts; are \nliving within Kinh communities; and are well-integrated within mainstream Vietnamese society in \nterms of language, clothing, housing, and daily livelihood activities. A specific action for these 11 \nhouseholds is included in the resettlement plan.  \n \n56.  Gender. The resettlement impact on poor women and households headed by women \ncould be significant. Poor women and women who head households in the project area are at \nmore risk economically (loss of productive assets due to land acquisition) and socially (risks \nposed by HIV, road safety, and possible human trafficking) than males. To address loss of \nlivelihood of poor women and households headed by women, the resettlement plan includes a \nlivelihood program targeted at women in the project districts. A project-specific gender strategy \nwas  prepared  and  is  described  in  the  summary  of  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy \n(Appendix  14).  The  gender  strategy  includes  capacity-building  training  and  consultation \nworkshops  with  those  affected  to  increase  their  understanding  of  resettlement  issues \n(compensation, entitlements, and grievance procedures) and to develop skills for appropriate \nlivelihood activities.  \n \n57.  Road  Safety.  The  expressway  is  expected  to  provide  road  users  with  a  safe \nenvironment compared to normal roads. However, for this benefit to be realized, users must \nmake  behavioral  changes  to  adapt  to  the  high  speed,  limited  access  environment  of  an \nexpressway. To address these and other road safety issues, a road safety awareness campaign \nand road safety audits are included in the tasks for the construction supervision consultant. \n \n58.  Project  Implementation.  The  main  risk  to  the  Project  is  delayed  implementation \nbecause of slow finalization of detailed designs and procurement of civil works contracts. This is \nbeing addressed through the project preparation work undertaken under the HLD TA (footnote \n7). This work includes all activities required to advance the commencement of construction. A \nfurther  risk  is  VEC\u2019s  limited  capacity  and  experience  with  project  management  for  major \nprojects. This risk is being mitigated through the HLD TA component to address regulatory and \ninstitutional strengthening of VEC. Under this component, a revised organization structure will \nbe prepared for VEC to address future needs of VEC as an efficient provider of infrastructure \nservices.

The Road Network \n \n1.  The total length of the Viet Nam road system is about 251,786 kilometers (km), of which \nonly 32.0% is sealed pavement. While national and provincial roads provide the key links in the \nroad network, in 2004 only 44.8% of the total length of national roads was reported as being in \ngood condition. The existing national road system was mainly constructed with two lanes; only \nlimited lengths near major urban areas were constructed with four lanes. Only 3.9% of the \nnational road network has four lanes; 66% has two or three lanes. Table A2.1 shows the road \nsystem by administrative category. \n \nTable A2.1: Viet Nam Road System \n \nRoad Classification  With Pavement  Without Pavement \n      Sealed  Unsealed       \nType  Classa  Km  Asphalt  Concrete  Macadam  %  Aggregate  %  Earth  Other  % \nNational  QL  17,295.0  7,650.2  344.3  6,447.0  84  2,853.5  16  0.0  0.0  0 \nProvincial  DT  23,137.5  3,474.0  700.7  11,030.2  66  4,816.4  21  3,072.5  43.7  13 \nDistrict  DH  54,961.9  1,761.7  2,581.3  10,992.1  28  15,881.7  29  20,144.6  3,600.5  43 \nUrban  DDT  8,535.6  2,465.0  776.4  2,750.4  70  976.3  11  1,567.5  0.0  18 \nCommune  DX  141,442.1  1,615.9  18,442.3  9,226.0  21  34,896.6  25  77,261.3  0.0  55 \nSpecial  DCD  6,414.4  314.1  160.4  546.5  16  2,593.2  40  2,800.2  0.0  44 \nTotal    251,786.5  17,280.9  23,005.4  40,992.2  32  62,017.7  25  104,846.1  3,644.2  43 \nkm = kilometer. \na For example: National road 1A is referred to as QL1A, provincial road 7 is referred to as DT7 \nSource: Viet Nam Road Administration, Ministry of Transport, 2006. \n \n2.  The average speed of vehicles is 50 km per hour (km/h) for trucks and 60 km/h for buses \nand cars. The complex traffic conditions cause many problems such as poor safety, limited \nvehicle speed, and low capacity. Motorbikes have increased at more than 20% per year, and \ntotaled over 11 million in 2003 (140 per 1,000 people). The number of four-wheel drive vehicles \nand articulated trucks grew slightly faster than gross domestic product, from 400,000 in 1997 to \n600,000 in 2002 (7.5 vehicles per 1,000 population). Trucks comprise 30% of the fleet; 80% of \nthem are small to medium size and only 10% are modern articulated trucks.  \n \nB.  Road Administration \n \n3.  Administration of the highways is determined by the administrative category of the road. \nNational, provincial, district, urban (cities and towns), and commune authorities administer the \ncorresponding category of road. National responsibility for the road network lies with the Viet \nNam Road Administration under the Ministry of Transport (MOT). However, in 2004, Vietnam \nExpressway Corporation (VEC) was established under MOT to develop expressways. \n \nC.  Road Safety \n \n4.  Poor road safety is a serious and growing problem throughout Viet Nam\u201414,161 road \ndeaths were reported in 2006, equivalent to about 7 deaths per annum per 10,000 vehicles. \nThis was a marginal increase from 2005. Fatality rates for Viet Nam are very high, even in \ncomparison with many neighboring countries in southeast Asia, and new initiatives in road \npolicy and management are urgently required. Most road deaths (60%) occurred on national \nhighways, but the number of accidents and deaths on provincial roads is increasing. The major \ncauses of traffic accidents are speeding, misuse of drugs, and not following traffic regulations. \n ", "    Appendix 2  25 \nAdditional factors are the mix of different vehicle types using individual roads, particularly that of \nhigh- and low-speed vehicles sharing the same facility, and poor road traffic management. The \nGovernment  established  an  interministerial  national  traffic  safety  program  to  address  road \nsafety initiatives where roles and budget are allocated to each ministry concerned. Under this \nprogram, campaigns are being undertaken to promote enforcement of traffic laws, road traffic \nsafety, and regulation of the sale and use of motorcycles. However, this program has only had \nlimited effect.1 Full access-controlled highways (essentially expressways) can address some \naspects of the road safety problem as (i) they are targeted at high-speed long-distance traffic, \nso slower local traffic does not have access; and (ii) access is restricted to a limited number of \njunctions, with each junction designed to allow safe entry and exit of traffic. \n \nD.  Vietnam Expressway Corporation \n \n4.  VEC was established in October 2004 under MOT to develop expressways in Viet Nam. \nUnder Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) for the Expressway Network \nDevelopment Plan,2 a review was undertaken of the (i) government policies, laws, regulations, \ndecrees, circulars, and charters relevant to VEC; (ii) current organization structure of VEC, \nincluding the role and responsibilities of each VEC department and division, segregation of duty, \nand staffing; and (iii) VEC\u2019s future organization development plan. The study identified several \nissues that must be addressed, and are discussed in this appendix. Further information on the \ninstitutional structure and financial management at VEC are given in Appendix 13. \n \n1.  Organization  \n \n5.  VEC was established with an organization structure intended for the start-up phase. As \nof  January  2007,  VEC  was  implementing  two  construction  projects  and  had  management \nsystems in place for these. Tolling operations are limited to two toll plazas.  VEC does not have \nany expressway operation and maintenance contracts in place; is not providing any additional \nsupport  activities  to  expressways,  such  as  roadside  facilities;  and  has  not  implemented \nprocesses to enable public\u2013private partnerships. Further, VEC has limited capacity to manage \nthe  social  and  environmental  impacts  of  the  expressways.  To  administer  the  proposed \nexpressway program, VEC needs to expand its capacity to enable it to manage several large \ncomplex projects and to take on new activities in terms of additional skills. \n \n6.  VEC was established as a fully owned state-owned enterprise under MOT. However, the \nLaw  on  State  Enterprises,  2003,  requires  all  state-owned  enterprises  be  converted  into  a \ncompany operating under the Law on Enterprises before 2010. VEC is expected to operate as a \nregulator and owner of the expressway network and as a supplier of various services. These \ndemands require revision of the organization structure, particularly to separate the roles of \nregulator and supplier within VEC. The revisions recommended by the Expressway Network \nDevelopment Plan report3 need to be refined for implementation. \n \n2.  Legal and Regulatory Framework \n \n7.  The  Expressway  Network  Development  Plan  TA  reviewed  legal  and  regulatory \ndocuments that apply to expressways. The study identified several issues to be addressed \n                                                 \n1  Japan Bank for International Cooperation. 2003.

Of \nparticular concern is Circular 90, covering toll regimes for roads. As presently formulated, this \ncircular is very restrictive in terms of ceilings on toll rates, which may have consequences for the \nfinancial viability of some expressways. The TA also recommends how this circular could be \nrevised to accommodate more flexible toll arrangements. \n \n3.  Training Needs \n \n8.  Given that VEC is a new organization, many staff require training to fully engage in their \nroles and responsibilities. The Expressway Network Development Plan TA undertook an initial \nassessment of training needs; a detailed program to address training needs is to be prepared \nonce work on the revised organization structure is complete. \n \n4.  Financial and Asset Management Systems \n \n9.  VEC currently uses standard accounting software to record all financial transactions. \nHowever, a financial management system is needed to allow data to be accessed and analyzed \nto meet needs other than formal financial reporting. The Expressway Network Development \nPlan TA identified a need for an asset management system. \n \nE.  The Expressway Master Plan \n \n10.  Under The Expressway Network Development Plan TA, ADB provided funding to assist \nthe Government in preparing an expressway master plan for a national expressway system. The \nplan identifies a logical national network of expressways and prioritizes the construction of each \nsection based on economic and financial viability.  \n \n11.  The existing national road system was mainly constructed with two lanes, and a small \npart with four lanes. Traffic growth predictions vary across the country, but with short-term \ngrowth of 7%\u201310% (to 2015), traffic volume is set to grow significantly. Given that critical \nsections of the existing network are already congested, the capacity of the network needs to be \nexpanded rapidly to accommodate additional traffic. Design standards for expressways differ \nfrom normal roads, as they are targeted at allowing a large number of vehicles to move freely \nbetween major centers, at speed, and with a high degree of safety. The proposed expressway \nnetwork will provide high-capacity highways that will connect key economic zones, large urban \ncenters, industrial zones, and international borders. The master plan proposes that the main \nfeatures of the network be two north\u2013south expressway axes, and six east\u2013west expressway \naxes, together with 14 expressway sections that provide access around major centers. The \nshort-term program (2006\u20132015) includes 21 priority expressway projects covering 1,968 km, \nwith an estimated construction cost of $11.556 billion.4 A medium-term program (2016\u20132025) is \nproposed that includes another 8 projects covering an additional 875 km, with an estimated \nconstruction cost of $5.238 billion.

Project Background \n1.  The Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC)\u2013Long Thanh\u2013Dau Giay Expressway Project is intended \nto provide a safe and secure road for high-speed (120 kilometers/hour) vehicles, especially \nheavy vehicles. The expressway will be constructed as a tolled four-lane facility (two lanes in \neach direction), with access initially restricted to three locations: the intersection with Ring Road \n2, the intersection with National Highway 51 (QL51) at the southern end of Long Thanh town, \nand at Dau Giay. \n \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n \n2.  The Project will require acquisition of 307 hectares (ha) of land (HCMC 62 ha and Dong \nNai 245 ha). The census and inventory of losses identified the following:    \n \n(i)  A total of 975 households will be affected, of which 167 are in District 9 of HCMC \nand  808  are  in  the  four  districts  of  Dong  Nai  Province.  Of  the  affected \nhouseholds, 31 in HCMC will lose more than 10% of their productive assets while \nin Dong Nai Province, 392 households will lose more than 10%. With regard to \nrelocation, 309 households will have to relocate to new plots of residential land \nas their land will be totally affected or they will be left with a portion that will no \nlonger be viable; 246 households will have remaining residential land and can \nmove back. \n(ii)  Three  rubber  plantation  companies,  commune  culverts,  15  irrigation  canals, \nchurch land with a prayer house, and transmission towers (3 tower foundations) \nwill be affected.  \n \nC.  Legal and Policy Framework   \n \n3.  The legal and policy framework for compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation under \nthe Project is defined by the relevant laws and regulations of the Government and ADB policies. \nIn case of discrepancies between the Borrower\u2019s laws, regulations, and procedures, and ADB's \npolicies and requirements; ADB's policies and requirements will prevail, consistent with Decree \nNo. 131/2006/ND-CP: which provides that in case of \u201cdiscrepancy between any provision in an \ninternational treaty on Official Development Assistance (ODA), to which the Socialist Republic of \nViet Nam is a signatory, and the Vietnamese Law, the provision in the international treaty on \nODA shall take precedence\u201d (Article 2, Item 5). \n \nD.  Project Entitlements   \n \n4.  A summary of project entitlements are presented in Table A4.1 and correspond to the \nimpacts identified during the census and inventory of losses. Assistance with regard to amount \nof cash allowances or additional support (in cash or in kind) will depend on the severity of \nimpact  and  the  specific  needs  of  households.  These  entitlements  may  be  enhanced,  as \nnecessary, following the conduct of the detailed measurement survey and consultation with \naffected persons to ensure that losses are restored, or the situation is improved. Monitoring will \nbe done regularly and modifications of the program and additional cash and material assistance \nto the affected households will be provided as and when necessary. \n \n ", "30  Appendix 4   \nTable 4.1: Summary Entitlement Matrix \n \nImpacts  Entitlements \nPermanent acquisition of  For legal and legalizable owners of land and those covered by customary \nland   rights, replacement land or cash compensation at replacement cost (i.e., \ncurrent market value, productive value, and similar location attributes). \nLessees of private land are to cover rent and allocation of suitable \nreplacement land that the lessor can lease.   \nStructures, crops, and trees  All owners of structures will be paid based on current market prices of \n(irrespective of tenure status)  materials and labor with no depreciation or deductions for salvageable \nmaterials. For poor and vulnerable households with less than the value of \na class-4 house, will be given additional cash assistance to improve the \nnew house to meet the minimum standard house in the area. Landless \nhouseholds will be provided with a plot of land at no cost to the \nhousehold. \nUnharvested crops will be compensated based on current market value; \ntrees will be paid based on type, age, and productive capacity. \nPublic facilities   Cash compensation to cover the cost of restoring the facilities, including \nirrigation system. Prayer house will be relocated in culturally sensitive and \nappropriate way.  \nSevere loss of income and/or  In addition to the compensation for affected land, rehabilitation measures \nlivelihood due to loss of 10%  will include taking part in the income restoration programs that will be \nor more of total productive  designed and implemented in close consultation with the affected \nland and income sources  persons. Various transition allowances will be provided while they are in \n(irrespective of tenure status)  the process of restoring preproject income (while the affected households \nare taking part in income restoration programs) sufficient to provide the \nminimum basic needs of the households.    \nLoss of income and/or  For relocating households, various allowance will include materials \nlivelihood due to relocation of  transport, transition subsistence, and bonus for timely moving. For \nhouses and shops  relocating shops, business disruption allowance will be provided to cover \n(irrespective of tenure status)  income loss during reestablishment of the business. For employees, cash \nassistance equivalent will be provided to cover loss of salary while \nbusiness is being established.   \nHigher risks of  These persons are entitled to take part in income restoration program and \nimpoverishment and/or  will be provided an additional support allowance while taking part in the \nhardship due to loss of  program. Cash allowance for households as per Government regulation \nresource base of vulnerable  (social policy households, heroic mothers, wounded, dead soldiers). \ngroups regardless of severity \nof impacts \nTemporary impacts  Monthly rent will be paid for use of nonproductive land. If productive land, \nno less than the net income that would have been derived from the \naffected property will be paid. Land will be promptly restored to its \npreproject condition at no cost to the affected household.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nE.  Relocation of Households \n \n5.  In  HCMC,  the  majority  of  affected  households  interviewed  and  participating  in  the \nmeetings prefer to receive cash compensation at replacement cost and find replacement land \non their own as there is a well developed, active land market in the project area. In Dong Nai \nProvince, four relocation sites in four communes were identified with sufficient capacity to \naccommodate  the  number  of  relocating  households  and  to  respond  to  the  households\u2019 \npreference to move to relocation sites. Local officials and households that opted for cash \ncompensation  are  optimistic  that  affected  households  opting  to  self-relocate  will  not  have \ndifficulty finding a replacement for their lost land as the land market for both productive and \n ", "    Appendix 4  31 \nresidential land is good. Given this, the Project will ensure that compensation given for affected \nland is at replacement cost at the time of disbursement of payment. If during updating of the \nresettlement plan, the suitability of new or potential sites initially identified will be reevaluated \nand included in the updated resettlement plan. Affected households will not be displaced until \nthe commune or ward allocates land acceptable to them and until affected households receive \nall compensation and allowances due to them. \n \nF.  Income Restoration \n \n6.  As a result of consultation with local authorities, various organizations and affected \nhouseholds,  various  farm-  and  nonfarm-based  activities  and  programs  were  identified  for \nconsideration in the planning of a responsive income restoration program. During the detailed \nmeasurement  survey,  the  Project  will  help  design  and  implement  the  income  restoration \nprogram. It will lead the process of identifying the livelihood activities of each household by \nevaluating the household\u2019s specific needs against the household\u2019s preferences, inclination, and \npreparedness; and assessing the availability of external support needed by the household to \npursue  its  chosen  livelihood  activities.  In  addition  to  the  principles  governing  the  project \nresettlement policy, the income restoration program will abide by the following precepts: be \nresponsive  to  the  specific  needs  and  attuned  to  the  preparedness  of  the  household;  be \nsustainable  and  geared  toward  self-determination  and  empowerment;  foster  justice  and \nfairness, camaraderie, and social consciousness; and be gender sensitive and environmentally \nsound. Monitoring will be done regularly and the programs modified as necessary. \n \nG.  Participation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n \n7.  Consultations, public meetings, and village discussions with affected persons and local \nofficials were carried out during the resettlement planning process. Project policies and options \nwith regard to relocation and income restoration were discussed during the meetings. Concerns \nand suggestions raised by the affected people were incorporated in the initial resettlement plan. \nThe grievance mechanism is designed to ensure that the concerns and grievances of those \naffected are addressed and resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner. People affected will be \nmade fully aware of their rights verbally and in writing during consultation, survey, and at the \ntime of compensation. The key information in the initial resettlement plan was disclosed to those \naffected prior to the ADB appraisal mission. \n \nH.  Ethnicity and Gender Issues \n \n8.  Separate meetings were held with ethnic minority households and those headed by \nwomen. Members of 11 ethnic minority households were found to have similar living standards \nas Kinh people. The 277 households headed by women were consulted during the planning \nprocess.  Specific  actions  for  ethnic  minorities  and  a  gender  strategy  are  included  in  the \nresettlement  plan;  these  include  active  participation  of  women  and  ethnic  minorities  from \nconsultation to monitoring, representation of women and ethnic minorities in compensation \ncommittees,  capacity-building  targeting  of  women  and  ethnic  minorities,  engagement  of  a \ngender  specialist  during  updating  and  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan,  and \ndevelopment of monitoring indicators by gender and ethnic minority. \n \nI.  Implementation Arrangements   \n \n9.  The  Executing  Agency for  the  Project  will  be the  Vietnam  Expressway  Corporation \n(VEC). VEC will delegate responsibility for day-to-day project implementation to the Southern \n ", "32  Appendix 4   \nExpressway Project Management Unit (SEPMU). SEPMU is based in HCMC and will establish \ntwo field offices in District 9 of HCMC, and in Long Thanh district, Dong Nai Province. SEPMU \nhas a land acquisition and resettlement unit, headed by the SEPMU deputy-director. SEPMU \nhas assigned four staff to represent VEC on a full-time basis in the district compensation \ncommittees. In addition, one accountant will be responsible in administering and monitoring loan \nfunds for land acquisition and resettlement.   \n \nJ.  Implementation Schedule   \n \n10.  The  resettlement  plan  will  be  updated  by  district  following  detailed  design.  All \nresettlement activities will be coordinated with the civil works schedule. Land acquisition and \nrelocation  of  affected  households  cannot  commence  until  ADB  reviews  and  approves  the \nupdated resettlement plan. VEC will not allow construction activities in specific sites until all \nresettlement activities have been satisfactorily completed, agreed rehabilitation assistance is in \nplace, and the site is free of all encumbrances. Updating of the resettlement plan is expected to \ncommence in August 2008.  \n \nTable A4.2: Schedule of Resettlement Activities \n \nActivities  Schedule \nResettlement plan dating (following detailed design)  Aug 2008\u2013Dec 2008 \nSubmission of updated resettlement plans  Nov 2008\u2013Jan 2009  \nImplementation of updated resettlement plans  Dec 2008\u2013Jan 2010 \nMonitoring (internal and external)  Aug 2008\u2013Jan 2010 \nPostevaluation   June 2011 \nStart of civil works   Dec 2008  \nSource: Asian Development Bank Estimates. \n \nK.  Resettlement Plan Budget and Monitoring  \n \n11.  The estimated cost of implementing the resettlement plan is $186.05 million. The cost of \nland acquisition and resettlement for the entire Project will be funded from the ADB loan. \nSecond generation imprest accounts (SGIAs) will be established in HCMC and in each district of \nDong Nai Province at a commercial bank acceptable to the Government and ADB. The SGIAs \nwill be operated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). Use of the SGIAs will be limited to providing funds for (i) affected persons for \nland and other assets acquired to facilitate the construction of the HLD Expressway; (ii) affected \npersons for resettlement compensation and allowances as set out in the approved updated \nresettlement  plan;  (iii)  relocation  site  development  and  income  restoration  program,  and  \n(iv) incremental expenses incurred by the district compensation committees for implementation \nof the updated resettlement plan. \n \n12.  VEC and compensation committees, with the help of project consultants, will set up a \nsystem to ensure that channeling of funds is done transparently, efficiently, and effectively; that \nmonitoring is in place; and that resettlement audit reports are submitted in a timely manner. \nADB staff will have the right to conduct spot or random checks of expenditures covered by the \nSGIAs.

Land use along most of this route comprises dense \ndevelopments of mixed residential and commercial use, while in Bien Hoa the route passes \nlarge industrial parks. Widening the existing highway would require large-scale clearance of \nexisting structures that would be socially unacceptable and very expensive, given that much of \nthe developments are in what are considered to be prime locations. Due to the magnitude of the \nsocial impacts alone, widening the existing highway is not feasible, and any increase in highway \ncapacity must be provided by constructing a new facility. The project preparatory technical \nassistance  considered  various  mutually  exclusive  project  alternatives  such  as  different \npavement types, horizontal and vertical road alignments, alternative bridge designs, culverts, \nunderpasses,  and  overpasses.  The  Ho  Chi  Minh  City\u2013Long  Thanh\u2013Dau  Giay  Expressway \nConstruction Project is based on the most cost-effective and least-cost option of those that are \ntechnically feasible, and socially and environmentally acceptable. \n \nB.  Traffic Forecast \n \n2.  The Project will serve as a new link between HCMC and Dau Giay, and provide access \nto the proposed Long Thanh international airport. The Project will provide a shorter route for the \nexisting  HCMC\u2013Bien  Hua\u2013Long  Thanh  and  Long  Thanh\u2013Bien  Hua\u2013Dau  Giay  routes.  The \nProject\u2019s traffic demand was forecast for 25 years for without-project and with-project scenarios. \nBaseline routine traffic counts were determined at three locations (HCMC, Long Thanh, and \nDau Giay) along the proposed project route. Roadside interviews were undertaken at two sites \nfor origin\u2013destination and willingness-to-pay surveys. The origin\u2013destination survey found that \n50%\u201380% of users of the existing roads would use the expressway if no toll was applied. For \nthe with-project scenario, an expressway toll rate of D900 per passenger car unit per km was \nassumed, giving the highest revenue over the appraisal period. Trip assignment was carried out \nby allocating interzonal trips to various travel routes within the road network. The routes were \nselected according to the lowest travel cost, comprising travel time, vehicle operating cost, and \nthe project expressway toll. The willingness-to-pay survey showed that 53% of those who would \nuse the expressway with a zero toll would still use the expressway at a toll rate of D900 per \npassenger car unit per km. As a result, about 30%\u201340% of the traffic on the parallel highways \n(QL1 and 51) would divert to the project expressway. \n \n3.  Traffic demand was projected by taking into account expected increases in the gross \ndomestic product (GDP) and estimated elasticity of passenger and freight transport with respect \nto GDP growth. The GDP growth rates were projected to be 10% for 2007\u20132010, 8% for 2011\u2013\n2020, and 6% for 2021\u20132030. Demand elasticity for passenger and freight traffic to GDP was \nestimated based on a regression analysis for the three provinces nearest the Project. An \nallowance was made in the risk analysis (para. 8) for variations of traffic growth to take account \nof possible variations in the values of the elasticity of demand selected. Given this, the values \nadopted for elasticity of demand are considered appropriate. The traffic demand of the proposed \nLong Thanh international airport, starting operation in 2015, was incorporated into the forecasts. \nThe new airport will handle all international passengers in southern Viet Nam and about 10% of \n ", "46  Appendix 11   \ndomestic passengers. The traffic forecast for the project expressway is shown in Table A11.1. \nThe forecast traffic volume from 2013 to 2020 is expected to grow at 8.1%\u20138.5% annually. It will \nthen grow more slowly at 6.4%\u20136.6% per annum from 2021 to 2025.   \n \nTable A11.1: Traffic Forecast on the Project Expressway \n(average annual daily traffic) \n \nPassenger  Freight  Average Annual \nTotal \nYear  Car  Small  Large  Small  Medium  Large  Growth Rate \nVehicles \nBus  Bus  Truck  Truck  Truck  (%) \n \nHCMC\u2013Long Thanh \n \n2013  3,913  4,534  1,828  2,795  2,301  1,830  17,201   \n2020  7,250  7,855  2,998  5,026  4,071  3,201  30,401  8.5 (2013\u201320) \n2025  10,022  10,466  3,954  6,969  5,621  4,406  41,438  6.4 (2021\u201325) \n2030  10,110  10,295  3,873  7,061  5,685  4,451  41,475  0.0 (2026\u201330) \n                 \n \nLong Thanh\u2013Dau Giay \n \n                 \n2013  1,874  2,770  1,273  2,075  2,149  1,337  11,477   \n2020  3,406  4,616  2,051  3,671  3,770  2,335  19,848  8.1 (2013\u201320) \n2025  4,746  6,192  2,737  5,138  5,265  3,258  27,337  6.6 (2021\u201325) \n2030  6,293  7,970  3,520  6,827  6,986  4,320  35,915  5.6 (2026\u201330) \n                 \nSources: Vietnam Expressway Corporation and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC.  Valuation of Costs and Benefits \n \n4.  The Project\u2019s economic costs include (i) capital costs, including physical contingency, \nland acquisition, and resettlement costs, but excluding taxes and price contingency; and (ii) the \noperation and maintenance costs including periodic road maintenance. The financial costs were \nrevalued at economic prices by separating the cost items into tradable and nontradable goods \nand services. The tradable goods and services were converted to the domestic price numeraire \nusing a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.04. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.55 was used to \nconvert the financial wage rate for unskilled labor to an economic opportunity cost of labor.   \n \n5.  The economic benefits include savings in vehicle operating cost (VOC), passenger time \nsavings on the project expressway, and passenger time savings on the existing road network of \nthe project area. Reduced VOC is the main source of economic benefits for the Project. VOC \nwas calculated for eight vehicle types using the Highway Development and Management Model \n4 (HDM-4), taking into account the differences of terrain, road alignment, road roughness, and \ntravel speed. Traffic diverting from existing roads to the project expressway would travel at \nfaster speeds on a smoother road surface, with better vertical and horizontal alignment, less \ncongestion, and a shorter journey distance. Traffic remaining on the existing road network will \nbenefit from a reduction in traffic volume and congestion. All these changes affect vehicle \nspeeds  and  VOC  for  all  vehicle  types.  Savings  in  travel  time  will  occur  on  the  project \nexpressway and the existing road network. After completion of the Project, the travel time \nbetween Dau Giay and HCMC is expected to be 0.65 hours\u2014a reduction of about 1.0 hour. The \nvalues of travel time savings (Table A11.2) were used to estimate the benefit of reduced travel \ntimes. Work-related travel time, which accounts for 30% of total travel time, was evaluated for \npassenger cars and motorcycles, and 25% of total travel time was evaluated as work-related for \nthe buses. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.55 was applied to unskilled labor. Non-work-related \ntrips were estimated at 30% of the value of work-related trips. \n ", "    Appendix 11  47 \n \nTable A11.2: Value of Travel Time \n \nSmall  Large \nItem  Motorcycle Car \nBus  Bus \n         \nAverage passenger time cost ($/hour)  0.22  0.75 0.22  0.22 \nPassenger occupancy (number)  2.00  3.00     10.00     28.00 \nTotal passenger time cost ($/hour)  0.37  1.72 1.47  4.11 \nSources: Vietnam Expressway Corporation and Asian Development Bank estimates \n \nD.  Project Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n6.  The economic analysis covers 25 years including 5 years of implementation and 20 \nyears of operations. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated by comparing \nthe with-project and without-project scenarios for the road network in eastern HCMC. Without \nthe Project, traffic will use the existing road network, which will be congested and expensive to \nmaintain because of rapidly increasing traffic. With the Project, the congestion on existing roads \nwill be reduced, and traffic on the project expressway and existing roads will benefit from faster \ntravel. The Project yields an EIRR of 15.5% for the base-case scenario, indicating the Project is \neconomically viable (Table A11.3). The distribution analysis shows that road users will receive \nthe largest share of net project benefits, accounting for 95% of the total net benefits. \n \nTable A11.3: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n(constant 2007 economic prices, domestic price numeraire, $ million)  \n \n   Costs    Benefits    \nNormal and \n  Net \nDiverted Traffic \nYear  Capital  O&M  Total    Total  Benefits \nVOC  Time \n  \nSavings Savings\n                 \n2008  4.3     4.3           (4.3) \n2009  355.0     355.0           (355.0) \n2010  107.3     107.3           (107.3) \n2011  107.3     107.3           (107.3) \n2012  107.3     107.3           (107.3) \n2013    0.6   0.6     15.1   13.7   28.8   28.2  \n2014    0.6   0.6     67.6   28.0   95.6   95.0  \n2015    0.7   0.7     99.1   39.4    138.5   137.8  \n2016    0.7   0.7     96.4   37.6   134.1   133.3  \n2017    0.8   0.8     93.4   41.3   134.7   133.9  \n2018     0.7   0.7     99.2   45.4   144.6   143.9  \n2019    0.9   0.9     105.6   50.1   155.7   154.8  \n2020    6.1   6.1     112.4   56.1   168.5   162.5  \n2021    1.1   1.1     111.3   61.4   172.7   171.6  \n2022    1.2   1.2     114.0   67.0   181.0   179.8  \n2023    1.3   1.3     119.6   73.0   192.7   191.4  \n2024    1.4   1.4     124.4   79.1    203.6   202.2  \n2025    1.4   1.4     150.5   85.3   235.9   234.4  \n2026    1.4   1.4     175.4   87.8   263.2   261.8  \n2027    1.7   1.7     201.1   90.5   291.5   289.9  \n ", "48  Appendix 11   \n   Costs    Benefits    \nNormal and \n  Net \nDiverted Traffic \nYear  Capital  O&M  Total    Total  Benefits \nVOC  Time \n  \nSavings Savings\n2028    6.9   6.9     229.6   94.1   323.7   316.8  \n2029    2.0   2.0     260.5   98.2   358.7   356.8  \n2030     2.1   2.1     326.6   126.2   452.8   450.6  \n2031    2.1   2.1     326.6   126.2   452.8   450.6  \n2032  (408.7)  2.1   (406.6)    326.6   126.2   452.8   859.4  \n        Economic Net Present Value = $  248.6  \n            Economic Internal Rate of Return =    15.6% \n( ) = negative, O&M = operation and maintenance, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \n   Sources: Vietnam Expressway Corporation and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Sensitivity Analysis \n \n7.  Sensitivity analysis was undertaken for key risk factors and assumptions that could \ninfluence the Project\u2019s viability. The analysis confirms the robustness of the Project\u2019s economic \nviability. The capital cost would have to increase by 45% or project benefits decrease by 32% \nfor the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%.

The financial viability of the Project was assessed by analyzing the financial internal rate \nof return (FIRR) and the Project\u2019s financial statements. The FIRR analysis assesses the project \nreturn,  comparing  it  to  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC).  The  analysis  of  the \nfinancial  statements  focuses  on  the  Project\u2019s  debt  service  repayment  capacity  and  capital \nstructure. The financial analysis examines the aggregated costs and benefits from toll revenues \nof  the  Ho  Chi  Minh  City\u2013Long  Thanh\u2013Dau  Giay  Expressway.  The  FIRR  of  the  Project  is \ncalculated for 2008\u20132033 using constant 2007 prices. The projected financial statements are \nprepared in current terms, over the same period. The foreign inflation rate was assumed to be \n0.8%, and the local inflation rate 18.3% for 2008, 10.2% for 2009, 6.5% for 2010, 4% for 2011, \nand 5.0% for 2012 onward during the projection period. The foreign exchange rate used for \n2008 is D16,000 to $1. \n \nA.  Analysis \n \n2.  Assumptions.  The  main  project  costs  are  capital  investment  and  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  costs.  The  capital  costs  for  the  highway  include  civil  works  such  as \nearthwork, pavement and bridges, and land acquisition costs. The O&M costs include annual \nexpenses incurred in operating the highway. All capital costs are expressed in real terms using \nconstant 2007 prices. The FIRR was calculated on the basis of the base costs, excluding price \ncontingency and financial charges during implementation. \n \n3.  The financial benefits for the Project are measured by the operating revenue from toll \ncollection by users. The revenues are projected based on the forecast of future traffic and a \nbase toll rate of D900 per passenger car unit per kilometer (km). Tolls to be applied to the \noperation to the Project are in constant 2007 prices. \n \n4.  WACC. The FIRR was compared with the WACC of 1.1% (Table A12.1). The WACC, \nafter-tax, in real terms was calculated using estimated capital mix and costs of funds. The \nassumptions are as follows: (i) the applicable 5-year swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread \nof 0.2% and onlending premium of 0.2% are used for ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources debt;  \n(ii) for the loan financed by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), 1.2% for \nconstruction and 0.01% for consulting service plus onlending premium of 0.2%; and (iii) the cost \nof counterpart funding is assumed to be 10.5%, which is the estimated interest of government-\nguaranteed bonds. The cost of debt is adjusted to reflect the impact of income tax of 28%. The \nnominal cost of debt is converted to the real cost of debt by applying the average domestic \ninflation rate for domestic debt, and the average international inflation rate for foreign-currency-\ndenominated debt. \n \n5.  FIRR. The FIRR for the Project, computed on an after-tax basis, is 4.0%. This exceeds \nthe WACC of 1.1%. The results of sensitivity tests are shown in Table A12.2. The FIRR exceeds \nthe WACC for each sensitivity scenario. \n \n \n ", "50  Appendix 12   \nTable A12.1.

Financial Projections \n \n6.  Projected financial statements for the Project (income statement, balance sheet, and \ncash-flow statement) were prepared to monitor the debt service repayment capacity and capital \nstructure of the Project on a stand-alone basis.   \n \n7.  Assumptions. The financial projections are presented in current price terms, which take \ninto  account  the  potential  impact  of  domestic  and  foreign  inflation. The  assumption  of  the \ndomestic and international inflation rates is described in paragraph 1. Depreciation of the dong \nagainst the dollar is assumed to be 1.3% per annum, based on the historical trend of the past  \n5 years. Toll rates will be adjusted to account for domestic inflation; there will be no real increase \nin toll rates over the project life span. A corporate tax rate of 28% is assumed, in line with \ncorporate  tax  laws,  which  allows  for  the  following:  (i)  in  the  first  2  years  of  profit-making \noperations, Vietnam Expressway Corporation (VEC) is tax exempt; (ii) in the following 3 profit-\nmaking years of operations VEC will pay 50% of the 20% corporate tax; (iii) in next 10 years \nVEC will pay 20%; and (iv) in years thereafter, VEC will pay the full 28% corporate tax. The 10% \nvalue-added tax is included in the toll rate. \n \n8.  The  projected  O&M  costs,  comprising  annual  routine  costs  and  periodic  road \nmaintenance costs, are based on the results of engineering studies. The annual O&M costs are \napproximately $0.6 million at 2007 prices. The cost of periodic maintenance to overlay the \nhighway is assumed to be $6 million every 8 years starting in 2020. These O&M costs are \n ", "  Appendix 12  51 \nassumed  to  increase  in  accordance  with  the  domestic  inflation  rate  of  5%  per  annum.  A \ndepreciation period of 40 years is assumed, which reflects the current depreciation regulation. \n \n9.  Financing Plan. The project cost will be funded by ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, the \nJBIC  loan,  and  government  counterpart  funds  (Table  A12.3).  For  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources and the JBIC loan, VEC will borrow the funds from the Ministry of Finance based on \nsubsidiary  loan  agreements.  VEC  plans  to  borrow  in  Vietnamese  dong,  and  will  pay  an \nonlending premium of 0.2% per annum in addition to the interest rate for ADB loans. The \ncounterpart funds will be provided from VEC\u2019s own internal source. \n \nTable A12.3.

Financial Projections. The financial projections show that the accumulated net cash \nflow remains positive (Table A12.4), which means that VEC will not require subsidies throughout \nthe operation period. As explained in para. 5, since the amount of the counterpart funds from \nVEC will be only 0.6% of the total project cost, the initial debt\u2013equity ratio for the Project is about \n98:1 in 2013. However, in 2022, or after 10 years of operation, the ratio will be improved to \n75:25 because of increasing toll revenue. Although the Project will have a debt service coverage \nratio of less than 1.0 in 2020 because of periodic maintenance, it will achieve a sufficient debt \nservice coverage ratio of more than 1.2, except in 2020, and maintain enough accumulated cash \nflow to cover the debt service. Therefore, the Project\u2019s debt service capacity is considered to be \nsufficient and sustainable. \n \nTable A12.4.

Vietnam Expressway Corporation (VEC) was established in late 2004 with a mandate to \npromote expressway development. VEC does not yet own its expressway assets and is in the \nprocess  of  developing  three  expressway  projects.  Institutional  and  financial  management \nanalyses  of  VEC  were  conducted  to  monitor  its  financial  management  capacity.  Financial \nanalysis of VEC was assessed from VEC\u2019s consolidated projected financial statements for \n2008\u20132025. \n \nA.  Institutional and Financial Management Analysis \n \n2.  VEC was established as a state-owned company on 6 October 2004 by the Ministry of \nTransport  Decision  No.  3033.  VEC\u2019s  operation  is  mainly  governed  by  two  important  legal \ndocuments:  its  corporate  charter,  promulgated  by  Ministry  of  Transport  Decision  No. 3466,  \n12 November 2004; and the Law on State Enterprise. Pursuant to Decision No. 3033, VEC\u2019s \nmain activities include (i) investing in expressway construction, management, and maintenance; \nand organizing toll collection on national highways; (ii) investing in construction of other transport \ninfrastructure in all modes; (iii) managing and operating services adjacent to its expressways, \nsuch as motels, restaurants, advertisements, and construction materials; (iv) providing technical \nconsulting  services  in  the  transport  sector,  research  and  development  of  national  highway \nsystems, and design and supervision of transport facility works; and (v) providing research and \ndevelopment of services in areas adjacent to expressways. In accordance with Article 166 of the \nLaw on Enterprises, VEC will be converted from a state-owned company to either a limited \nliability company or a shareholding company no later than 1 July 2010. \n \n3.  VEC\u2019s operations are divided into five functional divisions and three project management \nunits.  VEC  currently  has  120  employees.  VEC\u2019s  organization  structure  was  established  in \naccordance with the provisions of the Law on State Enterprises and includes (i) management \nboard and internal audit unit, (ii) management, and (iii) eight operation departments including \nthree project management units. The organization structure is given in Figure A13. \n \n4.  The finance and accounting department is responsible for funds and asset management, \nand implementation of financial accounting and bookkeeping. VEC has issued audited financial \nstatements for 2004, 2005, and 2006. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with \nthe Vietnamese accounting system issued by the Ministry of Finance. The reports include a \nbalance  sheet,  profit  and  loss  report,  and  cash-flow  statement.  They  are  prepared  by \naccountants using a computerized accounting system connected to all transactions in an online \ngeneral ledger. The reports are reviewed by an internal auditing control board, and audited by \nan independent external auditor annually. An external auditor has reviewed the audited financial \nstatements of past years and rated them satisfactory with unqualified opinion. The financial \nmanagement  system  and  VEC  staff  are  considered  adequate  for  accounting  purposes. \nHowever,  VEC  should  develop  its  own  financial  information  system  to  make  a  financially \nsustainable expressway investment plan that takes into account monitoring and planning cost-\nrecovery  tariffs,  forecasting  traffic  volume,  making  projected  financial  statements,  and \ndeveloping  a  debt-management  strategy.

Financial Projections  \n \n5.  VEC is currently engaged in the realization of three expressway projects and estimates \nthat initial expressway operation will launch in 2011. Therefore, VEC will begin generating toll \nrevenues from 2011. Financial statements of fiscal year 2006 show the company\u2019s modest \nprofitability of $3 million; this income came from interest earned from deposits, not from toll \nrevenue. VEC\u2019s charter capital is D1,000 billion, or about $62 million. \n \n6.  Financial Projections: The financial analysis of VEC is carried out in current terms on \nan after-tax basis. VEC\u2019s projected financial statements are prepared by consolidating VEC\u2019s \ncurrent assets and the three expressway projects that are currently under construction or at the \ndetailed feasibility study stage: (i) the Cau Gie\u2013Ninh Binh Expressway (50 km, currently under \nconstruction); (ii) the Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Expressway (244 km); and (iii) Ho Chi Minh City\u2013Long \nThanh\u2013Dau Giay Expressway (55 km). Total capital expenditures on the three projects will \nexceed $2.5 billion. The financial projections assume that VEC will charge D900 per passenger \ncar unit per km for the Ho Chi Minh City\u2013Long Thanh\u2013Dau Giay Expressway (the Project), and \nthat the toll rate will be adjusted to account for inflation. Other assumptions, such as corporate \ntaxes, value-added taxes, depreciation, and international and local inflation rates, reflect the \nassumptions used in Appendix 12. \n ", "  Appendix 13  55 \n \n7.  Results: The financial projections of VEC and the key financial ratios are shown in Table \nA13. VEC will have net operating losses until 2016 because the toll revenue is not sufficient to \ncover depreciation costs and interest in the initial operation stage. However, VEC can maintain \npositive accumulated cash flow throughout the operating period to cover debt services. Gross \nrevenue will increase to generate net operating profit from 2017 with the gradual increase of \ntraffic volume. The debt\u2013equity ratio will be 95:5 in 2013, and improve to 77:23 in 2022 because \nof increased retained earnings. Despite its large-scale investment plan, VEC will maintain its \nfinancial viability in the medium and longer term without additional subsidies during operations. \n \nTable A13: Financial Projections of Vietnam Electricity Corporation (2013\u20132025) \n($ million) \n \nItem  2013  2015  2018  2020  2022  2025 \nGross Revenue  120.4  152.1  276.8  343.5  496.6  635.7 \nDepreciation  57.2  57.2  57.2  57.2  57.3  57.3 \nInterest  46.4  123.3  126.6  124.3  115.9  71.9 \nNet Operating Profit / (Loss)  (0.9) (49.5) 63.4  105.8  222.8  361.7 \nAccumulated Cashflow  120.5  173.8  308.6  393.7  627.1  991.1 \nTotal Assets  2,557.3  2,564.0  2,545.7  2,516.3  2,638.6  2,830.7 \nDebt  2,441.4  2,513.7  2,416.0  2,234.2  2,025.5  1,343.1 \nNet Equity  115.9  50.3  129.7  282.1  613.2  1,487.6 \nCash Available for Debt Service  107.6  137.9  212.2  243.4  311.9  381.7 \nDebt Service  1.1  132.3  184.5  209.4  212.6  221.2 \nDebt Service Coverage Ratio (%)  \u2014   1.04 1.15 1.16  1.47  1.73 \nDebt to Total Assets  0.95 0.98 0.95 0.89  0.77  0.47 \n( ) = negative, \u2014 = not applicable. \nSources: Vietnam Expressway Corporation and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \n8.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.    Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nViet Nam\u2019s record in poverty reduction has been impressive in the last decade. The proportion of the population living below \nthe poverty line has declined from around 59% in 1993 to 25% in 2005. The proposed target for the Five-Year Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 is to reduce the percentage of poor households to 15%\u201316% by 2010. While \nsignificant in terms of magnitude, progress in poverty reduction remains fragile, with a significant number of \u201cnear poor\u201d \nclustered  just  above  the  poverty  line.  Sustained  development  requires  modernization  and  improvement  of  physical \ninfrastructure and associated services.  \nTo support the Government in pursuing balanced economic growth and poverty reduction, the Country Strategy and Program \nUpdate 2006\u20132008 for Viet Nam and the Poverty Partnership Agreement between Viet Nam and the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) emphasize trade and access to markets within the country and the region. In the recent years the Southern Focal \nEconomic Zone (SFEZ) has made a great contribution to economic development in Viet Nam. The country is experiencing \nrapid economic growth, centered on exports to world markets; and through increasingly bilateral trade in agriculture, aquatic, \nmining, and industrial products. Sustained development requires improved infrastructure that accommodates trade within the \ncountry and bilateral trade.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                          Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n  \nIn the SFEZ, the Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC)\u2013Long Thanh\u2013Dau Giay Expressway (HLD expressway) will be an essential trunk \nroad for the highway network. The general area that will be served will include the provinces in the SFEZ, Mekong Delta, \nhighlands, and south central Coast. The expressway will provide a connection to the proposed Long Thanh international \nairport for HCMC, which will serve international and national traffic. Expressways are intended to serve long distance traffic; \nthey do not necessarily benefit people who are local to the expressway. Even though expressways generally do not directly \naddress local poverty they do address it indirectly by facilitating continued economic growth. The proposed HLD expressway \nis located in HCMC and Dong Nai Province, one of the least poor provinces with a poverty rate of 10.33% (Viet Nam \nHousehold Living Standard Survey 2002). Given the low rate of poverty in the project area, and that the expressway is \nintended to serve long distance traffic, the Project will have very limited impact on poverty reduction in the project locations.  \nHowever, improved transport infrastructure is critical for sustained rapid economic growth and overall poverty reduction, and \ncan contribute to regionally balanced and equitable economic growth by stimulating agriculture production, and increasing \naccess to employment opportunities. Remoteness and disconnection are often identified as factors for poor people\u2019s inability \nto benefit from economic growth. Road connectivity under the Project might contribute to local people\u2019s ability to benefit from \neconomic growth in the long run. The Project is classified as GI based on these reasons. \n \n2. Design Features.  \n \nThe Project does not include pro-poor design except for the potential for daily wage employment generation for the poor \nduring construction.   \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nNot Applicable.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues.  \nThe 51-kilometer HLD expressway is located within the main engine of economic growth in Viet Nam. The establishment of \nexpressway will contribute to an improved transport system and support economic development of the area. The expressway \nwill benefit major business centers in the south of Viet Nam, including: HCMC, Ba Ria, Vung Tau, and Dong Nai Province. \n ", "  Appendix 14  57 \nThe primary beneficiaries of the Project include large investors, traders, and vehicle operators. The expressway will benefit \nbusiness and investors by reducing transport costs and reducing travel time for the transportation of goods and materials. \nWith increased investment in the SFEZ this will create employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled labor. During \nconstruction the demand for unskilled labor will increase and both skilled and unskilled labor will benefit from increased \naccess to the labor market. The socioeconomic profile of the Project shows that 27% of the population is between 18 and 35 \nyears of age; they will benefit from better access to the labor market. The socioeconomic profile of the Project districts \nindicates that 35% of households own small businesses. They are less likely to benefit from the expressway since the \nexpressway will be more cost-effective for transport of large quantities of goods. Most people in the project area do no travel \nlong distances to their place of work; therefore, the expressway will only generate limited benefits in terms of easier \ncommuting to work for the local people.  \n \nThe main social and livelihood impacts of the Project are related to resettlement and relocation, HIV, human trafficking, and \nroad safety. During construction an additional impact for local residents may be increased dust and noise pollution. \nConstruction of the expressway may lead to an increase in land prices in the project area. This may attract outsiders to \npurchase land for residential and business purposes resulting in a change in the social nature and demographics of the \nproject districts. Of the 957 households that will be directly affected by expressway construction, about 30% will be relocated. \nRelocation and livelihood restoration are the key issues in terms of the social impact of the Project. The resettlement plan \naddresses the relocation and livelihood impact of the Project.  \n \nThe expressway will increase the risk of exposure to HIV and the trafficking of women and children during construction and \npostconstruction phase due to increased transit traffic along the highway. In 2003, HCMC had the greatest number of HIV \ninfected people, accounting for a fourth of all infections in the country. The city has the fastest growing epidemic in the country \nwith HIV prevalence among adults aged 15\u201329 estimated to be about 1.2. The number of infected females relative to males is \nincreasing each year, indicating increasing heterosexual transmission. The influx of construction workers in the Project during \nthe construction phase and increased volume of transit traffic in the postconstruction period will increase the risk of HIV and \nhuman trafficking. With improved transportation and infrastructure, existing risks and vulnerabilities for HIV transmission, drug \nuse, and trafficking along the highway will significantly increase if targeted risk mitigation initiatives are not implemented. Data \nfrom social assessments show that 53% of the households in the project area have had some HIV awareness training or \npromotional activities on HIV. However, awareness about trafficking issues is much lower among surveyed households than \nfor HIV. Reports from nongovernment organizations and aid organizations indicate that a high rate of human trafficking in the \nsouth. To mitigate these risks, a HIV awareness and prevention of human trafficking component is included in the Project to \nminimize exposure of the local population to these issues. The program includes capacity building of the Executing Agency; \nawareness campaigns in construction camps, and communities in the project districts; development of peer educators; and \ncommunity monitoring distribution of medical equipment to relevant health facilities. The program includes community \nawareness programs on human trafficking, safe migration, and community monitoring. \n \nA road safety awareness program is included in the Project to address the need for behavioral change on the part of road \nusers when the expressway opens. The environment management plan includes measures to address dust and pollution \nrelated issues. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultation meetings were held with project affected people to discuss the impact of the Project in terms of resettlement and \nenvironmental impacts. Meetings were held in all of the communes within the project area and the results of these meetings \nwere incorporated into the project resettlement plan, environmental impact assessment, and EMP. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \nDuring project construction, consultation will mainly relate to the preparation and implementation of the updated resettlement \nplan. A series of consultations with affected people will be held during the detailed measurement survey and updating of the \nresettlement plan.  \n \nTo minimize the risk of the expressway dividing local communities by disrupting existing local road communications, options \nfor including underpasses, overpasses, and frontage roads will be discussed with local communities during the early stages of \ndetailed engineering design. The communities will be consulted to determine the maximum distance between facilities to \ncross the expressway, by either overpasses or underpasses, so that livelihood and social networks and the existing local road \nsystem are not significantly disrupted. Community consultations will be facilitated by social development specialists engaged \nas part of the construction supervision consultant\u2019s team.  \n    \n ", "58  Appendix 14   \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nA separate C&P plan is not required. Consultation and participatory processes have been mainstreamed in relevant project \ncomponents and documents such as the resettlement plan, environmental impact assessment, gender strategy, and program \nfor the prevention of HIV and human trafficking. The resettlement plan and environmental impact assessment report include \nappendixes on the consultation process.  \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. \n \nThe Project will improve the transportation system and facilitate economic development. In terms of gender, the Project \nimpacts relate to (i) increased risks of exposure to HIV and trafficking of women and children during construction and \npostconstruction phase due to the large volume of transit traffic along the road; (ii) poor women in the project area at risk \neconomically (loss of productive asset due to land acquisition) and socially (risks posed by HIV, road safety, and possible \nhuman trafficking) than males. However, the Project will create employment opportunities for poor women during construction. \nIn addition, in the long run the increased investments in the SFEZ will create demand for both skilled and unskilled labor. An \nincrease in labor market demand will have an impact on employment opportunities for women. However, the employment in \nthe factories in the economic zone can have both positive and negative impacts. The women migrant workers might face \nexploitative working conditions with low wages in the SFEZ. In addition, women migrant workers could be deceived and be \ntrafficked to the SFEZ. Measures to address the potential negative impacts of women migrant workers in the SFEZ are \noutside the project scope. The potential negative impacts relating to resettlement, HIV, and human trafficking will be \naddressed through the gender strategy in the resettlement plan and HIV awareness and prevention of human trafficking \nprogram. \n \n2.  Key Actions.    Gender plan         Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nA project-specific gender strategy is been prepared and included in the resettlement plan, the HIV and human trafficking \nawareness program includes action targeted at women.
