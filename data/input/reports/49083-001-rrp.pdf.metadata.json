The government\u2019s planned fiscal stimulus expenditure will help Kazakhstan \nstabilize  and  continue  its  economic  growth  trajectory  while  targeting  fiscal  sustainability  in  the \nmedium  term.  The  proposed  loan  will  contribute  to  employment  creation,  social  services \nprovision,  and  low-income  household  support;  expand  and  modernize  physical  infrastructure; \nand promote inclusive private sector development.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nGross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed from an average of 10.2% during 2000\u2013\n2007  to  3.3%  in  2008  and  1.2%  in  2009  during  the  global  financial  crisis.  Responding  to  the \ncrisis  the  government  implemented  the  Anti-Crisis  Plan  and  the  Employment  Generation \nProgram,  which  included  funding  from  an  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  countercyclical \nsupport  loan  of  $500  million. 2  The  government  also  drew  upon  the  National  Fund  of  the \nRepublic  of  Kazakhstan  (NFRK)  to  implement  the  reforms,  which  cost  the  government  about \n$24.4  billion  during  2008\u20132010.3 The  countercyclical  measures  undertaken  in  response  to  the \nglobal crisis, along with rising oil prices, enabled a return to higher economic growth averaging \n6.4% during 2010\u20132013, but growth did not rebound to pre-crisis growth rates. \n \n\n1. \n\nSerious Impact of Adverse External Factors \n\n4. \nIn  2014,  two  significant  external  factors  impaired  economic  growth,  revenue \nperformance,  and  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  mitigate  these  effects.  The  first  was  the \nRussian Federation\u2019s economic slowdown, which triggered a downward adjustment in the tenge \nexchange  rate  equivalent  to  16.2%,  or  a  19.4%  rise  in  the  tenge\u2013dollar  exchange  rate.4 The \nRussian  Republic  provides  all  pipelines  and  ports  for  Kazakh  oil  and  mineral  exports,  and \nsupplies about 36% of total imports. The economies are further linked through joint membership \nin the European Economic Union. The second was the steep fall in world oil prices, which fell by \n                                                \n1   The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  has  not  provided  project \n\npreparatory technical assistance for the proposed loan for Countercyclical Support. \n\n2   ADB.  2009.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nRepublic of Kazakhstan for the Kazakhstan Countercyclical Support Loan. Manila.  \n\n3  The  NFRK,  established  in  2000,  ensures  stable  social  and  economic  development  and  saving  of  financial \nresources  for  future  generations.  To  ensure  transparency,  transfers  from  the  NFRK  are  published,  and  pass \nthrough  the  republican  budget.  Transfers  include  (i)  guaranteed  transfers  to  support  economic  growth,  and  \n(ii) targeted transfers for socially important projects that are not self-sustaining and that can be provided by order of \nthe  President  of  Kazakhstan  in  the  absence  of  alternative  financing  sources.  Direct  transfers  from  the  NFRK  to \nstate-owned  enterprises  are  not  reflected  in  the  republican  budget.  Collected  Acts  of  the  President  and  the \nGovernment of the Republic of Kazakhstan. 2010. On the Concept of establishment and use of the National Fund \nof the Republic of Kazakhstan. Decree of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan No. 962 dated 2 April 2010. \nSource for NFRK assets: http://www.nationalbank.kz \n\n4  Since  September  2013,  the  tenge  has  been  measured  against  a  basket  of  currencies,  which  helped  reduce  the \neffect  of  the  weakening  Russian  ruble.  The  exchange  rate  band  has  gradually  widened  from  T185  \u00b1  T3  =  $1  in \nFebruary  2014,  from  T155  the  previous  day;  T185  +T3  to  T185  -T15  in  September  2014;  and  to  T185  +T13  to \nT185 -T15 in July 2015, widening the band to T170\u2013T198 = $1. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n \n\nmore  than  50%  from  the  end  of  2013  to  the  end  of  2014.5 Kazakhstan\u2019s  economy  is  heavily \ndependent  on  oil,  which  accounts  for  about  20.0%  of  GDP,  50.0%  of  budget  revenues,  and \n76.0% of exports. \n \n5. \nThe  downward  exchange  rate  adjustment  of  the  domestic  currency  in  February \n2014  undermined  confidence  in  the  tenge,  increased  dollarization,  and  increased  the \nlikelihood of firms\u2019 balance sheet and liquidity risks. Firms and households converted tenge \ndeposits  into  foreign  currency,  the  tenge  money  supply  dropped,  and  deposit  dollarization \nincreased from 37.4% in 2013 to 52.2% by May 2015. Loan dollarization has remained largely \nthe same. Lending has slowed and had by May 2015 contracted 1.9% on a year-on-year basis. \nDeposits  contracted  0.7%  on  a  year-on-year  basis.  Market  indicators  suggest  a  higher \nperceived credit risk, which is making it harder for Kazakhstan to access international markets \nfor  funding  without  increased  cost.  In  2015,  two  of  three  main  global  rating  agencies \ndowngraded  Kazakhstan\u2019s  sovereign  rating,  contributing  to  greater  increases  in  the  cost  of \nsovereign borrowing on international capital markets.6 Kazakhstan on 14 July 2015 issued a 10-\nyear dollar denominated bond in the amount of $2.5 billion with a 5.1% coupon and a 30-year \ndollar  denominated  bond  in  the  amount  of  $1.5  billion  with  a  6.5%  coupon.  A  Eurobond  was \nissued in October 2014 in 10-year dollar-denominated bonds priced to yield 4.07% and 30-year \ndollar-denominated  bonds  priced  to  yield  5.12%,  prices  which  were  1.03%  and  1.38%  lower \nrespectively than the 2015 bonds.  \n \n6. \nThe  adverse  external  factors  have  had  a  significant  negative  effect  on  the  real \neconomy.  GDP  growth  fell from  6% in  2013  to 4.3%  in  2014,  and  is projected to  drop  to \n1.9%  in  2015. The  slowdown  is  due  to  lower  oil  industry  output,  weaker  external  demand  for \nKazakhstan\u2019s  metal  exports,  and  declining  domestic  demand.  The  lower  commodity  prices \ncaused  export  revenues  to  fall  by  8.6%  in  2014,  from  a  1.1%  decline  in  2013.  Consumption \ngrowth\u2014a  key  economic  growth  driver\u2014fell  from  12.8%  in  2013  to  2.5%  in  2014,  due  to  the \ndownward  adjustment  of  the  tenge  and  tighter  consumer  lending.  The  current  account  is \nprojected to move to a deficit of 1.0% in 2015. The 12-month inflation rate increased from 5.8% \nin 2013 to 6.7% in 2014,7 but in June 2015 inflation was 3.9% year-on-year. \n \n7. \nWhile  fiscal  policy  is  sound,  the  government  budget  is  under  pressure  to  meet \ncritical expenditures. The budget deficit expanded from 2.0% of GDP in 2013 to 2.7% in 2014 \n($6  billion  equivalent)  and  is  projected  to  increase  to  3.0%  in  2015  ($6.8  billion  equivalent). \nTransfers from the NFRK to the budget were increased from 26.7% of total revenue in 2013 to \n32.6% of total revenue in 2014. The increased NFRK transfers in 2014, together with a 13.3% \nrise in corporate income tax revenue, caused total budget revenue to increase to 15.1% of GDP \nin 2014. However, the post-tenge adjustment pay rise and higher pensions and social transfers \nincreased expenditure to 17.9% of GDP in 2014. To meet the budget gap, the government sold \n$2.5 billion in Eurobonds in October 2014, pushing public and publicly guaranteed debt up 2.3% \nto about 15.2% in 2014. \n \n8. \nThe  economic  decline  dampens  employment  prospects.  The  historic  relationship \nbetween job creation and growth has been weak. This reflects the capital-intensive nature of the \neconomy,  dominated  by  the  oil  subsector  with  a  small,  undiversified  private  sector.  The \n\n                                                \n5   Due to measurement methods and economic developments, the report may contain minor data inconsistencies. \n6  Moody's  rates  Kazakhstan  Baa2  (stable  outlook),  S&P  rates  it  BBB  (negative  outlook),  and  Fitch  rates  it  BBB+ \n\n(stable outlook). Kazakhstan retained its investment grade through the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis. \n\n7   Core inflation increased from 4.3% in 2013 to 6.7% in 2014. \n\n\fgovernment  implemented  the  first  employment  road  map  in  2009  in  response  to  the  global \nfinancial  crisis,  undertaking  public  works  to  contain  sudden  rises  in  unemployment.  This \ncountercyclical measure contributed to a reduction in unemployment from 6.6% in 2009 to 5.1% \nin  2014.8 Job  creation  in  services  helped  keep  poverty  low,  and  poverty  incidence  decreased \nfrom  6.6%  in  2009  to  2.8%  in  2014.9 However,  28.0%  of the  economically  active population is \nself-employed, and is highly vulnerable to the current economic downturn. These workers also \nare  less  likely  to  be  covered  by  social  protection  and  support.10 Current  challenges  that  the \ngovernment  will  address  using  countercyclical  measures  include  (i)  the  unproductive  farm \nstructure,  which  reflects limited  access  to  credit and weak  integration  of food  value  chains;  (ii) \nthe  underdeveloped  private  sector,  which  does  not  sufficiently  increase  employment;  (iii)  the \nlarge public sector, with higher compensation and benefit packages than the private sector; and \n(iv) the demand for labor, which does not match the available skills mix. \n \n\n2. \n\nCountercyclical Response by the Government  \n\n9. \nStarting  in  2014  the  government  introduced  three  main  measures  to  mitigate  the \nsignificant  negative  impacts  of  Russian  Federation\u2019s  economic  slowdown  and  steep  fall  in \nworld  oil  prices,  and  to  deliver  the  conditions  for  sustainable,  long-term,  inclusive  economic \ngrowth.  First,  in  early  2014  the  government  launched  a  long-term  development  strategy, \nKazakhstan 2050, to transform the economy into a diversified, private sector-driven, developed \neconomy.  To  commence  implementation  of  this  strategy,  the  government  developed  medium-\nterm  action  plans  to  be  implemented  under  Partnership  Framework  Arrangements  (PFA)  with \nmultilateral development banks (MDBs).11 Spending priorities include (i) $1 billion equivalent to \nincrease  lending  for  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  in  manufacturing  to  increase \nincome-generating  opportunities;  (ii)  $0.8  billion  equivalent  to  finance  infrastructure  projects, \nparticularly  regional  projects  in  housing  and  utilities,  road  construction  and  repair,  and \nreconstruction  of  social  facilities;  (iii)  $1.4  billion  equivalent  for  the  Fund  for  Problem  Loans  to \nsupport banking by purchasing qualified nonperforming loans (NPLs); and (iv) an additional $2.2 \nbillion equivalent for other projects under the PFA. ADB is expected to support two programs in \n2016 under the PFA.12 \n \n10. \nThe  second  measure  is  the  Nurly  Zhol  program  for  infrastructure  development, \napproved  in  April  2015.  It  includes  economic  support  of  $9  billion  equivalent\u2014with  annual \nallocations  for  2015,  2016,  and  2017\u2014to  be  financed  through  the  budget  by  the  NFRK  and \nMDB  loans.  The  program  will  continue  reforms  to  support  and  stabilize  economic  growth  and \nemployment, including anti-crisis measures for individual sectors of the economy facing export \ndeclines.  Spending  priorities  include  (i)  developing  and  modernizing  infrastructure  to  support \neducation,  tourism,  housing,  utilities,  transport,  and  logistics;  (ii)  developing  non-oil  business \nsectors, including manufacturing and agribusiness; and (iii) improving the business environment, \n\n                                                \n8  World Bank.

The Official Statistical Information. http://www.stat.gov.kz (accessed 5 July 2015). \n11 ADB  and  the  Government  of  Kazakhstan  signed  the  PFA  during  ADB\u2019s  47th  Annual  Meeting  of  the  Board  of \nGovernors  in  Astana  in  May  2014.  The  PFA  will  deepen  cooperation  to  achieve  the  goals  to  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s  development  strategies  over  the  next  decade.  This  is  reflected  in  the  government\u2019s  increased \nfunding share in ADB. (ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Kazakhstan, 2012\u20132016. Manila). 2014. Country \nOperations  Business  Plan:  Kazakhstan, 2015\u20132017.  Manila.  PFAs  also exist  with  the World  Bank,  the  European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Islamic Development Bank. \n\n12 The proposed programs are included in ADB. 2014.  Country Operations Business Plan: Kazakhstan, 2015\u20132017. \n\nManila. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\nincluding  increasing  availability  of  finance.  Among  other  results,  Nurly  Zhol  will  address \nproblems  with  the  shortage  of  preschool  educational  institutions,  three-shift  education  in \nsecondary schools, and poor materials and technical equipment in higher education institutions. \nTo stimulate entrepreneurship, funds will be provided for loans to manufacturing businesses to \nhelp create work for more than 4,000 people. In total, the Nurly Zhol expects to generate about \n395,000 jobs by 2019 through investment projects. \n \n11. \nThe  third  measure  is  the  Employment  Roadmap  2020,  financed  with  $200  million \nequivalent in the revised March 2015 budget, with similar allocations planned for 2016 and 2017. \nTarget  population  groups  include  the  self-employed,  unemployed,  part-time,  and  low-income \npersons,  including  youth,  women,  and  the  disabled.  The  road  map  has  three  objectives:  (i) \npromote employment of self-employed, unemployed, and target population groups; (ii) develop \nhuman resources;  and (iii)  improve  targeted  social  assistance.  It  includes  increased  access to \nemployment  opportunities,  training,  and  retraining;  and  strengthening  of  the  linkage  between \nparticipation in employment programs (training) and access to social services and aid. By 2020, \nthe target is to keep the total unemployment rate below 5.0%, the unemployment rate of women \nbelow 5.5%, and the youth unemployment rate (15\u201328 years of age) below 4.6%. \n \n12. \nThe government also has taken steps to attract investment to the non-oil economy. The \nFramework for Attracting Foreign and Domestic Investment into Kazakhstan presented in April \n2014  includes  a package  of  incentives for  investors:  (i)  investment  subsidies,  tax  preferences, \nand  procurement  incentives;  (ii)  stable  laws  and  cost  predictability  for  tax,  migration  and \nenvironmental  legislation,  and  predictable  tariffs  and  prices  of  regulated  services;  (iii) \nestablishment of a single window for investors; (iv) energy and transport cost subsidies; and (v) \ninclude  (i)  a  simplified  visa  regime,  \nattraction  of \n(ii)  extended  duration  of  agricultural  land  leases  for  foreigners,  and  (iii)  an  investment \nombudsman. In May  2015,  the  Plan for  the  Nation:  100 Concrete  Steps for  Implementation of \nInstitutional  Reforms  was  approved  in  response  to  current  global  and  domestic  challenges.  A \ndetailed  action  plan  includes  policy  improvements,  outputs,  and  activities  to  be  completed  in \n2015. It supports activities in both the Nurly Zhol and the Employment Roadmap 2020. \n \n\nlabor.  Additional  measures \n\nforeign \n\n3. \n\nMeasures  to  Ensure  Sound  Macroeconomic  Management,  Including  a \nSound Fiscal Position \n\n13. \nThe government and the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK), the country\u2019s central \nbank,  have  taken  proactive  monetary,  fiscal,  and  regulatory  measures  to  address  the \nsignificant negative external pressures on the economy. Monetary policy in 2014 aimed to \nmaintain price stability and rehabilitate the banking system, while preventing a post-devaluation \ndownturn. The monetary policy for 2015 and 2016 targets macroeconomic and financial stability, \nas well as domestic and external competitiveness.13 To restore trust in the tenge and stimulate \nlending, measures have been taken to address the scarcity of long-term tenge funding and the \nhigh level of dollarization in the banking system. In a move towards inflation targeting, which will \nrequire  a  shift  to  a  more  flexible  exchange  rate,  since  the  February  2014  devaluation  the \ngovernment  has  widened  the  exchange  rate  band  on  two  occasions  (footnote  4).14 The  NBK \nalso plans to moderate exchange rate fluctuation, while limiting market intervention to conserve \n\n                                                \n13 Monetary  Policy  Guidelines  of  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan  for  2015, approved  by  Resolution of  the  Board of  the \nNational Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated 25 February 2015 No. 30; and ADB. 2015. Asian Development \nOutlook: Financing Asia\u2019s Future Growth. Manila (March). \n\n14 Statement by the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan \n\non Main Directions of Economic Policy in 2015. 25 December 2014. \n\n\freserves. Measures to reduce dollarization in the economy include a doubling of the ceiling on \ntenge  deposit  insurance  guarantees  to  T10  million,  while  maintaining  the  T5  million  limit  on \nforeign currency deposits.  \n \n14. \nEfforts  are  under  way  to  strengthen  the  financial  system,  rehabilitate  weakened \nbanks,  and  develop  capital  markets.  Requirements  for  higher  bank  capitalization  will  take \neffect  on  1 January  2016.  Measures  under  way  to  reduce  the  high  number  of  non-performing \nloans (NPLs), a legacy from the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis, include (i) implementation of \nmaximum percentages of NPLs in bank portfolios (10% starting January 2016); (ii) amendments \nto three laws to facilitate the writing off of NPLs; (iii) write-offs of bad loans from bank balance \nsheets; and (iv) provision of funds to buy qualified NPLs from banks for work-outs at later dates. \nIn 2014, the government allocated $1.4 billion equivalent from the NFRK to capitalize the Fund \nfor  Problem  Loans  to  purchase  NPLs  from  banks.  These  steps  enabled  NPL  reduction  from \n33.7% of total bank portfolios in April 2014 to 23.1% ($17.6 billion equivalent) in April 2015. \n \n15. \nGovernment  fiscal  policy  is  to  balance  the  budget  and  manage  drawdowns  from \nthe  NFRK  by  (i)  developing  a  consistent  medium-term  macro-fiscal  framework;  (ii)  increasing \nthe sustainability of the non-oil deficit over the medium-term; and (iii) reducing the non-oil deficit \nfrom  7.7%  of GDP  in 2014  to 2.8%  by  2020.  However, for  the  next  two years  the  budget  and \nrelated  NFRK  transfers  will  be  under  significant  pressure.  In  March  2015,  the  budget  was \nrevised, at which time revenues were reduced by 14% and expenditures by 10%. Government \nsalary  increases  were  delayed,  but  social  support  and  services  allocations  were  increased  to \n39.1% of the budget. Slower growth, lower oil revenues, reduced export duties, and constrained \nimports are expected to continue to limit revenues, while expenditure must be sustained to meet \neconomic growth needs. Thus the revised budget projects a deficit of 3.0% of GDP in 2015 or \n$6.8  billion  equivalent,  and  the  provisional  2016  budget  projects  a  deficit  of  2.4%  of  GDP  or \nabout  $5.8  billion  equivalent. 15  To  support  the  2015  budget,  the  government  allocated \nguaranteed  and  targeted  transfers from the  NFRK  of  $13.4  billion  equivalent  or  41.5%  of  total \nrevenue. Total NFRK allocations for 2016 are projected at about $11.2 billion. The transfers in \nboth years will be insufficient to fill the budget deficit, and the government will need to go to the \nmarket  and  MDBs  to  meet  the  shortfall. 16 The  projections  suggest  that  public  and  publicly \nguaranteed debt will need to increase to 17.6% of GDP in 2015 and to 19.0% in 2016.17 \n \n\n16. \nTo ensure sustainable use of NFRK resources, a presidential decree established rules of \noperation which provide for maximum guaranteed transfers to support the economy, a minimum \ntotal asset size to perform the mandated savings functions of the NFRK, a limit for government \ndebt  service  tied  to  investment  income,  and  a  debt  service  link  to  revenues  including  NFRK \ntransfers (footnote  3). The maximum  amount for guaranteed  transfers  has now  been  reached. \nThe increased use of NFRK resources to support the economy, together with lower income from \noil, have resulted in a contraction of asset growth, Total assets of the NFRK of $69 billion in May \n                                                \n15 The revised budget revenues are based on oil price forecasts of $50.00 a barrel. This is not sufficient to meet the \nfiscal break-even oil price of $80.00/barrel for 2015.The external break-even point, the price of oil when the current \naccount balance is zero, is about $105.30 for 2015. The fiscal break-even point is the price of oil at which the fiscal \nbalance is zero. \n\n16 Transfers from the NFRK in 2015 are $9.2 billion equivalent in guaranteed transfers, and $4.2 billion equivalent in \ntargeted transfers. Equivalent amounts in 2016 are projected at about $9.2 billion in guaranteed transfers and $2.0 \nbillion in targeted transfers. \n\n17 Monetary Policy Guidelines of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2015, approved by the Resolution of the Board of the \nNational Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated 25 February, 2015 No. 30; International Monetary Fund. 2014. \nRegional  Economic  Outlook:  Middle  East  and  Central  Asia.  Washington,  DC \n(October).  Source: \nhttp://www.fxempire.com/commodities/brent-oil/ (accessed 15 March 2015). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\n2015 is nearing the 2015 minimum savings function of $67 billion, leaving limited headroom for \nfurther support to the economy. The threshold for annual government debt service is expected \nto  be  $3.3  billion  in  2015,  given  the  impact  of  the  exchange  rate  adjustment.  The  2014  debt \nservice ratio is expected to increase to 10.2% in 2015.18 These debt ratios are within the limits. \n \n17. \nBased  on  government  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  assumptions,  the  public  debt\u2013GDP \nratio is expected to increase to 17.6% in 2015 and 19.0% in 2016. It is projected to fall to 15.0% \nby 2018 and 13.9% by 2020, as economic growth rebounds and fiscal deficits shrink. A low debt \nratio suggests that public debt is sustainable, if government assumptions are realized. Assets of \nthe  NFRK  support  ADB\u2019s  conclusion  that  the  medium  term  outlook  is  generally  benign.  The \nimpact  of  the  proposed  loan  for  countercyclical  support  on  public  debt  sustainability  was \nassessed under a scenario that reflects ADB disbursing a $1 billion loan in two equal tranches \nof  $500  million  in  2015,  jointly  with  expected  World  Bank  loans  of  $1  billion  in  2015  and  $1 \nbillion in 2016. The joint effect initially raises the public debt ratio to 20.2% by 2016, compared \nwith the baseline of 19.0%, and then converges to the baseline due to swift amortization and the \npredominantly benign debt dynamics incorporated in the projections.19 \n \n\n4. \n\nProposed Loan for Countercyclical Support  \n\n18. \nThe  proposed  loan  results  from  extensive  ADB  policy  dialogue  with  the \ngovernment  and  development  partners  on  economic  developments,  policy  reform,  anti-\ncrisis measures, management and monitoring of reform efforts, and other related areas.20 \nThe government is committed to mitigating the impacts of the adverse economic developments, \nimplementing  countercyclical  expenditures  and  related  policies  to  address  the  significant \nnegative effects of the oil price decline and the Russian Federation\u2019s economic slowdown, and \nmaintaining  sound  macroeconomic  management.21 The  proposed  loan  will  support  budgeted \ncountercyclical  programs  and  help  the  government  achieve  a  sound  macro-fiscal  position. \nPayments  of  the  proposed  loan  are  divided  into  two  tranches  of  $500  million  each,  with \ndisbursement  conditions  for  the  second  tranche  based  on  key  policy  reforms  (para  24).  The \ngovernment  has  met  the  access  criteria  for  countercyclical  support:  (i)  significant  adverse \nimpact  of  the  crisis;  (ii)  planned  countercyclical  development  expenditures  to  address  the \nchallenges  and  protect  low-income  households;  and  (iii)  sound  macroeconomic  management, \nincluding a solid fiscal position.  \n \n19. \nReforms  will  be  carried  out  in  cooperation  with  ADB  and  other  MDBs  that  will \nprovide  financial  and  technical  support.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  loan  will  complement  the  World \nBank\u2019s  development  policy  financing;  the  PFA  designed  to  support  the  government\u2019s \ndevelopment  strategies;  and  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  support  to  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized \nenterprise development.22 It is in line with ADB support to upper middle-income countries, and \nwith the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in their support to countries affected \nby  falling  export  receipts  and  tax  revenue.23 Lessons  from  previous  loans  for  countercyclical \n\n                                                \n18 The Law on Republican Budget, with amendments, as of 11 March 2015. \n19 ADB staff debt sustainability assessment. \n20 The proposed loan for countercyclical support has also considered the IMF Article IV report, August 2014; and the \n\nstatement from the IMF staff visit, December 2014. \n\n21 The development policy letter in Appendix 3 confirms the government\u2019s commitments. \n22 ADB.  2013.

Washington, DC. 18 April 2015. \n\n\fsupport implemented by ADB are reflected in this proposed loan through (i) strengthened review \nand  analysis  of  macroeconomic  and  finance  sector  development,  and  (ii)  better  internal \ncoordination  and  collaboration  among  ADB  departments.  Another  key  lesson  is  the  need  for \ngreater ADB institutional readiness and flexibility in responding to crises to ensure relevance of \nADB  support,  especially  for  expenditures  for  social  and  pro-poor  schemes  supported  by \ngovernment policies. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact will be sustained pro-poor economic growth. The outcome will be improved \n\n20. \nfiscal sustainability. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n21. \nThe proposed loan will have three outputs: (i) measures to promote non-oil and private \nsector development implemented, (ii) measures to increase employment implemented, and (iii) \npriority expenditures to sustain jobs and social expenditure maintained. \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n22. \nTo  meet  the  budget  gap  in  2015,  the  government  transferred  $13.4  billion  equivalent \nfrom the NFRK to the budget. Despite this transfer, the budget deficit is projected at $6.8 billion \nequivalent. The government will finance $4.8 billion equivalent of the budget deficit through the \nissuance of bonds, including from internal sources. The World Bank is expected to provide $1.0 \nbillion in 2015 and $1.0 billion in 2016 through its development policy financing.  \n \n23. \nThe  government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  $1  billion  loan  in  2015  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  under  the  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  to  support  critical \ncountercyclical  expenditures.24 One  of  the  features  of  the  Countercyclical  Support  Facility,  as \nmainstreamed  under  the  2011  Review  of  ADB\u2019s  Policy-Based  Lending,  is  the  ceiling  of  $500 \nmillion  for  lending  to  each  country.25 To  support  the  government\u2019s  request,  it  is  recommended \nthat the ceiling be waived for this proposed loan. The lending terms are considered appropriate \nwith regards to the government debt repayment capacity and with ADB\u2019s risk-bearing capacity. \nADB\u2019s  risk-bearing  capacity  and the  proposed  $1 billion  loan  are  considered  to  be  in line  with \nADB\u2019s long-term capital adequacy framework.26  \n \n24. \nADB  will  release  the  proposed  loan  in  two  equal  tranches  of  $500  million.  The  first \ntranche will be released upon loan effectiveness. ADB management will authorize release of the \nsecond  tranche  once  the  government  has  met  the  following  disbursement  conditions:  (i)  the \nestablishment of a single database for tax and customs administration is approved through an \norder  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  (ii)  the  establishment  of  an  information  system  for  e-\ndeclaration  of  customs  clearance  is  approved  through  an  order  of  the  MOF,  (iii)  a  draft  law  is \nsubmitted to the Parliament to increase attractiveness of investment in the electricity generation \nsubsector. The tariff policy will introduce a feed-in tariff structure based on a fixed component to \ncover capital expenditures and a variable component to cover generation costs; and (iv) a draft \nlaw is submitted to the Parliament to introduce optimized social aid with a targeted approach.27 \n                                                \n24  Compliance status with the access criteria for Countercyclical Support Facility is in Appendix 4. \n25 ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n27  See Loan Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\nThe  loan  amount  is  considered  appropriate.  Borrowing  from  MDBs  reflects  a  rational \n25. \ndebt strategy that minimizes the cost of debt to the budget, subject to the timeliness of cash flow \nto meet  budget  needs. A further  drawdown on  the  NFRK  to stabilize the  economy  will  require \nthe government to amend the rules of operation of the NFRK, which exist to stabilize medium-\nterm  expenditure  plans  and  ensure  long-term  savings  when  oil  resources  are  depleted. \nRepeated  amendments  risk  weakening  Kazakhstan\u2019s  international  investment  position,  as \nNFRK  size  and  management  is  a  key  factor  in  assessing  sovereign  creditworthiness.  Lack  of \nMDB  support  would  force  the  government  to  access  international  financial  markets  when  the \ncost  of  borrowing  is  expected  to  increase,  given  the  higher  perceived  risk  suggested  by \navailable market indicators. Lack of MDB support in 2015 will also have negative implications for \nthe  debt  management  strategy,  and  affect  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  maintain  priority  social \nexpenditures  during  this  fragile  economic  period.  The  proposed  loan  will  have  a  5-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; straight line repayment option with a 10% discount factor; \nan  annual  interest rate will  be  determined in  accordance  with ADB\u2019s  London  interbank-offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility  plus  200  basis  points;  a  commitment  charge  of  75  basis \npoints  on  the  undisbursed  loan  balance;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement.28  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe  MOF  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  proposed  loan.  The  implementing \n26. \nagencies  will  be  the  Ministry  of  National  Economy,  the  Ministry  of  Healthcare  and  Social \nDevelopment,  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  the  NBK  (Table  1).  Macroeconomic  and  financial \nsector  conditions  will  be  monitored  to  determine  the  impact  of  countercyclical  measures.  The \ngovernment  will  provide  annual  reports  to  ADB  on  (i)  macroeconomic  and  financial  sector \nconditions;  (ii)  expenditures  made  from  the  republican  budget  to  support  the  countercyclical \nmeasures,  as  well  as  the  budget  execution;  and  (iii)  implementation  of  countercyclical \nmeasures,  including  progress  in  the  implementation  of  the  Nurly  Zhol  development  program, \nand the Employment Roadmap 2020. \n \n\nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nSeptember 2015\u2013December 2016 \n31 December 2016 \n\n(i)  Executing agency \n(ii)  Key implementing agencies  Ministry of National Economy, Ministry of Healthcare and Social Development \n\nMinistry of Finance \n\nMinistry of Energy, National Bank of Kazakhstan \nThe proposed $1 billion loan for countercyclical support will be disbursed in \ntwo tranches: $500 million upon effectiveness and $500 million on completion \nof disbursement conditions in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time). \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nA. \n\nGovernance \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n27. \nA system of budget preparation and reporting is in place, and monthly budget execution \nreports  are  available  on  the  MOF  website.

In  2013,  the \ngovernment adopted public audits and prepared a draft law on public audit and financial control, \nbut  it  has  not  been  passed.29 The  budget  does  not  cover  all  fiscal  activities.  Budget  execution \nand  accounting  procedures  are  not  regularly  applied  to  development  programs,  especially  if \nthey are financed through transfers from the NFRK.30 Revenue collection is consolidated within \none  authority  to  create  a  favorable  climate  for  businesses  and  reduce  administrative  barriers. \nProcurement  is  decentralized  to  national  and  regional  bodies,  and  is  executed  through  the \nelectronic  government  procurement  web  portal  established  in  2008.  The  Public  Procurement \nLaw  was  updated.  Elements  of  e-procurement  were  introduced,  and  public  procurement \nrequirements  amended  to  reflect  Eurasian  Economic  Union  requirements.  To  further  align  the \nlaw  with  these  requirements,  a  new  amendment  for  the  Public  Procurement  Law  has  been \nsubmitted  to  Parliament,  including  new  procurement  mechanisms,  such  as  online  contract \nsigning. It is expected to become effective on 1 January 2016. \n \n28. \nA  legal  and  institutional  framework  for  combating  corruption  is  in  place.  The  anti-\ncorruption law, adopted in 1998, defines the core principles underlying the anticorruption effort, \ntypes  of  corruption  crimes,  and  responsible  anticorruption  agencies.  It  supports  and  protects \nwhistle-blowing. The criminal code criminalizes active and passive bribery, attempted corruption, \nextortion, money laundering, abuse of office, and bribe facilitation by third parties. On 6 August \n2014,  the  Agency  of  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan  on  Fighting  Economic  and  Corruption  was \ndissolved,  and  the  function  for  fighting  corruption  was  transferred  to  the  newly  established \nAgency  for  Civil  Service  Affairs  and  Fight  against  Corruption. 31  In  December  2014,  the \nAnticorruption Strategy 2015\u20132025 was adopted.32 Kazakhstan joined the ADB\u2013Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development Anticorruption Initiative for Asia\u2013Pacific in May 2002, \nand  the  Istanbul  Anti-corruption  Action  Plan  in  2003. 33  It  acceded  to  the  United  Nations \nConvention against Corruption in June 2008. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MOF.  In  October  2013,  the \ninternational board of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative assigned Kazakhstan the \nstatus  of  \u201ccompliant  country\u201d  in  observing  the  international  standard  of  revenue  transparency. \nKazakhstan  provides  annual  reports  disclosing  revenues  from  natural  resource  extraction. \nCompanies disclose what they have paid, and the government discloses what it has received.34 \n \nB. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n29. \nThe proposed loan will help the government (i) meet expenditures for social support and \nservices,  (ii)  maintain  the  confidence  of  international  markets,  (iii)  invest  in  education \nimprovements  and  other  social  infrastructure;  and  (iv)  improve  employment  and  social \nprotection  for  low  income  families.  This  will  enable  more  inclusive  growth  and  economic \ndiversification,  with  increasing  business  growth  and  employment.

Adverse impact of the crisis \n\n(i)  Kazakhstan experienced a \n\nsignificant reduction in growth, \ntrade, and consumption; an \nincrease in dollarization; and a \ncontraction in bank lending. \n\n \nAsian Development Bank Assessment \nIn  2014,  Kazakhstan  experienced  two  external  factors  that  impacted  economic  growth,  revenue \nperformance, and the government\u2019s ability to mitigate the effects through countercyclical expenditures. \nThe first was the spillover effects from the economic slowdown and uncertain situation of the Russian \nFederation, which triggered a downward adjustment in the tenge exchange rate equivalent to 16.2%, or \na  19.4%  rise  in  tenge\u2013dollar  exchange  rate.  The  second  was  the  steep  fall  in  global  oil  prices,  which \ndropped over 50% from the end of 2013 to the end of 2014. \n \nThese developments have left Kazakhstan in difficult economic circumstances.  GDP in Kazakhstan fell \nfrom 6.0% in 2013 to 4.3% in 2014, and is expected to decrease to 1.9% in 2015 according to the Asian \nDevelopment  Outlook  (1.5%  according  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  of  Kazakhstan).  The  year-on-year \ndecline in growth is projected to be 56% in 2015. On a 3-year average GDP growth rate, the projected \ndecline from 2011\u20132013 to 2014\u20132016 is 46%. Following the global financial crisis, GDP growth has not \nreached pre-crisis growth rates, which averaged 9.8% during 2005\u20132007. Kazakhstan can be classified \nas a severely affected country. \n \nOil prices dropped 51% from January 2013 to June 2015. As of 10 July 2015, the Brent spot price was \n$58.73. Oil revenue accounts for about 20% of GDP, 50% of total revenues, and 76% of exports. The \nfiscal break-even oil price is $80.00 for 2015 (as of May 2015). This is the oil price at which the fiscal \nbalance  is  zero.  The  fiscal  deficit  of  2.7%  in  2014  is  projected  at  3.0%  for  2015.  The  external  break-\neven oil price is $105.30 for 2015 (as of October 2014). This is the oil price at which the current account \nbalance is zero. The current account balance in percent of GDP is projected at -1.0% in 2015 according \nto  the  Asian  Development  Outlook  (the  IMF  projects  a  current  account  balance  in  percent  of  GDP  at  \n-4.4% in 2015.) Futures prices indicate a sustained period of low oil prices: $68.30/barrel in 2015 and \n$77.20/barrel in 2022, below the fiscal and external break-even points.  \n \nFollowing the announcement by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation of a transition to a floating \nexchange rate in 2013, the tenge has appreciated 32.1% against the Russian ruble from January 2013 \nto  June  2015.  Since  September  2013,  the  tenge  has  been  measured  against  a  basket  of  currencies. \nWhile  this  helped  decrease  the  effect  of  the  weakening  Russian  ruble,  the  depreciation  of  the  ruble \ntriggered a downward adjustment of the tenge\u2013dollar exchange rate in February 2014. At this time, NBK \nreset its exchange rate band for the tenge at T185 \u00b1T3 = $1, from T155 the previous day; equivalent to \na  16.2%  downward  adjustment  of  the  exchange  rate,  or  a  19.4%  rise  in  the  tenge\u2013dollar  rate.  It  has \nsince  been  reset  twice:  in  September  2014  at  an  asymmetric  band  T185  +T3  to  T185  -T15  =  $1, \nwidening the band to T170\u2013T188; and in July 2015 to T185 +T13 to T185 -T15, widening the band to \nT170\u2013T198 = $1. The tenge has depreciated 20.2% against the dollar, depreciated  17.3% against the \nyuan, and appreciated 26.2% against the ruble from February 2014 to July 2015. Deposit dollarization \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nCountercyclical  Support  Facility \nCriteria and Indicators \n\n(ii) Kazakhstan is facing significant \nfiscal constraints because of the \neffects of external developments. \n\n \n\n \nAsian Development Bank Assessment \nhas increased from 37.4% in 2013 to 52.2% in May 2015. Loan dollarization has remained largely the \nsame  at  29.7%  as  of  May  2015.  Dollarization  can  limit  the  effectiveness  of  monetary  policy,  and \nincrease the likelihood of balance sheet and liquidity risks.  \n \nIn  the  long  run,  the  depreciation  of  the  ruble  against  the  tenge  is  weighing  heavily  on  the \ncompetitiveness of Kazakhstan\u2019s non-oil and nonmetal exports, with cheaper imports from the Russian \nFederation outcompeting domestic products. In total, exports declined 7.6% in 2014 and are projected \nto  drop  by  32.0%  in  2015,  and  be  unchanged  in  2016.  In  2014,  exports  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina  decreased  by  31.7%,  to  the  Netherlands  by  11.8%,  and  to  the  Russian  Federation  by  11.9%. \nImports decreased by  14.5% in 2014, and  are  projected to contract by  10% in 2015 on lower  volume \nand  declining  prices  for  goods  from  the  Russian  Federation.  In  2013,  imports  from  the  Russian \nFederation decreased by  23.6%, from the People\u2019s Republic of China  by  11.9%,  and  from  the  United \nStates by 6.4%. \n \nIn  addition,  (i)  inflation  increased  from  5.8%  in  2013  to  6.7%  in  2014.  In  June  2015,  year-on-year \ninflation had fallen to 3.9%, below the authorities\u2019 objective target range of 6%\u20138%; (ii) bank lending has \nslowed  from  a  credit  expansion  of  13.4%  in  2013  to  a  credit  contraction  of  1.9%  in  May;  (iii) \nconsumption growth declined from 12.8% in 2013 to 2.5% in 2014 (consumption is a key growth driver); \nand  (iv)  the  budget  deficit  expanded  from  2.0%  of  GDP  in  2013  to  2.7%  in  2014,  and  is  projected  at \n3.0% of GDP in 2015. \n \nThe fiscal deficit is expected to expand in 2015 to 3.0% of GDP or $6.8 billion equivalent, and to 2.4% \nor  $5.8  billion  equivalent  in  2016.  This  deficit  estimate  was  calculated  after  revisions  to  the  budget  in \nMarch 2015, when revenues were reduced by 12.9% and expenditures by 4.8%. Slower growth, lower \noil  revenues,  cuts  in  export  duties,  and  constrained  imports  are  expected  to  limit  revenue  growth  to \n14.5% of GDP in 2015 and 13.8% in 2016. Tax income is expected to decrease to 7.4% in 2015 and \nincrease again in 2016 to 10.1%. Expenditure is forecast at 17.5% of GDP in 2015 and 16.2% in 2016. \nPlanned wage increases for 2015 have been postponed. The government increased funding for social \nsupport  and  services,  which  comprise  39.1%  of  budget  expenditures,  6.9%  of  GDP,  or  $15.3  billion \nequivalent.  Expenditures  were  also  increased  to  support  for  example  financing  for  agriculture  and \nindustry.  In  2013  and  2014,  social  support  and  services  comprised  38.5%  and  37.5%  of  total \nexpenditures respectively. \n \nThe projected deficit suggests that public and publicly guaranteed debt will increase to 17.6% of GDP in \n2015 and to 19.0% in 2016. The revised budget is based on oil price forecasts of $50.00/barrel. This is \nnot sufficient to meet the fiscal break-even oil price\u2014the price of oil at which the fiscal balance is zero\u2014\nof $80/barrel for 2015 (as of May 2015). Government policies to balance the budget and the NFRK will \nbe aimed at developing a consistent medium-term macro-fiscal framework; increasing the sustainability \n\n\fCountercyclical  Support  Facility \nCriteria and Indicators \n\n(iii) Available market indicators (credit \ndefault swap spreads and market-\nimplied ratings) suggest a higher \nperceived credit risk, which is \nlikely to increase the future cost of \nborrowing. \n\n2. Planned countercyclical \ndevelopment expenditures for \npoverty reduction \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n23 \n\n \nAsian Development Bank Assessment \nof the non-oil deficit over the medium term; and reducing the non-oil deficit from 7.7% of GDP in 2014 to \n2.8%  by  2020.  The  non-oil  deficit  is  expected  to  increase  in  2015,  and  then  fall  to  a  sustainable \nmedium-term rate. Measured on IMF methodology, the non-oil deficit is projected to fall to 8.7% of GDP \nby 2020, which compares to an estimated medium-term sustainable non-oil deficit 5.5% on GDP. (The \nexternal  break-even  point  is  about  $105.30  for  2015.  The  external  break-even  oil  price  is  when  the \ncurrent account balance is zero.) \n \nTo  meet  budget  expenditures  in  2015,  the  government  transferred  $13.4  billion  equivalent  from  the \nNFRK to the budget. Despite this transfer, the budget deficit is projected at $6.8 billion equivalent. The \ngovernment will finance $4.8 billion equivalent of the budget deficit through issuance of bonds and from \ninternal  sources,  including  issuance  of  government  bonds  for  internal  borrowing  from  the  Unified \nPension  Fund  and  other  investors.  The  government  has  requested  ADB  to  finance  $1  billion  in  2015 \nthrough  the  proposed  loan  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources.  The  World  Bank  is  expected  to \nprovide  \n$1.0 billion in 2015 and $1.0 billion in 2016 through development policy financing. \n \nBased on available information, market indicators suggest a higher perceived credit risk, which is likely \nto increase the cost of borrowing. Increased borrowing on the international debt market might also have \nnegative implications for the debt management strategy. \n \nIn  2015,  both  S&P  and  Moody\u2019s  downgraded  Kazakhstan\u2019s  sovereign  rating,  although  it  is  still \ninvestment grade. Sovereign downgrades can lead to greater increases in the cost of financing, and the \ngovernment  will  have  to  pay  higher  interest  on  its  debt.  Increased  costs  to  service  national  debt\u2014the \ninterest paid on what is owed\u2014affect the entire economy. Increased borrowing on the international debt \nmarket is likely to have negative implications in terms of the debt management strategy. \n \nKazakhstan  on  14  July  2015  issued  a  10-year  dollar  denominated  bond  in  the  amount  of  $2.5  billion \nwith a 5.1% coupon and a 30-year dollar denominated bond in the amount of $1.5 billion with a 6.5% \ncoupon.  By  contrast,  a  Eurobond  was  issued  in  October  2014  in  10-year  dollar-denominated  bonds \npriced to  yield 4.07% and 30-year dollar-denominated bonds priced to  yield 5.12%, prices which were \n1.03% and 1.38% lower respectively than the 2015 bonds. \n \nThe government has introduced countercyclical policy measures to mitigate the fallout from the difficult \nexternal  environment  and  to  deliver  conditions  for  sustainable  long-term  inclusive  economic  growth. \nThese are aimed at improving the investment climate, expanding and diversifying the non-oil subsector, \nand generating employment. \n \nEarly  in  2014,  the  government  launched  a  long-term  development  strategy,  Kazakhstan  2050,  to \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nCountercyclical  Support  Facility \nCriteria and Indicators \n\n(i)  The government has specific \ncountercyclical development \nexpenditure programs to be \nsupported by the proposed loan, \nand is committed to their \nimplementation. \n\n \n\n(ii) The countercyclical development \nexpenditure program includes \ninvestment in public infrastructure. \n\n(iii) The countercyclical development \nexpenditure program includes \nsocial assistance targeting the \npoor. \n\n \n\n \nAsian Development Bank Assessment \ntransform  the  economy  into  a  diversified,  private  sector-driven,  developed  economy  by  2050.  The \ngovernment  has  also  taken  steps  to  attract  investment  in  the  non-oil  economy.  The  Framework  for \nAttracting  Foreign  and  Domestic  Investment  into  Kazakhstan  presented  in  April  2014  includes  a \npackage  of  incentives  for  investors.  In  May  2015,  the  Plan  for  the  Nation:  100  Concrete  Steps  for \nImplementation  of  Institutional  Reforms  was  approved  in  response  to  current  global  and  domestic \nchallenges. A detailed action plan includes policy improvements, outputs, and activities to be completed \nin 2015. It supports activities in both the Nurly Zhol and the Employment Roadmap 2020. \n \nIn March 2015, the Employment Roadmap 2020 was approved. For 2015, $200 million equivalent has \nbeen  allocated  to  implement  the  Employment  Roadmap  with  similar  budget  allocations  for  2016  and \n2017. \n \nIn  April  2015,  the  Nurly  Zhol  development  program  was  approved.  It  includes  a  program  of  $9  billion \nequivalent  with  annual  allocations  of  about  $4.3  billion  equivalent  in  2015,  $2.0  billion  equivalent  in \n2016, and $2.7 billion equivalent in 2017.  \n \nIn the revised budget of March 2015, the government increased funding for social support and services, \nwhich comprise 39.1% of budget expenditures, 6.9% of GDP, or $15.3 billion equivalent. Expenditures \nwere also increased to support, for example, financing for agriculture and industry.  \n \nThe  IMF  notes  the  multi-year  fiscal  stimulus  package  is  justified  on  countercyclical  grounds  and \ninfrastructure needs, and given large buffers. \n \nUnder  the  Nurly  Zhol  development  program,  the  government  will  implement  measures  to  support \neconomic  growth  and  employment  through  continuing  reforms.  Spending  priorities  include  (i) \ndevelopment  and  modernization  of  infrastructure  to  support  education,  tourism,  housing,  utilities, \ntransport,  and  logistics;  (ii)  development  of  non-oil  business  sectors,  including  manufacturing  and \nagribusiness;  and  (iii)  improvement  of  the  business  environment,  including  increased  availability  of \nfinance.  The  Nurly  Zhol  includes  allocations  to  address  problems  with  (i)  the  shortage  of  preschool \neducational  institutions,  (iii)  three-shift  education  in  secondary  schools,  and  (iv)  poor  materials  and \ntechnical equipment in higher education institutions. \n \nThe Employment Roadmap 2020 includes active measures to (i) promote employment of self-employed \nand  unemployed;  (ii)  develop  human  resources;  and  (iii)  improve  targeted  social  assistance.  Target \npopulation groups include  unemployed, part-time, low-income, and the self-employed, including youth, \nwomen, and disabled.  \n \n\n\fCountercyclical  Support  Facility \nCriteria and Indicators \n3.

The  IMF  assessment  notes  the  stimulus  to  be \nappropriately front-loaded and aimed at modernizing critical infrastructure and promoting private sector \ndevelopment an recognize important steps taken to overhauls the monetary policy framework in support \nof inflation targeting. \n \n\nfinancial  stability,  and \n\nMonetary  policy  in  2014  aimed  to  maintain  price  stability  and  rehabilitate  the  banking  system,  while \npreventing  a  post-devaluation  downturn.  Monetary  policy  for  2015  and  2016  aims  to  maintain \nto  build  Kazakhstan\u2019s  domestic  and  external \nmacroeconomic  and \ncompetitiveness.a  To  restore  trust  in  the  tenge  and  stimulate  lending,  measures  have  been  taken  to \naddress  both  the  scarcity  of  long-term  tenge  funding  and  high  dollarization  in  the  banking  system. \nPreliminary measures to prepare for inflation targeting will be introduced.b Inflation targeting will require \na  shift  to  a  more  flexible  exchange  rate.  It  would  help  insulate  the  economy  and  public  finances  from \nexternal  shocks,  and  curb  inflation.  NBK  plans  to  moderate  exchange  rate  fluctuations,  while  limiting \nintervention  in  the  foreign  exchange  market  to  conserve  reserves.  NBK  and  the  government  have \nstarted  to  implement  measures  to  reduce  dollarization  in  the  economy.  In  early  2015,  the  authorities \ndoubled  the  ceiling  on  tenge  deposit  insurance  guarantees  to  T10  million,  while  maintaining  the  T5 \nmillion limit on foreign currency deposits. \n \nThe  budget  was  revised  in  March  2015,  and  revenues  were  reduced  by  14.0%  and  expenditures  by \n10.0%.  The  government  increased  funding  for  social  support  and  services,  which  comprise  39.1%  of \nbudget  expenditures,  6.9%  of  GDP,  or  $15.3  billion  equivalent.  (In  2013  and  2014  social  support  and \nservices comprised 38.5% and 37.5% of total expenditures respectively.) Budget expenditures for 2015 \nwere also increased to support financing for agriculture and industry.  \n \nIn  2014,  the  government  allocated  about  $10.9  billion  equivalent  from  the  NFRK.  In  2015  total \nallocations will be about $13.4 billion equivalent, and in 2016 about $11.2 billion  equivalent. In terms of \nGDP, transfers from the NFRK will increase to 6.0% in 2015 and decline to 4.6% in 2016. The projected \ndeficit of 3.0% of GDP in 2015 and 2.4% in 2016 suggests that public and publicly guaranteed debt will \nincrease to 17.6% of GDP in 2015 and to 19.0% in 2016. \n \nGovernment  policies  to  balance  the  budget  and  the  NFRK  will  be  aimed  at  developing  a  consistent \nmedium-term macro-fiscal framework; increasing the sustainability of the non-oil deficit over the medium \nterm; and reducing the non-oil deficit from 7.7% of GDP in 2014 to 2.8% by 2020. The non-oil deficit is \nexpected  to  increase  in  2015,  and  then  fall  to  a  sustainable  medium-term  rate.  Measured  on  IMF \nmethodology,  the  non-oil  deficit  is  projected  to  fall  to  8.7%  of  GDP  by  2020,  which  compares  to  an \nestimated medium-term sustainable non-oil deficit 5.5% on GDP.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \nAsian Development Bank Assessment \nKazakhstan  has  established  a  sound  system  of  budget  preparation  and  reporting.  Monthly  budget \nexecution reports are available on the website of the Ministry of Finance. To enhance budget efficiency \nand improve fiscal sustainability, government agencies have migrated to accrual-based accounting and \nfinancial  reporting  in  line  with  the  International  Public  Sector  Accounting  Standards.  In  2013,  the \ngovernment adopted public audits in Kazakhstan and prepared a draft law on public audit and financial \ncontrol. However, the pending adoption of the law delays the implementation of relevant audit standards \nand the setup of internal audit units. The budget does not cover all fiscal activity. Budget execution and \naccounting  procedures  are  not  regularly  applied  to  development  programs,  especially  if  they  are \nfinanced through transfers from the NFRK. The government has consolidated revenue collection within \none authority to create a favorable climate for businesses and reduce administrative barriers. \n \nGross official reserves increased from $24.7 billion in 2013 to $28.9 billion in 2014. In terms of months \nof  merchandise  imports,  reserves  increased  from  4.7  months  in  2013  to  6.2  months  in  2014. \nKazakhstan's  key  strengths  include  its  relatively  large  economy,  low  public  debt,  and  correspondingly \nhigh  debt  affordability.  Kazakhstan's  budget  is  supported  by  the  NFRK,  the  resource  savings  that \nprovide  a  significant  buffer  against  external  shocks.  Total  assets  in  the  NFRK  were  $73.2  billion \nequivalent at the end of 2014 and $69.0 billion equivalent at the end of May 2015. \n \nBased on government macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions, the public debt\u2013GDP ratio is expected to \nincrease to 17.6% in 2015 and to 19.0% in 2016. It is projected to fall to 15.0% by 2018 and to 13.9% \nby 2020, driven by rebounding economic growth and shrinking fiscal deficits. A low debt ratio suggests \nthat public debt is sustainable if government assumptions are realized. Assets of the NFRK support the \nconclusion  that  the  outlook  is  generally  benign.  The  impact  of  the  proposed  loan  on  public  debt \nsustainability  is  assessed  by  a  scenario  that  reflects  disbursement  of  an  ADB  $1  billion  loan  in  2015, \njointly  with  expected  World  Bank  loans  of  $1  billion  in  2015  and  $1  billion  in  2016.c  The  joint  effect \ninitially  raises  the  public  debt  ratio  to  20.2%  by  2016,  compared  with  the  baseline  of  19.0%,  then \nconverges  to  the  baseline  due  to  swift  amortization  and  the  predominantly  benign  debt  dynamics \nincorporated in the projections. The IMF assessment letter notes the multi-year fiscal stimulus package \nis justified on countercyclical grounds and infrastructure needs, and given large buffers. \n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank,  GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International Monetary Fund, NBK = National Bank of Kazakhstan, NFRK = National \nFund of the Republic of Kazakhstan. \na  Monetary Policy Guidelines of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2015, approved by Resolution of the Board of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan \n\n \n\ndated 25 February, 2015 No. 30; and ADB. 2015.
