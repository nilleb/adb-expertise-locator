Sri  Lanka  is  at  a  pivotal  economic  and  demographic \n1. \ncrossroads. In 2018, it crossed the threshold into an upper-middle-income country (UMIC) with a \nper  capita  income  of  $4,060. 1 The  new  government  aims  to  transform  itself  into  a  globally \ncompetitive and inclusive knowledge economy to sustain and further enhance economic growth. \nThe  main  pillars  include  prioritizing  human  capital  development,  strengthening  industry  and \nservice sectors, transforming  agriculture, and infusing new technology to enhance productivity.2 \nAgeing  population  and  increasing  dependency  ratio  in  Sri  Lanka  threaten  to  strain  economic \nresources.3 Sri  Lanka\u2019s  competitiveness  will  depend  on  optimizing  its  workforce  potential.  This \nentails  improving  health  and  education  of  its  youth  to  lift  productivity  and  participation  rates, \nclosing  the  gender  gap  in  the  labor  market,  and  reallocating  labor  across  sectors.  Building  a \nhealthy, diversified, and agile workforce \u2014 receptive to lifelong learning, able to adapt, innovate, \nand leverage new technologies \u2014 is key to the government\u2019s development goal.  Thus, the new \ngovernment  has  prioritized  integrated  and  transformative  reforms  in  the  education  and  health \nsectors to boost human capital development. \n \n2. \nEducation  sector  performance.  Sri  Lanka  has  made  commendable  gains  in  basic \neducation  since  the  1970s.  It  has  achieved  near-universal  primary  enrollment  (99%),  high \nsecondary enrollment (87%), gender parity in access to all levels of education, and a high adult \nliteracy  rate  (93%).  Despite  these  achievements,  Sri  Lanka  lacks  the  technical  and  vocational \nskills  increasingly  demanded  in  industrial  and  service  sectors. 4  Poor  learning  outcome, \ninadequate foundation for twenty first skills and low relevance of education to the labor market \nare  key  challenges.  These  issues  are  exacerbated  by  a  fragmented  education  and  skills \ndevelopment system and the absence of a coordinated and coherent education policy to support \nholistic human capital development.  \n \n3. \nWhile overall access to basic education is high, limited participation in science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects, low learning outcomes, and inadequacies in the \nquality and relevance are key challenges in secondary education. This situation is compounded \nby (i)  limited  opportunities for  tertiary  education,  and  (ii)  inadequate  pathways from  secondary \neducation to skills training and higher education. Student participation in tertiary education and \npost-secondary  non-tertiary  education  (including  skills  training)  measured  by  gross  enrollment \nratio (GER) were 19.6% (2018, 23.4% female) and 3.0% (2017, 2.6% female). In contrast, the \ntertiary GER average for UMICs was 58.1% in 2018.5 This leaves a large number of young people \nentering the job market without substantial employment skills. In sum, gains in basic education \nare not translating into comparable outcomes at the post-secondary level. While Sri Lanka has \nlaid a good foundation for skills development with a dedicated ministry, a regulatory body and the \ndelivery of TVET at different levels by various agencies, several challenges remain. These include: \n(i)  poor  alignment  with  the  private  sector;  (ii)  shortage  of  qualified  instructors  with  industry \nexperience; (iii) outdated training programs and facilities; (iv) weak quality assurance mechanisms; \nand (v) limited institutional capacities.  \n \n\n \n\n1   World Bank.

(accessed 28 January 2020). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nHigher education plays an instrumental role in producing a future-ready workforce, but the \n4. \ngovernment\u2019s  capacity to expand state university  admissions,  especially,  in STEM  subjects,  is \nlimited by constraints in funds, infrastructure, and trained academic staff. Unless higher education \nis  realigned  with  evolving  private  sector  needs,  labor  market  outcomes  will  continue  to  be \nadverse. 6  The  government\u2019s  aim  to  improve  the  access,  quality,  and  relevance  of  higher \neducation programs will require (i) establishing new degree programs and short courses in priority \nSTEM  programs;  (ii)  enabling  the  legal  framework  to  promote  private  sector  accreditation  and \nprovision;  (iii)  addressing  staff  shortage  and  professional  development  in  STEM;  (iv) \nbenchmarking  quality  against  international  standards;  and  (v)  public\u2013private  partnerships  with \nindustries to stimulate research and development.  \n \n5. \nHealth sector performance. Sri Lanka has made impressive gains in ensuring access to \nquality health services for all. Life expectancy at birth increased from 70 years in 1990 to 75 years \nin 2015. Maternal mortality reduced from 75.0 to 30.0 per 100,000 live births, and infant mortality \nfrom  17.9  to  8.0  per  1,000  live  births  over  the  same  period.  Despite  these  improvements,  Sri \nLanka faces new health challenges related to population ageing, changing disease patterns, and \nchanging lifestyles. These dynamics have resulted in the rise of noncommunicable diseases while \nre-emerging  and  emerging  communicable  diseases  remain  a  threat.  Health  disparities  are \nsignificant,  with  lagging  regions  and  vulnerable  population  pockets.  The  government  has \nintroduced policy reform in 2018 to address the health challenges for a more responsive, people-\ncentered  health  care  system  that  is  evidence-based,  delivers  a  comprehensive  package  of \nservices, and can provide continuity of care with adequate financial risk protection for the users.7 \n \n6. \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s assistance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been \na  long-term  partner  in  education  sector  development  in  Sri  Lanka,  covering  school  education, \nskills development, and higher education. In the education sector, ADB currently supports the (i) \nSkills  Sector  Enhancement  Program  to  ensure  equitable  access  to  high-quality  and  relevant \ndemand-driven skills training; and (ii) Science and Technology Human Resource Development \nProject  to  nurture  technology-oriented  graduates  equipped  with  market-relevant  skills  and  an \nentrepreneurial spirit. With the approval of Health System Enhancement Project in 2018, ADB re-\nengaged  in  the sector  after  20  years  and  currently  supports the  government\u2019s  policy  reform to \nreorganize health care delivery towards an equity-based, more responsive, and comprehensive \nprimary  health  care system,  in particular,  in rural  areas  and  lagging  regions.  New  support  has \nbeen  proposed  to  ADB,  namely  the  (i)  Secondary  Education  Sector  Improvement  Program  to \nenhance the quality and relevance of STEM subjects along with 21st century skills at the senior \nsecondary level, essential for preparing Sri Lankan graduates for a knowledge economy; and (ii) \nproposed Innovation Capacity Development in Higher Education Project. \n \n7. \nThe  government  appreciated  the  design  and  implementation  of  ADB\u2019s  prior  technical \nassistance (TA),8 which provided strategic technical inputs through resource persons and expert \n\n \n\n6   Disciplines offered are skewed towards arts and management, and less than 20.0% of graduates are from science \nand technology subjects. Female enrollment is mostly concentrated in liberal arts (82.4%), where unemployment is \nthe  highest.  In  addition,  university  graduates  fail  to  meet  the  requirements  of  employers  in  communication, \ninformation and communication technology (ICT), and soft skills. \n\n7   Government of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Health, Nutrition, and Indigenous Medicine. 2018.

Manila; (ii) ADB. 2018. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nconsultants  for  project  preparation  and  implementation.  The  TA  is  near  completion.  The \ngovernment  has  requested  similar  support.    Two  key  lessons  emanated  from  the  previous  TA \nimplementation.  First,  it  is  important  to  enhance  the  capacity  of  executing  and  implementing \nagencies in ensuring quality project design, effective project implementation, and overall portfolio \nperformance. ADB support can add value in terms of sharing lessons across projects, introducing \ninnovative approaches, strategic planning, and implementation support in selected areas. Second, \nADB is in a strategic position to provide integrated and coordinated technical inputs across the \nthree  subsectors  in  education  (secondary,  TVET,  and  higher  education)  and  health.  Working \nacross these three subsectors and with the health system, ADB can promote synergy, effective \nimplementation,  expanded  private  sector  participation,  and  enhanced  relevance  and  quality  of \neducation  and  health  services,  all  of  which  will  lead  to  the  outcome  of  a  stronger  and  healthy \nworkforce to support national economic goals.  \n \n8. \nRationale for a transaction technical assistance facility. The proposed transaction TA \nfacility will support project preparation, capacity building, due diligence, and improved readiness \nfor pipeline projects that are included in the country operations business plan (COBP),9 as agreed \nwith the government during the TA facility\u2019s timeframe. It will also support the implementation of \nongoing projects.10 The TA facility is aligned with (i) ADB\u2019s strategy 2030;11 (ii) the government\u2019s \nEducation Sector Development Plan, 2018\u20132025;12 (iii) Sri Lanka National Health Policy 2016\u2013\n2025;13 and  (iv)  Sustainable Development Goal  5.14 The  TA facility  will  support  strategic  policy \nadvisory and technical inputs on a range of health and education issues, strategy development, \nfinancial  management,  engineering  and  procurement,  quality  assurance,  and  evaluation \napproaches, including independent verification of results. It will bridge capability gaps, apply best \npractices, and foster innovative solutions for common challenges in the sector. In particular, the \nTA  will  bring  in  international  expertise  not  available  in-country  in  the  areas  of  curriculum, \npedagogy,  public\u2013private  partnerships,  and  healthcare  reform.  The  TA  facility  is  listed  in  the \nCOBP for Sri Lanka, 2020\u20132022, with the title Support for Human Capital Development Initiative. \nThe TA facility approach is suitable as it will enhance project preparation efficiency and improve \nproject implementation readiness by (i) allowing the same experts to be mobilized for similar due \ndiligence  activities,  (ii)  facilitating  learning  on  project  processing  and  implementation  across \ndifferent  projects,  (iii)  creating  synergies  from  working  with  common  expertise  and  improving \nknowledge  transfer,  and  (iv)  strengthening  coordination  and  synergy  among  various  technical \ninputs and capacity building efforts. Overall, this TA facility will reduce transaction costs compared \nto resources required for separate stand-alone transaction TA projects.  \n \n\n \n\nProposed  Loans  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka:  Science  and  Technology  Human  Resource \nDevelopment Project.

This output will support the preparation of selected programs and/or projects15 for \npotential ADB financing. The scope of activities will include (i) analytical studies such as sector \nassessments, technical assessments on curriculum, pedagogy, demand assessments involving \ntracer and/or employer surveys, TVET strategy, and stakeholder analysis as appropriate for each \nensuing  project;  (ii)  feasibility  studies  as  required  for  the  ensuing  project;  (iii)  development  of \nresults  frameworks  and/or  design  and  monitoring  frameworks;  (iv)  economic  and  financial \nassessments, and social, gender, and poverty analyses; (v) safeguard assessments, including \nenvironment and social safeguards; and (vi) due diligence in financial management, procurement, \nplus other institutional arrangements for executing and implementing agencies. The output will \nalso support projects to achieve project readiness through advance procurement activities, where \nrequired.   \n \n10. \nOutput 2: Strengthened project management capacity for achieving quality results \nin social sector operations. Technical expertise and capacity building support will be provided \nto selected executing and implementing agencies for the successful implementation of health and \neducation  projects.  Selective,  high-quality  inputs  will  support  the  achievement  of  results  in \nsecondary education, skills, higher education, and health. At the same time, the TA will support \nquality  assurance  mechanisms  and  systems,  such  as  the  verification  of  disbursement-linked \nindicators,  monitoring  and  evaluation  approaches/systems, \nfinancial  management,  and \nprocurement. Having a single TA facility will ensure coordinated and integrated inputs across the \nvarious education subsectors, which will promote the synergy of results.  \n \n11. \nOutput  3:  Enhanced  capacity  to  develop  and  apply  innovative  practices  and \ntechnology  solutions  for  project  design  and  implementation.  Technical  expertise  and \ncapacity  building  will  support  the  exchange  of  national  and  international  best  practices  in \nsecondary  education,  skills  training,  and  higher  education.  The  topics  will  cover:  (i)  learner \ncentered approaches that build 21st century skills, including critical thinking and problem solving; \n(ii) inquiry-based and investigative pedagogy, including long-term, sustained approach to building \ncapacity of  teachers that will include opportunities to practice new approaches and a focus on \ncoaching  and  ongoing  feedback  mechanism  to  improve  teaching  in  the  classroom;    (iii) \ninformation  and  communication  technology  solutions  for  education  and  health  sectors  (for \nexample, EdTech programs in classroom practices and teacher training); and (iv) cutting-edge \nmonitoring and evaluation approaches or platforms. The output will promote innovative strategies \nto improve learning outcomes and 21st century skills aligned with the modern global economy, \nexpand  post-secondary  pathways,  improve  the  effectiveness  of  pedagogy  and  leadership \nprograms,  increase  the  participation  of  girls  in  STEM,  and  address  the  low  performance  and \ndropout of boys. Much of the support will be provided through technical inputs and guidance on-\nthe-job during planning, implementation, and coaching. Some support will be provided through \nseminars, workshops, and national and overseas study visits. This output will also document good \ndesign  and  implementation  of  projects  to  showcase  innovative  strategies  and  solutions  in  the \nhealth and education sectors. \n\nC. \n\nCost and Financing \n\n12. \nThe TA facility is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s TA Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed \n\n15  (i) Proposed Secondary Education Sector Improvement Program; (ii) Proposed Innovation Capacity Development in \n\nHigher Education Project; and (iii) potential new program for skills training. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nin Appendix 1. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, \noffice  space,  office  supplies,  secretarial  and  coordination  assistance,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. The government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing project. \n \nD. \n \n13. \nThe  executing  agency  will  be  the  National  Planning  Department  under  the  Ministry  of \nFinance. The implementing agencies are the Ministry of Education; Ministry of Skills Development, \nEmployment and Labour Relations; Ministry of Higher Education, Technology and Innovation; and \nthe Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medical Services. ADB will administer the TA facility. The \nSouth  Asia  Human  and  Social  Development  Division  will  select,  supervise,  and  evaluate \nconsultants in close coordination with the executing and implementing agencies. The TA facility \nwill be implemented over 3 years, from May 2020 to April 2023.   \n \n14. \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in the table below. \n\nAspects \nIndicative implementation period \nExecuting agency \nImplementing agency \n\nConsultants \n\nDisbursement \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nMay 2020 to April 2023 \nNational Planning Department, Ministry of Finance. \nMinistry of Education; Ministry of Skills Development, Employment and \nLabour Relations; Ministry Higher Education, Technology and Innovation; \nand the Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medical Services \nTo be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual: individual \nconsultant selection \n\nInternational (39.2 person-\nmonths) and national (96.5 \nperson-months) \nThe TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n\n$0.93 \nmillion \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CQS = consultant qualification selection.

The  consultants  will  be  recruited \nusing individual consultant selection method and deployed based on the requirements of each \nproject being prepared or implemented. Individual consultant selection, rather than firm selection, \nis  considered  appropriate,  because  the  TA  facility  involves  multiple  activities  that  are  not \nnecessarily interdependent and will require a varied range of consultants and services. ADB will \nengage  the  consultants  following  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  and  Regulations  (2017,  as \namended  from  time  to  time)  and  its  associated  project  administration  instructions  and/or  staff \ninstructions.16  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n\n \nThe  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \n16. \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Support  for  Human  Capital  Development  Initiative,  and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n\n16   Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTABLE A1.1: COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n\n6 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nItem \nA.
