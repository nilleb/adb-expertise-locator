Subprogram  1,  cofinanced  by  the  World  Bank  and  the  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  established  a  solid  foundation  for  implementation  of \nreforms in subsequent subprograms. The proposed subprogram 2 will support the second year \nof the programmatic approach. The eighth review of IMF was completed in September 2015.4  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nIn  2014,  Pakistan\u2019s  economy  grew  by  4.1%,  above  the  forecasted  global  growth  of \n3.6%.5 It is estimated that the country\u2019s growth rate could have been 2 percentage points higher \ngiven an adequate energy supply.6 The gap between electricity demand and supply is expected \nto remain about 5,500 megawatts, or 20% of peak demand, until the end of 2017.7 The average \nduration of load shedding in 2014 was around 8\u201310 hours a day in most areas, and up to 18\u201320 \nhours  in  rural  areas. 8  The  chronic  energy  shortage  decreases  business  confidence  and \nnegatively  affects  manufacturing,  trade,  and  consequently  household  income,  often  leading  to \nsocial unrest.  \n \n4. \nPakistan initiated a comprehensive energy sector reform program in the early 1990s, but \nthe results have been mixed and expected efficiencies have not been fully achieved. The past \nreforms  led  to  the  unbundling  of  the  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  into  15 \ncorporatized entities: nine regional power distribution companies (DISCOs), four thermal power \ngeneration companies (GENCOs), the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC), \nand  the  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority.  The  Central  Power  Purchasing  Agency \n(CPPA),  a  unit  within  NTDC,  was licensed  to  act  as  a  single buyer  and seller  of  electricity.  All \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Pakistan. 2013. National Power Policy. Islamabad; ADB. 2014.

Manila. \n\n3  On 4 September 2013, the IMF board approved a $6.7 billion, 36-month program under the extended fund facility \n\nthat aims to reduce inflation and lower the fiscal deficit to a sustainable level.  \n\n    http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2013/cr13287.pdf \n4  The eighth review was completed on 28 September 2015. https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2015/pr15443.htm \n5  IMF. 2014.

Islamabad. \n\n7  NEPRA. 2015. State of the Industry Report 2014. Islamabad. \n8   Captive  power  plants  are  used  as  backup  supply.  The  installed  capacity  of  licensed  captive  power  alone  is  847 \n\nmegawatts, of which 476 megawatts uses oil or diesel fuel (footnote 7). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nentities are still fully owned by the government except for the Karachi Electric Supply Company, \nwhich  was  privatized  in  2005.  Independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  generate  56%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  power.  The  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority  (NEPRA),  established  in \n1997,  determines  tariffs,  issues  licenses,  and  regulates  the  sector.  About  two-thirds  of  the \npopulation  had  access  to  grid  electricity  in  2014,9 and  electricity  consumption  has  remained \nconstrained  at  about  80  terawatt  hours  per  year  since  2009  despite  the  growth  in  demand \n(footnote 7). \n \nThree key constraints to improved sector performance are (i) the gap between end-user \n5. \nand cost recovery tariffs,10 (ii) insufficient investment and limited private sector participation due \nto concerns about electricity payments, and (iii) lack of transparency.11  \n \nTariff  and  subsidies.  A  major  goal  of  the  overall  program  is  improving  the  financial \n6. \ncondition  of  the  electricity  sector  through  elimination  of  (i)  the  difference  between  the  cost-\nrecovery  and  end-user  tariffs,  and  (ii)  nonserviceable  debts.  Past  governments  have  been \nreluctant  to  pass  the  total  cost  of  electricity  to  customers,  resulting  in  substantial  government \nsubsidies.  There  was  a  significant  lag  in  determining  the  tariff,  which  consequently  did  not \nreflect  the  current  cost.  Costs  that  could  not  be  recovered  from  consumers  or  subsidies  were \naccumulated  on  the  books  of  the  DISCOs,  which  failed  to  pay  fully  for  electricity  purchases, \ngiving  rise  to  circular  debt.12 To  address  these  issues,  the  Economic  Coordination  Committee \n(ECC) approved the National Power Tariff and Subsidy Policy Guidelines under subprogram 1, \nwhich set goals for (i) subsidy reduction, (ii) developing improved tariff determination processes, \nand (iii) a mechanism to cap the circular debt. Subprogram 2 was designed to detail and finalize \nthese  mechanisms  (outputs  are  in  paras.  18\u201320).  Subsidies  have  decreased  from  1.8%  \n(FY2013)  to  0.8%  (FY2015)  of  gross  domestic  product  and  have  been  largely  eliminated  for \nindustrial, commercial, and consumers using more than 300 kilowatt-hours per month.13  \n \n7. \nSector performance and private sector participation. The performance of most public \nsector  electricity  companies  is  less  than  optimal,  with  low  operational  efficiency,  poor  service \nquality, and a weak financial position. Subprogram 1 resulted in instructions being given to four \nDISCOs to outsource collection to the private sector, and to all DISCOs to implement a revenue \nprotection program. Two DISCOs have outsourced part of their collections, while two others are \nin  the  process  of  doing  so.  A  detailed  progress  assessment  will  be  made  in  subprogram  3. \nLosses have declined from 21.9% in 2013 to 18.7% in 2015, and collection has increased from \n86% to 89% over the same period. \n \nThe  overall  program  required  the  government  to  develop  performance  contracts  with \n8. \npublic  power  companies.  In  subprogram  1,  the  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power  (MOWP)  signed \nperformance  contracts  with  three  DISCOs.  Subprogram  2  is  designed  to  complete  signing  of \nperformance contracts with all DISCOs, GENCOs, and NTDC (delivered outputs are in para. 23).  \n \n\n                                                \n9   World Bank. 2014. Reducing Poverty by Closing South Asia\u2019s Infrastructure Gap. Washington, DC. \n10 The  gap  between  the  end-user  and  cost-recovery  tariff  consists  of  two  factors:  (i)  the  difference  between  cost- \nrecovery  and  NEPRA-determined  tariffs,  and  (ii)  the  difference  between  NEPRA-determined  and  government-\nnotified tariffs, which are balanced through subsidies.  \n\n11 The details of the sector problem is described in subprogram 1 (footnote 2).  \n12 Circular Debt Impact on Power Sector Investment (accessible from the list of the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Household  customers  accounted  for  47%  of  total  electricity  consumption  in  Pakistan  in  2013  (Government  of \nPakistan, Ministry of Finance. Pakistan Economic Survey 2013\u20132014. Islamabad). The World Bank considers 40% \nof households in Pakistan \u201cpoor\u201d (T. Walker et al. 2014.  Reforming Electricity Subsidies in Pakistan: Measures to \nProtect the Poor. World Bank Policy Paper Series on Pakistan. PK 24/12. Washington, DC: World Bank).  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\nAlthough  IPPs  supply  a  significant  portion  of  electricity  in  Pakistan,  new  private \n9. \ninvestments  have  failed  to  meet  sector  needs,  primarily  because  of  the  lack  of  (i)  clear \ndemarcation  between  technical  and  commercial  operations  of  the  power  grid,  and  (ii)  a \ntransparent  system  for  settlement  and  payments.  Subprogram  1  resulted  in  the  amending  of \nCPPA\u2019s  articles  of  association  to  act  as  an  agent  for  electricity  procurement  on  behalf  of \nDISCOs.  CPPA  signed  agreements  with  GENCOs  as  the  basis  of  new  power  purchase \nagreements under a future power market mechanism, with CPPA acting as the trading hub for \nbulk  suppliers  and  buyers.  Subprogram  2  was  designed  to  complete  the  separation  of  CPPA \nfrom NTDC as another step towards a transparent market mechanism (delivered outputs are in \npara. 23). \n \n10. \nThe reliance on expensive fuel oil for power generation increased from 28% in FY2010 \nto  39%  in  FY2014,  resulting  in  a  rise  in  electricity  cost  (footnote  7).  In  the  long  term,  the \ngovernment  is  developing  hydropower  plants.  In  the  short  term,  additional  domestic  gas \nproduction  for  existing  gas-fired  power  plants  would  reduce  electricity  costs.  The  government \nhas  been  slow  to  implement  the  2012  Petroleum  Exploration  and  Production  Policy,  which \naimed to increase domestic gas production by raising selling prices for producers.14 The overall \nprogram includes an action plan to increase gas production. In 2013, the Ministry of Petroleum \nand  Natural  Resources  (MPNR)  adopted  a  model  petroleum  concession  agreement  based  on \nthe  policy,  which is  serving  as  the  basis for  awarding  new  concessions for  exploration  blocks. \nSubprogram  2  was designed  to  increase gas  production from  existing  wells  (delivered  outputs \nare in para. 22). \n \n11. \nThere  is  low  awareness  in  Pakistan  of  energy  efficiency  as  the  least  costly  means  to \nincrease consumable electricity. The overall program laid out a road map for adoption of fiscal \nincentives  for  energy  conservation  and  mandatory  application  of  the  minimum  energy \nperformance standards for energy intensive technologies. Subsequent subprograms (beginning \nwith 2) are designed to implement the road map (delivered outputs are in para. 22). \n \n12. \nAccountability  and  transparency.  Public  disclosure  of  energy  sector  performance, \nwhich would enable stakeholder monitoring and action, was not a common practice in Pakistan. \nSubprogram 1 resulted in the implementation of web-based open access to NTDC operational \ninformation. DISCOs published monthly billing and collection data, but the degree of information \ndisclosure  varied.  Public  disclosure  and  monitoring  will  be  strengthened  by  a  separate  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  technical  assistance  (TA)  loan. 15  Subprogram  1  resulted  in  the \nestablishment  of  monitoring  units  within  MOWP  and  the  MPNR,  and  publishing  of  quarterly \nreports.  Subprogram  2  was  designed  to  expand  the  disclosure  of  sector  performance  and \npayments by NEPRA and CPPA (delivered outputs are in para. 25). \n \n13. \nDevelopment  coordination.  The  proposed  subprogram  2  has  been  prepared  in \ncoordination  with  the  IMF,  World  Bank,  JICA,  and  other  development  partners  in  order  to \nincrease the overall economic impact. Pakistan\u2019s macroeconomic indicators are improving and \nall  IMF  quantitative  performance  criteria  were  met  by  the  end  of  2014.  Inflation  eased  in  July \n2015  to  a  1.3%  annual  rate.  Financial  sector  indicators  remain  sound  and  foreign  exchange \nreserves  reached  $13.5  billion  by  the  end  of  June  2015.  The  Fiscal  Responsibility  and  Debt \nLimitation Act 2005 required the government to reduce the ratio of public debt to gross domestic \nproduct to 60% by June 2013 and maintain it below 60% from then on. The ratio was 63% for \n\n                                                \n14 Government  of  Pakistan,  Ministry  of  Petroleum  and  Natural  Resources.  2012.

The  2013  National  Power  Policy17 and  the  programmatic  approach  follow  the \n14. \nrecommendations of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan Energy Sector Task Force, which ADB \nco-chaired  with  the  government. 18  Through  the  Energy  Sector  Restructuring  Program,  ADB \ninitiated  key  sector  reforms  in  2000.  Power  sector  reforms  were  also  part  of  the  Accelerating \nEconomic  Transformation  Program  in  2008  and  2009.19 The  lessons  from  the  Energy  Sector \nRestructuring Program are to (i) focus on the program conditions where ADB has strong sector \ninvolvement, (ii) provide extensive long-term support for difficult reforms through TA and policy \ndialogue, (iii) privatize rather than just unbundle state-owned enterprises, (iv) reduce subsidies, \n(v) remain engaged, and (vi) reduce electricity theft.20 These lessons have been reflected in the \ndesign of the overall program and subprogram 2. \n \n15. \nLink  to  country  partnership  strategy.  The  program  is  aligned  with  the  priorities  of \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS),  2015\u20132019  for  Pakistan\u2014policy  reforms  and \nstructural  transformation  in  the  energy  sector. 21  The  program  is  included  in  the  country \noperations  business  plan,  2015\u20132017 for  Pakistan.22 ADB\u2019s  CPS focuses on  contributions that \nwill  strengthen  the  energy  sector,  consistent  with ADB  priorities such as  inclusive growth. The \nunderperforming  energy  sector  is  a  barrier  to  economic  growth,  adequate  job  creation,  and \nmacroeconomic  sustainability.  The  program  will  play  a  key  role  in  the  new  CPS,  supporting \nstructural  transformation  of  the  energy  sector.  Reform  policy  actions  will  also  contribute  to \nknowledge-related issues, which align with the midterm review of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.23 \n \nB. \n \n16. \neconomic growth.

All ten \npolicy  conditions  for  subprogram  2,  which  reflect  some  amendments  to  the  policy  conditions \noriginally  contemplated  for  subprogram  2,  were  agreed  with  the  government  and  met  by  9 \nOctober 2015.24 Outputs delivered under subprogram 2 are as follows: \n\nThe  impact  of  the  overall  program  will  be  a  sustainable  energy  sector  that  supports \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n16 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance. 2015.

Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020:  Meeting  the  Challenges  of  a  Transforming  Asia  and  the  Pacific. \n\nManila. \n\n24 For comparison of indicative triggers (planned at the time of subprogram 1) and the prior actions of subprogram 2, \n\nsee Appendix 4-A: Comparison of Indicative Triggers and Prior Actions.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\nOutput  1:  Managing  tariffs  and  subsidies.  The  objectives  of  this  output  are  to  have \n18. \n(i) clear  policies  on  tariffs  and  subsidies  targeted  at  low-income  customers,  (ii)  policy \nimplementation  through  NEPRA  rules  and  guidelines,  (iii)  reduction  of  discretionary  policy \ndecisions and lags in tariff approval and implementation, and (iv) limits to power sector arrears.  \nIn subprogram 2, NEPRA finalized and published the Guidelines for Determination of Consumer \nEnd Tariff (Methodology and Process), including the timetable, multi-year tariff, and tariff petition \nforms  and  data  requirements.  The  tariff  petitions  of  all  nine  DISCOs  for  FY2015  included  the \ncorresponding forms and data requirements for the guidelines. Eight DISCOs have submitted 5-\nyear  investment  plans  to  NEPRA  for  the  multi-year  tariff  determination  in  the  next  fiscal  year. \nMulti-year tariffs, which would eliminate the uncertainty and time lag for annual petitions, will be \nadopted  for  two  DISCOs  in  the  subsequent  subprogram.  Multi-year  tariffs  will  facilitate \nprivatization by providing certainty to investors and allowing for midterm planning. \n \nIn subprogram 2, the government analyzed the causes of the circular debt (footnote 12) \n19. \nand defined the cap of current and overdue payables as PRs314 billion.25 However, additional \npolicy-induced  public  sector  borrowing  through  the  Power  Holding  Company  Limited  (PHCL) \nwas needed  to maintain  power  supplies in the  system,  and the stock  of PHCL  debt  increased \nfrom PRs239 billion in June 2014 to PRs335 billion by January 2015 and remained unchanged \nsince  then.26 Servicing  of  this  debt  also  contributes  to  the  accumulation  of  circular  debt.  The \ngovernment  developed  an  action  plan,  agreed  with  IMF,  to  reduce  the  flow  of  circular  debt  to \nPRs39 billion by 2018 and consequently the stock of circular debt to PRs212 billion and PHCL \ndebt to PRs220 billion (footnote 12).  \n \n20. \nThe  decline  in  oil  prices  since  2014  led  to  negative  fuel  price  adjustments  in  monthly \nelectricity  tariffs.  The  government  used  this  opportunity  to  introduce  a  surcharge  in  October \n2014 to bring the customer tariff  closer to cost recovery. A surcharge for servicing PHCL debt \nwas also collected. All surcharges were challenged in court and suspended by the Lahore High \nCourt.  However,  the  Supreme  Court  has  stayed  the  Lahore  High  Court\u2019s  decision,  and \nsurcharges have been reinstated since June 2015.  A final Supreme Court decision is pending, \nbut  if  the  court  rules  against  the  surcharges,  the  government  will  seek  legislative  changes  to \nsecure revenue sources for the sector.27  \n \nOutput  2:  Improving  sector  performance  and  market  access  for  private  sector \n21. \nparticipation.  Market-oriented  reforms  will  increase  the  efficiency  of  public  sector  power \ncompanies  and  encourage  private  sector  participation.  The  objectives  are  (i) to  reduce  losses \nand  improve  tariff  collection  by  DISCOs,  (ii)  improve  demand-side  efficiency  and  strengthen \nenergy  conservation,  (iii)  manage  generation  costs  through  least-cost  plans  and  ensure  their \nimplementation, (iv) increase the gas supply and open the market to direct contracting between \nproducers  and  large  consumers,  (v)  commercialize  public  sector  power  companies,28 and  (vi) \ninstitutionalize CPPA\u2019s commercial operations.  \n \n22. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  minimum  energy  performance  standards  for  compact \nfluorescent lamps, fans and motors, and appliance labeling standards have been prepared and \napproved  by  Pakistan  Standards  and Quality  Control  Authority.  In  March  2015,  MOWP  issued \n\n                                                \n25 According to the Government of Pakistan, payables beyond 45-day payment periods are considered overdue.  \n26 The government created  PHCL in 2009 to take on the debt held by DISCOs, GENCOs, NTDC, and other power \nsector entities to clear circular debt. A total of PRs226 billion was transferred from these power sector entities to \nPHCL in 2009. \n\n27 Because of uncertainty regarding the time required for the legal process, a policy action of equalization surcharges \n\nis planned to be recognized in subprogram 3. \n\n28  Commercializing the DISCOs will help achieve the government's privatization targets. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nan internal instruction to officially adopt the guidelines. A model supplementary agreement that \ngives  better  prices  to  existing  gas  concessions  and  encourages  further  exploration  and \nproduction was approved in February 2015 under subprogram 2, and the conversion of existing \ngas concession agreements was initiated. A total of 66 supplementary agreements were signed \nwith  public  and  private  gas  companies  by  September  2015  to  cover  92  applicants.  In  March \n2015, the government also signed the first contract to import liquefied natural gas and the first \nshipment  was  delivered.  ECC  issued  policy  directives  to  ensure  that  liquefied  natural  gas  is \ndelivered to the customers who pay full cost-recovery prices. The supply will be allocated first to \nfour efficient IPPs that otherwise use expensive high speed diesel.   \n \n23.  MOWP has signed performance contracts with all GENCOs, DISCOs, and NTDC under \nsubprogram 2. The contracts have performance indicators to ensure accountability and promote \noperational efficiency. The government also undertook actions to separate commercial functions \nfrom the grid\u2019s technical operator (NTDC). NTDC\u2019s petition to remove CPPA functions from its \nlicense was approved on 29 May 2015.29 In parallel, on 3 June 2015, NTDC signed a business \ntransfer  agreement  with  CPPA  Guarantee  (CPPAG),  and  the  commercial  operations  of  CPPA \nwere transferred to CPPAG. Power purchase agency agreements signed between CPPAG and \nDISCOs  authorized  CPPAG  to  act  as  a  single  buyer  of  electricity  on  behalf  of  DISCOs. \nSimultaneously,  CPPAG  signed  power  purchase  agreements  with  all  GENCOs  and  amended \nthe existing power purchase agreement with Water and Power Development Authority. CPPAG \ncommenced  the  issuance  of  invoices  and  payment  transactions  and  its  operational  capability \nhas thus been demonstrated.  \n \n24. \nIn  order  to  further  promote  operational  efficiency  and  competition,  the  government \nlaunched  an  ambitious  program  to  privatize  DISCOs  and  GENCOs  starting  in  FY2016. \nTransaction  advisers  have  been  recruited  and  are  working  at  seven  DISCOs,  while  the \nrecruitment process is ongoing for the others.  \n \nOutput 3: Achieving accountability and transparency. Better access to energy sector \n25. \ndata  will  foster  demand  for  information  and  a  culture  of  transparency,  which  will  lead  to  the \nmonitoring  of  sector  developments  by  stakeholders.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  last  two  annual \nreports (FY2013 and FY2014) published by NEPRA analyzed the performance of the DISCOs \nfor the past 4 years. CPPAG also published on its website amounts due and payments made by \neach DISCO to CPPAG, and by CPPAG to each generator, including arrears. \n \n26. \nSubsequent subprograms. Subprogram 3 has 14 indicative policy actions that cover all \nthree reform areas and are to be completed by July 2016. Subprogram 3 is expected to include \nthe  following:  (i)  Output  1:  multiyear  tariff  determination  for  two  DISCOs  and  an  enhancement \nand  implementation  mechanism  to  keep  the  level  of  payment  arrears  capped;  (ii)  Output  2: \nfocus  on  future  sector  performance  improvement  through  approvals  of  least-cost  power \ngeneration  plans,  a  restructuring  plan  for  the  mid-  and  down-stream  gas  sector,  electricity \nmarket rules, fiscal incentives for energy conservation for at least one appliance or technology, \nand integration of NEPRA licensees into the supervisory control and data acquisition system;30 \nand  (iii)  Output  3:  information  disclosure  of  key  indicators  from  the  power  sector  company\u2019s \nperformance  contracts,  compliance  with  license  provisions  in  the  power  sector,  and  sanction \nenforcements.  \n \n                                                \n29  IPPs  subsequently  requested  a  review  of  the  license  modification  by  NEPRA,  and  NEPRA  confirmed  on  4 \n\nSeptember 2015 that no revision of the license modification was necessary.  \n\n30 Integration  of  NEPRA  licensees  into  the  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  system  is  a  new  policy  action \n\nunder subprogram 3. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nSubprogram  1  was  approved  and  disbursed  as  a  single-tranche \n\nSubprograms 4 and 5 are designed to continue the reforms begun under subprograms 1, \n27. \n2,  and  3,  with  indicative  policy  actions  to  be  completed  in  2017  and  2018.  Indicative  policy \nactions for  subprograms  4  and  5  include  the following:  (i)  Output  1:  determination  of multiyear \ntariffs;  (ii)  Output  2:  implementation  of  least-cost  power  generation  plans  and  gas  sector \nrestructuring plans, and energy conservation through mandatory minimum standards and fiscal \nincentives; and (iii) Output 3: disclosure of license provision compliance by IPPs.    \n \nD. \n \n28. \nloan  of \nSDR257,443,000  ($400  million  equivalent)  in  April  2014.  Cofinancing  for  subprogram  1  was \nprovided by the World Bank ($600 million) and JICA ($49 million equivalent). These loans were \nused to fund the government\u2019s budgetary needs for FY2014. The policy matrix (Appendix 4) lists \nactions  taken  prior  to  Board  consideration  for  subprograms  1  and  2,  and  proposed  policy \nactions  for  subsequent  subprograms.  The  government  has  requested  (i)  a  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR213,543,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, and (ii) a loan \nof  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  2.31 Both \nloans  are  single  tranche  loans.  The  Asian  Development  Fund  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum during the grace period \nand thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nThe ordinary capital resources loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, \na  modified  straight-line  repayment  method,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof  0.15%  per  year,  and such  other  terms  and conditions  set forth  in the draft  loan agreement. \nBased on this, the average loan maturity is 9.95 years with no maturity premium payable to ADB. \nThe World Bank will provide cofinancing for subprogram 2 in the form of a loan in the amount of \n$500  million. 32  The  programmatic  approach  will  support  reforms  outlined  in  the  letter  of \ndevelopment policy (Appendix 3) and the policy matrix (Appendix 4).  \n \n29. \nThe  amount  of  the  loan  for  subprogram  2  is  determined  based  on  the  government\u2019s \nrequest  and  development  financing  needs.  The  government  estimates  that  fiscal  deficit  in \nFY2016  is  about  $12.7 billion,  of  which $3.3  billion  is  planned to be financed through external \nloans.33 The  government  has  further  $3.9  billion  of  external  financing  needs  for  repayment  of \nloans.  In  the  energy  sector,  electricity  subsidies  for  FY2015  totaled  PRs221  billion,  and  are \nforecast to decrease to PRs118 billion in FY2016.34 The sum of subprogram 2 and cofinancing \nby the World Bank is $900 million equivalent. This equals about PRs94.1 billion, or about 80% \nof the total electricity subsidy needs for FY2016.35  \n                                                \n31 The amount of loan has been increased from the originally programmed $150 million to $400 million based  on the \ngovernment's request and additional achievements in policy actions. Policy actions cannot be valued in monetary \nterms,  but  the  additional  achievements  as  justification  of  the  increase  in  the  loan  amount  is  described  in \nAppendix 4-A: Comparison of Indicative Triggers and Prior Actions. \n\n32 The development policy letter is consistent for all cofinancing institutions. The policy matrix may differ because of \nthe  different  duration  of  support  and  timing  of  prior  actions  for  each  of  the  subprograms.  The  policy  matrix  was \ndeveloped  through  joint  missions  by  cofinancing  institutions  to  ensure  consistency  in  policy  advice  and  to  avoid \npartial implementation of reforms by dividing the prior conditions between the institutions.  \n\n33 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance. 2015. Federal Budget 2015\u20132016: Budget in Brief. Islamabad. \n34 Details on development financing needs are in Fiscal Analysis (accessible from the list of the linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n35 Subprograms  3,  with  a  loan  of  $150  million  equivalent,  and  subprograms  4  and  5,  with  loans  of  $250  million \nequivalent each, are all subject to further discussions between ADB and the government, and to the availability of \nresources. Subprograms 3, 4, and 5 will be submitted for ADB Board consideration upon completion of the policy \ntriggers.  Financing  from  ordinary  capital  resources and  from  cofinanciers  on  a  parallel  cofinancing  basis  may  be \nconsidered. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \n30. \nThe ECC will oversee and is the final government authority on the reforms. The Ministry \nof Finance will be the program\u2019s executing agency, supported by the program coordination unit \n(PCU).  The  PCU  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  coordinating  program  monitoring  and \nreporting.  The  MPNR  and  the  MOWP  will  be  the  implementing  agencies,  supported  by  their \nmonitoring units. Each monitoring unit will be responsible for program reporting and discussing \nimplementation  issues  with  the  PCU.  The  monitoring  units  will  submit  quarterly  reports  to  the \nECC.  The  report  will  be  provided  to  ADB  and  cofinanciers. 36 The  Technical  Assistance  to \nsupport the program will be provided by ADB, JICA, the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, the World Bank, and other development partners through their ongoing and new \ninitiatives. ADB approved a Technical Assistance loan for state-owned enterprise reforms, which \nprovides  analytical,  technical,  legal,  regulatory,  and  communications  support  for  the  PCU  and \nthe monitoring units for the program's duration (footnote 15). The proceeds of the policy-based \nloan will be disbursed to Pakistan in accordance with ADB guidelines.37 The loan proceeds will \nbe used to finance the cost (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced and procured in \nADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n31. \nThe proposed policy reforms under the program will contribute to the national  economy \nby  (i)  reducing  the  subsidies  for  the  power  sector;  (ii)  increasing  investment,  production,  and \nemployment as a result of more reliable electricity; and (iii) lowering production and distribution \ncosts. As of the end of June 2015, current and overdue payments equaled PRs314 billion. This \nrepresents  an  increase  of  about  51%  from  FY2013.  The  collection  and  losses  have  improved \nand  the  government  has  provided  timely  equity  injection  and  tariff  differential  subsidies  to \nDISCOs during the program period.38 However, the gap between NEPRA-determined tariffs and \nactual cost-recovery levels continues to hamper the ability of DISCOs to make power purchase \npayments,  contributing  to  a  large  portion  of  the  new  accumulation  of  circular  debt.  The \ngovernment\u2019s  plan  to  reallocate  PRs335  billion  of  electricity  sector  debt  held  by  PHCL  to \nDISCOs  will  create  further  liquidity  challenges  for  the  DISCOs.  Therefore,  securing  funds  to \nprovide  electricity  subsidies  and  remedies  to  decrease  the  PHCL  debt  burden  is  critical  to \nsustaining electricity sector operations in the country. \n \n32. \nThe government is also implementing measures (e.g., tariff increases and infrastructure \ninvestments)  to  reduce  technical  and  nontechnical  losses  and  thus  limit  the  total  amount  of \nsubsidies. Based on the projected electricity sales and determined tariff levels, the government \nestimates that it needs to provide PRs118 billion in electricity subsidies in FY2016, significantly \nless than PRs292 billion in FY2014 or PRs221 billion in FY2015 (footnote 33).  \n \n33. \nAs part of subprogram 2, the government has also developed an action plan to reduce \nthe  further  accumulation  of  debt  for  each  contributing  factor  and  will  now  keep  total  payables \nbelow PRs314 billion, and reduce the flow and stock of circular debt in the next 3 years.  \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n36 Technical Memorandum (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n38 The government provided PRs342 billion of liquidity injection to DISCOs in June 2013 to clear outstanding subsidy \n\nbalances to DISCOs and some outstanding payables to generators and fuel suppliers.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\nGovernance \n\nB. \n \nIn line with the ADB Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan,39 a governance, \n34. \ninstitutional,  and  corruption  risk  assessment  has been  conducted  as part of  the  preparation of \nthe  CPS  for  Pakistan  in  2015.  In  the  assessment,  Pakistan\u2019s  score  for  various  governance \nindicators fell below the regional average in 2012. However, the country has made progress in \nimproving  accountability,  increasing  transparency,  and  raising  efficiency.  The  government  has \nembarked  on  several  reforms  to  strengthen  the  institutional  framework,  including  budget \nmanagement, financial  accounting,  and reporting  and expenditure  controls.  As  part  of the IMF \nextended fund facility, the government has changed its tax policy to increase transparency. The \nrecent focus  has  been  on capacity  building  and training  at  the federal  and provincial  levels.  A \nfiduciary risk assessment found that overall fiduciary risk at the federal level remains medium to \nhigh  despite  progress  observed  in  individual  areas  with  regard  to  public  expenditure  and \nfinancial  accountability  assessment.  Internal  control  and  audit  remain  weak,  as  does  the \nlegislative  oversight  of  budget  formulation  and  execution.  Although  the  institutional  setup  for \npublic  procurement  has  been  established,  insufficient  effort  has  been  made  to  augment  the \ncapacity  and  budgets  of  the  procurement  authorities.  To  support  government  public  financial \nmanagement  reforms,  ongoing  initiatives financed  by  various  development  partners  should  be \ncoordinated and complementary.  \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n35. \nwith  the  government.  The  government  is  acting  against  corruption,  which  includes  ongoing \nmonitoring and reporting work by the public accounts committee of the Parliament.  \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n36. \nThe  reforms  supported  under  the  program  will  accelerate  economic  growth  and  help \ncreate jobs, which are key to reducing poverty. Reliable power will benefit poor and vulnerable \nconsumers, including hospitals and schools, who are hard hit by inadequate power supply, load \nshedding,  and  poor  power  quality.  Small  industries  will  be  able  to  operate for  more  hours  per \nday and thereby increase productivity, which in turn will create more work opportunities for the \npoor.  Increases  in  the  Human  Development  Index  are  strongly  correlated  with  access  to \ncommercial electricity supplies. The indirect benefits of a reliable energy supply include reduced \nwork  time  and  better  health  of  household  members  through  reduction  of  fume-related  indoor \npollution, and water and food-borne diseases through refrigeration and boiling of water and food. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n37. \nThe  subprogram  has  been  assessed  as  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous  peoples.  In  the  case  of  environmental  safeguards,  the  subprogram  was  initially \nclassified  as  category  B,  because  indirect  environmental  impacts  were  expected.  However,  it \nhas  become clear  that the  policy  actions  under this  subprogram  will  not  result  in any  direct  or \nindirect impacts, and it has therefore been reclassified as category C for the environment. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n38.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 1 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.40 The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n                                                \n39 ADB. 2006.

Further to consultation referred to in prior action \n2 of subprogram 1, NEPRA [notifies] guidelines for \nDISCO tariff determination covering principles, \nmethodologies, timetable, formula and procedures \nfor both annual and multi-year tariff (MYT), and \nincluding (a) procedure for DISCO to submit \ninvestment costs prior to filing of petition; and (b) \nadjustment mechanisms during the year including a \nformula-based forward-looking automatic fuel price \nadjustment (FPA).  \n\n2. Further to the Tariff and Policy Guidelines 2014, \nthe government (i) publishes on the CPPA website \nmonthly overdue payables to the power generators \ndisaggregated to DISCO level; and (ii) MOWP (a) \npublishes a cap for overdue payments not to \nexceed [PRs220 billion], and (b) maintains overdue \npayments below the cap for at least [3] months. \n \n\n1. Nine DISCOs submitted tariff petitions to NEPRA \nfor FY2015, including forms and data requirements \nstipulated in the NEPRA Guidelines for \nDetermination of Consumer End Tariff, in order for \nNEPRA to start tariff determination; and 8 DISCOs \nsubmitted 5-year investment plans in order for \nNEPRA to start the determination of MYTs in \nFY2016. \n \n\n2. MOWP has published on its website a cap for \ntotal due and overdue payables to generators not to \nexceed PRs314 billion and a plan to reduce the flow \nof new overdue payables to PRs39 billion by  \nFY2018 \n \n\nreceivables  and \n\n3.  Each  DISCO  identifies  and  assesses  existing \nrespective \nconsumer \nrecoverability  to  reflect,  in  accordance  with  the \nCompanies Ordinance and the General Accounting \nPractices,  re-classification  and  provisioning  of  the \nqualified \nfinancial \nin \nstatements for FY2014. \n\nits  audited \n\nreceivables \n\ntheir \n\nDeleted. \n\n3. MOWP issues regulation(s) on (i) minimum \nenergy performance standards (MEPS) for at least \n3 energy-intensive consuming appliances or \ntechnologies, and (ii) appliance labeling.  \n \n\n3. MOWP issued guidelines on MEPS and \nappliance labeling for at least 3 energy \nconsumption-intensive appliances or technologies  \n \n\nMOWP  has  issued  an  official  memo  to  adopt  the \nguidelines,  which  were  sufficient,  because  the \nguidelines are voluntary as of Subprogram 2. \n\nThe contents of the action have not been changed \nsubstantially.  The  action  was  revised  to  reflect  the \nnumber of DISCOs that have complied with the new \nguidelines for new petitions.  \n\nThe achievement from this action exceeded the \nexpectations  in  the  original  indicative  trigger. \nDuring  subprogram  2  monitoring,  agreement  has \nbeen reached with the government that the cap will \nnot  exceed  PRs314  billion,  including  both  current \nand  overdue  payables.  The  government  has  made \nfurther commitments and  developed an action plan \nto  reduce  future  payables.  The  wording  of  the \naction is revised to recognize this progress. \n \nThe action on publishing monthly overdue payables \nis covered by Prior Action 9. \n\nThis  action  was  fulfilled.  However,  the  government \nfor \nannounced  an  ambitious  privatization  plan \nDISCOs (see Prior Action 8), which requires further \nimprovements  to DISCOs than planned at the time \nof Subprogram 1. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4A                                                                              \n\n4. MPNR notifies rules for enhancing gas \nproduction from producing, dormant or under-\nproducing concessions. \n\n4. MPNR has signed supplemental agreements \nagreeing to revised prices for 92 exploration \nconcessions production leases at levels set out in \nthe 2012 Petroleum Policy, including 26 from the \nprivate sector. \n\nWhile  the  original  action  was  going  to  impact  the \noperations of a limited number of gas concessions, \nthe new prior action addresses gas exploration and \nproduction  companies  and  is  expected  to  more \nrapidly increase domestic gas production.  \n\nNo equivalent action \n\n5. The Economic Coordination Committee has \napproved policy directives stating that LNG will be \nprovided to consumers who pay its full cost through \nthe tariff. \n\nThis  action  is  an  additional  achievement  to  the \noriginal policy matrix during Subprogram 2. The \naction is based on the government\u2019s plans to import \nsignificant  quantities  of  LNG.  The  action  supports \nadoption  of  a  full  cost-recovery  policy  for  imported \nLNG,  which  will  improve  investor  confidence  and \navoid \nto  non-cost \nrecovery customer segments. \n\nthe  risk  of  supplying  LNG \n\nNo substantial changes (only minor rewording).  \n\nThis  action  is  an  additional  achievement  to  the \noriginal policy matrix during Subprogram 2. The \ngovernment  plans  to  privatize  all  DISCOs  and \nGENCOs  by  2017.  While  the  completion  of  the \nis \nface  challenges, \nprogram  may \nrecognized  as \nthe \nappointment  of  financial  advisors  for  the first  batch \nof privatization. \n\nthe  program  accelerated \n\nthis  action \n\nrevision \n\nincreased \nhighlights \nThe \nirreversibility of the improvements in billing and \nsettlement  structure  resulting  from  the  action. \nThe two actions are also combined to focus on the \noutcome of the original two triggers.  \n\nthe \n\n5.  MOWP  signs  performance  contracts,  including \noperational  and  financial  performance  indicators \nand  a  monitoring  framework,  with  all  GENCOs, \nNTDC and all remaining DISCOs. \n\n6. MOWP signed performance contracts, including \noperational and financial performance indicators \nand a monitoring framework, with all remaining \nDISCOs, GENCOs, and NTDC. \n\nNo equivalent action. \n\n7.  Roadmap  for  privatization  was  developed  and  \nimplementation was started \n\n6. (i) NTDC files request and NEPRA amends \nNTDC license to remove CPPA functions, and \nNTDC\u2019s authority to purchase or sell electricity; and \n(ii) CPPA signs an energy supply agreement with \neach DISCO to procure power on their behalf. \n\n7.  (i) CPPA signs PPAs with WAPDA on behalf of \nDISCOs, and PPAs with all GENCOs (one PPA for \neach GENCO operational thermal plant); and (ii) \nWAPDA enters into an agreement with CPPA for \nadministration of IPP PPAs under the 1994 policy. \n\n8. (i) CPPAG has demonstrated the operational \ncapability to handle all steps in the billing and \nsettlement cycle of electricity sales by generators, \nand purchases by DISCOs; and (ii) NEPRA has \ngranted an amendment to the NTDC license to \neliminate CPPA functions. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4A  \n\n35 \n\n8. CPPA implements web-based access to monthly \namount due and payments made by DISCOs to \nCPPA, and by CPPA to generators. \n\n9. CPPAG publicly disclosed on its website the \nmonthly amounts due, and payments made, by \neach DISCO to CPPAG, and by CPPAG to \ngenerators, including arrears.  \n\nNo  substantial  change  is  made.  The  action  was \nreworded  to  clarify  the  details  of  the  information \ndisclosure. \n\n9. NEPRA publishes (at least monthly) on its \nwebsite the information provided by all licensees on \nselected performance standards results and \nindicators.  \n \n\n10.  NEPRA  has  disclosed  the  annual  DISCO \nperformance  and  evaluation  reports,  and  initiated \noutreach  action \nthe \nto  consumers \ncontent; DISCOs have disclosed on their respective \nwebsites \nreports, \ntheir  annual  performance \nincluding their plans to improve service delivery. \n\nregarding \n\nThe  action  was  reworded  to  clarify  the  specific \nmethod of information disclosure and to add actions \nby DISCOs.  \n\nCPPA =  Central Power Purchasing Agency,  CPPAG = CPPA Guarantee, DISCOs = distribution companies, GENCOs =  power generation companies, IPP = \nindependent  power  producer,  LNG  =  liquefied  natural  gas,  MEPS  =  minimum  energy  performance  standards,  MPNR  =  Ministry  of  Petroleum  and  Natural \nResources,  MOWP  =  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power  ,  MYT  =  multi-year  tariff,  NEPRA  =  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority,  NTDC  =  National \nTransmission and Despatch Company, PPA = power purchasing agency, WAPDA = Water and Power Development Authority. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 October 2015) \n \n", "Currency unit \n \nPRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n \n= \n= \n", "Pakistan rupee/s (PRe/PRs) \n \n$0.0096 \nPRs104.4500 \n", " \n \n", "ADB \nCPPA \nCPPAG \nCPS \nDISCO \nECC \nGENCO \nIMF \nIPP \nJICA \nMOWP \nMPNR \nNEPRA \nNTDC \nPCU \nPHCL \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nCentral Power Purchasing Agency \nCPPA Guarantee  \ncountry partnership strategy \ndistribution company \nEconomic Coordination Committee \ngeneration company \nInternational Monetary Fund \nindependent power producer \nJapan International Cooperation Agency \nMinistry of Water and Power \nMinistry of Petroleum and Natural Resources \nNational Electric Power Regulatory Authority \nNational Transmission and Despatch Company \nprogram coordination unit \nPower Holding Company Limited \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government of Pakistan ends on 30 June. \u201cFY\u201d before a \ncalendar year denotes the year in which the fiscal year ends, e.g., FY2014 ends on \n30 June 2014. \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", "NOTES \n", " \n", " \n \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n"]}
