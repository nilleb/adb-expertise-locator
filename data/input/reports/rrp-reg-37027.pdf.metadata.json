The  Project  will  help  recover \nmaintenance  cost  for  the  border  access  roads  by  placing  appropriate \ntolls  on  the  upgraded  roads,  promote  public-private  partnership  by \nprivatizing  terminal  operation  of  the  proposed  ICD  at  Kakarbita,  and \nenhance  governance  capacity  by  providing  facilities  of  fast  and \ntransparent customs clearance and reducing opportunities of financial \nirregularities. The Project will lessen the vulnerability of local people to \nhuman immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \n(HIV/AIDS)  and  human  trafficking  across  the  border  by  waging  a \nparticipatory  and  awareness  campaign  and  by  providing  necessary \nphysical  ICD  facilities  in  the  proposed  ICD  with  respect  to  preventing \nhuman trafficking.  \n \nNepal\u2019s  landlocked  and  fragmented  terrain  substantially  hampers \ndomestic  and  foreign  commerce.  Nepal  suffers  from  long  transport \ndistances;  dependence  on  transit  routes  for  imports  and  exports; \nsubstandard \ninfrastructure; \ntrade \ncumbersome  goods  clearance  procedures;  and  prolonged  clearing \ntime at the country\u2019s major gateways. Institutional capacity to manage \nan efficient transit system is weak and should be improved. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)-sponsored  South  Asia \nSubregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC)  program,  comprising \nBangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal developed action programs for \nsubregional  economic  cooperation  in  six  priority  sectors:  transport; \nenergy;  tourism;  environment;  trade,  investment,  and  private  sector \ncooperation;  and  information  and  communication  technology.  The \nTransport Working Group (TWG) under the SASEC program identified \nsix  major  subregional  transport  corridors,  two  involving  Nepal,  that \nneed to remove institutional and physical impediments (choke points) \ntransport  connectivity  and  economic \nto  enhance  subregional \n\nfacilities,  and \n\nlogistics, \n\ntransit \n\n\f iv \n\n \n\nObjective  \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \n\ntransport  connectivity  and  economic \n\nto  enhance  subregional \nintegration. \n \nGiven  the  critical  role  of  transit  logistics  and  trade  facilities  in \nintegrating Nepal\u2019s economy into subregional and global markets, the \nGovernment\u2019s priority is to upgrade governance capacity and physical \ninfrastructure  to  improve  reliability  of  goods  delivery,  and  reduce \ntransport costs and goods clearing time, particularly along the corridor \nfrom Kathmandu to Kolkata and Haldia  ports in India, and the corridor \nfrom  Kathmandu  to  Khulna  and  Mongla  and  Chittagong  ports  in \nBangladesh. The Transport Working Group is deliberating on broader \nissues  with  respect  to  trade  and  transit  agreements  and  customs \ncooperation  among  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India  and  Nepal.  The \nproposed  improvements  of  border  transit  logistics  and  trade  facilities \nunder the Project form part of two key subregional corridors involving \nNepal, along which complementary investment initiatives are being or \nwill  be  undertaken  by  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India  and  Nepal  and \nsupported  by  ADB.  The  Project  is  fully  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s \n10th Five-Year Plan to improve the country\u2019s subregional connectivity \nand  economic  integration.  The  Project  is  a  result  of  consultation  with \nsubregional  countries  and  complements  ongoing  and  prospective \nprojects along the key corridors.  \n \nThe project objective is to help the Government integrate the economy \ninto  the  subregion\u2019s.  The  Project  is  an  integral  part  of  the  ADB-\nsupported  SASEC  program  to  promote  subregional  cooperation \nthrough upgraded governance capacity, better transport facilities, and \nmore efficient and effective trade management.  \n \nThe total project cost is estimated at $26.7 million equivalent, including \ninterest  charges  during  construction.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is \n$15.7 million, and the local currency cost is $11.0 million equivalent. \n \n\n($ million) \n\n               15.70 \n\n    4.30              20.00                   75 \n     0.00                6.70                6.70                   25 \n\n_____________________________________________________ \nSource           Foreign             Local              Total             Percent \n                     Exchange        Currency           Cost    \nADB \nGovernment \n \n     Total \n ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n \nThe  loan  will  be  the  equivalent  in  various  currencies  of  Special \nDrawing Rights (SDR) 13,643,000 million ($20 million equivalent) from \nthe Special Funds resources of the ADB. The repayment period of the \nloan  will  be  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an \ninterest charge of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter.  \n \n\n   15.70              11.00              26.70    \n\n    100 \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n\nThe Government will make the loan proceeds available promptly to the \nMinistry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  (MPPW)  and  will  bear  the \nforeign exchange risk on the loan. \n \nUntil 1 July 2010 \n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n \n \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n31 December 2009 \n\n \nA  project  implementation  unit  will  be  set  up  under  the  Project \nDirectorate (ADB Projects) in the Department of Roads (DOR), which \nwill  be  supported  by  technical  staff  from  Department  of  Customs \n(DOC), and Nepal Inter-modal Transport and Development Board.  \n \nMPPW  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  DOR  the  implementing \nagency. \n \nAll  civil  works  contract  packages  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nGuidelines  for  Procurement  under  Asian  Development  Bank    loans \nfollowing  international  competitive  bidding.  International  shopping  will \nbe  used  for  supply  contracts  of  less  than  $500,000,  and  direct \npurchase for small or off-the-shelf items of less than $100,000.  \n \nA consulting firm will be recruited using ADB's quality- and cost-based \nselection  procedure  in  accordance  with.  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants by Asian Development Bank and its Borrowers and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. About 37 person-months of international consultants and \n301  person-months of domestic consultants will be required to assist \nthe  Borrower \ninstitutional  capacity  building  by  preparing \ndocuments  and  recommending  equipment  specifications, and training \nin automation of cargo clearance; (ii) detailed design, bid preparation, \nprocurement, construction supervision, and contract administration for \ntwo access roads and for ICDs, (iii) study and recommendation of toll \nlevels and collection methodology, and (iv) monitoring and verifying of \nresettlement  action  plans,  environment  management  plans,  and  the \nHIV/AIDs  and  human-trafficking  program.  About  2  person-months of \ninternational  individual  consultants  and  2  person-months of domestic \nindividual  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  line  with  ADB's procedures \nfor  recruiting  individual  consultants  to help carry out project technical \nauditing. \n \nAs  a  step  forward  towards  integrating  subregional  transport network, \nthe Project, and similar initiatives, will provide further momentum to the \nongoing  subregional  transport  cooperation,  particularly  deliberations \non institutional and legal issues involving six key corridors by making it \na more urgent agenda item for SASEC TWG.  \n \nThe  project  benefits  are  not  confined  to  Nepal.  By  reducing  cargo \nclearing  time,  goods  pilferage  and  damage,  and  transport  vehicle \noperating  cost  of  exporters  and  importers  of  Bangladesh,  Bhutan, \nIndia,  and  others  trading  with  Nepal  will  benefit  from  the  improved \n\nin  (i) \n\n\f vi \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\nis  considered \n\nto  all  SASEC \n\nintegration  and \n\ntrade  communities.  The  benefits \n\ninclude \ntrade  competitiveness,  and \n\nIndia,  and  others  trading  with  Nepal  will  benefit  from  the  improved \nborder  facilities  and  accessibility.  The  Project  will  provide  economic \nbenefits \nfrom \nstrengthened  economic  integration,  particularly  reduced  transaction \ncosts,  will  promote  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty  in  the \nsubregion.    Relevant  studies  suggested  that  improved  efficiency  and \nreduced transport costs of the six corridors might add an estimated 1% \nto regional Gross Domestic Product (GDP). \n \nThe economic internal rates of return  are  (i)  32.7%  for  the  Bhairawa \naccess road, (ii) 18.1% for the Birganj access road, (iii) 15.2% for the \nKakarbita  ICD  development,  and  (iv)  47.6%  for  the  ASYCUDA \nfinancially  viable  and \ninstallation.  The  Project \nsustainable.  The  main  quantifiable  project  benefits  consist  of  (i) \nreduced  vehicle  operating  cost;  (ii)  time  savings  from  reduced  travel, \ncargo  handling,  and  customs  clearance;  and  (iii)  reduced  theft  and \nincreased \ndamage  of  goods.  Nonquantifiable  benefits \neconomic \nimproved \ngovernance  and  institutional  capacity.  The  Project  will  improve  the \nenvironment  of  congested  areas  and  help  prevent  HIV/AIDS  and \nhuman trafficking.  \n \nThe Project will benefit truck owners, drivers, importers and exporters, \ncustoms  brokers,  passengers, \nlocal  communities,  and  people \nimproved \nthe \nemployed \ncompetitiveness  and  market  share  will  bring  them  tangible  monetary \nbenefits.  The  institutional  capacities  of  DOC  and  DOR  will  be \nstrengthened. The Project will benefit the poor as economic growth will \nallow increased Government expenditure on poverty reduction-related \nactivities as indicated in the 10th Five-Year Plan.  \n \nThe major project risk arises from present  security situation in Nepal. \nTherefore,  the  Project  provides  a  conservative  implementation  period \nand  adequate  contingencies.  The  strong  political  will  of  SASEC \ncountries  will  help  smoothen  implementation  of  SASEC  transport \ncooperation  programs,  and  help  achieve  project  benefits  through \nimproved  trade  and  transit  agreements  and  enhanced  customs \ncooperation.  \n\ntrade  and  related  sectors,  where \n\nin \n\n\fo\n76 00'E\n\nAmritsar\n\nChandigarh\n\nAmbala\n\nSUBREGIONAL TRANSPORT FACILITATION PROJECT\n\no\n92 00'E\n\nN\n\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\nPatan\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\nBambasa\n\nMahendranagar\n\nDailekh\n\nKilometers\n\nPilibith\n\nNEPAL\n\nPokhara\n\nNepalganj Bijauri\n\nKATHMANDU\n\nNanpara\n\nBahraich\n\nBhairawa\n\nSitapur\n\nLucknow\n\nBansi\n\nButwal\n\nSundauli\n\nBirganj\n\nGopalganj\n\nHetauda\nPatlaiya\n\nRaxaul Malangwa\n\nMathura\n\nAgra\n\nGwaitdor\n\nForbesganj\n\nMuzaffarfur\n\nVaranasi\n\nPatna\n\nBHUTAN\n\nTHIMPHU\n\nWangdue-phodrang\n\nSimtokha\nChukha\nPhuentsholing\n\nDewangiri\n\nGangtok\n\nKakarbhitta\n\nBitanagar\n\nSevok\nShiligurin\nFulbari\nBanglandha\n\nNilphaman\nParbatipur\n\nDebikut\n\nMadhyapara\n\nRaiganj\n\nIngraj Bazar\n\nSadiya\n\nItanagar\n\nDibrugarh\n\nJorhat\n\no\n26 00'N\n\nDispur\n\nShillong\n\nKohima\n\nImphal\n\nSichar\n\nBarhi\n\nMoregram\n\nRajshahi\n\nRaniganj\n\nII I\nII I\n\nI\nI\n\nBaharampur\n\nSherpur\n\nNetrokona\n\nSylhet\n\nBogra\n\nMymensingh\nNandail\nBhaluka\nBANGLADESH\nJoydebpur\nDHAKA\n\nKushtia\nDaulatia\n\nKishoreganj\n\nNarayanganj\n\nAgartala\n\nAizawal\n\nI I\nI I\n\nJabalpur\nI I\nI I\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI I I I I I\nI I I I I I\n\nRanchi\n\nI N D I A\n\nLakhnadon\n\nNagpur\n\nII\nII\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nII\nII\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nRamagundam\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nRaipur\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI I\nI I\n\nI I\nI I\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nNatavalesa\n\nI\nI\n\nBhubaneswar\n\nParadip\n\nI\nI\nPanagarh\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nMirpur\n\nJhenaida\n\nJessore\n\nKhulna\n\nTown Noapara\n\nKolkata\n\nMongla\n\nBarisal\n\nPatuakhali\n\nHaldia\n\nFeni\n\nChittagong\n\nCox's Bazar\n\nNational Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nDivisional Headquarters\n\nProject Area\n\nFeasibility Study (ongoing)\n\nInland Clearance Depot (ICD)\n\nNational Road\n\nRailway\n\nADB-Financed Highway\n\nMYANMAR\n\nADB-Financed Jamuna Bridge Rail Link Project\n\nUnder Improvement\n\nAccess Road to be Constructed or Widened\n\nADB-Assisted Feasibility Study\n\nGovernment of India-Assisted\n\nFeasibility Study\n\nInternational Boundary\n\no\n18 00'N\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\no\n92 00'E\n\nM\na\np\n1\n\nv\n\ni\ni\n\nBikaner\n\nDELHI\n\no\n26 00'N\n\nJaipur\n\nGandhinagar\n\nAhmedabad\n\nBiaora\n\nBhopal\n\nUdaipur\n\nDhule\n\nNasik\n\nMumbai\n\no\n18 00'N\n\n0\n4\n-\na\ns\na\n\ni\n\n3\n7\n3\n6\nR\nM\n\nSholapur\n\nHyderabad\n\no\n76 00'E\n\n\fN E P A L\nSUBREGIONAL TRANSPORT FACILITATION PROJECT\n\n87 00'Eo\n\nv\n\ni\ni\ni\n\nM\na\np\n\n2\n\n81 00'Eo\n\nI\nL\nA\nK\nA\nH\nA\n29 00'No\nM\n\nMahendranagar\n\n27 00'No\n\n81 00'Eo\n\nS E T I\n\nK A R N A L I\n\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC\nOF CHINA\n\n29 00'No\n\nB H E R I\n\nG I R I\n\nA\n\nL\n\nA\n\nW\n\nA\n\nH\n\nD\n\nR A P T I\n\nNepalganj\n\nG A N D A K I\n\nN E P A L\n\nB A G M A T I\nKATHMANDU\n\nTansen\nL U M B I N I\n\nParasi\n\nBhairawa\n\nHetauda\nNARAYANI\n\nBirganj\n\nJANAKPUR\n\nI N D I A\n\nA\nH\nT\nA\nM\nR\nA\nG\nA\nS\n\nKOSHI\n\nMECHI\n\n27 00'No\n\nIlam\nKakarbhitta\n\nBiratnagar\n\no87 00'E\n\n239\n\nPokhara\n\n90\n\nMugling\n\n113\n\nBhumahi\n\nKathmandu\n\n110\n\n36\n\n223\n\n77\n\nHetauda\n\nAtaria\n\n47\n\n155\n\nKohalpur\n\nButwal\n\n236\n\nGaddachauki\n\nNational Capital\n\nProject Area\n\nExisting Inland Clearance Depot\n\nProject Inland Clearance Depot\n\nProject Road\n\nNational RoadRoad\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n0\n4\n-\nc\nh\na\nr\nt\ns\n\n2\n4\n7\n2\nR\nM\n\n19\n\nParasi\n\n15\n\nNepalganj\n\n22\nICD\n\nBhairawa\n\n(29 km)\n\n29\n\n26\n\n(12.4 km)\n\nICD\n\nItahari\n\n303\n\n93\n\nParawanipor\n\n24\n\nBirganj/\nRaxaul\n\nPadam Road\n\nKakarbita\n\nBiratnagar\nICD\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the Kingdom of Nepal for the Subregional Transport Facilitation Project.1  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nSubregional  economic  cooperation  emerged  as  a  stepping-stone  to  broader  regional \ncooperation  in  the  late  1990s.  The  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC)2 \nprogram  identified  six  priority  areas  for  economic  cooperation:  transport;  energy;  environment; \ntourism; information and communications technology; and trade, investment, and private sector \ncooperation.  In  February  2004,  the  SASEC  Transport  Working  Group  (TWG)  established  that \nsystem -wide impediments (choke points) to cross-border cargo movements along key transport \ncorridors in the subregion needed to be removed, such as (i) long and costly supply chains for \ninbound  and  outbound  goods;  (ii)  inadequate  infrastructure  and  cumbersome  customs \nprocedures; (iii) substandard traffic management at the borders, ineffective communications and \ncargo  tracking  systems,  and  costly  empty backhaul  practices;  and  (iv)  lack  of  a  risk-based \ncargo-sampling system. Transit route arrangements should be rationalized.  \n \n  The  Islamabad  Declaration  adopted  at  the  12th  Summit  for  South  Asia  Association  for \n3. \nRegional  Cooperation  (SAARC)  highlighted  the  critical  role  of  transport  and  transit  links  in \npromoting  regional  cooperation  and  economic  integration.  The  scheduled  removal  of  tariff  and \nnontariff trade and investment barriers contained in the South Asia Free Trade Area (SAFTA) 3 \nagreement  signed  at  the  summit  is  expected  to  open  up  vast  opportunities  for  trade  and \ninvestment  growth.  ADB  is  working  with  SAARC  and  SASEC  to  promote  subregional \ncooperation to upgrade the transport network and to improve policies and institutional capacity. \nSASEC countries, on their own initiative and supported by ADB, are rationalizing and simplifying \ntransit and trade agreements through SASEC and SAARC mechanisms.  \n \n4. \nNepal\u2019s  landlocked  and  fragmented  terrain  substantially  hampers  domestic  and  foreign \ncommerce.  Nepal  suffers  from  long  transport  distances;  dependence  on  transit  routes  for \nimports  and  exports;  substandard  transit  logistics  and  trade  facilities4  and  infrastructure; \ncumbersome  goods  clearance  procedures  and  prolonged  clearing  time  at  the  country\u2019s major \ngateways;  and  weak  governance  capacity.  Nepal\u2019s  major  trade  routes  depend  on  access  to \nIndia\u2019s transportation system, where 90% of Nepal\u2019s foreign trade transits through. The nearest \nseaport, Kolkata, India, is 1,056 kilometers (km) away. Nepalese tradeable goods thus face one \nof the highest transportation costs in the region, impeding the country\u2019s ability to make its export \ngoods  competitive  and  to  expand  foreign  trade.  With  the  elimination  of  the  Multi-Fiber \n                                                 \n1  The Project has been prepared through a regional technical assistance ADB. 2003. Subregional Transport \n\nFacilitation Project. Manila (RETA 6139, in the amount of $600,000, approved on 19 November 2003).  The project \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n\n2   The SASEC program covers Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal. \n3   SAFTA is expected to come into force on 1 January 2006. It is to reduce intra-regional trade tariffs by a schedule \nand degree based on the development maturity of a certain member. Member countries will eliminate nontariff and \npara-tariff measures or have them implemented in the least trade-restrictive manner to facilitate intra-SAARC trade. \nQuantitative restrictions will be eliminated subject to certain conditions. Proposals have been made with respect to \ncustoms cooperation, removal of barriers to intra-SAARC investments, etc.  \n\n4  Trade facilitation is often defined as \u201cthe simplification and harmonization of international trade procedures\u201d. This \ndefinition relates to a wide range of activities such as  import and export activities. The losses resulting from that \nbusiness suffer through delays at borders, complicated and unnecessary documentation requirements, and lack of \nautomation  of  Government-mandated  trade  procedures  is  often  estimated  to  exceed  in many cases the costs of \ntariffs. \n\n \n \n\n\f \n2\n\n \n\nAgreement  quotas  by  end  of  2004,  and  the  country\u2019s  obligations  to  comply  with  World  Trade \nOrganization (WTO) accession commitments, Nepal will have to improve its transit logistics and \ntrade  facilities  to  provide  an  enabling  environment  for  integrating  itself  into  the  regional  and \nglobal markets.  \n \n5. \nA number of transit routes have been identified for the movement of third-country traffic \nfor Nepali imports and exports. The main corridors are connections through Birganj to Kolkata \nand  Haldia  in  India  by  road  and  by  rail.  Another  is  the  rail  connection  through  Birganj  and \nRaxaul  to  Nhava  Sheva  in  western  India,  but  this  is  not  yet  in  full  use  pending  an  agreement \nbetween  the  two  countries.  The  Government  of  India  (GOI)  is  deliberating  whether  to  allow \nNepali transit goods, mostly from the Birganj Inland Clearance Depot (ICD) to use JNPT port in \nMumbai.  There  are  supplementary  road  connections  go  through  Biratnagar  and  Bhairawa  to \nKolkata and Haldia. The corridors to Bangladesh are the road connections through Kakarbita to \nBanglabandha in Bangladesh, and down by road to Dhaka or Khulna and further to Mongla and \nChittagong in Bangladesh.  \n \nTwo out of six major subregional transport corridors, which SASEC TWG has identified \n6. \nchoke points, involve Nepal: (i) Kathmandu through the southern border of Nepal at Birganj and \nBhairawa,  to  Raxaul  in  India,  and  down  to  Kolkata  and  Haldia  ports;  and    (ii)  Kathmandu-\nKakarbita-Fulbari,  India;  Banglabandha  (Bangladesh)-Dhaka-Mongla  and  Chittagong  ports  in \nBangladesh.  Given  the  critical  role  that  transit  logistics  and  trade  facilities  play  in  Nepal\u2019s \neconomic  integration  and  development,  the  Government\u2019s  priority  is  to  upgrade  the  country\u2019s \ngovernance  capacity  and  physical  infrastructure  to  improve  reliability  of  goods  delivery  and \nreduce  transport  costs  and  goods  clearing  time,  particularly  along  the  two  key  subregional \ncorridors. The project component sites are integral to the subregional transport network, which, \nonce  improved,  will  generate  benefits  to  Nepal  as  well  as  the  subregion  by  enhancing  the \naccessibility  and  efficiency  of  goods  and  passenger  movements  in  the  subregion.  This  is \nparticularly  so  because  these  routes  serve  third-country  trade  not  only  outside  but  also  within \nthe  subregion.  The  proposed  Kakarbita  ICD  will  provide  access,  through India, to Bangladesh \nand  Bhutan.  A  road  section  inside  Nepal  leading  to  Kakarbita  will  be  improved  under  the \nongoing ADB-assisted Road Network Development Project (RNDP). The ongoing ADB-assisted \nRoad Network Improvement Project II in Bangladesh includes a border access road from Dhaka \nto  Banglabandha,  where  an  ICD  has  recently  started  to  operate.  Between  Panitanki  and \nKakarbita  through  Siliguri  to  Fulbari  and  Banglabandha  in  India,  an  ADB-assisted  feasibility \nstudy is ongoing for strengthening Indian connections with Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. The \nroad  from  Thimphu,  Bhutan,  to  the  border  with  India  at  Phuentsholing  (connecting  to \nBangladesh  and  Nepal  through  India),  where  an  ICD  is  being  planned,  will  be  improved.  ADB \nprovided a TA to improve Bhutan border access roads to India. Sections of road from Raxaul to \nKolkata are being improved under the ADB-assisted West Bengal Corridor Development Project \nin India. Birganj and Bhairawa provide transit routes from Kathmandu, through Tarai in southern \nNepal,  connected  to  national  road  and  rail  network  of  India  to  Kolkata  and  Haldia  ports,  and \npotentially to JNPT port at Mumbai on the west coast of India. This route has been identified as \none  of  the  most  important  for  Nepali  transit  goods.  The  GOI  is  studying  the  feasibility  of \nimproving  the  road  and  rail  connections  and  border  facilities  at  Birganj,  Bhairawa,  Biratnagar, \nand Nepalganj. The GOI is also taking actions to improve the road and rail network on the India \nside of the border connecting to these points in Nepal. Once completed, the Project will improve \nthe  route  (i)  from  Kathmandu  to  Kakarbita  and  to  Khulna  and  Mongla/Chittagong  ports  in \nBangladesh, or Kathmandu to Kakarbita and through West Bengal to Kolkata and Haldia ports; \nand (ii) from Kathmandu to Birganj and Bhairawa to Kolkata, Haldia, and, potentially, JNPT port \nin Mumbai. All major customs outposts in Nepal will be upgraded with a cargo clearance system \nand wide area network (WAN) system to facilitate cargo clearance. These routes and customs \noutposts serve most of the country\u2019s trade within the SASEC subregion and other countries. As \npart  of  SASEC  initiatives  and  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2003-2007) \n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\ntrade, \n\nimprovements \n\nin  manufacturing, \n\n(Five-Year Plan), the Project is a result of intensive consultations with neighboring countries and \ncomplements the ongoing and prospective projects along the key subregional corridors, which \nADB strongly supports. \n \nNepal's  economy  is  characterized  by  a  low  and  fluctuating  growth  rate.  Following \n7. \nnegative GDP growth of 0.6% in FY2002, the economy recovered moderately and grew by 2.6% \nin  FY2003,5  the  lowest  in  the  SASEC  subregion.  Despite  the  breakdown  of  the  cease-fire in \nAugust  2003,  real  GDP  is  likely  to  grow  by  about  3.6%  in  FY2004,  supported  by  agricultural \ntourism,  and  overseas \ngrowth  and  continued \nremittances.  \n \n8. \nNepal's transport infrastructure mainly consists of roads and civil aviation. Roads carry \nabout 90% of all passengers and freight within the country. A key part of Nepal's road system is \nthe  4,856  km  Strategic  Road  Network  (SRN).  The  national  highways  consist  of  the  East-West \nHighway  (EWH)  and  north-south  highways  linking  major  towns  that  serve  much  of  the \npopulation. The EWH goes from Gaddachauki at the west border with India, to Kakarbita at the \neast  border  with  India,  runs  the  length  of  the  country  in  the  terai,  and  is  connected  through \nnorth-south  links  to  Kathmandu.  The  Tribhuvan  highway  is  also  vital,  and  connects  Birganj  at \nthe southern border  with  India,  the  country\u2019s  most  important  trade  border,  where  50%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s trade passes through, to Kathmandu. Still, Nepal continues to lag behind its neighbors \nin road infrastructure, with an estimated road network of low density\u2014about 90 meters (m) per \nsquare km or 660 m per 1,000 people. The several sections on the present access road from \nBirganj  ICD  to  Tribhuvan  highway  through  Padam  road  are  congested  and  encroached  and \ncannot carry the heavy traffic from the Birganj ICD. A shortcut access road is proposed under \nthe Project to improve border accessibility. Cargo traffic between Kathmandu and the Bhairawa \nICD, where about 10% of  the country\u2019s trade passes,  has to go north to Butwal to connect to \nEWH,  29%  longer  than  an  existing  shortcut  gravel  road,  which  will  be  widened  and  upgraded \nunder the Project. \n \n9. \nIn  Nepal,  the  Heavy  Vehicle  Act  limits  truck  axle  loads  to  10.2  tons,  although \nenforcement is not strict.  Trucks with capacity greater than 16 tons or carrying containers are \ngenerally taken no further than Birganj. Instead, the cargo is then transferred and unstuffed at \nBirganj  onto  10\u201312  ton  capacity  Nepalese  registered  vehicles.  About  50%  of  Nepal-bound \ncontainers  are  handled  at  Haldia,  and  50%  at  Kolkata.  Nepal-bound  bulk  cargo  is  almost \nexclusively  handled  at  Haldia,  and  about  90%  of  this  is  moved  on  to  Nepal  by  rail,  usually \nbagged.  Nepalese  vehicles  may  move  without  hindrance  to  Indian  railheads,  but  need \npermission  from  the  Indian  embassy  in  Kathmandu  to  travel  further  and  are  prohibited  from \ncarrying Indian cargo. Indian trucks may enter Nepal for 72 hours but must pay fees for longer \nstays.  For  Nepal-Bangladesh  trade,  Nepali  trucks  need  to  be  convoyed  within  India  by  Indian \nauthorities and stop at Fulbari (India)/Banglabandha (Bangladesh). Bangladesh vehicles cannot \nenter India. Nepal private operators dominate the road freight transport industry, mostly through \ntruckers\u2019 associations. Freight haulage rates vary by road condition. In some cases the rate per \nton-km for freight on unpaved roads is 100% higher than for paved roads.  \n  \nICDs are important for landlocked countries like Nepal wishing to improve their transport \n10. \nservices by introducing multimodal transport and containerization. ICDs have the effect of partly \nrelocating  port  activities  from  the  foreign  coastal  transit  country,  and  placing  them  under  the \ncontrol  of  national  authorities,  and  creating  employment.  ICDs  need  to  be  equipped  with \nappropriate  facilities  to  cut  the  land  transit  times  considerably  by  reducing  handling  time  and \nstreamlining cumbersome  procedures, resulting in decreased door-to-door transport costs and \nlessening dependence on the coastal country\u2019s ports and transport industry. \n\n                                                 \n5   For FY2003, GDP grew by 5.3% in Bangladesh, 6.5% in Bhutan, and 7.2% in India. \n \n\n\f \n4\n\n \n\n \n11. \nNepal has one rail ICD at Birganj (38.00 hectares (ha)), and two road ICDs at Biratnagar \n(2.86 ha) and Bhairawa (3.23 ha). The two-road ICDs have been in full operation since March \n2002, run by a private operator selected through competitive bidding. The Birganj rail ICD has \nbeen  in  operation  since  July  2004.  The  leasing  out  of  the  two  ICDs  (excluding  Birganj)  is \nproviding the Government with NRs26.6 million (about $372,000) a year in revenues from lease \nfees.  Initial  benefits  of  the  two  ICDs  from  the  improved  facilities  and  services  include  reduced \ntime  of  truckers\u2019  entry  to  and  exit  from  the  terminals  by  up  to  an  hour  (which  translates  to \neconomic  savings  of  about  $500,000  per  year  in  reduced  waiting  time  in  the  terminals); \nimproved warehouse management and enhanced goods safety; easy identification and  retrieval \nof stored goods, and reduced pilferage and theft.  \n \nThe  Nepal  Intermodal  Transport  and  Development  Board    (NITDB)  was  established  in \n12. \n2001 in accordance with the Development Board Act. NITDB is chaired by the secretary of the \nMinistry  of  Industry,  Commerce,  and  Supplies  (MOICS),  and  consists  of  members  from  public \nand  private  sector  entities.  NITDB\u2019s  main  objective  is  to  oversee  the  economic  and  efficient \nmanagement of ICDs to facilitate Nepal\u2019s foreign trade. NITDB sources its funds from the lease \nfees, which are used to cover loan servicing of ICD construction and administrative costs.  \n \n13. \nNepal  has  entered  transit  agreements  with  Bangladesh  and  India  on  various logistics \nservices,  which,  among  others,  cover  goods  storage,  consolidation,  assembly,  and  import \nlicense; information requirements of the customs transit declaration; requirements for truck one-\ntime  seal,  and  customs  inspection  procedure;  and  insurance  and  customs  declaration  agents. \nThe  existing  agreements  are  largely  general  and  being  rationalized  and  simplified  by  the \nSASEC TWG.  \n \n14. \nNepal experienced double-digit growth in exports and imports during the 1990s. The rate \nof  export  growth  (11.4%)6  was  slightly  lower  than  the  rate  of  import  growth  (14.2%).  As  of \nFY2003/04,  Nepal\u2019s  exports  increased  by  6.4%  and  imports  by  15.8%,  for  total  trade  value  of \n$2,421  million  and  trade  deficit  of  $1,034  million,  representing  a  23.1%  increase  over  the \nprevious  year.  The  significant  widening  of  the  trade  deficit  in  FY2003/04 represented greater \neconomic activity in the second half of the year, which boosted total import growth. The overall \nexport-import  ratios  for  India  and  third  countries  are  40.9%  and  37.1%.  The  largest  import \ncommodities  are  basic  manufactures,  followed  by  machines  and  transport  equipment,  and \nmineral  fuels.  Asia  is  the  major  source  of  Nepal  imports,  but  much  of  this  is  entrepot  trade \nmoving through Singapore and Hong Kong, China. Besides India, the largest exporters to Nepal \nare the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) (13.2%) and United Arab Emirates (11.3%). \n \n15. \nNepal\u2019s main exports are a small number of products \u2014ready-made garments (23.8% of \ntotal export value) and carpets\u2014with 95% of the total exports going to North America, Europe, \nand  India.  The  breakdown  of  commodities  and  trade  suggests  that  the  logistics  for  overseas \ntrade are more sensitive to time and reliability, while those for Indian and subregional trade are \nmore  sensitive  to  cost  and  damage.  Despite  the  narrow  basis,  trade  has  been  a  key  factor \nbehind the acceleration of Nepal\u2019s economic growth in the 1990s. \n \n16. \nSASEC  trade  accounted  for  53%  of  total  Nepal\u2019s  trade  in  2002/03.  India  is  Nepal\u2019s \nlargest trading partner among SASEC countries and in 2002/03 took 93% of Nepal\u2019s exports to \nand  provided  87%  of  Nepal\u2019s  imports  from  SASEC  countries.  Between  1992/93  and  2000/03, \nNepal exports to Bangladesh grew annually by 21.4% and to Bhutan by 56.2%.  \n \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2004. Asian Development Outlook 2004; ADB Key Indicators, 2004.  Manila; and Nepal Central Statistics \n\nBureau data. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nNepal has one of the most liberalized trade policies in South Asia. The major constraints \n17. \non  trade  development  prospects  include  delays  in  customs  and  transshipment,  an  extremely \nrigid  formal  labor  market,  inadequate  infrastructure,  and  ineffective  and  unpredictable  public \nsector policies.  \n  \n18. \nThe Department of Customs (DOC) is under the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and has 29 \ncustoms stations, most of which are on the southern border with India. DOC collects about 53% \nof  the  total  tax  revenue  in  Nepal,  mainly  comprising  customs  and  excise  duties,  and  value \nadded  tax,  and  largely  collected  at  the  border.  The  four  major  border  posts  for  revenue \ncollection are Birganj, Biratnagar, Bhairawa, and Kakarbita, accounting for 73% of the customs \nrevenue  collected.  The  other  significant  stations  are  in  Tribhuvan  Airport,  and  Kodari  on  the \nnorthern border with the PRC. \n \n19. \nThe  five  major  border  crossings  into  India  are  Nepalganj,  Bhairawa,  Birganj,  and \nBiratnagar  on  the  southern  border,  and  Kakarbita  on  the  eastern  border.  In  terms  of  trade \nvalue,7  Birganj  is  the  most  important,  accounting  for  about  50%  each  of  the  country\u2019s  bilateral \ntrade with India and with third countries. Bhairawa is mainly for trade with India, accounting for \nabout 20% of bilateral trade. Biratnagar accounts for 16% of trade with India, and 17% with third \ncountries.  Kakarbita  accounts  for  7%  of  trade  with  India,  and  6%  with  third  countries,  mainly \nBangladesh  and  Bhutan.  Tribhuvan  International  Airport  (TIA)  accounts  for  23%  of  trade  with \nthird  countries.  (sector  analysis:  an  overview  of  SASEC  and  Nepal  trade  development  is  in \nAppendix 2 and Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n20. \nNepal\u2019s  import  documents  are  subject  to  Indian  inspection  by  checking  documents \nunless  there  is  some  irregularity,  and  by  Nepalese  customs,  which  also  check  the  documents \nand may inspect the cargo. In most cases, clearance requires about a day on either side of the \nborder.  All  import  cargos  from  countries  other  than  India  are  emptied  for  open  customs \ninspection in Nepal.  Nepali  containerized  export  cargo  to  third  countries  will  be  inspected  by \nIndian  customs  if  one-time  seals  are  broken,  prolonging  clearing  time  but  also  limiting \ncontainerized  transport.  The  local  business  community  is  increasingly  demanding  that  the \nGovernment  upgrade  customs\u2019  physical  facilities  and  inspect  cargo  selectively.  Customs \noperation hours differ slightly between India and Nepal and need coordination. \n \n21. \nThe automated system for customs data (ASYCUDA) is a computerized cargo clearance \nsystem that speeds up clearance by using information technology and reducing and simplifying \ncustoms  documentation  and  procedures.  ASYCUDA \nincreases  revenue  by \ncomputerizing  customs  tariffs,  and  (ii)  providing  reliable  and  timely  trade  and  fiscal  statistics. \nASYCUDA  is  installed  in  more  than  70  countries.  The  customs  broker,  declaration-processing, \nselectivity, and account modules are usually introduced in the initial phase of implementation. \n \nThe customs declaration and accounts modules are used at TIA; Birganj, Bhairawa, and \n22. \nBiratnagar ICDs; and Kakarbita customs office. These places have no selectivity module, which, \nassisted  by  risk  management  and  post-declaration  units,  would  help  intercept  high-risk \ntransactions  without  excessively  delaying  customs  clearance  of  low-risk  goods.  The  customs \nbroker module needs to be installed to allow brokers to prepare and input declarations from their \noffice computer directly into the ASYCUDA in the customs office. A wide-area-network (WAN) is \nurgently  needed.  Via  existing  telephone  lines,  it  will  enable  automatic  update  of  customs \ninformation  and  operational  monitoring  and  procedural  change  to  all  connected  customs \noutposts.  The  procedures  of  the  accounting  module,  which  enables  the  system  to  control \npayment  of  revenue  on  a  declaration  basis,  need  to  be  adjusted  to  accommodate  local \nlanguages and to capture transactions based on bank guarantees and deposits. The Project will \n\nthus  (i) \n\n                                                 \n7   Department of Customs. 2003.

The DOC post-evaluation \naudit unit, which was set up to carry out post-declaration audits at the importers\u2019 premises, will \nbe strengthened.  \n \n23. \nGovernment  Policies  and  Plans.  The  Five-Year  Plan,  which  is  a  poverty  reduction \nstrategy,  stresses  economic  growth,  pro-poor  development,  and  equitable  distribution  of \nincome.  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  for  fostering  broad-based  growth  hinges  on  a  revival  of \nagriculture, and a recovery in manufacturing, tourism, and exports. The Government\u2019s policy is \nto boost trade and industry, improve public resource management, and integrate Nepal into the \nregional and world economies. Domestic and international trade will be promoted, including by \n(i)  lowering  trade  transport  costs  through  development  of  ICDs  and  strategic  roads,  and \nimplementing the multimodal transport strategy; and (ii) improving customs administration. The \nFive-Year Plan recognizes the need to expand output capacity and improve the efficiency of the \nprivate  sector.  The  Government  will  focus  on  creating  a  favorable  environment  to  achieve \nprivate  sector  development;  giving  incentives  to  export-oriented  industries  and  private  and \nforeign investment; and reducing exporting cost, especially the trade transport costs. Steps will \nbe  taken  to  increase  the  number  of  private  sector-managed ICD terminals, expand technical \nassistance programs for export commodities, and revise existing acts and regulations to make \nthem compatible with WTO and SAFTA requirements.  \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nIdentified Choke Points \n\n1. \n \n \n24. \nThe transit and trade choke points in SASEC key corridors are classified by those that \nneed  to  be  worked  out  through  bilateral  and  multilateral  mechanisms  and  those  that  can be \nacted  by  Nepal  alone.  The  corridor  from  Katmandu  to  the  southern  border  at  Birganj  and \nBhairawa to  Raxaul to Kolkata and Haldia ports face the following problems: (i) long road transit \nfrom Kolkata to Raxaul due to distance and poor roads, (ii) high insurance/bond costs at Kolkata \nport imposed by Kolkata Port Trust to ensure that goods will reach Nepal. As a result, additional \ncost is added to the traded goods; (iii) congestion at the border at Raxaul; (iv) the need for much \nsimpler  and  common  forms  of  documentation  and  one-stop  inspection  at  the  Indian-Nepal \nborder,  with  both  sides  operating  from  the  same  facility;  (v)  the  need  to  encourage  Nepalese \ntruck owners to take their trucks to Kolkata/Haldia in India; (vi) the need to improve regulations \nfor foodstuff testing and quarantine to avoid cargo clearance delay at the borders; and (vi) the \nneed for an agreement on use of compatible electronic data interchange system between India \nand Nepal to provide data for the full use of the advanced cargo information system (ACIS). The \ncorridor  from  Kathmandu  to  Kakarbita-Fulbari-Banglabandha-Dhaka-Mongla  and  Chittagong \nports faces restrictive transit agreements among Bangladesh, India, and Nepal with respect to \nfree movement of goods and vehicles. In addition, Nepal needs to use the transit route to get to \nMumbai  (which  is  closer  to  Europe  than  by  Kolkata)  in  India.  A  study8 recommends solutions, \nwhich SASEC TWG is deliberating, to remove or minimize existing restrictions/impediments on \nmovement  of  goods  and  vehicles  to  each  country  to  enhance  economic  integration  in  the \nsubregion.  \n \n25. \n\nThe following choke points can be addressed in Nepal alone: \n(i) \n\nCustoms  procedures  should  be  changed  to  remove  the  requirement  to  inspect \n100% of import and export cargo besides that from India, and to focus instead on \ntrade  facilitation  and  selectivity  analysis  to  identify  cargo  for  inspection.  This \nrequires  a  modernized  cargo  clearance  system  and  supporting  institutional  set-\n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for Subregional Corridor Operational Efficiency Study. Manila. (Draft final report). \n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nups such as intelligence units. The new procedures will not only reduce customs \nclearance  time  and  document  requirements  but  also  minimize  opportunities  for \n\u201cfacilitation payments.\u201d \nMeasures should be adopted for controlled  payment of revenue on a declaration \nbasis,  accurate  and  rapid  declaration  processing,  and  easy  access  to  updated \ncustoms information. This requires procedural adjustment to improve accounting \nmodule of ASYCUDA, currently being used in Nepal Customs.   \nInstallation  of  a  WAN  system  to,  among  others,  facilitate  all  customs  offices \ncomplying with new policies and to expedite audit reporting. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv)  Well-equipped  ICDs  should  be  provided  at  other  major  gateways,  especially \nKakarbita  customs  area,  the  most  important  gateway  at  the  eastern  border  of \nNepal, is conducted in a large customs yard, where many facilities are in a state \nof  disrepair.  The  original  surfacing  has  disintegrated  and  is  deeply  pot-holed, \nmaking  working  conditions  difficult  and  dirty,  particularly  during  the  monsoon. \nThe  proposed  ICD  will  allow  efficient  cargo  inspection  and  assortment,  and \nreduce  cargo  clearance  time,  cargo  damage,  and  pilferage  during  the  waiting \ntime.  \nRoad  from  the  Birganj  ICD  to  the  Tribhuvan  highway  should  be  decongested.   \nThe road from Bhairawa ICD to the EWH should be shortened in order to reduce \ntransport cost and travel time.  The road from Hetauda to Kathmandu should be \nimproved. \n\n(v) \n\n \n26. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  remove  the  choke  points  (para.  25)  by  (i)  installing  the \nselectivity,  brokers,  and  direct  trade  input  modules  of  ASYCUDA,  and  WAN  at  major customs \noffices,  including  headquarters;  (ii)  building  a  well-designed  ICD  at  Kakarbita,  the  most \nimportant  trade  gateway  at  the  eastern  border;  (iii)  improving  the  access  roads  at  the  most \nimportant  trade  gateways  at  the  southern  border;  and  (iv)  strengthening  DOC\u2019s  institutional \ncapacity.  \n \n\n2. \n\nRoad Maintenance and Fund  \n\n  \n27. \n The Nepal Road Board has been in operation since January 2004, with the appointment \nof  its  executive  director.  Its  funding  is  sourced  mainly  from  fuel  levies  (48.7%),  vehicle \nregistration  fees  (33.5%),  and  tolls  (17.8%).  These  will  be  used  to  maintain  all  roads.9  Due to \npresent  situation  in  the  country,  however,  the  Road  Board  has  not  been  able  to  raise  the  full \namount  as  envisaged.  For  FY2003/04,  the  total  fund  resources  are  NRs394  million.  Of  this, \nNRs200 million is allocated for SRN roads, NRs132 million for urban roads, NRs54.1 million for \ndistrict  roads,  and  NRs7.9  million  for  administrative  expenses.  These  amounts  cannot  even \nmeet the maintenance requirement for SRN roads. DOR has the mandate to provide for routine, \nrecurrent, emergency, and periodic maintenance for all SRN roads. Total demand in FY2003/04 \nis  NRs750  million.  DOR  obtained  NRs200  million  from  the  Road  Fund,  NRs300  million  from \nfiscal  budget  allocation,  and  the  rest  from  international  donors.  Underfunding  of  road \nmaintenance is expected to continue for the next 4-5 years until the fund revenue substantially \nexpands due to increased economic activities. Until then, the Government has to provide budget \nsupport for SRN and other road maintenance.  \n \n28. \nThe Government  has  given  priority  to  routine  and  recurrent  road  maintenance  of  SRN \nover recent years. Three roads in Nepal are tolled. At least 70% of the tolls will be exclusively \n                                                 \n9  Types of road maintenance: (i) routine, such as cleaning drainage and cutting of grass,  required continuously on \nevery  road;  (ii)  recurrent,  such  as  repairing  potholes,  grading,  patching,  trimming,  filling,  and  resealing  cracks, \nrequired at intervals within a fiscal year, to keep pavement in good condition; (iii) emergency, required to deal with \nemergency situations such as landslide, erosion, flood, etc.; and (iv) periodic, such as regraveling and surfacing, \nrequired every several years to rejuvenate the road pavement. \n\n \n\n\f \n8\n\n \n\nused  for  routine  and  recurrent  maintenance  of  tolled  roads.  Tolling  has  to  be  approved  by  the \nGovernment through the Road Board.  Under  the  Project,  the  Government  will  include  the  two \nborder access roads as part of SRN, and toll the completed roads, especially since these roads \nwill  be  largely  used  by  commercial  vehicles.  During  project  implementation,  the  toll  level  and \ncollection  methodology  will  be  studied.  Tolls  will  be  set  at  a  level  at  least  to  meet  periodic \nmaintenance cost.  \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \n29. \nSince  1972,  ADB  has  provided  seven  road  projects  totaling  $200.0  million,  and  TA \ntotaling $3.0 million. Following the early delays and cost overruns due mainly to inflation-related \ncost increases, ADB projects in the subsector have been generally successful.  \n \n30. \nOver  the  last  few  years,  ADB  portfolio  performance  in  Nepal  has  been  affected  by \npolitical,  economic,  and  security  uncertainties.  The  contract  award  ratio  in  Nepal  is  far  lower \nthan the ADB average, and disbursements have fallen sharply over the past 5 years. Since the \nbreakdown  of  the  cease-fire,  there  has  been  difficulty  in  fielding  consultants,  using  explosives \nfor  construction,  securing  government  participation  in  field  activities,  and  ensuring  delivery  of \nproject inputs. Major donors active in Nepal are improving quality-at-entry procedures to avoid \npremature  entry  of  new  projects  in  the  portfolio.  Intensive  interactions  with  senior  government \nofficials are being held quarterly to seek solutions. \n \n31. \nThe Project will allow advance action to recruit consultants and prepare the commercial \ncomponents  of  the  bidding  documents  for  civil  works,  with  the  qualification  requirements.  The \nissues on counterpart staff and funds are addressed in the project assurances. The project sites \nare  in  the  southern  and  eastern  Nepal  and  may  be  less  affected  than  other  areas  by  the \ninsurgency.  Nevertheless,  a  conservative \nis  made.  Active \nconsultations  and  public  participations  are  promoted  and  will  be  continued,  particularly  with \nrespect to land acquisition, and prevention of HIV/AIDS10 and human trafficking.  \n \n32. \nEarly, competitive, and transparent selection of an ICD operator is necessary so that the \nnewly built ICD facilities can be used immediately and economic and financial benefits realized \nas soon as possible. The Government assures that an operator will be selected three months \nbefore  completion  of  the  Kakarbita  ICD.  Experiences  from  the  previous  exercise  will  help  in \nselecting the ICD operator.  Strong political will is essential for the SASEC countries to address \nissues  with  respect  to  legal  and  institutional  arrangements  among  them  to  maximize  project \nbenefits. The SASEC TWG provides the forum for problem solving. ADB\u2019s support for SASEC \nactivities will take a consolidated approach in country assistance plans for subregional issues. \nADB\u2019s  experience  in  regional  cooperation  shows  that  noncontroversial  projects  that  can  be \nquickly  implemented  should  be  identified.  The  Project  is  designed  for  concrete  activities  with \nsmall  loan  size  yet  with  big  impact  on  subregional  cooperation.  Neighboring  countries  have \nbeen consulted at different forums and levels.  \n  \n\nimplementation  schedule \n\n4. \n\nADB's Strategy \n\n \n33. \nADB is mandated by its Charter to foster economic growth and cooperation in Asia and \nthe  Pacific  region  and  to  help  accelerate  regional  economic  integration  and  development,  and \npoverty reduction. ADB\u2019s strategy for economic cooperation in South Asia will focus on support \nin three main areas: (i) policy reforms and institutional strengthening to promote cooperation in \nsome  of  the  key  sectors  stated  in  the  Islamabad  Declaration,  such  as  transportation,  trade, \ninvestment  and  private  sector  development,  energy  and  power,  information  communications \n\n                                                 \n10  human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nand  technology,  and  tourism;  (ii)  subregional  investment  projects  in  the  key  sectors;  and  (iii) \nbroad  cooperation  between  South  Asia  and  its  subregions,  and  other  regions.  ADB  will \nmainstream regional cooperation into country strategies and programs for the region.  \n \nThe  overarching  objective  of  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program  for  Nepal  is  to \n34. \nachieve  sustainable  reduction  in  poverty  by  fostering  inclusive  processes  of  pro-poor growth, \nsocial  development,  and  good  governance.  ADB  will  assist \n(i)  Transport  and \nCommunications,  (ii)  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development,  (iii)  Finance  and  Private  Enterprise \nDevelopment,  (iv)  Energy  and  (v)  Regional  Development.  ADB  will  help  the  Government \npromote  subregional  connectivity  and  border-trade  connections  with  neighboring  countries  by \ndeveloping  road,  airport,  and  telecommunication  infrastructure  to  reduce  transport  costs  and \ncustoms-processing  delays.  As  security  conditions  permit,  ADB  will  help  revive  the  traditional \ntrade and transport corridors that connect Nepal to the PRC and India. \n\nin \n\n \n5. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\n \nADB has provided much technical and financial support to improve transit logistics and \n35. \ntrade facilities in the SASEC subregion. The World Bank loaned $23.5 million to Nepal to help \nbuild  an  ICD  at  Birganj,  renovate  two  ICDs  at  Biratnagar  and  Bhairawa,  install  ASYCUDA \naccounting  and  declaration  modules  and  the  ACIS,  and  introduce  institutional  and  legal \nchanges. ADB is preparing further assistance to SAARC for transport connectivity in South Asia.  \nThe external assistance to road and multimodal transport sector is in Appendix 3. \n \n36. \nThe GOI is studying the feasibility of improving road/rail connections with Nepal.  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA) is working on the last section from Banepa to Sindhuli, \nwhich, once completed, will shorten the road from Kakarbita to Kathmandu by 140 km. The PRC \nis  helping  Nepal  upgrade  the  Syaphrubesi-Rasuwagadhi  road  connecting  to  the  PRC  border, \nand has proposed to provide a container scanner at Birganj ICD to strengthen security.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nObjective  \n\n \nA. \n \n37. \nThe Project\u2019s objective is to help integrate Nepal\u2019s economy into the subregions and the \nworld.  The  Project  is  part  of  ADB\u2019s  SASEC  program  to  support  subregional  cooperation  by \nupgrading  governance  capacity,  improving  transport  facilities,  and  making  trade  management \nmore efficient and effective.  \n \nB. \n  \n\nComponents and Outputs \n \n1. \n\nICD Access Road Component \n\n \n38. \nThe  Project  will  finance  (i)  upgrading/construction  of  a  two-lane  access road with 7 m \nwide  carriageway  with  up  to  50  m  right  of  way  of  Birganj  ICD  (Padam  road)  to  Tribhuvan \nHighway (about 12.4 km), to enable trucks and buses to avoid the congested Birganj and Jitpur \nmarket area on the Tribhuvan highway leading to Kathmandu and other parts of Nepal; and (ii) \nupgrading  of  a  shortcut  gravel  road  at  Bhairawa  to  a  two-lane  access  road  with  7  m  wide \ncarriageway and 18 m corridor of influence, to shorten the route from Bhairawa to the EWH at \nBhumahi leading to Kathmandu and other parts of Nepal (about 29 km).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n10\n\n \n\n2. \n\nICD Component \n\n \n39. \nThe  Project  will  finance  construction  of  a  7.5  ha  road  ICD  at  Kakarbita  at  the  eastern \nborder,  with  all  necessary  facilities  such  as  fence,  lighting,  cover  shed,  weighbridge, \nadministration  buildings,  and  container  platform.  A  separate  immigration  office  and  other \nfacilities will be provided which will also help efforts being undertaken in the country to prevent \nhuman trafficking. Built-in security measures are designed to include proper fencing and guard \nposts. ICD security measures will be further examined in line with the country\u2019s regulations and \nbusiness  practices,  and  security  requirements  of  international  best  practice  and  destination \nports.  \n\n \n3. \n\n \n4. \n\nAutomation System of Customs Cargo Clearance and Management  \n\n \n40. \nThe  Project  will  finance  (i)  installation  of  the  ASYCUDA  selectivity,  and  broker\u2019s  direct \ntrade  input  modules  at  the  customs  offices  at  Kakarbita,  Krisnagar,  Tatopani,    TIA,  Birganj, \nBhairawa, Biratnagar, and Birganj ICD; and (ii) equipment purchase and installation of  WAN at \nthe  above  customs  offices,  plus  Nepalganj  and  Mahendranagar,  linked  with  a  central  control \nroom  in  customs  headquarters  via  existing  telephone  lines,  covering  98.4%  of  Nepal\u2019s  total \ntrade value.  \n\nInstitutional Capacity Building \n\nPromoting Subregional Cooperation and Governance Capacity \n\n \n41.          The  Project  will  provide  training  of  trainers  and  end  users  of  customs  facilities  for  (i) \noperation,  maintenance,  and  procedural  adjustment  of  ASYCUDA  modules  and  the  WAN \nsystem;  (ii)  setting  up  of  an  intelligence  unit  and  risk  management  system;  (iii)  assisting  in \npreparation  of  instruction  manuals  of  the  intelligence  unit,  and  training  of  customs  officers  in \nintelligence gathering, analysis, and related techniques; and (iv) post-declaration evaluation and \ncustoms valuation of harmonized customs duties.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n \n1. \n \n42. \nNepal  actively  promotes  subregional  cooperation  and  economic  integration.  The \nGovernment plans to (i) complete the computer-based customs facilitation systems and cargo-\ntracking  systems,  (ii)  continue  efforts  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  DOC \nand  the  transparency  in  collection  of  customs  revenues,  (iii)  establish  effective  procedures  to \nclear  sealed  containers,  allowing  them  to  travel  to  and  from  Kathmandu,  (iv)  establish  the \ncarriage  of  goods  by  road,  railway,  and  multi-modal  transport  acts,  (v)  reform  and  update \nNepal's insurance laws for the carriage of goods by road and maritime transport, (v) strengthen \nthe freight-forwarding industry, and (vi) provide well-equipped ICDs and construct better access \nroads  for  trade  transport.  The  Government  is  working  bilaterally  and  multilaterally  to  improve \ninstitutional,  policy,  and  legal  arrangements  through  SASEC  and  SAARC.  Under  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Three-Year  Customs  Reform  and  Modernization  Action  Plan,  the  Government \nhas shown strong commitment to modernize customs along the line of (i) simple and modern \nprocedures;  (ii)  effective  post-release  review  of  customs  declarations;  (iii)  use  of  information \ntechnology;  (iv)  introduction  of  effective  forms  of  organization  and  management  with  clear \nobjectives,  strategic  and  operational  plans,  performance  criteria,  and  management  and \nstrategies  for  integrity;  and  (v)  orientation  of  the  institution  toward  service.  As  part  of  overall \ncustoms  reform  program  aided  by  United  Conference  on  Trade  and  Development  (UNCTAD), \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO),  World  Customs \nOrganization (WCO),  and  World  Bank,  ASYCUDA/WAN  installation  and  capacity  building  are \nexpected to (i) expedite customs clearance; (ii) reduce opportunity for unintended payment for \n\n \n\n\f11\n\n \n\n \n2. \n\ncargo  inspection;  (iii)  increase  Government  fiscal  revenue  from  customs  duties,  (iv)  improve \nservices, and (v) strengthen capacity for sustaining the reform process.  \n \n\nPublic-Private Partnership (PPP) \n\n3. \n\nHIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking  \n\n \n43. \nThe  Five-Year  Plan  recognizes  that  private  sector  participation  in  public  infrastructure \nareas  will  be  gradual.  PPP  is  necessary  to promote private sector development at this stage. \nThe  Government  will  continue  to  promote  private  sector  development  and  attract  foreign \ninvestment.  The  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  new  ICD  will  be  privatized  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding  and  a  transparent  process  after  completion,  when  the \ninvestment  risk  is  reduced.  This  is  the  best  practical  approach  as  demonstrated  by  the  recent \nsimilar project in the country, particularly given the present political and security situation.  \n \n \n \n44. \nThe  Project  recognizes  the  importance  of  preventing  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking, \nwhich is in line with Five-Year Plan. Separate immigration office and facilities will be provided in \nthe  Kakarbita  ICD  to  facilitate  identification  of  illegal  immigrants.  In  the  project  area,  local \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  international  donor  agencies,  and  the  Government  are \nalready  carrying  out  HIV/AIDs  awareness  campaigns  and  anti-trafficking  programs.  With the \nDepartment of Health and other local agencies, the Project will carry out similar activities among \nconstruction workers and high-risk communities along the highway, border police, and customs \nofficers,  using \ninformation,  education,  and  communications  materials \n(Supplementary Appendix B).  \n \n\nthe  media,  and \n\n4. \n\nRoad Safety and Axle-Load Control \n\n \n45. \nThe  increase  in  vehicle  density,  together  with  lack  of  road  safety  measures  and  poor \nenforcement  and  roadworthiness  of  vehicles,  has  led  to  serious  problems.  In  2003,  Nepal \nexperienced 43 deaths per 10,000 vehicles, which is high. The Traffic Engineering and Safety \nUnit of DOR  is responsible for road safety,  collects traffic accident data, and conducts safety \naudits for all SRN roads.  To improve and expand existing road safety programs, a road safety \ncommittee has been set up and chaired by the minister for transport management. Successful \nmanagement  of  heavy  vehicle  loads  will  result  in  more  economical  road  designs  and  reduced \nroad maintenance and rehabilitation costs. The Ministry of Public Planning and Works (MPPW) \nhas, in accordance with the Vehicle and Transport Management Act and Public Roads Act, set \na maximum legal limit of 10.2 tons per axle for all vehicles. A pragmatic and enforceable heavy-\nvehicle management policy is being drafted and expected to be approved by MPPW by the end \nof 2004. \n \nThe new aligned sections of the two access roads under the Project will meet the road \n46. \nsafety  standards  on  road  geometry,  intersections,  and  side  drains.  On  the  exiting alignment, \naccident-prone  places  or  black  spots  will  be  identified  and  improved.  Safety  audit  will  be \nconducted  during  and  immediately  after  detailed  design  is  completed  and  before  going  to \ntender. For both roads, road painting and road signs will be provided to reduce accidents. The \nproject  design  will  incorporate  bus  stands;  separate  lanes  for  bullock  carts,  cycles,  and \nrickshaws; and pedestrian facilities. The training and public awareness campaign on road safety \nunder the RNDP will be extended to  this Project. The Government will use the weighbridges in \nthe Birganj, Bhairawa, and Kakarbita ICDs to control overloading.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n12\n\n \n\nCost Estimates \n\nD. \n \n47. \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $26.7  million  equivalent  (Table  1).  Foreign \nexchange costs are estimated at $15.7 million, representing 59% of the total project cost. The \nlocal currency cost is estimated at $11 million.

MPPW will be the Executing Agency (EA), and DOR the Implementing Agency (IA). Both \nhave long experience in implementing ADB-financed road projects. The ADB project directorate, \nestablished in 1987, and fully functional under  previous projects, will be maintained within DOR \nand serve as the  project implementation unit (PIU) for overall project coordination, monitoring, \nand  implementation.  The  PIU  will  include  technical  staff  from  DOR  and  NITDB  to  provide \ntechnical  support  for  cargo  clearance  automation,  institutional  strengthening,  and  ICD  design \nand  construction.  This  type  of  arrangement  has  proven  to  be  effective  under  a  recent  similar \nproject.  In  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  Civil  Service  Act  &  Regulation,  DOR  will  maintain  the \nappointed  full-time  project  director  for  at  least  the  initial  two  years  of  project  implementation, \nsubject  to  satisfactory  performance,  and  promptly  inform  ADB  of  any  change  of  the  project \ndirector.  DOR  will  ensure  that  the  person  appointed  will  (i)  be  a  senior  officer  with  adequate \ntechnical  and  administration  experience  and  qualifications,  and  (ii)  be  assisted  by  appropriate \nand adequate technical, financial, and administrative staff. One project office in Kathmandu and \nthree  field  project  offices  will  be  set  up  to  be  responsible  for  day-to-day implementation, and \nreport to the project director in the PIU. \n \nA  project  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  MPPW,  will  be  set  up  to \n50. \noversee  project  implementation.  The  committee  will  comprise  senior  officials  of  MPPW/DOR, \nNational Planning Commission (NPC), MOF, MOICS, DOC, Federation of Nepalese Chambers \nof Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), and Nepal Freight Forwarders Association (NFFA). Other \nstakeholders representing the end users may be invited to give advice. The steering committee \nwill  meet  at  least  twice  a  year  to  review  project  implementation,  and  may  meet  whenever \nnecessary. \n \nThe  PIU  project  director  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  all  aspects  of  project \n51. \nimplementation  and  management,  including  procurement,  progress  monitoring,  financial \nmanagement, reporting, land acquisition and resettlement, and HIV/AIDs and human-trafficking \nprevention  programs.  The  project  director  will  act  as  project  coordinator  among  concerned \nGovernment agencies. The project implementation organization chart is in Appendix 5. \n \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n \nThe Project will be implemented over five years, inclusive of preconstruction and a 12-\n52. \nmonth  defect  liability  period,  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  December  2009.  The  civil \nworks  will  commence  around  May  2006.  This  schedule  is  dependent  on,  among  others,  (i) \nconsultants  being  engaged  by  the  end  of  May  2005;  and  (ii)  land  being  made  available,  free \nfrom  any  encumbrances,  within  about  20  months  after  the  Project  starts,  and  before \nconstruction. The summary implementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n\nProcurement  \n\n \n53. \nThe  project  director,  supported  by  an  adequate  number  of  staff  members  and \nconsultants  with  the  appropriate  mix  of  technical  and  contract  management  skills,  will  be \nresponsible for all procurement. ADB will supervise procurement by closely monitoring all major \nproject implementation activities. Three civil works contracts for access roads and one contract \nfor  ICD  construction  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding.  Local \ncontractors are expected to participate in bidding. One supply contract for WAN equipment and \nservices will be awarded on the basis of international shopping. A summary of indicative project \nprocurement  packages  is  in  Appendix  7  and  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  All  contracts  will  be \n\n \n2. \n\n \n3. \n\n \n\n\f \n14\n\n \n\nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.    ADB's  standard  bidding \ndocuments for international competitive bidding will  be used. However, because the contracts \nare  small,  qualification  requirements  will  be  included  in  the  bidding  documents  for  evaluation \nwhen  bids  are  received.  Equipment  for  international  shopping  will  be  accepted  for  supply \ncontracts  of  less  than  $500,000,  and  direct  purchase  will  be  applied  for  small  or  off-the-shelf \nitems of less than $100,000.  \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n4. \n \n54. \nConsulting  services,  international  and  domestic,  will  be  required  to  help  the  EA \nimplement  the  Project.  A  firm  of  international  consultants  (Consultant)  in  association  with \ndomestic  consultants  will  help  in  (i)  institutional  capacity  building,  including  document \npreparation  and  specification  recommendation  for  equipment,  and  training  for  the  ASYCUDA \ncomponent;  (ii)  detailed  design,  procurement,  and  construction  supervision  and  contract \nadministration  for  access  roads  and  ICD,  (iii)  study  and  recommendation  of  toll  levels  and \ncollection  methodology,  and  (iv)  monitoring  and  verifying  of  resettlement  action  plans, \nenvironment management plans, and the HIV/AIDs and human-trafficking prevention program. \nAbout  37  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  301  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants will be required. About 2 person-months of international individual consultants and 2 \nperson-months  of  domestic  individual  consultants  will  be  recruited  by  MPPW  on  the \nrecommendation  of  National  Vigilance  Center  (NVC),  in  line  with  ADB's  procedures  and \napproved terms of reference (TORs)  to  help  the  EA  carry  out  project  technical  auditing.  Draft \nTORs for the international consulting firm are in Appendix 8, and that for individual consultants \nin  Supplementary  Appendix  D.  The  international  consulting  firm  will  be  selected  and  engaged \nusing ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection procedures for recruiting firms under full technical \nproposals  (FTP)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s    Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  All  individual \nconsultants will be selected and engaged in line with  ADB's procedures for recruiting individual \nconsultants. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Action  \n\nTo  ensure  project \n\n \nfor \n55. \nprocurement  and  recruitment  to  expedite  selection  of  consultants  and  preparation  of  the \ncommercial  components  of  the  bidding  documents  for  civil  works,  with  the  qualification \nrequirements.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  action  does  not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project.  \n\nimplementation  readiness,  advance  action \n\nis  approved \n\nDisbursement \n\n \n6. \n \nAn  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in \n56. \naccordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  and \ndetailed arrangements between the Government and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited in \nthe imprest account will be based on the estimated expenditures for six months or 10% of the \nloan  amount, whichever is lower.  The account will be established with Nepal Rastra  Bank.   To  \nexpedite  disbursement  during  implementation,  statement  of   expenditures   will  be  used   to  \nreimburse or liquidate the imprest advance for any individual payment not exceeding $100,000.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audits \n\na. \n\nReports \n\n15\n\n \n\nb. \n\n \nThe  Consultant  will  submit  monthly  progress  reports  to  DOR,  MPPW, MOICS, NITDB, \n57. \nDOC,  and  ADB.  DOR  will  ensure  that  the  Consultant  include  in  the  reports  the  status  of  land \nacquisition,  resettlement,  environmental  management,  training,  prevention  of  HIV/AIDS  and \nhuman trafficking, and other activities critical to project implementation but not directly included \nin  the  scope  of  engineering  services.  Within  three  months  of  physical  completion,  DOR  will \nsubmit  a  project  completion  report  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB.  DOR  will  monitor  project \npreparation  and  implementation  in  accordance  with  the  implementation  schedule,  and  keep \nADB informed of any significant deviations that could result in the schedule not being met. \n \n \n \n58. \n  A  financial  management  assessment  of  DOR  and  NITDB  has  been  carried out. DOR \nwill maintain separate project records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and services \nfinanced from the loan proceeds, financing resources received, project expenditures, and use of \nlocal  funds.  The  accounts  for  all  project  expenditures  will  be  set  up  in  accordance  with \nconsistent  and  sound  accounting  principles  and  in  line  with  the  law.  An  independent  auditor \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  will  audit  consolidated  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements \nannually.  Due  to  the  diversity  of  the  project  components  and  sites,  and  procedures  involved \namong MPPW, MOF, and the auditor general\u2019s office, unaudited and audited project accounts \nand financial statements will be submitted to ADB within six and nine months, respectively, after \nthe end of the fiscal year to which they relate. The audit requirements should include an audit \nwith separate opinion on the use of imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures. \n\nAccounts and Audits \n\n \n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Technical Auditing \n\n \n59. \nAssisted by the Consultant, DOR will develop a baseline for performance monitoring and \nevaluation in accordance with ADB's Project Performance Management System Handbook, and \nestablish  systematic  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  (PPME),  including  of \nbenefits. Surveys will be conducted before institutional training, installation of ASYCUDA/WAN, \nand  civil  works  construction;  every  year  during  the  Project;  and  one  year  after  project \ncompletion.  The  findings  and  supporting  data  will  be  indicated  in  project  implementation \nprogress  reports,  and \nthe  project  completion  report.  The  data  on \nimplementation  will  help  in  project  monitoring  as  well  as  in  early  identification  of  potential \nproblems.  The  performance  indicators  will  be  based  on  the  project  logical  framework  to \ndetermine  if  development  objectives  have  been  attained.  Before  the  project  midterm  review \n(MTR),  DOR,  assisted  by  individual  consultants  appointed  by  MPPW  from  among  NVC\u2019s \ntechnical  auditing  of  project  procurement,  contract \nnominees,  will  carry  out  project \nadministration, and quality inspection, in cooperation with NVC. The consultants\u2019 final report will \nbe submitted to ADB, and to NVC through MPPW. NVC will provide counterpart staff to help the \nconsultants carry out the technical auditing.  \n \n\nincorporated \n\ninto \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \nIn addition to regular reviews by ADB staff, a detailed MTR by the Government and ADB \n60. \nis  required  to  assess  the  Project\u2019s  progress  and  to  agree  upon  any  changes  to  scope  or \nimplementation  arrangements.  The  MTR  will  be  conducted  by  the  end  of  second  year  of \nimplementation. Two months before the MTR, the EA will submit to ADB a detailed status report \non project implementation. The TORs of the MTR will be included in the project administration \nmemorandum to be prepared by ADB\u2019s inception mission.  \n\n \n\n\f \n16\n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nPolicy and Institutional Impacts  \n\nEconomic and Financial Benefits  \n\n \nA. \n \nAs  a  step  forward  towards  integrating  subregional  transport  network,  the  Project, \n61. \ntogether  with  similar  initiatives,  will  provide  further  momentum  to  the  ongoing  subregional \ntransport  cooperation,  particularly  the  ongoing  deliberations  of  institutional  and  legal  issues \ninvolving the six key corridors, by making it a more urgent agenda item for the SASEC TWG.  \n \n62. \nThe  Project  will  facilitate  DOC\u2019s  institutional  strengthening  to  harmonize  and  simplify \ncustoms  clearance  procedures  and  increase  its  transparency.  This  and  project  technical \nauditing  will  reduce  opportunities  of  financial  irregularities  and  strengthen  NVC\u2019s  capacity  in \nroad sector technical auditing through hands-on experience. \n \n63. \nDOC will seek to harmonize border operation hours with neighboring countries to allow \nmaximum  clearance  of  cargo  movement  at  major  gateways.  Privatization  of  operation  and \nmaintenance of the proposed ICD at Kakarbita will help develop the private sector and enhance \noperation  the  ICD\u2019s  efficiency.  The  tolling  of  border  access  roads  will  strengthen  the  Road \nBoard\u2019s  maintenance  capacity.  These  measures  will  improve  transit  transport  and  trade \nfacilities,  and  thus  contribute  to  economic  growth,  reduce  poverty,  and  provide  scope  for \nincreased private sector participation.  \n \nB. \n \nThe economic and the financial analyses are respectively in Appendixes 9 and 10 and in \n64. \nSupplementary  Appendixes  E  and  F.  The  major  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are \nincremental,  resulting  from  reduced  VOC,  value  of  time  saved,  reduced  capital  required  for \ncargo owners, and reduced loss from goods damage.  \n \n65. \nNonquantifiable benefits include increased competitiveness for exporters and increased \nmarket  shares;  improved  productivity  of  customs  officers;  reduced  environmental  impact;  and \nincreased public awareness of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking, particularly among Government \nofficials, including customs officers. \n \n66. \nThe project benefits are not confined to Nepal. By reducing cargo-clearing time, goods \npilferage  and  damage,  and  transport  vehicle  operating  cost,  exporters  and  importers  of \nBangladesh, Bhutan, India, and others trading with Nepal will benefit from the improved border \nfacilities and accessibility. The Project will provide subregional economic benefits to all SASEC \ntrade communities. The benefits of economic integration,  particularly reduced transaction costs, \nwill help promote economic growth and reduce poverty in the subregion.11  \n \n67. \naccess road, 15.2% for the Kakarbita ICD, and 47.6% for ASYCUDA installation.  \n \nThe sensitivity of the overall project EIRR was analyzed with respect to changes in the \n68. \ncost-and-benefit  streams.  Seven  sensitivity  tests  were  conducted:  (i)  construction  costs \nincreased by 25%, (ii) construction period extended by 2 years, (iii) no generated traffic, (iv) no \ntime  savings,  (v)  traffic  growth  rates  reduced  by  25%,  (vi)  total  benefits  reduced  by  25%,  and \n(vii)  a  combination  of  (i)  and  (vi).  The  results  show  that  the  quantified  economic  benefits  are \nrobust.  The  EIRR  falls  below  12%  only  for  two  cases  in  the  Kakarbita  subcomponent,  where \n\nThe  base  case  EIRRs  are  32.7%  for  the  Bhairawa  access  road,  18.1%  for  the  Birganj \n\n                                                 \n11  If efficiency and transport costs of the six corridors were improved or reduced as recommended, regional GDP \n\nmight increase by 1% (footnote 8). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nSocial Impacts \n\ntotal benefits are reduced by 25% and where benefits are reduced as costs increase. Though \nthe EIRR is less than 12% in these cases, it is not far below the threshold, and the probability of \nit occurring is small, especially for the case where construction costs increase by 25% and total \nbenefits  decrease  by  25%.  The  EIRRs  are  based  on  conservative  estimates  of  traffic  growth, \nconsidering  risks  of  impassability  due  to  political  and  natural  causes.  Savings  from  accident \nreduction are not considered. \n \n69. \nThe financial evaluation for the Kakarbita ICD used real terms in constant 2004 prices. \nThe  project  cost  estimates  and  financial  projections  in  nominal  terms  were  converted  to  real \nterms  by  adjusting  for  the  projected  effects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation  and  currency \nfluctuation.  The  after-tax  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  9.8%,  which  compares \nfavorably with the after-tax weighted average cost of capital of 1.3%. The Project is considered \nfinancially  viable  and  sustainable.  Sensitivity  and  risk  analysis  indicates  that  the  FIRR  for  the \nKakarbita ICD is robust under most conditions.  \n \n70. \nThe Project includes placing tolls on the two border roads. While the details of the toll-\nsetting  mechanism  will  be  determined  during  project  implementation,  preliminary  financial \nanalysis  has  been  undertaken.  Traffic  forecasts  and  maintenance  costs  have  been  calculated \nand projected for the two roads. The toll rate is assumed to be similar to that applied on similar \nroads in Nepal (NRs0.36/km), and appears to generate sufficient revenue to cover maintenance \ncosts,  including  periodic  maintenance.  The  actual  toll  level  and  collection  methodology  will  be \nformulated  during  project  implementation  to  recover  maintenance  costs  at  periodic  level  or \nhigher without deviating from the project objective.  \n \nC. \n \n71. \nLand Acquisition and Resettlement.  The Project was developed to minimize the need \nfor land acquisition and resettlement. A full census has been undertaken for all affected persons \n(AP),  and  for  land,  structure,  and  assets  along  the  right  of  way  for  ICD  development  in \nKakarbita; for upgrading of two access roads to two-lane, 7 m carriageway from Bhairawa ICD \nto  Bhumahi  at  EWH  and  Birganj  ICD  to  Tribhuvan  highway;  and  for  widening  of  roads  at \nJeetpur. The Project will require acquisition of about 81 ha of private land to widen and improve \naccess  roads.  Construction  of  the  Kakarbita  ICD  will  not  require  any  land  acquisition  since \nadequate Government land (7.5 ha) is available. Acquisition of agricultural land will affect 2,412 \nhouseholds; 129 households will lose their residences, some of which are used for commercial \npurposes, along with six community structures. Overall the Project will affect 2,881 households \n(23,125 APs); 334 people will temporarily lose their income.  Compensation for land acquisition \nand  involuntary  resettlement  will  be  paid  as  per  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement  policy  and \nADB's Handbook on Resettlement 1998,  as amended from time to time, which will be provided \nfor  loss  of  livelihood,  shifting  of  structures/  goods,  income  restoration,  economic  rehabilitation, \nand lost community assets. No indigenous people will be harmed by the Project. The estimated \ncost  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  about  $4.8  million.  The  full  resettlement  plan  has \nbeen  translated  into  Nepali  and  disclosed  to  the  APs,  and  will  be  publicly  available  at  MPPW, \nDOR, ADB Nepal Resident Mission,  and the ADB Web site. A summary resettlement plan is in \nSupplementary Appendix G. \n \n72. \nPoverty Reduction. The Project will benefit Nepali truck owners, drivers, importers and \nexporters, customs brokers, passengers, local communities, and people in the trade and related \nsectors,  where  improved  competitiveness  and  market  share  will  increase  their  incomes.  The \nProject  will  benefit  the  poor  as  strengthened  fiscal  expenditure  due  to  economic  growth  will \nincrease  Government  expenditure  on  health,  education,  water  supply,  sanitation,  rural \nelectrification, and other basic services, as indicated in the Five-Year Plan. Local rural labor will \n\n \n\n\f \n18\n\n \n\nEnvironment Impacts \n\nAs  the  Project  is  categorized  as  \u201cB\u201d  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \n\nbenefit  from  road  construction  jobs  during  project  implementation  (Appendix  11,  Summary \nPoverty Reduction and Social Strategy). \n \nD. \n \n73. \nAssessment Guidelines 2003, an initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared. \n74. \nFor the road project component, the environmental impacts associated with construction \nwill  include  (i)  disruption  of  traffic  in  the  construction  area,  (ii)  increased  air  pollution  due  to \nincreasing  dust  and  other  volatile  chemical  substances  from  the  asphalt  plant,  (iii)  noise  and \nvibration,  (iv)  disruption  of  water  systems  due  to  filling  to  increase  embankment  and \nconstruction  of  bridges  and  culverts,  and  (v)  disruption  due  to  establishment  of  the  temporary \naccess  road.  These  impacts  will  occur  only  during  construction  and  can  be  mitigated  by \nmeasures  in  the  civil  works  contract.  During  operation,  traffic  congestion  will  be  reduced, \nimproving air quality due to reduced air pollution associated with inefficient car combustion. \n \nThe environmental impact of building the Kakarbita ICD will be limited to the ICD area, \n75. \nand mainly due to increased traffic to transport construction materials and equipment, and dust \nand noise from construction and demolition. The impact during operation will be mainly from the \nincreased  number  of  slow-moving  vehicles  and  increased  air  pollution  due  to  low  engine \ncombustion. Drainage wastewater needs to be properly treated before disposal into public water \nbodies  such  as  streams,  rivers,  or  irrigation  canals.  The  ICD  will  need  simple  solid  waste \nmanagement. The sub-power station should use only transformers free of PCBs.  \n \nThe summary IEE (Appendix 12) shows that environmental impacts associated with the \n76. \nProject  are  insignificant  and  can  be  mitigated.  No  environmentally  sensitive  areas  will  be \ndisrupted.  A  full  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  to  assess  the  project  impacts  is  not \nrequired.  \n \nE. \n \n77. \nThe Project has been carefully formulated to manage and mitigate risks. Advance action \nwill help expedite consultant recruitment and procurement. The PIU will be appropriately staffed. \nNGOs  will  be  selected  and  engaged  to  help  implement  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nplan.  The  Consultant  will  help  procure  land  and  monitor  project  implementation.  ADB  will \nrigorously  monitor  project  implementation  and  technical  auditing  throughout  the  project  period \nthrough  intensive  interactions  with  the  Government,  EA,  and  other  donors.  The  risk  of \ninadequate  counterpart  funding  has  been  addressed  by  gaining  Government  commitment  to \ninclude the Project in the Government\u2019s core projects starting in FY2005/06, to ensure that the \nbudget allocations for the Project will be protected, particularly the cost of land acquisition and \nresettlement.  \n \n78. \nin  project \nimplementation  and  constitutes  a  major  project  risk.  Therefore,  the  Project  has  been  in  full \nconsultation  with  local  communities  and  provides  a  conservative  implementation  period  and \nadequate contingencies.  \n \nThe  project  benefits  will  be  better  achieved  if  SASEC  transport  programs  proceed \n79. \nsmoothly. The strong political will of SASEC countries, particularly demonstrated by the SAARC \nIslamabad Declaration, provides much-needed political support for project implementation.  \n\nthe  conflict  since  2001  presents  serious  difficulties \n\nEscalation  of \n\nProject Risks \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n80. \nprovisions, which have been incorporated into the legal documents: \n \n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nLand acquisition and rese ttlement.

As  a \nresponse,  South  Asia  Sub-regional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC)  program  commenced  in \n2001.  A  steering  committee  comprising  secretaries  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  of  each \nparticipating country was established to provide overall guidance and support for activities under \nthe  SASEC  program.  The  steering  committee  has  identified  6  priority  areas  for  economic \ncooperation: \nInformation  and  Communications \nTechnology;  and  trade,  investment  and  private  sector  cooperation.  The  Transport  Working \nGroup  (TWG)  was  set  up  in  October  2001.  At  the  recommendation  of  TWG,  studies  were \ncarried out to identify system-wide impediments to smoother cross border movement of cargoes \nin the SASEC sub-region. At the TWG meeting in Bangkok in February 2004, it was established \nthat  certain  choke  points  along  key  sub-regional  transport  corridors  in  the  sub-region  would \nneed to be removed.  Among others, these are long and costly suppliy chains for both inbound \nand  outbound  goods,  inadequate  infrastructure  and  cumbersome  customs  procedures,  sub- \nstandard  traffic  management  at  the  borders,  ineffective  communications  and  cargo  tracking \nsystems,  costly  empty  backhauls,  lack  of  a  risk-based  cargo  sampling  system,  and  present \ntransit route arrangements need further rationalization. \n \n2. \nADB  has  been  active  in  promoting  subregional  cooperation  in  South  Asia.    Under  the \nSASEC framework, or under the individual country programs, several projects of significant sub-\nregional  implication  have  been  identified,  and  currently  under  implementation  or  being \nconsidered. Among these projects, the following five projects are of particular relevance to the \nproposed Transport Facilitation Project in Nepal.  \n \n\ntourism; \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nBangladesh:  Road  Network  Improvement  &  Maintenance  II  Project  ($124  million \nloan),  one  component  of  which  is  the  improvement  of  a  boarder  access  road  to \nBanglabandh (57km), a border point leading to Kakarbita/Nepal via Siliguri/India.  \nBangladesh: Proposed Chittaqong Port Trade Facilitation Project ($20 million loan). \nThe  possible  components  include:  (i)  development  of  a  link  road  to  container \nterminals  extended  from  the  envisaged  port  access  road;  (ii)  computerization  of \ncontainer terminal operation and enhanced link with customs computer systems; and \n(iii) customs component.  \nIndia:  Subregional  Transport  Connectivity  Project  including  the  improvement  of \nKakarbita - Siliguri - Fulbari, a link connecting Nepal to Bangladesh.   \nIndia:  land  waterway  sector  I  Project  ($150  million  loan)  which  will  improve  three \nto \ninland  waterways, \nBangladesh border along Bhramaputra River. \n\nthe  waterway  connecting  Guhawati/Assam \n\nincluding \n\n                                                 \n1  SAARC,  established  in  1985  was  the  first  regional  cooperation  initiative  to  promote  collaboration  and  mutual \nassistance in the economic, social, cultural, technical and scientific fields, and to strengthen cooperation among the \nmember  states  in  international  for  a  on  matters  of  common  interest.  It  comprises  seven  regional  countries,  i.e., \nBangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. \n\n\f24\n2            Appendix 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n(v) \n\nBhutan: Industrial Estate and Inland Clearance Depot Development Project. One of \nthe  two  components  is  the  development  of  an  ICD  at  Phuntsoling,  which  would  be \nconnected to Kolkata/Haldia via Siliguri.   \n\nNepal Trade and Related Issues \n\n \nThe  benefits  of  the  proposed  transport  facilitation  Project  are  a  natural  extension  of \n3. \nADB\u2019s efforts under SASEC and will complement the benefits of the above projects and assist \nthe  subregional  countries  to  reap  the  potential  of  economic  growth  by  way  of  strengthened \nsubregional economic cooperation.  \n \nB. \n  \nNepal\u2019s economy is highly reliant on foreign trade2. Nepalese trade experienced double-\n4. \ndigit growth in both exports and imports during the 1990s. The rate of export growth (11.4 %)3 \nwas  slightly  lower  than  the  rate  of  import  growth  (14.2%).  In  FY2003/04,  Nepal\u2019s  exports \nincreased by 6.4%, imports increased by 15.5% with a total trade value of NRs174, 283 million \n($2,421 million) and the trade deficit reached NRs74, 422 million ($1,034 million), representing a \n23.1%  increase  over  the  previous  year.  The  significant  widening  of  the  trade  deficit  in \nFY2003/04  stemmed  from  greater  economic  activity  in  the  second  half  of  the  year,  which \nboosted growth in total imports. Nepal\u2019s largest export commodity is garments ($165.1 million, \n23.8%  of  its  total  export  value),  followed  by  carpets  ($73.9  million)  and  Jute  goods  ($26.4 \nmillion). Correspondingly, the largest import commodity is basic manufactures ($484.6 million), \nfollowed by machines and transport equipment ($287.5 million) and mineral fuels ($277 million).  \n \n5. \nIndia  remains  the  single  largest  trading  partner  of  Nepal.  In  FY2002/03,  nearly  48%  of \nNepalese exports were destined for India, while nearly 22% of all imports originated from India. \nNepal\u2019s  exports  to  India  consist  mainly  of  primary  commodities  including  the  following:  lentils, \ncordage,  cardamom,  tooth  powder,  rice  bran  oil,  raw  jute,  linseed,  hides  and  skins  of  buffalo, \nfresh  ginger,  and  ayurvedic  herbs.  Thus,  like  Bangladesh,  Nepal\u2019s  exports  remain  narrowly \nbased  both  in  terms  of  product  composition  and  market  orientation.  The  principal  Nepalese \nimports from India are higher-value goods such as textiles, medicines, vehicles and machinery, \nas well as low value bulk goods including rice, cement and coal.     \n  \nIn  Nepal,  there  remains  a  relatively  strong  trade  orientation  towards  Europe  and  North \n6. \nAmerica for exports.  United States (27.6%) and Germany (7.5%) are the two largest recipients \nof  Nepalese  goods  besides  India.  In  the  first  nine  months  of  FY2003/04,  exports  to  third \ncountries increased by 20.8%. Asia is the major source of Nepalese imports, but much of this is \nentrepot  trade  moving  through  Singapore  and  Hong  Kong,  China.    Besides  India,  the  largest \nexporters to Nepal are People\u2019s Republic of China (13.2%) and United Arab Emirates (11.3%). \nThe  principal  non  sub-region  exports  from  Nepal  are  readymade  garments,  woolen  carpets, \npashmina  goods  and  other  handicrafts.    The  imports  to  Nepal  from  outside  the  subregion  are \nmuch more  diverse.  In terms of value, the principal commodities are jewelry, electrical goods \nand  machinery  and  equipment.

Key Indicators 2004. Manila. \n \n\nDespite the narrowness of Nepal\u2019s trading sector, trade has been a key factor behind the \n7. \nacceleration of Nepal\u2019s economic growth in the 1990s. It is estimated that Nepal\u2019s foreign trade \nmay increase annually by 15% for the next five years.  \n \nThe  South  Asia  Free  Trade  Area  is  expected  to  reduce  intra-region  trade  tariffs  in \n8. \naccordance  with  a  schedule  as  well  as  a  degree  based  on  the  development  maturity  of  the \nrespective member country. Member countries will eliminate non-tariff and para-tariff barriers or \nmake  them  less  restrictive  to  facilitate  intra-SAARC  trade.  Quantitative  restrictions  will  be \neliminated subject to certain conditions. Measures have been proposed for customs cooperation \nand removal of barriers for intra-SAARC investments. Generally, least developed countries4  will \nbe allowed to reduce their trade tariffs to 0-5% within a time frame of 10 years, while the non-\nLDCs (India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) will reduce tariffs to 0-5% within a time frame of 7 years.  \n \nIn March 2004, Nepal became the 147th member of the WTO.  Nepal has committed to a \n9. \ntimetable  of  legislative  reforms  required  to  comply  with  WTO  rules  on  trade  related  domestic \nregulations.  New  legislation  is  required  on  the  valuation  of  imports  for  customs  and  taxation \npurposes conforming to the Agreement on Customs Valuation. This blocks members from using \nminimum  or  reference  prices.  Adopting  WTO  methods  will  be  beneficial  only  after  Customs \ninspectors  have  received  training  in  valuation  methods  and  have  access  to  databases  with \npricing  information.  It  is  further  noted  that  Nepal  will  require  technical  assistance  to  maximize \nthe  benefits  of  WTO  membership  in  four  areas,  namely  Customs  Administration,  Intellectual \nProperty Rights Protection, Food and Plant Sanitary Measures, and Technical Standards. Nepal \nwill have to strengthen its competitiveness in agriculture, services and manufacture production \nand  productivity,  and  create  a  better  policy  development  of  tourism,  agriculture,  services, \nmanufacturing, and for attracting foreign as well as domestic private investment especially since \nof  the  Multi-Fiber  Agreement  quotas  in  2005  will  directly  affect  Nepal\u2019s  garments  export.  \nImproved transit logistics and trade facilities are essential to provide an enabling infrastructure \nfor implementing WTO-related measures.   \n \n\n                                                 \n4  Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives and Nepal.  \n\n\f        Appendix 2 \n\n 27 \n\nNepal  is  characterized  by  long  transport  distance,  dependence  on  transit  routes  for  its \n10. \nimports  and  exports,  poor  transit  logistics  and  trade  facilities  and  inadequate  infrastructure, \ncumbersome  goods  clearance  procedures  and  long  clearing  times  at  the  country\u2019s  major \ngateways, and a governance capacity which is yet  to be improved. Increasingly, the quality of \nlogistics  becoms  a  more  important  factor  to  affect  Nepal\u2019s  competitive  advantages  for  foreign \ntrade. The total transport time needs to be reduced and transport reliability increased. Buyers, \nespecially in the retail sector, have focused on order fulfillment and reduction in order cycle time \nas  critical  measures  of  performance.    The    importance  of  these  measures  has  increased  with \ndemands to reduce inventories throughout the supply chain and to deliver goods direct from the \nfactory to the final point of sale. Exporters rely on improved performance of not only outbound \nlogisitics to ensure timely delivery to buyers but also inbound logistics to reduce inventory costs \nand more importantly to reduce the order cycle for their products.   \n \n11. \nNepal has one of the most liberalized trade policies in the subregion. It has one of the \nlowest  average  tariffs  and  no  non-tariff  barriers.  With  SAFTA  agreements,  accession  to  WTO \nand  strengthened  subregional  trade  and  investment  cooperation,  Nepal\u2019s  trade  within  SASEC \nregion  and  other  countries  will  increase.  This  stresses  the  increasing  demand  for  improved \nlogistics  and  trade  facilities  to  reduce  transaction  cost  with  respect  to  transport  and  cargo \nclearance cost and delivery reliability. It will also help to convert informal trade and increase the \ncountry\u2019s revenue from duties and taxes. \n \n\n\f28         Appendix 3\n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO ROAD AND MULTIMODAL TRANSPORT SECTOR  \n\nProject\n\nHetauda-Narayanghar Road (upgrade)\nFeeder Roads\nSilgadhi-Sanfebagar Road\nRoad Improvement\nSecond Road  Improvement\nThird Road Improvement\nRoad Network Development Project\nNaubise-Pokhara\nNarayanghar-Mugling-Gorkha\nPokhara-Baglung\nKathmandu Ringroad\nSyaprubesi-Rasuwa\nMalekhu-Dhadhing\nBhianse-Hetauda\nBhainse-Hetauda\nKathmandu-Trisuli\nSunali-Pokhara\nKakarbita-Dhalkebar\nButwal-Kohalpur\nKohalphur-Mahakali\nBanepa-Sindhuli-Bardibas\nLamosangu-Jiri\nArniko Highway Maintenance Project\nRoad Resealing Works\nDharan-Dhankuta\nDamak-Belbari (rehabilitation)\nJogbeni-Dhankuta (rehabilitation)\nKakarbita-Damak (rehabilitation)\nHile-Bhojpur\nBasantpur-Terathum\nBhalubang-Puyathan\nButwal-Narayanghat\nBardibas-Jaleshwor\nJanakpur-Dhanushadham\nHetauda-Naryanghat\nRaxaual-Bhainse (upgrade)\nDhangadhi-Dadeldhura\nRapti Integrated Road Project\nPathaliya-Dhalkebar\n\nSource of \nFunds\nADB\nADB\nADB\nADB\nADB\nADB\nADB\nChina\nChina\nChina\nChina\nChina\nGermany\nGermany\nIndia\nIndia\nIndia\nIndia\nIndia\nIndia\nJapan\nSwitzerland\nSwitzerland\nSwitzerland\nUK\nUK\nUK\nUK\nUK\nUK\nUK\nUK\nUNDP\nUNDP\nUSA\nUSA\nUSA\nUSA\nUSSR\nWB/UK/UNDP/ \nSwitzerland\n\nWB\nWB\n\nLoan/ \nGrant\nLoan\nLoan\nLoan\nLoan\nLoan\nLoan\nLoan\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nGrant\nLoan/ \nGrant\n\nLength \n(km)/No\n\n(Expected) \nCompletion\n1981\n1995\n1995\n1995\n1997\n2001\n2007\n1974\n1982\n1994\n1974\n2006\n2001\n1998\n1956\n1963\n1972\n1974\n1985\n1993\n2009\n1984\n2001\n2005\n1984\n1997\n1997\n2001\n2007\n2007\n2007\n1975\n2001\n2001\n1967\n1967\n1979\n1986\n1972\n\n78\n116\n67\n198\n686\n269\n410\n174\n61\n71\n27\n16\n17\n11\n114\n68\n181\n258\n236\n204\n158\n110\n96\n26\n55\n23\n100\n49\n94\n27\n69\n115\n42\n16\n78\n71\n135\n201\n109\n\nRoad Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project\nMultimodal Transit and Trade Facilitation \nProject\nLoan\nRoad Maintenance and Development Project Loan\n\n1,111\n\n1999\n\n1,083\n\n2003\n2004\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, UK = United Kingdom, UNDP = United Nations Development Programme,\nUSA = United States of America, WB = World Bank.\nSource: Ministry of Physical and Public Works, Nepal.\n\n\f \n\n                       Appendix 4           \n\n29\n\nDETAILED PROJECT COST ESTIMATE\n($,000)\n\nForeign\n\nTotal\nExchange Currency  Cost\n\nLocal\n\nADB Financing Government\nFinancingd\nFX\nLC\n\nLC\n\nItem\n\nA.

The improved road sections and trade facilitation will \nreduce vehicle operating costs (VOCs) and travel time, which will stimulate economic growth in \nthe  project  area.  Cost-benefit  analysis  was  conducted  for  each  subproject  and  for  the  overall \nproject.  The  Bhairawa  and  Birganj  road  subprojects  were  evaluated  on  the  basis  of  estimated \nsavings in transport costs using the highway design and maintenance model (HDM4), modified \nfor Nepal. The two other subprojects\u2014customs improvement using ASYCUDA installation, and \nroad ICD development at Kakarbita\u2014were evaluated on the basis of savings in costs of cross-\nborder goods movement. \n \nBhairawa-Butwal  Section.  The  Bhairawa-Butwal  road  section  is  part  of  Sidthartha \n2. \nHighway  (Bhairawa-Butwal-Palpa-Pokhara).  This  section  was  rehabilitated  as  a  two-lane  road \nwith DBST in 1998\u20131999. Within the last 20 years, many industries were established along the \nroad corridor, resulting in continuous ribbon development throughout the road\u2019s length. Market \ncenters such as Anchalapur, Manglapur, and Shankernagar are already developed, with all the \nurban facilities (telephone, electricity, tap water) and local public transport such as microbuses \nand  local  buses.  The  travel  distance  from  Bhairawa-Butwal-Bhumahi  is  about  41  kilometers \n(km). The Project road\u2014Bhairawa-Parasi-Bhumahi (about 29 km)\u2014will shorten it by about 29%.  \n \n3. \nBirganj-Pathlaiya  (East-West  Highway).  The  Birganj-Pathlaiya  section  of  Tribhuvan \nHighway  was  one  of  Nepal\u2019s  first  road  projects,  during  late  1950s.  Pavement  works  with  two-\nlane  asphalt  concrete  pavement  were  reconstructed  or  rehabilitated  during  1995\u20131998. \nBetween  Birganj  and  Pathlaiya  are  three  markets\u2014Simara,  Jeetpur,  and  Parawanipur.  Some \nsections  of  the  Tribhuvan  Highway,  particularly  the  market  areas  and  the  municipal  limits  of \nBirganj, are congested due to local mixed traffic, reducing vehicle speeds. In the \u201dwithout  case\u201d, \ntraffic  will  continue  to  grow  until  design  levels  are  exceeded  in  about  3  years,  and  level  of \nservice  will  begin  to  decline  (i.e.,  traffic  will  slow  down  and  delays  increase)  and  alternative \nroutes and traffic management evolve to handle the congestion.  \n \nB. \n \n\nTraffic Demand \n\n1. \n\nExisting Traffic \n\n \n4. \nCurrent traffic volumes on the project roads and the transit point were determined from \ntraffic  counts  in  April,  May,  and  June  2004,  which  were  normalized  with  a  seasonal  factor  to \nestimate  annual  average  daily  traffic,  especially  considering  monsoon  impacts.  The  level  of \ntraffic was further adjusted to take into account political uncertainty. Table A9.1 summarizes the \nresultant  traffic  level  used  for  the  analysis,  considering  these  risks,  which  is  regarded  as  the \nworst-case scenario. The sensitivity tests will consider additional impacts. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40\n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nTable A9.1: Traffic on the Project Roads and the Transit Points in 2004 \n\nRoad  \n\nMT \n\nNMT \n\nBhairawa Road \n\nBhairawa-Bhumahi Section \n\nBhairawa-Butwal Section \n\nButwal-Bhumahi Section \nBirganj Road \n\nJeetpur-Padam Rd JCT \n\nPadam Rd JCT-ICD \nKakarbita \n\n951 \n\n3,178 \n\n2,160 \n\n3,447 \n\n1,112 \n\n2,476 \n\n4,224 \n\n1,269 \n\n2,869 \n\n2,037 \n\nKakarbita ICD \n1,885 \nICD = inland clearance depot; JCT = junction; MT = motorized traffic;  \nNMT = nonmotorized traffic. \nSource: Consultant\u2019s estimates. \n\n1,811 \n\n2. \n\nTraffic Growth \n\n \nThe annual GDP growth rate of 5% is adopted  for  the  economic  assessment,  which  is \n5. \nconsistent  with  current  World  Bank  and  ADB  projections  for  GDP  growth  rates  for  Nepal, \nassuming that the security situation is brought under control. \n \nEmpirical  evidence  shows  that  transport  demand  tends  to  expand  more  quickly  than \n6. \neconomic  growth,  as  measured  by  national  and  regional  GDPs.  This  relationship  is  called \ntransport demand elasticity. In Nepal, previous studies by ADB and the World Bank have used \nan elasticity of demand for transport of 1.6 on average, which is used as a starting point for the \nanalysis. \n \n7. \nTable A9.2 summarizes the traffic growth rates. For a long-term projection (2020\u20132028), \nelasticity  is  assumed  to  decrease  to  1.2  from  1.6.  For  nonmotorized  traffic  (NMT),  the  growth \nrate  is  assumed  to  be  lower  than  the  rate  of  motorized  traffic  (MT),  considering  that  a  modal \nshift will occur from NMT to MT due to economic development. \n \n\nTable A9.2:  Traffic Growth Rates \n\nGDP \nGrowth Rate \n(%) \n5 \n5 \n\nMT \nElasticity \n \n1.6 \n1.2 \n\nMT \nGrowth Rate \n(%) \n8 \n6 \n\nNMT \nGrowth Ratea \n(%) \n6 \n5 \n\nYear \n2004\u20132019 \n2020\u20132028 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product; MT = motorized traffic; NMT = nonmotorized traffic. \na Assuming about 20% lower than MT growth rate. \nSource: Consultant\u2019s estimates. \n\n \n8. \nThe  average  traffic  growth  rate  per  annum  between  1995  and  2004  recorded  by  the \nDOR indicates that the rates for Bhairawa (14.0%) and Birganj (12.2%) are considerably higher \nthan 8.0% assumed in Table A9.2, which is considered as a conservative estimate.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix  9 \n\n \n41\n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nDiverted and Generated Traffic \n\n \n \n \n9. \nand generated traffic was estimated as follows.  \n\n \na.  \n\nBhairawa Road Subcomponent   \n\nBased on the origin-destination (OD) survey conducted in June 2004, the rate of diverted \n\n \nImprovement  of  the  Bhairawa-Bhumahi  (BB)  section  will  result  in  more  traffic  diverted \n10. \nfrom  the  Bhairawa-Butwal-Bhumahi  (BBB)  section  as  the  subproject  route  will  be  shorter  for \nthrough-traffic and will reduce VOC and time costs. Based on the OD analysis of traffic, it was \nestimated that 30% of the traffic on the BBB section would be diverted to the BB section after \nproject  completion.  The  rate  of  about  20%1  was  assumed  for  generated  traffic  on  the  BB \nsection, which has been added to the normal and diverted traffic. \n \n\nb.  \n\nBirganj Road Subcomponent   \n\n \n11. \nConstruction  of  the  Birganj  bypass  will  attract  traffic  from  the  existing  Jeetpur-ICD \nsection.  Based  on  the  OD  survey,  it  was  estimated  that  25%  of  the  traffic  on  the  existing \nJeetpur-Birganj  section  would  be  diverted  to  the  Birganj  bypass  after  project  completion.  The \nestimate of a relatively low rate of 25% is reasonable, considering that some traffic to and from \nthe  ICD  would  still  travel  through  the  existing  road  as  it  passes  through  the  highly  built-up \nBirganj township. No generated traffic was considered for this subcomponent as improvements \nto sections at Jeetpur and ICD access are so short that little generated traffic is expected. \n \n\n4. \n\nKakarbita ICD and Transit Points for ASYCUDA Installation \n\n \n12. \nThe  five  major  border  crossings  into  India  are  Nepalganj,  Bhairawa,  Birganj,  and \nBiratnagar,  all  on  the  southern  border,  and  Kakarbita  on  the  eastern  border.  In  terms  of  trade \nvalue,2  Birganj is the most important, accounting for about 50% each of the country's trade with \nIndia  and  with  third  countries.  Bhairawa  accounts  for  16%  for  trade  with  India,  and  17%  with \nthird countries. Kakarbita accounts for 7% of trade with India and 6% with third countries, mainly \nwith Bangladesh and Bhutan. The Subregional Corridor Operational Efficiency Study3 presented \nestimates of tonnage crossing the border between Nepal and India at Birganj, which accounted \nfor a total of 0.87 million tons for exports and import cargo in 2003. A traffic survey in April and \nMay  2004  indicates  1,811  motorized  vehicles  at  the  Kakarbita  border  point.  This  economic \nassessment assumes the same traffic growth rate used for the road subprojects. \n \nC. \n \nFor road rehabilitation components, the road section will be upgraded to two DBST lanes \n13. \n7.0  meters  (m)  wide,  with  a  1.5  m  hard  shoulder  on  each  side.  Routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance are assumed to be carried out in accordance with current DOR practice and DOR \nroad plan standards. \n \n14. \nThe costs for road ICD development at Kakarbita consist of (i) upgrading the proposed \nICD, including very short access roads; (ii) customs facilities for passengers and freight; and (iii) \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001.

The economic evaluation includes the estimated costs of maintenance of \n1.5% for these facilities. \n \n15. \nFor  the  customs  improvement  with  ASYCUDA  installation  at  all  transit  points,  the \nASYCUDA  modules  are  provided  free,  but  additional  infrastructure  and  training  are  required. \nThe economic evaluation included periodic replacement of equipment every 5 years at 20% of \nthe original equipment cost. \n \nThe Project\u2019s economic costs were derived from the financial costs and include the cost \n16. \nof  construction  and  maintenance.  Economic  costs  exclude  price  contingencies,  and  taxes  and \nduties. Following studies by ADB and the World Bank, a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 \nwas used to arrive at economic costs at the world price level for non-tradeable goods. \n \nD. \n \n\nBenefits \n\n1. \n\nRoad Rehabilitation Component \n\n \n17. \nThe  main  quantifiable  benefits  of  the  investment  are  savings  in  VOCs  and  travel  time. \nVOC  savings  were  calculated  using  HDM4  for  each  vehicle  type.  The  benefits  for  generated \ntraffic are considered to be 50% of those for normal traffic, while the benefits of diverted traffic \nare  estimated  by  comparing  them  with  benefits  when  traffic  uses  existing  roads.  All  benefits \nwere converted to the tradeable goods by applying SCF of 0.9. \n \n\n2. \n\nCustoms Improvement and ICD Development Component \n\n \n18. \nFor ASYCUDA installation, the quantified economic benefits include (i) time savings for \ntruck owners and operators (45 minutes saving per goods movement); and (ii) reduced cost of \nworking  capital  for  exporters,  importers,  retailers,  etc.  (assumed  annual  interest  rate  of  12%). \nThese benefits accrue because they enable the number of cargo inspections to be reduced. \n \n19. \nFor  the  Kakarbita  ICD,  quantified  economic  benefits  (i)  reduced  losses  from  cargo \ndamage and theft (0.15% of the value, assuming 30.00% of probability of theft and damage with \naverage insurance costs of 0.50% of the value), (ii) time savings for owners of trucks and buses \n(15  minutes  saving  per  freight  and  passenger  movement),  (iii)  reduction  in  working  capital \nrequired  for  cargo  owners  (assumed  interest  rate  of  12.00%  pa),  and  (iv)  time  savings  for \ncustoms brokers and customs officers (15 minutes per transaction). \n \n20. \nincome of drivers, helpers, and passengers, for each type of vehicle.  \n \nE.  \n \n21. \nAn economic evaluation was undertaken for each subproject by comparing cases \u201cwith\u201d \nand  \u201cwithout\u201d  the  Project.  Only  quantifiable  benefits  were  considered.  Each  subproject  was \nevaluated  up  to  2028,  providing  benefit  periods  of  20  years  after  all  the  subprojects  are \nimplemented.  Residual  values  of  10%  and  20%  were  applied  in  2028  for  the  Bhairawa  and \nBirganj road subprojects, respectively. The Birganj road subproject has large residual value as it \ninvolves  more  earthworks,  which  will  have  more  economic  value  beyond  the  end  of  the \nevaluation period. For the Kakarbita ICD and ASYCUDA subcomponents, 30% and 0% residual \nvalues  were  assumed,  respectively,  based  on  the  value  of  civil  works  and  equipment \nconstructed or installed. All costs and benefits were expressed in 2004 constant prices. \n\nFor  all  subprojects,  the  value  of  timesavings  per  hour  was  estimated  on  the  basis  of \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix  9 \n\n \n43\n\nSensitivity Analysis of EIRR \n\nThe  economic  evaluation  was  on  a  network  basis \n\nfor  Bhairawa  and  Birganj \n22. \nsubcomponents to better take into account costs and benefits from the network perspective due \nto the bypass construction. For the Bhairawa subcomponent, the network considered consists of \nthree  sections  of  Bhairawa-Bhumahi,  Bhairawa-Butwal,  and  Butwal-Bhumahi.  For  the  Birganj \nsubcomponent,  the  network  considered  consists  of  five  sections  of  Jeetpur-Pawanipur, \nPawanipur-Padam  road  junction  (JCT),  Padam  road  JCT-Old  Padam  road  JCT,  Old  Padam \nroad JCT-ICD, and the bypass. \n \nThe  base  case  EIRR  results  in  32.7%,  18.1%,  15.2%,  and  46.6%,  respectively,  for \n23. \nBhairawa  road  rehabilitation,  Birganj  road  rehabilitation,  Kakarbita  ICD  development,  and \nASYCUDA installation. They demonstrate sound economic viability. \n \nF. \n \n24. \nThe sensitivity of EIRR for the overall Project was analyzed with respect to changes in \nthe cost-and-benefit streams. Seven sensitivity test cases were examined: (i) construction costs \nincreased by 25%, (ii) construction period extended by 2 years, (iii) no generated traffic, (iv) no \ntime  savings,  (v)  traffic  growth  rates  reduced  by  25%,  (vi)  total  benefits  reduced  by  25%,  and \n(vii) the combination of the cases (i) and (vi). \n \nTable  A9.3  summarized  the  results  showing  that  the  quantified  economic  benefits  are \n25. \nconsidered  robust  to  various  sensitivity  tests.  Only  for  the  Kakarbita  subcomponent,  the  EIRR \nfalls below 12% for two cases where total benefits are reduced by 25% (case [vi]) and where the \ncombination  of  benefit  reduction  and  cost  increase  occurs  (case  [vii]).  Though  the  EIRR \nbecomes less than 12% for these cases, it is not far below for case (vi), and the probability of \nthese occurring, especially case (vii), is small. Furthermore, all these figures are based on the \nconservative  estimation  of  growth  rate,  considering  risks  of  occurring  impassability  due  to \npolitical and natural causes. No impact on traffic growth induced by improved transit and trade \nagreements  being  deliberated  by  SASEC  and  SAARC  has  been  considered,  which  will \ngenerally increase traffic growth with the subregion as well as the region. Savings from accident \nreduction are not considered. \n\n \nTable A9.3: Results of Sensitivity Tests \n  \n\n \n\n \n\nEIRR (%) \n\n \n\n \n\nKakarbita  ASYCUDA \n\nBhairawa \nCase \n32.7 \nBase Case \n30.1 \n(i)    Construction Costs Increased by 25% \n(ii)   Construction Period Extended by 1 Yeara \n31.5 \n(iii)  No Generated Trafficb \n28.4 \n(iv)  No Time-Savingsc \n22.6 \n(v)   Traffic Growth Rates Reduced by 25%d \n22.5 \n28.1 \n(vi)  Total Benefits Reduced by 25% \n24.9 \n(vii)  Combination of Cases (i) and (vi) \na  The system installation will not likely take more than a year. \nb  No generated traffic was assumed for Birganj, Kakarbita, and ASYCUDA subcomponents. \nc Time savings are only benefits considered for the Kakarbita and ASYCUDA subcomponents. \nd  The case of 25% reduction of traffic growth rate is considered for Bhairawa and Birganj subcomponents to  \n   reflect the risk of toll impacts. \nSource: Consultant\u2019s estimates. \n\nBirganj \n18.1 \n16.2 \n17.9 \n\u2014 \n16.4 \n12.4 \n15.7 \n14.0 \n\n15.2 \n12.1 \n14.6 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n11.3 \n8.9 \n\n46.6 \n38.8 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n36.2 \n28.6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n44\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n\nKakarbita Inland Clearance Depot  \n\nA. \n \nFinancial analysis has been carried out for the Kakarbita Inland Clearance Depot (ICD) in \n1. \naccordance with Guidelines for the Financial Analysis and Management of Investment Projects of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  purpose  is  to  determine  whether  or  not  the  financial \nbenefits  of  establishing  an  additional  dry  port  will  exceed  the  financial  costs.  Financial  analysis \nwas  initially  carried  out  from  a  project  perspective,  assuming  that  the  Project  would  be  owner \noperated.  The  costs  and  benefits  were  based  on  the  same  assumptions  used  in  the  economic \nanalysis. Nonmotorized vehicles are excluded since nonmotorized traffic (NMT) rarely uses ICDs. \nThe project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to real terms \nby  adjusting  for  the  projected  effects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation  and  currency  fluctuation. \nTable  A10.1  shows  that  the  estimated  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  at  about  9.8%. \nThis compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), also computed on an \nafter-tax  basis,  of  1.3%  (Table  A10.2).  The  Project  is  considered  financially  viable  and \nsustainable.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  FIRR  for  the  Kakarbitta  ICD  is  robust  under \nmost conditions (Table A10.3). Balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow projections were \nprepared for the ICD, assuming it will be operated by a private operator.  \n \n\nTable A10.1: Estimated FIRR of Kakarbita ICD from Owner/Operator Scenario \n(NRs million at 2004 Constant Price) \n \n\nYear  Civil Construction \n\nPlant \n\nOperating \nExpenses \n\nRevenue \n\nCash Flow \nbefore Tax \n\nIncome Tax \n25% \n\nNet Cash \nFlow \n\n95.71 \n\n95.71 \n \n\n \n9.26 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n18.52 \n\n \n\n \n21.71 \n\n22.58 \n23.48 \n\n24.42 \n25.40 \n\n26.41 \n27.47 \n\n28.57 \n29.71 \n\n30.90 \n32.13 \n\n33.42 \n34.76 \n\n36.15 \n37.59 \n\n39.10 \n40.66 \n\n42.29 \n43.98 \n\n \n\n \n25.81 \n\n33.41 \n40.06 \n\n43.23 \n46.65 \n\n50.34 \n54.33 \n\n58.65 \n63.30 \n\n68.33 \n73.76 \n\n79.62 \n85.96 \n\n92.80 \n100.19 \n\n108.17 \n116.78 \n\n126.09 \n136.14 \n\n(95.71) \n\n(95.71) \n(10.66) \n\n10.83 \n16.58 \n\n18.81 \n21.25 \n\n23.93 \n26.87 \n\n30.08 \n33.59 \n\n37.43 \n12.11 \n\n46.20 \n51.20 \n\n56.65 \n62.59 \n\n69.07 \n76.12 \n\n83.80 \n92.16 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n2.71 \n4.14 \n\n4.70 \n5.31 \n\n5.98 \n6.72 \n\n7.52 \n8.40 \n\n9.36 \n3.03 \n\n11.55 \n12.80 \n\n14.16 \n15.65 \n\n17.27 \n19.03 \n\n20.95 \n23.04 \n\n49.24 \nFIRR \n\n(95.71) \n\n(95.71) \n(5.16) \n\n8.13 \n12.43 \n\n14.10 \n15.94 \n\n17.95 \n20.15 \n\n22.56 \n25.19 \n\n28.07 \n17.33 \n\n34.65 \n38.40 \n\n42.49 \n46.95 \n\n51.80 \n57.09 \n\n62.85 \n69.12 \n\n118.99 \n9.8% \n\n2026 \n \n\n(57.40) \n \nFIRR: financial internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and TA consultant\u2019s estimates (RETA 6139). \n\n147.00 \n \n\n45.74 \n \n\n196.97 \n \n\n \n \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n2007 \n\n2008 \n2009 \n\n2010 \n2011 \n\n2012 \n2013 \n\n2014 \n2015 \n\n2016 \n2017 \n\n2018 \n2019 \n\n2020 \n2021 \n\n2022 \n2023 \n\n2024 \n2025 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n45\n\nTable A10.2: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n\nItem \n\nA.

The ICD\u2019s sources of operating revenues are assumed to be derived from \nfees  for  entry,  loading  and  unloading,  stuffing  and  unstuffing,  container  handling,  weighing, \nparking,  and  sublease.  Each  revenue  source  is  growing  at  8%  per  annum,  except  sublease,1 \nwhich is static. Operational expenses are increasing at 4% per annum. Depreciation is 10% per \nannum  for  equipment  assets.  This  is  in  line  with  existing  ICDs\u2019  operating  experience.  Domestic \ninflation is 5%. \n \nAnalysis was carried out under the assumption that the operation and maintenance (O&M) \n3. \nof the ICD are assumed to be privatized immediately after construction. Lease fees will benefit the \nGovernment as in other dry ports in Nepal. Since the private operator will be responsible for O&M \nof the ICD assets as obligated under the lease contract, only the construction cost and lease fees \nwere considered. The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether or not the assumed lease \nprice is appropriate for the Government in terms of its debt service obligations for the ICD, and its \ntrade facilitation obligations, and balance of benefits forgone with avoided risk. The lease fees are \nestimated with reference (pro rata) to those being applied to the Bhairawa and Biratnagar ICDs, \nresulting  in  about  NRs3.8  million  per  year  for  the  first  3  years  and  then  increasing  to  about \nNRs11.5 million per year for years 7\u201310, then rising to NRs17.2 million for the remainder of the \nanalysis  period  to  reflect  that  the  second  10-year  lease  would  be  renegotiated  in  a  favorable \nbusiness climate. About three years will be needed for the business operation to move from start-\nup to a reasonable profit level, so the annual lease payment to NITDB has been assumed as less \n\n                                                 \n1 The terminal management company will sublease office space to the customs brokers and agents. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n46\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nthan the annual full charge of normal operation period for the initial three years. This assumption \nis consistent with the recent lease agreement for the Birganj ICD. The estimated FIRR under this \nscenario is about 3.9% (Table A10.4). Given that the bulk of operating risks was being passed on \nto the lessee, a lease structure similar to the other ICDs appears suitable.  \n \n\nTable A10.4: Estimated FIRR, Leasing Scenario  \n(NRs million at 2004 constant price) \n \n\nConstruction \nCost \n\nLease Income \n\nNet Income \n\nYear \n\n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n\n95.71 \n95.71 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(57.40) \n\n \n \n3.83  \n3.83  \n3.83  \n11.48  \n11.48  \n11.48  \n11.48  \n11.48  \n11.48  \n11.48  \n17.23  \n17.23  \n17.23  \n17.23  \n17.23  \n17.23  \n17.23  \n17.23  \n17.23  \n17.23  \nFIRR \n\n(95.71) \n(95.71) \n3.83 \n3.83 \n3.83 \n11.48 \n11.48 \n11.48 \n11.48 \n11.48 \n11.48 \n11.48 \n17.23 \n17.23 \n17.23 \n17.23 \n17.23 \n17.23 \n17.23 \n17.23 \n17.23 \n74.63 \n3.9% \n\n \n\n \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and TA consultant\u2019s estimates (RETA 6139). \n \n\nInland Clearance Depot Business Case \n\nB.  \n \nTwo FIRR scenarios and a 10-year forecast for the private sector to operate the ICD were \n4. \nprepared (Supplementary Appendix E, Tables 6 A and B for forecast financial statements). The \nfirst FIRR assumes an owner-operator scenario, reflecting Government policy to promote private \nsector development and participation. The reason for providing the first FIRR is to assess whether \nthe private sector will invest in ICD construction rather than just operation and maintenance. None \nof  the  existing  ICDs  have  attracted  private  sector  investment  for  construction  and  civil  works \nbecause of the highly risky political and security situation. The first FIRR of 10% is viable but not \nenough to attract the private sector as an owner-operator. The second FIRR is important in that it \nshows that the predicted lease revenues would comfortably cover the Government\u2019s debt service \nfor building the new ICD.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n47\n\nBorder Access Roads \n\nThe  financial  projections  for  the  ICD  (with  the  private  sector  as  the  operator  or  lessee) \n5. \nindicate that the lease scenario is viable and will attract the private sector to invest in plant and \nequipment  and  operate  under  lease.  The  projections  assume  an  initial  equity  injection  of  NRs. \n10.00 million to finance plant and equipment and start-up cash. The equity injection by the private \nsector  lessee  could  be  recovered  in  about  year  3  of  operations.  The  nature  of  the  ICD  lease  or \noperation  is  not  capital  intensive.  Virtually  all  revenues  are  cash  (through  brokers),  and \nreceivables and inventories are not significant. Thus, the only significant current asset would be \ncash. Current liabilities (accounts payable) are insignificant. \n \nC. \n \n6. \nThe Project includes placing tolls on two border roads. The Government practice for tolling \nis  to  meet  the  maintenance  cost,  i.e.,  from  routine  to  periodic  maintenance  (main  text,  footnote \n10), with the toll level to be set per trip of about 80\u2013100 kilometer (km), and depending on road \nconditions,  strategic  importance,  traffic  volume,  and  vehicle  types.  While  the  details  of  the  toll-\nsetting  mechanism  will  be  determined  during  project  implementation,  preliminary  financial \nanalysis has been undertaken. Traffic forecasts and maintenance costs have been calculated and \nprojected for the two roads. The toll rate will assumed to be similar to that being applied on similar \nroads  in  Nepal  (NRs0.36/km/vehicle).  On  the  basis  of  this  analysis,  Table  A9.5  shows  that  with \nthe  given  toll  rates,  the  toll  roads  will  generate  sufficient  revenue  to  cover  maintenance  costs, \nincluding periodic maintenance. The actual toll level and collection methodology will be formulated \nduring  project  implementation  to  recover  costs  up  to  and  including  periodic  maintenance  level, \nwithout  diverting  the  project  objective  to  reduce  transport  costs  for  the  traded  goods  and \nstrengthen the country\u2019s competitiveness in the trade sector.  \n \n\nTable A10.5: Test Cash Flow for Border Access Roads \n\nYear \n\nToll Revenue \n\nNet \nCash Flow \n\nPeriodic \nMaintenance \nCost \n \n \n \n \n \n8.2 \n31.6 \n \n \n \n \n \n18.6 \n71.8 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nRoutine \nMaintenance \nCost \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n\n15.9 \n17.3 \n18.8 \n20.5 \n22.3 \n16.0 \n(5.3) \n28.5 \n30.9 \n33.5 \n36.4 \n38.7 \n22.5 \n(28.1) \n46.4 \n49.3 \n52.4 \n55.6 \n59.0 \n62.7 \n\n17.7 \n19.1 \n20.6 \n22.3 \n24.1 \n26.0 \n28.1 \n30.3 \n32.7 \n35.3 \n38.2 \n40.5 \n42.9 \n45.5 \n48.2 \n51.1 \n54.2 \n57.4 \n60.8 \n64.5 \n\n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank and TA consultant\u2019s estimates.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n \n48\n\nD. \n\n \n\nFinancial Management Assessment of Department of Roads and Nepal Intermodal \nTransport and Development Board  \n\n1. \n\nDepartment of Roads (DOR)  \n\n \n7. \nThe  accounting  system  of  the  DOR  is  maintained  on  a  cash  basis,  with  expenditure \nmaintained  in  a  double-entry  accounts  system,  and  revenue  accounting  on  a  single-entry  basis. \nDOR records expenditures by budget items and revenue by item codes and reports to the Ministry \nof Physical Planning and Works (MPPW). DOR transactions are recorded on historical cost. DOR \nprepares a project annual financial statement, which incorporates various project implementation \nunits  (PIUs).  The  PIU  will  lead  in  formulating  the  budget,  obtaining  the  flow  of  accounting \ninformation for all project components, and reconciling and preliminarily auditing such information. \nThe  project  site  offices  are  required  to  submit  monthly  statements  of  expenditures  to  the  PIU \nwithin 7 days of the following month. As per Government requirement, an imprest account will be \nmaintained at Nepal Rastra Bank. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will allocate annual budgets to \nthe Project as envisaged in the annual work plan and as agreed on between the Government and \nADB. The Government will include this Project under the list of core projects, and will commit to a \ntimely  release  of  funds.  DOR  will  allocate  adequate  resources  to  the  PIU  for  the  Project,  which \nshould  include  qualified  staff,  including  financial  management  staff,  equipment  and  budget,  to \nadminister  overall  project  implementation.  Project  accounts  and  financial  statements  will  be \nprepared  in  formats  and  with  content  as  per  Government  and  ADB  requirements.  The  Auditor \nGeneral\u2019s (AGO) Office of Nepal, which is considered an independent auditor for ADB\u2019s purpose, \nwill  annually  audit  the  project  accounts  and  financial  statements.  A  project  management  report \nsystem has been set up on a project basis, to generate reports on project progress, procurement, \ninventory, and others of the system. Out of the report, a financial management system  is  being \nextended for two years to all DOR branches and offices, and will include the Project, which, once \ncompleted, will enhance DOR\u2019s and the PIU\u2019s institutional capacity in financial management with \nrespect to expenditures, accounts, inventory, cash flow, budgeting, management information, and \nfinancial control. In consideration of diversity of the nature of project components and sites, and \nprocedures  involved  between  MPPW,  MOF,  and  AGO,  unaudited  and  audited  project  accounts \nand financial statements will be submitted to ADB within six and nine months, respectively, after \nthe end of the fiscal year to which they relate.  \n \n\n2. \n\nNepal Intermodal Transport and Development Board (NITDB) \n\n \n8. \nNITDB  was  established  in  1997  to  (i)  develop,  manage,  and  promote  ICD  terminals  to \nfacilitate Nepal\u2019s exports and imports; (ii) enter into agreement with private companies selected by \ncompetitive bidding for leasing out the management and operation of ICD terminals; (iii) prescribe \ncriteria to determine the ceiling of service charges of the terminal operation;2 and (iv) conclude a \nrailway operation agreement with Indian Railways for rail movement of cargo to and from ICDs. \nThe chairperson of the Board is the Secretary, Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies, and \nthe  board  consists  of  members  from  the  public  and  private  sectors.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a \nnational priority in country \npoverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a \nnational priority in country \npoverty partnership agreement?  \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nPoverty Classification: \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Nepal: \n \nThe Government highly prioritizes improvement of the sub-regional transport network to enhance \neconomic  growth  and  reduce  poverty.  An  improved  sub-regional  transport  network  will  reduce \nthe  cost  of  imports  and  exports  between  Nepal,  and  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India  and  third \ncountries. Increased sub-regional trade and investment, will contribute to economic growth and \npoverty reduction by creating jobs and developing local, national, and international markets. \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe  Project  covers  inland  clearance  depot  (ICD)  development  in  Kakarbita;  widening  and \nimprovement  of  existing  access  roads  in  Birganj,  Bhairawa,  Parasi;  and  Jitpur  (41.4  kilometer \n[km])  connecting  the  east-west  highway.  The  access  roads  and  realignment  will  be  upgraded \nand  widened  to  two  lanes.  The  Project  covers  five  districts\u2014Bara,  Parsa,  Jhapa,  Nawalparasi, \nand  Rupandehi.  The  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  access  roads,  customs,  and \nfreight\u2013handling  facilities  to  ensure  efficient  trans-shipment  of  goods,  commodities,  and \npassenger traffic at principal border crossings in Nepal. Thus, the Project will promote pro-poor, \nbroad-based  economic  growth  by  connecting  people  to  markets  and  better  economic \nopportunities by facilitating trade links with the neighboring countries. \n \nNepal  is  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  the  world,  with  a  poverty  incidence  of  38%,  which  is \nmore  severe  in  the  rural  hills  and  mountains  than  in  urban  areas  and  the  rural  Terai. \nDemographic health indicators1 of poverty reveal that Nepal ranks 54th, just ahead of India, with \nthe highest and similar trends in maternal mortality rate, infant mortality rate and life expectancy \nat  birth.  The  poverty  deprivation \nincome \ncharacteristics,  reveals  that  the  project  districts  in  the  Terai  are  the  intermediate  to  most \ndeveloped  in  Nepal.  Social  assessment  indicates  that  the  communities  in  the  project  influence \narea2  have  living  standards  much  above  the  minimum  national  poverty  line  (NRs6,100/capita). \nHowever, as per 1999 figures,3 nearly 42% of the people in the terai still live below the poverty \nline, with the absolute number of poor people increasing sharply over the years. \n \nAlthough not designed as a poverty intervention, the Project will connect the poor and excluded \nto  market  opportunities  so  they  can  participate  competitively  in  the  national  and  global \neconomies.  The  Project  will  help  foster  strong  links  between  the  national,  regional,  and \ninternational markets, leading to a transition from a subsistence to a market\u2013oriented economy \nby  increasing  international  competition  from  India  and  other  countries  through  regional \ncooperation. \n \n\nindex,  based  on  population,  nutrition,  and \n\n                                                \n1  UNICEF. 2004.

Washington, DC: World Bank. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n51\n\nImprovement  of  cross-border  regional  trade  and  transit  facilities  accompanied  by  road \ndevelopment will lead to poverty reduction and improvement of the quality of life. It will improve \naccess  to  local,  national,  and  international  markets,  create  jobs  and  employment  opportunities \nnot only in the influence area but also in other regions within Nepal and will promote export and \nimport of agricultural and nonagricultural commodities and other items due to easier and faster \naccess from the border area and from within Nepal to the surrounding districts. Increased trade \nwill  in  return  generate  demand  for  the  growth  of  local  trade  and  enterprises  and,  hence, \nincreased employment opportunities.  \n \nBetter\u2013quality  access  roads  and  efficient  customs  systems  will  speed  up  travel  and  cargo \ntransport. Savings to the vehicle operator through the reduction in VOC will be passed on to the \nindividual  shipper  in  the  form  of  lower  freight  rates.  The  decrease  in  the  cost  of  movement  of \nfreight  will  also  reduce  the  cost  of  the  product.  Cheaper  cost  of  transport  will  benefit  people \nlooking for seasonal work during agricultural slack times.  \n \nAccess to international markets, better road conditions, and faster cargo transportation will lead \nto growth of industries, allowing them to move out of central Nepal to the border areas, creating \njobs there. Rural labor will benefit from road construction jobs during project implementation.  \n \nIncreased  trade  will  lead  to  more  resource  mobilization,  allowing  the  Government  to  allocate \ntimely funds for health, education, water supply, sanitation, rural electrification, and other basic \nservices as projected in the 10th Five-Year Plan period. These will account for as about 40% of \ntotal Government annual expenditure for FY2004/05. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n(NGOs),  and  customs  officials \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nConsultations  and  meetings  with  the  various  Project  communities  were  organized  during  the \nsocial analysis to ascertain their response to improved cross-border facilities, project needs and \ndemands, and an estimate of the communities\u2019 losses and steps to mitigate them. Focus group \ndiscussions  were  organized  during  the  social  appraisal  among  men,  women,  farmers,  traders, \nbusinessmen,  traders  and  travelers  from  across  the  border,  indigenous  people  and  ethnic \nminorities,  nongovernment  organizations \nto  ensure  a \ncomprehensive perspective on the Project and its impacts. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nAs no development activity can be gender neutral, women's participation in project design was \nensured during project preparation. A gender analysis was done to see the impact of the Project \non  women.  The  Project  is  anticipated  to  have  a  positive  impact  on  men  and  women  by \nincreasing  access  to  basic  social  services  (schools,  health  care  facilities,  and  markets)  and \ncreating  employment  opportunities.  During  project  design,  women  raised  concerns  about  the \nrisks  of  HIV/AIDS4  and  human  trafficking  in  the  sub-project  sites.  To  fully  address  these \nproblems  an  HIV/AIDS  and  human-trafficking  prevention  program  has  been  developed \n(Supplementary Appendix G), for which the project executing agency will be responsible. \n                                                \n4 human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\n\f \n52\n\nAppendix 11 \n\n   No \n\n    Yes \n\n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nThe  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  programs  will  be  implemented  on  a  basis  of  providing \nsupplementary  support  for  existing  NGO  activities  in  the  sub-project  sites  including  (i)  training \nand  awareness-raising  of  the  community  and  border  trade  and  service  providers  such  as  truck \ndrivers  and  commercial  sex  workers  (CSW)  on  the  dangers  and  preventing  of  HIV/AIDS;  (ii) \nproviding  counseling  services  and  materials \ntheir \nassistants/laborers;  (iii)  working  with  construction  companies  and  contractors  to  build  capacity \nand provide informal education on preventing HIV/AIDS, (iv) providing information on access to \ncondoms,  testing,  and  counseling  services  to  the  community  and  laborers,  (v)  orienting  and \nsensitizing  project  personnel  of  Department  of  Roads,  border  police,  custom  officers  and  local \nNGOs  on  human  trafficking;  and  (vi)  raising  public  awareness  through  the  media  and \ninformation, education and communication materials on human trafficking for target groups such \nCSWs, and vulnerable groups, especially women and children. \n \n\ntruck  drivers  and \n\nto  CSWs,  and \n\nE.

However,  they  are \nspread  over  different  settlements,  have  been \nmainstreamed  and  well  assimilated  into  the \nlocal  population,  and  live  above  the  poverty \nline.  The  project  preparatory  study  did  not \nindicate  differential  impacts,  either  positive  or \nnegative, on indigenous people. \nHuman  trafficking  and  HIV/AIDS  may  increase \ndue \nto  easier  cross\u2013border  access.

Description of the Environment \n \n\n    1.      Physical Environment \n \n\nThe project areas lie within Nepal\u2019s terai region in which they are located between 91 to \n3. \n380  meters  (m)  above  sea  level.  However,  topography  of  each  project  area  is  mostly  flat. \nRainfall in the project area varies moderately from 1,450 millimeter (mm) per year in the western \nterai  to  1,900  mm  per  year  in  the  eastern  terai.  Rainfall  occurs  during  the  monsoon  seasons \nfrom  June  to  September,  and  January  to  March,  due  to  moisture  brought  by  the  northeastern \nwind.    Temperature  reaches  44\u00baC  from  April  to  May,  and  falls  to  5\u00baC  from  November  to \nFebruary.  The  Bhairawa  project  area  has  several  small  rivers  such  as  the  Rohani,  Zharai, \nBangela,  Danda  and  Mahao,  all  of  which  are  seasonal  and  only  about  6  m  deep  on  average, \nduring dry season. Ground-water can be found at 5\u201310 m. The soil is dominated by alluvial type.  \n \n\n    2.      Ecological Environment \n\n \nThe Project will not cover ecologically sensitive areas. Most vegetation consists of home \n4. \ngardens.  No  important  species  or  fauna  live  in  the  project  area.  Domestic  animals  such  as \nbuffalos, cow, chickens and duck are common in the area.     \n \n         3.     Social and Economic Environment \n\n \n\n  \n\n5. \nMost  economic  activities  and,  therefore,  land  use,  in  almost  all  project  areas  are \nagricultural.  However,  the  Birganj  project  road  area  is  located  in  industrial  area  that  mostly \ndominated  by  the  textile  and  leather  industries.  Except  in  Kakarbita,  most  people  also  work  in \nservice  industries  such  as  hotel,  and  transport,  and  as  wage  labor,  loading  goods,  and  have \npoor sanitation facilities, and little clean water or electricity.        \n \nD. \n \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n      1.  Impact due to Project\u2019s Location \n \n\nAs  they  are  not  in  environmentally  sensitive  areas,  the  three  project  components  will \n6. \nhave  no  significant  environmental  impact.  The  Bhairawa  road  project  will  improve  the  existing \nroad.  The  Birganj  road  project  will  realign  the  existing  road  and  lengthen  by  9.5  km.  The \nKakarbhita ICD will require construction of buildings within the existing ICD area.   \n \n\n2.   Impact due to Construction and Operation of both Road Projects \n\n7. \nThe  environmental  impacts  of  construction  will  include:  (i)  disruption  of  traffic  in  the \nconstruction area, (ii) increased air pollution due to dust and other volatile chemical substances \nfrom the asphalt plant, (iii) noise and vibration, and (iv) disruption of water system due to filling \nto  increase  embankment  and  work  related  to  construction  of  bridges  and  culverts.  These \nimpacts  will  occur  only  during  construction.  However,  the  following  mitigation  measures  will \nminimize these impacts: (i) reroute traffic with clear sign; (ii) keep the optimum moisture content \nduring handling of soil, spray water to minimize dust, and maintain a safe distance between the \nasphalt  plant  and  public  facilities,  including  education  facilities;  (iii)  strictly  control  construction \nworks  that  create  noise  and  vibration,  by  prohibiting  night  work  in  residential  areas;  (iv)  pump \nout stagnant water, and provide adequate drainage system; (v) stabilize road embankment side \nslopes in the area where a high level embankment is required; and (vi) restrict construction in \nflood  areas  to  the  dry  season,  and  avoid  road  widening  near  pond\u2019s  site.  In  addition,  several \n\n\f \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n  Appendix 12 \n \n \n\n55\n\n \n\ntemporary access roads will be established to transport construction material and machinery to \nconstruct the road between Birganj and Jeetpur. As soon as possible after construction works \nare  completed,  the  contractor  will  be  required  to  rehabilitate  the  access  road  to  restore  their \npreconstruction conditions. All these mitigation requirements will be included in the contractor\u2019s \ncontracts. Clearly, all impacts are temporary and manageable.  \n \n8. \nThe other important environmental impact that will not concentrate in the road areas is \nthe  borrow  pits  excavation.  Since  construction  materials  will  not  be  gathered  from  the  project \nareas,  it  is  therefore  necessary  to  ensure  that  the  suppliers  should  be  able  to  prove  that \nconstruction  materials  are  legally  mined  and  gathered.  To  reduce  the  need  for  construction \nmaterial, excavated material from existing roads should be reused as much as possible.               \n \nThe  environmental  impact  associated  with  project  operation  is  mainly  related  to  traffic \n9. \nsafety.  Adequate  traffic  signs  and  physical  barriers  will  be  used  to  reduce  motorists\u2019  speed. \nTraffic  congestion  is  expected  to  be  reduced,  which  should  lead  to  improvement  of  air  quality \ndue to reducing air pollution associated with inefficient car combustion. \n \n\n3.     Impact Due to Construction and Operation of Inland Clearance Depot (ICD) \n\n \n10. \nThe environmental impact of construction of ICD facilities in Kakarbhita will be limited to \nICD  area.  The  impact  of  construction  is  mainly  due  to  increased  traffic  in  the  project  area  to \ntransport construction materials and equipment, and to dust and noise due to construction and \ndemolition. Before demolition, buildings should be inspected to ensure that no asbestos needs \nto  be  disposed.  Otherwise,  consultation  will  be  carried  out  with  Ministry  of  People  and \nEnvironment (MOPE) to ensure that asbestos waste will be properly handled.  \n \n11. \nOperation  impact  will  be  mainly  caused  by  the  increasing  number  of  slow-moving \nvehicles within the ICD which will increase air pollution due to low engine combustion. Special \ntraffic regulations will be implemented within the ICD, e.g., not allowing vehicles to park within \nthe  ICD  area  with  engines-on.  Trees  and  grass  will  be  planted  within  the  ICD  area.  The \nwastewater  needs  to  be  properly  treated  before  disposal  into  public  water  bodies  such  as \nstreams,  rivers,  or  irrigation  canals.  This  is  because  the  wastewater  from  ICD  will  contain \ndrainage water from mineral storage area that may store dangerous goods, and from domestic \nwastes.  The  ICD  needs  also  to  develop  simple  solid  waste  management.  Sub-power  stations \nshould use only PCBs free transformers.      \n \nE. \n \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Framework and Responsibility   \n\n \nImplementing  mitigation  measures  for  construction  of  roads  and  ICD  will  be  the \n12. \ncontractor\u2019s  responsibility.  An  environmental  engineer,  who  will  be  hired  as  part  of  the \nconsultant team to implement the Project, will help the Ministry of Public Planning and Works, \nthe executing agency (EA), and Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board (NITDB) which \nis responsible for management of the ICD after construction, prepare a contract document, so \nthat  the  bidding  documents,  bills  of  quantity,  and  other  contractual  obligations  clearly  identify \nenvironmental  responsibilities  and  describe  penalties  for  non-compliance.  The  EA  will  be \nresponsible  for  monitoring  and  supervising  the  implementation  of  all  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures  for  project  roads  and  development  of  ICD  infrastructure  facilities,  respectively.  The \nEA  and  NITDB  have  no  staff  dedicated  to  environmental  concerns,  therefore,  the  Project  will \nhelp  them  address  such  concerns  systematically.  Both  agencies  have  agreed  to  provide \n\n\f56\n\n          Appendix 12 \n\ncounterpart  staff  to  work  closely  with  the  environment  specialist  who  will  be  part  of  the \nconsultant team to implement the Project. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring and Management Plan \n\n \n13. \nThe IEE has identified the generic monitoring and management program, which will help \nmitigate  adverse  project  impacts.  The  monitoring  during  project  construction  will  focus  on \nimplementation of mitigation measures to minimize pollution (dust, and gas from hot-mix plants); \nre-use top soil; stabilize the embankment to maintain the river flow and to avoid flooding. The \nmonitoring during the project operation will focus on air quality (SPM, SO, NOX, and HC) and \nwater  quality  (pH,  TSS,  BOD,  COD,  and  oil  and  grease).  The  results  will  be  compared  to  the \nbaseline data gathered during the IEE study.  \n \n14.  \nThe Department of Road will implement the environmental monitoring and management \nplan  (EMP)  and  will  submit  an  annual  implementation  report  to  ADB  and  other  relevant \nGovernment agencies such as MOPE if necessary. The implementation report will be kept as a \nproject  document  and  disclosed  to  the  public  if  required.  NITDB  will  implement  the \nenvironmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  to  develop  ICD  infrastructure  facilities.  The \nICD  will  submit  an  annual  implementation  report  of  the  EMP  to  ADB  and  other  relevant \nagencies, including MOPE. \n  \nF. \n \n15. \nDuring  the  IEE  preparation,  several  public  consultations,  particularly  with  local \ncommunities,  were  carried  out.  Community  concerns about the Project are (i) quarrying in the \nrivers,  which  could  affect  people\u2019s  activities;  and  (ii)  inconvenient  living  conditions  due  to \nconstruction work. These concerns were considered in preparing mitigation measures and the \nEMP.  Government  agencies  consulted  during  IEE  preparation  indicated  their  support  for  the \nproject. The Project was also featured in the local newspaper to disclose information and seek \npublic opinion on the IEE study. \n          \nG. \n \n16. \nThe IEE study shows that project environmental impacts are insignificant and will mostly \noccur  during  construction.  All  impacts  can  be  mitigated,  and  the  mitigation  measures  are \nincorporated into project design and construction. There are no environmentally sensitive areas \ninvolved  in  the  Project.  Therefore,  a  full  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  to  assess \nfurther impacts for roads under this Project is not required.  \n\nPublic Consultations and Information Disclosure \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n17. \nThe Project will improve existing roads and build ICD. The overall IEE finding is that the \nProject will not cause significant environmental problems and that potential adverse impacts are \nmanageable.  However, monitoring should be continuous. \n\nH.
