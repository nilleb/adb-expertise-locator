A summary initial environmental examination is in \nAssessment  Appendix  13.  The  initial  environmental  examination  and \nenvironmental assessment and review framework are included as \nsupplementary appendixes.  \n   \nProject Description  The Project forms part of the Government of Indonesia's ongoing \nflagship  poverty  reduction  program\u2014the  National  Program  for \nCommunity  Empowerment  (PNPM  Mandiri).  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) is currently supporting PNPM Mandiri \nthrough the Rural Infrastructure Support to PNPM Mandiri  Project \n(RIS-PNPM),  which  includes  community  facilitation  and \nmobilization, and rural infrastructure support in the four provinces \nof Jambi, Lampung, Riau, and South Sumatra. The Project will \ncontinue the support for RIS-PNPM, financing two cycles of village \nplanning  and  block  grants  in  about  1,500  villages  in  215 \nkecamatans  in  four  provinces.  The  Project  will  follow  a \ncommunity-driven  development  approach  and  will  empower \ncommunities;  strengthen  their  capacity  to  prioritize,  design, \nimplement, and monitor community-based projects; and provide \nblock grants to finance community-identified needs and priorities.  \n \nRationale  Poverty is particularly high in rural areas of Indonesia, where more \nthan two-thirds of the country's poor people live. The causes of \nrural poverty include lack of access to basic services such as \nhealth,  education,  safe  water,  and  sanitation;  absence  of \neconomic opportunities; limited access to capital; and poor rural \nconnectivity and infrastructure. The rural population is vulnerable \nto external shocks and the large numbers of \"near poor\" are at \nrisk of falling back into poverty in the event of sickness, natural \ndisaster, harvest failure, rising food prices, or economic recession. \nThey also have extremely limited access to basic services (e.g., \nhealth and education), capital, and infrastructure. The incidence of \npoverty continues to be much higher in rural areas (17.4%) than in \nurban areas (10.7%). \n \n ", "ii     \n \n  The  Government  of  Indonesia  has  made  poverty  reduction  a \npriority. Its Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJM) 2004\u20132009 \nprovides strategic directions for addressing poverty and achieving \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Government has \nalso  issued  a  poverty  reduction  action  plan  in  line  with  the \nNational Poverty Reduction Strategy (SNPK), which emphasizes \nincreasing  employment  opportunities  and  accelerating  poverty \nreduction. To promote further inclusive growth, the Government \nlaunched a nationwide poverty reduction program in August 2006: \nthe  National  Program  for  Community  Empowerment  (PNPM \nMandiri).  PNPM  Mandiri  aims  to  reduce  poverty  by  promoting \ncommunity  participation  in  development  planning  and \nmanagement, and delivery of basic services to achieve the MDG \ntargets by 2015. \n \nADB's  Indonesia  country  strategy  and  program,  2006\u20132009 \nconcludes that the country's principal challenge continues to be \npoverty  reduction  and  eliminating  the  vulnerability  of  large \nsections  of  the  population.  To  meet  this  challenge,  the \nGovernment must achieve higher levels of sustainable economic \ngrowth, improve public sector management, boost development \nspending, and accelerate progress toward achieving the MDGs. \nStrengthening institutional and human capacities at all levels is \nneeded to realize the development objectives and improve social \nservice delivery. ADB's growing experience with community-based \nprojects places it in a strategic position to support the Government \nin  scaling  up  and  effectively  implementing  the  PNPM  Mandiri \nProgram. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project\u2019s  impact  is  reduced  poverty  and  improved  local \ngovernance of rural communities in the project areas, which is in \nline with the overall objective of PNPM Mandiri. The expected \noutcome is improved access to service delivery and basic rural \ninfrastructure for the poor, near poor, and women in the project \ncommunities. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The Project is estimated to cost the equivalent of $113.5 million, \nincluding taxes and duties equivalent to $0.55 million. The total \ncost includes physical and price contingencies, and interest and \nother charges during implementation. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nSource  Total    % \nAsian Development Bank  84.2    74.2 \nGovernment  21.8    19.2 \nBeneficiaries (in kind \ncontribution)  7.5    6.6 \n    113.5    100.0 \n ", "    iii \n  A loan of $84.2 million from the ordinary capital resources of ADB \nwill be provided. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  on  any \nundisbursed  amount  of  the  loan,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft project loan agreement. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Project is classified by the Government as a national project. \nTerms  The central government will provide the loan proceeds as grants \ndirectly  to  participating  communities.  In  accordance  with  the \nGovernment  Regulation  on  Financial  Management  and \nResponsibility in the Implementation of De-concentration and Co-\nadministration  (PP  No.  7/2008),  the  Project  will  be  financed \nthrough the central government budget. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  1 April 2010\u201330 September 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented as part of the PNPM Mandiri \nArrangements  program and will use that program\u2019s implementation mechanisms. \nThe project coordination and monitoring unit at the national level \nwill  be  responsible  for  the  management,  coordination,  and \nmonitoring of project activities. Provincial- and district-level project \nimplementation units will provide social and technical facilitation to \nthe communities to support them in improving village services and \ninfrastructure  through  community  development  grants.  The \nexisting  PNPM  Mandiri  Oversight  Body  will  provide  policy \ndirectives, guidance, monitoring, and managerial oversight to the \nProject.  \n \nExecuting Agency  Directorate  General  of  Human  Settlements,  Ministry  of  Public \nWorks. \n   \nProcurement  All goods and related services financed under the ADB loan will \nbe procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). \n   \nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  require  an  estimated  1,928  person-months  of \nnational consulting services. The relatively large consulting inputs \nare needed for capacity building, assistance to support the highly \ndecentralized  implementation  arrangements,  and  intensive \ninteraction  with  village  communities.  The  consultants  will  be \nselected and engaged through firms in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime  to  time)  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging national consultants. Three national consultants will be \ncontracted  as  individuals  to  manage  and  oversee  all  training \nactivities. Consulting services for management consultants and \n ", "iv     \n \n  monitoring  by  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  will  be \nprocured using a fixed budget selection method that requires the \nsubmission of a simplified technical proposal within 35 days. A \nfirm will be procured to undertake impact evaluation using quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  with  firms  submitting  a  simplified \ntechnical  proposal.  Training  consultants,  management \nconsultants, and the firm for impact evaluation will be procured \nusing advance recruitment. The terms of reference for consultants \nwill follow the format and content of terms of reference developed \nunder  Program  Nasional  Pemberdayaan  Masyarakat  (PNPM) \n(National Program for Community Empowerment) Mandiri and will \nbe acceptable to ADB. \n  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will benefit about 1.5 million rural poor in about 1,500 \nBeneficiaries  poor  and/or  isolated  villages.  It  will  target  poor  and  isolated \nvillages that lack basic services and infrastructure. The community \ninvestments  are  expected  to  reduce  time  and  costs  spent  on \nobtaining water, diminish the incidence and severity of waterborne \ndiseases, increase the availability and accessibility of education \nand health services for the rural poor and near poor, improve \naccess  to  services  and  markets,  and  provide  opportunities  to \nimprove incomes and welfare through increased employment and \nincome-earning  opportunities.  The  capacity  development  and \ncommunity  facilitation  investments  will  support  community \nempowerment,  build  social  capital,  and  improve  local  level \ngovernance, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of \nservices at the local level. The Project will include specific actions \nto promote gender equity, including innovative features such as \nseparate women's group meetings to ensure that women's needs \nare adequately reflected in village plans, and gender audits for \neach selected community investment to ensure that it reflects the \nneeds of men and women.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  main  risks  to  the  Project  include  (i)  inadequate \nimplementation capacity at the local level, (ii) elite capture and \nbenefits accruing to a few nonpoor, (iii) corruption, and (iv) low \nsustainability of the policies and investments. The project design \nincludes specific measures to mitigate or minimize such risks. \n \n \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Rural Infrastructure Support to PNPM Mandiri Project II. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  From 1970 to 1996, Indonesia successfully reduced poverty incidence from more than \n50% to less than 18%. However, the 1997\u20131998 Asian crisis unraveled the progress that had \nbeen  achieved  and  poverty  incidence  increased  to  more  than  40%  in  1998.  This  led  the \nGovernment to scale up its efforts to fight poverty, and as a result the number of poor people \ndecreased to pre-crisis levels by 2004. By 2009, poverty incidence had decreased further to \n14.2%. Despite these gains, 33 million people remain poor, poverty incidence is substantially \nhigher than the national average in many parts of the country, and nearly 50% of the country's \npopulation is categorized as \"near poor,\" living on less than $2 a day.1  \n \n3.  The Government of Indonesia has made poverty reduction a priority in its Medium-Term \nDevelopment  Plan  (RPJM),  2004\u20132009,  which  incorporates  key  elements  of  the  National \nPoverty Reduction Strategy (SNPK) and highlights the importance of achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). The RPJM targets an increase in economic growth to 7.6% and a \nreduction in \"open unemployment\"2 to 5.1% by 2009.  It also aims to halve the percentage of \nthose below the national poverty line to 8.2% by 2009, increase school enrollment rates at all \nlevels and reduce illiteracy to 5%. Other targets for the 2004\u20132009 period include an increase in \nlife expectancy from 66.2 to 70.6 years, a decline in infant mortality from 35 to 26 per 100,000 \nlive births, and a reduction in malnutrition among children under 5 from 26% to 20%. To \naccelerate poverty reduction, the Government has issued a poverty reduction action plan in line \nwith the SNPK. The action plan has five focal areas: (i) job creation and poverty reduction \nprograms;  (ii)  macroeconomic  stability  with  stable  prices,  fiscal  sustainability,  and  financial \nsector reforms; (iii) acceleration of investment, exports, and tourism through reforms aimed at \ncreating a healthy business climate and flexible markets; (iv) improved access to and quality of \neducation and health; and (v) infrastructure development and improved efficiency of public \nservices, along with expanded private sector participation.  \n \n4.  Indonesia has expanded strongly since recovering from the Asian crisis and was on \ntrack to meeting many of the RPJM targets before the current economic slowdown. Economic \ngrowth had accelerated to a 10-year high of 6.3% in 2007 and remained robust at 6.1% in 2008, \ndespite unstable global financial markets and a slowing world economy. However, economic \ngrowth decreased to 5.2% year-on-year in the final quarter of 2008 as the global slowdown cut \ninto exports and manufacturing. Subdued domestic and external demand is expected to further \ndecelerate  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  in  2009.  While  inflation  has  eased  from \ndouble-digit rates and improved macroeconomic management and a stronger financial sector \nhave enabled the country to avoid the most severe impacts of the current crisis, an overall \neconomic slowdown is expected in the short term. It is therefore likely that many of the RPJM \ntargets will not be met.  \n                                                 \n1  In purchasing power parity terms. \n2  Share of the labor force who are not working and are actively looking for work.  \n ", "2     \n \n \n5.  The current global economic recession may lead to additional strains on the poor and \nincrease the vulnerability of the near poor, as economic growth stagnates and unemployment \nand underemployment rise. Unemployment is forecast to rise above 9% as layoffs spread \ndomestically and more overseas workers lose their jobs and return home. More people will \nprobably be pushed into the informal sector\u2014which already accounts for about two-thirds of the \nlabor force\u2014where wages are low and jobs not secured. Protecting the poor and reducing the \nvulnerability of the population living on less than $2 a day will be a high priority as these groups \nare vulnerable to even small income losses. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n6.  Inequity and high levels of rural poverty. The SNPK identified the major causes of \npoverty, including lack of access to affordable quality food; lack of access to quality health \nservices;  lack  of  access  to  quality  education  services;  limited  employment  and  business \nopportunities; lack of access to housing and sanitation services; lack of access to clean water; \nand lack of participation. All these causes are related to lack of access to various forms of \ncapital and infrastructure\u2014human, physical, social, financial, and natural.  \n \n7.  Poverty is particularly high in rural areas, where the majority of the population and more \nthan two-thirds of poor people live. Poverty incidence continues to be much higher in rural areas \n(17.4%)  than  in  urban  areas  (10.7%).3 Disparities  between  and  within  regions  are  also \nsignificant. While the provinces with the highest poverty incidence rates are in the outlying \nregions of the country, the provinces in Java and Sumatra tend to have the greatest number of \npoor people. In terms of absolute numbers of poor, Java, which has 58% of the Indonesian \npopulation, accounted for 55% of the poor in 2008 (19.2 million people). Other provinces with \nvery large number of poor in 2008 were North Sumatra (1.6 million), Lampung (1.6 million), \nSouth  Sumatra  (1.2  million),  South  Sulawesi  (1.1  million),  Aceh  (1.1  million),  East  Nusa \nTenggara (1.1 million) and West Nusa Tenggara (1.1 million). These seven provinces alone \naccounted for about 25% of Indonesia\u2019s poor in 2008.4  \n \n8.  Given such disparities across areas and provinces, national figures that show solid \nprogress toward achieving the MDGs (particularly those related to poverty reduction, education, \ngender equality and child mortality) conceal gaps and an overall level of underdevelopment in \nmany  regions.  While  national  figures  show  high  levels  of  access  to  primary  education  for \nchildren aged 7 to 12, children in rural areas are 20% less likely to enrol and stay in school than \ntheir  urban  counterparts.  Indonesia's  health  challenges  are  also  great,  with  an  estimated \n582,000 new cases of tuberculosis each year, concentrated in poorer and less developed areas.   \nSignificant  challenges  in  the  health  sector  are  also  reflected  in  persistently  high  maternal \nmortality ratios: in Indonesia, there are 420 deaths per 100,000 live births, compared with 45 in \nthe People's Republic of China, 62 in Malaysia, 110 in Thailand, and 230 in the Philippines.5 \n \n9.  Limited access to service delivery and rural infrastructure. For many years before \nthe  Asian  crisis,  Indonesia  successfully  used  infrastructure  investments  to  support  poverty \nreduction  and  economic  development.  However,  the  crisis  resulted  in  the  cancellation  or \nsuspension  of  many  planned  public  and  private  infrastructure  projects.  Subsequent \n                                                 \n3  Government of Indonesia, Central Bureau of Statistics, 2008. Badan Pusat Statistik. Jakarta.  \n4  Lampung and South Sumatra are RIS-PNPM provinces.\u00a0Riau and Jambi had 527,500 and 249,700 poor people in \n2009, respectively. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n5  World Health Organization Statistical Information System (available: www.who.int/whosis).  \n ", "    3 \ngovernments had to prioritize the more urgent tasks of financial sector restructuring and fiscal \nconsolidation. As a result, infrastructure investments, which accounted for more than 6% of \nGDP before 1997, fell to a low of 2% in 2000 and have only reached 3% in recent years, \nreflecting a sharp decline in public and private spending.6 Since 1997, only basic preservation \nand maintenance of infrastructure have taken place, with minimal expansion. \n \n10.  As a result, infrastructure and service coverage remains low by regional standards. In \n1996, the overall quality of Indonesia's infrastructure exceeded that of the People's Republic of \nChina and Thailand. However, today these countries have overtaken Indonesia, which ranked \n54th in a 2007 survey of 131 countries.7 About 50 million Indonesians lack access to treated \nwater, 90 million lack access to electricity, and nearly 200 million are not connected to a \nsewerage network. While 3.5 million new customers were connected to electricity in 1997, in \nrecent  years  about  1  million  new  customers  have  been  connected  annually,  making \nachievement of the targeted 90% electrification ratio in 2020 unlikely. Indonesia has the lowest \nroad density in Southeast Asia in terms of length per area or population, and rural roads are \ndeteriorating because of inadequate maintenance. \n \n11.  The availability of infrastructure services in rural areas, particularly outside Java and \nBali, is significantly below the national average. About 54% of rural villages are not connected \nby asphalt roads and more than 15% of all villages are inaccessible even by four-wheel-drive \nvehicles at certain times of the year. Poor roads or no roads mean that government services are \ninaccessible and the high transportation cost in these communities is a major cause of poverty. \nSo is lack of water and sanitation: only 15% of rural households have access to drinking water \nfrom piped or pumped sources, and just 21% have septic tanks for disposal of human waste. \nThese low levels of access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities contribute to \nthe high incidence of waterborne diseases\u2014diarrhea is the second-largest cause of death and \nstunted  growth  among  young  children.  Access  to  quality  health  and  education  services  is \nparticularly limited in rural and remote areas.    \n \n12.  The four project provinces of Jambi, Lampung, Riau and South Sumatra have high rural \npoverty and unequal access to infrastructure. The provinces contained a total of almost 4 million \npoor people in 2009. South Sumatra (16%) and Lampung (20%) had poverty incidence well \nabove the national average. Fewer than 60% of households have access to safe water supply. \nSouth  Sumatra  (53%)  and  Lampung  (54%)  have  low  school  enrollment  rates  for  upper \nsecondary school and Riau (9.35%) and South Sumatra (8.45%) have higher than national \naverage unemployment rates. Profiles of the project provinces are in Supplementary Appendix \nA.  \n \n13.  Decentralization.  To  improve  service  delivery  and  local  development,  Indonesia \nembarked on a radical and rapid decentralization program in 2001, transferring much of the \nresponsibility for delivery of public services to the local level and almost doubling districts' share \nin government spending. An intergovernmental fiscal framework, using block grants,8 replaced a \nsystem of largely earmarked grants.

The goal was to make \ngovernments more responsive and accountable to the people and to increase transparency. \nDecentralization brought increased resources to local governments, including rights to collect \ntaxes and to draw revenues from natural resource exploitation. At the same time, they were \nassigned key functions and responsibilities for financing and delivery of services, including \nhealth, education, public works, environment, communications, agriculture, capital investments, \nland, cooperatives, and infrastructure services. In 2001, 2.3 million civil servants and more than \n20,000 government properties were transferred from central to local governments to enable \nlocal governments to carry out decentralized functions. As a result, local governments currently \nmanage about 30% of total government expenditures.   \n \n14.  Despite early problems, there have been significant gains from the decentralization \nprocess. Provincial, district and municipal governments are becoming more responsive to the \nneeds of local communities and open public debates have begun to flourish.11 However, while in \ntheory the new regulations should make local planning processes more efficient, effective, and \nresponsive by integrating community aspirations with national, regional and sectoral policies \nand plans, in reality the capacity of district governments to provide equitable and accessible \nservices remains limited. Other issues include inadequate consideration of local aspirations and \nneeds in planning processes, especially of poor people; limited synergy between programs in \ndifferent  sectors;  and  a  disproportionately  high  proportion  of  regional  budgets  allocated  to \nadministrative rather than development activities.  \n \n15.  The  Indonesia  country  gender  assessment  (2006) 12  found  that  decentralization \nrepresented both challenges and opportunities for women. In general, women's representation \nin  public  decision-making  remains  limited  and  in  some  areas  decentralization  has  been \naccompanied  by  a  revival  of  conservative  religious  interpretations  of  gender  roles  and \ndiscriminatory local customary laws. However, some local governments have begun to view \nwomen as important stakeholders, actively creating programs to promote women's rights. In \nsome cases, the devolution of budget processes to local government institutions has led to \nopportunities for greater involvement by citizens, including women, resulting in more gender-\nresponsive and pro-poor budgets. More women are now holding government positions; in the \n2006 elections, six regions elected women as the regional head, and 11 elected women as the \ndeputy regional head.13  \n \n16.  Capacity development for local governments so they can assume their responsibilities \nremains one of the key challenges of decentralization. The problem is most evident at the \ndistrict and municipal levels. Local communities themselves also require capacity development, \nas  they  tend  to  lack  information  about  development  plans,  budget  allocations,  and  their \nentitlements to social services. For example, a 2004 governance and decentralization survey 14 \nundertaken in 32 districts of eight provinces revealed that three-quarters of poor respondents \nwere unaware that there were channels for expressing concerns regarding service delivery. \nDespite this, service delivery was generally thought to have improved since decentralization. \nNearly two thirds of respondents identified improvements in public health services and 60% \nnoted improvements in public education.  \n                                                 \n11  World Bank and Gajah Mada University, 2004.

Community-driven  development  (CDD)  and  government  strategy  for  poverty \nreduction. CDD was introduced in Indonesia in 1998, in the midst of the Asian crisis and \npolitical upheaval that brought down the Suharto administration and broke down service delivery \nmechanisms. Previously, development processes were largely driven by appointed officials and \nthe central government. These processes tended to exclude participation, particularly by the \npoor, in setting development priorities, and provided limited accountability for the performance \nof  responsible  authorities.  Many  poverty-reduction  programs  proved  unstable  and \nunsustainable. Among the reasons for failure were lack of sufficient attention in the programs' \ndesign to the needs of the poor and the lack of local demand and ownership, resulting in service \ndelivery that often missed its intended targets. CDD was introduced as an alternative approach \nthat sought to institutionalize Indonesia's rich legacy of self-help, community mobilization and \nresource pooling for grassroots socioeconomic development.  \n \n18.  The CDD approach gives communities control over planning decisions and investment \nresources to improve service delivery. The communities control the resources, and funds are \ntransferred directly to them, usually to community-managed bank accounts. The community also \nmanages project implementation, and generally goes through at least three project cycles, each \nconsisting of social preparation, planning, project development, implementation, and operations \nand maintenance. The process is designed to systematically mobilize local people so they can \nprioritize  their  development  needs,  design  activities,  seek  technical  assistance,  manage \nresources,  and  implement  and  sustain  development  actions.  This  organized  and  repeated \nexperience in collective action will enable poor villagers to help themselves and to engage local \ngovernments and national agencies. In the longer term, it is expected that villagers will take a \nmore active role in improving the delivery of other pro-poor services (Appendix 2).  \n \n19.  Encouraged by the success of CDD programs and following more than a decade of \nimplementation experience, the Government formally adopted CDD for the Program Nasional \nPemberdayaan  Masyarakat  (PNPM)  Mandiri, 15  a  nationwide  poverty  reduction  program \nlaunched in August 2006. PNPM Mandiri makes a commitment to expand coverage of CDD to \nall 6,408 kecamatans by the end of 2009, and aims to reduce poverty by promoting community \nparticipation in development planning and management, and to deliver basic services and \ninfrastructure using the CDD approach. While some of the earlier CDD interventions bypassed \nlocal governments, PNPM Mandiri seeks to use the CDD approach both to improve local service \ndelivery  and  to  promote  local  governance  through  bottom-up  and  pro-poor  planning, \ncomplementing and furthering the decentralization process (Supplementary Appendix B).  \n \n20.  PNPM  Mandiri  consists  of  PNPM  Core  (PNPM  Inti)  and  PNPM  Support  (PNPM \nPenguatan). PNPM Core consists of five major CDD and empowerment programs,16 while \nPNPM Support consists of the sectoral program activities of technical ministries that provide \nsupport to poor communities. The PNPM Mandiri will remain a national program at least until \n2015. Following scaling-up of the program to nation-wide coverage in 2009, the program will \nmove into a sustaining mode in 2010, under which additional cycles for kecamatans and villages \nwill be provided. Each kecamatan will be eligible to receive at least three cycles of community \nplanning  and  block  grants.  Local  governments  will  take  on  greater  responsibility  for \nimplementation than in previous CDD projects. The Government also expects to increasingly \n                                                 \n15 The National Program for Community Empowerment \n16 These include RIS-PNPM (ADB), KDP (World Bank), Urban Poverty Program (World Bank), Support for Poor and \nDisadvantaged Areas (World Bank), and Regional Infrastructure for Social and Economic Development Project \n(JBIC).  \n ", "6     \n \nbring supply-side initiatives from health, education, rural development, and other sectors under \nthe PNPM umbrella to maximize complementarities for poverty reduction.  \n \n21.  PNPM Mandiri has expanded rapidly over the past 3 years. It covered 2,361 kecamatans \nin 2007 and 4,768 in 2008. In 2009, it is being implemented in 33 provinces, 465 districts, and \n6,408 kecamatans, at a total cost of about $1.5 billion. The Government is expected to provide \nalmost 50% of the funding requirement from its own resources.17 The current ADB-supported \nRural Infrastructure Support to PNPM-Mandiri Project (RIS-PNPM)18 covers about 4% of the \ntotal cost of PNPM-Mandiri in 2009, and the Project will cover about 7.5% of the total costs in \n2010 and 2011.   \n \n22.  Indonesian agencies have years of experience of implementing CDD approaches. The \nNational Planning Development Agency (BAPPENAS) is responsible for development planning \nand coordination of poverty reduction programs and policies, and is considered the champion of \nCDD. The Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) have been the main \nexecuting agencies of CDD projects. These agencies remain key partners in the PNPM Mandiri \nOversight Body, which was created to provide policy directives, guidance, and managerial \noversight to the program. It is chaired by the coordinating minister for People's Welfare (Menko \nKesra) and its members include the state ministers of BAPPENAS and less developed regions; \nand  the  ministers  of  finance,  home  affairs,  public  works,  and  social  development.  At  the \nprovincial and district levels, there are multiagency steering committees, chaired by provincial \ngovernors and district heads and with similar coordinating and monitoring functions to those of \nthe  Oversight  Body.  They  comprise  the  heads  of  the  relevant  sector  agencies  and \nrepresentatives from local organizations. \n \n23.  ADB  sector  objectives  and  strategy. ADB's country strategy and program (CSP), \n2006\u20132009 aims to help the Government achieve higher levels of pro-poor sustainable growth \nand achieving the MDGs, as specified in its medium-term RPJM objectives. A major anticipated \noutcome of the CSP is the provision of basic infrastructure and support services to communities. \nThe Project is included as a firm project in the 2009 Indonesia country program.19  \n \n24.  Given its long experience with community-based projects in Indonesia, ADB is in a good \nstrategic position to support the Government in scaling up and effectively implementing PNPM \nMandiri. ADB also has significant experience of local governance and has worked with the \nGovernment in planning and budgeting reforms that benefit the poor. Further, ADB's institutional \nknowledge of addressing both demand and supply sides of citizen engagement and service \ndelivery  will  help  strengthen  and  refine  the  PNPM  Mandiri  design  as  the  program  is  fully \ninstitutionalized. \n \n25.  Currently, ADB is supporting the Government's PNPM program through the RIS-PNPM, \napproved in September 2008. The RIS-PNPM includes support for community facilitation and \nmobilization, and block grants for rural infrastructure improvement in about 300 kecamatans and \n                                                 \n17 In 2009, four development agencies will provide loan support to PNPM Mandiri: the World Bank, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank, Islamic Development Bank, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation. The loans from \ndevelopment partners will finance different geographical areas and periods of PNPM Mandiri implementation. Apart \nfrom loans, bilateral donors had provided grant support to the PNPM Support Facility (PSF) in the amount of $63.2 \nmillion by the end of March 2009. PSF support is mainly for technical assistance such as capacity building, studies, \nand monitoring and evaluation.  \n18 ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n19 Memorandum of understanding between the Government of Indonesia and ADB for the 2009 country program \nconfirmation mission, signed in Jakarta on 22 April 2009. \n ", "    7 \n1,700 villages in the four provinces of Jambi, Lampung, Riau, and South Sumatra. While the \nPNPM  Mandiri  design  involves  three  cycles  of  village  planning  and  block  grants  in  each \nparticipating kecamatan, the RIS-PNPM covers only one round of facilitation and village block \ngrants. In addition, the investment choices for communities do not cover the full PNPM-Mandiri \nmenu but are limited to rehabilitation or construction of physical infrastructure.  \n \n26.  To support the implementation of the required additional cycles for villages in the RIS-\nPNPM kecamatans, the Government has asked ADB to support the RIS-PNPM to cover two \nadditional cycles of community facilitation and block grants. This will allow for full completion of \nthree cycles in the RIS-PNPM villages. In addition, it has asked that the Project adopt the full set \nof PNPM Mandiri guidelines, including its open menu for community investments. By adopting \nPNPM Mandiri's design, funding modality, and implementation structure, the Project will be fully \nconsistent with the Government's development program. This will ensure strong ownership and \ngreatly improve the prospects of achieving the common goals of improving service delivery, \nreducing poverty, and meeting MDG targets.  \n \n27.  ADB  and  other  external  assistance  to  community-driven  development.  CDD \nprojects have become the foremost instrument for poverty reduction, local capacity building, and \nservice delivery in Indonesia. ADB has funded several projects with CDD features. Between \n2001 and 2007, 11 out of 23 ADB loans to Indonesia had CDD features, corresponding to 21% \nof the total loan amount. These projects included (i) Rural Infrastructure Support Project,20 \nwhich rehabilitated and improved rural infrastructure in 1,840 villages in 45 districts in East \nJava,  East  Nusa  Tenggara,  South  East  Sulawesi,  and  South  Sulawesi  provinces;  (ii)  the \nCommunity  Water  Services  and  Health  Project,21 which  provides  rural  water  supply  and \nsanitation to 1,000 communities in 20 districts and aims to improve district government capacity \nto  deliver  basic  water  and  sanitation  services,  strengthen  communities  to  take  primary \nresponsibility for such services, extend water and sanitation facilities to communities through a \ndemand-driven approach, and increase communities' awareness of health and hygiene; (iii) the \nCommunity and Local Government Support Sector Development Program,22 which improved \naccess of poor communities in 79 districts to basic and small public infrastructure using CDD \napproaches and improved local governments' capacity to manage CDD; and (iv) the Community \nEmpowerment  for  Rural  Development  Project,23 which  supported  capacity  building  of  local \ngovernment  staff  and  villagers,  and  financed  a  development  planning  process  for  local \ndevelopment needs. The assistance has supported the Government to provide infrastructure \nsupport, strengthen rural water and sanitation services and irrigation systems, upgrade slum \nneighborhoods, improve the income generation of the rural poor, and build social capital. \n \n28.  The World-Bank-funded Kecamatan Development Project (KDP)24 started in 1998 and \nwas the first CDD project in Indonesia. A total of $1.4 billion of loan, grant and Government \nfunds has been disbursed for three phases of the KDP. Other previous projects following the \nCDD  approach  include  the  World  Bank-supported  Urban  Poverty  Project 25  and  Village \n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2005.

The World Bank is providing the largest funding \nsupport to PNPM Mandiri and is a key partner of the Government, together with ADB, the \nIslamic Development Bank, and the Government of Japan.  \n \n29.  In  December  2007,  a  PNPM  Support  Facility  (PSF)  was  established  with  financial \ncontributions from the Government of the Netherlands, the Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment,  AusAID,  Danish  International  Development  Assistance,  DANIDA,  and  the \nDepartment for International Development of the United Kingdom, DFID. PSF is a trust fund \nchaired  by  the  Government  through  BAPPENAS  and  managed  by  the  World  Bank.  The \nobjective of PSF is to support the Government to provide effective leadership and management \nof PNPM Mandiri, including (i) better coordination across grants and among donors supporting \nthe program; (ii) stronger capacity at all levels to plan, manage and improve poverty reduction \nprograms; (iii) reduced poverty through government and civil society partnerships; and (iv) \nstudies,  assessments,  and  better  monitoring  and  evaluation.  More  information  on  external \nassistance to the sector is in Appendix 3.  \n \n30.  Lessons learned. There is substantial evidence that CDD can be more effective in \nservice delivery than other approaches. Independent evaluations of the KDP\u2014the largest CDD \noperation in the world\u2014indicate an average economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of more \nthan 50%, well above that for other non-CDD rural infrastructure projects implemented in similar \ngeographic areas of the country. Infrastructure built under CDD projects cost about 40% less \nthan similar works built through other procurement methods, while meeting quality standards.27 \nEvidence also indicates that CDD is likely to offer better cost recovery and operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of completed infrastructure facilities and services because of community \nmembers' strong sense of ownership. CDD also provides better accountability and transparency \nin decision making and procurement. Evidence from the RISP and other CDD projects shows \nthat the direct funds flow mechanism to communities has demonstrably reduced corruption and \nleakage. CDD improves poverty targeting and presents more opportunities for women and the \npoor  to  participate  effectively  in  community  and  local  governance  processes.  World  Bank \nreports indicate that more than 50% of the participants in village decision-making meetings are \npoor and 30\u201345% are women. About 70% of employment opportunities under CDD are provided \nto poor people.   \n \n31.  The Government's PNPM Mandiri design was formulated with assistance from its major \ndevelopment partners, and incorporates lessons from all recent CDD projects and programs in \nIndonesia. After more than a decade of experience, the key lessons for good project design and \nimplementation include (i) community control of decision-making over resources and investment \nchoices;  (ii)  adoption  of  a  block  grant  approach  and  simple  and  transparent  funds  flow \narrangements  with  direct  transfers  to  community  accounts;  (iii)  comprehensive  facilitation \nsupport  in  community  planning  and  preparation,  including  social  facilitators  to  provide \ninformation, promote participation, and train villagers, and engineering facilitators to oversee \ntechnical quality and help ensure that the design of civil works is appropriate and the quality is \nhigh;  (iv)  stronger  accountability  procedures,  such  as  public  disclosure  of  budgets  and \ncontracts;  (v)  village  management  of  funds  (including  bookkeeping),  procurement,  and \ntransparency  measures;  and  (vi)  training  for  communities  in  establishing  effective  O&M \n                                                 \n26 World Bank. 1995. Village Infrastructure Project. Washington, D.C. \n27 ADB\u2019s RISP demonstrated cost savings of 33%\u201350% compared with similar contractor-executed projects. This is \npartly because of transparency measures in decision-making and resource allocation and the use of participatory \nprocesses that reduced corruption. \n ", "    9 \nmechanisms. Consistent with the Government thrust to have a single strategy for community \nempowerment  and  poverty  reduction,  approaches,  guidelines  and  procedures  have  been \nharmonized and PNPM Mandiri is supported by a common monitoring and evaluation (M&E) \nframework,  grievance  redress  system,  management  information  system  (MIS)  and  training \npackages. Building on years of successful implementation of CDD in Indonesia, the design of \nthe Project has incorporated the above lessons and has adopted the common guidelines and \nprocedures. \n \n32.  The  ongoing  RIS-PNPM  has  made  a  good  start  and  project  implementation \narrangements are in place in the participating provinces and districts. Socialization activities \npresenting the project scope and its procedures have been undertaken, and facilitation for \ncommunity  planning  is  ongoing.  The  design  and  guidelines  emphasize  community \nempowerment and the importance of community facilitation. However, providing a thorough \nunderstanding  of  these  project  principles  to  provincial  and  district  staff,  consultants,  and \ncommunity facilitators has been challenging. There is a need to strengthen project sensitization \nat all levels, and to ensure adherence to the core principles of community empowerment. The \nProject will (i) include mechanisms to strengthen project sensitization; (ii) clearly describe the \nrequired  steps  for  each  cycle  of  facilitation,  planning,  and  block  grant  investments;  \n(iii) undertake performance monitoring of provinces, districts, and villages; and (iv) introduce \nperformance reviews, and rewards and sanctions for provinces, districts and villages based on \ntheir performance. \n \n33.  Lessons from RIS-PNPM indicate that a stronger process for selection and training of \ncommunity  facilitation  is  needed.  This  will  be  addressed  through  more  detailed  terms  of \nreference for community facilitators, a prolonged and more detailed training program, regular \nmeetings  between  community  facilitators  from  different  districts  to  share  experience  and \nlessons, and prioritization of local facilitators in the recruitment process. In addition, facilitators \nwill now receive transportation allowances. Furthermore, while many CDD programs used to \nbypass local governments to promote community empowerment and grassroots development, \nrecent experience shows that local government involvement needs to increase. The Project \nrecognizes this, and will provide capacity building for local governments through training in key \nroles  related  to  project  implementation,  bottom-up  planning  and  pro-poor  budgeting,  and \nsupport to communities for O&M. Finally, ensuring equal participation and benefits to women \nremains a challenge. The Project will promote gender equity and ensure that women will be \nrepresented  in  community  organizations,  will  have  access  to  planning  and  budgeting \nopportunities, and will be key project stakeholders and beneficiaries. The above lessons have \nall been incorporated into the project design and are further described in each of the project \noutputs.   \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n34.  The impact of the Project will be reduced poverty and improved local governance in \nPNPM Mandiri areas. This is consistent with the overall objective of the PNPM Mandiri program. \nThe expected outcome of the Project is improved access to service delivery and basic rural \ninfrastructure for the poor, near poor and women in the project communities. The Project will \noperate in four provinces and support villages located in 36 kabupatens (districts) and 215 \nkecamatans (subdistricts).  \n \n ", "10    \n \n35.  Selection of project kecamatans and villages. The Project will be implemented in the \nfour provinces of Jambi, Lampung, Riau and South Sumatra, all located in the southern half of \nSumatra. The PNPM Mandiri Oversight Body issues annual lists of the target kabupatens and \nkecamatans for each project included under the PNPM Mandiri program. The Project has been \nallocated 215 kecamatans for 2010 and 2011. Of these, 181 will continue coverage started \nunder RIS-PNPM, while 34 will be new.28 The 1,101 RIS-PNPM 2009 villages, which were \nselected from a list of the poorest villages in the country, will be eligible for inclusion in the \nProject  based  on  their  satisfactory  performance  in  RIS-PNPM.  In  the  newly  added  34 \nkecamatans, villages will be selected based on poverty incidence ranking using the latest \navailable data.29 In total, about 1,500 villages in 215 kecamatans will be targeted for two cycles \nof community facilitation and block grants. The concerned provincial and district governments \nwill confirm to MPW that the poorest villages are selected and that no better-off villages are \nincluded. \n \nB.   Outputs \n \n36.  The Project will have the following outputs: (i) strengthened capacity for community \nplanning and development, (ii) improved village services and infrastructure through community \ndevelopment grants, and (iii) improved capacity for project implementation and monitoring and \nevaluation.  \n \n37.  Output 1: Strengthened capacity for community planning and development. The \nProject will support and strengthen community participation, empowerment and capacity to \nprioritize,  design,  implement,  manage  and  monitor  community-based  projects.  Social \nmobilization and community facilitation are cross-cutting activities that will occur at all stages of \nthe  community  empowerment  process  and  are  key  for ensuring  pro-poor  investments  and \nsustainability. Assistance will be provided to conduct community mobilization and facilitation at \nthe village level and to identify problems, needs, and opportunities for local development and  \npoverty  reduction.  Capacity  building  will  also  be  extended  to  community  implementing \norganizations (CIOs) and communities to formulate village plans and related annual investment \nplans  for  funding  through  block  grants,  in  project  procurement  and  construction  activities, \nconduct  of  transparency  and  accountability  activities,  progress  and  financial  reporting, \nmonitoring, physical and financial audits, and O&M planning.   \n \n38.  Following the PNPM Mandiri guidelines, the Project will deploy facilitators to provide \nassistance and build the capacity of villagers. Community facilitators will be organized in teams, \neach consisting of five facilitators (two for social development, two for technical matters, and \none for overall project management) and covering up to seven villages. At least 30% of the \ncommunity facilitators will be women. With the assistance of these facilitators, villages will:30  \n(i) receive information about the Project and the PNPM Mandiri program; (ii) conduct village \n                                                 \n28 The 34 kecamatans will be added to correct for previous mistargeting that left some poor kecamatans uncovered. \nAll eligible kecamatans and villages allocated to the Project will thus be covered.  \n29 Village Potential Statistics/Potensial Desa (PODES) and Social Protection Program Survey/Pendataan Program \nPerlindungan Sosial (PPLS).  \n30 While the full facilitation and planning process that was undertaken in RIS-PNPM will not be repeated for villages in \nthe second cycle, the results of the first cycle planning process, e.g., poverty mapping, priority problems, and \nMTPR\u2013will be reviewed in the selection of priority investments for project funding. Socialization will be repeated to \nintroduce or reintroduce RIS-PNPM approaches to the village, and to state or restate its objectives and emphasize \nhow its participatory approach is different from those of other infrastructure assistance programs.     \n ", "    11 \nsurveys and poverty mapping;31 (iii) identify problems, needs and opportunities; (iv) assess \ncommunity implementation capacity and gaps; (v) develop planning mechanisms and decision-\nmaking  processes;  (vi)  formulate  village  medium-term  poverty  reduction  (MTPR)  plans;  \n(vii)  select  priority  investments  and  develop  corresponding  community  project  proposals, \nincluding O&M plans with corresponding costing and budgets; (viii) implement the selected \ninvestments with block grant support and technical guidance; and (ix) implement O&M plans to \nensure the sustainability of the completed community investments. The DGHS will execute a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  with  each  participating  village,  specifying  the \nresponsibilities of the village and the Project (Supplementary Appendix C).32 The MOU will \nstipulate critical performance standards, such as support of the village government, commitment \nof counterpart contributions, participation rates at village meetings (including targets for 40% \nwomen participation and 50% of the poor), and anticorruption measures and other requirements \nfor the approval of proposals. Once the preconditions are met and the proposal is approved, the \nvillage and the district project implementation unit (DPIU) will enter into a contract reflecting the \nspecific arrangements and detailing the roles and responsibilities of each party. \n \n39.  Each participating village will work with the project through a CIO, which can either be an \nexisting village organization (formal or informal) or a new project organization, as decided by the \nlocal village community through participatory meetings in the village. The CIO will comprise five \nmembers elected or reconfirmed by the community, at least two of whom will be women. The \nCIO will be approved by the village head and registered with the district satker,33 which is a \nprerequisite for opening a CIO bank account. All decisions made by the CIO will be validated in \nparticipatory village meetings with at least 50% household attendance, including at least 50% of \npoor households.  \n     \n40.  This output will also support activities to strengthen local government capacity. This \nsupports the current PNPM Mandiri strategy of enabling local governments to adopt the CDD \napproach,  including  key  functions  and  implementation  roles,  for  delivering  services  to \ncommunities once they have developed adequate capacity and experience with the program.  \nBuilding on lessons from an ADB-financed TA on Pro-poor Planning and Budgeting34, the \nProject will provide significant capacity strengthening to prepare local governments for this task \nand to promote the sustainability of project gains. Particular attention will be given to local \ngovernment  units  involved  in  project  implementation,  including  the  provincial  and  district \nsteering  committees  and  the  provincial  project  implementation  units  (PPIUs)  and  DPIUs. \nCapacity  building  will  include  bottom-up  planning  and  pro-poor  budgeting,  particularly \nintegration of village plans into district plans and budgets, M&E, and financial management. This \nwill be delivered through orientation and workshops, short training courses on specific functions, \nand information and communication materials. The Project will include a partnership agreement \nto  be  signed  between  DGHS  and  district  governments, 35  immediately  following  project \norientation,  outlining  the  responsibilities  and  rights  of  the  districts  under  the  Project.  The \npartnership agreement is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n                                                 \n31  The objective of poverty mapping is to ensure the inclusion of women, indigenous peoples and other vulnerable \nand marginalized groups within the village. Community organizers will receive special training on the inclusion of all \ndisadvantaged community groups in empowerment and facilitation processes. \n32  The MOU and contract will be signed by the village head, the chiefs of all hamlets, and the CIO representing the \nvillage; and by the district satker representing the Government. The MOU signing will take place in the first village \nmeeting when the CIO is established, while the contract will be signed once the village proposal is approved. \n33  District working unit of MPW. \n34  ADB. 2005.

Output  2:  Improved  village  services  and  infrastructure  through  community \ndevelopment grants. Block grants will be provided to villages to support investments in priority \nphysical, social and economic infrastructure to meet the local needs that were identified in the \nvillage MTPR plans. Consistent with the PNPM Mandiri guidelines, the menu of investment \nopportunities for communities will be open except for a short negative list of activities prohibited \nby the Government or ADB policies.36 The selection of community investments will be based on \nthe guidelines prepared for the RIS-PNPM. As in the ongoing RIS-PNPM project, the block \ngrants will be transferred directly to community bank accounts specifically opened for the project \nand managed by the CIOs. \n \n42.  The Project will allocate two cycles of Rp250 million each37 (approximately $25,000) for \neach participating village through block grants for about 1,500 villages in 215 kecamatans. \nDuring each cycle, each village, based on its MTPR plan, will prioritize investments within this \ngiven budget envelope and choose whether to finance one large investment or two or more \nsmaller investments. Experience from PNPM Mandiri shows that the most common community \ninvestments  include  feeder  roads  and  bridges,  water  supply,  sanitation,  electrification,  and \nirrigation.38  \n \n43.  The CIO will take the lead in developing village investment plans, with assistance from \ncommunity facilitators and the DPIUs. The investment plans of all participating villages will be \nreviewed  by  the  DPIU  to  identify  possibilities  for  intervillage  collaboration  and/or  the \ndevelopment of intervillage infrastructure. After the village investment plans have been reviewed \n(and possibly revised), the final designs and costs will be discussed and approved at a village \nassembly and submitted to the DPIU. Upon approval, a contract will be executed between the \nCIO and the DPIU and the first installment of the block grant will be released.  \n \n44.  For a village proposal to be approved by the DPIU, it will have to fulfill the following \ncriteria: (i) be a pro-poor investment that was endorsed in a community-wide meeting and that \nhas  significant  benefits  for  the  poor,  women,  and  minority  groups;  (ii)  have  potential  for \nimmediate utilization by the poor or near poor; (iii) have identified availability of land, with no or \nminimal negative environmental, social, or economic impacts;39 (iv) have evaluated alternative \ndesigns and established the cost-effectiveness of the proposed design; (v) be executed by \ncommunities to the extent possible, using local labor and materials, and technology that is \nsimple  and  appropriate  to  local  conditions;  (vi)  have  allocated  reasonable  time  for \nconstruction;40 and (vii) include a realistic and affordable O&M plan. Participation targets will be \nconfirmed and gender audits undertaken by the PPIU during the verification process before \nsigning of the block-grant contract between the district and the CIO. \n \n45.  Project activities will be undertaken by communities, largely through manual labor and \nusing locally available and environmentally safe materials, with technical guidance from the \ncommunity facilitators, DPIUs, and project management consultants. When goods or services \ncannot be provided by a community, such as tasks requiring specialized expertise, this should \n                                                 \n36 Activities that can be supported include (i) building and repairing basic infrastructure such as small roads, bridges, \nirrigation infrastructure, clean water supply systems and sanitation; (ii) equipping or repairing social infrastructure \nsuch as school buildings, clinics, and providing supplies to school children and health clinics; and (iii) social and \neconomic activities. The negative list will be detailed in the project administration manual.   \n37 For a total of Rp500 million per village. \n38 To date, about 80% of PNPM Mandiri funds have been used for physical infrastructure and about 20% for \neconomic and social activities.  \n39 Screening for environment and land acquisition and resettlement will be undertaken for each investment. \n40 The preferred duration for construction is 3 months. \n ", "    13 \nbe  confirmed  in  a  community  meeting  and  procurement  should  be conducted  through  the \ncommunity  procurement  committee  established  under  the  Project.  O&M  will  be  fully \nimplemented and partly financed by the communities, with district governments supporting O&M \nactivities that are beyond the technical capacity of the communities. The Project will target that \n30% of employment opportunities from construction and O&M will be provided to women.  \n \n46.  The Project will utilize the same funds flow mechanism for block grants as in the ongoing \nRIS-PNPM. The first installment of 40% of the approved block grant will be transferred directly \ninto  the  CIO\u2019s  bank  account  as  an  advance  payment.  The  remaining  funds,  subject  to \ncertification of progress by the DPIUs, will be disbursed to the community in two additional \ninstallments: 40% at the 36% completion point of the village works, and 20% at the 72% \ncompletion point. District governments will be required to provide counterpart contributions from \ntheir own budgetary resources\u2014amounting to 5% of the total value of block grants provided to \nthe participating villages within their jurisdiction\u2014to cover the incremental operating costs of the \nDPIU and the costs of socialization of the project to participating villages.  \n \n47.  Output  3:  Improved  capacity  for  project  implementation  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation. This output supports project management and implementation support at national, \nprovincial, and district levels, including M&E. There are three levels of project management\u2014a \nnational project coordination and monitoring unit (PCMU), PPIUs, and DPIUs. Following the \nPNPM Mandiri system, each level is assisted by a team of consultants providing technical, \nmanagement  and  capacity  development  support  in  project  planning,  management  and \ncoordination; establishment and operation of a grievance redress mechanism at all levels; \npreparation  of  feasibility  studies  and  procurement  packages;  design  and  construction \nsupervision;  contract  management;  financial  management  and  accounting;  and  training, \ninstitutional and human resources development. This output will also include capacity building \nfor M&E and encourage nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to participate in monitoring and \nevaluating  the  Project,  both  as  members  of  provincial  and  district  steering  and  oversight \ncommittees and as contractors hired to conduct independent monitoring. \n \nC.   Special Features  \n \n48.  Support  for  the  Government's  ongoing  program.  The  Project  will  support  and \nenhance implementation of the Government's national PNPM Mandiri program by providing \nadditional resources necessary to expand the program's coverage and improve its management \nand implementation, based on directions developed by the PNPM Oversight Body. By building \nupon  and  directly  supporting  the  Government  program  and  investments  in  design  and \nimplementation of the PNPM Mandiri, the Project will be able to achieve ownership, greater \nsustainability, and more efficient resource use, and to avoid duplications.  \n \n49.  Enhanced  targeting  of  poor  villages.  The  Project  will  strengthen  the  targeting \nmechanisms  for  village  selection  to  ensure  that  only  the  poorest  villages  in  each  project \nkecamatan are included. To ensure that selection is fair and transparent, newly available village \nstatistics  from  200841 will  be  used  to  verify  the  village  lists  issued  nationally.  In  addition, \nprovincial and district governments will review and confirm the selection.  \n \n50.  Stronger focus on gender. Ensuring that women participate on an equal basis and \nreceive equal benefits remains a challenge for PNPM Mandiri. The Project will include specific \nactions to promote gender equity, including innovative features such as separate women's \n                                                 \n41 PODES and PPLS.  \n ", "14    \n \ngroup meetings to ensure that women's needs are adequately reflected in village plans, and \ncompletion of gender audits for each selected community investment to ensure that they reflect \nthe needs of both men and women.  \n \n51.  Capacity building for local governments. Local governments were using bottom-up \napproaches to implement community-based projects even before CDD was introduced in the \n1990s. The decentralization law further enhanced the authority of local governments, giving \nthem  resources  for  matching  grants  for  community-based  projects  and  for  augmenting \ncommunity block grants. However, in the past, many CDD programs have bypassed local \ngovernments. While this has often been a necessary starting point to promote community \nempowerment and grassroots development, community and local government interface should \nnow be promoted. The Project recognizes this, and will provide capacity building for local \ngovernments  and  for  better  community  and  local  government  interaction.  The  Project  will \ninclude a detailed partnership agreement between the district government and the executing \nagency  (DGHS)  that  clearly  outlines  the  roles,  responsibilities,  and  rights  of  the  local \ngovernments under the Project. It will also provide capacity building to support performance of \nthese  roles  during  and  after  the  Project.  This  will  be  done  through  training  in  project \nimplementation, bottom-up planning and pro-poor budgeting, and support to communities for \nO&M. These activities will prepare local governments to absorb key functions after 2015 and will \ntherefore be an important contribution to the PNPM Mandiri Program. A capacity assessment of \nthe executing agency and local governments is in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n52.  Good governance and anticorruption measures. Indonesia is ranked 126 out of 180 \ncountries in Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception\u2019s Index. Corruption remains a \nchallenge  in  many  projects.42 The  most  recent  country  assistance  program  evaluation43 \nrecommended that governance be mainstreamed in ADB operations of this type by involving \nlocal governments and communities in project planning, implementation, and monitoring. This \nhas been achieved through the CDD approach, with the communities participating at all stages \nof implementation. The Project will further promote good governance through (i) transparent, \nconsistent,  and  cost-effective  planning  and  implementation  based  on  common  procedures, \nguidelines, and institutional arrangements; (ii) well-defined procedures and mechanisms for \ntransferring investment funds to CIO-managed bank accounts; and (iii) comprehensive M&E \nthat allows for an independent assessment of the village investment outputs compared to the \nproject targets. A summary of governance risks and mitigation measures is in Appendix 4.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n53.  The project investment cost is estimated at $113.5 million, including taxes and duties of \n$0.55 million to be financed by the Government. The project cost includes physical and price \ncontingencies and financial charges. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 5.  \n                                                 \n42 Transparency International. 2008. Annual Report 2008. Berlin. \n43 ADB. 2006.

Implementation Arrangements  \n \n55.  Project management. The Project will use the existing implementation arrangements \nfor RIS-PNPM, with the MPW through its Directorate General of Human Settlements (DGHS) as \nthe executing agency. At the central level, the PCMU has been established within the DGHS to \nprovide overall management of the Project. The PCMU has overall responsibility for the Project \nincluding (i) developing and updating project implementation guidelines; (ii) creating awareness, \nunderstanding and support for the project within the agency and with related ministries, project \nstakeholders, and public interest groups; (iii) building partnerships with project stakeholders, in \nparticular provincial and district governments; (iv) coordinating activities in accordance with \nproject  guidelines;  (v)  leading  the  planning  and  programming,  coordination,  oversight,  and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  project;  (vi)  leading  and  coordinating  activities  related  to \nfinancial  management  and  financial  audit;  (vii)  developing  and  implementing  the  capacity \nbuilding  program  and  training  for  project  staff  and  stakeholders;  (viii)  establishing  and \noperationalizing  the  project's  complaints  and  grievances  mechanism;  (ix)  recruiting  and \nproviding direction to the national and regional management consultants; and (x) reporting \nperiodically on the progress of implementation, the resolution status of all grievances lodged \nunder the Project, and any allegations of misuse of funds or corruption, to the director-general of \nhuman settlements and the PNPM Mandiri Oversight Body. The project implementation and \norganization chart is in Appendix 6 and the detailed project implementation arrangements are in \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n \n56.  The Project will use the PIUs established by MPW at the provincial, and district levels \nunder  RIS-PNPM.  At  the  provincial  level,  the  PPIUs  have  been  established  and  will  \n(i) implement, monitor and evaluate the project; (ii) conduct socialization about the project \namong its staff, members of the provincial coordinating team, and local interest groups; (iii) \nprovide input for village level project site selection; (iv) coordinate with local stakeholders; (v) \nrecruit community facilitators; (vi) assist the PCMU in implementing capacity building programs \nfor  project  staff,  community  facilitators,  villagers  and  other  stakeholders;  (vii)  coordinate \nmonitoring and reporting activities; (viii) manage the handling of complaints and grievances at \nthe provincial level; (ix) perform financial programming and management at the provincial level; \n(x) prepare physical and financial progress reports at the provincial level, based on the physical \nand financial progress reports of the districts, and submit these to the PCMU; and (xi) provide \nregular reports on the progress of implementation, the resolution status of all grievances lodged \nunder the Project, and any allegations of misuse of funds or corruption  to the provincial \ncommittee.  \n57.  At the district level, the DPIUs will (i) coordinate and organize project activities within the \ndistrict; (ii) conduct socialization activities among staff and in project areas, and ensure that \npolicies and targets on women's equality and pro-poor are disseminated to the project villages;  \n(iii) facilitate implementation of project activities in the project areas; (iv) assist in the formation \nof CIOs; (v) assist the CIOs to coordinate the village leadership and synchronize planning \nprocesses to produce common MTPR plans for the project-related activities and for the village; \n(vi) provide technical assistance to formulate MTPR plans; (vii) oversee physical implementation \nof  the  community  investments  and  monitor  CIO  fund  applications  and  disbursements;  \n(viii) supervise the O&M of the completed village level projects; (ix) provide support to and \nmonitor the outputs of the community facilitators and consultants; (x) help villages to lobby for \nintegration of the MTPR into district development plans and help the CIO to access resources \nfor projects identified in the MTPR that cannot be funded by the Project; (xi) ensure openness \nand  ready  availability  of  information  on  all  aspects  of  the  implementation  of  the  Project;  \n(xii) maintain technical data and accounting records; (xiii) coordinate and monitor reporting at \n ", "    17 \nthe village level; (xiv) conduct investigations of complaints from the community and submit a \nreport to the PPIU within 10 days of receipt of any complaint, even if the investigation is \nongoing; (xv) prepare financial and physical progress reports based on reports collected from \nthe CIOs and submit these to the PCMU through the PPIU; (xvi) report the results of all activities \nto the district committee on a regular basis; and (xvii) conduct performance evaluations of \ncommunity facilitators every 3 months and submit them to the PPIU for review and further action \nsuch as additional training, if required. \n \n58.  At  the  community  level,  the  CIOs  will  (i)  conduct  social  and  poverty  mapping  and \ncommunity meetings, with at least 50% participation by poor people and 40% participation by \nwomen  in  decision-making;  (ii)  identify  poverty  reduction  constraints  and  social  and \ninfrastructure constraints in the village; (iii) prepare a village investment proposal based on the \nMTPR plan; (iv) subject to receipt of the notice of approval of the village proposal, open a bank \naccount and entering into a contract for works with the DPIU; (v) implement the approved village \nproject funded activities; (vi) monitor construction works and reporting progress to the DPIU \nusing the project performance management system (PPMS); (vii) prepare invoices and manage \nthe cash management system; (viii) hold weekly meetings with the community and providing \ncopies of daily records on village information boards to report physical and financial progress; \nand (ix) maintain a complaints and grievance recording system and investigate allegations, and \nreport regularly to the PPIU on grievances and findings. Each CIO will establish a management \nteam  for  construction  and  O&M.  The  management  team  will  supervise  infrastructure \nconstruction  activities  and  related  management  programs  (including  O&M).  Community \nfacilitators will assist the CIO, the management team and other village organizers to plan, \nselect, design, and implement the project related activities. \n \n59.  Project  consultants.  Consultants  will  provide  technical,  management  and  capacity \ndevelopment support to the PCMU, PPIUs, DPIUs, and facilitators during implementation. This \nsupport will cover project planning, management and coordination; preparation of feasibility \nstudies and procurement packages; design and construction supervision; contract negotiations \nand  management;  financial  management  and  accounting;  and  institutional  and  human \nresources development and training. \n \n60.  Implementation period. The Project will be implemented over a period of 3 years, \nbeginning in April 2010 and ending in March 2013. The project implementation schedule is in \nAppendix 7. \n \n61.  Procurement.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Civil \nworks for village investments will be contracted out to the communities based on an agreement \nbetween  a  CIO  and  a  DPIU,  and  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  for  community \nparticipation  in  procurement  as  specified  in  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Community \ncontracts, to be based on the format of the community contracts under the overall PNPM \nMandiri, will include evidence of community facilitation, the design of facilities to be constructed \nunder  the  contract,  a  community  O&M  plan  for  these  facilities,  and  clear  duties  and \nresponsibilities of both parties for the project activities. The first two community contracts in \neach participating province will be submitted to ADB for prior approval. All contracts will be \nmonitored under the management information system. The procurement plan is in Appendix 8. \n \n62.  Consulting services. The Project will require an estimated 1,928 person-months of \nnational consulting services at national, provincial, and district levels. To strengthen training, \nparticularly  for  community  facilitators,  a  training  design  and  management  team  will  be \n ", "18    \n \nresponsible for developing and managing the project training program. In addition, a national \nteam  of  management  consultants  will  assist  the  PCMU  and  three  regional  teams  of \nmanagement consultants will cover the following provinces: (i) Lampung, (ii) South Sumatra, \nand  (iii)  Jambi  and  Riau.  Each  regional  team  will  consist  of  (i)  team  leader  and  project \nmanagement specialist, (ii) rural infrastructure specialist, (iii) financial management specialist, \n(iv) social development specialist, (v) gender specialist, (vi) safeguards specialist (vii) training \nmanager, and (viii) training specialists. Each regional team will also have district teams with a \nsimilar composition to the provincial team; each district team will cover about four districts. The \nconsultants  will  assist  the  central,  provincial,  and  district  governments  in  (i)  overseeing \ncommunity  facilitators  in  empowering  communities  and  ensuring  participation  in  project \nimplementation,  (ii)  providing  technical  and  managerial  support  to  the  PCMU  and  PIUs,  \n(iii)  establishing  and  implementing  a  sound  financial  management  and  monitoring  system,  \n(iv) implementing the complaints-handling mechanism, (v) implementing the PPMS, which is a \npart of the M&E framework for the PNPM Mandiri, and (vi) undertaking training of community \nfacilitators and local governments. A firm will be contracted to undertake the project impact \nevaluation, and NGOs will be contracted to undertake external monitoring of project processes.  \n \n63.  All consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  national  training  design  and \nmanagement team will consist of three consultants to be contracted as individuals. The firm for \nimpact evaluation will be contracted through quality- and cost-based selection using simplified  \ntechnical proposal. The management consultants will be recruited through national firms. The \nfixed budget selection method, which requires submitting a simplified technical proposal within \n35  days,  will  be  used  to  select  the  management  consultants  and  the  NGOs  for  external \nmonitoring.  The  fixed  budget  selection  method  is  justified  to  ensure  recruitment  of  highly \ncompetent consulting firms with the required mix of specialties, the demand for which has \nincreased  considerably  because  of  PNPM  Mandiri.  The  terms  of  reference  of  project \nmanagement consultants will follow the format and contents of those developed under PNPM \nMandiri. The outline terms of references of consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix \nG.  \n \n64.  The PPIUs will recruit community facilitators to provide about 26,000 person-months of \nservices. The community facilitators will be recruited as individuals. As they will be financed by \ncounterpart funds, Government procedures will be followed.44  \n65.  Advance recruitment of consulting services. DGHS may use advance recruitment  of \nconsulting services for management consultants, trainers, and impact evaluation. DGHS may \npost advertisement and receive expressions of interest and may draft a short list of consultants, \nrequest proposals, and evaluate them.  It may start contract negotiations with the selected firm \nas soon as the Project is approved by the Board.  The existing PCMU has the capacity to \nundertake recruitment, as demonstrated under the ongoing RIS-PNPM. It has been explained to \nthe Government that ADB\u2019s support of advance contracting does not commit ADB to approve \nthe loan project or to finance the recruitment costs.  \n \n66.  Anticorruption policy. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the Government and DGHS. ADB will require the Borrower to \ninstitute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best \npractice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the \n                                                 \n44 The selection process is described in the capacity assessment for community facilitators in Supplementary \nAppendix H.  \n ", "    19 \nfinancing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding \ndocuments for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the \nProject shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of the DGHS and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey relate to the Project. Village-level contracts between CIOs and DPIUs will also include \nrelevant anticorruption provisions. Any allegations of corruption will be reported to and reviewed \nby the PNPM Mandiri Oversight Body. \n \n67.  The  Project  will  incorporate  the  following  good  governance  features:  (i)  advanced \nsocialization of the overall project objectives so communities understand the process of funds \ndisbursement;  (ii)  transparent,  consistent,  and  cost-effective  subproject  planning  and \nimplementation  through  well-defined  procedures,  guidelines  and  institutional  arrangements, \nincluding  community  signboards  with  summaries  of  plans,  progress  reports,  and  financial \nrecords,  and  a  project  website;  (iii)  well-defined  procedures  and  mechanisms  to  transfer \ninvestment funds to community-managed bank accounts; and (iv) comprehensive monitoring \nand evaluation. The existing financial management systems and fiduciary controls under PNPM \nMandiri, which have been developed with assistance from international development agencies, \nare sound and have adequate checks and balances to minimize corruption risks. DGHS will \nfurther strengthen the project complaints and problem management unit, which was established \nunder RIS-PNPM, to (i) review and address grievances of project stakeholders in relation to the \nProject, any of the service providers, or any person responsible for carrying out the Project; and \n(ii) set threshold criteria and procedures for handling such grievances, responding to them, and \nnotifying stakeholders. The complaints handling unit will carry out its functions in coordination \nwith the PNPM Mandiri complaints and problems management unit and in accordance with \nPNPM Mandiri\u2019s Implementation Guidelines on Management of Complaints and Grievances \n(Supplementary Appendix I).   \n \n68.  Disbursement  arrangements.  The  Project  is  classified  by  the  Government  as  a \nnational project, which means the central government will provide the loan proceeds directly to \nparticipating  communities.  In  accordance  with  the  Government  Regulation  on  Financial \nManagement  and  Responsibility  in  the  Implementation  of  De-concentration  and  Co-\nadministration (PP No. 7/2008), the Project will be financed through the central Government \nbudget.  \n \n69.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The Project will adopt the same funds flow \nmechanism as in the ongoing RIS-PNPM which involves direct transfer of funds for block grants \nfrom the project imprest account to the CIO bank account. This will ensure that the village \ncommunities receive the funds directly with minimal delay and no leaks. Two cycles of block \ngrants of Rp250 million will be provided to each of approximately 1,500 villages to finance their \npriorities as identified in their MTPR plans. The first installment of 40% of the approved block \ngrant will be transferred directly into the CIO\u2019s bank account as an advance payment. The \nremaining funds, subject to certification of progress by the DPIUs, will be disbursed to the \ncommunity in two additional installments: 40% at the 36% completion point of the village works, \n ", "20    \n \nand 20% at the 72% completion point.45 The Project will use direct payments and imprest \naccount procedures.  \n \n70.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The imprest account will be established \nand administered by the Ministry of Finance.46 Project expenditures during the first 6 months of \nimplementation, consisting of the first tranche of community grants in all villages, are estimated \nat about $17 million. Considering the imprest ceiling of $18 million for the ongoing RIS-PNPM47 \nand the Project\u2019s utilization of implementation arrangements already in place for the PNPM \nMandiri, the imprest ceiling is considered justified. The maximum amount to be deposited into \nthe imprest account will not exceed $17 million or 6 months estimated expenditures to be \nfinanced through the imprest account, whichever is lower. Liquidation will be carried out under \nthe  statement  of  expenditure  procedure,  for  which  the  limit  will  be  $50,000  per  individual \npayment.  \n \n71.  Sufficient supporting documentation, as defined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, \nwill be kept at each level of project management to substantiate all expenditures incurred from \nthe loan proceeds. Concerned DGHS and regional government staff will be trained in ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement procedures. Financial due diligence undertaken during project preparation found \nthat DGHS has significant financial management experience and capacity, and will be able to \nensure  effective  and  appropriate  project  financial  management.  The  Project\u2019s  funds  flow \nmechanism and detailed disbursement procedures are in Appendix 9. \n \n72.  Accounting,  auditing,  and  reporting.  DGHS,  the  PPIUs,  the  DPIUs,  and  local \ngovernments involved in project implementation will prepare and maintain separate records and \naccounts  for  the  Project.  They  will  register  all  receipts  and  payments  for  the  Project  in \naccordance with sound accounting principles and procedures. The CIOs will maintain accounts \nin the format specified by the project guidelines, and their books and records will be open to the \npublic. The summary of expenditures will be posted on a signboard in each participating village. \nAnnual project accounts will be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB, and will \nbe based on sound and acceptable accounting principles. Audited project accounts, audited \nfinancial statements, and the audit opinion will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the end \nof the financial year and at project completion. A separate audit opinion on the use of the \nimprest account and statement of expenditure procedures will be included in the annual audit \nreport.  A  formal  warning  will  be  issued  for  accounts  more  than  6  months  overdue,  and \ndisbursements  will  be  suspended  for  accounts  that  are  12  months  overdue.  The  financial \nstatements and the auditor\u2019s report will be in English. In case of any specific complaints, DGHS \nwill contract an independent auditor, using project funds, to audit the accounts at the community \nlevel and at other relevant implementation levels. \n \n73.  Project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  Project  will  continue  and \nstrengthen  the  PPMS  that  was  established  under  RIS-PNPM.  Specific  elements  include  \n(i)  conduct  of  baseline  and  completion  surveys  for  individual  villages  by  trained  staff  and \ncommunity  facilitators;  (ii)  participatory  monitoring  by  communities  based  on  self-defined \nindicators; (iii) internal monitoring of inputs, process, and outputs; (iv) independent external \nmonitoring and evaluation by third parties, such as civil society groups; and (v) the design and \nimplementation of a high-quality impact evaluation.  \n                                                 \n45 See paras. 42\u201347 for more details on block grant administration.  \n46 Bank charges will be financed out of the ADB loan.  \n47 The ongoing RIS-PNPM covers about 1,700 villages.  \n ", "    21 \n74.  The Project will mobilize local NGOs or other civil society organizations in each of the \nfour project provinces to undertake independent monitoring. Particular emphasis will be given to \nassessing participation by and benefits accruing to very poor and remote households, women, \nand  other  marginalized  groups.  Locally  deployed  NGOs  will  also  be  trained  to  work  with \nvillagers to enhance community-level participatory M&E.  \n \n75.  The Project will contract an independent firm to conduct an external impact evaluation. \nThe  evaluation  will  assess  the  impact  of  project  interventions  on  poverty,  gender, \nempowerment,  governance  and  socioeconomic  conditions  in  target  villages.  Regression \ndiscontinuity and other econometric tools will be used to compare changes in project and control \nvillages from pre-project baseline data. The impact evaluation will be the first application of this \nmethodology to assess CDD programs in Indonesia and will complement existing evidence and \ncontribute to increased knowledge for the institutionalization of the PNPM Mandiri. The impact \nevaluation will be conducted in close dialogue with agencies such as BAPPENAS, Menko \nKesra, and the World Bank.   \n \n76.  Consistent  with  PNPM  Mandiri\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Implementation  of  Monitoring  and \nEvaluation  (Supplementary  Appendix  J),  the  Project\u2019s  M&E  will  encompass  the  following \nelements:  (i)  monitoring  physical  and  financial  progress  and  the  efficiency  of  village \ninvestments; (ii) monitoring the level and adequacy of village and stakeholder participation in \nplanning and implementing project activities; (iii) monitoring the capacity of CIOs and local \ngovernments; (iv) collecting gender disaggregated data on stakeholders' participation in training \nand planning, and the accrual of benefits, including employment generation; (v) monitoring \nsocial, environmental, and economic impacts, including establishment of baseline data; (vi) \nconduct of physical and financial audits; and (vii) assessing the impact and utilization of the \ninvestments. The M&E framework for PNPM Mandiri has built upon the last 8 years of M&E \nwork on CDD in Indonesia and similar programs in other parts of the world. The framework has \nemployed  quantitative  and  qualitative  methodologies,  as  well  as  a  mix  of  internal  and \noutsourced evaluations. The M&E guidelines describe the responsibilities of all stakeholders \n(including central and local governments, community facilitators, consultants, CIOs, and NGOs) \nin carrying out M&E, and require a mixture of strong supervision and quality checks through \ninternal project channels and external M&E.  \n \n77.  The  PPMS  will  follow  the  PNPM  Mandiri\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Implementation  of  MIS \n(Supplementary Appendix K) and will be part of the program management information system \n(MIS). The MIS for the Project will form part of the integrated MIS for PNPM Mandiri, which is \nmanaged by the data and information center of BAPPENAS. The PNPM Mandiri\u2019s MIS includes \nvalidation and verification processes to ensure the quality of data and information. Inputs from \nsector program systems are submitted to the national level and data are updated monthly. M&E \nfindings are updated on the PNPM Mandiri website on the 15th of every month, and will be \nincorporated in quarterly project progress reports that the PCMU will prepare within 1 month of \nthe end of the reporting period. It will submit these to ADB and the PNPM Mandiri Oversight \nBody. The PCMU will also prepare and submit a consolidated project completion report to ADB \nwithin 6 months of project completion.  \n \n78.  Project review. MPW and ADB will carry out joint project reviews at least twice a year, \nincluding midterm and project completion reviews. The reviews will assess project impacts, \nparticularly the institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, and social \naspects.  The  reviews  will  also  examine  compliance  with  covenants  specified  in  the  Loan \nAgreement.  MPW  and  ADB  will  conduct  a  midterm  review  after  2  years  of  project \n ", "22    \n \nimplementation. MPW and the district governments will make sure that their staff visit the field \nfrequently and join ADB for all project review missions. \n \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts  \n \n79.  Economic  and  financial  benefits.  Village-level  interventions  will  be  identified  by \nvillagers  through  a  participatory  CDD  process.  It  is  therefore  not  possible  to  conduct \nconventional ex ante economic and financial analysis of project benefits. However, impact \nanalyses of previous CDD projects in Indonesia have demonstrated that they have a major \nimpact on short-term employment generation and that CDD is highly cost-effective in improving \ncommunity  infrastructure  and  access  to  basic  services.  Previous  projects  have  used  local \nmanual labor intensively and it has typically accounted for 30\u201350% of civil works costs. The \nProject is expected to generate at least 290,000 person-months (more than 24,000 person-\nyears) of short-term employment in the construction of village investments. Overall, PNPM \nMandiri is expected to generate employment for 24 million people and to increase their incomes \nby 10%\u201315%.48 As this employment is largely provided in the agricultural off-season, it has \nparticular benefits for reducing unemployment and vulnerability among the poor.  \n \n80.  The Project is also expected to have significant impacts on village economies. Similar \ntypes of investments have been shown to yield an average economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) of 28%\u201368%. Economic benefits arise from opening access to markets and lowering \ntransport costs in the case of rural roads and bridges, increased incomes, and additional crop \ncycles from improved irrigation, and time saved in collecting water and health benefits from \nvillage  water  projects.  Analyses  of  previous  projects  also  show  important  spillover  effects, \nincluding  stimulating  village  economies,  and  broader  socioeconomic  benefits,  including \ncontributing to poverty reduction. \n \n81.  Overall, investments in priority village facilities and services are expected to benefit more \nthan 1.5 million people in more than 300,000 households. In addition to sustained village \nparticipation,  integration  of  the  proposed  Project  within  the  Government's  PNPM  Mandiri \nProgram and existing systems will improve the efficiency of management and implementation, \nas well as the magnitude and sustainability of economic and financial benefits compared with a \nstand-alone intervention. The economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix L. \n \n82.  Social  and  poverty  reduction  impacts.  The  Project  will  target  poor  and  isolated \nvillages in less-developed districts that lack basic services and infrastructure. The selected \nvillages will have higher than average poverty levels and lower than average achievement levels \nfor MDGs. Improvements in basic infrastructure will increase the availability and accessibility of \neducation and health services for the rural poor and near poor, and will improve income-earning \nopportunities  and  health.  Community  investments  will  (i)  reduce  time  and  costs  spent  on \nobtaining good quality water, (ii) diminish the incidence and severity of waterborne diseases,  \n(iii) increase the availability and accessibility of education and health services for the rural poor \nand near poor, (iv) improve access to services and markets, and (v) provide income-earning \nopportunities and welfare through increased employment. The Project will support capacity \ndevelopment  and  community  facilitation  efforts,  which  will  build  social  capital,  empower \ncommunities, and improve local governance. As a result, the Project will help to deliver more \n                                                 \n48 Papanek, Gustav. 2007. Employment and PNPM Program. Jakarta.  \n ", "    23 \nefficient and equitable services at the local level. The summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy is in Appendix 10. \n \n83.   Gender impacts. Domestic responsibilities and social and cultural stereotypes limit the \ndegree and nature of women's participation in communal forums and organizations. Men and \nwomen's different access to and control over resources and facilities in the community may also \nlimit women's participation in project activities. A gender action plan was prepared for the \nProject, which includes actions to ensure that women (i) are represented in CIOs, (ii) have \naccess  to  planning  and  budgeting  opportunities,  (iii)  are  key  project  stakeholders  and \nbeneficiaries,  and  (iv)  are  encouraged  to  increase  their  participation  in  public  forums  and \ncommunity  decision  making  in  both  project-specific  and  other  activities.  At  least  30%  of \ncommunity facilitators will be women and each CIO will target a 40% female membership. \nSeparate women's meetings will be held to ensure that women's needs are adequately reflected \nin village plans. A gender audit will be completed for each selected community investment to \nensure that it reflects the needs of men and women. The gender action plan is in Appendix 11.  \n \n84.   Indigenous peoples. The Project is not expected to have any negative impacts on \nindigenous peoples. It will not discriminate against them or other marginalized groups. Because \nit is based on CDD principles, the Project will include opportunities for screening project impacts \non indigenous groups and incorporating mitigation measures, if any, into the overall design and \nimplementation of any investment. In accordance with the ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples \n(1998), the Project has been classified as category B. Specific actions have been included in \nthe Project: (i) the selection criteria for community investments includes provisions to ensure \nthat indigenous peoples and other vulnerable groups are part of the capacity-building, planning, \nimplementation, and post-implementation processes; (ii) minority and marginalized groups will \nbe  represented  on  CIOs  and  CIO  representation  committees  in  proportion  to  their  overall \npopulation in the community; and (iii) indigenous groups will benefit proportionally from easier \naccess to service delivery, rural infrastructure, training, and construction-related jobs.   \n \n85.  Land acquisition and resettlement. The Project has been classified as category B as  \nthe scope of land acquisition and resettlement is expected to be insignificant. Based on the \nexperience of the PNPM Mandiri program, land acquisition may be required for very small \ncommunity facilities. This will not involve any resettlement of people, relocation of houses, or \nsignificant impacts on productive land or other productive assets. This is part of the appraisal \ncriteria for community investments. PNPM Mandiri experience indicates that about 500 square \nmeters or less per village investment is usually required, affecting fewer than five households \n(or  25  persons).  Screening  for  potential  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  is \nincorporated into the community decision-making and planning processes and acquisition will \nbe  financed  by  communities  through  the  block  grants  or  as  community  contributions.  The \nsummary land acquisition and resettlement framework is in Appendix 12 and the full framework \nis in Supplementary Appendix M.  \n \n86.  Environmental impacts. The Project is classified as environmental category B (non-\nsensitive). Given the small size of the community projects and the provision of technical and \nsocial facilitation, no environmental damage is expected. Village proposals will be screened \nthrough checklists to review environmental implications and ensure that there are no adverse \nimpacts. Environmental responsibility will mainly reside with the CIOs, assisted by a team of \ncommunity facilitators. The CIOs will be responsible for conducting environmental screening \nand identifying necessary mitigation measures. Community facilitators will receive technical \ntraining prior to project implementation. Safeguard specialists will be recruited at national and \nregional  levels  to  assist  community  facilitators,  provincial  and  DPIUs,  and  the  PCMU  in \n ", "24    \n \nmanaging the Project's environmental aspects. Existing guidelines for community-based civil \nworks  and  the  technical  guidelines  developed  by  MPW  for  PNPM  Mandiri  have  specific \nconsiderations  to  ensure  environmental  considerations  are  taken  into  account  in  design, \nconstruction, and operation. The summary initial environmental examination is in Appendix 13. \nThe initial environmental examination is in Supplementary Appendix N and the environmental \nassessment and review framework is in Supplementary Appendix O.  \n \n87.  Institutional benefits. Community-based planning mechanisms are the key to instituting \ngood governance practices. The Project will strengthen the ability of village communities to \narticulate their needs and to seek support for their development plans, and will improve their \nrespective  district  governments\u2019  ability  to  respond  to  their  demands.  The  Project  will  also \nimprove the planning processes of local governments through its support for bottom-up planning \nand budgeting. As the Project will target poor villages, capacity-building activities will directly \nbenefit the poor by providing them with the means to draw the attention and resources of local \ngovernments to their development needs.  \n \nB.  Risks \n \n88.  Project implementation risks. The Project will operate in less-developed districts of \nthe country where implementation capacities may be limited. To address the risk that this may \naffect project implementation, the Project will strengthen village structures and local government \ncouncils and leadership. It will pay particular attention to local government units involved in \nproject implementation, including the provincial and district steering committees and the PPIUs \nand DPIUs.  \n  \n89.  Institutional  and  governance  risks.  Previous  rural  and  community  development \nprojects, including RIS-PNPM, indicate a risk of elite capture. This risk is minimized by several \nfeatures of the project design, including (i) community poverty mapping; (ii) establishment of the \nCIO; (iii) election of community representatives and village organizers; (iv) representation of \nwomen,  minority,  and  marginalized  groups  among  the  community  representatives;  and  \n(v)  prioritization  of  the  needs  of  poor  community  members  in  the  village  MTPR  plans.  In \naddition, all civil works will be contracted to the CIOs and will be undertaken primarily through \nmanual  labor.  This  will  help  ensure  that  the  jobs  generated  by  the  Project  are  filled  by \ncommunity members. \n  \n90.  Infrastructure projects involving procurement of large amounts of goods and services for \ncivil  works  may  be  prone  to  corruption.  To  a  large  extent,  this  will  be  mitigated  through \ncommunity management of the planning, oversight, and implementation of the civil works. In \naddition,  the  existing  financial  management  systems  and  fiduciary  controls  under  PNPM \nMandiri, which have been developed with assistance from international development agencies, \nare sound and have adequate checks and balances to minimize corruption risks. Finally, the \nProject\u2019s complaints and problems handling unit will review and address any grievances of \nproject stakeholders in relation to the Project, any of the service providers, or any person \nresponsible for carrying out the Project.  \n \n91.  Targeting risks. Under the current support to RIS-PNPM, some better-off villages have \nbeen included while some of the poorest villages were not included. This is likely because of \npolitical interference or inadequate data used for the targeting. This risk will be mitigated by \nusing 2008 village statistics to verify the project village lists, and involving provincial and district \ngovernments in reviewing the lists to confirm that the villages included are the poorest.  \n \n ", "    25 \n92.  Sustainability risks. A lack of O&M can drastically reduce the benefits from village \ninvestments.  CDD  experience  has  demonstrated  that  O&M  is  enhanced  because  of  the \ncommunity ownership generated through villagers' involvement in project selection, planning, \ndesign,  implementation,  and  post-implementation  activities.  The  risk  is  also  reduced  by \nencouraging the use of local labor and materials in construction, and by making approval and \nsupport of community investment proposals contingent on the preparation of O&M plans. \n \n93.  The scope and coverage of the PNPM Mandiri program is very wide, which may affect \nthe ability of the Government to continue large-scale implementation. However, while costs of  \ncommunity facilitation and capacity building are high, these are important investments leading to \nmore sustainable infrastructure, more regular O&M, less leakage, and more social capital. The \nProject  will  include  capacity  building  of  local  government  and  seek  to  mainstream  project \nactivities into existing local government mandates in a cost-effective and efficient manner.  \n \n \nV.    ASSURANCES \n94.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and DGHS have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Loan proceeds and sufficient corresponding counterpart contributions, including \nall  Government  allocations  for  implementation,  staffing  and  O&M  of  project \nfacilities  are  to  be  allocated  and  readily  available,  with  the  submission  of \nbudgetary allocation requests to be  made in a timely manner throughout the \nproject implementation period by earmarking the funds.  \n(ii)  The  smooth  flow  of  funds  will  occur  in  accordance  with  the  flow  of  funds \nmechanism agreed upon by the Government and ADB. \n(iii)  All village investments will be reviewed and assessed for environmental impacts \nin  accordance  with  the  Project\u2019s  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework and respective mitigation and monitoring measures prescribed in the \nrelevant ADB-approved initial environmental examinations. Implementation of the \nproject  activities  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  local \nenvironmental laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). In the \nevent of any conflict, ADB's policy will prevail. \n(iv)  The selection of village investments for implementation under the Project will \nfollow the PNPM Mandiri guidelines\u2014be pro-poor and ensure that indigenous \npeople, minorities and marginalized people equally benefit from the Project.  \n(v)  All  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  under  the  Project  will  be \nimplemented in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and the Project\u2019s land acquisition and \nresettlement  framework.  All  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  will  be \nprepared  in  accordance  with  the  Project's  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nframework. \n(vi)  No disbursement will be authorized by a DPIU for a village investment unless the \nproposed works are based on an approved village MTPR plan and a signed \ncontract  between  the  CIO  and  the  DPIU,  and  certification  for  the  village \ninvestment has been issued from the regional project management consultants \nto the DPIU and been advised to the CIO and the regional treasury offices. To \nensure compliance, the PPIU will undertake regular spot-checks. \n(vii)  Each participating village will establish a separate bank account for village-level \nactivities funded by the Project. Funds will be transferred to the CIO account in \n ", "26    \n \ntranches of 40%, 40%, and 20% of the amount approved for the village proposal \nbased upon verification of actual implementation progress by the relevant DPIU. \n(viii)  Within 6 months following the loan effective date, DGHS will create a project \nwebsite to disclose information about relevant matters on the Project, including \ndetailed accounts of procurement. \n(ix)  The Government will ensure implementation and resourcing of the project gender \naction plan as agreed between ADB and the Government, and in particular, \nensure (a) that women comprise 40% of participants in village training programs, \n(b) that 30% of community facilitators are women, (c) that 40% of the members of \nCIOs are women, and (d) conduct of a gender audit for each selected community \ninvestment. The Gender Action Plan will be implemented and monitored with \nperiodic reports made to ADB and the PNPM Mandiri Oversight Body. \n(x)  Keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other  stakeholders  about \nmeasures that may impact the effective implementation of the Project. \n \n \nVI.

Community-driven development (CDD) was introduced in Indonesia in 1998, in the midst \nof the Asian crisis and the subsequent upheaval against the Suharto administration, which led to \na breakdown in service delivery mechanisms that had previously been managed directly by the \ncentral  government.  The  first  post-Suharto  CDD  project  was  the  Kecamatan  (subdistrict) \nDevelopment Project (KDP)1, funded by the World Bank. Since then, a number of CDD projects \nhave been implemented and funded by various development partners, among them the World \nBank-supported Urban Poverty Project (UPP)2 and Village Infrastructure Project (VIP),3 and the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-supported  Rural  Infrastructure  Support  Project  (RISP),4 \nCommunity  Water  Services  Health  Project  (CWHSP),5  Community  and  Local  Government \nSupport Project (CLGSP),6 and the Community Empowerment for Rural Development Project \n(CERDP).7  \n \nA.  Government Agencies in CDD  \n \n2.  Several government agencies and nongovernment organizations have been involved in \nCDD  and  years  of  experience  have  built  up  the  national  capacity  for  CDD  approaches. \nGovernment agencies that have played significant roles in CDD include the following.  \n \n(i)  The  National  Planning  Development  Agency  (BAPPENAS)  is  responsible  for \nurban  and  rural  infrastructure  planning  and  coordination  of  national  reform \nprocesses.  It  was  instrumental  in  the  first  KDP  and  other  CDD  projects. \nBAPPENAS is considered the champion of CDD in Indonesia and played a \nleading role in the development of PNPM Mandiri. \n \n(ii)  The Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) oversees decentralization and monitoring \nof performance of regional governments. MOHA acted as executing agency for \nKDP  II  and  III  and  has  built  its  capacity  for  supervision  and  oversight  of \ncommunity-driven initiatives. MOHA is also playing a leading role in the PNPM \nMandiri as executing agency for the World-Bank-financed PNPM Rural. \n \n(iii)  The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) through the Directorate General of Water \nResources (DGWR), and the Directorate General of Human Settlements (DGHS) \nhas  also  been  involved  in  a  number  of  CDD  initiatives.  The  Ministry  is \nresponsible for all nationally funded public works and for ensuring compliance \nwith technical standards and designs. DGWR provides guidance in allocating \nsurface water resources amongst users. DGHS was the executing agency for \nnumerous  community-based  projects,  including  the  World  Bank\u2019s  UPP  and \nADB\u2019s RISP and Neighborhood Upgrading and Shelter Sector Project (NUSSP). \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 1998.

The  decentralization  law  further \nenhanced the authority of local governments, giving them resources so they could match grants \nfor community-based projects and augment community block grants. The decentralization law \ngave local governments authority over the provision of such basic services as health, education, \npublic works, environment, communications, agriculture, industry and trade, capital investments, \nmanpower, and infrastructure services.   \n \nB.   ADB and Community-Driven Development in Indonesia \n \n4.  ADB has funded several projects with CDD features in Indonesia. Between 2001 and \n2007, 23 loans were approved, 11 of which had CDD features. Of the total loan amount, 21% \nrepresented operations with CDD features.   \n \n1.  Rural Infrastructure Support Project (RISP) \n \n5.  The RISP was part of the rural infrastructure component of Indonesia\u2019s Fuel Subsidy \nReduction Compensation Program (PKPS-BBM). The project rehabilitated and improved rural \ninfrastructure in 1,840 villages in 45 districts in East Java, East Nusa Tenggara, South East \nSulawesi and South Sulawesi provinces. The total project cost was $60.82 million, of which  \n$50 million was funded by ADB. The executing agency was the Ministry of Public Works through \nits DGHS.  \n \n6.  The RISP used CDD approaches: before subproject funding, target communities were \norganized, informed about the project, and provided with a forum to select subprojects for \nfunding.  Communities  organized  subproject  implementation  committees  to  oversee  the \nconstruction of subprojects. In most cases, contractors were not used; instead, communities \nentered into contracts with the executing agency to implement the subprojects themselves. \nFunds  were  transferred  directly  to  community  accounts  and  members  of  the  community \nsubproject committees oversaw disbursement of the funds. The Project made payments based \non plans rather than on actual expenditures, and disbursed 40% of the block grant upon \napproval of the proposal and signing of the contract between communities and the district \ngovernment.  \n \n2.  Community Water Services and Health Project  (CWSHP) \n \n7.  ADB has contributed to the improvement and expansion of water supply and sanitation \nservices in Indonesia using CDD approaches. The CWSHP provides rural water supply and \nsanitation facilities and services to about 1,000 communities in 20 districts in four provinces. \nThe Project aims to improve district governments' capacity to deliver basic water and sanitation \nservices, strengthen communities so they can take primary responsibility for such services, \nextend water and sanitation facilities to communities through a demand-driven approach, and \nincrease communities\u2019 awareness of health and hygiene.8  \n \n8.  The executing agency for the Project is the Ministry of Health\u2019s Directorate General of \nCommunicable Disease Control and Environmental Health. The Project employs facilitators \n(technical and empowerment) to help villagers in the process of mobilization, planning, technical \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005.

A menu of potential investments related to water and sanitation is \nprovided and communities choose subprojects from the menu. Community procurement is used \nand there is a direct flow of funds from project accounts to community accounts.   \n \n3.    Community and Local Government Support Project (CLGSP) \n \n9.  The CLGSP has improved the access of poor communities to small basic items of public \ninfrastructure  (e.g.,  water  supply,  toilet  facilities,  drainage,  irrigation,  markets,  roads  and \nfootpaths, bridges, piers and harbors, schools, and health posts) using CDD approaches. The \nProject also provided capacity building interventions to strengthen community-based institutions \nand improve local governments\u2019 capacity to manage CDD.  \n \n10.  The CLGSP supported the construction of public facilities through community efforts. \nCommunities exercised a high degree of participation, and provided additional resources. An \nevaluation of the Project9 reported that most subprojects were of good quality. The same report \nnoted that the capacities of local communities, districts, and cities had improved because of \ntheir involvement in planning and implementation of subprojects and as a result of its capacity \nbuilding interventions.  \n \n4.    Community Empowerment for Rural Development (CERDP) \n \n11.  The CERDP supported the capacity building of local government staff and villagers and \nfinanced  a  development  planning  process  for  local  development  needs.  The  Project  used \nparticipatory approaches under which villagers identified local problems and proposed solutions, \norganized themselves to implement those solutions, and monitored results.  \n \n12.  Community-based savings and loan organizations were organized to support micro-\nenterprises  and  assist  communities  in  obtaining  loans.  The  Directorate  General  of  Rural \nCommunity Empowerment of the MOHA was the executing agency. \n \nC.    Impacts of CDD Approaches   \n \n13.  Independent evaluations of the KDP\u2014the largest CDD operation in the world and the \nmain predecessor of the PNPM Mandiri\u2014indicate an average economic internal rate of return of \nmore than 50%, well above those of other non-CDD rural infrastructure projects implemented in \nsimilar geographic areas of Indonesia. Infrastructure built under CDD projects costs about 40% \nless  than  similar  works  built  through  other  procurement  methods,  while  meeting  quality \nstandards.10  Evidence  also  indicates  that  CDD  is  likely  to  offer  better  cost  recovery  and \noperations and maintenance (O&M) of completed infrastructure facilities and services because \nof community members' strong sense of ownership. CDD helps to ensure that benefits accrue to \nthe  poor.  There  are  noneconomic  benefits  as  well.  CDD  offers  better  accountability\u2014\ntransparency  in  decision  making  and  procurement  and  the  increased  use  of  audits  have \ndemonstrably reduced  corruption and leakage. The bottom-up planning processes of CDD \npresent  more  opportunities  for  the  inclusion  and  participation  of  poor  women  and  other \ndisadvantaged  groups  in  community  and  local  governance  processes.  Finally,  CDD  can \n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2006. Project Completion Report on the Community and Local Government Support Sector Development \nProgram. Manila. \n10 Records of ADB\u2019s RISP show cost savings of 33-50% compared to similar contractor-executed projects. This is \npartly because of transparency measures in decision-making and resource allocation and the use of participatory \nprocesses that reduced corruption. \n ", "34   Appendix 2 \ndemonstrably operate to scale, as shown by the World Bank's annual CDD-related lending \nvolume of nearly $2 billion. \n \n(i)   Good targeting. CDD approaches target the poor well and reach more poor \nareas than other types of projects. The systematic approach to selecting and \nprioritizing poor villages helps ensure that benefits accrue to the poor. Studies \nalso affirm that good poverty targeting increases the poverty impact of rural \ninfrastructure development.  \n \n(ii)  Lower cost and good quality infrastructure. Infrastructure built using CDD \ncost about 40% less than similar works built through other procurement methods, \nwhile meeting quality standards. Under ADB\u2019s RISP, records show cost savings \nof 33%\u201350% compared with similar contractor-executed projects. This is partly \nbecause of transparency measures in decision-making and resource allocation \nand the use of participatory processes that reduced corruption.  \n \n(iii)  High  economic  returns.  Average  economic  internal  rates  of  return  of \nsubprojects built using CDD in Indonesia (KDP, in particular) are more than 50%, \nwell above those of similar types of rural infrastructure projects. CDD projects \nhave generated millions of person-months of temporary employment during the \nconstruction period. CDD approaches have also had a significant impact on \nhousehold expenditures. An estimate of the impact of a nationwide roll-out of \nPNPM Mandiri indicates a 10%\u201314% increase in the incomes of some 24 million \npeople.11 \n \n(iv)  High  rates  of  inclusion.  The  use  of  intensive  community  facilitation  has \nimproved the participation of women and the poor. World Bank reports indicate \nthat more than 50% of the participants in village decision-making meetings are \npoor and 70% of the workforce are poor. The participation of women in meetings \nis also high, ranging from 30% to 45%.  \n \n(v)  Quick disbursement. Resources for CDD approaches have been disbursed \nquickly. This is true for both the World Bank KDP and ADB\u2019s RISP, which both \nachieved almost 100% disbursement well ahead of their closing schedules.  \n \nD.   Government Strategy for CDD: PNPM Mandiri \n \n14.  After more than a decade of implementation experience in Indonesia, a consensus has \nemerged on the core design features of CDD projects, which include:  \n \n(i)  community selection of village investments based on identified local needs; \n(ii)  direct block grant transfers to community bank accounts held in state-chartered \nbanks; \n(iii)  social  facilitators  recruited  from  the  private  sector  or  nongovernment \norganizations  (rather  than  civil  servants)  to  provide  information,  promote \nparticipation, and train villagers; \n(iv)  engineering facilitators recruited to oversee technical quality and train villagers; \nand  \n                                                 \n11  Papanek. 2007.

Encouraged by the success of CDD Programs, the Government formally adopted the \nCDD approach through the National Program for Community Empowerment (PNPM Mandiri),12 \nlaunched  by  the  President  in  August  2006.  PNPM  Mandiri  is  a  nationwide  program  for \ncommunity empowerment aimed at accelerating poverty reduction. It seeks to promote a spirit \nof  cooperation  and  self-help  and  empower  rural  and  urban  communities  to  participate  in \ndevelopment. The program is linked to the achievement of targets set out in the Midterm \nNational Development Plan, 2005\u20132009 and poverty reduction outcomes tied to the attainment \nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Through PNPM Mandiri, the Government aims \nto  put  in  place  a  comprehensive  framework  to  streamline,  coordinate,  and  make  more \ncompatible  the  more  than  60  community-based  programs  of  18  different  ministries,  thus \ninstitutionalizing the experience of Indonesia in bottom-up planning and decision making.  \n \n16.  The PNPM Mandiri program consists of PNPM Core (PNPM Inti) and PNPM Support \n(PNPM Penguatan). The PNPM Core consists of five major empowerment programs,13 while the \nPNPM  Support  consists  of  the  sectoral  program  activities  of  technical  ministries  that  also \nprovide support to poor communities. \n \n17.  A  coordinating  committee  of  ministries  implementing  community-based  anti-poverty \nprograms has been created for PNPM Mandiri. The committee, the PNPM Mandiri Oversight \nBody, provides policy directives, guidance, and managerial oversight to the PNPM Mandiri. It is \nchaired by the Coordinating Ministry for People's Welfare (Menko Kesra); and its members \ninclude  the  state  ministers  of  National  Planning  Development  Agency  (BAPPENAS);  less \ndeveloped  regions;  and  the  ministers  of  finance,  home  affairs,  public  works,  and  social \ndevelopment.14  The  composition  of  this  body  is  mirrored  in  the  provincial  and  district \ncoordination  teams,  which  are  chaired  by  the  provincial  governors  and  district  heads, \nrespectively. These regional bodies also have coordinating and monitoring functions. \n \n18.  Supporting  the  PNPM  Mandiri  Program  is  the  PNPM  Support  Facility  (PSF),  a \nmechanism established by the Government and its partners. Through PSF, donors can provide \nhigh-quality, coordinated technical assistance, planning advice and dialogue as well as targeted \nfinancial assistance to the government to support PNPM Mandiri. The PSF has four windows of \nactivities: (i) direct budget support and cofinancing, which channels donor funds to support \nPNPM cofinancing programs, such as community block grants and provision of facilitators;  \n(ii) coordination and supervision support, which provides support to PSF management and the \nPNPM oversight body to increase their capacity for the long-term management of the PNPM; \n(iii)  on-granting  to  Indonesian  civil  society,  especially  work  on  poverty  reduction  at  the \ngrassroots level; and (iv) technical assistance to PNPM, which consists primarily of specialized \nexpertise related to monitoring and evaluation, special studies, technical assistance, workshops \nand comparative study tours to relevant programs.   \n \n                                                 \n12  PNPM-Mandiri: Program Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat.    \n13 These include (i) the RIS-PNPM Project (ADB), (ii) KDP (World Bank), (iii) UPP (World Bank), (iv) Support for Poor \nand Disadvantaged Areas Project (SPADA) (World Bank), and (v) Regional Infrastructure for Social and Economic \nDevelopment Project (RISE) (JBIC). \n14 The Coordinating Ministry for People's Welfare also chairs a policy-level working group for the PNPM (Tim \nPengendali), a deputy level steering committee that includes representatives from seven ministries and is similar in \ncomposition to the ministerial working group. Donor organizations also participate in these meetings. \n \n ", "36   Appendix 2 \n19.  Consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  desire  to  have  a  single  strategy  for  community \nempowerment  and  poverty  reduction,  approaches,  guidelines,  and  procedures  have  been \nharmonized, including the formulation of a monitoring and evaluation framework, a grievance \nredress system, a common management information system, and common training packages. \nThese have been prepared jointly by the Government and its development partners, under the \nleadership of the PNPM Mandiri Oversight Body. \n \n20.  In 2009, PNPM Mandiri is being implemented in 33 provinces, 465 districts and 6,408  \nkecamatans at an estimated program cost of $1.1 billion. PNPM-Mandiri expects to achieve \n100%  coverage  of  all  kecamatans  (6,627)  by  2010.  The  estimated  budget  for  program \nimplementation in 2010 is $1.1 billion, with the Government of Indonesia expected to provide \nalmost 50% of the funding requirement from its own resources.15  \n \nTable A2: Program, Budget Estimates, and Coverage of PNPM Core Program in 2009a \n($ million) \n \n    Government     \nProject  Total  Budget         Loans  Kecamatan \nPNPM Urban  265.00  70.00  195.00  1,500 \nRISE  51.17  2.00  49.17  237 \nPNPM Rural  1,132.90  832.90  300.00  4,270 \nSPADA  5.73  0.00  5.73  186 \nRIS-PNPM  62.50  12.50  50.00  215 \n  Total   1,517.30  917.40  599.90  6,408 \nSPADA = Support for Poor and Disadvantaged Areas Project, RISE = Regional Infrastructure for Social and \nEconomic Development Project, RIS-PNPM = Rural Infrastructure Support to the PNPM Mandiri Project. \na The 2010 coverage and budget estimates have not yet been finalized. \nb Rural Infrastructure Support to the PNPM Mandiri Project. \nSource: The National Planning Development Agency (BAPPENAS). \n \n                                                 \n15 In 2008, four development agencies provided loan support to PNPM Mandiri: the World Bank ($409 million), Asian \nDevelopment Bank ($50 million), International Fund for Agricultural Development ($69 million), and Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation ($250 million).

The Government of Indonesia introduced community-driven development (CDD) in 1998 \nto  reduce  poverty  through  community  empowerment.  Starting  with  the  World-Bank-funded \nKecamatan Development Project (KDP) in 1998, CDD projects have evolved to become the key \ninstrument for poverty reduction, local level capacity building and service delivery in Indonesia. \nBased on successful CDD initiatives, the Government launched a new program to accelerate \npoverty reduction in September 2006\u2014the National Program for Community Empowerment \n(PNPM Mandiri). PNPM Mandiri seeks to consolidate CDD programs executed by different line \nministries by using a single framework, and to institutionalize the experience in bottom-up \nplanning and decision-making. The PNPM program is funded through allocations from central   \nand local government budgets, and from grants and loans from development partners.   \n \n2.  PNPM Mandiri has expanded rapidly over the past 3 years. It covered 2,361 kecamatans \nin  2007  and  4,768  in  2008.  It  is  expected  that  by  the  end  of  2009,  villages  in  all  6,408 \nkecamatans will receive block grants to support social and economic infrastructure investments. \nThe total investment costs for PNPM Mandiri are projected to be Rp7.0 trillion in 2009 and \nRp9.7 trillion for 2010. The World Bank is the key development partner in providing external \nfunding to PNPM Mandiri program. The World Bank's assistance is summarized in Table A3.1. \n \nTable A3.1:  World Bank Support for Community-Driven Development in Indonesia \n \n  Type of    Amount \nProject Name  Assistance  Period  ($ million) \nKecamatan Development Project I  Loan  1998\u20132002  273.0 \nKecamatan Development Project   Loan  2002\u20132007  334.2 \nKecamatan Development Project III  (3A)  Loan  2005\u20132009  73.1 \nKecamatan Development Project III  (3B)  Loan   2005\u20132008  184.3 \nPNPM Rural   Loan   2008\u20132012  420.4 \nVillage Infrastructure Project for Java  Loan  1995\u20131998  72.5 \nVillage Infrastructure Project II  Loan  1996\u20132000  140.1 \nWater Supply and Sanitation Project for Low-Income  Loan  1993\u20131999  80.0 \nCommunities \nSecond Water Supply and Sanitation Project for Low-  Loan  2000\u20132008  77.4 \nIncome Communities \n \n3.  In December 2007, the PNPM Support Facility (PSF) was established with financial \ncontributions from the Government of the Netherlands ($37.3 million); the Australian Agency for \nInternational Development, AusAID ($4.2million); the Danish International Development Agency, \nDANIDA ($10.0 million), and the Department for International Development (DFID) of the United \nKingdom ($5.5 million). PSF is a trust fund chaired by the Government through BAPPENAS and \nmanaged by the World Bank. The objective of PSF is to support the Government in providing \neffective  leadership  and  management  of  the  PNPM  Mandiri,  including  (i)  ensuring  better \ncoordination,  (ii)  developing  capacity  at  all  levels  to  plan,  manage  and  improve  poverty \nreduction programs, (iii) reducing poverty through government and civil society partnerships, \nand (iv) supporting monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s support for CDD approaches in Indonesia has evolved since the mid-1990s. ADB \nhas  supported  the  Government  in  strengthening  rural  water  and  sanitation  services  and \nirrigation systems, upgrading slum neighborhoods, and improving rural income generation of \n ", "38   Appendix 3 \nrural  poor.  The  Rural  Infrastructure  Support  to  PNPM-Mandiri  Project  (RIS-PNPM)1  was \napproved in September 2008 for $50.0 million. The Project is scheduled to close on 30 June \n2011 and will rehabilitate and improve rural infrastructure in about 1,700 poor villages in four \nprovinces  and  32  districts  in  Sumatra.    In  addition  to  the  World  Bank  and  ADB,  the \nGovernments  of  Japan  and  Germany  (through  KfW)  provided  assistance  for  CDD-based \nprograms. The Australian Government has recently earmarked a total of A$215 million for \nPNPM support over a 5-year period from 2009 to 2014. The program will be executed through \n(i)  additional  support  to  the  PSF,  (ii)  technical  assistance,  and  (iii)  direct  transfers  to \ncommunities to promote PNPM Generasi and village microfinance grants. \n \n5.

Manila. \n \n ", "      Appendix 4  39\nSUMMARY OF GOVERNANCE RISKS AND MITIGATION MEASURES \n \n1.  Lessons from previous rural and community development projects have been used to \nidentify project governance risks and propose mitigation measures. The risks affecting the \nProject are summarized in this appendix.  \n \n2.  Compromised  community  empowerment.  This  risk  is  often  due  to  limited \nunderstanding and acceptance of a project\u2019s basic principles. The project coordination and \nmonitoring unit (PCMU) of the executing agency prepares an operational manual and uses it to \norient project managers. Although the PCMU has disseminated the manual and is using it to \norient project managers in the ongoing RIS-PNPM, there is a continued lack of understanding \nand appreciation of the role of community facilitation among the project stakeholders. Coupled \nwith incentives to complete the construction of community infrastructure projects within the \ncurrent fiscal year, this has led to the fast-tracking of community mobilization activities and \nlimited community participation in many activities. As a result, the Project has been vulnerable \nto  influence  from  local  leadership  to  implement  infrastructure  investments  that  are  not \nnecessarily village priorities and that have been identified without accompanying empowerment \nand capacity building. \n \n3.  Building a thorough and common understanding of project principles and procedures \nacross all stakeholders requires a systematic and persistent strategy of orientation, knowledge \nsharing,  and  information  dissemination  to  ensure  that  all  project  managers  and  staff  are \nprovided with the knowledge, skills and attitudes to implement the Project. Several subject-\nspecific training courses will be delivered to managers and staff. \n \n4.  Elite capture of project benefits. In some RIS-PNPM areas, the village head seems to \nbe the decision maker and the community the follower. This runs counter to the Project\u2019s goal of \ncommunity empowerment. It may also enable corruption since the community may not be able \nto assert its rights before the village head. To mitigate this risk, poor and vulnerable groups \nneed to be included in all stages of project implementation. Not only should these groups be \nadequately represented in the community implementation organizations, the prioritized village \nproject(s) should target the poor as the primary beneficiaries. Poverty mapping is a required \nactivity of the Project, but the mapping results will not be maximized if implementers either (i) do \nnot appreciate the need to identify the poor and to prioritize their needs, or (ii) lack knowledge \nand skills to identify the poor. Field observations indicate that, at present, some communities \nhave problems differentiating between the needs of the poor and those of other residents of the \nvillage.  \n \n5.  Several mitigation measures are proposed. First, the role of the village head and the \nvillage apparatus in the Project will be made clear to the community during the socialization \nprocess. While the village head and village leadership are active partners of the Project, the \ncommunity members should be given the opportunity to experience and manage their own \ninvestments directly. This exercise is expected to contribute to good governance as people are \ntrained  to  become  active  players  in  the  development  process.  Second,  the  community \nfacilitators will be trained to recognize the danger of elite capture and to help the community \naddress it. Third, project implementation guidelines will include provisions to avoid elite capture. \nThe training program for various stakeholders will highlight the pro-poor focus of the Project and \ncommunity facilitators and local governments will be trained in pro-poor planning and budgeting \ntechniques developed by ADB technical assistance on pro-poor planning and budgeting.1  \n                                                 \n1\u00a0ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Pro-Poor Planning and Budgeting. Manila. \n \n ", "40          Appendix 4 \n6.  Limited capacity for community facilitation. Community facilitators are at the front-\nline of the Project in the participating villages. The success of the Project depends greatly on the \ntimely and quality interaction of the facilitators with the villagers. In several areas, however, \ncommunity facilitation has been weak and some communities have received little support in \nundertaking the planning process and other project activities. The Project will address this by  \nimproving the selection process and compensation package for facilitators, improving their \nterms  of  reference,  offering  them  good  training  and  other  capacity  building  programs, \nimplementing  an  effective  monitoring  and  supervision  system,  and  evaluating  facilitators\u2019 \nperformance quarterly. \n \n7.  Unclear  accountability  relationships  under  a  decentralized  system.  Under  the \ndecentralization law, the national government no longer exercises administrative control over \nregional governments and provincial governments no longer have administrative control over \ndistrict governments. The project implementation units are therefore under the administrative \nsupervision of the local governments. However, since this is a national project, the PCMU must \nbe  able  to  exercise  administrative  and  technical  supervision  over  the  provincial  project \nimplementation units (PPIUs) and district project implementation units (DPIUs).  Accountability \nrelationships,  however,  remain  unclear.  Performance  evaluation,  incentives  and  sanctions \nremain sensitive issues, which could affect the smooth implementation of the Project. In order to \nclarify the roles, responsibilities, and rights of the local governments under the Project, the \nDirectorate  General  of  Human  Settlements  (DGHS)  will  execute  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding with each participating village, specifying the responsibilities of the village and \nthe  Project;  and  a  partnership  agreement  to  be  signed  between  DGHS  and  district \ngovernments. \n \n8.  Inadequate fiduciary controls may enable corruption. There is a risk of leakage \ndespite  the  presence  of  fiduciary  controls  in  the  Project.  Three  mitigation  measures  are \nproposed.  First,  internal  control  will  be  strengthened  by  providing  adequate  training  to \ncommunity members to enable them to monitor fund receipts and disbursements and to audit \nthe validity of all transactions. The community implementation organization will be trained in \nfinancial planning and bookkeeping to be able to present an accurate report on fund status to \nthe community. Other community members will also be taught to monitor the physical progress \nof the work and to verify the validity and accuracy of all fund disbursements (especially for \nprocurement of materials and labor). Second, the Project will establish a grievance mechanism \nthat is accessible and fully understood and trusted by the community members. Those who \nhave complaints will have access to a means of making their grievance known. Third, the \ntraining program for community facilitators will provide for an overview of financial management \nsystems so that all community facilitators (and not only those assigned to provide financial \nassistance) will be able to undertake monitoring and spot-checks in villages.  \n ", "      Appendix 5  41\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category  \n($ million) \n \n Total  Percentage of Total \nItem  Cost  Base Cost \nInvestment Costs a \n1.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nBefore the Asian crisis 1997\u20131998, Indonesia had been successful in fighting poverty. The poverty incidence\u2014the \nproportion of the population living below $1 per day\u2014was reduced from 44% (1976) to 11% (1996). However, the \nAsian crisis increased the poverty incidence to 23.6% in 1998. With successful macroeconomic management, \npoverty incidence steadily declined to 14.2% by 2009, which means that about 33 million people remain poor. In \naddition, about half of the population still live below the $2 per day poverty line. Disparities across regions are \nstriking, as provinces in outlying regions have poverty incidence that is well above the national average. In rural \nareas, poverty incidence has been about 8% higher than in urban areas. The current global economic recession is \nalso expected to put additional strains on the poor and near poor as the employment opportunities decrease and \neconomic growth decelerates.  \n \nIndonesia\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy identified the major causes of poverty as: (i) lack of access to key social \nservices, (ii) absence of economic opportunities, particularly in rural areas, (iii) poor infrastructure in villages, and (iv) \ninadequate market linkages. Weak governance hampers the progress made in addressing these major causes of \npoverty. The Medium-Term Development Plan, 2005\u20132009 focuses on poverty reduction and the achievement of the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  Its  five  priority  areas  include  (i)  job  creation  and  poverty  reduction \nprograms; (ii) macroeconomic stability with stable prices, fiscal sustainability, and financial sector reforms; (iii) \naccelerating investments, exports, and tourism through reforms for a healthy business climate and flexible markets; \n(iv) improved access to and quality of education and health; and (v) infrastructure development by improving the \nefficiency of existing services and greater private sector participation.  \n \nIn August 2006, the Government launched the National Program for Community Empowerment (PNPM Mandiri). \nPNPM  Mandiri  builds  upon  Indonesia\u2019s  accumulated  experience  with  community-driven  development  (CDD) \nprograms and focuses on improving local governance and service delivery at the kecamatan and village level by \nencouraging participatory planning and providing block grants for investment proposals that the communities have \ndeveloped themselves. The program will cover all villages in the country during 2008\u20132015. The PNPM Mandiri \npromotes inclusive community facilitation in planning and implementation of basic services and infrastructure \nimprovements, utilizes simple and transparent funds flow mechanisms, and emphasizes operation and maintenance \nof completed works. The Project is built into the Government\u2019s PNPM Mandiri and the project implementation \narrangements are aligned with the PNPM Mandiri mechanisms. \n \nThe Project is in line with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for Indonesia, 2006\u20132009, which includes investments \nin rural infrastructure as strategic key area of engagement to address poverty and regional disparities, and achieve \nthe MDGs. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                     Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention (TI-G) \n1.  Key Issues  \nMany people are vulnerable to the risk of falling into poverty due to the current economic slowdown. Unemployment is \nforecast to rise above 9% in 2009 as domestic layoffs spread and more overseas workers lose their jobs and return \nhome. More people will probably be pushed into the informal sector, which already accounts for about two-thirds of the \nlabor force\u2014where wages are low and jobs insecure. Another poverty-related challenge in Indonesia is the striking \ndisparity among regions, provinces, districts, and cities. The Project will cover about 1,500 rural less developed villages \nin 215 kecamatans in four provinces in Western Indonesia (Jambi, Lampung, Riau, and South Sumatra provinces). The \nfour provinces are home to about 2 million rural poor (about 400,000 households), or more than 12% of the country\u2019s \nrural poor. The four provinces are located in the southern half of Sumatra Island, where the incidence of rural poverty \nis higher than the national average.   \n \n2. Design Features  \nThe  Project  will  complement  the  Government\u2019s  PNPM  Mandiri  and  apply  the  program\u2019s  modalities  and \nimplementation structure. It will be aligned with the Government\u2019s development strategies. About 2 million rural poor \nwill benefit from basic services and infrastructure improvements, including better village roads and pathways, bridges \nand  culverts,  small  piers,  village  irrigation  schemes,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation,  drainage  works;  and \nrehabilitation of schools, local health services, and multipurpose village buildings. These improvements to basic \ninfrastructure will give rural poor and near poor greater access to and availability of education and health services, as \nwell as short- and long-term employment opportunities. The Project also promotes good governance by building on \nthe  CDD  approach,  which  involves  communities  in  project  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring.  It  will \nincorporate good governance through (i) advance socialization of the overall program objectives so that the \n ", "54             Appendix 10 \ncommunities  understand  the  intentions,  outcomes,  and  processes  by  which  funds  will  be  disbursed; \n(ii) ensuring transparent, consistent, and cost-effective investment planning and implementation in villages through \nwell-defined procedures, guidelines, and institutional arrangements; (iii) establishment of well-defined procedures for \nthe transfer of funds to community-managed bank accounts; and (iv) comprehensive monitoring and evaluation \n(M&E). \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Findings of Social Analysis  \nIndonesia\u2019s infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, remains poor by regional standards. Electrification rates are the \nlowest in Southeast Asia, road congestion is increasing, and the conditions of rural roads are poor. A lack of access \nto infrastructure results in location poverty. People who live in isolated areas with difficult geography and poor market \nlinks lack both economic opportunities and adequate levels of service delivery. More than 15% of all Indonesian \nvillages  are  inaccessible  by  vehicle  all  year  round.  Investments  in  transportation  infrastructure,  agricultural \ninfrastructure (irrigation), and education and health facilities can significantly improve living conditions in remote \nareas, create the basis for economic growth, and improve the welfare of the local population. The positive effect of \ninfrastructure on rural welfare has been empirically demonstrated; surveys have revealed that the presence of good \nroads is strongly and significantly correlated with a community\u2019s level of mean income.  \n \nApproximately 60% of the population lives in rural areas where agriculture is the main source of livelihood. One \nreason for low incomes is that \u2018farm gate prices\u2019a are very low compared with the price in urban areas for the same \ngoods. This is due to the high real transport costs for rural marketable surpluses over poor quality roads. Transport \ncosts are even higher for non-motor-vehicle transport where there are no roads. In a rapid assessment of the causes \nof poverty in five of Indonesia\u2019s districts, villagers in isolated areas identified high transport costs to be a major cause \nof poverty. New roads in previously unserved agricultural areas can significantly lower transaction costs and hence \nraise farm gate prices, which will mean higher incomes for people in the agriculture sector, the poorest group of the \npopulation. Better rural roads will also help agriculture extension workers reach rural farmers to provide technical \nadvice and know-how to increase productivity. \n \nImproved access to social services is crucial. Lack of access to quality education significantly decreases productivity, \nemployment opportunities, and personal income. With better roads and education facilities, teachers may be more \nwilling to work in rural schools and the teaching and learning environment would improve, increasing human capital. \nHealth and hygiene problems are still major causes of poverty in Indonesia. Through a serious illness or an accident, \na family can easily lose any accumulated asset. Investments to improve drinking water quality and rehabilitate basic \nhealth facilities will contribute to increased access to and better quality of health services in rural communities.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \nDuring project preparation, regular consultations were held with key stakeholders (e.g., government officials and \nnongovernmental staff at national, provincial, and district levels, community leaders, and development partners). \nDuring  implementation,  the  Project  will  maintain  broad  stakeholder  participation.  It  will  support  community \nempowerment and strengthen local capacity to implement priority programs. The Project includes assistance to \n(i) conduct  an awareness campaign to familiarize the community members with the program; (ii) conduct community \nfacilitation, including poverty mapping in villages, identification of problems and needs, evaluation of community \nimplementation capacity, and development of planning mechanisms and decision-making processes; (iii) assist in the \nestablishment and capacity building of community implementation organizations; (iv) assist communities to formulate  \nvillage  medium-term  poverty  reduction  plans  and  community  project  proposals  for  funding  by  block  grants; \n(v) provide technical guidance in the implementation of the project; and (vi) assist communities to formulate and \nimplement operation and maintenance (O&M) plans to ensure the sustainability of completed facilities. \n \nWhat level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \nWas a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No, the Project applies CDD planning and implementations mechanisms. \n These have been successfully implemented under the Government\u2019s PNPM Mandiri program in other provinces.  \nC.   Gender and Development  \nKey Issues. Using a consultative process, the country gender assessment identified four key themes: (i) the impact \nof decentralization on gender, (ii) women\u2019s inadequate representation in political decision-making, (iii) violence \nagainst women, and (iv) women and international migration. It noted that, while Indonesia has made progress over \nthe years, gender inequalities persist. Gender-disaggregated data are lacking. Indonesia was ranked 107th globally \nin both gender and human development indexes in 2008. b Women\u2019s longer life expectancy is more than offset by a \nmuch lower literacy rate and a smaller share of earned income. In 2007, women\u2019s labor force participation was only \n40%, compared with 80% for men. The shift to regional autonomy has already shown potential to increase the \nparticipation of women in local governance. During the 2006 elections, six regions selected women as regional \nheads,  and  11  regions  gave  women  the  opportunity  to  be  elected  as  deputy  regional  heads.  However, \ndecentralization has sometimes been accompanied by a revival of conservative religious interpretations of gender \nroles.  \n ", "      Appendix 10  55\nKey Actions. Drawing a comprehensive conclusion on issues related to gender and income poverty in Indonesia is \ndifficult, as consistent sex-disaggregated data are not available. The CDD approach applied by the Project will ensure \nthat perspectives of both men and women are represented in planning, designing, and implementing the village \ninfrastructure investments. At least 40% of the total CIO membership will be women. Experience from the PNPM \nMandiri reveals that the number of women on the committees ranges from a few women to entirely women, depending \non the circumstances of individual villages. In order to ensure that women will benefit directly and significantly from the \nProject, community facilitation will incorporate gender concerns into (i) selection of project management consultants and \ntraining of community facilitators, (ii) consultation and socialization of the program in the community, (iii) social mapping \nin villages, (iv) establishment of CIOs, (v) community capacity building, and (vi) formulation of the village medium-term \npoverty reduction plan plans.  \n    Gender action plan  (Appendix 11)       Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \n  III.

The Project will reduce poverty and improve local governance of rural communities in \nthe  project  areas.  It  will  improve  the  access  of  the  poor  and  near  poor  in  the  project \ncommunities  to  services  and  basic  rural  infrastructure.  The  Project  has  three  outputs:  \n(i)  strengthened  capacity  for  community  planning  and  development,  (ii)  improved  village \nservices and infrastructure through community development grants, and (iii) improved capacity \nfor project implementation and monitoring and evaluation. It will cover about 1,500 rural less \ndeveloped villages in 215 kecamatans in four provinces in Western Indonesia (Jambi, Lampung, \nRiau, and South Sumatra provinces). The Project is classified as category B for involuntary \nresettlement, as the scope for land acquisition and resettlement is insignificant. This appendix \nsummarizes  the  key  elements  of  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  for  the \nProject. The full framework, based on that prepared for the Rural Infrastructure Support to \nPNPM Mandiri  Project (RIS-PNPM), is in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \n2.  Scope of land acquisition and resettlement. The Project will require limited land \nacquisition for very small community facilities and will not involve any resettlement of people, \nrelocation of houses, or significant impact upon productive land or other productive assets. \nBased on existing National Program for Community Empowerment Program (PNPM Mandiri) \nactivities, very minimal plots of land are required for community investments\u2014usually fewer  \nthan 500 square meters per village investment, which affect fewer than five households (or 25 \npersons). It is expected that these small amounts of land will be acquired mainly through \nvoluntary contribution by project beneficiaries.  \n \n3.  Land acquisition and resettlement framework. The land acquisition and resettlement \nframework (i) identifies the legal and policy frameworks of the Government and appropriate ADB \npolicies  and  guidelines,  (ii)  sets  out  procedures  and  policies  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement to guide impacts during subproject design and implementation, and (iii) outlines \nsteps necessary for preparing preliminary land acquisition and resettlement investigations. The \nframework  guides  infrastructure  proposals,  land  acquisition  assessments,  preparation  and \nimplementation  of  plans  for  land  acquisition,  and  any  voluntary  contributions  for  small \ncommunity-level infrastructure rehabilitation and expansion. The procedures for land acquisition \nand compensation and voluntary land contribution will follow ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy  (1995)  and  government  regulations.  The  provisions  and  principles  adopted  in  this \nframework  and  in  any  subsequent  plans  will  supersede  the  provisions  of  the  relevant \ngovernment decrees and regulations currently in force in Indonesia wherever a gap exists.  \n \n4.  The framework will be embedded in the Project\u2019s operational manuals. Land acquisition \nwill be kept to a minimum, as the location of rural infrastructure will be determined through a \ncommunity-based  approach.  Site  selection  for  community  investments  will  be  made  in  full \nconsultation with people living on land (titled and nontitled holders). Screening of potential land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts on communities will follow the entitlement matrix in the \nframework, and will be built into the community decision-making process and addressed during \nthe preparation of the village investment plans. The social assessment will help to identify the \naffected people during the community facilitation process or preparation of the village mid-term \npoverty reduction plans. It also will help identify any special needs of indigenous peoples or other \ndisadvantaged groups (e.g., landless, poor, elderly, and disabled villagers and female-headed \nhouseholds).  \n \n5.  If land acquisition is required, community facilitators will work closely with the community \nto formulate a resettlement plan for an infrastructure proposal using the procedures outlined in \n ", "      Appendix 12  59\nthe  framework.  Voluntary  contributions  will  be  acceptable  only  if  (i)  there  has  been  full \nconsultation with landowners and any non-titled, affected people on site selection; (ii) voluntary \ndonations do not severely affect the living standards of affected people and are linked directly to \nbenefits for the affected people, with community-sanctioned measures to replace any losses \nthat  are  agreed  through  verbal  and  written  records  by  affected  people;  (iii)  the  voluntary \ndonation is confirmed through a verbal or written record and verified by an independent third \nparty; and (iv) adequate grievance redress mechanisms are in place. \n \n6.  The land acquisition and resettlement framework is based on the principles of the PNPM \nMandiri Program and states that:  \n  \n(i)  no affected people categorized as poor1 or vulnerable households as identified \nthrough social assessment will be allowed to donate their land or other economic \nassets for the project activity;   \n(ii)  no affected people categorized as poor or vulnerable households will be negatively \naffected, either directly or indirectly, by any project activity; \n(iii)  when  the  required  land  is  voluntarily  donated,  or  provided  through  another \nagreement as decided by the community, the detailed socioeconomic background \nof  and  project  impact  on  the  affected  people  will  be  carefully  recorded  and \nreported;  \n(iv)  in the case of land acquisition not involving voluntary donation, compensation will \nbe made by land-for-land or cash at replacement value; \n(v)  all project activities will comply with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) \nand are conducted and recorded accordingly; \n(vi)  all the required information will be provided in the short resettlement plan, which \nwill be integrated into the village proposal prepared by the community;  \n(vii)  the  resettlement  plan  will  be  endorsed  by  the  community  implementation \norganizations (CIOs), village head, and the executing agency, approved by ADB, \ndisclosed to the affected people, and uploaded to ADB\u2019s website before it can be \nimplemented; and  \n(viii)  before it is sent to ADB, the resettlement plan will be reviewed by a special \ncommittee accountable to the Government and ADB.  \n \n7.  Implementation  arrangements.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  will  have  overall \ncoordination responsibility for the resettlement activities in the subprojects. The existing PNPM \nMandiri Oversight Body will provide policy directives, guidance, monitoring, and managerial \noversight.  District  and  provincial  PIUs  will  ensure  project  activities  comply  with  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) during implementation. The PNPM Mandiri coordinating \nteams at the district level will review the resettlement plans and monitor their implementation. \nThe members of district PNPM Mandiri coordinating teams will include staff of various district \ngovernment  agencies,  members  of  local  legislative  bodies,  and  representatives  from  local \nnongovernment  organizations  or  universities.  Safeguards  consultants  will  be  hired  at  the \nnational,  provincial,  and  district  levels  to  assist  the  executing  agency  and  communities  in \nscreening  involuntary  resettlement  impacts,  preparing  resettlement  plans  and  undertake \nmonitoring.   \n \n                                                 \n1  Poor households have income levels that are below the respective provincial poverty line of the current year, as per \nthe Central Bureau of Statistics and/or identified by community members as poor households in their own community.  \n \n ", "60             Appendix 12 \n8.  Disclosure, consultation, and grievances. Before land acquisition, project impacts will \nbe discussed with all stakeholders, including the identified affected people. Project information \nand land acquisition procedures will be shared and disclosed to communities in accordance with \nADB's policy. Separate focus group discussions and community meetings with men and women \nwill be held, especially with the affected people. The CIOs will disseminate information on possible \nland acquisition and resettlement activities to the affected people through verbal communication \nand written materials in a language that is easily understood by them. All consultations will be \nrecorded and submitted as part of village investment plans. The framework, including complaint \nand grievance procedures, will be part of the project implementation guidelines. These will be \ndisseminated by the subproject facilitator to the communities during the facilitation process and \nproject implementation. Local government and CIO offices will have resettlement plan copies, \nwhich also will be posted on the ADB\u2019s website. \n \n9.  Affected people will have the right to file complaints and/or queries on any aspects of land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  activities.  Community  complaints  will  be  managed  following  the \nPNPM  Mandiri\u2019s  Implementation  Guidelines  on  Management  of  Complaints  and  Grievances, \nwhich  meets  ADB\u2019s  requirements  on  complaint  and  grievance  mechanisms  (Supplementary \nAppendix I). At the village level, complaints from any affected people can be filed with CIO \nmembers and local government staff for immediate resolution whenever possible. If the problem \ncannot be resolved, the CIO members and local government staff will assist the affected people to \nsubmit their complaints to the Project\u2019s grievance and redress committee at the district level and \nto the provincial and/or national level if desired. Community facilitators will record the complaint \nand report to the Project\u2019s management teams. The Project will dedicate staff at district, provincial, \nand national levels to receive and follow-up on complaints from affected people.  \n \n10.  The  members  of  the  grievance  and  redress  committee  will  include  affected  people \n(including representatives of women, the poor, and minority groups) and government officials with \nfunctional and legal authority. The committee will review grievances involving all resettlement \nbenefits or issues, except for disputes related to ownership. Grievances will be redressed two to \nfour weeks from the date of lodging the complaints at the district level and within eight weeks at \nthe provincial and/or national levels. If consensus cannot be reached, the dispute resolution will \nfollow Presidential Decree No.36/2005.2 The affected people may also file their complaint on the \nPNPM Mandiri website or via a written submission to the PNPM Mandiri administrator. \n \n11.  Monitoring and evaluation. The project M&E mechanism for land and social safeguard \nissues will be included in the internal monitoring and evaluation report prepared by Ministry of \nPublic Works. One section of the regular internal monitoring report will be dedicated to reporting \nand discussing issues related to social safeguards in project activities. The district PNPM Mandiri \ncoordinating teams will serve as the external monitoring agencies of the Project. The external \nmonitoring activities specifically focusing on land acquisition will be conducted twice a year during \nthe project implementation period. Monitoring reports will be submitted to ADB and uploaded to \nADB\u2019s website. \n \n12.  Cost  and  budget.  Costs  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be  provided  by \ncommunities  as  counterpart  contributions  or  from  the  community  development  grants. \nSafeguards  specialists  at  national,  provincial  and  district  levels  have  been  included  and \nbudgeted  for  in  the  consultant  packages. \n                                                 \n2  Affected peoples may complain to the district head or provincial governor in accordance with their respective scope \nand authority to change or validate decisions related to land acquisition and resettlement in project activities.  \n ", "      Appendix 13  61\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The  Project  will  support  the  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  National \nProgram for Community Empowerment (PNPM Mandiri). PNPM Mandiri adopts a community-\ndriven  development  (CDD)  approach  that  directly  channels  funds  to  community  groups. \nCommunity participants prioritize their development needs, control resources, and implement \nrural infrastructure projects. The Project will adopt a sector modality to identify and implement \nrural  infrastructure  activities  in  about  1,500  rural  villages  and  215  kecamatans  in  Jambi, \nLampung, Riau, and South Sumatra provinces in western Indonesia. The Project incorporates \nlessons  from  the  ongoing  Rural  Infrastructure  Support  to  the  PNPM  Mandiri  Project  (RIS-\nPNPM). \n \n2.  The  Project  is  categorized  as  environmental  category  B.  The  initial  environmental \nexamination was prepared for sample infrastructure interventions (Supplementary Appendix N). \nAs  the  Project  follows  a  sector-like  approach,  an  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework  (EARF)  has  been  prepared  to  guide  each  of  the  project  villages  to  carry  out \nenvironmental screening during the formulation of village rural infrastructure proposals and to \nfacilitate compliance with the environmental requirements of the Government and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) during project implementation (Supplementary Appendix O). \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n3.  The Project includes three outputs: (i) strengthened capacity for community planning and \ndevelopment; (ii) improved village services and infrastructure through community development \ngrants; and (ii) improved capacity for project implementation and monitoring and evaluation. The \nfirst output seeks to empower communities and strengthen their capacity to implement their \npriority programs. This output will also include activities to strengthen local government councils \nand the leadership that was formed under decentralization laws. The second output will provide \nblock grants to villages to respond to community rural infrastructure needs that have been \nidentified in village medium-term poverty reduction plans. Each project village will be awarded a \nblock grant of approximately $25,000 for rehabilitation and/or construction of small-scale rural \ninfrastructure.  Consistent  with  the  PNPM  Mandiri  guidelines,  the  community  will  select \ninvestments from an open menu, and may include feeder roads and pathways, bridges and \nculverts,  small  piers,  village  irrigation  schemes,  water  supply,  sanitation,  drainage  works, \nschools, health centers, community centers, and electricity. Most of the work will be carried out \nby  the  communities  themselves.  The  third  output  supports  project  management  and \nimplementation  support  at  national,  provincial  and  district  levels,  including  monitoring  and \nevaluation. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment  \n \n4.  The Project covers four provinces in western Indonesia: Jambi, Lampung, Riau, and \nSouth Sumatra. The project areas have a humid tropical climate with average annual rainfall of \n1,250 millimeters (mm)\u20132,300 mm. Temperatures range from 24\u00b0C to 32\u00b0C. There are several \nmajor river basins in each of the selected project provinces. The area includes peat swamps \nand freshwater swamp forests. Project provinces also have nature reserves and protected \nareas, including Bukit Barisan Selatan and Kerinci Seblat national parks. The four provinces are \nin the southern half of Sumatra Island, where the incidence of rural poverty is higher than the \nnational average. Most of the poor live in rural areas where agriculture is the main source of \n ", "62             Appendix 13 \nlivelihood.  The  lack  of  adequate  infrastructure  hampers  social  services  and  economic \nopportunities.  \n \nD.  Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n5.  Due to the small scale of expected civil works, most of the environmental impacts are \nshort-term and temporary, and easily mitigated to acceptable levels. Such impacts include  \n(i) site-specific impacts, including excavation of construction materials; (ii) impacts on water \navailability and quality, (iii) construction impacts, and (iv) operation impacts.  \n \n6.  Most of the rehabilitation and upgrading work for roads will be within the existing right-of- \nway. The existing environmental screening checklist being implemented by the PNPM Mandiri \nwill exclude any infrastructure interventions that would directly affect protected, conservation, or \narcheologically  significant  areas.  Construction  materials  will  be  procured  locally.  Close \ncoordination with the local government units in charge of the environment will be sought to \nmonitor any illegal excavation activities in the river or embankment areas.  \n \n7.  A site for a drinking water supply system will be kept at least 10 meters from septic tanks \nand leach fields to avoid any potential contamination of drinking water sources. Water quality \nsampling will be conducted before well or pipe water supply systems are built to ensure that \ngroundwater and surface drinking water will meet drinking water quality standards. District \nengineers will provide technical inputs to ensure adequate water distribution from the secondary \nto tertiary canals and to avoid any downstream impacts caused by reduced flow and increased \npollution levels.   \n \n8.  Any  impacts  will  be  temporary  and  can  be  minimized  by  the  mitigation  measures \nspecified in the existing government guidelines for construction of community-based civil works. \nConstruction activities will be avoided during the rainy season as much as possible. Before \nconstruction,  communities  will  receive  technical  training  from  the  community  facilitators  in \nappropriate design, construction methods, and operation practices.    \n \n9.  Communities will be responsible for properly maintaining improved facilities and an \noperation and maintenance (O&M) plan is one of the eligibility requirements for each village. \nO&M  activities  will  be  fully  implemented  and  partly  financed  by  the  communities.  District \ngovernments will also monitor surface and groundwater quality through their ongoing monitoring \nprograms. \n \nE.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n \n10.  Public consultations were conducted in potential districts for RIS-PNPM in February, \nMay, and June 2008; and in May and June 2009 during field visits to Ogan Ilir District in South \nSumatra Province. The main purposes of the field visits were to (i) meet provincial and district \ngovernment officials from planning, public works, and environmental agencies, and community \nimplementation  organizations  (CIOs)  and  villagers;  \n(ii)  review  completed  community  infrastructure  investments  implemented  under  the  Rural \nInfrastructure Sector Project (RISP)1 to learn from their experiences, including environmental \nscreening and management during the preparation and implementation phases; and (iii) visit the \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Rural Infrastructure Support Project. Manila. \n \n ", "      Appendix 13  63\nvillages  likely  to  be  included  under  the  Project  to  review  the  sites  and  assess  general \ninfrastructure needs.   \n \n11.  District and provincial government officials, and CIO members support the RIS-PNPM \nand the overall PNPM Mandiri. The main concerns raised during the consultations included the \nneed  for  a  short  preparation  period  to  identify,  select,  and  implement  infrastructure \ninterventions;  potential  contamination  of  drinking  water  sources;  and  construction  activities \nduring the rainy season. All of these concerns have been addressed in the project design by \nextending  the  community  preparation  period  to  at  least  6  months;  and  including  siting \nrequirements for the water supply system and sanitation facilities, and drinking water quality \ntesting requirements in the environmental screening criteria. Since public consultation is an \nintegral part of the village planning and implementation process, continuous dialogue will be \ncarried out during project implementation.   \n \nF.  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (EARF) \n \n12.  An EARF has been prepared to guide the screening of subprojects, set out institutional \narrangements  in  relation  to  environmental  management  and  monitoring,  and  define \nenvironmental assessment requirements that comply with the applicable laws and regulations of \nthe Government and with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines.   \n \n13.  Since the Project will be implemented as part of PNPM Mandiri, it will use the existing \nprogram\u2019s implementation mechanisms. The Ministry of Public Works through its Directorate \nGeneral of Human Settlements will be the executing agency for the Project and will establish a \nproject  coordination  and  monitoring  unit  (PCMU)  at  the  national  level.  The  PCMU  will  be \nresponsible for the management, coordination, and monitoring of project activities. The Project \nwill utilize the existing project implementation units (PIUs) established at the national, provincial, \nand district levels under the respective PNPM Mandiri coordination teams. Each participating \nvillage will establish a CIO or utilize an existing community organization.  \n \n14.  Environmental  responsibility  will  mainly  reside  with  a  CIO,  assisted  by  a  team  of \ncommunity facilitators. CIOs will be responsible for conducting environmental screening and \nidentifying mitigation measures. Community facilitators will receive technical training before \nproject  implementation  in  order  to  provide  appropriate  technical  awareness  to  each  CIO. \nSafeguards specialists will be recruited at the national and regional levels to assist community \nfacilitators, provincial and district PIUs, and the PCMU in managing the Project\u2019s environmental \naspects. The existing guidelines for community-based civil works developed under the RISP \nand to be used under the Project, and the technical guidelines developed by the Ministry of \nPublic  Works  for  PNPM  Mandiri,  have  specific  provisions  to  ensure  environmental \nconsiderations in design, construction, and operation.    \n \nG.  Conclusion \n \n15.  The Project will have significant positive impacts on the quality of life and environment of \nthe project communities. Potential negative impacts associated with the design, construction \nand operation of the proposed subproject activities will be temporary, minor, localized in extent, \nand can be mitigated to acceptable levels. The EARF will provide adequate guidance to screen \nsubprojects,  determine  the  appropriate  mitigation  measures  for  any  identified  negative \nenvironmental  impacts,  and  implement  environmental  management  and  monitoring  during \nproject  implementation.  It  has  been  determined  that  a  detailed  environmental  impact \nassessment is not warranted for any of the village infrastructure proposals.  \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20091021123212+08'00'", "Subject": "Reports and Recommendations of the President", "Author": "md2", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "RRP: INO 38385, Indonesia, Mandiri, rural infrastructure ", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20091113164301+08'00'", "Title": "Rural Infrastructure Support to the PNPM Mandiri Project II"}}
