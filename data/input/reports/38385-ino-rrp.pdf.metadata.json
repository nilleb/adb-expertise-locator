The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  is  currently  supporting  PNPM  Mandiri \nthrough the Rural Infrastructure Support to PNPM Mandiri  Project \nfacilitation  and \n(RIS-PNPM),  which \nmobilization, and rural infrastructure support in the four provinces \nof  Jambi,  Lampung,  Riau,  and  South  Sumatra.  The  Project  will \ncontinue the support for RIS-PNPM, financing two cycles of village \nplanning  and  block  grants  in  about  1,500  villages  in  215 \nkecamatans \nfollow  a \ncommunity-driven  development  approach  and  will  empower \ncommunities;  strengthen \nto  prioritize,  design, \nimplement,  and  monitor  community-based  projects;  and  provide \nblock grants to finance community-identified needs and priorities.  \n \nPoverty is particularly high in rural areas of Indonesia, where more \nthan  two-thirds  of  the  country's  poor  people  live.  The  causes  of \nrural  poverty  include  lack  of  access  to  basic  services  such  as \nhealth,  education,  safe  water,  and  sanitation;  absence  of \neconomic  opportunities;  limited  access  to  capital;  and  poor  rural \nconnectivity  and  infrastructure.  The  rural  population  is  vulnerable \nto  external  shocks  and  the  large  numbers  of  \"near  poor\"  are  at \nrisk  of  falling  back  into  poverty  in  the  event  of  sickness,  natural \ndisaster, harvest failure, rising food prices, or economic recession. \nThey  also  have  extremely  limited  access  to  basic  services  (e.g., \nhealth and education), capital, and infrastructure.

To  meet \n\nThe  Government  of  Indonesia  has  made  poverty  reduction  a \npriority.  Its  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  (RPJM)  2004\u20132009 \nprovides strategic directions for addressing poverty and achieving \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Government has \nalso  issued  a  poverty  reduction  action  plan  in  line  with  the \nNational  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (SNPK),  which  emphasizes \nincreasing  employment  opportunities  and  accelerating  poverty \nreduction.  To  promote  further  inclusive  growth,  the  Government \nlaunched a nationwide poverty reduction program in August 2006: \nthe  National  Program  for  Community  Empowerment  (PNPM \nMandiri).  PNPM  Mandiri  aims  to  reduce  poverty  by  promoting \ncommunity \nand \nmanagement, and delivery of basic services to achieve the MDG \ntargets by 2015. \n \nADB's  Indonesia  country  strategy  and  program,  2006\u20132009 \nconcludes  that  the  country's  principal  challenge  continues  to  be \npoverty  reduction  and  eliminating  the  vulnerability  of  large \nsections  of \nthe \nGovernment  must  achieve  higher  levels  of  sustainable  economic \ngrowth,  improve  public  sector  management,  boost  development \nspending,  and  accelerate  progress  toward  achieving  the  MDGs. \nStrengthening  institutional  and  human  capacities  at  all  levels  is \nneeded to realize the development objectives and improve social \nservice delivery. ADB's growing experience with community-based \nprojects places it in a strategic position to support the Government \nin  scaling  up  and  effectively  implementing  the  PNPM  Mandiri \nProgram. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  impact  is  reduced  poverty  and  improved  local \ngovernance of rural communities in the project areas, which is in \nline  with  the  overall  objective  of  PNPM  Mandiri.  The  expected \noutcome  is  improved  access  to  service  delivery  and  basic  rural \ninfrastructure  for  the  poor,  near  poor,  and  women  in  the  project \ncommunities. \n \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $113.5  million, \nincluding  taxes  and  duties  equivalent  to  $0.55  million.  The  total \ncost  includes  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  interest  and \nother charges during implementation. \n \n\nthis  challenge, \n\n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nBeneficiaries (in kind \ncontribution) \n \n\n \n\nTotal \n84.2 \n21.8 \n\n7.5 \n113.5 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n% \n74.2 \n19.2 \n\n6.6 \n100.0 \n\n \n\n \n\nii \n \n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nExecuting Agency \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\niii\n\n \n\nA loan of $84.2 million from the ordinary capital resources of ADB \nwill  be  provided.

In  accordance  with  the \nGovernment  Regulation  on  Financial  Management  and \nResponsibility in the Implementation of De-concentration and Co-\nadministration  (PP  No.  7/2008),  the  Project  will  be  financed \nthrough the central government budget. \n \n1 April 2010\u201330 September 2013 \n \n31 March 2013 \n\n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  as  part  of  the  PNPM  Mandiri \nprogram and will use that program\u2019s implementation mechanisms. \nThe  project  coordination  and  monitoring  unit  at  the  national  level \nwill  be  responsible  for  the  management,  coordination,  and \nmonitoring of project activities. Provincial- and district-level project \nimplementation units will provide social and technical facilitation to \nthe communities to support them in improving village services and \ninfrastructure \nthrough  community  development  grants.  The \nexisting  PNPM  Mandiri  Oversight  Body  will  provide  policy \ndirectives,  guidance,  monitoring,  and  managerial  oversight  to  the \nProject.  \n \nDirectorate  General  of  Human  Settlements,  Ministry  of  Public \nWorks. \n \nAll  goods  and  related  services  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  will \nbe  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nThe  Project  will  require  an  estimated  1,928  person-months  of \nnational consulting services. The relatively large consulting inputs \nare needed for capacity building, assistance to support the highly \ndecentralized \nintensive \ninteraction  with  village  communities.

It  will  target  poor  and  isolated \nvillages that lack basic services and infrastructure. The community \ninvestments  are  expected  to  reduce  time  and  costs  spent  on \nobtaining water, diminish the incidence and severity of waterborne \ndiseases,  increase  the  availability  and  accessibility  of  education \nand  health  services  for  the  rural  poor  and  near  poor,  improve \naccess  to  services  and  markets,  and  provide  opportunities  to \nimprove incomes and welfare through increased employment and \nincome-earning  opportunities.  The  capacity  development  and \ncommunity \ninvestments  will  support  community \nempowerment,  build  social  capital,  and  improve  local  level \ngovernance, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of \nservices at the local level. The Project will include specific actions \nto  promote  gender  equity,  including  innovative  features  such  as \nseparate women's group meetings to ensure that women's needs \nare  adequately  reflected  in  village  plans,  and  gender  audits  for \neach selected community investment to ensure that it reflects the \nneeds of men and women.  \n \nThe  main \ninadequate \nimplementation  capacity  at  the  local  level,  (ii)  elite  capture  and \nbenefits  accruing  to  a  few  nonpoor,  (iii)  corruption,  and  (iv)  low \nsustainability  of  the  policies  and  investments.

The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nFrom  1970  to  1996,  Indonesia  successfully  reduced  poverty  incidence  from  more  than \n50% to less than 18%.  However, the 1997\u20131998 Asian crisis unraveled the progress that had \nbeen  achieved  and  poverty  incidence  increased  to  more  than  40%  in  1998.  This  led  the \nGovernment to scale up its efforts to fight poverty, and as a result the number of poor people \ndecreased  to  pre-crisis  levels  by  2004.  By  2009,  poverty  incidence  had  decreased  further  to \n14.2%.  Despite  these  gains,  33  million  people  remain  poor,  poverty  incidence  is  substantially \nhigher than the national average in many parts of the country, and nearly 50% of the country's \npopulation is categorized as \"near poor,\" living on less than $2 a day.1  \n \nThe Government of Indonesia has made poverty reduction a priority in its Medium-Term \n3. \nDevelopment  Plan  (RPJM),  2004\u20132009,  which  incorporates  key  elements  of  the  National \nPoverty Reduction Strategy (SNPK) and highlights the importance of achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). The RPJM targets an increase in economic growth to 7.6% and a \nreduction  in  \"open  unemployment\"2 to  5.1%  by  2009.    It  also  aims  to  halve  the  percentage  of \nthose  below  the  national  poverty  line  to  8.2%  by  2009,  increase  school  enrollment rates  at all \nlevels and reduce illiteracy to 5%. Other targets for the 2004\u20132009 period include an increase in \nlife expectancy from 66.2 to 70.6 years, a decline in infant mortality from 35 to 26 per 100,000 \nlive  births,  and  a  reduction  in  malnutrition  among  children  under  5  from  26%  to  20%.  To \naccelerate poverty reduction, the Government has issued a poverty reduction action plan in line \nwith  the  SNPK.  The  action  plan  has  five  focal  areas:  (i)  job  creation  and  poverty  reduction \nprograms;  (ii)  macroeconomic  stability  with  stable  prices,  fiscal  sustainability,  and  financial \nsector  reforms;  (iii)  acceleration  of  investment,  exports,  and  tourism  through  reforms  aimed  at \ncreating a healthy business climate and flexible markets; (iv) improved access to and quality of \neducation  and  health;  and  (v)  infrastructure  development  and  improved  efficiency  of  public \nservices, along with expanded private sector participation.  \n \n4. \nIndonesia  has  expanded  strongly  since  recovering  from  the  Asian  crisis  and  was  on \ntrack to meeting many of the RPJM targets before the current economic slowdown. Economic \ngrowth had accelerated to a 10-year high of 6.3% in 2007 and remained robust at 6.1% in 2008, \ndespite  unstable  global  financial  markets  and  a  slowing  world  economy.  However,  economic \ngrowth decreased to 5.2% year-on-year in the final quarter of 2008 as the global slowdown cut \ninto exports and manufacturing. Subdued domestic and external demand is expected to further \ndecelerate  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  in  2009.  While  inflation  has  eased  from \ndouble-digit  rates  and  improved  macroeconomic  management  and  a  stronger  financial  sector \nhave  enabled  the  country  to  avoid  the  most  severe  impacts  of  the  current  crisis,  an  overall \neconomic slowdown is expected in the short term. It is therefore likely that many of the RPJM \ntargets will not be met.  \n\n                                                 \n1  In purchasing power parity terms. \n2  Share of the labor force who are not working and are actively looking for work.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n \n5. \nThe  current  global  economic  recession  may  lead  to  additional  strains  on  the  poor  and \nincrease  the  vulnerability  of  the  near  poor,  as  economic  growth  stagnates  and  unemployment \nand  underemployment  rise.  Unemployment  is  forecast  to  rise  above  9%  as  layoffs  spread \ndomestically  and  more  overseas  workers  lose  their  jobs  and  return  home.  More  people  will \nprobably be pushed into the informal sector\u2014which already accounts for about two-thirds of the \nlabor force\u2014where wages are low and jobs not secured. Protecting the poor and reducing the \nvulnerability of the population living on less than $2 a day will be a high priority as these groups \nare vulnerable to even small income losses. \n \nB. \n \nInequity  and  high  levels  of  rural  poverty.  The  SNPK  identified  the  major  causes  of \n6. \npoverty,  including  lack  of  access  to  affordable  quality  food;  lack  of  access  to  quality  health \nservices;  lack  of  access  to  quality  education  services;  limited  employment  and  business \nopportunities; lack of access to housing and sanitation services; lack of access to clean water; \nand  lack  of  participation.  All  these  causes  are  related  to  lack  of  access  to  various  forms  of \ncapital and infrastructure\u2014human, physical, social, financial, and natural.  \n \n7. \nPoverty is particularly high in rural areas, where the majority of the population and more \nthan two-thirds of poor people live. Poverty incidence continues to be much higher in rural areas \n(17.4%)  than  in  urban  areas  (10.7%). 3  Disparities  between  and  within  regions  are  also \nsignificant.  While  the  provinces  with  the  highest  poverty  incidence  rates  are  in  the  outlying \nregions of the country, the provinces in Java and Sumatra tend to have the greatest number of \npoor  people.  In  terms  of  absolute  numbers  of  poor,  Java,  which  has  58%  of  the  Indonesian \npopulation, accounted  for  55%  of  the  poor  in  2008  (19.2  million  people).  Other  provinces  with \nvery  large  number  of  poor  in  2008  were  North  Sumatra  (1.6  million),  Lampung  (1.6  million), \nSouth  Sumatra  (1.2  million),  South  Sulawesi  (1.1  million),  Aceh  (1.1  million),  East  Nusa \nTenggara  (1.1  million)  and  West  Nusa  Tenggara  (1.1  million).  These  seven  provinces  alone \naccounted for about 25% of Indonesia\u2019s poor in 2008.4  \n \n8. \nGiven  such  disparities  across  areas  and  provinces,  national  figures  that  show  solid \nprogress toward achieving the MDGs (particularly those related to poverty reduction, education, \ngender equality and child mortality) conceal gaps and an overall level of underdevelopment in \nmany  regions.  While  national  figures  show  high  levels  of  access  to  primary  education  for \nchildren aged 7 to 12, children in rural areas are 20% less likely to enrol and stay in school than \ntheir  urban  counterparts.  Indonesia's  health  challenges  are  also  great,  with  an  estimated \n582,000 new cases of tuberculosis each year, concentrated in poorer and less developed areas.   \nSignificant  challenges  in  the  health  sector  are  also  reflected  in  persistently  high  maternal \nmortality ratios: in Indonesia, there are 420 deaths per 100,000 live births, compared with 45 in \nthe People's Republic of China, 62 in Malaysia, 110 in Thailand, and 230 in the Philippines.5 \n \n9. \nLimited  access  to  service  delivery  and  rural  infrastructure.  For many years before \nthe  Asian  crisis,  Indonesia  successfully  used  infrastructure  investments  to  support  poverty \nreduction  and  economic  development.  However,  the  crisis  resulted  in  the  cancellation  or \ninfrastructure  projects.  Subsequent \nsuspension  of  many  planned  public  and  private \n\n                                                 \n3  Government of Indonesia, Central Bureau of Statistics, 2008.

Jakarta.  \n4  Lampung and South Sumatra are RIS-PNPM provinces.\u00a0 Riau and Jambi had 527,500 and 249,700 poor people in \n\n2009, respectively. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n5  World Health Organization Statistical Information System (available: www.who.int/whosis).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\ngovernments had to prioritize the more urgent tasks of financial sector restructuring and fiscal \nconsolidation.  As  a  result,  infrastructure  investments,  which  accounted  for  more  than  6%  of \nGDP  before  1997,  fell  to  a  low  of  2%  in  2000  and  have  only  reached  3%  in  recent  years, \nreflecting  a sharp  decline  in  public and  private spending.6 Since  1997,  only  basic preservation \nand maintenance of infrastructure have taken place, with minimal expansion. \n \n10. \nAs  a  result,  infrastructure  and  service  coverage  remains  low  by  regional  standards.  In \n1996, the overall quality of Indonesia's infrastructure exceeded that of the People's Republic of \nChina  and Thailand.  However,  today  these  countries  have  overtaken  Indonesia,  which  ranked \n54th  in  a  2007  survey  of  131  countries.7 About  50  million  Indonesians  lack  access  to  treated \nwater,  90  million  lack  access  to  electricity,  and  nearly  200  million  are  not  connected  to  a \nsewerage  network.  While  3.5  million  new  customers  were  connected  to  electricity  in  1997,  in \nrecent  years  about  1  million  new  customers  have  been  connected  annually,  making \nachievement of the targeted 90% electrification ratio in 2020 unlikely. Indonesia has the lowest \nroad  density  in  Southeast  Asia  in  terms  of  length  per  area  or  population,  and  rural  roads  are \ndeteriorating because of inadequate maintenance. \n \n11. \nThe  availability  of  infrastructure  services  in  rural  areas,  particularly  outside  Java  and \nBali, is significantly below the national average. About 54% of rural villages are not connected \nby  asphalt  roads  and  more  than  15%  of  all  villages  are  inaccessible  even  by  four-wheel-drive \nvehicles at certain times of the year. Poor roads or no roads mean that government services are \ninaccessible and the high transportation cost in these communities is a major cause of poverty. \nSo is lack of water and sanitation: only 15% of rural households have access to drinking water \nfrom  piped  or  pumped  sources,  and  just  21%  have  septic  tanks  for  disposal  of  human  waste. \nThese low levels of access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities contribute to \nthe high incidence of waterborne diseases\u2014diarrhea is the second-largest cause of death and \nstunted  growth  among  young  children.  Access  to  quality  health  and  education  services  is \nparticularly limited in rural and remote areas.    \n \n12. \nThe four project provinces of Jambi, Lampung, Riau and South Sumatra have high rural \npoverty and unequal access to infrastructure. The provinces contained a total of almost 4 million \npoor  people  in  2009.  South  Sumatra  (16%)  and  Lampung  (20%)  had  poverty  incidence  well \nabove the national average. Fewer than 60% of households have access to safe water supply. \nSouth  Sumatra  (53%)  and  Lampung  (54%)  have  low  school  enrollment  rates  for  upper \nsecondary  school  and  Riau  (9.35%)  and  South  Sumatra  (8.45%)  have  higher  than  national \naverage unemployment rates. Profiles of the project provinces are in Supplementary Appendix \nA.  \n \n13. \nDecentralization.  To  improve  service  delivery  and  local  development,  Indonesia \nembarked  on  a  radical  and  rapid  decentralization  program  in  2001,  transferring  much  of  the \nresponsibility for delivery of public services to the local level and almost doubling districts' share \nin government spending. An intergovernmental fiscal framework, using block grants,8 replaced a \nsystem of largely earmarked grants. Law 22/1999 on Regional Government9 and Law 25/1999 \non  Fiscal  Balance  between  the  Region  and  the  Center10 gave  broad  autonomy  to  the  districts \n\n                                                 \n6  World Bank. 2007.

By comparison, Thailand was \n\nranked 28th, and the People's Republic of China, 34th.  \n\n8  A block grant is a fixed sum of money with general provisions as to the way it is to be spent; here, it refers to grants \n\nfor communities that can be used to address a wide range of community development needs. \n\n9  This law was amended by Law 32/2004. \n10  This law was amended by Law 33/2004. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\n(kabupatens)  in  all  but  a  few  areas  that  are  explicitly  assigned  to  the  province  and  center \n(defense,  security,  justice,  foreign  affairs,  fiscal  affairs,  and  religion).  The  goal  was  to  make \ngovernments  more  responsive  and  accountable  to  the  people  and  to  increase  transparency. \nDecentralization  brought  increased  resources  to  local  governments,  including  rights  to  collect \ntaxes  and  to  draw  revenues  from  natural  resource  exploitation.  At  the  same  time,  they  were \nassigned  key  functions  and  responsibilities  for  financing  and  delivery  of  services,  including \nhealth, education, public works, environment, communications, agriculture, capital investments, \nland, cooperatives, and infrastructure services. In 2001, 2.3 million civil servants and more than \n20,000  government  properties  were  transferred  from  central  to  local  governments  to  enable \nlocal governments to carry out decentralized functions. As a result, local governments currently \nmanage about 30% of total government expenditures.   \n \nDespite  early  problems,  there  have  been  significant  gains  from  the  decentralization \n14. \nprocess.  Provincial,  district  and  municipal  governments  are  becoming  more  responsive  to  the \nneeds of local communities and open public debates have begun to flourish.11 However, while in \ntheory the new regulations should make local planning processes more efficient, effective, and \nresponsive  by  integrating  community  aspirations  with  national,  regional  and  sectoral  policies \nand  plans,  in  reality  the  capacity  of  district  governments  to  provide  equitable  and  accessible \nservices remains limited. Other issues include inadequate consideration of local aspirations and \nneeds  in  planning  processes,  especially  of  poor  people;  limited  synergy  between  programs  in \ndifferent  sectors;  and  a  disproportionately  high  proportion  of  regional  budgets  allocated  to \nadministrative rather than development activities.  \n \nThe  Indonesia  country  gender  assessment  (2006) 12  found  that  decentralization \n15. \nrepresented both challenges and opportunities for women. In general, women's representation \nin  public  decision-making  remains  limited  and  in  some  areas  decentralization  has  been \naccompanied  by  a  revival  of  conservative  religious  interpretations  of  gender  roles  and \ndiscriminatory  local  customary  laws.  However,  some  local  governments  have  begun  to  view \nwomen  as  important  stakeholders,  actively  creating  programs  to  promote  women's  rights.  In \nsome  cases,  the  devolution  of  budget  processes  to  local  government  institutions  has  led  to \nopportunities  for  greater  involvement  by  citizens,  including  women,  resulting  in  more  gender-\nresponsive  and  pro-poor  budgets.  More  women  are  now  holding  government  positions;  in  the \n2006 elections, six regions elected women as the regional head, and 11 elected women as the \ndeputy regional head.13  \n \n16. \nCapacity  development  for  local  governments  so  they  can  assume  their  responsibilities \nremains  one  of  the  key  challenges  of  decentralization.  The  problem  is  most  evident  at  the \ndistrict and municipal levels. Local communities themselves also require capacity development, \nas  they  tend  to  lack  information  about  development  plans,  budget  allocations,  and  their \nentitlements to social services. For example, a 2004 governance and decentralization survey 14 \nundertaken  in  32  districts  of  eight  provinces  revealed  that  three-quarters  of  poor  respondents \nwere  unaware  that  there  were  channels  for  expressing  concerns  regarding  service  delivery. \nDespite  this,  service  delivery  was  generally  thought  to  have  improved  since  decentralization. \nNearly  two  thirds  of  respondents  identified  improvements  in  public  health  services  and  60% \nnoted improvements in public education.  \n\n                                                 \n11  World Bank and Gajah Mada University, 2004. Governance and Decentralization Survey. \n12   ADB. 2006. Indonesia: Country Gender Assessment. Manila.  \n13  In the 2009 parliamentary elections, women were elected to 93 seats (16.6%). \n14  The governance and  decentralization survey  is part of the Indonesian  decentralization  empirical  analysis (IDEA)  \nproject,  conducted  by  the  World  Bank  together  with  the  Centre  for  Public  and  Policy  Studies  at  Gajah  Mada \nUniversity (available: http://www.gds-indonesia.com). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\nCommunity-driven  development  (CDD)  and  government  strategy  for  poverty \n17. \nreduction.  CDD  was  introduced  in  Indonesia  in  1998,  in  the  midst  of  the  Asian  crisis  and \npolitical upheaval that brought down the Suharto administration and broke down service delivery \nmechanisms. Previously, development processes were largely driven by appointed officials and \nthe  central  government.  These  processes  tended  to  exclude  participation,  particularly  by  the \npoor, in setting development priorities, and provided limited accountability for the performance \nof \nresponsible  authorities.  Many  poverty-reduction  programs  proved  unstable  and \nunsustainable.  Among  the  reasons for  failure  were  lack  of sufficient  attention  in  the  programs' \ndesign to the needs of the poor and the lack of local demand and ownership, resulting in service \ndelivery that often missed its intended targets. CDD was introduced as an alternative approach \nthat  sought  to  institutionalize  Indonesia's  rich  legacy  of  self-help,  community  mobilization  and \nresource pooling for grassroots socioeconomic development.  \n \n18. \nThe  CDD  approach  gives  communities  control  over  planning  decisions  and  investment \nresources  to  improve  service  delivery.  The  communities  control  the  resources,  and  funds  are \ntransferred directly to them, usually to community-managed bank accounts. The community also \nmanages project implementation, and generally goes through at least three project cycles, each \nconsisting of social preparation, planning, project development, implementation, and operations \nand maintenance. The process is designed to systematically mobilize local people so they can \nprioritize  their  development  needs,  design  activities,  seek  technical  assistance,  manage \nresources,  and  implement  and  sustain  development  actions.  This  organized  and  repeated \nexperience in collective action will enable poor villagers to help themselves and to engage local \ngovernments and national agencies. In the longer term, it is expected that villagers will take a \nmore active role in improving the delivery of other pro-poor services (Appendix 2).  \n \n19. \nEncouraged  by  the  success  of  CDD  programs  and  following  more  than  a  decade  of \nimplementation  experience,  the  Government  formally  adopted  CDD  for  the  Program  Nasional \nPemberdayaan  Masyarakat  (PNPM)  Mandiri, 15  a  nationwide  poverty  reduction  program \nlaunched in August 2006. PNPM Mandiri makes a commitment to expand coverage of CDD to \nall 6,408 kecamatans by the end of 2009, and aims to reduce poverty by promoting community \nparticipation  in  development  planning  and  management,  and  to  deliver  basic  services  and \ninfrastructure using the CDD approach. While some of the earlier CDD interventions bypassed \nlocal governments, PNPM Mandiri seeks to use the CDD approach both to improve local service \ndelivery  and  to  promote  local  governance  through  bottom-up  and  pro-poor  planning, \ncomplementing and furthering the decentralization process (Supplementary Appendix B).  \n \nPNPM  Mandiri  consists  of  PNPM  Core  (PNPM  Inti)  and  PNPM  Support  (PNPM \n20. \nPenguatan).  PNPM  Core  consists  of  five  major  CDD  and  empowerment  programs, 16 while \nPNPM  Support  consists  of  the  sectoral  program  activities  of  technical  ministries  that  provide \nsupport  to  poor  communities.  The  PNPM  Mandiri  will  remain  a  national  program  at  least  until \n2015.  Following  scaling-up  of  the  program  to  nation-wide  coverage  in  2009,  the  program  will \nmove into a sustaining mode in 2010, under which additional cycles for kecamatans and villages \nwill be provided. Each kecamatan will be eligible to receive at least three cycles of community \nplanning  and  block  grants.  Local  governments  will  take  on  greater  responsibility  for \nimplementation  than  in  previous  CDD  projects.  The  Government  also  expects  to  increasingly \n\n                                                 \n15 The National Program for Community Empowerment \n16 These include RIS-PNPM (ADB), KDP (World Bank), Urban Poverty Program (World Bank), Support for Poor and \nDisadvantaged  Areas  (World  Bank),  and  Regional  Infrastructure  for  Social  and  Economic  Development  Project \n(JBIC).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nbring supply-side initiatives from health, education, rural development, and other sectors under \nthe PNPM umbrella to maximize complementarities for poverty reduction.  \n \n21. \nPNPM Mandiri has expanded rapidly over the past 3 years. It covered 2,361 kecamatans \nin 2007 and 4,768 in 2008. In 2009, it is being implemented in 33 provinces, 465 districts, and \n6,408 kecamatans, at a total cost of about $1.5 billion. The Government is expected to provide \nalmost  50%  of  the  funding  requirement  from  its  own  resources.17 The  current  ADB-supported \nRural  Infrastructure  Support  to  PNPM-Mandiri  Project  (RIS-PNPM)18 covers  about  4%  of  the \ntotal cost of PNPM-Mandiri in 2009, and the Project will cover about 7.5% of the total costs in \n2010 and 2011.   \n \n22. \nIndonesian  agencies  have  years  of  experience  of  implementing  CDD  approaches.  The \nNational Planning Development Agency (BAPPENAS) is responsible for development planning \nand coordination of poverty reduction programs and policies, and is considered the champion of \nCDD. The Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) have been the main \nexecuting agencies of CDD projects. These agencies remain key partners in the PNPM Mandiri \nOversight  Body,  which  was  created  to  provide  policy  directives,  guidance,  and  managerial \noversight to the program. It is chaired by the coordinating minister for People's Welfare (Menko \nKesra) and its members include the state ministers of BAPPENAS and less developed regions; \nand  the  ministers  of  finance,  home  affairs,  public  works,  and  social  development.  At  the \nprovincial  and  district  levels,  there  are  multiagency  steering  committees,  chaired  by  provincial \ngovernors and district heads and with similar coordinating and monitoring functions to those of \nthe  Oversight  Body.  They  comprise  the  heads  of  the  relevant  sector  agencies  and \nrepresentatives from local organizations. \n \n23. \nADB  sector  objectives  and  strategy.  ADB's  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP), \n2006\u20132009 aims to help the Government achieve higher levels of pro-poor sustainable growth \nand achieving the MDGs, as specified in its medium-term RPJM objectives. A major anticipated \noutcome of the CSP is the provision of basic infrastructure and support services to communities. \nThe Project is included as a firm project in the 2009 Indonesia country program.19  \n \n24. \nGiven its long experience with community-based projects in Indonesia, ADB is in a good \nstrategic position to support the Government in scaling up and effectively implementing PNPM \nMandiri.  ADB  also  has  significant  experience  of  local  governance  and  has  worked  with  the \nGovernment in planning and budgeting reforms that benefit the poor. Further, ADB's institutional \nknowledge  of  addressing  both  demand  and  supply  sides  of  citizen  engagement  and  service \ndelivery  will  help  strengthen  and  refine  the  PNPM  Mandiri  design  as  the  program  is  fully \ninstitutionalized. \n \n25. \nCurrently, ADB is supporting the Government's PNPM program through the RIS-PNPM, \napproved  in  September  2008.  The  RIS-PNPM  includes  support  for  community  facilitation  and \nmobilization, and block grants for rural infrastructure improvement in about 300 kecamatans and \n                                                 \n17 In  2009,  four  development  agencies  will  provide  loan  support  to  PNPM  Mandiri:  the  World  Bank,  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank,  Islamic  Development  Bank,  and  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation.  The  loans  from \ndevelopment partners will finance different geographical areas and periods of PNPM Mandiri implementation. Apart \nfrom loans, bilateral donors had provided grant support to the PNPM Support Facility (PSF) in the amount of $63.2 \nmillion by the end of March 2009. PSF support is mainly for technical assistance such as capacity building, studies, \nand monitoring and evaluation.  \n\n18 ADB.  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to \n\nIndonesia for the Rural Infrastructure Support to the PNPM Mandiri Project. Manila. \n\n19 Memorandum  of  understanding  between  the  Government  of  Indonesia  and  ADB  for  the  2009  country  program \n\nconfirmation mission, signed in Jakarta on 22 April 2009. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n1,700  villages  in  the  four  provinces  of  Jambi,  Lampung,  Riau,  and  South  Sumatra.  While  the \nPNPM  Mandiri  design  involves  three  cycles  of  village  planning  and  block  grants  in  each \nparticipating  kecamatan,  the  RIS-PNPM  covers  only  one  round  of  facilitation  and  village  block \ngrants. In addition, the investment choices for communities do not cover the full PNPM-Mandiri \nmenu but are limited to rehabilitation or construction of physical infrastructure.  \n \n26. \nTo  support  the  implementation  of  the  required  additional  cycles  for  villages  in  the  RIS-\nPNPM  kecamatans,  the  Government  has  asked  ADB  to  support  the  RIS-PNPM  to  cover  two \nadditional cycles of community facilitation and block grants. This will allow for full completion of \nthree cycles in the RIS-PNPM villages. In addition, it has asked that the Project adopt the full set \nof PNPM Mandiri guidelines, including its open menu for community investments. By adopting \nPNPM Mandiri's design, funding modality, and implementation structure, the Project will be fully \nconsistent with the Government's development program. This will ensure strong ownership and \ngreatly  improve  the  prospects  of  achieving  the  common  goals  of  improving  service  delivery, \nreducing poverty, and meeting MDG targets.  \n \nADB  and  other  external  assistance  to  community-driven  development.  CDD \n27. \nprojects have become the foremost instrument for poverty reduction, local capacity building, and \nservice  delivery  in  Indonesia.  ADB  has  funded  several  projects  with  CDD  features.  Between \n2001 and 2007, 11 out of 23 ADB loans to Indonesia had CDD features, corresponding to 21% \nof  the  total  loan  amount.  These  projects  included  (i)  Rural  Infrastructure  Support  Project, 20 \nwhich  rehabilitated  and  improved  rural  infrastructure  in  1,840  villages  in  45  districts  in  East \nJava,  East  Nusa  Tenggara,  South  East  Sulawesi,  and  South  Sulawesi  provinces;  (ii)  the \nCommunity  Water  Services  and  Health  Project, 21  which  provides  rural  water  supply  and \nsanitation to 1,000 communities in 20 districts and aims to improve district government capacity \nto  deliver  basic  water  and  sanitation  services,  strengthen  communities  to  take  primary \nresponsibility for such services, extend water and sanitation facilities to communities through a \ndemand-driven approach, and increase communities' awareness of health and hygiene; (iii) the \nCommunity  and  Local  Government  Support  Sector  Development  Program,22 which  improved \naccess  of  poor  communities  in  79  districts  to  basic  and  small  public  infrastructure  using  CDD \napproaches and improved local governments' capacity to manage CDD; and (iv) the Community \nEmpowerment  for  Rural  Development  Project, 23  which  supported  capacity  building  of  local \ngovernment  staff  and  villagers,  and  financed  a  development  planning  process  for  local \ndevelopment  needs.  The  assistance  has  supported  the  Government  to  provide  infrastructure \nsupport,  strengthen  rural  water  and  sanitation  services  and  irrigation  systems,  upgrade  slum \nneighborhoods, improve the income generation of the rural poor, and build social capital. \n \nThe  World-Bank-funded  Kecamatan  Development  Project  (KDP)24 started  in  1998  and \n28. \nwas  the  first  CDD  project  in  Indonesia.  A  total  of  $1.4  billion  of  loan,  grant  and  Government \nfunds  has  been  disbursed  for  three  phases  of  the  KDP.  Other  previous  projects  following  the \nCDD  approach  include  the  World  Bank-supported  Urban  Poverty  Project 25  and  Village \n\n                                                 \n20 ADB.  2005.

The World Bank is providing the largest funding \nsupport  to  PNPM  Mandiri  and  is  a  key  partner  of  the  Government,  together  with  ADB,  the \nIslamic Development Bank, and the Government of Japan.  \n \n29. \nIn  December  2007,  a  PNPM  Support  Facility  (PSF)  was  established  with  financial \ncontributions  from  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands,  the  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment,  AusAID,  Danish  International  Development  Assistance,  DANIDA,  and  the \nDepartment  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  DFID.  PSF  is  a  trust  fund \nchaired  by  the  Government  through  BAPPENAS  and  managed  by  the  World  Bank.  The \nobjective of PSF is to support the Government to provide effective leadership and management \nof PNPM Mandiri, including (i) better coordination across grants and among donors supporting \nthe program; (ii) stronger capacity at all levels to plan, manage and improve poverty reduction \nprograms;  (iii)  reduced  poverty  through  government  and  civil  society  partnerships;  and  (iv) \nstudies,  assessments,  and  better  monitoring  and  evaluation.  More  information  on  external \nassistance to the sector is in Appendix 3.  \n \n30. \nLessons  learned.  There  is  substantial  evidence  that  CDD  can  be  more  effective  in \nservice delivery than other approaches. Independent evaluations of the KDP\u2014the largest CDD \noperation  in  the  world\u2014indicate  an  average  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  more \nthan 50%, well above that for other non-CDD rural infrastructure projects implemented in similar \ngeographic  areas  of  the  country.  Infrastructure  built  under  CDD  projects  cost  about  40%  less \nthan similar works built through other procurement methods, while meeting quality standards.27 \nEvidence  also  indicates  that  CDD  is  likely  to  offer  better  cost  recovery  and  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  of  completed  infrastructure  facilities  and  services  because  of  community \nmembers' strong sense of ownership. CDD also provides better accountability and transparency \nin  decision  making  and  procurement.  Evidence  from  the  RISP  and  other  CDD  projects  shows \nthat the direct funds flow mechanism to communities has demonstrably reduced corruption and \nleakage. CDD improves poverty targeting and presents more opportunities for women and the \npoor  to  participate  effectively  in  community  and  local  governance  processes.  World  Bank \nreports indicate that more than 50% of the participants in village decision-making meetings are \npoor and 30\u201345% are women. About 70% of employment opportunities under CDD are provided \nto poor people.   \n \n31. \nThe Government's PNPM Mandiri design was formulated with assistance from its major \ndevelopment partners, and incorporates lessons from all recent CDD projects and programs in \nIndonesia. After more than a decade of experience, the key lessons for good project design and \nimplementation include (i) community control of decision-making over resources and investment \nchoices;  (ii)  adoption  of  a  block  grant  approach  and  simple  and  transparent  funds  flow \narrangements  with  direct  transfers  to  community  accounts;  (iii)  comprehensive  facilitation \nsupport  in  community  planning  and  preparation,  including  social  facilitators  to  provide \ninformation,  promote  participation,  and  train  villagers,  and  engineering  facilitators  to  oversee \ntechnical quality and help ensure that the design of civil works is appropriate and the quality is \nhigh;  (iv)  stronger  accountability  procedures,  such  as  public  disclosure  of  budgets  and \ncontracts;  (v)  village  management  of  funds  (including  bookkeeping),  procurement,  and \ntransparency  measures;  and  (vi)  training  for  communities  in  establishing  effective  O&M \n\n                                                 \n26 World Bank. 1995. Village Infrastructure Project. Washington, D.C. \n27 ADB\u2019s RISP demonstrated cost savings of 33%\u201350% compared  with similar contractor-executed projects. This is \npartly because of transparency measures in decision-making and resource allocation and the use of participatory \nprocesses that reduced corruption. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\nfor  each  cycle  of \n\nThe  ongoing  RIS-PNPM  has  made  a  good  start  and  project \n\nmechanisms.  Consistent  with  the  Government  thrust  to  have  a  single  strategy  for  community \nempowerment  and  poverty  reduction,  approaches,  guidelines  and  procedures  have  been \nharmonized  and  PNPM  Mandiri  is  supported  by  a  common  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E) \nframework,  grievance  redress  system,  management  information  system  (MIS)  and  training \npackages.  Building  on  years  of  successful  implementation  of  CDD  in  Indonesia,  the  design  of \nthe  Project  has  incorporated  the  above  lessons  and  has  adopted  the  common  guidelines  and \nprocedures. \n \nimplementation \n32. \narrangements  are  in  place  in  the  participating  provinces  and  districts.  Socialization  activities \npresenting  the  project  scope  and  its  procedures  have  been  undertaken,  and  facilitation  for \ncommunity  planning \nis  ongoing.  The  design  and  guidelines  emphasize  community \nempowerment  and  the  importance  of  community  facilitation.  However,  providing  a  thorough \nunderstanding  of  these  project  principles  to  provincial  and  district  staff,  consultants,  and \ncommunity facilitators has been challenging. There is a need to strengthen project sensitization \nat all levels, and to ensure adherence to the core principles of community empowerment. The \nProject  will  (i)  include  mechanisms  to  strengthen  project  sensitization;  (ii)  clearly  describe  the \nrequired  steps \ninvestments;  \n(iii)  undertake  performance  monitoring  of  provinces,  districts,  and  villages;  and  (iv)  introduce \nperformance reviews, and rewards and sanctions for provinces, districts and villages based on \ntheir performance. \n \n33. \nLessons  from  RIS-PNPM  indicate  that  a  stronger  process  for  selection  and  training  of \ncommunity  facilitation  is  needed.  This  will  be  addressed  through  more  detailed  terms  of \nreference  for  community  facilitators,  a  prolonged  and  more  detailed  training  program,  regular \nmeetings  between  community  facilitators  from  different  districts  to  share  experience  and \nlessons, and prioritization of local facilitators in the recruitment process. In addition, facilitators \nwill  now  receive  transportation  allowances.  Furthermore,  while  many  CDD  programs  used  to \nbypass  local  governments  to  promote  community  empowerment  and  grassroots  development, \nrecent  experience  shows  that  local  government  involvement  needs  to  increase.  The  Project \nrecognizes this, and will provide capacity building for local governments through training in key \nroles  related  to  project  implementation,  bottom-up  planning  and  pro-poor  budgeting,  and \nsupport  to  communities  for  O&M.  Finally,  ensuring  equal  participation  and  benefits  to  women \nremains  a  challenge.  The  Project  will  promote  gender  equity  and  ensure  that  women  will  be \nrepresented  in  community  organizations,  will  have  access  to  planning  and  budgeting \nopportunities,  and  will  be  key  project  stakeholders  and  beneficiaries.  The  above  lessons  have \nall  been  incorporated  into  the  project  design  and  are  further  described  in  each  of  the  project \noutputs.   \n \n \n\nfacilitation,  planning,  and  block  grant \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  reduced  poverty  and  improved  local  governance  in \n34. \nPNPM Mandiri areas. This is consistent with the overall objective of the PNPM Mandiri program. \nThe  expected  outcome  of  the  Project  is  improved  access  to  service  delivery  and  basic  rural \ninfrastructure  for  the  poor,  near  poor  and  women  in  the  project  communities.  The  Project  will \noperate  in  four  provinces  and  support  villages  located  in  36  kabupatens  (districts)  and  215 \nkecamatans (subdistricts).  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\nOutputs \n\nSelection of project kecamatans and villages. The Project will be implemented in the \n35. \nfour provinces of Jambi, Lampung, Riau and South Sumatra, all located in the southern half of \nSumatra. The PNPM Mandiri Oversight Body issues annual lists of the target  kabupatens and \nkecamatans for each project included under the PNPM Mandiri program. The Project has been \nallocated  215  kecamatans  for  2010  and  2011.  Of  these,  181  will  continue  coverage  started \nunder  RIS-PNPM,  while  34  will  be  new. 28 The  1,101  RIS-PNPM  2009  villages,  which  were \nselected  from  a  list  of  the  poorest  villages  in  the  country,  will  be  eligible  for  inclusion  in  the \nProject  based  on  their  satisfactory  performance  in  RIS-PNPM.  In  the  newly  added  34 \nkecamatans,  villages  will  be  selected  based  on  poverty  incidence  ranking  using  the  latest \navailable data.29 In total, about 1,500 villages in 215 kecamatans will be targeted for two cycles \nof  community  facilitation  and  block  grants.  The  concerned  provincial  and  district  governments \nwill  confirm  to  MPW  that  the  poorest  villages  are  selected  and  that  no  better-off  villages  are \nincluded. \n \nB.  \n \nThe  Project  will  have  the  following  outputs:  (i)  strengthened  capacity  for  community \n36. \nplanning and development, (ii) improved village services and infrastructure through community \ndevelopment grants, and (iii) improved capacity for project implementation and monitoring and \nevaluation.  \n \n37. \nOutput  1:  Strengthened  capacity  for  community  planning  and  development.  The \nProject  will  support  and  strengthen  community  participation,  empowerment  and  capacity  to \nprioritize,  design, \nimplement,  manage  and  monitor  community-based  projects.  Social \nmobilization and community facilitation are cross-cutting activities that will occur at all stages of \nthe  community  empowerment  process  and  are  key  for  ensuring  pro-poor  investments  and \nsustainability. Assistance will be provided to conduct community mobilization and facilitation at \nthe  village  level  and  to  identify  problems,  needs,  and  opportunities  for  local  development  and  \npoverty  reduction.  Capacity  building  will  also  be  extended  to  community  implementing \norganizations (CIOs) and communities to formulate village plans and related annual investment \nplans  for  funding  through  block  grants,  in  project  procurement  and  construction  activities, \nconduct  of  transparency  and  accountability  activities,  progress  and  financial  reporting, \nmonitoring, physical and financial audits, and O&M planning.   \n \n38. \nFollowing  the  PNPM  Mandiri  guidelines,  the  Project  will  deploy  facilitators  to  provide \nassistance and build the capacity of villagers. Community facilitators will be organized in teams, \neach  consisting  of  five  facilitators  (two  for  social  development,  two  for  technical  matters,  and \none  for  overall  project  management)  and  covering  up  to  seven  villages.  At  least  30%  of  the \ncommunity  facilitators  will  be  women.  With  the  assistance  of  these  facilitators,  villages  will:30  \n(i)  receive  information  about  the  Project  and  the  PNPM  Mandiri  program;  (ii)  conduct  village \n\n                                                 \n28 The 34 kecamatans will be added to correct for previous mistargeting that left some poor kecamatans uncovered. \n\nAll eligible kecamatans and villages allocated to the Project will thus be covered.  \n\n29 Village  Potential  Statistics/Potensial  Desa  (PODES)  and  Social  Protection  Program  Survey/Pendataan  Program \n\nPerlindungan Sosial (PPLS).  \n\n30 While the full facilitation and planning process that was undertaken in RIS-PNPM will not be repeated for villages in \nthe  second  cycle,  the  results  of  the  first  cycle  planning  process,  e.g.,  poverty  mapping,  priority  problems,  and \nMTPR\u2013will be reviewed in the selection of priority investments for project funding. Socialization will be repeated to \nintroduce or reintroduce RIS-PNPM approaches to the village, and to state or restate its objectives and emphasize \nhow its participatory approach is different from those of other infrastructure assistance programs.     \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\nsurveys  and  poverty  mapping; 31 (iii)  identify  problems,  needs  and  opportunities;  (iv)  assess \ncommunity implementation capacity and gaps; (v) develop planning mechanisms and decision-\nmaking  processes;  (vi)  formulate  village  medium-term  poverty  reduction  (MTPR)  plans;  \n(vii)  select  priority  investments  and  develop  corresponding  community  project  proposals, \nincluding  O&M  plans  with  corresponding  costing  and  budgets;  (viii)  implement  the  selected \ninvestments with block grant support and technical guidance; and (ix) implement O&M plans to \nensure  the  sustainability  of  the  completed  community  investments.  The  DGHS  will  execute  a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  with  each  participating  village,  specifying \nthe \nresponsibilities  of  the  village  and  the  Project  (Supplementary  Appendix  C). 32 The  MOU  will \nstipulate critical performance standards, such as support of the village government, commitment \nof  counterpart  contributions,  participation  rates  at  village  meetings  (including  targets  for  40% \nwomen participation and 50% of the poor), and anticorruption measures and other requirements \nfor the approval of proposals. Once the preconditions are met and the proposal is approved, the \nvillage and the district project implementation unit (DPIU) will enter into a contract reflecting the \nspecific arrangements and detailing the roles and responsibilities of each party. \n \nEach participating village will work with the project through a CIO, which can either be an \n39. \nexisting village organization (formal or informal) or a new project organization, as decided by the \nlocal village community through participatory meetings in the village. The CIO will comprise five \nmembers  elected  or  reconfirmed  by  the  community,  at  least  two  of  whom  will  be  women.  The \nCIO  will  be  approved  by  the  village  head  and  registered  with  the  district  satker,33 which  is  a \nprerequisite for opening a CIO bank account. All decisions made by the CIO will be validated in \nparticipatory village meetings with at least 50% household attendance, including at least 50% of \npoor households.  \n  \n  \n40. \nThis  output  will  also  support  activities  to  strengthen  local  government  capacity.  This \nsupports  the  current  PNPM  Mandiri  strategy  of  enabling  local  governments  to  adopt  the  CDD \napproach,  including  key  functions  and  implementation  roles,  for  delivering  services  to \ncommunities  once  they  have  developed  adequate  capacity  and  experience  with  the  program.  \nBuilding  on  lessons  from  an  ADB-financed  TA  on  Pro-poor  Planning  and  Budgeting 34,  the \nProject will provide significant capacity strengthening to prepare local governments for this task \nand  to  promote  the  sustainability  of  project  gains.  Particular  attention  will  be  given  to  local \ngovernment  units  involved  in  project  implementation,  including  the  provincial  and  district \nsteering  committees  and  the  provincial  project  implementation  units  (PPIUs)  and  DPIUs. \nCapacity  building  will  include  bottom-up  planning  and  pro-poor  budgeting,  particularly \nintegration of village plans into district plans and budgets, M&E, and financial management. This \nwill be delivered through orientation and workshops, short training courses on specific functions, \nand information and communication materials. The Project will include a partnership agreement \nto  be  signed  between  DGHS  and  district  governments, 35  immediately  following  project \norientation,  outlining  the  responsibilities  and  rights  of  the  districts  under  the  Project.  The \npartnership agreement is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n\n                                                 \n31  The  objective  of  poverty  mapping  is  to  ensure  the  inclusion  of  women,  indigenous  peoples  and  other  vulnerable \nand marginalized groups within the village. Community organizers will receive special training on the inclusion of all \ndisadvantaged community groups in empowerment and facilitation processes. \n\n32  The MOU and contract will be signed by the village head, the chiefs of all hamlets, and the CIO representing the \nvillage; and by the district satker representing the Government. The MOU signing will take place in the first village \nmeeting when the CIO is established, while the contract will be signed once the village proposal is approved. \n\n33  District working unit of MPW. \n34  ADB. 2005.

Block grants will be provided to villages to support investments in priority \nphysical, social and economic infrastructure to meet the local needs that were identified in the \nvillage  MTPR  plans.  Consistent  with  the  PNPM  Mandiri  guidelines,  the  menu  of  investment \nopportunities for communities will be open except for a short negative list of activities prohibited \nby the Government or ADB policies.36 The selection of community investments will be based on \nthe  guidelines  prepared  for  the  RIS-PNPM.  As  in  the  ongoing  RIS-PNPM  project,  the  block \ngrants will be transferred directly to community bank accounts specifically opened for the project \nand managed by the CIOs. \n \nThe Project will allocate two cycles of Rp250 million each37 (approximately $25,000) for \n42. \neach  participating  village  through  block  grants  for  about  1,500  villages  in  215  kecamatans. \nDuring each cycle, each village, based on its MTPR plan, will prioritize investments within this \ngiven  budget  envelope  and  choose  whether  to  finance  one  large  investment  or  two  or  more \nsmaller investments. Experience from PNPM Mandiri shows that the most common community \ninvestments  include  feeder  roads  and  bridges,  water  supply,  sanitation,  electrification,  and \nirrigation.38  \n \n43. \nThe CIO will take the lead in developing village investment plans, with assistance from \ncommunity  facilitators  and  the  DPIUs.  The  investment  plans  of  all  participating  villages  will  be \nreviewed  by  the  DPIU  to  identify  possibilities  for  intervillage  collaboration  and/or  the \ndevelopment of intervillage infrastructure. After the village investment plans have been reviewed \n(and possibly revised), the final designs and costs will be discussed and approved at a village \nassembly and submitted to the DPIU. Upon approval, a contract will be executed between the \nCIO and the DPIU and the first installment of the block grant will be released.  \n \n44. \nFor  a  village  proposal  to  be  approved  by  the  DPIU,  it  will  have  to  fulfill  the  following \ncriteria: (i) be a pro-poor investment that was endorsed in a community-wide meeting and that \nhas  significant  benefits  for  the  poor,  women,  and  minority  groups;  (ii)  have  potential  for \nimmediate utilization by the poor or near poor; (iii) have identified availability of land, with no or \nminimal  negative  environmental,  social,  or  economic  impacts;39 (iv)  have  evaluated  alternative \ndesigns  and  established  the  cost-effectiveness  of  the  proposed  design;  (v)  be  executed  by \ncommunities  to  the  extent  possible,  using  local  labor  and  materials,  and  technology  that  is \nsimple  and  appropriate \nfor \nconstruction;40 and (vii) include a realistic and affordable O&M plan. Participation targets will be \nconfirmed  and  gender  audits  undertaken  by  the  PPIU  during  the  verification  process  before \nsigning of the block-grant contract between the district and the CIO. \n \n45. \nProject  activities  will  be  undertaken  by  communities,  largely  through  manual  labor  and \nusing  locally  available  and  environmentally  safe  materials,  with  technical  guidance  from  the \ncommunity  facilitators,  DPIUs,  and  project  management  consultants.  When  goods  or  services \ncannot be provided by a community, such as tasks requiring specialized expertise, this should \n\nlocal  conditions;  (vi)  have  allocated  reasonable \n\ntime \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n36 Activities that can be supported include (i) building and repairing basic infrastructure such as small roads, bridges, \nirrigation infrastructure, clean water supply systems and sanitation; (ii) equipping or repairing social infrastructure \nsuch  as  school  buildings,  clinics,  and  providing  supplies  to  school  children  and  health  clinics;  and  (iii)  social  and \neconomic activities. The negative list will be detailed in the project administration manual.   \n\n37 For a total of Rp500 million per village. \n38 To  date,  about  80%  of  PNPM  Mandiri  funds  have  been  used  for  physical  infrastructure  and  about  20%  for \n\neconomic and social activities.  \n\n39 Screening for environment and land acquisition and resettlement will be undertaken for each investment. \n40 The preferred duration for construction is 3 months. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\nthe  Project.  O&M  will  be \n\nbe  confirmed  in  a  community  meeting  and  procurement  should  be  conducted  through  the \ncommunity  procurement  committee  established  under \nfully \nimplemented and partly financed by the communities, with district governments supporting O&M \nactivities that are beyond the technical capacity of the communities. The Project will target that \n30% of employment opportunities from construction and O&M will be provided to women.  \n \n46. \nThe Project will utilize the same funds flow mechanism for block grants as in the ongoing \nRIS-PNPM. The first installment of 40% of the approved block grant will be transferred directly \ninto  the  CIO\u2019s  bank  account  as  an  advance  payment.  The  remaining  funds,  subject  to \ncertification  of  progress  by  the  DPIUs,  will  be  disbursed  to  the  community  in  two  additional \ninstallments:  40%  at  the  36%  completion  point  of  the  village  works,  and  20%  at  the  72% \ncompletion point. District governments will be required to provide counterpart contributions from \ntheir own budgetary resources\u2014amounting to 5% of the total value of block grants provided to \nthe participating villages within their jurisdiction\u2014to cover the incremental operating costs of the \nDPIU and the costs of socialization of the project to participating villages.  \n \nOutput  3:  Improved  capacity  for  project  implementation  and  monitoring  and \n47. \nevaluation.  This output supports project management and implementation support at national, \nprovincial, and district levels, including M&E. There are three levels of project management\u2014a \nnational  project  coordination  and  monitoring  unit  (PCMU),  PPIUs,  and  DPIUs.  Following  the \nPNPM  Mandiri  system,  each  level  is  assisted  by  a  team  of  consultants  providing  technical, \nmanagement  and  capacity  development  support  in  project  planning,  management  and \ncoordination;  establishment  and  operation  of  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  at  all  levels; \npreparation  of \nfeasibility  studies  and  procurement  packages;  design  and  construction \nsupervision;  contract  management;  financial  management  and  accounting;  and  training, \ninstitutional  and  human  resources  development.  This  output  will  also  include  capacity  building \nfor M&E and encourage nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to participate in monitoring and \nevaluating  the  Project,  both  as  members  of  provincial  and  district  steering  and  oversight \ncommittees and as contractors hired to conduct independent monitoring. \n \nC.  \n \nSupport  for  the  Government's  ongoing  program.  The  Project  will  support  and \n48. \nenhance  implementation  of  the  Government's  national  PNPM  Mandiri  program  by  providing \nadditional resources necessary to expand the program's coverage and improve its management \nand implementation, based on directions developed by the PNPM Oversight Body. By building \nupon  and  directly  supporting  the  Government  program  and  investments  in  design  and \nimplementation  of  the  PNPM  Mandiri,  the  Project  will  be  able  to  achieve  ownership,  greater \nsustainability, and more efficient resource use, and to avoid duplications.  \n \nEnhanced  targeting  of  poor  villages.  The  Project  will  strengthen  the  targeting \n49. \nmechanisms  for  village  selection  to  ensure  that  only  the  poorest  villages  in  each  project \nkecamatan are included. To ensure that selection is fair and transparent, newly available village \nstatistics  from  2008 41  will  be  used  to  verify  the  village  lists  issued  nationally.  In  addition, \nprovincial and district governments will review and confirm the selection.  \n \n50. \nStronger  focus  on  gender.  Ensuring  that  women  participate  on  an  equal  basis  and \nreceive equal benefits remains a challenge for PNPM Mandiri. The Project will include specific \nactions  to  promote  gender  equity,  including  innovative  features  such  as  separate  women's \n\nSpecial Features  \n\n                                                 \n41 PODES and PPLS.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\ngroup  meetings  to  ensure  that  women's  needs  are  adequately  reflected  in  village  plans,  and \ncompletion of gender audits for each selected community investment to ensure that they reflect \nthe needs of both men and women.  \n \nCapacity  building  for  local  governments.  Local  governments  were  using  bottom-up \n51. \napproaches  to  implement  community-based  projects  even  before  CDD  was  introduced  in  the \n1990s.  The  decentralization  law  further  enhanced  the  authority  of  local  governments,  giving \nthem  resources  for  matching  grants  for  community-based  projects  and  for  augmenting \ncommunity  block  grants.  However,  in  the  past,  many  CDD  programs  have  bypassed  local \ngovernments.  While  this  has  often  been  a  necessary  starting  point  to  promote  community \nempowerment and grassroots development, community and local government interface should \nnow  be  promoted.  The  Project  recognizes  this,  and  will  provide  capacity  building  for  local \ngovernments  and  for  better  community  and  local  government  interaction.  The  Project  will \ninclude  a  detailed  partnership  agreement  between  the  district  government  and  the  executing \nagency  (DGHS)  that  clearly  outlines  the  roles,  responsibilities,  and  rights  of  the  local \ngovernments under the Project. It will also provide capacity building to support performance of \nthese  roles  during  and  after  the  Project.  This  will  be  done  through  training  in  project \nimplementation,  bottom-up  planning  and  pro-poor  budgeting,  and  support  to  communities  for \nO&M. These activities will prepare local governments to absorb key functions after 2015 and will \ntherefore be an important contribution to the PNPM Mandiri Program. A capacity assessment of \nthe executing agency and local governments is in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n52. \nGood governance and anticorruption measures. Indonesia is ranked 126 out of 180 \ncountries  in  Transparency  International\u2019s  Corruption  Perception\u2019s  Index.  Corruption  remains  a \nchallenge  in  many  projects. 42  The  most  recent  country  assistance  program  evaluation 43 \nrecommended  that  governance  be  mainstreamed  in  ADB  operations  of  this  type  by  involving \nlocal  governments  and  communities  in  project  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring.  This \nhas been achieved through the CDD approach, with the communities participating at all stages \nof  implementation.  The  Project  will  further  promote  good  governance  through  (i)  transparent, \nconsistent,  and  cost-effective  planning  and  implementation  based  on  common  procedures, \nguidelines,  and  institutional  arrangements;  (ii)  well-defined  procedures  and  mechanisms  for \ntransferring  investment  funds  to  CIO-managed  bank  accounts;  and  (iii)  comprehensive  M&E \nthat  allows  for  an  independent  assessment  of  the  village  investment  outputs  compared  to  the \nproject targets. A summary of governance risks and mitigation measures is in Appendix 4.  \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n53. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $113.5 million, including taxes and duties of \n$0.55  million  to  be  financed  by  the  Government.  The  project  cost  includes  physical  and  price \ncontingencies and financial charges. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 5.  \n\n                                                 \n42 Transparency International. 2008. Annual Report 2008. Berlin. \n43 ADB. 2006.

The  project  implementation  and \norganization chart is in Appendix 6 and the detailed project implementation arrangements are in \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n \n56. \nThe  Project  will  use  the  PIUs  established  by  MPW  at  the  provincial,  and  district  levels \nunder  RIS-PNPM.  At  the  provincial  level,  the  PPIUs  have  been  established  and  will  \n(i)  implement,  monitor  and  evaluate  the  project;  (ii)  conduct  socialization  about  the  project \namong  its  staff,  members  of  the  provincial  coordinating  team,  and  local  interest  groups; (iii) \nprovide  input  for  village  level  project  site  selection;  (iv)  coordinate  with  local  stakeholders;  (v) \nrecruit community facilitators; (vi) assist the PCMU in implementing capacity building programs \nfor  project  staff,  community  facilitators,  villagers  and  other  stakeholders;  (vii)  coordinate \nmonitoring  and  reporting  activities; (viii)  manage  the  handling  of  complaints  and  grievances at \nthe provincial level; (ix) perform financial programming and management at the provincial level; \n(x) prepare physical and financial progress reports at the provincial level, based on the physical \nand financial progress reports of the districts, and submit these to the PCMU; and (xi) provide \nregular reports on the progress of implementation, the resolution status of all grievances lodged \nunder  the  Project,  and  any  allegations  of  misuse  of  funds  or  corruption    to  the  provincial \ncommittee.  \n\n57. \nAt the district level, the DPIUs will (i) coordinate and organize project activities within the \ndistrict;  (ii)  conduct  socialization  activities  among  staff  and  in  project  areas,  and  ensure  that \npolicies and targets on women's equality and pro-poor are disseminated to the project villages;  \n(iii) facilitate implementation of project activities in the project areas; (iv) assist in the formation \nof  CIOs;  (v)  assist  the  CIOs  to  coordinate  the  village  leadership  and  synchronize  planning \nprocesses to produce common MTPR plans for the project-related activities and for the village; \n(vi) provide technical assistance to formulate MTPR plans; (vii) oversee physical implementation \nof  the  community  investments  and  monitor  CIO  fund  applications  and  disbursements;  \n(viii)  supervise  the  O&M  of  the  completed  village  level  projects;  (ix)  provide  support  to  and \nmonitor the outputs of the community facilitators and consultants; (x) help villages to lobby for \nintegration of the MTPR into district development plans and help the CIO to access resources \nfor projects identified in the MTPR that cannot be funded by the Project; (xi) ensure openness \nand  ready  availability  of  information  on  all  aspects  of  the  implementation  of  the  Project;  \n(xii)  maintain  technical  data  and  accounting  records;  (xiii)  coordinate  and  monitor  reporting  at \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\nin  decision-making;  (ii) \n\nthe  village  level;  (xiv)  conduct  investigations  of  complaints  from  the  community  and  submit  a \nreport  to  the  PPIU  within  10  days  of  receipt  of  any  complaint,  even  if  the  investigation  is \nongoing;  (xv)  prepare  financial  and  physical  progress  reports  based  on  reports  collected  from \nthe CIOs and submit these to the PCMU through the PPIU; (xvi) report the results of all activities \nto  the  district  committee  on  a  regular  basis;  and  (xvii)  conduct  performance  evaluations  of \ncommunity facilitators every 3 months and submit them to the PPIU for review and further action \nsuch as additional training, if required. \n \nAt  the  community  level,  the  CIOs  will  (i)  conduct  social  and  poverty  mapping  and \n58. \ncommunity  meetings,  with  at  least  50%  participation  by  poor  people  and  40%  participation  by \nwomen \nidentify  poverty  reduction  constraints  and  social  and \ninfrastructure constraints in the village; (iii) prepare a village investment proposal based on the \nMTPR plan; (iv) subject to receipt of the notice of approval of the village proposal, open a bank \naccount and entering into a contract for works with the DPIU; (v) implement the approved village \nproject  funded  activities;  (vi)  monitor  construction  works  and  reporting  progress  to  the  DPIU \nusing the project performance management system (PPMS); (vii) prepare invoices and manage \nthe  cash  management  system;  (viii)  hold  weekly  meetings  with  the  community  and  providing \ncopies of daily records on village information boards to report physical and financial progress; \nand (ix) maintain a complaints and grievance recording system and investigate allegations, and \nreport regularly to the PPIU on grievances and findings. Each CIO will establish a management \nteam  for  construction  and  O&M.  The  management  team  will  supervise  infrastructure \nconstruction  activities  and  related  management  programs  (including  O&M).  Community \nfacilitators  will  assist  the  CIO,  the  management  team  and  other  village  organizers  to  plan, \nselect, design, and implement the project related activities. \n \n59. \nProject  consultants.  Consultants  will  provide  technical,  management  and  capacity \ndevelopment support to the PCMU, PPIUs, DPIUs, and facilitators during implementation. This \nsupport  will  cover  project  planning,  management  and  coordination;  preparation  of  feasibility \nstudies and procurement packages; design and construction supervision; contract negotiations \nand  management;  financial  management  and  accounting;  and  institutional  and  human \nresources development and training. \n \nImplementation  period.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  3  years, \n60. \nbeginning  in  April  2010  and  ending  in  March  2013.  The  project  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 7. \n \nProcurement.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in \n61. \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Civil \nworks for village investments will be contracted out to the communities based on an agreement \nbetween  a  CIO  and  a  DPIU,  and  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  for  community \nparticipation  in  procurement  as  specified  in  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Community \ncontracts,  to  be  based  on  the  format  of  the  community  contracts  under  the  overall  PNPM \nMandiri, will include evidence of community facilitation, the design of facilities to be constructed \nunder  the  contract,  a  community  O&M  plan  for  these  facilities,  and  clear  duties  and \nresponsibilities  of  both  parties  for  the  project  activities.  The  first  two  community  contracts  in \neach  participating  province  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  prior  approval.  All  contracts  will  be \nmonitored under the management information system. The procurement plan is in Appendix 8. \n \nConsulting  services.  The  Project  will  require  an  estimated  1,928  person-months  of \n62. \nnational  consulting  services  at  national,  provincial,  and  district  levels.  To  strengthen  training, \nparticularly  for  community  facilitators,  a  training  design  and  management  team  will  be \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n18 \n \n\nresponsible  for  developing  and  managing  the  project  training  program.  In  addition,  a  national \nteam  of  management  consultants  will  assist  the  PCMU  and  three  regional  teams  of \nmanagement  consultants  will  cover  the  following  provinces:  (i)  Lampung,  (ii)  South  Sumatra, \nand  (iii)  Jambi  and  Riau.  Each  regional  team  will  consist  of  (i)  team  leader  and  project \nmanagement  specialist,  (ii)  rural  infrastructure  specialist,  (iii)  financial  management  specialist, \n(iv)  social  development  specialist,  (v)  gender  specialist,  (vi)  safeguards  specialist  (vii)  training \nmanager, and (viii) training specialists. Each regional team will also have district teams with a \nsimilar composition to the provincial team; each district team will cover about four districts. The \nconsultants  will  assist  the  central,  provincial,  and  district  governments  in  (i)  overseeing \ncommunity  facilitators  in  empowering  communities  and  ensuring  participation  in  project \nimplementation,  (ii)  providing  technical  and  managerial  support  to  the  PCMU  and  PIUs,  \n(iii)  establishing  and  implementing  a  sound  financial  management  and  monitoring  system,  \n(iv) implementing the complaints-handling mechanism, (v) implementing the PPMS, which is a \npart  of  the  M&E  framework  for  the  PNPM  Mandiri,  and  (vi)  undertaking  training  of  community \nfacilitators  and  local  governments.  A  firm  will  be  contracted  to  undertake  the  project  impact \nevaluation, and NGOs will be contracted to undertake external monitoring of project processes.  \n \n63. \nAll  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  national  training  design  and \nmanagement team will consist of three consultants to be contracted as individuals. The firm for \nimpact  evaluation  will  be  contracted  through  quality-  and  cost-based selection  using  simplified  \ntechnical  proposal.  The  management  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  national  firms.  The \nfixed budget selection method, which requires submitting a simplified technical proposal within \n35  days,  will  be  used  to  select  the  management  consultants  and  the  NGOs  for  external \nmonitoring.  The  fixed  budget  selection  method  is  justified  to  ensure  recruitment  of  highly \ncompetent  consulting  firms  with  the  required  mix  of  specialties,  the  demand  for  which  has \nincreased  considerably  because  of  PNPM  Mandiri.  The  terms  of  reference  of  project \nmanagement  consultants  will  follow  the  format  and  contents  of  those  developed  under  PNPM \nMandiri. The outline terms of references of consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix \nG.  \n \n64. \nThe PPIUs will recruit community facilitators to provide about 26,000 person-months of \nservices. The community facilitators will be recruited as individuals. As they will be financed by \ncounterpart funds, Government procedures will be followed.44  \n\n65. \nAdvance recruitment of consulting services. DGHS may use advance recruitment  of \nconsulting  services  for  management  consultants,  trainers,  and  impact  evaluation.  DGHS  may \npost advertisement and receive expressions of interest and may draft a short list of consultants, \nrequest proposals, and evaluate them.  It may start contract negotiations with the selected firm \nas  soon  as  the  Project  is  approved  by  the  Board.  The  existing  PCMU  has  the  capacity  to \nundertake recruitment, as demonstrated under the ongoing RIS-PNPM. It has been explained to \nthe  Government  that  ADB\u2019s  support  of  advance  contracting  does  not  commit  ADB  to  approve \nthe loan project or to finance the recruitment costs.  \n \nAnticorruption  policy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \n66. \nexplained to and discussed with the Government and DGHS. ADB will require the Borrower to \ninstitute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best \npractice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the \n\n                                                 \n44  The  selection  process  is  described  in  the  capacity  assessment  for  community  facilitators  in  Supplementary \n\nAppendix H.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\nfinancing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding \ndocuments  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the \nProject shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of the DGHS and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey  relate  to  the  Project.  Village-level  contracts  between  CIOs  and  DPIUs  will  also  include \nrelevant anticorruption provisions. Any allegations of corruption will be reported to and reviewed \nby the PNPM Mandiri Oversight Body. \n \nThe  Project  will  incorporate  the  following  good  governance  features:  (i)  advanced \n67. \nsocialization  of  the  overall  project  objectives  so  communities  understand  the  process  of  funds \ndisbursement;  (ii) \ntransparent,  consistent,  and  cost-effective  subproject  planning  and \nimplementation  through  well-defined  procedures,  guidelines  and  institutional  arrangements, \nincluding  community  signboards  with  summaries  of  plans,  progress  reports,  and  financial \nrecords,  and  a  project  website;  (iii)  well-defined  procedures  and  mechanisms  to  transfer \ninvestment  funds  to  community-managed  bank  accounts;  and  (iv)  comprehensive  monitoring \nand evaluation. The existing financial management systems and fiduciary controls under PNPM \nMandiri, which have been developed with assistance from international development agencies, \nare  sound  and  have  adequate  checks  and  balances  to  minimize  corruption  risks.  DGHS  will \nfurther strengthen the project complaints and problem management unit, which was established \nunder RIS-PNPM, to (i) review and address grievances of project stakeholders in relation to the \nProject, any of the service providers, or any person responsible for carrying out the Project; and \n(ii) set threshold criteria and procedures for handling such grievances, responding to them, and \nnotifying  stakeholders.  The  complaints  handling  unit  will  carry  out  its  functions  in  coordination \nwith  the  PNPM  Mandiri  complaints  and  problems  management  unit  and  in  accordance  with \nPNPM  Mandiri\u2019s  Implementation  Guidelines  on  Management  of  Complaints  and  Grievances \n(Supplementary Appendix I).   \n \n68. \nDisbursement  arrangements.  The  Project  is  classified  by  the  Government  as  a \nnational project, which means the central government will provide the loan proceeds directly to \nparticipating  communities.  In  accordance  with  the  Government  Regulation  on  Financial \nManagement  and  Responsibility \nImplementation  of  De-concentration  and  Co-\nadministration  (PP  No.  7/2008),  the  Project  will  be  financed  through  the  central  Government \nbudget.  \n \n69. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  Project  will  adopt  the  same  funds  flow \nmechanism as in the ongoing RIS-PNPM which involves direct transfer of funds for block grants \nfrom  the  project  imprest  account  to  the  CIO  bank  account.  This  will  ensure  that  the  village \ncommunities  receive  the  funds  directly  with  minimal  delay  and  no  leaks.  Two  cycles  of  block \ngrants of Rp250 million will be provided to each of approximately 1,500 villages to finance their \npriorities  as  identified  in  their  MTPR  plans.  The  first  installment  of  40%  of  the  approved  block \ngrant  will  be  transferred  directly  into  the  CIO\u2019s  bank  account  as  an  advance  payment.  The \nremaining  funds,  subject  to  certification  of  progress  by  the  DPIUs,  will  be  disbursed  to  the \ncommunity in two additional installments: 40% at the 36% completion point of the village works, \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n20 \n \n\nand  20%  at  the  72%  completion  point. 45 The  Project  will  use  direct  payments  and  imprest \naccount procedures.  \n \n70. \nThe  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The imprest account will be established \nand administered by the Ministry of Finance.46 Project expenditures during the first 6 months of \nimplementation, consisting of the first tranche of community grants in all villages, are estimated \nat about $17 million. Considering the imprest ceiling of $18 million for the ongoing RIS-PNPM47 \nand  the  Project\u2019s  utilization  of  implementation  arrangements  already  in  place  for  the  PNPM \nMandiri, the imprest ceiling is considered justified. The maximum amount to be deposited into \nthe  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  $17  million  or  6  months  estimated  expenditures  to  be \nfinanced through the imprest account, whichever is lower. Liquidation will be carried out under \nthe  statement  of  expenditure  procedure,  for  which  the  limit  will  be  $50,000  per  individual \npayment.  \n \n71. \nSufficient supporting documentation, as defined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, \nwill be kept at each level of project management to substantiate all expenditures incurred from \nthe  loan  proceeds.  Concerned  DGHS  and  regional  government  staff  will  be  trained  in  ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement procedures. Financial due diligence undertaken during project preparation found \nthat  DGHS  has  significant  financial  management  experience  and  capacity,  and  will  be  able  to \nensure  effective  and  appropriate  project  financial  management.  The  Project\u2019s  funds  flow \nmechanism and detailed disbursement procedures are in Appendix 9. \n \n72. \nAccounting,  auditing,  and  reporting.  DGHS,  the  PPIUs,  the  DPIUs,  and  local \ngovernments involved in project implementation will prepare and maintain separate records and \naccounts  for  the  Project.  They  will  register  all  receipts  and  payments  for  the  Project  in \naccordance with sound accounting principles and procedures. The CIOs will maintain accounts \nin the format specified by the project guidelines, and their books and records will be open to the \npublic. The summary of expenditures will be posted on a signboard in each participating village. \nAnnual project accounts will be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB, and will \nbe  based  on  sound  and  acceptable  accounting  principles.  Audited  project  accounts,  audited \nfinancial statements, and the audit opinion will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the end \nof  the  financial  year  and  at  project  completion.  A  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the \nimprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be  included  in  the  annual  audit \nreport.  A  formal  warning  will  be  issued  for  accounts  more  than  6  months  overdue,  and \ndisbursements  will  be  suspended  for  accounts  that  are  12  months  overdue.  The  financial \nstatements and the auditor\u2019s report will be in English. In case of any specific complaints, DGHS \nwill contract an independent auditor, using project funds, to audit the accounts at the community \nlevel and at other relevant implementation levels. \n \nProject  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  Project  will  continue  and \n73. \nstrengthen  the  PPMS  that  was  established  under  RIS-PNPM.  Specific  elements  include  \n(i)  conduct  of  baseline  and  completion  surveys  for  individual  villages  by  trained  staff  and \ncommunity  facilitators;  (ii)  participatory  monitoring  by  communities  based  on  self-defined \nindicators;  (iii)  internal  monitoring  of  inputs,  process,  and  outputs;  (iv)  independent  external \nmonitoring and evaluation by third parties, such as civil society groups; and (v) the design and \nimplementation of a high-quality impact evaluation.  \n\n                                                 \n45 See paras. 42\u201347 for more details on block grant administration.  \n46 Bank charges will be financed out of the ADB loan.  \n47 The ongoing RIS-PNPM covers about 1,700 villages.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21\n\n \n\nthe \n\nThe  Project  will  mobilize  local  NGOs  or  other  civil  society  organizations  in  each  of  the \n74. \nfour project provinces to undertake independent monitoring. Particular emphasis will be given to \nassessing participation by and benefits accruing to very poor and remote households, women, \nand  other  marginalized  groups.  Locally  deployed  NGOs  will  also  be  trained  to  work  with \nvillagers to enhance community-level participatory M&E.  \n \nThe Project will contract an independent firm to conduct an external impact evaluation. \n75. \nThe  evaluation  will  assess \ninterventions  on  poverty,  gender, \nimpact  of  project \nempowerment,  governance  and  socioeconomic  conditions  in  target  villages.  Regression \ndiscontinuity and other econometric tools will be used to compare changes in project and control \nvillages from pre-project baseline data. The impact evaluation will be the first application of this \nmethodology to assess CDD programs in Indonesia and will complement existing evidence and \ncontribute to increased knowledge for the institutionalization of the PNPM Mandiri. The impact \nevaluation  will  be  conducted  in  close  dialogue  with  agencies  such  as  BAPPENAS,  Menko \nKesra, and the World Bank.   \n \nConsistent  with  PNPM  Mandiri\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Implementation  of  Monitoring  and \n76. \nEvaluation  (Supplementary  Appendix  J),  the  Project\u2019s  M&E  will  encompass  the  following \nelements:  (i)  monitoring  physical  and  financial  progress  and  the  efficiency  of  village \ninvestments;  (ii)  monitoring  the  level  and  adequacy  of  village  and  stakeholder  participation  in \nplanning  and  implementing  project  activities;  (iii)  monitoring  the  capacity  of  CIOs  and  local \ngovernments; (iv) collecting gender disaggregated data on stakeholders' participation in training \nand  planning,  and  the  accrual  of  benefits,  including  employment  generation;  (v)  monitoring \nsocial,  environmental,  and  economic  impacts,  including  establishment  of  baseline  data;  (vi) \nconduct  of  physical  and  financial  audits;  and  (vii)  assessing  the  impact  and  utilization  of  the \ninvestments.  The  M&E  framework  for  PNPM  Mandiri  has  built  upon  the  last  8  years  of  M&E \nwork on CDD in Indonesia and similar programs in other parts of the world. The framework has \nemployed  quantitative  and  qualitative  methodologies,  as  well  as  a  mix  of  internal  and \noutsourced  evaluations.  The  M&E  guidelines  describe  the  responsibilities  of  all  stakeholders \n(including central and local governments, community facilitators, consultants, CIOs, and NGOs) \nin  carrying  out  M&E,  and  require  a  mixture  of  strong  supervision  and  quality  checks  through \ninternal project channels and external M&E.  \n \n77. \nThe  PPMS  will  follow  the  PNPM  Mandiri\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Implementation  of  MIS \n(Supplementary Appendix K) and will be part of  the program  management information system \n(MIS). The MIS for the Project will form part of the integrated MIS for PNPM Mandiri, which is \nmanaged by the data and information center of BAPPENAS. The PNPM Mandiri\u2019s MIS includes \nvalidation and verification processes to ensure the quality of data and information. Inputs from \nsector program systems are submitted to the national level and data are updated monthly. M&E \nfindings  are  updated  on  the  PNPM  Mandiri  website  on  the  15th  of  every  month,  and  will  be \nincorporated in quarterly project progress reports that the PCMU will prepare within 1 month of \nthe  end  of  the  reporting  period.  It  will  submit  these  to  ADB  and  the  PNPM  Mandiri  Oversight \nBody. The PCMU will also prepare and submit a consolidated project completion report to ADB \nwithin 6 months of project completion.  \n \n78. \nProject review. MPW and ADB will carry out joint project reviews at least twice a year, \nincluding  midterm  and  project  completion  reviews.  The  reviews  will  assess  project  impacts, \nparticularly  the  institutional,  administrative,  organizational,  technical,  environmental,  and  social \naspects.  The  reviews  will  also  examine  compliance  with  covenants  specified  in  the  Loan \nAgreement.  MPW  and  ADB  will  conduct  a  midterm  review  after  2  years  of  project \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n22 \n \n\nimplementation. MPW and the district governments will make sure that their staff visit the field \nfrequently and join ADB for all project review missions. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts  \n\nA. \n \nEconomic  and  financial  benefits.  Village-level  interventions  will  be  identified  by \n79. \nvillagers  through  a  participatory  CDD  process.  It  is  therefore  not  possible  to  conduct \nconventional  ex  ante  economic  and  financial  analysis  of  project  benefits.  However,  impact \nanalyses  of  previous  CDD  projects  in  Indonesia  have  demonstrated  that  they  have  a  major \nimpact on short-term employment generation and that CDD is highly cost-effective in improving \ncommunity  infrastructure  and  access  to  basic  services.  Previous  projects  have  used  local \nmanual  labor  intensively  and  it  has  typically  accounted  for  30\u201350%  of  civil  works  costs.  The \nProject  is  expected  to  generate  at  least  290,000  person-months  (more  than  24,000  person-\nyears)  of  short-term  employment  in  the  construction  of  village  investments.  Overall,  PNPM \nMandiri is expected to generate employment for 24 million people and to increase their incomes \nby  10%\u201315%.48 As  this  employment  is  largely  provided  in  the  agricultural  off-season,  it  has \nparticular benefits for reducing unemployment and vulnerability among the poor.  \n \n80. \nThe  Project  is  also  expected  to  have  significant  impacts  on  village  economies.  Similar \ntypes  of  investments  have  been  shown  to  yield  an  average  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n(EIRR)  of  28%\u201368%.  Economic  benefits  arise  from  opening  access  to  markets  and  lowering \ntransport costs in the case of rural roads and bridges, increased incomes, and additional crop \ncycles  from  improved  irrigation,  and  time  saved  in  collecting  water  and  health  benefits  from \nvillage  water  projects.  Analyses  of  previous  projects  also  show  important  spillover  effects, \nincluding  stimulating  village  economies,  and  broader  socioeconomic  benefits,  including \ncontributing to poverty reduction. \n \n81. \nOverall, investments in priority village facilities and services are expected to benefit more \nthan  1.5  million  people  in  more  than  300,000  households.  In  addition  to  sustained  village \nparticipation,  integration  of  the  proposed  Project  within  the  Government's  PNPM  Mandiri \nProgram and existing systems will improve the efficiency of management and implementation, \nas well as the magnitude and sustainability of economic and financial benefits compared with a \nstand-alone intervention. The economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix L. \n \n82. \nSocial  and  poverty  reduction  impacts.  The  Project  will  target  poor  and  isolated \nvillages  in  less-developed  districts  that  lack  basic  services  and  infrastructure.  The  selected \nvillages will have higher than average poverty levels and lower than average achievement levels \nfor MDGs. Improvements in basic infrastructure will increase the availability and accessibility of \neducation and health services for the rural poor and near poor, and will improve income-earning \nopportunities  and  health.  Community  investments  will  (i)  reduce  time  and  costs  spent  on \nobtaining  good  quality  water,  (ii)  diminish  the  incidence  and  severity  of  waterborne  diseases,  \n(iii) increase the availability and accessibility of education and health services for the rural poor \nand  near  poor,  (iv)  improve  access  to  services  and  markets,  and  (v)  provide  income-earning \nopportunities  and  welfare  through  increased  employment.  The  Project  will  support  capacity \ndevelopment  and  community  facilitation  efforts,  which  will  build  social  capital,  empower \ncommunities,  and  improve  local  governance.  As  a  result,  the  Project  will  help  to  deliver  more \n\n                                                 \n48 Papanek, Gustav. 2007. Employment and PNPM Program. Jakarta.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23\n\n \n\nefficient  and  equitable  services  at  the  local  level.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social \nstrategy is in Appendix 10. \n \n83.   Gender  impacts.  Domestic responsibilities and social and cultural stereotypes limit the \ndegree  and  nature  of  women's  participation  in  communal  forums  and  organizations.  Men  and \nwomen's different access to and control over resources and facilities in the community may also \nlimit  women's  participation  in  project  activities.  A  gender  action  plan  was  prepared  for  the \nProject,  which  includes  actions  to  ensure  that  women  (i)  are  represented  in  CIOs,  (ii)  have \naccess  to  planning  and  budgeting  opportunities,  (iii)  are  key  project  stakeholders  and \nbeneficiaries,  and  (iv)  are  encouraged  to  increase  their  participation  in  public  forums  and \ncommunity  decision  making  in  both  project-specific  and  other  activities.  At  least  30%  of \ncommunity  facilitators  will  be  women  and  each  CIO  will  target  a  40%  female  membership. \nSeparate women's meetings will be held to ensure that women's needs are adequately reflected \nin  village  plans.  A  gender  audit  will  be  completed  for  each  selected  community  investment  to \nensure that it reflects the needs of men and women. The gender action plan is in Appendix 11.  \n \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  have  any  negative  impacts  on \n84.  \nindigenous peoples. It will not discriminate against them or other marginalized groups. Because \nit is based on CDD principles, the Project will include opportunities for screening project impacts \non indigenous groups and incorporating mitigation measures, if any, into the overall design and \nimplementation of any investment. In accordance with the ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples \n(1998),  the  Project  has  been  classified  as  category  B.  Specific  actions  have  been  included  in \nthe  Project:  (i)  the  selection  criteria  for  community  investments  includes  provisions  to  ensure \nthat indigenous peoples and other vulnerable groups are part of the capacity-building, planning, \nimplementation,  and  post-implementation  processes;  (ii)  minority  and  marginalized  groups  will \nbe  represented  on  CIOs  and  CIO  representation  committees  in  proportion  to  their  overall \npopulation  in  the  community;  and  (iii)  indigenous  groups  will  benefit  proportionally  from  easier \naccess to service delivery, rural infrastructure, training, and construction-related jobs.   \n \n85. \nLand acquisition and resettlement. The Project has been classified as category B as  \nthe  scope  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  expected  to  be  insignificant.  Based  on  the \nexperience  of  the  PNPM  Mandiri  program,  land  acquisition  may  be  required  for  very  small \ncommunity  facilities.  This  will  not  involve  any  resettlement  of  people,  relocation  of  houses,  or \nsignificant  impacts  on  productive  land  or  other  productive  assets.  This  is  part  of  the  appraisal \ncriteria for community investments. PNPM Mandiri experience indicates that about 500 square \nmeters  or  less  per  village  investment  is  usually  required,  affecting  fewer  than  five  households \n(or  25  persons).  Screening  for  potential  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  is \nincorporated  into  the  community  decision-making  and  planning  processes  and  acquisition  will \nbe  financed  by  communities  through  the  block  grants  or  as  community  contributions.  The \nsummary land acquisition and resettlement framework is in Appendix 12 and the full framework \nis in Supplementary Appendix M.  \n \n86. \nEnvironmental  impacts.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B  (non-\nsensitive).  Given  the  small  size  of  the  community  projects  and  the  provision  of  technical  and \nsocial  facilitation,  no  environmental  damage  is  expected.  Village  proposals  will  be  screened \nthrough  checklists  to  review  environmental  implications  and  ensure  that  there  are  no  adverse \nimpacts.  Environmental  responsibility  will  mainly  reside  with  the  CIOs,  assisted  by  a  team  of \ncommunity  facilitators.  The  CIOs  will  be  responsible  for  conducting  environmental  screening \nand  identifying  necessary  mitigation  measures.  Community  facilitators  will  receive  technical \ntraining  prior  to  project  implementation.  Safeguard  specialists  will  be  recruited  at  national  and \nregional  levels  to  assist  community  facilitators,  provincial  and  DPIUs,  and  the  PCMU  in \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n24 \n \n\nRisks \n\nmanaging  the  Project's  environmental  aspects.  Existing  guidelines  for  community-based  civil \nworks  and  the  technical  guidelines  developed  by  MPW  for  PNPM  Mandiri  have  specific \nconsiderations  to  ensure  environmental  considerations  are  taken  into  account  in  design, \nconstruction, and operation. The summary initial environmental examination is in Appendix 13. \nThe  initial  environmental  examination  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  N  and  the  environmental \nassessment and review framework is in Supplementary Appendix O.  \n \n87. \nInstitutional benefits. Community-based planning mechanisms are the key to instituting \ngood  governance  practices.  The  Project  will  strengthen  the  ability  of  village  communities  to \narticulate  their  needs  and  to  seek  support  for  their  development  plans,  and  will  improve  their \nrespective  district  governments\u2019  ability  to  respond  to  their  demands.  The  Project  will  also \nimprove the planning processes of local governments through its support for bottom-up planning \nand  budgeting.  As  the  Project  will  target  poor  villages,  capacity-building  activities  will  directly \nbenefit the poor by providing them with the means to draw the attention and resources of local \ngovernments to their development needs.  \n \nB. \n \n88. \nProject  implementation  risks.  The Project will operate in less-developed districts of \nthe country where implementation capacities may be limited. To address the risk that this may \naffect project implementation, the Project will strengthen village structures and local government \ncouncils  and  leadership.  It  will  pay  particular  attention  to  local  government  units  involved  in \nproject implementation, including the provincial and district steering committees and the PPIUs \nand DPIUs.  \n  \n89. \nInstitutional  and  governance  risks.  Previous  rural  and  community  development \nprojects, including RIS-PNPM, indicate a risk of elite capture. This risk is minimized by several \nfeatures of the project design, including (i) community poverty mapping; (ii) establishment of the \nCIO;  (iii)  election  of  community  representatives  and  village  organizers;  (iv)  representation  of \nwomen,  minority,  and  marginalized  groups  among  the  community  representatives;  and  \n(v)  prioritization  of  the  needs  of  poor  community  members  in  the  village  MTPR  plans.  In \naddition, all civil works will be contracted to the CIOs and will be undertaken primarily through \nmanual  labor.  This  will  help  ensure  that  the  jobs  generated  by  the  Project  are  filled  by \ncommunity members. \n  \n90. \nInfrastructure projects involving procurement of large amounts of goods and services for \ncivil  works  may  be  prone  to  corruption.  To  a  large  extent,  this  will  be  mitigated  through \ncommunity  management  of  the  planning,  oversight,  and  implementation  of  the  civil  works.  In \naddition,  the  existing  financial  management  systems  and  fiduciary  controls  under  PNPM \nMandiri, which have been developed with assistance from international development agencies, \nare  sound  and  have  adequate  checks  and  balances  to  minimize  corruption  risks.  Finally,  the \nProject\u2019s  complaints  and  problems  handling  unit  will  review  and  address  any  grievances  of \nproject  stakeholders  in  relation  to  the  Project,  any  of  the  service  providers,  or  any  person \nresponsible for carrying out the Project.  \n \n91. \nTargeting risks. Under the current support to RIS-PNPM, some better-off villages have \nbeen  included  while  some  of  the  poorest  villages  were  not  included.  This  is  likely  because  of \npolitical  interference  or  inadequate  data  used  for  the  targeting.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  by \nusing 2008 village statistics to verify the project village lists, and involving provincial and district \ngovernments in reviewing the lists to confirm that the villages included are the poorest.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25\n\n \n\nSustainability  risks.  A  lack  of  O&M  can  drastically  reduce  the  benefits  from  village \n92. \ninvestments.  CDD  experience  has  demonstrated  that  O&M  is  enhanced  because  of  the \ncommunity  ownership  generated  through  villagers'  involvement  in  project  selection,  planning, \ndesign,  implementation,  and  post-implementation  activities.  The  risk  is  also  reduced  by \nencouraging the use of local labor and materials in construction, and by making approval and \nsupport of community investment proposals contingent on the preparation of O&M plans. \n \n93. \nThe scope and coverage of the PNPM Mandiri program is very wide, which may affect \nthe  ability  of  the  Government  to  continue  large-scale  implementation.  However,  while  costs  of  \ncommunity facilitation and capacity building are high, these are important investments leading to \nmore sustainable infrastructure, more regular O&M, less leakage, and more social capital. The \nProject  will  include  capacity  building  of  local  government  and  seek  to  mainstream  project \nactivities into existing local government mandates in a cost-effective and efficient manner.  \n \n \n\nV.    \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  DGHS  have  given  the \n\n94. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nLoan  proceeds  and  sufficient  corresponding  counterpart  contributions,  including \nall  Government  allocations  for  implementation,  staffing  and  O&M  of  project \nfacilities  are  to  be  allocated  and  readily  available,  with  the  submission  of \nbudgetary  allocation  requests  to  be   made  in  a  timely  manner  throughout  the \nproject implementation period by earmarking the funds.  \nThe  smooth  flow  of  funds  will  occur  in  accordance  with  the  flow  of  funds \nmechanism agreed upon by the Government and ADB. \nAll village investments will be reviewed and assessed for environmental impacts \nthe  Project\u2019s  environmental  assessment  and  review \nin  accordance  with \nframework and respective mitigation and monitoring measures prescribed in the \nrelevant ADB-approved initial environmental examinations. Implementation of the \nproject  activities  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  local \nenvironmental laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). In the \nevent of any conflict, ADB's policy will prevail. \nThe  selection  of  village  investments  for  implementation  under  the  Project  will \nfollow  the  PNPM  Mandiri  guidelines\u2014be  pro-poor  and  ensure  that  indigenous \npeople, minorities and marginalized people equally benefit from the Project.  \nAll  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  under  the  Project  will  be \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  applicable  local  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  the  Project\u2019s  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  framework.  All  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  will  be \nprepared  in  accordance  with  the  Project's  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nframework. \nNo disbursement will be authorized by a DPIU for a village investment unless the \nproposed  works  are  based  on  an  approved  village  MTPR  plan  and  a  signed \ncontract  between  the  CIO  and  the  DPIU,  and  certification  for  the  village \ninvestment  has  been  issued  from  the  regional  project  management  consultants \nto  the  DPIU  and  been  advised  to  the  CIO  and  the  regional  treasury  offices.  To \nensure compliance, the PPIU will undertake regular spot-checks. \nEach participating village will establish a separate bank account for village-level \nactivities funded by the Project. Funds will be transferred to the CIO account in \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n26 \n \n\ntranches of 40%, 40%, and 20% of the amount approved for the village proposal \nbased upon verification of actual implementation progress by the relevant DPIU. \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Within  6  months  following  the  loan  effective  date,  DGHS  will  create  a  project \nwebsite  to  disclose  information  about  relevant  matters  on  the  Project,  including \ndetailed accounts of procurement. \nThe Government will ensure implementation and resourcing of the project gender \naction  plan  as  agreed  between  ADB  and  the  Government,  and  in  particular, \nensure (a) that women comprise 40% of participants in village training programs, \n(b) that 30% of community facilitators are women, (c) that 40% of the members of \nCIOs are women, and (d) conduct of a gender audit for each selected community \ninvestment.  The  Gender  Action  Plan  will  be  implemented  and  monitored  with \nperiodic reports made to ADB and the PNPM Mandiri Oversight Body. \nKeep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other  stakeholders  about \nmeasures that may impact the effective implementation of the Project. \n\n(x) \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n\n95. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  \n$84,240,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Rural  Infrastructure  Support  to  the  PNPM \nMandiri  Project  II  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of \n25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n20 October 2009 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n27\n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Targets \nand/or Indicators \n\nData Sources and/or \nReporting Mechanisms  \n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks \n\nAssumption \nNational and regional \ngovernment policies \ncontinue to support \ncommunity-driven \ndevelopment. \n \nRisk \nNatural or financial \ndisasters will impact the \nproject area. \n\nAssumptions \nCommunities are fully \ncommitted to the Project \nand have sufficient \nresources to maintain \nproject investments. \n\nNational budget funds are \nadequate and provided in \na timely manner. \n\nPNPM Mandiri evaluations  \n\nPODES village-level and \nSUSENAS household \nsurveys \n\nProject surveys (MOHA, \nMPW) \n\nSubdistrict and district \ngovernment plans and \nbudgets \n\nPPMS reports \n\nPODES village-level  and \nSUSENAS household \nsurveys \n\nBaseline and follow-up \nimpact evaluation surveys \nin target project areas  \n(MPW)  \n\nIndependent NGO M&E \nreports \n\nPNPM Mandiri MIS and \nevaluations  \n\nSpecial studies (MPW) \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nReduced poverty and \nimproved local governance \nin PNPM Mandiri areas  \n\nOutcome \nImproved access to \nservice delivery and basic \nrural infrastructure for the \npoor, near poor, and \nwomen in the project \ncommunities \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nBy 2017: \n\nNumber of households in \nproject villages living below \npoverty line reduced by at \nleast 20% from project \nbaseline. \n \nSatisfaction with local level \nservice delivery and \ngovernance increased by at \nleast 20% from baseline. \n\nBy 2014: \n\nPoor and women in about \n1,500 rural villages in the \nproject provinces benefiting \nfrom better service delivery \nand village infrastructure. \n\nAt least 60% of villagers in \nproject villages satisfied with \nimprovements in local roads, \ndrinking water, sanitation, \nand other basic \ninfrastructure. \n\nAt least a 10% increase from \nthe baseline in the number of \nwomen in project villages \nundertaking prenatal care \ncheck-ups. \n\nAt least a 10% increase from \nbaseline in school \nattendance of girls aged 13\u2013\n15 years (lower secondary \nschool). \n\nAt least 20% reduction from \nthe baseline in time spent \ncollecting water in project \nvillages.  \n \nAt least 50% of households \nin project villages have \nincreased awareness of \nsound hygiene and \nsanitation practices.  \n \nCommunity-determined \nvillage priorities integrated in \nsubdistrict and district \ndevelopment plans and \nsupported by district \ngovernment budgets. \n\n\fDesign \nSummary \n\nPerformance Targets \nand/or Indicators \n\nData Sources and/or \nReporting Mechanisms \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nPPMS reports \n\nImpact evaluation mid-term \nand final reports \n\nNGO reports \n\nDistrict government plans \nand budgets \n\n \nRisks \nPrioritization and planning \nare captured by a few \ninfluential community \nmembers. \n\nRegional governments fail \nto participate constructively \nin project implementation. \n\n \n\n28 \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nOutputs \n1.

The  first  post-Suharto  CDD  project  was  the  Kecamatan  (subdistrict) \nDevelopment Project (KDP)1, funded by the World Bank. Since then, a number of CDD projects \nhave been implemented and funded by various development partners, among them the World \nBank-supported Urban Poverty Project (UPP)2 and Village Infrastructure Project (VIP),3 and the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-supported  Rural  Infrastructure  Support  Project  (RISP),4 \nCommunity  Water  Services  Health  Project  (CWHSP),5  Community  and  Local  Government \nSupport  Project  (CLGSP),6  and  the  Community  Empowerment  for  Rural  Development  Project \n(CERDP).7  \n \nA. \n \nSeveral government agencies and nongovernment organizations have been involved in \n2. \nCDD  and  years  of  experience  have  built  up  the  national  capacity  for  CDD  approaches. \nGovernment agencies that have played significant roles in CDD include the following.  \n\nGovernment Agencies in CDD  \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  National  Planning  Development  Agency  (BAPPENAS)  is  responsible  for \nurban  and  rural  infrastructure  planning  and  coordination  of  national  reform \nprocesses.  It  was  instrumental  in  the  first  KDP  and  other  CDD  projects. \nBAPPENAS  is  considered  the  champion  of  CDD  in  Indonesia  and  played  a \nleading role in the development of PNPM Mandiri. \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (MOHA)  oversees  decentralization  and  monitoring \nof  performance  of  regional  governments.  MOHA  acted  as  executing  agency  for \nKDP  II  and  III  and  has  built  its  capacity  for  supervision  and  oversight  of \ncommunity-driven  initiatives.  MOHA  is  also  playing  a  leading  role  in  the  PNPM \nMandiri as executing agency for the World-Bank-financed PNPM Rural. \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW)  through  the  Directorate  General  of  Water \nResources (DGWR), and the Directorate General of Human Settlements (DGHS) \nhas  also  been  involved  in  a  number  of  CDD  initiatives.  The  Ministry  is \nresponsible  for  all  nationally  funded  public  works  and  for  ensuring  compliance \nwith  technical  standards  and  designs.  DGWR  provides  guidance  in  allocating \nsurface  water  resources  amongst  users.  DGHS  was  the  executing  agency  for \nnumerous  community-based  projects,  including  the  World  Bank\u2019s  UPP  and \nADB\u2019s RISP and Neighborhood Upgrading and Shelter Sector Project (NUSSP). \n\n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 1998.

The  decentralization  law  further \nenhanced the authority of local governments, giving them resources so they could match grants \nfor  community-based  projects  and  augment  community  block  grants.  The  decentralization  law \ngave local governments authority over the provision of such basic services as health, education, \npublic works, environment, communications, agriculture, industry and trade, capital investments, \nmanpower, and infrastructure services.   \n \nB.  \n \n4. \nADB  has  funded  several  projects  with  CDD  features  in  Indonesia.  Between  2001  and \n2007, 23 loans were approved, 11 of which had CDD features. Of the total loan amount, 21% \nrepresented operations with CDD features.   \n \n\nADB and Community-Driven Development in Indonesia \n\n1. \n\nRural Infrastructure Support Project (RISP) \n\n \n5. \nThe  RISP  was  part  of  the  rural  infrastructure  component  of  Indonesia\u2019s  Fuel  Subsidy \nReduction  Compensation  Program  (PKPS-BBM).  The  project  rehabilitated  and  improved  rural \ninfrastructure  in  1,840  villages  in  45  districts  in  East  Java,  East  Nusa  Tenggara,  South  East \nSulawesi  and  South  Sulawesi  provinces.  The  total  project  cost  was  $60.82  million,  of  which  \n$50 million was funded by ADB. The executing agency was the Ministry of Public Works through \nits DGHS.  \n \nThe  RISP  used  CDD  approaches:  before  subproject  funding,  target  communities  were \n6. \norganized,  informed  about  the  project,  and  provided  with  a  forum  to  select  subprojects  for \nfunding.  Communities  organized  subproject  implementation  committees  to  oversee  the \nconstruction  of  subprojects.  In  most  cases,  contractors  were  not  used;  instead,  communities \nentered  into  contracts  with  the  executing  agency  to  implement  the  subprojects  themselves. \nFunds  were  transferred  directly  to  community  accounts  and  members  of  the  community \nsubproject committees oversaw disbursement of the funds. The Project made payments based \non  plans  rather  than  on  actual  expenditures,  and  disbursed  40%  of  the  block  grant  upon \napproval  of  the  proposal  and  signing  of  the  contract  between  communities  and  the  district \ngovernment.  \n \n\nCommunity Water Services and Health Project  (CWSHP) \n\n2. \n \n7. \nADB has contributed to the improvement and expansion of water supply and sanitation \nservices  in  Indonesia  using  CDD  approaches.  The  CWSHP  provides  rural  water  supply  and \nsanitation  facilities  and  services  to  about  1,000  communities  in  20  districts  in  four  provinces. \nThe Project aims to improve district governments' capacity to deliver basic water and sanitation \nservices,  strengthen  communities  so  they  can  take  primary  responsibility  for  such  services, \nextend  water  and  sanitation  facilities  to  communities  through  a  demand-driven  approach,  and \nincrease communities\u2019 awareness of health and hygiene.8  \n \n8. \nThe  executing  agency  for  the  Project  is  the  Ministry  of  Health\u2019s  Directorate  General  of \nCommunicable  Disease  Control  and  Environmental  Health.

A menu of potential investments related to water and sanitation is \nprovided and communities choose subprojects from the menu. Community procurement is used \nand there is a direct flow of funds from project accounts to community accounts.   \n \n\n3.    Community and Local Government Support Project (CLGSP) \n\n \n9. \nThe CLGSP has improved the access of poor communities to small basic items of public \ninfrastructure  (e.g.,  water  supply,  toilet  facilities,  drainage,  irrigation,  markets,  roads  and \nfootpaths, bridges, piers and harbors, schools, and health posts) using CDD approaches. The \nProject also provided capacity building interventions to strengthen community-based institutions \nand improve local governments\u2019 capacity to manage CDD.  \n\n \nThe  CLGSP  supported  the  construction  of  public  facilities  through  community  efforts. \n10. \nCommunities  exercised  a  high  degree  of  participation,  and  provided  additional  resources.  An \nevaluation of the Project9 reported that most subprojects were of good quality. The same report \nnoted  that  the  capacities  of  local  communities,  districts,  and  cities  had  improved  because  of \ntheir involvement in planning and implementation of subprojects and as a result of its capacity \nbuilding interventions.  \n \n\nImpacts of CDD Approaches   \n\n4.    Community Empowerment for Rural Development (CERDP) \n \n11. \nThe CERDP supported the capacity building of local government staff and villagers and \nfinanced  a  development  planning  process  for  local  development  needs.  The  Project  used \nparticipatory approaches under which villagers identified local problems and proposed solutions, \norganized themselves to implement those solutions, and monitored results.  \n \n12. \nCommunity-based  savings  and  loan  organizations  were  organized  to  support  micro-\nenterprises  and  assist  communities  in  obtaining  loans.  The  Directorate  General  of  Rural \nCommunity Empowerment of the MOHA was the executing agency. \n \nC.   \n \nIndependent  evaluations  of  the  KDP\u2014the  largest  CDD  operation  in  the  world  and  the \n13. \nmain predecessor of the PNPM Mandiri\u2014indicate an average economic internal rate of return of \nmore than 50%, well above those of other non-CDD rural infrastructure projects implemented in \nsimilar geographic areas of Indonesia. Infrastructure built under CDD projects costs about 40% \nless  than  similar  works  built  through  other  procurement  methods,  while  meeting  quality \nstandards.10  Evidence  also  indicates  that  CDD  is  likely  to  offer  better  cost  recovery  and \noperations and maintenance (O&M) of completed infrastructure facilities and services because \nof community members' strong sense of ownership. CDD helps to ensure that benefits accrue to \nthe  poor.  There  are  noneconomic  benefits  as  well.  CDD  offers  better  accountability\u2014\ntransparency  in  decision  making  and  procurement  and  the  increased  use  of  audits  have \ndemonstrably  reduced  corruption  and  leakage.  The  bottom-up  planning  processes  of  CDD \npresent  more  opportunities  for  the  inclusion  and  participation  of  poor  women  and  other \ndisadvantaged  groups  in  community  and  local  governance  processes.  Finally,  CDD  can \n\n                                                 \n9      ADB.  2006.

Manila. \n\n10  Records  of  ADB\u2019s  RISP  show  cost  savings  of  33-50%  compared  to  similar  contractor-executed  projects.  This  is \npartly because of transparency measures in decision-making and resource allocation and the use of participatory \nprocesses that reduced corruption. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ndemonstrably  operate  to  scale,  as  shown  by  the  World  Bank's  annual  CDD-related  lending \nvolume of nearly $2 billion. \n \n\nGood  targeting.  CDD  approaches  target  the  poor  well  and  reach  more  poor \nareas  than  other  types  of  projects.  The  systematic  approach  to  selecting  and \nprioritizing  poor  villages  helps  ensure  that  benefits  accrue  to  the  poor.  Studies \nalso  affirm  that  good  poverty  targeting  increases  the  poverty  impact  of  rural \ninfrastructure development.  \n\nLower  cost  and  good  quality  infrastructure.  Infrastructure  built  using  CDD \ncost about 40% less than similar works built through other procurement methods, \nwhile meeting quality standards. Under ADB\u2019s RISP, records show cost savings \nof  33%\u201350%  compared  with  similar  contractor-executed  projects.  This  is  partly \nbecause  of  transparency  measures  in  decision-making  and  resource  allocation \nand the use of participatory processes that reduced corruption.  \n\ninternal  rates  of  return  of \nHigh  economic  returns.  Average  economic \nsubprojects built using CDD in Indonesia (KDP, in particular) are more than 50%, \nwell  above  those  of  similar  types  of  rural  infrastructure  projects.  CDD  projects \nhave  generated  millions  of  person-months  of  temporary  employment  during  the \nconstruction  period.  CDD  approaches  have  also  had  a  significant  impact  on \nhousehold  expenditures.  An  estimate  of  the  impact  of  a  nationwide  roll-out  of \nPNPM Mandiri indicates a 10%\u201314% increase in the incomes of some 24 million \npeople.11 \n\nHigh  rates  of  inclusion.  The  use  of  intensive  community  facilitation  has \nimproved  the  participation  of  women  and  the  poor.  World  Bank  reports  indicate \nthat  more  than  50%  of  the  participants  in  village  decision-making  meetings  are \npoor and 70% of the workforce are poor. The participation of women in meetings \nis also high, ranging from 30% to 45%.  \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nQuick  disbursement.  Resources  for  CDD  approaches  have  been  disbursed \nquickly.

PNPM  Mandiri  is  a  nationwide  program  for \ncommunity empowerment aimed at accelerating poverty reduction. It seeks to promote a spirit \nof  cooperation  and  self-help  and  empower  rural  and  urban  communities  to  participate  in \ndevelopment.  The  program  is  linked  to  the  achievement  of  targets  set  out  in  the  Midterm \nNational Development Plan, 2005\u20132009 and poverty reduction outcomes tied to the attainment \nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Through PNPM Mandiri, the Government aims \nto  put  in  place  a  comprehensive  framework  to  streamline,  coordinate,  and  make  more \ncompatible  the  more  than  60  community-based  programs  of  18  different  ministries,  thus \ninstitutionalizing the experience of Indonesia in bottom-up planning and decision making.  \n \n16. \nThe  PNPM  Mandiri  program  consists  of  PNPM  Core  (PNPM  Inti)  and  PNPM  Support \n(PNPM Penguatan). The PNPM Core consists of five major empowerment programs,13 while the \nPNPM  Support  consists  of  the  sectoral  program  activities  of  technical  ministries  that  also \nprovide support to poor communities. \n \nA  coordinating  committee  of  ministries  implementing  community-based  anti-poverty \n17. \nprograms  has  been  created  for  PNPM  Mandiri.  The  committee,  the  PNPM  Mandiri  Oversight \nBody, provides policy directives, guidance, and managerial oversight to the PNPM Mandiri. It is \nchaired  by  the  Coordinating  Ministry  for  People's  Welfare  (Menko  Kesra);  and  its  members \ninclude  the  state  ministers  of  National  Planning  Development  Agency  (BAPPENAS);  less \ndeveloped  regions;  and  the  ministers  of  finance,  home  affairs,  public  works,  and  social \ndevelopment.14  The  composition  of  this  body  is  mirrored  in  the  provincial  and  district \ncoordination  teams,  which  are  chaired  by  the  provincial  governors  and  district  heads, \nrespectively. These regional bodies also have coordinating and monitoring functions. \n \n18. \nSupporting  the  PNPM  Mandiri  Program  is  the  PNPM  Support  Facility  (PSF),  a \nmechanism established by the Government and its partners. Through PSF, donors can provide \nhigh-quality, coordinated technical assistance, planning advice and dialogue as well as targeted \nfinancial assistance to the government to support PNPM Mandiri. The PSF has four windows of \nactivities:  (i)  direct  budget  support  and  cofinancing,  which  channels  donor  funds  to  support \nPNPM  cofinancing  programs,  such  as  community  block  grants  and  provision  of  facilitators;  \n(ii) coordination and supervision support, which provides support to PSF management and the \nPNPM  oversight  body  to  increase  their  capacity  for  the  long-term  management  of  the  PNPM; \n(iii)  on-granting  to  Indonesian  civil  society,  especially  work  on  poverty  reduction  at  the \ngrassroots level; and (iv) technical assistance to PNPM, which consists primarily of specialized \nexpertise related to monitoring and evaluation, special studies, technical assistance, workshops \nand comparative study tours to relevant programs.   \n \n\n                                                 \n12  PNPM-Mandiri: Program Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat.    \n13 These include (i) the RIS-PNPM Project (ADB), (ii) KDP (World Bank), (iii) UPP (World Bank), (iv) Support for Poor \nand Disadvantaged Areas Project (SPADA) (World Bank), and (v) Regional Infrastructure for Social and Economic \nDevelopment Project (RISE) (JBIC). \n\n14  The  Coordinating  Ministry  for  People's  Welfare  also  chairs  a  policy-level  working  group  for  the  PNPM  (Tim \nPengendali), a deputy level steering committee that includes representatives from seven ministries and is similar in \ncomposition to the ministerial working group. Donor organizations also participate in these meetings. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nConsistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  desire  to  have  a  single  strategy  for  community \n19. \nempowerment  and  poverty  reduction,  approaches,  guidelines,  and  procedures  have  been \nharmonized,  including  the  formulation  of  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  framework,  a  grievance \nredress  system,  a  common  management  information  system,  and  common  training  packages. \nThese have been prepared jointly by the Government and its development partners, under the \nleadership of the PNPM Mandiri Oversight Body. \n \n20. \nIn  2009,  PNPM  Mandiri  is  being  implemented  in  33  provinces,  465  districts  and  6,408  \nkecamatans  at  an  estimated  program  cost  of  $1.1  billion.  PNPM-Mandiri  expects  to  achieve \n100%  coverage  of  all  kecamatans  (6,627)  by  2010.  The  estimated  budget  for  program \nimplementation  in  2010  is  $1.1  billion,  with  the  Government  of  Indonesia  expected  to  provide \nalmost 50% of the funding requirement from its own resources.15  \n \n\nTable A2: Program, Budget Estimates, and Coverage of PNPM Core Program in 2009a \n($ million) \n \nGovernment \nBudget \n70.00 \n2.00 \n832.90 \n0.00 \n12.50 \n917.40 \n\n \nProject \nPNPM Urban \nRISE \nPNPM Rural \nSPADA \nRIS-PNPM \n \nSPADA  =  Support  for  Poor  and  Disadvantaged  Areas  Project,  RISE  =  Regional  Infrastructure  for  Social  and \nEconomic Development Project, RIS-PNPM = Rural Infrastructure Support to the PNPM Mandiri Project. \na The 2010 coverage and budget estimates have not yet been finalized. \nb Rural Infrastructure Support to the PNPM Mandiri Project. \nSource: The National Planning Development Agency (BAPPENAS). \n\n \nKecamatan \n1,500 \n237 \n4,270 \n186 \n215 \n6,408 \n\n       Loans \n195.00 \n49.17 \n300.00 \n5.73 \n50.00 \n599.90 \n\n \nTotal \n265.00 \n51.17 \n1,132.90 \n5.73 \n62.50 \n1,517.30 \n\nTotal  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n15 In 2008, four development agencies provided loan support to PNPM Mandiri: the World Bank ($409 million), Asian \nDevelopment Bank ($50 million), International Fund for Agricultural Development ($69 million), and Japan Bank for \nInternational  Cooperation  ($250  million).  The  loans  from  development  partners  will  finance  different  geographical \nareas and periods of PNPM Mandiri implementation. Apart from loans, bilateral donors had provided grant support \nto the PNPM Mandiri Support Facility in the amount of US$63.2 million by end-March 2009. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n37\n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR \n\n \n1. \nThe Government of Indonesia introduced community-driven development (CDD) in 1998 \nto  reduce  poverty  through  community  empowerment.  Starting  with  the  World-Bank-funded \nKecamatan Development Project (KDP) in 1998, CDD projects have evolved to become the key \ninstrument for poverty reduction, local level capacity building and service delivery in Indonesia. \nBased  on  successful  CDD  initiatives,  the  Government  launched  a  new  program  to  accelerate \npoverty  reduction  in  September  2006\u2014the  National  Program  for  Community  Empowerment \n(PNPM Mandiri). PNPM Mandiri seeks to consolidate CDD programs executed by different line \nministries  by  using  a  single  framework,  and  to  institutionalize  the  experience  in  bottom-up \nplanning  and  decision-making.  The  PNPM  program  is  funded  through  allocations  from  central   \nand local government budgets, and from grants and loans from development partners.   \n \n2. \nPNPM Mandiri has expanded rapidly over the past 3 years. It covered 2,361 kecamatans \nin  2007  and  4,768  in  2008.  It  is  expected  that  by  the  end  of  2009,  villages  in  all  6,408 \nkecamatans will receive block grants to support social and economic infrastructure investments. \nThe  total  investment  costs  for  PNPM  Mandiri  are  projected  to  be  Rp7.0  trillion  in  2009  and \nRp9.7  trillion  for  2010.  The  World  Bank  is  the  key  development  partner  in  providing  external \nfunding to PNPM Mandiri program. The World Bank's assistance is summarized in Table A3.1. \n \nTable A3.1:  World Bank Support for Community-Driven Development in Indonesia \n \n\n \nProject Name \nKecamatan Development Project I \nKecamatan Development Project  \nKecamatan Development Project III  (3A) \nKecamatan Development Project III  (3B) \nPNPM Rural  \nVillage Infrastructure Project for Java \nVillage Infrastructure Project II \nWater Supply and Sanitation Project for Low-Income \nCommunities \nSecond Water Supply and Sanitation Project for Low- \nIncome Communities \n\nType of \nAssistance \nLoan \nLoan \nLoan \nLoan  \nLoan  \nLoan \nLoan \nLoan \n\n \nPeriod \n1998\u20132002 \n2002\u20132007 \n2005\u20132009 \n2005\u20132008 \n2008\u20132012 \n1995\u20131998 \n1996\u20132000 \n1993\u20131999 \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n273.0 \n334.2 \n73.1 \n184.3 \n420.4 \n72.5 \n140.1 \n80.0 \n\nLoan \n\n2000\u20132008 \n\n77.4 \n\n \n3. \nIn  December  2007,  the  PNPM  Support  Facility  (PSF)  was  established  with  financial \ncontributions from the Government of the Netherlands ($37.3 million); the Australian Agency for \nInternational Development, AusAID ($4.2million); the Danish International Development Agency, \nDANIDA ($10.0 million), and the Department for International Development (DFID) of the United \nKingdom ($5.5 million). PSF is a trust fund chaired by the Government through BAPPENAS and \nmanaged  by  the  World  Bank.  The objective  of PSF  is  to  support  the Government  in  providing \neffective  leadership  and  management  of  the  PNPM  Mandiri,  including  (i)  ensuring  better \ncoordination,  (ii)  developing  capacity  at  all  levels  to  plan,  manage  and  improve  poverty \nreduction  programs,  (iii)  reducing  poverty  through  government  and  civil  society  partnerships, \nand (iv) supporting monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n4. \nADB\u2019s support for CDD approaches in Indonesia has evolved since the mid-1990s. ADB \nhas  supported  the  Government  in  strengthening  rural  water  and  sanitation  services  and \nirrigation  systems,  upgrading  slum  neighborhoods,  and  improving  rural  income  generation  of \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nrural  poor.  The  Rural  Infrastructure  Support  to  PNPM-Mandiri  Project  (RIS-PNPM)1  was \napproved  in  September  2008  for  $50.0  million.  The  Project  is  scheduled  to  close  on  30  June \n2011  and  will  rehabilitate  and  improve  rural  infrastructure  in  about  1,700  poor  villages  in  four \nprovinces  and  32  districts  in  Sumatra.    In  addition  to  the  World  Bank  and  ADB,  the \nGovernments  of  Japan  and  Germany  (through  KfW)  provided  assistance  for  CDD-based \nprograms.  The  Australian  Government  has  recently  earmarked  a  total  of  A$215  million  for \nPNPM support over a 5-year period from 2009 to 2014. The program will be executed through \n(i)  additional  support  to  the  PSF,  (ii)  technical  assistance,  and  (iii)  direct  transfers  to \ncommunities to promote PNPM Generasi and village microfinance grants. \n \n5. \nAusAID, and the Governments of Germany and Japan.  \n \n\nTable A3.2 provides an overview of major external assistance projects financed by ADB, \n\nTable A3.2:  Major Projects Financed by ADB, the Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment, and the Governments of Germany and Japan \n \n\nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \n\nLoan \nLoan \nLoan \nLoan \nLoan \n\nFunding \nAgency \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \n\nAmount  \n($ million) \n85.0 \n52.8 \n320.0 \n81.0 \n\n \nPeriod \n1995\u20131999 \n1997\u20132006 \n1999\u20132007 \n2000\u20132008 \n\nType of \nAssistance \nLoan \nLoan \nLoan \nLoan \n\n \nProject Name \nRural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \nRural Income Generation Project  \nCommunity and Local Government Support \nCommunity Empowerment for Rural \nDevelopment Project \nPoor Farmer\u2019s Income Improvement Project \nParticipatory Irrigation Sector Project \nCommunity Water Services and Health Project \nRural Infrastructure Support Project \nNeighborhood Upgrading and Shelter Sector \nProject \nRural Infrastructure Support to PNPM Mandiri \nWater and Sanitation Policy Formulation and \nAction Planning \nRural Areas Infrastructure Development \nSecond Rural Areas Infrastructure \nDevelopment \nRural Water Supply and Sanitation for Nusa \nTenggara Timur \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AusAID = Australian Agency for International Development, JBIC = Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation, KfW = German Development Bank. \nSource: ADB. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2003\u20132009 \n2005\u20132012 \n2005\u20132011 \n2006\u20132008 \n2005\u20132009 \n\n56.0 \n73.0 \n64.2 \n50.0 \n90.0 \n\n1994\u20131998 \n1998\u20132002 \n\n2009\u20132011 \n1998\u20132003 \n\nLoan  and \nGrant \n\nADB \nAusAID \n\n200.0 \n280.0 \n\nLoan \nGrant \n\nLoan \nLoan \n\n2001\u20132009 \n\nJBIC \nJBIC \n\n50.0 \n8.3 \n\n12.0 \n\nKfW \n\n                                                 \n1    ADB.  2008.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n39\n\nSUMMARY OF GOVERNANCE RISKS AND MITIGATION MEASURES \n\nto \n\nis  often  due \n\nCompromised  community  empowerment.  This  risk \n\n \n1. \nLessons  from  previous  rural  and  community  development  projects  have  been  used  to \nidentify  project  governance  risks  and  propose  mitigation  measures.  The  risks  affecting  the \nProject are summarized in this appendix.  \n \n2. \nlimited \nunderstanding  and  acceptance  of  a  project\u2019s  basic  principles.  The  project  coordination  and \nmonitoring unit (PCMU) of the executing agency prepares an operational manual and uses it to \norient  project  managers.  Although  the  PCMU  has  disseminated  the  manual  and  is  using  it  to \norient project managers in the ongoing RIS-PNPM, there is a continued lack of understanding \nand appreciation of the role of community facilitation among the project stakeholders. Coupled \nwith  incentives  to  complete  the  construction  of  community  infrastructure  projects  within  the \ncurrent  fiscal  year,  this  has  led  to  the  fast-tracking  of  community  mobilization  activities  and \nlimited community participation in many activities. As a result, the Project has been vulnerable \nto  influence  from  local  leadership  to  implement  infrastructure  investments  that  are  not \nnecessarily village priorities and that have been identified without accompanying empowerment \nand capacity building. \n \n3. \nBuilding  a  thorough  and  common  understanding  of  project  principles  and  procedures \nacross all stakeholders requires a systematic and persistent strategy of orientation, knowledge \nsharing,  and  information  dissemination  to  ensure  that  all  project  managers  and  staff  are \nprovided  with  the  knowledge,  skills  and  attitudes  to  implement  the  Project.  Several  subject-\nspecific training courses will be delivered to managers and staff. \n \n4. \nElite capture of project benefits. In some RIS-PNPM areas, the village head seems to \nbe the decision maker and the community the follower. This runs counter to the Project\u2019s goal of \ncommunity empowerment. It may also enable corruption since the community may not be able \nto  assert  its  rights  before  the  village  head.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  poor  and  vulnerable  groups \nneed  to  be  included  in  all  stages  of  project  implementation.  Not  only  should  these  groups  be \nadequately  represented  in  the  community  implementation  organizations,  the  prioritized  village \nproject(s)  should  target  the  poor  as  the  primary  beneficiaries.  Poverty  mapping  is  a  required \nactivity of the Project, but the mapping results will not be maximized if implementers either (i) do \nnot appreciate the need to identify the poor and to prioritize their needs, or (ii) lack knowledge \nand  skills  to  identify  the  poor.  Field  observations  indicate  that,  at  present,  some  communities \nhave problems differentiating between the needs of the poor and those of other residents of the \nvillage.  \n \n5. \nSeveral  mitigation  measures  are  proposed.  First,  the  role  of  the  village  head  and  the \nvillage  apparatus  in  the  Project  will  be  made  clear  to  the  community  during  the  socialization \nprocess.  While  the  village  head  and  village  leadership  are  active  partners  of  the  Project,  the \ncommunity  members  should  be  given  the  opportunity  to  experience  and  manage  their  own \ninvestments directly. This exercise is expected to contribute to good governance as people are \ntrained  to  become  active  players  in  the  development  process.  Second,  the  community \nfacilitators  will  be  trained  to  recognize  the  danger  of  elite  capture  and  to  help  the  community \naddress it. Third, project implementation guidelines will include provisions to avoid elite capture. \nThe training program for various stakeholders will highlight the pro-poor focus of the Project and \ncommunity facilitators and local governments will be trained in pro-poor planning and budgeting \ntechniques developed by ADB technical assistance on pro-poor planning and budgeting.1  \n                                                 \n1\u00a0ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Pro-Poor Planning and Budgeting. Manila. \n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\n         Appendix 4 \n\nLimited  capacity  for  community  facilitation.  Community  facilitators  are  at  the  front-\n6. \nline of the Project in the participating villages. The success of the Project depends greatly on the \ntimely  and  quality  interaction  of  the  facilitators  with  the  villagers.  In  several  areas,  however, \ncommunity  facilitation  has  been  weak  and  some  communities  have  received  little  support  in \nundertaking  the  planning  process  and  other  project  activities.  The  Project  will  address  this  by  \nimproving  the  selection  process  and  compensation  package  for  facilitators,  improving  their \nterms  of  reference,  offering  them  good  training  and  other  capacity  building  programs, \nimplementing  an  effective  monitoring  and  supervision  system,  and  evaluating  facilitators\u2019 \nperformance quarterly. \n\n \n\n7. \nUnclear  accountability  relationships  under  a  decentralized  system.  Under  the \ndecentralization  law,  the  national  government  no  longer  exercises  administrative  control  over \nregional  governments  and  provincial  governments  no  longer  have  administrative  control  over \ndistrict  governments.  The  project  implementation  units  are  therefore  under  the  administrative \nsupervision of the local governments. However, since this is a national project, the PCMU must \nbe  able  to  exercise  administrative  and  technical  supervision  over  the  provincial  project \nimplementation units (PPIUs) and district project implementation units (DPIUs).  Accountability \nrelationships,  however,  remain  unclear.  Performance  evaluation,  incentives  and  sanctions \nremain sensitive issues, which could affect the smooth implementation of the Project. In order to \nclarify  the  roles,  responsibilities,  and  rights  of  the  local  governments  under  the  Project,  the \nDirectorate  General  of  Human  Settlements  (DGHS)  will  execute  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding  with  each  participating  village,  specifying  the  responsibilities  of  the  village  and \nthe  Project;  and  a  partnership  agreement  to  be  signed  between  DGHS  and  district \ngovernments. \n \n8. \nInadequate  fiduciary  controls  may  enable  corruption.  There  is  a  risk  of  leakage \ndespite  the  presence  of  fiduciary  controls  in  the  Project.  Three  mitigation  measures  are \nproposed.  First,  internal  control  will  be  strengthened  by  providing  adequate  training  to \ncommunity  members  to  enable  them  to  monitor  fund  receipts  and  disbursements  and  to  audit \nthe  validity  of  all  transactions.  The  community  implementation  organization  will  be  trained  in \nfinancial planning and bookkeeping to be able to present an accurate report on fund status to \nthe community. Other community members will also be taught to monitor the physical progress \nof  the  work  and  to  verify  the  validity  and  accuracy  of  all  fund  disbursements  (especially  for \nprocurement of materials and labor). Second, the Project will establish a grievance mechanism \nthat  is  accessible  and  fully  understood  and  trusted  by  the  community  members.  Those  who \nhave  complaints  will  have  access  to  a  means  of  making  their  grievance  known.  Third,  the \ntraining program for community facilitators will provide for an overview of financial management \nsystems  so  that  all  community  facilitators  (and  not  only  those  assigned  to  provide  financial \nassistance) will be able to undertake monitoring and spot-checks in villages.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n41\n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n\nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category  \n($ million) \n\n Total \nCost \n\nPercentage of Total \nBase Cost \n\nItem \nInvestment Costs a \n1.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nBefore  the  Asian  crisis  1997\u20131998,  Indonesia  had  been  successful  in  fighting  poverty.  The  poverty  incidence\u2014the \nproportion  of  the  population  living  below  $1  per  day\u2014was  reduced  from  44%  (1976)  to  11%  (1996).  However,  the \nAsian  crisis  increased  the  poverty  incidence  to  23.6%  in  1998.  With  successful  macroeconomic  management, \npoverty  incidence  steadily  declined  to  14.2%  by  2009,  which  means  that  about  33  million  people  remain  poor.  In \naddition,  about  half  of  the  population  still  live  below  the  $2  per  day  poverty  line.  Disparities  across  regions  are \nstriking,  as  provinces  in  outlying  regions  have  poverty  incidence  that  is  well  above  the  national  average.  In  rural \nareas, poverty incidence has been about 8% higher than in urban areas. The current global economic recession is \nalso  expected  to  put  additional  strains  on  the  poor  and  near  poor  as  the  employment  opportunities  decrease  and \neconomic growth decelerates.  \n \nIndonesia\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  identified  the  major  causes  of  poverty  as:  (i)  lack  of  access  to  key  social \nservices, (ii) absence of economic opportunities, particularly in rural areas, (iii) poor infrastructure in villages, and (iv) \ninadequate  market  linkages.  Weak  governance  hampers  the  progress  made  in  addressing  these  major  causes  of \npoverty. The Medium-Term Development Plan, 2005\u20132009 focuses on poverty reduction and the achievement of the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  Its  five  priority  areas  include  (i)  job  creation  and  poverty  reduction \nprograms;  (ii)  macroeconomic  stability  with  stable  prices,  fiscal  sustainability,  and  financial  sector  reforms;  (iii) \naccelerating investments, exports, and tourism through reforms for a healthy business climate and flexible markets; \n(iv)  improved  access  to  and  quality  of  education  and  health;  and  (v)  infrastructure  development  by  improving  the \nefficiency of existing services and greater private sector participation.  \n \nIn  August  2006,  the  Government  launched  the  National  Program  for  Community  Empowerment  (PNPM  Mandiri). \nPNPM  Mandiri  builds  upon  Indonesia\u2019s  accumulated  experience  with  community-driven  development  (CDD) \nprograms  and  focuses  on  improving  local  governance  and  service  delivery  at  the  kecamatan  and  village  level  by \nencouraging  participatory  planning  and  providing  block  grants  for  investment  proposals  that  the  communities  have \ndeveloped  themselves.  The  program  will  cover  all  villages  in  the  country  during  2008\u20132015.  The  PNPM  Mandiri \npromotes  inclusive  community  facilitation  in  planning  and  implementation  of  basic  services  and  infrastructure \nimprovements, utilizes simple and transparent funds flow mechanisms, and emphasizes operation and maintenance \nof  completed  works.  The  Project  is  built  into  the  Government\u2019s  PNPM  Mandiri  and  the  project  implementation \narrangements are aligned with the PNPM Mandiri mechanisms. \n \nThe Project is in line with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for Indonesia, 2006\u20132009, which includes investments \nin rural infrastructure as strategic key area of engagement to address poverty and regional disparities, and achieve \nthe MDGs. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                     Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention (TI-G) \n1.  Key Issues  \nMany people are vulnerable to the risk of falling into poverty due to the current economic slowdown. Unemployment is \nforecast  to  rise  above  9%  in  2009  as  domestic  layoffs  spread  and  more  overseas  workers  lose  their  jobs  and  return \nhome. More people will probably be pushed into the informal sector, which already accounts for about two-thirds of the \nlabor  force\u2014where  wages  are  low  and  jobs  insecure.  Another  poverty-related  challenge  in  Indonesia  is  the  striking \ndisparity among regions, provinces, districts, and cities. The Project will cover about 1,500 rural less developed villages \nin 215 kecamatans in four provinces in Western Indonesia (Jambi, Lampung, Riau, and South Sumatra provinces). The \nfour provinces are home to about 2 million rural poor (about 400,000 households), or more than 12% of the country\u2019s \nrural poor. The four provinces are located in the southern half of Sumatra Island, where the incidence of rural poverty \nis higher than the national average.   \n \n2. Design Features  \nThe  Project  will  complement  the  Government\u2019s  PNPM  Mandiri  and  apply  the  program\u2019s  modalities  and \nimplementation structure. It will be aligned with the Government\u2019s development strategies. About 2 million rural poor \nwill benefit from basic services and infrastructure improvements, including better village roads and pathways, bridges \nand  culverts,  small  piers,  village  irrigation  schemes,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation,  drainage  works;  and \nrehabilitation  of  schools,  local  health  services,  and  multipurpose  village  buildings.  These  improvements  to  basic \ninfrastructure will give rural poor and near poor greater access to and availability of education and health services, as \nwell as short- and long-term employment opportunities. The Project also promotes good governance by building on \nthe  CDD  approach,  which  involves  communities  in  project  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring.  It  will \nincorporate  good  governance  through  (i)  advance  socialization  of  the  overall  program  objectives  so  that  the \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\n            Appendix 10 \n\nthe \n\nfunds  will  be  disbursed; \ncommunities  understand \n(ii)  ensuring  transparent,  consistent,  and  cost-effective  investment  planning  and  implementation  in  villages  through \nwell-defined procedures, guidelines, and institutional arrangements; (iii) establishment of well-defined procedures for \nthe  transfer  of  funds  to  community-managed  bank  accounts;  and  (iv)  comprehensive  monitoring  and  evaluation \n(M&E). \n\nintentions,  outcomes,  and  processes  by  which \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Findings of Social Analysis  \nIndonesia\u2019s infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, remains poor by regional standards. Electrification rates are the \nlowest in Southeast Asia, road congestion is increasing, and the conditions of rural roads are poor. A lack of access \nto infrastructure results in location poverty. People who live in isolated areas with difficult geography and poor market \nlinks  lack  both  economic  opportunities  and  adequate  levels  of  service  delivery.  More  than  15%  of  all  Indonesian \nvillages  are  inaccessible  by  vehicle  all  year  round.  Investments  in  transportation  infrastructure,  agricultural \ninfrastructure  (irrigation),  and  education  and  health  facilities  can  significantly  improve  living  conditions  in  remote \nareas, create the basis for economic growth, and improve the welfare of the local population. The positive effect of \ninfrastructure on rural welfare has been empirically demonstrated; surveys have revealed that the presence of good \nroads is strongly and significantly correlated with a community\u2019s level of mean income.  \n \nApproximately  60%  of  the  population  lives  in  rural  areas  where  agriculture  is  the  main  source  of  livelihood.  One \nreason for low incomes is that \u2018farm gate prices\u2019a are very low compared with the price in urban areas for the same \ngoods. This is due to the high real transport costs for rural marketable surpluses over poor quality roads. Transport \ncosts are even higher for non-motor-vehicle transport where there are no roads. In a rapid assessment of the causes \nof poverty in five of Indonesia\u2019s districts, villagers in isolated areas identified high transport costs to be a major cause \nof poverty. New roads in previously unserved agricultural areas can significantly lower transaction costs and hence \nraise farm gate prices, which will mean higher incomes for people in the agriculture sector, the poorest group of the \npopulation.  Better  rural  roads  will  also  help  agriculture  extension  workers  reach  rural  farmers  to  provide  technical \nadvice and know-how to increase productivity. \n \nImproved access to social services is crucial. Lack of access to quality education significantly decreases productivity, \nemployment  opportunities,  and  personal  income.  With  better  roads  and  education  facilities,  teachers  may  be  more \nwilling to work in rural schools and the teaching and learning environment would improve, increasing human capital. \nHealth and hygiene problems are still major causes of poverty in Indonesia. Through a serious illness or an accident, \na family can easily lose any accumulated asset. Investments to improve drinking water quality and rehabilitate basic \nhealth facilities will contribute to increased access to and better quality of health services in rural communities.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \nDuring  project  preparation,  regular  consultations  were  held  with  key  stakeholders  (e.g.,  government  officials  and \nnongovernmental  staff  at  national,  provincial,  and  district  levels,  community  leaders,  and  development  partners). \nDuring  implementation,  the  Project  will  maintain  broad  stakeholder  participation.  It  will  support  community \nempowerment  and  strengthen  local  capacity  to  implement  priority  programs.  The  Project  includes  assistance  to \n(i) conduct  an awareness campaign to familiarize the community members with the program; (ii) conduct community \nfacilitation,  including  poverty  mapping  in  villages,  identification  of  problems  and  needs,  evaluation  of  community \nimplementation capacity, and development of planning mechanisms and decision-making processes; (iii) assist in the \nestablishment and capacity building of community implementation organizations; (iv) assist communities to formulate  \nvillage  medium-term  poverty  reduction  plans  and  community  project  proposals  for  funding  by  block  grants; \n(v)  provide  technical  guidance  in  the  implementation  of  the  project;  and  (vi)  assist  communities  to  formulate  and \nimplement operation and maintenance (O&M) plans to ensure the sustainability of completed facilities. \n\nWhat level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n Yes    \n\n No, the Project applies CDD planning and implementations mechanisms. \n\n \nWas a C&P plan prepared? \nThese have been successfully implemented under the Government\u2019s PNPM Mandiri program in other provinces.  \n \nC.   Gender and Development  \nKey Issues. Using a consultative process, the country gender assessment identified four key themes: (i) the impact \nof  decentralization  on  gender,  (ii)  women\u2019s  inadequate  representation  in  political  decision-making,  (iii)  violence \nagainst women, and (iv) women and international migration. It noted that, while Indonesia has made progress over \nthe years, gender inequalities persist. Gender-disaggregated data are lacking. Indonesia was ranked 107th globally \nin both gender and human development indexes in 2008. b Women\u2019s longer life expectancy is more than offset by a \nmuch lower literacy rate and a smaller share of earned income. In 2007, women\u2019s labor force participation was only \n40%,  compared  with  80%  for  men.  The  shift  to  regional  autonomy  has  already  shown  potential  to  increase  the \nparticipation  of  women  in  local  governance.  During  the  2006  elections,  six  regions  selected  women  as  regional \nheads,  and  11  regions  gave  women  the  opportunity  to  be  elected  as  deputy  regional  heads.  However, \ndecentralization  has  sometimes  been  accompanied  by  a  revival  of  conservative  religious  interpretations  of  gender \nroles.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n55\n\nKey  Actions.  Drawing  a  comprehensive  conclusion  on  issues  related  to  gender  and  income  poverty  in  Indonesia  is \ndifficult, as consistent sex-disaggregated data are not available. The CDD approach applied by the Project will ensure \nthat  perspectives  of  both  men  and  women  are  represented  in  planning,  designing,  and  implementing  the  village \ninfrastructure  investments.  At  least  40%  of  the  total  CIO  membership  will  be  women.  Experience  from  the  PNPM \nMandiri reveals that the number of women on the committees ranges from a few women to entirely women, depending \non the circumstances of individual villages. In order to ensure that women will benefit directly and significantly from the \nProject, community facilitation will incorporate gender concerns into (i) selection of project management consultants and \ntraining of community facilitators, (ii) consultation and socialization of the program in the community, (iii) social mapping \nin villages, (iv) establishment of CIOs, (v) community capacity building, and (vi) formulation of the village medium-term \npoverty reduction plan plans.  \n\n \n\n  Gender action plan  (Appendix 11)    \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nIssue \n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/ \nLimited/ \nNo Impact \nLimited impact \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n \n\nLimited impact \n\nnegative \n\nLimited \nimpact \n \n\nLimited impact \n\nNo impact \n\nLabor \n\n Employment       \nopportunities \n Labor retrenchment \n Core labor \n\nstandards \nAffordability \n\nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman trafficking \nOthers(conflict, \n\npolitical instability, etc), \nplease specify \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nThe Project will build new small-scale \ncommunity infrastructure and upgrade \nexisting infrastructure, using a CDD \napproach.

Tasks  related  to  gender  equality  at  the \nnational level will be performed by the gender specialist.   \n \n3. \nAt the national level, the consultants will incorporate this GAP into project planning and \nprogramming, including training plans. In addition, they will collect gender-disaggregated data in \nbaseline and completion surveys, analyze the data, and report the findings in project progress \nreports. At the province and district levels, the consultants will ensure that measures to enhance \ngender  equality,  as  outlined  in  the  Project\u2019s  GAP,  will  be  incorporated  into  community \nfacilitation, establishment, and capacity building of community implementation organizations. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\n            Appendix 12 \n\nSUMMARY LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK  \n \n\n1. \nThe  Project  will  reduce  poverty  and  improve  local  governance  of  rural  communities  in \nthe  project  areas.  It  will  improve  the  access  of  the  poor  and  near  poor  in  the  project \ncommunities  to  services  and  basic  rural  infrastructure.  The  Project  has  three  outputs:  \n(i)  strengthened  capacity  for  community  planning  and  development,  (ii)  improved  village \nservices and infrastructure through community development grants, and (iii) improved capacity \nfor  project  implementation  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  It  will  cover  about  1,500  rural  less \ndeveloped villages in 215 kecamatans in four provinces in Western Indonesia (Jambi, Lampung, \nRiau,  and  South  Sumatra  provinces).  The  Project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement, as the scope for land acquisition and resettlement is insignificant. This appendix \nsummarizes  the  key  elements  of  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  for  the \nProject.  The  full  framework,  based  on  that  prepared  for  the  Rural  Infrastructure  Support  to \nPNPM Mandiri  Project (RIS-PNPM), is in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \n2. \nScope  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  Project  will  require  limited  land \nacquisition  for  very  small  community  facilities  and  will  not  involve  any  resettlement  of  people, \nrelocation  of  houses,  or  significant  impact  upon  productive  land  or  other  productive  assets. \nBased  on  existing  National  Program  for  Community  Empowerment  Program  (PNPM  Mandiri) \nactivities,  very  minimal  plots  of  land  are  required  for  community  investments\u2014usually  fewer  \nthan 500 square meters per village investment, which affect fewer than five households (or 25 \npersons).  It  is  expected  that  these  small  amounts  of  land  will  be  acquired  mainly  through \nvoluntary contribution by project beneficiaries.  \n \nLand acquisition and resettlement framework. The land acquisition and resettlement \n3. \nframework (i) identifies the legal and policy frameworks of the Government and appropriate ADB \npolicies  and  guidelines,  (ii)  sets  out  procedures  and  policies  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  to  guide  impacts  during  subproject  design  and  implementation,  and  (iii)  outlines \nsteps necessary for preparing preliminary land acquisition and resettlement investigations. The \nframework  guides  infrastructure  proposals,  land  acquisition  assessments,  preparation  and \nimplementation  of  plans  for  land  acquisition,  and  any  voluntary  contributions  for  small \ncommunity-level infrastructure rehabilitation and expansion. The procedures for land acquisition \nand  compensation  and  voluntary  land  contribution  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement \nPolicy  (1995)  and  government  regulations.  The  provisions  and  principles  adopted  in  this \nframework  and  in  any  subsequent  plans  will  supersede  the  provisions  of  the  relevant \ngovernment decrees and regulations currently in force in Indonesia wherever a gap exists.  \n \n4. \nThe  framework  will  be  embedded  in  the  Project\u2019s  operational  manuals.  Land  acquisition \nwill  be  kept  to  a  minimum,  as  the  location  of  rural  infrastructure  will  be  determined  through  a \ncommunity-based  approach.  Site  selection  for  community  investments  will  be  made  in  full \nconsultation  with  people  living  on  land  (titled  and  nontitled  holders).  Screening  of  potential  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  on  communities  will  follow  the  entitlement  matrix  in  the \nframework,  and  will  be  built  into  the  community  decision-making  process  and  addressed  during \nthe  preparation  of  the  village  investment  plans.  The  social  assessment  will  help  to  identify  the \naffected  people  during  the  community  facilitation  process  or  preparation  of  the  village  mid-term \npoverty reduction plans. It also will help identify any special needs of indigenous peoples or other \ndisadvantaged  groups  (e.g.,  landless,  poor,  elderly,  and  disabled  villagers  and  female-headed \nhouseholds).  \n \n5. \nIf land acquisition is required, community facilitators will work closely with the community \nto formulate a resettlement plan for an infrastructure proposal using the procedures outlined in \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n59\n\nthe  framework.  Voluntary  contributions  will  be  acceptable  only  if  (i)  there  has  been  full \nconsultation with landowners and any non-titled, affected people on site selection; (ii) voluntary \ndonations do not severely affect the living standards of affected people and are linked directly to \nbenefits  for  the  affected  people,  with  community-sanctioned  measures  to  replace  any  losses \nthat  are  agreed  through  verbal  and  written  records  by  affected  people;  (iii)  the  voluntary \ndonation  is  confirmed  through  a  verbal  or  written  record  and  verified  by  an  independent  third \nparty; and (iv) adequate grievance redress mechanisms are in place. \n \n6. \nMandiri Program and states that:  \n  \n\nThe  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  is  based  on  the  principles  of  the  PNPM \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\nno  affected  people  categorized  as  poor1  or  vulnerable  households  as  identified \nthrough social assessment will be allowed to donate their land or other economic \nassets for the project activity;   \nno affected people categorized as poor or vulnerable households will be negatively \naffected, either directly or indirectly, by any project activity; \nwhen  the  required  land  is  voluntarily  donated,  or  provided  through  another \nagreement as decided by the community, the detailed socioeconomic background \nof  and  project  impact  on  the  affected  people  will  be  carefully  recorded  and \nreported;  \nin the case of land acquisition not involving voluntary donation, compensation will \nbe made by land-for-land or cash at replacement value; \nall project activities will comply with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) \nand are conducted and recorded accordingly; \nall  the  required  information  will  be  provided  in  the  short  resettlement  plan,  which \nwill be integrated into the village proposal prepared by the community;  \nthe  resettlement  plan  will  be  endorsed  by  the  community  implementation \norganizations (CIOs), village head, and the executing agency, approved by ADB, \ndisclosed to the affected people, and uploaded to ADB\u2019s website before it can be \nimplemented; and  \nbefore  it  is  sent  to  ADB,  the  resettlement  plan  will  be  reviewed  by  a  special \ncommittee accountable to the Government and ADB.  \n\n \n7. \nImplementation  arrangements.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  will  have  overall \ncoordination responsibility for the resettlement activities in the subprojects. The existing PNPM \nMandiri  Oversight  Body  will  provide  policy  directives,  guidance,  monitoring,  and  managerial \noversight.  District  and  provincial  PIUs  will  ensure  project  activities  comply  with  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) during implementation. The PNPM Mandiri coordinating \nteams  at  the  district  level  will  review  the  resettlement  plans  and  monitor  their  implementation. \nThe  members  of  district  PNPM  Mandiri  coordinating  teams  will  include  staff  of  various  district \ngovernment  agencies,  members  of  local  legislative  bodies,  and  representatives  from  local \nnongovernment  organizations  or  universities.  Safeguards  consultants  will  be  hired  at  the \nnational,  provincial,  and  district  levels  to  assist  the  executing  agency  and  communities  in \nscreening  involuntary  resettlement  impacts,  preparing  resettlement  plans  and  undertake \nmonitoring.   \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Poor households have income levels that are below the respective provincial poverty line of the current year, as per \nthe Central Bureau of Statistics and/or identified by community members as poor households in their own community.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\n            Appendix 12 \n\nDisclosure,  consultation,  and  grievances.  Before  land  acquisition,  project  impacts  will \n8. \nbe  discussed  with  all  stakeholders,  including  the  identified  affected  people.  Project  information \nand land acquisition procedures will be shared and disclosed to communities in accordance with \nADB's policy. Separate focus group discussions and community meetings with men and women \nwill be held, especially with the affected people. The CIOs will disseminate information on possible \nland acquisition and resettlement activities to the affected people through verbal communication \nand  written  materials  in  a  language  that  is  easily  understood  by  them.  All  consultations  will  be \nrecorded and submitted as part of village investment plans. The framework, including complaint \nand  grievance  procedures,  will  be  part  of  the  project  implementation  guidelines.  These  will  be \ndisseminated by the subproject facilitator to the communities during the facilitation process and \nproject  implementation.  Local  government  and  CIO  offices  will  have  resettlement  plan  copies, \nwhich also will be posted on the ADB\u2019s website. \n \n9. \nAffected people will have the right to file complaints and/or queries on any aspects of land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  activities.  Community  complaints  will  be  managed  following  the \nPNPM  Mandiri\u2019s  Implementation  Guidelines  on  Management  of  Complaints  and  Grievances, \nwhich  meets  ADB\u2019s  requirements  on  complaint  and  grievance  mechanisms  (Supplementary \nAppendix  I).  At  the  village  level,  complaints  from  any  affected  people  can  be  filed  with  CIO \nmembers and local government staff for immediate resolution whenever possible. If the problem \ncannot be resolved, the CIO members and local government staff will assist the affected people to \nsubmit their complaints to the Project\u2019s grievance and redress committee at the district level and \nto  the  provincial  and/or  national  level  if  desired.  Community  facilitators  will  record  the  complaint \nand report to the Project\u2019s management teams. The Project will dedicate staff at district, provincial, \nand national levels to receive and follow-up on complaints from affected people.  \n \n10. \nThe  members  of  the  grievance  and  redress  committee  will  include  affected  people \n(including representatives of women, the poor, and minority groups) and government officials with \nfunctional  and  legal  authority.  The  committee  will  review  grievances  involving  all  resettlement \nbenefits or issues, except for disputes related to ownership. Grievances will be redressed two to \nfour weeks from the date of lodging the complaints at the district level and within eight weeks at \nthe provincial and/or national levels. If consensus cannot be reached, the dispute resolution will \nfollow Presidential Decree No.36/2005.2 The affected people may also file their complaint on the \nPNPM Mandiri website or via a written submission to the PNPM Mandiri administrator. \n \n11.  Monitoring and evaluation. The project M&E mechanism for land and social safeguard \nissues  will  be  included  in  the  internal  monitoring  and  evaluation  report  prepared  by  Ministry  of \nPublic Works. One section of the regular internal monitoring report will be dedicated to reporting \nand discussing issues related to social safeguards in project activities. The district PNPM Mandiri \ncoordinating  teams  will  serve  as  the  external  monitoring  agencies  of  the  Project.  The  external \nmonitoring activities specifically focusing on land acquisition will be conducted twice a year during \nthe  project implementation period.  Monitoring reports  will  be submitted  to  ADB  and uploaded to \nADB\u2019s website. \n \n12. \nCost  and  budget.  Costs  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be  provided  by \ncommunities  as  counterpart  contributions  or  from  the  community  development  grants. \nSafeguards  specialists  at  national,  provincial  and  district  levels  have  been  included  and \npackages. \nbudgeted \n\nconsultant \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n2  Affected peoples may complain to the district head or provincial governor in accordance with their respective scope \n\nand authority to change or validate decisions related to land acquisition and resettlement in project activities.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n61\n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\nIntroduction \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Project  will  support  the  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  National \n1. \nProgram  for  Community  Empowerment  (PNPM  Mandiri).  PNPM  Mandiri  adopts  a  community-\ndriven  development  (CDD)  approach  that  directly  channels  funds  to  community  groups. \nCommunity  participants  prioritize  their  development  needs,  control  resources,  and  implement \nrural infrastructure projects. The Project will adopt a sector modality to identify and implement \nrural  infrastructure  activities  in  about  1,500  rural  villages  and  215  kecamatans  in  Jambi, \nLampung,  Riau,  and  South  Sumatra  provinces  in  western  Indonesia.  The  Project  incorporates \nlessons  from  the  ongoing  Rural  Infrastructure  Support  to  the  PNPM  Mandiri  Project  (RIS-\nPNPM). \n \n2. \nThe  Project  is  categorized  as  environmental  category  B.  The  initial  environmental \nexamination was prepared for sample infrastructure interventions (Supplementary Appendix N). \nAs  the  Project  follows  a  sector-like  approach,  an  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework  (EARF)  has  been  prepared  to  guide  each  of  the  project  villages  to  carry  out \nenvironmental  screening  during  the  formulation  of  village  rural  infrastructure  proposals  and  to \nfacilitate  compliance  with  the  environmental  requirements  of  the  Government  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) during project implementation (Supplementary Appendix O). \n \nB. \n \nThe Project includes three outputs: (i) strengthened capacity for community planning and \n3. \ndevelopment; (ii) improved village services and infrastructure through community development \ngrants; and (ii) improved capacity for project implementation and monitoring and evaluation. The \nfirst  output  seeks  to  empower  communities  and  strengthen  their  capacity  to  implement  their \npriority programs. This output will also include activities to strengthen local government councils \nand the leadership that was formed under decentralization laws. The second output will provide \nblock  grants  to  villages  to  respond  to  community  rural  infrastructure  needs  that  have  been \nidentified in village medium-term poverty reduction plans. Each project village will be awarded a \nblock  grant  of  approximately  $25,000  for  rehabilitation  and/or  construction  of  small-scale  rural \ninfrastructure.  Consistent  with  the  PNPM  Mandiri  guidelines,  the  community  will  select \ninvestments  from  an  open  menu,  and  may  include  feeder  roads  and  pathways,  bridges  and \nculverts,  small  piers,  village  irrigation  schemes,  water  supply,  sanitation,  drainage  works, \nschools, health centers, community centers, and electricity. Most of the work will be carried out \nby \nthird  output  supports  project  management  and \nimplementation  support  at  national,  provincial  and  district  levels,  including  monitoring  and \nevaluation. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe  Project  covers  four  provinces  in  western  Indonesia:  Jambi,  Lampung,  Riau,  and \nSouth Sumatra. The project areas have a humid tropical climate with average annual rainfall of \n1,250 millimeters (mm)\u20132,300 mm. Temperatures range from 24\u00b0C to 32\u00b0C. There are several \nmajor  river  basins  in  each  of  the  selected  project  provinces.  The  area  includes  peat  swamps \nand  freshwater  swamp  forests.  Project  provinces  also  have  nature  reserves  and  protected \nareas, including Bukit Barisan Selatan and Kerinci Seblat national parks. The four provinces are \nin the southern half of Sumatra Island, where the incidence of rural poverty is higher than the \nnational  average.  Most  of  the  poor  live  in  rural  areas  where  agriculture  is  the  main  source  of \n\nDescription of the Environment  \n\nthemselves.  The \n\nthe  communities \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\n            Appendix 13 \n\nForecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nlivelihood.  The  lack  of  adequate  infrastructure  hampers  social  services  and  economic \nopportunities.  \n \nD. \n \n5. \nDue  to  the  small  scale  of  expected  civil  works,  most  of  the  environmental  impacts  are \nshort-term  and  temporary,  and  easily  mitigated  to  acceptable  levels.  Such  impacts  include  \n(i)  site-specific  impacts,  including  excavation  of  construction  materials;  (ii)  impacts  on  water \navailability and quality, (iii) construction impacts, and (iv) operation impacts.  \n \n6. \nMost of the rehabilitation and upgrading work for roads will be within the existing right-of- \nway. The existing environmental screening checklist being implemented by the PNPM  Mandiri \nwill exclude any infrastructure interventions that would directly affect protected, conservation, or \narcheologically  significant  areas.  Construction  materials  will  be  procured  locally.  Close \ncoordination  with  the  local  government  units  in  charge  of  the  environment  will  be  sought  to \nmonitor any illegal excavation activities in the river or embankment areas.  \n \n7. \nA site for a drinking water supply system will be kept at least 10 meters from septic tanks \nand  leach  fields  to  avoid  any  potential  contamination  of  drinking  water  sources.  Water  quality \nsampling  will  be  conducted  before  well  or  pipe  water  supply  systems  are  built  to  ensure  that \ngroundwater  and  surface  drinking  water  will  meet  drinking  water  quality  standards.  District \nengineers will provide technical inputs to ensure adequate water distribution from the secondary \nto tertiary canals and to avoid any downstream impacts caused by reduced flow and increased \npollution levels.   \n \n8. \nAny  impacts  will  be  temporary  and  can  be  minimized  by  the  mitigation  measures \nspecified in the existing government guidelines for construction of community-based civil works. \nConstruction  activities  will  be  avoided  during  the  rainy  season  as  much  as  possible.  Before \nconstruction,  communities  will  receive  technical  training  from  the  community  facilitators  in \nappropriate design, construction methods, and operation practices.    \n \n9. \nCommunities  will  be  responsible  for  properly  maintaining  improved  facilities  and  an \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  plan  is  one  of  the  eligibility  requirements  for  each  village. \nO&M  activities  will  be  fully  implemented  and  partly  financed  by  the  communities.  District \ngovernments will also monitor surface and groundwater quality through their ongoing monitoring \nprograms. \n \nE. \n \n10. \nPublic  consultations  were  conducted  in  potential  districts  for  RIS-PNPM  in  February, \nMay, and June 2008; and in May and June 2009 during field visits to Ogan Ilir District in South \nSumatra Province. The main purposes of the field visits were to (i) meet provincial and district \ngovernment officials from planning, public works, and environmental agencies, and community \nimplementation \nvillagers;  \n(ii)  review  completed  community  infrastructure  investments  implemented  under  the  Rural \nInfrastructure  Sector  Project  (RISP)1  to  learn  from  their  experiences,  including  environmental \nscreening and management during the preparation and implementation phases; and (iii) visit the \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\norganizations \n\n(CIOs) \n\nand \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2005.

The main concerns raised during the consultations included the \nneed \ninfrastructure \ninterventions;  potential  contamination  of  drinking  water  sources;  and  construction  activities \nduring  the  rainy  season.  All  of  these  concerns  have  been  addressed  in  the  project  design  by \nextending  the  community  preparation  period  to  at  least  6  months;  and  including  siting \nrequirements  for  the  water  supply  system  and  sanitation  facilities,  and  drinking  water  quality \ntesting  requirements  in  the  environmental  screening  criteria.  Since  public  consultation  is  an \nintegral  part  of  the  village  planning  and  implementation  process,  continuous  dialogue  will  be \ncarried out during project implementation.   \n \nF. \n \nAn EARF has been prepared to guide the screening of subprojects, set out institutional \n12. \narrangements \nto  environmental  management  and  monitoring,  and  define \nenvironmental assessment requirements that comply with the applicable laws and regulations of \nthe  Government  and  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines.   \n \n13. \nSince  the  Project  will  be  implemented  as  part of  PNPM  Mandiri,  it  will  use  the  existing \nprogram\u2019s  implementation  mechanisms.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  through  its  Directorate \nGeneral of Human Settlements will be the executing agency for the Project and will establish a \nproject  coordination  and  monitoring  unit  (PCMU)  at  the  national  level.  The  PCMU  will  be \nresponsible for the management, coordination, and monitoring of project activities. The Project \nwill utilize the existing project implementation units (PIUs) established at the national, provincial, \nand  district  levels  under  the  respective  PNPM  Mandiri  coordination  teams.  Each  participating \nvillage will establish a CIO or utilize an existing community organization.  \n \n14. \nEnvironmental  responsibility  will  mainly  reside  with  a  CIO,  assisted  by  a  team  of \ncommunity  facilitators.  CIOs  will  be  responsible  for  conducting  environmental  screening  and \nidentifying  mitigation  measures.  Community  facilitators  will  receive  technical  training  before \nproject  implementation  in  order  to  provide  appropriate  technical  awareness  to  each  CIO. \nSafeguards specialists will be recruited at the national and regional levels to assist community \nfacilitators, provincial and district PIUs, and the PCMU in managing the Project\u2019s environmental \naspects.  The  existing  guidelines  for  community-based  civil  works  developed  under  the  RISP \nand  to  be  used  under  the  Project,  and  the  technical  guidelines  developed  by  the  Ministry  of \nPublic  Works \nto  ensure  environmental \nconsiderations in design, construction, and operation.    \n \nG. \n \n15. \nThe Project will have significant positive impacts on the quality of life and environment of \nthe  project  communities.  Potential  negative  impacts  associated  with  the  design,  construction \nand operation of the proposed subproject activities will be temporary, minor, localized in extent, \nand can be mitigated to acceptable levels. The EARF will provide adequate guidance to screen \nsubprojects,  determine  the  appropriate  mitigation  measures  for  any  identified  negative \nenvironmental  impacts,  and  implement  environmental  management  and  monitoring  during \nproject  implementation.  It  has  been  determined  that  a  detailed  environmental  impact \nassessment is not warranted for any of the village infrastructure proposals.  \n\nfor  PNPM  Mandiri,  have  specific  provisions \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 6 October 2009) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "rupiah (Rp) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "Rp1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "$0.0001 \nRp9,555 \n", "ADB \nBAPPENAS \n", "CDD \nCIO \nCLGS \nCSP \nDGHS \nDPIU \nEARF \nEIRR \nGAP \nGDP \nKDP \nLAR \nLARF \nMDG \nMIS \nMOF \nMOU \nMPW \nMTPR \nM&E \nNGO \nO&M \nPCMU \nPPIU \nPIU \nPNPM Mandiri \n", "PSF \nRIS-PNPM \nRISP \nRPJM \n", "SNPK \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nBadan Perencanaan dan Pembangunan Nasional \n(National Planning Development Agency) \ncommunity-driven development \ncommunity implementing organization \nCommunity and Local Government Support Project \ncountry strategy and program \nDirectorate General of Human Settlements \ndistrict project implementation unit \nenvironmental assessment and review framework \neconomic internal rate of return \ngender action plan \ngross domestic product  \nKecamatan Development Project \nland acquisition and resettlement \nland acquisition and resettlement framework \nMillennium Development Goal \nmanagement information system \nMinistry of Finance \nmemorandum of understanding \nMinistry of Public Works \nmedium-term poverty reduction \nmonitoring and evaluation \nnongovernment organization \noperation and maintenance \nproject coordination and monitoring unit \nprovincial project implementation unit \nproject implementation unit \nProgram Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat \n(National Program for Community Empowerment)  \nPNPM Support Facility \nRural Infrastructure Support to PNPM Mandiri Project \nRural Infrastructure Support Project \nRencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah \n(Medium-Term Development Plan) \nStrategi Nasional Penanggulangan Kemiskinan \n(National Poverty Reduction Strategy) \n", "kecamatan \nkabupaten \n", "GLOSSARY \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "subdistrict \ndistrict \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \nVice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.
