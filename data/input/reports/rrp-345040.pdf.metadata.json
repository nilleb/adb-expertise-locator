The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\nsupported public sector reforms under the Public Sector Reform\nProgram  (PSRP)  loan  in  1997.  Additional  reform  initiatives  are\nrequired to consolidate the gains of the PSRP. The Government\nis  moving  on  a  number  of  fronts  to  achieve  an  economy  less\ndependent  on  external  flows  in  an  environment  that  promotes\ngood  governance,  strengthen  the  financial  sector  for  growth,\nand  improve  the  policy  environment  for  the  private  sector.  The\nGovernment  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  support  for  its  reform\ninitiatives  to  undertake  far-reaching  and  necessary  changes\nrequired  to  ensure  long-term  self-reliance,  improve  public\nfinancial  management,  overcome  current  financial  difficulties,\nimprove  the  environment  for  the  private  sector,  and  meet  the\nadjustment cost of the Program.\n\nThe  key  objectives  of  the  Program  loans  are  to  (i)  ensure  a\nsustainable  income  flow  for  future  generations,  (ii)  strengthen\npublic sector financial and economic management, (iii) stabilize\nthe  fiscal  position,  (iv)  enhance  the  policy  environment  for  the\nprivate  sector,  and  (v)  improve  the  effectiveness  of  the  public\nservice.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nClassification\n\nPrimary: Sustainable economic growth\nThematic: Good governance\n\nEnvironmental \nAssessment\n\nCategory B\n\nADB Loan\n\nLoans Amount\nand Terms\n\nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $4,000,000  from  its  ordinary  capital\nresources (OCR) and a loan in various currencies equivalent to\nSDR  6,320,000  from  its  Special  Funds  (SF)  resources  ($8.0\nmillion  equivalent).  The  OCR  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  15\nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  with  interest\ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  pool-based  variable\nlending  rate  system  for  US  dollar  loans  and  a  commitment\ncharge  of  0.75  percent  per  annum.  The  SF  loan  will  have  a\nrepayment  period  of  24  years  including  a  grace  period  of  8\nyears  and  a  1  percent  interest  charge  during  the  grace  period,\nand 1.5 percent thereafter.\n\n\fiii\n\nProgram Period\nand Tranching\n\nThe  Program  period  is  from  June  2001  until  May  2004.  The\nloans funds will be released in three tranches. The first tranche\nof $4.3 million equivalent ($2 million OCR and $2.3 million SF)\nwill  be  made  available  after  loan  effectiveness  and  upon\ncompliance  with  first  tranche  conditions;  the  second  tranche  of\n$5.4  million  equivalent  ($1.5  million  OCR  and  $3.9  million  SF)\nwill  be  released  upon  compliance  with  second \ntranche\nconditions; and the remaining balance of $2.3 million equivalent\n($.05  million  OCR  and  $1.8  million  SF)  will  be  released  upon\ncompliance with third tranche conditions.\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the\nloan  and  will  have  overall  responsibility  to  implement  the\nProgram.\n\nProcurement\n\nThe  proceeds  of  the  loans  will  be  disbursed  against  a  broad\nrange  of  imports,  except  for  a  negative  list  of  items.  The\nproceeds  of  the  loans  will  only  be  used  to  financed  items\nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries  except  the\nineligible  items  specified  in  a  negative  list.  Procurement  under\nthe  loans  will  follow  normal  commercial  practice  by  the  private\nsector, or standard Government procedures for procurement by\nthe  public  sector,  except  that  goods  commonly  traded  on  the\ninternational  commodity  market  will  be  procured  in  accordance\nwith procedure appropriate to the trade.\n\nCounterpart  funds  to  be  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the\nloans  will  be  utilized  to  finance  the  costs  associated  with\nthe  Fiscal  and  Financial  Management\nimplementation  of \nProgram.\n\nTechnical assistance in an amount equivalent to $950,000 for (i)\nfiscal  and  financial  advisory  services,  (ii)  economic  strategy\nadvice,  and  (iii)  building  capacity  for  a  more  efficient  public\nservice is proposed together with the Program loan. TA closing\ndate will be co-terminus with loan closing in May 2004.\n\nThe  Program  has  identified  four  major  risks:  (i)  inadequate\npolitical  commitment  over  the  next  15  years,  (ii)  national\ncapacity  constraints,  (iii)  resource  constraints  arising  from\ndramatic  cuts  in  Compact  funding,  and  (iv)  less-than-expected\nfinancial  returns  from  the  MIITF.  While  these  will  remain  risks,\nthe Program proposes mitigating measures to manage the risks\nand minimize the impact on the country\u2019s economic stabilization\nand self-reliance initiatives.\n\nCounterpart Funds\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\nRisks\n\n\fMAP\n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1.\nI submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on proposed loans\nto the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) for the Fiscal and Financial Management Program.\nThe  Report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  to  provide  economic,  financial,  and\neconomic advisory services and specialist inputs, and if the proposed loans are approved by the\nBoard, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, shall approve the technical\nassistance.\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nThe RMI consists of over 1,000 small islands having a total land area of only 181 square\nkilometers  (km2)  dispersed  over  2  million  km2  of  ocean.  The  population  of  about  53,000,\ncurrently  growing  at  an  estimated  rate  of  1.5  percent  per  annum,  is  concentrated  in  two  main\nurban  centers,  Majuro  and  Ebeye.  Like  several  of  the  smaller  Pacific  countries,  the  RMI  is\nremote  from  major  markets,  deficient  in  both  the  quality  and  quantity  of  land  resources,  and\nacutely short of skilled labor, although it does possess potentially rich marine resources built on\nfish and seabed minerals. The RMI has a dual economy, with a subsistence sector coexisting\nwith a modern urban cash economy. It has limited productive potential, particularly in terms of\nagricultural  potential,  while  land-based  investment  opportunities  are  further  constrained  by  a\ntraditional land tenure system that complicates or precludes secure access to land.\n\n3.\nAfter World War II, the United Nations (UN) established the Trust Territory of the Pacific\nIslands (TTPI), comprising the Marshall Islands, as well as the Caroline Islands (now the FSM)\nand the Northern Mariana Islands, to be administered by the United States (US). The Marshall\nIslands  became  a  republic  in  May  1979,  following  the  approval  of  a  constitution  through  a\nnational  referendum.  In  1982,  the  US  and  RMI  signed  a  Compact  of  Free  Association\n(Compact).  The  Compact  came  into  effect  in  1986  when  the  UN  Trusteeship  was  terminated.\nThe national constitution of 1979 provides for a parliamentary system with legislative, executive,\nand judiciary branches. The political structure is a blend of the American and British systems of\nGovernment.  Legislative  power  is  vested  in  the  House  of  Representatives,  the  Nitijela.  In\naddition, the traditional Council of Chiefs, or lroij, acts as a consultative body that may request\nreconsideration of any bill affecting customary law, particularly as it relates to land tenure.\n\n4.\nDuring  the  Trust  period,  the  US  was  given  permission  to  use  the  TTPI  for  military\npurposes.  A  naval  base  was  established  on  Kwajalein  atoll,  which  was  later  developed  as  a\nmissile  test  site  as  part  of  a  US  global  system  for  interballistic  missiles.  Since  1947,  the  base\nhas provided employment for 300-800 Marshallese who received wage equivalent to those paid\nin the US. In the period up to 1986, a small cadre of Marshallese was educated and employed\nin Majuro, again at wages equivalent to those in the US.\n\n5.\nSince the Compact became effective in 1986, the RMI has been receiving considerable\neconomic  and  technical  assistance  from  the  US.  While  containing  specific  provisions  on  the\nrelations between the two Governments in areas such as foreign affairs, immigration, defense,\nand environmental protection, the Compact revolves principally around (i) economic assistance,\nboth grant and program assistance, with a number of provisions regarding trade and taxation;\nand  (ii)  compensatory  payments,  associated  with  research,  medical,  and  agricultural/food\nprograms, for the use of the RMI's territory for nuclear tests carried out in the 1940s and 1950s\nin  the  four  atolls  of  Bikini,  Enewetak,  Rongelap,  and  Utrik,  and  for  continuing  US  military\noperations on Kwajalein atoll. Total Compact payments have been declining from 70 percent of\ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  the  late  1980s  to  below  50  percent  at  present.  However,\n\n\f2\n\nCompact funding is the lynchpin of the economy and effective utilization of these funds remains\na key policy issue in the country.\n\nIII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\n\nA. \n\nRecent Economic Performance and Prospects\n\n6.\nOver the last 15 years, the RMI economy has been largely stagnant. The overall GDP (in\n1991 prices) increased by about 17 percent from $53.4 million in 1986 to $62.6 million in 1999.\nThis was, however, not enough to counterbalance the growth rate of population which, despite a\nlarge  migration  to  the  US,  increased  by  34  percent  over  this  period.  As  a  result,  there  was  a\nsignificant decline in per capita income in the country, from $1,404 (in 1991 constant prices) in\n1986 to $1,230 in 1999, a decline of about 12 percent (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per Capita\n(1991 Prices)\n\na\nt\ni\np\na\nc\n\n \n\n \nr\ne\nP\nP\nD\nG\n\n)\n$\n(\n\n1800\n\n1600\n\n1400\n\n1200\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999\n\nSource: RMI Office of Planning and Statistics\n\nYear\n\n7.\nAgriculture  and  fisheries  have  traditionally  been  the  mainstay  of  the  economy.  But  in\n1999,  the  share  of  agriculture  and  livestock  in  GDP  was  only  4.5  percent,  lower  than  in  1995\n(6.7  percent).  Production  of  copra,  the  main  cash  crop,  declined  from  6,815  metric  tons  (t)  in\n1986  to  3,348  t  in  1999.  With  an  exclusive  economic  zone  of  over  2  million  km2,  fisheries  is\nconsidered as the sector with potential for generating economic growth. Fishing accounted for\n7.4 percent of GDP in 1999, but a large part of the income was from royalties from fishing done\nby foreign companies in Marshallese waters. The total fish catch by Japanese and other foreign\nfishing vessels has been declining, from 12,993 t in 1989 to 2,457 t in 1999.\n\n8.\nManufacturing is virtually nonexistent. Processing of copra products runs at a loss and\nhas a negative value-added of 0.2 percent of GDP in 1999. Other manufactured products and\nhandicrafts  were  only  1.9  percent  of  GDP  in  1999,  lower  than  in  1995  (2.5  percent).  While  a\ntourist sector is beginning and has potential for income generation, it is still limited.\n\nElectricity,  gas  and  water,  and  construction  are  the  only  part  of  the  goods-producing\n9.\nsector  that  forms  a  sizable  portion  of  GDP  and  has  been  growing  at  least  slightly  (from  12.2\npercent of GDP in 1995 to 13.25 percent in 1999).\n\n\f3\n\n10.\nThe service sector is the dominant part of the economy, accounting for 71.4 percent of\nGDP in 1999, marginally up from 69.9 percent in 1995. Public administration generates nearly 5\ntimes  as  much  income  as  agriculture.  The  service  sector  depends  on  the  public  sector\nexpenditures, which in turn depend largely on external flows. This underlines the important fact\nthat  external  flows  are  vital  for  the  Marshallese  economy;  without  these  flows  in  one  form  or\nanother, the economy in its present form would collapse.\n\nDespite  decline  in  per  capita  incomes,  there  has  been  a  marked  improvement  in  the\n11.\nhealth  status  in  the  country  over  the  last  15  years.  Infant  and  child  death  rates  have  been\nconsiderably  reduced:  infant  deaths  from  63  to  37  per  1,000  live  births  and  mortality  rates  of\nunder 5 from 93 to 48 per 1,000 live births. Life expectancy has increased from 61 in 1988 to 67\nin 1999. Family planning is also making progress and the total fertility rate has declined from a\nvery high level of 7.2 in 1988 to 5.7 in 1998. However, informal safety-nets are beginning to fail,\nfamily structures are breaking down, and there is evidence of hunger, child neglect,1 and other\nsymptoms of emerging poverty.\n\n12.\nThere has been progress in education too. The 1999 census reported that as much as\n97  percent  of  the  household  population  of  10  years  and  older  were  literate  (able    to  read  and\nwrite a simple message in any language). Access to elementary and secondary education also\nincreased  significantly  during  the  last  10  years.  School-age  children  enrolled  in  elementary\nschools  increased  from  82  percent  in  1988  to  84  percent  in  1999  and  those  in  secondary\nschools from 47 percent in 1988 to 69 percent in 1999. The performance of schools and training\ninstitutions  in  RMI  is,  however,  poor.  The  output  standards  are  below  regional  parity.  A\nsignificant number of students are leaving school ill equipped for a productive life, and low skill\nlevels  in  the  labor  force  deter  investment.  Major  education  issues  are  poor  quality  of  public\neducation, especially on the outer islands, and the relevance of school curricula to the workforce\nrealities in the Marshall Islands.\n\n13.\nThe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) ranks the Marshall Islands 8th out\nof 12 Pacific Islands developing countries on both its human development and poverty indices.\nThis  lower  ranking  status  reflects  the  UNDP  assessment  that  one  of  four  of  the  population  is\nilliterate,  almost  one  child  in  five  is  underweight,  and  almost  one  household  in  five  does  not\nhave  access  to  safe  water.  The  country  faces  formidable  challenges  in  the  form  of\nenvironmental  degradation,  accelerated  sea-level  rise,  the  legacy  of  nuclear  testing,  and\nlocalized pollution in several overcrowded islands.\n\n14.\nDue  to  relatively  easy  migration  rules  to  the  US,  a  significant  number  of  Marshallese\nhave been emigrating to the US and the actual growth rate of population during 1988-1999 was\nonly 1.5 percent per year (while the natural rate of increase of population was 3.5 percent per\nyear) and that of the labor force only 2.4 percent per year. However, employment generation in\nthe  country  over  the  last  15  years  was  negligible  and  employment  in  the  monetized  sector  in\nfact declined by about 10 percent during 1988-1999. As a result, unemployment increased from\n12.5 percent in 1988 to 30.9 percent in 1999. It is 73.3 percent in the age group 15-19 and 56.6\npercent in the age group 20-24.\n\n15.\n\nThis unemployment situation may constitute a veritable social time bomb in the country.\n\n                  \n\n1  Development  in  the  1990s  of  a  brisk  market  in  overseas  (mostly  US)  adoption  of  Marshallese  children\u2014and  the\npromotional role of law firms acting as go-betweens\u2014was a clear sign of growing malaise, especially among the\nurban unemployed.\n\n\f4\n\nAs has happened in many other developing countries, such high unemployment can become a\nsource of social problems, including the breakdown of law and order. So far the RMI has had a\nrelatively good record on law and order, but its continuance cannot be taken for granted if the\nunemployment situation continues to worsen. To avoid such eventuality, the Government must\nurgently consider ways of increasing employment. Even if the growth of the labor force could be\nslowed down to 1.5 percent per year (from the current 2.4 percent), there would be a need to\ncreate employment for about 10,000 workers between 1999 and 2020, or roughly 500 jobs per\nyear.\n\nTable 1: The Emerging Unemployment Problem in the RMI\n\nItem\nA.

Marshall Islands Statistical Abstract 1998 & 1999. Majuro.\n\nA  related  development  issue  is  labor  productivity  and  sustainability  of  wage  rates.  A\n16.\nminimum  wage  rate  of  $1.5/hour  was  established  in  1986  and  was  increased  to  $2/hour  in\nJanuary 1995. The Government as the single largest employer maintains this standard, while in\nthe  private  sector  many  smaller  businesses  reportedly  pay  less  than  the  minimum  wage.  The\nGovernment  generally  pays  higher  rates  than  the  private  sector  for  nominally  equivalent  jobs.\nOutput per person, on the other hand, appears significantly higher in the private sector. This is\ngenerally  believed  to  result  largely  from  the  greater  autonomy  enjoyed  by  managers  in  the\nprivate sector in motivating, disciplining, and rewarding employees, free from political pressure\nand unhindered by the notion that permanent employment is a right. By regional standards,  the\nRMI\u2019s public service pay rates are high, 2-3 times higher than the rates prevailing across most\nSouth  Pacific  island  countries,  and  many  times  higher  than  in  Southeast  Asian  countries.  The\nflow-on  effect  to  private  sector  wage  rates  and  high  operating  costs,  combined  with  the\ncontinued  strength  of  the  US  dollar,  hurts  the  RMI\u2019s  competitiveness  as  a  tourism  and\ninvestment destination.\n\nB. \n\nDevelopment Objectives, Strategy, and Plans\n\n17.\nThe inflow of money from the Compact led to major disequilibria in the RMI economy. It\nlessened pressure for fiscal balance, and encouraged imports and discouraged development of\nnew exports. Support for wage levels that were not in line with levels of productivity kept costs\nof production higher than they otherwise would be, and worked against the development of new\nproductive activities. These negative factors were aggravated by the Government\u2019s practice of\nborrowing against future Compact receipts. Part of this money has been invested in projects of\ndoubtful  quality  and  with  low  or  negative  returns,  while  an  important  part  has  been  used  to\nfinance budget deficits.\n\n\f5\n\nA  report2  by  the  US  General  Accounting  Office  (GAO)  reviewing  the  effectiveness  of\n18.\nCompact  funds  in  promoting  \u201ceconomic  self-sufficiency\u201d  of  the  country  came  out  with  some\nsobering  conclusions  about  the  quality  of  development  performance  in  the  country.  After  an\nextensive review of the programs and projects financed through Compact funds, it concluded:\n\n\u201cCompact expenditures to date have led to little improvement in economic development\nin the RMI. Per capita incomes, when adjusted for inflation, have fallen in the RMI since\nthe  beginning  of  the  Compact.  Compact  funds  spent  to  support  general  government\noperations  have  maintained  high  government  wages  and  a  large  level  of  public\nemployment  that  has  discouraged  private  sector  growth.  Compact  spending  to  create\nand improve infrastructure has not directly contributed to significant economic growth. In\naddition,  Compact  funded  business  ventures  have  generally  failed.  Money  has  been\nwasted,  because  the  authorities  did  not  conduct  cost-benefit  or  feasibility  analyses  or\nplan  for  local  environmental  conditions  or  maintenance  needs  and  were  not  held\naccountable for the effective use of funds. The persistent problems we found in project\nplanning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  demonstrate  a  lack  of  adequate  skills  and\nexperience in managing projects and large budget funds.\u201d\n\n19.\nThe  Government  of  the  RMI  has  been  attempting  structural  adjustments  to  stimulate\neconomic development and contain budgetary deficit for over half a decade. Under the Public\nSector Reform Program (PSRP) loan from ADB in 1997, the Government moved on a number\nof  fronts,  including  improving  the  policy  environment  for  the  private  sector,  strengthening  the\nfinancial  sector  for  growth,  and  achieving  an  economy  less  dependent  on  external  flows.\nHowever, with the death of President Amata Kabua, the main champion of reforms, there were\nsome slippages. The new Government which took office in January 2000 is reform-oriented and\nbelieves  that  follow-up  actions  as  well  as  additional  reform  initiatives  are  required.  Recent\nactions  taken  including  meeting  targets  on  staff  reduction  under  PSRP  as  well  as  other\nanticorruption  and  good  governance  measures  initiated  by  the  Government  lend  credence  to\nthis commitment.\n\n20.  The  current  leadership  in  the  country  wants  to  ensure  that  serious  efforts  are  made  to\nchange the past attitudes and devise a new political consensus for economic self-sufficiency. In\nan  interview  with  Universal  News  in  Majuro  20  January  2000,  President  Kessai  Note  put  the\nproblem in the following terms:\n\n\u201cOne of the most important tasks facing all of us in the RMI is to work together to make\nthe  Marshall  Islands  more  self-reliant  to  the  extent  possible.  For  many  years  we  have\nbeen trained to depend on other countries to provide for our daily basic needs. It is an\nage-old attitude that needs to be changed.\n\nThe US has been generous in the past. However, we both realize that at the end of the\n15-year period, the financial assistance provided was not sufficient to make the Marshall\nIslands a self-supporting country, which was the primary aim of the Compact when we\nstarted  it.  The  economic  assistance  provided  under  the  Compact  has  come  and  gone\nwithout much change to the level of economic development in the Marshall Islands.\u201d\n\n21.\nIt is this clear recognition of the failures of the past and a determination to reverse the\npast trends that provide the setting to the new development strategy that the Government is in\n\n                  \n\n2 U.S.  General  Accounting  Office.  September,  2000.  Foreign  Assistance:  US Funds to Micronesian Nations Had\n\nLittle Impact on Economic Development.  Washington, D.C.\n\n\f6\n\nthe  process  of  adopting.  The  Government  requested  ADB  in  August  2000  for  a  follow-up\nprogram  loan  for  fiscal  and  financial  sector  reforms:  to  undertake  economic  and  financial\nplanning to implement strategies for long-term financial stability, establish a national trust fund\nto ensure sustainable financing of the budget and social development activities over the longer\nterm, stabilize its immediate financial position, and continue further reforms in the financial and\nfiscal sectors.\n\n22.\nThe  economic  provisions  under  the  Compact  between  the  US  and  the  RMI  will  be\nexpiring  in  2001.  Until  a  new  Compact  is  negotiated,  the  RMI\u2019s  economy  will  be  in  transition.\nADB  assistance  has  been  considered  essential  to  help  the  RMI  lay  the  groundwork  for  future\ndevelopment and, in particular, take the economy through this transition period expected to last\nfor  another  2-3  years  until  the  renegotiated  economic  provisions  of  the  Compact  come  into\neffect.  As  elaborated  in  the  development  policy  letter  from  the  President  of  the  RMI  (see\nAppendix 1) and in section V, the Program is designed to achieve sustainable pro-poor growth\nwithout continued reliance on external assistance. It is also designed to achieve greater equity\nand  improved  quality  of  life  of  the  people  which,  in  the  Pacific  context,  represents  a  major\npoverty reduction initiative.\n\nIV. \n\nPUBLIC SECTOR AND FISCAL ISSUES\n\nA. \n\nPublic Sector\n\n23.\nThe  public  sector  is  overwhelmingly  dominant  in  the  RMI  economy.  The  national  and\nlocal governments not only provide an important share of formal employment in the economy,\nbut  also  own  and  control  a  large  number  of  corporations  and  statutory  bodies.  While  many\nGovernment  holdings  have  been  corporatized  over  the  years,  and  subsidies  successfully\nreduced or eliminated in many cases, public sector dominance of the economy remains.\n\nPublic administration consists of the national civil service under the responsibility of the\n24.\nPublic Service Commission, the Marshall Islands Development Authority (MIDA), the Kwajalein\nAtoll Development Authority (KADA), and 24 local governments. MIDA was established in 1984\nas  the  authority  to  investigate,  develop,  and  implement  social  and  economic  development\nprograms and projects. It was created to coordinate Government actions to the development of\npublic and private businesses and as such, is regarded as the business arm of the Government.\nThe funding source has always been the capital account of Section 211 of the Compact. These\nfunds  are  now  used  mainly  for  debt  servicing  and  MIDA  has  lost  much  of  its  importance.  The\nKADA was set up in 1985 to plan and implement development activities on Kwajalein Atoll, with\na view to improving living conditions in Ebeye.\n\n25.\nThe  TTPI  administration  left  the  RMI  with  a  large,  costly,  and  poorly  performing  public\nservice,  a  condition  that  continued  after  independence.  In  1994  a  Presidential  Committee\nlooking  at  public  sector  reform  concluded  that  the  service  was  overstaffed  and  inefficient,  had\nmany  unproductive  employees,  lacked  skilled  staff,  and  showed  widespread  duplication.\nReforms  over  the  past  four  years  have  had  a  major  impact,  but  further  improvements  are\nneeded.\n\nB. \n\nCivil Service\n\nThe  Constitution  assigns  responsibility  for  the  public  service  to  the  Public  Service\n26.\nCommission (PSC). The PSC is the employing authority of the public service, charged with its\norganization, management, efficiency, and economy of the service. Under the Constitution, PSC\n\n\f7\n\nmembers have security of tenure similar to High Court judges, and the PSC is required to act\nindependently, not under direction from the Cabinet or anyone else.\n\n27.\nThe  Constitution  states  that  the  PSC  should  take  into  account  \u201cthe  need  to  afford\nreasonable employment opportunities for employment of citizens\u2026\u201d and should act \u201cconsistently\nwith government economic and social policy, bearing in mind that the conditions of employment\nin  the  public  service  are  a  major  element  in  the  well-being  of  the  Marshall  Islands.\u201d  This\nrequirement,  effectively  in  force  well  before  independence,  reflects  the  role  of  government\nemployment in widely distributing US-provided income within the RMI community.\n\n28.\nUntil  1996,  the  RMI  civil  service  grew  in  size  and  complexity,  supported  by  Compact\npayments.  For  many  years,  growth  in  the  civil  service  aroused  some  concern  but  little  action.\nWhile  funds  were  available  to  cover  the  growing  number  of  civil  servants,  there  was  little\napparent  need  for  restraint.  The  total  personnel  in  the  public  service  increased  from  1,751\nworkers  in  1988  to  a  high  point  of  2,303  by  1995.  At  that  time  there  were  10  ministries;  the\nMinistry  of  Education  was  the  largest  with  733  employees  and  the  Ministry  of  Health  and\nEnvironment had 411 employees (Table 2).\n\n29.\nBy  1995  it  was  realized  that  the  public  service  could  not  continue  to  expand.  This\nrealization was triggered by the fiscal crisis caused by Compact revenues drying up and by the\nfailure  of  government\u2019s  investments  from  borrowings  to  yield  expected  returns.  The  payroll\nbecame  increasingly  difficult  to  fund  and  the  Government  was  forced  to  address  the  size  and\ncost of the civil service. The Public Sector Management Improvement Program approved by the\nNitijela as part of the PSRP recommended wide-ranging cuts. The Program was successful in\nreducing the size of the public service, but was less successful in raising the efficiency levels.\n\n30. With the implementation of the reduction-in-force (RIF) program, the public service was\nreduced  by  more  than  a  third  to  1,484  in  July  2000.  Table  2  shows  how  this  reduction  was\nachieved and which areas were affected most. The reductions fell unevenly across the service.\nThe social service departments took longer to achieve the proposed cuts as ministries tried to\nwork out how to cope with the staff reductions while maintaining services. In the end, education\nand  police  services  achieved  fewer  cuts,  while  health  numbers  eventually  fell  below  initially\nanticipated  levels.  The  notable  exception  to  this  was  the  elimination  of  the  Ministry  of  Social\nServices, which involved eliminating the school feeding program in 1996 and retrenching almost\n200 employees. The remaining services from this department were transferred to the Ministry of\nInternal Affairs and Social Welfare.\n\n\fTable 2: Staff Numbers by Agency, 1995-2000\n\nMinistry/Unit\n\nOctober 1995\n\n8\n\n7\n13\n24\n4\n733\n61\n39\n411\n11\n 32\n 160\n 36\n\n 21\n 11\n 10\n 180\n 223\n 6\n 77\n\n 11\n\n 7\n 3\n 20\n 15\n 10\n\nNitijela\nRecommended\nCeiling\n 5\n 8\n 19\n 2\n 630\n 52\n 32\n 351\n 11\n 39\n 139\n 31\n\n 18\n 9\n 8\n 72\n\n 5\n 2\n 17\n 13\n 8\n 13\n\nActual\nJuly\n2000\n 7\n 8\n 22\n 3\n 667\n 35\n 28\n 343\n 9\n 49\n 161\n -\n\n 10\n 6\n 4\n 66\n\n 16\n\n 4\n\n 4\n 2\n 15\n 12\n 11\n\n 2\n\n% Change\nOct 95-\nJul 2000\n\n-38\n-8\n-25\n-9\n-43\n-28\n-17\n-18\n+53\n+1\n-100\n\n-52\n-45\n-60\n-63\n-100\n+167\n-100\n\n-64\n\n-43\n-33\n-25\n-20\n+10\n\n-100\n-36\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n Auditor General\n Cabinet\n Chief Secretary's Office\n Council of Iroij\n Education\n Finance\n Foreign Affairs\n Health and Environment\n Environmental Protection Authority\n Internal Affairs (& Social Welfare)\n Justice\nMarshall Islands Marine Resources\n     Authority (MIMRA)\n Nitijela\n Planning & Statistics\n Public Service Commission (PSC)\n Resources & Development/Public\n Social Services\n Transport & Communication\n Transport & Communication Shipping\n     Operations\n Transport & Communication Airport\n     Operations\n Public Defender\n Marshall Islands Development Authority\n Judiciary Courts\n Postal Services\n Attorney-General\n Regulatory Authority\n Others\n Vacancies\n \nSource: Ministry of Finance payroll.\n\nTotal\n\n 178\n 2,303\n\n 1,484\n\n 1,484\n\n31.\nThe  other  departments  that  achieved  large  reductions  were  those  interfacing  with  the\nprivate sector or involved in providing services that could be supplied by the private sector. The\nMinistry  of  Public  Works,  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications,  and  the  Ministry  of\nResources  and  Development  were  all  hard  hit  by  the  staff  cuts.  In  part,  this  reflected  the\nGovernment recognition that the government\u2019s role was spread too widely and too thinly to be\neffective.  One  of  the  achievements  of  the  RIF  is  that  it  made  the  Government  focus  on  those\nservices that are important to maintaining its \u201csocial contract\u201d with the people, and in so doing\ncleared  the  way  for  the  private  sector  to  move  into  areas  previously  occupied  by  the\nGovernment. However, the proposition that the private sector will necessarily be a better service\nprovider, particularly where the circumstances make commercial competition unlikely, is not yet\nproven.\n\n32.\nThe  leading  case  is  interisland  shipping.  With  public  service  withdrawal  from  providing\nshipping  services,  maintenance,  and  public  works,  a  number  of  outer  islands  are  suffering\n\n\f9\n\nbecause of hitches in implementing the privately run domestic shipping service. Public works is\nanother  problem  area.  The  department  was  largely  dismantled  under  the  RIF  as  many\nconstruction  and  maintenance  jobs  were  contracted  to  the  private  sector,  but  the  Government\nlacks civil engineering and public works expertise in-house to specify and supervise contracted\nwork. These problems stem not from the inability of the private sector to cope with the work but\nwith  the  capacity  of  the  public  service  and  the  need  for  the  service  to  recognize  its  changing\nrole.\n\nC. \n\nFiscal Development and External Position\n\n33.\nDisciplined  fiscal  management  is  a  key  element  in  the  sound  development  of  the\neconomy.  Recent  budgetary  operations  summarized  in  Table  3  show  that  despite  the  public\nsector reform program launched in the mid-1990s, improvement in the RMI\u2019s budgetary situation\nhas  not  been  sustained.  Current  expenditures  have  declined  from  $53.8  million  in  FY1996  to\n$50.1 in FY2000; but that was largely due to lower interest payments as the large borrowings of\nthe past were being paid off. Current expenditures minus interest payments actually increased\nfrom  $46.3  in  FY1996  to  $48.2  million  in  FY2000.  Payments  against  wages  and  salaries\ndeclined  from  $21.4  million  in  FY1996  to  $17.3  million  in  FY2000  and  subsidies  to  public\nenterprises  from  $2.6  million  to  $1.5  million.  However,  \u201cother  subsidies  and  transfers\u201d  have\nincreased  from  $4.7  million  in  FY1996  to  $10.3  million  in  FY2000,  which  more  than\ncompensated for decline in wages and salaries and in subsidies to public enterprises. Taxes as\na  percentage  of  current  expenditures  declined  from  36  percent  to  32  percent  over  this  period\nand  all  revenues  as  percentage  of  GDP  from  37  percent  to  23  percent.  The  current  deficit  is\nestimated to be $11.8 million in FY2000, which will be 12.3 percent of GDP, significantly higher\nthan the level in FY1997 when the PSRP was launched.\n\n34.\nDuring  FY1999  and  FY2000,  the  Government  utilized  about  $23  million  of  its  financial\nassets and by the end of FY2000, the usable government financial assets were reduced to $0.2\nmillion, the lowest ever in recent history.\n\n35.\nThe main area of improvement is government debt, which declined from $127.7 million\nin FY1995 to $60.5 million in FY2000. These debts are expected to be substantially paid off by\nFY2001 and this will save the country debt service payment of about $20.0 million per year. The\nfuture  strength  of  government  finances  and  the  income  security  of  future  generations  will\ndepend on how wisely these savings are utilized in the future.\n\nThe balance of payments account in the RMI is very much a reflection of the government\n36.\naccounts.  The  imports  of  goods  and  nonfactor  services  in  FY1999/2000  were  estimated  to  be\n$69.3 million, about 71 percent of GDP, whereas exports of goods and nonfactor services were\nonly  $14.9  million,  about  15  percent  of  GDP.  The  deficit  was  more  than  fully  met  by  factor\nincomes  and  unrequited  transfers  (including  Compact  payments),  which  were  $61.7  million  in\nFY1999/2000. The current account surplus of $7.3 million was not, however, sufficient to meet\nthe net outflow on capital account of $14.7 million, the result was a drawdown of the financial\nholdings  of  the  national  and  local  governments.  The  emerging  problems  on  the  balance  of\npayments account are a mirror image of the government\u2019s budgetary position reviewed above.\n\n\fTable 3 : Central Government Finances, FY1991-FY2001\n($ million)\n\nItem\n\nFY1995\n\nFY1996\n\nFY1997\n\nFY1998\n\nFY1999\n\n10\n\n68.8\n27.8\n18.6\n8.1\n2.7\n7.0\n0.8\n9.2\n1.9\n1.9\n0.8\n4.6\n41.0\n18.0\n30.4\n10.6\n\n60.4\n52.9\n18.8\n17.8\n6.8\n2.1\n5.4\n2.1\n7.5\n\n-7.1\n8.4\n\n-7.3\n10.7\n17.9\n0.0\n\n71.5\n24.7\n18.7\n7.6\n2.7\n7.5\n0.8\n6.0\n1.3\n0.6\n1.6\n2.4\n46.8\n22.9\n30.9\n15.9\n\n56.6\n51.8\n18.0\n21.6\n5.4\n2.6\n3.6\n0.6\n4.8\n\n-4.2\n14.9\n\n-11.0\n7.9\n19.0\n0.0\n-3.8\n\n(percent of GDP)\n74.7\n74.6\n25.8\n30.2\n48.9\n44.5\n59.2\n65.5\n54.2\n57.4\n8.1\n5.0\n-4.4\n-7.8\n15.5\n9.1\n\n($ million)\n\n42.5\n9.3\n\n108.1\n0.9\n\n47.0\n12.4\n\n97.0\n1.2\n\nFY2000\nBudget\n62.1\n22.6\n15.8\n7.5\n3.0\n5.0\n0.3\n6.8\n3.0\n0.3\n0.6\n2.9\n39.6\n15.8\n30.9\n8.7\n\nFY2000\nest\n62.1\n22.5\n16.1\n8.0\n3.1\n3.9\n1.1\n6.4\n3.4\n0.5\n0.3\n2.2\n39.6\n15.8\n30.9\n8.7\n\nFY2001\nBudget\n68.8\n24.6\n16.9\n8.5\n3.2\n4.8\n0.3\n7.7\n4.4\n0.3\n0.3\n2.8\n44.1\n15.8\n30.9\n13.2\n\n53.8\n46.8\n17.1\n18.8\n2.3\n1.5\n7.0\n0.1\n7.0\n\n-8.4\n8.4\n\n-13.4\n5.3\n18.7\n5.0\n0.1\n\n64.7\n23.5\n41.2\n56.0\n48.7\n7.3\n-8.8\n8.7\n\n29.2\n4.7\n\n58.7\n0.9\n\n57.1\n50.1\n17.3\n19.0\n1.9\n1.5\n10.3\n0.1\n7.0\n\n-11.8\n5.1\n\n-11.6\n7.1\n18.7\n1.3\n5.3\n\n64.7\n23.4\n41.3\n59.5\n52.2\n7.3\n-12.3\n5.3\n\n23.9\n0.2\n\n60.5\n1.7\n\n53.8\n44.1\n17.5\n19.1\n0.9\n1.5\n4.9\n0.1\n9.7\n\n-3.6\n15.0\n\n-16.0\n9.0\n25.0\n2.5\n-1.6\n\n69.6\n24.9\n44.7\n54.4\n44.6\n9.8\n-3.7\n15.2\n\n25.5\n1.8\n\n44.5\n1.7\n\n65.5\n26.7\n16.9\n7.6\n2.5\n6.2\n0.5\n9.8\n2.3\n0.6\n0.6\n6.3\n38.8\n15.8\n30.9\n7.9\n\n55.3\n48.4\n17.0\n18.8\n4.3\n1.4\n6.1\n0.8\n6.9\n\n-5.9\n10.2\n\n-27.9\n15.0\n42.8\n0.0\n17.7\n\n67.3\n27.4\n39.9\n56.8\n49.7\n7.1\n-6.1\n10.5\n\n29.3\n4.8\n\n70.1\n1.0\n\nTotal revenue and grants\n\n Total domestic revenue\n\n Taxes\n\n Income\n Gross revenue\n Imports\n Other\n Nontax\n\n Fishing rights\n Fees and charges\n Investment income\n Other\n\n Grants\n\nOf which: current grants\n Compact\n Other\n\nTotal expenditure\n\n Current expenditure\n\n Wages and salaries\n Goods and services\n Interest payments\nSubsidies to public enterprises\n Other subsidies and transfers\n RIF paymenta\n Capital expenditure\n\nCurrent balance\nOverall balance\n\nFinancing\n\nNet government borrowing\n\nGross borrowing\nPrincipal repayment\n\nAsset sales\nUse of government financial\nassets\n\nRevenue and grants\n\n Revenue\n Grants\nExpenditure\n Current\n Capital\n\nCurrent balance\nOverall balance\n\nMemorandum items:\n\nGovernment fund balance\nUsable government financial\nassetsb\nOutstanding government debt\nStock of arrears\n\n77.7\n34.9\n19.5\n9.3\n3.1\n6.3\n0.9\n15.4\n2.2\n2.0\n6.2\n5.1\n42.8\n19.4\n36.4\n6.4\n\n109.8\n66.8\n21.9\n18.0\n7.5\n6.0\n3.7\n0.0\n43.0\n\n-12.4\n-32.1\n\n-12.2\n4.1\n16.2\n0.0\n44.3\n\n33.2\n40.7\n104.4\n63.5\n40.9\n-11.8\n-30.5\n\n30.0\n18.2\n\n127.7\n1.6\n\n78.1\n36.0\n19.4\n8.5\n3.9\n5.7\n1.3\n16.6\n1.6\n2.8\n1.1\n11.2\n42.1\n14.1\n34.6\n7.5\n\n60.1\n53.8\n21.4\n17.5\n7.5\n2.6-\n4.7\n0.0\n6.4\n\n-3.7\n17.9\n\n-12.4\n4.1\n16.5\n0.0\n-5.6\n\n80.5\n37.1\n43.4\n62.0\n55.4\n6.6\n-3.8\n18.5\n\n41.5\n9.9\n\n115.3\n1.4\n\na Early retirement and separation program (reduction in force) financed by an ADB loan.\nb Cash and cash equivalents that are not reserved for specific uses.\nSource: Ministry of Finance, RMI, and IMF.\n\n\f11\n\nD. \n\nGovernment Expenditure\n\n1. \n\nThe Short-Term Budgetary Crunch\n\nThe  long-term  development  debacle  in  the  country  has  been  compounded  by  a  short-\n37.\nterm  budgetary  crunch,  which  threatens  to  disrupt  the  normal  operations  of  the  government.\n\u201cUsable government financial assets\u201d in Table 3 which show cash and cash equivalents that are\nnot reserved for specific uses, declined from $12.4 million in FY1998 to virtually zero at the end\nof FY2000. As a result, the government is encountering serious difficulties in meeting its payroll,\nreplenishing  needed  supplies  (hospitals  have  no  supply  of  basic  medicine  for  the  last  three\nmonths) and funding education expenses. The Government is considering suspension of copra\nbuying as there is no money to pay subsidies or even process copra for inventory. This will spell\ndisaster  for  the  outer  island  economies,  which  depend  largely  on  copra  income.  A  significant\nincrease in poverty and hardship is likely.\n\n38.\nIt is important to note that the \u201coverall balance\u201d in Table 3 is not a good indicator of the\nresource  position  of  the  country.  For  example,  for  FY2000  the  estimated  surplus  in  overall\nbalance  of  $5.3  million  is  more  than  fully  offset  by  net  outflow  on  debt  of  $11.6  million.  The\ndeficit  of  $6.3  million  had  to  be  covered  by  sale  of  assets  and,  more  importantly,  by  drawing\ndown on financial balances resulting in near exhaustion of transaction balances.\n\n2. \n\nCauses of the Budgetary Crunch\n\n39.\nThis  sudden  depletion  of  government  financial  balances  is  due  to  some  unanticipated\nexternal  shocks  and  not  to  Government  profligacy.  The  main  factors  contributing  to  the\nbudgetary crunch are noted below.\n\na. \n\nCuts in Import Duty\n\n 40.\nPrior to the national elections in early 1999, the previous Government reduced the basic\nimport duty rate from 12 percent to 5 percent of import values. It put RMI import duties below\nthe regional levels. Due to the less than fully competitive situation among importers, the benefits\nof the duty cuts were not fully passed on to consumers. It did not bring about quantitative growth\nin imports. The Government lost revenues to the tune of $3 million during FY2000 and about $1\nmillion in the first four months of FY2001.\n\nb. \n\nHealth Costs\n\n41.\nOver the years, the cost of referrals in health services was paid to US companies on the\nbasis  of  360  days  payment  period.  Starting  in  2000,  there  was  a  change  in  the  method  of\npayments to these service providers and the payment period was reduced to 30 days. Since the\nRMI  relies  heavily  on  service  providers  in  the  US,  this  change  resulted  in  large  additional\npayments  by  the  Government  in  FY2000  and  FY2001.  As  shown  in  Table  4,  the  Government\nhad to pay an additional $2.7 million in subsidies to the health fund; even then the fund had a\ndeficit  of  $1.1  million  in  FY2000.  For  FY2001,  unless  the  Government  provides  additional\nsubsidy, the deficits of the fund will amount to $3.65 million.\n\n42.\nThe poor management of the medical referral system has led to an accumulated claim\non the Government\u2019s general fund by Marshall Islands Social Security Administration (MISSA)\nof about $3.7 million for deferred payments. This is the result of poor coordination between the\nMinistry  of  Health  and  Environment,  which  approves  referrals,  and  MISSA,  which  acts  as  the\n\n\f12\n\npaying  agent.  This  burden  of  deferred  payments  continues  without  the  necessary  revenues  to\ncover  costs.  This  was  compounded  by  the  recent  reduction  of  employers\u2019  and  employees\u2019\nhealth  fund  contributions  from  3.5  percent  to  2.5  percent.  The  situation  is  aggravated  by  the\ninadequate  on-island  health  care  that  necessitates  sending  people  overseas  even  for  minor\nmedical  problems.  The  rate  at  which  this  liability  grows  is  increasing  and  jeopardizes  the\nGovernment\u2019s already desperate fiscal position and the delivery of health services.\n\nTable 4: Basic Health Fund\n($ million)\n\nFY1997\n\nFY1998\n\nFY1999\n\nFY2000\n\nItem\n\nA.

The sale was made and AMI received the payment of\n$5  million.  However,  the  management  of  AMI  claimed  that  it  was  short  of  funds  for  urgent\nmaintenance  work  and  returned  only  $1.75  million  to  the  Government\u2019s  budget.  The  issue  is\nunder  consideration  by  the  board  of  AMI.  In  the  meantime,  the  Government  is  faced  with  a\nliquidity problem.\n\nd. \n\nCopra Subsidy\n\n44.\nThe  government-owned  copra  processing  authority  is  heavily  subsidized  through  the\ngovernment\u2019s budget. Copra is bought at an artificially high price with the Government meeting\nthe difference between commercial price and the supported price. This subsidy is used to inject\ncash  into  the  mainly  subsistence  outer-island  economies.  The  action  of  the  previous\nGovernment to raise the buying price to 15 cents/lb (6.8 cents/kg) prior to the 1999 election was\nseen as politically motivated. The increase in price had little impact on the Government\u2019s fiscal\nposition  at  that  time  because  of  the  lack  of  inter-island  shipping  services.  With  recent\nimprovements  in  shipping  services,  the  impact  on  the  Government\u2019s  budget  has  been  severe.\nEven  though  the  price  has  been  cut  from  15  cents/lb  to  9  cents/lb  (4.1  cents/kg),  the  total\nsubsidy  in  FY2001  is  expected  to  reach  $2.0  million,  more  than  double  what  was  originally\nbudgeted.\n\nE. \n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy\n\nThe Government has been requesting financial assistance from ADB since August 2000\n45.\nand  also  trying  to  raise  funds  from  commercial  sources,  with  little  success.  In  the  absence  of\nhelp  from  commercial  sources,  the  Government  has  been  forced  to  borrow  from  Marshall\n\n\f13\n\nIslands  Development  Bank  (MIDB)  and  to  dip  into  funds  set  aside  for  specific  purposes.  The\nGovernment  wants  to  repay  MIDB  and  correct  these  irregularities  by  using  the  funds  made\navailable from its program loan. The Government also proposes to start a process of long term\npolicy  reforms  that  can  reverse  the  current  downward  trend  in  income  and  employment\ngeneration in the country and initiate a process of sustainable and self-reliant development over\nthe long-term. Such fundamental changes will need a sustained long-term effort. Support of the\nGovernment  at  this  hour  of  need  is  appropriate  and  will  enable  the  RMI  to  undertake  major\nreforms that had been difficult in the past.\n\nF. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Public Sector\n\n1. \n\nAsian Development Bank\n\n46.\nADB  has  provided  nine  loans  totaling  $59.1  million  since  the  RMI  joined  ADB  in  April\n1990.  The  Ebeye  Health  and  Infrastructure  Project  is  being  implemented  while  the  Skills\nTraining  and  Vocational  Education  Project  just  started.  Both  projects  include  significant\nelements  of  sector  reforms  as  well  as  national  capacity  building.  TA  grants  totaling  $14.53\nmillion  for  37  TA  projects  have  been  provided  as  of  March  2001;  29  projects  have  been\ncompleted.\n\n2. \n\nInternational Monetary Fund/United Nations Development Programme\n\n47.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) carries out its annual Article IV consultations and\nhas  provided  TA  in  the  past  for  studies  leading  to  recommendations  on  improvements  of  the\nfiscal and taxation issues. The IMF is a full and active member of the Consultative Group for the\nRMI, and is in full support of the proposed Fiscal and Financial Management Program (FFMP)\nloan.  UNDP  support  has  been  concentrated  on  public  sector  management  improvement,\ntraining, and small enterprise development.\n\n48.\nSince  the  Compact  became  effective  in  1986,  the  RMI  has  received  considerable\neconomic and technical assistance from the US, supplemented by federal grants and additional\nappropriations by the US Congress. As noted in paras. 3-5, the US is the dominant source of\nassistance to the RMI.\n\n3. \n\nUnited States\n\n4. \n\nOthers\n\n49.\nJapan\u2019s  assistance  primarily  for  infrastructure  amounts  to  around  $2  million  annually.\nRecently,  Japan  rehabilitated  all  roads  in  Majuro.  Japan  is  also  providing  funding  for  schools\nand hospitals. In 2000, Taipei,China, provided about $12 million in project funding including $3\nmillion in budget support.\n\n5. \n\nCompact Negotiation: Status/Outcome\n\n50.\nThe  Compact  renegotiation  is  expected  to  begin  in  May  2001  after  the  RMI  has\npresented its forward-looking strategy and confirmed the economic reform and policy direction it\nintends to take. The economic policy and reform action will be underpinned by the policy matrix\nand conditionalities under the proposed program loan. The renegotiation may take place in 18-\n24 months but must reach some conclusion by October 2003. Under the current Compact, there\nare  provisions  for  a  two-year  transition  period  after  expiration  pending  renegotiation.  The\n\n\f14\n\nGovernment  will  invoke  the  two-year  transitory  provision  during  which  the  level  of  Compact\nfunding will be at the average of the past 15 years. This will mean that over the next two years\nthe RMI will receive an amount estimated at $3 million-4 million higher than the current level of\nCompact support.\n\n51. While  it  is  not  prudent  to  speculate  on  the  outcome  of  the  negotiations,  a  few  clear\nsignals  from  the  US  side  indicate  that:  (i)  in  all  likelihood  this  will  be  the  last  time  economic\nprovisions of the Compact will be negotiated; (ii) use of Compact funds will be restricted, tied to\nspecific  sectors  (mostly  social)  and  largely  project  specific;  (iii)  for  the  first  time  there  will  be\nconditionalities  similar  to  those  of  ADB  in  the  use  and  disbursement  of  funds;  (iv) the  US  is\nlooking  for  an  \u201cexit  strategy\u201d  and  finds  the  ADB  initiated  trust  fund  concept  acceptable  in\nprinciple and a viable way for the RMI to attain self-reliance; (v) overall Compact funding is likely\nto decline, but the US remains concerned about continued economic stability and would like to\navoid  shocks  or  a  sharp  decline  in  per  capita  GDP;  (vi)  funding  decline  will  be  partly\ncompensated  by  separate  allocation  for  placement  into  the  trust  fund;  and  (vii)  the  level  of\nCompact  funding  and  extent  of  \u201cnonearmarked  funding\u201d  (which  allows  the  RMI  flexibility  to\nprioritize its own macroeconomic needs) will depend on the Government\u2019s strategy and extent\nof reforms undertaken, especially in improving public sector financial management.\n\n52.\nThe US side believes that, without proper systems and accountability in public financial\nmanagement, the development and economic growth objectives of Compact funds will again not\nbe  met  and  that  funds  will  not  reach  the  sectors  or  those  who  need  them  the  most.  Compact\nnegotiations have been in close consultation with ADB and ADB has been requested to take the\nlead during the two-year transitory period. In summary, the Compact will most likely be renewed\nfor  another  15  years  at  probably  10-20  percent  lower  than  the  current  level;  there  will  be\nconditionalities and less \u201cnonearmarked\u201d funding and trust funds will be an integral part of the\nCompact  negotiation.  Other  provisions  such  as  immigration,  and  access  to  federal  grant  and\nprograms will continue as part of the security relations between the two countries.\n\nG. \n\nADB\u2019s Operations and Strategies in the Sector\n\nOn  30  January  1997,  ADB  approved  Loan  1513-RMI(SF):  Public  Sector  Reform\n 53.\nProgram  (PSRP).  The  main  objectives  were  to  (i)  stabilize  the  Government\u2018s  finances  in  the\nshort  term  through  a  combination  of  revenue  increase  and  expenditure  reduction  measures,\n(ii) ensure  the  long-term  structural  stability  of  Government  finances  and  sustainable  efficiency\ngains, and (iii) improve the environment for private sector activities. The counterpart funds were\nto  (i)  compensate  employees  retrenched  from  the  civil  service,  (ii)  liquidate  the  high-interest\ndebt of AMI, and (iii) establish the Financial Reserve Trust Fund.3\n\n54.\n\nImportant achievements made under the PSRP include the following:\n\n(i) \n\nreducing by 36 percent the Government payroll from 2,303 in November 1995 to\nunder 1,500 employees in June 2000;\n\n(ii) \n\nreducing ministries in the public service from 10 to 9;\n\n(iii) \n\nfreezing civil service wages from March 1996;\n\n(iv) \n\neliminating direct subsidies to AMI and reducing its most debilitating commercial\n\n3 Currently, Marshall Islands Intergenerational Trust Fund (MIITF).\n\n                  \n\n\f(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n15\n\ndebt with improved management;\n\nstreamlining the company registration process by removing the approval process\nfrom the Cabinet and vesting it in a Registrar of Corporations;\n\nstreamlining approval of licenses for foreign investment, removing the task from\nthe Cabinet and vesting it in a Registrar of Foreign Corporations under the new\nForeign Investment Business Legislation;\n\n(vii) \n\nestablishing the Marshall Islands Intergenerational Trust Fund (MIITF) to provide\nan additional source of revenue for the Government\u2019s budget;\n\n(viii) \n\nproviding  a  social  safety  net  for  retrenched  Government  employees  through  a\ncompensation  package  comprising  a  lump  sum  and  monthly  maintenance\npayments; and\n\n(ix) \n\nprivatizing domestic shipping services (which although experiencing problems, is\na policy the government is keen to pursue).\n\n55.\n\nSeveral problems were also identified in implementing the PSRP.\n\nConsultation  with  the  community  about  the  need  or  shape  of  the  PSRP  was\nadequate. The Program was initiated by then President Amata Kabua. After his\ndeath,  no  \u201cchampions\u201d  of  reform  rose  within  the  administration,  generating  the\nperception that outsiders were imposing the reforms.\n\nReducing  subsidies  to  Government  enterprises  produced  mixed  results.  Direct\nsubsidies to AMI were eliminated, but indirect subsidies continued by condoning\ndebts. After initially falling, subsidies to Tobolar Copra Processing Plant Ltd., the\ncopra  processing  authority,  have  returned  to  prereform  program  levels.  On  the\nplus  side,  the  Majuro  Electricity  Corporation  has  not  received  an  operational\nsubsidy for a number of years.\n\nThe  reform  program  achieved  its  aim  of  stabilizing  government  finances  in  the\nshort  run.  The  structural  problems  remain.  The  institutional  mechanisms  to\nensure rational and well-informed decisions do not exist. Lack of budgeting and\nfinancial  management  skills  in  the  civil  service  compounds  the  institutional\nweakness of the Ministry of Finance (MOF).\n\n56.\n\nThe most important lessons learned from this process were as follows.\n\nIn  designing  reforms,  the  time  for  implementing  them  and  their  political\nimplications must be estimated realistically.\n\nInstitutional  mechanisms,  particularly  for  financial  management,  need  to  be\nstressed in the process as specific fiscal and economic policy measures can be\noverturned if the institutional mechanisms to consolidate these policies are not in\nplace.\n\n(iii)  Without  effective  financial  management  and  control  systems  in  the  dominant\n\npublic sector, limited success can be achieved.\n\n\f16\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nCivil  service  downsizing  needs  to  be  complemented  by  specific  measures  to\nincrease the efficiency of the remaining civil service staff.\n\nReform  measures  need  to  be  fully  discussed  beforehand  to  instill  both\nunderstanding and a sense of ownership before they are implemented.\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nV. \n\nTHE PROGRAM\n\n57.\nIn  January  2000  a  new  reform-minded  Government  was  elected  in  the  RMI  with  H.E.\nKessai  Note  as  President.  The  new  Government  inherited  a  difficult  fiscal  position  with  rising\nexpenditures and stagnant revenues. Increased spending and tax reductions shortly before the\nNovember  1999  elections  were  compounded  by  optimistic  revenue  forecasts  and  led  to  a\nsubstantial  current  account  deficit  of  $5.9  million  in  FY1999.  The  full  impact  of  these  changes\nwas felt in FY2000, the election year, and resulted in a $11.8 million deficit.\n\n58.\nThe  Government  recognizes  that  many  current  problems  are  linked  to  deficiencies  in\npublic  financial  management.  Public  financial  management  has  suffered  from  years  of  neglect\nand is in need of major reform to improve budgeting, monitoring of, and accountability for public\nfunds.  Fiscal  policy  is  further  constrained  by  an  absence  of  reserves  and  a  narrow  revenue\nbase.  Long-term  revenue  prospects  remain  heavily  reliant  on  continued  prospects  for\nrenegotiations  of  economic  assistance  provisions  under  the  Compact.  Future  reforms  should\nfocus on raising public service productivity levels, while keeping a lid on the numbers of staff in\nthe  service.  The  Government  recognizes  that  there  is  a  window  of  opportunity  to  lock  in\nimportant  reforms  over  the  next  year  or  two  and  build  a  sustainable  future  by  prudent  use  of\nfinancial resources.\n\nThe  proposed  assistance  comes  at  an  opportune  time  in  that  it  coincides  with  the\n59.\nnegotiations  of  the  economic  provisions  of  the  Compact  with  the  US.  Establishing  improved\nfinancial  and  economic  management  systems  now  will  underpin  the  use  of  future  assistance\nand  set  a  platform  for  sustainable  fiscal  policy.  The  establishment  of  the  MIITF  is  the\ncornerstone  of  the  reforms,  modified  from  the  successful  models  developed  elsewhere  in  the\nregion. However, stable fiscal policy and strong financial management are needed to make this\nmodel successful.\n\nThe  Government  is  moving  to  address  these  problems  by  seeking  to  improve  its\n60.\nfinancial  management,  broadening  its  tax  base  and  strengthening  the  MIITF,  which  will\neventually  replace  Compact  revenues  in  the  long  term.  Complementing  these  moves,  ADB  is\nassisting  the  administration  in  preparing  the  Meto2000  economic  report  and  development\nstrategy.  The  Meto2000  resulted  from  wide  consultation  with  the  community  to  determine\nappropriate  development  policies  so  as  to  assist  the  Government\u2019s  negotiations  with  the  US\nover the renewal of the economic provisions of the Compact. The Government has conducted a\nNational  Economic  and  Social  Summit  to  seek  the  views  of  the  community  on  future\ndevelopment prospects and policies to which Meto2000 will be a major input.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nThe Government and ADB recognize the opportunity presented by the renegotiation of\n61.\nthe Compact in ensuring long-term economic sustainability of the RMI by ensuring prudent use\nof  future  Compact  assistance.  The  proposed  ADB  assistance,  while  stabilizing  the  immediate\n\n\f17\n\nfiscal situation, aims primarily at longer term issues of improving overall financial management\nin  the  RMI.  The  specific  objectives  of  the  financial  assistance  are  to  (i)  ensure  a  sustainable\nincome  flow  for  future  generations,  (ii)  strengthen  public  sector  financial  and  economic\nmanagement,  (iii)  stabilize  the  fiscal  position,  (iv)  enhance  the  policy  environment  for  private\nsector development to maximize the benefits from future Compact assistance, and (v) increase\nthe effectiveness of the public service.\n\n62.\nThe  time-bound  policies  to  be  implemented  under  the  Program  are  described  in  the\npolicy  matrix  in  Appendix  2.  The  Government  has  confirmed  the  general  direction  of  the\nProgram in a development policy letter attached as Appendix 1.\n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\n1. \n\nEnsure a Sustainable Income Flow for Future Generations\n\n63.\nSmall  Pacific  island  states  such  as  the  RMI  have  limited  ability  to  maintain  steady\nrevenue  streams  indefinitely  so  as  to  fund  all  the  services  normally  demanded  in  an  island\nnation.  A  trust  fund  established  in  a  number  of  island  states  has  been  a  successful  model  to\nensure the sustainability of Government finances. The view is that a trust fund can be built up\nover  time  through  external  contributions  or  windfall  gains,  with  the  real  earnings  of  the  fund\nbeing available to finance structural budget deficits. The key to sustainability of these funds is\nensuring  that  their  capital  is  maintained  in  real  value.  Both  Kiribati  and  Tuvalu,  two  countries\nsimilar  to  the  RMI  in  many  ways,  have  successfully  adopted  such  a  model.  They  have  large\ntrust  funds  established  and  invested  with  professional  fund  managers  with  strong  governance\nstructures  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  the  funds.  The  funds  have  established  a  platform  for  both\ncountries\u2019 long-term development.\n\n64.\nSeeing  the  success  of  these  countries,  the  RMI  established  the  MIITF  through\nlegislation.  The    Government  has  expressed  its  desire  to  build  up  balances  in  the  MIITF  by\nusing  proceeds  from  the  renegotiation  of  the  economic  provisions  of  the  Compact.  To  do  this\nthe  Government  intends  to  develop  more  stringent  operational  guidelines  to  revise  the  MIITF\nlegislation  to  more  strongly  protect  the  capital  of  the  fund  and  strengthen  its  governance\nprocedures. Specifically, the implementing guidelines and regulation related to MIITF legislation\nwill ensure that:\n\nthe capital of the MIITF is maintained in real terms;\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nan  independent  Advisory  Committee  will  be  appointed  to  provide  independent\nreports  to  the  Board  of  Directors  of  MIITF  on  fiscal  policy,  economic  and  social\nconditions within the Marshall Islands, and management issues of the MIITF;\n\n(iii) \n\nthe Advisory Committee reports will be made available to the Nitijela;\n\n(iv) \n\nthe  Board  of  Directors  will  appoint  on  a  competitive  bidding  process  a\nprofessional  investment  consultant  to  report  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  the\nperformance of the fund managers;\n\n(v) \n\nthe Board of Directors or the professional investment consultant will appoint one\nor more reputable international fund managers to manage the MIITF;\n\n(vi) \n\nannual  audited  accounts  for  the  MIITF  by  an  independent  auditor  will  be\n\n\f18\n\npublished within 6 months of the end of the MIITF\u2019s financial year; and\n\n(vii) \n\nan annual report prepared by the Board of Directors, including the audited annual\naccounts, will be made available to the Nitijela.\n\n65.\nIn addition, the Government will set aside the vast majority of the funds available from\nthe  Compact  with  the  long-term  goal  of  building  the  MIITF  to  a  level  where  its  returns  will\nultimately  replace  Compact  assistance.  Strengthening  the  MIITF  and  its  continued  funding  by\nthe  Government  is  the  cornerstone  of  this  program  loan.  Based  on  some  conservative\nassumptions  about  investment  earnings,  a  fund  in  the  region  of  $500  million  dollars  (in  2000\nprices)  will  be  needed  to  replace  a  significant  part  of  the  Compact  assistance  and  maintain\nstandards of living in the RMI.\n\nThe Government will guarantee that in operating the MIITF, the following conditions will\n\n66.\napply.\n\n(i) \n\nThe amounts indicated below will be deposited in the MIITF:\n\n(a) \n\nthe whole of any incremental gain from the Compact receipts as well as\n70  percent  in  the  first  year  and  60  percent  in  the  second  year  of  the\nnonearmarked  grant  portion  of  the  economic  provisions  of  the  Compact\navailable during the two-year extension period after 2001;\n\n(b) \n\n50  percent  of  the  nonearmarked  grant  portion  of  receipts  under  future\nCompact provisions after 2003; and\n\n(c) \n\nthe whole of any additional Compact payments for MIITF.\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  capital  of  the  MIITF  is  not  available  for  expenditure  by  the  Government  or\nany other person.\n\nthe  capital  of  the  MIITF  may  not  be  used  as  collateral  for  Government\nborrowings;\n\nThe first use of the income of the MIITF will be reinvestment to maintain the real\nvalue of the MIITF\u2019s capital.\n\nAfter  the  MIITF  reaches  a  target  figure  of  $0.5  billion  (in  2000  prices),  the\nbalance  of  MIITF\u2019s  annual  income\u2014after  maintenance  of  real  capital  value  and\nmeeting  the  management  costs\u2014will  be  available  to  the  Government  for  the\nNitijela to appropriate for expenditure through the annual budget process.\n\n2. \n\nStrengthen Public Sector Financial and Economic Management\n\nThe fiscal problems experienced in the RMI can be directly linked to deficiencies in the\n67.\nsystems  of  budgeting  and  financial  management  that  were  unable  to  handle  the  huge  grants\nforthcoming from the Compact. The budget format provides little information for scrutiny of the\ngovernment\u2019s  expenditure  patterns,  which  limits  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  make  informed\ndecisions  about  funding  priorities  and  the  public\u2019s  ability  to  question  these  spending  priorities.\nThe budget is prepared with only the most basic of projections on revenues, expenditures, and\ninformation  on  past  expenditure  trends.  In  this  environment,  fiscal  policy  decisions  often  enter\n\n\f19\n\nthe realm of guesswork and are subject to arbitrary decision making, often to the advantage of\nvested interests.\na. \n\nImproving Financial Management\n\nA  top  priority  is  to  reform  and  strengthen  public  financial  management.  This  involves\n68.\nimproving  the  annual  budget  format  to  conform  to  internationally  accepted  practices,  financial\ncontrol  mechanism,  accounting  system,  and  the  reporting  system;  and  developing  a  medium-\nterm framework for planning and performance evaluation. The overarching objectives of these\ninput/output\nreforms  will  be \nrelationships,  and  cost  effectiveness  of  public  sector    financial  management.    A  summary  of\nthese changes are given in Appendix 3. A detailed time-bound action plan clearly indicating the\nspecific steps to achieve the objectives  will be prepared jointly by ADB-funded consultants and\nthe PFTAC team. In preparing the time schedule for action, due consideration will be given to\navailable institutional capacity  to implement these reforms.\n\ntransparency,  accountability,  establishment  of \n\nto  ensure \n\n69.\nImproving  fiscal  and  financial  management  of  the  public  sector  is  a  critical  outcome  of\nthe  program.  Therefore,  adequate  resources  for  advisory  services  have  been  provided  under\nthe  loan  and  supported  by  the  piggybacked  TA.  The  new  budget  preparation  procedures  and\nsystems will be undertaken under the guidance and with the support of the budget advisor from\nPFTAC who has been involved in the preparatory stage of this project.\n\n70.\nTo  complement  these  actions,  the  Secretary  of  Finance  will  issue  financial  instructions\nand  regulations  under  the  Financial  Management  Act  to  govern  accounting  procedures,\ncompetitive tendering, and any procedures needed to safeguard public finances. The Financial\nManagement Act will be reviewed to ensure that the act and related legislation continue to meet\nthe needs of the Government. The incorporation of the desired reforms in legislation will reduce\nthe risk of reversal by future administrations.\n\nb. \n\nImproving Corporate Governance\n\n71.\nThe  financial  relationships  between  the  Government  and  its  public  sector  enterprises\n(PSEs)  have  in  the  past  contributed  to  the  poor  economic  performance  of  the  RMI.  Placing\nthese  relationships  on  a  solid  and  sustainable  basis  is  an  important  factor  in  managing  the\nGovernment\u2019s  financial  situation.  This  was  demonstrated  by  the  problems  experienced  as  a\nresult of losses experienced by AMI in the 1990s which directly impacted on the Government\u2019s\nbudget.  The  current  problems  in  MISSA  are  another  example.  It  is  important  to  make  these\nfinancial  relationships  as  transparent  as  possible  to  avoid  financial  problems  and  also  to\nexamine whether the relationship is appropriate or whether other models can be used.\n\n72.\nTo  overcome  existing  and  potential  problems,  the  Government  is  committed  to\ncompletely  review  the  corporate  governance  of  its  PSEs.  An  important  part  of  this  review  will\nassess  where  PSEs  merit  subsidies,  recommend  how  corporate  governance  can  improve  the\noutcomes  delivered  by  these  institutions,  and  also  identify  measures  to  strengthen  financial\nplanning, management, and reporting for improved delivery. The review will recommend a plan\nand timetable of reductions in subsidies to minimize the impact on the Government\u2019s finances.\n\nc. \n\nThe  Economic  Policy,  Planning  and  Statistics  Office,  and  the\nNational Policy Coordinating Committee\n\n73.\nDuring  Cabinet  deliberations,  ministers  often  do  not  benefit  from  analysis  of  the\neconomic impact of proposals, especially the impact on the Government\u2019s budgetary situation.\n\n\f20\n\nThe  Office  of  Planning  and  Statistics  (OPS)  has  this  role  spelled  out  in  the  legislation  that\nestablished it. In reality, however, OPS has not been able to fulfil its mandate due to factors of\nlocation, capacity, its statistical focus, and lack of demand for its services as a policy advisory\nbody.\n\n74.\nTo overcome this deficiency, the Government intends to establish the Economic Policy,\nPlanning and Statistics Office (EPPSO). In creating EPPSO, the Government wishes to draw on\nexisting resources, such as those in OPS, MOF, and other policy offices within the Government,\nrather than set up a new and separate institution. Using existing resources will help ensure the\nstaffing and institutionalization of EPPSO. Short-term TA from ADB and other sources could be\na supplement, especially when EPPSO needs to benefit from specialist inputs.\n\nEPPSO  will  act  as  the  secretariat  for  a  newly  established  National  Policy  Coordinating\n75.\nCommittee (NPCC) with membership drawn from the senior levels of the civil service but also\nbenefiting  from  the  Chairmanship  and  representation  drawn  from  the  Cabinet.  The  NPCC  will\nevaluate policy proposals going to the Cabinet, with analysis provided by EPPSO. The NPCC\nwill  consider  issues  from  formulating  the  budget  to  policy  and  project  requests  coming  from\nministries.  To  avoid  duplication  of  effort,  the  NPCC  will  assume  the  responsibility  of  existing\ncommittees such as the Budget Coordinating Committee and the Loans Committee. To ensure\nthe  effectiveness  of  EPPSO  and  the  NPCC,  EPPSO  will  be  responsible  to  the  Office  of  the\nPresident  and  will  be  located  within  the  Cabinet  Office.  Appendix  4  gives  more  details  of  the\noperation and structure of the EPPSO and NPCC.\n\n3. \n\nStabilize the Fiscal Position\n\n76.\nThe  difficult  financial  position  is  threatening  basic  government.  Immediate  action  is\nneeded  to  stabilize  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  position  and  this  involves  improving  revenue\ncollection and containing expenditures.\n\n77.\nOn  the  revenue  side,  the  Government\u2019s  main  sources  of  funds  are  foreign  grants.\nHowever,  most  of  these  funds  are  earmarked  for  specific  purposes.  Discretionary  revenue  is\ndrawn from a narrow base, which needs to be broadened. In recent times, the tax regime has\nbeen the subject of several reform proposals. However, changes in the tax regime are strongly\nopposed  by  various  sections  of  the  community.  Much  of  this  opposition  stems  from  the\ngovernment\u2019s limited enforcement capacity. Lack of enforcement means that many businesses\nare avoiding paying their share of tax and that leads to justifiable resistance to tax increases as\nthese will unfairly penalize the existing taxpayers.\n\n78.\nThe  Government  proposes  to  strengthen  the  tax  collection  division  with  more  trained\nstaff  (including  the  use  of  private  agencies)  to  collect  arrears,  check  evasion,  and  to  properly\nenforce  existing  laws.  While  improving  tax  collection,  the  Government  also  intends  to  review\nand possibly reverse the decision made to reduce the import duties from 12 percent to 5 percent\nin early 1999. It is proposed that this rate be increased to at least 8 percent by October 2001\nand  additional  reforms  be  made  based  on  a  detailed  review  of  the  national  and  local  tax\nregimes.\n\n79. While these are immediate actions, the Government is aware of other problems that will\ntake longer to overcome. The Government is aware of anomalies in parts of the tax system. For\nexample, by regional and international standards personal income tax is high for the lowest-paid\nwage  earners  and  low  for  the  middle  and  upper  income  brackets.  The  gross  revenue  tax  is\nsimple  in  concept  and  theoretically  easy  to  administer,  but  it  is  paid  on  gross  output  value  at\n\n\f21\n\neach stage in (produce/process chain sale), producing a cascading effect of tax being paid on\ntax. The gross revenue tax takes no account of enterprise profitability \u2013 as a good business tax\nshould \u2013 and is reportedly subject to widespread evasion and undercollection.\n\nThe  overall  tax  picture  is  further  fragmented  by  the  wide  taxing  powers  of  local\n80.\ngovernments. Anomalies are created by uncoordinated taxing actions at local level, potentially\nnegating the fiscal intentions of the national Government and compounding the problems of the\ntaxpayer. Statutory and administrative action is needed to integrate national and local taxation\ninto a single scheme that, for example, limits levels of local tax, allows offsets against national\ntax  liabilities,  and  is  simple  for  the  taxpayer  to  operate.  The  introduction  of  a  value-added  tax\nwas  proposed  as  part  of  an  earlier  comprehensive  review  of  taxation  in  1996.  The  idea  met\nresistance  from  the  commercial  sector,  and  the  overall  tax  reform  plan  was  abandoned  as\nnational elections approached.\n\n81.\nThe  Government  intends  to  correct  the  anomalies  in  the  tax  system,  especially  the\nregressive  nature  of  the  regime,  but  feels  that  it  is  not  ready  for  immediate  action.  With  help\nfrom  the  accompanying  TA  project,  the  Government  will  review  the  tax  system  to  look  at\nanomalies  and  make  recommendations  leading  to  improved  efficiency  and  fairness  of  the\nregime while broadening and deepening the Government\u2019s tax base.\n\nOn  the  expenditure  side,  the  Government  is  working  to  control  various  components  of\n82.\nthe general fund budget. Although significant progress was made during the PSRP, pressure is\nnow  building  to  increase  public  sector  employment  and  expand  government  services.  To\ncontain expenditures, the Government will\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nmaintain the freeze on salaries of public servants, elected officials, and contract\nworkers  for  at  least  two  years  \u2013  FY2002  and  FY2003  \u2013  or  until  the  review  of\npublic service salaries is completed and implemented;\n\nenforce  a  cap  of  5  percent  on  general  fund  expenditure  growth  starting  from  a\nbaseline  amount  of  $29.5  million  for  FY2001,  excluding  certain  one-time\nexpenditures and payment of prior-year liabilities;\n\nincrease employee and employer contributions to the MISSA health fund back to\n3.5 percent by legislation;\n\nlimit  to  $4.0 million overseas referral costs for FY2002 on an accrual basis and\nfurther reduce it in FY2003 to match revenue from the Basic Health Care Fund,\nestimated at $2.8 million;\n\n(v) \n\nincrease funding for on-island health care in FY2002 to at least $2.8 million to be\nfunded entirely from the Health Care Revenue Facility;\n\n(vi) \n\ncap subsidy to health expenditures at $1.2 million per year in FY2002;\n\n(vii) \n\neliminate all subsidies by FY2003, excluding the copra subsidy; and\n\n(viii) \n\nreview \nmechanisms for income transfer to less advantaged outer islands.\n\nthe  copra  subsidy  and \n\nits  possible  replacement  with  alternative\n\n\f22\n\n4. \n\nEnhance the Policy Environment for the Private Sector\n\n83.\nRecent government reforms have improved the policy environment for the private sector.\nThe  new  administration  has  legislated  improvements  in  company  registration  and  foreign\ninvestment  procedures.  Despite  the  improvements,  significant  impediments  to  investment  and\nprivate sector development still need to be addressed.\n\n84.\nLand access is the most prominent of these impediments. The Government has drafted\nlegislation  that  will  establish  a  land  registration  authority  where  landowners  interested  in\nregistering their land for investment purposes can voluntarily register their land after the integrity\nof  the  title  is  verified.  An  added  advantage  of  the  system  is  that  leases  will  subsequently  be\nindependent of title in cases where inheritance of land is disputed. Such disputes will not affect\nalready existing leases. The review of the tax system (para. 81) is also aimed at strengthening\nthe incentives in the taxation regime.\n\n85.\nThe role of the MIDB will also be investigated to reorient its efforts to a more business\nadvisory  role:  from  direct  lending  to  assisting  businesses  to  access  credit  from  commercial\nbanks, since direct lending has been subject to significant political interference. Complementing\nthis change will be measures to ensure that appropriate microcredit schemes are established to\ngive  credit  access  to  small  businesses,  women,  youth,  and  other  sectors  of  the  community\nnormally  denied  access  to  credit.  Finally,  MIDB  will  renew  its  efforts  to  recover  as  much\nnonperforming debt as possible.\n\n5. \n\nIncrease the Effectiveness of the Public Service\n\n86.\nA large and inefficient public service has historically limited the ability of the Government\nto deliver services. The service has been seen as a way of distributing the wealth forthcoming\nfrom  the  Compact  rather  than  from  the  executive  arm  of  Government.  The  Constitution  of  the\nRMI even backs this perception. Recent reforms have managed to reduce the size of the public\nservice  to  manageable  levels  and  changed  perceptions  about  the  role  of  the  service.\nNevertheless,  there  is  still  strong  pressure  inside  and  outside  of  Government  to  increase\nrecruitment  to  solve  the  service  delivery  problems,  although  experience  indicates  additional\npersonnel will have little effect.\n\n87.\nReducing  the  civil  service  has  eliminated  many  underperforming  staff,  but  there  is  still\nmuch  inefficiency.  A  key  improvement  to  the  service  will  be  matching  the  staff  with  skills  to\nspecific jobs and retraining so that the Government can redeploy staff between areas of the civil\nservice rather than recruit new staff. Better qualifications in the professional areas will need to\nbe linked more closely to the Government\u2019s training and scholarship policy to ensure that skills\nshortages can be overcome. The review will look closely at salary and wage levels in the public\nservice. A key aspect of improving the public service is the need to pay wages commensurate\nwith  productivity  levels,  ample  anecdotal  evidence  suggests  that  wage  levels  far  exceed\nproductivity  levels.  High  wage  levels  in  the  public  service  also  make  it  difficult  for  the  private\nsector to attract and retain skilled staff.\n\nA  review  of  the  service  will  look  at  a  range  of  issues.  The  focus  of  the  reforms  will  be\n88.\nbetter  management  of  human \nretraining,\nappropriateness  of  pay  scales,  conditions  of  public  service,  and  appropriate  delegation  of\nauthority. Linkage will be established between financial and human resource inputs and outputs\n(delivery and service levels) for each ministry. Additional resources to carry out the program for\nimproving the effectiveness of the public sector will be sought from other donors such as the US\n\nredeployment  and \n\nresources, \n\nincluding \n\n\f23\n\nand Australia. Component for specialist inputs under the program loan may also be used.\n\n89.\nAs the government moves to contract out more services, the nature of the public service\nchanges  from  direct  service  delivery  to  contract  management.  To  provide  for  the  new  skills\nneeded to cope with this change, the government will conduct courses to train administrators in\nhow to manage and enforce contracts to ensure that the government gets best value for money.\nContracting-out  arrangements  in  the  Government  have  not  delivered  the  benefits  expected\nmainly due to the inability of the public service to enforce and regulate contracts, given that the\nrole  is  new  and  unfamiliar.  As  mentioned  in  para.  60,  the  government  will  improve  financial\nmanagement  and  budget  preparation  skills.  Where  the  government  is  still  in  the  business  of\ndirectly  providing  services  to  the  community,  the  relevant  staff  will  be  trained  in  all  aspects  of\ncustomer service. The Government will also investigate the possibility of establishing a cadre of\ncivil servants that will enter the service based on the results of competitive examinations.\n\nD. \n\nPoverty  and Governance Issues\n\n1. \n\nPoverty\n\nThere  are  aspects  of  the  loan  that  address  all  three  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction\n\n90.\nstrategy: pro-poor economic growth, equitable social development, and good governance.\n\n91.\nThe  serious  deterioration  in  the  Government  of  RMI\u2019s  fiscal  situation  has  led  to  a\ncompounding effect on the poor in the RMI. Measures in the loan are designed to address two\nissues  that  are  causing  some  hardship  among  the  poor.  The  first  is  the  Government\u2019s  current\ninability  to  buy  copra  due  to  fiscal  constraints.  This  is  causing  hardship  in  the  poorer  outer\nislands where copra sales are an important part of household cash incomes. Copra prices are\nsubsidized  by  the  Government,  and  Government  purchase  of  this  product  is  a  form  of\nredistributing income to the poor.\n\n92.\nSecond,  the  arrears  associated  with  poor  management  of  the  medical  referral  system\nhas led to large claims on the Government. Current outstanding claims estimated at $3.7 million\nhave  been  deferred.  The  effect  of  these  outstanding  claims  has  been  a  rundown  of  operating\nrevenue in the Ministry of Health, with a resulting decline in delivery of health services. Funds\nfrom  the  loan  will  ensure  that  payments  on  the  copra  and  health  referral  backlog  can  be\naddressed.  In  the  case  of  copra,  the  measures  will  be  pro-poor  and  underpin  growth\nopportunities in the outer island economies. The health measures will result in improved, more\nequitable access to services for poorer Marshallese in the medium term. The issues are further\ndiscussed in paras. 42 and 119.\n\n93.\nThere are measures in the loan to address the management of the public sector. Public\nsector  wages  have  been  much  higher  than  those  in  the  private  sector.  As  a  result,  a\ndisproportionate  share  of  Government  fiscal  resources  is  spent  on  wages,  while  operational\nexpenditure experience a shortfall. Redressing this imbalance will be an important aspect of the\nloan, and will result in long-term benefits to the wider Marshallese community. By ensuring more\nresources are available for long-term productive investment, these measures are likely to result\nin sustainable economic growth.\n\n94.\nIn addition to managing of the public sector, there are measures in the loan to address\nmanagement  of  the  financial  sector.  Medium-term  expenditure  planning  processes  will  be\nintroduced,  with  output-oriented  budgeting,  performance  measurements,  and  linkages  to  the\nmedium-term development plan. In addition, there will be financial control measures to ensure\n\n\f24\n\nthat expenditure decisions are made in an environment of transparency and accountability and\nthat  succeeding  administrations  will  find  such  decisions  difficult  to  reverse.  Recognizing  that\ntransparency,  accountability,  and  predictability  are  vital  aspects  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  good\ngovernance, these measures are expected to result in significant improvements to governance,\nand  as  such,  can  be  regarded  as  pro-poor  in  nature.  A  poverty  impact  assessment  is  in\nAppendix 5.\n\n2. \n\nGovernance\n\n95.\nGood  governance  is  the  cornerstone  of  any  economy.  In  its  absence,  an  economy  will\nnot  function  effectively  or  efficiently,  its  potential  for  growth  will  be  stifled,  and  equity  of\ndistribution  will  be  compromised.  The  people  that  suffer  most  will  be  the  poor  and\nunderprivileged who do not have the power or influence to capture a fair share of the nation\u2019s\nincome.\n\n96.\nSince independence, the RMI has had a history of poor governance. This culminated in\nthe prolifigate use of the funds provided by the US under the first Compact of Free Association.\nWhile  a  few  families  based  in  Majuro  managed  to  become  wealthy,  many  others,  particularly\nthose  on  some  of  the  outer  islands,  received  little  if  any  benefit.  The  problem  has  now  been\nrecognized  and  ADB,  among  others,  is  attempting  to  help  the  RMI  Government  to  address\npoverty issues in the outer islands. But for any project to succeed and for scarce resources to\nreach the poorest, fundamental changes in public sector financial management are required to\nimprove efficiency in the use of limited funding. Transparency, equitable distribution, and special\nconsideration for the needs of the poor are critical.\n\n97.\nOnce again, ADB is in a dilemma. While the situation calls for support, past experience\nhas  been  disappointing.  However,  there  are  real  grounds  for  hope  that  the  situation  has\nchanged.  If  the  needs  of  the  new  government  are  ignored,  the  reformers  will  in  effect  be\npenalized  for  the  actions  of  their  predecessors.  At  the  same  time,  a  lot  of  poor  people  will  be\ncondemned to increasing poverty with little hope of improvement.\n\nA. \n\nAmount of the Loans and Source of Funds\n\nVI. \n\nTHE PROPOSED LOANS\n\n98.\nThe  proposed  loans  total  $12.0  million  equivalent  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources\n(OCR) as well as special funds (SF) resources. The OCR loan amount will be $4,000,000 and\nthe  SF  loan  SDR  6,320,000  ($8.0  million  equivalent).  OCR  funding  has  been  provided  for\npurposes  that  are  likely  to  result  in  cost  savings  and/or  help  fiscal  balance.  SF  sources  have\nbeen  proposed  for  the  adjustment  costs  for  improving  social  indicators,  promoting  trust  funds,\nstrengthening  the  financial  management  system,  initiating  good  governance,  and  building\ncapacity as well as implementing the program.\n\n99.\nThe  Program  is  designed  to  achieve  long-term  sustainability  and  short-term  fiscal\nstability.  As  such,  the  size  of  the  loan  was  based  on  the  proposed  costs  of  adjustments  and\nreforms as follows.\n\n(i) \n\nThe allocation for MIITF supports the trust fund and provides additional impetus\nto the Government to use trust funds as an additional source of income and for\nlong-term  self-reliance.  The  MIITF  is  a  major  objective  of  the  Program  loan\n(estimated at $2.0 million).\n\n\f25\n\n(ii) \n\nPayment  of  health  arrears  not  only  relieves  pressure  on  the  Government\u2019s\nfinancial  situation,  it  also  addresses  an  urgent  social  need.  As  explained  in\nparagraph 41, the Government must clear arrears in overseas referral payments\nto be able to refer patients for secondary and tertiary care currently not available\non  the  island.  Several  critically  ill  patients  cannot  be  sent  abroad  as  the\nGovernment  has  been  unable  to  generate  adequate  resources  to  meet  the\nsudden requirement for health payments (estimated at $3.5 million).\n\n(iii)  With the adverse fiscal situation arising from the cutback in import duties and the\neconomic  downturn,  the  Government  has  been  obliged  to  secure  a  short-term\ncommercial facility at less than favorable terms and interest rates and temporarily\nuses  funds  mandated  for  other  uses.  By  retiring  the  high-cost  commercial  loan,\nthe  Government\u2019s  financial  situation  will  be  stabilized  over  the  next  2-3  years\n(estimated at $2.5 million).\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  fiscal  balance  support  will  be  provided  over  18  months  to  give  the\nGovernment  time  to  make  the  necessary  adjustments  in  its  revenues  and\nexpenditure.  The  fiscal  situation  is  likely  to  be  difficult  in  the  context  of  external\nshock  arising  from  the  economic  downturn  as  well  as  fuel  and  other  price\nincreases.  On  the  revenue  side,  the  Government  intends  to  increase  import\nduties  within  FY2001,  but  the  impact  will  be  realized  only  in  FY2002/2003\n(estimated at $1.5 million).\n\nCosts  for  improving  the  accounting  system  and  implementing  improved  tax\ncollection  and  enforcement  which  are  aimed  at  better  fiscal  management  and\nimprove  Government  ability  to  more  effectively  utilize  external  resources\n(estimated at $1.5 million).\n\nFinancing  of  specialist  inputs,  Compact  renegotiation  costs,  and  program\nimplementation  costs  directly  relate  to  furthering  the  objectives  of  the  program\nand ensuring that the reforms are achieved (estimated at $1.0 million).\n\n100. Given  the  structure  of  the  RMI  economy,  assessment  of  the  ability  to  pay  ADB\u2019s  loan\nfunded from the OCR was  based on the extent of net available nonearmarked funds from the\neconomic  provisions  under  the  Compact  agreement.  Currently  the  nonearmarked  portion  of\nCompact  funds  pays  the  RMI\u2019s  bond  obligations.  These  bond  obligations  will  be  fully  paid  by\nOctober  2001.  Nonearmarked  Compact  funds  will  then  be  available  to  the  RMI  to  meet\ndiscretionary expenditures. If the economic provisions are not renegotiated by the end of 2001,\na provision of the Compact allows for an automatic 2-year extension at a funding level that is the\naverage of the past 15 years. Consequently, it is likely that the RMI will receive a higher amount\nfor 2002 and 2003, pending renewal of the economic provisions of the Compact. Subsequently,\nwhen  the  affected  provisions  are  renegotiated  (most  probable  outcome),  a  certain  level  of\nnonearmarked  funds  are  expected  to  continue  to  be  available  to  the  RMI.  In  projecting  the\nextent of  nonearmarked funds, a 10-20 percent drop was estimated starting 2004 and followed\nby a 10 percent step-down every five years. Such estimate is merely for the sake of projections\nand  does  not  in  any  way  reflect  negotiating  positions  or  the  final  outcome  of  the  Compact\nrenegotiations. These estimates are premised on indications that discretionary funds under the\nCompact  are  likely  to  be  reduced  as  the  economic  provisions  are  made  project/program\nspecific.  It  is  also  assumed  that  the  Government  intends  to  set  aside  50-60  percent  of  the\nnonearmarked  funds  for  the  MIITF  for  purposes  of  achieving  long-term  self-reliance.  The\nprojected  loan  repayment  schedule  (Appendix  6)  shows  that  the  RMI  will  be  able  to  meet  its\n\n\f26\n\nOCR obligations based on the preceding assumptions.\n\n101. Considering the above, it is proposed that a $4.0 million loan be provided on OCR terms\nto  fund  components  that  are  expected  to  generate  direct  savings.  The  SF  loan  of  $8.0  million\nwill  be  primarily  utilized  for  meeting  implementation  costs  in  the  areas  relating  to  the  health\nsector;  capacity  building  for  improved  economic  management,  in  particular  for  improved\ngovernance  in  the  financial  and  fiscal  sectors;  and  for  creating  sustainable  development  to\nserve future generations. A logical framework for the Program is in Appendix 7.\n\nB. \n\nInterest, Maturity, and Implementation Period\n\n102.\nThe Borrower will be the RMI. The OCR loan will have a maturity of 15 years, including a\ngrace period of 3 years, with interest determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based variable\nlending rate system for US dollar loans, a front-end fee of 1.0 percent, and commitment charge\nof 0.75 percent per annum. The SF loan will have a repayment period of 24 years including a\ngrace period of 8 years and a 1 percent interest charge during the grace period, and 1.5 percent\nthereafter.  The  loans  are  expected  to  be  disbursed  over  36  months,  from  June  2001  to  May\n2004.\n\nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n103. MOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  loan  and  will  have  overall  responsibility  to\nimplement  the  Program.  A  program  steering  committee  (PSC)  chaired  by  the  Minister  of\nFinance  and  comprising  selected  Cabinet  members,  representative  of  the  Office  of  the\nPresident, and secretaries of key ministries will be established prior to loan effectiveness. The\nPSC  will  be  responsible  for  providing  high  level  policy  guidance.  MOF  will  be  supported  by  a\nProgram Coordination Unit (PCU) headed by a program coordinator. The PCU staff will include\nan accountant, supported by consultant inputs financed by the loan and TA grant. The PCU will\nprovide monthly reports on progress on the policy matrix and highlight any proposed changes\nand  actions  taken.  Reports  will  also  provide  an  assessment  of  whether  the  new  setup  and\narrangements such as EPPSO are working effectively.\n\nD. \n\nProcurement\n\n104.\nThe  proceeds  of  the  loans  will  be  disbursed  against  a  broad  range  of  imports  with  the\ncounterpart  funds  generated  to  be  used  to  support  the  costs  of  program  implementation  and\nrelated adjustment costs. The proceeds of the loans will only be used to finance items produced\nand  procured  in  ADB  member  countries  except  the  ineligible  items  specified  in  a  negative  list\n(Appendix  8).  The  Borrower  will  submit  with  each  withdrawal  request  a  certification  that  the\nvalue of total net eligible imports is expected to be equal or greater than the amount of the ADB\nprojected  disbursements  under  the  program  loan  in  a  given  period  and  that  the  required\nwithdrawal  will  be  used  to  finance  eligible  items  procured  in  accordance  with  the  loan\nagreement provisions. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify\nthe  accuracy  of  the  Borrower\u2019s  certification.  Procurement  using  loan  funds  will  be  based  on\nnormal  commercial  practice  by  the  private  sector,  except  that  goods  commonly  traded  on\ninternational  commodity  markets  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  procedures.  ADB  will\ncontinue to ensure that standard public and private sector procurement procedures used in the\nDMC concerned are adequate from the point of view of competition and efficiency.\n\n\fE. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n27\n\n105.\nThe Program will require about 30 person-months of international and about 36 person-\nmonths domestic consulting services. There will be specialists in (i) tax advisory consultancy, (ii)\npublic financial management, (iii) trust fund administration, (iv) program implementation, and (v)\nother specialization as agreed upon with ADB. The consultants will be selected and engaged in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.\n\nF. \n\nDisbursement\n\n106. MOF will ensure that funds released under each tranche are utilized for the purpose for\nwhich  they  are  designated  (Table  5).  ADB  project  administration  will  monitor  the  use  of  funds\nand  require  regular  disbursement  reports.  MOF  will  be  required  to  confirm  that  payments  for\nhealth  arrears,  repayment  of  MIDB  loan,  and  deposits  to  MIITF  (in  accordance  with  Table  5)\nhave been made against each tranche release.\n\nItem\n\n1.  Allocation to MIITF\n2.  Health Arrears\n3.  Retire High-Cost Debt\n4.  Fiscal Balance Support\n5.  Accounting System\n6.  Revenue Measures\n7.

Funds corresponding to these items must be placed in a separate account to\nensure  timely  availability.  Arrangements  will  be  made  between  MOF  and  ADB  project\nadministration for proper accounting and monitoring of expenditures from such accounts.\n\nG. \n\nCounterpart Funds\n\n108. Counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loans  will  be  utilized  to\nfinance the costs associated with implementing the Program and will be utilized as follows :\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nallocation to MIITF (estimated at $2.0 million SF);\nhealth  sector  payments  arising  from  change  in  credit  terms  of  health  service\nproviders and deferred past due obligations (estimated at $3.5 million SF);\nretirement  of  portions  of  high-cost  short-term  commercial  debt  incurred  to  meet\nfiscal deficit in FY2000 (estimated at $2.5 million OCR);\nfiscal balance support to meet additional expenditures and/or revenue shortfalls\nin FY2001 and FY2002 (estimated at $1.5 million OCR);\nadjustment  costs  associated  with  required  changes  in  the  financial  accounting\n\n\f28\n\nsystem to make it more responsive to proposed improvements in public financial\nmanagement  to  support  stronger  control,  accountability,  and  better  governance\n(estimated at $600,000 SF);\ncosts to improve tax collection and enforce tax and customs duties (estimated at\n$900,000 SF); and\nfinancing  specialist  inputs  to  improve  public  financial  management,  supervise\nestablishment and operation of a trust fund, support Compact renegotiation, and\nother needs to support program implementation (estimated at $1,000,000 SF).\n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nH. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching\n\n109. ADB will periodically review program implementation and will closely monitor its progress\nand  impact  on  the  performance  targets.  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  the\noutcome  of  policy  discussions  with  other  development  agencies  and  their  implications  for\nprogram implementation.\n\nIn  addition  to  quarterly  progress  reports,  the  Government  will  submit  a  program\n110.\ncompletion report to ADB within three months of the loan closing date. This report will evaluate\nthe implementation of the policy measures during the program period, and further reforms and\nassistance needed in the medium term.\n\n111.\nThe loans funds will be released in three tranches. The first \u2013 $4.3 million equivalent \u2013\nwill be made available after loan effectiveness and upon compliance with first-tranche conditions\n(Appendix 9). The second tranche \u2013 $5.4 million equivalent \u2013 will be disbursed upon compliance\nwith  second-tranche  conditions  approximately  9-12  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  The\nremaining  balance  \u2013  $2.3  million  equivalent  \u2013  will  be  released  after  fulfillment  of  third-tranche\nconditions.  Table  6  shows  the  distribution  of  OCR/SF  funds  to  be  released  against  each\ntranche.\n\nTable 6: Program Loans Tranche Releases\n($ million)\n\nItem\n\n1st Tranche\n\n2nd Tranche\n\n3rd Tranche\n\nTotal\n\nOrdinary Capital Resources\nLoan\n\nSpecial Funds Loan\n\nTotal\n\n2.0\n\n2.3\n\n4.3\n\n1.5\n\n3.9\n\n5.4\n\n0.5\n\n1.8\n\n2.3\n\n4.0\n\n8.0\n\n12.0\n\n112.\nThe tranche amounts are consistent with the extent of reforms undertaken. The bulk of\nthe  loans  will  be  disbursed  after  major  second-tranche  conditions  are  met.  A  third  tranche\nensures continued engagement and monitoring of reforms required under the policy matrix.\n\nVII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n\n113. Over the years, the capacity for economic management in the country has improved. A\ncadre  of  young  Marshallese  has  world-class  training  in  economic  and  business  management\nand older Marshallese have been getting on-the-job experience in economic management since\nindependence.  However,  the  development  program  currently  envisaged  by  the  Government\n\n\f29\n\nrequires high-level expertise, not all of which is currently available in the country. TA funding will\nbe  required  to  mobilize  that  expatriate  expertise.  The  Government  has  classified  the  required\ninputs  into  two  categories:  (i)  those  that  will  generate  revenues  for  the  government  over  the\nshort,  medium,  or  long  term;  and  (ii)  those  that  will  be  of  a  general  developmental  character.\nThe  Government  has  requested  that  the  activities  in  the  first  category  be  funded  from  the  SF\ncomponent of the Program loan and those in the second category by TA grants from ADB.\n\n114. ADB  will  provide  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB-funded  TA  program  a  TA  for  (i)  fiscal\nand  financial  advisory  services,  (ii)  economic  strategy  advice,  and  (iii)  building  capacity  for  a\nmore efficient public service. The TA will fund the services of economic and financial advisers\nand  support  the  PCU  with  consultant  inputs  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  policy  matrix,  and\nundertake benefit monitoring and effective program implementation. The second part of the TA\nwill  provide  economic  management  advisory  support  to  the  EPPSO  for  activities  mentioned  in\nthe  policy  matrix,  and  the  third  component  will  assist  the  Government  to  develop  in-house\ncompetencies and capacity for public sector management. TA closing date will be co-terminus\nwith loan closing in May 2004. TA details are in Appendix 10.\n\nVIII.  PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA. \n\nProgram Benefits\n\nThe  most  strategic  contribution  of  the  Program  will  be  over  the long  term.  Without  the\n115.\ntype of reforms envisaged under the Program, development performance over the next 15 years\nmay  not  differ  from  that  of  the  preceding  15  years,  namely,  increasing  unemployment  and\ncontinued  decline  in  per  capita  incomes.  It  also  means  that  at  the  end  of  the  next  Compact\nagreement, reduced foreign inflows will result in sharp economic decline in the RMI.\n\nreforms, \n\nthe  successful \n\nimplementation  of \n\n116. With \nthe  country\u2019s  developmental\nperformance  will  experience  a  turnaround.  With  the  MIITF  fund  of  about  $  0.5  billion  (in  2000\nprices) to be reached in 15 years, the country will have gained financial strength to sustain its\nperformance  even  if  Compact  funding  is  substantially  reduced.  If  the  program  objectives  are\nrealized, at the end of 15 years balances in the country\u2019s trust fund can generate in perpetuity a\nflow  of  annual  incomes  of  about  $25  million  (in  2000  prices).  With  better  management  of  its\nresources,  the  country  can  stop  the  decline  in  per  capita  incomes.  And  with  programs  for\nemployment  generation,  it  can  avoid  the  baseline  scenario  of  increasing  unemployment  and\npoverty.\n\n117.\nThe  primary  gain  in  the  medium  term  will  be  the  improved  budgetary  situation  and\ndevelopmental  effectiveness  of  the  public  sector.  Improvement  in  the  budgetary  situation  will\ncome primarily from two program components: (i) increased import duty and efficient collection\nof revenue in general, and (ii) cap on growth of current government expenditures. At the end of\nfour years, the current account deficit in the budget is expected to be substantially eliminated.\n\n118.\n The immediate short-term objective of the Program is to prevent a budgetary crisis. The\neconomic structure of the country depends heavily on the Government sector. As noted in para.\n37, the financial assets of the Government will be nearly exhausted if present trends continue.\nThe  Government  may  not  be  able  to  pay  wages  and  salaries  to  its  employees.  With  an\nextended  family  system,  a  typical  Government  worker  often  supports  more  than  eight  family\nmembers, some of whom do not have any other means of subsistence. The social disruption will\nhave  an  immediate  adverse  effect  on  the  creditworthiness  and  credibility  of  the  Government.\nThe Program loan will help avoid such a crisis.\n\n\f30\n\n119.\nThe overall design of the program will not have any obvious direct impact on the poor as\na separate group. The policy actions and conditions are designed to have broad effects across\nthe whole community; however, in the design of the conditions, special consideration has  been\ngiven to the possible impact on the poor to avoid negative impacts. For example, in minimizing\nsubsidies on copra, consideration will be given to alternative means of maintaining incomes of\ncopra growers in outer islands. Changes in the income  tax system proposed under the Program\nwill benefit lower income groups and mitigate the impact of increase in import duties and other\ntaxes. Positive benefits will primarily be in the form of an improved \u201cenabling environment\u201d for\nproductive  investment.  The  improved  governance,  as  a  result  of  changes  in  public  sector  and\nfinancial  management,  is  expected  to  encourage  increased  levels  of  investment.  This  will  be\nfurther underpinned by improved access to micro-credit for the low income groups. In addition,\ngreater  certainty  in  fiscal  outcomes  will  ensure  cuts  to  essential  pro-poor  services,  such  as\ncopra purchases and primary health care are avoided.\n\nB. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures\n\nThe main risks in program implementation and the mitigating measures to manage the\n\n120.\nrisks are presented below.\n\nInadequate  Political  Commitment.  The  most  serious  risk  arises  from  the  possible\n121.\nweakening  of  political  commitment  to  reforms.  This  issue  becomes  particularly  important\nbecause  ADB\u2019s  earlier  program  loan  to  the  RMI  (PSRP)  had  only  partial  success.  After\ndiscussion during the Appraisal Mission, it was concluded that there are at least three reasons\nwhy the chances of success are better this time.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nOne key reason for the limited success of the PSRP was that very soon after its\ninception,  it  lost  the  main  champion  of  reform  \u2013  President  Amata  Kabua  \u2013  and\nthe  Government  that  followed  was  inclined  to  populist  policies  to  continue  in\npower.  The  victory  in  the  last  elections  of  the  reform-minded  Government  of\nPresident Note gives the new Government a powerful mandate and responsibility\nfor reforms. The new Government has made an explicit commitment to reform of\nthe  economy,  transparency  in  government,  stringent  anticorruption  measures,\nand  strict  enforcement  of  the  law.  It  has  brought  back  into  the  Government\nseveral  key  advisers  that  had  supported  the  late  President  Kabua\u2019s  reform\nprogram.  President  Note  himself  has  publicly  expressed  his  commitment  to\nreforms and has personally reiterated this commitment to ADB. To mitigate this\nrisk, it is envisaged that the major reform measures will be supported by acts of\nParliament, making reversals more difficult. Emphasis is also put on institutional\nreform  in  mechanisms  and  working  procedures  of  MOF  and  Government  in\ngeneral to maintain the discipline envisaged under the program.\n\nBoth the Government and the public are now worried about the consequences of\ncontinuing  along  the  past  lines  and  not  introducing  structural  reforms.  The\nanalysis by the US General Accounting Office of the inefficiencies in the use of\nCompact  funds  in  the  past  and  the  publicity  surrounding  the  report  have  driven\nhome  the  point  that  unless  reforms  are  introduced,  there  will  be  adverse\nconsequences  on  the  size  and  flexibility  in  the  use  of  future  Compact  funding.\nThere  is  also  widespread  fear  that  the  per  capita  income  of  the  county  may\ndecline  severely  over  the  long  term  if  reforms  are  not  initiated.  Even  more\nimportantly,  the  sharp  increase  in  youth  unemployment  and  emergence  of\n\n\f31\n\n(iii) \n\npockets  of  vagrancy  and  poverty  have  instilled  fear  in  the  society  that  without\nreforms the country may lose its cherished traditions of good law and order and\ndemocracy.  Intensive  consensus  building  has  ensured  that  not  just  the\nGovernment  but  various  other  stakeholders  feel  a  sense  of  ownership  for  the\nProgram.\n\nThe  Government  now  sees  more  clearly  the  role  of  multilateral  institutions  in\nhelping  to  design  and  implement  needed  reforms.  The  Government  sees  the\npolicy matrix not as an external imposition, but as a checklist for its own reform\nprogram  and  as  an  instrument  to  sustain  the  political  will  to  implement  these\nreforms.  The  Government  believes  that  it  is  politically  more  feasible  and\npractically  more  effective  to  have  conditionalities  proposed  by  multilateral\ninstitutions than by bilateral agencies. By entering into agreements on tough and\ncredible reforms with ADB, the Government believes it will be able to reduce the\nneed  for  politically  unacceptable  conditionalities  in  Compact  negotiations  and\nimprove  its  public  sector  to  levels  now  being  required  by  US  negotiators.  The\ninformal support given by US authorities to the program loan and its implicit link\nto Compact negotiations help to mitigate the risk of slippages on the program of\nreforms.\n\n122. Despite  these  mitigating  factors,  it  must  be  recognized  that  the  extensive  changes  the\nprogram  envisages  cannot  be  brought  about  in  the  short  term.  Sustained  effort  by  the\nGovernment  over  a  long  period  and  sustained  external  support  for  the  Program  beyond  the\ncurrent loan will be needed. The three-tranche method as well as the conditionalities expected\nto be required under the new Compact will help sustain the reform initiatives.\n\n123. National Capacity Constraints. To enhance the institutional capacity to implement the\nreforms,  skill  formation  and  an  associated  TA  are  provided.  In  addition,  ADB\u2019s  continued\nsupport  through  the  Pacific  Financial  Technical  Assistance  Centre  and  projects  in  health  and\neducation  sectors  will  help  in  implementing  the  Program.  It  is  also  expected  that  when  young\nUS-trained  graduates  join  the  Government,  the  national  capacity  for  sound  economic\nmanagement  will  improve.  Building  on  the  lessons  of  the  past,  ADB  will  make  extra  efforts  to\nensure the high quality of experts mobilized under its TA program. In addition, special Compact\nfunding  may  be  set  aside  for  TA  in  capacity  building,  allowing  funds  to  be  used  to  finance\nconsultants in line position until counterpart staff are ready to take over.\n\n124. Resource  Constraints.  Another  risk  is  that  adequate  financial  resources  will  not  be\navailable  to  meet  the  program  needs.  In  this  connection,  the  most  serious  risk  relates  to  the\noutcome of Compact negotiations. If Compact funding for the future is substantially less than the\ncurrent levels, Government will need to further reduce expenditures and exert greater efforts at\nresource  mobilization.  The  program  loan  articulating  the  Government\u2019s  determination  to  use\nCompact resources more effectively than in the past is itself a factor that can mitigate the risk of\nsubstantial reduction in Compact funding.\n\nLess-Than  Expected  Financial  Returns  on  MIITF.  If  the  rates  of  return  assumed  on\n125.\nthe  MIITF  are  not  realized,  the  long-term  objective  of  sustaining  income  levels  even  without\nCompact  funding  will  not  be  achieved.  The  rate  of  return  on  the  MIITF  was  assumed  to  be  5\npercent. That is a conservative assumption considering the performance of privately managed\nfunds  such  as  pension  funds  in  the  US  over  the  long  term.

The following are recommendations of\nthe Government\u2019s Task Force on Accountability with inputs from the Pacific Financial Technical\nAssistance  Centre  (PFTAC).  The  aim  is  to  establish  clear  and  robust  systems  of  annual  and\nmedium-term budgeting, financial control, accounting, internal audit, and reporting to the Nitijela.\n\n(i)\n\nAnnual budget document. Detailed estimates are to be presented to the Nitijela in\nsupport  of  the  annual  (and  any  other)  appropriation  bill.  The  estimates  will  be\npublicly available and will show in a clear format:\n\n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\n(h) \n\nto \n\nthe \n\nlegislation\n\nreference \n\nrevenue,  with \n\ntotal estimated revenue, expenditure, and expected overall balance;\nproposal to use any estimated surplus or finance any deficit;\nexpected  sources  of \nempowering the collection;\nallocation of expenditure to heads, subheads, and items in sufficient detail\nto show clearly how public moneys are to be spent on which Government\npolicies and programs;\nagainst each head of expenditure, a summary of the policies, programs,\nand  specific  performance  targets  expected  to  be  achieved  during  the\nbudget year;\ncomparative revenue and expenditure for the current and previous fiscal\nyears;\nstatements  of  opening  and  closing  balances  and  flows  of  funds  for  all\npublic financial assets and liabilities, including trust and special funds, for\nthe last two fiscal years and the budget year; and\nstatements of external aid programs, balances, proposed disbursements,\nand commitments.\n\nframework \n\nfinancing,  organized \n\n(MTBF).  The  annual  budget  estimates\nMedium-term  budget \npresented  to  the  Nitijela  are  to  be  accompanied  by  an  MTBF.  The  MTBF  will\npresent  a  four-year  statement  of  the  Government  budget,  by  main  heads  of\nrevenue,  expenditure,  and \nthe\ngovernment finance statistics format. The first year of the framework will be the\ncurrent  year,  showing  the  latest  revised  estimates.  The  second  year  will  be  the\nyear for which the estimates are being submitted to the Nitijela for appropriation,\nand  the  allocations  to  heads  will  be  as  in  the  estimates.  The  third  and  fourth\nyears will show estimated revenues based on current policy, and the allocations\nof expenditure that would result from implementing of the policies and programs\napproved by the Cabinet. Allocations will refer to the appropriate passages in the\naccompanying economic policy statement (EPS).\n\nin  accordance  with \n\nFinancial  control.  Provisions  are  to  be  put  in  place  to  prevent  unauthorized\nexpenditure  from  the  general  fund  and  to  limit  expenditure  from  trust  or  special\nfunds to the unexpended balance of each fund. The power of the Government to\nauthorize expenditure in excess of the total appropriation through supplementary\nappropriation  bills  will  be  limited  to  a  specified  fraction  of  the  original\nappropriation, and restricted to urgent and unforeseen circumstances. The power\nof the minister to move funds within the estimates will likewise be strictly limited\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 3, page 2\n\nand  its  exercise  must  be  promptly  reported  to  the  Nitijela.  Significant  penalties\nwill  be  imposed  for  breach  of  these  rules.  Authority  delegated  to  accounting\nofficers will be linked to strict reporting and sub-control requirements. For cash-\nflow reasons, the minister of finance will retain the power to restrict expenditure.\nBank  accounts  will  be  consolidated  and  control/recovery  of  imprest  accounts\ntightened. The secretary for finance will control use of credit facilities. The Public\nAccounts Committee of the Nitijela is to be made effective as the principal forum\nof Government accountability to Parliament.\n\n(iv)\n\n(v) \n\nAccounting.  The  accounting  system  will  be  overhauled/replaced.  The  existing\nsystem  is  not  efficient,  and  its  output  requires  costly  on-site  support  by  its\ninstaller  (a  foreign  contractor).  Daily  position  statements,  weekly  cash  flow\nanalysis and monthly statements of account to the minister are to be established,\nleading to semiannual statements to the Nitijela comprehensively setting out the\nGovernment\u2019s financial position. Accounting officers will be required to reconcile\ntheir accounting records with the central Government accounts at least monthly.\n\nReporting. A comprehensive structure of reporting will be put in place, designed\nto  take  up  minimum  time  in  preparing  reports  but  detecting  and  requiring\nexplanation  for  any  significant  divergences  from  the  budget,  and  culminating  in\nan  annual  report  to  the  Nitijela  by  the  secretary  for  finance  (who  is  the  top  civil\nservant in the ministry).\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 4, page 1\n\nIMPROVING COORDINATION OF ECONOMIC POLICY\n\nA.\n\nEstablishment of Economic Policy, Planning and Statistics Office\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe Economic Policy, Planning and Statistics Office (EPPSO) will be located in\nthe capitol complex, forming part of the Office of the President.

The major components of the program\nthe  RMI  Government,  strengthening  budget\ninclude  stabilizing \nmanagement,  developing  a  fiscal  stabilization  trust  fund,  improving  the  effectiveness  of  the\npublic  service,  and  enhancing  the  policy  environment  for  the  private  sector.  The  strategies\nproposed in the FFMP reflect the recommendations flowing from the Meto 2000 (TA 3284-RMI)\nand  preliminary  findings  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  work  on  Poverty  Reduction\nStrategies for the Pacific developing member countries (PDMC) (RETA 5907).\n\nfiscal  situation  of \n\nthe \n\n2. \nIn  the  past,  poverty  was  not  seen  as  a  significant  issue  in  the  RMI.  While  inequalities\nexist  between  those  living  in  the  urban  areas  and  those  on  the  outer  islands,  the  general\nperception  has  been  that  the  people  of  the  RMI  had  a  reasonable  standard  of  living.  The\nperception  has  been  perpetuated  by  the  use  of  the  GDP  per  capita  measure  to  indicate  the\ngeneral  welfare  in  the  community.  The  figures  for  the  RMI  indicate  that  the  RMI  is  relatively\nbetter off than other PDMCs, while not allowing for distributional disparities. The perception that\nthe  RMI  has  a  reasonable  standard  of  living  does  not  fully  accord  with  statistical  data,  which\nshows  the  RMI  ranking  8th  among  the  PDMCs  in  terms  of  the  United  Nations  Development\nProgramme\u2019s (UNDP) human development index (HDI) and human poverty index (HPI) indices.\nThis must be viewed as a disappointing result, given the level of income enjoyed for much of the\npast  15  years.  Of  more  immediate  concern  are  the  medium-  to  long-term  prospects.  If  the\nCompact of Free Association (Compact) is renewed with far less advantageous terms, income\nlevels  will  plummet  and  many  people  are  likely  to  be  forced  into  poverty.  The  FFMP  loan\nassistance aims to put in place assistance to minimize this possibility.\n\n3. \nAlthough there is no agreed upon definition of poverty as it relates to the RMI, evidence\nfrom  statistical  sources  and  anecdotal  evidence  indicate  huge  disparities  in  cash  income\navailable  to  communities.  This  is  most  obvious  in  the  rural-urban  dichotomy,  with  the  1999\ncensus data shown in Figure A1 indicating that households in urban areas have vastly greater\nincomes than those in rural areas. This situation is also skewed by the existence of pockets of\nthe  population  who  are  in  receipt  of  substantial  compensation  payments  as  a  result  of  the\nnuclear testing carried out by the United States (US) after World War II.\n\n4. \nThe RMI is a highly urbanized society with over 65 percent of the population residing in\nthe urban centers of Majuro and Ebeye. Although urban households may have higher incomes\nin  many  cases,  the  number  of  persons  per  household  will  offset  this  to  some  extent.\nSubstantially lower income levels in rural areas are partially offset by access to the subsistence\nsafety net. This observation has been reinforced by the physical evidence of distinct pockets of\nurban poverty in Majuro and Ebeye. This assessment will distinguish between rural and urban\nimpacts.\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 5, page 2\n\nFigure A1: Median Household Income, 1999\n\n16,000\n\n14,000\n\n12,000\n\n10,000\n\n8,000\n\n6,000\n\n4,000\n\n2,000\n\n0\n\np\npla\ngla\nAilin\n\nk\n\nAilu\n\no\nn\nr\nA\n\nr\nu\nA\n\nn\no\nb\nE\n\nt\na\nb\na\nJ\n\naluit\n\nJ\n\nk\na\nt\ne\nw\ne\nn\nE\n\n)\ne\ny\ne\nb\nE\n(\n \n\n(\n\nBikini)\nKili \najalein\n\nw\nK\n\nSource: 1999 RMI Census of Population and Housing\n\ne\na\nL\n\nLib\n\np\n\nLikie\n\no\nr\naju\nM\n\np\nela\nalo\nM\n\nejit\nM\n\nMili\n\nu\nm\na\nN\n\nrik\nd\nm\na\nN\n\ne\n\nUja\n\nrik\nt\nU\n\no\nh\nt\no\nW\n\ntje\no\nW\n\n5. \nAs  discussed  in  paragraphs  20-24,  there  will  be  positive  and  negative  impacts  on  the\npoor.  However,  there  are  likely  to  be  indirect  and  long-term  effects.  Negative  effects  can  be\nmitigated  by  careful  design  of  the  various  policy  actions  envisaged  and  also  by  careful\nconsideration of the terms of reference of the various reviews to be undertaken. Without reform,\nthe effects on the poor could be severe and long-term.\n\n6. \nNo  direct  mitigating  effects  are  included  in  the  FFMP;  however,  indirect  effects  will  be\nevident. Government services will be maintained in key social sectors to mitigate the regressive\nnature  of  tax  changes.  Careful  design  and  protecting  transfer  payments  and  subsidies  (e.g.,\ncopra and outer island shipping) to the less well-off will provide a safety net for the poor.\n\nB.\n\nMeasuring Impacts of Reform under the FFMP\n\n7. \nThe overall design of the FFMP will not have any obvious direct impact on the poor as a\nseparate  group.  The  policy  actions  and  conditions  are  designed  to  have  broad  effects  across\nthe whole community, however, in the design of the conditions special consideration was given\nto  avoid  possible  negative  impacts  on  the  poor.  For  example,  income  tax  relief  to  low-income\nearners will offset the regressive impact of increased import duties. Subsidies will be minimized,\nbut justifiable subsidies such as to the copra industry will be considered.\n\n8. \nEven with the best design, it may be impossible to avoid effects on the poorest sections\nof  the  community.  Although  the  fiscal  stabilization  actions  will  have  indirect  effects  due  to\nchanges  in  prices  of  goods  bought  and  sold  by  the  poor,  such  effects  will  be  impossible  to\ndirectly  measure  in  advance.  Increased  pressure  on  Government  services  will  affect  the  poor,\nbut the program loan aims to avoid collapse of the most sensitive service delivery areas, which\nis likely without program assistance.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 5, page 3\n\nC.\n\nMethodology\n\n9. \nADB\u2019s methodology for social impact assessment of program loans notes that analyzing\nthe  specific  impact  of  program  loans  and  specific  policy  actions  on  economic  conditions  is\ndifficult. Social impact, and therefore the impact on the poor, reflects the economic impact. No\nspecific  indications  or  measures  quantify  the  impact  of  reforms  on  specific  groups  in  the\ncommunity.  However,  the  FFMP  recommends  the  establishment  of  the  Economic  Policy,\nPlanning  and  Statistics  Office  (EPPSO),  which  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  the  poverty\nimpacts of the FFMP.\n\n10. \nThe methodology to be used in assessing the impact of the FFMP follows ADB\u2019s agreed-\nupon  methodology.  Three  scenarios  are  presented.  Scenario  1  assumes  that  none  of  the\nrecommended reforms under the FFMP are implemented. The result will likely be the collapse\nof the Government\u2019s essential public services that currently form a social safety net to the poor.\nThis could force the Government into commercial borrowing to fund its short-term cash flow and\nperpetuating  recent  imprudent  financial  practices.  The  lack  of  reform  measures  will  limit  the\nability  of  the  Government  to  use  the  renegotiated  economic  provisions  of  the  Compact  most\neffectively.\n\n11. \nScenario 2 assumes that the Government will implement reforms under the FFMP, but\nwithout  external  financial  support.  Given  the  lag  period  involved  in  the  effect  of  some  of  the\nreforms and the seriousness of the short-term cash flow situation, the Government is still likely\nto experience a collapse of social services in the short term. In the long term, the reforms will\nhave a positive effect on the ability of the Government to use the assistance forthcoming from\nthe  Compact  renegotiations  to  support  pro-poor  growth.  This  positive  impact  will  only  be\napparent after significant pain and a long adjustment period.\n\n12. \nScenario  3  envisages  that  the  Government  will  undertake  reforms  supported  by  the\nFFMP loan. This assistance will support the Government\u2019s public services in the short term and\navoid  collapse  of  the  social  safety  net  by  stabilizing  the  fiscal  situation  and  then  establishing\nsustainable  revenue  prospects.  Fiscal  policies  will  be  a  tightened  and  spending  priorities\nrationalized, which will involve a short to medium-term adjustment period. The implementation\nof reforms will have a positive impact on the ability of the RMI to use funds forthcoming from the\nrenewed economic provisions of the Compact.\n\n13. \nThe  impact  of  the  FFMP  is  considered  from  four  perspectives  through  which  the\nscenarios will affect the poor: (i) demand for unskilled labor, (ii) the prices of the goods bought\nand sold by the poor, (iii) public transfers (transfers minus taxes) to the poor, and (iv) access to\npublic  and  rationed  goods  and  services.  The  impacts  will  then  be  grouped  under  four\ncategories: (i) direct effects, (ii) indirect effects, (iii) macroeconomic effects, and (iv) effects on\nvulnerable urban groups (VUG) who may become poor due to the project effects.\n\n14. \nIf we look at the poor as largely rural, then the impact of the FFMP is likely to be minor\ngiven that the poor survive largely on a subsistence basis. The one exception is the only cash\ncrop on the islands, copra, which the Government heavily subsidizes. In addition, education and\nhealth services to the rural areas are rudimentary, but fiscal problems will likely have an effect.\nThe effect in the urban areas is likely to be greater, but just as difficult to identify.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 5, page 4\n\nD.  Policy Actions with Significant Impact on the Poor\n\n15. \nAs noted in para. 7 the policy actions of the FFMP appear to have little direct impact\non the poor. They will, however, alleviate the impacts on the poor of the no-reform scenario and\nestablish the foundation for long-term pro-poor growth. The indirect effects will be spread across\nthe whole program and will be examined in the context of the scenarios proposed earlier.\n\nE. \n\nThree Scenarios\n\n1. \n\nScenario 1: No Reform\n\n16. \nIn  this  scenario,  the  Government  public  services  will  collapse  with  the  inability  to  meet\npayroll  and  other  existing  financial  obligations.  Compact  receipts  coming  from  a  two-year\nextension of the existing economic provisions may alleviate the problems in the medium term,\nbut  prospects  for  long-term  growth  will  still  be  poor.1  The  funds  will  become  available,  as\nprevious  transfers  that  have  been  consumed  by  debt  servicing  requirements  will  finish  in\nOctober.  When  the  funds  become  available,  it  is  likely  that  expenditure  levels  would  return  to\nprevious levels, although, given the fiscal record of the RMI, the prospects of this money leading\nto substantial development are not good.\n\na. \n\nDirect Impact\n\n17.  With no reform there will be severe impacts on the poor, as public services are likely to\ncollapse in the short term. Prospects for unskilled labor to secure employment will diminish as\nGovernment expenditures come under immediate pressure. Effects on the rural poor will not be\ntangible since they operate largely outside the cash economy. The major exception is the cash\nreceived from production of copra, which is heavily subsidized by the Government in the form of\nan  artificially  high  purchase  price.  Already  the  rural  areas  are  feeling  the  impacts,  since  the\nsubsidized copra price has been lowered twice in the past six months. Since copra is the one\nsignificant  cash-generating  activity  on  the  outer  islands,  cash  incomes  for  those  living  in  the\nrural areas will be significantly reduced. Additionally, transfers to local governments will possibly\nbe  affected  although  these  are  not  significant  items  in  the  Government  budget  except  for  the\nKwajalein local government (Ebeye).\n\n18. \nThe  possibility  of  severe  disruption  to  public  services  will  affect  the  urban  poor  in  a\nnumber of ways. Most notably services will be lacking as the Government restricts its services\nbecause of its cash flow problems. The possibility of the Government failing to meet its payroll\nwill  have  a  severe  effect  in  households  with  single  wage  earners.  Many  public  service  wage\nearners also have sizable personal loans to service, so the possibility of a payroll disruption will\nhave a compounding effect on the poorest households as debt accumulates.\n\nb.\n\nIndirect Impact\n\n19. \nThe  indirect  impacts  are  longer  term,  but  the  outlook  for  unskilled  labor  in  the  longer\nterm is poor given the long-term revenue prospects of the Government. Unskilled labor will find\nit  more  difficult  to  secure  work  as  the  services  sector  suffers  from  reduced  Government\nexpenditure. Prospects for transfers to the poorer members of the community will be dim given\n                                                          \n1  The  Compact  provides  for  a  temporary  two-year  extension  of  the  economic  provisions  of  the  Compact  if\nnegotiations on renewal of these provisions are not completed. Formal negotiations have yet to commence and are\nlikely to be lengthy, meaning that the likelihood of an extension is extremely high. A view is that the Compact funds\nare only available for capital and not recurrent expenditure, but the veracity of this information is unconfirmed.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 5, page 5\n\nthat there is unlikely to be any improvement in the utilization of Compact funds. The economy is\nlikely  to  remain  relatively  stagnant  in  the  foreseeable  future,  with  little  likelihood  of  increased\nself-reliance.\n\nc.\n\nMacroeconomic Impact\n\n20. \nAs  Government  financial  reserves  are  already  exhausted,  there  are  no  additional\nresources  to  draw  upon  to  fund  deficits.  Contracting  Government  expenditure  will  impact  on\nrecurrent expenditures and hence the private sector. Prospects for unskilled labor will continue\nto deteriorate along with Government services. Increased Government borrowing to fund cash\nflow  will  exacerbate  the  lack  of  reserves  and  lead  to  a  debt  spiral  as  discretionary  revenues\nhave  to  be  increasingly  dedicated  to  debt  servicing.  Lack  of  social  services  can  lead  to  social\ninstability  as  unemployment  increases  with  the  flow-on  effect  from  the  lack  of  Government\nexpenditure having a cumulative effect throughout the economy.\n\nd. \n\nImpact on the Vulnerable Urban Groups\n\n21.  With  no  reform,  the  deterioration  of  public  services  will  impact  on  vulnerable  urban\ngroups,  considering  vulnerable  urban  groups  are  predominantly  urban.  Just  like  the  poor,\nvulnerable  urban  groups  will  feel  the  effects  but  will  be  able  to  offset  the  negative  impact  to\nsome  extent.  Being  predominantly  urban  gives  vulnerable  urban  groups  greater  access  to  the\nmigration option, through access to the US granted under the Compact. One apparent impact of\nthe reduction-in-force program was the increase in out-migration to the US as staff reductions\ntook place and the economy contracted. This option was open to the vulnerable urban groups\nbut of course was not available to the poorest in the community. Many of the vulnerable urban\ngroups  who  migrated  have  apparently  taken  up  unskilled  work  in  the  US.  If  Government\nfinances continue to deteriorate and expenditures restricted ,then retrenchments in the private\nsector  are  likely  to  occur  resulting  in  vulnerable  urban  groups  income  earners  becoming\nunemployed and entering the realm of the poor. Migration will be a major option.\n\n2.\n\nScenario 2: Reform Without Program Loan\n\n \n\na.\n\nDirect Impact\n\n22. \nThe  dire  fiscal  situation  of  the  Government\u2019s  finances  means  that  reform  without\nassistance from the program loan will cause significant problems, as in Scenario 1. The impacts\non the poor will result from the collapse of health and education services (para. 17). The rural\npoor  will  continue  to  suffer  in  the  short  term,  experience  indicating  that  in  times  of  fiscal\nproblems, resources are more tightly concentrated in urban centers. But, as noted in para. 14,\ndeterioration  cannot  reduce  services  much  on  the  outer  islands  because  of  their  current\nrudimentary state.\n\n23. \nThe  urban  poor  are  likely  to  suffer  more  than  the  rural  poor  in  both  a  relative  and\nabsolute sense as services cease or salaries are unpaid. Unlike in the PSRP, the loss of jobs\nand  salaries  is  unlikely  to  be  permanent,  although  hardship  will  be  severe  in  the  short  to\nmedium term. However, the urban poor will also benefit earlier from the recovery as the reforms\nbegin  to  yield  results  and  improvements  from  Compact  assistance  spread  through  the\ncommunities.  Little  of  these  benefits  will  accrue  to  the  outer  islands  in  the  medium  term  until\nbetter mechanisms are developed to distribute wealth more equitably and efficiently.\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 5, page 6\n\nb.\n\nIndirect Impact\n\n24.  Without  assistance,  the  Government  cannot  avoid  the  reality  of  a  short-term  budget\ncrunch. Labor markets, especially for unskilled labor, will be depressed in the short to medium\nterm, but after a painful adjustment period prospects will brighten. There is also less likelihood\nthat  the  reforms  will  be  adopted  quickly.  The  considerable  pain  can  lead  to  backtracking  on\nreforms without including mitigating measures. Without the accompanying technical assistance\nfor policy reform, implementation lags and policy errors can delay the recovery and exacerbate\nproblems in the economy. There will be little prospect for maintaining transfers in the short term,\nincluding subsidies to the outer islands. In the medium term, services will stagnate but possibly\nimprove in the longer term.\n\nc.\n\nMacroeconomic Impact\n\n25. \nThe contraction of the Government\u2019s budget will limit the ability of the private sector to\ndrive  any  sort  of  employment  growth.  Job  prospects  especially  for  the  unskilled  will  remain\nbleak.  Prices  will  probably  increase  as  the  private  sector  contracts,  resulting  in  reduced\ncompetition. This may be partially offset by downward pressure on wages, the major input into\nprices  in  the  RMI.  Restricted  public  transfers  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  tight  budgetary\nsituation  can  lead  to  social  and  economic  instability.  This  can  be  exacerbated  by  poor  social\nservices to provide the necessary safety net. Prospects in the longer term will improve after a\npainful adjustment period.\n\nd. \n\nImpact on Vulnerable urban groups\n\n26. \nAs the Government services reach crisis, vulnerable urban groups will possibly lose jobs\nor at least experience problems when the Government cannot meet its payroll obligations. Job\nprospects are likely to be severely curtailed for both skilled and semiskilled workers. Prices will\nbe  affected  by  increases  in  import  duties  as  the  Government  tries  to  shore  up  its  revenue.\nHowever, with a weak labor market, there could be downward pressure on wages. There will be\nincreased  pressure  on  public  services  and  vulnerable  urban  groups  will  suffer  as  the  services\ndeteriorate and possibly become more expensive.\n\n3.\n\nScenario 3: Reforms with Program Loan\n\n27. \nThe  goal  of  the  FFMP  is  to  stabilize  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  position  and  thereby\nstabilize  the  overall  economy.  The  assistance  should  alleviate  the  current  crisis  by  increasing\nGovernment revenues to sustainable levels while maintaining the social safety net for the poor.\nThe scale of the problems facing the Government will cause a downturn in the economy, but it\nwill be followed by significantly improved prospects in the medium to long term. The assistance\nshould prevent job losses and set the path for moderate employment growth.\n\na.\n\nDirect Impact\n\nThe  assistance  should  at  least  maintain  existing  employment  without  the  need  for  any\n28. \nretrenchments  in  the  Government.  Tightening  of  fiscal  policy  will  probably  put  pressure  on\ncertain  private  sector  operators  and  result  in  some  private  sector  layoffs,  but  these  should  be\nminimized. As import duties are increased, minor increase in prices should be partially offset by\ncompensating  income  tax  relief  for  low-income  earners.  There  is  little  prospect  in  the  medium\nterm of the Government\u2019s finances being able to cope with increases in the copra-buying price\ndespite  the  political  nature  of  the  subsidy.  Public  transfers  and  essential  government  services\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 5, page 7\n\nshould  be  maintained;  however,  these  transfers  and  nonessential  services  are  likely  to  be\nrationalized as the Government refines its spending priorities.\n\nb.\n\nIndirect Impact\n\n29. \nIn  the  medium  term,  it  is  expected  that  improvements  to  the  policy  environment  in  the\nprivate sector combined with a more disciplined fiscal policy can lead to moderate employment\ngrowth  for  unskilled  labor.  Minor  price  rises  can  impact  on  people  with  fixed  incomes  such  as\nretirees  and  those  that  receive  nuclear  compensation  payments.  Public  transfers  will  be\nrationalized, but stabilization of the Government\u2019s fiscal position may allow the Government to\nbe  more  sympathetic  to  consideration  of  pro-poor  transfer  payments  such  as  to  the  outer\nislands.  Additional  privatization,  corporatization,  and  contracting  out  can  restrict  directly\nprovided government services, but there could be efficiency gains with the private sector taking\nover some of these services, and assuming that institutional capacity exists in the public service\nto oversee contracts.\n\nC.\n\nMacroeconomic Impact\n\n30. \nAdjustment  in  the  fiscal  policy  with  the  review  of  the  taxation  systems  to  make  it  more\nprogressive  without  negative  impacts  on  private  sector  incentives  should  support  employment\ngrowth at a moderate level. The key will be to ensure that the review of the tax regime promotes\nthe private sector and maintains incentives. The proposed increases in import duties will have\nsome  effect  on  prices,  and  the  private  sector  passes  changes  in  the  tax  structures  on  to  the\nconsumers in the form of higher prices. Promoting a competition policy can assist in minimizing\nprice increases from tax changes. Fiscal balance should also allow public transfers to continue\nto  the  most  needy,  with  some  justifiable  rationalization  based  on  transferring  wealth  to  those\nmost  in  need.  Additionally,  the  fiscal  balance  should  ensure  that  essential  services  are\nmaintained at levels to support the poor.\n\nd.\n\nImpact on Vulnerable urban groups\n\n31. \nThe vulnerable urban groups should be able to maintain their employment, though there\nmay be some layoffs in the private sector from the flow-on effect as the Government rationalizes\nits spending patterns. Vulnerable urban groups will experience increases in prices, but the lower\nincome  earners  will  experience  tax  relief.  Public  transfers  to  vulnerable  urban  groups  will\nprobably  decrease  with  the  rationalization  of  these  transfers,  but  vulnerable  urban  groups  will\nbenefit  from  the  continuation  of  essential  social  services  such  as  education  and  health  even\nthough some more peripheral services may be terminated.\n\n\fLONG-TERM CASH FLOW FORECAST\n($ million)\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nTotal\n\nItem\nA.
