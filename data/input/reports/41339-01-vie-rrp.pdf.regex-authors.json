I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on two proposed \nloans to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Skills Enhancement Project. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n2.  The project will produce a more competitive and highly skilled workforce in priority \nindustries  by  developing  higher  level  training  programs  at  a  new  college  level,  while  also \nestablishing  and  strengthening  system  governance  and  quality  assurance  frameworks  for \nvocational training. Studies will also strengthen the policy foundation for future development.  \n \n3.  The  project  will  improve  the  quality  and  management  of  vocational  education  and \ntraining (VET) programs in 15 public and 5 private vocational colleges (VCs) in economic zones \noffering programs for occupations in high demand in priority industries. The programs cover \nautomotive  technology,  electrical  manufacturing,  hospitality  and  tourism,  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT), mechanical manufacturing, and navigation and shipping. The \nproject will consist of two loans, the first to strengthen the public vocational training system and \nVCs, and the second to provide private VCs with additional resources through an onlending \nfacility.  The  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  project  will  be  students  in  certificate  and  diploma \nvocational training courses, most of whom come from the rural lower middle class.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n4.  Viet Nam\u2019s poverty reduction and economic growth achievements in the last 20 years \nare a great success story. Real gross domestic product grew by an average of 8% per year from \n2003 to 2007 and per capita income increased from $441 in 2002 to $818 in 2007.1 Exports \nhave been the main driver of growth, and foreign investments have been buoyant. This high \nlevel of growth has changed the economic structure; the share of industry and services in the \ngross domestic product has steadily increased, while the share of agriculture has declined.  \n \n5.  Job growth has been strong over the decade, with changing employment patterns that \nreflect the changes in the economic structure. Agriculture's share of employment has declined \nfrom 66% to 50%, industry and construction has increased from 10% to 20%, while service \nsector employment has increased from 24% to 30%.  Employment growth is highest in industry \nand services, but is also strong in tourism. ICT and science and technically based industries are \nsmall but growing. If Viet Nam is to expand as an industrialized country, it must develop highly \nskilled industrial workers who can increase enterprise productivity, product quality and service \nstandards. Viet Nam\u2019s long-term prosperity and economic development depends on increasing \nits competitiveness in regional and global markets. For the first time, a shortage of labor has \nbecome an obstacle to expanding business.2 A major challenge for the VET sector, therefore, is to \nproduce more and better qualified skilled workers. At present, only 13% of the employable \nworkforce has vocational qualifications. \n \n6.  The VET system is being transformed by a new focus on higher level skills, through the \nrecent establishment of a college level. There are currently 90 public VCs and 20 private VCs.  \nIn response to the demand for a more highly skilled workforce, the government has developed \n                                                 \n1   ADB, Country Operations Business Plan. Viet Nam 2009-2011. Manila. 2008.  \n2  United Nations Industrial Development Organization. 2009. Skill Development for Vietnam\u2019s Industrialization. \nHa Noi. ", "2 \nan excellent set of policies to strengthen the VET system, through the new Law on Vocational \nTraining, 2006, effective in 2008. The major provisions of this law are (i) expansion of a more \nadvanced level of training; (ii) improved VET quality and relevance; (iii) greater involvement of a \nrange  of  partners,  particularly  from  the  private  sector;  and  (iv)  strengthened  VET  sector \nmanagement  under  one  central  agency,  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  Invalids  and  Social  Affairs \n(MOLISA). Most of the groundwork for this law was laid under the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)-supported Vocational and Technical Education Project (VTEP).3 Implementation of the \nmajor provisions of the law forms the foundation of the proposed project.  \n \n7.  Many VET graduates lack appropriate technical and general work skills. The immediate \ncauses are poor training quality and management capacity, weak sector management, and \nlimited  private  sector  collaboration  and  partnerships.  This  is  underpinned  by  inadequate \nfinancing of the VET sector and vocational training institutions. In addition, the VET system is \nlargely supply-driven, reinforced by input-focused financing and the absence of skills standards \nthat link specific competencies to labor market needs. Limited collaboration with industry has \nreinforced this tendency. However, this is now changing and there is a strong desire within the \ngovernment to build a better training system that is more relevant to industry.   \n \n8.  The VTEP initiated significant reform in VET quality assurance systems, and modernized \nvocational training curricula in line with new production techniques and technologies, while \nsubstantially upgrading vocational secondary schools. Other donor initiatives include system \nreforms  and  strengthening  of  vocational  training  institutions  by  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement, the European Union, German development cooperation through GTZ and KfW, \nthe Government of the Republic of Korea, and the Government of Luxembourg. These projects \nhave all been successful in strengthening the lower levels of the vocational training system and \nhave expanded training opportunities for primary school and junior secondary school leavers.  \n \n9.  The  VTEP  illustrated  the  value  of  experimenting  with  new  approaches  within  a \ncircumscribed  context  before  system-wide  implementation.  It  focused  upon  improving  the \ntechnical skills of students and teachers, but weak management at the school and central levels \nundermined these efforts.4 Similarly, the absence of a training system to periodically update \nteachers' skills in response to new technologies and changing job markets hampered efforts to \nimprove teacher quality. The proposed project will address both of these weaknesses.  \n \n10.  Project approach. The project will address skills shortages in highly skilled occupational \nareas.  Fifteen  skilled  occupations  that  are  in  high  demand  in  high-growth  industries,  and \nrelevant to government development plans for five economic zones were identified through a \nlabor  market  survey  in  the  following  sectors:  (i)  automotive  technology,  (ii)  electrical \nmanufacturing,  (iii)  hospitality  and  tourism,  (iv)  ICT,  (v)  mechanical  manufacturing,  and \n(vi) transport (navigation and shipping). ICT and hospitality and tourism were chosen as many \nwomen work in these sectors. It is expected that the number of sectors with large numbers of \nwomen workers will increase as new jobs are created where gender is not an obstacle.5   \n \n11.  Skills shortages will be addressed through targeted occupational training programs in \npublic and private VCs. Training programs linked to skills shortages will be delivered in 15 public \nVCs by providing the management and teacher development programs needed for high-skill \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2008.

The  five  private  VCs  will  benefit  from  the  same \nprograms but new equipment will be financed through the onlending facility. All of the VCs \nselected have programs in the industry sectors selected, are located near economic zones, and \nhave good facilities and training quality. The five private VCs are financially sound.6 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact of the project will be a reduction in skills shortages in key occupations. The \noutcome  of  the  project  will  be  the  establishment  of  higher  level  skills  training  in  15  key \noccupations. The project aims to strengthen the capacity of the VET system to train highly \nskilled  workers  and  technicians  who  can  master  the  modern  technologies  required  by \nenterprises in the industrial and service sectors. Two of the six industry sectors selected have \nhigh female representation to ensure that women benefit equally from the project. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  The project adopts a demand-driven approach with effective participation by the private \nsector through (i) improving the quality and management of training; (ii) upgrading at least \n20 public  and  private  VCs  so  they  can  deliver  priority  occupational  programs;  and  \n(iii) strengthening partnerships with the private sector. Together these three outputs will facilitate \nthe  successful  establishment  of  advanced  skills  training  by  ensuring  more  effective  sector \nmanagement  through  uniform  standards  and  stronger  quality  assurance  to  overcome  the \ncurrent diversity and uneven quality resulting from multiple training providers. The private sector \nwill be supported to promote tighter links between the demands of the labor market and the \nvocational training system. The project will provide credit directly to private training providers to \nexpand the private training colleges, and will promote closer links between industry and the \ndevelopment and delivery of training programs across the VET system.  \n \n1.  Quality and Management of Training Improved \n \n14.  The project will support improvements in the quality and management of training by \nstrengthening  leadership,  planning  and  management  capacities  in  MOLISA  and  the  VCs, \nimproving the quality assurance system to ensure uniform quality across all VCs, developing \nskills standards and certification so trainees meet industry standards, and expanding access to \nand enrollment in VET. \n \n15.  Sector leadership enhanced. The project will promote more effective sector leadership \nand management by providing training to General Department of Vocational Training (GDVT) \nstaff to build capacity in (i) policy coordination and formulation; (ii) GDVT management; and \n(iii) management  of  national  VET  quality  assurance  programs,  the  vocational  training \ninformation system (VTIS), and strategic planning and resource allocation. A study to formulate \nrealistic cost norms for different occupational training programs will also be carried out to help \nGDVT prepare more accurate budget proposals that accurately reflect the true costs of training. \nGDVT will prepare a national VET training plan as well as annual operational plans. The project \nwill improve the capacity of provincial staff from GDVT, Department of Labor, Invalids and \nSocial Affairs, and other concerned ministries to manage, develop, and adapt VET training \nprograms to fit the requirements of local enterprises.  \n \n16.  The  project  will  also  design  a  management  information  system  to  cover  central, \nprovincial, and VC levels to improve planning, monitoring, and resource allocation. This will \n                                                 \n6  Selection Criteria and Profiles of Project Colleges (Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \naddress one of the most serious shortcomings of the current VET system. The new information \nsystem will be piloted in project VCs before a national rollout. \n \n17.  Professional standards for vocational instructors will be developed to reinforce uniform \nteacher quality and allow better targeted training programs. The new professional standards will \nbe aligned with the vocational qualifications framework and will incorporate both teaching and \ntechnical skills relevant to the selected occupational programs. A study to address the long-term \nproblem of how to attract and retain vocational instructors in the VET system will be carried out.  \n \n18.  Quality  assurance  strengthened.  The  project  will  implement  the  skills  standards \ncurrently being developed by MOLISA, and will strengthen skills testing and certification by \nsupporting the development of procedures for assessment and certification, including assessor \nstandards and a training program to train assessors. Assessment tools for each of the training \nprograms will be developed, for use by assessors and national skills testing centers. The current \nquality accreditation program for institutions will be strengthened to ensure uniform quality of \ntraining, and a new system for accrediting individual training programs will be introduced.   \n \n19.  On the basis of the new skills standards, curricula and training materials will be developed \nwith industry involvement. A materials development team (including representatives from industry) \nwill be formed for each occupational program to develop modular curriculum and training materials. \n \n20.  Access  and  enrollments  expanded.  The  project  will  support  a  national  social \nmarketing campaign to enhance the poor social image of VET and thereby increase VET \nenrollments\u2014targeting rural areas, women, and disadvantaged groups. The campaign will also \ntarget employers to inform them about the new programs to raise the quality of VET graduates \nand prepare them for employment. The social marketing program will train VC managers in \nstrategies for marketing their training programs to local industries.  \n \n  2.  Vocational Colleges Upgraded to Deliver Priority Occupational Programs \n     \n21.  The project will support the upgrading of 20 VCs to strengthen the capacity of the VET \nsystem  to  produce  highly  skilled  technicians  and  workers  for  key  industries.  Each  of  the \n15 public VCs will be upgraded to deliver good, market-relevant training in up to three of the 15 \noccupational training programs. Eight of these VCs will include training programs with the \npotential to attract larger numbers of female trainees. The management and training quality of at \nleast five private VCs will also be strengthened, but their physical facilities and equipment will be \nupgraded using funds from the onlending facility. \n \n22.  Quality  of  instructors  strengthened.  The  teaching  skills  of  instructors  will  be \nstrengthened through in-service training. This training will use industry employees as trainers  \nand provide both students and teachers with workplace training to expose them to current work \npatterns and technologies. This will lay the foundation for a system for periodic upgrading of \ntechnical skills and for remodelling the VC's 6-month pre-service training program. \n \n23.  Management capacity of vocational colleges strengthened. The project will support \nthe  development  of  a  modern  competency-based  management  training  program  to  train \nprincipals and VC management staff in strategic planning, leadership, financial management, \nmonitoring of performance and cost effectiveness, and entrepreneurship and marketing.  \n \n24.  Market-oriented program planning introduced. The project will train and support VCs to \nassess the quality and relevance of their training programs by measuring graduate employment \n ", "5 \nand employability, primarily through regular tracer studies. To improve program planning, staff will \nbe trained to conduct surveys on local skill needs and to use information from the vocational \ntraining and labor market information systems. The project will support a pilot program to improve \ncareer counseling and work placements, to improve student employment outcomes.  \n   \n3.  Partnerships with the Private Sector Strengthened \n \n25.  Development of private vocational colleges. Greater private sector involvement in the \nprovision  of  training,  encouraged  by  incentives,  is  a  government  priority.  The  government \nsupports a significant expansion of the VET system, accompanied by a gradual shifting of state \nfunding  from  the  public  to  the  private  sector.  The  project  will  support  this  objective  by \nestablishing a credit line for private VCs. Private VCs will be able to access credit to upgrade \ntheir equipment and facilities. Five private colleges have been identified by GDVT as potential \nborrowers, based on a survey of the 11 institutions that expressed interest in borrowing.7 The \ninstitutions were selected on the basis of their program's relevance to the project objectives as \nwell as their financial soundness. The training programs proposed for funding are all in high-\ntechnology areas: mechatronics, industrial electricity, welding, automotive technology, maritime, \nand ICT. The government is encouraging the private sector to provide more training places in \nhigh-technology areas such as these. The selected private VCs will be treated as part of the \noverall project, so that all human resource development, systems improvement, and other \nnonphysical inputs will be provided to the approved private VCs on a grant basis, as for the 15 \npublic VCs. It is expected that each institution will borrow $3 million\u2013$4 million. More private \nVCs will be identified by GDVT if the funds are not fully absorbed. The fund will be administered \nby the Vietnam Development Bank (VDB), which will approve individual applications.8 \n \n26.  Greater  involvement  of  industry.  VCs need strong managers who can forge new \npartnerships with local enterprises to facilitate work placements, more market-relevant training \nprograms, and better employment opportunities for graduates. Managers will be trained on how \nto communicate and partner successfully with local companies. At the same time, the concept of \ncorporate  social  responsibility  will  be  promoted  among  corporations  and  companies,  to \nencourage companies to support VET training programs and institutions consistent with their \ncorporate priorities. Finally, as Viet Nam lags significantly behind its neighbors in the provision \nof direct training by companies, a study will be carried out to investigate ways in which such \ntraining can be stimulated.   \n \n27.  Sustainability of vocational colleges improved. The project will support MOLISA's plan \nto improve the sustainability of VCs through business and service activities, including short-term \ncourses for workers. Revenue from these activities can be retained by VCs and can be used to \nenhance teacher salaries and other quality improvement activities. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n28.  The project is estimated to cost $78.0 million. The investment plan is summarized in \nTable 1. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7  The five short-listed VCs are Hai Phong Coastal Vocational College, Dong An College, Nam Viet International \nVocational Training College, Lilama Technical College 1, and Vinashin Shipbuilding Secondary Vocational School.  \n8  Onlending Facility for Private Vocational Colleges (Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR34,429,000 on regular terms and a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR13,772,000 \non hard terms, both from ADB's Special Funds resources (ADF) to help finance the project. Both \nloans will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years. The first loan, on ADF \nregular terms, is an investment loan and will have an interest rate charge of 1% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The second loan, on ADF hard terms, \nis a line of credit facility (LCF) and will have an interest rate charge of 2.22% per annum for the \nlife of the loan. The government will sign a subsidiary loan agreement with VDB, and will relend \nthe second loan amount to VDB for LCF using the ADF hard-term rate plus a service fee. The \nrelending will have a term of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years. VDB will sign a \nproject agreement with ADB specifying terms and conditions of the project component to be \nimplemented by VDB, and relending and onlending of the loan amount. VDB will use the \namount of the second loan for onlending subloans to the private VCs, under LCF, in either US \ndollars or local currency, on favorable credit terms through an onlending agreement between \nVDB and each private VC. The Onlending will have a term of maximum 20 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years. VDB will determine the interest rate and will bear the foreign exchange \nrisk. The loans will be used to build workshops and purchase equipment and materials to \nimprove training quality and expand access to vocational training. With respect to the free limit, \nthe maximum size for each subloan permitted under the project agreement will be $7 million.  \n  \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  70.00  89.7 \nADF (regular)   50.00   \nADF (hard term)   20.00     \nGovernment   8.00    10.3 \n  Total    78.00    100.0 \nADF = Asian Development Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n30.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \n32.  The direct beneficiaries of the proposed project will be the 24,000 students (of whom \n25% are women) currently enrolled in certificate and diploma courses. The majority come from \nrural areas and less wealthy families. From the last year of project implementation, the project \ncolleges will produce 7,335 graduates annually, of whom 35% will be women.  \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n33.  Economic viability. The economic benefits from the project will be derived mainly from \nthe incremental productivity gains resulting from improved quality and efficiency of training, \nexpressed in terms of the incremental income of the graduates. While it is reasonable to expect \nthat system-wide improvements in quality and efficiency will benefit all students in the VET \nsystem, only the incomes of graduates from programs supported by the project in public VCs \nare quantified as incremental benefits. These are the 4,000 graduates from the full-time 3-year \ncourses.  Altogether,  the  project  VCs  will  benefit  24,000  students  and  will  produce  7,335 \ngraduates each year at a 90% completion rate from year 5. In addition, the project VCs will offer \nshort courses for continuing skills upgrading. Total short course enrollment is assumed to be 1.5 \n                                                 \n9  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \ntimes the annual intake of the diploma programs (11,500 workers per year), of whom it is \nassumed 10,328 will complete the course. An estimated 35% of the total enrollment will be \nwomen and members of ethnic minorities. The project's economic internal rate of return was \nestimated over a 20-year period (2010\u20132030) to be 15%.   \n \n34.  Financial sustainability. The project requires a total government contribution of $8 million \nover its 5-year life. The government\u2019s annual commitment to the project will reach a high of 0.8% \nof the central education budget, decreasing to 0.02% by the end of the project. The government\u2019s \nannual commitment is therefore affordable, ranging from 0.04% to 0.15% of the VET budget. Its \nshare in the project is estimated to increase from $0.65 million in year 1 to $3.9 million in year 2, \nand $2.2 million in year 3, decreasing gradually to $0.14 million by the end of the project. The \npost-project incremental personnel expenditure, estimated at about 2% of the 2010 annual budget \nof $384 million, can be absorbed. However, some of the 5% incremental increase for operations \nwill be met by individual VCs. The introduction of an entrepreneurial approach will help increase \nfiscal self-sufficiency. The project is financially feasible and sustainable.  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n35.  ADB  carried  out  financial  management  and  procurement  capacity  assessments  of \nMOLISA  and  GDVT.  The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  concluded  that  both \nagencies have the capacity to carry out the project. Their performance under the VTEP was \nsatisfactory.  Nevertheless,  the  financial  assessment  did  identify  inefficient  and  outdated \nfinancial management and monitoring systems in MOLISA, GDVT, and VCs. The project will \ntrain  staff  in  financial  planning,  accounting,  auditing  and  control  and  will  implement  a \nperformance-based planning and budgeting system using the cost norms to be developed under \nthe project. The FMA is in the PAM.10 The procurement capacity assessment concluded that \nGDVT is experienced in procuring goods, works, and service. Although timeliness was initially \nan issue under the VTEP, this improved as the project management unit gained experience.  \n \n36.  The governance assessment for the education sector in Viet Nam found that most major \ncorruption risks are associated with procurement, particularly that conducted at the provincial \nlevel. Another source of risk comes from poor international competitive bidding specifications \nleading to bids from underqualified contractors. Efforts will be made to ensure that equipment \nspecifications under the project are correct. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the State Bank of Vietnam and MOLISA. The PAM \ndescribes the specific policy requirements and supplementary measures.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n37.  Although  Viet  Nam  has  made  impressive  progress  in  reducing  poverty,  15.5%  of \nhouseholds were still impoverished in 2006. Poverty is more pronounced in rural areas (where  \npoverty incidence ranges from 17% to 39%) than in urban areas and major industrial regions. A \nsocial  marketing  campaign  will  target  rural  students  and  young  workers,  women,  and \ndisadvantaged groups to attract more students into high-level skills training.  \n \n38.  The project will benefit rural lower and upper secondary school graduates, the group \nmost likely to enroll in VET courses. Although the project will operate at the college level, it will \nalso support overall institutional development and teacher training, which will raise the quality of \ntraining at the vocational secondary school level as well. Most students, particularly those from \nrural areas, will enter VCs through vocational secondary schools, whose entrance requirements \nrequire only completion of junior secondary school. Most students who complete regular high \n                                                 \n10 Appendix 7 of the Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2).  \n ", "9 \nschool  choose  university  for  further  studies.  Two  VCs  are  in  areas  with  significant  ethnic \nminority populations, most of whom are poor.  \n \n39.  The Project will help address the gender inequities. Women make up nearly half of the \nlabor force, but are underrepresented in skilled occupations with higher incomes. The labor force \nis  characterized  by  sex-segregation  by  occupation,  type  of  employment,  and  position.  Most \nwomen work in areas where they have traditionally been strongly represented, such as business \nand accounting, agriculture, and tourism and hospitality. Men dominate the industrial trades. \nFemale enrollment in the VET stream reflects these patterns as vocational training institutions \nwere established mainly to train for traditional male occupations in industry. However, this will \nchange as many of the new jobs being created in services and industry are equally acceptable to \nmen and women. VTEP institutions have had great success in increasing female enrollment and \nobtaining postgraduation salaries for women at virtually the same levels (94%) as for males.  \n \n40.  The project supports effective gender mainstreaming.  To ensure that girls benefit from \nthe project, a dual approach will be adopted. The training programs selected for upgrading \nunder the project include two industry sectors where girls are well represented.  Simultaneously, \npilot programs developed through school gender action plans will be supported to attract more \ngirls into male-dominated sectors such as electronics and electrical installation.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n41.  The involuntary resettlement categorization is C, as civil works include only upgrading of \nVC  facilities  within  existing  boundaries,  and  no  new  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  is \nenvisioned. The environmental categorization is also C. The indigenous peoples' categorization \nis B, as two VCs have been selected in areas with significant ethnic minority populations to \nensure  social  equity.  The  social  marketing  strategy  for  increasing  awareness  of  VET  will \naddress social and gender inequality issues. Further, the project will emphasize the importance \nof industry partners becoming more engaged in social corporate responsibility initiatives.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n42.  The  key  risks  and  mitigating  measures  associated  with  the  expected  outcome  and \noutputs of the project are summarized in Table 4.  \n \nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nOutcome   \nPoor image of VET will inhibit enrollment growth  Social marketing campaign will target rural youth and girls; actions \nin colleges will encourage girls to enroll. \nIndustry is not willing to participate fully in  Financial support will be provided for work placements; social \ndeveloping and delivering effective programs  marketing campaign will target industry. \nInadequate supply of new technical instructors due  A study will be carried out on the fundamental changes needed to \nto low salaries  teacher incentive structures.   \nOutputs   \nSerious lack of information on VET sector inhibits  National VTIS to be developed and trialed under the project. \nproper planning and resource allocation   International Labour Organization to develop national labor market \ninformation system. \nTeachers will not be able to deliver the new  Professional standards and new inservice training programs will be \noccupational training programs   developed; industry workers will teach in VCs.  \nToo few private VCs will qualify for, or be  A survey was conducted to identify qualified and interested private \ninterested in, the onlending facility   VCs. \nVC = vocational college, VET = vocational education and training, VTIS = vocational training information system. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff. \n \n ", "10 \n43.  The major risks at the impact level are that economic growth will be slow and that highly \nskilled labor will continue to be undervalued, resulting in low salaries and few incentives to take \nup vocational training. At the outcome level, there is a risk that (i) the poor image of VET will \ninhibit enrollment growth, (ii) industry will not be willing to participate fully in developing effective \nVET programs, and (iii) expansion of the vocational teaching force will be constrained by low \nsalaries and the low status of the profession. These risks are all addressed under the project. \nThe major risks associated with the outputs all have reasonable mitigation measures and are \nmanageable under the project. In summary, the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the risks. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n44.  The government and MOLISA have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n45.  In addition to the standard assurances, the government and MOLISA have agreed with \nADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project \nagreement. In addition, no withdrawals shall be made from the loan account for the LCF until \nthe subsidiary loan agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, has been executed \nby the borrower and VDB, and the first onlending agreement has been executed by VDB and \nprivate VCs and has been submitted to ADB for review. \n \nV.
