This  technical  assistance  project  has  no  adverse \nAssessment  environmental  impact.  The  ensuing  investment  project  will  be \ncategorized at a later stage. \n   \nProject Description  The  Greater  Mekong  Subregion:  Kunming-Haiphong  Transport \nCorridor\u2500Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway Technical Assistance Project \n(the Project) is to assist the Government in preparing the ensuing \nNoi Bai-Lao Cai Highway Project. The scope of the Project will \ninclude: (i) detailed engineering design, (ii) updated economic and \nfinancial  studies,  (iii)  social  and  environmental  studies,  and \n(iv) procurement  assistance  for  civil  works  and  construction \nsupervision consulting services for the ensuing highway project. \n   \nRationale  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economy  has  grown  over  the  past  decade  by  an \naverage  7\u20138%  per  annum.  Based  on  the  Government\u2019s \nforthcoming Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) for 2006 \nto 2010, this rate of growth is projected to continue. Among the \nmost important consequences of this soundly based and steady \ngrowth is a dramatic reduction in the country\u2019s poverty rate, from \n53% in 1993 to 25% in 2005. The SEDP estimates that the rate will \nfall to 15\u201316% by 2010. However, Viet Nam will need to invest \nabout 35% of gross domestic product (GDP) to achieve this, and \nbasic  economic  infrastructure  will  receive  a  large  share. \nInfrastructure bottlenecks are becoming apparent, especially in the \ntransport and energy sectors. These will need to be addressed \nquickly if growth and consequent poverty reduction targets are to \nbe  met.  The  proposed  Project  will  assist  the  Government  in \npreparing one of its highest priority infrastructure investments\u2014a \nmodern standard road link from Hanoi to connect at Lao Cai with \nthe road network of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). This \nlink will serve two purposes. At the national level, it will connect the \nnorthwest region of the country, now very poor and isolated, with \nthe economic centers that have developed around Hanoi and its \nport,  Haiphong.  At  the  regional  level,  it  will  link  the  rapidly-\nexpanding economy of PRC\u2019s Yunnan province with Hanoi and \nHaiphong, facilitating rapid expansion of cross-border trade and \ncommerce. \n   ", "ii   \nImpact and Outcome  The  proposed  highway  will  contribute  significantly  to  the \ndevelopment  of  the  poor  northwest  region  of  the  country,  by \nimproving national and regional transport linkages. It will also help \nreduce  poverty  levels  in  this  region.  The  Project  will  facilitate \nachieving these objectives by providing the resources required to \nensure that the highway is: (i) designed to the highest technical \nstandards, (ii) cost-effective, and (iii) takes into account the unique \nenvironmental and social characteristics of the region it will pass \nthrough and impact significantly.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The project cost is estimated at $8 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of \n$6 million  equivalent  (75%)  and  the  Government  will  finance \n$2 million equivalent (25%). \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $6 million equivalent, \ndenominated  in  Special  Drawing  Rights,  from  its  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF). The loan will have a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an interest charge of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, \nand such other terms and conditions as are set forth in the draft \nLoan Agreement. \n   \nAllocation and  The Borrower will transfer the loan proceeds from the Government \nRelending Terms  to the Implementing Agency through budgetary allocation. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  2 years \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Executing Agency will be the Ministry of Transport (MOT), and \nthe  Implementing  Agency  will  be  the  Vietnam  Expressway \nCorporation (VEC). \n   \nImplementation  MOT will have overall responsibility for project implementation, and \nArrangements  formal correspondence with line ministries, the governments of the \nprovinces through which the highway will pass, and ADB. VEC will \nbe responsible for day-to-day project implementation under MOT\u2019s \nsupervision. VEC will set up a project implementation unit headed \nby an experienced project director and suitable staff.  \n   \nProcurement  Equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement (2004). \n   ", "  iii\nConsulting Services  An international consulting firm will be recruited using quality and \ncost-based  selection  procedures,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2005)  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. About 90 person-months of international consultants \nand 240 person-months of domestic consultants will be required. \nThe consultants will have expertise in project management, design \nof  high  standard  highways,  road  safety,  transport  economics, \nfinancial analysis, environmental impact assessment, resettlement \nplanning, social development (including indigenous peoples), and \nprocurement assistance. The duration of the consulting services \nwill be about 15 months. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The proposed highway, to be constructed based on the outputs of \nBeneficiaries  the  Project,  will  support  Viet  Nam\u2019s  poverty  reduction  program \nthrough enhanced economic growth and by providing access for \ncurrently isolated communities to economic and social services. It \nwill  also  contribute  to  the  efficient  development  of  the  Greater \nMekong Subregion by strengthening connectivity with neighboring \ncountries and increasing competitiveness. The Project will produce \ndirect  benefits  such  as:  (i)  preparing  the  subsequent  highway \nproject  to  high  technical  and  safeguards  standards; \n(ii) implementing the ensuing project without unnecessary delay; \nand  (iii)  substantially  improving  VEC\u2019s  capability  for  project \nmanagement,  detailed  design  of  highways,  procurement,  and \nsafeguard arrangements.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The main risk for the Project is delayed implementation because of \nslow finalization of the single consulting services contract, which \nwill  implement  the  Project.  This  is  being  addressed  through \nadvance procurement action for the Project\u2019s consulting services, \nand by providing MOT and VEC with specialist support for the \nconsultant selection process. \n   \n \n ", " ", " \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS): Kunming-\nHaiphong Transport Corridor\u2500Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway Technical Assistance (TA) Project (the \nProject). \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  The proposed Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway is an integral section of the GMS North-South \nEconomic Corridor, connecting Kunming in Yunnan province of the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC)  with  Hanoi  and  Haiphong  port  in  Viet  Nam.  In  Yunnan,  the  400-kilometer  (km) \nexpressway from Kunming to the border with Viet Nam will be completed in 2008. However, in \nViet Nam, most of the existing Hanoi-Lao Cai highway is narrow, contains a large number of \nbridges with limited capacity, and there is substantial ribbon development on most of its length. \nThese factors severely limit its capacity and reduce the possibility of improving it to cater for the \nprojected growth in traffic demand in the corridor. The section of the highway from Noi Bai to \nHanoi and Haiphong has been improved under assistance from other external donor agencies. \nSo, only the Noi Bai-Lao Cai section needs to be upgraded to complete the Kunming-Haiphong \nTransport  Corridor.  The  project  feasibility  study  confirmed  the  necessity  and  viability  of  a \nmodern highway linking the existing highway network around Hanoi, at Noi Boi, with the border \ncrossing at Lao Cai, covering about 260 km.1 The Project will build on the work undertaken in \nthat study and will prepare a subsequent project, suitable for Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfunding, to construct the highway. A design and monitoring framework for the Project is in \nAppendix 1. \n \n3.  The total project cost for the highway is estimated at about $620 million. Such a large-\nscale  infrastructure  project\u2014involving  substantial  investment  and  social  and  environmental \nimpacts\u2014requires  detailed  design  study,  detailed  economic  and  financial  analyses,  and \nsafeguard arrangements. The proposed Project will provide the resources to undertake these \nstudies and prepare the subsequent investment project. \n  \n4.  The Vietnam Expressway Corporation (VEC) will play a critical role in preparing and \nimplementing the Project, and will participate in the subsequent investment project. VEC was \nestablished in October 2004 as a state-owned enterprise under the Ministry of Transport (MOT). \nVEC  manages  expressway-related  businesses,  including:  (i)  technical  consultancy  on  the \ndevelopment  of  national  expressway  networks,  and  feasibility  study  and  design  of  each \nexpressway  project;  (ii)  investment  and  project  management  for  expressway  construction; \n(iii) operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  expressways;  and  (iv)  commercial  services  for \nexpressway  users.  To  date,  it  has  little  experience  in  project  management,  financial \nmanagement, procurement, and safeguard issues. Institutional capacity building through the \nProject will enable VEC to manage this and similar projects in the future. \n \n                                                 \n1 A preliminary economic and financial study for the highway project was carried out under the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). 2002. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Kunming-Haiphong \nTransport Corridor Project. Manila (TA 4050-VIE). It appeared that overall economic internal rate of return for the \nProject is 22.0% and financial internal rate of return for the Project is 8.7%, assuming that the toll rate for the \nhighway is double the current toll rate. Details are shown in Appendix 3.  ", "2 \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n5.  The proposed highway will cross Hanoi, Pho Tho, Vinh Phuc, Yen Bai, and Lao Cai \nprovinces. Together, these provinces have a population of about 13.3 million\u2014about 17% of the \ntotal population of Viet Nam\u2014and were responsible for about 18% of gross domestic product \n(GDP)  in  2003.  Per  capita  GDP  is  $1,011  in  Hanoi,  but  only  $361  in  Pho  Tho,  $254  in \nVinh Phuc, $210 in Yen Bai, and $198 in Lao Cai provinces. \n \n6.  The proposed highway will reduce the travel time between Hanoi and Lao Cai from at \nleast  10  hours  at  present,  to  about  3  hours.  This  decrease  in  travel  time  will  encourage \neconomic activities in the affected provinces, provide employment opportunities for the local \npopulation, and improve access to social services. Many ethnic minority groups live in Yen Bai \nand Lao Cai provinces. Most live below the poverty line, mainly due to poor accessibility to \neconomic opportunities, and education and health services. This is largely caused by poor road \ninfrastructure, particularly on the right bank of the Red River, since the existing highway travels \nalong the left bank and there is very little cross-river traffic. The proposed highway will be \nlocated on the right bank because the terrain is easier and it will provide an immediate and \nsignificant benefit to communities in this area that have never had good road access.      \n \n7.  In the context of the GMS and regional integration, economic cooperation between \nViet Nam and the PRC has developed since the late 1990s. The trade volume between the \ncountries has increased more than three times, from $1.3 billion in 1999 to $4.6 billion in 2003.2 \nImports from the PRC grew by 47.9% (2002\u20132003) while exports to the PRC grew by 30.5%. \nYunnan province is a major producer of tobacco, minerals, steel, and fertilizer. Viet Nam, on the \nother hand, excels in producing vegetables, fruits, seafood, crude oil, rubber, minerals, and light \nindustrial goods (such as textiles and footwear). So, Yunnan province and Viet Nam have a \ncomplementary  economic  relationship  through  their  border  trade.  The  total  trade  value \nregistered at the Hekou-Lao Cai border crossing points expanded by 36% in 2003 and 51% in \n2004 to $336 million,3 which accounts for 80% of Yunnan-Viet Nam trade and 10% of PRC-\nViet Nam trade in 2004. Almost 1 million tons of cargo is transported annually across the \nHekou-Lao Cai border crossing points. Arrangements for initial implementation of the GMS \nCross-Border Transport Agreement at the Hekou-Lao Cai border crossing points have been \nfinalized; this is expected to be signed by the two governments in early 2006 and commence by \n30 June 2006. In addition, agreement has been reached by the two governments to consider, at \nthe  earliest  possible  time,  expanding  the  scope  of  the  existing  bilateral  road  transport \nagreement  to  include  the  entire  Kunming-Hanoi-Haiphong  transport  corridor  as  an  interim \nmeasure  until  the  relevant  annexes  and  protocols  of  the  GMS  Cross-Border  Transport \nAgreement are ratified. This will facilitate the exchange of commercial traffic rights along the \ncorridor, which would reduce the incidence of costly and time-consuming transshipment at the \nHekou-Lao Cai border crossing points. \n \n8.  The passage of containerized freight is particularly important for the trading relationship. \nForwarders of overseas container cargos in Kunming do not currently use the Kunming-Hekou-\nLao Cai-Hanoi-Haiphong route, partly because of the poor condition of the Lao Cai-Hanoi \nsection in Viet Nam, inefficient custom control procedures at the Hekou-Lao Cai border, and the \ncost of transshipping containers at the border crossing. Instead, they send container cargos by \nrail or road to ports in Guangzhou province (PRC), which takes up to 6 days.

", "3 \nBai-Lao Cai Highway will allow forwarders in Kunming to reach Haiphong port, a large container \nfacility, in 1 day. Once the proposed Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway has been completed, and the \nADB-supported border crossing operation is streamlined,4 a substantial number of containers \noriginating in Kunming could be diverted to the Kunming-Haiphong route. Viet Nam would \nbenefit from this, through transit and port fees, among others.  \n \n9.  The Government is planning to expand the expressway and modern highway network \nthroughout Viet Nam, in line with the outline of the expressway master plan (EMP).5  Appendix 2 \ncontains analysis of the road subsector, focusing on expressways. VEC is responsible for the \ndevelopment of the expressway network, partly funded by revenues from expressway tolls.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n10.  Viet Nam\u2019s economy has grown at 7\u20138% per annum over the past decade, and the \nGovernment estimates that it will continue, as reflected in the forthcoming Five-Year Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010.6 While this growth has had a dramatic impact \non the country\u2019s poverty rate, which declined from about 59% in 1993 to an estimated 25% in \n2005, it has severely strained the capacity of basic economic infrastructure, particularly power \nand transportation systems. The feasibility study of the Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway Project has \nfound that traffic is growing at about twice the rate of GDP and that this high growth rate is likely \nto continue beyond 2020, reflecting Viet Nam\u2019s very low level of vehicle ownership. 7 Major \noutputs of the feasibility study are in Appendix 3. \n \n  1.  The Government\u2019s Strategy \n \n11.  The Government is acutely aware of the impact of inadequate infrastructure on growth \nand poverty reduction. It is beginning to see the adverse impact of infrastructure bottlenecks on \nforeign investment and its desire to spread development more equitably with areas far from the \nmajor urban centers (Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang, etc.). The Government is taking a dual \napproach  to  the  road  sector:  (i)  developing  a  network  of  high-capacity  expressways  and \nhighways linking the main urban areas with (a) each other, (b) less-developed regions of the \ncountry and, (c) neighboring countries; and (ii) developing the institutions required to plan, \ndesign,  implement,  and  manage  this  network.  MOT  is  responsible  for  implementing  this \nprogram. To date, it has developed a preliminary outline for the network and established VEC to \noversee its further development and implementation. \n \n12.  The existing national road system was mainly constructed with two lanes and a small \npart with four lanes. Traffic management is rudimentary and the rate of traffic accidents is very \nhigh. Government studies have indicated that the main national highway network should be \nwidened and new highways built to connect important economic zones, large urban centers and \nindustrial zones, and international borders. Reflecting this need, the Government has directed \nMOT to prepare the EMP (para. 9). Its basic outline (all that exists at present) provides for \n2 north-south expressways, 6 east-west expressways, and 14 outer urban circular expressways. \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1999.

Lessons Learned \n \n13.  Viet  Nam  Country  Portfolio  Review  Missions  have  noted  that  there  have  been \nimplementation delays in previous road projects, in particular during the project start-up phase. \nProject designs have required that project supervision consultants prepare detailed designs and \nbidding documents for civil works, meaning that the initial 1\u20133 years of the loan period are \ndevoted  to  these  essential  but  low-disbursement  activities.  The  bulk  of  the  loan  remains \nundisbursed during this period, which causes the Government to incur substantial commitment \nand other financing costs, especially for ordinary capital resources loans. Delays in recruiting \nconsultants or preparing detailed designs have led directly to delays in award of civil works, \nexacerbating the situation. This is addressed in the design of the Project by: (i) using advance \naction for the selection of consultants, and (ii) incorporating all safeguard-related planning and \nprocurement-related  activities  (for  the  subsequent  investment  project)  in  the  scope  of  the \nProject. By the time the investment project loan has been processed and become effective (or \nthe Government has found other means to finance the highway\u2019s construction), land acquisition \nand resettlement should be ready for physical action, and all civil works and consulting services \ncontracts will be ready for award. \n \n  3.  ADB\u2019s Strategy \n \n14.  In ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008) approved in August 2005, \nkey development challenges for the next 5 years include the following: (i) sustain high economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction; (ii) create jobs for new labor market entrants; (iii) reduce inequity \nthrough targeted poverty reduction; (iv) support social development by improving health and \neducation services, gender equality, and social inclusion; (v) protect the environment; and \n(vi) improve governance to ensure these challenges are sufficiently and efficiently addressed. \nViet Nam has contributed significantly to enhancing connectivity, increasing competitiveness, \nand promoting a greater sense of community in the GMS. The subsequent highway project is \nfully supportive of this strategy, at both national and regional levels. The Project is also in the \nlending pipeline of the Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008)8 as it \nforms a high-priority section of the Kunming-Hanoi-Haiphong transport route of the GMS North-\nSouth Economic Corridor.    \n \n  4.  External Assistance \n \n15.  Since lifting the embargo on external financing in 1993, there have been many projects \nsupporting the road subsector in Viet Nam (Appendix 4). Initially, these projects focused on \nrehabilitating National Highway 1, which runs along the east coast of Viet Nam and acts as the \ncentral spine for the road network.9 Subsequently, integral parts of the GMS economic corridors \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005.

ADB\u2019s  Provincial  Roads  Improvement  Project  is  upgrading  provincial  roads  in \n17 provinces in the northern uplands and Red River Delta regions.11 The upgrading of rural \nroads in 18 provinces was addressed under ADB\u2019s Rural Infrastructure Sector Project,12 and \nrural roads are being improved in 40 provinces across the country with funding from the World \nBank and the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) under the \nRural Transport II project.13 ADB is currently processing the Central Region Transport Networks \nImprovement  Sector  Project,  which  will  address  the  removal  of  transport  constraints  on \neconomic and social development in the rural areas of 19 provinces in central Viet Nam.14 \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  Construction of the Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway will be based on the outputs of the Project. \nThe  current  travel  time  between  Kunming  and  Haiphong  is  more  than  2  days.  Transport \nbetween Kunming and Haiphong will be 1 day upon completion of the highway. Due to the \nsubstantial reduction in travel time and much improved transport conditions, industries clustered \naround Hanoi and Haiphong will be able to expand to the very poor northwest of the country, \nbringing employment, better access to social services, and other benefits. In addition, some of \nthe freight transport in Yunnan province which is currently moving to ports in the PRC could be \ndiverted to Haiphong port. Viet Nam\u2019s ability to export agricultural and maritime products to \nYunnan province, already a rapidly growing trade, will also be substantially enhanced.   \n \nB.  Outputs \n17.  The  feasibility  study  for  the  subsequent  highway  project  (footnote  1)  confirmed  its \neconomic and financial viability. The Project will provide the Government with preparatory work \nfor the highway project. The scope of the Project will include: (i) detailed engineering design; (ii) \nupdated economic and financial studies based on the detailed engineering designs and costs; \n(iii) social and environmental studies, including environmental impact assessment (EIA), and \nresettlement and ethnic minority development plans; and (iv) procurement assistance for civil \nworks and construction supervision consulting services required for the subsequent highway \nproject, so that related contracts will be ready for award when project loans become effective. \nProcurement will be undertaken in line with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998), Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2005), and Guidelines for Procurement (2004).

Special Features \n18.  The proposed highway will pass through two quite different geographical and social \nenvironments. Closer to Hanoi, between Noi Bai and Yen Bai (about 120 km), the terrain is flat \nto rolling, traffic volume is high and growing quickly, population density is relatively high, and the \nproportion of ethnic minorities is low. From Yen Bai to Lao Cai (about 140 km), the terrain \nchanges from rolling to mountainous, existing and projected traffic is relatively low, population \ndensity is very low (particularly on the right bank of the Red River where the highway will be \nlocated), and the proportion of ethnic minorities is very high. The configuration of the proposed \nhighway, to be reflected in its detailed technical designs and subsequent operation, will reflect \nthese differences. Briefly, the Noi Bai-Yen Bai section will be designed as a high standard dual \ncarriageway facility, with grade-separated interchanges\u2014in essence, an expressway. It will be \ntolled as a closed system, with tolls being used for O&M and debt service for the entire facility. It \nwill be constructed with four traffic lanes initially, with provision for two additional lanes at a later \ndate (when justified by the growth in traffic). The Yen Bai-Lao Cai section, on the other hand, \nwill be constructed initially to a much simpler configuration, essentially as a two-lane single \ncarriageway rural highway, with at-grade intersections and an open barrier tolling system that \nwill allow local traffic to use the road without payment; only traffic passing through the Yen Bai-\nLao Cai section will pay. However, the design of this section will include provision for a second \ncarriageway and grade separation, if traffic volumes increase to require additional capacity. \nBased on the feasibility study (Appendix 3), it is unlikely that this would occur for at least 10 \nyears after the opening of the initial two-lane facility. To ensure maximum utilization of both \nsections of the highway and maximum distribution of its benefits, the Project will include the \ndevelopment of linkages to the existing road network\u2014in particular to the existing highway \nbetween Noi Bai and Lao Cai located on the opposite bank of the Red River. Bridges will be \nbuilt over the Red River to connect to the existing highways.  \n \n19.  The highway will require a six-lane structure for the Noi Bai-Yen Bai section and a four-\nlane structure for the Yen Bai-Lao Cai section, in about 10\u201320 years. Right-of-way for the \nhighway will be acquired based on these lane configurations. The detailed design work to be \nundertaken under the Project will determine the positions of these additional lanes and related \nstructures to: (i) ensure that the highway\u2019s subsequent expansion can be undertaken with as \nlittle impact as possible on the highway in service and the traffic using it, and (ii) define the land \nacquisition boundaries for the ultimate configuration. \n \n20.  In April 2004, the governments of the six GMS countries reached agreement on the \nRoad  and  Bridge  Design  and  Construction  Standards  and  Specifications  (GMS  Highway \nStandards), Annex 11 of the GMS Cross-Border Transport Agreement. In principle, the highway \nwill be designed to GMS Highway Standards. Detailed design and technical specifications will \nbe formulated through the detailed design study and technical coordination meetings between \nViet Nam and the PRC. Access-controlled highways that provide appropriate modality of long-\ndistance traffic and restrict accessibility of local people along highways are necessary for safe \nroad transport if vehicle ownership rises at twice the rate of per capita GDP in Viet Nam (para. \n10).  A  road  safety  audit  will  be  carried  out  to  identify  accident-prone  areas  and  propose \nadequate road safety improvement measurements for access roads to existing roads. The \npercentage of motorcycles in traffic volume is very high for the following sections of the existing \nroad: Hanoi-Viet (25%), Viet Tri-Yen Bai (33%), and Yen Bai-Lao Cai (44%) (footnote 7). Due to \ntraffic safety and efficiency, a modal mix between motorcycles and non-motorcycle traffic should ", "7 \nbe avoided on the highway. The detailed design study will determine the most appropriate lane \nconfiguration and traffic regulations for motorcycle traffic. \n \n21.  The highway\u2019s construction will involve large excavation, acquisition of residential and \nagricultural  lands,  and  some  resettlement  of  project-affected  people,  although  the  final \nalignment will be developed to ensure that resettlement is kept to a minimum, as required by \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). In addition, the highway will pass through \nareas that have a high proportion of ethnic minorities. Since the social and environmental \nimpacts of the highway\u2019s construction are likely to be significant, the following reports will be \nprepared as part of the Project\u2019s scope, in accordance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies: (i) an EIA, \n(ii) a full resettlement plan (RP), and (iii) an ethnic minority development plan (EMDP). The \nhighway  project  may  increase  the  exposure  of  local  population  to  HIV/AIDS15 during  the \nconstruction and post-construction periods. The social assessment will include information on \nthe present HIV/AIDS and human trafficking situation, as well as the potential increase in \nHIV/AIDS cases and human trafficking in the project area, including the border area. The EMDP \nand gender strategy will also include prevention and mitigation measures. Details on the social \nassessment  and  gender  strategy  included  in  the  Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social \nStrategy are in Appendix 5. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n22.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $8.0 million equivalent, including the cost of \nconsulting  services,  equipment,  incremental  administration,  interest  during  implementation, \ntaxes, and contingencies. Cost estimates are shown in Table 1 and details are in Appendix 6. \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($\u2018000) \n \nItem  Foreign  Local  Total  Percentage \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n         \nA.

Financing Plan \n23.  The Project\u2019s financing plan is shown in Table 2 and details are in Appendix 6.16 ADB \nwill provide a loan of $6 million equivalent (75% of the total cost), and the Government will \nfinance $2 million equivalent (25% of the total cost) comprising 25% of the consulting services \ncost, 30% of the equipment and the incremental administration cost, and all taxes. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($\u2018000) \n \nItem  Foreign  Local  Total  Percentage \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n         \nAsian Development Bank  2,945.0  3,055.0  6,000.0     75.00 \nGovernment  105.0  1,895.0  2,000.0     25.00 \n         \n        Total  3,050.0  4,950.0  8,000.0  100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n24.  The  loan  will  be  denominated  in  special  drawing  rights  (SDR)  from  ADB\u2019s  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) Special Funds resources, with a term of 32 years including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter. The Borrower for the Project will be the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. The \nMinistry of Finance will be responsible for repayment of the loan and will provide counterpart \nfunds to MOT through budgetary allocations. MOT will provide the loan and the counterpart \nfunds to VEC through budgetary allocations. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n25.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the Project will be MOT and the Implementing Agency \n(IA) will be VEC. MOT will have overall responsibility for project implementation and formal \ncorrespondence  with  the  line  ministries,  provincial  governments,  and  ADB.  VEC  will  have \nresponsibility for day-to-day project implementation under MOT\u2019s supervision. VEC will set up a \nproject implementation unit (PIU) headed by an experienced project director and suitable staff. \nThe project management structure is in Appendix 7. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n26.  The overall implementation schedule for the Project is in Appendix 8. This illustrates the \nlinkages between the Project and the subsequent highway project. Consultant recruitment will \nstart in January 2006. Implementation of the Project will commence by July 2006 and be \ncompleted before September 2007. Construction of the highway should commence in late 2007 \nand be completed by the end of 2010, subject to: (i) the outcome of the Project, (ii) ADB\u2019s \napproval of a subsequent highway project, and (iii) completion of procurement, land acquisition \nand resettlement, and other pre-construction activities.   \n \n                                                 \n16 The allocation of loan proceeds in the Loan Agreement will be presented in the equivalent of SDR 4,209,000, with \nreference only to total expenditure, in accordance with the policy on Cost Sharing and Eligibility of Expenditures for \nAsian Development Bank Financing: A New Approach. ", "9 \n3.  Procurement \n27.  The Project will not require civil works procurement. Procurement of equipment will be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement (2004). Since the items \nrequired will be small and few in number\u2014mainly vehicles, computers, design software and \nequipment,  testing  and  survey  equipment,  and  similar  items\u2014procurement  will  follow  local \ncompetitive bidding or direct purchase procedures. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n28.  The  consulting  services  will  be  implemented  by  an  international  consulting  firm  in \nassociation  with  domestic  consultants.  The  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  project \nmanagement, design of high standard highways, road safety, road traffic information system, \ntransport  economics,  financial  analysis,  EIA,  resettlement  planning,  social  development \n(including indigenous peoples), and procurement assistance. Outline terms of reference are in \nAppendix  9.  The  consulting  services  will  include  amounts  for  surveys  of  all  types,  aerial \nphotography,  equipment,  and  other  inputs  essential  for  effective  and  timely  project \nimplementation. The duration of the consulting services will be about 15 months, although much \nof the last portion of this period will be for procurement assistance and will require relatively few \ninputs. The bulk of consulting services inputs and related expenditure will be during the initial \n9 months of the project period. \n \n29.  VEC will recruit an international consulting firm for the consulting services using quality \nand cost-based selection procedures, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2005),  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of \ndomestic consultants. Full technical proposals will be used. The contract package is described \nin Appendix 10.   \n \n5.   Anticorruption  \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the Government of Viet \nNam, MOT, and VEC. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the Loan Regulations \nand bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection \nwith the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the \nrecords and accounts of the EA, the IA, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n31.  Loan disbursement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2001), and detailed arrangements between the Government and ADB. The loan proceeds will \nbe  disbursed  directly  to  the  consultants,  based  on  an  approved  contract  under  the  direct \npayment procedure. Payments for equipment and the incremental administration cost will be \nmade from an imprest account held at a commercial bank acceptable to the Government and \nADB,  under  ADB\u2019s  imprest  account  procedure  as  shown  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2001).  The  initial  deposit  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  based  on  estimated \nexpenditures for the first 6 months of the project implementation or $300,000, whichever is \nlower. The statement of expenditure procedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures \n ", "10 \nand liquidate advances to the imprest account to facilitate project implementation. The ceiling \nfor each payment under the statement of expenditure procedure is $50,000. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n32.  MOT will ensure that VEC maintains separate financial records and accounts adequate \nto identify financing resources received and project expenditures, including goods, works, and \nservices financed out of the loan proceeds and local funds. The loan accounts and related \nfinancial statements will be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by an \nauditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  MOT  will  submit  annual  audited  reports  and  related  financial \nstatements to ADB within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n33.  VEC will have responsibility for day-to-day project implementation and managing the \nconsulting services,  including  timely  submission  of  reports  through  the  consultant\u2019s  project \nmanager.  \n \n9.  Project Review \n34.  ADB will conduct at least three defined review missions, and numerous special review \nmissions. First, an inception review will be carried out to address issues that MOT, VEC, and \nthe consultant are encountering and are about to encounter, immediately after the consultant\u2019s \ninception report is submitted. Second, a midterm review, which will also be the Fact-Finding \nMission for the subsequent highway project, will be undertaken to assess overall progress in \nproject implementation and achievements, when reports of the detailed design study, economic \nand financial studies, and social and environmental studies are completed. Third, a project \ncompletion review mission will be fielded about 1 year after project completion. There will also \nbe special reviews as required to address issues that arise during project implementation. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n \n35.  The proposed highway, to be constructed based on the outputs of the Project, will \nsupport Viet Nam\u2019s poverty reduction program through enhanced economic growth and by \nproviding access for currently isolated communities to economic and social services. It will also \ncontribute  to  the  efficient  development  of  the  GMS,  by  strengthening  connectivity  with \nneighboring  countries  and  increasing  competitiveness.  The  highway  will  greatly  facilitate \ntransport between Kunming and Haiphong, and create a new freight transport link between \nYunnan province, Hanoi, and Haiphong port.   \n \n36.  The Project will produce direct benefits such as: (i) preparing the subsequent highway \nproject to high technical and safeguards standards; (ii) implementing the subsequent project \nwithout  unnecessary  delay;  and  (iii)  substantially  improving  VEC\u2019s  capability  for  project \nmanagement, detailed design of highways, procurement, and safeguard arrangements.  \n \n37.  Resettlement for the subsequent highway project could have an adverse impact on the \naffected people, specifically on ethnic minority groups, who are vulnerable to change. The \nproject  activities  could  bring significant social  and  economic  change,  which could  be  both \npositive and negative. Once the highway is completed, HIV/AIDS and trafficking of women and ", "11 \nchildren could become more prevalent. Appropriate prevention and mitigation planning will be \nincorporated in the Project to address issues related to HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. \n \nB.  Project Risks \n \n38.  The main risk for the Project is delayed implementation because of slow finalization of \nthe  single  consulting  services  contract,  which  will  implement  the  Project.  This  is  being \naddressed through advance procurement action for the Project\u2019s consulting services, and by \nproviding MOT and VEC with specialist support for the consultant selection process through \nanother TA project (footnote 5). \n \n39.  During the construction phase, HIV/AIDS risks could increase in the areas around labor \ncamps  and  the  core  project  area.  Short  and  long-term  planning  to  prevent  and  mitigate \nHIV/AIDS during the construction and post-construction periods will be incorporated in the \nProject. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n40.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  MOT will cause VEC to prepare an EIA and a Summary EIA (SEIA) for the \nsubsequent highway project, which will include an environmental management \nplan with adequate public consultation, in accordance with the requirements of \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), and submit them to ADB for approval. MOT \nwill  ensure  that  the  contract  documents  for  the  subsequent  highway  project \ninclude specific measures as indicated in the SEIA and EIA and in accordance \nwith  ADB's  Environment  Policy  to  mitigate  negative  environmental  impacts \ncaused  by  the  construction  and  to  give  due  consideration  to  prevention  of \ndamage to the natural environment in the design, construction, operation, and \nmaintenance of the highway facilities. \n \n(ii)  MOT will cause VEC to prepare an RP for the subsequent highway project in \naccordance with the requirements of ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement \n(1995), and submit the RP to ADB for approval.  \n \n(iii)  MOT will cause VEC to prepare and implement an EMDP for the subsequent \nhighway project if impacts on the ethnic minorities living in the project area are \nsignificant. The determination whether the EMDP is needed and its preparation \nwill be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \n(iv)  During project implementation, MOT will ensure that VEC has in place sound \nfinancial management, financial reporting, internal controls and internal auditing \nsystems acceptable to ADB. \n \n ", "12 \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n41.  The following are conditions for loan effectiveness:  \n \n(i)  the Government approves its internal feasibility study of the Noi Bai-Lao Cai \nHighway Project in accordance with Government regulations; and  \n \n(ii)  VEC has completed the establishment of the PIU headed by an experienced \ndirector and suitably staffed.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n42.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 4,209,000 to the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Greater Mekong Subregion: Kunming-Haiphong Transport \nCorridor\u2500Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway Technical Assistance Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such \nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nLoan and Project Agreements presented to the Board.  \n \n \n \nJoseph B.

Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in Viet Nam increased to $482.6 in 2003 from \n$374.5 in 1999, at an average growth rate of 6.5%. The industry and construction sector \naccounts for 40.0% of GDP and is the most rapidly developed sector, growing by 17.3% in 2003. \nIn the Northern Economic Triangle Area\u2014including Hanoi, Hai Duong, Haiphong, and Quang \nNinh provinces\u2014heavy industries (e.g., steel and shipbuilding) and light industries (e.g., textiles, \nfootwear, machinery, and wooden products) are developed. The main driving forces behind the \nrapid growth are domestic private companies and foreign-invested companies in export-oriented \nbusinesses. The service sector, accounting for about 38.2% of GDP, grew by 12.3% in 2003. \nThis  growth  was  mainly  driven  by  wholesale,  retail,  transport,  and  postal  services,  which \naccompany improved living standards, especially in large cities. The tourism industry is also \nbeing developed by easing visa requirements for foreign tourists. The agriculture, forestry, and \nfisheries sectors, accounting for about 21.8% of GDP, grew by 7.1% in 2003, largely due to \nhigher  export  prices.  Overall,  this  sector  has  an  international  comparative  advantage  in \nViet Nam.  To  continue  stable  and  strong  economic  growth,  a  high-standard  road  network \nconnecting cities and linking with neighboring countries and ports must be developed.  \n \n2.  Table A2.1 shows the estimated number of vehicles registered in the project area, based \non data from the Viet Nam Registration and National Transport Safety Committee. Ownership of \nvehicles (including trucks) in the project area has sharply increased at a much higher rate than \nGDP growth. Elasticity of the growth rate of car ownership in the project area with respect to per \ncapita GDP is 3\u20137, except in the case of coach/bus in 2002. \n \nTable A2.1: Estimated Number of Vehicle Registered in the Project Area \n \nType of \nItem  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004 \nVehicle \nNumber of vehicles  16,069 20,151 28,674 36,305 48,424  60,358\nCar \nGrowth rate  25% 42% 27% 33%  25%\nNumber of vehicles    4,582   5,469   9,219   7,068 13,307  15,345\nCoach/bus \nGrowth rate  19% 69% (23%) 88%  15%\nNumber of vehicles  15,327 18,245 34,661 42,333 54,396  62,159\nTruck \nGrowth rate  19% 90% 22% 28%  14%\n  Sources: Viet Nam Registration and survey by Asian Development Bank.  \n \n3.

Road Safety \n \n4.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and development partners have provided financial \nassistance to the road sector in Viet Nam, and the national road network has been improved. \nHowever, the number of fatalities from traffic accidents has increased rapidly since 2000 and \nreached 13,000 in 2003. The major causes of traffic accidents on the improved roads are \nspeeding and recklessness of drivers and motorcyclists, as well as local people\u2019s unchanged \nroad use. Also, the mixture of different vehicle types in road traffic is cause of the lack of road \nsafety and inefficient road traffic management. The Government established an interministerial \nNational Traffic Safety Program to address road safety initiatives and allocate roles and budget \nto  each  ministry  concerned.  It  is  also  promoting  traffic  enforcement,  a  road  traffic  safety \ncampaign, and regulation on the sale and use of motorcycles to reduce traffic accidents, but \nthere  have  been  no  tangible  effects  to  date.1 Full  access-controlled  highways  (essentially \nexpressways) that provide high modality of long-distance traffic and restrict accessibility of local \npeople to the highways are necessary for safe road transport if vehicle ownership rises at twice \nthe expected rate of economic growth and income increase in Viet Nam. \n \nC.  Expressway Master Plan \n \n5.  The existing national road system was mainly constructed with two lanes, and a small \npart  with  four  lanes.  According  to  the  government  traffic  estimate,  which  the  transport \ndevelopment strategy until 2020 was based on, traffic jams are inevitable on main national \nroads. To support sustainable economic development, these roads should be widened or new \nroadways constructed to connect with important economic zones, large urban centers, industrial \nzones, and international borders. The Government assigned the Ministry of Transport (MOT) to \nprepare a master plan for development of the expressway network. The basic outline of the \nexpressway  master  plan  (EMP)  proposes  2  north-south  expressway  axes,  6  east-west \nexpressway axes, and 14 centripetal expressway axes. To complete development of EMP, MOT \nneeds to improve its knowledge of planning expressway networks and construction, institutional \ndevelopment, financial mobilization and debt management, and operation and maintenance \n(O&M) from other countries.  \n \n6.  In the draft EMP, a 1,346-km expressway will be constructed during the first stage \n(2005\u20132015) and a 1,357-km expressway during the second stage (2016\u20132025). The Noi Bai-\nLao Cai Highway\u2014part of this network\u2014is planned in the first stage. The capital investment \nrequirement  for  construction  of  the  planned  expressway  network  is  D205,767  billion \n($13 billion): D111,012 billion ($7 billion) for the first stage and D94,755 billion ($6 billion) for the \nsecond stage. The estimated construction cost per year is about $600 million\u2013$700 million.     \n \n7.  ADB  will  provide  MOT  with  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  on  the  Expressway \nNetwork Development Plan Project.2 The TA comprises development of a business plan for the \nVietnam Expressway Corporation (VEC), the EMP, and public-private partnership. The EMP \ncomponent  will  include  developing  proposals  for:  (i)  policy  and  criteria  for  expressway \nconstruction;  (ii)  route  (origin-destination);  (iii)  priority  (2006\u20132015,  2016\u20132025,  and  2025 \nonwards); (iv) technical specifications; (v) road services and administrative facilities; (vi) cost \nestimates at pre-feasibility level (construction, land acquisition and resettlement, and O&M); (vii) \n                                                 \n1  Japan Bank for International Cooperation. 2003.

Vietnam Expressway Corporation \n \n8.  In October 2004, VEC was established as a state-owned enterprise under MOT. VEC \nbusiness lines include:  \n \n(i)  investment, construction project management, maintenance, and toll collection of the \nnational expressways; \n(ii)  developing and trading in such services as rest houses, restaurants, gas stations, \nadvertisements, and construction materials along expressways; \n(iii)  technical  consultancy  on  transportation  and  communication,  such  as  study  of  the  \ndevelopment of national expressway networks, and feasibility study and design of \neach expressway project; and  \n(iv)  study and development of service forms in areas adjacent to expressways.   \n \n9.  The Ministry of Finance provided VEC with equity amounting to D1,000 billion ($63 \nmillion) in the form of: (i) transfer of D50 billion ($3 million) from the state budget to VEC\u2019s \naccount, and (ii) selling toll fee collection right at Gie Bridge and Phu Dong toll plazas during the \n10-year period after 1 January 2005, amounting to D950 billion ($60 million). With 60 employees \n(as of May 2005), VEC has established financing and accounting, planning and business, \nproject technical, and administration divisions. VEC\u2019s first expressway project (Cau Gie-Nin \nBinh) has a total project cost of D5,422 billion ($341 million). VEC financed this project by using \nall  its  equity  ($63  million)  and  issuing  a  government-guaranteed  bond  amounting  to \nD4,422 billion ($278 million).3 Since all VEC\u2019s equity will be spent on the first expressway \nproject, it has to request additional equity from the Government for subsequent expressway \nprojects to secure its financial sustainability. To generate funds for investment in expressway \nprojects, VEC issues a government-guaranteed bond and wishes to receive loans from donor \norganizations. However, VEC has yet to secure the budget for expressway construction and \ncomplete its business model, which ensures financially sustainable expressway projects. \n \n10.  The business model development component under the TA on Expressway Network \nDevelopment Plan Project, will review the: (i) government policies, laws, regulations, decrees, \ncirculars, and charters relevant to VEC; (ii) current organizational structure of VEC, with due \nconsideration  given  to  role  and  responsibilities  of  each  department  and  division  of  VEC, \nsegregation of duty, staffing, etc.; and (iii) VEC\u2019s future organizational development plan. With \nthe objectives of promoting institutional efficiency and good governance in VEC\u2014especially \nregarding financial management, accounting system, and auditing\u2014the study will recommend: \n(i) necessary reforms of the legal and regulatory frameworks; and (ii) appropriate institutional \nsetup, including mission, objectives, functions of departments and divisions, regional branches, \nand performance specifications and targets. \n \nE.  Toll Setting  \n \n11.  The  current  toll  level  for  national  highways  is  shown  in  Table  A2.3,  based  on  the \nprinciple that toll revenue is used for road maintenance works only. Subject to approval by the \nMinistry of Finance, the toll level for expressways will be set at not more than double the current \ntoll level for general highways, based on a new concept that the toll revenue from expressways \n                                                 \n3  VEC has issued a bond in the amount of $230 million to date, but has not yet received loans from external donor \norganizations. \n ", "18  Appendix 2 \nwill be used for maintenance works, recovery of the capital cost (including interest repayment), \nand expansion of the expressway network. However, it is still unclear whether this toll level can \ncover those expenses. Therefore, the toll level for expressways should be reexamined in the \nlight of financial requirements and toll sensitivity of potential expressway users. \n \nTable A2.3: Current Toll Level for National Highways \n(D per km) \n \nVehicle  Toll  Unit Toll Rate \nMotorbike/Lambretta  10,000     333 \nTourist Car/Jeep  10,000     333 \nSmall Coach (<25 seats)  10,000     333 \nBig Coach (>=25 seats)  15,000     500 \nLight Truck (<2.5 tons)  15,000     500 \nMedium Truck (>=2.5 tons, 2 axles)   22,000     733 \nHeavy Truck (>3 axles)  40,000  1,333 \nContainer  80,000  2,667 \nD = dong, km = kilometer. \nSource: Ministry of Finance. \n \n12.  A survey on the toll sensitivity of road users was carried out under TA 4050-VIE.4 Table \nA2.4 shows percentage of use of the Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway, which will be of expressway \nstandard, under the different toll rates. For the Noi Bai-Yen Bai section where travel time \nreduction is low, elasticity of the percentage of highway use with respect to toll level is high. For \nthe Yen Bai-Lao Cai section where travel time reduction is high, elasticity is low. If the toll level \nfor expressways is set as double the current toll level for general highways, 50% of traffic on the \nexisting roads will be diverted to the expressway for the Noi Bai-Viet Tri section, 60% will be \ndiverted to the Viet Tri-Yen Bai section, and 85% will be diverted to the Yen Bai-Lao Cai section. \nThere is little relevance of the elasticity of the percentage of highway use with respect to the \ndistance reduction. \n \nTable A2.4:  Percentage of Use of the Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway \n \nItem  Noi Bai-Viet Tri  Viet Tri-Yen Bai  Yen Bai-Lao Cai \nSection  Section  Section \nDistance of existing highways  51.0 km  91.0 km  169.0 km \nTravel time of existing highways  1.3 hours  2.3 hours  4.0 hours \nDistance of the highway  53.4 km  64.6 km  138.0 km \nTravel time of the highway  0.5 hours  0.6 hours  1.7 hours \n1.5 times the current toll level  60%  80%  90% \n2 times the current toll level  50%  60%  85% \n3 times the current toll level  30%  50%  80% \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: ADB. 2005.

Considering that the average growth rate of per capita gross domestic product (GDP) \nwas 6.5% in 1999\u20132003, the feasibility study assumed that growth in Viet Nam could average \n5.4% for 2005\u20132015, 5.0% for 2016\u20132025, and 4.0% for 2026\u20132040.

The traffic demand forecast for the Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway consists of: (i) natural \ngrowth traffic, (ii) traffic generated by construction of the highway, and (iii) traffic diverted to the \nKunming-Hanoi-Haiphong route from other routes because of the highway\u2019s construction. The \nnatural growth traffic increases from baseline traffic in 2005 in accordance with the traffic growth \nrate in Table A2.5. The generated traffic is assumed as 15% of the natural growth traffic, based \non the existing study. The major shippers in Kunming, Yunnan province currently use Shenzhen \nand Guangzhou ports in Guangdong province, and Fancheng, Qinzhou, and Beihai ports in \nGuangxi province, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The annual container output to and from \nKunming in 2005 is 213,000 20-foot units. As a result of an interview with the major shippers, \n10% of the container cargos would be diverted to the Kunming-Hanoi-Haiphong route due to \nreduction in the travel distance. Table A3.2 shows the forecast daily traffic volume for the three \nsections of the highway under the assumption that the toll level will be double the current level. \n \nTable A3.2: Traffic Demand Forecast for the Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway \n(passenger car unit per day) \n \nSection  2005  2015  2025  2035 \nNoi Bai-Viet Tri  9,646  28,822  64,091  122,163 \nViet Tri-Yen Bai  6,633  20,420  45,909    88,375 \nYen Bai-Lao Cai     974    3,117    7,075    13,690 \nSource: ADB. 2005.

Based on the above traffic volume \nforecast, lane configuration for the Noi Bai-Viet Tri and Viet Tri-Yen Bai section is initially four \nlanes but expandable to six lanes as traffic increases; and initially two lanes but expandable to \nfour  lanes  for  the  Yen  Bai-Lao  Cai  section.  The  total  project  cost  for  the  initial  highway \nconstruction is estimated at about $620 million, including construction cost, consulting service \ncost, land acquisition and resettlement cost, and physical and price contingencies.  \n \n4.  Economic and financial analysis was undertaken by comparing the with highway project \nand without highway project scenarios. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the \nhighway project is about 22.0%. The net present value of the highway project, using the social \ndiscount rate of 12%, yields $349 million. Table A3.3 summarizes the result of the economic \nsensitivity analysis. Delay in project implementation has the most impact on the economic \nviability. However, even if there is a concurrent 10% increase of project cost, 10% decrease of \n ", "20  Appendix 3 \ntraffic demand, and 1 year delay in project implementation, the EIRR for the highway project is \nhigher  than  12%.  Table  A3.4  summarizes  the  results  of  the  financial  sensitivity  analysis. \nAssuming that 72% of the project cost is funded by ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and other \nloans, and the remaining 28% is funded by the Government of Viet Nam, the weighted average \ncost of capital (WACC) for the highway project is 6.0%. Similar to the economic viability, even if \nthere is a 10% increase in project cost, 10% decrease in traffic demand, and 1 year delay in \nproject implementation, at the same time, the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is still higher \nthan the WACC. The highway project generates enough profit to recover the entire loan within \n14 years. It is concluded that the economic and financial viability of the highway project is \nrobust. \n \nTable A3.3: Economic Sensitivity Analysis \n(%) \n \nItem  EIRR \n1.

As shown in Table A2.4 of Appendix 2, the traffic demand is affected by the toll level. \nFigure A3.1 indicates the impact of the toll level on EIRR and FIRR. The current toll level for \npassenger cars is D1,000 per 30 km. EIRR rapidly declines as the toll increases, and falls below \n12% when the toll level is over four times the current level. The current toll level yields FIRR \nlower than WACC, therefore the highway project is not financially viable. From the financial \nperspective, the toll level of D2,000\u2013D4,000 per 30 km is appropriate and the optimal toll level is \nD3,000 per 30 km. Taking both economic and financial perspectives into account, a range of \nD2,000\u2013D2,500 per 30 km is the best toll level to operate the Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway.  \n ", "  Appendix 3  21 \nFigure A3: Impact of the Toll Level on EIRR and FIRR\n30\nEIRR\n25 Project FIRR\nC\nC\nA Owner FIRR\nW20\nWACC\nd \nn\na\n 15\n,\nR\nR\nI\nF\n 10\n,\nR\nR\nI\nE\n5\n0\n1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000\nToll Level (D per 30 km)\n   \nD = dong, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, km = \nkilometer, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: ADB. 2005.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \n \nViet Nam\u2019s record in poverty reduction has been impressive in the last decade. The proportion of the population below \nthe poverty line has declined from around 59% in 1993 to 25% in 2005. The proposed target for the Five-Year Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 is to reduce poor households to 15%\u201316% by 2010. While significant in \nterms of magnitude, progress in poverty reduction remains fragile, with a significant number of \u201cnear poor\u201d clustered \njust above the poverty line. To support the Government in pursuing balanced economic growth and poverty reduction, \nthe Country Strategy and Program Update 2006\u20132008 for Viet Nam and the Poverty Partnership Agreement between \nViet Nam and ADB emphasize regional cooperation through cross-border trade and access to markets within the \nregion. Viet Nam and Yunnan province in the PRC are experiencing rapid economic growth, centered on exports to \nworld markets, and through increasingly  bilateral trade  in agriculture, aquatic, mining, and industrial products. \nSustained development requires modernization and improvement of physical infrastructure and associated services\u2014\ninfrastructure that accommodates bilateral trade and international transit traffic. The Kunming-Haiphong Corridor is \nrecognized by Viet Nam and the PRC as a strategic asset that enables accelerated economic growth based on \nbilateral trade and transit traffic. The corridor is perceived as a cornerstone in developing the economies in Yunnan \nprovince and northern Viet Nam. The Greater Mekong Subregion: Kunming-Haiphong Transport Corridor\u2013Noi Bai-Lao \nCai Highway Technical Assistance Project (the Project) will help to develop the subregional transport system and \nimprove inter-sectoral linkages through the development of an economic corridor. Remoteness and disconnection \nhave been identified as factors for poor people\u2019s inability to benefit from economic growth. Improved transport \ninfrastructure is critical for sustained rapid economic growth and poverty reduction, and will also contribute to \nregionally balanced and equitable economic growth by stimulating agriculture production, increasing access to \nemployment opportunities, and facilitating better access to social services.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nFollowing ADB\u2019s Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy (December 2004), projects classified as general intervention \nno longer require project level poverty assessments. However, social assessments will be prepared for resettlement, \nethnic minority groups, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking, as they represent significant risks for implementation of the \nProject.  \n \nIn addition to social and economic data related to resettlement plan and an EMDP (Appendix 9), social assessment \ndata will include: (i) the potential impact of the Kunming-Haiphong highway on social change for various ethnic groups \nin the project area, (ii) employment opportunities, (iii) movement of goods, (iv) reduction of transport costs associated \nwith transportation on the provincial road networks, (v) change in family farm production and its potential impact on \nwomen, and (vi) access to social service delivery. Social analysis will include the potential negative impact of \nresettlement on various ethnic groups, risks of HIV/AIDS spreading, and human trafficking. Trafficking of women and \nchildren has become a serious problem since the 1990s. In the provinces located in Red River Delta, trafficking of \nwomen has increased due to a number of road links and commune border with the PRC. Assessment of HIV/AIDS \nand human trafficking will include: (i) the present situation of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking in the project areas; (ii) \ntype and level of vulnerability of the population along the proposed highway to HIV/AIDS and human trafficking \n(disaggregated by gender, ethnicity, age, type of occupation, mobility, etc.); and (iii) recommendation for activities to \nprevent and mitigate the impacts. The social assessment will also: (i) review existing anti-HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking \nprograms of the Government, donors, and nongovernment organizations and recommendation for relevant linkages; \nand (ii) assess the capacity building training needs of relevant agencies for anti-HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking (law \nenforcement authority in the boarder areas). The social assessment will also focus on the environmental issues and \npossible negative impacts on the livelihood of the poor and ethnic minority groups, whose lives largely depend on the \nforest and its products.   \n \nThe core analysis will be prepared from both primary and secondary data. Primary data will be collected from selected \nproject areas through sample survey and participatory appraisal. Secondary data will include existing data such as \ncensus, national socioeconomic surveys, and available HIV/AIDS and human trafficking related data. \n ", "24  Appendix 5 \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?     Yes     No  \n \nDuring the early stage of feasibility study of the Kunming-Haiphong Transport Corridor Project (TA 4050-VIE), \nconsultations were held with ethnic minority groups and various government agencies. During the fact-finding for the \nTA project, discussion was held with the executing agency and stakeholders from other relevant agencies. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nA participatory stakeholder analysis will be an integral part of the economic (distributional assessment), social, \nresettlement, EMDP, and gender analysis. The stakeholder analysis under the economic and social assessments will \nbe both quantitative and qualitative. For land acquisition and resettlement issues, individual and group consultations \nwill be undertaken with affected people at the village, hamlet, and commune level. Separate consultation will be \nundertaken with affected minority groups with regard to resettlement issues. The stakeholder analysis will include \nassessment of human trafficking and HIV/AIDS. The participatory strategy will include a grassroots level mechanism \nfor public information disclosure of compensation and resettlement issues, and grievance procedures for affected \npersons from various ethnic groups. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe socioeconomic data will be disaggregated by gender and various ethnic groups. Data on resettlement and ethnic \nminority groups and data on HIV/AIDS and human trafficking will be disaggregated by gender. A project specific \ngender strategy will be prepared and gender related strategies will be incorporated in the resettlement plan and \nEMDP. Socioeconomic assessment will examine the extent to which the expressway would have an impact on \nwomen\u2019s social and economic condition in the project area. Data on social assessment will include information on: (i) \nthe extent to which land acquisition and relocation will impact on women\u2019s social condition and economic activities, \nand (ii) available social services and women\u2019s access to social services (by various ethnic groups). The capacity of the \nExecuting Agency and leaders of the commune and Women\u2019s Union will be assessed in terms of implementation of a \ngender strategy and programs related to HIV/AIDS and human trafficking.  \n \nThe gender strategy will include specific activities to ensure project benefits for women. It will ensure that: (i) women \ndo not become more vulnerable because of relocation; (ii) women are involved in the consultation process for \npreparation of loss of inventory, and the grievance process on resettlement and compensation issues; (iii) women \nretain access to land or land title during resettlement; (iv) potential social problems in the projects are addressed; and \n(v) women fully participate in programs related to HIV/AIDS prevention and human trafficking. A relevant capacity \nbuilding training program will be developed for men and women officials of the Executing Agency; leaders of the \ncommunes; and provincial, district, and commune level Women\u2019s Unions, to ensure effective implementation of the \nresettlement plan and EMDP, and monitoring of project activities. The gender strategy will include activities to increase \nwomen\u2019s participation in community level monitoring of implementation resettlement activities, EMDP, HIV/AIDS and \nhuman  trafficking  related  program  activities.  Community  level  monitoring  and  consultation  for  land  acquisition, \ncompensation  price,  and  relocation  and  implementation  of  the  EMDP  will  include  mechanisms  for  community \ninvolvement and participation, as outlined in the government decrees on regulation for participatory investment \nsupervision, and grassroots democracy. Gender disaggregated monitoring indicators by various ethnic groups will be \ndeveloped to assess the impact of resettlement and the expressway. Monitoring indicators will also include monitoring \nof HIV/AIDS and trafficking activities in the project area. \n \nHas an output been prepared?
