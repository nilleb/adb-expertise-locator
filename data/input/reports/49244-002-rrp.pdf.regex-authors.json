THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  Armenia  for  the  Armenia\u2013Georgia  Border  Regional  Road  (M6  Vanadzor\u2013Bagratashen) \nImprovement Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project will improve a strategic regional link between Armenia (Vanadzor) \nand Georgia Border, one of the most heavily traveled roads for internal and external trade. It will \nrehabilitate and upgrade 51.5 kilometers (km) of the two-lane M6 highway from Vanadzor in \nArmenia to the border with Georgia at Bagratashen, improve facilities and safety along and in \nthe vicinity of this road section in northern Armenia, and strengthen the institutional capacity of \nthe Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC).2 \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Regional integration and transport infrastructure needs. Armenia is a landlocked \ncountry in the South Caucasus region located at the crossroads of Eastern Europe and Western \nAsia.  Armenia  has  distinctive  economic  and  geographic  features  that  pose  considerable \ntransport challenges. Armenia shares borders with four countries: Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iran, and \nTurkey. However, only the southern border with Iran and the northern border with Georgia are \nopen. The western border with Turkey and the eastern border with Azerbaijan have been closed \nsince  the  early  1990s.  In  addition,  Armenia  has  challenging  topography  and  weather \nconditions\u2014the country is mountainous and experiences low winter temperatures, heavy snow, \nand high-intensity rain. As a result, the cost of infrastructure development and maintenance has \nremained high.  \n \n4.  Important link between Armenia and Georgia. Armenia\u2019s economy relies heavily on \ntrade with neighboring countries through one border crossing with Iran at Meghri and two major \nborder crossings with Georgia at Bavra and Bagratashen (Map). Bavra is at the north end of the \nongoing North\u2013South Road Corridor Investment Program financed by the Asian Development \nBank (ADB).3 The North\u2013South road corridor will mainly serve cross-border freight traffic to \nwestern Georgia and the Black Sea ports. Bagratashen is connected to the country\u2019s national \nnetwork via the two-lane M6 highway, which will be upgraded by the proposed project. The M6 \nis a vital link connecting Armenia with Georgia and beyond. It is the shortest link between the \nrespective capitals, Yerevan in Armenia and Tbilisi in Georgia. In 2014, the Bagratashen border-\ncrossing point handled 0.85 million tons of import and export freight, representing 49% of the \ntotal import freight tonnage and goods by road.4 Several international financial institutions are \nworking  jointly  to  improve  border  crossing  efficiency  and  develop  integrated  border \nmanagement  systems  in  Armenia,  including  improvements  at  Bagratashen.  The  project  is \ncrucial to the country\u2019s trade and economy, and will be indispensable in the long term. \n \n5.  The  M6  is  ill-equipped  to  be  a  major  trade  artery.  Originally  a  trail,  it  has  been \nrehabilitated  gradually,  but  to  basic  technical  standards  (especially  geometric  parameters) \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided small-scale project preparatory technical assistance on 9 July 2015 for due diligence. \n3  ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility and Administration of Cofinancing to Armenia for the North\u2013South Road Corridor Investment \nProgram. Manila. \n4  European Investment Bank. 2014. Feasibility Study Comprehensive Phase I Report. Luxembourg.  \n ", "2 \nbecause of its constrained alignment within the Debed gorge, a corridor it shares with Armenia\u2019s \nonly operating international rail link. The M6\u2019s deteriorated condition imposes high transport \ncosts on users. The road pavement is in poor condition, and safety and drainage facilities are \ndeteriorated or damaged. Visibility is unacceptably short in several locations because of sharp \nbends  and  steep  gradients.  Some  structures  are  dangerous  and  need  to  be  rehabilitated \nimmediately. Every year landslides, flooding, rock falls, and heavy snowfall cause road closures. \nThese factors have contributed to a poor safety record\u2014about 30 crashes and six fatalities a \nyear during 2012\u20132014. To improve the whole 90 km of the M6, the government requested ADB \nto finance 51.5 km and the European Investment Bank (EIB) to cofinance the remaining 38.5 km. \n \n6.  Road sector achievements and challenges. Road transport plays an important role in \nthe national economy, but is constrained by road conditions and terrain. In 2014, more than \n55% of freight (measured as tonnage) and more than 95% of passengers traveled by road. \nArmenia\u2019s road network is 7,530 km long and comprises 1,759 km of interstate roads, 1,966 km \nof republican roads, and 3,806 km of local roads. Condition survey data indicates that the \ncondition of interstate roads has declined steadily since 2010; about 66% was in good to fair \ncondition in 2015, down from 93% in 2010. Republican roads have fared better: 66% was in a \ngood to fair condition in 2015, up from 44% in 2010. Reliable data for local roads is not available. \nThe poor road conditions are mainly attributed to (i) a historical lack of maintenance and limited \nmaintenance funding; (ii) obsolete road design and technical specifications; and (iii) a lack of \nqualified workers, contractors, and consulting companies with the necessary knowledge and \nskills. \n \n7.  Road sector institutions. The MOTC is the principal government agency in charge of \nthe transport sector. It administers all interstate and republican roads. MOTC delegates its road \nadministration functions (including collection of road and traffic data and asset management) to \nthe Armenian Roads Directorate, a state-owned noncommercial organization, through annual \ncontracts. Marzes (regional administrations) and local communities manage all local roads.  \nThe institutional capacity of MOTC will be strengthened through trainings to be provided under \nthe project management supports. \n \n8.  Road  safety. The number of road traffic deaths in Armenia per 100,000 people is  \nhigh.5 While the number of recorded deaths has remained at about 300 per year between 2011 \nand 2014, the number of crashes and the recorded number of injuries have risen about 11% per \nyear during the same period.6 Armenia has developed a road safety action plan with support of \nthe European Union through Transport Corridor Europe\u2013Caucasus\u2013Asia regional road safety \nproject in 2014, but the implementation is still pending due to lack of fund.  The National Road \nSafety Council, an advisory body established in 2010, is not fully operational. To augment road \nsafety, improvements are needed in institutional coordination, traffic safety audits, road designs \n(including signs and markings), speed limit enforcement, and other areas.  \n \n9.  Government sector strategy and plans. Improving transport system is a government \npriority, as reflected by its inclusion in the Armenian Development Strategy (ADS), 2014\u20132025. \nThe  government  strategies  see  the  development  and  increased  efficiency  of  the  transport \nsystem as a prerequisite for economic growth and increased access to social and economic \nservices. The project is in line with the government\u2019s development strategies, as well as ADB\u2019s \n                                                \n5  World Health Organization. 2015.

ADB\u2019s support of sustainable road maintenance. The project will reduce the road \nmaintenance  backlog,  contributing  to  the  sustainable  road  maintenance  initiative  being \ndeveloped by ADB and the World Bank under separate interventions. Under the Infrastructure \nSustainability Support Program,8 approved by ADB in 2014, the government began a series of \nreforms to strengthen results-based management systems. The aim was to address some of the \nroad  sector  constraints  in  order  to  help  meet  the  government\u2019s  development  priorities.  \nGreat progress has been made in the phase 1 of the support program: (i) several government \nagencies were restructured to align them more closely with the functions required in the sector, \n(ii) program budgeting structures were implemented to enable expenditures to be more focused \non results, (iii) policies and procedures were introduced to improve road asset management, \nand (iv) a road sector financing strategy was prepared to allow the government to view the road \nsector networks as assets and understand the costs of underfunding or poor resource allocation. \nPhase 2 of the support program, which is being prepared and is expected to be approved in \n2016, will propose an increase in the budget allocation for road network maintenance through a \nsystematic approach until 2021. \n \n11.  Improved social benefits of the project. The project will help improve access to social \nservices, agriculture, tourism, and jobs, with the aim of reducing regional economic and social \ndisparities. The project will benefit Lori Marz (region), a major tourism destination with beautiful \nand dramatic landscapes.9 The area attracts local and international tourists from Europe, Iran, \nthe Russian Federation, and other countries. Tourism is a significant part of the Armenian \neconomy: international tourist arrivals have grown about 14% per year since 2006, reaching \nalmost 1 million in 2013.10 The project will help the region transition from its historically high \ndependence on minerals and chemicals to a more diversified economy with an emphasis on \ntourism and service sectors. \n \n12.  Lessons learned. The project design has incorporated lessons learned from previous \nprojects, including the following: (i) close monitoring and technical support on land acquisition \nand  resettlement  activities  are  necessary  at  an  early  stage  of  the  project  preparation;  \n(ii) a strong project implementation unit, especially in procurement and contract management,  \nis indispensable for successful implementation; and (iii) expeditious decision-making by the \ngovernment and streamlined internal approval procedures are needed to ensure that contracts \nare awarded as scheduled and implementation is effective.  \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n13.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) accelerated deterioration of the road \nnetwork prevented; and (ii) safe, quick, and easy transportation ensured.11 The outcome will be \nimproved transport efficiency and safety along the Vanadzor\u2013Bagratashen section of the M6. \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014.

The government has requested a loan of \u20ac44,037,000.00 (equivalent to $50 million \nbased on the 23 August 2016 exchange rate) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help \nfinance the project. The loan will have a 22-year term, including a grace period of 15 years,  \na straight-line repayment method, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility,12 a commitment charge of 0.15% \nper year (the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan), and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The average loan maturity \nis 18.25 years and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20% per year. The financing plan \nis in Table 2. \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank      \nOrdinary capital resources (loan)  50.0  80.7 \nGovernment  12.0  19.3 \nTotal  62.0  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n17.  The government also requested cofinancing of up to \u20ac51 million in the form of a loan \nfrom the EIB. The EIB cofinancing is parallel and collaborative, and will not be administered by \n                                                \n12 The interest includes a maturity premium of 20 basis points. This is based on the loan terms described in para. 15 \nand the government\u2019s choice of repayment option and dates. ", "5 \nADB.13 Of the total 90.0 km to be reconstructed, EIB will finance 38.5 km and ADB will finance \n51.5 km. A cofinancing letter was signed by EIB and issued to ADB on 4 July 2016. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The MOTC will be the executing agency. The Transport Project Implementation Unit \n(TPIU), which was established in 2006 and satisfactorily implemented the World Bank\u2019s Lifeline \nRoad Network Improvement Project, will be the implementing unit. The TPIU, which is headed \nby a director, has about 15 permanent staff and 10 contractual staff. Recognizing that the TPIU \nneeds to be strengthened, ADB and EIB agreed to use part of their loan proceeds to provide \nsupport to TPIU in the areas of safeguards and procurement to ensure successful project \nimplementation. \n \n19.  ADB and EIB agreed to fully share information acquired in connection with the project so \nthat it may be used by both banks in project processing and implementation. Such information \nmay include documentation relating to environmental and social issues, such as social and \nenvironmental assessment, monitoring, and implementation. ADB and EIB will also cooperate in \nthe course of administering their components through joint missions and information sharing. \n \n20.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual (PAM).14 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2016\u2013November 2020 \nEstimated completion  30 November 2020 \ndate \nLoan closing date  31 May 2021 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Project governing council, comprising members from Armenia's ministries \nof  economy,  finance,  justice,  transport  and  communication,  territorial \nadministration, and civil societies, co-chaired by the ministers of economy \nand transport and communication.

DUE DILIGENCE  \nA.  Technical \n21.  The project does not present any significant technical challenges. It will improve the \nexisting two-lane highway from Vanadzor to the Georgia border at Bagratashen, following the \nexisting alignment except for a few sections where minor realignments are required to improve \ngeometric alignment, sight distance, and safety. The project road will be reconstructed with a \ncarriageway width of 6.6 meters and 1.5\u20132.4-meter shoulders. The design speed is 60\u201380 km \nper hour in rolling terrain with a maximum grade of 3%, and 40\u201360 km per hour in hilly terrain \nwith a maximum grade of 8%. The scope of construction work includes earthwork and pavement \nworks;  reconstruction  of  some  bridges;  drainage;  roadside  improvements;  and  safety \nengineering  features  such  as  traffic  signs,  road  markings,  and  traffic  barriers.  In  addition,  \na climate change risk mitigation assessment will be carried out before construction  starts, \nfocusing on measures such as slope protection and stabilization, rock fall protection, landslide \nand flood protection, and other issues related to climate change. The detailed design was \nprepared by an international consultant engaged by EIB in accordance with acceptable Armenia \nstandards and international practices. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  The economic and financial analysis concluded that the project is economically viable. \nThe  economic  evaluation  covered  the  entire  90  km  of  road  for  both  the  with-project  and  \nwithout-project scenarios. The project will generate economic benefits mainly through (i) vehicle \noperating cost savings; (ii) travel time savings of users; and (iii) improved road safety as a result \nof better pavement conditions, geometric design, and sight distances. The economic analysis \nshows that such benefits would allow the project to produce an economic internal rate of return \nof 20.9%. Although they may not be readily quantifiable, additional economic benefits are likely \nto accrue through lower emissions of air pollutants, noise, and greenhouse gases, as well as the \npromotion of local tourism that creates more jobs along the road. \n \n23.  The project road will not earn revenue through tolls. However, the project is expected to \nreduce the periodic and routine maintenance requirements of the M6 considerably. After the \nproject,  the  routine  unit  maintenance  requirements  will  be  close  to  the  budget  allocation; ", "7 \nperiodic maintenance requirements, when averaged over the evaluation period, will be greater \nthan the current budget allocation. Even the reduced requirements will be a challenge for the \ngovernment to cover. The 2016 budget for periodic and routine maintenance is AMD4.0 billion \nfor all interstates and AMD6.25 billion for republican roads. Special measures will be required to \nensure  that  adequate  budget  is  allocated  to  road  maintenance,  including  for  this  project.  \nUnder phase 2 of the support program,15 ADB is helping the government to take proactive steps \nto increase the budget allocation for road maintenance and enhance its effectiveness through \npolicy dialogue. \n \n24.  Sensitivity tests and calculations of switching values were carried out to determine the \neffect of variations in key input parameters. The result shows switching values of 174% for \nconstruction costs and 45% for benefits\u2014meaning the project would be economically efficient if \nconstruction costs were to rise by 74% or the benefits were to fall by 55% of the base case \nvalues.  Project  viability  is  also  robust  in  the  face  of  traffic  diversion  to  Bavra  from  2022,  \nthe  absence  of  crash  cost  benefits  and  larger-than-anticipated  traffic  disruption  during \nconstruction. \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  Financial management. A financial management assessment of the MOTC confirmed \nthat it has sufficient capacity to manage and maintain the accounting systems, financial controls, \nand audit arrangements required for the project. The MOTC\u2019s financial accounting, auditing \nrules,  and  internal  control  systems  follow  generally  accepted  international  accounting  and \nauditing practices. The MOTC will maintain separate project records and accounts to identify  \n(i) the works, goods, and services financed from the loan proceeds; (ii) financing resources \nreceived;  (iii)  expenditures  incurred  for  the  project;  and  (iv)  the  use  of  counterpart  funds, \nincluding  adequate  internal  controls  and  financial  reporting  arrangements.  An  independent \nchartered  accounting  firm  will  audit  the  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements \nannually in accordance with national and international auditing standards. \n \n26.  The TPIU\u2019s financial management risk is considered moderate and can be lowered by \nmitigating  measures.  An  assessment  identified  two  main  financial  management  risks:  \n(i)  the  project  and  TPIU  will  be  unable  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements  on  financial \nmanagement  and  loan  disbursements  because  of  inexperience  with  ADB  projects,  and  \n(ii) high turnover of TPIU financial management staff because of low salaries and significant \nworkloads may result in operating inefficiency. These financial management risks will be closely \nmonitored during project implementation. \n27.  Procurement. A procurement risk assessment of the MOTC indicated that procurement \nrisk is moderate. The government has established a sound governance mechanism and has the \nexperience  to  undertake  procurement  according  to  the  World  Bank\u2019s  procurement  policy.  \nThe MOTC\u2019s main procurement management challenges are (i) high turnover of experienced \nprocurement  staff, (ii)  complex  and  bureaucratic  internal  approval  systems  that can cause \nproject startup delays, and (iii) multiple layers of review and approving authorities. To mitigate \nthese risks, a master bidding document was prepared, advance procurement has been sought, \nand a procurement consultant will be recruited to assist the TPIU. The procurement consultant \nwill also provide some on-the-job training to ensure experience will stay after the project. \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2015. Technical Assistance to Armenia for the Infrastructure Sustainability Support Program, Phase 2. \nManila (TA 9065-ARM). \n ", "8 \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOTC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 14). \nD.  Poverty and Social \n29.  An assessment of social impacts and analysis of key stakeholders\u2019 perceptions and \nconcerns about the project have been conducted with positive feedback. The project will help \nthe area to transition from an abandoned chemical hub to a tourist and leisure destination.  \nThe  potential  beneficiaries  are  local  communities,  regional  and  cross-border  road  users, \npassengers, and transporters of goods. The project will provide them with safer and faster \naccess to Georgia and the countries to the north, and will reduce their transportation costs.  \nThe main gender issues in the area are unemployment, and vertical and horizontal labor force \nsegregation. Women are present in a narrower band of occupational categories\u2014generally the \nones  with  lower  remuneration  such  as  education  and  health\u2014and  at  lower  levels  of \nresponsibility. The project does not have gender design elements because of its focus on \nconstruction of road works. Increased tourism arrivals may have indirect benefits for women \nworking in this sector. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  ADB  and  EIB  agreed  to  adopt  a  single  social  and  environmental  assessment  and \nplanning process, as well as unified safeguard documentation, consultation, and disclosure \nrequirements to satisfy both ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and EIB\u2019s environmental \nand social standards as stipulated in the EIB\u2019s Statement on the Environmental and Social \nPrinciples  and  Standards  and  EIB\u2019s  Environmental  and  Social  Handbook.16 During  project \nimplementation, ADB will be responsible for supervising and monitoring the environmental and \nsocial aspects of the ADB-financed section, while EIB will be responsible for reviewing and \nmonitoring the environmental and social aspects of the EIB-financed section. \n \n31.  Environment. The project for the ADB-financed section is classified category B for the \nenvironment.  The  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  prepared  as  part  of  the  initial \nenvironmental examination for the ADB-financed road section, includes mitigation measures to \naddress  all  construction  and  operational  impacts.  The  EMP  will  form  part  of  the  bidding \ndocuments.  During  project  implementation,  ADB  will  be  responsible  for  supervising  and \nmonitoring the environmental compliance of the ADB-financed section. The TPIU at MOTC will \nbe  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  all  safeguards  requirements,  and  the  TPIU  has \nengaged a contractual environment specialist for this purpose. However, the TPIU needs to \nbuild  environment  capacity  and  will  be  required  to  hire  a  full-time  qualified  environment \nspecialist to review and oversee the implementation of the initial environmental examination and \nEMP. The contractors will be responsible for implementing mitigation measures in the field \nthrough an environment specialist. The environment specialist of the supervision consultant will \nconduct environmental supervision in the field. A grievance redress mechanism to handle both \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguard  issues  will  be  established  to  receive  feedback  and \ncomplaints, if any, from affected parties and to address them during construction and operation. \nThe TPIU will submit to ADB and relevant government authorities the semiannual environmental \nmonitoring reports for the ADB-financed section. These reports will be disclosed to the public on \nwebsites of the MOTC (Armenian) and ADB (English). \n                                                \n16 EIB. 2009.

The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement. With ADB\u2019s assistance, the MOTC has prepared a draft land acquisition and \nresettlement plan (LARP) that contains a preliminary social impact assessment based on the \ncadastral data. The assessment indicates that the project will permanently acquire 542 land \nplots covering 212,871 square meters in nine communities, affecting private, community, and \nstate land. This includes 44 residential land plots, 10 businesses, and 11 leaseholders on state \nand community lands. The project will affect 303 households (788 persons at an average \nhousehold  size  of  2.6),  most  of  which  will  be  partially  but  permanently  affected.  \nFor implementation, the LARP will be updated with census data, an assets inventory, and \nconsultations with the identified affected households during the detailed measurement survey \nupon  issuance  of  the  requisite  decree  by  the  government.  In  Armenia,  there  are  chronic \ndiscrepancies between cadastral maps and the objects on the ground. Therefore, the detailed \nmeasurement  survey  will  determine  the  correct  status  of  the  affected  structures  and  the \nconsequent number of the project-affected persons, which may have been overestimated earlier. \nBased  on the  current data,  44 residential  and  10  business  structures  are  expected  to  be \nrelocated. \n \n33.  The draft LARP details the impacts of land acquisition and proposes ways to mitigate \nthem, including an entitlement matrix. Provisions have been made for (i) the loss of land, \nresidential  and  nonresidential  buildings,  public  property,  crops,  businesses,  and  jobs;  \n(ii)  allowances  for  severe  impacts;  (iii)  relocation  allowance;  and  (iv)  temporary  impacts.  \nThe  LARP  also  covers  asset  valuation,  compensation  provisions,  organizational  setup,  \na  grievance  redress  mechanism,  and  compliance  with  ADB  information  disclosure  and \nconsultation requirements. The provisions of the draft LARP have been discussed and disclosed \nduring consultations with the community. The TPIU has implemented World Bank and ADB \nprojects involving involuntary resettlement and has engaged a safeguards consultant. Generally, \nexecuting  agencies  in  Armenia  have  a  strong  commitment  to  meeting  ADB\u2019s  safeguards \nrequirements and managing the social risks. The LARP was disclosed to the public on the \nwebsites  of the  MOTC  (Armenian)  and  ADB (English).  After  implementation  of the  LARP,  \na compliance report prepared by an external monitor will be submitted to ADB, which will be  \na precondition for initiating the civil works. \n \n34.  Indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples,  \nas there are no indigenous peoples near the ADB-financed road section or in the country,  \nas defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) for operational purposes. Accordingly,  \nno indigenous peoples planning documents will be required. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n35.  Major risks and mitigating measure are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.17 Overall,  the  risks  can  be  managed  by \nadopting  mitigating  measures,  and  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs of mitigation. \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nImplementation of program budgeting  ADB\u2019s  Infrastructure  Sustainability  Support  Programa  (phase  1  is \nhas been limited by weak capacity and  ongoing, phase 2 is being prepared) will help strengthen capacity and \npoor information flows, which results in  improve program budgeting in the road subsector. A policy matrix to \nunsustainability of road maintenance  increase the budget allocation for road maintenance will be included in \nphase  2,  which  will  further  improve  the  sustainability  of  road \nmaintenance. \nInadequate project management capacity  A lack of experienced staff and high staff turnover in the TPIU because \nof the TPIU and extra workload to meet  of uncompetitive salaries have undermined its performance. ADB has \nADB and EIB requirements might delay  discussed  with  the  government  increasing  salaries  with  a  special \nproject procurement and implementation  arrangement for TPIU staff, but it may take more time to be effective. \nThe government agreed to hire consultants, including specialists in \nprocurement,  engineering,  environment,  safeguards,  and  financial \nmanagement, under the loan to strengthen the TPIU during project \nimplementation. EIB also agreed to allocate funds to strengthen the \nTPIU\u2019s capacity. ADB and EIB agreed to enhance coordination through \njoint  missions  and  sharing  of  information.  Advanced  contracting \nactions have been initiated for consultants and civil works. \nCost overruns  A sufficient contingency  has been allocated to ensure better cost \nestimates before awarding of civil works contracts. \nInadequate measures for climate change  Located in mountainous terrain, the project is vulnerable to disasters \nimpact risk  such as floods, landslides, rock falls, slope erosion, and snowfall.  \nA climate change expert with a strong engineering background will be \nengaged  to  review  the  existing  design  and  propose  specific \nengineering solutions and measures to adapt to the climate change \nimpacts. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EIB = European Investment Bank, TPIU = Transport Project Implementation Unit. \na ADB. 2014.
