I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment of up to $25.2 million1 in the ADM Maculus Fund II L.P. (Maculus II). \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Macro- and Microeconomic Background and Rationale \n \n2.  In the early 1990s, Asia experienced explosive capital inflows. Attracted by the Asian \nmiracle, Japanese and Korean banks (which accounted for over 55% of all credit provided to the \nAsian private sector), along with European and US investors, bought Asian loans and bonds. \nCoincidently, the domestic private sector was taking full advantage of these countries\u2019 pegged \ncurrencies and the advantages of foreign versus local borrowing costs available at the time. In \nJuly 1997, following a period of slowing exports, rising current account deficits, and depleted \ncentral bank reserves, Asian currencies unpegged from the US dollar, creating a systemic \nfinancial collapse. Par-based lenders faced mounting portfolio losses, weak bankruptcy codes \nand legal enforcement, poor legislative and judiciary protection, and no secondary market. The \nresult was substantial amounts of nonperforming loans (NPLs), both official and unofficial, as a \npercentage of total loans.  \n \n3.  Market  estimates  are  that  one  to  two  thirds  of  all  loans  provided  in  Asia\u2014outside \nJapan\u2014are considered delinquent. This amounts to over $400 billion, at minimum of distressed \nassets in Asia (Figure 1).   \n \nFigure 1: Total Distressed Debt, Asia (except Japan) \n($ billion) \n \nThailand\n \n$19.1\n \n \nIndonesia  \nHong Kong, China/\n$16.9  \nPRC\n \n$307\nIndia  \n$29.9\n \n \n RepuRbelipc.  oOf fK  oKroerae a\n \n$15.0\n \n \nTaipei,China  \n$19.1\n \nPhilippines\n \n$9.0\n \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.  \n \nSource: Ernst & Young Global Nonperforming Loan Report 2004.  \n \n \n                                                 \n1 The amount of $25 million will be invested in Maculus II. Up to $200,000 will be used for interest on ADB\u2019s pro rata \nportion of the drawdown prior to ADB\u2019s funding.  ", "2    \n \n \n4.  Many of these distressed companies are struggling while talks with creditors continue to \nstall. In many cases, the lack of progress stems from a complete breakdown of trust and \nunderstanding between different creditor groups, borrowers, management, and shareholders. In \nan  environment  where  the  legal  system  is  frequently  neither  robust  nor  creditor-friendly, \nnegotiated settlement is key. However, with mistrust prevailing, negotiated settlements are \nunlikely  to  start  or  succeed.  Until  this  distressed  debt  problem  is  cleared,  the  companies \nconcerned cannot grow or borrow. \n \n5.  Restructuring  of  these distressed companies could  be  much  improved  by  having  a \nsource of capital to buy out existing creditors (take-out capital). Once trust is broken, in most \ncases, creditors value cash much more highly than any term-restructured solution. Once a \ncompany has gone into financial distress, capital to finance such restructuring is extremely \ndifficult to find as (i) banks tend not to lend to companies in default, (ii) hedge funds are \nreluctant  to  step  into  complex  situations  where  they  are  unfamiliar  with  local  laws  and \npersonalities, (iii) mezzanine debt2 and other capital providers demand too high a price on their \ninvestments, and (iv) original shareholders and their supporters are reluctant to show the value \nof their assets in case creditors seize them. \n \n6.  Maculus II will bridge this gap and take out certain creditor groups to initiate sensible \nfinancial and/or corporate restructuring of the investee portfolio companies. Maculus II will not \ninterfere in running the portfolio companies and will restrict itself to facilitating rehabilitation and \nfinancial restructuring. However, Maculus II will seek to offer more benefit to portfolio companies \nthan other market investors. For example, it may aim to obtain the right to advise portfolio \ncompanies on restructuring terms or name people associated with its general partner to portfolio \ncompany boards, or creditor and/or restructuring committees. If new management is required, a \npool of resources is available and well known to the general partner. Maculus II\u2019s overall \ninvestment philosophy will be to maximize investor returns over the medium to long term by \nadding value as an active investor in the portfolio companies. \n \n7.  Disgruntled and frustrated creditors are often willing to give up some attainable gains. \nThis is reflected in the sharp upward swing often seen in company share prices when they are \nrehabilitated.  \n \n8.  Maculus II will foster and build on the existing signs that debtors and creditors are willing \nto work toward mutually beneficial solutions. Some driving forces behind this acceleration are \nthe recent rise in local stock markets, improved economic growth, under-leveraged banks, and \nlow interest rates. \n \nB.  Public Sector Country Strategies and Interventions of the Asian Development \nBank \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s proposed investment in Maculus II will build on its strategy of helping developing \nmember countries tackle the burden of distressed assets and NPLs and build a sound and \nefficient financial sector. For example, in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), ADB helped the \nCinda Asset Management Corporation (Cinda) deal with NPLs. ADB technical assistance (TA)3 \nwas  given  immediately  after  Cinda  was  established  to  (i)  provide  the  asset  management \ncompany  (AMC)  with  the  technology  to  complete  its  mandate  to  undertake  financial  and \n                                                 \n2  Mezzanine debt is repayable only after other debt with higher ranking has been satisfied, but before equity is paid. \n3  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Institutional Strengthening of the Cinda \nAsset Management Company. Manila (TA 3303-PRC). \n  ", "    3\n \n   \ncorporate restructuring of companies whose assets were foreclosed, (ii) equip Cinda with the \nlatest techniques used for purchase and disposition of NPLs to achieve sufficient returns from \nfunds  injected  to  acquire  NPLs,  and  (iii)  help  Cinda  implement  appropriate  management \ninformation systems. The TA has quickly established Cinda operationally and provided broad \nrecommendations on various legal and regulatory issues to policy makers in the Government of \nthe PRC. A second TA for Cinda to help develop asset-backed securities is being approved. In \nIndia, ADB provided a TA to enable and structure asset reconstruction companies.4 In the \nprivate sector, ADB has been involved in projects with (i) ADM Maculus I, (ii) Yangtze Special \nSituations Fund (PRC), (iii) financing the purchase of nonperforming mortgages by a Deutsche \nBank AG-managed fund from National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation (Philippines), (iv) \nfinancing  the  purchase  of  an  NPL  portfolio  from  PCI  Equitable  Bank  by  Bayerische \nHypovereinsbank AG (Philippines), and (v) formation of Actis Asset Reconstruction Company \n(India).  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED FUND \n \nA.  Background \n \n10.  Maculus II is a successor fund of Maculus I, in which ADB invested $20 million of a total \nof $138 million in 2004.5 The establishment of Maculus II follows the rapid deployment of capital \nof Maculus I. Maculus II will build upon the success of the first fund and its strategy. \n \nB.  Objectives \n \n11.  The objectives of Maculus II are to (i) mobilize foreign capital flows to financially troubled \nbut potentially viable companies throughout Asia; (ii) catalyze the financial restructuring and \nrehabilitation of these companies to (a) optimize their asset and capital utilization; (b) revitalize \ncorporate  growth  and  increase  competitiveness;  (c)  increase  profitability,  employment,  and \nemployee well-being; and (d) introduce industry, management, environmental, and corporate \ngovernance best practices more widely in the region; and (iii) achieve a demonstration effect, as \nMaculus  II\u2019s  transactions  will  have  a  multiplier  effect  by  creating  replicable  (best  practice) \nrestructuring models for Asia\u2019s emerging markets. \n \nC.  Concept and Strategic Rationale  \n12.  Maculus II will invest primarily in the capital structure (securities, loans, equity, or other \nassets) of potentially viable, listed, or unlisted companies that are financially distressed because \nof excessive debt and/or inappropriate capital and financial structure. These companies are at \nrisk of bankruptcy (i.e., liquidation with full labor retrenchment) unless financially restructured. \nMaculus II, through its investment in the portfolio companies, will assist such restructuring. \n \n13.  Maculus II will use the best-known global practices and experienced professionals to \ncreate opportunities for capital appreciation through repositioning, rehabilitation, development, \nand intensive management of distressed or underperforming assets. It will seek attractive risk-\nadjusted returns by exploiting interim inefficiencies in the market for NPLs and will capitalize on \nthe expertise of its sponsors in managing distressed assets. \n \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to India for Developing the Enabling Environment for and Structuring Asset \nReconstruction Companies in India. Manila (TA 3943-IND). \n5 ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors for ADM Maculus Fund L.P. \nFund. Manila (REG 7195).  \n ", "4    \n \n \n14.  The two major sources of distressed assets are governments and banks. Governments \nthroughout Asia have attempted to rationalize and strengthen their banking systems, leading to \nthe creation of state-sponsored AMCs in some of Maculus II\u2019s targeted countries. The primary \ntask of AMCs is to take nonperforming assets from undercapitalized banks and sell them to \ninvestors at market prices. Other banks have performed their own ad hoc sales of distressed \nassets through public auctions and private negotiated sales with end buyers. \n \n15.  Until recently, most domestic institutions have been unable or unwilling to write down \nNPLs to market prices because of their weak capital positions. Financial institutions and AMCs, \nhowever, have become increasingly aggressive in selling distressed assets. Banking reforms \nand tax changes are the primary motivation for sale of assets, not economic value. Increasing \ngovernment pressure or incentive creation (as in India, Philippines, and PRC) and renewed \ninterest in equity markets have given banks further incentives to absorb such losses, and hence \nsell NPLs. Foreign institutions\u2014financial and trade\u2014once again see new lending or trade as a \ngrowth area. Dealing with NPLs or bad debt is seen as a distraction to management and \npotentially negative for new business. Private negotiation and careful structuring often provide a \nrich pool of assets for distressed asset buyers. \n \nD.  Operational and Investment Plan  \n16.  ADM is involved in ongoing discussions with several attractive investment opportunities. \nGiven ADM\u2019s rapid deployment of funds, the investment manager can apply lessons learned in \nMaculus  I  to  strengthen  its  deal  sourcing  and  execution  abilities.  There  are  significant \ninvestment opportunities in Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines, where ADM has built \nstrong relationships and refined its understanding of complex local laws and regulations. In \naddition to these markets, ADM has indicated that it will also target investments in Viet Nam, Sri \nLanka, and Pakistan. \n \n17.  Although competition in the distressed debt arena is expected to increase because of \ndemand for higher yields from an increasing number of investors, ADM has differentiated itself \nfrom the competition since it specializes in Asian distressed debt (excluding Japan) while its \ncompetitors have more of a global focus. It is expected that ADM will continue to enjoy a \ncompetitive position in the Asian market by concentrating its decision makers in the region and \nbuilding on a long track record of innovative solutions. \n \nE.  Structure and Size  \n \n18.  Maculus II is denominated in US dollars, established in the Cayman Islands, and is an \nexempted limited partnership.6 Its term is 5 years from the date of closing, but may be extended \nfor up to two consecutive 1-year periods at the discretion of the general partner.  \n \n                                                 \n6  The selection of the Cayman Islands as the legal domicile is in line with international practice for private equity \nfunds to structure such a vehicle most efficiently. Various ADB-sponsored funds have been established in this \njurisdiction. The Cayman Islands were chosen because Maculus II can obtain permanent tax exemption, thus it \nprovides a tax-efficient domicile. The Cayman Islands\u2019 legal system is based on English law, therefore the legal \nconcepts are familiar to many investors in developed countries. The Cayman Islands have also significantly \nimproved their anti-money-laundering regulations in recent years and have been removed from the Financial Action \nTask Force on Money Laundering list of non-cooperative countries. The limited partnership agreement includes \nanticorruption, anti-money-laundering, and anti-terrorism provisions requiring the general partner and ADM (as \ninvestment manager) to institute and maintain internal control procedures to prevent Maculus II from being involved \nin any money-laundering scheme, fraud, or other corrupt activity.  \n  ", "    5\n \n   \n19.  ADB\u2019s commitment will be up to $25 million or 25% of paid-up capital (whichever is less). \nADB will not be the largest investor in Maculus II. The limited partners\u2019 participation in Maculus \nII is covered under the limited partnership agreement, which has been fully negotiated and is in \nline with market practice and ADB standards. \n \nF.  Sponsor  \n \n20.  ADM  is  the  sponsor  of  Maculus  II,  and  will  be  its  investment  manager  and  main \nshareholder of the general partner. ADM has developed a strong track record identifying and \nsuccessfully realizing value from distressed debt opportunities in Asia, and is one of Asia\u2019s \nleading specialist managers of Asian distressed assets. ADM was founded in 1996 to provide \nstructured financing advice to government and corporate borrowers throughout Asia. In 1998, \nADM  Hong  Kong  Limited  (ADM's  Hong  Kong,  China-based  entity)  became  a  licensed \ninvestment manager registered by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission. ADM is \nowned by its founders and directors.  \n \n21.  Since  its  inception,  ADM  has  turned  over  in  excess  of  $3  billion  in  face  value  of \ndistressed debt and has been directly involved in restructuring over $2 billion in distressed \nassets.  ADM\u2019s  key  personnel  have  extensive  experience  in  Asia,  Asian  distressed  debt \nmanagement,  capital  mobilization,  and  asset  restructuring.  Since  its  formation,  ADM  has \ndeveloped a close network of well-connected local partners and joint ventures in Indonesia, \nRepublic of Korea, Philippines, and Thailand to source deal opportunities and obtain an in-depth \nunderstanding of local market conditions.  \n \n22.  ADM has developed a strong track record in Asia identifying and successfully realizing \nvalue from distressed debt opportunities. ADM has received several awards for the Galleus \nFund, including the top Asian fund in Asian Investor Magazine\u2019s hedge funds All Strategies \ncategory (2002 and 2003). ADM manages over $220 million in Asian distressed debt, $450 \nmillion in two passive collateralized bond obligation and equity warrant pools sponsored by the \nKorean Government, and $50 million in other funds. \n \nG.  Eligible Instruments  \n23.  Maculus II will invest in single credit situations, mostly through direct purchase of debt \n(securities or loans) and, to a lesser extent, equity issued by troubled Asian companies and NPL \nportfolios.  \n \n24.  The geographical focus of Maculus II\u2019s investments will be selected ADB developing \nmember countries where restructuring of the banking and corporate sector is at an early stage. \nTo diversify, Maculus II will invest no more than 35% of aggregate capital commitments in any \none country and no more than 15% of aggregate capital commitments in any one portfolio \ncompany.  \n \n ", "6    \n \n \nH.  Operational Arrangements \n1.  General Partner \n  \n25.  ADM Maculus Investments II Limited has been incorporated in the Cayman Islands to \nserve  as  general  partner  to  Maculus  II.  Pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  limited  partnership \nagreement, Maculus II has delegated to ADM (as investment manager) complete and exclusive \nresponsibility for all management and investment decisions made on behalf of Maculus II. The \ndirectors of the general partner are Robert Appleby, Chris Botsford, and Denys Firth.  \n \n2.  Investment Manager  \n \n26.  The general partner has appointed ADM as the investment manager of Maculus II, \npursuant to an investment management agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, all the \ngeneral partner\u2019s responsibilities in connection with sourcing and management of Maculus II \n(including investment decisions) have been delegated to ADM. ADM is registered with the Hong \nKong Securities and Futures Commission.  \n \n3.  Advisory Board \n \n27.  Maculus II has an advisory board established by the general partner, consisting of \nrepresentatives of the investment manager and certain limited partners (including ADB). The \nboard will meet regularly and have responsibility for (i) reviewing the investment decisions of the \ninvestment  manager;  (ii)  reviewing  the  annual  accounts  of  Maculus  II;  (iii)  reviewing  and \nresolving conflicts of interest issues, if any; and (iv) any other matters specifically delegated to \nthem by the general and/or limited partners. ADB will retain the right to appoint one person to \nthe advisory board of Maculus II, who may or may not be an ADB staff member. \n \n4.  Investment Committee \n \n28.  The investment committee of Maculus II will be appointed by the general partner and will \nconsist of the general partner\u2019s three directors and four other members. \n \n \n29.  The investment committee will be primarily responsible for reviewing and approving \ninvestments and divestments of Maculus II, and the general partner will act in accordance with \nthe instructions of the investment committee. The committee will meet on an ad hoc basis as \nneeded. \n \nI.  Environmental and Social Impact Assessment  \n \n30.  The  general  partner  will  ensure  that  all  drawdown  notices  issued  to  ADB  include \nconfirmation that the proposed use of funds complies with ADB's policies on environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous people. ADB will have the right to decline participation \nin  any  investment  that  it  determines  would  violate  any  ADB  policy  (or  be  among  ADB\u2019s \nprohibited activities). \n \n31.  The project is classified by ADB as a financial intermediary (FI). \n \n32.  The  general  partner  and  the  investment  manager  have  implemented  environmental \nmanagement system (EMS) guidelines for Maculus I, which were received and reviewed by \n  ", "    7\n \n   \nADB in September 2005. PSOP has confirmed that the EMS guidelines have been in put into \npractice successfully during the investment period for Maculus I over the past year. Parallel to \nthe financial appraisal, the investment manager\u2019s analysts carry out environmental due diligence \nbefore  submitting  a  transaction  to  the  investment  committee  (if  necessary,  using  external \nconsultants). Environmental concerns have been satisfactorily addressed for all investments \nmade in the past year in Maculus I\u2014confirmed during ADB's due diligence. The system in place \nhas been fully documented and is considered appropriate for Maculus II. However, the general \npartner and investment manager have been required to undergo ADB-sponsored or approved \nenvironmental training, when the training becomes available.  \n \n33.  The following framework will guide Maculus II for each investment: \n \n(i)  ADM will identify certain investment opportunities. \n \n(ii)  Maculus II will make an initial investment (expected to be less than $1 million) in \nthe portfolio company to gain access to creditor privileged information. Before \nmaking such initial investment, the general partner and investment manager will \nverify (to the best of their knowledge) that the opportunity is not on the prohibited \nactivity  list.  In  the  case  of  investments  made  through  secondary  market \npurchases (i.e., purchases of existing debt), the investment will be permitted \nprovided the investee company is not substantially involved in any prohibited \nactivity. New money investments (i.e., investments made through a new issue of \nnew equity or debt by the investee company) in a conglomerate will be permitted \nif the general partner or investment manager obtains specific assurances from \nthe investee company that the proceeds of the new money investment will not be \nused in any prohibited activity. \n \n(iii)  Maculus II will make best reasonable efforts not to make new money investments \nin investee companies whose operations do not comply with ADB policies, unless \nsuch investee company has adopted and complies with ADB policies, except as \npermitted in (ii) above. \n \n(iv)  Maculus  II  will  make  best  reasonable  efforts  not  to  make  any  new  money \ninvestments in any investee company that conducts or intends to conduct an \nactivity classified as a category-A project or category-B sensitive project\u2014unless \nthe general partner has received prior written confirmation from ADB that such \nproject complies with ADB policies, or the investee company has adopted and \ncomplies with ADB policies, except as permitted in (ii) above. \n \n(v)  ADM will carry out further research on the investment opportunity as a creditor \nand make an investment (if the outcome is positive) by (a) providing fresh capital \n(debt or equity) to the portfolio company, or (b) purchasing further amounts of \nexisting loans/bonds.  \n \n34.  EMS Procedures for New Money Investments. The general partner and/or investment \nmanager, as appropriate, shall perform the following procedures (on the basis of reasonable \neffort and to the extent practicable): \n \n(i)  Determine  if  the  proposed  investment  will  materially  involve  involuntary \nresettlement or materially affect indigenous people (as part of the due-diligence \nprocess, before investing in a holding). To the extent it does, ensure that the \n ", "8    \n \n \ninvestee company complies with all ADB policies on involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous people. \n \n(ii)  Cause  each  holding  (with  due  regard  for  the  partnership\u2019s  limited  ability  to \ninfluence the actions of issuers of holdings owing to the nature of the investment) \nto  continue  (a)  to  comply  with  all  applicable  environmental  and  social \nrequirements, ADB policies, and applicable environmental guidelines; and (b) not \nto engage in any prohibited activity.  \n \n(iii)  Provide  the  advisory  board  with  a  report  outlining  the  findings  of  its \nenvironmental due diligence (as promptly as reasonably possible, but in any \nevent not more than 1 month after the close of the relevant fiscal year). \n \nJ.  Justification of ADB Investment \n \n1.  Development Impact: Overview of Benefits of Distressed Asset \nRestructuring  \n \n35.  Through Maculus II, ADB will provide financial support to selected distressed companies \nand the banking sector in Asia. Maculus II\u2019s objective in restructuring distressed asset would \nhelp  deliver  development  impact  on  four  fronts,  each  as  described  below:  (i)  entrusted \nrelationship,  (ii)  employment  preservation,  (iii)  efficiency  promotion,  and  (iv)  expansion \nopportunity. In assisting corporate restructuring, Maculus II will address a key weakness in the \nbanking sector that, if left unchecked, may limit continued economic growth. Equity investments \nin funds are an established intervention by the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD).  \n \n36.  First,  given  the  contentious  nature  of  distressed  debt  resolution  and  the  ensuing \ncorporate restructuring, attaining an entrusted relationship among parties is crucial to implement \nthe process. With ADB as an \u201chonest broker\u201d shareholder in Maculus II, ensuring a suitable \ncode  of  conduct  with  regard  to  Maculus  II\u2019s  interaction  with  distressed  clients,  the  target \ndistressed firm and original creditors will gain comfort in engaging dialogue with Maculus II to \nconsider  and  execute  the  resolution  plan.  Second,  by  providing  needed  capital  and  a \nrestructuring plan to the distressed client, Maculus II will directly help the client revitalize its \nbusiness, which will result in long-term employment preservation, and even expansion, within \nthe client firm. Third, such capital infusion from Maculus II will allow the client firm to refocus on \nits operations (rather than be distracted by avoiding and negotiating with defaulted creditors). \nThis will result in improved operational efficiency for the previously distressed firm. Finally as a \nresult of the restructuring capital and increased efficiency, the client firm could seize expansion \nbusiness opportunities to grow its business. \n \n37.  On a macro level, accelerating the Asian restructuring process is key to (i) regenerating \nregional growth, (ii) preserving investments in companies or projects, and (iii) reestablishing \nconfidence  so  that  new  investors  will  step  forward  to  finance  the  continuing  massive \ninfrastructure  needs.  Restructuring  gives  the  finance  provider  some  ability  to  ensure  that \ncontrols, environmental standards, and corporate governance procedures are implemented and \nadhered to. The leverage in the debt restructuring process far exceeds the level of control of a \nprivate equity or other participant in corporate investment structures. For Asia as a whole, the \npresence of large numbers of defaulted companies weighs heavily on the banking and financial \nsystem. Even where bad debts have been sold or transferred to AMCs, the large numbers of \ndistressed companies dampen the economy as they are relatively unproductive. In some cases, \nclosure may be the optimum solution, but in most cases the underlying companies continue to \n  ", "    9\n \n   \nbe productive and recover strongly once the weight of bad debt is removed. This is a direct \nresult of the cause of bad debt which, in many cases, was effectively currency speculation, \nalthough many companies were unaware of this at the time. \n \n38.  The Asian development experience has shown that economic growth is one of the most \npowerful weapons in the fight against poverty. Growth creates the need for labor, the main asset \nof the poor. As growth continues, private sector employment becomes the major source of \neconomic support for most workers and their families. Economic growth also increases the tax \nbase, enabling governments to finance social services such as health and education.7  \n \n39.  Indirectly, Maculus II addresses the inherent weaknesses of the banking industry in Asia. \nCorporate structuring is crucial to restore the health of the banking industry in the targeted \ncountries,  as  in  the  case  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  after  the  1997  financial  crisis.  The \nvulnerability of the banking system and the economy is a result of rapid growth that outpaced \nthe establishment of sound regulation, building of institutional capacities, and formulation of \nsound corporate governance principles. The development of a sound and efficient financial \nsector  is  a  prerequisite  for  broad-based  private  sector-led  economic  development  that  will \nreduce poverty. Failure to solve the NPL problem will result in a further drain of resources and \npotential earnings, and will significantly impair capital. As credit costs increase to cover the cost \nof NPL losses, financial institutions are reluctant to make fresh loans. Tighter credit restricts \neconomic growth, as enterprises are unable to access capital. The sale of NPLs will alleviate \nthese problems and help stimulate economic growth. \n \n40.  The benefits of resolving an NPL crisis are well proven, judging from the success of \ncountries outside Asia. For example, in the US or Sweden, when NPLs decreased, the national \neconomies began to recover and grow; companies and businesses started creating new jobs; \nand investors\u2014more confident of a country\u2019s long-term  growth prospects\u2014began to pump \ninvestment capital into the country\u2019s stock, bond, and property markets as well as individual \ncompanies and businesses. The development of banks\u2019 credit profiles reflects this improvement. \nFor example, Standard and Poor\u2019s recently raised in 2005 the outlooks of Bank of China and \nChina Construction Bank from stable to positive. The outlook upgrades were a direct outcome of \nthe improvement of the Government of the PRC\u2019s support and the resulting improvement in the \nbanks\u2019 asset quality by reducing NPLs. Standard and Poor\u2019s noted that these banks \u201chave \nsolidly embarked on the path of financial reform. This trend was accompanied with a boost in \nprovisioning and increase in balance sheet transparency.\u201d8  \n \n2.  Development Impact: Maculus I and Maculus II \n \n41.  The financial community has taken notice of the success of Maculus I in combining \ndevelopmental and environmental goals with financial restructuring to create profitable returns. \nParticipants in the restructuring sector\u2014investors, banks, companies, and their advisers\u2014are \nnow much more receptive to methodologies sponsored by ADB. However, more work needs to \nbe done to sustain this momentum. It is reckoned that there are still $400 billion\u2013$1,000 billion \nof NPLs and impaired loans in the Asian financial system. Maculus I\u2019s $138 million has punched \nwell above its weight but it will need further work to make a lasting impact. The backing of \nMaculus II by ADB will demonstrate ADB\u2019s and ADM\u2019s confidence that the methodologies used \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2000.

ADM\u2019s role in the development process has been to invest in and rehabilitate distressed \nAsian companies through financial restructuring. The restructuring of distressed assets, which \nhave an adverse financial or capital structure, has several development benefits, including (i) \nmotivating management and shareholders to operate assets transparently and efficiently to \nbenefit creditors, shareholders, and the community; (ii) ensuring that \u201cgood\u201d assets, which would \nhave been liquidated by the creditors, continue to operate and generate a return; (iii) ensuring \nthat \u201cbad\u201d assets, which are non-operating and have no chance of generating a sufficient return, \nare  liquidated  so  that  capital  can  be  deployed  more  effectively;  and  (iv)  promoting  good \ncorporate governance so that management and shareholders operate assets transparently, as \nwell as an environmentally sound approach to operations \n \n43.  ADB\u2019s involvement in Maculus I meant that the aims and objectives of Maculus II were, \nand are, radically different from other funds in this sector. While other funds have focused on \nshort-term gains from downsizing or liquidation of assets, ADM has focused on rehabilitation \nand growth within the context of satisfactory environmental standards. Motivating the investee \ncompanies to take the ADM route to better health, with additional costs such as environmental \naudits and working within a more transparent and ethical framework than before, was only \npossible because of (i) the written policies of Maculus II, which meant there could be no \nnegotiation on these issues; and (ii) the borrowers\u2019 perception that Maculus I would behave \nresponsibly and ethically as it monitored the investment. \n \n44.  The development impact is mainly indicated by how successful the restructuring of the \ndistressed company was. In other words, an unsuccessful restructuring will lead to insolvency, \nand a successful restructuring will restore the status quo or even lead to new growth with further \nspill-over effect to the economy as a whole. This is the main, direct developmental impact \nachieved by this type of intervention. In other words, the level of success of the restructuring \nand  the  level  of  developmental  impact  are  positively  correlated.  Therefore  logically, \ndevelopment  impact  and  the  internal  rate  of  return  (IRR)  of  Maculus  II\u2019s  investments  are \npositively correlated, too; i.e., the IRR increases because the restructuring was successful and \nequity prices go up and debt gets repaid as the respective company again develops positively. \nThe  high  level  of  confidence  of  existing  and  new  investors  in  the  returns  of  Maculus  II \ndemonstrates their confidence in the developmental impact.9 \n \n45.  Maculus  I  was  57.5%  invested  in  the  first  year  (over  90%  invested  in  the  first  17 \nmonths), ensuring that investors were not paying unnecessary fees on committed, but un-\ninvested, funds. Maculus II has already produced healthy returns. Maculus I has demonstrated \nthat good returns are not necessarily compromised by an \u201cethically focused\u201d investment style. \n \n46.  Lessons  Learned.  Maculus  I  demonstrated  that  several  factors  are  necessary  to \nprevent  distressed  situations  and  enable  sensible  restructuring,  including  (i)  a  stable  and \nreliable legal system and regulatory framework with particular regard to security (e.g., title \nregistration) and bankruptcy/foreclosure laws; (ii) management of companies within parameters \nand restricted business environment stipulated by lenders; (iii) strong corporate governance, \nwhich guarantees checks and balances to avoid management decisions that put companies at \nrisk (e.g., unsustainable expansion plans, backed by borrowings not correlated to actual cash \n                                                 \n9  Appendix 1 provides a more detailed outline of the major development outcomes and measures for development \neffectiveness. \n  ", "   11\n \n   \nflow; appropriate due diligence by sponsors and lenders to develop sufficient tariff/passenger \nassumptions);  (iv)  an  investor  that  can  bring  together  all  parties  involved\u2014shareholders, \nmanagement, lenders, and other company stakeholders\u2014and develop and negotiate a sensible \nrestructuring plan, potentially removing uncooperative parties and use of political influence; (v) a \nreview of major strategic initiatives and financing plans of companies, including the detailed \nreview  of  the  business  plan,  assumptions,  use  of  proceeds,  etc.,  to  insure  that  strategic \ninitiatives  are  aligned  with  the  interests  of  all  stakeholders/shareholders;  and  (vi)  solid \ninvestment and market analysis in which transparency of information is critical. \n    \n3.  Role of ADB and Value Added \n \n47.  Specifically, ADB\u2019s continued involvement as an investor will help maintain these value-\nadded inputs: (i) continued support for Maculus II\u2019s environmental analysis in deal due diligence \nand ongoing portfolio company monitoring; and (ii) additional support for recently revised ADB \npolicies regarding anticorruption, anti-money-laundering, and anti-terrorism representations and \ncovenants. In addition, it will (i) stimulate and facilitate reforms in the targeted countries, push \ngovernments to revise laws and regulations, and create an appropriate legal and regulatory \nframework;  (ii)  support  government  initiatives  to  pursue  financial  sector  reforms  aimed  at \nresolving problems caused by mounting NPLs; and (iii) provide modern, replicable, and market-\ntested mechanisms for NPL and distressed asset resolution, creating benchmarks, bankable \nstructures, and enhancing trust in the legal and regulatory environment. \n \n48.  Investing  in  Maculus  II  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  strategy  of  promoting  (i)  poverty \nreduction through job preservation and creation; (ii) private sector development; and (iii) country \nstrategies  addressing  issues  such  as  introducing  best  practices  in  corporate  governance, \nbanking reform, NPL resolution, and infrastructure preservation and development. \n \n49.  Investment in Maculus II is a logical continuation of ADB\u2019s work with ADM based on the \nsuccessful results, in terms of projected financial returns and Maculus II\u2019s impact on corporate \ngovernance and development impact in Asia. \n \nK.  Records, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n50.  Proper and complete records and accounts of Maculus II's business will be maintained \nat the office of the custodian (HSBC Institutional Trust [Asia] Limited). The books and records \nwill be kept in accordance with generally accepted US accounting principles. Periodic reports \ndetailing the financial status of Maculus II\u2019s performance will be provided to the limited partners. \n \n51.  An  international  firm  of  chartered  accountants  will  audit  the  books  and  records  of \nMaculus II annually.  \n \nL.  Exit of ADB\u2019s Investment  \n \n52.  The envisaged exit mechanisms for Maculus II\u2019s investments will vary depending on \nholding  periods,  market  conditions,  expected  future  growth,  tax,  and  other  considerations. \nTypically for debt, the exit route after restructuring in the current climate will be refinancing \nthrough local bank debt or a debenture issue. For equity holdings, exit routes may be to sell the \ninvestment to the original shareholders, other strategic buyers, competitors, or via an initial \npublic offering (IPO). Other exit routes include selling the debt instruments or their derivatives to \nanother investor, asset sales, and repayment from cash flows. \n \n ", "12   \n \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n53.  ADB will enter into a suitable limited partnership agreement with the general partner, \nwhich will indicate ADB\u2019s commitment of up to $25 million (representing 7.62% of paid up \ncapital;  ADB  would  not  be  the  single  largest  investor)  in  the  equity  capital  (i.e.,  limited \npartnership interest) of Maculus II following approval of the proposed investment by ADB\u2019s \nBoard of Directors. ADB has satisfied itself with the terms and conditions of the other principal \ndocuments associated with Maculus II.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n54.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  investment  in  the  ADM  Maculus  Fund  II  L.P.  as \ndescribed in this report would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB and recommend \nthat the Board approve an investment of up to $25,200,000 (or 25% of Maculus II\u2019s total capital, \nwhichever is less, provided that ADB will not be the single largest investor) in the ADM Maculus \nFund II L.P. from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources on terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n05 December 2005 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  ", "  Appendix 1  13 \nPERFORMANCE MEASURES OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES \n \nConcept  Impact  Performance Measures \n(quantitative and/or qualitative) \nBusiness Performance (Fund)  (cid:131)  Overall profitability of  (cid:131)  Gross IRR (database)a \nFinancial objectives   Maculus II and its portfolio  (cid:131)  Net IRR (database) \n  investments \nEconomic Sustainability   (cid:131)  Maculus II\u2019s contribution to  (cid:131)  Number of delinquent \n(Fund and subprojects)  the resolution of NPLs in  borrowers converted to \nEfficient allocation of finance  target countries  current borrowers \nand/or provision of financial \nservices \n  (cid:131)  Demonstration of financially  (cid:131)  Cash flows generated by \nviable and sustainable  Maculus II\u2019s portfolio \ncorporate workouts  investments  \n  (cid:131)  Knowledge transfer in NPL  (cid:131)  Adoption of new technology, \nresolution  systems, and standards for \nNPL resolution by the Fund \n \nDirect contribution to local  (cid:131)  Benefits to investee  (cid:131)  Number of investee \neconomy and living standards  companies and their  companies returning to a \nstakeholders  growth pattern \n \nPrivate Sector Development  (cid:131)  Creation and/or expansion  (cid:131)  Decrease overall NPLs in \nContribution to growth of viable  of corporate workout  target regions \nfinancial institutions and financial  markets in target regions \nmarket development \n  (cid:131)  Demonstration effect for  (cid:131)  Increase in foreign and local \nNPL resolution   financial institutions entering \n  the NPL market \n  (cid:131)  Catalyzing further NPL  (cid:131)  Overall improvement of NPL \nresolution projects  ratio in the financial sectors \n  (cid:131)  Positive effect on the legal  (cid:131)  Quality and volume of the \nand regulatory framework  Fund\u2019s feedback to ADB on \nand its administration  improvement of regulatory \n  environment  \n(cid:131)  Evidence of lobbying by the \nFund for improvement in \nregulatory framework  \n  (cid:131)  Growth in financial services  (cid:131)  Growth in distressed debt \nin regional financial markets  private equity market   \n  (cid:131)  Increased access to long-\nterm finance  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADM = Asia Debt Management, Maculus II = ADM Maculus Fund II, IRR = internal \nrate of return, NPL = nonperforming loan, PSOD = Private Sector Operations Department. \na Performance measures followed by (database) will be monitored regularly in PSOD\u2019s funds database. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20060127140446+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20060127113726+08'00'", "Title": "Proposed Equity Investment in the ADM Maculus Fund II L.P.", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 6.0 for Word", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "Company": "ADB", "SourceModified": "D:20060127032151"}, "author_page": " \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  ADM  \u2013  Asia Debt Management \n  AMC  \u2013  asset management company  \n  EMS  \u2013  environmental management system \n  IPO  \u2013  initial public offering \n  IRR  \u2013  internal rate of return \n  NPL  \u2013  nonperforming loan \n  OM  \u2013  ADB Operations Manual \n  PHP  \u2013  Philippine peso \n  PRC  \u2013  People\u2019s Republic of China \n  PSOD  \u2013  Private Sector Operations Department \n  PSOP  \u2013  Private Sector Operations Division \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVice President  L.
