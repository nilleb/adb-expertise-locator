EGAT  owns  and  operates  the  largest  share  of  Thailand\u2019s  installed  generation \ncapacity  and  is  the  country\u2019s  single  wholesale  purchaser  of  electricity  and  supplier  (as \ntransmission  owner  and  operator)  to  the  country\u2019s  two  state-owned  electricity  distribution \nauthorities\u2014the Metropolitan Electricity Authority and the Provincial Electricity Authority.   \n \n3. \nThe  government  has  opened  access  for  the  private  sector  to  participate  in  the \nfor \nthrough  specific  public\u2013private  partnership \ngeneration  business \nindependent power producers (IPPs), small power producers, and very small power producers. \nThe PPP programs allow private developers to construct, own, and operate power projects and \nenter into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with EGAT with terms up to 25 years. IPPs are \nlarge-scale private power producers with generating capacity greater than 90 megawatts (MW) \nthat utilize conventional energy such as coal and natural gas as fuel. IPPs sell their generation \nto EGAT through PPAs with terms of up to 25 years.1\n Thailand\u2019s IPP program was introduced in \nthe early 1990s to promote competition, enhance efficiency, lower electricity prices, and reduce \nthe government\u2019s financial burden in expanding generation to meet increasing demand.  \n\n(PPP)  programs \n\n \n4. \nIn accordance with the government\u2019s policy to promote private sector participation in the \npower  sector,  EGAT  invited  qualified  generators  in  2007  to  participate  in  the  IPP  bidding \nprocess.  This  was  the  second  IPP  bidding  round  since  the  program  was  initiated  and  the  first \nsince the Asian Financial Crisis.2\n The early engagement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwith IPP bidders and its ability to provide long-term financing was critical, as it allowed Gulf JP \nCompany Limited (Gulf JP) to extend its planning horizon, project financial leverage for a longer \nperiod,  and  bid  a  lower  electricity  tariff.  Gulf  JP\u2019s  competitive  tariff  enabled  its  two  efficient \ncombined cycle natural gas-fired power plants, with combined capacity of 3,200 MW, to contend \nwith proposals of other low-cost generators that use coal as the primary source of fuel.   \n\n                                                \n1  IPPs  are  common  PPPs  for  power  generation.  Under  the  IPP  model,  a  private  sector  developer  finances, \nconstructs, operates, and maintains the power plant. Power is sold to the government offtaker. In this case, EGAT \nis  the  state-owned  utility  that  owns  and  operates  the  majority  of  Thailand\u2019s  electricity  generation  as  well  as  the \ncountry\u2019s  transmission  network.  EGAT  is  Thailand\u2019s  principal  off-taker  and  performs  the  function  of  system \noperator.  EGAT  receives  sovereign  support  from  the  Thai  government.  Through  long  term,  25-year,  take-or-pay \nPPAs, demand risk and fuel-price risk are eliminated for the IPP operator, thus permitting a lower financing cost. \nThis further guarantees stability to private sector participants in the power sector. \n\n2  In  the  first  IPP  bidding  round,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  assistance  to  BLCP  Power  Limited. \nSee ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans and a \nProposed Political Risk Guarantee to BLCP Power Limited. Manila. The project comprised a 1,434 MW coal-fired \npower plant located in Rayong Province, about 200 kilometers southeast of Bangkok. The plant was completed on \n1 February 2007, ahead of schedule, and generates electricity at one of the lowest costs in Thailand.    \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nADB  financed  the  first  Gulf  JP  1,600  MW  IPP  (Nong  Saeng) 3  and  has  been  closely \n5. \ninvolved  in  the  financing  of  the  remaining  1,600  MW  since  2007.  ADB\u2019s  continuing  support  is \ncrucial  to  ensure  implementation  of  the  second  1,600  MW  given  current  difficulty  in  securing \nlong-term  US  dollar  financing  and  the  project\u2019s  sustained  need  for  long-term  private  sector \nfinancing.  The  project  will  complete  the  implementation  of  the  3,200  MW  capacity  secured  by \nGulf  JP  in  the  2007  IPP  solicitation  and  the  new  capacity  will  arrive  at  a  critical  time.  Power \ndemand  continued  to  grow  in  2012 4   and  the  latest  forecasts  indicate  impending  supply \nconstraints toward the end of the decade.5\n The project\u2019s addition of 1,600 MW of capacity will \nhelp  Thailand  maintain  a  reserve  margin  above  the  Ministry  of  Energy\u2019s  critical  threshold  of \n15%.  The  marked  increase  in  installed  fcapacity  offered  by  the  full  Gulf  JP  3,200  MW \ncontribution promotes the stability of overall power supply and broad economic growth.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsor \n\n6. \nGUT is a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Thailand to develop, own, and operate \nthe  project.  GUT  is  a  subsidiary  of  the  sponsor,  which  is  majority-owned  by  JP  Holdings \nThailand,  the  Thai  subsidiary  of  J-POWER.  The  sponsor  also  owns  the  other  1,600 MW  gas-\nfired IPP project selected in the 2007 IPP solicitation (Nong Saeng) that was financed by ADB. \n \n7. \nJ-POWER  supplies  electricity  to  10  major  electric  power  companies  in  Japan.  It  also \nparticipates  in  more  than  327  power  projects  in  64  countries  around  the  world.  It  was \nestablished in 1952 as a special public corporation, was fully privatized in 2004, and is listed on \nthe  Tokyo  Stock  Exchange.  Table  1  summarizes  J-POWER\u2019s  financial  and  operational \nperformance  in  recent  years.  Reflecting  the  nature  of  its  steady  business,  revenues  remained \nrelatively  stable  despite  the  recent  economic  crisis.  In  terms  of  overall  creditworthiness, \nJ-POWER\u2019s long-term rating remains high (para. 6).  \n8. \nWith  over  17%  of  its  generation  capacity  overseas,  J-POWER  considers  overseas \ngeneration to be its next major business domain and seeks to leverage 50 years of generation \nexpertise  and  experience  to  compete  successfully  for  IPP  projects  abroad.6  J-POWER  has  a \nstake in 28 currently-operating IPP projects in the People\u2019s Republic of China; the Philippines; \nPoland; Taipei,China; Thailand; the United States; and Viet Nam\u2014with a total capacity of over \n14,399 MW.7 Opportunities in Asia for IPP projects are increasing as electricity demand grows \nrapidly  throughout the region.  J-POWER made the  strategic  decision to enter the Thai market \nby  partnering  with  local  companies  to  develop,  manage,  and  own  generation  assets.                  \nJ-POWER\u2019s operating power projects in Thailand are listed in Table 2.8\n \n \n \n\n                                                \n3   ADB.  2011.

The project will  improve the reliability of Thailand\u2019s power supply and increase \n9. \nconfidence in the use of PPPs in the power sector. The successful conclusion of the IPP bidding \nround and the financial close and operation of a large-scale PPP will signal growing stability to \nthe market. A major challenge for developing member countries such as Thailand is the need to \nbring  significant  new  sources  of  power  generation  online  to  maintain  economic  growth. \nUnderinvestment  in  the  power  sector  reduces  the  integrity  of  the  system  as  it  becomes  more \nprone  to  power  outages.  Supply  disruptions  are  costly  for  local  businesses  and  discourage \nforeign direct investment. \n \n10. \nOutcome.  The  outcome  will  be  the  provision  of  competitively  priced  and  lower  cost \npower generated from gas-fired technology, which emits substantially less carbon dioxide than \ncoal-fired generation. The utilization of natural gas with combined cycle technology contributes \nto  long-term  sustainable  growth  through  its  higher  efficiencies. 9\n  Compared  with  coal-fired \ngeneration,  the  only  IPP  alternative  for  domestic  base-load generation  in  Thailand,  the  project \nwill avoid more than 3.8 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per annum, as well as dust and \nash  waste.  Cleaner  air  and  a  lower  carbon  footprint  provide  healthier  and  more  sustainable \nliving conditions for central Thailand. Modern forms of energy must be available and affordable \nto  communities,  businesses,  and  households  to  reduce  poverty  and  set  development  on  an \ninclusive  path.  The  project\u2019s  greater  efficiency  and  low  tariff  promotes  greater  accessibility  of \npower to the poor through lower electricity prices. \n \n                                                \n9  The project\u2019s net efficiency is 57.7%, using one of the industry\u2019s most efficient, commercially proven technologies. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nOutput. The output will involve the successful commissioning of a large 1,600 MW IPP \n11. \npower  plant.  The  commissioning  of  the  plant  will  also  mark  the  conclusion  of  the  first  IPP \nbidding round launched since the global financial crisis, bolstering confidence in Thailand as it \nrecovers  from  flood-related  economic  slowdown  and  pursues  economic  development  under \nuncertain  global  market  conditions.  The  financial  close  will  be  made  possible  through  the \npresence  of  ADB  and  the  bilateral  co-lender\u2014  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation \n(JBIC),10 which will secure the long-term financing required for infrastructure assets.11\n  \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n12. \nConsistency  with  Strategy  2020.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020 \nwhich  emphasizes  support  for  achieving  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  growth  through \nenvironmentally  sustainable  development  and  private  sector  development. 12\n  Capitalizing  on \nADB\u2019s core strength of financing infrastructure, the strategy sets forth that ADB will help expand \nthe  supply  of  energy;  promote  energy  efficiency;  support  clean  energy;  and  facilitate  the \nremoval  of  policy,  institutional,  regulatory,  technological,  and  legal  constraints  in  promoting \nefficient  energy  use.  The  strategy  also  aims  to  promote  a  larger  role  for  the  private  sector  in \nfinancing infrastructure by supporting PPP initiatives. \n \n13. \nConsistency  with  Country  Strategy.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  latest  country \npartnership  strategy  for  Thailand,  2007-2011,  as  well  as  the  country  operations  business  plan \n2012-2014,  both  of  which  target  three  core  strategic  areas\u2014infrastructure,  environmental \nsustainability, and capital markets.13\n Thailand prioritizes infrastructure development to enhance \nits  competitiveness  and  support  long-term  growth.  The  government\u2019s  core  challenge  is  to \nensure  that  public  resources  are  used  efficiently  and  effectively.  To  achieve  this,  PPP  models \nare  being  promoted  as  a  means  to  reduce  the  financial  burden,  promote  new  technology, \nensure  timely  construction,  and  achieve  operational  efficiencies.  Catalyzing  investment  in  the \npower  sector  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the  key  opportunities  for  ADB  private  sector \nassistance. The new draft country partnership strategy also affirms ADB\u2019s role in PPPs and the \npower sector.  \n \n14. \nConsistency  with  Sector  Strategy  and  Relevant  ADB  Operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy, 14\n  which  gives  emphasis  to  investments  in  energy \nefficiency,  least-cost  supply,  private  sector  participation,  and  wider  access  to  the  poor.  ADB \nsupports  projects  that  utilize  efficient  technologies  such  as  combined  cycle  and  projects  that \nincorporate  state-of-the-art  emission  control  equipment.  In  addition,  natural  gas  is  a  preferred \nsource of fuel for providing base-load electricity over coal. The energy policy also supports PPP \nmodels  that  enable  the  participation  of  the  private  sector  to  help  achieve  efficiencies  and \nalleviate  pressure  on  public  sector  funds.  Passing  on  the  efficiencies  to  the  consumer,  these \nmodels  help  diminish  financial  constraints,  increase  the  affordability  of  electricity  for  the  poor, \nand contribute to poverty reduction through their broader support for economic growth. \n \n15. \nPrevious  Operations.  In  2003,  ADB  approved  financing  for  the  BLCP  Power  Project \n(footnote 1), a successful conventional power plant in Thailand under the IPP program. In 2009, \n                                                \n10 JBIC is processing a loan in parallel to ADB and its participation is subject to JBIC internal approvals. \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n12  ADB.  2008.

An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was  prepared  in  accordance \nwith  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  has  identified  the  potential  environmental  and  social \nimpacts  and  risks  of  the  project,  including  an  assessment  of  cumulative  air  quality  impacts \ncovering  all  major  projects  in  the  air  shed.  The  EIA  for  the  power  plant  was  approved  on \n17 January  2012  by  the  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment  while  the  EIA  for  the \nnatural gas supply pipeline is under review and evaluation by the ministry. The draft EIA for the \npower  plant  was  posted  on  the  ADB  website  on  4  April  2012.  Under  the  EIA,  Gulf  JP  is \ncommitted  to  post  environmental  and  social  staff  members  to  implement  the  environmental \nmanagement  plan.  Effective  measures  to  avoid  and  minimize,  or  otherwise  mitigate  and \ncompensate  for  adverse  impacts,  are  incorporated  in  the  plan.  A  certified  environmental \nconsultant will implement the environmental monitoring activities and prepare  progress reports \nto be submitted to the ministry and ADB every 6 months to meet ADB compliance requirements. \nThe  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  Gulf  JP  to  manage  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts  are  deemed  adequate.  GUT  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \nStrategy  and  report  regularly  to  ADB  on  compliance  (including  contractors)  with  national  labor \nlaws and adherence to internationally recognized core labor standards.16 Information disclosure \nand consultations with affected people were conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.17\n  \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy   \n\n18. \nGUT was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.
