THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed results-\nbased loan to the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Shaanxi Xi'an Preschool Education \nDevelopment Program. \n \n2.  The proposed program will support the Xi'an Preschool Education Development Plan, \n2019\u20132025 of the Xi'an Municipal Government (XMG) from 2021 to 2025.1 It aims to increase \nchildren's equitable access to high-quality early childhood education (ECE) in a rapidly growing \nmegacity with enrollment below the national average for the PRC and with major disparities in \nquality between its urban and rural areas.2 The program will increase climate-friendly public \nkindergartens; develop teaching capacity; strengthen ECE financing, regulation, and supervision \nmechanisms; and promote and disseminate innovative approaches to improving ECE quality.3 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  Delivering quality ECE is a critical and cost-effective investment: quality ECE sets a strong \nfoundation for learning, universal ECE helps make the entire education system more effective \nand efficient, and equitable ECE promotes economic growth and reduces inequality.4 Compelling \nevidence from the fields of neuroscience, economics, and developmental and behavioral sciences \nhighlights the importance of the early years on human development outcomes and the long-term \neffects of ECE on labor productivity in an increasingly competitive global economy.5 However, to \nrealize the full range of long-term benefits, both the accessibility and quality of ECE programs \nneed to be improved.6 Only high-quality ECE is associated with children's development and \nlearning, with especially strong evidence in the case of disadvantaged children. Process quality, \nincluding the quality of teacher\u2013child interactions and developmental activities, is the primary \ndriver of gains in children's development through ECE.7 \n \n4.  Although the PRC has achieved remarkable success in alleviating poverty, reducing \ninequality remains a complex challenge. In 2018, just 1.7% of the population were below the \nnational poverty line and 0.5% below the international poverty line,8 but the Gini coefficient has \nrisen by 15 points since 1990, to 50, and differences in education are a significant driver of this \ninequality.9 The national government recognizes that promoting equitable access to high-quality \nECE is an effective strategy for inclusive development, and that investing in the human capital of \nits future labor force is key. Ambitious national ECE targets have caused a dramatic increase in \nenrollment over just one decade, from 56.6% in 2010 to 83.4% in 2019. But the PRC has yet to \n \n1  XMG. 2020.

Washington, DC.: International Monetary Fund. \n ", "2 \nattain universal enrollment and lags behind regional neighbors Japan (92%) and the Republic of \nKorea (94%).10 Ensuring both quality and affordability is still a challenge in a system dominated \nby the private provision of ECE. Public funding for ECE is generally insufficient and depends on \nthe management and financing capacity of local governments. \n \n5.  Located in Shaanxi Province, the rapidly growing megacity of Xi'an is facing a major \nshortage of affordable kindergarten places, which threatens to widen the gaps in access and \nperpetuate inequality.11 Despite notable progress in developing ECE since 2010, an estimated \n45.5% of Xi'an's kindergarten-aged children (3\u20135 years old) were still unable to access affordable \nkindergartens in 2019, and pronounced quality disparities persist in the ECE system. This is a \nresult of four key constraints: (i) insufficient places in high-quality public and affordable private \nkindergartens to meet current and projected demand; (ii) insufficient teaching capacity and in-\nservice training opportunities; (iii) a need for better planning, financing, regulation, and supervision \nof ECE, particularly in affordable private kindergartens; and (iv) a lack of innovation to improve \nthe delivery of quality ECE. \n \n6.  Access to affordable kindergartens. With a gross enrollment ratio (GER) in ECE of \n76.0% in 2019, the public provision of ECE in Xi'an has been uneven and reached only 27.6% of \nthe  360,549  children  enrolled.  Private  kindergartens  have  proliferated  to  meet  demand, \naccounting for nearly two-thirds (63.3%) of Xi'an's 1,839 licensed kindergartens and 72.4% of \nenrollment, but with considerable disparities in quality and affordability. Quality disparities are \nparticularly evident between urban and rural areas\u2014fewer than half (48%) of rural kindergartens \nare able to meet the rating system standards to be considered high-quality.12 Outside of the formal \nECE system, about 87,395 children attended 636 unlicensed kindergartens in 2019. These \nchildren are not included in the GER. Informal kindergartens are of variable quality and, being \nunlicensed,  are  outside  the  government's  regulatory  supervision  system.  The  Ministry  of \nEducation has required that all unlicensed kindergarten operations be either brought into the \nformal  and  licensed  ECE system  or closed  down.  Out  of  a  growing concern  over  access, \naffordability, and quality, Xi'an's 12 district and 2 county governments provide subsidies to private \nkindergartens that meet their standards, operate on a nonprofit basis, and keep tuition and other \nfees below a locally defined ceiling. These kindergartens are classified as affordable private \nkindergartens, and they account for 39.8% of all kindergartens and 44% of enrollment. \n \n7.  Teacher supply and qualifications. Women accounted for 98.5% of Xi'an's 37,939 ECE \nteaching staff (70% teachers, 30% childcare staff) in 2019. ECE teachers with a qualified teacher \nstatus certificate teach  as  either  regular  or contractual staff.  Childcare  staff  do  not  hold  a \ncertificate. While public kindergarten teachers are required to hold a certificate, only two-thirds \n(66%) of those in private kindergartens do so. About 11% of teachers hold no qualification higher \nthan a high school diploma, but this average mask urban\u2013rural disparities: 28% of rural teachers \nhave no more than a high school education (78.6% of teachers are in urban areas). Fewer than \n5.3%  of  all  ECE  teachers  are  backbone  teachers.13 Key  challenges  in  teacher  workforce \ndevelopment in Xi'an are (i) a dearth of opportunities for continuing professional development, \n \n10 OECD. 2020. Education at a Glance 2020: OECD Indicators. Paris: OECD Publishing. \n11 By the end of 2019, the population exceeded 10.2 million, an increase of nearly 1.5 million since 2015 a result of \nrelaxing the one-child policy in 2016 and easing the hukou registration system restrictions in 2017. \n12 The rating system indicators cover five domains: physical environment, staffing and workforce development, \nmanagement, specialized care and education, and child development outcomes. A kindergarten is considered high-\nquality when it meets the standards to be rated a provincial demonstration or municipal class I, II, or III kindergarten. \n13 Backbone teachers are highly qualified teachers who have achieved master teacher, subject leader, or elite teacher \ncertification and who mentor less-experienced teachers. \n ", "3 \nespecially in rural areas, where only 12% of teachers had access to in-service training in 2019; \nand (ii) limited on-the-job mentorship and school-based training. \n \n8.  Early childhood education financing and management. Financing for ECE increased \nsignificantly after the issuance in 2018 of the national ECE policy,14 but public spending on ECE \nin 2019 still represented only 0.2% of Xi'an's gross domestic product of CNY932.12 billion, which \nis lower than the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average of \n0.7%. The financial responsibility for developing ECE falls to district and county governments, \nwhich tend to allocate lower budgetary resources to ECE because they give priority to 9-year \ncompulsory education. Average expenditure per ECE pupil in Xi'an reached CNY8,931 in 2019, \nbut the gap between public kindergartens (CNY11,196 per pupil) and private ones (CNY8,067 per \npupil) is considerable. Households bear the cost of ECE in the form of tuition and other fees in \nboth public and private schools, although amounts vary dramatically. In an effort to reduce the \nindividual burden of financing ECE, the government provides financial support for poor children \nat CNY750 per year. In 2019, nearly 88,000 children received this subsidy (16% of children in \npublic kindergartens and 30% of children in affordable private kindergartens). A key management \nchallenge in Xi'an is the inadequate use of information and communication technology systems \nfor ECE planning, regulation, and management. Building a smart, integrated ECE management \ninformation system (MIS) is key to improving data-driven governance. \n \n9.  Innovation to improve quality. National and international best practices in ECE that are \nnot  yet  fully  adopted  in  Xi'an  include  (i)  promoting  professional  learning  communities  and \nmentorship programs for teachers that pair experienced teachers with those requiring support, \n(ii) expanding parent and community engagement to promote positive parenting and a continuum \nof learning between home and school, (iii) strengthening inclusive education for children with \ndisabilities in mainstream kindergartens so they can learn alongside their same-aged peers, and \n(iv) introducing play-based learning and child-centered curriculum reforms that recognize play not \nas an alternative to learning but as the main way that kids learn. National guidelines for play-\nbased pedagogy are not fully implemented, and private kindergartens in particular tend to be \nguided more by parents' preferences than by government policy, or by an understanding of \ndevelopmentally appropriate cognitive, language, and socio-emotional skills for the preschool \nchild. Stepping up parental outreach and disseminating ECE research results are integral parts \nof the innovation that is required to improve ECE quality. \n \n10.  As the share of under-5 children in Xi'an's total population increased from 4.6% in 2015 to \n4.8% in 2019, demand for ECE will continue to grow.15 An estimated 514,400 kindergarten places \nwill be needed by 2025. To meet this demand, drawing on national and provincial ECE policies \nand following the implementation of several 3-year action plans, the XMG issued in July 2020 the \nXi'an Preschool Education Development Plan, 2019\u20132025 (footnote 1). The XMG program's \noverarching goal is to achieve universal, affordable, safe, and high-quality ECE through (i) an \nECE system of sufficient quantity and quality, with geographic balance and serving a public \nwelfare function; (ii) an increase in the proportion of children in public and affordable private \nkindergartens; (iii) a strengthened teacher development system; (iv) an integrated ECE MIS to \nimprove  management  and  accountability;  (v)  enhanced  financing  mechanisms;  and  (vi)  a \nmechanism for kindergarten cooperation and resource exchanges. \n \n \n14 Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and State Council. 2018.

Rationale, strategic priorities, and lessons. The program rationale is to help the XMG \naddress key ECE issues with a focus on areas where the Asian Development Bank (ADB) can \nadd the most value. The program was developed in alignment with the strategic priority of \nsupporting inclusive economic growth under the ADB country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 \nfor the PRC.16 Education is no longer a strategic priority under the current country partnership \nstrategy (approved in March 2021), and the program, which experienced preparation delays due \nto COVID-19, will be the last stand-alone operation in the education sector. The program will \nsupport several operational priorities of Strategy 2030:17 (i) addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities\u2014by improving access to quality ECE; (ii) accelerating progress in gender \nequality\u2014by promoting women's labor force participation and creating new jobs and leadership \nroles for women; and (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and \nenhancing environmental sustainability\u2014by adopting climate change mitigation and adaptation \nmeasures and managing seismic risk. The program reflects lessons from three ADB results-based \nlending (RBL) programs in the PRC\u2019s education sector, and from ADB and other development \npartners' ECE experience.18 These lessons include the importance of (i) delineating the roles of \nnational,  provincial,  and local  governments  as  well  as  the  private sector;  (ii) strengthening \nprogram monitoring and management systems; (iii) introducing effective models of ECE delivery \nand financing; and (iv) innovating through play-based pedagogical approaches, professional \nlearning communities for teachers, and parenting education for caregivers (footnote 15). \n \n12.  Program modality. The nature of ECE reforms in Xi'an requires a comprehensive, \nsystem-based approach. The government's ECE reform agenda, which the program supports, is \nextensive, covering about 2,400 kindergartens, 31,900 ECE teaching staff, 12 districts, and \n2 counties. The government shows strong ownership of the program, providing 87.83% of the \ntotal  financing,  and  a  commitment  to  results-based  planning  and  management  for  system \nimprovement and institutional strengthening. This has been demonstrated in ongoing education \nRBL programs in the PRC. RBL leverages counterpart resources under a single results framework \nand expands the development impact of ADB financing, which accounts for only 6.74% of the \ntotal program financing. The due diligence assessments provide assurance for the effective \nachievement of results through the program, and measures to strengthen government systems \nthat will be used for program implementation are built into its design. Unlike a project loan where \ndisbursement is expenditure based, the use of RBL will ensure a high level of emphasis on better \nservice quality and capacity-building activities where ADB involvement adds particular value. \n \n13.  ADB's value addition. ADB will add value by (i) driving policy and system reforms aligned \nwith the national ECE policy, (ii) promoting equity in the provision of ECE to address differential \nfinancing and quality, (iii) demonstrating effective models of ECE provision that differentiate rural \nand urban needs, and (iv) improving data management. ADB worked with the XMG to strengthen \nthe program, introducing results-based management in the ECE system and a focus on quality \nand innovation. Drawing on more than 25 years of engagement in the PRC focused on policy \nsupport,  strategy  development,  institutional  strengthening,  capacity  building,  and  extensive \n \n16 ADB. 2016.

The RBL program's impact will be: universal, affordable, safe, and high-quality ECE in \nXi'an developed (footnote 1). The outcome will be: equitable access to high-quality ECE in Xi'an \nexpanded, with three disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) (para. 21). There are four outputs.22 \n \n16.  Output 1: Climate-friendly public kindergartens increased. The program will provide \nat least 50,000 new public kindergarten places across Xi'an's 12 districts and 2 counties (DLI 4), \nspatially distributed to match demand. New public kindergartens will comply with the Shaanxi \nprovincial standards for green building labels and will satisfy the one-star green building standard \nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions.23 Climate change adaptation measures include stormwater \nmanagement networks. The program will upgrade at least 50 existing kindergartens with energy-\nefficient and environment-friendly materials, and supply better equipment with environmental \nprotection labels to at least 200 kindergartens. \n \n17.  Output 2: Early childhood education teaching capacity developed. The program will \n(i) recruit at least 5,400 new teaching staff (95% to women);24 (ii) ensure that at least 25% of urban \nand rural teachers each year are able to attend different types of in-service training (national, \nprovincial, or municipal short-term, long-term, or online programs) and report improved capacity; \nand (iii) boost leadership roles for ECE staff (DLI 5) by supporting at least 452 teachers (at least \n99% of them women) to become backbone teachers (master teachers, subject leaders, and elite \nteachers), an increase of 33.4%. This will bring direct benefits to women through better jobs, \nhigher status, and increased eligibility for promotion. The 1,810 backbone teachers will each \nprovide on-the-job mentorship to up to 20 less-experienced teachers each year, to reach about \n36,200 teachers. Innovations to improve ECE teaching capacity, including professional learning \ncommunities and improved capacity for inclusive education, are described in output 4. \n \n18.  Output  3:  Early  childhood  education  financing,  regulation,  and  supervision \nmechanisms strengthened. The program will strengthen the ECE financing system by ensuring \nthat districts and counties provide adequate per-pupil financing. This output will improve the \nimplementation  of  regulations  and quality standards  by  reducing the  number  of  unlicensed \nkindergartens (DLI 6). The program team will support better ECE data management by developing \nan  upgraded  and  integrated  ECE  MIS  (DLI  7),  key  to  the  goal  of  improving  data-driven \ngovernance. The ECE MIS will be part of a smart education platform that manages data on ECE \npupils and their families, staff, and classes; and connects kindergarten facilities to enable better \nplanning, supervision, and management of ECE resources and reporting of results. All data will \nbe disaggregated by sex and ethnicity. \n \n \n22 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n23 The XMG defined standards and specifications for green building design that include energy efficiency, and designed \na green credit support for energy-saving and green building projects that meet the requirements. \n24 Women currently account for more than 98% of ECE teaching staff. The target of 95% allows for the possibility of \nreducing the gender imbalance by recruiting more men. \n ", "7 \n19.  Output 4: Innovation to improve early childhood education quality promoted and \ndisseminated. The program team will support five areas of ECE innovation for demonstration \nand potential replication by (i) expanding and evaluating professional learning communities that \npair 30 backbone teachers and principals as mentors with at least 750 teachers and principals in \nlower-rated kindergartens; (ii) piloting, evaluating, and rolling out play-based learning reforms \n(DLI 8)  in  at  least  50  kindergartens,  applying  international  best  practice  in  pedagogical \napproaches to engaging children in learning while at play; (iii) selecting, funding, and completing \nat least 32 innovative ECE research projects, with results evaluated by an ECE expert panel and \nwidely disseminated through university networks; (iv) establishing at least 200 demonstration \nkindergartens for home\u2013kindergarten partnerships; and (v) promoting inclusive education by \nestablishing  and  equipping  resource  classrooms  for  children  with  disabilities,  and  training \nteachers in at least 63 mainstream kindergartens. \n \n20.  Beneficiaries. The program's direct beneficiaries will be Xi'an's preschool-aged children \n(3\u20135 years old), expected to total 514,400 by 2025, and their families (especially mothers, and \nincluding  migrant  and low-income families).  Other  direct  beneficiaries will  be  an  estimated \n67,136 ECE teachers, childcare staff, principals, and administrative staff (52,442 staff in 2019, \nand an estimated 14,694 to be recruited), a very large majority of whom are women (90.7% in \n2019). Broader benefits to the economy and society are expected in the long term from higher \nlabor productivity and less inequality thanks to improved ECE. \n \n21.  Eight DLIs with ambitious targets from the program results framework will be the basis for \ndisbursing  ADB financing. To  emphasize  indicators  critical for  achieving  the  RBL  program \noutcome, 60% of the ADB financing is allocated to three outcome-level DLIs. By the end of the \nprogram, equitable access to ECE will have improved thanks to an increase in the share of \nchildren with access to affordable kindergartens\u2014from 76% in 2019 to 85% in 2025. ECE quality \nwill improve through more teacher\u2013child interactions, and an increase from 63% to 70% in the \nshare of kindergartens meeting high-quality standards under the Shaanxi and Xi'an kindergarten \nquality rating systems.25 The output DLIs at 40% of total financing capture greater teaching \ncapacity; stronger regulation, planning, and management; and more innovation in quality ECE \ndelivery.

The  annual  DLI  targets,  verification  protocols,  and  disbursement  schedule  are  in \nAppendix 3. The verification protocols include independent third-party verification of most DLIs, \nwhile the verification of two DLIs will be based on statistical data from the ECE system subject to \nsufficiently robust internal controls of the Xi'an Education Bureau (XEB) and the XMG audit. XEB \nhas taken significant steps in 2020, prior to program approval, to ensure a successful program \noutcome, and has requested financing for prior results against this progress. A key 2020 activity \nhas been to bring all unlicensed kindergartens under the government's supervisory and regulatory \nsystems (DLI 6), while incremental progress in access to affordable ECE under DLI 1 is essential \nto meeting the target. Due diligence confirms that these results are within the scope of the \nprogram supported by the RBL, are suitable as DLIs, and are subject to agreed verification \nprotocols. ADB supervision missions will review the achievement of the DLIs, assess the program \nprogress, and discuss annual work plans and budgets.  \n \nE.  Expenditure Framework and Financing Plan \n \n23.  Program expenditures. The RBL program expenditures are estimated to be \u20ac1.87 billion \nfrom 2021 to 2025 (Table 3).  \n \nTable 3: Summary of Program Expenditure Framework, 2021\u20132025 (in 2020 prices) \nAmount  Share of Total \nItem  (\u20ac million)  (%) \nA.

The government will finance \u20ac1.64 billion, while households (through \ntuition and other fees) will contribute \u20ac101.48 million. The government requested a regular loan \nof \u20ac125.89 million ($150 million equivalent) from ADB's ordinary capital resources to help finance \nthe program.26 The loan will have a 26-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft loan and program agreements. Based on the straight-line method, the average \nmaturity is 15.75 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.30% per year. Relending \nto provincial governments and onlending to municipal governments will be on the same terms and \nconditions applicable to the government.

Disbursement arrangements, advance financing, and financing for prior results. \nDisbursement will be made in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as \namended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between the government and \nADB, following verified DLI achievement in accordance with the DLI verification protocol, on or \nbefore the program completion date. Partial disbursement will be made in accordance with the \nverification protocol. To support the launch and timely achievement of reforms, the government \nrequested ADB to provide advance financing of 13.33% of its loan (\u20ac16.78 million). DLI 1 and \nDLI 6 will have financing for prior results. Up to 25% of the loan can be made available for advance \nfinancing upon loan effectiveness, and up to 20% can be made available for financing for prior \nresults against the stated prior-result target met by the borrower within 12 months before the \nsigning date of the legal agreement for the program. The maximum allowed for the combined \nadvance financing plus financing for prior results is 30%, with neither exceeding its respective \nceiling. Before the disbursement of the loan proceeds, the XMG will prepare and submit to ADB, \nafter  seeking  internal  approvals,  withdrawal  applications  along  with  the  requisite  evidence \nsupporting DLI achievement in accordance with the verification protocols. \n \nF.  Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n26.  The program includes actions to ensure the achievement of its outcome and measures to \nsolve access issues in public and affordable private kindergartens. It will strengthen program \nsystems\u2014monitoring and evaluation (M&E), fiduciary, and safeguards\u2014and gender and social \ninclusion. The capacity development activities are listed in the PAP. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n27.  The XMG is the executing agency and XEB is the implementing agency. A program \nmanagement office will implement and manage the program in coordination with 14 county and \ndistrict education bureaus (CEBs). XEB convened an ECE expert panel to provide technical \nguidance. For strategic guidance and direction, the XMG's program leading group comprises \nrepresentatives  of  the  Xi'an  Finance  Bureau,  Xi'an  Municipal  Development  and  Reform \nCommission, XEB, and each of the district and county governments. The program will use local \nfiduciary and safeguard systems and existing financial management systems to manage the loan \nproceeds. XEB and the CEBs will procure civil works, goods, and services following the PRC \nprocurement laws and regulations. The Shaanxi Provincial Finance Department will oversee the \nprogram's financial management arrangements, and the Shaanxi Provincial Audit Office will be \nresponsible for the audit of the RBL program's financial statements. The program implementation \nperiod will be from 1 May 2021 to the loan closing date of 30 June 2026. \n   \n ", "10 \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n28.  The XMG's program aims to implement the national ECE policy (footnote 14) through a \nbroad range of activities. Program technical assessments concluded that Xi'an's ECE system \nneeds reforms to (i) solve ECE access issues beyond building new kindergartens; (ii) expand and \nstrengthen teacher capacity, while reducing high teacher turnover; (iii) improve the management \nand supervision of public and private ECE providers; and (iv) support teaching staff in improving \nchildren's learning and developmental outcomes through innovative approaches. The program \nresults framework, the DLIs, and the PAP incorporate these findings. An analysis of historical and \npredicted revenues, budgets, expenditures, and results in the past several years confirms that \nthe program expenditure framework and financing plan is robust. Due diligence confirms that the \nprogram design and implementation arrangements are sound, the results framework is designed \nwell, and the DLIs are critical indicators for achieving program results. \n \n29.  Economic  analysis.  The  core  economic  rationale  for  investing  in  ECE  lies  in  its \nempirically demonstrated positive impact on labor productivity, economic growth, and inequality \n(para. 3). Returns to investment in ECE are high: one landmark long-term study of a program for \nchildren aged 3\u20135 years in the United States estimated a return to society of about $7\u2013$12 for \neach $1 invested.27 In the PRC, an analysis of the long-term benefits of participation in ECE in \nYunnan Province finds strong statistical evidence that ECE is associated with higher educational \nattainment and greater labor force participation (footnote 6). Public intervention in ECE is justified \nbecause of equity concerns regarding the quality and cost of ECE. Inequality starts in early \nchildhood and tends to widen as children get older. Ample empirical evidence shows that the \nbenefits of quality ECE last a lifetime, providing a basis for human capital accumulation, higher \nlabor productivity, and increased earnings. Research also shows that ECE boosts women's \nemployment options and reduces the intergenerational transmission of inequality and poverty. \nOther economic benefits of the program will result from (i) the engagement of 14,694 additional \nteaching, administrative, and other kindergarten staff; (ii) stronger employment prospects and \nlivelihoods of parents and other persons released from full-time care duties; and (iii) reduced \ngreenhouse gas emissions thanks to building and operating more climate-friendly kindergartens. \n \n30.  Poverty, social, and gender. The program has a strong social inclusion and gender focus \nand is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. It will particularly benefit vulnerable children \nfrom  low-income  and migrant  families,  children  with  disabilities,  or children  whose  primary \ncaregivers are not their parents. Gender analysis revealed that childcare tasks are shared by both \nparents in just 30% of households, because of both traditional gender roles and a low awareness \nof the importance of fathers' involvement in their young children's socialization. As a result of \ngender stereotypes, men are underrepresented in the ECE workforce. Women account for 98.5% \nof teaching staff, but for only 91.5% of principals, and teachers lack access to in-service training. \nTeacher  turnover  is  an  issue,  especially  in  private  kindergartens.  The  awareness  of  the \nimportance of gender sensitivity in the design of the curriculum, teaching and learning materials, \nand evaluation is rather low. The program results framework, design and monitoring framework, \nDLIs, and PAP set gender targets and actions, such as creating skilled jobs for women as teachers, \nexpanding access to different types of in-service training, expanding leadership roles for women \nas  backbone  teachers,  involving  fathers  in  parenting  programs,  ensuring  gender-sensitive \ncurriculum and materials, and designing an MIS that includes sex-disaggregated data.

To promote \ninclusion, the program will increase affordable kindergarten places, support resource classrooms, \ntrain teachers on including children with disabilities in mainstream ECE, and ensure that home\u2013\nkindergarten partnerships include outreach to grandparents and other non-parent caregivers. \nPlay-based learning will foster inclusive and equitable attitudes and behaviors that promote \ndiversity and inclusion, in line with national guidelines. \n \n31.  Coronavirus disease  impact  and response. The coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19) \noutbreak in Xi'an was at its peak in January\u2013March 2020, when all schools and kindergartens \nclosed. Primary and middle schools were able to return to in-person classes by April 2020, and \nkindergartens reopened by June. Xi'an recorded zero cases of COVID-19 in kindergartens, which \nfollow strict prevention and control measures. As of September 2020, with no cases of local \ntransmission for more than 4 months, kindergartens were back to normal operations, while still \nfully implementing infection control measures and with contingency plans in place at all levels. \nCOVID-19 has led to a new kindergarten design that includes more handwashing stations, \nupgraded sanitation facilities, and better ventilation systems, which the program will support. \n \n32.  Climate  change  impact  and  geophysical  risk.  The  climate  risk  and  vulnerability \nassessment finds the overall climate change impact on the program to be low, but identifies \nprojected temperature increases, intense precipitation, and stormwater-related flooding as risks. \nAdaptation  options for the  kindergartens to  be supported  under  output  1  include  improved \nstormwater  management  practices.  Mitigation  measures  include  green  building  design  and \noperation to reduce energy consumption. By adopting one-star green building standards and \nincreasing the green areas of kindergartens, the program will reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nby 9,631.09 tons per year.28 The program will also support energy and water conservation and \nenvironmental awareness activities in kindergartens. New kindergarten sites will avoid disaster-\nprone areas. All facilities to be constructed will be designed in accordance with the technical \ncodes and regulations on seismic design. The kindergartens will formulate earthquake emergency \nplans prior to operation. The program's geophysical risk is low. \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n33.  Monitoring and evaluation system. The program M&E system assessment confirms that \nthe M&E arrangements for ECE are generally robust, since most data is available in the annual \nwork reports prepared by XEB under the national ECE  statistical reporting and supervision \nframework.29 However, weaknesses include (i) a lack of reliable data on the cohort of children \naged 3\u20135 (requiring a proxy indicator to calculate the GER); (ii) a lack of data on children who \nexperience difficulty in accessing kindergarten; and (iii) a system that is not fully automated for \ndata capture and collation, which is inefficient. The program will design, test, and roll out an \nupgraded ECE MIS that collects data disaggregated by sex and ethnicity, to cover all public and \nprivate kindergartens (DLI 7). The PAP requires a detailed study of vulnerable children's chances \nof access to ECE. The independent verification agency will develop a verification methodology \nfor each DLI, to be agreed with ADB, to ensure credibility. The selection of the independent \nverification agency will require ADB's prior approval to ensure capacity and the absence of a \n \n28 Climate Change Assessment, and Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n29 Program Monitoring and Evaluation System Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \nprovides further information on the indicators used to assess ECE performance. \n ", "12 \nconflict  of  interests.  The  verification  agency's  terms  of  reference  are  in  the  program \nimplementation document (PID).30 \n \n34.  Fiduciary systems. The program will use the PRC's fiduciary systems for financial \nmanagement,  procurement,  and  anticorruption  measures.  The  program  fiduciary  systems \nassessment confirms the existence of an adequate and strong financial management system in \nthe local governments and kindergartens that are part of the program, with sound and integrated \nbudgeting, payment, accounting, and auditing procedures and practices. The assessment deems \nthe risk level to be moderate. It also confirms that the government's procurement system is aligned \nwith the core procurement principles of the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from \ntime to time). XEB and the CEBs have well-established procurement management systems. The \nmain types of procurement will be civil works for buildings, kindergarten fittings and furniture, \nequipment for teaching and learning, and professional services. The program will exclude high-\nvalue  procurement  packages  and  contracts.  The  Guidelines  to  Prevent  or  Mitigate  Fraud, \nCorruption,  and  Other  Prohibited  Activities  in  Results-Based  Lending  for  Programs  were \nexplained to and discussed with the national and provincial government and the XMG.31 \n \n35.  Safeguard systems. The program's safeguard categorization is B for environment and \ninvoluntary resettlement, and C for indigenous peoples. Output 1 will involve civil works on \ncollective or state-owned land or within existing kindergarten premises that may have temporary \nand site-specific environmental impacts or potential involuntary resettlement impacts. Outputs 2\u2013\n4 will not trigger environmental or involuntary resettlement impacts. Considering the nature and \nsize of the kindergarten facilities to be included under the program, the environmental and social \nimpacts are deemed not significant.32 Any activities categorized as A are excluded from the \nprogram. Ethnic minorities accounted for 0.96% of Xi'an's population in 2019. Among the roughly \n95,600 individuals, 68% are Hui, 11% are Man, and 5% are Mongolian.33 Ethnic minority children \nmake up 0.94% of kindergarten enrollment, proportional to their prevalence in the population, \nindicating no differential access to ECE. The Hui maintains a cultural identity associated with their \nIslamic religion but do not maintain a separate language and have adapted to the dominant social, \neconomic, and political systems. As the program will benefit all kindergartens in Xi'an and the \nGER will reach 99.5%, no differentiated impact on minorities is expected. The program safeguard \nsystems  assessment  confirms  that  the  program  is  likely  to  pose  only  low-to-moderate \nenvironmental and social risks, and that XEB and the CEBs have adequate regulations, technical \ncapacity, and implementation practices for managing environmental and social risks.34 \n \n36.  The safeguard systems assessment identifies gaps related to institutional arrangements \nand staffing for managing the program safeguard systems, implementation monitoring, and \ndocumentation of stakeholder consultations and grievances. Agreed actions include (i) building \ncapacity in XEB and CEBs with dedicated staff for managing safeguard risks; (ii) establishing a \nlocally  accessible  grievance  redress  mechanism  and  procedures  to  document  stakeholder \nconsultation and information disclosure; (iii) providing safeguards training to staff, contractors, \nand  construction  supervision  companies;  (iv)  defining  a  screening  process  to  categorize \nsubprojects and exclude any with category A impacts; (v) preparing environmental assessment \ndocuments for subprojects with civil works in accordance with the specific requirements in the \n \n30 Program Implementation Document (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 ADB. 2013.

Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n \n37.  The RBL program risk is assessed as moderate. The benefits and impacts are expected \nto outweigh the costs.

Study the differences in access to public and affordable private kindergartens for girls and boys and vulnerable \nchildren (left-behind children, migrant children, children with disabilities, children from low-income families) with \nresults disaggregated by sex, ethnicity, geographic area, and economic status; and based on the results prepare \nan action plan to improve access where needed (Q3 2021\u2013Q2 2022). \n2.  Support innovative government-funded ECE research projects and ensure that findings and results (with sex-\ndisaggregated data where meaningful) are shared widely through workshops, conferences, and/or publications \n(Q2 2021\u2013Q4 2025). \n3.  Issue plans and content for inclusive home\u2013kindergarten partnerships that support, for example, grandparents \nas caregivers, fathers' involvement, and lectures or programs for positive parenting (Q3 2021\u2013Q3 2022). \n4.  Following the guidelines for establishing and equipping resource classrooms to create inclusive kindergartens, \ntrain ECE teachers and childcare staff in the use of equipment and learning materials for children with special \nneeds (Q4 2021\u2013Q4 2025). \n5.  Develop gender-sensitive curriculum and training materials that avoid or minimize gender bias and stereotyping \nfor (i) all in-service training programs, and (ii) play-based education reforms (Q4 2021\u2013Q4 2025). \n6.  Evaluate, including from a gender perspective, professional learning communities and mentorship programs \nimplemented in Xi'an to capture and disseminate results and lessons (Q4 2021\u2013Q2 2022). \n7.  Undertake a survey of ECE teacher and childcare staff's working conditions (including salaries and benefits) in \npublic and private kindergartens to understand teacher turnover issues and to develop actions to promote \nretention and attractiveness of the profession for men and women (Q4 2021\u2013Q2 2022). \nSafeguards actions \n8.  Assign safeguards staff at XEB and all CEBs to coordinate and manage involuntary resettlement and \nenvironmental safeguard actions (within 3 months of loan effectiveness). \n9.  Deliver adequate training on environmental and involuntary resettlement safeguards to all staff involved in \nsafeguards implementation at XEB, CEBs, relevant bureaus, contractors, and construction supervision \ncompanies (Q2 2021\u2013Q1 2025). \n10. Prepare environmental and involuntary resettlement safeguard documentation to fill gaps identified in the \nprogram safeguard systems assessment and ensure implementation of the safeguard provisions in accordance \nwith the national and local regulations, ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) principles, and specific \nrequirements in the program implementation document (Q2 2021\u2013Q4 2025). \n11. Submit environmental and resettlement semiannual monitoring reports to ADB during program implementation \n(Q2 2021\u2013Q4 2025). \nFiduciary actions \n12. Incorporate financial management and governance in all kindergarten management training programs \n(Q2 2021\u2013Q4 2025). \n13. Ensure that XEB provides a guidance note that includes clear deadlines for submission of financial statements to \nCEBs (Q3 2021\u2013Q3 2025). \n14. Ensure all staff involved in procurement receive adequate training (Q2 2021\u2013Q4 2025). \n15.
