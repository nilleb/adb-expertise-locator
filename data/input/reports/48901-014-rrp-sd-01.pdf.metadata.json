Project Description \n1.  This Project introduces drip irrigation1 and improved rainwater harvesting2 technologies to a 720 \nhectare demonstration farm in Battambang Province in Cambodia (the \u201cmodel farm\u201d) with the aim of \ndisseminating climate resilient farming methods to local farming communities. The model farm has been \ndeveloped as a training centre for approximately 4,000 local farmers with landholdings in the surrounding \nregion (typically 2 hectare plots), and farmers use the facility to learn about new agricultural practices and \ntechnologies for growing high-value crops (such as organic spices). Using knowledge gained from the \nmodel farm (including rainwater harvesting and drip irrigation technology), local farmers are beginning to \ncultivate the surrounding land, estimated at approximately 20,000 hectares. Farms in the region are \ntypically rain-fed for 7-8 months a year, and irrigation is needed to cover the 4-5 month dry season. Using \ndrip irrigation fed from harvested rainwater, farmers will be able to irrigate year round without having to \nextract water from irrigation canals, lakes, rivers or groundwater reserves. Under the proposed \u201coutgrower \nscheme\u201d, the developer of the model farm, Akay Cambodia Limited (\u201cAkay Cambodia\u201d) will act as an \nofftaker for local produce and will export processed products to international markets, primarily in China, \nthe US and Japan.  \n \n2.  PPCR funds will be used for (i) a loan to Akay Cambodia for capital expenditure for establishing \ndemonstration drip irrigation and rainwater harvesting ponds on the model farm ($1 million concessional \nloan), and (ii) a loan to Akay Cambodia for on-lending to local farmers to pay for the capital outlay and \n1.                                                        \n1 Drip irrigation, also known as trickle irrigation or micro irrigation or localized irrigation, is an irrigation method that saves \nwater and fertilizer by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants, either onto the soil surface or directly onto the root \nzone, through a network of valves, pipes, tubing, and emitters.  \n2 Rainwater harvesting is the collection and storage of rainwater for reuse before it reaches groundwater systems such as aquifers. \nThe harvested water can be used for irrigation, drinking water and other purposes. \n ", " \ninstallation costs for rainwater harvesting ponds and drip irrigation systems for individual farms, and also \npotentially for additional agricultural inputs such as high quality seeds, plants, fertilizers and pesticides \n($4 million concessional loan to Akay Cambodia, to be administered by Akay Cambodia and/or a local \nfinancial  intermediary).  Akay  Cambodia  will  support  these  investments  with  technical  assistance \nadministered through the model farm in line with its normal operations as a learning and resource facility. \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  in  parallel  with  a  commercial  loan  from  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector \nOperations Department to Akay Cambodia of $4.5 million for: (i) purchasing additional agricultural \nequipment for the model farm ($1.5 million loan), and (ii) building a spice processing plant in Phnom \nPenh to handle the increased volume of raw produce ($3 million loan)3. The Agence Fran\u00e7aise de \nD\u00e9veloppement (AFD) is also considering financing support to Akay Cambodia\u2019s outgrower scheme4. \n \n3.  The project is currently at an advanced stage of readiness. The project developer is suitably \npositioned to deploy the additional capital resources, and has been planning an expansion of their \nCambodian operations for the last 12 months. Following PPCR Sub-Committee\u2019s approval, ADB expects \nto approach its board for approval for PPCR and ADB resources in Q3 2014, and would likely start \ndeploying funds by the end of 2014. The model farm has already piloted the use of rainwater harvesting \nponds with a high degree of success, and is looking to expand this element of the project along with the \nintroduction of drip irrigation systems.  \n \nObjectives and expected outcomes \n4.  The  project  aims  to  kick-start  the  adoption  of  rainwater  harvesting  and  drip  irrigation \ntechnologies in Cambodia coupled with high-value crop production such that farming can be conducted \nyear-round without having to extract river, lake or groundwater resources. Agriculture in Cambodia is \ndominated by rice farming, and there is a strong need to diversify the sector, particularly towards growing \nhigher value crops. More broadly, the project aims to introduce a financially sustainable, road-tested \nprivate sector agri-business model that promotes export-oriented, high revenue-generating agricultural \nactivity built on the principles of climate resilience, environmental sustainability and pursuing mutual \nbenefits between local communities and agribusiness developers. The project aims to boost the climate \nresilience of Cambodia\u2019s agricultural sector (the Tonle Sap Lake Floodplain in particular), and leapfrog \ntraditional inefficient furrow irrigation and hand-watering techniques. \n \n5.  By providing capital for both model systems and on-lending, the project aims to demonstrate that \nfarming revenues can be increased through improved water management practices and technologies. \nThese will deliver better crop yields at lower cost, whilst protecting against future potential impacts of \nclimate change (mainly drought induced crop failures). The model farm provides an effective real-world \ntool for farmers to learn about new technologies, new varieties of crops and organic farming methods. It \nis expected that by demonstrating the success of the business model (and de-risking it in the context of \nCambodia), farmers, financiers, and agribusiness developers in other parts of the country will likely \nreplicate the model.  \n \n6.  The broader objectives of the project are: \n\uf0b7  To alleviate crop failures caused by rainfall shortages; \n\uf0b7  To enhance food security and support efforts to reduce poverty; \n1.                                                        \n3 This is part of a larger intervention by ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department that will also provide a $10 million loan to \nAkay Flavours & Aromatics Pvt. Ltd. for expansion of Akay Group\u2019s processing facilities in India. The ADB team received \nconcept clearance for a non-sovereign assistance to the Akay Group in January 2014. In March 2014, the ADB team conducted a \ncommercial, technical, environmental, and social due diligence in India (Cochin) and Cambodia (Battambang farm and Phnom \nPenh). The ADB Board approval for the proposed non-sovereign assistance in India and Cambodia is scheduled on July 2014. \n4 AFD support is under processing and would be complementary to ADB\u2019s proposal \n2 \n ", " \n\uf0b7  To improve agricultural practices, crop yields and productivity in Cambodia by demonstrating the \nuse of efficient and climate-proofed water resource management technologies (drip irrigation and \nrainwater harvesting); \n\uf0b7  To build the climate resilience of Cambodia's agricultural private sector, protecting businesses \nand livelihoods from the negative effects of climate variability and change; \n\uf0b7  To promote crop diversification and the use of high value, drought resistant crops to stimulate \neconomic development and improve the income and livelihood of rural communities; \n\uf0b7  To support initiatives to lessen the environmental impact of farming; \n\uf0b7  To promote south \u2013 south cooperation on climate resilience projects and business ideas including \nthe transfer of capital, knowledge, capacity building, and market infrastructure; and \n\uf0b7  To raise awareness among private actors in the agricultural sector of the importance of investing \nin products/services that enhance the climate resilience of their operations. \n \nII.  Context and market \nCountry context \n \n7.  Cambodia is one of the most disaster-prone countries in Southeast Asia and is affected by floods \nand droughts on a seasonal basis. It is ranked 8th highest on the World Risk Index for vulnerability to the \nimpacts of climate change5. This vulnerability is linked to Cambodia\u2019s characteristics as a post-civil war, \nleast developed, predominantly agrarian state. Agriculture directly contributes to 32% of gross domestic \nproduct and employs 60% of the workforce, while 80% of the population depends on the sector for their \nlivelihood. Weak adaptive capacity, poor infrastructure and limited institutions exacerbate the country\u2019s \nvulnerability to climate variability and change, and there is a strong need to build resilience in the \nagricultural sector due to its critical role in supporting the country. Despite this situation, climate change \nproblems in Cambodia are predominantly addressed through post-disaster relief operations after extreme \nweather events and there appears to be a lack of longer term planning and building of climate resilience6. \n \n8.  The economic value of Cambodia\u2019s main agricultural region, the Tonle Sap Lake Floodplain, is \narguably among the highest provided to a nation by a single ecosystem around the world. The Mekong \nriver drains 86% of Cambodia and provides 60% of the water for the Tonle Sap plains. However, the \nMekong  River  Basin  is  changing  rapidly  due  to  accelerating  water  infrastructure  development \n(hydropower, irrigation, flood control, and water supply) and climate change, bringing considerable \nmodifications to the flood pulse of the Tonle Sap Lake and the local hydrological balance. Changes in \nclimate are also expected to increase the variability of rainfall in Cambodia, thus making irrigation even \nmore important to agricultural production (monsoon rain accounts for between 80-90 percent of the \ncountry\u2019s annual precipitation). Agriculture in Cambodia is dominated by smallholder rice farming, which \nabsorbs 90% of total cultivated land, albeit often with very low yields and for subsistence farming only7. \nThus there is a strong need to diversify Cambodian agriculture, especially towards high-value cash crops \nsuch as spices. \n \n9.  Notwithstanding  these  challenges,  Cambodia  has  strong  potential  to  become  a  large-scale \nproducer of high value crops including spices due to its fertile soils and tropical monsoon climate. \nFarmers are experienced in basic small-scale farming practices, but lack access to productivity enhancing \ninputs such as seeds, water, technology, information and training. Furthermore, few have access to \nguaranteed and profitable markets for their output. The majority of local farmers in the project\u2019s province \n1.                                                        \n5 http://www.worldriskreport.com/ \n6 United Nations Development Program, 2011.

Manila. \n3 \n ", " \nare ex-soldiers who were allocated 2 hectares of land each by the government in an effort to turn \u201cguns \ninto ploughshares.\u201d Farmers are typically poor, uneducated and depend only on rice, corn or cassava \ncultivation, which provides low levels of income and leaves farmers vulnerable to price volatility due to \nthe low diversification of crops.  \n \nMarket context \n \n10.  Farms in Cambodia are typically rain fed for 7-8 months each year and experience rainwater \nshortages for 4-5 months during the dry season from January to April. The majority of rice production in \nCambodia is based on rain fed lowland cropping systems, where rice is grown over the wet season, and \nfields are left to fallow over the dry season8. Traditional irrigation techniques depend primarily on low \nefficiency methods of furrow/surface irrigation9 and hand watering.  \n \n11.  The existing irrigation infrastructure and practice in Cambodia is largely a legacy of the Khmer \nRouge. During their rule in the late 1970s, a network of canals, ditches and dykes for furrow irrigation \nwas built across the country with little regard to hydrology. The lack of topographic survey and poor \nconstruction standards of canals often meant that controlling flows was difficult and higher areas were \noften drained of water, leaving them prone to drought and crop failure. The canal network required \nconstant attention for operation and maintenance. Now in 2014, irrigation practices have improved in \nsome areas, and the canal network has become more functional. However, evaporative losses from this \nsystem are still high, which leads to low irrigation water efficiencies. Modern irrigation technologies, \nsuch as drip irrigation, offer significant benefits to farmers; on-farm trials in Cambodia for vegetable \ngrowing show that drip irrigation can result in 95% and 85% increases in water and labor productivity \nrespectively10. Drip irrigation technology is well-proven and widely commercially available in developed \nand many developing countries/regions, for example in the People\u2019s Republic of China11, Central Asia12, \nSouth Asia13, and Sub-Saharan Africa14. \n \n12.  Rainwater collection in Cambodia for purposes other than irrigation (mainly drinking water and \nsanitation) has been practiced by rural communities for many years as a way to survive the dry summer \nmonths15,16. Most people collect water from their roofs. However, rainwater collection  at scale for \nirrigation purposes is not yet a concept that has been adopted by farmers. In 2006, the Cambodian \ngovernment developed a National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA) for Climate Change in 2006, \n1.                                                        \n8 Seng, V., Eastick, R., Fukai, S., Ouk, M., Men, S., Chan, S., Nget, S., 2008.

Akay Cambodia is a Cambodian company, founded in 2009 with majority Cambodian ownership. \nIt was established to develop the model farm and outgrower business model in Battambang, and is \nassociated with the India-based company Akay Flavours & Aromatics Pvt. Ltd., (\u201cAkay India\u201d) through \nownership from a common set of investors. Akay Cambodia and Akay India are distinct, separate entities. \nHowever, in practice, Akay India supports Akay Cambodia with technical and managerial inputs from its \ntwenty  year  track  record  of  developing  agribusiness  projects.  Akay  India  has  been  successful \ndemonstration a model farm with outgrowers in Karnataka India, where it currently engages farmers \nthrough contract farming of chili peppers. It has also implemented drip irrigation systems for its India \noperations, and has approximately 1,300 hectares of land equipped with drip irrigation infrastructure to \ngrow chili peppers and turmeric. Since its establishment in 1993, Akay India has grown to one of the top \nfive exporters of spice oleoresins in the world. It is headquartered in Cochin, Kerala and operates five \nprocessing plants (four in India and one in the PRC) with a total capacity of 32,000 tons per year. Akay \ndistinguishes itself from its peers in putting core value in social development, job creation, gender \nempowerment, and sustainability as it deals with a large number of poor farmers. Akay India estimates it \nhas impacted over 60,000 farmers and their families to date. \n \n \nIII. Project description and Innovation \na.  Project Description \n \n14.  The project has been designed with two components: (i) demonstration of rainwater harvesting \nponds and drip irrigation networks for the model farm, and (ii) a line of credit to local farmers to enable \nthem to construct rainwater harvesting ponds and to purchase drip irrigation hardware for their own farms \nand/or additional agricultural inputs such as high quality seeds, plants, fertilizers and pesticides.  \n \n15.  For component (i), PPCR funds of $1 million would be lent to Akay Cambodia for costs relating \nto the construction of rainwater harvesting ponds, and the purchase and installation of drip irrigation \nhardware. To date, the model farm has piloted 34 rainwater harvesting ponds with a combined capacity of \n43,000 m3. Under the project, these will be expanded to give an increased capacity of 121,000 m3, and an \nadditional 37 new rainwater harvesting ponds will be built. In total, this will provide approximately \n231,000 m3 of rainwater harvesting capacity for the 720 hectare model farm, which will make it self-\nsufficient in terms of water requirements. Information on the ponds and a map is provided in Appendix 2. \nThe model farm has piloted sprinkler irrigation on 23 hectares of land, and is currently engaging with drip \nirrigation  technology  providers  from  India  and  the  Middle  East regarding  the  introduction of  drip \nirrigation to the model farm. Drip irrigation has not yet been piloted on the model farm; however lessons \nfrom other countries indicate that drip irrigation has strong potential in the Cambodian context. Estimates \nfor the cost of construction of ponds and installation of drip irrigation hardware combined vary between \n$1,700 and $2,500 per hectare, depending on the type of crops to be grown. With potential funding of $1 \nmillion, Akay Cambodia has put together a financial plan based on rainwater harvesting ponds and drip \nirrigation for a total of 536 hectares of black pepper, turmeric, cocoa, dragon fruit and rubber (please refer \nto section 3 of this concept paper).  \n \n16.  For component (ii), PPCR funds of $4 million would be lent to Akay Cambodia to be used to \nextend a line of credit to local farmers participating in the outgrower scheme to construct ponds and to \npurchase and install drip irrigation hardware. Funds may also be used for other agricultural inputs such as \n5 \n ", " \nhigh quality seeds, plants, fertilizers and pesticides. Technical assistance for the construction, installation, \noperation and maintenance of ponds and drip irrigation networks, and for other agricultural inputs will be \nprovided to farmers by Akay Cambodia through the learning and demonstration facilities developed at the \nmodel farm. Funds would be administered by Akay Cambodia and/or by a suitable local financial \nintermediary (local commercial bank or micro-finance institution), who would assess the creditworthiness \nof  individual  farmers,  manage  individual  loan  agreements,  and  handle  payments.  ADB  is  holding \ndiscussions with several financial intermediaries (several of whom are existing ADB clients) to confirm \ntheir interest in participating in the project. Akay Cambodia will be the obligor(s) for the $4 million \nPPCR loan, and will assume the responsibility for repayment. The loans to outgrowers would be governed \nby separate loan agreements for each farmer.  \n \n17.  There is also a non-PPCR component of ADB\u2019s planned non-sovereign assistance to Akay \nCambodia. As mentioned in section I of this paper, commercial funding of $3 million from ADB\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Operations Department (PSOD) along with $1 million in equity from Akay Cambodia \nwould be used for the construction of a spice processing plant to be built in Phnom Penh. This will allow \nAkay Cambodia to process greater volumes of raw produce from the model farm and outgrowers. PSOD \nis also processing a $10 million commercial loan to support Akay India\u2019s processing facilities in India. \n \nb.  Level of Innovation  \n \n18.  The project uses innovative technologies and also pioneers an innovative new private sector \nbusiness  model  for  Cambodia.  Rainwater  harvesting  for  irrigation  is  cheap,  avoids  extraction  of \nenvironmental flows and allows farmers to irrigate and grow crops year round. Drip irrigation technology \nfed through rainwater harvesting ponds offers significant economic and environmental advantages over \ntraditional irrigation techniques17. Not only does it avoid dependency on large scale irrigation canals, but \non-farm trials in Cambodia for vegetable growing show that drip irrigation can result in increases in water \nefficiency (95%) and increases in labor productivity (85%)18. Trials show that economic returns to labor \ncan increase by 67%, and the integration of improved crop management methods such as combining \nfertilizer with drip irrigation, can increase both yields and water use efficiency. Overall, average labor use \ndecreased 83% with drip irrigation, increased net returns by 153% and provided water savings of 48% \ncompared with traditional practice.  \n \n19.  The \u201coutgrower\u201d business model is innovative as it is both financially compelling, and able to \nprovide a range of benefits to local farmers and their communities, project developer\u2019s and the local \nenvironment.  Local  farmers  benefit  primarily  through  increased  income-generating  potential  from \ngrowing high-value crops rather than rice, corn and cassava. It also increases their income security, firstly \nfrom increased climate resilience and less risk of crop failure from drought, and secondly by being able to \nsecure favorable returns on their investments by having direct access to appropriate capacity building, \ntechnology and viable markets (local, regional, global) for their end product. The project offers significant \ngender related benefits by promoting the role of women in the workforce - currently around 70% of \nworkers on the model farm are women, and their knowledge and learning is promulgating through the \nlocal communities. From the project developer\u2019s perspective, the business model provides benefits of \nbeing able to scale up operations in fertile agricultural regions without having to acquire large portions of \nland. The developer is also able to focus their efforts on developing a larger share of international markets \nfor the benefit of both the company and the local farmers involved in the outgrower scheme.

Through demonstrating drip irrigation and rainwater harvesting, the business model has strong \npotential to make tangible improvements to the agricultural sector in Cambodia. It introduces powerful \nnew potential through its education and outreach elements \u2013 features that are new to agribusiness projects \nin Cambodia19. Using this business model, developers can influence agricultural practices across large \nareas  and  multiply production figures for efficiently produced, low environmental  impact, climate-\nresilient, high-value agri-products. By providing financing to this project, PPCR would be helping to de-\nrisk and to \u201cmainstream\u201d a business model that provides significant benefits to local communities, agri-\nbusiness developers and the environment. \n \nc.  Technology, Product, and/or Business Model \n \n21.  Drip irrigation, also known as trickle irrigation, involves dripping water onto the soil at very low \nrates (2-20 litres/hour) from a system of small diameter plastic pipes fitted with outlets called emitters or \ndrippers. Water is applied close to the plant\u2019s base to irrigate only the part of the soil in which roots grow, \nunlike surface and sprinkler irrigation, which involves wetting the whole soil profile. With drip irrigation, \nwater applications are more frequent (usually every 1-3 days) compared with other methods and this \nprovides a more consistent level of moisture in the soil.  \n \n22.  Properly designed, installed and operated, drip irrigation improves water conservation by reducing \nevaporation and deep drainage compared to flood irrigation methods or overhead sprinklers. Using drip \nirrigation, water can be more precisely applied to plants\u2019 roots. In addition, drip irrigation can eliminate \nmany diseases that are spread through water contact with the foliage. The advantages of drip irrigation \ninclude: \n\u2022  High water application efficiency (evaporative loses are minimized) \n\u2022  Distribution is controllable through valves and drippers \n\u2022  Nutrient and fertilizer loss is minimized due to localized application and reduced leaching \n\u2022  Soil erosion is minimized \n\u2022  Weed growth is minimized \n\u2022  Foliage remains dry, reducing the risk of disease \n\u2022  Moisture within the root zone can be maintained at field capacity  \n\u2022  Field leveling is not necessary \n\u2022  Fields with irregular shapes are easily accommodated \n\u2022  Recycled non-potable water can be safely used \n\u2022  Labor cost is less than other irrigation methods \n\u2022  Reduced  energy  costs  from  lower  operating  pressure  compared  with  other  types  of \npressurized irrigation \n \n23.  Rainwater harvesting for agricultural purposes involves the use of any structure built to capture \nrain - ponds, tanks, or reservoirs. In this case it involves digging ponds in low-lying areas next to fields \nwhere water can collect (through engineered or natural drainage). Correctly designed and sized systems \nprovide farmers with sufficient water to irrigate throughout the year. By conserving the monsoon rain that \nfalls during the wet season, farmers can increase the area they irrigate, grow crops in the dry season, \nsupport livestock and even recharge groundwater. Stored rainwater can also provide families with water \nfor household needs. \n1.                                                        \n19 As part of its outreach efforts, the Akay Model Farm has also established an in-field training program with the Department of \nAgriculture at the local university, Battambang University. The program requires agriculture students in graduate programs to \nwork on the model farm as trainees for minimum three months as part of their curriculum \n7 \n ", " \n \n24.  The advantages of rainwater harvesting include: \n\uf0b7  Increased production \u2013 crops can be grown year round \n\uf0b7  Increased reliability and reduced risk of crop failure from water shortages \n\uf0b7  An economical alternative to groundwater and river water extraction  \n\uf0b7  Reduced environmental pressure from water extraction from rivers during critical summer \nmonths, ensuring adequate water remains to support native ecosystems \n\uf0b7  High water quality - rainwater is low in minerals and suitable for irrigating sensitive plants \n\uf0b7  Rainwater is not regulated by water restrictions \n \nd.  Sustainability of intended results \n \n25.  The project is sustainable in several ways. In terms of ground-level operations, the developer has \nestablished a business model based on engaging with local communities and building strong links to \npursue  shared,  long-term  goals  of  increased  economic  growth,  inclusive  social  benefits,  and \nenvironmental sustainability. It is a good example of south-south cooperation and involves the exchange \nof resources, technology, and knowledge between Cambodia and India. Akay has already established a \nsuccessful outgrower model in India, where they source chili peppers from over 1,400 farmers, and will \nbring this experience to Cambodia. They have also introduced drip irrigation to 1,300 hectares of land \nused to grow chili and turmeric in India. From 2009, Akay Cambodia has worked closely with the village \ncommunities who now support the model form as a driving force for developing the local farming district. \nThe development of a model farm and the provision of training have yielded mutual benefits for both \nlocal farmers and Akay Cambodia, and this initiative has built strong support from  the local farming \ncommunities This has manifested itself also in the fact that village elders are encouraging young farmers \nto work with Akay Cambodia in order to learn farming techniques. \n \n26.   The project is financially sustainable, mainly due to the short payback period for drip irrigation \nand rainwater harvesting systems. The capital outlay is estimated at approximately USD 2,000 per hectare \n(for ponds and drip irrigation combined), and for outgrowers under likely assumptions and scenarios, the \npayback period is around 3 years. Once local financial institutions and microfinance institutions such as \nACLEDA Bank or PRASAC are able to see a successful track record of deployment of such systems \nstemming from this program, they are likely to become more comfortable with the risks involved in such \ntransactions, and additional financing for replication and scale up is likely to be more readily available. \n \n27.  The project is sustainable in terms of the current enabling environment in Cambodia. The project \naligns strongly with the objectives of Cambodia\u2019s endorsed Strategic Program for Climate Resilience and \nfocuses on two of its main aims for promoting climate-resilient agriculture. These are: (i) improving \nrainwater harvesting systems and enhancing resilience of community water supply, and (ii) enhancing the \nresilience of small scale agriculture through introduction of drought/flood tolerant crop varieties and \nsmall scale irrigation. Further to this, Cambodia is geographically close to China, India and other large \nproduce and spice importing markets, and being part of ASEAN it is a tax free environment for export \noriented agri-business products. Cambodia has limited restrictions on the import and export of foreign \ncurrencies,  which  offers  benefits  for  export  oriented  trade,  and  can  facilitate  greater  south-south \ncooperation. \n \n28.  The model farm initiative has been critical in developing the government\u2019s understanding and \nappreciation of the value of developing high value crops for local and international markets. In support of \nAkay Cambodia\u2019s initiative, the government recently started developing a new road from Samlot district \nin Battambang Province to the new Cambodian sea port being built in Kok Kong, at the Gulf of Thailand. \nThis new road touches the boundary of the model farm. It is believed that once this trade route road is \n8 \n ", " \ndeveloped fully in 2-3 years, it will significantly boost the agricultural exports from this area. Local \nfarmers  have  already  seen  the  value  of  their  land  appreciate  as  a  result  of  increased  access  to \ntransportation routes and interest in the new farming methods. \n \n29.  The model farm has received strong support from Akay India, both in terms of advisory and \nmaterial support. The Akay Group now operates six processing plants with a total capacity of 32,000 MT \nand is currently attempting to raise funds to increase this to eight processing plants with a total capacity of \n45,000 MT (6 plants in India, 1 in China and 1 in Cambodia). The company is planning to establish a \nprocessing and extraction plant in Cambodia for further value addition of spices (mainly grinding and \nsteam sterilization of spices, oleoresins, natural food colors and essential oils). The new plant will \nincrease the sustainability of the project as Akay Cambodia will have a strengthened supply chain in \nterms of processing, and farmers will have better certainty regarding the long-term offtake of their \nproduce.  \n \nIV. Inclusivity \n30.  Battambang Province has an estimated population of 980,00020, spread among 13 districts, 95 \ncommunes and 741 villages. The province has an average population density of 84 people/km2 (national \naverage is 75 people/km2) and an average household size of 5.2 people. The province\u2019s mainly rural \npopulation suffers from high levels poverty, low levels of wealth, low levels of income generation, and \nhigh unemployment. Consumption poverty21 in Battambang is high, and as shown in Table 2 of Appendix \n3, in 2004, 27% of households were below the consumption poverty line and 32% fell into the poorest \ntwo national quintiles of national consumption. These households will struggle to have enough cash \navailable to buy food needs on the market and to meet other expenditure needs such as health services.  \n \n31.  The population in Battambang also suffers from a lack of physical assets with which they can \ngenerate household income (Table 3 in Appendix 3).  Table 4 of Appendix 3 shows that most of the \nProvince\u2019s population work in the agricultural sector (55%), have low levels of literacy 74% (68% for \nfemales), and have trouble in securing reliable income (only 34% of the labour force is active). One fifth \nof households in the province own no land, roughly three quarters own no animals, and fewer than one in \nfive households own a motorbike. Households without land are dependent upon wage labor to generate \ncash income to buy food and other basic needs. However wage labor mostly comes from the informal \nsector, is unregulated, casual and often poorly paid (a typical example is agricultural casual wage labor).  \n \n32.  The project would provide assistance to two main groups in the province: firstly farmers with \nlandholdings, and secondly the workforces employed on the farms. Farmers in the region are mostly ex-\nsoldiers who were allocated 2 hectares of land each by the Government of Cambodia. These farmers are \ntypically poor, have little formal education, and depend on rice, corn or cassava cultivation, which \nprovides low income and leaves farmers vulnerable to price volatility. The project would directly benefit \nthis group through improved income earning potential, better income security and increased livelihood \nprotection. The province\u2019s workforce on farms would benefit from a higher number of jobs (due to the \nhigher labor inputs from spices and high value crops as compared with rice, corn and cassava), and higher \nincome reliability (from producing diversified and higher value crops). It is anticipated that over time as \nthe agricultural sector is strengthened, modernized and expanded through projects such as this, greater \nbenefits will flow to rural communities, and basic indicators such as household incomes and levels of \n1.                                                        \n20 World Food Program Provincial Food Security Profile pages for Battambang, Accessed April 2014. \nhttp://www.foodsecurityatlas.org/khm/country/provincial-Profile/Battambang .  \n21 Consumption poverty refers to having insufficient cash income (or its equivalent in kind) to meet basic livelihood needs. This \nincludes having insufficient cash income to buy foods that people need for an adequate diet as well as cash income to buy other \nbasic needs such as shelter, clothing, health and education. This lack of market purchasing power can be an important cause of \nfood shortages and protein-energy and micro-nutrient malnutrition in the province population. \n9 \n ", " \nwealth will increase. \n \n33.  In Cambodia, there is traditionally a high degree of participation by women in the agricultural \nsector and women make up 65% of farmers, directly contributing to the country\u2019s food security and the \nnational agricultural output22. In line with national trends, the developers of the model farm have given \npriority to the employment of women, and at present about 70% of the workforce are women. The model \nfarm runs childcare facilities on site, where mothers can leave their children during the day when they are \nworking, which has enhanced women\u2019s capacity for involvement in income generating activities. \n \nV.  Financial Plan (Indicative) \n34.  Funds from PPCR would be used in conjunction with commercial loans from ADB\u2019s Private \nSector Operations Department, equity from Akay Cambodia, and potentially additional concessional \nfinancing from Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement. PPCR\u2019s share thus represents less than 23% of the \noverall investment plan. The following table shows a breakdown of the different components of the \nplanned investment. In Cambodia, there will be approximately 78% of debt financing, with the balance \n22% as equity.23 \nTable 1 - Sources and uses of funds \nUses of Funds  Sources of Funds \nItem  $ million  $ million  Party \nCambodia model farm equipment (including  1  6%  PPCR \n1  2.7  16% \nrainwater harvesting ponds and drip irrigation)  1.7  10%  ADB \n2  Cambodia credit line   4  23%  4  23%  PPCR \n2.2  13%  ADB \n3  Cambodia processing plant  4.7  27% \n2.5  14%  Akay Cambodia \n5  29%  ADB \n4  India processing plants  6  34% \n1  6%  Akay India \nTOTAL  17.4  17.4 \n \n \n \n   \n1.                                                        \n22 United Nations Development Program, 2011.

Implementation Arrangements and Feasibility  \n35.  The project is currently at an advanced stage of readiness. The project developer is positioned \nsuch that they are currently able to deploy the additional capital resources, and following PPCR Sub-\nCommittee approval, PPCR resources would be deployed alongside a commercial loan from ADB\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Operations Department (PSOD) in late 2014. MDB approval for the investment (PSOD \nand PPCR resources) is expected in Q3 2014. \n \n \nVIII.  Potential Risks and Mitigation Measures \n36.  Credit risk of local farmers. Local farmers do not have significant financial resources or assets, \nwhich presents a credit risk to the project. However, rainwater harvesting and drip irrigation systems are \ncost effective for an average farm, with a payback period of approximately 3 years. Land holdings are \nlikely to be used as collateral for loans, and agricultural output from the \u201cclimate-proofed\u201d farms (along \nwith Akay Cambodia as an offtaker) is expected to generate sufficient income for farmers to make \nrepayments. The credit risk of outgrowers would be examined more carefully on an individual basis by \nAkay Cambodia/the financial intermediary engaged to manage the line of credit.  \n \n37.  Technology risk and O&M. Rainwater harvesting ponds are technologically simple, and pilots \non the model farm have shown that local soil properties and hydrology lend themselves well to retaining \nwater in standing ponds. Drip irrigation technology is mature and commercially available in many \ndeveloped and developing countries, and is not anticipated to present significant obstacles in Cambodia. \nHowever, small irrigation networks need to be properly installed and suitably maintained to ensure even \ndistribution of water, and the prevention of blockages. To prevent potential problems, Akay Cambodia \nwill engage the technology supplier to adequately train local staff in correct procedures for installation, \noperation  and  maintenance.  Through  facilities  at  on  the  model  farm,  Akay  Cambodia  will  ensure \noutgrowers are correctly trained to be able to install systems on surrounding farms. \n \n38.  Soft systems (information, marketing, education and capacity building). In addition to the \nmodel farm, Akay Cambodia\u2019s outreach program to outgrowers will be essential for the successful \nimplementation of the project. Many of the local farmers lack basic education, and literacy rates are not \nhigh. Therefore soft systems will need to be tailored such that farmers are sufficiently informed and \nequipped to install and maintain ponds and drip irrigation systems on their individual farms.  Akay \nCambodia will have a strong incentive to make sure soft systems are effective as not only are they \ndependent on the eventual produce from farms, but they are also taking on risk for repayment of the $4 \nmillion PPCR loan for onlending to outgrowers. \n \n39.  Policy and regulatory. Due to the value of the agricultural sector to Cambodia, the regulatory \nenvironment is relatively conducive to growth and the addition of new private sector agri-businesses. As \npart of ASEAN Cambodia is a tax free environment for export oriented agri business products, and \nCambodia also has limited restrictions on the import and export of foreign currencies, which offers \nbenefits for export oriented trade. However, the country has experienced political instability in recent \nyears, and this may affect the future regulatory environment. \n \n \n   \n12 \n ", " \nAppendix 1 \u2013 Further information on the model farm \n \n41.  Akay Cambodia Ltd commenced operations in 2009 after the developers bought 630 hectares of \nland from local owners in Prey Thom village. During 2009 to 2011, the main activities conducted on the \nfarm were de-mining, land clearing and preparation for planting. Nurseries and some trail plots were also \nestablished. As the area had been heavily mined during the Khmer Rouge period, the company sought the \nservices  of  a  UN-backed  mine  detection  team  at  Battambang  and  cleared  the  entire  farm  area  of \nunexploded ordinances. \n \n42.  The strategy adopted for the model farm is a mixed crop pattern to build resilience to fluctuations \nin prices and production levels from varying climatic (and other) conditions. A minimum of five different \ncrops are cultivated on the farm at a time25. Agricultural techniques such as crop rotation, tillage, cover \ncrops, and the use of natural fertilizers and pesticides are being employed to improve yields and minimize \nthe environmental impacts of farming. The Spices cultivated include short-term and inter-crops (which \ntake 8-10 months to provide yield) and long term spices (which take 3-5 years to provide yield). Rubber \n(considered a long term cash crop) has been planted around the farm along with teak trees as a wind-break \nand also to protect the certified organic production areas from outside contamination. \n \n43.  Through its long term cultivation plan, Akay Cambodia plans to maximize the environmental \nsustainability of its operations. The model farm is planning to plant 1 million trees in the next 5 years and \nhas already completed the planting of 100,000 new trees as part of its land rehabilitation program. The \nplan is to promote tree planting to the surrounding farms by supplying saplings of various trees to \nfarmers.  \n   \n1.                                                        \n25 The current cropping pattern is 100 hectares of an Indocert certified spice farm, 100 hectares of Cocoa intercropped with fruit \ntrees (Litchi, Dragon fruit, Mangostene, Mangoes and Coconut), 500 hectares of Rubber intercropped with rotating crops such \nTurmeric, Ginger (spices), Coleus Forskolin and Kiryat (herbs). In addition a nursery for seed and saplings development, \nlivestock management, training center for farmers, warehouses and staff accommodation has been set up on 20 hectares. \n13 \n ", " \nAppendix 2 - Map of existing ponds (for expansion) and planned new ponds \n \n \n   \n14 \n ", " \nAppendix 3 \u2013 Demographics of Battambang Province, Cambodia \n \nTable 2 - Indicators of Consumption Poverty in Battambang 200426 \nNational \nConsumption Poverty indicator  Battambang \naverage \nHousehold daily per capita consumption in riel (and 2004   3,375  3,247 \nUSD equiv.)
