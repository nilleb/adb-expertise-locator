An initial environment examination for the project loan \nAssessment  (core  and  supplementary  appendixes)  and  an  environment \nassessment  of  the  policy  matrix  for  the  program  loan \n(supplementary appendix) were undertaken. \n   \nProgram Impacts and   The overall expected impact of the DWSSDP is to contribute to \nDescription  sustained economic growth and improved public health conditions \nin  the  urban  centers  of  Bangladesh,  particularly  in  the  Dhaka \nMetropolitan Area, by improving the water supply services. The \nDWSSDP is the first phase of a long-term support program for the \nurban water supply sector based on the Partnership Framework \nthat  the  external  development  partners  and  the  Government \nagreed upon. The successful implementation of the DWSSDP will \nhelp reduce child mortality and improve health generally, increase \nthe productivity of women by shortening the time required to fetch \nand  store  water,  and  conserve  precious  natural  resources\u2014\nsurface and groundwater. The program and project loans under \nthe  DWSSDP  are  designed  to  complement  each  other  in \nachieving progress towards these key goals. \n   \nThe Program Loan   \n   \nOutcomes  The program loan will support the reforms in the urban water \nsupply sector laid out in Sector Development Programme\u2013Water \nand  Sanitation  Sector  in  Bangladesh  (SDP-WSSB)  2006  by \nassisting  the  Government  in  improving  the  management  and \noperation  of  urban  water  supply  institutions,  including \npourashavas (peri-urban towns) and Water Supply and Sewerage \nAuthorities (WASAs). The reforms under the program loan will \nhelp achieve sustainable and improved operation of water supply \nservices in the urban areas. The reforms include (i) improving \nlocal governance and strengthening local institutional framework; \n(ii)  preparing  sector  strategy  and  plan;  (iii)  improving  financial \nsustainability;  and  (iv)  strengthening  Dhaka  Water  Supply  and \nSewerage  Authority  (DWASA)  governance  and  organizational \nstructure  and  financial  management  capacity.  Appendix  4 \npresents  a  development  policy  letter  and  policy  matrix  of  the ", "ii   \nProgram along with strategic goals, key targets, and process for \neach output.  \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of SDR31,843,000 ($50 million equivalent) will be provided \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with a term of 24 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and an annual interest charge \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter;  \n   \nEstimated Program  31 December 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \nTranches  The loan will be released in two tranches of SDR15,922,000 (first \ntranche)  and  SDR15,921,000  (second  tranche)  ($25  million \nequivalent) when the Government and DWASA comply with the \nconditions for their release.   \n   \nExecuting Agencies and  The Executing Agencies (EAs) will be the Finance Division of the \nImplementation  Ministry of Finance (MOF), and the Local Government Division \nArrangements  (LGD) of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development \nand Cooperatives. DWASA will be the Implementing Agency for \ncertain activities, as specified in the policy matrix. \n   \nProcurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirement for Program \nLoans, the reimbursement procedure will be used to disburse the \nloan  proceeds  based  on  certification  by  the  Government. \nSupporting import documentation will not be required if, during \neach year that loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the \ntotal  value  of  the  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember \ncountries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed  under  other \nofficial development assistance is equal to or greater than the \namount of the loan expected to be disbursed during that year. For \nthe first tranche, the import certification may cover goods procured \n180 days before loan effectiveness. With each withdrawal request, \nthe  Government  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula. \nOtherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will \nbe required. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the loan \nproceeds. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The Government will use the local currency counterpart funds \ngenerated by the loan proceeds to meet program expenditures \nand associated costs of reform, as well as to help maintain current \nlevels of social expenditures. The counterpart funds generated by \nthe proceeds will be transferred from the MOF to LGD to meet the \ncosts and counterpart funding requirements of implementing the \nsector reform. \n   ", "  iii\nThe Project Loan   \n   \nOutcomes  The Project will contribute to sustainable provision and operation \nof urban water supply services in Dhaka, by rehabilitating and \nstrengthening the water supply system based on the long-term \npolicy and investment roadmap. The physical investment under \nthe Project will be complemented by capacity building of DWASA \nto enable the authority to competently manage the water supply \nsystems for about 12.3 million people in Dhaka. The Project has \nthree components: \n   \nOutputs  Component A: Distribution System and Quality Improvement. \nThis will involve rehabilitation and optimization of DWASA\u2019s water \ndistribution  network  to  minimize  losses  and  to  enable  24-hour \npressurized  water  supply;  and  provision  of  water  quality \nassurance and control measures.  \nComponent  B:  Capacity  Building  and  Institutional \nStrengthening. This will involve the following subcomponents: (i) \ninstitutionalization of sound financial management, efficient billing, \nrevenue  collection,  and  customer  record  systems;  (ii) \ncomprehensive training of all levels of staff to optimize operational \nperformance and upgrading of training facilities; and (iii) extensive \ndemand control and awareness campaign for consumers.  \n \nComponent  C:  Project  Management  and  Implementation \nSupport. This component will support (i) project management and \nmonitoring; (ii) detailed planning and design activities under the \nProject;  (iii) contract  structuring,  tendering,  execution,  and \nmanagement; and (iv) construction supervision. In addition, the \ncomponent will assist DWASA in conducting a feasibility study for \nan optimal location for the future surface Water Treatment Plant \n(WTP)  with  a  capacity  of  500  million  liters  per  day.  The \nconsultants  engaged  also  will  prepare  an  outline  design  and \nprepare tender documents for the WTP. \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The Project is estimated to cost the equivalent of $212.7 million \n(including the contribution of the Government), including taxes, \nduties, interest charges on the ADB loan, and physical and price \ncontingencies. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide SDR95,530,000 ($150 million equivalent), which \nis  70.5%  of  the  total  cost.  The  Government  will  finance  the \nequivalent of $62.7 million, or 29.5% of the total project cost, \nincluding  taxes  and  duties,  resettlement  cost,  land  acquisition, \nremuneration of counterpart staff, office accommodation, part of \nthe civil works, and other miscellaneous costs. \n ", "iv   \n  ($ million) \nSource  Cost  Percent \nAsian Development Bank (ADF)  150.0  70.5 \nGovernment of Bangladesh  62.7  29.5 \nTotal  212.7  100.0 \nADF = Asian Development Fund. \nSources:  Government  of  Bangladesh  and  Asian  Development  Bank \nestimates. \n   \nCost Estimates  The Project is estimated to cost $212.7 million, including taxes \nand duties of $16.1 million. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  ADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  SDR95,530,000  ($150  million \nequivalent) from its Special Funds resources to help finance the \nProject. The loan will a term of 32 years, grace period of 8 years, \nand  interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter.   \n   \nRelending Terms  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  relend  to  DWASA  pursuant  to  a \nsubsidiary loan agreement with terms and conditions acceptable \nto ADB. Relending terms will include a repayment period of 20 \nyears, including a 5-year grace period, and annual interest rate of \n5%.  The  Government  of  Bangladesh  will  assume  the  foreign \nexchange risk. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2014 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  DWASA \n   \nImplementation  DWASA will be responsible for overall management, supervision, \nArrangements  and execution of the Project. A Project Management Unit (PMU) \nwill be established, consisting of one full-time project director with \nthe rank of Deputy Managing Director (DMD) or chief engineer or \nadditional chief engineer. In addition, there will be three dedicated \ndeputy project directors. The deputy project director (finance) will \nbe recruited from outside of DWASA through competitive selection \nprocess. The two other deputy project directors, who will head \ntechnical eastern zone and technical western zone, will be the \nrank  of  the  superintending  engineers  or  above.  The  project \ndirector and the three deputy project directors will be appointed \nexclusively to the Project. Four executive engineers will assist the \ndeputy project directors in managing the works under them. The \nPMU will be responsible for all day-to-day management of the \nproject, including but not limited to (i) preparing an overall project \nimplementation  plan  and  detailed  work  program;  (ii)  providing \noverall  monitoring  and  guidance  on  implementation  of  project \nworks; (iii) carrying out all tendering and execution of contracts; \n(iv) monitoring and supervising all project management activities; ", "  v\n(v) preparing necessary project progress and project completion \nreport;  and  (vi)  ensuring  full  compliance  with  the  ADB\u2019s \nresettlement, environmental, and other safeguard policies.  \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of all goods and services to be financed under the \nProject will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). All civil works \ncontracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $1 million or more \nwill be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB). \nCivil works contracts estimated to cost less than $1 million will be \nprocured using national competitive bidding (NCB). To the extent \npracticable,  goods  will  be  grouped  into  procurement  packages \nlarger than $500,000 to be suitable for ICB procedures. Goods \nthat cannot be grouped into larger contracts and are estimated to \ncost less than $500,000 per contract will be procured through \nnational  competitive  bidding.  The  feasibility  of  community \ncontracting will be examined on a case-by-case basis for slum \nand/or bulk water supply and other community-level works not \nexceeding $10,000 in value, and will need pre-fact approval by \nADB. NCB procedures applicable to the Project are specified in \nthe Government\u2019s Public Procurement Act 2003. Miscellaneous \nminor  goods  expected  to  cost  less  than  the  equivalent  of \n$100,000  will  be  purchased  using  shopping  procedures.  NCB \npackages valued at more than $100,000 each will be subject to \nprior review by ADB. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants will be selected and engaged under the Project in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). All consultants under the \nProject will be engaged as firms and will be engaged following \nADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) procedures.  \n   \nProgram and Project  The investment under DWSSDP will cover four out of six water \nBenefits and  supply zones in the Dhaka city for immediate system rehabilitation \nBeneficiaries  and optimization. Detailed studies will be also prepared for the \nnext phase to rehabilitate the remaining two zones and to develop \nnew water source. While the program is the first phase of the \nlong-term  support  to  the  Dhaka  city,  once  completed,  the \nrehabilitated system supported by new water source development \nwill ensure stable and sustained water supply to entire population \nin Dhaka Metropolitan Area (DMA). The poor will benefit from the \noverall  improvement  of  the  water  supply  system  while  other \ndevelopment partners will provide targeted services to the poor \nunder the Partnership Framework. The user survey conducted \nduring the project preparatory Technical Assistance showed that \nthe poor women will benefit most from the improved services in \nterms of time saving and improved health conditions. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Rehabilitation of the existing pipeline, the major component of the \nProject, carries risks. Although DWASA maintains digital maps of \nits pipelines and has general ideas of where prevalent illegal and \npoor connections might be, the real extent only emerges at the \n ", "vi   \ntime of excavation. Though the Project is based on conservative \nassumptions,  the  required  works  and  costs  to  rehabilitate  and \noptimize the system might exceed the original estimate. This risk \nwill be mitigated by careful preparatory works based on lessons \nlearned  from  the  pilot  scheme,  and  substantial  engineering \nconsulting support to DWASA during project implementation. \n \nDespite firm commitment of the Government, resistance to the \nreforms program might arise from outside and within (for example, \nfrom unions). Tariff adjustment may face opposition, undermining \npolitical support to the reform. The reform program is underpinned \nby  the  Partnership  Framework  between  the  Government  and \nmajor development partners to support the Government initiative \nin a coherent manner. To minimize the social impact and sustain \nbroad  public  support,  the  tariff  adjustment  will  be  carried  out \ngradually based on the affordability study and with the help of \ncommunication  programs  which  involves  Community-Based \nOrganizations (CBOs) and NGOs.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  In conjunction with the Project, technical assistance (TA) will be \nprovided for advisory assistance to the Government in improving \nand strengthening the management and operation of urban water \nsupply and sanitation services. This will include assistance to LGD \nand DWASA in preparing and implementing key policy reforms. \nThe  TA  also  will  assist  DWASA  in  conducting  the  necessary \ntechnical preparation for introducing optimization measures in the \nexisting water supply sources; and in supporting the smooth start-\nup of project implementation.  \n \nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $3,125,000, of which ADB \nwill  finance  $2,500,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  its  TA  funding \nprogram. The TA consultants will be recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. ADB will engage a \nqualified consulting firm and individual consultants (for a total of \n131  person-months).  Additional  individual  consultants  may  be \nrecruited as necessary to strengthen the process. The TA will be \nundertaken  intermittently  from  January  2008  to  January  2011. \nSome of the outputs (including studies, recommendations, draft \nrules and regulations, draft business plan, and draft operations \nmanual) are expected to support LGD, DWASA, and other key \nstakeholders in fulfilling the policy actions under the program and \nproject loans.  \n \n \n \n ", "89 o 00'E 92o  00'E\n26o  00'N 26o  00'N\nSonargaon Sector 8\nPurakar B A N G L A D E S H\nUttara Model Town Project Area\nINDIA\nMollartek\nDHAKA\nDakhin Khan INDIA\nAshkona\nZone 4\nBaruna\nKhilkhet 22 o 00'N 22 o 00'N\nKuratali\nKuni\nZone 5 Bay of Bengal\nMirpur Palasnagar MYANMAR\nBoxnagal\n89o  00'E 92o  00'E\nArmy\nDamalkot Stadium\nSenpara\nNarum Bazar\nKazipara\nSheorapara Navannagar Merul\nPaikpara\nCantonmer\nPererbagh Shajadpur Satarkul\nKachu Khet B A N G L A D E S H\nAgargaon Badda DHAKA WATER SUPPLY SECTOR\nDarussalam\nOld\nShawmall Airport Nakhal Para DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\nTikkapara Bijoy Sarani Tejgaon Rampura\nMohammadpur Zone 3 Tejkumpara Ulan\nNayathala\nMeradia\nKhilgaon\nTejkuniwara\nTailtala Goran Zone 6 Durgapur\nRayerbazar Dhanmondi Madartek\nMadubazar\nParibagh Malibagh Basabo Baida\nKataban\nRajarbagh\nRamna Park\nHaaribagh Pilkhana\nManda\nBaddanagar Azimpur Mojtijhee Mugdapara Poyati Demra\nNawabganj Palashi Manik Nagar Saidabad SWTP\nKamrangiZr oCnhaer 2 IslamLbaalgbhagh Bangsal Narinda Savedabad Kajla MatuRaailw Water Transmission Line Sarulla\nChakbazu\nZone 1\nSutrapur Jatrabari\nGandaria\nChadnighat SWTP Dholarpar\nNational Capital Jurain\nPostagola\nExisting Deep Tubewell (DTW) Location\nAlam Bagh Ghoshpara\nExisting Overhead Tank\nSampur\nExisting Surface Water Treatment Plant (SWTP) Deulpara\nMODS Zone Boundary\nFlood Wall\nEmbankment\nI I I I I Railway\nWater Distribution Network (width in milli-meter)\n250 - 400 N\n450 - 1800\nProvincial Boundary\nInternational Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n07-2012 RM", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) two proposed \nloans  for  the  Dhaka  Water  Supply  Sector  Development  Program  (DWSSDP),  and  (ii)  a \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Management Support for Dhaka Water Supply and \nSewerage  Authority  (DWASA)  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework for the Program is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n \n2.  Bangladesh has the seventh largest population in the world. However, its land area is \nlimited, making Bangladesh one of the most densely populated countries in the world.1 Almost a \nquarter of its 140 million people (35 million) live in urban areas, and the urban population is \nincreasing 2.5% a year\u2014nearly twice the national rate.2 Almost one third of the total urban \npopulation lives in Dhaka Metropolitan Area (DMA, the capital of Bangladesh), that is growing \ntwice  as  fast  as  other  urban  areas.  DWASA3 serves  70%  of  the  DMA.  When  the  DMA \npopulation reaches 17 million in 2025, less than 45% of the people would be covered by the \nDWASA water supply system. 4 Most of the remaining uncovered population may abstract water \nfrom  their  private  wells,  using  the  same  aquifer.  The  Government  of  Bangladesh  (the \nGovernment) and DWASA face an enormous challenge in supplying safe, reliable water to the \ncapital city\u2019s growing population. \n \n3.  Bangladesh\u2019s economy has generally grown more than 5% annually during 2000-2006.5 \nHowever, most of the development is taking place in the cities, Dhaka in particular. Despite \nconsiderable progress, basic services in all urban centers are deficient. Of the 309 urban towns, \nonly 102 have a piped water supply system. In most towns, the water supply is sourced from \ndeep tube wells. Due to the high cost of electricity, water pumps run for only 10\u201312 hours per \nday, resulting in an intermittent water supply of 2\u20134 hours at most per day. Urban water supply \nconditions typically are characterized by (i) unaccounted-for-water by sub-zone is usually as \nhigh as 50-60% of production,6 (ii) tariffs below average production costs, and (iii) low billing and \ncollection rates. On average, less than 20% of houses have their own connections, while about \n60% rely on shallow private tube wells. The remaining 20% of the population fetches water from \nstand posts or from public tube wells, if the town has a piped water supply system. Water \nshortages have become increasingly apparent because of the falling water tables resulting from \nunregulated extractions of groundwater. Inadequate basic urban services, including sanitation, \nare a severe hindrance to the continued development of urban areas, as well as efforts to \nreduce poverty. Rehabilitation and expansion of the existing systems, in parallel with investment \nin new systems in most towns and cities, is urgently needed. \n \n                                                 \n1  Unit for Policy Implementation, Local Government Division. 2005.

These figures are based on \nbilled amount, rather than actual reliable meter reading. In Manikdi pilot area, actual readings gave 60%.     ", " 2   \n4.  More than 26% of urban households lack latrines or access to hygienic sanitation. \nExcept for a limited waterborne sewerage system in Dhaka, which covers only 30% of the city \narea, no other urban centers have any form of sewerage system. Only 20% of the households in \nurban areas have access to a solid waste collection system. Most of Bangladesh has low-lying, \nflood-prone areas, and groundwater is contaminated by naturally occurring arsenic. Frequent \ncyclones and floods during the rainy season, combined with inadequate drainage and solid \nwaste management, increase the exposure of the urban population to the effects of polluted \nwater. Waterborne diseases are prevalent, and infant mortality is high (Appendix 2, sector road \nmap is in Supplementary Appendix A).  Hence, sustainable access to a safe, potable water \nsupply and sound sanitation facilities is a high priority. \n \n5.  The Local Government Division (LGD) under the Ministry of Local Government, Rural \nDevelopment and Cooperatives is overseeing the water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector and \npolicy. Urban WSS services are provided by water supply and sewerage authorities (WASA), \ncity  corporations,  and  pourashava  (peri-urban  town)  water  supply  sections  (PWSS).  The \nDepartment of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) implements new water supply systems and \ncarries out major rehabilitation programs, except in the areas managed by the WASA.7 After \ncompletion of the works, DPHE hands over the WSS systems to local government institutions \n(LGI) for operation and maintenance (O&M). The shortcomings in this delivery situation are (i) \nabsence of demand management; (ii) inadequate cost recovery; (iii) inefficient service provision; \n(iv) lack of financing and autonomy, especially in setting tariffs and staffing; and (v) lack of \ninvolvement of users in water utility planning and operation. DPHE undertakes much of the \ndevelopment projects because of the weak capacities of the LGIs. Planning and public service \ndelivery are generally supply-driven, and do not respond adequately to users\u2019 needs. Water \nconsumption does not depend on economic pricing, but on the availability of supply. The lack of \nautonomy  of  the  responsible  government  agencies  also  undermines  the  effective  service \ndelivery and quality standards. \n \n6.  In Dhaka and Chittagong, a semiautonomous WASA is responsible for WSS. This large \nwater utility operates and manages the system, as well as collects fees. Water is sourced from \ngroundwater  and  surface  water.  The  DWASA  has  numerous  institutional  and  financial \nconstraints, similar to those faced by urban towns, in achieving the recovery of user charges, \ncontrolling losses, and effectively managing the institution. A lack of commercial orientation and \nlow  tariffs  have  led  to  inefficient  practices  and  poor  financial  performance.  Planning  and \nimplementation are largely a supply-driven, top-down, and target-oriented processes, which \nsuffer from unclear priorities and uncoordinated development. All agencies involved in WSS \ntypically  prefer  to  meet  physical  targets  rather  than  establish  and  monitor  processes  for \nreaching goals related to facility operation, management, utilization, and maintenance. Despite \ngradual  reductions  in  water-related  mortality  and  morbidity  rates,  and  increased  physical \ncoverage, further development is needed across the sector. \n \n7.  In recognition of these needs, the Government included WSS improvement as part of its \nseven-point  agenda  for  reducing  poverty  in  its  2005  national  poverty  reduction  strategy \n(NPRS).8 By 2015, the NPRS aims to reduce poverty by 30%, and child mortality from 53 to 31 \nper 1,000 live births. The Government likewise has committed to achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, including halving the proportion of people without access to sustainable \nsafe WSS by 2015. In addition, the Government goals and priorities highlight safe drinking water \nand  appropriate  sanitation.  These  are  consolidated  in  the  new  Sector  Development \n                                                 \n7  Dhaka and Chittagong only. \n8  Government of Bangladesh. 2005. Poverty Reduction Strategy. Dhaka. ", "  3\nProgramme\u2013Water and Sanitation Sector in Bangladesh (SDP-WSSB) 2006, which includes (i) \nNational Policy for Safe Water Supply and Sanitation 1998, (ii) Sector Development Framework \n(SDF) 2004, (iii) Pro-Poor Strategy 2005, and (iv) National Policy for Arsenic Mitigation 2004. In \nparticular, the SDF 2004 sets an optimistic target and timescale, aiming for 100% coverage of \nbasic WSS by 2015.  \n \n8.   The SDP-WSSB 2006 emphasizes (i) ensuring basic minimum needs related to WSS for \nall citizens, especially the poor; (ii) decentralizing the service delivery and capacity building of \nLGIs to sustain investments and good governance; (iii) recommending optimal service delivery \noptions and institutional framework; (iv) drawing a blueprint to realize sector reform and capacity \nbuilding  to  achieve  desired  coverage  and  performance  levels;  and  (v)  outlining  a  sector \ninvestment plan for the next 10 years to fulfill sector targets, sector reforms, and capacity \nbuilding needs within the available resources. Recognizing the overly ambitious target, the \nGovernment critically reexamined and acknowledged that, while the policy addresses the key \nissues,  it  lacks  operational  strategies  and  tools,  such  as  financial  allocations,  time  frame, \ninstitutional arrangements, legal instruments, and policy directives. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n9.  Although the size of urban areas differs, issues and challenges that DWASA faces are \ncommon to the urban WSS sector in general. As such, they should be addressed as part of the \nsector-wide  reform  program  to  meet  the  challenges.  DWASA  is  currently  facing  six  major \nchallenges. \n \n10.  Inadequate Supply of Clean Water to Meet Rapidly Growing Demand. More than \n80% of Dhaka\u2019s water supply comes from groundwater, and the upper aquifer of Dhaka already \nhas exceeded its withdrawal limit. As a result, almost half of the deep tube wells supplying water \nto Dhaka will dry up by 2013. The lower aquifer can accommodate only about 50 new tube \nwells. The groundwater supply inevitably and urgently will have to be augmented with treated \nsurface  water.  However,  treating  surface  water  is  much  more  technically  complex  and \nexpensive than using groundwater. \n \n11.  Poor Quality of Water Distribution Network. The pilot program in Manikdi area (para. \n59)  found that all household connections are substandard and leaking, and that physical water \nlosses are up to 50%. This is under very low pressure conditions. In its current condition, the \nnetwork cannot sustain the higher pressure required for transmitting treated water. In addition to \nlosses due to leaks, only 59%9 of household connections have water meters to account for \nconsumption\u2014and the installed meters are often inaccurate or inaccessible\u2014making effective \nmanagement of demand virtually impossible. \n \n12.  Poor Quality and Reliability of Water. Generally, the quality of groundwater being \npumped into the water supply network of Dhaka is believed to be good. The quality deteriorates, \nhowever, as it moves through the piped network. The problems stem from a number of sources. \nLeaks affect the hygienic conditions of the pipes and connections. To a greater degree, the \nsystem's low and sometimes negative pressure\u2014caused by consumers using suction pumps or \nservice  connections  installed  at  the  bottom  of  underground  tanks\u2014causes  extensive \ncontamination of the water within the network. In addition, the current treatment plants are not \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2005.

Page 11. para 45. \n\u201cDWASA indicated (April 2006) that there are 135,500 metered (59%) and 95,900 unmetered connections.\u201d  \n ", " 4   \nworking  optimally  and  require  pre-treatment  facilities.  Water  quality  aside,  the  reliability  of \nsupply is severely hampered by intermittent power supply to the pumps, which do not have \nbackup generators. \n \n13.  Limited  Coverage  of  Slum  Dwellers.  About  1.3  million  people  (or  15%  of  the \npopulation) in the DWASA service area are living in slums. DWASA serves the majority of the \nslum dwellers, many of whom have unauthorized connections. However, a significant number of \nthe more vulnerable slum dwellers still do not have access to services. This number is projected \nto increase to more than 4 million by 2025. \n \n14.  Financially  Unsustainable  Utility.  For  a  number  of  reasons,  including  extensive \nleakage in the system (unaccounted-for water), unsustainable tariffs, and poor accounting and \nmanagement systems, DWASA is unable to meet Dhaka\u2019s fast-growing demand for water. Of \nthe water that is accounted for (about 50%), only 62% of revenues are collected. In total, only \none  third  of  the  water  that  enters  the  network  is  ever  paid  for.  DWASA  accounting  and \nmanagement systems are outdated, inefficient, and often not transparent. \n \n15.  Inefficient or Ineffective Management Systems. DWASA and its operations are highly \npoliticized. As a result, in recent years, managing director (MD) position was vacant long time, \nand turnover of senior executives (including MD) is high. Workers unions exert strong pressure \non management, often preventing them from recruiting key staff or taking disciplinary action. \nThe capacity and motivation levels of staff are generally low. Customer interface is extremely \nlimited.  DWASA\u2019s  management  systems  and  structure  barely  allow  for  effective  planning, \nallocation,  and  monitoring  of  resources.  Consequently,  DWASA  has  difficulty  serving  its \ncustomers effectively. \n \n16.  Important  Features.  Despite  the  huge  challenges,  Bangladesh\u2019s  water  sector  also \npresents a significant opportunity. The Government is strongly emphasizing development of the \nsector in its NPRS, which has broad funding agency support (Appendix 3). The SDP-WSSB, \ndeveloped through extensive consultation, outlines a clear and comprehensive vision for the \nsector. The Government and its external development partners are taking a broad-based and \ndeliberate  approach  to  sector  reform  and  institutional  change.  Momentum  in  the  sector  is \nsignificant, and the current environment is conducive to change. Other development partners \nwere  consulted  extensively  during  project  preparation.  As  a  result,  the  timing  is  well \nsynchronized  with  the  sector  reform  initiatives  of  other  development  partners  aimed  at \nstrengthening WASAs and water supply bodies within pourashavas, and giving them greater \nresponsibility and autonomy.  \n \n17.   Lessons Learned. The past and ongoing ADB projects in the sector include (i) District \nTowns Water Supply Project10 ($14.4 million), (ii) Second Water Supply and Sanitation Project11 \n($31 million), and (iii) Secondary Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project12 ($41 \nmillion).  ADB\u2019s  first  investment  was  rated  partly  successful.13 The  second,  which  included \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1982.

In other post-project evaluation assessments, ADB found DWASA to be a well-\nestablished  institution  with  adequate  technical  and  institutional  capacities.15 However,  the \nassessment recommended the preparation of an adequate investment program for the future, \nwith corresponding O&M, to properly maintain the water supply, sanitation, and drainage system \nfor Dhaka. Based on other key lessons learned, successful projects should (i) add enforceable \nmilestones in the form of a phased performance-based funding approach; (ii) place high priority \non financial performance and autonomy of the local water supplying bodies, adopting double-\nentry accounting systems, separating water supply accounts, training staff, and embracing the \nmove to public limited company operating models; (iii) reduce the number of contracts and \nprocurements to minimize processing and implementation delays; and (iv) actively engage local \ncommunity stakeholders through extensive consultations to ensure stronger commitment and \nsmoother implementation.  \n \n18.   ADB is taking the lead in supporting water supply improvements in Dhaka, while the \nWorld  Bank  is  focusing  on  sewerage  and  drainage  improvements,  as  well  as  scaling  up \nsuccessful WSS service provision models in low-income communities and slums of Dhaka, \njointly with Department for International Development (DFID). The Government of Japan is \nfocusing  on  WSS  services  in  Chittagong.  Danish  International  Development  Assistance \n(Danida) is providing assistance for a new surface water treatment plant (Saidabad, phase II) to \naugment the water supply sources in Dhaka.    \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n19.  The overall expected impact of the DWSSDP is to contribute to sustained economic \ngrowth and improved public health conditions in the urban centers of Bangladesh, particularly in \nthe DMA, by improving water supply services. The DWSSDP is the first phase of a long-term \nsupport program for the urban water supply sector based on the Partnership Framework that the \nexternal development partners and the Government agreed upon (paragraphs 57\u201358 for details). \nThe successful implementation of the DWSSDP will help reduce child mortality and improve \ngeneral health, increase the productivity of women by shortening the time required to fetch and \nstore  water,  and  conserve  precious  natural  resources\u2014the  surface  and  groundwater.  The \nprogram and project loans under the DWSSDP are designed to complement each other in \nachieving progress towards these key goals. \n \nB.   The Program Loan  \n \n1.  Outcomes \n \n20.  The program loan will support the reforms in the urban water supply sector laid out in \nSDP-WSSB 2006 by assisting the Government in improving the governance and management \nof urban water supply institutions, including pourashavas and WASAs. The reforms under the \nprogram loan will help achieve the sustainable provision and operation of improved water supply \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2004.

The  reforms  include  (i)  improving  local  governance,  and \nstrengthening  local  institutional  framework;  (ii)  preparing  sector  strategy  (demand-side \nmanagement);  (iii)  improving  financial  sustainability;  and  (iv)  strengthening  DWASA \ngovernance, organizational structure, and financial management capacity. Appendix 4 presents \na development policy letter and policy matrix of the Program along with strategic goals, key \ntargets, and process for each output. \n \n2.  Policy Framework and Actions    \n \na.  Improving Local Governance, and Strengthening Local Institutional \nFramework \n \n21.  Decentralize and Improve the Financial Autonomy of Pourashavas and WASAs. \nThe urban sector in Bangladesh comprises six city corporations (Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, \nKhulna, Rajshahi, and Sylhet) and 309 pourashavas.16 WSS services in urban areas are the \nresponsibility of WASAs (in Dhaka and Chittagong), and the WSS sections established by the \nauthorities in the other city corporations and pourashavas. The DPHE under LGD implements \nwater supply system network expansion and major rehabilitation programs in pourashavas. \nAfter completing the programs, DPHE hands over the systems to the PWSSs for O&M. The \nactivities  of  the  PWSSs  are  restricted  mostly  to  operation  of  the  electrical  pumps  for  the \nproduction  wells  and  reactive  maintenance  of  the  existing  systems  (e.g.,  repair  of  leaks). \nWASAs and PWSSs still lack autonomy in many areas. For example, pourashavas need to \nobtain permission from the Government to create posts or to appoint staff in their setup. They \nalso have to seek approval from the Government on tariff changes. In the past, this practice has \nrestricted  the  pourashavas  and  WASAs  to  managing  the  O&M  of  water  supply  in  their \nrespective  areas.  Pourashavas  and  WASAs  need  to  be  decentralized  and  given  broader \nadministrative and financial autonomy to (i) manage the water supply system, including the \ninstallation and O&M of the facilities in their respective areas; (ii) manage billing; and (iii) \ndetermine the appropriate tariff increase.  \n \n22.  Establish  an  Independent  Water  Supply  Sector  Regulatory  Commission.  In \nBangladesh, regulatory bodies for telecommunications and power were approved in 2002. In the \nsame  year,  the  establishment  of  a  regulator  for  the  water  sector  was  proposed,  but  little \nprogress  has  been  made  since  then.  Regulators  are  often  perceived  as  protectors  of  the \ninterests of the general public (the customers of a public services utility) against commercial \ninterests  of  private  operators.  Regulators  should  ensure  a  fair,  stable,  and  clear  enabling \nenvironment for service providers and consumers. The Program will support LGD to prepare a \nstudy on the most appropriate form for regulatory body for the Bangladesh WSS sector, and \nmake recommendations to the appropriate authority (the Cabinet). The study will clarify the \nfunctions, roles, and responsibilities of the regulator. Once LGD makes the recommendation, \nthe Government is expected to establish an independent water supply regulatory commission, \nas envisaged in SDP-WSSB. \n \n23.  Enhance Capacity of Pourashavas and WASAs in Managing and Delivering Water \nSupply Services. To improve the performance of the water supply utilities, and to cope with the \nincreasing demand for high-quality services and investments, the capacity of the staff and \nworkforce should be enhanced constantly. LGD, DWASA, and DPHE need to prepare and \npublish a 5-year capacity building program for PWSS and WASA staff, including (i) meter \n                                                 \n16  The pourashavas are classified into class A, B, and C, depending on their revenue. The primary targets of the  \n  Program are large pourashavas, rated class A, with established PWSS.  ", "  7\nconnection,  (ii)  water  conservation,  (iii)  O&M,  (iv)  billing  and  accounting,  (v)  financial \nmanagement, and (vi) public health. Starting in 2010, LGD, pourashavas, and WASAs will \nimplement the program, and the PWSS and WASA staff will receive training under the program. \nEach year, LGD will allocate sufficient budget to the pourashavas and the WASAs for the \ntraining of the water section staff.  \n \nb.  Preparing Sector Strategy and Plan (Demand-side Management) \n \n24.   Promote Effective  Water  Management  and  Conservation.  As consumers are not \naccustomed to conserving water, they will use and waste water whenever water is in the pipe. \nWater consumption depends on the availability of water in the pipe network, and is not based on \nthe actual demand. Incentives to conserve water and penalties for wasteful use are absent. \nLikewise, no incentives or penalties are in place for hygienic sanitation. The Government should \naddress the physical problem to realize stable and regular water flow in the network. It also \nmust educate the public through awareness campaigns that explain in simple terms that water \ndistribution incurs costs, and that each user is responsible for keeping the entire system clean, \nefficient, and sustainable. The Program should target all age groups, including primary school \nchildren. To further promote water conservation, LGD together with pourashavas and WASAs \nshould suspend the practice wherein each household installs its own water connections and \nmeters. To ensure that meters installed in households meet the desired standard of quality, the \npourashavas and WASAs should install them.  \n \nc.  Improving Financial Sustainability \n25.  Decentralize and Improve the Financial Autonomy of Pourashavas and WASAs. \nThe SDP-WSSB points out that water tariffs in Bangladesh generally are too low. In most towns, \ntariffs are insufficient to cover even the O&M costs, meaning the capital investment costs are \nnot recovered. Poor collection efficiency exacerbates the situation. LGD and DPHE will allow \npourashavas to keep their revenues from water billings. LGD will instruct each of pourashava to \nset up a separate account for water revenues, establish double-entry bookkeeping for the \nPWSS, and maintain a sound inventory of the pourashava\u2019s water supply assets. Further, LGD \nwill allow the pourashavas and the WASAs to set and increase the water tariff in their respective \nareas annually, maintaining a level that would enable them to recover at least O&M costs after \nadjusting for inflation. \n \nd.  Strengthening DWASA Governance, Organizational Structure, and \nFinancial Management Capacity \n \n26.  Introduce  and  Apply  Good  Governance.  To  achieve  good  governance,  the \norganizational structure and management of DWASA should be improved, and compliance with \nthe WASA Act of 199617 should be ensured. Three main issues related to the implementation of \nthe 1996 act are pending for DWASA: (i) appointment of the managing director,18 (ii) approval of \nthe DWASA organization chart, 19 and (iii) implementation of the rules and regulations of the act. \nThe  DWASA  Act  grants  the  managing  director  a  tenure  of  3  years.  However,  managing \ndirectors  have  been  replaced  frequently  in  the  past  3  years.  The previous  four  managing \n                                                 \n17 Government of Bangladesh. 1996. Water Supply and Sewerage Authority Act,1996. Dhaka. \n18 During the ADB Appraisal Mission in August 2007, a new DWASA managing director was selected through a \ncompetitive process, appointed, and assumed office on 17 August. The new managing director is given an initial \ntenure of 3 years.   \n19 Organization chart is commonly referred to as \u201cOrganogram\u201d in Bangladesh, showing the overall structure of an \norganization with departments, divisions, levels and number of posts.   \n ", " 8   \ndirectors  were  officials  seconded  from  the  Government.  With  frequent  changes  in  top \nmanagement,  it  is  difficult  for  DWASA  to  improve  performance  in  a  well-planned  and \ncoordinated manner. Each managing director usually brings a different approach, leading to \nfrequent changes in the way DWASA operates. The second issue is that DWASA does not have \nan organization chart. A draft organization chart was prepared and has been awaiting approval \nfor 10 years. Without an approved organization chart, DWASA has been unable to make major \nchanges in staff positions from the organizational structure prescribed by the outdated 1963 \nact.20 As a result, some departments might have too many staff for the required tasks, while \nothers might not have enough. The third issue is the implementing rules and regulations of the \n1996 act. Draft rules and regulations have been prepared, but not approved. While the 1996 act \ngoverns the overall operation, the rules and regulations are still based on the 1963 ordinance, \nmuch of which is outdated and obsolete. The main constraints on the institutional setting of \nDWASA  are  political.  Reforms  to  overcome  these  limitations  must  promote  DWASA\u2019s \nownership. An immediate amendment of the 1996 act is not considered essential, but the act \nmust be implemented properly to strengthen the operation of DWASA.  \n \n27.   Delineate Responsibilities Between the Board and the Managing Director. The \ninstitutional strengthening of DWASA will aim to modify the rules and regulations to ensure an \nautonomous operational environment, including restructuring of the board and management, \nand the establishment of effective management systems. The 1996 act is not clear on how \nmuch authority the managing director has to make decisions on day-to-day business affairs. \nSome provisions contradict others. In many of the provisions, the day-to-day business decisions \nby the managing director must be endorsed by the board and approved by the Government. \nThis means that the Government might delay decisions on small matters that need to be \naddressed quickly. As a result, DWASA is not an efficient, responsible, and customer-oriented \ninstitution. To be efficient, the roles and responsibilities of the board and the managing director \nmust be defined clearly. In addition, certain day-to-day activities of DWASA still require board \napproval.  DWASA  management  should  initiate  immediately  a  dialogue  with  the  board  to \ndetermine how much power it will delegate.  \n \n28.   Under the 1996 act, WASA should be able to manage its facilities and operate with a \nhigh degree of autonomy. DWASA should have a board that consists of key professionals from \ncivil society, and should be headed by a chairman appointed by the Government. However, its \nautonomy is constrained by a provision in the 1996 act that requires the board to seek approval \nfrom the Government on all matters in which the Government finances or acts as a warranty for \nfinance.21 The financial dependency of WASAs on the Government further constrains their \nperformance.  This  situation  results  in  decisions  on  crucial  operational  and  organizational \naspects, including human resource development and employment, setting of tariffs and salaries, \nnot being made without the prior approval of the Government. This often can affect decisions on \nday-to-day operations. \n \n29.   Improve DWASA Operation and Business Performance Through a Medium-Term \nBusiness Plan. The 1996 act established a framework for the responsibilities and mandate of \nWASAs. However, as an agency responsible for the water supply, sewerage, and drainage in \nDhaka, DWASA should have an organizational vision of its own. DWASA should have at least a \n5-year business plan that explains its current strengths and weaknesses. In addition, a practical \noperations  manual  should  be  devised  and  put  into  effect,  laying  out  concrete  day-to-day \n                                                 \n20 Government of Bangladesh. 1963.

Explore Private Sector Participation and Elimination of Conflicts of Interest. The \nactive presence of various labor unions and employers\u2019 cooperative societies constrains the \nmanagement of DWASA. Billing and revenue collection in three of six water supply zones of \nDhaka, covering approximately half the population and service connections, has been handled \nby  DWASA  Employees  Consumer  Supplies  Co-operative  Society  through  the  Program  for \nPerformance Improvement (PPI) agreement. 22 The PPI agreements are based on performance. \nThe billing efficiency of the PPI zones are generally higher than in the DWASA zones. However, \nthe division of responsibilities between DWASA staff and PPI staff is unclear and impractical in \nsome areas. For example, controlling unaccounted-for water is DWASA\u2019s responsibility, while \nPPI handles identification and disconnection of illegal connections. Further, meter maintenance \nis  under  DWASA,  while  meter  reading  is  under  PPI.  This  PPI  arrangement  has  various \nproblems, as it creates new vested interests within DWASA and has conflict of interests that \nshould be eliminated. The metering, billing, and collecting must be outsourced to a separate \nentity; and PPI should be abolished or revamped to create a more appropriate system. Two of \nthe unions are affiliated with the two major political parties, while the third is independent. \nPolitical interventions interfere with and jeopardize the management\u2019s ability to recruit, promote, \nand post the right persons at the right positions. A committee must be established to explore \nprivate sector participation to bring good corporate governance into WASAs. The committee will \nprepare a study and make recommendations with a time-bound action plan. The committee also \nwill review the existing PPI and recommend ways to eliminate conflicts of interest.  \n \n31.   Develop Financial Plan and Model for Future Investment. DWASA needs to assess \nfuture  investment  needs  at  least  up  to  2025,23 and  recommend  a  financial  modeling  and \nmanagement structure to manage those needs. In this exercise, DWASA needs to analyze the \ntariff structure, determine the required tariff increases to address future financing needs, and \nassess financing conditions and capital investment needs. As semiautonomous utilities, WASAs \nneed a financial model of their operations that is based on audited WASA financial data, and \nseveral scenarios for key performance enhancement. The key performance areas will include (i) \nreduction of nonrevenue water, (ii) improvement in the collection ratio and reduction in accounts \nreceivables, (iii) improvement in staffing ratio, and (iv) adjustment of energy and chemical \nconsumption.    \n \n32.   Increase  Transparency  in  DWASA  Operation  and  Address  Corruption  Issues. \nDWASA is not immune to allegations of illegal practices ranging from unrecorded connections, \nmeter  tampering,  overbilling,  and  non-transparent  collections.  DWASA  will  establish  an \nanticorruption ethics committee and appoint members to the committee. The committee, which \nreports  to  the  managing  director,  is  assigned  to  investigate  corruption  allegations  within \nDWASA. DWASA also will establish a grievance redress mechanism to address concerns of \ncustomers and stakeholders.   \n \n33.   Improve  DWASA  Financial  Management  and  Performance.  With  the  support  of \nadvisory technical assistance from the World Bank\u2019s Performance Improvement Program (PIP) \n                                                 \n22 On 10 June 2007, the High Court ruled that allowing private operators to carry out the PPI initiative is against the \nprovision of WASA Act 1996, and revoked DWASA\u2019s move to outsource the billing and tariff collection.  \n23 DWASA. 2007. Past, Present and Future of Dhaka WASA. Managing director presentation material; includes \nneeds until 2025.  \n ", " 10   \nto DWASA, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)\u2019s support to Chittagong Water \nSupply  and  Sewerage  Authority  (CWASA),  both  WASAs  have  gone  through  a  diagnostic \nanalysis. The analyses focused on the WASAs\u2019 overall performance against the provisions of \nthe  1996  Act  and  1963  Ordinance  respectively  to  identify  main  constraints  of  WASA \nmanagement. The financial regulations (1969) still govern the financial transactions of DWASA. \nThe regulations need to be updated for the organization to transform itself into a commercially \nsustainable  entity.24 Roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  staff  who  are  involved  in  financial \nmanagement  and  transactions  must  be  clearly  defined  with  proper  delegation  of  financial \npowers. During the early to mid-1990s, with the assistance of a World Bank project25, DWASA \nintroduced a computer-based, double-entry accounting system. However, when implementation \nof the World Bank project was terminated, DWASA reverted to the old single-entry, handwriting-\nbased  system.  For  sound  corporate  financial  accounting,  all  assets  should  be  evaluated \nproperly, and an internationally accepted double-entry accounting system must be reintroduced. \nFor the past several years, audit reports produced by DWASA have been unable to attach an \naudit opinion. Audits have not followed internationally acceptable accounting guidelines, and \ninconsistencies  have  been  observed.  This  needs  to  be  improved,  reflecting  the \nrecommendations of the World Bank diagnostic analysis. The same applies for CWASA on its \naudit. Based on the improvement in auditing, as well as the introduction and implementation of \nthe  PIP,  DWASA  will  issue  audited  annual  reports  that  will  be  made  publicly  available  in \npreparation for becoming a public limited company in future.   \n \n34.  Reduce  Illegal  Connections  and  Assign  DWASA  Full  Responsibility  in  Water \nConnection  and  Metering  System.  DWASA  will  establish  a  baseline  survey  on  illegal \nconnections by the end of 2009.  Based on the survey, DWASA will issue a time-bound action \nplan to address the problem of illegal connections. In line with the action plan, DWASA will \nreduce illegal connections by at least 25% by the end of 2010 in the four zones of Dhaka city \nthat will be covered by the ADB-supported Project. \n \n3.  Financing Plan \n \n35.   The Government has requested a loan of SDR31,843,000 ($50 million equivalent) from \nADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund (ADF) to help finance the Program. The loan will have an \namortization period of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an annual interest \ncharge of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The loan proceeds will be available \nfor withdrawal in two tranches of SDR15,922,000 (first tranche) and SDR15,921,000 (second \ntranche), ($25 million equivalent) upon compliance with the agreed upon conditions. The first \ntranche  will  be  released  upon  meeting  all  first  tranche  release  conditions  and  upon  loan \neffectiveness; the second tranche will be released upon meeting the second tranche release \nconditions, as provided in the policy matrix in Appendix 4. \n \n36.   In determining the amount of the program loan, the following factors were considered: (i) \nthe relative importance of urban infrastructure sector in terms of public spending, (ii) the scope \nand strength of the reform package in the WSS sector, and (iii) the short- and medium-term \ncosts of the reforms and the associated financing gap. The loan amount covers part of the \nadjustment costs for the measures included in the policy matrix from FY2007 to FY2013 for the \nprogram loan and its update. \n                                                 \n24 CWASA also has been assisted by JBIC on capacity building to improve its financial performance. \n25 World Bank. 1996.

For  the  program  loan,  the  executing \nagencies (EAs) will be the Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and LGD of the \nMinistry  of  Local  Government,  Rural  Development  and  Cooperatives.  DWASA  will  be  the \nImplementing Agency (IA) for certain activities, as specified in the policy matrix. The EAs will be \nresponsible for coordination of the program loan during implementation, including complying \nwith all policy actions, program administration, and maintenance of all program records.  \n \n38.   Implementation Period. The program implementation period is from December 2007 to \nDecember  2013.26 The Government will have to complete all conditions for the first tranche \nbefore its release, which is expected by December 2007. The main triggers for the first tranche \nare  (i)  DWASA  organization  chart,  (ii)  Rules  and  Regulation  of  WASA  Act  1996,  and  (iii) \nappointment of DWASA managing director. The remaining policy actions during the program \nimplementation period, as well as certain policy actions, must be fulfilled before the second \ntranche may be released. Some of the main triggers for the second tranche are (i) broader \nadministrative and financial autonomy to WASAs, (ii) separation of water accounts, (iii) DWASA \n5-year business plan, and (iv) anticorruption ethics committee within DWASA. The second \ntranche release is expected before 15 December 2010. Details are in Appendix 4. \n \n39.   Procurement and Disbursement. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign \nexchange cost (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB \nmember  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  (Appendix  5)  and  imports  financed  by  other \nbilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirement for Program Loans,27 the reimbursement \nprocedure will be used to disburse the loan proceeds based on certification by the Government. \nSupporting import documentation will not be required if, during each year that loan proceeds are \nexpected  to  be  disbursed,  the  total  value  of  the  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember \ncountries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is \nequal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during that year. For \nthe  first  tranche,  the  import  certification  may  cover  goods  procured  180  days  before  loan \neffectiveness. With each withdrawal request, the Government will certify its compliance with this \nformula. Otherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be required. ADB \nreserves the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds.   \n \n40.   Counterpart Funds. The Government will use the counterpart funds generated by the \nprogram loan, under arrangements satisfactory to ADB, to support sector reform and meet the \nadjustment costs associated with the loan. Further, the counterpart funds will be transferred \nfrom MOF to LGD to meet the costs and counterpart funding requirements for implementing the \nsector reform. \n \n41.   Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. LGD will monitor continually the \nimplementation of the Program and its impact, in line with the program framework and outcome \nindicators ADB and the Government agreed upon. Further, LGD will submit to ADB quarterly \nreports until the Program is completed. Data from the PIP, annual report, audit reports, and \nauditor\u2019s opinion will be used to monitor the progress of the Program. \n \n                                                 \n26 The second tranche disbursement is projected at the end of 2010, but the program loan duration is until the end of \n2013 to monitor the reforms progress. \n27 ADB. 1998.

The Project will contribute to sustainable provision and operation of urban water supply \nservices, particularly in Dhaka city, by rehabilitating and strengthening the water supply system \nbased on the long-term policy and investment road map. The physical investment under the \nProject  will  be  complemented  by  capacity  building  of  DWASA  to  enable  the  authority  to \ncompetently manage the water supply systems for approximately 12.3 million people in Dhaka \ncity. The Project has three main components: \n \n  a.  Component A: Distribution System and Quality Improvement  \n \n43.   This component of the Project will involve physical rehabilitation and optimization of \nDWASA\u2019s water distribution network to minimize losses and enable 24-hour pressurized water \nsupply, and provision of water quality assurance and control measures. Four zones (zones 3, 4, \n5, and 6) have been selected for priority improvement by the Project for the following reasons: 28 \n \n(i)  DWASA  has  progressively  rehabilitated  and  replaced  most  of  the  old  pipes \ndating to the 19th century in zones 1 and 2 under various Government-funded \nprojects. Further, despite their dense populations, zones 1 and 2 have low to \nmoderate pressure in the supply lines, resulting in less leakage than in the \nremaining zones. \n(ii)  DWASA is planning to bring additional water from the proposed Saidabad II and \nKhilkhet water treatment plants (WTP) to meet the growing future demands of the \ncity (Supplementary Appendix A). The distribution network in the project zones \nwill receive most of the additional water. If the project zones are not rehabilitated, \nthis water supply will cause more leakage from the system and minimize the \nimpacts from the proposed supply augmentation. \n(iii)  Zone 4 has the most \u201cspaghetti connections\u201d29 with resulting leakage. Similarly, \nzones 3, 5, and 6 reportedly account for more physical losses than zones 1 and \n2.  \n(iv)  Population growth in zones 1 and 2 seems to have reached saturation level, \nwhile the population in the remaining four zones continues to increase rapidly.  \n(v)  DFID is assisting DWASA with improvements in many slum and low-income \nareas of zones 1 and 2 and improvement in the project zones is expected to \nbenefit the largest number of poor and slum dwellers.  \n \n44.   The component consists of the following: \n \n      i.   Distribution Network Rehabilitation and Strengthening  \n \n45.   This  subcomponent  involves  the  following  physical  works  in  the  project  zones:  (i) \nrehabilitation of primary and secondary distribution networks, including lining or replacement of \npipes, as required; (ii) removal of spaghetti connections, and provision of tertiary distribution \nnetwork  (optimization)  and  house  connections;  (iii)  provision  of  additional  supply  lines  to \n                                                 \n28 DWASA is responsible for seven zones, however, the seventh zone Narayanganj is geographically isolated from \nother six, and is outside the traditional Dhaka City boundary. In early 1990, Narayanganj Town merged with \nDWASA; however Narayanganj is not part of the Project\u2019s first phase.  \n29 Spaghetti connection refers to illegally tapped water (not formally arranged by DWASA), usually connected via \nrubber lines that look like boiled spaghetti.    ", " 13\nidentified fringe and slum areas;30 (iv) rehabilitation of 24 overhead reservoirs, and provision of \n14 new overhead reservoirs; and (v) installation of valves, and bulk and household water meters \nto isolate hydraulic zones and allow measurement of supply and consumption at all ends. In \nconducting the outlined activities, this subcomponent also aims to remove and regularize all \nillegal  or  unregistered  connections  within  the  project  zones.  Based  on  market  pricing  and \nviability, a significant portion of the distribution network rehabilitation works is expect to be \ncarried out using trench-less technologies.  \n \nii.  Water Quality and Monitoring System Improvement  \n \n46.   This subcomponent involves provision and rehabilitation of disinfection or chlorination \nfacilities at all supply points in DWASA\u2019s service area in Dhaka city. It also entails establishment \nof a two-tier water quality monitoring system, including provision of water quality monitoring in \nthe inadequate existing laboratory facility.31 \n \n    b.  Component B: Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening  \n \n47.   Component B consists of the following subcomponents: (i) institutionalization of sound \nfinancial management, efficient billing, revenue collection, and customer record systems; (ii) \nprovision  of  comprehensive  training  for  all  levels  of  DWASA  staff  to  optimize  operational \nperformance and upgrading of training facilities; and (iii) an extensive demand control and \nawareness campaign for consumers. \n \n  i.  Financial Management Improvement \n \n48.   The subcomponent will assist DWASA in substantially reforming and improving financial \nmanagement for (i) strategic business planning using financial simulation models, (ii) results-\noriented budget mechanisms, (iii) sustainable debt management, (iv) tariff reforms, (v) efficient \nand accurate double-entry accounting system and auditing procedures, (vi) accurate billing and \npayment collection through staff training and establishment of customer database, and (vii) \ntransparency  through  compulsory  publication of  annual  reports.  The  financial  and  capacity \nbuilding (FCB) consultants will assist DWASA in designing the most appropriate and financially \nsustainable tariff structure to recover all costs. The tariff structure will be designed with due \nconsideration on affordability of low-income households. \n \n49.   After  the  completion  of  the  pipeline  rehabilitation,  a  management  contract  will  be \nawarded on a pilot basis to a private contractor for one of the four project zones to assist \nDWASA in operating the rehabilitated assets during the contract period. In addition, twinning \narrangements are considered with other water utilities in south and south-east Asia operating \nefficiently at a high quality standard, to learn and gain hands-on knowledge transfer from them. \nA technical assistance (TA) project32 has supported the establishment of twinning arrangements \n                                                 \n30 The NGO and CBO sector in Bangladesh is very well developed, and the Project aims to leverage their capacity by \ninvolving them in efforts to increase awareness among the population in Dhaka. At least 15% of the improved water \nsupply flowing through the Project is expected to target low-income communities using standpipes and communal \ntaps.  \n31 Currently, the laboratory does not have an analytical environment. The laboratory facilities are lacking basic things, \nsuch as reagents, glassware, working table, distilled water, and proper electrical balance; as well as a computer for \nproper documentation and air conditioning. A superintending engineer should be appointed and designated as \nlaboratory coordinator.   \n32 This will be financed through ADB. 2007.

The Project will work with the World Bank-supported project, which is assisting DWASA \nwith aligning its core business procedures based on a new PIP. The design and management \n(D&M) consultants will support the project management unit (PMU) by identifying key indicators \nand business procedures for monitoring DWASA\u2019s operational performance, increasing water \nsupply  coverage,  establishing  appropriate  service  and  consumption  levels,  and  ensuring \nefficiency  in  operations  and  financial  management,  and  consumer  satisfaction.  Monitoring \nperformance  indicators  will  include  time-bound  target  and  achievement  reporting  (monthly, \nquarterly,  and  annually)  for  the  individual  major  items  of  works  (e.g.,  construction  and \nrehabilitation of pipelines, new connections, repair responsiveness, and bill collection). \n \n  ii.  Training and Capacity Building  \n \n51.   This subcomponent will involve developing training modules and providing training to \nDWASA staff for optimized operational performance, as well as to staff of the zone offices (each \nserving about 1.5 million people) to provide all services to the customers as a one-stop service \ncenter. It also will entail capacity building of plumbers, pump operators, and technicians through \nthe provision of training guidelines, and continuation or provision of plumbers and technician \ntraining.33 \n \n52.  Under this subcomponent, the DWASA training center established under the World \nBank-financed project34 at Lalmatia35 will be strengthened, the physical facilities of the training \ncenter will be rehabilitated, and training tools will be provided. \n  \n    iii.  Demand Control and Public Awareness \n \n53.  A comprehensive and phased public awareness campaign will be designed with the \nobjectives of (i) informing the public on the purpose and outline of the proposed tariff reforms; \n(ii) creating awareness that water is a scarce and valuable commodity; (iii) informing the public \nof possible service disruptions and measures undertaken during project implementation; (iv) \nimproving public relations and the image of DWASA; (v) educating the public on negative \nconsequences of using suction pumps, and minimizing wasted water at household level; (vi) \noffering incentives to the public on meter installation and meter reading to allow consumers to \nreport artificial bill inflation from the meter readers; and (vii) informing the public about the \ncustomer grievance redress mechanism introduced under the Project. \n \n54.  The subcomponent will address these objectives through (i) a mass media campaign, \nsuch as through television, radio, and cinema, to disseminate and educate the population; (ii) \nengagement of nongovernment organizations (NGO) to develop educational materials, and to \nengage and coordinate field-workers in conducting community meetings and household visits; \nand (iii) development of information materials, such as brochures and display boards before, \nduring, and after rehabilitation work in the supply zones. \n                                                 \n33 More than 600 plumbers working for DWASA are being trained as part of the pilot Manikdi study.  \n34 World Bank. 1996.

Consulting support will include (i) project management and monitoring; \n(ii) detailed planning and design activities; (iii) contract structuring, tendering, execution, and \nmanagement;  (iv)  construction  supervision;  (v) preparation  of  demand  control  and  public \nawareness  campaign,  including  the  tariff  awareness  program;  and  (vii) identification  and \ndevelopment  of  institutional  strengthening  measures,  training  modules,  and  guidelines  and \nmanuals, and provision of training. Consulting services also will include engagement of NGOs to \nmanage parts of the demand control and community awareness program. \n \n56.  In addition, consultants will assist DWASA in conducting a feasibility study for an optimal \nlocation for a future surface WTP with a capacity of 500 million liters per day (mld). The \nconsultants also will prepare an outline design and prepare tender documents for the WTP. (A \ndetailed project description is in Supplementary Appendix B). \n \n2.  Special Features \n \n57.  The  proposed  Program  is  part  of  a  coordinated  partnership  between  external \ndevelopment partners and the Government to reform the urban WSS sector in Bangladesh, with \na focus on Dhaka city, through a medium-term reform and investment program. The proposed \nreforms under the Program are based on the Government\u2019s SDP-WSSB 2006, and have been \nformulated in consultation with the main development partners in the sector, including Danida, \nDFID, JBIC, and World Bank. Each development partner\u2019s activities have been coordinated both \nin  terms  of  reform  actions  and  support  for  investment  loans.  Figure  1  shows  how  the \ndevelopment  partners\u2019  programs  fit  together  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  reforms  and \ninvestment programs for the urban WSS sector. For example, Danida is providing about $130 \nmillion for the construction of Saidabad II WTP and an adjoining small-scale pre-treatment plant. \nDFID is planning to provide sector budget support to LGD. JBIC has committed around \u00a512.2 \nbillion to CWASA for the Karnaphuli WTP and capacity development of CWASA; Government of \nJapan (JBIC) plans to further assist CWASA in future capital investments jointly with Korea \nInternational Cooperation Agency(KOICA), Government of Italy, and World Bank. Government \nof Korea will extend assistance to the preparation of a master plan for water supply and \nwastewater management in Chittagong. World Bank is planning to assist DWASA with its \nsewerage and drainage services improvements with $100 million.   \n \n58.   Unified  Policy  Framework  and  Investment  Road  Map.  In  November  2007,  the \nexternal development partners and the Government signed a partnership framework (Appendix \n3) outlining the partnership arrangements and agree on the urban WSS sector reforms to be \ncarried out by the Government, particularly by the LGD, DWASA, and CWASA. The framework \nwill include (i) core understandings that specify and outline the reforms to be implemented \nurgently; (ii) a unified policy framework for DWASA and CWASA, which list all reforms to be \ncarried out by the Government and two WASAs in 2007\u20132010; and (iii) a brief sector investment \nroad map, which outlines the TA and investment projects planned for Bangladesh in the urban \nWSS sector (Figure 1).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " 16   \n \n \nFigure 1: Partnership Framework for the Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \n \n  Unified Policy Matrix and Investment Roadmap \n     \n     \nLGD, DWASA,  MOF and Planning \n  and CWASA  Commission \n        \n     \nTimeline  DANIDA  ADB   Japan   Republic of  World Bank  Government \nKorea  \nFY2007  -DWASA-  -DWASA-  -DWASA-  -CWASA-  -DWASA-  Allocations to \n  Saidabad II  Dhaka Water  Improvement  Preparation of  Dhaka  support Sector \n  Water  Supply Sector  of Storm  Master Plan  Sewerage  Development \n  Treatment  Development Water  for Water  and Drainage  Programme-\nFY2010  Plant (Phase  Program  Drainage  Supply and  Project   Water and \n  II)  (DWSSDP)  System  Wastewater  ($100 million)  Sanitation Sector \n  ($130 million)  ($200 million)  (\u00a5600 million)  Management    in Bangladesh \n  Approved    <2007\u20132008>  of the     \n_______  <2007\u20132012>  Advisory TA    Detailed  Implementation \n  for Capacity  -CWASA-  Planned Area  of reform actions \nFY2011  Building   Karnaphuli  of Chittagong  under the Unified \nonward  ($2.5 million)  Water Supply  ($1.5 million  Policy Matrix  \n  Project (\u00a512  Grant)   \nNew  billion JBIC)  <2007\u20132008> \naugmentation  <2005\u20132011> \nscheme    \n(to be  TA for \nprepared  Capacity \nunder  Building and \nDWSSDP)  Reduction of \n  Nonrevenue \nWater (\u00a5 300 \nmillion JICA) \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CWASA = Chittagong Water Supply and Sewerage Authority, DANIDA = Danish \nInternational Development Assistance, DWASA = Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority, DWSSDP = Dhaka Water \nSupply Sector Development Program, JBIC = Japan Bank for International Cooperation, JICA = Japan International \nCooperation Agency, LGD = Local Government Division, SDP-WSSB = Sector Development Programme\u2014Water and \nSanitation Sector in Bangladesh (2006), TA = technical assistance. \nSources: Government of Bangladesh and all participating donors\u2019 estimates.

To address the serious water supply problems in Dhaka, ascertain \nthe cause of irregular water supply, and showcase some concrete steps in remedying the \nsituation, ADB conducted a pilot study in Manikdi area (within zone 4 of DWASA\u2019S service area) \nin Dhaka. The main purposes were to change the mindset of DWASA by demonstrating that 24-\nhour pressurized supply is possible, and that unaccounted-for water can be reduced to an \nacceptable level by addressing the following key issues: (i) accuracy of records; (ii) quality and \ntype  of  materials  (pipes  and  joints)  used;  (iii)  workmanship  traditions;  (iv)  magnitude  of \nunregistered connections; (v) O&M quality; (vi) water demand analysis and expectations; and \n(vii) quantification of produced water into four categories: physical losses, where water escapes \nfrom the network through leaks before it reaches customers; administrative losses, where water \nreaches the consumer but is not billed; water wasted by consumers; and water serving the ", " 17\ndemand of the beneficiary. The pilot study (from March 2006 to December 2007) covered 440 \nservice connections in Manikdi. It confirmed that the high technical losses were due to (i) bad \nservice connections and clamps, (ii) poor quality pipe joints, (iii) spaghetti connections using \npoor quality coil pipes, (iv) invisible leaks in most of pipes and fittings, (v) several connections \nunder  one  registered  connection,  and  (vi)  bypass  line  consumption.  Through  appropriate \ninterventions to address these issues, the Manikdi pilot project reduced the physical losses from \n53%  in  March  2006  to  14%  in  January  2007,  along  with  increasing  water  pressure  and \nimproving meters and meter reading in the pilot area. Similarly, the length of distribution network \npipes increased from 2.5 kilometers (km) to 4.6 km, spaghetti connections reduced from 418 to \nzero, and average hours of supply increased from 4.8 hours to 24 hours in the pilot area.36 \nThrough the Manikdi pilot study, some essential data have been collected and adopted in the \ndesign  of  the  Project,  including  (i)  actual  water  demand  at  the  household  level,  (ii)  tariff \ncollection challenges and improvement, (iii) technical improvement options for water leaks, and \n(iv) social mobilization methodology. \n \n60.  Plumbers\u2019 Training. During the rectification activities in Manikdi, it became clear that \nmajority  of  the  mistries  (plumbers)  in  Dhaka  have  little  understanding  of  the  required \nmethodologies and tools for proper pipe installation and maintenance, and that training the \nplumbers  in  this  area  is  greatly  needed.  The  Manikdi  pilot  project  trained  more  than  600 \nplumbers working in the DWASA service area to equip them with required skills in installing and \nmaintaining the transmission and distribution networks. Since the Project will need a significant \nnumber of quality plumbers to carry out the proposed rehabilitation and optimization of supply \npipelines, as well as to maintain the network in future, having skilled plumbers would help to \nensure the successful implementation of the Project.  \n \n61.  Community Involvement and Awareness Campaign. Community sensitization was \ncarried out with local social workers and technical workers through public meetings, street \nmeetings, and dialogue in individual houses as part of the project preparatory TA. During these \nmeetings the purpose of the Project, need for repairs, benefits of 24-hour supply, and the need \nfor  the  households  to  improve  their  plumbing  system  to  reduce  losses  were  stressed.  All \nhouseholds in the pilot area were trained in reading the water meter, calibrating the meter, and \nunderstanding the water bills. Such extensive community involvement through this awareness \ncampaign was found to be instrumental in the success of the Manikdi pilot project. As such, this \nhas been included as a core component of the proposed Project. \n \n3.  Project Investment Plan \n62.  The project is estimated to cost $212.7 million, including taxes and duties of $16.1 \nmillion (Table 1). The cost estimates are presented in more detail in Appendix 6 (detailed cost \nestimates is in Supplementary Appendix C).  \n \n                                                 \n36 Details on the Manikdi pilot project are in Supplementary Appendix K. \n ", " 18   \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounts \nA.

Interest during construction on foreign exchange cost has been computed \nat 1% for Special Funds resources,  \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n4.  Financing Plan \n \n63.  The Government has asked ADB to provide a loan equivalent to SDR95,530,000 ($150 \nmillion equivalent) from its Special Funds resources to finance the Project. The Government will \nfinance  the  balance  of  the  cost,  $62.7  million.  ADB  will  finance  the  costs  of  civil  works, \nmaterials,  equipment,  survey,  safeguard  compliance  support,  training,  consulting  services, \nproject O&M, and financial charges during implementation. The Government counterpart funds \nwill be used for financing taxes and duties, resettlement costs, land acquisition, and part of the \ncivil works. \n \n64.  The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years and an interest \ncharge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace period  and 1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The \nBorrower will be the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh, and the proceeds will be relend to \nDWASA through a subsidiary loan agreement with terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. \nRelending terms will include a repayment period of 20 years, including a 5-year grace period, \nand  interest  of  5%  per  year.  The  Government  will  assume  the  foreign  exchange  risk.  A \nsummary of the financing plan is in Table 2; the detailed financing plan is in Appendix 6. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nForeign  Local  Total   Percent \nSource \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n         \nAsian Development Bank (ADF)  35.4  114.6  150.0  70.5 \nGovernment of Bangladesh  0.0  62.7  62.7  29.5 \nTotal  35.4  177.3  212.7  100.0 \nADF = Asian Development Fund. \nSources: Government of Bangladesh and ADB estimates. \n \n5.  Project Management \n \n65.   As the EA, DWASA will be responsible for the overall management, supervision, and \nexecution of the Project. A PMU will be established and will consist of one full-time project \ndirector in the rank of Deputy Managing Director (DMD) or chief engineer or additional chief \nengineer. In addition, there will be three dedicated deputy project directors. The deputy project ", " 19\ndirector  (finance)  will  be  recruited  from  outside  of  DWASA  through  competitive  selection \nprocess. The other two deputy project directors, who will head the technical eastern zone and \nthe technical western zone, will be the rank of the superintending engineers or above. The \nproject director and the three deputy project directors will be appointed exclusively to the \nProject. Four executive engineers will assist the deputy project directors in managing the works \nunder  them.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  all  day-to-day  management  of  the  Project, \nincluding but not limited to (i) preparing the overall project implementation plan and detailed \nwork program; (ii) providing overall monitoring and guidance on implementation of works under \nthe Project; (iii) tendering and executing all contracts; (iv) monitoring and supervising all project \nmanagement activities; (v) preparing necessary project progress and project completion reports; \nand  (vi)  ensuring  full  compliance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  resettlement,  environmental,  and  other \nsafeguards issues and policies.  \n \n66.  Project coordination units (PCU) will be established in the four project zones, each \nheaded by the responsible executive engineer. The PCUs will be responsible for liaising and \ncoordinating with the contractors, the D&M consultants, NGOs, and other stakeholders on all \nday-to-day  implementation  of  project  activities  under  the  concerned  zones.  The  project \nimplementation arrangements are in Appendix 7. To strengthen the PCUs in conducting these \nactivities and addressing their day-to-day O&M issues, DWASA will assign additional staff, for \nthe project period. \n \n67.  An inter-ministerial project steering committee (PSC), chaired by the secretary of LGD, \nwill  be  established  to  provide  policy  guidance  and  overall  coordination  of  project \nimplementation. Its membership will include the managing director, DWASA; project director of \nPMU;  representatives  from  Dhaka  City  Corporation,  Economic  Relations  Division  and  the \nFinance Division of MOF, Planning Commission; the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation \nDivision, RAJUK (the capital development authority); Ministry of Environment and Forestry, \nMinistry of Housing and Works, Ministry of Home Affairs. The PSC will hold its first meeting \nwithin  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  and will  meet  at  least  twice  annually  thereafter,  to \ncoordinate and resolve any issues in project implementation. Minutes of its meetings will be \nforwarded to ADB for information.  \n \n6.  Implementation Period \n68.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years, from January 2008 to December 2013. \nThe implementation schedule of the Project is in Appendix 8. \n \n7.  Procurement  \n69.  Procurement of all goods and services to be financed under the Project will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nAll civil works contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $1 million or more will be procured \nthrough international competitive bidding (ICB). Civil works contracts estimated to cost less than \n$1 million will be procured using national competitive bidding (NCB). To the extent practicable, \ngoods will be grouped into procurement packages larger than $500,000 to be suitable for ICB \nprocedures. Goods that cannot be grouped into larger contracts and are estimated to cost less \nthan $500,000 per contract will be procured through national competitive bidding. A third-party, \npre-shipment inspection provision will be adopted to ensure quality of goods and equipment. \nThe feasibility of community contracting will be examined on a case-by-case basis for slum \nand/or bulk water supply and other community-level works not exceeding $10,000 in value, and \nwill need pre-fact approval by ADB. NCB procedures applicable to the Project are specified in \n ", " 20   \nthe Government\u2019s Public Procurement Act 2003, the Procurement Plan (Appendix 9) and the \nLoan Agreement. Miscellaneous minor goods expected to cost less than the equivalent of \n$100,000  will  be  purchased  using  shopping  procedures.37 Any  necessary  modifications  or \nclarifications  to  Government\u2019s  procedures  will  be  recorded  in  the  legal  document.  NCB \npackages valued at more than $100,000 each will be subject to prior review by ADB. The PMU \nwill ensure that procurement complies with the applicable procedures. Specifically, the PMU will \n(i)  determine  bid  packages  and  propose  procurement  methods,  as  approved  by  ADB;  (ii) \nprepare detailed material lists and specifications; and (iii) evaluate bids and award contracts.  \n \n70.   The  PMU  will  update  annually  the  procurement  plan  (Appendix  9),  which  details \nindicative packages to be funded under the Project, and submit it to ADB for approval. The \ncontract packages, especially for component A, have been designed according to the water \nsupply zones, incorporating lessons learned from Manikdi pilot works, as well as past projects \nimplemented by ADB and other external partners in Bangladesh.  \n \n8.  Consulting Services  \n71.   Consultants will be selected and engaged under the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). An international \nconsulting firm will be engaged as the design and managing consultants (D&M) (183 person-\nmonths of international and 664 person-months of national experts) following ADB\u2019s quality- and \ncost-based selection (QCBS) procedures. The D&M consultants, who will be based in Dhaka, \nwill assist the PMU in managing the Project, preparing the detailed design, supervising the \nworks, and ensuring the technical quality of design and construction. The D&M consultants also \nwill  conduct  the  feasibility  study  for  future  water  source  development,  and  will  prepare \npreliminary design and tender documents.38 \n \n72.  Similarly, one international consulting firm will be engaged as financial and capacity \nbuilding  consultants  (FCB)  (80  person-months  of  international  and  390  person-months  of \nnational  experts)  following  ADB\u2019s  QCBS  procedures.  For  better  coordination  and \nimplementation,  the  FCB  consultants  will  conduct  and  be  responsible  for  implementing  all \nactivities  outlined  in  component  B  of  the  Project,  in  particular:  (i)  preparing  and  providing \noperational and technical training to DWASA staff; (ii) providing corporate financial planning, \nfinancial reforms, and management advisory assistance to DWASA; and (iii) conducting public \nawareness and demand control, as well as resettlement implementation activities. The FCB \nconsultants will engage NGOs to manage parts of the demand control, community awareness \nprogram, and resettlement implementation works (with prior approval of ADB). They also may \nengage  professional  media  firms  to  conduct  the  public  outreach  programs  and  media \ncampaigns. ADB will review and approve the terms of such engagements before they begin. An \ninternational consulting firm (6 person-months of international and 36 person-months of national \nexperts) also will be engaged under ADB\u2019s QCBS procedures as the project performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  (PPME)  consultants  to  conduct  project  performance  monitoring \n(Appendix 10).  \n \n                                                 \n37 Shopping is a procurement method based on comparing price quotations obtained from a minimum of three \nsuppliers (in the case of goods) or contractors (in the case of civil works) to ensure competitive prices. It is an \nappropriate method for procuring readily available off-the-shelf goods or standard specification commodities of \nsmall value, or simple civil works of small value.  \n38 To expedite implementation, the Government requested advance action for the recruitment of  consultants. \nEngagement of consultants is expected to advance up to the stage of technical proposal evaluation. The \nGovernment was informed that approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance the Project.      ", " 21\n73.  In addition, a performance-based management contract (PBMC) will be awarded to \nhandle  outsourced  O&M  operations  (under  component  B-1  after  the  rehabilitation  work  is \ncompleted) on a pilot basis for one of the four zones. For the recruitment of the PBMC, ADB\u2019s \nQCBS  procedures  will  be  followed,  possibly  with  fewer  short-listed  bidders  than  the  six \nmandated under ADB\u2019s applicable guidelines, based on experience. Details on the PBMC are in \nAppendix 11.39  \n \n9.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n74.  Disbursements  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). An imprest account will be \nopened at the Bangladesh Bank in the name of DWASA. The account will be established, \nmanaged, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The imprest \naccount ceiling will be 10% of the loan or the forecast expenditure for the next 6 months, which \never is lower. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedures will be used to reimburse, replenish \nand  liquidate  the  imprest  account  for  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $100,000  per \npayment.  \n \n10.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n75.  The Government and DWASA will maintain records and accounts to identify all goods \nand services financed by the loan proceeds. The PMU will be responsible for maintaining the \nrecords, and will submit annual accounts and financial statements to MOF and ADB. The \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  accounts  and  financial  statements  are  audited  annually,  in \naccordance with sound accounting principles, by independent external auditors acceptable to \nADB. DWASA will provide ADB, not later than 6 months after the close of each fiscal year, \ncertified copies of audited accounts and financial statements, as well as the report of the \nauditor. The imprest account and statement of expenditure records will be audited annually and \na separate audit opinion will be provided.  \n \n76.   The PMU will prepare quarterly progress reports and submit them to ADB and LGD \nwithin 20 days of the end of the applicable period. The reports will be prepared in a format \nacceptable to ADB and will include (i) project progress in each zones and components, (ii) the \nstatus of institutional development activities, (iii) delays and problems encountered and actions \ntaken to resolve them, (iv) compliance with loan covenants, and (v) expected progress during \nthe next 6 months. Within 6 months of the Project\u2019s physical completion, DWASA will prepare \nand submit to ADB through the Government a project completion report, including costs and \ncompliance with loan covenants. \n \n11.  Anticorruption Policy and Governance Measures  \n77.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  EAs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \n                                                 \n39 A two-stage procedure is proposed. The first stage will be for the preparation of a short list of well-qualified \npotential bidders among those who submitted expressions of interest in response to an advertisement. The short-\nlisted companies or consortia will then be invited to submit second-stage proposals containing detailed technical \nplans for the improvements to and operation of the water supply and sewerage systems with financial proposals in \nline with the request for proposals documents. More details of the proposed procedures are in Appendix 11. With \nADB assistance, the attached TA consultants will develop the respective set of requests for proposals and draft \ncontract documents for the PBM modes based on lessons from global experiences with similar contracting \napproaches.  \n ", " 22   \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Program. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EAs  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Program.  \n \n78.   The  Project  incorporates  several  other  measures,  in  addition  to  the  standard  ADB \nrequirements, to deter corruption and increase transparency. The Project will (i) build the EA\u2019s \ncapacity  to  comply  with  ADB  and  Government  procedures,  to  be  outlined  in  the  Project \nAdministration Manual during the early stage of the implementation; (ii) establish a project \nwebsite to disclose information about project implementation; and (iii) establish a grievance \nredress mechanism to ensure greater accountability. The project website will provide updated, \ndetailed  information  on  project  implementation.  For  example,  the  website  will  include \nprocurement-related information, such as the list of participating bidders, name of the winning \nbidder, basic details on bidding procedures adopted, amount of contract awarded, and the list of \ngoods and/or services procured. The grievance redress mechanism will be set up to receive and \nresolve complaints, as well as to act upon stakeholders\u2019 reports of irregularities on project-\nrelated matters, including grievances concerning resettlement. The EA will widely publicize the \nexistence of this mechanism to ensure that stakeholders are aware that a venue is available to \naddress concerns or grievances relating to fraud, corruption, abuse, and any other aspects of \nproject implementation. In addition, consultants acceptable to the ADB will undertake an annual \nperformance audit on physical and financial performance through the attached TA (Appendix \n12). \n \n12.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n79.   The PMU will ensure that a project performance monitoring and evaluation (PPME) \nacceptable to ADB is carried out to (i) examine the Project\u2019s technical performance, (ii) evaluate \nthe delivery of planned facilities, (iii) assess the achievement of the project objectives, and (iv) \nmeasure  the  Project\u2019s  social  and  economic  benefits.  The  PMU  and  D&M  consultants,  in \nconsultation with stakeholders and ADB, will develop a set of PPME indicators at the start of the \nProject. Indicators might include the number of household water connections, the number of \nparticipants  in  awareness  campaigns,  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases,  volume  of  water \nproduced, volume of unaccounted-for water, and billing and collection efficiency. \n  \n80.  The PMU will conduct baseline physical and socioeconomic surveys. It will submit a \ndetailed  implementation  plan  for  monitoring  performance  and  for  preparing  benchmark \ninformation for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 9 months of loan effectiveness. The PMU \nwill  prepare  annual  PPME  reports,  which  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  throughout  project \nimplementation. Monitoring of implementation performance will integrate physical and financial \naspects. During and after project implementation, the PPME consultants will assist the PMU in \nmeasuring the beneficial impacts, and in assessing whether the project facilities are managed \nefficiently and the benefits reach the targeted groups.   \n \n13.  Project Review \n \n81.   ADB, with the Government and DWASA, will jointly review project progress at least twice \na year. In addition to regular reviews, ADB will undertake a midterm review within 36 months of \nloan  effectiveness.  These  reviews  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  project  scope, \nimplementation arrangements, and achievement of scheduled targets. Further, they will assess ", " 23\nprogress on project implementation activities, institutional development, and performance of \nconsultants and DWASA.  \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n82.   A TA grant will be provided for advisory assistance to the Government in improving and \nstrengthening the management and operation of urban water supply and sanitation services. \nThis will include assistance to LGD and DWASA in preparing and implementing key policy \nreforms. The TA also will assist DWASA in conducting the necessary technical preparation for, \nintroducing optimization measures in the existing water supply sources; and in supporting the \nsmooth  start-up  of  project  implementation  (Appendix  12  and  details  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix M).   \n \n83.  Financing  Plan. The total amount of the TA is estimated at $3,125,000. ADB will \nfinance $2,500,000 on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance funding program. The \nGovernment  will  provide  the  remaining  financing,  equivalent  to  $625,000,  in  terms  of \ncounterpart staff and other support facilities. \n \n84.   Objectives and Purpose. The objective of the TA is to assist the Government (LGD) \nand DWASA in meeting the policy reforms being proposed under the Program, optimizing the \nexisting water supply sources, and ensuring smooth start of project implementation. The TA \noutcomes will include (i) increased autonomy of, and strengthened governance of DWASA, (ii) \ndevelopment of a strategic plan for effective demand-side management, (iii) improved financial \nmanagement  capacity  of  DWASA,  (iv)  detailed  analyses  of  and  recommendations  on \norganizational and tariff reforms required by the Program, (v) pilot program to assess the merits \nof trench-less technology in rehabilitation works versus open-trench technology, (vi) preparation \nof the performance-based management contract and the request for proposals for one of the \nproject  zones  as  outlined  under  subcomponent  B1  of  the  Project,  (vii)  introduction  of \noptimization  measures  in  the  existing  water  supply  sources,  (viii)  studies  to  establish  the \nindependent regulatory entity for the urban water sector, and (ix) a feasibility study of the long-\nterm water supply source augmentation option for Dhaka city from surrounding river(s).  \n \n85.   Implementation Arrangements. For the TA, the EA will be LGD and the IA will be \nDWASA, but the team will be based at the DWASA office. DWASA will provide an executive \nengineer  or  above  as  the  TA  coordinator  and  three  counterpart  staff  to  work  with  the \nconsultants. ADB will engage a qualified consulting firm and individual consultants (for a total of \n131 person-months) to implement the TA. Additional individual consultants may be recruited as \nnecessary to strengthen the process. The TA will be undertaken intermittently over 3 years, \nfrom January 2008 to January 2011. Some of the outputs (including studies, recommendations, \ndraft rules and regulations, draft business plans, and draft operations manual) are expected to \nsupport LGD, DWASA, and other key stakeholders in fulfilling the policy actions under the \nprogram and project loans. To facilitate implementation, the TA will use an advance payment \nfacility  for  equipment;  training,  seminars,  and  workshops;  surveys;  and  miscellaneous \nadministration and support costs.  \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Poverty Reduction and Social Development \n86.  The project loan is expected to improve the management and operation of DWASA and \nincrease its capacity to serve the population of Dhaka. The socioeconomic survey undertaken \n ", " 24   \nduring project preparation shows that slum households generally are not supplied directly with \nDWASA water. According to the survey, in slum areas (similar to other un-served areas), water \nis supplied through hand tube wells (HTW) (30%), small-scale operators (20%), long-coil pipes \n(20%), and vendors (13%). More than 55% of households in the slum areas reported spending \nTk306, or 6% of their monthly income, on average to treat diarrhea. The Project will bring water \nto several poor neighborhoods at the connection point. Beyond the connection point, other \ndevelopment  partners  (including  DFID)  and  local  NGOs  will  implement  their  programs  to \nconnect the poor to the water supply. Through these, poor households in DWASA\u2019s coverage \narea will be provided with a constant and pressurized supply of higher-water quality. Poverty \nimpact analysis shows that the Project will significantly reduce water costs, water collection time \nfor women, and morbidity and associated health care costs. It also will improve public health \nwhere the poor live. This will increase time in productive and income-generating activities. \nProject construction and operation will generate employment opportunities for local people. The \nProject will ensure that (i) children are not employed, (ii) appropriate facilities for workers and \ntheir families are provided at construction campsites, and (iii) men and women are paid the \nsame amount for work of equal value. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in \nAppendix 13. The Project is also expected to benefit women through, for example, reduced \nburden in water collection, better health, and jobs.40  \n \nB.  Social and Environment Safeguards \n87.  Social  Safeguards.  The  Project  is  designed  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement by (i) continuing the practice in Dhaka of burying new water pipes in roads and \navoid the need to acquire land, (ii) using trench-less technology where possible in relining pipes \nand installing new pipes to limit the excavation of trenches and reduce disturbance of residents \nand business, and (iii) locating new facilities (overhead reservoirs and chlorination units) on \nvacant government land wherever possible. Anticipated impacts are limited to (i) loss of income \nby  shops  and  other  businesses  if  trenches  and  excavated  soil  make  access  difficult  for \ncustomers, (ii) loss of income by hawkers if they have to move from their normal location, and \n(iii) loss of land if some private land has to be acquired for some new overhead reservoirs. \nLosses of income are expected in minor roads, because work is allowed on major roads only at \nnight when most businesses are closed to reduce traffic congestion. The overall impacts are to \nbe minimized further through careful selection of sites and alignment during detailed design \nimplementation.  To  ensure  compliance  with  the  policy  and  requirements  on  involuntary \nresettlement of the Government, EA, and ADB, a resettlement framework was prepared based \non  the  EA\u2019s  national  Acquisition  and  Requisition  of  Immovable  Property \nOrdinance(ARIPO),1992  the  resettlement  policy  framework,  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). A summary of the resettlement framework is in Appendix 14 and a \nfull version is in Supplementary Appendix D. Resettlement plans will be prepared for subzones \nbased on the framework. Resettlement plans will ensure that socioeconomic conditions, needs, \nand priorities of vulnerable groups are identified; and that land acquisition and resettlement \ndoes not disadvantage vulnerable groups. A short resettlement plan was prepared for a sample \nsubzone (Supplementary Appendix E).  \n \n88.  During  program  development  and  design,  no  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  were \nidentified. The Program will result in environmental and public health benefits to the whole \nprogram population. The likelihood the Program affecting indigenous peoples is small. Any likely \n                                                 \n40 The gender action plan, which ensures that gender issues are addressed, women benefit equally from the \nDWSSDP, and interventions avoid gender bias, is in Supplementary Appendix J.  ", " 25\nimpacts  are  addressed  by  resettlement  plans.  Further,  no  permanent  land  acquisition  is \nenvisaged.  \n \n89.  Environmental Safeguards. The Program is designed to maximize environmental and \npublic health benefits. The Initial Environmental Examination (IEE: summarized in Appendix 15 \nwith the full IEE in Supplementary Appendix F) and the environmental assessment of the policy \nmatrix (Supplementary Appendix G) conducted for the Program show that net environmental \nbenefits are positive and large. The main beneficiaries of the improved network are Dhaka City \nresidents, who will be provided with a constant and pressurized supply of higher-quality water, \nwhich serves a large proportion of the population. This will improve the quality of life and raise \nstandards of individual and public health as improvements in hygiene reduce diseases from \npoor sanitation. It also will result in social benefits from reduced time spent on water collection, \nincreased time for productive and income-generating activities, and reduce expenditures on \nhealth care due to waterborne diseases. \n \n90.  During program development, measures were included in program design to mitigate \npotential negative environmental impacts. These included (i) adopting trench-less technology to \nthe extent possible to reduce excavation and disturbances to residents and businesses, (ii) \ncontinuing the practice of burying water distribution pipelines within roads and locating new \nfacilities on vacant government-owned land to avoid land acquisition, and (iii) prohibiting the use \nof asbestos cement pipes to avoid potential health risks from inhalation of asbestos fibers. The \nremaining negative impacts relate to construction and O&M, whose potential impacts on the \nphysical environment and people will be mitigated by a range of identified measures. These \ninclude (i) reducing waste disposal by finding beneficial uses for waste soil and stone, (ii) \nreducing dust by covering soil and sand when stored on site or carried on trucks, and (iii) \nplanning  work  to  minimize  disruption  on  traffic  and  communities.  The  IEE  identified \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures to ensure that the implementation of the \nsubcomponents  comply  with  the  Government  and  ADB  environmental  guidelines  and \nrequirements in the design and implementation of the Program. \n \nC.  Economic and Financial Analysis \n \n1.  Economic Analysis  \n \n91.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the project loan and some \ncost  implications  of  the  policy  actions.  The  overall  EIRR  is  16.7%,  which  exceeds  the \nopportunity cost of capital of 12% per year. The EIRR also were subjected to a sensitivity \nanalysis of key variables. The key variables tested were (i) a 20% increase in capital costs, (ii) \n20% underachievement in water quality improvement, (iii) 20% underachievement in water \npressure increase. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the EIRR for the project loan is robust \nunder most conditions. The detailed economic evaluation and sensitivity analysis are available \n(Supplementary Appendix H). \n \n  2.  Financial Management \n \n92.   Using  financial  management  assessment  questionnaires,  interviews  and  financial \nmanagement assessments were undertaken during the project preparatory TA to evaluate the \nEA\u2019s ability to undertake and fulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements for the project components. The \nEA\u2019s financial management needs to be strengthened, and will be acceptable with support from \ncorporate financial planning and management consultants. Project implementation delays will \n ", " 26   \nbe minimized through extensive support from project management and design and supervision \nconsultants, who will be familiar with ADB procedures and requirements. \n \n  3.  Financial Sustainability  \n \n93.   Financial  projections  were  prepared  for  DWASA  based  on  the  financial  action \nimprovement plan. Financial projections also assume better cash flow management, including \nimproved user charge collection efficiency to be achieved under the Project and the Program. \nFrom FY2018, DWASA is expected to fully recover its costs. \n \n94.   Financial variability of the project loan was assessed in real terms using constant 2006 \nprices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to \nreal terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency \nfluctuations. Incremental costs and benefits were derived by evaluating the financial position of \nthe EAs under with- and without-project scenarios. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR), \ncomputed on an after-tax basis, was 3.99%. This compares favorably with the weighted average \ncost of capital, also computed on an after-tax basis, of 2.33% on an aggregate basis. All parts of \nthe project loan are considered financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity and risk analysis \nindicates that the FIRR is sensitive to delays in each item of the implementation of financial \nimprovement action plan. Detailed financial analysis is available (Supplementary Appendix I).  \n \nD.   Risks and Assumptions \n \n95.  Rehabilitation of the existing pipeline, the major component of the Project, carries risks. \nAlthough  DWASA  maintains  digital  maps  of  its  pipelines  and  has  general  ideas  of  where \nprevalent illegal and poor connections might be, the real extent only emerges at the time of \nexcavation. Though the Project is based on conservative assumptions, the required works and \ncosts to rehabilitate and optimize the system might exceed the original estimate.  This risk will \nbe mitigated by careful preparatory works based on lessons learned from the pilot scheme, and \nsubstantial engineering consulting support to DWASA during project implementation. \n \n96.  Despite firm commitment of the Government, resistance to the reforms program might \narise from outside and within (for example, from unions). Tariff adjustment may face opposition, \nundermining  political  support  to  the  reform.  The  reforms  program  is  underpinned  by  the \nPartnership Framework between the Government and major development partners to support \nthe Government initiative in a coherent manner. To minimize the social impact and sustain \nbroad public support) frequent dialogue with other ministries addressing wastewater and water \nresources  management,  the  tariff  adjustment  will  be  carried  out  gradually  with  careful \naffordability  study  and  communication  programs  with  involvement  of  community-based \norganizations (CBOs) and NGOs. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS  \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n97.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, LGD, and DWASA have given \nthe following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n ", " 27\n98.

Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Indicators  \n \n1.  Of the 135 million people in Bangladesh, 23.5% live in urban areas. The urban population is \ngrowing about 2.5% annually, nearly double the national growth rate of 1.3%. More than half of \nurban population is concentrated in Dhaka and three other metropolitan areas\u2014Chittagong, Khulna, \nand Rajshahi. Urban services in the towns and cities are generally deficient and the quality of \nservice is poor. Inadequate urban services, including water supply and sanitation, is a severe \nhindrance to the continued development of urban areas, as well as to the Government\u2019s efforts to \nreduce poverty and improve economic growth in the country.  \n \n2.  In most towns, groundwater is the source of the municipal piped water supply as well as the \nprivate water supply. About 5% of the country\u2019s population receives water from stand posts, 15% \nfrom public tube wells, 60% from shallow tube wells, and less than 20% from their own house \nconnection for municipal piped water supply. Of the 309 pourashavas (peri-urban town), only 102 \nhave  municipal  piped  water  supply.  Water  supply  operation  in  the  pourashavas  generally  is \ncharacterized by (i) limited service hours, (ii) average unaccounted-for water of 33\u201340%, (iii) low \nbilling and collection rates, and (iv) inadequate tariffs. Further, because of the intermittent supply of \nelectricity, pumps generally run for only 10\u201312 hours per day, and piped water supply is available to \nconsumers usually for 2\u20134 hours per day. Urban water quality is extremely poor. Arsenic and \nbacteriological contamination from water sources in various regions of the country is posing a \nserious  public  health  risk.  Rehabilitation  of  the  existing  systems  in  parallel  with  investment  in \nprovision  of  supply  infrastructure,  such  as  water  treatment  plants  and  development  of  surface \nsources, is urgently needed in most towns and cities. In most areas, depletion of groundwater \nresources is also a grave concern, as often observed by the rapid fall of water levels during the dry \nseason below what can be reached with hand pumps. \n \n3.  Urban sanitation is a major challenge since 26% of urban households still do not have \naccess to latrines or another form of hygienic sanitation. Sewerage systems are absent in all urban \nareas except Dhaka, where 20% of the population is served by an expensive sewer network. \nInadequate drainage in most of the urban centers aggravates this situation by adding to potential \ncontamination/pollution of drinking water supply. Similarly, only 20% of the households in the urban \nareas have access to a solid waste collection system.  \n \n4.  Urban water supply and sanitation (WSS) services are carried out by water supply and \nsewerage authorities (WASAs) in Dhaka and Chittagong, city corporations, and pourashava water \nsupply sections (PWSSs). The Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) implements new \nwater supply systems and carries out major rehabilitation programs except in the areas managed by \nthe WASAs. After completion of the works, DPHE hands over the WSS systems to local government \ninstitutions (LGIs) to handle operation and maintenance (O&M). In reality, the local DPHE offices \nalso assist the PWSSs with O&M if necessary and possible.  \n \n5.  The  semiautonomous  Dhaka  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Authority  (DWASA)  and \nChittagong Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (CWASA) were created under the East Pakistan \nOrdinance of 1963. DWASA is responsible for the provision, operation, and maintenance of water \nsupply, sanitation, and storm water disposal services to the population of Dhaka city, as stipulated in \nthe Water Supply and Sewerage Authority Act, 1996. In 2005, the population of Dhaka city within the \nDhaka Metropolitan Area (DMA) was estimated at 11 million, including 8.6 million within the DWASA \nservice area. DWASA provides an estimated 7.7 million people with water, which is nearly 90% of \nthe people living in the DWASA service area. The remaining 10% are served mostly by private wells \nabstracting water from the same aquifer under the city. Though the number of employees in DWASA ", "                                           Appendix 2        35 \nis high (17 per 1,000 connections), each connection serves approximately 4\u20135 households, or more \nthan 30 people on average.  \n \n6.  Population of Dhaka city is growing extremely rapidly. Based on a detailed analysis of \navailable census data and current land use patterns, the population living within the DWASA service \narea is projected to increase to 21.63 million1 by 2025, while an additional 4.4 million will be living \noutside the DWASA service area but within the DMA. A sizeable percentage of people in the \nDWASA service area live in slums (estimates vary from 15% to 60%). A survey carried out during \nthe  program  preparation  showed  that  the  majority  of  the  people  living  in  slums  are  indirectly \nreceiving water from DWASA. However, most of vulnerable slum dwellers still do not benefit from \nDWASA  services  due  to  statutory  restrictions.  However,  the  Government  recently  approved  a \nguideline for Dhaka Water Supply (April 2006)2 that states DWASA is allowed to extend basic WSS \nservices to slums within its service areas, providing legal connection and introducing formal billing \nand collections. \n \n7.  Groundwater accounts for 82% of water supplied by DWASA. The water is obtained mainly \nfrom production tube wells drilled to a depth less than 200 meters below ground. The remaining 18% \nof DWASA\u2019s water is supplied from surface sources after being treated at Saidabad water treatment \nplant (WTP), which is producing 225 mld (million liter per day) of water.3 Extensive investigations \nhave  found  that,  although  arsenic  contamination  of  groundwater  is  widespread  in  the  country, \narsenic levels in the groundwater of Dhaka are low and within permissible limits. Groundwater \navailability is influenced by seasonal variations resulting from recharge in the upstream catchments. \nEffectively, all wells in Dhaka have shown a steady decline in the water table, with some at 65\u201370 \nmeters below surface level. The lower groundwater tables already are causing well failures. \n \n8.  While the projected future demand of areas covered by DWASA varies between 2,450 mld \nand 3,100 mld4 in 2025, DWASA\u2019s current production level is 1,570 mld. DWASA has carried out \nvarious  studies  and  detailed  modeling  over  the  years,  which  clearly  indicate  that  little  further \nabstraction from the groundwater resources is sustainable.5 Therefore, Dhaka is expected to face a \nsevere supply shortage by 2015 unless it implements a sustainable supply augmentation plan. \n \n9.  The distribution system, consisting of approximately 2500 kilometer (km) of primary \nand  secondary  pipes,  has  been  developed  on  a  piecemeal  basis  over  the  past  two  decades. \nCurrently, distribution system losses are estimated at about 40% based on the project preparatory \nTA  consultants  report.6  To  save  the  highly  valued  resources,  supply  higher-quality  water,  and \nprepare for any future injection of additional water, the system needs rehabilitation to minimize \nlosses.  \n \nB.  Institutional, Governance, and Financial Constraints for the Sector \n \n10.  Inadequate Decentralization and Local Governance. In practice, local governments have \nnot been strengthened adequately for them to respond sufficiently to local urban services needs. \nThis is largely the result of the concentration of urban administrative authority in the office of the \npourashava chairperson. Further delegation of power from the pourashava chairpersons to the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Preparing the Dhaka Water Supply Project. TA \n4651 PPTA Final Report. Manila. \n2  DWASA. 2006, Guidelines for Water Supply in Dhaka City. Dhaka (official circular, 18 April). \n3  The WTP was constructed under the World Bank-funded Fourth Dhaka Water Supply Project.  \n4  See Supplementary Appendix A: Sector Road Map for details. \n5  Based on the steady decline in water table at most wells, more than 40% of the production tube wells are expected to be \nout of service within the next decade.  \n6  The actual losses from the system is a subject of is much debate. The pilot project in Manikdi found more than 60% of \nthe water supplied is lost for a variety of reasons. \n ", "3 6  Appendix 2 \nelected commissioners and the citizen groups will be required to foster greater accountability of \nelected  officials  to  local  residents.  Most  of  the  government  institutions  involved  in  urban \ndevelopment and service provision at the national and local levels desperately need adequate \nresources, facilities, and operational capacities to undertake satisfactory planning, coordination, \nimplementation,  enforcement,  regulation,  and  monitoring  tasks  and  responsibilities.  Capacity \nbuilding and training of staff, as well as increasing the manpower, in pourashavas is required to \ncomplement  capital  investments  in  urban  development  to  ensure  sustainability  and  maximize \neconomic  benefits,  especially  in the  implementation  of  urban  development  programs  for  urban \ncenters.  \n \n11.  Institutional and Financing Weaknesses. The pourashavas suffer from a range of staff, \ntraining,  equipment,  and  organizational  constraints,  as  well  as  weak  capacity  of  elected \ncommissioners,  local  public  officials,  and  community  groups.  These  factors  undermine  the \nmanagement  of  municipal  affairs.  Improvements  are  required  to  enhance  the  awareness  and \nparticipation of local stakeholders in urban planning and management (e.g., citizen awareness and \nparticipation,  women\u2019s  participation,  and  integration  of  the  urban  poor),  and  then  to  improve \naccountability  and  transparency  (financial  accountability  and  sustainability,  and  administrative \ntransparency) in the management of local governments. Insufficient finance is a key reason for \ninadequate infrastructure and services. As long as municipalities remain heavily dependent on the  \nGovernment for much of their revenues, they will not have an adequate incentive to assume greater \nfinancial responsibility. In addition to augmenting local government authority to mobilize revenues, \nimproving the financial management practices at the pourashava and city corporation levels must be \nprioritized. Property tax is the most important source of local revenue, but the collection efficiency is \nvery  low.  Government  agencies  also  add  to  the  collection  problem  by  defaulting  on  their  tax \npayments. On the expenditure side, there is a chronic shortage of funds for O&M of existing assets, \nas well as long-term financing to meet capital expenditure responsibilities. Financial management \nalso warrants improvement at the pourashava and city corporation level. A relatively low level of \nbudgeting and accounting skills at all levels is a major obstacle to improving employee productivity \nand expenditure effectiveness.  \n \n12.  Lack  of Regulatory  Framework. To ensure better service standards, governance, and \ninstitutional environment, a regulatory entity is urgently needed. Policy making, regulation, and \nservice delivery functions must be clearly separated with each assigned to a different entity. For \ninstance, while the central Government departments are responsible for policy development, WSS \nutilities should be given full responsibility and autonomy to provide water and sanitation services, \nand the municipalities should own the assets. Meanwhile, the water supply regulatory commission \nshould be responsible for regulating, fixing applicable service standards, setting tariffs, monitoring \nutility performance, and enforcing compliance. Such a regulatory body is also necessary to set \nstandards and foster private sector involvement, the lack of which has contributed to institutional \nweaknesses at the national and at pourashava level.  \n \n13.  Institutional,  Governance,  and  Financial  Management  Issues  in  DWASA.  DWASA \noperates within the provisions of the Water Supply and Sewerage Authority Act 1996. According to \nthe act, DWASA should be able to manage its facilities and operate with a high degree of autonomy. \nHowever, an essential provision of the act is that when Government financing is being provided to \nDWASA, or when Government is providing guarantee for finance, all information relating to the \nconcerned scheme will have to be submitted to the Government for approval. Thus, the autonomy of \nDWASA in practice is constrained by its financial dependence on the Government. Consequently, \ndecisions on almost all day-to-day management issues, such as human resource development, staff \nhiring and firing, setting of tariffs, staff salaries, have to be sent to the Government for approval. In \naddition, there are many pending issues with the Government, such as the approval of the rules and \nregulations and the organogram (organization chart), under the 1996 Act, which hinder DWASA\u2019s ", "                                           Appendix 2        37 \ninstitutional,  operational,  and  managerial  efficiency  and  autonomy.  Furthermore,  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities of the management and the board are not clearly delineated. \n \n14.  The organizational performance of the administrative and financial departments, including \nrecording of consumption and billing is weak and lacks computerized systems for transparent and \naccurate  data  processing.  Moreover,  the  current  O&M  practices,  particularly  allowing  unskilled \npersons  (private  household  owners  and  their  plumbers)  to  access  the  network,  cause  serious \ndamage to the system and increase system losses. \n \n15.  Human  resource  management  within  DWASA  suffers  from  (i)  lack  of  an  effective \nperformance-based human resource development plan whereby active steps are taken to enhance \nthe overall performance of the authority; (ii) lack of continuity in management positions due to \nfrequent changes and absences of the managing director and deputy managing directors; (iii) a lack \nof incentive schemes to attract more qualified staff to key positions; (iv) recruitment that is not based \non functional requirements; (v) political and bureaucratic interference in the recruitment process; (vi) \nvacancies in key positions; and (vii) top-down management structure, stifling initiative and personal \ndevelopment.   \n \n16.  Management  of  DWASA  is  also  constrained  by  the  unusual  roles  of  labor  unions  and \nemployees\u2019 cooperative societies. Billing and revenue collection functions in three of the six water \nsupply zones of Dhaka, comprising approximately half the population and service connections of \nDWASA  service  area,  have  been  outsourced  to  DWASA  Employees  Consumer  Supplies  Co-\noperative  Society  through  a  program  for  performance  improvement  (PPI)  agreement.  The  PPI \nagreements are performance based, and the employers working under the PPI agreements also \nbenefit from bonus arrangements. The billing efficiency of the PPI zones are generally higher than \nthe DWASA zones. However, splitting responsibilities between DWASA staff and PPI staff is unclear \nand unpractical in many areas. For instance, DWASA is responsible for controlling of unaccounted-\nfor-water UFW, while the PPI identifies and disconnects illegal connections. DWASA handles meter \nmaintenance, while the PPI does the meter reading. Frequently, functioning meters are lacking at \nthe service connection, and inadequate records and mapping leave the revenue inspectors as the \nonly people who can identify the right bill to the right connection. As a result, billing is up to the \nrevenue inspector, or what agreements the revenue inspector makes with the beneficiaries. Such \nexperiences have shown that the PPI arrangement is creating vested interests within DWASA and  \nconflict of interests that should be changed. Further, no efficient mechanisms are in use to make \ndefaulters pay their bills. According to an ADB PPTA study (footnote 1), 60% of the water produced \nis billed, but only 62% of the bills are paid. Thus, only 37% of the water produced is paid for. \nHowever, according to DWASA\u2019s monitoring and information system (MIS) report of June 2007, the \ncumulative collection rate for the six zones is 97.28%. However, this figure is based against the \n\u201cbilling\u201d target, not necessarily counting all households tapping water from DWASA. The DWASA \nMIS figure needs further examination, as some zones are achieving higher than 100% collection.  \n \n17.  DWASA\u2019s organizational structure was modified during the World Bank-supported Fourth \nDhaka Water Supply Project. 7 While DWASA\u2019s board comprised members from the civil society, the \ntop management was redesigned to comprise an independently recruited managing director and \nthree deputy managing directors. However, the organization is still top heavy, where little is done \nwithout approval of the top management, the managing director, and even to the board and ministry. \nThere are no incentives for the staff to take full responsibility of their work and perform better. \nAlthough  the  number  of  employees  is  high  in  DWASA  (about  3,500  staff,  or  17  per  1,000 \nconnections), each connection serves approximately 4\u20135 households, or more than 30 people on \naverage.  Apart  from  the  head  office,  where  the  entire  management,  chief  engineer,  and  all \nsuperintending  engineers  are  located,  six  zone  offices  have  been  established  for  operational \n                                                 \n7 World Bank. 1996.

Each zone office\u2014or management, operation, and development system (MODS)\u2014is \njointly headed by an executive engineer on the technical side and a revenue officer on the financial \nside. The joint and unclear management, and the three management levels between the executive \nengineer and the managing director, makes the MODS weak and inefficient. \n \nC.  Overview of Government\u2019s Sector Strategies and Policies  \n \n18.  Eight national policies and strategies govern the WSS sector. The National Policy for Safe \nWater Supply & Sanitation (1998) is the most significant policy for the sector. It emphasizes user \nparticipation,  decentralization  to  the  LGIs  and  community-based  organizations  (CBOs),  and \ninvolvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  the  private  sector  in  WSS  service \ndelivery. Subsequently, the Sector Development Framework (2004), National Sanitation Strategy \n(2005), and Pro-Poor Strategy (2005) were formulated to further define and complement the 1998 \nWSS policy. The National Policy of Arsenic Mitigation (2004) was formulated specifically to address \nthe widespread arsenic contamination of groundwater. On the other hand, the National Water Policy \n(1998) and the National Water Management Plan (2004) give broad direction for water resources \nmanagement.  \n \n19.  Recently, the Government has included improvement of WSS as part of its seven-point \nstrategic  agenda  for  reducing  poverty  in  its  poverty  reduction  strategy  2005.8  The  strategy \nrecognizes the importance of water and sanitation as a means of achieving accelerated poverty \nreduction in the country. Poverty and rapid population growth, combined with having to rely on open \nponds for drinking water and poor sanitary habits, contributed to a high level of water-related \nmorbidity and mortality in the 1960s and 1970s in Bangladesh. Introduction of safe drinking water \nthrough tube wells, higher sanitation coverage, and improved primary health care contributed to \nhalving of the mortality rate\u2014caused by diarrheal diseases\u2014from 300,000 deaths per year in 1980 \nto 150,000 in 1997. The 2005 strategy aims to reduce poverty by 30%, extreme poverty by 5%, and \nchild mortality to 31 per 1,000 live births by 2015. Water-related diseases continue to account for the \nmajority of deaths of infants and children under 5 years old in the country. Further, the Government \nhas committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, including reducing by half the \nproportion of people without sustainable access to safe water supply and sanitation, by 2015. \n \n20.  The Government\u2019s goals, and the priority accorded the provision of safe drinking water and \nappropriate  sanitation,  are  consolidated  in  its  new  Sector  Development  Program\u2014Water  and \nSanitation Sector in Bangladesh (SDP-WSSB), which was approved in January 2006.9 The SDP for \nthe WSS sector assembled all the relevant national and international policies, strategies, and targets \nand drew up a 10-year framework for development and cooperation in the sector. The preparation of \nthe SDP-WSSB is a result of a sequential development of WSS policies and strategies over a long \nperiod. The most important ones are (i) National Policy for Safe Water Supply & Sanitation 1998; (ii) \nsector development framework, 2004; (iii) Pro-Poor Strategy, 2005; and (iv) National Policy for \nArsenic Mitigation, 2004.  \n  \n21.  The sector development framework has suggested optimistic targets and time scale for \nimplementation of the WSS sector improvements. It aims for 100% coverage of basic water supply \nand sanitation services in towns and rural areas during 2005\u20132015. The coverage target for piped \nwater  supply  in  the  urban  areas  is  70%  by  2010  and  90%  by  2015.  While  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals set the target of halving the percentage of people without safe water and basic \nsanitation by 2015, the Government has set a more ambitious target, in the case of sanitation, of \n100% coverage by 2010.  \n                                                 \n8 Government of Bangladesh. 2005.

Recruitment Procedures \n1.  Management contractors will be recruited in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, and as amended from time to time) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The \nmanagement contractor will be a company or consortium of companies that will be responsible for \nproviding advisory services in managing the operations of one of the project zones. The management \ncontractor will have to bear much more risk than a typical consultant, because the contractor\u2019s total \nremuneration will depend on its success in improving the delivery of services provided by DWASA. \nBecause of the limited number of private contractors with the required expertise and possible limited \ninterest due to the high costs of preparing a competitive proposal, the short list may not meet the \nrequirements of six firms as mandated by ADB\u2019s guidelines. \n2.  To come up with a short list of qualified companies and/or consortia, the criteria for short-\nlisting will include (i) a set of criteria to identify companies and/or consortia that have the necessary \npractical operating experience to be able to execute the contract successfully; and (ii) a summary of \nthe experience and skills of the companies and/or consortia, with brief responses to a list of questions \nthat focus on how they have addressed or would address problems similar to those the DWASA \nwould face in improving service provision. An evaluation committee would consider private contractors \nmeeting these criteria for short-listing based on expressions of interest received. \n  \nB.  Outline Terms of Reference \n3.  The  management  contract  will  have  two  key  features.  First,  it  will  have  a  3-year  tenure \n(typically), with remuneration consisting of a fixed fee and performance-based incentive payments. \nSecond, the contract will have a limited number of easily measurable key performance indicators, \nwhose  baseline  levels  will  be  determined  during  the  first  year  of  operations,  and  to  which \nperformance-based payments will be linked. ADB anticipates that the management contractor will \nbring in a limited number of expatriate staff, and that its management team will likely include several \nBangladesh nationals. \n4.  The management contractor will be responsible for managing the operation, as well as the \nsystems and services, for the concerned project zone. The tasks of the management contractor will \ninclude: \n \n(i)  improving the midterm performance and efficiency of services, and expanding their \ncoverage in the DWASA\u2019s service area; \n(ii)  enhancing  the  delivery  of  services  to  the  poor  through  a  targeted  program  of \nconnections and service improvements in low-income communities; \n(iii)  upgrading the operation and management of water and wastewater systems through \nvarious  means,  such  as  more  efficient  revenue  collection,  implementation  of \ncomputerized billing and accounting, introduction of management information systems, \nimproved  customer  service,  improved  occupational  safety  practices,  and  reduced \nleaks; \n(iv)  assisting and advising DWASA in relation to strategic planning, budget preparation, \nand other operational and system optimization issues; \n(v)  improving the effectiveness of the DWASA\u2019s human resources through a coordinated \ncapacity building program; and \n(vi)  resolving customer complaints and measuring customer satisfaction.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty   \n      No  partnership agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Dhaka, Bangladesh \n \nA third of the urban population in Bangladesh is classified as poor (Poverty Monitoring Survey 2004),3 and urban \nincome inequality is worsening. Based on the 2001 census, the population in the Dhaka megacity was 10.7 million, and \ncurrent estimates place the population at 13 million. Based on the World Food Program\u2019s poverty estimates, more than \n1 million in Dhaka are poor (8%). The urban poor live mainly in slum areas. Various agencies estimate the slum \npopulation differently\u2014the Bureau of Statistics places the 2005 slum population at 1.2 million and the Dhaka Transport \nCoordination Board Survey estimates population density in the slums at 250,000 per square kilometer, or six times \nmore dense than the rest of Dhaka. The socioeconomic survey conducted during preparation of the Dhaka Water \nSupply Sector Development Program (DWSSDP) shows that 70% of the slum population is poor. The survey also \nindicates that the poor live in fringe areas and pockets within Dhaka4 as well as in slum areas. Of Dhaka\u2019s population, \nabout 10 million are within the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) service area.  \n \nInadequate urban services, including water and sanitation, are a severe hindrance to the continued development of \nurban areas, as well as efforts to reduce severe poverty. In most urban areas of Bangladesh, piped water depends on \ndeep tube wells. Due to high electricity costs, pumps run only for 10\u201312 hours per day, and piped water is available to \nconsumers for only 2\u20134 hours daily. Those not covered by piped water often depend on unreliable, unsafe, and more \nexpensive alternative sources. Waterborne diseases continue to account for the majority of deaths among infants and \nchildren under 5 years old. The Government of Bangladesh, as identified in its 2005 poverty reduction strategy paper, \nemphasizes supplying safe water and providing sanitation services to reduce health costs, decrease malnutrition, and \nincrease labor productivity. Based on the Government\u2019s 2006 Guideline for Dhaka Water Supply, DWASA is allowed to \nextend basic water supply and sanitation services to slums within its service areas, providing legal connection and \nintroducing formal billing and collection. The DWSSDP is expected to improve the management and operation of the \nmunicipal water supply service of Dhaka, and increase its capacity to serve the future population. DWSSDP will bring \npoor households under DWASA water supply coverage by providing additional supply lines to identified fringe and slum \nareas. It will provide a constant and pressurized supply of higher-water quality, of which 15% is estimated to benefit \nlow-income communities using standpipes and communal taps. Poverty impact analysis shows that the Program will \nsignificantly reduce water costs, water collection time for women, and morbidity and associated health care costs; and \nimprove public health where the poor live. This will increase time in productive and income-generating activities.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Poverty Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nA socioeconomic survey was conducted during DWSSDP preparation covering 3,017 households from the slum areas, \n945 households from pocket areas, and 1,057 households from fringe areas to supplement previous surveys, namely: \nthe Asian Development Bank\u2019s Dhaka Water Services Survey (October 2005) and Pilot Testing of Zonal Approach in \nManikdi Area of Dhaka City (November 2005). The survey was undertaken in six zones of DWASA. A poverty profile, \ngenerated from these surveys and secondary data, shows that the main causes of poverty are (i) differences in human \nresources, including literacy, knowledge, and skills; (ii) uneven distribution of physical assets, including housing \nstructures, equipment, and implements; (iii) increased vulnerability due to certain demographic characteristics, such as \nhouseholds that headed by females; and (iv) frequent movement and changes in shelter due to natural disasters, such \nas floods and man-made hazards including eviction.  \n \n                                                 \n3  2004. Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, Poverty Monitoring Survey. Dhaka. \n4  These findings are consistent with 2005. Local Government Division, Water Aid Bangladesh Survey. Dhaka. \n ", "68      Appendix 13 \nSlum households generally are not supplied directly with DWASA water. According to the socioeconomic survey, in \nslum areas (and unserved areas), water is supplied through hand tube wells, small-scale operators, long-coil pipes, and \nvendors. The survey noted that 90% of slum dwellers reported that they have used DWASA-owned water through \nillegal channels. Due to difficulties in obtaining water and inadequate sanitation, morbidity rates are high. The \nprevalence of diarrhea is widespread among children under 5 years old in poor communities compared with the \nnonpoor ones. In the slum areas, more than 55% of households reported spending Tk306, or 6% of their monthly \nincome on average, to treat diarrhea. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nConsultations were undertaken with stakeholders, including consumers and Dhaka residents, policy makers (ministers), \nlocal government departments, DWASA board members, DWASA management, DWASA staff, zone water supply \noffices, union members, DWASA enlisted contractors, academicians, media, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), \nand the private sector. Different stakeholders were consulted to ensure their involvement in DWSSDP development \nand design. Stakeholder workshops were conducted to share the findings of stakeholder interviews and solicit views \nfrom workshop participants. At the field level, focus group discussions were held with women and men to provide \ngender perspectives. Various water-related issues were identified by stakeholders through key informant interviews to \nobtain views, issues, and priorities on water supply, and to seek suggestions provided by stakeholders.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nDWSSDP development and design were conducted in a highly participatory fashion involving several stakeholders. The \nstrategy for community consultation and participation was successfully demonstrated through the Manikdi pilot project \n(Supplementary Appendix K), and will continue to be applied in the Project. Formation of community groups will be \nfacilitated by NGOs and where appropriate CBOs to mobilize communities for participation in the Project. Extensive \nworkshops, door-to-door information and awareness campaigns through various media mechanisms, and community \nmeetings will be organized to raise the awareness and educate the communities on issues, such as tariff reforms, \nminimizing wasted water, meter reading and billing systems, and the establishment of a consumer satisfaction and \ngrievance mechanism. Where appropriate, operations and maintenance responsibilities, including tariff collection, will \nbe delegated to community-based organizations.   \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize beneficial impacts on women: \n \nTo maximize DWSSDP impacts on women, a gender action plan was developed focusing on the different experiences \nof men and women regarding water. The gender differences (especially in unserved and poor areas of Dhaka) related \nto carrying and using water has been identified through quantitative and qualitative studies. The lack of access to piped \nwater  supply  affects  women  more  than  men.  In  the  pilot  area,  women  are  water  managers  who  take  major \nresponsibility in supplying water to their families. The pilot intervention showed women to be aware and keen to \ncontribute to DWSSDP (e.g., in operations and maintenance). When forming community groups, the inclusion of \nwomen will be ensured. Involving women in mobilizing communities is also part of DWSSDP design. Women will be \ninvolved in assisting the community group in identifying the vulnerable, particularly single-earner households headed by \nwomen. Mobilization and organization of women at the formulation and implementation stages will help sustain their \ninvolvement. Women also will be involved in locating the sites for construction of community and domestic water points, \nreading water meters, and other water-related issues. Monitoring and evaluation systems will support the generation of \ngender-disaggregated information to enable the tracking of DWSSDP\u2019s gender impacts. \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n \nA gender action plan that ensures that gender issues are addressed, women benefit equally from the Program, and \ninterventions avoid gender bias has been developed. NGOs will be involved in identifying vulnerable households, \nparticularly single-earner households headed by women. Special attention will be given to capacity building of DWASA \nstaff on gender sensitization, particularly when working with women in community groups, and involving them in \ncommunity water point management and monitoring activities.  \n \n ", "       Appendix 13      69 \n \nE.

The  Dhaka  Water  Supply  Sector  Development  Program  (DWSSDP)  is  needed  to \nimprove the management and operation of the municipal water supply service of Dhaka city and \nincrease  its  capacity  to  serve  the  future  population.  Infrastructure  improvements  will  be \nconducted within four zones and 20 hydraulic subzones, and will be designed in 2008 and \nconstructed in 2009\u20132013. Work will include repairing the existing network and extending the \nsupply into new areas, and rehabilitating network facilities. DWSSDP also will build the capacity \nof the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) and raise public awareness. \n \n2.  DWSSDP  development  includes  design  actions  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement by (i) continuing the practice in Dhaka of burying new water pipes in roads and \nroad rights-of-way to avoid acquiring land, (ii) using trench-less technology where possible in \nrelining  pipes  and  installing  new  pipes  to  limit  the  excavation  of  trenches  and  reduce \ndisturbance of residents and business, and (iii) locating new facilities (overhead reservoirs and \nchlorination units) on vacant government land where possible.  \n \n3.  Anticipated impacts are limited to (i) loss of income by shops and other businesses if \ntrenches and excavated soil make access difficult for customers, (ii) loss of income by hawkers \nif they have to move from there normal locations, and (iii) loss of land if some private land has to \nbe acquired for some new overhead reservoirs. Losses of income are expected only on minor \nroads, because work is allowed only on major roads at night when most businesses are closed \nto reduce traffic congestion.5 The overall impacts are to be minimized further through careful \nselection of sites and alignment during detailed design. A short resettlement plan was prepared \nfor a sample subzone (Supplementary Appendix e). \n \nB.  Resettlement Framework and Policy \n4.  This  summary  provides  highlights  of  the  resettlement  framework  in  Supplementary \nAppendix D. The framework outlines the objectives, policy principles, and procedures through \nwhich DWASA will provide affected persons with compensation and other assistance to mitigate \nimpacts.  The  framework  is  based  on  the  national  law  The  Acquisition  and  Requisition  of \nImmovable  Property  Ordinance,  1992;  the  resettlement  policy  framework  of  the  Executing \nAgency (EA); and the Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). The framework compares these documents and addresses gaps. \n \n5.  DWSSDP will be based on the following general involuntary resettlement principles: (i) \naction will be taken during development and design to avoid land acquisition, relocation, and \nother resettlement effects where possible; (ii) where these effects cannot be avoided, sufficient \ncompensation will be provided to affected persons to restore their quality of life and livelihoods \nto at least pre-project levels; (iii) the law of Bangladesh applies where relevant, but where no \napplicable law is available or there is a gap between ADB policy, the resettlement framework \nwill be followed; (iv) compensation amounts will be based on current replacement value of \nassets or the amount of income lost, as appropriate; (v) additional assistance will be provided to \n                                                 \n5  The extent of these impacts was estimated by transect walks along 18 kilometers of minor roads, which represent \n6.7% of the roads likely to be affected. Results indicate that, although impacts are relatively minor, DWSSDP can \naffect many people and premises because of the size of Dhaka. \n ", "         Appendix 14      71      \nvulnerable6 affected persons to help improve their economic and social status; (vi) the absence \nof formal title to land is not a bar to obtaining resettlement assistance; (vii) compensation and \nother assistance will be provided before the loss is incurred; (viii) damage to common property \nresources, such as mosques, schools, and hospitals, will be avoided, and temporary structures \nwill be provided to maintain access; (ix) important cultural and religious sites, and landmarks of \nhistorical or environmental value (such as buildings and large trees) will be left intact, and \nconserved and protected; and (x) the cutoff date for compensation entitlement is the date of the \ndetailed measurement survey (DMS) to identify entitled persons and record their losses\u2014\ncompensation will not be paid for any development made on affected land after this date. The \nresettlement  framework  further  details  principles  for  (i)  permanent  impacts,  (ii)  temporary \nimpacts, and (iii) institutional arrangements. The entitlement matrix for DWSSDP, based on the \nthese principles, is in Table A14.1. \n \nC.  Procedure for Resettlement Plan Preparation and Institutional Arrangements \n \n6.  The infrastructure work will be tendered in construction packages relating to 20 hydraulic \nsubzones, and contractors may be awarded work in one or more subzones. DWASA will set up \na  project  management  unit  (PMU)  to  manage  DWSSDP  centrally.  The  six  DWASA \nadministrative  (MODS)  zones,  through  project  coordination  units,  will  manage  local \nimplementation  and  engage  civil  society.  Resettlement  issues  will  be  coordinated  by  a \nresettlement specialist appointed to the PMU, who will prepare resettlement plans for each \nhydraulic subzone, following the procedures established by the resettlement framework. The \nspecialists will also coordinate allocations of compensation and other entitlements, which will be \ndistributed by personnel from a local nongovernment organization (NGO) appointed to assist the \nMODS. Most resettlement activities will be conducted by the resettlement specialists or by the \nNGO working with the MODS. Supervision and approval will be by the PMU project director \ncentrally  and  zone-level  coordination  committees,  set  up  as  independent  local  monitoring \nagencies. Further details on roles and responsibilities for resettlement plan activities are in \nTable A14.2.  \n \n7.  The PMU will appoint design and management consultants to design the infrastructure, \nmanage tendering of contractors, and supervise the construction process. The resettlement \nframework principles will be followed in preparing designs and construction contracts, meaning \naction will be taken to avoid resettlement impacts where possible. The resettlement plans also \nwill follow these policies, and resettlement impacts that do occur will addressed as in the \nentitlement matrix.  This  should  ensure  that  the  DWSSDP  does  not disadvantage  anyone, \nespecially the vulnerable, and that the quality of life of affected persons is improved where \npossible. \n \nD.  Consultation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n8.  Stakeholders  were  involved  in  preparing  the  resettlement  framework  and  sample \nresettlement plan through face-to-face interviews on site (448 participants), five workshops (131 \nparticipants)  to  discuss  the  draft  DWSSDP  (including  draft  framework),  and  a  pilot  public \nmeeting (30 participants) in one of the hydraulic areas. Disclosure was achieved by presenting \nmaterial at the meetings and distributing a summary documents in Bangla at meetings and with \nnewspapers. DWASA will employ an experienced NGO to expand this process during the \nimplementation  stage  via  media  campaigns,  public  meetings,  stakeholder  workshops,  and \n                                                 \n6  Vulnerable groups are those without legal title to land or other assets, households headed by single-earner \nfemales, the elderly or disabled, indigenous peoples, and households with incomes below the poverty line. \n ", "72        Appendix 14 \ndiscussions with affected persons on resettlement impacts and entitlements.

This \ninvolves resolution of complaints, if possible by discussion between the PMU, affected person, \nzone-level coordination committee plus construction contractor, if necessary. If a case cannot \nbe resolved, it is presented to a grievance resolution committee, chaired by the PMU project \ndirector, with two other members, one a respected local figure and the other from a local NGO \nor community-based organization (CBO). The grievance resolution committee meets as often \nas necessary and has 14 days to reach a decision, after which an affected person may present \nhis case again once on appeal.  \n \nE.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n10.  The DWASA environment cell will conduct internal monitoring of resettlement following \nnormal practice established in the DWASA resettlement plan framework (RPF). The Program \nwill provide the environment cell with training and the support of the PMU resettlement specialist \nto enable them to fulfill this role. Aspects monitored will include: management, budget and \nprogram; delivery of affected person entitlements; consultation and grievance; and benefits and \nimpacts. Consultant or an NGO also will be engaged as an independent monitoring agency to \nreport to the EA and ADB throughout the DWSSDP on provision of entitlements and their \neffects, as well as the adequacy of resettlement policies, staff, structures, and the overall \nprocess. This will include compliance monitoring and social impact evaluations. \n \nF.  Resettlement Budget \n \n11.  The PMU will prepare detailed budget estimates for involuntary resettlement for each \nresettlement plan. It will be included in the overall subzone cost estimate.

Introduction and Description of the Program \n1.  The  Dhaka  Water  Supply  Sector  Development  Program  (DWSSDP)  is  needed  to \nimprove the management and operation of the municipal water supply service of Dhaka City \nand increase its capacity to serve the future population. Infrastructure improvements will be \nconducted within four zone and 20 hydraulic subzones, and will be designed in 2008 and \nconstructed in 2009\u20132013. Work will include repair of the existing network and extending the \nsupply into new areas, and rehabilitation of network facilities. DWSSDP also will build the \ncapacity  of  the  Dhaka  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Authority  (DWASA)  and  raise  public \nawareness. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared to assess the impacts of \nproject loan activities (Supplementary Appendix F). The impacts of program loan activities were \nreviewed through an assessment of the policy matrix (Supplementary Appendix G). The IEE \nwas based on field surveys, secondary information, and discussions with stakeholders. The \nsalient points from the IEEs are summarized in the following. \n \nB.  Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n2.  DWSSDP is designed to maximize environmental and public health benefits. The IEE \nconducted for DWSSDP shows that net environmental benefits are positive and large. The main \nbeneficiaries of the improved network are Dhaka city residents, who will be provided with a \nconstant and pressurized supply of higher-water quality, which serves a large proportion of the \npopulation. This will improve quality of life and raise standards of individual and public health, as \nimprovements in hygiene reduce diseases from poor sanitation. It also will result in social \nbenefits from reduced time spent on water collection, increased time for productive and income-\ngenerating activities, and reduced expenditures on health care due to waterborne diseases.  \n \n3.  During program development, measures were included in program design to mitigate \npotential negative environmental impacts. These included (i) adopting trench-less technology to \nthe extent possible to reduce excavation and disturbance of residents and businesses; (ii) \ncontinuing the practice of burying water distribution pipelines within roads and locating new \nfacilities on vacant government-owned land to avoid land acquisition; and (iii) prohibiting the use \nof asbestos cement pipes to avoid potential health risks from inhalation of asbestos fibers. The \nremaining negative impacts relate to construction, and operations and maintenance whose \npotential impacts on the physical environment and people will be mitigated by a range of \nidentified measures. These include (i) reducing waste disposal by finding beneficial uses for \nwaste soil and stone, (ii) reducing dust by covering soil and sand when stored on site or carried \non trucks, and (iii) planning work to minimize disruption on traffic and communities. Potential \nnegative impacts and mitigation measures are summarized in Table A15. \n \nTable A15: Potential Adverse Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \nPotential Negative Impact  Mitigation Activities and Method \nConstruction: Network Improvements   \nExcavation of pipeline trenches will produce  Find beneficial uses for waste soil in construction, land raising and \nlarge amounts of waste soil and stone  infilling of excavated areas \nDeliver suitable material to sites agreed by DWASA/DCC  \nWaste  soil  (and  sand  for  trench  infilling)  Remove waste soil for disposal as soon as it is excavated \ncould create dust  Plan work to only bring sand to site when needed \nCover or spray soil to reduce dust in windy weather \nCover soil and sand with tarpaulins when carried on trucks \nRoadside  trees  may  be  damaged  or  Only remove trees if it cannot be avoided \nremoved  Plant and maintain two trees for every one removed \nShops  and  other  businesses  may  lose  Leave spaces for access between mounds of soil \n ", "76  Appendix 15 \nPotential Negative Impact  Mitigation Activities and Method \nincome if customers\u2019 access is impeded by  Provide walkways and metal sheets to maintain access across \ntrenches, soil, etc.  trenches for people and vehicles where required \nIncrease workforce in these areas to finish work quickly \nConsult businesspeople: inform them of work in advance \nCompensate businesses for lost incomea \nExcavation  could  damage  existing  Check location of infrastructure and avoid these sites \ninfrastructure \nTraffic will be disrupted by trenches, soil,  Plan work with DCC and Dhaka Police to avoid disruption \nvehicles and machinery, and some roads  If work requires road closure, conduct when traffic is light \nmay need to be closed \nEnsure police provide road diversions when needed \nEnsure warning signs are used and traffic is policed if any work is \nconducted in roads when used by traffic \nTraffic,  people  and  activities  could  be  Plan routes to avoid narrow streets and congested roads \ndisrupted by trucks carrying waste soil or  Plan waste transportation to avoid peak traffic periods \ndelivering sand or other materials \nResidents  may  experience  noise,  dust,  As above: remove waste quickly, cover/spray stockpiles, import \nimpeded  access;  and  sleep  may  be  sand only when needed, cover soil/sand on trucks \ndisturbed by work conducted at night  As above: increase workforce to finish work quickly \nAs above: use bridges to allow access (people/vehicles)  \nUse modern vehicles/machinery and maintain as specified \nUse directional, shaded, down-facing lighting at night \nSocially and culturally important buildings  As above: remove waste quickly, cover/spray stockpiles, import \nand their users may be disturbed by noise,  sand only when needed, cover soil/sand on trucks \ndust and impeded access  As above: increase workforce to finish work quickly \nAs above: use bridges to allow access (people/vehicles)  \nAs above: use and maintain modern vehicles/machinery \nConsult relevant authorities, custodians of buildings, local people \nto address issues and avoid work at sensitive times \nPeople  will  be  inconvenienced  and  their  Plan work carefully to keep shutdown to minimum \nhealth may be at risk if water supply system  Provide alternative potable water to affected residents \nis shut down for long periods \nInform communities of any shutdown well in advance \nWorkers  and  the  public  are  at  risk  from  Prepare and implement a site Health and Safety Plan that includes \naccidents on site  measures to: \n- Exclude the public from all construction sites \n- Ensure that workers use personal protective equipment \n- Provide Health and Safety Training for all personnel \n- Follow documented procedures for all site activities  \n- Keep accident reports and records \nThere are approximately 20 km of AC pipes  Ensure that designs involve no removal or disturbance of AC pipes \nin  the  existing  water  supply  system;  Develop and apply protocol to protect workers and public if AC \nasbestos can be carcinogenic if inhaled as  pipes are encountered.

Initial Environmental Examination. Dhaka. \n Full Initial Environmental Examination (Supplementary Appendix F) \nC.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n4.  As  the  Executing  Agency  (EA),  DWASA  is  responsible  for  the  management  and \ntechnical supervision of DWSSDP, and will carry out mitigation assigned to them as part of their \nmanagement  function.  DWASA  is  also  the  Implementing  Agency  (IA)  responsible  for \nsupervising infrastructure construction and conducting the non-infrastructure elements, and will \nestablish a project management unit (PMU) for this purpose. The PMU will be supported by \ndesign and management consultants, who will design the infrastructure, manage tendering of \ncontractors, and supervise construction. Their contract will require the consultants to include \nmitigation  measures  in  designs  where  appropriate,  and  to  specify  other  measures  in \nconstruction contracts.  \n \n5.  The four DWASA administrative (MODS) zones, through project coordination units, will \ncoordinate activities at the local level and engage civil society. The EA will appoint construction \ncontractors  to  build  the  infrastructure  in  one  or  more  of  the  20  hydraulic  areas.  Each \nconstruction contractors will be supervised by the Design and Managing Consultants. When the \ninfrastructure  is  completed,  operation  will  remain  the  responsibility  of  DWASA,  which  will \nemploy local operations and maintenance contractors to conduct maintenance and repairs as \nrequired. \n \n6.  An interministerial project steering committee will provide DWASA with central policy \nguidance and coordination. Zone-level coordination committees will monitor implementation at \nthe local level and will report to the project steering committee. \n \n7.  Environmental issues will be coordinated by an environment specialist in the PMU, who \nwill prepare environmental assessment documents (Initial environmental examination [IEEs] or \nenvironmental impact assessment [EIAs]) consistent with the environmental assessment and \n ", "78  Appendix 15 \nreview framework for work in each hydraulic zone, as required by Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) policy, and will assist DWASA in obtaining environmental clearance for the program, as \nrequired  by  national  law.  An  environmental  monitoring  specialist  will  implement  the \nenvironmental  monitoring  plan.  This  will  involve  observations  and  surveys  throughout \nconstruction to ensure that mitigation measures are provided, and to protect the environment as \nintended.  The  PMU  also  will  appoint  consultants  to  monitor  the  long-term  impacts  of  the \ninfrastructure, which involves data collection during construction (to show existing conditions) \nand in each of the first 5 years of operation.  \n \nD.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n \n8.  Stakeholders1 were involved in developing the IEE through (i) face-to-face interviews on \nsite (448 participants) in July\u2013August 2006, (ii) five workshops (131 participants) on the draft \nfinal report in October 2006, and (iii) a pilot public meeting (30 participants) in one of the \nhydraulic areas in April 2007. Information also was disclosed to the wider public by circulating a \nBangla language pamphlet with newspapers. Views expressed were incorporated into the IEE, \nas well as the planning and development DWSSDP. The IEE will be made available at public \nlocations in Dhaka and will be disclosed to a wider audience through the ADB and DWASA \nwebsites. Consultation will be continued and expanded during DWSSDP implementation, when \nDWASA will appoint a nationally recognized nongovernment organization to handle this key \nelement to ensure that stakeholders participate fully in DWSSDP execution. \n \nE.  Findings, Recommendations, and Conclusion \n9.  The  IEE  recommends  the  implementation  of  (i)  all  mitigation,  compensation,  and \nenhancements  proposed  in  the  IEE  and  resettlement  planning  documents;  and  (ii)  the \nenvironmental monitoring plan described in the IEE and the monitoring proposed in resettlement \nplanning documents. The IEE shows that if recommendations outlined in the appendix are \nimplemented  in  full,  the  location,  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  DWSSDP  will  not \nproduce any significant negative environmental impacts.  \n \n10.  During the detailed design stage, IEEs will be required to identify and mitigate the \nimpacts of work in each hydraulic subzone, and an environmental impact assessment will be \nrequired to comply with national law. The environment specialist in the PMU will prepare these, \nand the cost has been included in budgets for environmental management measures. The \nanalysis described in the IEE does not contain any uncertainties, and no additional work is \nrequired at this stage of DWSSDP development.  \n                                                 \n1 Primary  stakeholders  include:  residents,  shopkeepers,  and  businesspeople  who  live  and  work  near  the \nconstruction sites; custodians and users of socially and culturally important buildings in these areas; and owners of \nany land that might be acquired to provide sites for new overhead reservoirs. Secondary stakeholders are: \nDWASA; other relevant government institutions; NGOs and community-based organizations working in affected \ncommunities;  other  community  representatives  (prominent  citizens,  religious  leaders,  women\u2019s  groups);  the \nbeneficiary community in general; and ADB. \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20071213161556+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "dhaka water supply sector development program, bangladesh proposed technical assistance grant, dwasa governance strengthening, rrp: ban 39405", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20071214141832+08'00'", "Title": "Proposed Loans and Technical Assistance Grant: Dhaka Water Supply Sector Development Program"}, "author_page": " \n  PPME  \u2013  project performance monitoring and evaluation \n  PRS  \u2013  poverty reduction strategy  \n  PSC  \u2013  project steering committee \n  PTW  \u2013  production tube well \n  PWSS  \u2013  pourashava water supply section \n  QCBS    quality and cost-based selection \n  SDP-WSSB  \u2013  Sector Development Programme\u2014Water and Sanitation  \nSector in Bangladesh (2006) \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  WACC  \u2013  weighted average cost of capital  \n  WASA  \u2013  water supply and sewerage authority \n  WSS  \u2013  water supply and sanitation \n  WTP  \u2013  water treatment plant \n \nGLOSSARY \n \n  mistries  \u2013  plumbers \n  pourashava  \u2013  peri-urban town \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year of the Government and its agencies ends on 30 June.
