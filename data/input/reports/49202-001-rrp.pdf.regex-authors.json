THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Nepal for the Disaster Risk Reduction and Livelihood Restoration for Earthquake-Affected \nCommunities Project to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR).1 \n \n2.  The project will support accelerated reconstruction following the devastating earthquake \non 25 April 2015. The project will focus on reconstructing disaster-resilient schools, building \ncommunity  capacity  to  cope  with  future  disasters,  and  providing  microcredit  to  recover \nproductive capacities. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  On  25  April  2015,  a  7.8  magnitude  earthquake  struck  Nepal,  causing  widespread \ndestruction and loss of life. The initial earthquake was followed by aftershocks and another \npowerful quake on 12 May 2015. The earthquake affected 31 out of 75 districts in Nepal. Among \nthe affected districts, 14 in the central and western regions with a total population of 5.4 million \nwere most severely affected. 2 \n \n4.  Disaster  needs  assessment  and  response.  The  Government  of  Nepal  and \ninternational  and  bilateral  donor  agencies  responded  quickly  and  jointly  undertook  a  Post \nDisaster  Needs  Assessment  (PDNA).3 The  overall  damages  in  all  of  the  affected  districts \ninclude  8,790  deaths  and  over  22,300  injured  (footnote  3).   Nearly  500,000  houses  were \ndestroyed and 250,000 damaged (footnote 3). The total value of disaster effects, including direct \ndamages and indirect losses, is estimated at NRs706 billion. Of that amount, NRs517 billion \n(73% of the total effects) represents the value of destroyed physical assets, and NRs189 billion \n(27% of the total effects) reflects the losses and higher costs of production of goods and \nservices arising from the disaster. \n \n5.  The  affected  districts,  except  for  the  Kathmandu  Valley,  are  essentially  rural  and \nagriculture-based areas where the pre-earthquake vulnerability level was already high. The 14 \nseverely affected districts account for about 13.6% of the total number of people living below the \npoverty line across Nepal. The earthquake particularly affected rural livelihoods by damaging \nlivestock, crops, and agro-based cottage industries. Due to the income shock caused by the \nearthquake, it is estimated that an additional 2.5% of Nepal\u2019s total population of 27 million as of \n2013, or at least 700,000 people, will be pushed into poverty in FY2015. The affected rural \ndistricts account for 20% of the country\u2019s total road networks and 23% of total schools, and the \nearthquake  caused  severe  disruptions  to  rural  households\u2019  access  to  essential  physical \ninfrastructure and social services. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The 14 most severely affected districts are Bhaktapur, Dhading, Dolakha, Gorkha, Kabhrepalanchok (Kavre), \nKathmandu, Lalitpur, Makwanpur, Nuwakot, Okhaldunga, Ramenchhap, Rasuwa, Sindhuli, and Sindhupalchowk.  \nGovernment of Nepal. Central Bureau of Statistics. National Population and Housing Census 2011. Kathmandu. \n3  On 22 May 2015, the government launched the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA), covering 23 sectors and \nthemes.  Supported  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  European  Union,  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency (JICA), the United Nations (UN), and the World Bank, it aimed to assess the impact of the \nearthquake and define a recovery strategy. A PDNA report was presented at the International Conference on \nNepal\u2019s Reconstruction on 25 June 2015 (Government of Nepal. National Planning Commission. 2015. Nepal \nEarthquake 2015 Post Disaster Needs Assessment. Kathmandu). ", "2 \n6.  Education sector damage and needs. Over 8,000 public schools were affected, with \n25,134 classrooms fully destroyed and another 22,097 partially damaged. In private schools, \n956 classrooms were fully destroyed and 3,983 classrooms were partially damaged. More than \n80% of the damages have been concentrated in the 14 severely affected districts. Public \nschools accounted for 92% of the education sector\u2019s estimated total damages and losses of \nNRs31.3  billion.  Of this,  the  damage  to  infrastructure  and  physical  assets  is  estimated  at \nNRs28.0 billion. The total needs for recovery and reconstruction are estimated at NRs39.70 \nbillion (footnote 3). \n \n7.  Due to the disruption in educational services, there will be an impact on enrollment, \nattendance,  and  internal  efficiency,  leading  to  an  increase  in  the  number  of  out-of-school \nchildren. With an increase in the demand for additional labor for reconstruction, some children, \nparticularly in the higher grades, may attend school less regularly or drop out. \n \n8.  Livelihood damage and needs. The earthquake affected the livelihoods of about 2.3 \nmillion households and 5.6 million workers across 31 districts, resulting in the loss of 94 million \nworkdays and NRs17 billion of personal income in FY2015. The agriculture sector was most \nseverely affected. It is estimated that 49% of all workdays lost occurred in agriculture, followed \nby tourism (31%), industry (11%), and commerce (9%) (footnote 3). \n \n9.  Affected households need immediate access to finance to recover their livelihoods and \nrestart income generation. However, microfinance institutions (MFIs), which are the main source \nof finance in rural areas, were also affected. 4 It is estimated that as of September 2015, \napproximately NRs10 billion MFI portfolio is at risk, and the funding needed by MFIs to meet \naffected people\u2019s demands is estimated at over NRs100 billion. In Nepal, only 14% of the total \npopulation have bank accounts. The majority of the affected households have access to only \nsemiformal MFIs (footnote 4). The earthquake affected a large number of such unbanked \nhouseholds, and it is estimated that approximately 30% of the 1.5 million MFI borrowers across \nthe country have been affected. \n \n10.  As most of the affected MFI borrowers do not have alternative credit source, MFIs will \nface both liquidity and solvency issues, impacting their capacity to assist their communities in \nthis time of need. MFIs have limited funding sources and mainly rely on the government\u2019s \ndeprived sector lending scheme, in which banks are mandated to allocate 5% of their total loan \nportfolio to relend to MFIs. After the earthquake, banks are particularly cautious in extending \nloans to MFIs due to the increased risk from the disaster. \n \n11.  Post-disaster  recovery  strategy.  For  the  education  sector,  the  recovery  strategy \ninvolves  three  major  elements:  (i)  improving  existing  policies,  guidelines,  and  systems  to \npromote safety; (ii) working to make new schools and other education institutions resilient to \nclimate change and disaster; and (iii) enhancing disaster resilience through awareness-building \namong teachers and students. \n \n12.  For the education sector, the government has already initiated reconstruction activities. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partners contributed to construct \ntemporary learning centers.5 ADB\u2019s Earthquake Emergency Assistance Project (EEAP) will (i) \n                                                \n4  MFIs  in  this  document  refer  to  both  microfinance  nongovernment  organizations,  and  savings  and  credit \ncooperatives. \n5   ADB. 2015. Nepal Earthquake Disaster Response Humanitarian Assistance (funded from the Asia Pacific Disaster \nResponse Fund). Manila. \n ", "3 \nsupport the reconstruction and retrofitting of schools in the 14 severely affected districts, and (ii) \nstrengthen awareness and capacities for disaster risk management at schools. 6 The EEAP will \nbuild on ADB\u2019s successful experience in piloting a school safety program that retrofitted 160 \nschools  and  provided  capacity  development  to  180  engineers  and  sub-engineers  of  the \ngovernment.7 \n \n13.  For livelihood recovery, the strategy focuses on enabling households to recover their \nproductive activities while increasing their resilience to disasters. Affected households must gain \naccess to finance to regenerate incomes, but they cannot obtain commercial sources of finance \nbecause their income streams have been disrupted. MFIs and savings and credit cooperatives \ncan  serve  as  effective  mechanisms  to  provide  assistance  in  rebuilding  affected  people\u2019s \nlivelihoods.  MFIs  have  huge  outreach,  community-based  linkages,  and  a  long  and  trusted \npresence in the rural areas. A priority need is injecting liquidity into MFIs to onlend to affected \nhouseholds and enabling them to restart their livelihoods and become bankable again. \n \n14.  The project is built on ADB\u2019s successful experience in extending rural finance services \nunder  ADB\u2019s  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development  Cluster  Program,  under  which  the  Small \nFarmers Development Bank (SFDB) and network of small farmers\u2019 cooperatives (SFCs) were \nreformed and strengthened as an efficient financial service provider. 8 The program enabled \n142,514 small farmers in rural areas to access institutional financial services for the first time. \n \n15.  Emergency assistance coordination. There are three phases of ADB\u2019s earthquake \nresponse: (i) an Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund grant of $3 million for Nepal Earthquake \nDisaster Response Humanitarian Assistance approved on 27 May 2015, (ii) a loan of $200 \nmillion for the EEAP approved on 24 June 2015, and (iii) the grant from the JFPR of $15 million \nfor the project. 9 \n \n16.  On 25 June 2015, the World Bank announced its plan to provide $100 million of support \nto Nepal from its International Development Association resources. It also pledged to reallocate \nup to $200 million from the existing portfolio for the recovery and reconstruction, and provide an \nadditional $200 million for a house reconstruction program. The Japan International Cooperation \nAgency (JICA) is focusing efforts on education with ADB and housing with the World Bank, in \naddition to general disaster risk reduction activities for increasing disaster resiliency. \n \n17.  Need for emergency assistance grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. \nThe project will have a strong focus on innovation, future orientation, and poverty reduction. The \nproject will rebuild or retrofit model schools that will be equipped with disaster-resilient structural \nstandards, more learning space, better furniture and amenities, and capable and dedicated \nteachers who are trained for disaster-preparedness education. The model schools can provide a \nprototype for possible replication in future. The JFPR grant funding will also enable the project \nto  provide  concessional  livelihood  restoration  microcredit  to  affected  poor  and  vulnerable \nhouseholds.  ADB  loans  or  other  commercial  sources  of  funding  are  not  suitable  for  the \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2015.

Manila. \n ", "4 \nemergency  microcredit,  as  the  funding  costs  would  be  prohibitive  to  meet  the  immediate \nlivelihood restoration needs of the affected borrowers. \n \n18.  The JFPR grant funding supplements the EEAP and enhances the recovery impact by \nfocusing on (i) recovery and livelihood restoration with improved disaster resilience of poorer \nand  vulnerable  households  among  the  severely  affected  districts;10 (ii) community  capacity \nbuilding  on  disaster  risk  reduction  following  the  \u201cbuild  back  better\u201d  concept;11 and  (iii)  the \nprovision of integrated assistance to affected communities by (a) addressing education and \nlivelihood  rehabilitation  needs,  and  (b)  reaching  a  wide  range  of  community  stakeholders, \nincluding  village  development  committees  (VDCs),  school  management  committees,  and \nwomen and youth groups. \n \n19.  The project fulfills the eligibility criteria under the Disaster and Emergency Assistance \nsection of ADB\u2019s Operations Manual.12 The project will not provide relief or comprehensive \nreconstruction,  but  will  aim  to  rebuild  high-priority  physical  assets  and  restore  economic \nactivities in affected areas. The project is also intended to provide transitional assistance for \npriority  rehabilitation  and  include  microcredit  for  a  quick  transfer  of  resources  to  affected \nhouseholds. ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy requires that the processing of \nan  emergency  project  will  not  exceed  12  weeks.13 The  Project\u2019s  ADB  Board  of  Directors \nconsideration date falls beyond 12 weeks from the government request date for the emergency \nassistance due to (i) additional time required for the Government of Japan\u2019s approval, and (ii) \ndelayed grant negotiation date because of Nepal\u2019s ongoing constitution formulation process. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n20.  The impacts will be (i) improved equity and enhanced social inclusion; and (ii) enhanced \ndisaster preparedness and resilience of earthquake-affected communities aligned with Nepal \nEarthquake  2015  Post  Disaster  Needs  Assessment.  The  outcome  will  be  livelihoods  and \nschooling in poorer and more severely earthquake-affected communities restored with better \ndisaster resilience. \n \nC.  Outputs \n21.  Output 1: Schools in poorer and severely affected districts constructed or rebuilt \nas  model  disaster-resilient  schools. The project will rebuild or retrofit at least 14 model \nschools with disaster-resilient standards in line with the government\u2019s education sector recovery \nstrategy (footnote 3), and equipped with information and communication technology equipment, \n                                                \n10 Sustainability in disaster risk reduction will be ensured in various measures, including adopting disaster risk \nmanagement plans by village development committees (VDCs) covered under the project (Appendix 1). \n11 Adopted at the Third United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, 14\u201318 March 2015 in Sendai, \nJapan. \n12 ADB received a request from the Government of Nepal for Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) for an \nemergency assistance on 18 June 2015. The PDNA, led by the National Planning Commission to estimate \ndamages, losses, and reconstruction needs, was initiated on 20 May 2015 and published on 25 June 2015. The \nearthquake is not a chronic natural hazard, but a rare, severe disaster. The security risks to ADB staff are at an \nacceptable level for engagement, as determined by the UN. The level of burden and risk-sharing among partners, \nespecially shareholders and other key local and international actors, is appropriate. An emergency assistance \ngrant was assessed as the most relevant instrument because (i) the proposed support is designed to provide \nimmediate to short-term assistance to ease the transition from relief to normal development through quick support \nfor priority recovery and reconstruction, and (ii) ongoing development programs need to advance simultaneously so \nthat Nepal\u2019s development objectives will be met.

Manila. \n ", "5 \nscience laboratories, and improved learning space, furniture, and other amenities. This output \nwill  be  implemented  using  the  same  implementation  arrangements  as  the  EEAP  and  in \ncoordination with JICA\u2019s planned reconstruction assistances for schools.14 The overall designs \nand approach to disaster-resilient structures are expected to be harmonized between the EEAP, \nJICA, and the project. \n \n22.  The project will cover the 14 severely affected districts, and there will be no overlapping \nbetween the EEAP and the project locations. This output will have a strong linkage to disaster \nrisk reduction capacity building (output 3) to make the model schools serve as local learning \ncenters for disaster risk reduction. \n \n23.  Output 2: Microcredit facility for livelihood restoration provided to members of \nsmall farmers\u2019 cooperatives. The project will provide microcredit to approximately 12,500 \naffected households to recover from the impacts of the earthquake. The microcredit, which will \nhave flexible purposes to meet the various needs of affected households, could finance (i) \nreviving  microenterprises;  (ii) restoring  livestock,  agricultural  activities,  and  other means of \nlivelihood; and (iii) purchasing essential expenses during the recovery period, such as food. \nMicrocredit will be channeled through SFCs affiliated under the SFDB. SFCs are member-\nowned and member-governed cooperatives with small and poor farmers as members. The \nSFDB has 85 SFC affiliates in the affected districts with 150,000 member households in total.15 \n \n24.  Using the grant proceeds, the government will provide a loan to the SFDB, which will \nrelend the loan to SFCs, which will onlend to final borrowers.16 Microcredit will be provided in \nthe same geographic areas for the model schools. SFC member networks will also be utilized to \nprovide  training  on  disaster-resilient  construction  and  community-based  disaster  risk \nmanagement (output 3). \n \n25.  Output  3:  Disaster  risk  management  capacity  of  the  affected  communities \nstrengthened. Training programs will be provided on disaster-resilient construction and disaster \nrisk management. The disaster-resilient construction training will adopt the training of trainer \nmethodology in which trained masons and carpenters will conduct training in communities. \n \n26.  The project will also support disaster risk management trainings for the communities \nassociated with the schools, including maintenance of school buildings as potential evacuation \ncenters  in  the  event  of  disaster.  The  project  will  prepare  community-based  disaster  risk \nmanagement plans for the individual school communities, and train locally selected teachers, \neducation administrators, school management committee members, and VDC members. \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n14 At the International Conference on Nepal\u2019s Reconstruction, JICA announced its plan to assist school reconstruction \nin collaboration with ADB. \n15 The SFDB was selected as a partner financial intermediary for the JFPR grant because it has (i) the most \nextensive  outreach  network  in  the  affected  districts,  (ii)  a  satisfactory  implementation  record  in  providing \nmicrofinance services in rural areas under ADB\u2019s project (footnote 8), and (iii) a functioning project implementation \nunit staffed with experienced experts that can facilitate fast disbursement and implementation under the emergency \ncircumstances. \n16 Final terms and conditions will be defined in the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government of Nepal and \nthe SFDB. \n ", "6 \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n29.  The Government of Nepal is to establish the National Reconstruction Authority (NRA) to \nsteer all the rehabilitation and reconstruction programs including this JFPR project. Upon its \n                                                \n17 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Any incidental expenditures relating to bank charges, local transport, freight, and insurance are eligible for ADB \nfinancing. \n ", "7 \nestablishment, the NRA will be the project\u2019s executing agency. In the interim, the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) will be the executing agency for the project.19  \n \n30.  The project will adopt the same overall project implementation arrangement as the \nEEAP. Under the EEAP, a dedicated project management unit will be established in the MOF as \nthe executing agency, consisting of managerial staff and technical experts assisted by project \nmanagement consultants. The project management unit of the EEAP will also be the project \nmanagement unit for the project. \n \n31.  Output 1 will be implemented using the EEAP implementation arrangement for school \nrebuilding.  Under  the  EEAP,  the  Department  of  Education  (DOE)  under  the  Ministry  of \nEducation  will  be  the  implementing  agency,  with  a  dedicated  project  implementation  unit. \nConsultants  to  be  recruited  under  the  EEAP  will  also  assist  in  the  implementation  of  the \nproject\u2019s  output  1.  The  implementing  agency  will  establish  a  high-level  task  force  for  the \napproval of designs for model schools and an overall policy for the construction of disaster-\nresilient school buildings. \n \n32.  For output 2, the Financial Sector Management Division (FSMD) of the MOF will be the \nimplementing agency, with SFDB as the partner financial intermediary. SFDB will channel the \nfunds to SFCs to onlend to its members. SFDB has been the implementing agency under ADB\u2019s \nRural Finance Sector Development Cluster Program (Subprogram 2) (footnote 8), whose project \nimplementation unit will be used for this output. \n \n33.  For output 3, the MOF\u2019s FSMD and the DOE will implement the output in their areas of \nresponsibility. The MOF\u2019s FSMD, in coordination with SFDB, will organize the disaster-resilient \nconstruction training and community-based disaster risk management training to SFCs. The \nDOE will organize training for school communities on disaster risk management. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2015\u2013September 2018 \nThe extended implementation period beyond the emergency assistance norm of 2 years \nis justified based on slow disbursement and implementation progress in similar projects \nin Nepal.a The project\u2019s implementation period needs to be aligned with the EEAP \nbecause the consultants under the EEAP will also support implementation of the project. \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2018 \nEstimated closing date  31 March 2019 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project Steering Committee (to be established) \n(ii)  Executing agency  MOF (interim executing agency) \n(iii)  Key implementing  Department of Education, MOF (Financial Sector Management Division), Small Farmers \nagencies  Development Bank (partner financial intermediary) \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Kathmandu, Nepal, about three full-time staff proposed (three offices) \nProcurement  National competitive bidding  2 contracts  $6.8 million \nShopping  Multiple contracts  $0.68 million \nConsulting services  Individual consultant selection  152 person-months  $608,000 \nSingle source selection  5 person-months  $125,000 \nRetroactive financing  Provided for eligible expenditures incurred for consulting services, procurement of goods \nand/or advance  and civil works, training and capacity building, and credit line after 25 April 2015, and up \ncontracting  to a maximum of 20% of the grant amount \n                                                \n19 A National Reconstruction Authority is expected to be established and provided with adequate financial and \napproval authority (through an ordinance or the 2015 earthquake rehabilitation and reconstruction act) to allow it to \nexecute rehabilitation and reconstruction programs successfully. \n ", "8 \nAspects  Arrangements \nDisbursement  The grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nupon between the government and ADB \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EEAP = Earthquake Emergency Assistance Project, MOF = Ministry of Finance. \na ADB. 2015. Disaster and Emergency Assistance. Operations Manual. OM D7/BP. Manila. \nSources: Asian Development Bank. \n \n34.  The procurement of goods and works, and recruitment of consulting services will be \ncarried out in a manner consistent with the simplified and expedient procedures permitted under \nADB\u2019s Disaster Emergency Assistance Policy, Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended \nfrom time to time), and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). ADB will assist the implementing agency in the selection of the following consultants, and \nthe executing agency will be responsible for contracts and administration: (i) engineer advisor \n(earthquake-resistant building design for the DOE), (ii) project management specialist (JFPR), \n(iii) school project coordinator (school safety, JFPR), (iv) training specialist (model schools for \nthe  DOE),  (v)  architect  (model  schools  for  the  DOE),  (vi)  information  and  communication \ntechnology  specialist  (model  schools  for  the  DOE),  and  (vii)  procurement  and  financial \nmanagement specialist for the DOE. \n \n35.  Procurement capacity assessments of the executing agency and implementing agencies \nhave been undertaken. Based on these assessments, (i) centralized procurement will be used \nby all implementing agencies, and (ii) the thresholds for procurement of goods and works as \nwell as consulting services have been agreed upon with the government. Likewise, ADB\u2019s prior \nreview and post-review have been set forth in the procurement plan. The procurement section in \nthe project administration manual details the thresholds and processes to be followed by the \nproject to support the executing and implementing agencies. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n36.  The design and site selection of model disaster-resilient school subprojects will be in \naccordance with the subproject selection criteria and approval procedures agreed with the \ngovernment. The project adopts the same subproject selection criteria as under the EEAP.20 \nThese include adherence to safeguards requirements and technical and economic viability. The \nscreening of subprojects will be led by the implementing agency. The objectives of the model \nschools will be better disaster resilience. Each school shall also serve as community-based \nlearning centers for disaster risk management, and promote community outreach for disaster \nrisk reduction planning and training programs. The possible impacts of climate change and its \nresilience measures will also be considered during the screening of subprojects. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n37.  Economic and financial assessments for the model disaster-resilient schools will be \nundertaken  after  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  approves  the  project  and  under  the  EEAP \nimplementation arrangement. The EEAP will conduct an economic analysis for model schools \nwith reference to cost\u2013benefit analysis of educational opportunities provided to students at risk \nof dropout, particularly in poor and vulnerable locations. Selection and approval of individual \n                                                \n20 The subproject selection criteria are in Appendix 5 of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nsubprojects, as well as their implementation, will be subject to the conduct of economic due \ndiligence and to the demonstration of each subproject\u2019s economic viability. \n \n38.  The project\u2019s model schools are public services goods with no cost recovery, and hence \nno financial viability assessment is required. The schools will be maintained using funds from \nthe government\u2019s recurrent budget. \n \n39.  Economic returns of microcredit for livelihood restoration will be an aggregate of at least \n12,500 investment subprojects, with each investment size less than $500. As such, quantifying \neconomic  returns  of  the  microcredit  will  be  difficult.  However,  microcredit  for  livelihood \nrestoration is expected to generate significant economic impacts through restored livelihoods \nand income-generating activities of affected households. Direct employment will be generated \nby  reviving  farm  activities  and  microenterprises.  Liquidity  injection  into  the  post-disaster \neconomic environment will enhance financial viability of SFCs. Improved financial viability of \nSFCs and enhanced financial intermediation in the affected areas will significantly reduce the \ngovernment\u2019s budgetary needs for rehabilitation. \n \n40.  SFDB\u2019s institutional due diligence was conducted in May 2015.21 SFDB is a leading rural \nfinance provider and is licensed and regulated as a class D financial institution (i.e., an MFIs) by \nthe Central Bank of Nepal. As a regulated institution, SFDB is subject to the central bank\u2019s on-\nsite and off-site inspection and minimum capital and liquidity compliance. SFDB has a track \nrecord  of  delivering  microfinance  services  through  SFCs.  It  has  successfully  expanded \nmicrofinance outreach in remote hill and mountain areas under ADB\u2019s Rural Finance Sector \nDevelopment Cluster Program (Subprogram 2) (footnote 8). \n \nC.  Governance \n41.  The project will be implemented under the same implementation arrangement as the \nEEAP. The FSMD of the MOF will be added as an additional implementing agency, and SFDB \nwill be added as the financial intermediary for the microcredit. The same measures to address \nthe  fiduciary  risk  will  be  applied  as  under  the  EEAP.  The  overall  fiduciary  risk,  although \nsubstantial, remains manageable as a result of the additional measures, notably the targeted \ntechnical assistance and support to the executing agency under the EEAP. All the implementing \nagencies,  including  the  FSMD  of  the  MOF  and  SFDB,  have  a  satisfactory  record  in \nimplementing ADB-funded projects. \n \n42.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, the MOF, and all implementing agencies. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n43.  The project will address the post-disaster needs of women and vulnerable groups, and \ntheir equal access to project benefits. The project will rebuild or retrofit model disaster-resilient \nschools  addressing  gender  equity  and  social  inclusion  (GESI)  concerns  such  as  meeting \nuniversal design and accessibility standards, building the capacity of women teachers and staff \non  emergency  response.  In  the  livelihood  restoration  microcredit  operation,  at  least  60% \n                                                \n21 Small Farmers Development Bank Due Diligence Report (accessible from the list of supplementary documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "10 \nmicrocredit borrowers are women. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming, \nand a GESI action plan was prepared.22  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n44.  The project is classified category B for environment. Subproject selection criteria were \nformulated to avoid significant adverse environmental impacts for outputs 1 and 3, and to \nexclude output 2 subprojects with environmental impacts. The environmental assessment and \nreview framework (EARF), prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) and government laws and regulations, will be used for the project. The project\u2019s EARF is \naligned  with the  EEAP.  Initial  environmental  examinations  and  environmental  management \nplans will be (i) prepared consistent with the EARF through consultant support provided through \nthe  project,  and  (ii)  incorporated  in  bidding  documents  and  contract  documents  to  be \nimplemented  by  contractors  and  monitored  by  the  implementing  agencies.  Environmental \nreporting to ADB\u2019s Nepal Resident Mission will be done on a semiannual basis. The project is \nclassified  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples. \nSubproject selection criteria were formulated to avoid land acquisition, involuntary resettlement \nimpacts, and social risks. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n45.  The overall implementing risk is considered to be high. The key risks relate to the \nongoing political instability and limited implementation capacity. To mitigate these key risks the \nproject\u2019s implementation arrangement will use the arrangement under the EEAP, with project \nmanagement consultants for output 1. For output 2, implementation will be supported by a \nnational  project  coordination  specialist,  who  has  extensive  experience  implementing  ADB-\nfunded  projects.  Major  risks  and  mitigation  measures  are  described  in  detail  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan.23 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n46.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the grant and project agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n47.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the administration by \nADB of the grant not exceeding the equivalent of $15,000,000 to Nepal for the Disaster Risk \nReduction  and  Livelihood  Restoration  for  Earthquake-Affected  Communities  Project,  to  be \nprovided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n23 September 2015\n                                                \n22 Gender and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2).  \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with: \nImproved equity and enhanced social inclusion, and enhanced disaster preparedness and resilience of \nearthquake-affected communities (Nepal Earthquake 2015 Post Disaster Needs Assessment)a \nProject R  esults  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nChain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nLivelihood and  a.
