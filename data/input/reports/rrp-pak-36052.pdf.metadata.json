An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  for \nnational  highways  and  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE) \nfor  the  other  roads  were  undertaken.  A  summary  EIA  containing \nessential elements of both the EIA and IEE was circulated to the \nBoard 120 days prior to Board consideration of the Project. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  (i)  the  provincial  road  network  in  the \nNorth-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP)  to  increase  access  to  the \nrural population; (ii) build capacity of the road agencies to improve \nefficiency,  sustainability,  and  safety  of \n(iii)  enhance  subregional  connectivity  by  improving  national \nhighways connecting the Afghanistan border to the Karachi ports \nand developing border-crossing infrastructure.  \n \nNWFP  is  the  poorest  of  the  four  provinces  with  a  poverty \nincidence  of  44%  compared  with  33%  for  the  country.  The  rural \nareas  of  NWFP  suffer  from  lack  of  connectivity  as  27%  of \ncommunities  lack  basic  motor  vehicle  access  and  68%  are  not \nserved  by  public  transport.  The  9,100  kilometer  (km)  road \nnetwork, of which over 4,000 km is unpaved, is in poor condition. \nThe  Government\u2019s  devolution  program  has  transferred  about \n7,000 km of roads to the newly established district governments, \nwhich lack capacity as well as resources to maintain them. \n \nThe  closest  ports  to  landlocked  Afghanistan  and  most  of  the \nCentral  Asian  republics  (CARs)  are  the  existing  ports  in  Karachi \nand the under-construction port at Gwadar. The bulk of traffic from \nnorthern  Afghanistan  and  the  CARs  enter  Pakistan  at  the \nTorkham  border  point  and  use  the  national  highways  to  access \nthe  ports.  With  stability  gradually  returning  in  Afghanistan  and \ngrowing  bilateral  trade  with  Pakistan,  the  opportunities  to  benefit \nfrom this corridor have significantly increased. \n \nThe  Project  is  part  of  sequenced  interventions  in  individual \nprovinces  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  integrated \ndevelopment  of  the  national,  provincial,  and  rural  access  roads \nalong with related institutional and policy reforms in the subsector. \nThese \ninterventions  also  support  subregional  cooperation \ninitiatives  by  improving  international  road  transport  corridors  and \ncross-border facilities. \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\nObjectives \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \n\n \n\nroads \n\nin  districts; \n\nThe Project represents the fourth intervention using this approach \nand  follows  the  earlier  road  projects  for  the  provinces  of  Sindh, \nPunjab, and Balochistan. \n \nThe  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  increase  access  of  the  rural \npopulation  in  NWFP  to  social  services  and  markets  leading  to \nimproved  livelihood  and  poverty  reduction,  enhance  efficiency  of \nthe  road  network  and  transport  in  the  province,  and  improve \nsubregional cooperation and trade by facilitating road transport to \nAfghanistan  and  the  CARs.  These  objectives  will  be  achieved \nthrough (i) provincial policy reforms and institutional strengthening \ncomponent  to  improve  the  management  of  road  subsector  and \nbuild capacity at provincial and district levels; (ii) provincial roads \nimprovement component involving rehabilitation and improvement \nof  212  km  of  provincial  highways  and  about  700  km  of  rural \naccess \n(iii)  subregional  connectivity \nimprovement  component  involving  construction  and  improvement \nof  about  310  km  of  national  highways  and  border-crossing \ninfrastructure at two border points with Afghanistan; and (iv) road \nsafety  component  involving  implementation  of  a  road  safety \nprogram along selected national highway sections improved under \nthe Project, awareness campaigns and capacity building. \n \nTo  support  the  sector  reform  agenda,  the  Project  will  help  (i) \nestablish  a  road  asset  management  system,  (ii)  implement \nperformance-specific  maintenance  contracts,  (ii)  involve  roadside \ncommunities  in  rural  road  maintenance  on  a  pilot  basis,  (iv) \nimprove road safety, (v) control vehicle overloading, and (vi) build \nthe  capacity  of  provincial  and  district  governments  in  road  asset \nmanagement. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  $423.6  million  equivalent.

Improvement  of  rural  access  roads  will  be  undertaken \nby  WSD\u2019s  Project  Management  Unit  and \nthe  District \nGovernments.  Project  directors  in  FHA,  MOC,  NHA,  and  the \nProject  Management  Unit  will  have  overall \nimplementation \nresponsibility.  Provincial  steering  committee,  MOC,  and  NHA  will \nbe responsible for monitoring implementation.  \n \nAll  civil  works  contract  packages  will  be  procured  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement following international and \nlocal competitive bidding procedures. \n \nThe  Project  will  require  international  and  domestic  consulting \nservices  for  (i)  policy  and  institutional  reforms,  road  asset \nmanagement  capacity  building,  and  project  management;  (ii) \ndetailed  engineering  and  construction  supervision/contract \nadministration for national  highways;  (iii)  design  and  construction \nsupervision  for  provincial  highways  and  rural  access  roads;  and \n(iv)  road  safety.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures  and  according  to \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \narrangements  satisfactory \nfor  engaging  domestic \nconsultants.  \n \n\nto  ADB \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\ntransport  costs  and \n\nThe  Project  will  have  a  significant  effect  on  poverty  reduction, \ndirectly  benefiting  approximately  1,000,000  people  in  the  24 \ndistricts of NWFP living adjacent to the roads and some 500,000 \nother road users. Of these, an estimated 900,000 are poor people \nwho  will  be  direct  beneficiaries.  Other  people  will  benefit  from \nlower \ninduced  economic  and  social \ndevelopment.  The  Project  will  generate  approximately  820,000 \nperson-months of employment opportunities for unskilled laborers. \nThe Project will have positive externalities, which will improve the \nlivelihood of the poor. \n \nInordinate delay in project start-up activities, such as engagement \nof  consultants  and  procurement  for  civil  works,  including  timely \napprovals by NHA and NWFP provincial government (NPG), is a \npotential  risk.  A  detailed  plan  of  preconstruction  activities  has \nbeen  prepared  in  consultation  and  agreement  with  NHA  and \nWSD-FHA as part of advance actions.  \n \nInadequate  district  maintenance  is  a  constant  risk  that  affects \nproject  sustainability.  The  Project  addresses  this  issue  by  (i) \nallowing  maintenance  to  be  undertaken  by  the  construction \ncontractor  for  up  to  10  years  for  project-financed  roads,  (ii) \nengaging  rural  communities  to  undertake  routine  maintenance, \nand  (iii)  building  the  capacity  of  district  staff  in  road  asset \nmanagement.  \n \nFailure  of  the  Government\u2019s  devolution  program  to  provide \nsufficient resources for maintenance will have an adverse impact \non  provincial  infrastructure  (including  roads)  that  has  been \ndevolved to the districts. However, NPG has given assurance that \nadequate  resources  will  be  provided  to  maintain  the  transferred \nroad assets once the districts\u2019 capacity is improved.  \n \nThe risks for failure or slowdown in policy and institutional reforms \nin  NPG  are  considered  manageable,  as  project  consultants  will \ncommit  and  support  NPG  and  WSD  in  introducing  the  reform \nmeasures and building capacity.  \n \nThe new cross-border access to Afghanistan is located in an area \nwhere  security  is  an  issue.  While  the  present  conditions  indicate \nan  escalated  security  environment,  the  Government  has  given \nassurance  that  this  is  a  temporary  phase  and  that  the  security \nlevel  will  return  to  normal  by  the  time  the  project  activities \ncommence. \n \n \n\n\f\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  North-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP)  Road \nDevelopment  Sector  and  Subregional  Connectivity  Project.  The  Project  Framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nRoads \n\n \n2. \nTransport is an important sector of Pakistan\u2019s economy, accounting for 10% of the gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)1  and  20\u201325% of the Public Sector Development Program. Roads are \nthe  predominant  mode  of  inland  transport  accounting  for  more  than  91%  of  passenger  traffic \nand  96%  of  freight  traffic.  The  total  road  network  in  the  country  is  approximately  250,000 \nkilometers (km). This includes 8,600 km of national highways and motorways and about 95,000 \nkm  of  provincial  roads  generally  categorized  as  highways,  and  secondary  and  access  roads. \nThe  remaining  are  paved  municipal  urban  roads  and  largely  unpaved  tertiary  roads  providing \naccess to villages and remote areas.  NWFP is the smallest of the country\u2019s four provinces with \nan  area  at  74,500  square  km  and  population  of  17.7  million.2  The  provincial  road  network3 \nconsists of about 9,100 km, of which about 5,000 km are paved. The rural areas of NWFP are \nstill not well-connected4 and this particularly affects the poor.  \n \n3. \nTo improve service delivery of social and other infrastructure at the grassroots level, the \nGovernment  embarked  upon  a  major  decentralization  effort  in  2001.  As  part  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  devolution  program,  the  Communication  and  Works  Department  of  NWFP \nprovincial government (NPG), which was responsible for the provincial road network, transferred \nresponsibility of over 7,000 km of its roads to 24 newly formed district governments along with a \nmajor  portion  of  its  staff.  The  provincial  Communication  and  Works  Department  was  then \ncombined  with  the  Public  Health  Engineering  Department  to  form  the  Works  and  Services \nDepartment (WSD). The Frontier Highway Authority (FHA) was established in 2001 to look after \nmaintenance  and  development  of  the  core  provincial  highway  network  of  about  2,100  km \nretained by NPG. A road sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n\n2. \n\nSubregional Cooperation and Connectivity \n\n \n4. \nAs  mandated  in  its  charter,  ADB  gives  high  priority  in  its  operations  to  regional \ncooperation.  In  South  and  Central  Asia,  ADB  has  been  actively  involved  in  two  subregional \ncooperation  initiatives:  (i)  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation,5  and  (ii)  the \nSubregional Economic Cooperation in South and Central Asia.6 For Pakistan,7 development of \n                                                 \n1   Government of Pakistan. 2003.

Involved Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Iran (as \nan observer). \n\n7   Pakistan  is  a  member  of  two  regional  organizations  for  economic  cooperation:  the  South  Asian  Association  of \n\nRegional Cooperation and the Economic Cooperation Organization. \n\n\f 2\n\ntransport corridors8 with Afghanistan and the Central Asian republics (CARs) assumes greater \nsignificance  as  these  are  landlocked  countries  and  the  closest  ports  are  the  existing  ports  in \nKarachi9 and the under-construction port in Gwadar. With stability gradually returning and major \nreconstruction  and  development  taking  place  in  Afghanistan,  bilateral  trade  between  Pakistan \nand Afghanistan is growing quickly, approaching over $1 billion annually. To promote this trade, \ntwo  additional  border-crossings10  have  been  agreed  upon:  starting  with  the  one  near  Miran \nShah in NWFP, south of the existing Torkham border.11 Similarly, significant progress has been \nmade in the transit trade by reducing the banned items list by half under the Afghanistan Transit \nTrade Agreement, and providing major concessions for storage of goods at the Karachi port.12  \n \nThe  north-south  national  highways  (N-5  and  N-55)13  carry  trade  and  transit  traffic  for \n5. \nAfghanistan and the CARs, and provide access to ports in the southern city of Karachi. About \n350  km  shorter,  the  N-55  is  being  upgraded  in  three  phases,  with  two\u2014totaling  786  km  (or \n65%)\u2014already completed.14 The third phase, involving two sections in NWFP (146 km), two in \nSindh (199 km), and one in Punjab (178 km), need to be completed to fully utilize the benefits of \nthe shortened corridor, reduce vehicle operating costs, and improve road safety.  \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nProvincial Road Network Challenges \n\n \n6. \nIn  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  devolution  program,  NPG  has  taken  major  steps  in \nrestructuring the responsibility of the provincial road network by establishing FHA to manage the \ncore  highways,  and  decentralizing  the  responsibility  of  other  roads  to  the  districts.  However, \nresource  and  capacity  constraints,  more  so  at  the  district  level,  will  remain  a  major  cause  of \ndeteriorating  road  conditions  and  loss  of  road  assets.  NPG  needs  to  (i)  strengthen  provincial \nand  district  road  institutions  and  build  staff  capacity;  (ii)  improve  the  condition  of  the  road \nnetwork;  (iii)  institute  sustainable  maintenance  of  the  network  through  short-  and  long-term \nmeasures including establishment of a road asset management system, user-pays principle to \nsupplement  maintenance  resources,  and  dedicated  road  maintenance  fund  to  provide \nsustainable  financing;  (iv)  ensure  provision  of  adequate  incentive-based  resources  to  the \ndistricts for maintenance of transferred road assets; (v) introduce physical and institutional road \nsafety initiatives to reduce traffic accidents due to increased speed on the improved roads; (vi) \ninitiate axle-load controls; (vii) involve communities in road development and maintenance; (viii) \nintroduce  environmental  and  social  aspects  in  road  planning  and  development;  and  (ix) \nintroduce policies that enable private sector participation.  \n \n\n                                                \n8   The  Karachi-Peshawar-Torkham-Kabul-Pule-Khumrie  corridor  leads  to  (i)  Tajikistan  through  Kunduz-Shir  Khan \nBandar, (ii) Uzbekistan through Mazar Sharif-Hairatan, and (iii) Turkmenistan through Shberghan-Andkhoy-Aquina. \n\n9   Karachi Port and Port Qasim. \n10  The existing ones are at Torkham in NWFP and Chaman in Balochistan. \n11  Current traffic volume at the Torkham border crossing reaches about 5,000 vehicles per day. \n12  Issues  relating  to  transportation  security  are  being  addressed  under  ADB\u2019s  Regional  Transportation  Security \n\nInitiative, 2004.    \n\n13  The 1,760 km Karachi-Lahore-Peshawar-Torkham highway N-5 is the primary transport artery of the country and \ncarries  60%  of  the  port  traffic  and  55%  of  the  intercity  traffic.  The  1,211  km  Hyderabad-D.I.Khan-D.G.Khan-\nPeshawar highway N-55 is also called Indus Highway.  \n\n14  With assistance from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\n2. \n\nRoad Connectivity and Poverty Reduction \n\n \n7. \nProviding  road  access  to  remote  communities  significantly  improves  social  indicators. \nImpact  studies  (footnote  4)  show  that  by  providing  motor-vehicle  access  to  communities,  the \nliteracy  rate  goes  up  by  68%,  enrolment  in  primary  schools  and  immunization  increases  by \n100%, infant mortality decreases by 12%, contraceptive prevalence goes up by 100%, and per \ncapita  consumption  increases  by  10%.  Improved  connectivity  ensures  better  road  transport \nservices  that  play  an  important  role  in  providing  access  to  economic  opportunities  including \nlabor  and  product  markets,  helps  the  poor  overcome  geographic  isolation  and  social  and \ncultural barriers, and enables the poor to participate in community and wider decision-making. \nHence, the improvement of rural roads has a direct impact on poverty reduction.  \n \n\n3. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n \n8. \nTraffic  accidents  and  deaths  along  national  highways  in  Pakistan  at  more  than  10,000 \nfatalities  per  year  (averaging  over  30  per  10,000  vehicles)  and  150,000  injuries  are  high \ncompared with similar roads in other Asian countries15, causing economic losses of more than \n2%  of  GDP.16  To  date,  road  safety  initiatives  have  largely  focused  on  the  motorways  and \nnational  highways.  Preliminary  information  from  initiatives  taken  by  the  National  Highway  and \nMotorway Police (NHMP) shows that enforcement coupled with engineering improvements and \nvehicle monitoring has contributed significantly to reducing traffic accidents and deaths. NHMP, \nestablished  in  1997,  has  successfully  installed  systems  to  improve  road  safety  along  the \nmotorways  (412  km)  and  national  highway  N-5  (1,762  km)  in  phases.  The  Government \nrecognizes  NHMP\u2019s  successful  performance  and  plans  to  expand  its  operations  to  cover  the \nentire national highway network.  \n \n\n4. \n\nRoad Maintenance \n\n \nFor  a  network  of  about  8,600  km  of  national  highways  and  motorways,  the  National \n9. \nHighway Authority (NHA) medium-term investment and maintenance plan (2002\u20132007) provides \nPRs63.9  billion  for  road  conservation,  indicating  an  increase  in  maintenance  allocations  from \n38% to 50% of the development budget. The plan involves prioritized highway investment and \nmaintenance  for  economically  viable  projects,  and  improving  the  balance  between  network \ndevelopment and conservation. NHA\u2019s road maintenance fund, established in 2000, is financed \nthrough  toll  revenues  to  ensure  a  stable  and  secure  source  of  operation  and  maintenance \nfunding.  Annual  revenues  collected  in  2003  were  over  PRs3.6  billion.  As  toll  revenues  are \nincreasing every year, NHA has sufficient resources to maintain the network.   \n \n10. \nFHA  receives  an  average  of  PRs730  million  annually  for  development  of  the  2,100  km \nnetwork of provincial highways it manages. This is supplemented by about PRs130 million for \nmaintenance  that  FHA  generates  mainly  from  tolls.17  These  resources  are  adequate  for \nmaintaining and gradually improving the network.  \n\n                                                \n15  ADB. 1992. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Islamic \nRepublic of Pakistan for the Provincial Highways Project. Manila. A survey under this project in 1998, along 1,200 \nkm of national highways in NWFP counted over 450 fatal accidents per year, amounting to 0.36 accidents per year \nper km. About 65 black spots, with more than 3 accidents per year, were registered. \n\n16  ADB estimates, 2004. \n17  Other major revenue sources include earnings from equipment rental, material testing, right-of-way rental charges, \n\nfees from roadside gas stations, and contractor\u2019s registration.  \n\n\f 4\n\nThe resources for the 24 districts with a network of about 7,000 km were curtailed from \n11. \nPRs123 million to PRs30 million in 2002\u20132003. A significant proportion of the network is in poor \ncondition  primarily  due  to  a  shortage  of  road  maintenance  funds,  but  also  due  to  lack  of \nadequate  capacity  of  the  district  road  agencies.  Based  on  road  condition  information  provided \nby  FHA  and  district  governments,  the  backlog  of  maintenance  needs  is approximately PRs2.5 \nbillion;  about  PRs138  million  are  needed  annually  to  sustain  the  network.18  Discussions  with \nNPG indicate that they are willing to provide the required resources if the districts develop the \ncapacity to utilize the funds properly. Hence, the districts\u2019 capacity needs to be developed; this \nwill lead to better governance and enhanced sustainability of the road network. \n \n\n5. \n\nCross-Border Facilities and Transit Facilitation \n\n \nThe  barriers  to  international  and  transit  trade  include  cumbersome  border-crossing, \n12. \ncomplicated  custom  procedures,  unnecessary  documentation \nrequirements,  and  poor \ninfrastructure facilities. The joint declaration signed at the end of the First Ministerial Conference \non  Transport  and  Trade  in  Central  and  South  Asia19  in  August  2003  and  the  subsequent \nWorking Group meeting in March 2004 recognized the need for border-crossing modernization. \nThis  includes  improving  truck-parking  facilities,  cargo  inspection  sheds,  weighbridges,  and \ncommunication  and  power  facilities.  Also  recommended  were  full-time  trained  customs, \nimmigration,  phyto-sanitary,  veterinary  staff,  and  archivists;  and  facilities  for  electronic \nconnectivity, and precollection of custom duties. ADB is providing technical assistance (TA)20 to \ndevelop  a  concept,  prepare  plans,  and  complete  a  package  including  outline  design  and \nspecifications for a pilot cross-border facility to be established and operated at Chaman border \npoint. The findings of this TA, experience of the pilot facility, and efforts under the Subregional \nEconomic  Cooperation  in  South  and  Central  Asia21  will  be  used  to  develop  the  two-border \ncrossings under the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n \n13. \nThe Government strategy for the transport sector involves (i) providing linkages between \nthe nation's major production centers, its seaports, and railways to all parts of the country and \ngateways  in  neighboring  countries  using  infrastructure  that  is  safe  and  in  good  condition;  (ii) \nproviding  the  rural  population  access  to  market,  health,  social  welfare,  and  education  centers; \nand  (iii)  supporting  evolvement  of  Pakistan  into  a  regional  transportation  hub  connecting \nlandlocked areas of neighboring countries to Pakistan's seaports and the global market. This is \nreflected  in  the  current  Public  Sector  Development  Program  that  focuses  on  consolidating  the \nnetwork,  improving  road  conditions  to  lower  transport  costs,  connecting  border  points  with  the \nports  in  the  south  to  enhance  regional  cooperation  and  international  and  transit  trade,  and \nimproving  the  country\u2019s  exports.  At  the  provincial  level,  the  Government\u2019s  priorities  focus  on \nimproving the core provincial highway network linking the districts as well as providing access to \nunserved  and  remote  areas  by  improving  the  rural  access  network  within  the  districts.  To \novercome  weak  district  capacity,  the  Government  supports  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the \n\n                                                \n18  An  independent  assessment  was  carried  out  under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  based  on  a \n\ndetailed condition/roughness survey of roads in Nowshera district. \n\n19  Held  at  Manila  during  31  July\u20131  August  2003  and  with  participation  of  Afghanistan,  Pakistan,  Tajikistan,  and \n\nUzbekistan, with Iran as observer.  \n\n20  The  TA  grant  of  $500,000  for  Cross-Border  Facility  and  Efficient  Transit  Facilitation  was  approved  under  ADB. \n2003.

The  new  local  government  system  also \noffers opportunities to address district road network management and cost recovery issues.  \n\nADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Support for the National Transport Policy \n\n \n7. \n \n14. \nADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update 2004\u20132006 focuses, among others, on (i) \nprovince-specific  interventions  in  transport  and  other  sectors,  (ii)  promotion  of  subregional \ncooperation  with  Afghanistan  and  the  CARs,  and  (iii)  governance  improvements  including \nsupport for the devolution program.  \n \n15. \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  formulating  its  transport  policy. \nInitial  assistance  was  provided  in  Nov-Dec  2003  for  an  assessment  of  the  current  transport \nsector  needs,  review  of  the  previous  work  on  policy  preparation,  and  recommendations  and \nguidelines  for  developing  a  national  policy  using  a  consultative  process  involving  all \nstakeholders.22  This  is  being  followed  up  with  an  advisory  TA  to  support  and  finalize  the \ntransport policy preparation working with a senior transport council and a working-level transport \ncoordination  committee  representing  stakeholders.  This  effort  will  continue  in  parallel  and  will \ncomplement  the  proposed  Government  study,  assisted  by  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency, for development of a national transport plan. \n \n\n8. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n \n16. \nPakistan has cumulatively received about $2.4 billion in external assistance for the road \nsubsector  (Appendix  3).  Of  this,  ADB  has  provided  $1.1  billion  for  nine  projects  during  1986\u2013\n2003,  the  World  Bank  $697  million  for  seven  projects  during  1964\u20132003,  and  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational  Cooperation  $570  million  for  six  projects  during  1989\u20132001.  The  majority  of \nassistance  from  the  World  Bank  has  focused  on  the  major  north-south  transport  artery  (N-5) \ncarrying  over  55%  of  the  country\u2019s  intercity  traffic.  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation\u2019s \nassistance has been focusing on the N-55 (Indus Highway), including a major tunnel, to provide \nan alternate north-south route west of the River Indus (footnote 13). \n \n17. \nADB\u2019s assistance in the road subsector in Pakistan started in 1986 with farm-to-market \nroad  projects  that  were  later  expanded  to  include  provision  of  access  to  remote  rural  areas. \nSince  2001,  ADB  has  initiated  sequenced  interventions  in  individual  provinces  to  improve  the \nnational  and  provincial  road  networks  along  with  the  related  institutional  and  policy  reforms. \nThese  interventions  also  support  the  subregional  cooperation  initiatives  through  improved \ninternational road transport corridors and cross-border facilities. \n \n\n9. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \nDuring 1986\u20131996, ADB targeted development of the provincial road networks with four \n18. \numbrella-type projects that included components in each of the country\u2019s four provinces. These \nprojects  aimed  to  improve  the  mobility  of  the  rural  community  and  their  access  to  health, \neducation,  and  social  amenities;  provide  reliable  road  access  to  markets;  and  support \nagricultural rural development. The wide geographic dispersion of projects and large number of \ngovernment  agencies  was  not  conducive  to  timely  implementation  and  pursuing  the  sector \nreform  agenda  with  the  provincial  governments.  Accordingly,  implementation  suffered  from \n\n                                                \n22  Ministries of finance, communications (highways and shipping), railways, defense (civil aviation), local government, \n\nand planning commission, and representatives of provincial road agencies.  \n\n\f 6\n\nfragmented  efforts,  coordination  problems,  and  lack  of  ownership  and  commitment  by  the \nprovincial road agencies that own the bulk of the road network. \n \n19. \nAddressing  the  identified  weaknesses  of  earlier  projects,  ADB  adopted  a  province-\nfocused  approach  integrating  development  of  national,  provincial,  and  rural  roads  within  the \nprovince.  During  2001\u20132003,  three  provincial  road  sector  projects  were  approved  for  Sindh, \nPunjab, and Balochistan provinces.23 Extensive national and provincial policy discussions were \nheld to identify subsector issues and develop a comprehensive policy reform agenda. In view of \nthe  initiatives  already  started  by  NHA,  ADB  agreed  to  include  a  program  loan  with  the  Sindh \nProject  to  support  completion  of  the  national  road  policy  reforms.  The  national  policy  matrix \nprovided  the  overarching  framework  for  development  of  provincial  road  policy  reforms,  as  key \nelements  of  the  reforms  were  equally  applicable  to  the  provinces.  The  policy  discussions  with \nthe provinces focused on these key elements and led to adoption of a program approach that \ninvolved sequenced interventions in each of the four provinces to achieve the subsector policy \nreform.  \n \nThe  ongoing  province-focused  road  projects  in  Balochistan,  Punjab,  and  Sindh  are \n20. \nexperiencing  some  initial  start-up  delays  in  recruitment  of  consultants  and  civil  work \nprocurement  that  has  adversely  affected  implementation  progress.  The  main  causes  of  these \ndelays are (i) frequent changes in key project staff, and (ii) lack of preparation and provision of \nadequate  resources  to  implement  advance  procurement  actions.  In  addition,  absence  of \nestablished procedures for procurement decisions result in multiple levels of clearances by the \nprovincial governments causing significant delays. All international procurement was managed \nby  the  federal  coordinating  agencies  in  implementing  earlier  umbrella  projects.  Hence  the \nprovinces lack experience in engaging international consultants and procuring civil works under \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  The  Project  addresses  these  concerns  by  (i) \npreparing  a  preconstruction  activities  action  plan  including  a  detailed  schedule  in  consultation \nwith  the  executing  agencies,  (ii)  seeking  the  executing  agencies\u2019  assurance  for  assigning \nthe \nexperienced  staff  and  providing  adequate  resources \npreconstruction activities action plan, (iii) seeking Government/NPG assurances not to transfer \nthe project staff for 3 years, or at least until civil works contracts are awarded, and (iv) seeking \nthe  executing  agencies  assurance  to  engage  local  consultants  to  help  them  implement  the \npreconstruction activities action plan at least until project consultants are engaged.  \n \n\nthe  activities \n\ninitiate \n\nto \n\nin \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nObjectives \n\n \nA. \n \n21. \nThe Project is part of ADB\u2019s sequenced interventions in individual provinces to improve \nthe national and provincial road networks along with related institutional and policy reforms. The \nProject\u2019s  objectives  are  to  increase  access  of  the  rural  population  in  NWFP  to  social  services \nand  markets  leading  to  improved  livelihoods  and  poverty  reduction,  enhance  efficiency  of  the \nroad network and transport in the province, and improve subregional cooperation and trade by \nfacilitating  road  transport  to  Afghanistan  and  the  CARs.  These  objectives  will  be  achieved \n\n                                                \n23 ADB. 2001.

The  Project  is  in  accordance  with  the  strategy  outlined  in  the  Country \nStrategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006), which focuses, among others, on province-specific \ninterventions  in  transport  and  other  sectors,  promotion  of  subregional  cooperation  with \nAfghanistan  and  the  CARs,  and  governance  improvements  including  support  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s  devolution  program.  The  Project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Regional  Cooperation \nStrategy and Program, and also supports the Government\u2019s transport strategy. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nThe  Project  will  finance  (i)  provincial  policy  reforms  and  institutional  strengthening \ncomponent to improve the management of road subsector and build capacity at provincial and \ndistrict  levels;  (ii)  provincial  roads  improvement  component  involving  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement  of  212  km  of  provincial  highways  and  about  700  km  of  rural  access  roads  in \ndistricts;  (iii)  subregional  connectivity  improvement  component  involving  construction  and \nimprovement  of  about  310  km  of  national  highways  and  border-crossing  infrastructure  at  two \nborder  points  with  Afghanistan;  and  (iv)  road  safety  component  involving  implementation  of  a \nroad  safety  program  along  selected  national  highway  sections  improved  under  the  Project, \nawareness campaigns and capacity building.  \n \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nProvincial Policy Reforms and Institutional Strengthening Component \n\n \n23. \nThe Project will assist FHA and district governments to (i) achieve efficiency in service \ndelivery  through  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building,  (ii)  improve  sustainability  of \nthe network through road asset management involving planned maintenance and enforced axle-\nload  controls,  (iii)  supplement  provincial  resources  through  the  user-pay  principle  and \nestablishment  of  a  dedicated  road  maintenance  fund,  (iv)  involve  communities  in  road \nmaintenance, (v) improve road safety, (vi) enhance private sector involvement in financing and \nconstructing  roads,  and  (vii)  incorporate  environmental  and  social  aspects  into  planning  road \ninfrastructure  developments.  The  proposed  policy  matrix  and  action  plan  for  FHA  and  district \nroad agencies is in Appendix 4.  \n \nExtensive  policy  discussions  were  held  with  NPG  regarding  institutional  and  sector \n24. \nreforms under the Project. These reforms are based on the national framework and represents \nissues specific to the province. In view of the organizational changes that have taken place in \nmanaging  the  road  subsector  in  NWFP,  the  policy  reforms  are  structured  separately  for  the \nprovincial  road  agency  (FHA)  and  the  district  road  agencies.  To  support  the  road  reform \nagenda, the Project will finance (i) consulting services, (ii) establishment of a modern road asset \nmanagement  system  (RAMS)  in  FHA  and  a  simpler  RAMS  in  selected  districts,  (iii) \nimplementation  of  performance-specific  maintenance  contracts  on  selected  FHA  roads,  (iv)  a \npilot  effort  to  involve  roadside  communities  in  undertaking  routine  maintenance  of  rural  roads, \n(v) an axle-load control program, (vi) assistance to promote private sector participation in road \nconstruction  and  maintenance,  (vii)  establishment  of  road  safety,  environment,  and  social \nassessment cell in FHA, and (viii) capacity building of FHA and district road agencies. \n \n\n\f 8\n\n2. \n\nProvincial Roads Improvement Component  \n\n \n25. \nProvincial  Highways.  The  Project  will  finance  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  five \npriority provincial highway sections totaling 212 km. The design standards are in Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \n26. \nRural Access Roads. The Project will finance rehabilitation and reconstruction of about \n700 km of rural access roads. As with the earlier provincial road projects in other provinces, a \nsector  approach  will  be  followed  for  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  rural  access  roads.24 \nNPG has identified five core roads that meet the agreed selection criteria (Appendix 5), totaling \nabout 100 km and representing the typical geophysical, environmental, and social conditions in \nthe  province.  Subprojects  for  core  roads  were  prepared  under  the  project  preparatory  TA. \nSubproject  preparation  involves  a  feasibility  study;  environmental,  social,  and  resettlement \nassessments;  detailed  engineering;  and  preparation  of  bidding  documents.  The  design \napproach and technical standards are in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \nThe remaining about 600 km of roads will be selected during implementation based on \n27. \nthe  selection  criteria  that  involve  poverty  targeting,  technical  and  economic  feasibility,  social \nassessment,  resettlement,  consideration  for  indigenous  people,  environmental  considerations, \nstakeholder consultation, and availability of counterpart resources. The roads will preferably be \nselected  from  the  2,745  km  initially  proposed  by  the  districts.  Details  on  allocation  of  roads  to \nthe  districts,  selection  procedure,  endorsement  of  project  financing,  involvement  of  district \nrepresentatives, eligibility criteria for districts, implementation procedures, and flow of funds are \noutlined in Appendix 6.  \n \n\n3.  \n\nSubregional Connectivity Improvement Component \n\n \n28. \nNational Highways. The Project will finance rehabilitation and construction of about 310 \nkm of national highways that are part of the subregional transport corridor providing access for \nAfghanistan  and  the  CARs  to  the  Karachi  ports.  This  includes  (i)  a  192  km  section  of  two \nnational  highways  (N-5  and  N-55)  that  connect  the  Torkham  border  crossing  with  the  Karachi \nports,  and  (ii)  a  third  cross-border  access  to  Afghanistan  involving  improvement  of  118  km  of \nroad that connects the border town of Ghulam Khan to national highway N-55 at Sarai Gambila.  \n \n29. \nExcept for the 46 km Peshawar-Torkham road, the other three national highway sections \nwill be improved to the technical standards outlined in Supplementary Appendix A. Traffic on the \nPeshawar-Torkham section of national highway N-5, which provides access to Afghanistan and \nthe CARs, is high and projected to increase as a result of improving bilateral trade between the \ntwo countries and international transit trade from the CARs. However, improvements to this road \nare constrained by heavily populated settlements on either side, railway lines running adjacent \nto  the  road,  steep  gradients,  and  sharp  curves  that  are  difficult  large  commercial  vehicles  to \nnegotiate. Accordingly, this road will be constructed on a new alignment that allows enhanced \ncapacity through four lanes and improved road geometry.  \n \nCross-Border  Facilities.  The  Project  will  finance  (i)  improvement  of  infrastructure  and \n30. \nfacilities  at  the  Torkham  border  crossing,  (ii)  construction  of  a  new  cross-border  facility  at  the \nGhulam Khan border point with Afghanistan, and (iii) supply and installation of equipment. The \n\n                                                \n24  NPG  has  adopted  appropriate  policies  that  prioritize  investments  for  improving  the  road  sector.  WSD  has  been \nimplementing  ADB  and  externally  funded  projects,  and  has  the  capacity  to  prepare,  appraise,  and  implement  a \nsector-type project. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n4. \n\nRoad Safety Component \n\nThe  Project  will  finance  equipment  and  facilities  to  expand  NHMP  operations  on  the     \n\nfacilities  include  customs  infrastructure;  cargo  inspection  sheds;  weighbridges;  warehousing; \nparking of vehicles; and immigration, communication, and power facilities. Development of this \ncomponent  will  be  based  on  the  findings  of  the  ongoing  TA  for  cross-border  development   \n(para. 14), which will also include institutional and legislative aspects to improve operations.  \n \n \n \n31. \nN-55  and  N-5  highway  sections  improved  under  the  Project  as  a  pilot  safety  zone  for  the \nprovince.25  The  Project  includes  consulting  services,  equipment,  and  capacity  building  for         \n(i) coordination and management of road safety efforts, (ii) establishment of road accident data \nsystems,  (iii)  improved  planning  and  design  of  roads  and  conduct  of  road  safety  audits,           \n(iv) improvement of hazardous locations, (v) road safety education, (vi) publicity and campaigns, \n(vii) emergency assistance to road accident victims, and (viii) road safety research. The Project \nwill  address  policy  issues  through  implementation  of  the  NWFP  Road  Safety  Action  Plan    \n(Appendix 7) designed to bring policy and institutional reforms to strengthen road safety efforts \nin the province consistent with the ongoing initiatives for national highways.  \n \n32. \nThe Project also supports a community road safety initiative to mitigate the risk of road \ncrashes and injury to local communities. Road safety issues that could be effectively addressed \nthrough  road  safety  campaigns  will  be  identified,  developed,  implemented,  and  evaluated  to \nconfirm  consistency  and  quality.  Local  communities  will  be  educated  on  the  risks  they  face  in \nusing  the  road  system  and  how  they  can  reduce  these  risks.  Local  road  users,  pedestrians, \nusers of public transport, and drivers will be made aware of the rules of the road and the need to \ndrive safely. To improve road safety during construction for the project-financed civil works, the \nbidding documents will itemize the road safety measures as \u201cpaid-items\u201d in the bill of quantity to \nensure contractors\u2019 compliance. The supervision consultant will monitor its implementation, and \nthese responsibilities will be reflected in the consultant\u2019s terms of reference.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n \n1. \n\nRoad Asset Management and Maintenance \n\n \n\na. \n\nProvincial \n\n \n \n \n33. \nProvincially,  the  Project  will  improve  the  FHA  road  network,  build  capacity,  establish  a \nroad  maintenance  fund  to  utilize  toll  and  other  resources  generated  by  FHA  for  maintenance, \nand build FHA\u2019s image as a center of excellence to sustain capacity building for the districts. To \nenable FHA to maximize the use of resources available for road maintenance, the Project will \nprovide FHA with TA, training and equipment to fully develop RAMS capability, update the road \ninventory, and undertake road condition data collection.26 The Project will also rehabilitate and \nupgrade the existing road research and material testing, and training facilities of FHA.    \n \n34. \nFHA will be encouraged to move toward performance-specific maintenance contracts to \nstreamline  its  functioning.  The  Project  will  finance  pilot  efforts  to  initiate  performance-specific \nmaintenance  contracts  on  FHA  roads.  Contract  documentation  with  specifications  will  be \n\n                                                \n25  This involves the D.I.Khan-Sarai Gambila-Kohat-Peshawar-Torkham highway for a total length of about 370 km. \n26  Some  FHA  staff  acquired  skills  in  the  highway  design  and  maintenance  model  (HDM)-based  RAMS  under  an \n\nearlier ADB-financed project. \n\n\f 10\n\n \n\nb. \n\nDistrict  \n\ndeveloped for a 5-year period for selected FHA roads identified during implementation with ADB \napproval. The contracts will be extended if they prove successful.  \n \n35. \nThe Project will provide assistance to establish a dedicated provincial road maintenance \nfund;  review  the  current  sources  of  road  maintenance  funds;  and  identify  (i)  opportunities  for \ncost reduction and/or more efficient use of existing resources, and (ii) new sources of revenue \nincluding  additional  user  charges.  The  medium-term  road  maintenance  needs  and  funding \nsources will be assessed, and a funding mechanism designed. This may include a maintenance \nfee or similar other fee for all heavy vehicles passing strategic points on NWFP\u2019s road network. \nNWFP\u2019s  relatively  simple  road  network  makes  a  pay-as-you-go  scheme  feasible  and  would \nenable trucks to be charged based on weight, axle configuration, and distance traveled.  \n \n \n \n36. \nThe  Project  aims  to  (i)  promote  sustainability  of  the  road  assets  improved  under  the \nProject;  (ii)  build  capacity  of  district  staff,  establish  good  practices  to  enhance  NPG\u2019s \nconfidence,  and  promote  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  districts;  and  (iii)  supplement  district \ncapacity, particularly in remote areas. This is translated into (i) allowing maintenance of project-\nfinanced  rural  access  roads  by  the  construction  contractor  for  up  to  10  years,  (ii)  building \ncapacity  of  district  staff  in  road  asset  management,  and  (iii)  engaging  rural  communities  to \nundertake routine maintenance of remotely located roads. \n \n37. \nDistricts governments need additional resources to overcome the resource gap for road \nmaintenance.  An  initial  PRs500  million  is  needed  during  the  first  5  years  for  backlog \nmaintenance  of  the  paved  district  road  network,  followed  by  about  PRs250  million  annually. \nBased  on  the  historical  annual  allocation  for  NWFP  roads,  this  is  not  an  unusual  figure  as \nPRs296 million were provided in 1995/96. NPG realizes the need and is willing to provide these \nresources  to  the  districts  once  the  district  governments  acquire  sufficient  capacity  to  utilize  it \nproperly.  Project  financing  of  rural  access  roads  in  districts  is  closely  linked  to  the  districts\u2019 \nperformance in implementing their road maintenance program (Appendix 6). \n \n38. \nEstablishing sophisticated district RAMS may not be feasible given current resources. A \nsimple approach based on the regular collection and comparison of road condition data would \nnevertheless provide valuable information to support the rational allocation of scarce funds. The \nProject will finance a pilot effort to collect and present road condition data in selected districts in \na  form  that  would  enable  rational  decision  making  by  nontechnical  district  officials.  The  data \ncollection  expertise  established  in  FHA  will  be  made  available  for  the  pilot  activity.  To  ensure \nimprovement of rural access roads financed under the Project, the civil work contracts will have \nthe option to enable the contractor to maintain the road for 5\u201310 years. \n \nOne way of addressing the need for increased maintenance of rural access roads is to \n39. \ninvolve  the  communities  in  maintaining  the  roads  that  serve  their  villages.  Community \ninvolvement  in  the  provision  and  upkeep  of  rural  infrastructure  is  common  in  Pakistan,27  but \ncommunity  road  construction  and  maintenance  has  been  limited  to  gravel  roads.  Convincing \ncommunities to assume the responsibility of routine road maintenance of more substantial roads \nmay  be  a  challenge.  However,  if  incentives  are  provided  for  the  community  and  the  proposed \nscheme  is  seen  to  be  fair,  this  initiative  could  significantly  supplement  the  capacity  of  the \n\n                                                \n27  Under  a  number  of  projects,  the  Sarhad  Rural  Support  Programme  is  helping  provide  a  range  of  community \ninfrastructure, including roads linking villages to the existing road network with full participation and stake by rural \ncommunities. Several of the project roads were initially constructed as a community initiative. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\ndistricts  to  maintain  their  networks.  The  Project  will  provide  assistance  to  WSD  and  district \ngovernments to identify suitable roads, preferably remotely located, where this initiative can be \ntaken  up  under  the  Project.  This  will  involve  community  mobilization  and  training  in  road \nmaintenance  principles  by  project-assisted  non-government  organizations.  This  approach \ncomplements  other  efforts  being  piloted  under  the  Project,  and  will  contribute  to  sustainable \nmaintenance of the district road network.  \n\n \n2. \n\nCapacity Building of Road Agencies \n \na. \n\nProvincial \n\n \n40. \nThough technically sound, FHA staff lack capacity in areas of environmental evaluation, \nresettlement and social impacts, road safety, axle-load control, and promotion of private sector \nparticipation.  In  addition,  the  existing  road  research  and  material  testing  facility  needs  to  be \nrevived  to  help  develop  appropriate  design  and  improve  quality  control  of  road  development \nprojects.  To  address  these  constraints,  the  Project  will  help  FHA  to  (i)  establish  a  road  safety \nenvironment and social assessment cell; (ii) initiate an axle-load control program; (iii) revive the \nroad research and material testing facility; and (iv) based upon the findings of the ongoing TA \n(Appendix 2), initiate a program to promote private sector investments in road development and \nmaintenance.  To  ensure  the  proposed  initiatives  achieve  the  intended  purpose,  a  program  to \nbuild the capacity of FHA staff will be developed and implemented under the Project. With initial \nassistance from the consultants, FHA capacity will be enhanced to improve its performance and \nenable it to become a center of excellence for the province, providing advice and training to the \ndistricts\u2019  road  staff.  In  this  context,  FHA\u2019s  existing  training  facility  will  be  rehabilitated  and \nupgraded to impart and sustain training to the district government staff.   \n \n\nb. \n\nDistrict  \n\nThe newly established district governments have capacity constraints. As the roles and \n41. \nresponsibilities  vis-\u00e0-vis  NPG  are  still  evolving,  assessment  of  capacity-building  needs  will  be \nundertaken  during  implementation.  The  relatively  small  size  of  the  district  road  agencies \nrestricts  their  capacity  to  provide  all  the  functions  required.  However,  this  also  offers  an \nopportunity  to  outsource  several  functions  to  the  private  sector,  following  FHA\u2019s  example.  A \nnumber  of  capacity-building  initiatives  in  governance  and  social  sectors  are  already  ongoing, \nsponsored  by  ADB  and  other  development  agencies.  Therefore,  capacity  building  under  the \nProject  will  focus  on  road  construction  and  maintenance.  The  force-account  labor  for  road \nmaintenance  is  being  phased  out  in  the  districts  and  an  increasing  proportion  of  maintenance \nworks  are  being  contracted  out.  As  a  result,  the  role  of  the  district  road  agencies  will  change \nfrom  construction  and  maintenance  to  planning,  management,  and  contract  administration. \nAccordingly, the Project will include capacity building in the areas of contract management, road \nasset management, environmental and social aspects, and performance monitoring. \n \n\n3. \n\nEnhancing Road Improvement Benefits to Poor Communities \n\n \nThe  poor  in  NWFP  face  particularly  high  barriers  to  taking  advantage  of  the  Project\u2019s \n42. \nroad  development.  These  barriers  include  low  levels  of  literacy  and  education,  poor  health \nprofiles, lack of access to safe water and sanitation, trade development skills, and marketing of \ntheir  produce.  The  lack  of  rural  mobility  and  connectivity  has  been  shown  to  have  a  strong \npositive correlation with improved socioeconomic indicators for rural communities. Women face \nsevere  social  and  cultural  restrictions  on  their  mobility  combined  with  a  low  skill  base;  the \nbenefits  of  improved  roads  are  less  likely  to  make  much  impact  on  women\u2019s  poverty.  Social \n\n\f 12\n\nsurveys show that the net benefits of road development are expected to accrue to the poor only \nif  intra-village  accessibility  and  connectivity  to  the  main  roads  are  improved  within  the  project \narea. To enhance the ability of the poor and the very poor to benefit from road development, an \nadditional complementary mechanism (proposed to be financed under a $1.0 million grant from \nthe  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  [JFPR])  is  designed  to  lower  these  barriers.  The \nproposed  JFPR-assisted  project28  will  target  the  barriers  specifically  preventing  the  very  poor \nand  poor  from  utilizing  the  road  to  raise  themselves  out  of  poverty.  This  project  builds  on  the \nskills  and  experience  of  existing  non-government  and  community-based  organizations,  and \nincludes  the  provision  of  information  and  linkages  to  existing  poverty  reduction  programs.  The \ndraft JFPR proposal is in Supplementary Appendix B. The preparation of the JFPR project will \ncontinue in parallel with the Project. \n \nD. \n \n43. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $423.6  million  equivalent  inclusive  of  civil \nworks,  consulting  services,  equipment,  incremental  costs,  land  acquisition  resettlement,  taxes, \nduties, interest, and other charges (Table 1). The foreign exchange cost is estimated as $243.2 \nmillion  (57.4%).  The  local  currency  cost  (including  taxes  and  duties)  is  estimated  as  $180.4 \nmillion equivalent (42.6%).

The loan will have a 25-year term, including \na  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per \nannum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nThe  Government  also  requested  a  loan  of  $5.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources \n(SFR) to finance the Provincial Policy Reform and Institutional Strengthening Component. The \nloan  will  have  a  32-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The  Government  has  provided \nADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility \nand  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. \n \n45. \nThe Government will make the loan proceeds available to NPG ($154.6 million OCR and \n$5.0  million  Special  Funds  resources),  NHA  ($136.6  million  OCR)  and  Ministry  of \nCommunications (MOC) ($5.0 million OCR) for the purposes of the Project in accordance with \nthe  existing  policies  and  practices  of  the  Government  on  favorable  terms  and  conditions.

For civil works under the \nsubregional connectivity component, loan financing remains at 60%. Thus ADB will be financing \n71% of the overall Project. The counterpart-funding requirement for NPG is for $31.8 million, for \nNHA $88.8 million and for MOC $1.8 million.  \n \nAbout  19%  of  the  loan  will  be  used  for  local  currency  cost  financing.  The  overall \n47. \neconomic growth rate in Pakistan has accelerated and is expected to be about 6% of GDP for \nFY2003/04.  Due  to  recent  revenue  gains  and  expenditure  restraints,  the  fiscal  deficit  is \nexpected to decrease to about 4% of GDP for FY2003/04, its lowest level in the past decade.  \nWhile this economic performance is commendable, Pakistan needs to consolidate its economic \ngains by undertaking second-generation reforms. Given its large development financing needs, \nrelatively low ratios of domestic savings and investment to GDP, manifested by the presence of \na  saving-investment  gap,  Pakistan  will  continue  to  need  external  assistance  to  supplement  its \ndevelopment activities. Given the rather limited revenue base of NWFP, local cost financing is \nnecessary,  On  completion,  the  Project  will  generate  a  revenue  stream  strengthening  the \nprovincial fiscal profile.  \n\n\f 14\n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nF. \n \n \n \n48.  WSD will be the Executing Agency for the two provincial components. (i), and (ii). Under \nWSD,  FHA  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  the  provincial  policy  reforms  and  institutional \nstrengthening component, and the provincial highway subcomponent under the provincial road \nimprovement component. The rural access roads subcomponent will be undertaken by WSD\u2019s \nProject  Management  Unit,  which  was  responsible  for  implementing  earlier  ADB-financed  road \nprojects in the province and the district governments (Appendix 9). WSD has already appointed \na  project  director.  FHA  needs  to  appoint  one  to  coordinate  and  manage  implementation  of \nprovincial  highways  subcomponent.  The  Local  Government  Department  will  help  WSD \ncoordinate capacity building of the district road entities. \n \n49. \nNPG will establish a project steering committee, chaired by the additional chief secretary \n(planning and development), to provide overall guidance and approvals required for smooth and \ntimely implementation of the Project at the provincial level. The project steering committee will \ncomprise the WSD secretary; FHA managing director; representatives of finance, planning, local \ngovernment departments, and district governments; and the project directors. They will meet at \nleast quarterly to review implementation, provide necessary approvals, and resolve coordination \nissues.  The  project  steering  committee  will  be  responsible  for  approving  subproject  proposals \nfor rural access roads. The FHA project director will serve as the secretary.  \n \n50. \nNHA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  subregional  connectivity  improvement \ncomponent (Appendix 9). The existing Task Force on Trade and Facilitation29 under the Ministry \nof  Commerce  will  provide  guidance  for  planning  improvements  and  operations  of  the  cross-\nborder facilities. NHA will appoint a project director to coordinate and manage implementation of \nthe physical infrastructure.   \n \n51.  MOC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  road  safety  component  (Appendix  9).  MOC \nwill  appoint  a  project  director  to  coordinate  with  NHMP  for  implementing  the  pilot  road  safety \nzone subcomponent. MOC will also coordinate with FHA, NHA, and WSD for capacity building \nin  road  safety  and  help  them  comply  with  the  provincial  road  safety  policy  matrix  and  action \nplan.  \n \n \n \n52. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years,  including  preconstruction  activities.  It  is \nscheduled for completion by December 2010. The first phase of contract packages for national \nand provincial highways and core rural access roads will be awarded by the middle of 2005, the \nsecond phase by the end of 2005, and the third phase consisting of only rural access roads by \nthe end of 2006. A detailed implementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n \n \n53. \nADB  has  approved  advance  action  for  commencing  engagement  of  consultants  and \nprocurement of civil works. This will allow the executing agencies to initiate procurement actions \n\nImplementation Period \n\nAdvance Action \n\n3. \n\n2. \n\n                                                \n29  Chaired  by  the  joint  secretary  (trade),  MOC,  the  task  force  includes  members  from  the  ministries  of  commerce, \ncommunication,  and  interior;  NHA;  National  Logistic  Cell;  Central  Board  of  Revenue;  and  other  public  agencies; \nand representatives of the private sector.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\nat an early stage. A detailed schedule outlining all preconstruction activities is in Supplementary \nAppendix  C.  The  schedule  is  supported  by  an  action  plan  with  target  dates  to  guide  the \nexecuting  agencies  in  sequencing  the  activities  and  monitoring  progress.  The  executing \nagencies have initiated advance actions for engaging consultants and civil works procurement. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n54. \nGoods  and  related  services  and  civil  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. All contracts for civil works and supply of equipment will be divided \ninto suitable contract packages (Appendix 11). The civil works contracts with an estimated value \nexceeding  $3  million  will  be  awarded  following  international  competitive  bidding  procedures. \nCivil work contracts valued at $3 million or less will follow local competitive bidding procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB.  For  equipment  contracts  in  excess  of  $500,000,  international  competitive \nbidding  procedures  will  be  followed;  for  contracts  ranging  from  $100,000  to  $500,000, \ninternational shopping procedures will be used; and for contracts valued at less than $100,000 \ndirect purchase procedures will be followed.  \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\ntechnical  expertise \n\nto  assist  and  provide \n\n55. \nConsulting  services,  both  international  and  domestic,  will  be  required  to  assist  the \nexecuting  agencies  implement  the  Project.  FHA  will  engage  an  international  consultant  in \nassociation  with  domestic  consultant(s) \nin \nimplementing  the  policy  reform  and  institutional  strengthening  component,  including  capacity \nbuilding.  In  addition,  the  consultant  will  help  FHA  and  WSD  implement  the  road  policy  matrix \nand  action  plan,  and  coordinate  and  manage  project  implementation.  The  scope  includes \nsupport and capacity building in project management; road maintenance; development of a road \nasset management system; environmental and social aspects of road development; and support \nservices to the Project Management Unit, including preparation of subproject proposals for rural \naccess roads in a format acceptable to ADB, benefit monitoring and evaluation, and road safety. \nThe  consultants  will  also  help  the  executing  agencies  monitor  and  verify  compliance  with \nresettlement  action  plans  and  environment  management  plans.  The  estimated  inputs  are  64 \nperson-months of international and 180 person\u2013months of domestic consulting.  \n \n56. \nUnder the provincial road improvement component: (i) FHA will engage an international \nconsulting  firm  in  association  with  domestic  consultant(s)  for  design  and  construction \nsupervision of the provincial highways; and (ii) WSD will engage two domestic consulting firms \nfor design and construction supervision of the rural access roads. The estimated staffing inputs \nare 63 person-months of international and 2,990 person-months of domestic consulting. Under \nthe subregional connectivity improvement component, NHA will engage an international firm in \nassociation  with  domestic  consultant(s)  for  design  and  construction  of  the  national  highways. \nThe  estimated  inputs  are  74  person-months  of  international  and  1,336  person-months  of \ndomestic  consulting.  These  consultants  will  also  be  responsible  for  detailed  engineering  and \nconstruction  supervision  of  the  cross-border  facilities  at  Torkham  and  Ghulam  Khan.  For  the \nroad safety component, MOC will engage international consultant (about 12 person-months) in \nassociation  with  domestic  consultant  (about  67  person-months).  For  consulting  services \ninvolving  design  and  contract  administration,  the  Project  will  provide  furnished  office  facilities, \nutilities, vehicles, and equipment required by the consultant. For construction supervision, field \noffices, material-testing laboratories with utilities and vehicles required by supervision staff will \nbe provided through the construction contracts, as appropriate.  \n\n\f 16\n\nAll consultants financed under the loan will be selected and engaged using ADB\u2019s quality \n57. \nand  cost-based  selection  procedures  for  recruiting  firms  under  full  technical  proposals  and \nADB\u2019s procedures for recruiting individual consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. Summary terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n\n \n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nLoan  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n58. \n(January  2001),  and  Interim  Guidelines  for  Disbursement  Operations,  LIBOR-Based  Loan \nProduct  (July  2002).  For  civil  works,  and  procurement  of  equipment  and  consulting  services \nrequiring  international  competitive  bidding,  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  using  direct  payment \nand reimbursement procedures. For civil works using local competitive bidding procedures and \nexecuting  agencies\u2019  incremental  expenditures,  reimbursement  procedures  will  be  through  the \nimprest account. MOC, NHA, and WSD  will  each  operate  imprest  accounts  established  in  the \nNational Bank of Pakistan. The combined initial advance to the imprest account will not exceed \nthe estimated expenditures for 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. Based \nupon assessment of their capacity, FHA and the districts will operate second generation imprest \naccounts  established  in  the  National  Bank  of  Pakistan  with  an  initial  advance  not  to  exceed  6 \nmonths expenditure and not to exceed WSD\u2019s share of imprest funds. WSD will be responsible \nfor  monitoring  the  FHA  and  districts  imprest  accounts,  including  monthly  reconciliation  of \naccounts  and  preparation  of  withdrawal  applications  for  liquidation/replenishment  of  accounts. \nStatement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be  used  for  individual  payments  not  exceeding \n$100,000. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n59.  MOC, NHA, and WSD will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify \nthe  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  the  expenditures  incurred  for  the \nProject and the subprojects, and use of local funds. These project accounts and related financial \nstatements will be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by the Auditor \nGeneral or independent private auditors acceptable to ADB. In addition, the audit should include \na separate opinion on the use of imprest accounts with the statement of expenditure procedure. \nThe  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  within  9  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year \nconsolidated annual audited reports and related financial statements of the Project. The director \ngeneral of audits will coordinate all account activities and ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s audit \nand accounting requirements. ADB will review and follow up on these matters as necessary.   \n \n60. \nFor  transparency  and  objective  and  independent  assessment,  all  procurement  and \ndisbursement-related  activities  will  be  subject  to  independent  performance  audits.  Loan-\nfinanced consulting services engaged through international competitive bidding procedures will \nconduct the performance audit biannually. ADB will also conduct project procurement audits as \npart of its regular loan reviews. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n61.  MOC,  NHA  and  WSD,  with  the  assistance  of  the  Project  Management  Unit  and  policy \nand institutional development consultant, will each establish a project performance management \nsystem by conducting surveys for baseline data of traffic, and socioeconomic and other relevant \nparameters  for  the  project  roads.  The  system  will  be  developed  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProject  Performance  Management  Systems  Handbook.  Baseline  surveys  will  be  followed  by \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\n9. \n\nProject Reviews \n\nregular  annual  surveys.  The  findings  and  supporting  data  will  be  incorporated  in  the  project \ncompletion report. The data on implementation status will help with project monitoring as well as \nearly  identification  of  potential  problems.  Performance  indicators  will  be  based  on  the  project \nframework to identify attainment of the development objectives. \n \n \n \n62. \nIn  addition  to  regular  reviews  by  ADB  staff  at  least  annually,  the  Project  will  have  a \ndetailed midterm review. The review will identify any problems or weaknesses in implementation \narrangements,  and  agree  on  any  changes  needed  to  achieve  the  Project\u2019s  objectives.  The \nreview  will  also  address  any  procurement,  financing,  and  scheduling  problems.  The  midterm \nreview will be carried out by the end of the second year of implementation (last quarter of 2006). \nTwo  months  before  the  review,  the  executing  agencies  (MOC,  NHA  and  WSD)  will  submit  to \nADB  a  detailed  status  report  on  project  implementation.  Terms  of  reference  for  the  midterm \nreview  will  be  included  in  the  project  administration  memorandum  to  be  prepared  by  ADB\u2019s \ninception mission for the Project.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nA. \n \n63. \nThe  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Economic \nAnalysis  of  Projects  and  using  the  highway  development  and  management  (HDM4)  software. \nThe  principal  quantifiable  benefits  from  the  Project  are  savings  on  vehicle  operating  costs, \nincluding  time-savings  for  existing  and  generated  traffic.  The  economic  analysis  of  the  project \nroads (Appendix 12) shows that the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for all project roads \nexceeds  12%.  The  EIRR  of  the  national  highways  ranges  from  17%  to  33%;  the  provincial \nhighways  from  18%  to  29%,  and  the  five  core  rural  access  roads  from  16%  to  30%.  The \nsensitivity analysis indicates that the EIRRs for all evaluated roads are quite robust for a 20% \nincrease in capital cost, 20% decrease in benefits, delays in implementation and 5% reduction \nin  growth  rate.  Benefits  will  also  arise  from  improved  access  to  markets,  which  will  boost \nagricultural  economic  activities;  reduced  agricultural  input  costs  because  of  better  transport \nfacilities; improved access to health, education, and other social sector facilities; and increased \nsubregional  benefits  arising  from  improved  trade  facilitation  and  reduced  delays  at  border \ncrossings. The extent of these impacts has not been quantified in the analysis.  \n \nB. \n\nSocial Impact \n \n1. \n\nPoverty and Socioeconomic Impact \n\n \nNWFP  is  the  poorest  of  the  country\u2019s  four  provinces  with  a  poverty  incidence  of  44% \n64. \ncompared  with  the  country\u2019s  33%.  Much  of  the  poverty  reduction  impacts  have  occurred  in \nurban areas, but urban poverty at 31% and rural poverty at 47% remain higher than the national \naverage.  Poverty  in  the  project  areas  is  associated  with  larger  household  sizes,  lack  of  basic \nservices,  asset  ownership,  and  low  education  and  literacy  status.  A  vast  majority  (51%)  of \ncommunities  living  adjacent  to  the  project  roads  can  be  classified  as  poor  with  an  average \nhousehold  size  of  over  9.  Within  the  project  influence  area,  most  people  (89%)  derive  their \nlivelihoods  from  nonagricultural  work,  with  49%  living  in  katcha  houses  and  lacking  access  to \nsafe drinking water and proper sanitation facilities. Villages either have no basic road links to the \nmain  roads  or  the  existing  roads  are  in  poor  condition  and  mostly  inaccessible  for  transport \nservices. Household survey results reveal that 40% of villagers have to travel 6\u201310 km to reach \n\n\f 18\n\na basic health unit. The literacy levels are low at 37%; and female children have less access to \neducation, health care, and nutrition. The socioeconomic survey of the candidate roads reveals \nthat on average 70% of households in the affected area have a per capita income of less than \nPRs750 per month\u2014the official poverty level (footnote 1). The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 13. A detailed poverty and social assessment is in Supplementary \nAppendix E. \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Impact Ratio \n\n65. \nThe Project will reduce poverty by lowering the transport costs for the poor traveling to \nagricultural  and  labor  markets,  health  and  education  centers,  and  other  social  and  public \nservices.  According  to  the  poverty  assessment,  the  Project  will  have  a  significant  effect  on \npoverty reduction, directly benefiting approximately 1,000,000 people in up to 24 districts living \nadjacent to the roads and some 500,000 other road users. Of these, an estimated 900,000 are \npoor people who will be direct beneficiaries. Other people will benefit from lower transport costs \nand induced economic and social development. The estimated poverty impact ratios of the core \nroads range from 26% to over 100% of the net economic benefits accruing to the poor for the \nProject  as  a  whole,  with  most  roads  between  30%  and  50%  (Appendix  12).  The  Project  will \ngenerate  significant  employment  opportunities  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  during  its \nimplementation phase. Unskilled laborers (males and females) will be employed directly in road \nconstruction  and  maintenance,  and  indirectly  by  providing  materials  and  services  for  the \nconstruction  and  maintenance  activities.  The  Project  will  generate  approximately  820,000 \nperson-months  of  unskilled  labor  employment  opportunities.  The  Project  will  have  positive \nexternalities, which will improve the livelihood of the poor.  \n \n\n3. \n\nGender \n\n \n66. \nThe prevalent gender role ideologies define women\u2019s roles as being primarily within the \nhome  as  mothers  and  wives,  and  men\u2019s  roles  as  the  breadwinner  and  decision-maker.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s  Development  has  been  making  efforts  to  support  gender \nthrough a Gender Policy announced in 2002. The policy aims to support the development and \nempowerment  of  women  by  improving  socioeconomic  indicators,  developing  skills,  increasing \nemployment opportunities, and supporting microcredit facilities. Despite fairly profound changes \nin the status of women over the past decades, significant gender gaps in education and health \npersist. Female literacy is 37% compared with 62% for men,30 and women make up only 28.9% \nof  university  students.  The  low  health  status  of  women  is  the  result  of  women's  lower  social, \neconomic,  and  cultural  standing.  Social  and  familial  control  over  women,  their  economic \ndependence on men, and restrictions on their mobility determine differential access of males and \nfemales  to  health  services.  The  rigid  gender  roles  and  restrictions  on  women\u2019s  mobility  and \noccupational segregation have resulted in extremely low women\u2019s labor force participation rates \nat  14.4%  compared  with  70.3%  for  men  (footnote  33).  As  a  result,  women\u2019s  use  of  the  road \nnetwork is significantly less than men\u2019s. The Project will provide benefits to women as a result of \nreduced  road  user  costs  in  the  form  of  lower  fares  and  charges  as  for  other  users.  It  will \nfacilitate the empowerment of women through the influence of outside ideas and approaches as \nconnectivity with the rest of the country and regions improves. However, gender issues cannot \nbe addressed in a road project in totality. The complementary JFPR project (para. 42) includes \nmeasures that will encourage efforts to raise women out of poverty.  \n \n\n                                                \n30 Bureau of Statistics. 2003: Pakistan Labor Force Survey (2001\u20132002). Islamabad. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\n4. \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n\n \n67. \nThe  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  indicates  that  indigenous  people  or  ethnic \nminorities  will  not  be  adversely  affected  by  the  Project.  Hence,  an  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment plan is not required. The Project will have a positive impact on the lives of ethnic \npopulation groups, who have distinct customs and economic lives, but are well represented at \nthe  national  and  provincial  public  representation  institutions  and  actively  participate  in \nmainstream economic, political, and social life of the province and country.  \n \n\n5. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n68. \nThe  Project  was  designed  to  minimize  the  need  for  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement. A full census was conducted of all the people, land, and structures/assets on the \nright-of-way  for  all  national  and  provincial  highways  and  the  five  core  rural  access  roads.  The \nProject  will  require  acquisition  of  approximately  466  hectares  of  land,  and  will  affect  940 \nhouseholds (about 13,590 people). The estimated cost for land acquisition and resettlement is \nabout $18.1 million, of which $16.7 million is for the national highways and $1.4 million for the \nprovincial roads. Accordingly two separate resettlement plans have been prepared for NHA and \nWSD-FHA.  These  have  been  translated  into  local  languages  and  disclosed  to  the  people \naffected.  A  combined  resettlement  plan  summarizing  both  NHA  and  provincial  resettlement \nplans  is  attached  as  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  The  complete  resettlement  plans  will  be \npublicly available at NHA, WSD-FHA,  ADB's  Pakistan  Resident  Mission,  and  on  the  NHA  and \nADB websites. A resettlement framework (Supplementary Appendix G) will be applicable for all \nrural  access  road  subprojects  approved  during  implementation.  Resettlement  plans  for  each \nremaining  subprojects  will  be  prepared  and  approved  by  NPG,  and  submitted  to  ADB  for \napproval. \n\n \n6. \n\nHIV/AIDS31 \n\n \n69. \nAccording  to  the  World  Health  Organization  and  Joint  United  Nations  Program  on \nHIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), Pakistan has a low prevalence but is a high-risk country for the spread of \nHIV  infection.  In  1999-2000  the  Government  with  the  assistance  of  UNAIDS  and  other \ndevelopment  partners  undertook  a  strategic  planning  exercise  with  input  from  stakeholders. \nUnder the strategic framework that resulted, the HIV/AIDS Prevention Project uses a multisector \nresponse to decrease the vulnerability of Pakistan\u2019s population. Included in this project is a 5-\nyear  service  package  for  long  distance  truckers  and  associated  population  that  includes \nawareness  raising.  Under  the  Project,  NHA  and  WSD  will  develop  linkages  with  the  National \nAIDS  Control  Programme,  and  in  particular  work  with  truckers  to  ensure  cooperation  and \nsupport for the HIV/AIDS Prevention Project along national highways in NWFP. This linkage will \nnot only encourage awareness-raising of HIV/AIDS issues, but will ensure that implementation \nof the service package for truckers fits in appropriately with road construction timing in NWFP. \n \nC. \n \nIn  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  2003  and  Pakistan \n70. \nEnvironmental Assessment Regulation 2000, the Project as a whole is categorized as \u201cA.\u201d More \nspecifically,  (i)  the  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  310  km  national  highways  including  the \nproposed  realignment  of  the  Peshawar-Torkham  road  section  is  categorized  as  an  A  project, \nand (ii) the improvement and rehabilitation of the provincial highways and rural access roads are \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Measures \n\n                                                \n31 human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n\f 20\n\ncategorized  as  a  B  project.  Both  the  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)32  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.  A \nsummary EIA including key elements of both the EIA and IEE was circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors and disclosed to the public more than 120 days prior to the Board\u2019s consideration of \nthe Project.  \n \n71. \nThe  findings  of  EIA  and  IEE  confirm  that  none  of  the  Project  roads  are  located  in  or \naffect any designated protected area, and no environmentally and ecologically sensitive areas \nare involved under the Project. The environmental impacts associated with the rehabilitation and \nimprovement  of  the  Project  roads  will  occur  only  during  construction.  However,  these  impacts \nare  manageable  and  appropriate  mitigation  measures  will  be  incorporated  into  project  design \nand construction works. If the rural access roads selected during implementation provide access \nto environmentally sensitive areas leading to potentially negative impacts such as poaching and \nlogging,  the  IEE  proposes  that  the  forest  and  wildlife  departments  be  part  of  the  monitoring \nprocess under the environmental management and monitoring plan. The cost for mitigation and \nimplementation  of  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  for  the  national \nhighways  is  PRs1,873  million,  of  which  PRs1,798  million  is  included  in  the  construction  costs \nand  a  separate  allocation  of  PRs75  million  is  provided  under  the  Project.  For  the  provincial \nhighways  and  rural  access  roads,  the  cost  for  mitigation  measures  and  the  environmental \nmanagement  and  monitoring  plan  is  PRs58  million,  of  which  PRs31  million  is  provided  under \nconstruction  and  consulting  services  costs  and  the  remaining  PRs27  million  is  covered  under \nthe incremental cost.   \n \n72. \nNHA  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  environmental  management  and \nmonitoring plan for national highways,33 FHA for the provincial highways, and WSD for the rural \naccess  roads.  These  agencies  will  work  closely  with  the  federal  and  provincial  environmental \nprotection agencies, other relevant government agencies, and local communities to ensure that \nthe environmental impacts of the Project are mitigated and monitored. \n \nD. \n\nProject Risks \n\n73. \nInordinate  delays  in  project  start-up  activities  such  as  engagement  of  consultants  and \nprocurement for civil works including timely approvals by NHA and NPG are a potential risk. In \nconsultation  and  agreement  with  NHA  and  WSD-FHA  as  part  of  advance  actions,  a  detailed \nplan of preconstruction activities has been prepared.  \n \nFailure  of  the  Government\u2019s  devolution  program  to  provide  sufficient  resources  for \n74. \nmaintenance will have an adverse impact on the provincial infrastructure (including roads) that \nhas  been  devolved  to  the  districts.  NPG  has  given  assurance  that  adequate  resources  will  be \nprovided  to  maintain  the  transferred  road  assets  once  the  districts\u2019  capacity  is  improved.  In \naddition, the Project addresses this issue by (i) allowing maintenance to be undertaken by the \nconstruction  contractor  for  up  to  10  years  for  project-financed  roads,  (ii)  engaging  rural \ncommunities to undertake routine maintenance, and (iii) building capacity of district staff in road \nasset management.   \n \n\n                                                \n32  Two  environmental  reports  are  prepared  due  to  different  executing  agencies  for  the  national  highways  and \n\nprovincial roads.  \n\n33  The  World  Bank  is  financing  long-term  development  of  NHA\u2019s  environmental  capacity  through  its  Highway \n\nRehabilitation Project, approved in November 2003. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21\n\nThe  risks  for  failure  or  slowdown  in  policy  and  institutional  reforms  in  NPG  are \n75. \nconsidered  manageable,  as  project  consultants  will  commit  and  support  NPG  and  WSD  in \nintroducing the reform measures and building capacity. \n \nThe new cross-border access to Afghanistan is located in an area where security is an \n76. \nissue. While the present conditions indicate an escalated security environment, the Government \nis closely monitoring the situation and has given assurance that this is a temporary phase and \nthat the security level will return to normal by the time the project activities commence. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n \nA. \n \n77. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \nResettlement. NHA and NPG will implement land acquisition and resettlement activities \n78. \nin  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government  and  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement as set forth in the agreed resettlement plans (NHA \nfor  national  highways,  and  WSD  for  provincial  highways  and  core  rural  access  roads)  and \nresettlement framework (WSD for noncore rural access roads). \n \n79. \nEnvironment.  NHA  and  WSD  will  ensure  that  all  environmental  mitigation  measures \nidentified  in  the  environmental  impact  assessment  report  for  the  national  highway  and  initial \nenvironmental  examination  report  for  the  provincial  highway  and  rural  access  roads  are \nincorporated into the project design and implemented during project construction and operation \nand maintenance, in accordance with the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines as \nset forth in  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines (2003) and the environmental management \nand monitoring plan agreed to with ADB. \n \n80. \nAnticorruption.  MOC,  NHA  and  NPG  acknowledge  that  ADB,  consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  reserves  the  right  to \nundertake directly, or through its agents, investigation of any possible financial or management \nimpropriety in the conduct of the Project. MOC, NHA, NPG, and WSD will fully cooperate with \nany  such  investigation  and  extend  all  necessary  assistance,  including  access  to  all  relevant \nbooks  and  records,  as  well  as  engagement  of  independent  experts  who  may  be  needed  for \nsatisfactory  completion  of  such  investigations.  All  costs  related  to  such  investigations  will  be \nborne by the Project.   \n \n81. \nLabor Laws. NHA and WSD will ensure that the civil works contractors comply with all \napplicable  labor  laws  and  regulations,  and  do  not  employ  child  labor  in  the  construction \nactivities.  NHA  and  WSD  will  provide  equal  opportunities  for  women  in  road  construction \nactivities, as well as require contractors to not differentiate wages between men and women for \nwork  of  equal  value.  A  reputable  non-government  organization  may  be  appointed  to \nindependently monitor and report on such matters. \n \n82. \nHealth Risks and Provisions. NHA and WSD will ensure that the civil works contracts \ninclude  a  requirement  to  conduct  an  information  and  education  campaign  on  sexually \ntransmitted and other communicable diseases for construction workers as part of the health and \nsafety program at campsites during the construction period. NHA and WSD will ensure that the \ncivil  works  contracts  include  provisions  on  health;  accidental  death;  dismemberment  and \n\n\f 22\n\ndisability benefits; safety and security; sanitation; and appropriate working conditions, including \naccommodation,  and  safe  drinking  water  for  construction  workers  at  campsites  at  standards \nacceptable to ADB during the construction period. \n \nIllegal Trafficking of Women, Children, and Goods. The Government will ensure that \n83. \nNHA  and  WSD  enact  measures,  satisfactory  to  ADB,  to  prevent,  monitor,  detect,  and  arrest \nillegal  trafficking  of  women  and  children,  and  illegal  movement  of  plants,  wildlife,  contraband, \nand other prohibited goods.  \n \n84. \nGrievance and Redress Mechanism. NHA and WSD will form within 3 months of the \ndate  of  loan  effectiveness  an  independent  committee  comprising  individuals  unrelated  to  the \nProject to hear any grievances or other complaints relating to resettlement or any other issues. \nThe  formation  of  the  committee  will  be  announced  through  the  public  media,  including \nannouncements in all major local language newspapers. The committee will be required to hold \na public hearing of any such grievances or complaints filed with it.  \n \nInstitutional  Strengthening.  Each  of  NPG  and  WSD-FHA  will  undertake  a \n85. \ncomprehensive  capacity-building  program  including  training  and  advisory  services  to  enhance \nthe  managerial,  technical,  road  maintenance,  and  monitoring  capacities  of  district  staff \nresponsible for project implementation and maintenance of district road networks. FHA will also \nestablish a road safety, environment, and social assessment cell to address issues relating to \nroad safety, environmental impacts, and social assessment. \n \n86. \nRoad  Maintenance.  NHA  and  NPG  will  each  prepare  and  implement  appropriate  road \nmaintenance  procedures  and  annual  maintenance  plans  for  the  roads  improved  under  the \nProject.  NHA  and  NPG  will  each  implement  axle-load  controls  on  the  improved  roads.  To \nmaintain  the  network  of  road  assets  transferred  to  the  districts,  NPG  will  provide  (i)  PRs150 \nmillion  annually  to  the  districts  to  prevent  deterioration  of  the  network,  and  (ii)  PRs500  million \nannually for 5 years to bring the network to maintainable condition.  \n \n87. \nProject  Management.  MOC,  NHA  and  WSD  will  each  select  project  directors  on  the \nbasis  of  open  competition,  and  recruit  candidates  as  project  directors  who  demonstrate  the \nhighest  technical  and  organizational  competence.  In  the  interest  of  providing  continuity  for \nproject management, each project director will serve in the position appointed for a minimum of \n3  years  from  the  date  of  appointment.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary,  any  project \ndirector  may  be  removed  in  case  of  gross  dereliction  of  duties  or  such  other  serious  cause, \nprovided such a determination

\nA. \n \nRoads  are  the  predominant  mode  of  inland  transport  in  Pakistan,  carrying  more  than \n1. \n91% of passenger traffic and 96% of freight traffic. The average traffic growth rate is about 4.5% \nfor  passengers  and  10.5%  for  freight.  The  total  road  network  in  the  country  is  approximately \n250,000 kilometers (km), of which about 60% is paved. This percentage includes 8,600 km of \nnational highways and motorways representing the main transport corridors and providing inter-\nprovincial linkages and connections to neighboring countries; and about 95,000 km of provincial \nroads  providing  all-weather  access  to  the  economic  and  population  centers  in  the  four \nprovinces.  The  provincial  roads  are  generally  categorized  as  highways,  and  secondary  and \naccess  roads.  The  remaining  network  consists  of  mostly  paved  municipal  urban  roads,  and \nlargely  unpaved  tertiary  roads  providing  access  to  villages  and  remote  areas.  The  number  of \nregistered motor vehicles is 4.8 million and is growing at 8% annually. Road transport services \nare largely in the private sector and are subject to strong competition. \n \n2. \nWith responsibility for operation, maintenance, and development of the national highway \nsystem,  the  National  Highway  Authority  (NHA)  is  an  autonomous  agency  with  a  functional \nstructure  and  decentralized \nthrough  provincial  offices.  The  provincial \ncommunications  and  works  department  (CWD)  were  responsible  for  the  provincial  roads,  but \nwith the Government\u2019s devolution program, the bulk of the provincial network was transferred to \nthe  newly  established  district  governments.  The  rest  of  the  road  network  consisting  of  the \nprimary  provincial  arteries  was  handed  over  to  the  newly  formed  works  and  services \ndepartments that will manage and develop all public infrastructure projects such as roads and \nwater supply. The local governments in urban centers are responsible for municipal roads, and \nthe district governments for tertiary roads.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \n(1995\u20132000),  the  road  subsector  raised  PRs207  billion  in  revenues.  National  and  provincial \nhighway expenditures totaled PRs118 billion for that period. The balance of PRs89 billion (43%) \nwas  contributed  to  the  Government\u2019s  general  revenue.  In  FY2002/03,  the  economic  survey \nreported expenditure of PRs13.2 billion for the national highway network and PRs7.1 billion for \nthe remaining network. But expenditure on road maintenance was estimated to be only 30% of \nthe requirements. NHA\u2019s medium-term investment and maintenance plan (2002\u20132007) provides \nPRs127.2  billion  for  road  development  and  PRs63.9  billion  for  road  conservation.  The  plan \ninvolves prioritized highway investment and maintenance for economically viable projects, and \nimproving the balance between network development and conservation. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nRoad  Infrastructure  and  Maintenance.  Based  on  assessments  of  road  conditions, \nabout  half  of  the  national  highway  network  and  a  large  proportion  of  the  provincial  road \nnetworks  are  in  poor  condition.  Deterioration  levels  on  provincial  roads  are  relatively  severe \ncompared  with  those  on  national  highways.  The  Government  has  initiated  a  program  for \nrehabilitating  priority  highway  sections  with  assistance  from  the  World  Bank  and  the  Asian \n\nRoad Subsector Revenues and Expenditures \n\nRoad Subsector Issues \n\nThrough  a  combination  of  general  revenue  taxes  and  user  charges  over  5  years    \n\n\f28\n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  in  addition  to  Government  resources.1  For  the  provincial  highways \nand district roads, ADB is financing sequenced interventions in each province to rehabilitate and \nimprove  road  networks.  To  ensure  sustainability,  these  projects  also  support  policy  and \ninstitutional reforms and capacity building for the road agencies.          \n \n5. \nNHA  receives  Government  resources  that  are  supplemented  by  toll  revenues.  NHA\u2019s \nroad  maintenance  fund,  established  in  2000,  is  financed  through  toll  revenues  to  ensure  a \nstable and secure source of operation and maintenance funding. Annual revenues collected in \n2003  were  over  PRs3.6  billion.  As  toll  revenues  increase  every  year,  NHA  has  sufficient \nresources  to  maintain  the  network.  The  provincial  and  district  maintenance  resources  are \ndiscussed in paras. 12 and 13.   \n  \nVehicle Overloading.  Vehicle  overloading  is  a  major  cause  of  premature  deterioration \n6. \nof  roads  in  Pakistan.  Damage  to  the  pavement  caused  by  overloaded  vehicles  increases \nexponentially  following  the  fourth  power  law.  Thus,  if  axle  load  is  doubled,  damage  to  the \npavement will be 16 times. A study by the National Transport Research Center2 has shown that \nover 43% of vehicles exceed the legal axle-load limit mandated by the Road Safety Act of 2000. \nTwo-axle  trucks  contribute  most  to  overloading,  which  is  increasing  at  about  2.6%  annually. \nAlthough  the  proportion  of  two-axle  trucks  now  shows  a  downward  trend,  they  still  represent \nover 50% of the truck traffic on the roads. To prevent damage to the road pavement, overloaded \nvehicles need to be monitored and axle load control enforced by weigh stations using static and \nweigh-in-motion measuring devices. NHA is implementing a nationwide axle-load program.3 \n \n7. \nRoad Safety. Traffic accidents and deaths along national highways in Pakistan \u2013 more \nthan  10,000  fatalities  per  year  (averaging  more  than  30  per  10,000  vehicles)  and  150,000 \ninjuries  \u2013  are  high  compared  with  those  on  similar  roads  in  Asian  countries.4  The  number  of \ntraffic accidents and deaths has been growing in recent years with the increase in the number of \nvehicles  on  the  roads.  The  improvement  of  major  national  highways  also  contributes  to  the \nnumber  of  traffic  accidents  and  deaths  due  to  overspeeding,  with  50%  of  these  accidents \noccurring  along  the  national  highways.  Without  road  safety  initiatives,  the  accidents  are \nexpected  to  increase.  Economic  losses  are  estimated  at  more  than  2%  of  the  national  gross \ndomestic product.5 There is no centralized data collection and analysis on traffic accidents and \ndeaths at the provincial level in Pakistan.  \n \n8. \nTo  date,  road  safety  initiatives  have  been  confined  to  the  motorways  and  national \nhighways. Preliminary information from initiatives taken by the National Highway and Motorway \nPolice  (NHMP)  shows  that  enforcement  coupled  with  engineering  improvements  and  vehicle \nmonitoring  has  significantly  reduced  traffic  accidents  and  deaths.  NHMP  has  successfully \ninstalled  systems  to  improve  road  safety  along  the  motorways  (412  km)  and  national  highway  \nN-5  (1,760  km)  in  phases.  NHMP  services  along  the  motorways  include  ambulances  with \nparamedics,  mobile  workshops  with  mechanics,  emergency  telephones  along  the  road,  and \nbriefing  to  commuters  at  entry  points  of  motorways.  They  use  modern  traffic  enforcement  and \n                                                \n1   Rehabilitation  of  national  highway  N-5  is  financed  with  World  Bank  assistance,  and  N-25  and  N-55  with  Asian \n\nDevelopment Bank\u2019s assistance.  \n\n2   National Transport Research Center. 1994.

A survey under this project in 1998, along 1,200 \nkm of national highways in NWFP, counted over 450 fatal accidents per year, amounting to 0.36 accident per year \nper km. About 65 black spots, with more than 3 accidents per year, were registered. \n\n5   ADB estimates, 2004. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29\n\nNorth-West Frontier Province \n\nemergency relief equipment such as laser guns, video radar, video cameras, rescue vans, and \nemergency signboards. Through effective training and proactive organizational reforms, NHMP \nhas been able to achieve a highly motivated and dedicated team of officers at each patrol post, \ncommanded by a chief patrol officer. The officers register violations without actually disturbing \ntraffic as the documents and fines are not collected at the site. The successful performance of \nNHMP has been recognized and the plan is to expand its operations to cover the entire national \nhighway network.  \n \nPrivate Sector Participation. A large investment in infrastructure, particularly roads, is \n9. \nneeded to maintain and enhance economic growth, which is necessary for reducing poverty and \nunemployment. The existing resource base is inadequate to meet the road development needs, \nand  investment  from  the  private  sector  is  necessary  to  fill  the  resource  gap.  Although  several \ninitiatives,  mostly  at  the  national  level,  were  taken  to  attract  private  sector  investments  in  the \nroad  sector,  none  were  successful  primarily  because  of  lack  of  (i)  an  enunciated  policy  on \nprivate  sector  participation,  (ii)  appropriate \ninstitutional  structures  and  processes,  (iii) \nestablished  systems  and  procedures,  and  (iv)  capable  staff.  The  capacity  to  promote \ninfrastructure  projects  is  limited.  In  addition,  lack  of  financial  expertise  leads  to  difficulties  in \npackaging  projects  that  could  be  successfully  offered  for  private  sector  financing.  ADB  is \nproviding  technical  assistance  for  preparing  a  public-private  infrastructure  financing  facility6  to \nhelp design appropriate mechanisms for accelerating infrastructure development by increasing \nprivate sector participation in Pakistan.   \n \nD. \n \nRoad Network and Connectivity. At 74,500 square km, North-West Frontier Province \n10. \n(NWFP)  is  the  smallest  of  the  four  provinces.  The  landscape  features  high  mountains  in  the \nnorth, strips of plains and plateau in the center, and plains in the south. The population of the \nprovince  is  17.7  million.7  The  province\u2019s  road  network8  consists  of  about  9,100  km,  of  which \nabout  5,000  km  are  paved  (Table  A2.1).  Lack  of  connectivity9  in  the  rural  areas  of  NWFP \nparticularly affects the poor. Though the network coverage is better than that in Balochistan and \nSindh,  only  41%  of  the  rural  communities  have  paved  access  and  27%  still  lack  basic  motor-\nvehicle access. NWFP lags behind the other provinces in availability of public transport, as only \n32% of communities are served by public transport compared with the national average of 48%.  \n \n11. \nImpact  of  Devolution.  To  improve  delivery  of  social  and  other  infrastructure  at  the \ngrassroots level, the Government embarked on a major decentralization effort in 2001. As part \nof  the    devolution  program,  CWD  of  the  NWFP  government,  which  was  responsible  for  the \nprovincial  road  network,  transferred  responsibility  for  over  7,000  km  to  the  24  newly  formed \ndistrict  governments  along  with  a  major  portion  of  its  staff.  The  provincial  CWD  was  then \ncombined  with  the  public  health  engineering  department  to  form  the  Works  and  Services \nDepartment.  To  look  after  the  maintenance  and  development  of  the  core  provincial  highway \nnetwork of about 2,100 km, the Frontier Highway Authority (FHA) was established in 2001. \n \n12. \nResources  for  Road  Development  and  Maintenance.  The  allocations  for  road \ndevelopment  in  NWFP  during  FY2001/02  to  FY2003/04  had  a  declining  trend  and  varied \nbetween  14%  and  8%  of  the  total  annual  development  program.  The  expenditures  on  road \n                                                \n6   ADB. 2003.

Islamabad. \n\n\f30\n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nmaintenance declined significantly from a maximum of PRs296 million in FY1995/96 to PRs32 \nmillion in FY1999/2000, against an estimated need of PRs500 million to maintain the network.  \n \nFHA receives an average of PRs730 million annually for development of the 2,100 km10 \n13. \nnetwork of provincial highways it manages. This is supplemented by about PRs130 million for \nmaintenance  that  FHA  generates  mainly  from  tolls.11  These  resources  are  adequate  for \nmaintaining  and  gradually  improving  the  network.  The  resources  for  the  24  districts  with  a \nnetwork of about 7,000 km were curtailed from PRs123 million to PRs30 million in 2002\u20132003. \nA  significant  proportion  of  the  network  is  in  poor  condition  primarily  due  to  a  shortage  of  road \nmaintenance  funds,12  but  also  due  to  lack  of  adequate  capacity  of  the  district  road  agencies. \nBased on road condition information provided by FHA and district governments, the backlog of \nmaintenance needs is approximately PRs2.5 billion; about PRs138 million is needed annually to \nsustain  the  network.13  Discussions  with  NPG  indicate  that  they  are  willing  to  provide  the \nrequired resources if the districts develop the capacity to utilize the funds properly. Hence, the \ndistricts\u2019  capacity  needs  to  be  developed  to  ensure  better  governance  and  enhanced \nsustainability of the road network. \n \n14. \nInstitutional  Capacity  and  Constraints.  The  new  district  governments  are  in  a \nformative stage and lack capacity as well as resources to manage the devolved road network. \nThough some staff from the former CWD were assigned to the district governments, their work \nis  adversely  affected  by  the  lack  of  institutional  mechanisms  and  operational  procedures. \nAdditionally, despite completion of physical devolution of the road assets, fiscal devolution is still \nin  a  transition  stage.  As  a  result,  the  district  governments  rely  on  federal  or  provincial \ngovernments  for  financial  resources.  The  current  transfer  of  resources  is  based  on  a  strict \nstructured formula  that  requires  the  majority  of  funds  to  be  used  in  the  social  sectors,  leaving \nvery few resources for infrastructure. Thus, a significant proportion of the district road network is \nin poor condition due to shortage of road maintenance funds and lack of capacity in the district \ngovernments. \n \n15. \nRoad  Safety.  Improving  road  safety  is  an  important  issue  in  NWFP.  The  situation  is \nexacerbated  because  of  weak  institutional  capacity,  lack  of  coordination  among  various \nagencies, and poor condition of roads. The Project will address policy issues by implementing \nthe provincial policy matrix and action plan designed to bring policy and institutional reforms to \nstrengthen  road  safety  efforts.  The  action  plan  will  set  an  overall  strategy  for  improving  road \nsafety in the province consistent with ongoing initiatives for the national highways. \n \nPrivate  Sector  Participation.  Opportunities  for  private  sector  participation  in  NWFP \n16. \nroad  infrastructure  projects  exist  as  the  level  of  traffic  on  some  corridors  is  high.  Private \ninvestors have approached provincial authorities about investing in road development, but lack \nof policies and of an enabling environment are major impediments. As part of policy reform and \nthe  institutional  strengthening  component,  assistance  will  be  provided  to  overcome  barriers  to \nprivate sector participation in road development in the province. In this context, lessons will be \n\n                                                \n10  However, the 480 km Nowshera-Chakdarra-Dir-Shandur road has been upgraded to a national highway and has \n\nbeen taken over by NHA. The FHA network has therefore been reduced to 1,620 km. \n\n11  Other major revenue sources include earnings from equipment rental, material testing, right-of-way rental charges, \n\nfees from roadside gas stations, and contractor\u2019s registration.  \n\n12  The  Nowshera  district  government  said  that  based  on  an  outdated  yardstick  (last  revised  in  1981),  they  need \nPRs17.6 million for maintenance of district roads. However, only PRs5 million was provided in FY2002/03 and in \nFY2003/04 this was drastically reduced to only PRs0.75 million.  \n\n13  An  independent  assessment  was  carried  out  under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  based  on  a \n\ndetailed condition/roughness survey of roads in Nowshera district. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n31\n\ndrawn  from  the  experience  in  Punjab  where  a  build-operate-transfer  project  for  road \ndevelopment is close to completion.  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Road Network of North-West Frontier Province \n\nDistrict \n \nAbbottabad \nBannu \nBattagram \nBuner \nCharsadda \nChitral \nD.I.

The  subproject  will  be  technically  feasible  and  a  detailed  report \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \n The  selection  of  subprojects  for  rural  access  roads  by  North-West  Frontier  Province \nProvincial  Government  (NPG)  will  be  subject  to  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approval.  The \nselection criteria for subprojects and the approval process are outlined here. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nPoverty  Targeting.  The  subproject  will  have  been  prioritized  based  on  the  district \ndevelopment  ranking  used  by  the  Government  to  determine  allocation  of  its  development \nexpenditures. Preference will be given to roads that improve access of poor communities to schools, \nhealth facilities, and markets. \n \n3. \nprepared. \n \n4. \nEconomic  Feasibility.  Economic  analysis  of  the  subproject  will  be  prepared  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Project and the estimated economic internal rate \nof return will be at least 12%. \n \n5. \nSocial Assessment and Analysis. The subproject will be socially sound, minimize the need \nfor  land  acquisition,  and  include  measures  to  mitigate  social  impacts,  if  any.  An  initial  social \nassessment for the subproject will have been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s relevant guidelines.  \n \nResettlement. The proposed subproject road should not involve involuntary resettlement or \n6. \nland acquisition, and should have minimal impact on any people affected by the land acquisition, or \ntheir  livelihood.  If  a  subproject  involves  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement,  a  full \nresettlement  plan  (if  the  number  of  people  affected  is  200  or  more)  or  short  resettlement  plan  (if \nfewer than 200 people are affected), acceptable to ADB will have been prepared in accordance with \nthe  resettlement  framework  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and  ADB  and  in  accordance  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on Involuntary Resettlement. \n \nIndigenous  People.  If  any  indigenous  people,  such  as  tribes  or  settlers,  as  per  ADB\u2019s \n7. \ndefinition, are likely to be affected significantly by a subproject, an indigenous people\u2019s plan should \nbe prepared in accordance with ADB's Policy on Indigenous People. \n \nEnvironmental Considerations. Each proposed subproject road will have been screened for \n8. \nits environmental impacts in compliance with the requirements of the Government and ADB,1 and will \nnot cause any major adverse impact on the environment. ADB will have received and reviewed the \ninitial environmental examination, if any, prepared for a proposed road. All necessary approvals and \nclearances  will  have  been  obtained  for  the  subproject  from  the  federal  and  provincial  governments \nand related agencies. \n \n9. \nCounterpart Funding. NPG will ensure that sufficient counterpart funding will be allocated to \nimplement  the  subproject  timely  and  efficiently  in  accordance  with  the  overall  implementation \nschedule. \n \n10. \nobtained.  \n \n\nGovernment  Approvals. For each subproject, all necessary NPG approvals will have been \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2003.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n37\n\nApproval Process for Subprojects  \n\nDistrict  Commitment.  As  appropriate,  the  relevant  NPG  district  will  have  confirmed,  in  a \n11. \nmanner acceptable to ADB, its commitment to the proposed subproject road, including the provision \nof budgetary allocations for road rehabilitation and operation and maintenance.  \n \nC. \n \n12. \nAll  subprojects  will  be  required  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  guidelines,  and  satisfy \nADB\u2019s procedures for subproject preparation with respect to technical, operational, economic, social, \nindigenous people, resettlement, and other requirements. NPG will ensure that sufficient counterpart \nfunding  will  be  available.  These  requirements  were  applied  for  the  six  core  subproject  provincial \nroads  during  project  preparation.  They  were  found  to  be  technically  feasible,  economically  viable, \nsocially responsible, and environmentally sound. For additional subprojects, the requirements will be \nmet during project implementation. \n \n13. \n During  the  early  stages  of  project  implementation,  the  Project  Management  Unit,  with \nassistance  of  the  institutional  and  management  consultants,  will  prepare  a  consolidated  report  for \none or more subprojects covering all the stipulated ADB requirements, which will be sent to ADB for \nreview and approval. Upon ADB\u2019s approval, the unit will proceed with further subproject preparation, \nprocurement, and subproject implementation.  \n \n\n \n\n\f38\n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF RURAL ACCESS ROADS \n\nSelection \n\nEligibility Criteria for Roads  \n\nAllocation of Roads to Districts \n\n  \nA. \n \nThe proposed criteria for allocation of roads to the districts is based on (i) connectivity \n1. \nrepresented by road density,1 (ii) population representing needs and economic activity, and (iii) \npoverty based on district ranking.2  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe Works and Services Department (WSD) will seek a list of priority roads from each \ndistrict.  The  roads  will  preferably  be  selected  from  the  2,745  kilometers  (km)  of  roads  initially \nproposed by the districts. The length of the roads proposed by each district will be at least twice \ntheir allocation. \n \n3. \nThe  WSD  will  forward  the  proposed  list  to  the  existing  chief  minister\u2019s  selection \ncommittee (CMSC)3 for selection of roads, according to their allocation, for inclusion under the \nProject. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe eligibility of each selected road will be assessed based on the criteria that include \ntechnical and economic feasibility, social assessment, resettlement requirements, consideration \nfor  indigenous  people,  environmental  aspects,  stakeholder  consultation,  and  availability  of \ncounterpart resources. \n \n5. \nThe project consultants under the WSD will prepare subproject proposals for each of the \nselected roads. The proposal will include all assessments required to meet the eligibility criteria.  \n \nD. \n \nThe WSD presents the subproject proposals to the project steering committee (PSC)4 for \n6. \nits review and to ensure that the selected roads meet  the  eligibility  criteria.  The  PSC  will  then \nendorse the roads for project financing. \n \nE. \n \n7. \nmembers of the CMSC and PSC. \n \n\nTo  ensure  direct  involvement  of  districts,  3\u20135  district  coordination  officers  will  be \n\nInvolvement of Districts in the CMSC and PSC \n\nEndorsement for Project Financing \n\n                                                \n1  During implementation the road density will be firmed up based on detailed information provided by the districts on \n\ntheir network and verification by WSD. \n\n2  North-West Frontier Province. 2001.

The economic analysis examined the expected contribution of the \nProject  to  NWFP  and  the  subregion.  A  project  approach  is  being  taken  for  national  and  provincial \nhighways and a sector approach is being adopted for the rural access roads. Four national highway \nsections and five provincial highways were selected along with five core rural access roads, to act as \na sample of rural access roads to be implemented under the Project. These roads were selected by \nthe  NWFP  provincial  government  (NPG)  with  assistance  from  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  consultants.  A  similar  analysis  will  be  undertaken  by  the  Executing  Agency  for  noncore \nroads to be selected for inclusion in later stages of the Project. NPG has prepared a candidate list of \nroads from which roads will be selected  \n \nA. \n\nMethodology and Key Assumptions \n\n2. \nThe  methodology  used  follows  Guidelines  for  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  The  highway  development  and  management  model,  HDM-4,  has  been \nused for the analysis. The analysis includes only direct savings in vehicle operating costs (VOC) and \ntravel  time  savings.  Value  added  from  better  transport  links  resulting  in  new  industries  was  not \nquantified. \n \nThe analysis considered with- and without-project scenarios. For most roads, the with-project \n3. \noption  follows  the  existing  alignment  and  only  treatment  alternatives  (triple  surface  treatment  or \nasphaltic  concrete)  were  considered.  In  the  case  of  Peshawar-Torkham  several  alignment  options, \ndifferent phasing of construction, and use of rail were considered. The with-project options described \nin this appendix are the most cost-effective options in each case. \n \nB. \n\nRoad Condition and Traffic \n\nThe  condition  of  existing  paved  roads,  in  terms  of  the  international  roughness  index,  ranges \n4. \nfrom 6.9 to 11.5 for national highways and from 5.7 to 13.6 for provincial highways. Immediately after \nreconstruction,  the  international  roughness  index  is  assumed  to  be  2.5  for  national  and  provincial \nhighways and 4.0 for rural roads. \n \n5. \nTraffic surveys were carried out on the core roads (Table A12.5). In the absence of historical \ntraffic count data for most roads, traffic growth rates were estimated based on national averages. The \ngrowth  rates  shown  in  Table  A12.1  were  tested  with  the  exceptions  of  the  Peshawar-Torkham  and \nBannu-Ghulan  Khan  roads.  The  optimistic  estimate  was  10%  for  passenger  and  12%  for  freight  as \nthese roads are expected to see rapid increases in cross-border traffic. By comparison, growth for the \nN-55  (the  only  NWFP  road  for  which  reports  were  available)  is  reported  to  be  7.5%  per  year,  with \nsome sections as high as 20%. \n \n\nTable A12.1: Traffic Growth Rates \n\nCategory \n \nCare, Jeep, Taxi \nMotorcycle \nWagon/Pickup \nBus \nTruck  \nMulti-Axle  \n\nConservative  \n(%) \n5.0 \n7.5 \n4.0 \n4.0 \n5.0 \n5.0 \n\nOptimistic \n(%) \n6.0 \n7.5 \n6.0 \n6.0 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n6. \nAdditional traffic is expected because of the VOC reductions with the road improvements. In \nthe  case  of  national  and  provincial  highways,  the  improvements  are  primarily  upgrading  existing \n\n\f50\n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nroads,  so  additional  traffic  will  be  relatively  small\u2014a  5%  increase  is  assumed  for  2007.  For  rural \naccess roads, the improvement is more significant, changing the nature of the road in most cases\u2014a \n10% traffic increase is assumed for 2006. The exceptions are the Peshawar-Torkham road, where the \nimprovement  will  have  a  significant  impact\u2014in  this  case  a  25%  increase  is  assumed  for  2007;  and \nBannu-Miram  Shah-Ghulam  Khan  where  although  some  international  traffic  is  using  the  route, \ndevelopment will open new opportunities\u2014a 200% increase in freight traffic was assumed, bringing it \nup to about 25% of the Torkham traffic level. While the cumulative effect of these assumptions on the \ntraffic forecast is large in percentage terms, both roads are starting from a low base. \n\nC. \n\nCosts \n\n7. \nVOC  depends  upon  road  conditions,  and  vehicle  characteristics,  utilization,  and  prices.  For \nvehicle  characteristics,  default  values  of  the  highway  development  and  management  model  have \nbeen  used.  Vehicle  prices  and  utilization  were  estimated  based  on  discussions  with  the  motor \nindustry. The tax component of vehicle and parts prices and fuel was deducted to give a border price \nequivalent value. \n \nRoad improvement costs were established for each road separately on the basis of estimated \n8. \nquantities  of  work  using  rates  for  each  district  from  the  composite  schedule  of  rates  (2000)  of  the \nNational Highway Authority. For the national highway sections, previous cost estimates were updated \nusing the same quantities, but using current national highway unit rates. The rates were converted to \nborder price equivalent values assuming that the net effect of taxes and controls, monopoly rents on \ndomestic  costs,  etc.,  is  15%.  This  is  the  value  used  in  previous  studies.  The  eventual  source  of \nmaterials and equipment is not known, making any better estimate difficult. \n \n9. \nMaintenance costs are based on the unit rates for various maintenance operations. The unit \nrate schedules are financial costs inclusive of taxes and duties that are transfer payments. Previous \nstudies  have  assumed  a  difference  between  financial  and  economic  costs  of  15%,  which  allows  for \ntax, monopoly rent, and a shadow price of labor below the nominal wage rate. The project duration is \nassumed to be 1 year for short roads (less than 50 km), and 2 years for long road sections with 50% \nof the works to be carried out in year 1 and 50% in year 2. \n\n \n\n \n\nD. \n\nBenefits \n\nThe main quantifiable benefits of the investment are (i) VOC savings for normal traffic; and (ii) \n10. \nVOC  savings  for  additional  traffic.  The  savings  in  VOC  are  generated  primarily  though  better  road \nsurface  conditions.  Improvements  in  alignment  and  gradient  also  play  a  part  particularly  for  the \nPeshawar-Torkham  road.  As  the  access  to  markets  improves,  economic  activities  are  expected  to \nincrease,  resulting  in  generated  traffic.  The  benefit  to  generated  traffic  is  based  on  an  estimate  of \nwillingness to pay imputed from the difference in the financial cost with and without the Project. New \nusers were not willing to pay the without-project cost but are willing to pay the with-project cost. The \nwillingness  to  pay  of  new  users  is  assumed  to  form  a  linear  distribution  between  these  extremes. \nAnother benefit is the savings in periodic maintenance costs for NPG. \n \nE. \n\nResults of the Economic Evaluation and Sensitivity Analysis \n \n1. \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\n \n11. \nThe  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  for  the  selected  roads  have  been  computed \nusing the highway development and management model-4. The EIRRs range from 17% to 33% for \nnational highways, 18% to 29% for provincial highways, and 16% to 30% for rural roads\u2014all above \n12%. The EIRRs are shown in the first column of Table A12.2. \n\n \n\n12. \nThe  sensitivity  of  the  EIRRs  to  changes  in  key  assumptions  has  been  tested  (Table  A12.2). \nThe analysis shows that the roads with the lowest EIRR are the most sensitive to changes in the key \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n51\n\nassumptions. Since the current traffic mix is known, sensitivity to changes in the mix was not tested. \nChanging the differential growth rate had only a minor impact. \n \n\nTable A12.2: Sensitivity Analysis \n\nRoad Section \n \n\nBase Case EIRR 20% VOC \n\nReduction  \n\n50% \nReduction \nin Value of \nTime \n\n20% \nIncrease  in \nCapital \nCost \n\nReduction \nin Growth \nto 5% \n\nOne-Year \nDelay in \nConstruct\nion \n\n20% Increase \nin Capital \nCost and \n20% VOC \nReduction  \n \n22.4 \n\nNational Highways  \nMalana Junction-\nSarai Gambila  \nBadabher-Darra \nAdam Khel,  \nPeshawar-Torkhum  \nSarai Gambila-\nGhulam Khan  \n \nProvincial Highways  \nCharsadda-Mardan \n(2x7.3) \nJehangira-Swabi \nOption-I \nRemaining Portion \nof Khushal Garh-\nKohat  \nKohat-Thall  \n\nTamirgarh-Munda  \n\n \n30.0 \n\n33.2 \n\n21.6 \n17.5 \n\n \n \n18.6 \n\n28.9 \n\n22.3 \n\n24.5 \n\n17.8 \n\n \n25.7 \n\n27.9 \n\n19.8 \n15.8 \n\n \n \n15.4 \n\n24.4 \n\n18.8 \n\n20.7 \n\n14.8 \n\n \n28.2 \n\n30.8 \n\n21.4 \n16.4 \n\n \n \n17.2 \n\n27.2 \n\n21.2 \n\n22.4 \n\n16.1 \n\n \n26.4 \n\n28.7 \n\n20.2 \n15.4 \n\n \n \n15.9 \n\n24.9 \n\n19.4 \n\n21.2 \n\n15.3 \n\n \n25.5 \n\n \n28.1 \n\n29.0 \n\n31.9 \n\n17.1 \n15.9 \n\n \n \n15.9 \n\n21.2 \n16.8 \n\n \n \n16.5 \n\n25.0 \n\n27.1 \n\n19.4 \n\n21.2 \n\n21.4 \n\n13.8 \n\n22.7 \n\n16.1 \n\n24.1 \n\n15.6 \n12.5 \n\n \n \n12.9 \n\n20.9 \n\n16.2 \n\n18.1 \n \n12.5 \n \n \n12.8 \n\n30.4 \n\n22.3 \n\n22.3 \n\n18.0 \n\n27.4 \n\n25.4 \n\n23.2 \n\n28.2 \n\n28.4 \n\n26.2 \n\n25.9 \n\n21.7 \n\n23.9 \n\n21.2 \n\n \n16.0 \n\n \n14.1 \n\n \n14.9 \n\n \n14.9 \n\n \n13.4 \n\n \n13.1 \n\n18.3 \n17.5 \n\n13.4 \n11.7 \n\n18.3 \n17.5 \n\n16.4 \n15.8 \n\n16.8 \n16.1 \n\n15.6 \n14.6 \n\n15.3 \n14.3 \n\nRural Roads  \nUmerzai-Harichand \nDargai  \nKarak-Sabirabad \nSarqala-Martung \n \nPatriak-Kalkot-Thall-\nBadgoi \nLahor-Baika-Jabbal-\nJehangira \nEIRR \u2013 economic internal rates of return; VOC \u2013 vehicle operating costs. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n13. \nFrom Table A12.2 shows that the results are most sensitive to the assumed VOC (and thus \nthe  savings  calculated  from  changes  in  these)  and  the  capital  costs.  A  reduction  in  VOC  of  28%  is \nrequired  before  one  of  the  core  roads  ceases  to  be  viable.  An  increase  in  capital  costs  of  30%  is \nrequired before one of the core roads ceases to be viable. Column five shows a combination of these \ntwo worst-case scenarios producing both a reduction in benefits and an increase in capital costs. \n \n14. \nA qualitative risk analysis was undertaken. Because the Project involves essentially marginal \nimprovements  to  existing  roads  using  standard  construction  techniques,  the  probability  of  the \nswitching values being exceeded was considered low. The component most liable to variation is the \ncapital cost. This risk has been reduced by taking a conservative approach to estimation of unit rates. \nThe input data with greatest uncertainty are the traffic growth rates. However most roads are viable \nwith  no  growth  at  all  or  even  a  decline  in  traffic.  The  exception  is  the  Sarai  Gambila-Ghulam  Khan \nroad. However once this is upgraded, it provides a much shorter route to the ports for the Kabul area \nof Afghanistan. As indicated in Table A12.3, reduction in the assumed growth rate to 3.5% is required \nbefore EIRRs for any of the rural or provincial roads drop below 12%. Project delays are considered \nvery  likely,  but  experience  with  past  projects  has  been  that  this  has  affected  the  start  date  of  the \n\n\f52\n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nproject  components,  not  the  duration  of  their  construction  (the  overall  construction  period  was \nextended, increasing supervision costs). \n \n\nTable A12.3: Switching Values  \n \n\n \n\nRoad \nNational Highways  \nMalana Jn-Sarai Gambila  \nBadabher-Darra \nPeshawar-Torkhum  \nSarai Gambila-Ghulam Khan  \nProvincial Highways  \nCharsadda-Mardan \nJehangira-Swabi \nKhushal Garh-Kohat \nKohat-Thall  \nTamirgarh-Munda  \nRural Roads  \nUmerzai Dargai \nKarak-Sabirabad  \nSarqala-Martung \nPatriak-Thall-Badgoi \nLahor-Baika-Jehangira \n\nIncrease in \nCosts \nSV (%) \n \n100 \n  94 \n  77 \n  36 \n \n  49 \n  85 \n  71 \n  78 \n  46 \n \n  31 \n  47 \n  38 \n  72 \n  82 \n\nDecrease \nin VOC  \nSV (%) \n \n84 \n80 \n64 \n32 \n \n41 \n75 \n59 \n69 \n39 \n \n28 \n42 \n34 \n64 \n88 \n\nTraffic \nGrowth \nSV (%) \n \n(7.0) \n2.7 \n(4.5) \n8.9 \n \n0.8 \n(4.6) \n(1.0) \n(2.8) \n3.5 \n \n(4.9) \n3.5 \n1.8 \n1.5 \n(4.3) \n\nSV = switching value, VOC =vehicle operating cost \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nDistribution Analysis \n\n15. \nThe  distribution  analysis  has  been  undertaken  following  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  for  Integrating \nPoverty Impact in Economic Analysis of Projects. All economic net benefits are distributed among the \nfollowing categories of stakeholders: (i) local passenger users, (ii) through travellers, (iii) freight users, \n(iv) vehicle owners, (v) skilled and unskilled labor, (vi) government/economy.  \n \n16. \nThe  distribution  analysis  was  undertaken  separately  for  each  road  and  summarized  for \nnational, provincial, and rural access roads. The total  net  benefits  are  about  PRs14  billion  (or  $240 \nmillion) in present value discounted at 12%. This does not include any estimate of the likely impact of \nthrough traffic between Afghanistan and the Central Asian republics and the Pakistan ports, which is \nlikely  to  lead  to  further  direct  and  indirect  benefits.  The  size  of  these  benefits  depends  on  how  the \nregional  and  national  economies  grow  over  the  Project\u2019s  time  horizon  and  the  competitiveness  of \nPakistan\u2019s ports and other infrastructure. Increasing the proportion of benefits going to through traffic \nwill reduce the poverty impact ratio of the Project as a whole, particularly as the resulting additional \nmaintenance cost falls on the province. \n\nF. \n\nPoverty Impact \n\n17. \nTo  undertake  the  poverty  impact  analysis,  a  household  survey  of  550  households  was \nundertaken in the villages alongside the candidate roads; it included a question on trip making. For \nthrough travellers, an additional roadside survey was undertaken. Although the data were captured by \nroad, they were aggregated to provide an overall figure of 40% of poor nonlocal travellers. The survey \ndata  were  used  to  estimate  the  proportion  of  trips  on  each  road  that  were  local  and  through. \nGovernment vehicles are assumed to receive 5% of the vehicle-owner benefits. \n \n18. \nThe calculated poverty impact ratio varies widely between roads and is very sensitive to the \nEIRR  of  the  individual  roads.  The  poverty  impact  ratio  values  range  from  37%  to  over  100%  for \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n53\n\nnational highways (overall 46%); from 36% to 60% for provincial highways (overall 46%), and 42% to \n80% for rural roads (overall 49%).  \n \n19. \nTable  A12.4  summarizes  the  analysis  of  the  individual  roads.  The  top  section  of  the  table \nshows  how  the  consumer  surplus  (the  difference  between  the  economic  and  financial  benefit)  is \ndistributed among stakeholders. A total of PRs20.9 billion savings to existing traffic and PRs2.0 billion \nbenefits to new traffic are distributed across local users, through traffic, freight users, vehicle owners, \nlabor,  and  the  economy.  Most  benefits  are  assumed  to  accrue  to  vehicle  owners.  Benefits  to  end \nusers are passed on in the form of lower fares or improved services. The extent this occurs depends \non  the  degree  of  competition\u2014assumed  to  be  higher  on  national  highways.  The  Government  is \nestimated  to  own  about  5%  of  the  vehicles.  Skilled  labor  loses  some  benefits  from  existing  traffic \nbecause vehicle maintenance is reduced, but gains from new users. Labor gains some of the PRs1.7 \nbillion producer surplus from construction and maintenance.  \n \n20. \nThe lower section of the table shows the proportion of the benefits that accrue to the poor. The \nproportion of stakeholders that are poor was estimated from household and roadside interviews, and \nvaries  between  roads.  All  unskilled  laborers  are  assumed  to  be  poor.  The  proportion  of  poor  in  the \neconomy at large was estimated from the poor\u2019s contribution to gross domestic product. The poverty \nimpact ratio is the ratio of the benefit to the poor to the overall net benefit. Overall, the poverty impact \nratio is 49%. \n \n\nTable A12.4 Distribution and Poverty Impact Analysis\u2014Summary \n \n\nOverall \n \n \nItem \n\nNet Benefits (PRs million) \n\n  National  Government \n  Economic  Financial\n\nPV \n\nPV \n\nDistribution Of Net Benefits (PRs million) \nLabor \n\nRoad Users \n\n \n\nLocal \nDifference  Users \n\nThrough   Freight \n\nTraffic \n\n \n\nVehicle \n \nOwners  Un-\n\nInflows \n \n Savings \n  New Trips \nOutflows \n \nInitial Capital  \n  Maintenance \nNet Benefits \nGains and Losses \nNet Benefits for the Poor \n \n\n20,883 \n2,039 \n \n(9,731) \n(277) \n12,914 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0 \n0 \n \n(11,434) \n(331) \n(11,765) \n\n \nPIR \n\n20,883 \n2,039 \n \n1,703 \n54 \n24,679 \n12,914 \n6,285 \n48.7% \n\n3,839 \n323 \n \n0 \n0 \n4,162 \n4,162 \n2,847 \n \n\n2,719 \n148 \n \n0 \n0 \n2,867 \n2,867 \n1,147 \n \n\n5,457 \n703 \n \n0 \n0 \n6,161 \n6,161 \n2,464 \n \n\n8,820 \n785 \n \n0 \n0 \n9,605 \n9,605 \n1,011 \n \n\n0 \n0 \n \n175 \n23 \n198 \n198 \n198 \n \n\nskilled \n \n\n \n\n \nGovt/ \nEco-\nnomy \n \n\n464 \n41 \n \n1,450 \n24 \n1,980 \n(9,785) \n(1,323) \n \n\n \nSkill\n-ed \n\n \n\n(416) \n39 \n \n78 \n7 \n(293) \n(293) \n(59) \n \n\n\fTable A12.5: Traffic Data for Projects Roads (2004) \n \n\nRoad \n\n  \n\nAnimal-  \nDrawn \n\nMotor- \ncycles \n\nCars   Wagons  Buses \n\nTrucks  \n 2 Axles \n\nTrucks \n3Axles \n\nTrucks \n>3 Axles \n\nTotal \nMotorized \nTraffic \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n54\n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nNational Highways  \nMalana Junction-Sarai \nGambila  \n\nBadabher-Darra Adam \nKhel  \nPeshawar-Torkhum  \nBannu-Miranshah \u2013 \nGhulam Khan \n \nProvincial Highways \n\n  \n\nCharsadda-Mardan  \n\nJehangira-Swabi  \n\nKohat-Khushal Garh  \n\nKohat-Thall  \n\nTamirgarh-Munda  \n\n \n\nRural Access Roads \nUmerzai-Harichand \nDargai  \nKarak-Sabirabad \nRoad up to \nShakardarra  \nSarqala-Martung \nPatriak-Kalkot \u2013 \nThall-Badgoi \nLahor-Baika-Jabbal-\nJehangira  \n \n\n \n\n18 \n\n68 \n\n12 \n\n7 \n\n \n\n81 \n189 \n\n25 \n72 \n\n105 \n\n \n\n40 \n\n6 \n\n8 \n\n15 \n\n38 \n\n258 \n\n22 \n\n56 \n\n \n\n  \n\n401 \n267 \n\n17 \n166 \n\n174 \n\n \n\n \n\n106 \n\n38 \n\n45 \n\n38 \n\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n861 \n\n1,211 \n\n424 \n\n1,063 \n\n803 \n\n164 \n\n4,563 \n\n1,670 \n\n1,300 \n\n1,847 \n\n2,427 \n\n320 \n\n173 \n\n1,010 \n\n485 \n\n693 \n\n203 \n\n217 \n\n290 \n\n270 \n\n158 \n\n16 \n\n197 \n\n13 \n\n \n\n  \n\n1,859 \n1,125 \n\n951 \n1,475 \n\n \n\n  \n\n1,838 \n1,526 \n\n1,317 \n1,611 \n\n636 \n\n863 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n257 \n\n64 \n\n44 \n\n54 \n\n \n\n561 \n\n154 \n\n287 \n\n158 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n46 \n118 \n\n81 \n52 \n\n50 \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n\n5 \n\n2 \n\n0 \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n815 \n898 \n\n416 \n324 \n\n280 \n\n \n\n \n\n222 \n\n80 \n\n34 \n\n32 \n\n45 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n50 \n106 \n\n26 \n53 \n\n68 \n\n \n\n \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n \n\n6,015 \n\n4,900 \n\n710 \n\n \n\n  \n\n5,051 \n4,083 \n\n2,815 \n3,697 \n\n2,071 \n\n \n\n \n\n1,011 \n\n292 \n\n408 \n\n298 \n\n \n\n0 \n\n \n\n \n\n42 \n43 \n\n8 \n16 \n\n0 \n\n \n\n \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n \n\n121 \n\n666 \n\n1,043 \n\n483 \n\n0 \n\n2,423 \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n55\n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nIn general, road development provides direct benefits to road users and encourages economic \ndevelopment  by  allowing  easier  mobility  and  access  to  markets  and  suppliers.  In  Pakistan,  the \ndegree to which the poor benefit depends on a number of factors. In general, roads can reduce \nisolation, a common cause of poverty in the country. They can reduce transport costs, and allow \neasier  access  to  population  welfare  services,  sources  of  employment,  health  care,  education, \nand  banking  and  credit  facilities;  and  provide  opportunities  for  income  generation  along  the \nroadside. \n \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n\nPoverty Classification:  Poverty Intervention1 \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n\n \nNorth-West Frontier Province (NWFP) is by far the poorest of the provinces in Pakistan, with an \noverall  incidence  of  poverty  substantially  higher  than  that  for  the  country  as  a  whole.  Poverty \nheadcount  for  NWFP  is  44%,  compared  with  33%  for  Pakistan.  Both  urban  and  rural  poverty  in \nNWFP are higher than that for the entire country: poverty headcounts for urban and rural NWFP \nare about urban 31 % and rural 47%, while for Pakistan the rates are urban 24% and rural 36%. \nPoverty reduction has occurred only in urban areas of NWFP, although it remains the highest for \nall urban areas in the country.  \n \nIn addition, depth and severity of both urban and rural poverty2 are relatively higher for NWFP than \nfor the rest of the country. Inequality in NWFP, as measured by the Gini coefficient for equivalent \nadult consumption, is very similar to that for the country, in rural and urban areas alike. Poverty \nis  associated  with  larger  households,  lack  of  asset  ownership,  and  low  education  and  literacy \nstatus.  Land  ownership  in  NWFP  is  more  equal  than  for  Pakistan,  with  relatively  few  large \nlandowners.  The  majority  of  landowners  (36%  of  the  rural  population)  in  NWFP  belong  to  the \ncategory of small and marginal farmers, namely those who own either no land or up to 1 hectare. \nThis makes NWFP relatively more equal and less hierarchical than areas with large landholdings \nand larger numbers of landless people. \nThe  average  daily  income  per  capita is about PRs243  compared  with  PRs33  for  Pakistan  as  a \nwhole. In 1988, the infant mortality rate (IMR) was 79 per 1,000 and the under-five mortality rate \n116  per  1000  live  births.  Over  one  third  of  children  (38%)  under  age  5  years  are  underweight. \nOnly 39% of children of primary school age (5\u20139 years) in NWFF are enrolled in primary school \nwith higher enrolment rates recorded in urban settings. About two thirds (63%) of the population \nhas access to safe drinking water, 88% in urban and 59% in rural areas. The Pakistan Integrated \nHousehold  Survey  1998/99  indicates  that  42%  of  households  in  NWFP  do  not  have  toilets  or \n\n                                                 \n1  Following  the  Board  approval  of  the  R-paper,  Review  of  ADB\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy,  staff  instructions  to    \nreplace the PI/CPI classification with a new tracking system are under preparation, in line with para. 83 of the R-\npaper. \n\n2  Measured by poverty gap and squared poverty gap respectively \n3  Government of Pakistan. 2003.

Of  households \nwith toilets, less than half (39%)4 have access to safe sanitation. Women on average spend 3.7 \nhours collecting water.  \n \nA household survey revealed a high level of poverty (51%) in communities adjacent to the road \ndevelopment  project  areas.  This  percentage  was  self-assessed  and  compares  closely  with  the \nofficially recorded poverty levels in rural areas of NWFP. Household size of the population in the \nproject area (9.1) was considerably higher than the national average of 6.7 and the average for \nrural areas of NWFP (7.1). The ratio of employed persons to working age population is 37.2%. \nMost  people  earn  their  livelihoods  from  nonagricultural  work  (89%).  The  largest  proportion  of \nthose employed (39.2%) are unskilled laborers. This is followed by agriculture workers at 17.8%.  \nTransport-related  work  accounts for 10%. The rest of the population works for the government \n(including the army) and as small-scale trade people. Literacy levels are 37% in the project area. \nThe area has few medical facilities: only one village in the project area has a maternal and child \ncare  center,  and  40%  of  villagers  have  to  travel  more  than  6  kilometers  (km)  to  reach  a  basic \nhealth unit. Most villages have a mosque school in the village and a primary school either in the \nvillage or less than 1 km away. Girls\u2019 net enrolments are considerably less than boys. Villages in \nthe  vicinity  of  the  Project  either  have  no  basic  road  linking  them  to  the  main  road  or  have  dirt \nroads  in  poor  condition  that  are  mostly  inaccessible  for  transport  services.  Paved  lanes  inside \nvillages are virtually nonexistent. \n \nProject beneficiaries will be primarily road users. These will include the poor who will benefit from \nreduced  fares  and  freight  charges.  The  Project  will  encourage  a  degree  of  economic \ndevelopment  by  allowing  easier  mobility  and  access  to  jobs,  markets,  suppliers,  banking  and \ncredit  facilities,  population  welfare  services,  health  care,  and  education;  and  may  encourage \nincreased  income  generation  along  the  roadside.  However,  the  Project  will  not  automatically \ntrigger significant lowering of barriers to the poor that will allow them to rise out of poverty. For \nexample, in the case of women, severe social and cultural restrictions on their mobility combined \nwith a low skill base mean that the benefits of improved roads are unlikely to make much impact \non women\u2019s poverty. To enhance the ability of the poor and the very poor, especially women, to \nbenefit from the development additional complementary mechanisms under the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction (JFPR) project have been designed for lowering these barriers.  \n \nPoverty reduction will be monitored during implementation through changes in the fare costs and \ntravel-related charges that impact on the poor and the proportion of poor households involved in \nemployment  activities  in  the  implementation  phase.  A  social  and  environmental  cell  will  be \ndeveloped  within  the  Executing  Agency,  which  will,  among  other  tasks,  monitor  social  and \npoverty impacts and manage the JFPR.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\nC.

To  strengthen  the  project  design,  consultations  have  taken  place  along  the \nlength  of  the  candidate  roads  to  identify  common  issues  and  themes.  Communities  will  be \nencouraged  to  take  responsibility  for  their  own  poverty  reduction  efforts  through  the  JFPR \ncommunity infrastructure project by establishing community self-help groups that will develop a \nsituation analysis of their community and establish priorities for reducing poverty. In addition, the \nsocial  and  environmental  cell  will  liaise  between  the  Executing  Agency  and  communities, \ndevelop awareness within the Executing Agency of the links between infrastructure development \nand  communities,  as  well  as  coordinate  and  manage  JFPR  implementation.  The  JFPR  will \ninclude  development  of  community  infrastructure  and  a  community-managed  maintenance \nscheme  for  subprojects  constructed  under  the  JFPR  grant.
