The  program  and  the  related  capacity  development  project  is \nembedded in the Seventh National Socio-Economic Development Plan (NSEDP7), 2010\u20132015, \nwhich envisages an accountable, effective, transparent, and responsive public administration as \na key development objective to strengthen service delivery. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nImproved governance in public sector management  is critical to ensuring better service \ndelivery.  In the Lao PDR, significant lack of resources and capacity constraints undermine the \neffectiveness  of  public  sector  management  (PSM)  at  all  levels.  The  underlying  institutional \nweaknesses  exacerbate  expenditure  inefficiencies  in  the  achievement  of  better  budgetary \noutcomes, and affect quality of frontline services.2 Skewed planning, weak PFM, and an ad hoc \nsystem  of  intergovernmental  fiscal  arrangements  affect  strategic  allocation  of  resources. \nWeakened  institutional  capacities  also  arise  in  part  from  significant  inadequacies  in  financial \nresources.  Despite  recent  progress  in  public  finance,  and  increased  allocations  for  education \nand  health  services,  budget  resources  are grossly  inadequate  when  compared  with the  needs \nidentified in sector development plans. Local administrations, responsible for delivering most of \nthe  pro-poor  programs,  have  major  capacity  constraints,  especially  for  efficient  and  equitable \neducation  and  health  outcomes. 3  While  the  Lao  PDR  has  made  significant  progress  in \nadvancing  gender  equality,  striking  inequalities  persist  along  rural\u2013urban  lines,  geographic \nareas (north, center, and south), and between ethnic groups. These have directly contributed to \nslow achievement of critical Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \n \n4. \nThe  private  sector  has  been  identified  as  the  main  engine  of  growth.  To  overcome \npersistent  resource  scarcity  in  the  public  sector  and  chronic  inefficiency,  the  government  has \nadopted policies to facilitate the gradual transition to a private-sector-led market economy, and \nis  seeking  domestic  and  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  in  key  sectors,  including  agriculture, \neducation, and health, to achieve gross domestic product growth of at least 8% annually and to \naddress  the  financing  gap  under  the  NSEDP7.  Increasing  recognition  of  the  potential  of  the \nagriculture  and  natural  resources  sector  has  led  to  a  large  flow  of  FDI  since  2008. While  FDI \nbrings  capital,  technology,  and  skills,  in  several  instances,  investments  in  the  agriculture  and \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework for subprograms 1 and 2 is in Appendix 1. \n2  World  Bank.  2010.

Lao  PDR:  Public  Expenditure  Tracking  Survey  in  Primary  Education  and  Primary  Health. \n\nWashington, DC. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nnatural  resources  sector,  arising  from  highly  discretionary  large-scale  land  concession \nagreements,  has  led  to  environmentally  and  socially  damaging  results.  The  government  also \nfaces  a  growing  governance  and  institutional  gap,  and  lacks  the  capacity  both  at  the  national \nand  the  local  government  levels  to  implement  and  enforce  the  current  law  on  investment  to \nensure  long-term  sustainability  and  widespread  social  gains.  Gaps  remain  in  enforcement  of \nland  concession  agreements  and  public  sector  capacity  to  enforce  contracts.  Doing  Business \n2012 ranks the Lao PDR 182 among 183 economies in investor protection and 165 in ease of \ndoing business overall.4 \n \n5. \nGovernment  commitment.  Governance  is  a  key  strategic  priority  under  the  NSEDP7. \nThe  government  has  adopted  several  measures,  including  a  long-term  strategic  plan,  to \nimplement public sector governance reforms. The government is committed to strengthening the \nPFM  system  under  the  ongoing  Public  Financial  Management  Strengthening  Program \n(PFMSP). 5  Revenue  management  arrangements  for  the  Nam  Theun  2  and  Nam  Ngum  3 \nhydropower projects commit the government to using hydropower revenues to achieve poverty \nreduction  and  environmental  management  goals  through  strategic  allocation  of  budget \nresources. The National Governance and Public Administration Reforms (NGPAR), 2011\u20132015 \nseek to ensure an accountable and effective civil service at all levels. Major political reforms are \nunder  way  to  strengthen  districts  as  the  primary  administrative  units  for  service  delivery,  as  a \nprecursor  to  fundamental  reforms  in  intergovernmental  financial  arrangements.  In  addition, \ngender  equality  and  women\u2018s  empowerment  issues  have  been  prioritized  in  the  national \ndevelopment  plans,  including  the  National  Strategy  for  the  Advancement  of  Women  (NSAW), \n2011\u20132015.  The  business  regulatory  environment  continues  to  be  streamlined  and  a  broad \nrange of economic reforms  has resulted in an improved investment climate, trade, and private \nsector  development.  The  Lao  PDR  is  geographically  well  placed  to  attract  foreign  investment \nfrom  the  rest  of  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  and  from  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations, and private sector participation. \n \nSupport  to  strengthen  public  sector  capacity  is  a  key  theme  across  the  country \n6. \npartnership  strategy  core  sectors.  The  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016 6  and  the \ncountry  operations  business  plan,  2012\u201320147 of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  the \nLao  PDR  recognize  governance  as  a  key  driver  of  change.  The  2010  country  assistance \nprogram evaluation recognized the importance of PSM in improving public sector governance.8 \nSince  2001,  ADB  has  provided  continued  support  through  a  cluster  of  technical  assistance \nprojects  to  address  institutional  and  capacity  weaknesses  focusing  on  (i)  PFM  subsystems \nrelating to budget formulation, reporting, and accounting; and (ii) external audit by the State Audit \nOrganization (SAO). During 2006\u20132011, ADB also supported medium-term fiscal and expenditure \nframeworks. In addition, the implementation of several projects under the education and health \nsectors  strengthened  the  capacity  for  budget  planning  and  execution  in  the  sector  ministries. \nDesign of the proposed program builds on these legacy works. \n \n7.  \nfrom \nimplementing PFM and civil service reforms in a capacity-constrained environment require that \na step-by-step approach is followed to allow changes to be introduced gradually. A longer time \nframe is a prerequisite for external assistance given the ground realities and weak starting point. \n\nLessons  and  complex  nature  of  governance  reforms.

The  program \n\nTherefore, it is necessary to remain engaged for a longer period of time and to respond flexibly \nto changes in priorities during implementation. These lessons have been incorporated into the \ndesign of the program. \n \nThe  program  priorities  are  aligned  with  government  reform  priorities,  and  are  well \n8. \ncoordinated  with  development  partners.  The  program  is  consistent  with  key  objectives  of  the \nNSEDP7  that  underline  the  link  between  good  governance  and  broader  development  goals. \nSupport  to  the  PFMSP,  NGPAR,  and  NSAW  goals  maximizes  harmonization  and  ownership. \nUsing  a  programmatic  approach,  the  program  seeks  to  sequence  high-impact  policy  reforms, \nwhich allows reforms to be phased over the medium term. Development partners recognize that \nthe lack of institutional capacity in the public sector is a crosscutting challenge. The World Bank, \nthe  European  Union,  and  Australia  represented  by  the  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment  are  supporting  the  PFMSP  to  strengthen  PSM  through  a  series  of  poverty \nreduction  support  operations  and  complementary  technical  assistance  via  a  World  Bank-\nmanaged  multidonor  trust  fund.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  is  the  lead \nagency in public administration reforms.9\n \n \nB. \n \n9. \noutcome will be strengthened national and subnational PSM. \n \nC. \n \nLink  between  subprograms  1  and  2.  The  program  comprises  two  subprograms, \n10.  \nfacilitating a concerted policy dialogue on the basis of an agreed program policy matrix related \nto  key  government  reforms  and  sector  priorities.  In  addition,  the  program  provides  a  clear \nfinancing  framework  for  the  government  over  the  medium  term.  The  program  policy  matrix \nincludes  reforms  completed  prior  to  consideration  of  subprogram  1  by  the  ADB  Board  of \nDirectors,  and  indicative  triggers  for  subprogram  2  to  facilitate  continuous  dialogue  with  the \ngovernment (Appendix 4).  \n \nSubprogram  1  supports  the  government\u2018s  efforts  through  (i)  implementing  multiyear \n11. \nbudgeting  and  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations;  (ii)  strengthening  civil  service  capacity  at  the \ncentral  and  subnational  level,  including  gender-responsive  capacity;  and  (iii)  strengthening \ninvestment  management  capacity  in  the  public  sector  for  private  sector  investments  and \nidentifying potential public\u2013private partnership (PPP) arrangements. Reform in these areas will \nbe key policy pillars under subprograms 1 and 2. Under subprogram 1, the government began \nundertaking these reforms in January 2010, and all 19 policy measures required for subprogram \n1  were  completed.  Subprogram  2 specifies  11  triggers  (prior  actions  that  are  to  be  completed \nbefore submission to the Board) that need to be satisfactorily accomplished by mid-2014. These \ntriggers advance accomplishments under subprogram 1.   \n \n12. \nrelations \nimplemented. The government\u2018s PFM system continues to be strengthened under the PFMSP, \nand a medium-term implementation plan 2011\u20132015 monitors progress. The overall legislative \nframework  and  basic  orderliness  of  budget  processes  has  improved.  Budget  timetables  are \nbetter aligned with budget execution.  A draft public finance development strategy in support of \nthe  NSEDP7  is  under  consideration.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  had  undertaken  capacity \ndevelopment for implementation of medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), in line with the \n\nOutput  1:  Multiyear  budgeting  and \n\nintergovernmental \n\nfiscal \n\n                                                \n9  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nmandate  of  the  2006  State  Budget  Law  and  the  2009  Budget  Implementation  Decree.  MTEF \nlinks policy, planning, and budgeting to improve efficiency and effectiveness of public spending. \nKey government staff members in the MOF, the Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES), and \nthe  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  were  trained  to  develop  medium-term  fiscal  and  expenditure \nframeworks. The MOF budget instruction for FY2012 required the MOES and MOH to prepare \nmedium-term  budget  projections  for  FY2012\u2013FY2015  on  a  pilot  basis,  but  much  effort  will  be \nneeded to institutionalize a MTEF during the implementation of subprogram 2. The government \nis committed to increasing total budget resources by 18% for the education sector and 9% for \nthe  health  sector  under  the  national  budget.  The  MOES  allocated  $30  million  in  August  2010 \nunder the Education for All \u2013 Fast Track Initiative Program that targeted increased enrolment of \ngirls in primary schools in remote and ethnic areas. \n \nA new set of accounting regulations for implementing the 2007 Law on State Accounting \n13. \nwas  approved  by  the  minister  of  finance  (Regulation  1325)  in  June  2010,  and  ministry  and \nprovincial staff were trained to strengthen accounting functions. All line ministries at the center \nand  the  provinces  have  access  to  government  financial  information  system  for  transaction \nprocessing. In addition, Budget, Treasury, and other departments of the MOF are connected to \nthe  GFIS  to  improve  budget  reporting.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  MOF  will  make  efforts  to \ncomply  with  the  requirements  of  the  2007  Law  on  State  Accounting,  initially  on  a  cash  basis, \nthrough the phased adoption of International Public Sector Accounting Standards. The SAO has \nrecently  finalized  an  implementation  plan  for  institutional  strengthening  and  professional \ndevelopment,  identifying  immediate  and  longer-term  support,  and  has  prepared  a  detailed \ncapacity  development  plan  for  procurement  audit  for  implementation  during  2012\u20132014.  To \nstrengthen legislative support to audit reports, the economic planning finance committee (EPFC) \nof  the  National  Assembly  and  SAO  has  developed  draft  rules  of  procedure  to  improve \ncoordination and strengthen discussion and examination of the audit reports by the EPFC. The \nSAO and EPFC are committed to the approval of the draft rules and to continue strengthening \nlegislative oversight of public expenditure during the subprogram 2 implementation period. \n \n14. \nSince  the  approval  of  the  State  Budget  Law  in  2006,  the  Lao  PDR  has  successfully \nimplemented critical reforms of the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system. In particular, it has \nrecentralized  the  revenue  functions  (the  Treasury,  Customs,  and  Tax  administration  offices). \nImportantly,  the  reforms  have  contributed  to  increased  revenue  collection  since  FY2006\u2013\nFY2007.  The  MOF  has  also  prepared  a  decree  on  budget  norms  that  should  rationalize  the \nsystem of budget appropriation to the major spending ministries such as Education and Health. \nThe  MOF  has  recently  established  a  working  committee  to  examine  issues  concerned  with \namendment of the 2006 State Budget Law. The current strategy in the Lao PDR is to strengthen \nthe basic pillars of the deconcentrated fiscal system, and develop the role of districts as the key \nlevel of administration for service delivery, including transfers directly to the districts, initially as \na  pilot.  In  the  area  of  fiscal  transfers,  further  efforts  will  be  made  to  shift  to  a  transparent  and \nformula-based mechanism for the distribution of tax revenues to be shared between the central \nand subnational administrations over the subprogram 2 implementation period. \n \n15. \nOutput  2:  Civil  service  capacity  at  the  central  and  subnational  levels,  including \ngender-responsive  capacity,  strengthened.  Governance  reforms  are  gradually  being \nmainstreamed, underlined by a strong political commitment from the Ninth Party Congress. The \nMinistry of Home Affairs (MOHA) has prepared a draft governance strategy for 2011\u20132020 that \naims to improve the public service, strengthen the rule of law and people\u2018s representation and \nparticipation, and improve PFM. A strategy to promote gender equality in public administration is \nunder consideration by the government so as to support gender-sensitive policy and programs \nrelated to governance reforms. A national leading committee has been established to guide the \nimplementation of the government\u2018s governance reforms. In a significant decision to strengthen \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\ninstitutional  focus,  the  MOHA  became  a  full  fledged  ministry  in  June  2011,  responsible  for \ngovernance-related  reforms  and  addressing  systemic  weaknesses  within  the  civil  service.  To \nsupport the implementation of the strategy for the advancement of women, the Division for the \nAdvancement of Women was established in the MOHA. The NGPAR, 2011\u20132015 was approved \nby  the  prime  minister  in  February  2012  to  ensure  an  accountable,  effective,  and  responsible \nadministration  and  civil  service.  A  program  board  for  NGPAR  implementation,  chaired  by  the \ndeputy prime minister, has been constituted. The Public Administration Research and Training \nInstitute  was  established  in  2011  to  lead  and  coordinate  research  and  training  on  civil  service \nissues at the national and subnational levels. The MOHA continued to lead efforts to strengthen \nMDG-focused  service  delivery  in  35  districts  through  the  District  Development  Fund  (DDF).10  \nBased  on  the  prime  minister\u2018s  order  in  June  2012,  the  MOHA  is  also  working  out  the  policy \nframework and institutional processes needed to (i) build awareness and disseminate the nature \nof  reforms  to  strengthen  districts,  initially  as  a  pilot  for  1  year  (two  districts  in  each  province); \nand (ii)  build  on  lessons  learned.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  MOHA  and  other  stakeholders  are \ncommitted to strengthening implementation and monitoring of the strategic plan on governance, \nincluding the strategy for the promotion of gender  equality by the National Leading Committee \nand the NGPAR Program Board. Effective implementation of the NGPAR will ensure enhanced \nskills  and  competencies  for  a  modern  public  administration  system  through  greater  and  more \nfocused training, including gender-responsive training in the Public Administration Research and \nTraining  Institute.  The  MOHA  will  continue  to  lead,  coordinate,  and  support  measures  to \nstrengthen  district  administrations  to  perform  efficiently  for  improved  service  delivery  over  the \nsubprogram 2 implementation period. \n \n16. \nPolicies  and  processes  related  to  gender  equality  are  gradually  being  mainstreamed. \nThe  National  Commission  for  the  Advancement  of  Women  (NCAW),  responsible  for  the \npromotion  of  gender  equality  and  the  empowerment  of  women,  has  developed  its  second \nNSAW, for 2011\u20132015. In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) approved the \nFive\u2013Year  Strategy for the  Advancement  of Women  in  Agriculture  and Forestry  Sector,  2011\u2013\n2015  in  May  2012,  supporting  women\u2018s  increased  access  to  resources  and  decision-making \npositions.  As  part  of  strengthening  capacity  at  the  district  level,  a  number  of  trainings  were \norganized  to  improve  gender-sensitive  planning,  monitoring,  and  evaluation,  including  gender-\nspecific  health  issues  on  improving  service  delivery  for  maternal  and  child  health.  Under \nsubprogram 2, the MAF and NCAW will continue to monitor the implementation of action plans \nand sector targets developed under the NSAW, 2011\u20132015 and the Five\u2013Year Strategy for the \nAdvancement of Women in Agriculture and Forestry Sector. \n \nOutput 3: Investment management capacity in the public sector for private sector \n17. \ninvestments  and \nidentifying  potential  public\u2013private  partnership  arrangements \nstrengthened. 11 Land concessions issued have resulted in losses of anticipated revenues and \nraised  a  number  of  governance  challenges  with  regard  to  promoting  sustainable  land \nmanagement. The government established the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment \n(MONRE)  in  2011  to  improve the  enforcement  of  land concession  agreements,  contracts,  and \nstrengthen  interagency  coordination  in  order  to  avoid  overlap  in  mandates  at  various  levels, \nincluding measures to develop capacity. The government has recently issued a moratorium on \nconcessions  for  2  years  pending  review  of  the  existing  policies  and  legal  framework,  and \nendorsed  the  revised  Technical  Guidelines  on  Compensation  and  Resettlement  of  People \n                                                \n10 DDF supports administrative capacities for delivering local government services  that primarily supports expansion \nof  infrastructure  to  improve  service  delivery  at  kum  ban  (a  cluster  of  villages)  and  district  levels.  DDF  facility  is \nintended to operate as a stimulus and foundation for intergovernment fiscal transfers. \n\n11 Public  Sector  Capacity  for  Management of  Investments in  Land  and  Private  Sector  Participation  through  Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnerships \u2013 A Background Note for the Proposed ADB Capacity Development Support (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents from Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nAffected  by  Development  Projects  in  June  2011.  Training  on  social  safeguards  (including \ngender issues in resettlement) was also provided to staff of the MONRE and line agencies from \nthree provinces and nine districts. Two working groups are finalizing the National Land Master \nPlan  and  the  National  Land  Policy  to  further  streamline  land  management.  Subprogram  2  will \nsupport further measures for training and to strengthen capacity to screen, award, and monitor \ninvestment proposals by the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), MAF, and MONRE. \n \n18. \nThe government is seriously looking at PPP models to meet the funding gap in the social \nsector.  Since  2010, the MPI,  MAF,  MOES,  and MOH  have strengthened  the  policy framework \nfor enlisting private sector investment.12 The government is identifying policy measures required \nto  strengthen  the  enabling  investment  environment  to  promote  PPPs  in  the  Lao  PDR, \nspecifically  in  the  health  and  education  sectors  to  start  with.  A  draft  PPP  policy  is  being \nconsidered  by  the  government.  It  is  expected  that  upon  adoption  of  the  PPP  policy  the \ngovernment will develop a combination of policy and regulatory reforms\u2014including institutional \nsupport,  incentives,  and  financing  modalities\u2014to  increase  incentives  for  private  sector \nparticipation  in  financing,  developing,  and  managing  future  infrastructure  and  development \nprojects.  Under  subprogram  1,  ADB  facilitated  a  number  of  strategic  policy  dialogues  to \nstrengthen advocacy to foster an enabling framework for  PPPs. Under subprogram 2, the MPI \nwill seek to finalize the PPP policy framework, and  adopt measures to develop an appropriate \nlegal and regulatory framework. \n \nD. \n \n19. \n To support the government reform initiatives outlined in the program, tentative financing \nneeds of $20 million have been identified. For subprogram 1, the government has requested a \nsingle tranche loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR1,655,000 and a single tranche grant \nnot  exceeding  $7.5  million,  in  each  case  from  ADB\u2018s  Special  Funds  resources  to  finance \nsubprogram  1. The  loan  will  have a  24-year term,  including  a grace  period  of  8  years,  and  an \ninterest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The \nloan  and  grant  will  be  subject  to  such  other  terms  and  conditions  substantially  in  accordance \nwith  those  set  forth  in the  draft  financing  agreement.  The  policy-based  loan  and  grant  reflects \nthe development financing needs based on estimated gross external borrowings for 2012\u20132013 \nof  $218.0  million  to  implement  development  projects,  including  the  proposed  loan  and  grant \nunder  subprogram  1.  Financing  of  subprogram  2  will  also  come  from  Special  Fund  resources \nand is estimated at $10 million. Additional budget resources for subprogram 2 are to be utilized \nfor  ensuring  sustainability  of  the  reforms  under  subprogram  1,  with  special  focus  on  a  greater \nlevel  of  public  financing  for  the  education  and  health  sectors  for  improved  service  delivery. \nDuring  2010\u20132012,  the  net  increases  in  the  government  budget  for  the  education  and  health \nsectors  (excluding  foreign  assistance)  was  about  $88  million.  Given  that  these  sectors  are \nsignificantly underfunded, the budget increases will readily exceed the amount of ADB financing \nover  the  medium  term.  The  policy  adjustment  cost  to  the  government  of  implementing  and \ncomplying with the reform measures is estimated at $24 million. \n \n20. \nImplementation  arrangements  for  the  program.  The  implementation  period  for \nsubprogram 1 is from January 2010 to July 2012, and the implementation period for subprogram \n2  is  from  August  2012  to  September  2014.  The  executing  agency  for  the  program  will  be  the \nMOF, which will also be responsible for the overall coordination and disbursement of resources \nunder the programmatic approach. A program steering committee, chaired by the vice-minister \n                                                \n12 MPI:  Investment  Promotion  Law  2009,  National  Investment  Strategy  2011,  and  Prime  Minister\u2018s  Decree  119  for \nImplementation  of  the  New  Investment  Promotion  Law;  MAF:  Agricultural  Development  Strategy  2010;  MOES: \nMinisterial Decree 113 of 29/3/2011 promoting private education; MONRE: State Land Law 2002; and MOH: Health \nFinancing Strategy, 2011\u20132015 and Seventh Five-Year Health Sector Development Plan, 2011\u20132015. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nof  finance,  will  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  program  and  provide  overall  guidance.  The \nMAF, MONRE, MPI, MOH, MOHA, MOES, NCAW, and SAO will be the implementing agencies. \nAs  the  executing  agency,  the  MOF  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  implementation  of \nsubprogram  1 \nrecords,  and \nincluding  disbursements,  maintenance  of  all  program \ncommunicating with ADB on behalf of the government. \n \n21. \nProcurement  and  disbursement  arrangements. The  policy-based  loan and grant for \nsubprogram  1  will  be  released  in  a  single tranche, following  loan  and grant  effectiveness. The \nclosing date of the loan and grant will be 31 March 2013. The government will primarily use the \nlocal  currency  counterpart  funds  generated  by  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds  to  meet  program \nexpenditures and associated costs of reform. The proceeds of the subprogram 1 loan and grant \nwill  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB's  Simplification  of  Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.13 Before withdrawing any funds, the \ngovernment will open or nominate a deposit account with the Bank of  the Lao PDR to receive \nthe  loan  and  grant  proceeds.  The  account  will  be  managed,  operated,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2018s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2012,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nADB  will  retain  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds,  and  to  verify  the \naccuracy of the government\u2018s certification for the withdrawal application. \n \n\nIII. \n\nPROJECT GRANT FOR CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT \n\n(i)  strengthening  multiyear  budgeting  and \n\n \n22. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $6  million  from  ADB\u2018s  Special \nFunds  resources  to  help  finance  the  project.  Implementation  will  require  technical  inputs  and \ntargeted  on-the-job  support,  given  the  weak  civil  service  capacity  to  undertake  public  sector \nreforms  and  to  meaningfully  engage  with  the  private  sector.  The  project  will  have  three \ncomponents: \nfinancial \narrangements; (ii) strengthening civil service management reforms and administrative capacity, \nincluding support to the NCAW; and (iii) strengthening investment management capacity in the \npublic  sector  and  for  PPP  initiatives.  The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $6.5  million.  ADB  will \nfinance $6 million equivalent from ADB's Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund), \nincluding applicable taxes, duties, and bank charges. The government contribution will be $0.5 \nmillion  equivalent  through  in-kind  contributions  of  counterpart  staff  and  various  facilities.  The \nproject  administration  manual  (PAM)  outlines  the  proposed  activities  under  the  project  grant, \nand  will  be  further  refined  prior  to  implementation. 14 The  project  financing  plan  and  project \ninvestment plan are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. \n \n\nintergovernmental \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank (Asian Development Fund) \nGovernment \nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nTable 1: Financing Plan \n\nAmount ($ million) \n\nShare of Total (%) \n\n6.00 \n0.50 \n6.50 \n\n92.31 \n7.69 \n100.00 \n\nTable 2: Project Investment Plan \n\nAmounta \n\nItem \nA. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nBase Costb \n1.

The program will \nresult  in  greater  budget  for  the  education  and  health  sectors,  and  the  expected  expenditure \nefficiencies will be achieved through a medium-term budget. In addition, the government's plans \nto  strengthen  districts  will  potentially  lead  to  better  assignment  of  functions  and  better  service \ndelivery  of  key  MDGs.  Enforcement  and  effective  supervision  of  large-scale  private  sector \ninvestment  in  agriculture  and  potential  PPPs  will  have  large  potential  economic  spin-offs.
