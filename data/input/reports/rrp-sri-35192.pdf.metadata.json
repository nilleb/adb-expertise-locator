(Following the Board \napproval  of  the  R-Paper, Review of ADB's Poverty Reduction \nStrategy, staff instructions to replace the PI/CPI classification with \na  new  tracking  system  are  under  preparation  in  line  with \nparagraph 83 of the R-Paper).  \nSector: Education  \nSubsector: Senior secondary general education  \nThematic: Inclusive social development  \nSubtheme: Human development  \n   \nEnvironment  Category C The Project will involve minor repairs with no negative \nAssessment  implications on environment or involuntary resettlement.  \n   \nProject Description  The Project will help establish a secondary education system that \nis equitable and responsive to labor market requirements. It will \nincrease  equity  of  access  to  quality  secondary  education  by \nupgrading approximately 1,100 target schools  to an acceptable \nquality  standard.  It  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  to \nmodernize the secondary school curriculum and teaching-learning \nmethodologies  by  equipping  some  schools  with  science \nlaboratories, computer facilities, and multimedia units. Capacity of \nschool  personnel  to  manage  and  sustain  these  facilities  and \nimprove  teaching-learning  activities  will  be  developed  through \nteams of zonal trainers/facilitators. Schools will be required to \nsubmit a comprehensive school development plan (SDP) before \nreceiving any support. School-based management (SBM) will be \nenhanced  through  the  provision  of  small-scale  school \ndevelopment grants. Incentive programs to attract teachers to \nwork in rural areas will be carried out. Special attention will be \ngiven to support Tamil teachers. Stipends will be provided to poor \nstudents  qualified  to  study  A-level  science  or  commerce  in  a \nnearby school. The capacity of provincial, zonal, and divisional \neducation  officials  will  be  developed  through  training  and \nconsulting services. The Project will support implementation of the \nGovernment\u2019s  policies  and  reforms  in  education  such  as \ndecentralization  of  education  and  introduction  of  SBM,  and \nintegration  of  school-based  assessment  in  the  national \nexamination.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  social  equity  and \nbuilding  of  social  cohesion  by  minimizing  disparities  across \nregions and ethnic groups, and by promoting inclusive curriculum \ncontent and teaching methodologies.  ", "iv   \n   \nRationale  Despite positive achievements in basic education, low investment \nin education causes disparities in the quality of education and \nresults in low efficiency of secondary education and above. The \npass rates at the ordinary level (O level) and advanced level (A \nlevel) in the national examinations are very low. Only 40% of O-\nlevel students qualify for A level. Regional disparities are evident. \n  Students in rural and disadvantaged areas have much lower pass \nrates  than  those  in  urban  areas.  Moreover,  schools  are  not \npreparing their students for employment. Grade 11 school leavers \ndo not have sufficient knowledge or vocational skills and are not \nequipped  to  seek  skilled  work  or  engage  in  self-employment. \nGrade 13 school leavers also lack employment-related skills and \nif unsuccessful in finding a place in the university system tend to \njoin the ranks of the unemployed. The unemployment rate among \nthose  with  A-level  qualifications  and  above  is  18%;  the \nconventional education system does not meet the demands of the \nlabor  market,  especially  in  information  and  communication \ntechnology, science and technology, and English language skills. \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  improving  the  quality  and \nefficiency of secondary education and modernizing the system to \nmeet labor market requirements.  \n   \nObjectives  The  broad  sector  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  help  establish  a \nsecondary  education  system  that  is  equitable  and  more \nresponsive to labor market requirements. The specific objectives \nare to increase equity of access to quality secondary education, \nand to improve efficiency of the secondary education system. The \nProject  will  upgrade  approximately  1,100  target  schools  not \nsupported  under  earlier  projects,  and  provide  system-wide \nsupport to all 2,300 (1AB and 1C ) secondary schools. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $47.0  million \nequivalent, including taxes, duties, interest charge on the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  loan,  and  physical  and  price \ncontingencies. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $14.6 \nmillion  (31.1%),  and  the  local  currency  cost  at $32.4 million \nequivalent (68.9%) of the total cost \n   \nFinancing Plan   \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  Percent \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nADB  14.6   20.4   35.0   74.4              \nGovernment  0   10.3   10.3  21.9      \nBeneficiaries   0   1.7   1.7   3.7              \n  Total  14.6   32.4   47.0   100  \n \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank. ", "  v\nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $35.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will \nbe provided. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The loan \nwill finance 74.4% of the total project cost. ADB will fund 100% of \nthe foreign exchange cost (31.1% of the estimated total project \ncost), and $20.4 million equivalent of the local currency cost or \nabout 62.8% of the total local currency cost. The remaining $12.0 \nmillion equivalent as counterpart financing (25.6% of the total \nproject cost) will be provided by the Government ($10.3 million) \nand beneficiaries ($1.7 million). The Government will backstop \nany shortfall of beneficiary financing. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2010  \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2009  \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency   Ministry of Education (MOE) \n   \nImplementation  A project steering committee, chaired by the MOE secretary, will \nArrangements  provide overall project guidance. A central project management \noffice (PMO) will oversee day-to-day project implementation. Each \nprovince will have a provincial PMO to coordinate and account for \nall project activities occurring in that province. The SDPs will be \nsubmitted to the central PMO through the zonal education office \nand the provincial PMO. The provincial MOE and/or MOE must \nformally approve the SDPs before any facilities are provided to \nthe schools. \n   \nProcurement  All  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The central \nPMO will be responsible for all procurement. Supply contracts for \ngoods estimated at $500,000 equivalent or more will be awarded \non the basis of international competitive bidding. Supply contracts \nfor goods less than $500,000, but more than $100,000, will follow \ninternational  shopping  procedures.  Supply  contracts  of \ninstructional  materials  less  than  $500,000,  but  more  than \n$100,000, will follow local competitive bidding procedures. Minor \nitems costing less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured by \ndirect purchase. All civil works contracts under the Project will be \nawarded  under  local  competitive  bidding  among  prequalified \ncontractors  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard \nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n   ", "vi   \nConsulting Services  The Project will provide 270 person-months of consulting services \n(108 international and 162 domestic) in the areas of (i) training of \nmaster  trainers/facilitators  for  school-based  training;  (ii) \ncourseware  procurement  and  evaluation;  (iii)  curriculum \ndevelopment and assessment; (iv) library development in schools \nand  training;  (v)  capacity  development  of  provincial  education \noffices;  (vi)  communications  strategies  and  education \nmanagement  information  systems  for  central  and  provincial \nministries education; and (vii) social development, gender equity, \nand interethnic understanding. The Government will select and \nengage all ADB-financed consultants through a firm using quality \nand  cost-based  selection  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will directly benefit approximately 1,100 of type 1AB \nBeneficiaries  and 1C schools that have not benefited from external assistance \n  in the past. The Project will yield particular benefits for schools in \n  disadvantaged areas and conflict-affected areas, by developing \n  infrastructure, facilities, resources, management, teachers, and \n  teaching and learning resources of the target schools up to an \n  acceptable baseline level. The Project will benefit around 200,000 \n  grade 10\u201313 secondary school students each year.  In addition, \n  other students in these schools will benefit from improved school \n  facilities,  enhanced  school  managerial  capacity,  and  more \n  motivated  teachers.  Approximately  825,000  students  per  year \n  from 2005\u20132009 will benefit from the Project. Students in 2,300 \n  secondary  schools  will  benefit  from  system-wide  support  to \n  devolve  education  management;  reform  to  provide  a  more \n  efficient  assessment  system;  modernized  curriculum;  and \n  enhanced capacity of provincial and zonal offices in education \n  planning,  management,  and  monitoring.  Furthermore,  the  800 \n  schools  supported  under  the  ongoing  Secondary  Education \n  Modernization Project (SEMP) will continue to benefit from the \n  Project through training, monitoring and technical assistance.  \n \nRisks and Assumptions  Key lessons from the SEMP and the World Bank-funded Second \nGeneral Education Project are that facilities such as computers, \nmultimedia units, or modern science laboratories will not be used \nand sustained if the Project fails to ensure (i) adequate teaching \nstaff;  (ii)  up-front  capacity  development  of  end-users  and \nbeneficiaries; and (iii) commitment and ownership of provincial, \nzonal, and divisional school stakeholders. Moreover, the schools \nare expected to build a cost-recovery system for the  computer \nlearning centers. ", "  vii \n  However,  schools  in  poor  communities,  and  those  with  less \ncapacity  in  management  may  not  be  able  to  self-sustain. \nFurthermore, innovations such as school-based assessment and \nSBM  need  a  continuing  process  of  capacity  development, \nawareness  raising,  and  monitoring  before  integration  into  the \nsystem.  \n \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  decentralizing  education. \nHowever, accelerated decentralization could bring resistance and \nmisunderstandings about the concept of decentralization or SBM, \nand fail to secure stakeholder commitment. Stakeholders may not \nhave the capacity to implementing  decentralization. The Project \ngives greater roles to zonal and divisional offices to facilitate and \nmonitor  school  activities.  However,  developing  the  institutional \nframework  is  crucial  to  support  the  zonal  and  divisional \nstakeholders  to  assume  new  functions.  Decentralized \nmanagement  systems  also  require  a  strong  transparent \naccountability mechanism.  \n \nThe  Project  does  not  foresee  any  significant  adverse  social \nimpact, and will ensure project benefits across gender and ethnic \ngroups  to  mitigate  any  risk  of  exacerbating  ethnic  tensions. \nHowever, project interventions in target schools located in the \nconflict-affected areas may be affected by the conditions of the \npeace process. Selective inputs of modern education facilities \nmay  cause  disparities  among  schools  with  different  levels  of \nabsorptive  capacity.  Along  with  project  implementation, \ncontinuous policy dialogue with the Government will be sought to \nfind  measures  for  a  more  equitable  training,  recruitment,  and \ndeployment system for teachers, as a key factor for increasing \nequity of access to quality secondary education across regions \nand ethnic groups.  \n ", "ix\n04'2270 HR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Secondary Education Modernization \nProject II. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Sri Lanka has achieved a human development index of 0.73, the highest in South Asia. \nHowever,  despite  gross  domestic  product  growth  of  around  5%  in  the  1990s,  economic \ndevelopment  has  mainly  benefited  the  urban  areas  in  Western,  Central,  and  Southern \nprovinces, and has not reached the rural areas in Uva and North Western provinces, where a \nhigh  concentration  of  the  poor  live.  Around  40%  of  the  population  is  considered poor or \nvulnerable to poverty. Twenty years of civil conflict is the main source of poverty\u2014a result of the \ndestruction of homes and facilities, displacement of people, and diversion of public expenditure \nfrom  economic  and  social  development.  The  cease-fire  agreement  in  2002  changed  the \nGovernment\u2019s development strategy to a positive economic reform agenda, but at the same \ntime, has brought immense challenges to restore infrastructure and services and eradicate \npoverty in the conflict-affected areas in the north-east region. On 2 April 2004, the country \nexperienced its third parliamentary election in 4 years. The new Government, which assumed \nduties on 22 April 2004, has yet to firm its strategy for economic growth, poverty reduction, and \nlong-term peace building in the country.  \n \n3.  Education in Sri Lanka is free in government schools, which comprise 94% of the \nschools, and in state-run tertiary educational institutions. About 10,000 government schools \neducate around 4,000,000 students. Some achievements of the Sri Lankan education system \nare remarkable. The literacy rate of 92% is one of the highest in Asia, and enrollment in primary \nschooling is 95%, in lower secondary 85%. Females make up about 50% of the total student \npopulation. Virtually, all children attend school up to grade 11.  \n \n4.  Despite positive achievements in basic education, the low investment in education \nresults  in  disparities  in  the  educational  quality,  and  a  low  efficiency  and  capacity  of  the \nsecondary system and above. Sri Lanka spends only 2.8 % of the gross domestic product on \neducation compared with 3.5% on average in Asia. As a result, the pass rates at ordinary level \n(O level) and advanced level (A level) in the national examinations are very low. Only 40% of O-\nlevel students qualify for A level. More than 50% of the candidates in O-level examinations in \nmathematics fail each year, while the failure rate for English is nearly 70%. Regional disparities \nin the pass rates are evident. While over 50% of students in Colombo qualify for A level, in the \npoorer districts such as Kilinochi and Nuwara Eliya, less than 30% qualify. Forty percent of A-\nlevel candidates qualify for university, but only about 10% of those gain a place. The capacity of \nthe state-run university system is so small that only 2% of the 20\u201325 age group is enrolled. \n \n5.  With 140,000 people entering the job market each year, and 70% of the unemployed \nbetween 14 and 25 years, the schools are obviously not preparing students for employment. \nGrade 11 school leavers do not have vocational skills and are not equipped to seek skilled work \nor engage in self-employment. Grade 13 school leavers also lack employment-related skills and, \nif  unsuccessful  in  finding  a  place  in  the  university  system,  tend  to  join  the  ranks  of  the \nunemployed. Labor market demand is largely in the area of information and communication \ntechnology  (ICT),  science,  engineering,  marketing,  and  English  language  skills.  The ", "2 \nunemployment rate among those with A-level qualifications and above is 18% because the \nconventional education system does not meet the requirements of the labor market. The \nGovernment is committed to improving the quality of secondary education and to modernizing \nthe system to meet labor market requirements.1 The project framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n6.  A major effort is required to support the Government\u2019s effort to reconstruct the education \nsystem in the conflict-affected areas in the north-east region. Approximately 25% of schools \nwere  closed,  and  15,000  classrooms  in  500  schools  were  damaged,  as  were  libraries, \nlaboratories, water, and sanitation facilities. Displacement insecurity and poverty prevented \nchildren from going to school. About 50,000 school-age children are estimated to be out of \nschool. The Project will pay special attention to reconstructing these areas in coordination with \nthe North-East Community Restoration and Development Project (NECORD),2 which has a \ncomponent for school rehabilitation in the conflict-affected areas.  \n  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  The fundamental problem affecting secondary education is the lack of universal access \nto quality education. This, in turn, results in low efficiency of the system, as apparent in \nstudents\u2019 poor performance in national examinations and employment perspectives. The sector \nand subsector analysis, including a problem tree, is in Appendix 2.  \n     \n8.  Inequity  of  Access  to  Quality  Secondary  Education.  School  disparities include \ninfrastructure; libraries; laboratories; teaching and learning materials; teacher availability and \ncapacity; school managerial capacity; and access to scientific and technical subjects, ICT, \nEnglish  language,  and  practical  skills  development.  Type  1AB  schools,  which  offer  a  full \ncurriculum (science, arts, commerce) are usually well-equipped in terms of facilities and staff, \nand are located in urban areas. They constitute only 25% of the secondary schools, whereas \ntype 1C schools, which offer limited curriculum (arts or commerce, or both) are smaller schools \nlocated in rural areas, and often lack basic facilities and capable teachers. Access to quality \neducation is also affected by household income. Poor parents are unable to send their children \nto  a  better  school  in  urban  areas,  and  to  pay  private  tuition  to  prepare  for  the  national \nexamination. Though the gender balance in participation in secondary education is good, the \nunder-representation of girls in science streams remains as an issue. \n                 \n9.  The shortage and inequitable distribution of teachers across the country creates a major \nbottleneck for increasing equity of access to key subjects. The shortage of Tamil-speaking \nteachers in science, mathematics, and English limits schools in Tamil societies to introduce and \nstrengthen teaching in key subjects such as A-level science, English, and practical subjects. \nThe national teacher transfer policy, which allocates teachers equitably according to local \nneeds, must be reviewed. Until now, this policy has not been followed effectively, and because \nof resistance from teachers to work in remote areas, a teacher surplus exists for large schools in \nurban areas, whereas schools in disadvantaged areas lack teachers.  \n                                                 \n1  Technical assistance was provided to prepare a project proposal.

In 1987, the Government \ndevolved education management to the provincial education authorities. However, the system is \ncomplex hierarchical and duplicates functions at different levels. The low capacity at the zonal \nand divisional offices hinders effective monitoring of education activities. The Government has \nattempted  to  devolve  education  management  to  the  schools  by  introducing  school-based \nmanagement (SBM), where schools exercise managerial control of their activities through a \nschool management council (SMC). The School Development Board Act was introduced in \n1993, but was abolished in 1995 as it faced resistance from certain stakeholders who feared \nthat it might lead to the privatization of public schools. Progress in introducing SBM has been \nslow since then, and a national concept of SBM has yet to be formulated.  \n \n11.  The Assessment System.  The education system is examination oriented, but every \nyear fails to produce an acceptable pass rate among students. The examination oriented \nsystem and lack of practical orientation in teaching and learning have led to the realization that \nmore continuous assessment including practical work, projects, and assignments is needed. \nSchool-based assessment (SBA) has been introduced to the O-level curriculum. SBA marks are \ndisplayed on the O-level certificate, though they are not yet integrated into the O-level grade. \nSBA is currently being brought into the A-level syllabus. However, progress in establishing SBA \nis impeded by lack of monitoring and evaluation at zonal and divisional levels, and lack of belief \namong the public and teachers on the effectiveness of SBA.  \n \n12.   Education  for  Postconflict  Reconstruction.  An  important  role  for  education  in \npostconflict reconstruction is reconciliation and the rebuilding of social cohesion. In Sri Lanka, \nboth the Sinhalese majority and the Tamil minority have expressed grievances based on relative \ndeprivation  of  educational  provision  and  opportunity.  These  perceptions  of  inequality  and \nexclusion have been catalysts of conflict. Education reform should avoid reconstructing the \nsystem  of  exclusion  that  preceded  the  conflict.  Therefore  the  following  steps  are  crucial: \nincrease equity of access to quality secondary education in the deprived areas; ensure that \nthese areas are not excluded from the benefit of a modernized curriculum; and address the \nvalue-forming functions of schooling by developing curriculum content and teaching methods \ncommensurate with the goal of shared values, social cohesion, and inclusive institutions. \n \n13.  The Government\u2019s strategy is to modernize secondary education to enrich the labor \nmarket,  giving  particular  emphasis  to  minimizing  regional  disparities  and  alleviating  the \ndisadvantages  experienced  in  poor  rural  and  conflict-affected  areas.  The  Government  is \ncommitted to recruiting more graduates from the rural areas as teachers, and is giving special \nattention to recruiting Tamil-speaking teachers in the north-east region. The Government has \nalso introduced an incentive program for teachers working in very difficult rural areas. In 2001, a \npilot project on SBM was introduced but was suspended after a change of government. In June \n2004, a new committee was established within the Ministry of Education (MOE) to continue the \nwork initiated in 2001 to develop a national consensus on SBM and to phase its introduction into \nthe system. More emphasis is being given to developing the capacity of zonal offices. The \nGovernment is also committed to introducing continuous assessment and bringing a more \npractical orientation to teaching by making SBA an integral part of the overall assessment of O \nand A levels. The National ICT Policy in Education (2001) lays the foundation for human \nresource development to meet the global challenges in ICT, and creates conditions for effective \nuse of ICT as a learning and teaching tool in school education. Information technology is \ncompulsory at the O-level, and will be introduced at the A-level in January 2005. In July 2004, \nMOE signed a circular allowing schools to generate income by providing computer-learning \nservices to the community after school hours.  ", "4 \n \n14.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) education strategy in Sri Lanka is consistent with \nthe Government\u2019s overall strategies for poverty reduction and economic growth. It supports \ntargeted interventions to raise educational attainment of low-income groups and helps influence \nthe advancement of curricula design to reflect the needs of a modern labor market. It promotes \ndecentralization of education and institutional development at all levels to improve planning, \nmonitoring, and service delivery of education. It builds upon progress and achievements of the \nongoing Secondary Education Modernization Project3 (SEMP), with a goal of maintaining the \nmomentum of innovation and modernization occurring in the secondary school system.  \n   \n15.   The biggest achievements of the  SEMP to date are the establishment of computer \nlearning  centers  (CLCs)  in  474  schools,  the  strengthening  of  multimedia  learning,  and \nestablishment of SBA at the O level. The SEMP targets a total of 800 schools or more for quality \nimprovement. The World Bank-funded Teacher Education and Teacher Deployment Project \nsupported the national colleges of education. The other World Bank-funded Second General \nEducation Project (GEP 2) has supplied libraries, textbooks, and books, and trained teachers \nand principals. It also provided 400 schools with information technology centers. The Small-\nScale Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Upgrading Project (SIRUP) II funded by the Japan Bank \nfor International Cooperation upgrades and rehabilitates schools nationwide. The World Bank is \npreparing an education sector review, the results of which will lead to the next lending program \nfor general education. External assistance to the education sector is in Appendix 3.  \n \n16.  Lessons Learned. The SEMP and GEP 2 have demonstrated that the introduction of \nmodern subjects and teaching, such as ICT,  A-level science, and multimedia learning, will \nsimply not happen if schools are not ready to exploit and sustain the facilities for modern \nteaching. Essential conditions to ensure schools\u2019 readiness are (i) availability of skilled teachers; \n(ii) ownership, capacity, and initiative of the school to maintain the facilities and fully integrate \nmodern  subjects  and  teaching  methods;  (iii)  availability  of  basic  school  facilities;  (iv) \nauthorization for the schools to generate income from the CLCs after schools hours; and (iv) \nclose monitoring from zone and divisional offices. Lessons learned show that some schools in \nthe disadvantaged areas are more in need of basic facilities and skilled teachers than access to \nmodern curriculum. Therefore, project investment should be carefully planned based on school-\nspecific development needs. Furthermore, the SEMP has initiated SBA and introduced SBM, \nbut  further  awareness  raising  and  capacity  building  at  all  levels  is  needed  before  these \ninnovations can be integrated into the system. Lessons learned from the SEMP, GEP 2 and \nTeacher  Education  and  Teacher  Deployment  Project  are  summarized  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \n17.  Increasing Equity of Access to Quality Secondary Education. The priority will be to \nminimize disparities across regions, gender, and ethnic groups by upgrading all schools to an \nacceptable baseline standard, and equipping them with modern facilities where feasible. The \nstrategy will be to build upon the progress of SEMP; build capacity of school stakeholders to \nsustain  and  maximize  benefit  of  the  facilities;  provide  closer  monitoring  and  guidance  by \nimproving the capacity of zonal and divisional offices; and support implementation of key \nGovernment policies, such as the decentralization of education and SBM, assessment reform, \ncurriculum  modernization,  and  teacher  training,  recruitment,  and  transfer.  The  Project  will \ncoordinate with the NECORD and SIRUP II for school rehabilitation needs in the conflict-\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2000.

Objectives \n18.  The broad sector goal of the Project is to help establish a secondary education system \nthat is equitable and responsive to labor market requirements. The specific objectives are to \nincrease equity of access to quality secondary education, and improve the efficiency of the \nsecondary education system. The Project will specifically target the remaining approximately \n1,100 1AB and 1C schools that were not served by either the SEMP or GEP 2, and provide \nsystem-wide support to all 2,300 (type 1AB and type1C) secondary schools. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n19.  The Project has three components: (i) improving quality of, and equity of access to, \nsecondary education, (ii) strengthening the capacity of provincial and zonal offices, and (iii) \nsupporting implementation of government policies and reforms in education. \n \n1.  Component 1: Improving Quality of, and Equity of Access to, Secondary \nEducation \n \n20.  This component will ensure that all target schools that do not meet an accepted quality \nstandard, defined by the Project as a baseline, will be supported by upgrading physical facilities, \nproviding teaching-learning resources, strengthening teachers\u2019 skills and principals\u2019 managerial \ncapacities, and small-scale school development grants (SDGs). This upgrading effort will ensure \nthat every secondary school is capable of teaching the eight required O-level subjects in the \ncurriculum. A needs analysis will be conducted to categorize each target school based on its \nunique  priority  development  needs.  Baseline  conditions  for  secondary  schools  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. In addition, at least one school per division (or two schools where \nthe population is a mix of Sinhala and Tamil) will be upgraded to 1AB status, or improved to \noperational 1AB status. In areas where this is not possible because of lack of demand for A-\nlevel science stream and science teachers, the school will be provided with modern teaching \nfacilities . These upgraded or improved schools will provide opportunities to students from other \nschools in the area that lack teaching facilities for science, commerce, and ICT. Highest priority \nfor upgrading schools to 1AB status will be given to the 61 divisions that have no 1AB schools. \nBefore receiving any support, all target schools will be required to submit a school development \nplan (SDP) that includes a teaching plan and facility management plan. The school resource \nallocation  procedure  and  funding  formula  is  in  Appendix  4.  The  criteria  for  SDPs  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n \na.  Upgrading Facilities and Providing Equipment \n \n21.   According to their needs, schools below the baseline conditions will be provided with (i) \nrehabilitation/renovation of classrooms and science laboratories, walls, roof, and partition walls \nor movable screens; (ii) a multipurpose activity room; (iii) classroom furniture, blackboard, \ndisplay board, teaching aids, and a cupboard in each classroom; (iv) a library with adequate \nbooks, shelves, and other resources; (vi) electricity supply and telephone facilities; (vii) safe ", "6 \ndrinking water; (vii) sanitary facilities; and (viii) science equipment. New construction will be \ncarried out in limited cases. The Project will coordinate with the NECORD and SIRUP, so that \nthe Project will provide inputs other than physical upgrades for the schools supported by the two \nprojects.  \n \n22.  Schools with more than 100 secondary (grade 10\u201313) students and that have access to \nelectricity will be eligible to receive computer facilities, accessories, software, and ICT training, \nprovided that the SDPs submitted by the schools demonstrate a capacity to manage the \nfacilities. Computers and multimedia equipment will also be provided for the multimedia room \nassociated with the library. Training for maintenance of the computer facilities will be provided \nboth from the suppliers and the zonal facilitators. Subsidies will be provided for computer \noperating expenses for 2 years.  \n \nb.  Producing Teaching-Learning Resources, and Introducing Teaching \nMethods \n \n23.  Zonal  trainers/facilitators  will  provide  school-based  training  in  innovative  teaching \nmethods,  teaching-learning  resource  (TLR)  production  and  use,  and  SBA  techniques  to \nteachers in 1,100 target schools. Teachers will also receive training on teaching methodologies \nthat foster interethnic understanding. Training guides and manuals will be provided to teachers \non  SBA,  innovative  teaching  methods,  and  TLR  development.  For  schools  receiving  ICT \nfacilities, training on computer-assisted learning (CAL) and special ICT learning guides with \nrelevant exercises will be provided to both teachers and students. The zonal facilitators will be \ntrained to monitor the development and use of CAL, innovative teaching methods, TLRs and the \napplication of SBA practices by the teachers on a regular basis. Two hundred international \nfellowships  will  be  provided  to  teachers  and  zonal  facilitators  to  learn  modern  teaching \napproaches. Furthermore, educational software will be procured from international sources for \ncore subjects in grades 10\u201313 and made available in three languages (English, Sinhala, and \nTamil). By translating and contextualizing relevant software packages into Sinhala and Tamil, \nstudents will be able to learn subject content in three languages. Schools supported under \nSEMP schools will also benefit from training and monitoring from the zonal facilitators.    \n \nc.  Building  Capacity  and  Providing  Special  Support  Programs  for \nSchools and Students \n \n24.  Capacity of the schools to prioritize, plan, and manage resources and learning activities \nwill be developed through training on SBM and leadership for principals, teachers, and school \ndevelopment societies (SDSs)4, or SMCs as appropriate. The zonal facilitators will provide the \ntraining, including methodologies for preparing and implementing a comprehensive SDP. \n      \n25.  Poor students in disadvantaged and conflict-affected areas, who are qualified to attend \nA-level science or commerce classes will be provided with stipends to attend a nearby 1AB \nschool. The stipend program will help students pay for additional travel costs and school-related \nexpenses such as fees, books, and lodging. Stipends will be provided to approximately 12,000 \nstudents per year over a 4-year period. Qualified students from type 2 schools (which cover \n                                                 \n4  SDSs will be gradually replaced by SMCs.  ", "7 \ngrades 1\u201311) will be also eligible to attend a 1AB school or 1C school (for commerce). The \ncriteria for the school stipend program are described in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n26.  A pilot project will be conducted to hire 100 graduates with national diplomas in ICT or \nequivalent to provide technical assistance to about 500 schools on a cluster basis, particularly in \nrural areas. The pilot project will be implemented in the first 3 years of the Project to ensure that \ncomputer resources are fully utilized by the schools with minimum interruptions during the start-\nup period. In addition, to help students learn information technology, at least 25 ICT learning \nguides containing relevant exercises and assignments will be provided to each school (available \nin three languages, depending on each school's requirements). The Project will also support the \ntraining  of  at  least  1,000  teacher-librarians  in  ICT  usage,  web-based  learning,  computer-\nassisted learning, and library management including computerization of library resources. This \nsubcomponent will support the training of principals and teachers at each school in career \nguidance, counseling techniques, and career center operations as a follow-up to activities under \nthe SEMP. This will include awareness-raising on gender-based constraints in education and \ntraining school stakeholders to encourage greater participation of girls in science streams.  \n \n27.  A  teaching  incentive  program  to  attract  teachers  to  serve  4  years  in  rural  and \nunderprivileged areas will be implemented. Allowance will be offered to 200 teachers in English, \nmathematics, science, technical subjects, and ICT. The pilot program will be implemented in \nUva Province, which has a large geographic disparity of teachers, with teachers concentrated in \nurban areas. Selected teachers should have at least 5 years teaching experience.  \n \n2.  Component 2: Strengthening the Capacity of Provincial and Zonal Offices \n \n28.  Activities are directed at strengthening the skills and competencies of provincial and \nzonal offices so that their staff can exercise greater supervision and monitoring of school \nactivities. Principals, teachers, and SDSs will be trained in key areas such as SBA, SBM, TLR \nproduction,  student  counseling,  and  innovative  teaching  methodologies.  The  management \ncapacity of provincial departments of education will be strengthened by providing international \nand domestic education system management consultants to work with the individual provincial \ntraining development units (PTDUs) for fixed periods. \n \na.  Strengthening Zonal Offices \n \n29.  A cadre of 3\u20135 trainers/facilitators will be developed in each zone to specialize in \ninnovative teaching methodologies, SBM and educational leadership, ICT-based pedagogy, \nTLR production, and SBA. Special attention will be given to teaching methodologies that foster \nintercultural and interethnic understanding. These facilitators will be responsible for about 10 \nproject schools in a given zone, and will conduct school-based training for principals, teachers, \nSDSs, (or SMCs) in their specialized areas on a year-round basis. A train-the-trainer program \nwill be implemented by initially training a core of master trainers who in turn will train zonal \nofficers, In-Service Advisers (ISA)s, and divisional directors to become facilitators capable of (i) \nhelping  schools  prepare  SDPs;  and  (ii)  training  principals,  teachers,  SDSs,  and  SMCs  in \nidentified key areas. Indicative criteria for selecting zonal facilitators are in Supplementary \nAppendix E. \n ", "8 \nb.  Strengthening Provincial Offices \n \n30.  The role of provincial departments is to provide strategic guidance to zonal education \noffices and monitor overall system performance. To support the development of provincial \noffices, this subcomponent will implement a train-the-trainer program to train senior and middle \nmanagement  of  provincial  ministries  of  education  in  SBM  and  educational  leadership.  To \nfacilitate the training, the Project will provide one domestic education management consultant to \neach province for 1 year to provide advice and oversee training of provincial, zonal, and \ndivisional offices. The consultant will work within the PTDU and provide training to provincial \nand  zonal  personnel  on  SBM,  human  resource  management,  and  education  system \nmanagement. In addition, the Project will provide one international education management \nspecialist to each PTDU for a limited period.  \n \n3.  Component 3: Supporting Implementation of Government Policies and     \n        Reforms \n \n31.  This component will support Government policies to make the education system more \nefficient and effective. Activities include improving the operations of national institutions such as \nthe National Evaluation Testing Services (NETS), strengthening coordination between MOE and \nthe provincial authorities, mainstreaming SBM in the system, and developing schools\u2019 capacities \nto become more self-reliant. Research; pilot studies; and public awareness programs in key \nreform areas such as decentralization of education, SBM, SBA, public-private partnership in \neducation, and curriculum development will be part of the component. \n  \na.  Supporting Decentralized Education Management \n \n32.  To support the implementation of SBM in the education system, this component will \nimplement a pilot initiative to establish and run 100 SMCs with provision of small start-up grants. \nThe grant will help a given SMC to get started and perform its functions and duties over 3 years. \nZonal facilitators will be employed to monitor program implementation and facilitate the start-up \nand operation of each SMC over the trial period. The results of this pilot initiative will provide \ninformation to the Government on how SMCs can be effective administrative bodies in the \nsystem.  This  subcomponent  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  to  strengthen  school \nmanagement and leadership in the school system. Zonal facilitators will be employed to train \nschool principals, teachers, SDS representatives, and SMC members in SBM and education \nleadership techniques. In addition, the trainers will implement an effective public awareness \nprogram on SBM. The Project will also provide school-based training for principals on using ICT \nfor managing the school and implementing SBM. Zonal trainers will monitor and evaluate the \nimplementation of SBM in the schools over 4 years, and advise the principals, SDSs, and SMCs \non a consistent basis. The principals are expected, in time, to gain more confidence and skill in \nusing the computer as a tool for managing and administering the school more effectively. This \nsubcomponent will provide school-based training for approximately 1,000 school principals and \nmembers of SDSs and SMCs. Indicative plans for piloting the SMC start-up program and \nmainstreaming SBM are in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nb.  Developing School Partnerships and Sustainability \n \n33.  This subcomponent will support Government policies on promoting efficient generation \nand utilization of funds in the schools by implementing a train-the-trainer program to develop a ", "9 \nteam of local experts that can advise SMCs on procedures and mechanisms for financing and \nsustaining school operations, including ways of developing partnerships with the private sector, \ncommunity groups, and other schools. The local experts will work directly with schools and help \nthem  prepare  sustainability  measures  as  part  of  the  SDP.  Funds  could  be  generated  by \noperating the CLCs after hours and offering ICT training courses to the community. By year 4, \nthe Government will evaluate the partnership program, incorporating lessons learned from the \nSEMP, and develop an action plan for public-private partnerships in education.  \n \nc.  Streamlining the National Examination System \n \n34.  This subcomponent will build on the progress of the SEMP and provide consulting \nservices to NETS on ways to improve and streamline the national testing and evaluation \nprocess, including computerization of operations and evaluation results. It will strengthen the \ncapacity of NETS to integrate SBA results into the national examination system. SBA marks will \nbe integrated into the student\u2019s final grades for both the O and A-level certificates after year 3 of \nthe Project. This will be achieved as SBA takes root in the system and the reliability of SBA is \naccepted by the public. The Project will implement awareness programs for principals, parents, \nand zonal monitoring panel members to orient them to the objectives, modalities, and expected \noutcomes of SBA. Also, curriculum specialists from the National Institute of Education (NIE) and \ntest development specialists from NETS will work together and develop a comprehensive SBA \nsystem covering grades 6\u201313. \n \nd.  Modernizing the Curriculum \n \n35.  The  Project  will  support  NIE  to  develop  eight  options  within  the  technical  studies \nsubjects in the core curriculum of O-level options to provide alternative vocational courses that \ninitiate students into specific occupations in the agricultural, industrial, and service sectors of the \neconomy. Furthermore, the Project will support NIE in developing a civics curriculum that \npromotes interethnic understanding and reconciliation. This will build upon work initiated under \nMOE to establish an inclusive curriculum development process.   \n \ne.  Building Capacity of the Ministry of Education \n \n36.  This subcomponent will strengthen the capacity of MOE to develop procedures and \nmechanisms for creating stronger linkages and coordination with the provincial and zonal \nauthorities. MOE\u2019s capacity to conduct monitoring and evaluation activities on a consistent basis \nat all levels will be strengthened. Ten study tours for project management office (PMO) and \nMOE technical staff per year will be provided in the fields of civil works, project management, \neducation system management, monitoring and evaluation, and financial management.  \n \n37.  The Project will build upon work started under the GEP 2 and SEMP to introduce E-\ngovernance  to  the  education  system,  including  the  design  and  piloting  of  an  education \nmanagement  information  system  (EMIS)  to  improve  school  administration  at  institutional, \ndistrict, zonal, and ministerial levels. The Project will provide consulting services and training for \nMOE staff in piloting the additional phases of EMIS implementation. The adoption of EMIS \nnationwide will take several years to complete, and the Project will support the initial piloting of \nan information system linking MOE with all provincial and zonal offices in the country. \n ", "10 \nC.  Special Features \n \n38.  Decentralization  and  Institutional  Development.  The  Project  promotes \ndecentralization  policy  implementation  by  giving  greater  roles  in  education  planning, \nmanagement, and monitoring to provinces, zones, divisions, and stakeholders at the school \nlevel. It supports institutional development at zone and school level, by giving a larger share of \ntechnical assistance, training, and staff development to the zonal offices and school personnel. \nPiloting the SMC start-up grant, preparing SDPs, and managing SDGs will help raise awareness \non SBM and build schools\u2019 self-management capacity. The establishment of pools of zonal \nfacilitators to conduct on-site facilitation and monitoring of schools' activities will strengthen the \nroles of zonal offices and provide greater technical support to teachers and principals. The \nprovincial education departments will have full-time PMOs and will play a greater role in project \nplanning and management, such as selecting target schools and prioritizing project inputs in \ntheir own provinces.  \n \n39.  School Development Plans. The SDPs will serve two purposes: (i) develop leadership \nand  self-management  capacity  of  schools  and  SMC  members,  including  cost-recovery \nmeasures to enable the school to become more financially self-reliant; and (ii) provide teaching \nand facility management plans that show commitment and readiness from stakeholders at all \nlevels to exploit and sustain facilities and financial support provided by the Project. The SDPs \nwill be prepared by the schools and SMCs as appropriate, and should be approved by zone and \nprovincial education offices, and MOE. No physical facilities or financial support will be provided \nto the schools without the submission and approval of the SDP.  \n \n40.  Continuity between the SEMP and the Project. Development in the subsector is a \ncontinuing process. To maintain the momentum of innovation and modernization initiated by the \nSEMP, the two projects will be seen as phased investments within a long-term development \nstrategy for secondary education. The PMO established for the SEMP will continue working \nunder the Project. The SEMP will provide preparatory activities such as the needs analysis of \nthe target schools, and up-front capacity-building activities such as awareness raising of the \nprovincial and zonal stakeholders, and training of zonal trainers/facilitators. Target schools \nsupported by the SEMP will continue to be supported under the Project through the provision of \ntraining, monitoring and technical assistance.   \n \n41.   Building Social Cohesion. Support for the role of education in reconciliation and \nbuilding of social cohesion is reflected in each project component. Teaching methodologies, \ncurriculum content, and SBA that foster interethnic understanding and development of civic \neducation will be promoted.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n42.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $47.0 million equivalent, including taxes, \nduties, interest charge on the ADB loan, and physical and price contingencies. The foreign \nexchange cost is estimated at $14.6 million (31.1%), and the local currency cost at $32.4 million \nequivalent (68.9%) of the total cost. A summary of the  cost estimates is given in Table 1. \nDetailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 5. \n \n \n ", "11 \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nCategory  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

Financing Plan \n \n43.  The Government has requested a loan of $35.0 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons \nfor its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n44.  The loan will cover 74.4% of the total project cost. ADB will fund 100% of the foreign \nexchange cost (31.1% of the estimated total project cost), and $20.4 million equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost or about 62.8% of the total local currency cost. Interest during construction \nwill be capitalized as indicated in Table 1. The remaining $12.0 million equivalent as counterpart \nfinancing (25.6% of the total project cost) will be provided by the Government ($10.3 million) \nand beneficiaries ($1.7 million). The Government will provide for local currency costs of civil \nworks. SDSs or SMCs will provide $1.7 million equivalent for operational expenditures for the \nmultimedia rooms, libraries, and computer-learning rooms (electricity charges, Internet charges, \nschool security, library books, and allowances for zonal training specialists/facilitators), and in-\nkind labor contribution for civil works. The Government will backstop any shortfall of beneficiary \nfinancing.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n45  As Executing Agency, MOE will have overall responsibility for project coordination and \nimplementation.  A  project  steering  committee  will  provide overall guidance to the Project, \nmonitor its activities and outputs, provide feedback to the PMO, and help coordinate and liaise \nwith other government agencies and departments. Chaired by the MOE secretary, the steering \ncommittee will comprise representatives from MOE, External Resources Department of the \nMinistry  of  Finance,  National  Planning  Department,  NIE,  NETS,  provincial  ministries  of \neducation, and National Education Commission.  \n \n46.  The central PMO will oversee day-to-day project implementation, and consist of a project \ndirector and staff appointed by MOE. The project director will be a member of project steering \ncommittee and report directly to it. Five specialists for administration and finance, educational \ndevelopment, procurement, engineering and civil works, and benefit monitoring and evaluation \nwill assist the project director. One of the staff should also have expertise in social development, \ngender, and interethnic understanding. The Project will provide support staff, equipment, and \noperating expenses for the PMO. The PMO will have overall responsibility for project planning, \nbudgeting, monitoring, reporting, supervision of various studies, and coordination with provincial \nand zonal authorities. The PMO will coordinate the work of the consultants. To ensure continuity \nbetween the SEMP and the Project, PMO staff under the SEMP will be retained, subject to their \nsatisfactory performance. Through SEMP implementation, MOE has demonstrated sufficient \nfinancial management capacity to implement the Project. \n \n47.  Each province will have a provincial PMO staffed by a provincial project manager and a \nsecretary. They will be attached to the provincial department of education and be supported with \na transportation and operational budget. Each provincial PMO will have specific responsibilities \nto coordinate and account for all project activities occurring in the province and will report to the \ncentral PMO. In particular, the provincial PMO will help the zonal officers compile the list of \nschool needs, prepare the provincial priority list for school resource allocation,  manage and \ndisburse the SDG, and investigate and attempt to resolve complaints concerning the Project at \nthe subprovincial level. The overall project management structure is presented in Appendix 6. A \nproject implementation mechanism is described in Supplementary Appendix G.  \n \n48  School Development Planning Process. The schools and SMCs, as appropriate, will \nprepare the SDPS, guided by the zonal facilitators. Prior to SDP preparation, schools will ", "13 \nreceive extensive training in SBM. The schools will submit the SDP to the zonal education \noffice, which will review the SDP and approve it before submission to the provincial PMO. The \nprovincial PMO will submit the SDP for approval of the provincial MOE, except for the SDPs of \nnational schools, which MOE administers directly, and which MOE will approve. The provincial \nPMO will then send the SDPs to the central PMO, which submits the SDPs to MOE for formal \napproval.  Once  approved,  the  central  PMO  will  proceed  with  procuring  civil  works  and \nequipment. The provincial PMO will disburse the annual allocation of the SDG. Zonal facilitators \nwill  be  responsible  for  monitoring  civil  works,  provision  of  equipment,  training,  and \nimplementation of activities by the schools. The provincial and central PMOs will conduct \nrandom compliance monitoring of the schools. The zonal education office will submit the school \nmonitoring reports to the central PMO through the provincial PMO. The provincial and central \nPMOs will closely monitor that no school receives physical facilities or SDG without an approved \nSDP. All stakeholders will receive adequate training in their respective roles and functions. The \nschool planning process and the training plan are in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \n49.  A complaint investigation and resolution mechanism will be established within the MOE\u2019s \nInternal  Auditors  Department.  This  mechanism  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  reviewing  and \naddressing complaints from end-users, beneficiaries, and other project stakeholders in relation \nto any project component, any of the service providers, or any person responsible for carrying \nout any aspect of the Project; and (ii) establishing the threshold criteria and procedures for \nhandling  such  complaints,  including  publicizing  the  mechanism,  and  for  proactively  and \nconstructively responding to them. A full-time MOE professional staff member will be dedicated \nto the unit and report directly to the MOE secretary. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n50.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years from early 2005 to December 2009. The \nPMO will be made fully operational by December 2004.The indicative implementation schedule \nis in Appendix 7.   \n \n3.  Procurement \n51.  All  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. All civil works contracts under the Project will be awarded under \nlocal competitive bidding among prequalified contractors in accordance with the Government\u2019s \nstandard procurement procedures and other requirements satisfactory to ADB. Civil works will \nbe financed by ADB, Government, and beneficiaries. The PMO will be responsible for all \nprocurement. The indicative procurement package is in Appendix 8. \n \na.  Civil Works \n \n52.  Civil works will involve the development of physical infrastructure and facilities of 1C and \n1AB schools that are below the baseline conditions. Civil works will include upgrading or \ninstalling a library, science lab, and activity room. It will also include partitioning classrooms, \nproviding drinking water, and constructing toilets where required. The provincial PMOs will be \nresponsible for monitoring quality, costs, and implementation. They will ensure quality standards \nfor water supply and toilet facilities to minimize environmental impact. Schools that have been \nrehabilitated by other projects such as the NECORD and SIRUP II will not be included in the \ncivil works under the Project, unless justified as an essential need for the school.  \n ", "14 \nb.  Equipment and Materials  \n \n53.  Supply contracts for goods estimated at $500,000 equivalent or more will be awarded on \nthe basis of international competitive bidding. Supply contracts for goods such as vehicles, \nsoftware, and computers less than $500,000, but more than $100,000, will follow international \nshopping procedures. Supply contracts for locally available instructional materials of less than \n$500,000, but more than $100,000, will follow local competitive bidding procedures. Minor items \ncosting less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured by direct purchase.  \n \n54.  The Project will finance the procurement of standard packages of science equipment for \nteaching O-level science and technology, and basic equipment for activity rooms to enable \nschools to offer technical options within technical studies. In addition, the Project will finance the \npurchase of grade 12\u201313 science kits for those schools being upgraded from 1C to 1AB status. \nBasic sets of audiovisual equipment will be purchased for multimedia rooms. Computers, \nprinters, uninterrupted power supplies, and air conditioners will be purchased for the CLCs, \nwhich will include at least one computer with CD-RW/DVD-ROM combination drive. Furniture \nwill be purchased as part of upgrading schools to acceptable standards.   \n \n55.  The  Project  will  finance  the  purchase  of  library  books,  print-based materials, and \neducational  courseware  for  libraries.  Subject-specific  software  for  O-  and  A-level  English, \nmathematics, science, and technical studies will be procured from international suppliers who \ncan deliver the software in three languages (English, Sinhala, and Tamil). Other educational \ncourseware  that  will  be  purchased  includes  curriculum-free  software  such  as  Encarta, \nEncyclopedia Britannica. ICT learning guides for both teachers and students will be purchased. \nAs  the  estimated  package  costs  are  less  than  $500,000,  procurement  will  be  made  in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, and procedures will follow international \nshopping or direct purchase as applicable. Career guidance materials and student counseling \nand evaluation tests may be procured locally in accordance with the Government\u2019s standard \nprocedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n56.  The Project will provide 270 person-months of consulting services (108 international and \n162 domestic). International consultants will be needed for (i) training master trainers in key \nareas such as SBA, SBM, TLR development, ICT-based pedagogy, and innovative teaching \nmethods;  (ii)  courseware  procurement  and  evaluation;  (iii)  curriculum  development  and \nassessment; (iv) library development and management; (v) management capacity building for \nprovincial  offices  and  the  PTDUs;  and  (vi)  EMIS.  Domestic  consultants  will  (i)  help  the \ninternational  consultants  plan  and  deliver  the  training,  and  (ii)  support  the  international \neducation management specialists working within the PTDUs. A domestic consultant in social \ndevelopment  will  help  the  PMO  ensure  promotion  of  gender  equity  and  interethnic \nunderstanding. The Government will select and engage all ADB-financed consultants through a \nfirm using quality and cost-based selection and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. The required consulting services and the outline terms of reference are in Appendix \n9. \n \n  5.  Staff Development and Training \n \n57.  Extensive in-country and limited international training will be provided under the Project \nwith a total of about 314,800 in-country training person-days and about 9,590 international ", "15 \ntraining person-days. Selection of candidates for all training will follow the Government\u2019s general \nguidelines on training under development-funded projects. ADB approval will be required before \nthe award of international fellowships. ADB will be provided with a list of (i) the nominated \ncandidates, (ii) their qualifications, and (iii) detailed cost of the proposed courses. Candidates \nfor international fellowships from zonal offices should not be more than 52 years of age. \nTeachers selected for international fellowships will have served for a year in schools in difficult \nareas5  prior  to  the  training  and  will  serve  for  2  more  years  after  the  training.  The  staff \ndevelopment and training plan is in Appendix 10.  \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n58.  To expedite implementation through the timely release of ADB\u2019s share of funds for \neligible expenditures, an imprest account will be established in the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in \nColombo. It will be managed and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement \nHandbook, and detailed arrangements agreed to by the Government and ADB. The initial \ndeposit to the  imprest account will not exceed 10 percent of the loan or the future 6 months \nestimated expenditures, whichever is less. Statement of expenditures procedures in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook will be used for individual payments not exceeding \n$100,000. The imprest account and statement of expenditures procedures will be audited as \npart of the regular audit of the Project\u2019s account and financial statements. The audit opinion on \nthe imprest account and statement of expenditures should be set out separately. In the case of \nthe SDGs, which will be disbursed by the provincial PMO, the Government will advance funds \nfrom its own budget to the provincial PMO. The provincial PMO will submit expenditure details \nto the central PMO, which will reimburse the Government from the imprest account. ADB will \nreplenish the  imprest account  when the central PMO submits a withdrawal application for \nreplenishment that incorporates project expenditure including the SDGs. All other expenditures \nwill be made through the imprest account managed by the central PMO.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n59.  The Government, acting through MOE, will maintain records and accounts adequate to \nidentify goods and services financed from the loan proceeds. The Government will ensure that \neach Provincial Council maintains adequate records and accounts for the Project. MOE will \nmaintain separate accounts for the Project and ensure that accounts and financial statements \nare audited annually by independent external auditors acceptable to ADB. The auditor\u2019s report \nand copies of the certified accounts and related financial statements, including the auditor\u2019s \nopinion on the use of loan proceeds, compliance with loan covenants, and use of the imprest \naccount under ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure, will be submitted to ADB in English \nnot later than 9 months after the close of the Government\u2019s fiscal year. The independent \nexternal auditing services will be financed from the loan proceeds. \n \n60.  The PMO will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation and submit them to \nADB within 30 days after each quarter. The reports will be in a format acceptable to ADB and \nindicate  (i)  progress  against  established  targets,  (ii)  status  of  performance  indicators,  (iii) \nproblems encountered and steps taken to resolve the problems, (iv) compliance with loan \ncovenants, and (v) program activities proposed for the following quarter. Within 3 months after \nproject completion, the PMO will prepare a project completion report and submit it to ADB \ndescribing project implementation, accomplishments, benefits, and impact. \n   \n                                                 \n5 Based on the list of schools in difficult areas provided by MOE. ", "16 \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \na.  Annual Operational Plans \n61.  By December of each year of project implementation, MOE will provide ADB with an \nannual operating plan for the following fiscal year. The plan will include (i) data on the proposed \nallocations to secondary education; (ii) status of agreed-upon policy reforms and covenants; (iii) \nfully costed project activities proposed for each subcomponent, with performance targets; and \n(iv) a list of secondary schools targeted for upgrading during the year. The plan will also provide \nestimates of the operation and maintenance budget and ensure that adequate counterpart funds \nare provided. \n \nb.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n62.  An adequately developed monitoring and evaluation system will be installed in MOE and \naccessed through the PMO. It will monitor and evaluate implementation performance, improve \nmanagement information, and assess the impact of the Project on improving the secondary \neducation system. Project performance monitoring will focus upon project implementation plans \nand  targets,  and  their  execution  and  achievement.  For  monitoring  and  measuring  project \nperformance, accurate indicators will be used such as school enrollments; deployment of \nscience teachers to underprivileged regions; examination results including SBA; implementation \nof SBM in target schools, and the extent of school-based training for principals and teachers. \nThe central PMO will monitor project activities, using data and feedback from the provincial \nPMO, and data received from consultants and other institutions such as NETS and NIE. \n \n63.  MOE  will  monitor  and  evaluate  the  outcomes  of  the  Project  after  completion,  in \naccordance with the schedule and terms of reference to be agreed, upon by the Government \nand ADB. Performance evaluations will examine the impact of project interventions: (i) bringing \nschools below the baseline conditions up to the accepted standard; (ii) improving science labs, \nactivity rooms, and libraries; (iii) providing ICT resources to schools in rural and conflict-affected \nareas; (iv) deploying more science teachers to rural areas; (v) supporting the start-up of SMC; \nand (vi) developing a cadre of zonal facilitators in each zone.  \n \n9.  Project Review \n64.  ADB and the Government will conduct a semiannual review of project performance. The \nreview will include an examination of the budgetary allocations, operation and maintenance \ncosts, staffing and other incremental requirement costs, implementation arrangements, and \nachievements under the Project. The review includes assessing progress in each component, \nidentifying difficulties and constraints, and determining ways to overcome them. \n \n65.  The Government and ADB will jointly conduct a midterm review during the third year of \nimplementation.  The  review  will  (i)  review  the  scope,  design,  and  project  implementation \narrangements;  (ii)  evaluate  pilot  programs;  (iii)  assess  performance  against  targets  and \nbenchmarks; (iv) review lessons and experiences in secondary education development focusing \non SBA, SBM, infrastructure and facilities development, school development planning, and \nteaching  and  learning  methods;  (v)  review  compliance  with  the  loan  agreement;  and  (vi) \nrecommend changes in project implementation if required.  \n   ", "17 \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits  \n \n66.  Educational Benefits. The Project will directly benefit approximately 1,100 type 1AB \nand 1C schools that have not benefited from external assistance in the past. The Project will \nbenefit around 200,000 grade 10\u201313 secondary school students each year. In addition, other \nstudents in these schools will benefit from improvements in school facilities, enhanced school \nmanagerial capacity, and more motivated teachers. The total school population that will benefit \nfrom the Project is approximately 825,000 students per year from 2005\u20132009. The students in \nthe 1,100 schools will benefit from improved teaching methods, continuous assessment of their \nlearning  by  teachers,  modern  school  libraries,  improved  access  to  science  and  technical \nsubjects,  improved  career  guidance  services,  relevant  subject-specific  software  in  three \nlanguages, and a more practical orientation to the curriculum. Students in all 2,300 secondary \nschools will benefit from system-wide support to devolve education management; reform of the \nassessment system; modernized curriculum; and enhanced capacity of provincial, zonal, and \ndivisional offices in education planning, management, and monitoring. Furthermore, the 800 \nschools supported by the SEMP will continue to benefit from the Project through training, \nmonitoring and technical assistance.  \n \n67.  Social Benefit and Impact on Peace Building, Reconciliation, and Social Cohesion. \nRecognizing the importance of addressing social disparities in peace-building situations, the \nProject will help improve equity of access to quality secondary education by creating better \neducational opportunities for students in disadvantaged areas. It will support peace building by \npromoting  and  facilitating  interethnic  understanding  and  social  cohesion  in  the  education \nsystem, through initiatives, such as: (i) recruiting Tamil-speaking ICT technicians to help schools \nin the north-east implement their ICT programs; (ii) ensuring that at least 25% of the zonal \nfacilitators are Tamil speaking; (iii) supporting NIE in the development of civics curricula that \npromotes intercultural understanding and reconciliation; (iv) requiring the zonal facilitators to \nprovide school-based training in teaching approaches that foster understanding between ethnic \ngroups; (v) promoting the learning of English as a link language by providing English as a \nsecond language educational software; (vi) promoting the use of three languages in the CLCs \nby  providing  subject-specific  software  in  English,  Sinhala,  and  Tamil;  and  (viii)  recruiting \ntrilingual provincial project managers. A detailed description on the impact on peace building, \nreconciliation, and social cohesion is in Appendix 11.  \n \n68.  Impact  on  Poverty  and  Gender  Mainstreaming.  The  Project  will  yield  particular \nbenefits for students in disadvantaged and conflict-affected areas by focusing on upgrading all \ntarget schools that are below the acceptable baseline conditions . Fifty percent of the target \nschools are located in the poorest seven districts6 and the north-east region. The Project will \nensure benefits to poor students by providing stipends to 48,000 students. The Project will \ncontribute to increased O- and A-level pass rates in the most disadvantaged areas, which in \nturn  will  lead  to  greater  income  opportunities.  Gender-based  stereotypes  in  secondary \neducation will be addressed through awareness raising at all levels.  \n \n69.  Economic Benefit and Financial Sustainability. Economic benefits of the investment \nin  secondary  education  can  be  measured  by  potential  increases  in  wages  due  to  higher \neducational achievement of the graduates.  The Government is committed to improving  the \nquality of secondary education, and increasing its efficiency to meet requirements of the labor \n                                                 \n6 Those are the districts of Badulla, Hambantota, Kegalle, Kurunegala, Matale, Monaragala, and Ratnapura, which \nhave more than 30% of poor households according to the Department of Census and Statistic\u2019s survey in 2002.  ", "18 \nmarket. A system-wide upgrade, with a special focus on minimizing educational disparities \nacross regions is expected to contribute to an increase in the pass rates at O and A levels. The \nProject will also respond to the Government\u2019s strategy to modernize the secondary curriculum \nwith an emphasis on science and technology, English, and ICT; and a practical orientation that \nmeets labor market demand. An improvement in the pass rate of O and A levels, and a more \npractical orientation will lead to better employment and income perspectives.   \n \n70.   The Government has provided free formal education from primary to university since the \nmid-1940s. The general education budget has averaged 83.5% for recurrent expenditure and \n16.5% for capital expenditure.  The project cost will be equivalent to about 25% of the total \ncapital budget from the second year to the rest of the project life. This will have minimum impact \non the total capital budget. The Project minimizes capital investment in new buildings, but \nupgrades or rehabilitates existing facilities. Beneficiaries are expected to contribute in-kind labor \nfor rehabilitation work. The Government has given assurance that it will provide operation and \nmaintenance costs after the implementation period for certain activities initiated and facilities \nprovided by the Project. The incremental recurrent cost for 7 years after project completion is \nestimated at approximately 0.3 % of the annual total general education budget, or 2.2 to 3% of \nthe annual capital budget, and is considered sustainable. The Project includes measures to \nincrease ownership of the schools and build their capacity for cost recovery. A summary \neconomic and financial analysis is in Appendix 12.  \n \nB.  Project Risks  \n \n71.  Sustainability of Project Investment. The SEMP and GEP 2 demonstrate that facilities \nsuch as computers, multimedia units, or modern science laboratories will not be used and \nsustained  if  the  Project  fails  to  ensure  (i)  adequate  teaching  staff;  (ii)  up-front capacity \ndevelopment of end-users and beneficiaries; and (iii) commitment and ownership of province, \nzone, division, and school stakeholders. Moreover, the schools are expected to build cost-\nrecovery system for the CLCs. However, schools in poor communities may not be able to self-\nsustain. Innovations such as SBA and SBM need a continuing process of capacity development \nand monitoring before they can be integrated into the system. The Government has given \nassurance that it will finance incremental recurrent cost for 7 years after project completion. \nExternal factors such as political change and changes in project management may affect \nsustainability of the Project.   \n \n72.  Decentralization. The Government is committed to decentralizing education and SBM. \nHowever, accelerated decentralization may bring resistance and misunderstanding about the \nconcept of decentralization and SBM, and fail to secure stakeholder commitment. Stakeholders \nmay not have the capacity to implement decentralization. The Project gives greater roles to \nzonal offices to facilitate and monitor school activities. However, developing the appropriate \ninstitutional framework will be crucial to supporting the zonal and divisional stakeholders to \nassume new functions. A decentralized management system would also entail a strong and \ntransparent accountability mechanism  \n \n73.  Social and Environmental Measures. The Project does not foresee any significant \nadverse social impact, and will ensure benefits across ethnic groups to mitigate any risk of \nexacerbating ethnic tensions. However, project interventions in target schools located in the \nconflict-affected areas may be affected by the conditions of the peace process. Selective inputs \nof modern education facilities may cause disparities among schools with different levels of \nabsorptive capacity. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 13 and \nthe summary ethnic minority development framework in Appendix 14. Civil work for construction ", "19 \nof  new  classrooms  and  laboratories  will  be  minimal;  no  adverse  environment  impact  is \nanticipated. The impact of such construction work on individual and communal properties has \nbeen  reviewed.  No  individuals/households  will  be  displaced.  Supplementary  Appendix  I \nprovides a resettlement framework.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n74.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which form the basis for the covenants incorporated in the Loan Agreement: \n \n(i)  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  ensure  MOE \nestablishes a complaint investigation and resolution mechanism within MOE\u2019s \nInternal Auditors Department;   \n(ii)  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will have obtained a letter \nof commitment from each provincial council agreeing to implement the Project in \ntheir respective province and agreeing to implement the terms and conditions of \nthe Loan Agreement to the extent within their responsibility; \n(iii)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will ensure each zone to \nprovide a letter of agreement and acknowledgement to each provincial council \nagreeing to implement the Project in their respective zone and to carry out the \nactivities requested by the provincial council; \n(iv)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will prepare a review and \nsynthesis of its policy on decentralization in education, and develop a series of \naction plans for implementing decentralization of education.

Education in Sri Lanka is free in government schools (94% of schools) and in state-run \ntertiary educational institutions. Some achievements of the Sri Lankan education system are \nremarkable. Sri Lanka\u2019s literacy rate of 92% is one of the highest in Asia, and enrolment in \nprimary level schooling is 95%. Females make up around 50% of the total student population.  \n \n2.  The general education system of Sri Lanka comprises four stages: the primary (grades \n1\u20135), junior secondary (grades 6\u20139), and senior secondary consisting of the ordinary level (O-\nlevel) (grades 10\u201311), and the advanced level (A-level) (grades 12\u201313). The education system \nconsists of four different types of schools:  \n(i)  Type 1AB: cover the education cycle from grades 1\u201313, or grades 6-13 in some \ncases , and offer the full curriculum for the A-level, including arts, commerce, and \nscience; \n(ii)  Type 1C: cover the education cycle from grades 1\u201313, or grades 6-13 in some \ncases,  but offer only arts and commerce for the A-level; \n(iii)  Type  2:  cover  grades  1\u201311,  and  prepare  students  for  the  GCE  O-level \nexamination at grade 11; and \n(iv)  Type 3: cover the primary education (grades 1\u20135) or up to grades 1\u20138. \n \n3.  Currently about 10,000 government schools enroll approximately 4 million students. \nAmong those, 323 national schools (either 1AB or 1C) are directly administered by the Ministry \nof Education (MOE), while the rest are administered by the  provincial education authorities. \nMore than 2,300 1AB and 1C schools and 4,200  type 2 schools enroll 0.98 million senior \nsecondary students. Type 1AB schools are generally located in prosperous urban areas. Type \n1C schools are normally situated in poorer urban and semi-urban areas. Type 2 and 3 schools \nare usually found in rural and remote areas.  Approximately 75% of all schools are Sinhala-\nlanguage and 25% are Tamil. However, the proportion varies across districts. In the Northern \nand Eastern  provinces, 98% and 74% of schools are  Tamil speaking, respectively.  In the \nCentral Province, Nuwara Eliya District also has a high percentage of Tamil-language schools \n(57%). \n \nB.  Inequities in Access to Effective Secondary Education \n \n4.  The single biggest problem facing the secondary education system of Sri Lanka is the \nlack of universal access to effective secondary education.  Among the 25 districts, the most \nadvantaged  districts  with  respect  to  offering  senior  secondary  education  are  Colombo, \nGampaha, Galle, Jaffna, Kandy, and Kurunegala. At the other end of the scale, the most \ndisadvantaged  districts  in  providing  access  to  senior  secondary  education  are  Vavuniya, \nMullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Polonnaruwa, Nuwara Eliya, and Monaragala. \n \n5.  The extent of the overall problem of inequitable access to effective secondary education \ncan be appreciated by considering Figure A2. The availability of effective secondary education \nis affected by (i) the area in which the student lives, whether rural, conflict affected, and so on; \n(ii)  the  income  level  of  the  parents,  which  affects  their  ability  to  supplement  their  child\u2019s \neducation with private tuition, or their ability to send the child away to a better school than those \navailable in the immediate vicinity of the home; and (iii) ethnicity, since typically materials are \ninitially produced in Sinhala, and the translations sometimes reach the Tamil community late, \nare not of good quality.  ", "                       Appendix 2  2 7\n \n6.  The distribution of qualified teachers across the country is inequitable, as the national \nteacher  transfer  policy,  which  allocates  teachers  equitably,  has  not  been  implemented \neffectively. Acute imbalances exist between urban and rural, and between Sinhala- and Tamil-\nspeaking schools. A shortage of trained teachers exists for all subjects in Tamil schools, except \nin grades 6\u201311 in the Western and Southern provinces. In Kilinochchi, over 35% of the teachers \nin the government school system are trainees, in Mullaitivu, nearly 30%. In five more districts, \ni.e., Mannar, Vavuniya, Batticaloa, Nuwara Eliya and Jaffna, from 1 to 2 of every 10 teachers \nare trainees.  \n \n7.  Many secondary schools lack even the most basic facilities and infrastructure, and the \nfacilities are not conducive to stimulating and effective teaching and learning. Many classrooms \nare  overcrowded,  and  do  not  support  activity-based  learning.  Water  and  sanitation  are \nsometimes not available. Some schools do not have proper classrooms, or even partitioned \nareas, teachers or students have no storage areas to lock away their personal belongings. \nMany schools have an inadequately stocked or staffed library, or no library at all.  \n \n8.  All senior secondary schools must teach science and technology and one or more \ntechnical subjects to the O-level. Therefore, all schools are required to have an activity room to \nsupport the acquisition of technical skills, activity-based learning, and practical work; and a \ngeneral science laboratory to support the science and technology  O-level. However, many \nschools have not been provided with activity rooms and sufficient equipment, and are unable to \nundertake a meaningful study of even the most popular technical subjects. Where facilities exist, \nthey are often out of date or poorly maintained. \n \nC.  Education Management and School-Based Management \n \n9.  The 13th Amendment to the Constitution in 1987 and the Provincial Councils Act No. 42 \nof 1987 devolved many functions of educational administration and decision-making authorities \nto the provincial education authorities, consisting of the provincial ministries and departments of \neducation. In 1991, the National Education Commission was established as the highest body to \nformulate education policies. While MOE still holds the overall planning and implementation \nresponsibility for general education and administers specific schools, including national schools, \nspecial schools for service personnel, and schools for specific development schemes, the \nprovincial education authorities  have become responsible for administering all state schools \nother than  the specific schools noted. Below the  provincial ministries and departments of \neducation are zonal and divisional education offices,  which are responsible for day-to-day \nschool administration, implementation of education policies, and monitoring schools.  \n \n10.  The current provincial system has been by and large settled after going through a few \nadjustments, but it is often criticized that the complex system with multiple layers has created \nunclear lines of command and duplication of functions at different levels. Moreover, inadequate \nhuman and financial resources at zonal and  divisional levels have hindered development of \neffective monitoring and evaluation functions. Thus, MOE recognizes the importance of these \noffices and has initiated certain activities to strengthen them. For instance, it trained zonal and \n \ndivisional officers in zonal planning for the secondary education development.  \n \n11.  Education  financing,  particularly  the  management  of  capital  budget,  is  still  highly \n \ncentralized, but has been gradually  decentralized in recent years. In 2000, the  Government \nintroduced an education capital budget for provinces. In addition, the Government introduced a \ndirect funding mechanism for schools to be responsible for managing and procuring education   \n ", "28 Appendix 2 \nquality inputs  at the schools. Though schools  have required some time  to adopt the new \nmechanism, and/or some schools have felt the new responsibility as a burden, the introduction \nof quality inputs is generally appreciated by schools as they are now allowed to identify and \nprocure materials according to their needs in classrooms. \n \n12.  The Government has made various efforts to decentralize management authorities to \nschools.  Historically,  most  schools  have  a  functioning  school  development  society,  which \ngenerally supports  the  school  by  providing  financial  and  labor  contributions.  The  school \ndevelopment boards Act No. 8 was introduced in 1993, in which the school development boards \nwere tasked to advise and assist the principal in matters connected with the development of the \nschool, including maintaining the school development fund. The act was abolished in 1995, as it \nfaced resistance from certain stakeholders, including those who feared that an introduction of \nthe school development boards might lead to privatization of government schools. \n \n13.  In 2001 a school-based management (SBM) handbook for principals was drafted. It \nproposed establishment of the school management board/council, with functions similar to those \nfor the school development boards proposed earlier. Although the handbook was not finalized \nthen,  the  current  Government  has  resumed  the  process  of  promoting  SBM,  including \nestablishing a national consensus on the concept of SBM. MOE has also commenced a pilot \nproject on SBM with 10 selected schools, and is planning to expand it with another group of \nschools. This is a critical time for the  Government to establish a national consensus, and to \ngradually implement the SBM policy across the country. \n \nD.  Reform of Assessment Systems  \n \n14.  The Sri Lankan secondary education is an examination-dominated system that every \nyear fails to produce an acceptable pass rate among students. This applies both at O- and A-\nlevel. At the O-level, only 40% qualify for A-level, and only 30% qualify for science A-levels by \ngaining a credit pass in O-level science and technology. This partly explains why only around \n22%  of  Sri  Lankan  A-level students take the sciences. The low pass rate in science and \ntechnology also arises from disparities in the availability of properly trained science teachers, \nlaboratories, and the equipment needed to support technical subjects. Two other compulsory \nsubjects have even higher failure rates (mathematics, at around 50% failing, and English \nlanguage, with nearly 70% failing annually). All three subjects have been made compulsory at \nthe O-level, but all three have not been given the support, in terms of teacher training and \ndevelopment, and teaching and learning resources, required to ensure they can be effectively \ntaught. At the A-level, only around 40% of students qualify for university, but only about 10% of \nthem gain places, as the capacity of the Sri Lankan state university is so small. This means that \nonly 2% of the 20\u201325 age group are in university.  \n \n15.  The examination domination and lack of practical orientation have led to the realization \nof the need for continuous assessment that includes practical work, projects, and assignments. \nThus, in 2001, the school based assessment (SBA) system has been brought into the O-level \ncurriculum, and now SBA marks are displayed on the O-level certificate. SBA is currently being \nbrought into the A-level syllabus. However, the public perceives that schools are not competent \nto effectively deliver and mark SBA. Therefore, the  National Examination and Testing Service \nbelieve that it is too early to integrate SBA marks into examination results. Instead, other \nbenefits, such as considering the SBA grades when selecting students for technical colleges or \nfor a professional program, may be more effective. This would raise people\u2019s expectations and \nfaith in SBA and pave the way for SBA  marks to be integrated in the existing examination \nsystem.

", "32 Appendix 4 \nSCHOOL RESOURCE ALLOCATION PROCEDURE AND FUNDING FORMULA \n \nThe  targets  schools  will  be  categorized  into  several  groups  and  receive  various  support \naccording to needs and priorities. Procedures for school resource allocation and funding formula \nare described here.  \n \nA.  Participatory School Needs Analysis and School Selection  \n \n1.  The needs analysis survey team from the central project management office (PMO) (the \nsurvey team) will prepare a list of schools that includes student\u2019s enrolment data and the status \nof availability of facilities for each target school, based on the latest (2004) school census data. \nThe survey team will make a list of schools per zone and distribute it to each zonal education \noffice. The survey team will conduct a short training on participatory needs analysis for the zonal \nplanning officers. Then, the zonal planning officers will conduct a workshop for the schools in \ntheir zones on conducting a self needs assessment. Each school will be represented by the \nprincipal, one teacher, and one school development society member. At the end of the workshop, \neach school will have prepared a needs analysis report. The report must incorporate information \non expected support from various sources (North-East Community Restoration and Development \nProject, Small-Scale Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Upgrading Project, quality inputs, others).  \n \n2.  Based on the needs analysis reports from the schools, within one month of loan \neffectiveness, the zonal planning officers will update the zonal list from the school census, and \nconsolidate  the  needs  analysis  reports  from  the  schools.  The  zonal  planning  officers  will \ncompare the needs for each school with the baseline conditions for secondary schools agreed \nunder the Project. The zonal planning officers will propose a priority list for school resource \nallocation together with explanations for the priority list to the provincial PMO. Within two months \nof loan effectiveness, each provincial PMO will review and compare each zonal priority list, and \nprepare a priority list for school resource allocation in its respective province with explanations for \nthe priority list. It will post the priority list in a public place in the provincial PMO. Based on the \nprovincial priority lists, within 4 months of loan effectiveness, the survey team will prepare a draft \nresource allocation list for all target schools and submit it to the Steering Committee for approval. \nWithin six months of loan effectiveness, the draft resource allocation list will be approved by the \nSteering Committee or returned to the PMO for revision. If returned, the survey team will work \nwith the relevant Provincial PMO(s) and zones to submit a revised draft. Once the draft resource \nallocation list has been approved by the Project Steering Committee, the central PMO will inform \neach school of the approved resource allocation list through respective provincial PMO and zonal \neducation offices. The approved resource allocation list should be made available to the public \nby posting it in the PMO, provincial PMO, and zonal education offices. The schools will use the \nresource allocation list as a basis to prepare the school development plan.  \n \nB.  Provision of Computer Learning  Centers and Advance Level (A level) Science \nLaboratory \n \n3.  During the school needs analysis survey, approximately 350 schools will be identified to \nbe provided with a computer learning center (CLC) and information technology training. One \nschool in each of the 292 educational divisions and one more school in 61 divisions that do not \nhave a 1AB school will receive a CLC. Zonal education offices will first decide the number of \nSinhala-language and Tamil-language schools in proportion to the total number of type 1AB/1C \nschools by language of instruction within the zone. \n \n4.  Among the type 1AB/1C schools, those with more than 100 students in grades 10-13 ", "Appendix 4  33\nare eligible for a CLC. Eligible schools must demonstrate, in their school development plan, that \nthey have the financial and management capacity to operate the facilities, including availability of \nteachers who will be in charge of CLC management; and access to electricity. If there are several \ncandidates, schools located in rural areas will be given priority. \n \n5.  Type 1AB schools without a proper A-level science laboratory and type 1C schools that \ncan be upgraded to type 1AB will be given either upgrading or new construction of an A level \nscience laboratory. Prior to the provision of facilities, (i) the central Government (for national \nschools) or provincial councils (for provincial schools) must assure the provision of graduate \nscience teachers; and  (ii) provincial PMOs and  zonal education offices  must analyse the \npotential demand for enrolment in the A-level science stream in those schools. Only schools with \na viable number of students for the A-level science stream will be given the facility.  \n \nC.  Funding Formula for School Development Grants \n \n6.  Based on the latest school census data, each  zonal education office  will categorize \nschools into five groups according to the number of students in grades 10\u201313 and in total (Table \nA4). The list will be compiled at the provincial PMO, and approved by the central PMO. Then, the \ncentral PMO will transfer grants to the project account of each provincial PMO every year.  \n \nTable A4: Funding Criteria for School Development Grants  \nand Computer Learning Center Start-up Operation Costs \nNo. of \nNo. of Students  No. of  Total Grant \nSchools  Students   CLC \n(Grades 10-13)  Schools (est.)

Each group will receive school development grants (SDGs) for 5 years, except for both \ngroups of (i) 40 very large schools and (ii) large schools provided with a CLC (who will receive \nCLC start-up operation costs for the first 2 years). The very large schools will be excluded from \nthe school grant scheme, as they have access to support from other sources. \n \n8.  The SDGs can be used for educational quality inputs as defined by the existing circular,1 \nincluding consumable quality inputs, capital quality inputs, repair and maintenance of capital \ngoods, and external consulting services. In addition, the SDGs can be used for certain supplies, \nworks, and services that are not considered as quality inputs according to the circular. Such \nitems include purchase of school furniture, installation of electricity supply, water supply, and \nrepairs and maintenance of buildings. However, the following items in the negative list of the \nquality inputs also apply to the SDGs: (i) construction of new buildings and additions of buildings; \n(ii) telephone bills, electricity bills,  and water bills;  (iii) purchase of vehicles, maintenance of \nschool vehicles; (iv) establishment services such as security services; and (v) salary payments. \nProcurement procedures at schools will follow the same procedure as that for the quality inputs. \n                                                 \n1 Ministry of Education. 2002.

Overall Management Structure \n \n1.  A feature of the Secondary Education Modernization Project II is the devolution of many \nproject  management  functions  to  the  provinces,  which  in  turn,  devolve  day-to-day  school \nmonitoring to the zones. The Project will install and support a project manager in each provincial \ndepartment of education. Provincial managers will provide strategic guidance and monitor the \nlevels (zonal, divisional and school) below the province. The provincial project management \noffice (PMO) will report to the central PMO. The central PMO will be mainly concerned with \nsupervising the capacity building of the provinces, which, in turn, will supervise the capacity \nbuilding of the zones. The latter will carry out training, mentoring, and supervision in schools, \nreporting back to the provinces to facilitate an effective project monitoring system. \n \nFigure A6 shows the management structure of the Project.  \n  \nF igure A6: The Management Structure of the Secondary Education Modernization Project \nII \n \nSteering Committee \nChair: Secretary, Ministry of \nEducation (MOE) \nAdditional Secretary \nMOE \nNational  Project Management Office (PMO)  National \nExamination  (project  director,  5  specialists,  Institute of \nand Testing  domestic  and  international  Education \nconsultants,  and  administrative \nService \nstaff) \nProvincial PMOs  \n(one provincial project manager  \nand secretary in each province) \nProvincial Offices \nZonal Offices \nSecondary School/Community \n ", "38      Appendix 7                   \nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n \nActivity  Year  Year 1  Year 2  Year 3  Year 4  Year 5 \n0  (2005)  (2006)  (2007)  (2008)  (2009) \n  Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q\n3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4 \nA.

The task of reconstruction after prolonged civil conflict requires an analysis of system \nfailures and conflict impact. An important dimension of civil conflicts is that they create divided \nsocieties. Education plays an important role in postconflict reconstruction, especially in the \nareas of reconciliation and building social cohesion.1  \n \n2.  While education has an important function in reconstruction, failures in the education \nsystem can contribute to conflict situations. In Sri Lanka, both the Sinhalese majority and the \nTamil minority have expressed grievances, past and present, based on relative deprivation of \neducational provision and opportunity. These perceptions of inequality and exclusion have been \ncatalysts of conflict.  \n \n3.  Prior  to  independence,  the  Sinhalese  majority  had  grown  resentful  that  the  Tamil \nminority  was  overrepresented  in  higher  education  and  influential  positions  in  professional \ncareers and civil administration. Nearly a decade after independence, English was still the \nnational  language  and  the  country  continued  to  be  ruled  by  an  English-speaking  elite. \nNationalist sentiment among the Sinhalese majority spurred the drive to elevate the status of \nSinhala to the national language. In 1956, the Sinhala Only Law was enacted, sparking violent \nprotests from the Tamil minority. The Sinhalese-Tamil conflict had its roots in this period of \nemerging resentment and hostility.  \n \n4.  The Standardization Policy of 1971 augmented earlier tensions with its aim of reducing \nthe  number  of  Tamil  students  gaining  entrance  to  universities.  Successive  discriminatory \npolicies in education were paralleled by similar policies in other areas. The growing unrest of the \nearly 1970s turned to violent conflict by the mid 1970s as fighting for an independent Tamil state \nin the north-east (Eelam) began. By the mid 1980a the conflict had spread from the north to \nmuch of the east, and continued for about 20 years. In 2000, a Norwegian team was invited to \ninitiate  negotiations  between  the  Liberation  Tigers  of  Tamil  Eelam  and  the  Government. \nEventually, a cease-fire was reached in late 2001 and peace talks began in 2002. Since then, \ngovernments have shown genuine commitment to the peace process. \n \n5.  Although discriminatory policies in education and elsewhere have been reversed, and \nthe 13th Amendment to the Constitution established Tamil as an official language, along with \nSinhala, society remains deeply divided by language and ethnicity. To avoid reconstructing the \nsystem  of  exclusion  that  preceded  the  conflict,  these  issues  must  be  addressed  when \nconsidering education reform. \n \n6.  Incorporating  these  themes  in  the  design  of  education  projects,  addresses  the \ninternational community\u2019s commitment, expressed in para. 8 (v) of the Dakar Framework for \nAction, to \u201cmeet the needs of education systems affected by conflict, natural calamities, and \ninstability; and conduct educational programs in ways that promote mutual understanding, \npeace, and tolerance, and that help to prevent violence and conflict. \n \n7.  A  holistic  approach  to  peace  building  and  postconflict  reconstruction  includes  four \nessential  themes:  security,  governance,  economic  recovery,  and  social  stability  and \ndevelopment.  The  last  theme,  social  stability  and  development,  is  the  central  focus  of \nreconstructing education (footnote 1). Three key aspects are involved: (i) rebuilding the physical \ninfrastructure of the education system, including buildings and supplies; (ii) regenerating human \ncapacity of teachers, administrators, and school communities; and (iii) strengthening social \n                                                 \n1 Colleta. 2003. Conflict and  Development , What Are We Reconstructing? Paris.  ", "48 Appendix 11 \ncapital  by  addressing  curriculum  content.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  reconstruction, \nreconciliation, and social cohesion by focusing on these aspects in its inputs. \n \nA.  Rebuilding the Physical Infrastructure \n \n8.  At the time of the conflict, education was disrupted by the closure of schools. Nearly \n25% of schools in the north and east were closed, while 25.5% functioned in displaced locations \nwith makeshift arrangements.2 Furthermore, 15,000 classrooms in 500 schools are reported to \nbe fully or partially damaged. Libraries, laboratories, offices, electricity, water, and sanitation \nfacilities were also damaged.  \n \n9.  The condition of these schools and those in other impoverished areas is a source of \ndivision and exacerbates grievances among the affected communities. The Project aims to \naddress this issue by improving access to quality education facilities for students from rural and \nunderprivileged areas by upgrading the infrastructure and facilities of its target schools to a \ndefined baseline standard. The Project places emphasis on supporting those secondary schools \nthat have not received assistance from earlier projects.   \n \n10.  During field visits to schools in the north-east, principals invariably articulated concerns \nabout inadequate facilities, including classrooms, toilets, and electricity. Equity of access in \ncomponent 1 is concerned with ensuring that there quality education facilities are distributed \nequitably in the country. The baseline was designed to ensure that disadvantaged secondary \nschools receive essential  resources for offering the required O-level subjects in the curriculum.  \n \nB.  Regenerating Human Capacity \n \n11.  A crucial shortage of teachers exists in the north-east; this was emphasized by all \nschools visited. Compounding this situation is an influx of children due mainly to returning \ninternally displaced people. The number of school-aged students in the north-east is expected \nto increase by one third to approximately 866,000 by 2007.3 This will increase the demand for \nqualified  teachers  substantially.  The  shortage  of  teachers  in  disadvantaged  areas  is  a \nconsiderable barrier to equitable provision of secondary education to disadvantaged minority \ngroups. In this regard, the Project will seek assurance that the Government is committed to \nimplementing an equitable and effective transfer policy.  \n \n12.  The Project will ensure that target schools receive equitable benefits in terms of support \nfrom zonal trainers, provincial project managers, and capable teachers in the required medium \nof instruction. These strategies are particularly concerned with providing adequate education in \nareas  deemed  critical  for  more  lucrative  employment\u2014a  major  issue  for  disadvantaged \nsecondary school-aged youth. This is a key issue for future conflict avoidance, particularly \nbecause both the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in the north and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna \n(People\u2019s Liberation Army) in the south drew support primarily from disaffected youth. \n \nC.  Strengthening Social Capital \n \n13.  This aspect of reconstruction is concerned with reasserting the socialization and value-\nforming functions of schooling. This entails developing curriculum content and teaching methods \ncommensurate with the goal of shared values, social cohesion, and inclusive institutions. In this \n                                                 \n2  Ministry of Education. 2001. School Census.

The \nProject  will  also  require  the  zonal  training  specialists  to  provide  school-based training in \nteaching approaches that foster greater understanding between language/ethnic groups. It will \nalso promote training on student-focused teaching approaches and school-based assessment \nthat brings a more practical orientation into teaching-learning activities. \n \n14.  Other agencies have done extensive work in the area of peace building. The United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund has produced resources for teachers through its Education for Conflict \nResolution program. The Government of Germany has also incorporated concepts of peace \nbuilding and social cohesion into its teacher education program. The Project will coordinate with \nother agencies to reinforce their efforts and avoid duplication in production of materials.  \n \n15.  During the field visits, some schools reported activities with \u201dfamily schools\u201d as part of a \nprogram initiated by the provincial government to promote interschool activities among Sinhala \nand Tamil schools with a view to fostering understanding and tolerance. While this initiative \nmakes an important contribution to peace-building, several schools were not aware of these \ninitiatives, although they were participating in some interschool sporting events.  \n \n16.  The Project will also strike a balance between two important aspects of strengthening \nsocial capital in postconflict situations. The Project makes a point of providing its curriculum \nmaterials to separate language groups to achieve equity. Although this may be viewed as \nreinforcing  division  along  language  and  ethnic  lines,  it  is  unavoidable  from  an  equity \nperspective, at least at the outset until broader language acquisition is attained. Until that time, \nthe Project addresses the potential negative effects by promoting English as a link language, \nwithin a more inclusive curriculum. \n \nD.  Risks \n \n17.  The  roots  of  conflict  are  bound  up  with  inequality  and  the  perception  of  relative \ndeprivation among individuals and groups. The most obvious risk for the Project is that of \nexacerbating  disparities  between  schools  with  selective  inputs  of  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT) equipment. While the first priority of the Project is to bring \ndisadvantaged schools up to the baseline, the Project is also sensitive to the Government\u2019s \ndesire to modernize the secondary education system with the injection of ICT. However, not all \nschools have the capacity to absorb ICT inputs.  \n \n18.  To satisfy both aspects of the Government\u2019s vision of modernizing secondary education \nwithout exacerbating disparities, the Project will ensure that all ethnic groups gain access to \nquality secondary education inputs. The Project will maintain an ethnic balance by expanding \nthe Project to schools in the north-east and in plantation areas where Tamils and Muslims \npredominate. While the provision of ICT on a selective basis may create disparity, the Project is \ntaking measures to avoid the perception of deprivation by balancing its selection process. \n \n19.  The  Project  carefully  considers  the  important  role  of  education  in  peace  building, \nreconciliation, and social cohesion. Its emphasis on equitable access to quality secondary \neducation in disadvantaged areas should have a positive impact on reversing perceptions of \nrelative deprivation and exclusion. \n \n20.   Efforts to resolve the conflict may fail. If the conflict returns to the north east, school \nrenovation in the area will be difficult. Nevertheless, the other peace-enhancing activities of the \nProject will continue.   ", "50   Appendix 12   \n                                                                                    \n   \nSUMMARY ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Project Objectives and Economic Rationale \n \n1.  While Sri Lanka has achieved high enrolments in primary (95%) and lower secondary \neducation (85%) and a high literacy rate (92%), the Government has been concerned with the \nquality of secondary education.  The Proposals for a National Policy Framework on General \nEducation in Sri Lanka prepared by the National Education Commission in 2003 pointed out that \na dearth of science, mathematics, and information and communication technology (ICT)-qualified \npersonnel in the job market is keeping the economy from expanding into new and demanding \nareas. To improve the quality of  secondary education and meet the job market demands, \nlaboratory,  basic  information  and  communication  technology  facilities,  teaching-learning \nresources, teachers\u2019 teaching skills, and principals\u2019 managerial capacities need to be improved. \n \n2.  The Project will help the Government implement this policy by providing target schools \n(approximately 1,100 1AB and 1C schools) with computers, information technology facilities, A- \nand  O-level  science  laboratories,  multimedia/library  rooms,  and  activity  rooms  along  with \nnecessary furniture and equipment. Not all of these facilities will be equally distributed to the \nentire  target  schools,  but  the  Project  will  begin  by  carefully  examining  the  viability  and \nneeds/requirements of each school during the initial needs analysis study. For instance, the \nProject will provide a new A-level science laboratory only for viable 1C schools to be upgraded to \n1AB, for which the Government assures a supply of appropriate teachers.1 Target schools in the \nProject  that  will  not  be  provided  with  full  facilities  and  equipment  will  be  given  school \ndevelopment grants, which they can utilize according to their needs and priorities. All target \nschools  will  also  benefit  from  receiving  school-based  management/school-based  assessment \ntraining, career counseling resources,  an  O-level science laboratory equipment kit, various \nteaching-learning resources, and supports from zonal training specialists thereby ensuring that \nthe quality of the secondary education is improved in all target schools.  \n \n3.  The O-level pass rate has significantly improved in the last 10 years from 19.5% in 1995 \nto 37.0% in 2000, and 41.0% in 2002. Beginning in 2002 a credit for school-based assessment \nbecame a part of the A-level qualification, which enabled about 5,000 more students to qualify for \nA-level and increased the overall pass rate by 1.6% in 2002. Based on this trend, one of the \nproject goals\u2014to increase the O-level pass rate to 60% by 2009\u2014is an achievable target with \nthe new investment by the Project. In addition to the improvement of the overall O-level pass rate, \nthe Project aims to improve the percentage of students participating in the A-level science stream \nfrom 22% to 35%. An increase in students studying in the A-level science stream will help meet \nthe needs of the job market, which demands a workforce with scientific/technical expertise. \n \n4.  The economic benefits of the investment in secondary education can be measured by \npotential increases in wages due to higher educational achievement of the graduates. When \nemployees over 15 years are grouped by level of education and wages,2 the wage differential \nbetween those who passed O-level and those who did not is estimated at SLRs21,612 ($216)3 \nper year for 2001, and between those who passed A-level and those who did not at SLRs9,852 \n($99) per year. Because one wage figure for the entire group of grades 1\u201310 is so broad, the first \n                                                 \n1 According to the National Education Commission proposals, only about 450 out of 600 1AB schools have viable \nA-level science classes, mainly due to low number of students or teachers (p. 159).  \n2 Labour Market Information Bulletin, Vol. 21/2002. Table 1.15, p. 13. \n3 Estimated as a weighted average with an assumption that an average wage for each wage category is SLRs2,000, \nSLRs3,000, SLRs5,000, SLRs7,000, and SLRs10,000, respectively. Monthly figures are multiplied by 12.  At \nexchange rate of SLRs100 = $1. \n ", "Appendix 12    51\ncomparison probably overestimates the impact of passing the O-level. Furthermore, figures for \nthe wage differential are highly sensitive to the assumption for the average wage level for the \nhighest income group. Thus, the wage differentials may be bigger or smaller than the estimates. \n \n5.  Another wage statistic is available from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey \n2002. Annual wage differentials between grades 6\u20139 and O-level achievers and between O-level \nand  A-level achievers are  SLRs46,608 ($466) and  SLRs43,740 ($437), respectively. These \nfigures are much higher than those estimated in para. 4. Whichever figures are used however, \nthe higher the education level, the higher is the wage level. \n \n6.  Based on this data, annual wage gains per student by passing O-level and A-level range \nfrom $150\u2013470 and $100\u2013440, respectively. These wide ranges make a calculation of the \ninternal rate of return (IRR) on the investment difficult, as the rate is highly sensitive to the wage \nfigures. To estimate the minimum impact of the Project, the lowest wage gains, i.e., $150 for \nO-level achievers and $100 for A-level achievers, are used as the base of the calculation (para. \n7). The impact of the Project on the improvement of O- and A-level pass rates is another \nsensitive variable for calculation of the rate of return. Three cases\u2014(i) high improvement (60%), \n(ii) moderate improvement (55%), and (iii) low improvement (50%) in the O-level and A-level \npass rates\u2014are analyzed.  \n \n7.  To calculate the IRR, the Project\u2019s impact is assumed to appear in the second year of \nthe project implementation. Second, because the Project directly covers only about 1,100 of \n2,300 1AB and 1C schools and no type 2 schools, which enroll O-level students, 30% of the \nimprovement in the O-level rates is assumed to be due to the Project. As for the A-level pass \nrates, for which only type 1AB and 1C schools are relevant, 40% of the improvement is assumed \nto be due to the Project. Other assumptions include a 1 year time lag between the completion of \nO- or A-level  and  employment, 10% unemployment among the O- and A-level achievers, \nconstant real wage differentiations throughout their employment periods (43 years (17\u201360) for \nO-level achievers and 41 years (19\u201360) for A-level achievers), and 7 years of continuous impact \nof the Project\u2019s investment after the implementation period. To sustain the Project\u2019s impact, the \nfollowing incremental recurrent costs are expected to be borne annually by the Government and \nbeneficiaries during the implementation and for 7 years after the Project: 200 teacher incentives \n($240 per  teacher), 100 graduates with National Diploma in Information and Communication \nTechnology ($800 per graduate), 450 zonal facilitator allowances ($480 per facilitator), 12,000 \nstipends for O- and A-level students in rural areas ($50/student per year), and operation and \nmaintenance for school facilities for 1,000 schools ($300 per school) by the Government, and \noperation costs for 350 computer learning center (CLCs) ($720 per CLC) by the beneficiaries.  \n \n8.  Under these assumptions, the Project is estimated to yield an IRR of 13%, even when \nimprovement in the O- and A-level pass rates is low. The IRR goes up to 19% when pass rates \nimprove moderately, and 22% improvement is high. An increase in the wage differentials will also \nsignificantly improve the IRR. For instance, an increase in wages by passing O-level from $150 \nto $200 will improve the IRR from 13 to 19% even in the low improvement case. \n \nB.  Beneficiaries \n \n9.  The educational facilities and equipment provided by the Project are expected to be \nused not only by secondary students in the selected target schools, but also by more junior \nstudents  in  the  same  schools,  students  in  neighboring  schools,  and  school  leavers  and \ncommunity members. Although the Project is not able to provide an equal amount of facilities to \nall of the target schools, in the interest of equity, the Project will ensure that each division has at \nleast one 1AB school, where possible, or at least one well-equipped 1C school. Thus, 61 of the \n ", "52   Appendix 12   \n                                                                                    \n   \n292 divisions in the country that currently do not have even a single 1AB school will be given \npriority.  The  Project  will  also  provide  scholarships  for  students  who  live  in  areas  with no \nfully-equipped 1AB or 1C school nearby. A-level qualified students from type 2 schools are also \neligible for the scholarships. \n \n10.  The direct beneficiaries of the Project are secondary school students, primarily those in \nrural and disadvantaged areas. In addition, other stakeholders will benefit from the Project such \nas community members, teachers, principals, in-service advisors, and zonal/provincial/central \nofficers through various training and professional development programs. The Project will utilize \nas many existing teacher and government cadres as possible to make the project benefits more \nsustainable. At the same time, the Project will enlist some special school support programs and \nincentives to support the initial activities during the first stage of the Project.  In addition, the \nProject will provide an incentive program for teachers to mitigate the severe teacher shortages in \nrural areas, to ensure that the expected benefits reach disadvantaged schools. These secondary \nbeneficiaries are expected to help improve the existing school system for the secondary school \nstudents, in more efficient and effective ways. \n \nC.

The growth of Sri Lanka\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) averaged 5.3% between \n1991 and 2000, decreased to minus 0.37% in 2001, and recovered to 4.0% in 2002. Per capita \n ", "Appendix 12    53\nGDP was SLRs83,382 ($871) in 2002. Government education expenditure was 2.7% of GDP \nand 9.4% of the total government expenditure between 1988 and 2001. From 1999\u20132004, 80.0\u2013 \n83.4% of the total education budget was allocated to general education. The low education \nexpenditures in recent years  run counter to  the policy stipulated in the General Education \nReforms prepared by the Presidential Task Force in 1997, and the policy recommendation made \nby  the  National  Education  Commission in 2003\u2014that the  Government increase education \nexpenditures to above 5% of GDP. However, with severe budget constraints, the Government \nmay not be able to drastically increase the education budget to 5% of GDP in the near future. \n \n12.  Table A12 summarizes the general education expenditure in Sri Lanka, and shows the \nmagnitude of foreign-funded projects and foreign grants and the impact of the Project on the \ngovernment budget. The Government has shifted its funding sources from domestic to foreign \nfunds in recent years, mainly to implement the 1997 General Education Reforms. After the \ngradual implementation of the Project in the first year (2005), the impacts of the Project on the \nGovernment education budget will be equivalent to about 25% of the total capital budget in the \nsecond year, leaving plenty of room for other foreign development agencies to contribute. The \nproject inputs will remain roughly constant from the year 2 to year 4. Thus the budgetary impact \nof the Project on the total education capital budget is readily within the recent trend. \n \n13.  The Project is designed to minimize capital investment in new buildings and facilities. \nInstead it will upgrade or rehabilitate existing classrooms, laboratories, and multimedia/library \nrooms; and convert available rooms into other functional rooms. Parents and communities are \nexpected to contribute in-kind labor for construction and upgrading of facilities. During project \nimplementation and for  7 years after the Project, the  Government is expected to provide \nincremental recurrent costs for certain activities that the Project has initiated and facilities \nprovided as discussed in the calculation of IRR. The total annual costs are estimated at $1.244 \nmillion a year, which is equivalent to approximately 0.3 % of the annual total general education \nbudget, or 2.2 to 3.5 % of the annual capital budget in recent years, and is a sustainable level.  \n \n14.  The Project is designed to encourage parents, graduates, and community members to \ncontribute to the operational cost of the CLCs, activity rooms, and science laboratories supplied \nby the Project. Schools are expected to open the CLCs to communities and school leavers, and \nto collect user fees as a part of cost recovery. Their participation in financing school facilities is \nexpected to enhance ownership of the project benefits and to ensure the sustainable utilization \nof  the  facilities  even  after  project  implementation.  Reports  from  the  on-going  Secondary \nEducation Modernization Project indicate that some of the CLCs provided by have collected user \nfees, while many others have not mainly due to the existing regulatory constrains. Very recently \nthe Ministry of Education approved a circular to institute necessary regulations, and the schools \nare expected to gradually start collecting user fees. However, schools may require some time to \nestablish a sustainable cost-recovery system. The Project will provide CLC recipient schools \nwith initial operating costs to run the CLCs during the first 2 years. To promote and encourage \nschools to adopt cost-recovery/sustainability measures, the Project will provide special training \nto  the  target  schools  on  how  to  develop  partnerships  with  the  private  sector  and  other \nprospective supporters in the community. \n \n15.  In summary, the Project is expected to yield an adequate return on the investment, and \nis designed to provide lasting benefits. It has many unquantifiable but important educational and \nsocial benefits. The Project promises to ensure equity of access to and quality of the secondary \neducation by prioritizing the distribution of physical and human resources to rural schools and \nstudents in disadvantaged areas. The impacts of the project costs on the Government budget \nduring and after the implementation are feasible and easily within recent trends.  \n ", " 54          Appendix 13 \n \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n  \nA.

No \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka: \n \nThe overall goals of the Sri Lankan Government are to modernize the economy and enrich the labor \nmarket through a flexible education system, with particular emphasis on minimizing differences across \nregions, and reducing the disadvantages experienced in poor rural areas, and the conflicted affected \nareas.  The  2000  report  of  the  Government (A Framework for Poverty Reduction) proposes that the \ndevelopment of secondary education is necessary to ensure a trainable and mobile labor force that will \nprovide the poor with access to greater earnings. The education strategy of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) in Sri Lanka falls within its overall strategies of poverty reduction, human development, and \neconomic growth with special efforts to ensure equality of opportunity across gender. ADB support for the \nsecondary education sector in Sri Lanka emphasizes access, quality, and capacity. The overall targets are \npoverty reduction, through an emphasis on pro-poor investments to strengthen public-private partnerships. \nIn this respect, ADB supports reform efforts to (i) improve access and education quality, particularly in rural \nand conflict-affected areas; and (ii) promote social cohesion by providing educational opportunities. The \nADB policy has six subsidiary priorities: (i) reach the poor, (ii) improve quality, (iii) increase efficiency, (iv) \nmobilize resources, (v) collaborate with beneficiaries, and (v) support innovation. \n \nIn Sri Lanka students from government schools (94% of the schools) receive free education. The country\u2019s \nadult literacy rate at 92%, is one of the highest in Asia. The country has about 10,000 government schools \nand 4,000,000 students. Females make up around 50% of the total student population. The positive \nimpacts of basic education on the poor are low fertility; low population growth; and low infant, child, and \nmaternal mortality. Although significant achievement has been accomplished in increasing the literacy \nrate, further development is needed particularly in science and technology in secondary education. Of 5\u2013\n14 year olds, 89.5% are in school; this drops to 54.5% for 15\u201319 year olds. Only 41% of students qualify \nfor higher studies (2001). Among those who sit the A-level examination, around 52% receive a pass but \nless than 3 % of this number enters university. Each year, 140,000 people enter the job market, however \n70% remained unemployed. The unemployed are between 14 and 25 years of age. Youth unemployment \nin youth has increased due to lack of competencies. This indicates that schools are not preparing its \nstudents for employment. The unemployment rate among those with A level (grades 12\u201313) and above is \n18%, as the conventional education system with its traditional courses does not meet the emerging needs \nof the labor market, especially in information technology, marketing, and English language skills.  \n \nThe biggest problem facing the secondary education system is the lack of universal access to effective \nsecondary education. In some respects, the disparities between some schools and others have been \nexacerbated by the developments made by Secondary Education Modernization Project  and General \nEducation Project 2 (World Bank financed). The computer learning centers (CLCs) and information \ntechnology (ITC) established by SEMP I and GEP 2 have left out secondary schools that have no \ncomputer learning center, and have received no benefits from outside. Lack of universal access to \nsecondary education effects many schools all over the country; however, 13 of the 24 administrative \ndistricts are severely disadvantaged. Some of the schools are in disadvantaged situation because they are \naffected by (i) 20-years of ethnic conflict; (ii) income level of the parents, (iii) ethnic division; (iii) shortage \nof teachers; (iv) rural urban disparity; and (v) regional disparity. Disparities among the schools can be \nfound in infrastructure, basic services, libraries, teaching and learning materials, level of teacher training, \nlack of qualified teachers in Mathematics, Science, ICT, level of school managerial autonomy, ability to \nraise funds for school development. The lack of access to science and technology results in children from \ndisadvantaged  districts  being  excluded  from  medicine,  engineering  technology  and  information \ntechnology, etc, which are the areas with the best employment and income prospects.  \n \nUnequal distribution of education facilities in the country especially in the conflict-affected areas (north \neast region) and inherent poverty of the large number of rural families are major concerns in resolving \ndisparities in education among the regions. The Project will focus on upgrading approximately 1100 \nsecondary schools (1AB and 1C schools, 10-13 grades) and provide system wide support to all secondary \nschools. The Project gives emphasis on minimizing the disparities among schools especially for the north \neast region and the plantation areas. ", "        Appendix 13   55\nProject budget will be allocated to bring the approximately 1,100 selected 1AB and 1C schools to an \nacceptable quality standard, so that the significant disparities among schools by region and rural and \nurban areas will be minimized. Stipends program for the  poor students should be selected from the \ndisadvantaged schools. Improvement in secondary school system would provide effective secondary \neducation opportunities for the students to learn science and technology. The Project will engage in policy \ndialogue with the Government to recruit science graduates as new teachers from the local areas. The \nimproved  quality  of  secondary  education  in  science  and  technology  subsequently  would  increase \nemployability of the students especially for the poor students. \n \n1\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention   \nADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction in Sri Lanka (2001) states that lack of access to high quality education has \nresulted in low human resource development among the poor. The household Survey of the Department of \nCensus and Statistics (2002), noted that 23.9% of households are poor, a decline from 26.7% in 1995/96. \nTwo types of poverty were analyzed in the 2002 household expenditure survey: relative and absolute \npoverty.  Approximately  25%  of  the  population  are  estimated  to  experience  absolute  poverty.  The \ngeographic distribution of incidence of rural poverty varies from one province to another. Comparatively, \nWestern Province happens to be most urbanized and developed, and the percentage of poor households \nvaries from 12.2% to 36.4%. Poverty is less rampant in urban areas. The number of poor households in \nurban areas is 7.9% and in the rural sector 26.4%. In Uva and North Central provinces the number of poor \nhouseholds increased from 1995/96 to 2002.The civil conflict in the north and east has adversely affected \nthe population in the areas, and poverty has increased significantly. Nearly 1.2 million people have been \ndisplaced by the ethnic conflict and one third of houses destroyed. The conflict has disrupted children\u2019s \neducation. Displacement, closure of schools, damage to school buildings, classrooms, libraries, water, \nsanitation facilities (15,000 class rooms in 500 schools), insecurity, and poverty have led to absenteeism, \nno enrollment, dropouts, and poor quality of education.  \n \nQuality of education is absent in most rural areas. Schools do not possess the basic requirements such \nas, water, sanitation facilities, classrooms, desks, chairs, blackboards, and teaching materials. Schools in \nremote and difficult areas suffer from shortage of teachers, while teachers are in excess in urban areas. \nNearly 27% teachers are untrained and this group generally constitutes the teachers in rural areas. The \nschools in small towns and rural areas are unable to provide education in science, technical subjects, and \nEnglish. The number of A-level students in science courses in the districts of Kiliinochchi, Mannar, Nuwara \nEliya, Polonnaruwa, and Trincomalee is very low. School buildings in these areas are in poor condition. \nThe poor condition of schools has implications for performance of students. The pass rates of rural \nschools are very low. In the District of Colombo more than 50% of students pass the O level, while in \nAnuradhapura, Hambantota, Matale, ,Monaragala, and Plonnaruwa, districts, less than 35% pass the O \nlevel. Of the total schools in urban areas, 24.9% are 1AB schools, while in the rural sector 1AB schools \naccount for only 4%. Almost 25% of 1AB schools are in Western Province. National 1AB schools, which \nare better equipped and managed by the Ministry of Education, are located in urban or semi-urban areas. \nAlthough education is free and uniforms are provided by the Government, poor parents are unable to meet \ntransport cost and cost of textbooks. Private tuition fees especially for science subjects are beyond the \nreach of poor parents. Poor students have limited access to science education, and this results in \nimbalance in the quality of education of the poor and the non-poor. \n \nThe schools in the semi-urban, rural, and conflict areas should receive priority in the resource allocation to \nimprove access to quality education under the Project. Providing basic facilities, additional classrooms, \nlibraries, science and educational equipment, to the disadvantaged school should be the major focus of \nthe Project. Recruitment of teachers for science and English for the north-east region and disadvantaged \ndistricts should be included in the policy dialogue of the Project. Given the poor condition of the schools in \nthe  conflicted  area,  the  Project  should  coordinate  with  North-East  Community  Restoration  and \nDevelopment Project, in north-east region to complement its school rehabilitation activities. The Project \nshould also coordinate with the Small-Scale Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Upgrading Project and other \naid-assisted projects to maximize the improvement of secondary schools in disadvantaged areas.  \n \nC.  Participation Process  \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nDuring the project preparatory technical assistance, limited stakeholders\u2019 consultation was done at the \nprovincial level. During the implementation of the Project, participatory needs assessment of the schools in \nconsultation with the provincial governments, school development societies and local communities should \nbe done to allocate appropriate resources to the disadvantaged schools . \n1  Following the Board Approval of the R-Paper, Review of ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy, staff instructions to \nreplace the PI/CPI classification with a new tracking system are under preparation in line with paragraph 83 of the \nR-Paper. ", " 56          Appendix 13 \n \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe  Project  would  help  the  school  development  societies  take  an  active  role  in  developing  and \nimplementing school development plans. The Government has introduced school management councils \n(SMC) on a pilot basis. In the future, SMC will replace the school development societies, and are expected \nto facilitate the participation of parents and the community in developing the school development plan.   \n \nD.            Gender Development \n Strategy to Maximize impacts on Women \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe state policies in Sri Lanka ensure gender equality and guarantee women\u2019s human and fundamental \nrights. The gender development index, which covers life expectancy, literacy, and education, shows that \nSri Lanka\u2019s achievement was 73%. However, the gender empowerment index that includes women\u2019s \nposition in decision-making was 27% in 2001. Women\u2019s labor force participation was 37%. The enrollment \nof girls in O and A levels is 52% and 57.5 % respectively, and is relatively high compared with boys. \nHowever, the majority of the girls are enrolled in arts (66%) and less in science and commerce. The \nnumber of girls admitted to universities is low as girls fail to obtain admission to different faculties. The \ngender gap is also evident from female enrollment figures in computer-related courses (2003). Poverty, \nlack of mobility, stereotyped selection of subjects; and lack of access to science and technology education \nhas deprived girls of the benefits of the secondary education system. District disparities in the availability \nof educational facilities such as qualified teachers in science and languages affect the children in remote \nareas more than those in the urban areas. Children from rural and remote areas are deprived of the \npossibility of higher attainment in language skills, and technical subjects compared with urban children. \nPoverty and parents\u2019 concern for their girls\u2019 security prevent girls from remote areas attending schools with \nscience courses (1AB schools) in the urban areas. The socialization process reinforces stereotyping of \ngirls\u2019 role and influences them to enroll subjects in arts. This limits women\u2019s options for better employment. \nFemale school dropouts tend to engage in low skilled jobs in the industrial zones, and or migrate to Middle \nEastern or Far Eastern countries as housemaids. The percent of female teachers is higher than male\u2014\n60.3% of all teachers. However, women hold only 31.8% of managerial positions. The Project will include \nthe following strategies to address gender issues: \n \n(i)  The selection of schools for improvement and upgrading into 1 AB schools or better quality 1 \nC schools will give priority to the schools from sem-iurban, rural areas, and conflict-affected \nareas. That will help increase  access  to  quality  secondary  education  of  girls  from  poor \nhouseholds. \n(ii)  The student\u2019s stipend program will include 50% girl students. \n(iii)  The selection of teachers for training will include 50% female teachers. \n(iv)  The improvement of basic facilities in schools will include building separate toilets for girls and \nfemale teachers. \n(v)  The managerial training program for existing principals will include 50% female principals, \nincluding female principals from the conflict-affected areas; The Project will increase the \nnumber of female teachers for managerial cadres from 31.8% to 40% by the end of the \nProject. \n(vi)  The teacher\u2019s training program on management and planning will include at least 50% female \nteachers. \n(vii)  The human development program for the provincial education office, zonal offices, training of \ntrainer program, and Ministry of Education will include at least 30% of female officials.  \n(viii)  The project management unit will include at least 40% of female staff. Female staff should be \nincluded in managerial positions in the unit; Female managers and experts should make up \n40% of the provincial project management units. The project management information system \nand  monitoring  system  will  include  a  gender  disaggregated  database  system  for  girl\u2019s \nenrollment in 1AB and 1C schools, training of teachers and principals, and stipend program, \nscholarship for teachers by rural, urban, region, and conflicted areas. \n(ix)  The Project will include a social development and gender specialist (domestic consultant) for 5 \nperson-months to develop a gender action plan with special focus on the conflict-affected \nareas. The project management office staff will have expertise in social development and \ngender. The domestic consultant will coordinate with the project management office and help \ndevelop a gender action plan. The gender action plan will be based on the targets noted \nearlier and will elaborate strategies, plan, monitoring indicators, and budget.  \n ", "        Appendix 13   57\nE.

The Project will directly benefit approximately 1,100 type 1AB and 1C schools \nand will provide system wide support to approximately 2,300 secondary schools.  \n \nB.  Background \n \n2.  The population of Sri Lanka in 2000 was estimated at 18.5 million. The Sinhala \npopulation constitutes 74%, Tamils 18%, and Muslims 7%. The Tamils constitute the \nlargest ethnic minority group in the country. Jaffna is the principal center of their religious \nand cultural life. Tamils have their own cultural identity. The Muslim population is mainly \nconcentrated in Eastern Province, where they are the largest ethnic group in the Ampara \ndistrict. Although Muslims use Tamil as their language and the medium of instruction in \neducation, their way of life is quite distinct from Tamils. \n \n3.  In 1956, Sinhala was designated as the official language. As a result the number \nof Tamils employed by the state, and admitted into higher education institutions became \nlimited. Since the 1970s, Tamil separatism and militancy has increased. The conflict \nbetween the militant groups and the Government continued for 20 years. The whole \ncountry has suffered from the ethnic conflict, especially the north-east where most of the \nfighting took place.  \n \n4.  Education in the north and east regions was severely affected by the conflict. \nNonenrollment of children for schooling, school dropouts, and absenteeism were the \nmajor repercussions on education. Around 25% of the schools were closed and 15,000 \nclassrooms were damaged. Approximately 50,000 children are out of school. After the \nceasefire, enrollment has increased due to returning internally displaced people. A \nsevere shortage of teachers (18%) occurred in the area. Further the widespread poverty \ncaused by loss of livelihood and property affected the education of children. The north \neast region has the lowest percentages of students in A-level science and mathematics, \nand the highest percentages of unqualified teachers. Girls are deprived from accessing \neducational facilities due to lack of security. In addition, traditional attitudes regarding \neducation of girls, often results in school dropout. Some communities in these areas are \nreluctant to send their girls to school.  \n    \nC.  Legal Framework \n \n5.  The constitutional provisions for ethnic minorities are found in articles dealing \nwith fundamental rights, proportional representation, language policy and devolution. \nThe 1978 Constitution, Article 18 declared Sinhala to be the official language of Sri \nLanka. The 13th Amendment to the Constitution declared Tamil language to be an official \nlanguage. English is declared to be the link language. The 16th Amendment passed in \n1988  declared  that  Sinhala  and  Tamil  to  be  the  languages  of  administration and \nlanguage of the courts throughout Sri Lanka. \n \n \n ", "               Appendix 14  59\n \n \n \nD.  Objective of the Ethnic Minority Development Framework \n \n6.  The ethnic minority development framework is to ensure that ethnic minorities in \nthe project area have equal access to project benefits. The framework will provide the \nprovincial education authorities and the ethnic minority communities with participation in \nplanning and implementation of the Project according to the needs of the secondary \nschool system in the province. \n \nE.  Proposed Strategies for Improvement of Education of Ethnic Minorities \n         \n7.  The following strategies will be included in the Project to improve the quality of \neducation for the ethnic minorities: \n \n(i)  The Project is expected to cover 195 (1 AB and 1C) schools in the north-\neast to improve educational opportunities for Muslim, Tamil, and Sinhala \nstudents. Once the need analysis is conducted, the first priority is to \npromote access by improving the condition of the disadvantaged schools, \nincluding schools in the conflict-affected areas in North East Province.  \n(ii)  Deployment  of  Tamil-speaking  information  and  communication \ntechnology technicians in the north-east and central provinces to provide \ntechnical assistance in computer learning. Of the total 100 fellowships for \nteachers, at least 25 will be for Tamil-speaking teachers. Female teachers \nwill be given preference in science and information technology training.  \n(iii)  Policy dialogue will be initiated under the Project to recruit Tamil-speaking \nteachers for mathematics, science, and English in areas where they are \nunderrepresented.  \n(iv)  For the stipend program, priority will be given to students from the north-\neast and central provinces (Muslim and Tamil); At least 50% of the total \nstipend in north-east region will be allocated for female students. \n(v)  Tamil-speaking  specialists  will  be  trained  as  zonal  training \nspecialists/facilitators. Training of cadres and zonal facilitators will focus \non promoting intercultural harmony and ethnic understanding in schools. \n(vi)  In-school training of teachers and principals will include methodology for \npromoting interethnic understanding in schools and society; Awareness \nraising on gender issues will be included in the training program for the \nzonal planning facilitators, principals, and teachers. \n(vii)  Schools will be encouraged to use Internet facilities for both subject \nlearning as well as communicating between Sinhala and Tamil schools.  \n(viii)  Support will be provided to National Institute of Education to develop a \ncivics  curriculum  to  promote  intercultural  understanding  and  harmony \namong students. \n(ix)  The use of three languages in computer learning will be encouraged by \nproviding subject-specific software in English, Sinhala, and Tamil. \n(x)  A trilingual provincial project manager will be recruited to manage the \nProject in north-east region and management staff in the Ministry of \nEducation to encourage interethnic understanding.  \n \n ", "60  Appendix 14 \n \n \n \nF.  Impact of the Project \n \n8.  The  upgrading  of  schools  and  the  school-based  capacity  development  of \nprincipals and teachers will improve the quality of education, especially in disadvantaged \nareas in the north-east and plantation areas.  \n \n9.  The stipend program will help poor students, especially girls, to gain access to \ninformation and communication technology resources and quality secondary education \nfacilities. Provision of science laboratories, activity rooms, libraries, furniture, and other \nequipment will increase school enrolment and minimize school dropouts. \n \n10.  The software package in English, Sinhala, and, Tamil, and training of zonal \nspecialists,  teachers,  and  principals  for  promoting  ethnic  harmony  will  improve \ninterethnic  understanding.  Use  of  Internet  facilities  and  communication  among  the \nstudents from the different ethnic groups and development of a civic curriculum will \npromote intercultural understanding and harmony among the students. \n  \n11.  With access to quality education and acquisition of new skills, graduates should \nbe able to enter the local and international job markets. The unemployment problem of \nthe youth in the area will also be minimized with the opening of job opportunities in the \nprivate sector. \n \nG.  Strategy for Education Management \n \n12.  The  initial  work  of  the  Project  at  the  school  level  will  start  with  the  needs \nassessment, with input from the school authority and the school development. The \nschool will receive training from zonal facilitators to prepare a school development plan. \nThe responsibility of implementing the plan is also vested with the school. In this way, \nschools will become more active in planning their own affairs. This process helps them \nto identify school problems, conduct needs assessments, and identify actions. The \nProject\u2019s  education  management  information  system  will  include  disaggregated \nmonitoring indicators by ethnic minorities and gender to ensure that boys and girls from \nall ethnic groups have equal access to the project resources and benefits.  \n \nH.  Budget and Finance \n \n13.  The  Project\u2019s  budget  will  allocate  adequate  resources  for  the  various \ncomponents and activities of the Project targeted in north-east region and plantation \nareas in the upcountry.  \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20041029103542+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20041001160134Z", "Title": "RRP 27 Sep-edit-clean Changed.doc", "Creator": "RRP 27 Sep-edit-clean Changed - Microsoft Word", "Author": "rsd", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 5.0 for Windows NT"}}
