(Following  the  Board \napproval  of  the  R-Paper,  Review  of  ADB's  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategy, staff instructions to replace the PI/CPI classification with \na  new  tracking  system  are  under  preparation  in  line  with \nparagraph 83 of the R-Paper).  \nSector: Education  \nSubsector: Senior secondary general education  \nThematic: Inclusive social development  \nSubtheme: Human development  \n \nCategory C The Project will involve minor repairs with no negative \nimplications on environment or involuntary resettlement.  \n \nThe Project will help  establish a secondary education system that \nis  equitable  and  responsive  to  labor  market  requirements.  It will \nincrease  equity  of  access  to  quality  secondary  education  by \nupgrading  approximately  1,100  target  schools  to  an  acceptable \nquality  standard.  It  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  to \nmodernize the secondary school curriculum and teaching-learning \nmethodologies  by  equipping  some  schools  with  science \nlaboratories, computer facilities, and multimedia units. Capacity of \nschool  personnel  to  manage  and  sustain  these  facilities  and \nimprove  teaching-learning  activities  will  be  developed  through \nteams  of  zonal  trainers/facilitators.  Schools  will  be  required  to \nsubmit  a  comprehensive  school  development  plan  (SDP)  before \nreceiving  any  support.  School-based  management  (SBM)  will  be \nenhanced \nthe  provision  of  small-scale  school \ndevelopment  grants.  Incentive  programs  to  attract  teachers  to \nwork  in  rural  areas  will  be  carried  out.  Special  attention  will  be \ngiven to support Tamil teachers. Stipends will be provided to poor \nstudents  qualified  to  study  A-level  science  or  commerce  in  a \nnearby  school.  The  capacity  of  provincial,  zonal,  and  divisional \ntraining  and \neducation  officials  will  be  developed \nconsulting services. The Project will support implementation of the \nGovernment\u2019s  policies  and  reforms \nin  education  such  as \ndecentralization  of  education  and  introduction  of  SBM,  and \nthe  national \nintegration  of  school-based  assessment \nexamination.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  social  equity  and \nbuilding  of  social  cohesion  by  minimizing  disparities  across \nregions and ethnic groups, and by promoting inclusive curriculum \ncontent and teaching methodologies.  \n\nthrough \n\nthrough \n\nin \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n \nObjectives \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nin \n\nis  18%; \n\n \nDespite positive achievements in basic education, low investment \nin  education  causes  disparities  in  the  quality  of  education  and \nresults  in  low  efficiency  of  secondary  education  and  above.  The \npass  rates  at  the  ordinary  level  (O  level)  and  advanced  level  (A \nlevel)  in  the  national  examinations  are  very  low.  Only  40%  of  O-\nlevel students qualify for A level. Regional disparities are evident. \nStudents in rural and disadvantaged areas have much lower pass \nrates  than  those  in  urban  areas.  Moreover,  schools  are  not \npreparing their students for employment. Grade 11 school leavers \ndo  not  have  sufficient  knowledge  or  vocational  skills  and  are  not \nequipped  to  seek  skilled  work  or  engage  in  self-employment. \nGrade  13  school  leavers  also  lack  employment-related skills and \nif unsuccessful in finding a place in the university system tend to \njoin the ranks of the unemployed. The unemployment rate among \nthose  with  A-level  qualifications  and  above \nthe \nconventional education system does not meet the demands of the \nlabor  market,  especially \ninformation  and  communication \ntechnology, science and technology, and English language skills. \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  improving  the  quality  and \nefficiency of secondary education and modernizing the system to \nmeet labor market requirements.  \n \nThe  broad  sector  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  help  establish  a \nis  equitable  and  more \nsecondary  education  system \nresponsive to labor market requirements. The specific objectives \nare  to  increase  equity  of  access  to  quality  secondary  education, \nand to improve efficiency of the secondary education system. The \nProject  will  upgrade  approximately  1,100  target  schools  not \nsupported  under  earlier  projects,  and  provide  system-wide \nsupport to all 2,300 (1AB and 1C ) secondary schools. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $47.0  million \nequivalent,  including  taxes,  duties,  interest  charge  on  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank \nloan,  and  physical  and  price \ncontingencies.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is  estimated  at  $14.6 \nmillion  (31.1%),  and  the  local  currency  cost  at  $32.4  million \nequivalent (68.9%) of the total cost \n \n \n\n(ADB) \n\nthat \n\nSource \n\nForeign \nExchange \n14.6  \n0  \n0  \n14.6  \n\nADB \nGovernment \nBeneficiaries  \n \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \n\nTotal \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n20.4  \n10.3  \n1.7  \n32.4  \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n35.0  \n10.3 \n1.7  \n47.0  \n\nPercent \n\n74.4              \n21.9      \n\n3.7              \n100  \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  $35.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  will \nbe  provided.

The loan \nwill finance 74.4% of the total project cost. ADB will fund 100% of \nthe  foreign  exchange  cost  (31.1%  of  the  estimated  total  project \ncost),  and  $20.4  million  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost  or \nabout 62.8% of the total local currency cost. The remaining $12.0 \nmillion  equivalent  as  counterpart  financing  (25.6%  of  the  total \nproject  cost)  will  be  provided  by  the  Government  ($10.3  million) \nand  beneficiaries  ($1.7  million).

A  central  project  management \noffice (PMO) will oversee day-to-day project implementation. Each \nprovince will have a provincial PMO to coordinate and account for \nall  project  activities  occurring  in  that  province.  The  SDPs  will  be \nsubmitted  to  the  central  PMO  through  the  zonal  education  office \nand  the  provincial  PMO.  The  provincial  MOE  and/or  MOE  must \nformally  approve  the  SDPs  before  any  facilities  are  provided  to \nthe schools. \n \nAll  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement. The central \nPMO will be responsible for all procurement. Supply contracts for \ngoods estimated at $500,000 equivalent or more will be awarded \non the basis of international competitive bidding. Supply contracts \nfor goods less than $500,000, but more than $100,000, will follow \ninternational  shopping  procedures.  Supply  contracts  of \ninstructional  materials \nthan \n$100,000,  will  follow  local  competitive  bidding  procedures.

The  Government  will  select  and \nengage all ADB-financed consultants through a firm using quality \nand  cost-based  selection  and \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants.  \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  approximately  1,100  of  type  1AB \nand 1C schools that have not benefited from external assistance \nin the past. The Project will yield particular benefits for schools in \ndisadvantaged  areas  and  conflict-affected  areas,  by  developing \ninfrastructure,  facilities,  resources,  management,  teachers,  and \nteaching  and  learning  resources  of  the  target  schools  up  to  an \nacceptable baseline level. The Project will benefit around 200,000 \ngrade  10\u201313  secondary  school  students  each  year.  In  addition, \nother students in these schools will benefit from improved school \nfacilities,  enhanced  school  managerial  capacity,  and  more \nmotivated  teachers.  Approximately  825,000  students  per  year \nfrom  2005\u20132009 will benefit from the Project.  Students in 2,300 \nsecondary  schools  will  benefit  from  system-wide  support  to \ndevolve  education  management;  reform  to  provide  a  more \nefficient  assessment  system;  modernized  curriculum;  and \nenhanced  capacity  of  provincial  and  zonal  offices  in  education \nplanning,  management,  and  monitoring.  Furthermore,  the  800 \nschools  supported  under  the  ongoing  Secondary  Education \nModernization  Project  (SEMP)  will  continue  to  benefit  from  the \nProject through training, monitoring and technical assistance.  \n\nKey lessons from the SEMP and the  World Bank-funded Second \nGeneral Education Project  are that facilities such as computers, \nmultimedia units, or modern science laboratories will not be used \nand  sustained  if  the  Project  fails  to  ensure (i) adequate teaching \nstaff;  (ii)  up-front  capacity  development  of  end-users  and \nbeneficiaries;  and  (iii)  commitment  and  ownership  of  provincial, \nzonal,  and  divisional  school  stakeholders.  Moreover,  the  schools \nare  expected  to  build  a  cost-recovery  system  for  the  computer \nlearning centers. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nvii \n\nis  committed \n\nis  crucial \nto \n\nHowever,  schools  in  poor  communities,  and  those  with  less \ncapacity  in  management  may  not  be  able  to  self-sustain. \nFurthermore,  innovations  such  as  school-based  assessment and \nSBM  need  a  continuing  process  of  capacity  development, \nawareness  raising,  and  monitoring  before  integration  into  the \nsystem.  \n \nThe  Government \nto  decentralizing  education. \nHowever, accelerated decentralization could bring resistance and \nmisunderstandings about the concept of decentralization or SBM, \nand fail to secure stakeholder commitment.

Selective  inputs  of  modern  education  facilities \nmay  cause  disparities  among  schools  with  different  levels  of \nabsorptive  capacity.  Along  with  project \nimplementation, \ncontinuous policy dialogue with the Government will be sought to \nfind  measures  for  a  more  equitable  training,  recruitment,  and \ndeployment  system  for  teachers,  as  a  key  factor  for  increasing \nequity  of  access  to  quality  secondary  education  across  regions \nand ethnic groups.  \n\nto  support \nnew \nrequire  a  strong \n\nassume \n\n\fix\n\n04'2270  HR\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Secondary  Education  Modernization \nProject II. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORT UNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nSri Lanka has achieved a human development index of 0.73, the highest in South Asia. \nHowever,  despite  gross  domestic  product  growth  of  around  5%  in  the  1990s,  economic \ndevelopment  has  mainly  benefited  the  urban  areas  in  Western,  Central,  and  Southern \nprovinces, and has not reached the rural areas in Uva and North Western provinces, where a \nhigh  concentration  of  the  poor  live.  Around  40%  of  the  population  is  considered  poor  or \nvulnerable to poverty. Twenty years of civil conflict is the main source of poverty\u2014a result of the \ndestruction of homes and facilities, displacement of people, and diversion of public expenditure \nfrom  economic  and  social  development.  The  cease-fire  agreement  in  2002  changed  the \nGovernment\u2019s  development  strategy  to  a  positive  economic  reform  agenda,  but  at  the  same \ntime,  has  brought  immense  challenges  to  restore  infrastructure  and  services  and  eradicate \npoverty  in  the  conflict-affected  areas  in  the  north-east  region.  On  2  April  2004,  the  country \nexperienced  its  third  parliamentary  election  in  4  years.  The  new  Government,  which  assumed \nduties on 22 April 2004, has yet to firm its strategy for economic growth, poverty reduction, and \nlong-term peace building in the country.  \n \n3. \nEducation  in  Sri  Lanka  is  free  in  government  schools,  which  comprise  94%  of  the \nschools,  and  in  state-run  tertiary  educational  institutions.  About  10,000  government  schools \neducate  around  4,000,000  students.  Some  achievements  of  the  Sri  Lankan  education  system \nare remarkable. The literacy rate of 92% is one of the highest in Asia, and enrollment in primary \nschooling  is  95%,  in  lower  secondary  85%.  Females  make  up  about  50%  of  the  total  student \npopulation. Virtually, all children attend school up to grade 11.  \n \nDespite  positive  achievements  in  basic  education,  the  low  investment  in  education \n4. \nresults  in  disparities  in  the  educational  quality,  and  a  low  efficiency  and  capacity  of  the \nsecondary  system  and  above.  Sri  Lanka  spends  only  2.8  %  of  the  gross  domestic  product  on \neducation compared with 3.5% on average in Asia. As a result, the pass rates at ordinary level \n(O level) and advanced level (A level) in the national examinations are very low. Only 40% of O-\nlevel  students  qualify  for  A  level.  More  than  50%  of  the  candidates  in  O-level examinations in \nmathematics fail each year, while the failure rate for English is nearly 70%. Regional disparities \nin the pass rates are evident. While over 50% of students in Colombo qualify for A level, in the \npoorer districts such as Kilinochi and Nuwara Eliya, less than 30% qualify. Forty percent of A-\nlevel candidates qualify for university, but only about 10% of those gain a place. The capacity of \nthe state-run university system is so small that only 2% of the 20\u201325 age group is enrolled. \n \nWith  140,000  people  entering  the  job  market  each  year,  and  70%  of  the  unemployed \n5. \nbetween  14  and  25  years,  the  schools  are  obviously  not  preparing  students  for  employment. \nGrade 11 school leavers do not have vocational skills and are not equipped to seek skilled work \nor engage in self-employment. Grade 13 school leavers also lack employment-related skills and, \nif  unsuccessful  in  finding  a  place  in  the  university  system,  tend  to  join  the  ranks  of  the \nunemployed.  Labor  market  demand  is  largely  in  the  area  of  information  and  communication \nlanguage  skills.  The \ntechnology  (ICT),  science,  engineering,  marketing,  and  English \n\n\f2 \n\nunemployment  rate  among  those  with  A-level  qualifications  and  above  is  18%  because  the \nconventional  education  system  does  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the  labor  market.  The \nGovernment  is  committed  to  improving  the  quality  of  secondary  education  and  to  modernizing \nthe system to meet labor market requirements.1 The project framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n6. \nA major effort is required to support the Government\u2019s effort to reconstruct the education \nsystem  in  the  conflict-affected  areas  in  the  north-east  region.  Approximately  25%  of  schools \nwere  closed,  and  15,000  classrooms  in  500  schools  were  damaged,  as  were  libraries, \nlaboratories,  water,  and  sanitation  facilities.  Displacement  insecurity  and  poverty  prevented \nchildren  from  going  to  school.  About  50,000  school-age  children  are  estimated  to  be  out  of \nschool. The Project will pay special attention to reconstructing these areas in coordination with \nthe  North-East  Community  Restoration  and  Development  Project  (NECORD),2  which  has  a \ncomponent for school rehabilitation in the conflict-affected areas.  \n  \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nThe fundamental problem affecting secondary education is the lack of universal access \n7. \nto  quality  education.  This,  in  turn,  results  in  low  efficiency  of  the  system,  as  apparent  in \nstudents\u2019 poor performance in national examinations and employment perspectives. The sector \nand subsector analysis, including a problem tree, is in Appendix 2.  \n\n     \n8. \nInequity  of  Access  to  Quality  Secondary  Education.  School  disparities  include \ninfrastructure;  libraries;  laboratories;  teaching  and  learning  materials;  teacher  availability  and \ncapacity;  school  managerial  capacity;  and  access  to  scientific  and  technical  subjects,  ICT, \nEnglish  language,  and  practical  skills  development.  Type  1AB  schools,  which  offer  a  full \ncurriculum  (science,  arts,  commerce)  are  usually  well-equipped  in  terms of facilities and staff, \nand  are  located  in  urban  areas.  They  constitute  only  25%  of  the  secondary  schools,  whereas \ntype 1C schools, which offer limited curriculum (arts or commerce, or both) are smaller schools \nlocated  in  rural  areas,  and  often  lack  basic  facilities  and  capable  teachers.  Access  to  quality \neducation is also affected by household income. Poor parents are unable to send their children \nto  a  better  school  in  urban  areas,  and  to  pay  private  tuition  to  prepare  for  the  national \nexamination.  Though  the  gender  balance  in  participation  in  secondary  education  is  good,  the \nunder-representation of girls in science streams remains as an issue. \n\n                 \n9. \nThe shortage and inequitable distribution of teachers across the country creates a major \nbottleneck  for  increasing  equity  of  access  to  key  subjects.  The  shortage  of  Tamil-speaking \nteachers in science, mathematics, and English limits schools in Tamil societies to introduce and \nstrengthen  teaching  in  key  subjects  such  as  A-level  science,  English, and practical subjects. \nThe  national  teacher  transfer  policy,  which  allocates  teachers  equitably  according  to  local \nneeds, must be reviewed. Until now, this policy has not been followed effectively, and because \nof resistance from teachers to work in remote areas, a teacher surplus exists for large schools in \nurban areas, whereas schools in disadvantaged areas lack teachers.  \n\n                                                 \n1   Technical  assistance  was  provided  to  prepare  a  project  proposal.

In 1987, the Government \n10. \ndevolved education management to the provincial education authorities. However, the system is \ncomplex hierarchical and duplicates functions at different levels. The low capacity at the zonal \nand divisional offices hinders effective monitoring of education activities. The Government has \nattempted  to  devolve  education  management  to  the  schools  by  introducing  school-based \nmanagement  (SBM),  where  schools  exercise  managerial  control  of  their  activities  through  a \nschool  management  council  (SMC).  The  School  Development  Board  Act  was  introduced  in \n1993,  but  was  abolished  in  1995  as  it  faced  resistance  from  certain  stakeholders  who  feared \nthat  it  might  lead  to  the  privatization  of  public  schools.  Progress  in  introducing  SBM  has  been \nslow since then, and a national concept of SBM has yet to be formulated.  \n\n \n11. \nThe  Assessment System.  The  education  system  is  examination  oriented,  but  every \nyear  fails  to  produce  an  acceptable  pass  rate  among  students.  The  examination  oriented \nsystem and lack of practical orientation in teaching and learning have led to the realization that \nmore  continuous  assessment  including  practical  work,  projects,  and  assignments  is  needed. \nSchool-based assessment (SBA) has been introduced to the O-level curriculum. SBA marks are \ndisplayed  on  the  O-level  certificate,  though  they  are  not  yet  integrated  into  the  O-level grade. \nSBA is currently being brought into the A-level syllabus. However, progress in establishing SBA \nis impeded by lack of monitoring and evaluation at zonal and divisional levels, and lack of belief \namong the public and teachers on the effectiveness of SBA.  \n\n \n12. \n Education  for  Postconflict  Reconstruction.  An  important  role  for  education  in \npostconflict  reconstruction  is  reconciliation  and  the  rebuilding  of  social  cohesion.  In  Sri  Lanka, \nboth the Sinhalese majority and the Tamil minority have expressed grievances based on relative \ndeprivation  of  educational  provision  and  opportunity.  These  perceptions  of  inequality  and \nexclusion  have  been  catalysts  of  conflict.  Education  reform  should  avoid  reconstructing  the \nsystem  of  exclusion  that  preceded  the  conflict.  Therefore  the  following  steps  are  crucial: \nincrease  equity  of  access  to  quality  secondary  education  in  the  deprived  areas;  ensure  that \nthese  areas  are  not  excluded  from  the  benefit  of  a  modernized  curriculum;  and  address  the \nvalue-forming  functions  of  schooling  by  developing  curriculum  content  and  teaching  methods \ncommensurate with the goal of shared values, social cohesion, and inclusive institutions. \n\n \n13. \nThe  Government\u2019s  strategy  is  to  modernize  secondary  education  to  enrich  the  labor \nmarket,  giving  particular  emphasis  to  minimizing  regional  disparities  and  alleviating  the \ndisadvantages  experienced  in  poor  rural  and  conflict-affected  areas.  The  Government  is \ncommitted to recruiting more graduates from the rural areas as teachers, and  is giving special \nattention  to  recruiting  Tamil-speaking  teachers  in  the  north-east  region.  The  Government  has \nalso introduced an incentive program for teachers working in very difficult rural areas. In 2001, a \npilot project on SBM was introduced but was suspended after a change of government. In June \n2004, a new committee was established within the Ministry of Education (MOE) to continue the \nwork initiated in 2001 to develop a national consensus on SBM and to phase its introduction into \nthe  system.  More  emphasis  is  being  given  to  developing  the  capacity  of  zonal  offices.  The \nGovernment  is  also  committed  to  introducing  continuous  assessment  and  bringing  a  more \npractical orientation to teaching by making SBA an integral part of the overall assessment of O \nand  A  levels.  The  National  ICT  Policy  in  Education  (2001)  lays  the  foundation  for  human \nresource development to meet the global challenges in ICT, and creates conditions for effective \nuse  of  ICT  as  a  learning  and  teaching  tool  in  school  education.  Information  technology  is \ncompulsory at the O-level, and will be introduced at the A-level in January 2005. In July 2004, \nMOE  signed  a  circular  allowing  schools  to  generate  income  by  providing  computer-learning \nservices to the community after school hours.  \n\n\f4 \n\n \n14. \nThe  Asian Development Bank (ADB) education strategy in Sri Lanka is consistent with \nthe  Government\u2019s  overall  strategies  for  poverty  reduction  and  economic  growth.  It  supports \ntargeted interventions to raise educational attainment of low-income groups and helps influence \nthe advancement of curricula design to reflect the needs of a modern labor market.  It promotes \ndecentralization  of  education  and  institutional  development  at  all  levels  to  improve  planning, \nmonitoring, and service delivery of education. It builds upon progress and achievements of the \nongoing  Secondary  Education  Modernization  Project3  (SEMP),  with  a  goal  of  maintaining  the \nmomentum of innovation and modernization occurring in the secondary school system.  \n\n   \n15.  \nThe  biggest  achievements  of  the  SEMP  to  date  are  the  establishment  of  computer \nlearning  centers  (CLCs)  in  474  schools,  the  strengthening  of  multimedia  learning,  and \nestablishment of SBA at the O level. The SEMP targets a total of 800 schools or more for quality \nimprovement.  The  World  Bank-funded  Teacher  Education  and  Teacher  Deployment  Project \nsupported  the  national  colleges  of  education.  The  other  World  Bank-funded  Second  General \nEducation  Project  (GEP  2)  has  supplied  libraries,  textbooks,  and  books,  and  trained  teachers \nand  principals.  It  also  provided  400  schools  with  information  technology  centers.  The  Small-\nScale Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Upgrading Project (SIRUP) II funded by the Japan Bank \nfor International Cooperation upgrades and rehabilitates schools nationwide. The World Bank is \npreparing an education sector review, the results of which will lead to the next lending program \nfor general education. External assistance to the education sector is in Appendix 3.  \n\n \n16. \nLessons  Learned.  The  SEMP  and  GEP  2  have  demonstrated  that  the  introduction of \nmodern  subjects  and  teaching,  such  as  ICT,  A-level  science,  and  multimedia  learning,  will \nsimply  not  happen  if  schools  are  not  ready  to  exploit  and  sustain  the  facilities  for  modern \nteaching. Essential conditions to ensure schools\u2019 readiness are (i) availability of skilled teachers; \n(ii)  ownership,  capacity,  and  initiative  of  the  school  to  maintain  the  facilities  and  fully  integrate \nmodern  subjects  and  teaching  methods;  (iii)  availability  of  basic  school  facilities;  (iv) \nauthorization for the  schools  to  generate  income  from  the  CLCs  after  schools  hours;  and  (iv) \nclose monitoring from zone and divisional offices. Lessons learned show that some schools in \nthe disadvantaged areas are more in need of basic facilities and skilled teachers than access to \nmodern curriculum. Therefore, project investment should be carefully planned based on school-\nspecific  development  needs.  Furthermore,  the  SEMP  has  initiated  SBA  and  introduced  SBM, \nbut  further  awareness  raising  and  capacity  building  at  all  levels  is  needed  before  these \ninnovations  can  be  integrated  into  the  system.  Lessons  learned  from  the  SEMP,  GEP  2  and \nTeacher  Education  and  Teacher  Deployment  Project  are  summarized  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n\n \n17. \nIncreasing Equity of Access to Quality Secondary Education. The priority will be to \nminimize  disparities  across  regions,  gender,  and  ethnic  groups  by  upgrading  all  schools  to  an \nacceptable  baseline  standard,  and  equipping  them  with  modern  facilities  where  feasible.  The \nstrategy  will  be  to  build  upon  the  progress  of  SEMP;  build  capacity  of  school  stakeholders  to \nsustain  and  maximize  benefit  of  the  facilities;  provide  closer  monitoring  and  guidance  by \nimproving  the  capacity  of  zonal  and  divisional  offices;  and  support  implementation  of  key \nGovernment policies, such as the decentralization of education and SBM, assessment reform, \ncurriculum  modernization,  and  teacher  training,  recruitment,  and  transfer.  The  Project  will \ncoordinate  with  the  NECORD  and  SIRUP  II  for  school  rehabilitation  needs  in  the  conflict-\n\n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2000.

Special attention will be given to developing educational content that promotes \ninterethnic understanding and social cohesion.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\n18. \nThe broad sector goal of the Project is to help establish a secondary education system \nthat  is  equitable  and  responsive  to  labor  market  requirements.  The  specific  objectives  are  to \nincrease  equity  of  access  to  quality  secondary  education,  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  the \nsecondary  education  system.  The  Project  will  specifically  target  the  remaining  approximately \n1,100  1AB  and  1C  schools  that  were  not  served  by  either  the  SEMP  or  GEP  2,  and  provide \nsystem -wide support to all 2,300 (type 1AB and type1C) secondary schools. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe  Project  has  three  components:  (i)  improving  quality  of,  and  equity  of  access  to, \n19. \nsecondary  education,  (ii)  strengthening  the  capacity  of  provincial  and  zonal  offices,  and  (iii) \nsupporting implementation of government policies and reforms in education. \n\n1. \n\nComponent  1:  Improving  Quality  of,  and  Equity  of  Access  to,  Secondary \nEducation \n\n \nThis component will ensure that all target schools that do not meet an accepted quality \n20. \nstandard, defined by the Project as a baseline, will be supported by upgrading physical facilities, \nproviding teaching-learning resources, strengthening teachers\u2019 skills and principals\u2019 managerial \ncapacities, and small-scale school development grants (SDGs). This upgrading effort will ensure \nthat  every  secondary  school  is  capable  of  teaching  the  eight  required  O-level  subjects in the \ncurriculum.  A  needs  analysis  will  be  conducted  to  categorize  each  target  school  based  on  its \nunique  priority  development  needs.  Baseline  conditions  for  secondary  schools  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. In addition, at least one school per division (or two schools where \nthe  population  is  a  mix  of  Sinhala  and  Tamil)  will  be  upgraded  to  1AB  status,  or  improved  to \noperational  1AB  status.  In  areas  where  this  is  not  possible  because  of  lack  of  demand  for  A-\nlevel  science  stream  and  science  teachers,  the  school  will  be  provided  with  modern  teaching \nfacilities . These upgraded or improved schools will provide opportunities to students from other \nschools in the area that lack teaching facilities for science, commerce, and ICT. Highest priority \nfor upgrading schools to 1AB status will be given to the 61 divisions that have no 1AB schools. \nBefore receiving any support, all target schools will be required to submit a school development \nplan  (SDP)  that  includes  a  teaching  plan  and  facility  management  plan.  The school resource \nallocation  procedure  and  funding  formula  is  in  Appendix  4.  The  criteria  for  SDPs  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n\na. \n\nUpgrading Facilities and Providing Equipment \n\n \n21. \n According to their needs, schools below the baseline conditions will be provided with (i) \nrehabilitation/renovation of classrooms and science laboratories, walls, roof, and partition walls \nor  movable  screens;  (ii)  a  multipurpose  activity  room;  (iii)  classroom  furniture,  blackboard, \ndisplay  board,  teaching  aids,  and  a  cupboard  in  each  classroom;  (iv)  a  library  with  adequate \nbooks,  shelves,  and  other  resources;  (vi)  electricity  supply  and  telephone  facilities;  (vii)  safe \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\ndrinking  water;  (vii)  sanitary  facilities;  and  (viii)  science  equipment.  New  construction  will  be \ncarried out in limited cases. The Project will coordinate with the NECORD and SIRUP, so that \nthe Project will provide inputs other than physical upgrades for the schools supported by the two \nprojects.  \n \n\n22. \nSchools with more than 100 secondary (grade 10\u201313) students and that have access to \nelectricity will be eligible to receive computer facilities, accessories, software, and ICT training, \nprovided  that  the  SDPs  submitted  by  the  schools  demonstrate  a  capacity  to  manage  the \nfacilities.  Computers  and  multimedia  equipment  will  also  be  provided  for  the  multimedia  room \nassociated with the library. Training for maintenance of the computer facilities will be provided \nboth  from  the  suppliers  and  the  zonal  facilitators.  Subsidies  will  be  provided  for  computer \noperating expenses for 2 years.  \n\nProducing Teaching-Learning Resources, and Introducing Teaching \nMethods \n\n23. \nZonal  trainers/facilitators  will  provide  school-based  training  in  innovative  teaching \nmethods,  teaching-learning  resource  (TLR)  production  and  use,  and  SBA  techniques  to \nteachers in 1,100 target schools. Teachers will also receive training on teaching methodologies \nthat foster interethnic understanding. Training guides and manuals will be provided to teachers \non  SBA,  innovative  teaching  methods,  and  TLR  development.  For  schools  receiving  ICT \nfacilities,  training  on  computer-assisted  learning  (CAL)  and  special  ICT  learning  guides  with \nrelevant exercises will be provided to both teachers and students. The zonal facilitators will be \ntrained to monitor the development and use of CAL, innovative teaching methods, TLRs and the \napplication  of  SBA  practices  by  the  teachers  on  a  regular  basis.  Two  hundred  international \nfellowships  will  be  provided  to  teachers  and  zonal  facilitators  to  learn  modern  teaching \napproaches.  Furthermore,  educational software will be procured from international sources for \ncore  subjects  in  grades  10\u201313  and  made  available  in  three  languages  (English,  Sinhala,  and \nTamil).  By  translating  and  contextualizing  relevant  software  packages  into  Sinhala  and Tamil, \nstudents  will  be  able  to  learn  subject  content  in  three  languages.  Schools  supported  under \nSEMP schools will also benefit from training and monitoring from the zonal facilitators.    \n\nBuilding  Capacity  and  Providing  Special  Support  Programs  for \nSchools and Students \n\nb. \n\n \n\nc. \n\n \n\n24. \nCapacity of the schools to prioritize, plan, and manage resources and learning activities \nwill be developed through training on SBM and leadership for principals, teachers, and school \ndevelopment societies (SDSs)4, or SMCs as appropriate. The zonal facilitators will provide the \ntraining, including methodologies for preparing and implementing a comprehensive SDP. \n\n      \n25. \nPoor students in disadvantaged and conflict-affected areas, who are qualified to attend \nA-level  science  or  commerce  classes  will  be  provided  with  stipends  to  attend  a  nearby  1AB \nschool. The stipend program will help students pay for additional travel costs and school-related \nexpenses such as fees, books, and lodging. Stipends will be provided to approximately 12,000 \nstudents  per  year  over  a  4-year  period.  Qualified  students  from  type  2  schools  (which  cover \n\n                                                 \n4   SDSs will be gradually replaced by SMCs.  \n\n\f7 \n\ngrades  1\u201311)  will  be  also  eligible  to  attend  a  1AB  school  or  1C  school  (for  commerce).  The \ncriteria for the school stipend program are described in Supplementary Appendix D. \n\n \n26. \nA pilot project will be conducted to hire 100 graduates with national diplomas in ICT or \nequivalent to provide technical assistance to about 500 schools on a cluster basis, particularly in \nrural areas. The pilot project will be implemented in the first 3 years of the Project to ensure that \ncomputer resources are fully utilized by the schools with minimum interruptions during the start-\nup  period.  In  addition,  to  help  students  learn  information  technology,  at  least  25  ICT  learning \nguides containing relevant exercises and assignments will be provided to each school (available \nin three languages, depending on each school's requirements). The Project will also support the \ntraining  of  at  least  1,000  teacher-librarians  in  ICT  usage,  web-based  learning,  computer-\nassisted learning, and library management including computerization of library resources. This \nsubcomponent  will  support  the  training  of  principals  and  teachers  at  each  school  in  career \nguidance, counseling techniques, and career center operations as a follow-up to activities under \nthe  SEMP.  This  will  include  awareness-raising  on  gender-based  constraints  in  education  and \ntraining school stakeholders to encourage greater participation of girls in science streams.  \n\n \n27. \nA  teaching  incentive  program  to  attract  teachers  to  serve  4  years  in  rural  and \nunderprivileged areas will be implemented. Allowance will be offered to 200 teachers in English, \nmathematics,  science,  technical  subjects,  and  ICT.  The  pilot  program  will  be  implemented  in \nUva Province, which has a large geographic disparity of teachers, with teachers concentrated in \nurban areas. Selected teachers should have at least 5 years teaching experience.  \n\n \n2. \n\nComponent 2: Strengthening the Capacity of Provincial and Zonal Offices \n\n \n28. \nActivities  are  directed  at  strengthening  the  skills  and  competencies  of  provincial  and \nzonal  offices  so  that  their  staff  can  exercise  greater  supervision  and  monitoring  of  school \nactivities. Principals, teachers, and SDSs will be trained in key areas such as SBA, SBM, TLR \nproduction,  student  counseling,  and  innovative  teaching  methodologies.  The  management \ncapacity  of  provincial  departments  of  education  will  be  strengthened  by  providing  international \nand domestic education system management consultants to work with the individual provincial \ntraining development units (PTDUs) for fixed periods. \n\n \n\na. \n\nStrengthening Zonal Offices \n\n \n29. \nA  cadre  of  3\u20135  trainers/facilitators  will  be  developed  in  each  zone  to  specialize  in \ninnovative  teaching  methodologies,  SBM  and  educational  leadership,  ICT-based  pedagogy, \nTLR production, and SBA. Special attention will be given to teaching methodologies that foster \nintercultural  and  interethnic  understanding.  These  facilitators  will  be  responsible  for  about  10 \nproject schools in a given zone, and will conduct school-based training for principals, teachers, \nSDSs,  (or  SMCs)  in  their  specialized  areas  on  a  year-round  basis.  A  train-the-trainer program \nwill  be  implemented  by  initially  training  a  core  of  master  trainers  who  in  turn  will  train  zonal \nofficers, In-Service Advisers (ISA)s, and divisional directors to become facilitators capable of (i) \nhelping  schools  prepare  SDPs;  and  (ii)  training  principals,  teachers,  SDSs,  and  SMCs  in \nidentified  key  areas.  Indicative  criteria  for  selecting  zonal  facilitators  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix E. \n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n  \n\nb. \n\nStrengthening Provincial Offices \n\n \n30. \nThe  role  of  provincial  departments  is  to  provide  strategic  guidance  to  zonal  education \noffices  and  monitor  overall  system  performance.  To  support  the  development  of  provincial \noffices, this subcomponent will implement a train-the-trainer program to train senior and middle \nmanagement  of  provincial  ministries  of  education  in  SBM  and  educational  leadership.  To \nfacilitate the training, the Project will provide one domestic education management consultant to \neach  province  for  1  year  to  provide  advice  and  oversee  training  of  provincial,  zonal,  and \ndivisional  offices.  The  consultant  will  work  within  the  PTDU  and  provide  training  to  provincial \nand  zonal  personnel  on  SBM,  human  resource  management,  and  education  system \nmanagement.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  provide  one  international  education  management \nspecialist to each PTDU for a limited period.  \n\n3. \n \n\nComponent 3: Supporting Implementation of Government Policies and  \n \n\n  Reforms \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n31. \nThis component will support Government policies to make the education system more \nefficient and effective. Activities include improving the operations of national institutions such as \nthe National Evaluation Testing Services (NETS), strengthening coordination between MOE and \nthe provincial authorities, mainstreaming SBM in the system, and developing schools\u2019 capacities \nto  become  more  self-reliant.  Research;  pilot  studies;  and  public  awareness  programs  in  key \nreform  areas  such  as  decentralization  of  education,  SBM,  SBA,  public-private  partnership  in \neducation, and curriculum development will be part of the component. \n\nSupporting Decentralized Education Management \n\na. \n\n \n\nTo  support  the  implementation  of  SBM  in  the  education  system,  this  component  will \n32. \nimplement a pilot initiative to establish and run 100 SMCs with provision of small start-up grants. \nThe grant will help a given SMC to get started and perform its functions and duties over 3 years. \nZonal facilitators will be employed to monitor program implementation and facilitate the start-up \nand  operation  of  each  SMC  over  the  trial  period.  The  results  of  this  pilot  initiative  will  provide \ninformation  to  the  Government  on  how  SMCs  can  be  effective  administrative  bodies  in  the \nsystem.  This  subcomponent  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  to  strengthen  school \nmanagement  and  leadership  in  the  school  system.  Zonal  facilitators  will  be  employed  to  train \nschool  principals,  teachers,  SDS  representatives,  and  SMC  members  in  SBM  and  education \nleadership  techniques.  In  addition,  the  trainers  will  implement  an  effective  public  awareness \nprogram on SBM. The Project will also provide school-based training for principals on using ICT \nfor  managing  the  school  and  implementing  SBM.  Zonal  trainers  will  monitor  and  evaluate  the \nimplementation of SBM in the schools over 4 years, and advise the principals, SDSs, and SMCs \non a consistent basis. The principals are expected, in time, to gain more confidence and skill in \nusing the computer as a tool for managing and administering the school more effectively. This \nsubcomponent will provide school-based training for approximately 1,000 school principals and \nmembers  of  SDSs  and  SMCs.  Indicative  plans  for  piloting  the  SMC  start-up  program  and \nmainstreaming SBM are in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n\nb. \n\nDeveloping School Partnerships and Sustainability \n\n \n33. \nThis  subcomponent  will  support  Government  policies  on  promoting  efficient  generation \nand utilization of funds in the schools by implementing a train-the-trainer program to develop a \n\n\f9 \n\nc. \n\n \n\nd. \n\n \n\ne. \n \n\nteam of local experts that can advise SMCs on procedures and mechanisms for financing and \nsustaining school operations, including ways of developing partnerships with the private sector, \ncommunity groups, and other schools. The local experts will work directly with schools and help \nthem  prepare  sustainability  measures  as  part  of  the  SDP.  Funds  could  be  generated  by \noperating the CLCs after hours and offering ICT training courses to the community. By year 4, \nthe  Government  will  evaluate  the  partnership  program,  incorporating lessons learned from the \nSEMP, and develop an action plan for public-private partnerships in education.  \n\nStreamlining the National Examination System \n\n34. \nThis  subcomponent  will  build  on  the  progress  of  the  SEMP  and  provide  consulting \nservices  to  NETS  on  ways  to  improve  and  streamline  the  national  testing  and  evaluation \nprocess,  including  computerization  of  operations  and  evaluation  results.  It  will  strengthen  the \ncapacity of NETS to integrate SBA results into the national examination system. SBA marks will \nbe integrated into the student\u2019s final grades for both the O and A-level certificates after year 3 of \nthe Project. This will be achieved as SBA takes root in the system and the reliability of SBA is \naccepted by the public. The Project will implement awareness programs for principals, parents, \nand zonal monitoring panel members to orient them to the objectives, modalities, and expected \noutcomes of SBA. Also, curriculum specialists from the National Institute of Education (NIE) and \ntest development specialists from NETS will work together and develop a comprehensive SBA \nsystem covering grades 6\u201313. \n\nModernizing the Curriculum \n\n35. \nThe  Project  will  support  NIE  to  develop  eight  options  within  the  technical  studies \nsubjects in the core curriculum of O-level options to provide alternative vocational courses that \ninitiate students into specific occupations in the agricultural, industrial, and service sectors of the \neconomy.  Furthermore,  the  Project  will  support  NIE  in  developing  a  civics  curriculum  that \npromotes interethnic understanding and reconciliation. This will build upon work initiated under \nMOE to establish an inclusive curriculum development process.   \n\nBuilding Capacity of the Ministry of Education \n\n36. \nThis  subcomponent  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  MOE  to  develop  procedures  and \nmechanisms  for  creating  stronger  linkages  and  coordination  with  the  provincial  and  zonal \nauthorities. MOE\u2019s capacity to conduct monitoring and evaluation activities on a consistent basis \nat  all  levels  will  be  strengthened.  Ten  study  tours  for  project  management  office  (PMO)  and \nMOE  technical  staff  per  year  will  be  provided  in  the  fields  of  civil  works,  project  management, \neducation system management, monitoring and evaluation, and financial management.  \n\n \n37. \nThe  Project  will  build  upon  work  started  under  the  GEP  2  and  SEMP  to  introduce  E-\ngovernance  to  the  education  system,  including  the  design  and  piloting  of  an  education \nmanagement  information  system  (EMIS)  to  improve  school  administration  at  institutional, \ndistrict, zonal, and ministerial levels. The Project will provide consulting services and training for \nMOE  staff  in  piloting  the  additional  phases  of  EMIS  implementation.  The  adoption  of  EMIS \nnationwide will take several years to complete, and the Project will support the initial piloting of \nan information system linking MOE with all provincial and zonal offices in the country. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nand \n\nDecentralization \n\nSpecial Features \n\nInstitutional  Development.  The  Project \n\nC. \n \npromotes \n38. \ndecentralization  policy \nin  education  planning, \nimplementation  by  giving  greater  roles \nmanagement,  and  monitoring  to  provinces,  zones,  divisions,  and  stakeholders  at  the  school \nlevel. It supports institutional development at zone and school level, by giving a larger share of \ntechnical assistance, training, and staff development to the zonal offices and school personnel. \nPiloting the SMC start-up grant, preparing SDPs, and managing SDGs will help raise awareness \non  SBM  and  build  schools\u2019  self-management  capacity.  The  establishment  of  pools  of  zonal \nfacilitators to conduct on-site facilitation and monitoring of schools' activities will strengthen the \nroles  of  zonal  offices  and  provide  greater  technical  support  to  teachers  and  principals.  The \nprovincial education departments will have full-time PMOs and will play a greater role in project \nplanning and management,  such  as  selecting  target  schools  and  prioritizing  project  inputs  in \ntheir own provinces.  \n\n \n39. \nSchool Development Plans. The SDPs will serve two purposes: (i) develop leadership \nand  self-management  capacity  of  schools  and  SMC  members,  including  cost-recovery \nmeasures to enable the school to become more financially self-reliant; and (ii) provide teaching \nand  facility  management  plans  that  show  commitment  and  readiness  from  stakeholders  at  all \nlevels to exploit and sustain facilities and financial support provided by the Project. The SDPs \nwill be prepared by the schools and SMCs as appropriate, and should be approved by zone and \nprovincial education offices, and MOE. No physical facilities or financial support will be provided \nto the schools without the submission and approval of the SDP.  \n\n \n40. \nContinuity  between  the  SEMP  and  the  Project.  Development  in  the  subsector  is  a \ncontinuing process. To maintain the momentum of innovation and modernization initiated by the \nSEMP,  the  two  projects  will  be  seen  as  phased  investments  within  a  long-term development \nstrategy  for  secondary  education.  The  PMO  established  for  the  SEMP  will  continue  working \nunder  the  Project.  The  SEMP  will  provide  preparatory  activities such as the needs analysis of \nthe  target  schools,  and  up-front  capacity-building  activities  such  as  awareness  raising  of  the \nprovincial  and  zonal  stakeholders,  and  training  of  zonal  trainers/facilitators.  Target  schools \nsupported by the SEMP will continue to be supported under the Project through the provision of \ntraining, monitoring and technical assistance.   \n\n \n41.   Building  Social  Cohesion.  Support  for  the  role  of  education  in  reconciliation  and \nbuilding  of  social  cohesion  is  reflected  in  each  project  component.  Teaching  methodologies, \ncurriculum  content,  and  SBA  that  foster  interethnic  understanding  and  development  of  civic \neducation will be promoted.  \n\n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n42. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $47.0  million  equivalent,  including taxes, \nduties,  interest  charge  on  the  ADB  loan,  and  physical  and  price  contingencies.  The  foreign \nexchange cost is estimated at $14.6 million (31.1%), and the local currency cost at $32.4 million \nequivalent  (68.9%)  of  the  total  cost.  A  summary  of  the  cost  estimates  is  given  in  Table  1. \nDetailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 5. \n\n \n \n \n\n\f11 \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\n1.

The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons \nfor its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n44. \nThe  loan  will  cover  74.4%  of  the  total  project  cost.  ADB  will  fund  100%  of  the  foreign \nexchange  cost  (31.1%  of  the  estimated  total  project  cost),  and  $20.4  million  equivalent  of  the \nlocal currency cost or about 62.8% of the total local currency cost. Interest during construction \nwill be capitalized as indicated in Table 1. The remaining $12.0 million equivalent as counterpart \nfinancing  (25.6%  of  the  total  project  cost)  will  be  provided  by  the  Government  ($10.3  million) \nand  beneficiaries  ($1.7  million).  The  Government  will  provide  for  local  currency costs of civil \nworks.  SDSs  or  SMCs  will  provide  $1.7  million  equivalent  for  operational  expenditures  for  the \nmultimedia rooms, libraries, and computer-learning rooms (electricity charges, Internet charges, \nschool security, library books, and allowances for zonal training specialists/facilitators), and in-\nkind labor contribution for civil works.

A  project  steering  committee  will  provide  overall  guidance  to  the  Project, \nmonitor its activities and outputs, provide feedback to the PMO, and help coordinate and liaise \nwith other government agencies and departments. Chaired by the MOE secretary, the steering \ncommittee  will  comprise  representatives  from  MOE,  External  Resources  Department  of  the \nMinistry  of  Finance,  National  Planning  Department,  NIE,  NETS,  provincial  ministries  of \neducation, and National Education Commission.  \n \n46. \nThe central PMO will oversee day-to-day project implementation, and consist of a project \ndirector and staff appointed by MOE. The project director will be a member of project steering \ncommittee  and  report  directly  to  it.  Five  specialists  for  administration  and  finance,  educational \ndevelopment, procurement, engineering and civil works, and benefit monitoring and evaluation \nwill assist the project director. One of the staff should also have expertise in social development, \ngender,  and  interethnic  understanding.  The  Project  will  provide  support  staff,  equipment,  and \noperating expenses for the PMO. The PMO will have overall responsibility for project planning, \nbudgeting, monitoring, reporting, supervision of various studies, and coordination with provincial \nand zonal authorities. The PMO will coordinate the work of the consultants. To ensure continuity \nbetween the SEMP and the Project, PMO staff under the SEMP will be retained, subject to their \nsatisfactory  performance.  Through  SEMP  implementation,  MOE  has  demonstrated  sufficient \nfinancial management capacity to implement the Project. \n \nEach province will have a provincial PMO staffed by a provincial project manager and a \n47. \nsecretary. They will be attached to the provincial department of education and be supported with \na transportation and operational budget. Each provincial PMO will have specific responsibilities \nto coordinate and account for all project activities occurring in the province and will report to the \ncentral  PMO.  In  particular,  the  provincial  PMO  will  help  the  zonal  officers  compile  the  list  of \nschool  needs,  prepare  the  provincial  priority  list  for  school  resource  allocation,  manage and \ndisburse the SDG, and investigate and attempt to resolve complaints concerning the Project at \nthe subprovincial level. The overall project management structure is presented in Appendix 6. A \nproject implementation mechanism is described in Supplementary Appendix G.  \n \n48 \nSchool Development Planning Process.  The schools and SMCs, as appropriate, will \nprepare  the  SDPS,  guided  by  the  zonal  facilitators.  Prior  to  SDP  preparation,  schools  will \n\n\f13 \n\nfor  monitoring  civil  works,  provision  of  equipment, \n\nreceive  extensive  training  in  SBM.  The  schools  will  submit  the  SDP  to  the  zonal  education \noffice, which will review the SDP and approve it before submission to the provincial PMO. The \nprovincial PMO will submit the SDP for approval of the provincial  MOE, except for the SDPs of \nnational schools, which MOE administers directly, and which MOE will approve. The provincial \nPMO will then send the SDPs to the central PMO, which submits the SDPs to MOE for formal \napproval.  Once  approved,  the  central  PMO  will  proceed  with  procuring  civil  works  and \nequipment. The provincial PMO will disburse the annual allocation of the SDG. Zonal facilitators \nwill  be  responsible \ntraining,  and \nimplementation  of  activities  by  the  schools.  The  provincial  and  central  PMOs  will  conduct \nrandom compliance monitoring of the schools. The zonal education office will submit the school \nmonitoring  reports  to  the  central  PMO  through  the  provincial  PMO.  The provincial and central \nPMOs will closely monitor that no school receives physical facilities or SDG without an approved \nSDP. All stakeholders will receive adequate training in their respective roles and functions. The \nschool planning process and the training plan are in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \n49. \nA complaint investigation and resolution mechanism will be established within the MOE\u2019s \nInternal  Auditors  Department.  This  mechanism  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  reviewing  and \naddressing complaints from end-users, beneficiaries, and other project stakeholders in relation \nto any project component, any of the service providers, or any person responsible for carrying \nout  any  aspect  of  the  Project;  and  (ii)  establishing  the  threshold  criteria  and  procedures  for \nhandling  such  complaints,  including  publicizing  the  mechanism,  and  for  proactively  and \nconstructively responding to them. A full-time MOE professional staff member will be dedicated \nto the unit and report directly to the MOE secretary. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n50. \nThe Project will be implemented  over 5 years from early 2005 to December 2009. The \nPMO will be made fully operational by December 2004.The indicative implementation schedule \nis in Appendix 7.   \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nAll  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n51. \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  All  civil  works  contracts  under  the  Project  will  be  awarded  under \nlocal competitive bidding among prequalified contractors in accordance with the Government\u2019s \nstandard procurement procedures and other requirements satisfactory  to ADB. Civil works will \nbe  financed  by  ADB,  Government,  and  beneficiaries.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  all \nprocurement. The indicative procurement package is in Appendix 8. \n \n\na. \n\nCivil Works \n\n \n52. \nCivil works will involve the development of physical infrastructure and facilities of 1C and \n1AB  schools  that  are  below  the  baseline  conditions.  Civil  works  will  include  upgrading  or \ninstalling  a  library,  science  lab,  and  activity  room.  It  will  also  include  partitioning  classrooms, \nproviding  drinking  water,  and  constructing  toilets  where  required.  The  provincial  PMOs  will  be \nresponsible for monitoring quality, costs, and implementation. They will ensure quality standards \nfor water supply and toilet facilities to minimize environmental impact. Schools that have been \nrehabilitated  by  other  projects  such  as  the  NECORD  and  SIRUP  II  will  not  be  included  in  the \ncivil works under the Project, unless justified as an essential need for the school.  \n \n\n\f14 \n\nb. \n\nEquipment and Materials  \n\n \n53. \nSupply contracts for goods estimated at $500,000 equivalent or more will be awarded on \nthe  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding.  Supply  contracts  for  goods  such  as  vehicles, \nsoftware,  and  computers  less  than  $500,000,  but  more  than  $100,000,  will  follow  international \nshopping  procedures.  Supply  contracts for locally available instructional materials of less than \n$500,000, but more than $100,000, will follow local competitive bidding procedures. Minor items \ncosting less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured by direct purchase.  \n \n54. \nThe Project will finance the procurement of standard packages of science equipment for \nteaching  O-level  science  and  technology,  and  basic  equipment  for  activity  rooms  to  enable \nschools to offer technical options within technical studies. In addition, the Project will finance the \npurchase of grade 12\u201313 science kits for those schools being upgraded from 1C to 1AB status. \nBasic  sets  of  audiovisual  equipment  will  be  purchased  for  multimedia  rooms.  Computers, \nprinters,  uninterrupted  power  supplies,  and  air  conditioners  will  be  purchased  for  the  CLCs, \nwhich  will  include  at  least  one  computer  with  CD-RW/DVD-ROM  combination  drive.  Furniture \nwill be purchased as part of upgrading schools to acceptable standards.   \n \n55. \nThe  Project  will  finance  the  purchase  of  library  books,  print-based  materials,  and \neducational  courseware  for  libraries.  Subject-specific  software  for  O-  and  A-level  English, \nmathematics, science, and technical studies will be procured from international suppliers who \ncan  deliver  the  software  in  three  languages  (English,  Sinhala,  and  Tamil).  Other  educational \ncourseware  that  will  be  purchased  includes  curriculum -free  software  such  as  Encarta, \nEncyclopedia Britannica. ICT learning guides for both teachers and students will be purchased. \nAs  the  estimated  package  costs  are  less  than  $500,000,  procurement  will  be  made  in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, and procedures will follow international \nshopping  or  direct  purchase  as  applicable.  Career  guidance  materials  and  student  counseling \nand evaluation  tests  may  be  procured  locally  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard \nprocedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nThe Project will provide 270 person-months of consulting services (108 international and \n56. \n162  domestic).  International  consultants  will  be  needed  for  (i)  training  master  trainers  in  key \nareas  such  as  SBA,  SBM,  TLR  development,  ICT-based  pedagogy,  and  innovative  teaching \nmethods;  (ii)  courseware  procurement  and  evaluation;  (iii)  curriculum  development  and \nassessment;  (iv)  library  development  and  management;  (v)  management  capacity  building  for \nprovincial  offices  and  the  PTDUs;  and  (vi)  EMIS.  Domestic  consultants  will  (i)  help  the \ninternational  consultants  plan  and  deliver  the  training,  and  (ii)  support  the  international \neducation  management specialists working within the PTDUs. A domestic consultant in social \ninterethnic \ndevelopment  will  help \nunderstanding. The Government will select and engage all ADB-financed consultants through a \nfirm using quality and cost-based selection and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. The required consulting services and the outline terms of reference are in Appendix \n9. \n \n \n \n57. \nExtensive in-country and limited international training will be provided under the Project \nwith  a  total  of  about  314,800  in-country  training  person-days  and  about  9,590  international \n\nthe  PMO  ensure  promotion  of  gender  equity  and \n\nStaff Development and Training \n\n5. \n\n\f15 \n\ntraining person-days. Selection of candidates for all training will follow the Government\u2019s general \nguidelines on training under development-funded projects. ADB approval will be required before \nthe  award  of  international  fellowships.  ADB  will  be  provided  with  a  list  of  (i)  the  nominated \ncandidates,  (ii)  their  qualifications,  and  (iii)  detailed  cost  of  the  proposed  courses.  Candidates \nfor  international  fellowships  from  zonal  offices  should  not  be  more  than  52  years  of  age. \nTeachers selected for international fellowships will have served for a year in schools in difficult \nareas5  prior  to  the  training  and  will  serve  for  2  more  years  after  the  training.  The  staff \ndevelopment and training plan is in Appendix 10.  \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n58. \nTo  expedite  implementation  through  the  timely  release  of  ADB\u2019s  share  of  funds  for \neligible expenditures, an imprest account will be established in the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in \nColombo.  It  will  be  managed  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement \nHandbook,  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  initial \ndeposit to the  imprest account  will  not  exceed  10  percent  of  the  loan  or  the  future  6  months \nestimated expenditures, whichever is less. Statement of expenditures procedures in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  will  be  used  for  individual  payments  not  exceeding \n$100,000.  The  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditures  procedures  will  be  audited  as \npart of the regular audit of the Project\u2019s account and financial statements. The audit opinion on \nthe imprest account and statement of expenditures should be set out separately. In the case of \nthe SDGs, which will be disbursed by the provincial PMO, the Government will advance funds \nfrom its own budget to the provincial PMO. The provincial PMO will submit expenditure details \nto  the  central  PMO,  which  will  reimburse  the  Government  from  the  imprest  account. ADB will \nreplenish  the  imprest  account  when  the  central  PMO  submits  a  withdrawal  application  for \nreplenishment that incorporates project expenditure including the SDGs. All other expenditures \nwill be made through the imprest account managed by the central PMO.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n59. \nThe Government, acting through MOE, will maintain records and accounts adequate to \nidentify goods and services financed from the loan proceeds. The Government will ensure that \neach  Provincial  Council  maintains  adequate  records  and  accounts  for  the  Project.  MOE  will \nmaintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project  and  ensure  that  accounts and financial statements \nare audited annually by independent external auditors acceptable to ADB. The auditor\u2019s report \nand  copies  of  the  certified  accounts  and  related  financial  statements,  including  the  auditor\u2019s \nopinion  on  the  use  of  loan  proceeds,  com pliance with loan covenants, and use of the imprest \naccount under ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure, will be submitted to ADB in English \nnot  later  than  9  months  after  the  close  of  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  year.  The  independent \nexternal auditing services will be financed from the loan proceeds. \n \n60. \nThe  PMO  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  project  implementation  and  submit  them  to \nADB within 30 days after each quarter. The reports will be in a format acceptable to ADB and \nindicate  (i)  progress  against  established  targets,  (ii)  status  of  performance  indicators,  (iii) \nproblems  encountered  and  steps  taken  to  resolve  the  problems,  (iv)  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants, and (v) program activities proposed for the following quarter. Within 3 months after \nproject  completion,  the  PMO  will  prepare  a  project  completion  report  and  submit  it  to  ADB \ndescribing project implementation, accomplishments, benefits, and impact. \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n5 Based on the list of schools in difficult areas provided by MOE. \n\n\f16 \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\na. \n\nAnnual Operational Plans \n\n61. \nBy December  of  each  year  of  project  implementation,  MOE  will  provide  ADB  with  an \nannual operating plan for the following fiscal year. The plan will include (i) data on the proposed \nallocations to secondary education; (ii) status of agreed-upon policy reforms and covenants; (iii) \nfully  costed  project  activities  proposed  for  each  subcomponent,  with  performance  targets;  and \n(iv) a list of secondary schools targeted for upgrading during the year. The plan will also provide \nestimates of the operation and maintenance budget and ensure that adequate counterpart funds \nare provided. \n \n\nb. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n62. \nAn adequately developed monitoring and evaluation system will be installed in MOE and \naccessed through the PMO. It will monitor and evaluate implementation performance, improve \nmanagement  information,  and  assess  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  improving  the  secondary \neducation system. Project performance monitoring will focus upon project implementation plans \nand  targets,  and  their  execution  and  achievement.  For  monitoring  and  measuring  project \nperformance,  accurate  indicators  will  be  used  such  as  school  enrollments;  deployment  of \nscience teachers to underprivileged regions; examination results including SBA; implementation \nof  SBM  in  target  schools,  and  the  extent  of  school-based training for principals and teachers. \nThe  central  PMO  will  monitor  project  activities,  using  data  and  feedback  from  the  provincial \nPMO, and data received from consultants and other institutions such as NETS and NIE. \n \n63.  MOE  will  monitor  and  evaluate  the  outcomes  of  the  Project  after  completion,  in \naccordance  with  the  schedule  and  terms  of  reference  to  be  agreed,  upon  by  the  Government \nand ADB. Performance evaluations will examine the impact of project interventions: (i) bringing \nschools below the baseline conditions up to the accepted standard; (ii) improving science labs, \nactivity rooms, and libraries; (iii) providing ICT resources to schools in rural and conflict-affected \nareas; (iv) deploying more science teachers to rural areas; (v) supporting  the start-up of SMC; \nand (vi) developing a cadre of zonal facilitators in each zone.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n64. \nADB and the Government will conduct a semiannual review of project performance. The \nreview  will  include  an  examination  of  the  budgetary  allocations,  operation  and  maintenance \ncosts,  staffing  and  other  incremental  requirement  costs,  implementation  arrangements,  and \nachievements  under  the  Project.  The  review  includes  assessing  progress  in  each  component, \nidentifying difficulties and constraints, and determining ways to overcome them. \n \n65. \nThe Government and ADB will jointly conduct a midterm review during the third year of \nimplementation.  The  review  will  (i)  review  the  scope,  design,  and  project  implementation \narrangements;  (ii)  evaluate  pilot  programs;  (iii)  assess  performance  against  targets  and \nbenchmarks; (iv) review lessons and experiences in secondary education development focusing \non  SBA,  SBM,  infrastructure  and  facilities  development,  school  development  planning,  and \nteaching  and  learning  methods;  (v)  review  compliance  with  the  loan  agreement;  and  (vi) \nrecommend changes in project implementation if required.  \n \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Benefits  \n\nA. \n \n66. \nEducational  Benefits.  The  Project  will  directly  benefit  approximately  1,100  type  1AB \nand  1C  schools  that  have  not  benefited  from  external  assistance  in  the  past.  The  Project  will \nbenefit  around  200,000  grade  10\u201313 secondary school students each year.  In  addition,  other \nstudents  in  these  schools  will  benefit  from  improvements  in  school facilities, enhanced school \nmanagerial capacity, and more motivated teachers. The total school population that will benefit \nfrom the Project is approximately 825,000 students per year from 2005\u20132009. The students in \nthe 1,100 schools will benefit from improved teaching methods, continuous assessment of their \nlearning  by  teachers,  modern  school  libraries,  improved  access  to  science  and  technical \nsubjects,  improved  career  guidance  services,  relevant  subject-specific  software  in  three \nlanguages, and a more practical orientation to the curriculum. Students in all 2,300 secondary \nschools will benefit from system-wide support to devolve education management; reform of the \nassessment  system;  modernized  curriculum;  and  enhanced  capacity  of  provincial,  zonal,  and \ndivisional  offices  in  education  planning,  management,  and  monitoring.  Furthermore,  the  800 \nschools  supported  by  the  SEMP  will  continue  to  benefit  from  the  Project  through  training, \nmonitoring and technical assistance.  \n \nSocial Benefit and Impact on Peace Building, Reconciliation, and Social Cohesion. \n67. \nRecognizing  the  importance  of  addressing  social  disparities  in  peace-building  situations,  the \nProject  will  help  improve  equity  of  access  to  quality  secondary  education  by  creating  better \neducational opportunities for students in disadvantaged areas. It will support peace building by \npromoting  and  facilitating  interethnic  understanding  and  social  cohesion  in  the  education \nsystem, through initiatives, such as: (i) recruiting Tamil-speaking ICT technicians to help schools \nin  the  north-east  implement  their  ICT  programs;  (ii)  ensuring  that  at  least  25%  of  the  zonal \nfacilitators  are  Tamil  speaking;  (iii)  supporting  NIE  in  the  development  of  civics  curricula  that \npromotes  intercultural  understanding  and  reconciliation;  (iv)  requiring  the  zonal  facilitators  to \nprovide school-based training in teaching approaches that foster understanding between ethnic \ngroups;  (v)  promoting  the  learning  of  English  as  a  link  language  by  providing  English  as  a \nsecond language educational software; (vi) promoting the use of three languages in the CLCs \nby  providing  subject-specific  software  in  English,  Sinhala,  and  Tamil;  and  (viii)  recruiting \ntrilingual  provincial  project  managers.  A  detailed  description  on  the  impact  on  peace  building, \nreconciliation, and social cohesion is in Appendix 11.  \n \nImpact  on  Poverty  and  Gender  Mainstreaming.  The  Project  will  yield  particular \n68. \nbenefits for students in disadvantaged and conflict-affected areas by focusing on upgrading all \ntarget  schools  that  are  below  the  acceptable  baseline  conditions  .  Fifty  percent  of  the  target \nschools  are  located  in  the  poorest  seven  districts6  and  the  north-east  region.  The  Project  will \nensure  benefits  to  poor  students  by  providing  stipends  to  48,000  students.  The  Project  will \ncontribute  to  increased  O-  and  A-level  pass  rates  in  the  most  disadvantaged  areas,  which  in \nturn  will  lead  to  greater  income  opportunities.  Gender-based  stereotypes  in  secondary \neducation will be addressed through awareness raising at all levels.  \n \n69. \nEconomic Benefit and Financial Sustainability. Economic benefits of the investment \nin  secondary  education  can  be  measured  by  potential  increases  in  wages  due  to  higher \neducational  achievement  of  the  graduates.  The  Government  is  committed  to  improving  the \nquality of secondary education, and increasing its efficiency to meet requirements of the labor \n                                                 \n6  Those  are  the  dis tricts  of  Badulla,  Hambantota,  Kegalle,  Kurunegala,  Matale,  Monaragala,  and  Ratnapura,  which \nhave more than 30% of poor households according to the Department of Census and Statistic\u2019s survey in 2002.  \n\n\f18 \n\nProject Risks  \n\nmarket.  A  system-wide  upgrade,  with  a  special  focus  on  minimizing  educational  disparities \nacross regions is expected to contribute to an increase in the pass rates at O and A levels. The \nProject will also respond to the Government\u2019s strategy to modernize the secondary curriculum \nwith an emphasis on science and technology, English, and ICT; and a practical orientation that \nmeets labor market demand. An improvement in the pass rate of O and A levels, and a more \npractical orientation will lead to better employment and income perspectives.   \n \n70.  \nThe Government has provided free formal education from primary to university since the \nmid-1940s.  The  general  education budget  has  averaged  83.5%  for  recurrent  expenditure  and \n16.5%  for  capital  expenditure.  The  project  cost  will  be  equivalent  to  about  25%  of  the  total \ncapital budget from the second year to the rest of the project life. This will have minimum impact \non  the  total  capital  budget.  The  Project  minimizes  capital  investment  in  new  buildings,  but \nupgrades or rehabilitates existing facilities. Beneficiaries are expected to contribute in-kind labor \nfor rehabilitation work. The  Government has given assurance that it will provide operation and \nmaintenance  costs  after  the  implementation  period  for  certain  activities  initiated  and  facilities \nprovided  by  the  Project.  The  incremental  recurrent  cost  for  7  years  after  project  completion  is \nestimated at approximately 0.3 % of the annual total general education budget, or  2.2 to 3% of \nthe  annual  capital  budget,  and  is  considered  sustainable.  The  Project  includes  measures  to \nincrease  ownership  of  the  schools  and  build  their  capacity  for  cost  recovery.  A  summary \neconomic and financial analysis is in Appendix 12.  \n \nB. \n \n71. \nSustainability of Project Investment. The SEMP and GEP 2 demonstrate that facilities \nsuch  as  computers,  multimedia  units,  or  modern  science  laboratories  will  not  be  used  and \nsustained  if  the  Project  fails  to  ensure  (i)  adequate  teaching  staff;  (ii)  up-front  capacity \ndevelopment  of  end-users  and  beneficiaries;  and  (iii)  commitment  and  ownership  of  province, \nzone,  division,  and  school  stakeholders.  Moreover,  the  schools  are  expected  to  build  cost-\nrecovery system for the CLCs. However, schools in poor communities may not be able to self-\nsustain. Innovations such as SBA and SBM need a continuing process of capacity development \nand  monitoring  before  they  can  be  integrated  into  the  system.  The  Government  has  given \nassurance  that  it  will  finance  incremental  recurrent  cost  for  7  years  after  project  completion. \nExternal  factors  such  as  political  change  and  changes  in  project  management  may  affect \nsustainability of the Project.   \n \n72. \nDecentralization. The Government is committed to decentralizing education and SBM. \nHowever,  accelerated  decentralization  may  bring  resistance  and  misunderstanding  about  the \nconcept of decentralization and SBM, and fail to secure stakeholder commitment. Stakeholders \nmay  not  have  the  capacity  to  implement  decentralization.  The  Project  gives  greater  roles  to \nzonal  offices  to  facilitate  and  monitor  school  activities.  However,  developing  the  appropriate \ninstitutional  framework  will  be  crucial  to  supporting  the  zonal  and  divisional  stakeholders to \nassume  new  functions.  A  decentralized  management  system  would  also  entail  a  strong  and \ntransparent accountability mechanism  \n \nSocial  and  Environmental  Measures.  The  Project  does  not  foresee  any  significant \n73. \nadverse  social  impact,  and  will  ensure  benefits  across  ethnic  groups  to  mitigate  any  risk  of \nexacerbating  ethnic  tensions.  However,  project  interventions  in  target  schools  located  in  the \nconflict-affected areas may be affected by the conditions of the peace process. Selective inputs \nof  modern  education  facilities  may  cause  disparities  among  schools  with  different  levels  of \nabsorptive capacity. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 13 and \nthe summary ethnic minority development framework in Appendix 14. Civil work for construction \n\n\f19 \n\nof  new  classrooms  and  laboratories  will  be  minimal;  no  adverse  environment  impact  is \nanticipated. The  impact  of  such  construction  work  on  individual  and  communal  properties  has \nbeen  reviewed.  No  individuals/households  will  be  displaced.  Supplementary  Appendix  I \nprovides a resettlement framework.  \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n\n \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \n74. \nassurances, which form the basis for the covenants incorporated in the Loan Agreement: \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n \n(i) \n\nWithin  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  ensure  MOE \nestablishes  a  complaint  investigation  and  resolution  mechanism  within  MOE\u2019s \nInternal Auditors Department;   \n\n(ii)  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will have obtained a letter \nof commitment from each provincial council agreeing to implement the Project in \ntheir respective province and agreeing to implement the terms and conditions of \nthe Loan Agreement to the extent within their responsibility; \n\n(iii)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will ensure each zone to \nprovide  a  letter  of  agreement  and  acknowledgement  to  each  provincial  council \nagreeing  to  implement  the  Project  in  their  respective  zone  and  to  carry  out  the \nactivities requested by the provincial council; \n\n(iv)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will prepare a review and \nsynthesis  of  its  policy  on  decentralization  in  education,  and  develop  a  series  of \naction plans for implementing decentralization of education.

Some  achievements  of  the  Sri  Lankan  education  system are \nremarkable.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  literacy  rate  of  92%  is  one  of  the  highest  in  Asia,  and  enrolment  in \nprimary level schooling is 95%. Females make up around 50% of the total student population.  \n \n2. \nThe general education system of Sri Lanka comprises four stages: the primary (grades \n1\u20135), junior secondary (grades 6\u20139), and senior secondary consisting of the ordinary level (O-\nlevel) (grades 10\u201311), and the advanced level (A-level) (grades 12\u201313). The education system \nconsists of four different types of schools:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nType 1AB: cover the education cycle from grades 1\u201313, or grades 6-13 in some \ncases , and offer the full curriculum for the A-level, including arts, commerce, and \nscience; \nType  1C:  cover  the  education  cycle  from  grades  1\u201313,  or  grades  6-13 in some \ncases,  but offer only arts and commerce for the A-level; \nType  2:  cover  grades  1\u201311,  and  prepare  students  for  the  GCE  O-level \nexamination at grade 11; and \nType 3: cover the primary education (grades 1\u20135) or up to grades 1\u20138. \n\nInequities in Access to Effective Secondary Education \n\n3. \nCurrently  about  10,000  government  schools  enroll  approximately  4  million  students. \nAmong those, 323 national schools (either 1AB or 1C) are directly administered by the Ministry \nof  Education  (MOE),  while  the  rest  are  administered  by  the  provincial  education  authorities. \nMore  than  2,300  1AB  and  1C  schools  and  4,200  type  2  schools  enroll  0.98  million  senior \nsecondary students. Type 1AB schools are generally located in prosperous urban areas. Type \n1C schools are normally situated in poorer urban and semi-urban areas. Type 2 and 3 schools \nare  usually  found  in  rural  and  remote  areas.  Approximately  75%  of  all  schools  are  Sinhala-\nlanguage  and  25%  are  Tamil.  However,  the  proportion  varies  across  districts.  In  the  Northern \nand  Eastern  provinces,  98%  and  74%  of  schools  are  Tamil  speaking,  respectively.  In  the \nCentral Province,  Nuwara Eliya District also has a high percentage of Tamil-language schools \n(57%). \n \nB. \n \nThe  single  biggest  problem  facing  the  secondary  education  system  of  Sri  Lanka  is  the \n4. \nlack  of  universal  access  to  effective  secondary  education.  Among  the  25  districts,  the most \nadvantaged  districts  with  respect  to  offering  senior  secondary  education  are  Colombo, \nGampaha,  Galle,  Jaffna,  Kandy,  and  Kurunegala.  At  the  other  end  of  the  scale,  the  most \ndisadvantaged  districts  in  providing  access  to  senior  secondary  education  are  Vavuniya, \nMullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Polonnaruwa, Nuwara Eliya, and Monaragala. \n \n5. \nThe extent of the overall problem of inequitable access to effective secondary education \ncan be appreciated by considering Figure A2. The availability of effective secondary education \nis affected by (i) the area in which the student lives, whether rural, conflict affected, and so on; \n(ii)  the  income  level  of  the  parents,  which  affects  their  ability  to  supplement  their  child\u2019s \neducation with private tuition, or their ability to send the child away to a better school than those \navailable  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  home;  and  (iii)  ethnicity,  since  typically  materials  are \ninitially  produced  in  Sinhala,  and  the  translations  sometimes  reach  the  Tamil  community  late, \nare not of good quality.  \n\n\f \n\n                     Appendix 2 \n\n \n27\n\n \n6. \nThe  distribution  of  qualified  teachers  across  the  country  is  inequitable,  as  the national \nteacher  transfer  policy,  which  allocates  teachers  equitably,  has  not  been  implemented \neffectively. Acute imbalances exist between urban and rural, and between Sinhala- and Tamil-\nspeaking schools. A shortage of trained teachers exists for all subjects in Tamil schools, except \nin grades 6\u201311 in the Western and Southern provinces. In Kilinochchi, over 35% of the teachers \nin the government school system are trainees, in Mullaitivu, nearly 30%. In five more districts, \ni.e.,  Mannar,  Vavuniya,  Batticaloa,  Nuwara  Eliya  and  Jaffna,  from  1  to  2  of  every  10  teachers \nare trainees.  \n \n7. \nMany  secondary  schools  lack  even  the  most  basic  facilities  and  infrastructure,  and  the \nfacilities are not conducive to stimulating and effective teaching and learning. Many classrooms \nare  overcrowded,  and  do  not  support  activity-based  learning.  Water  and  sanitation  are \nsometimes  not  available.  Some  schools  do  not  have  proper  classrooms,  or  even  partitioned \nareas,  teachers  or  students  have  no  storage  areas  to  lock  away  their  personal  belongings. \nMany schools have an inadequately stocked or staffed library, or no library at all.  \n \n8. \nAll  senior  secondary  schools  must  teach  science  and  technology  and  one  or  more \ntechnical subjects to the O-level. Therefore, all schools are required to have an  activity room to \nsupport  the  acquisition  of  technical  skills,  activity-based  learning,  and  practical  work;  and  a \ngeneral  science  laboratory  to  support  the  science  and  technology  O-level.  However,  many \nschools have not been provided with activity rooms and sufficient equipment, and are unable to \nundertake a meaningful study of even the most popular technical subjects. Where facilities exist, \nthey are often out of date or poorly maintained. \n \nC. \n \n9. \nThe 13th Amendment to the Constitution in 1987 and the Provincial Councils Act No. 42 \nof 1987 devolved many functions of educational administration and decision-making authorities \nto the provincial education authorities, consisting of the provincial ministries and departments of \neducation. In 1991, the National Education Commission was established as the highest body to \nformulate  education  policies.  While  MOE  still  holds  the  overall  planning  and  implementation \nresponsibility for general education and administers specific schools, including national schools, \nspecial  schools  for  service  personnel,  and  schools  for  specific  development  schemes,   the \nprovincial  education  authorities  have  become  responsible  for  administering  all  state  schools \nother  than  the  specific  schools  noted.  Below  the  provincial  ministries  and  departments  of \neducation  are  zonal  and  divisional  education  offices,  which  are  responsible  for  day-to-day \nschool administration, implementation of education policies, and monitoring schools.  \n \n10. \nThe current  provincial  system  has  been by and large settled after  going through a few \nadjustments, but it is often  criticized  that  the complex  system with multiple layers has created \nunclear lines of command and duplication of functions at different levels. Moreover, inadequate \nhuman  and  financial  resources  at  zonal  and  divisional  levels  have  hindered  development  of \neffective  monitoring and evaluation  functions. Thus, MOE  recognizes the importance of these \noffices and has initiated certain activities to strengthen them. For instance, it trained zonal and \ndivisional officers in zonal planning for the secondary education development.  \n \n11. \nEducation  financing,  particularly  the  management  of  capital  budget,  is  still  highly \ncentralized,  but  has  been  gradually  decentralized  in  recent  years.  In  2000, the  Government \nintroduced an education capital budget for provinces. In addition, the  Government introduced a \ndirect funding mechanism for schools to be responsible for managing and procuring education \n\nEducation Management and School-Based Management \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nReform of Assessment Systems  \n\nquality  inputs  at  the  schools.  Though  schools  have  required  some  time  to  adopt  the  new \nmechanism, and/or some schools have felt the new responsibility as a burden, the  introduction \nof  quality  inputs  is  generally  appreciated  by  schools  as  they  are  now  allowed  to  identify  and \nprocure materials according to their needs in classrooms. \n \n12. \nThe  Government  has  made  various  efforts  to  decentralize  management  authorities  to \nschools.  Historically,  most  schools  have  a  functioning  school  development  society,  which \ngenerally  supports  the  school  by  providing  financial  and  labor  contributions.  The  school \ndevelopment boards Act No. 8 was introduced in 1993, in which the school development boards \nwere tasked to advise and assist the principal in matters connected with the development of the \nschool, including maintaining the school development fund. The act was abolished in 1995, as it \nfaced  resistance  from  certain  stakeholders,  including  those  who  feared  that  an  introduction of \nthe school development boards might lead to privatization of government schools. \n \n13. \nIn  2001  a  school-based  management  (SBM)  handbook  for  principals  was  drafted.  It \nproposed establishment of the school management board/council, with functions similar to those \nfor the school development boards proposed earlier. Although the handbook was not  finalized \nthen,  the  current  Government  has  resumed  the  process  of  promoting  SBM,  including \nestablishing  a  national  consensus  on  the  concept  of  SBM.  MOE  has  also  commenced  a  pilot \nproject  on  SBM  with  10  selected  schools,  and  is  planning  to  expand  it  with  another  group  of \nschools.  This is  a  critical time for the  Government  to  establish  a  national  consensus,  and  to \ngradually implement the SBM policy across the country. \n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe  Sri  Lankan  secondary  education  is  an  examination-dominated  system  that  every \nyear fails to produce an acceptable pass rate among students. This applies both at O- and A-\nlevel. At the O-level, only 40% qualify for A-level, and only 30% qualify for science A-levels by \ngaining  a  credit  pass  in  O-level  science  and  technology.  This  partly  explains  why only around \n22%  of  Sri  Lankan  A-level  students  take  the  sciences.  The  low  pass  rate  in  science  and \ntechnology  also  arises  from  disparities  in  the  availability  of  properly  trained  science  teachers, \nlaboratories,  and  the  equipment  needed  to  support  technical subjects. Two other compulsory \nsubjects  have  even  higher  failure  rates  (mathematics,  at  around  50%  failing,  and  English \nlanguage, with nearly 70% failing annually). All three subjects have been made compulsory at \nthe  O-level,  but  all  three  have  not  been  given  the  support,  in  terms  of  teacher  training  and \ndevelopment,  and  teaching  and  learning  resources,  required  to  ensure  they  can  be  effectively \ntaught. At the A-level, only around 40% of students qualify for university, but only about 10% of \nthem gain places, as the capacity of the Sri Lankan state university is so small. This means that \nonly 2% of the 20\u201325 age group are in university.  \n \nThe examination domination and lack of practical orientation have led to the realization \n15. \nof the need for continuous assessment that includes practical work, projects, and assignments. \nThus, in 2001, the school based assessment (SBA)  system has been brought into the O-level \ncurriculum, and now SBA marks are displayed on the O-level certificate. SBA is currently being \nbrought into the A-level syllabus. However, the public perceives that schools are not competent \nto  effectively  deliver  and  mark  SBA.  Therefore,  the  National  Examination  and  Testing  Service \nbelieve  that  it  is  too  early  to  integrate  SBA  marks  into  examination  results.  Instead,  other \nbenefits, such as considering the SBA grades when selecting students for technical colleges or \nfor a professional program, may be more effective. This would raise people\u2019s expectations and \nfaith  in  SBA  and  pave  the  way  for  SBA  marks  to  be  integrated  in  the  existing  examination \nsystem . \n\n\fFigure A2: Analysis of Problem: Lack of Universal Access to Effective Secondary Education. \n\nNational conditions \ncontributing to main \nproblem \n\nRural/Urban Inequality \n\nPoverty \n\nConflict-Affected \nAreas \n\nEffective Secondary \nEducation is Not \nUniversally Accessible \n\nEthnic Divisions\n\nRegional \nDisparity \n\nEFFECTIVE secondary education: \n1.

Procedures for school resource allocation and funding formula \nare described here.   \n \nA. \n \nThe needs analysis survey team from the central project management office (PMO) (the \n1. \nsurvey team) will prepare a  list of schools that includes student\u2019s enrolment data and the status \nof availability of facilities for each target school, based on the latest (2004) school census data. \nThe survey team will make a list of schools per zone and distribute it to each zonal education \noffice. The survey team will conduct a short training on participatory needs analysis for the zonal \nplanning  officers.  Then, the zonal  planning  officers  will  conduct a workshop for the schools in \ntheir  zones  on  conducting  a  self  needs  assessment.  Each  school  will  be  represented  by  the \nprincipal, one teacher, and one school development society member. At the end of the workshop, \neach school will have prepared a needs analysis report. The report must incorporate information \non expected support from various sources (North-East Community Restoration and Development \nProject, Small-Scale Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Upgrading Project, quality inputs, others).   \n \nBased  on  the  needs  analysis  reports  from  the  schools,  within  one  month  of  loan \n2. \neffectiveness, the zonal planning officers will update the zonal list from the  school census, and \nconsolidate  the  needs  analysis  reports  from  the  schools.  The  zonal  planning  officers  will \ncompare the needs for each school with the  baseline conditions for secondary schools agreed \nunder  the  Project.  The  zonal  planning  officers  will  propose  a  priority  list  for  school  resource \nallocation together with explanations for the priority list to the provincial PMO. Within two months \nof loan effectiveness, each provincial PMO will review and compare each zonal priority list, and \nprepare a priority list for school resource allocation in its respective province with explanations for \nthe priority list. It will post the priority list in a public place in the provincial PMO. Based on the \nprovincial priority lists, within 4 months of loan effectiveness, the survey team will prepare a draft \nresource allocation list for all target schools and submit it to the Steering Committee for approval. \nWithin six months of loan effectiveness, the draft resource allocation list will be approved by the \nSteering Committee or returned to the PMO for revision. If returned, the survey team will work \nwith the relevant Provincial PMO(s) and zones to submit a revised draft. Once the draft resource \nallocation list has been approved by the Project Steering Committee, the central PMO will inform \neach school of the approved resource allocation list through respective provincial PMO and zonal \neducation offices. The approved resource allocation list should be made available to the public \nby posting it in the PMO, provincial PMO, and  zonal education offices. The schools will use the \nresource allocation list as a basis to prepare the school development plan.   \n \nB. \n\nProvision  of  Computer  Learning  Centers  and  Advance  Level  (A  level)  Science \nLaboratory \n\n \n3. \nDuring the school needs analysis survey, approximately 350 schools will be identified to \nbe provided with a  computer learning center  (CLC) and  information  technology training. One \nschool in each of the 292  educational divisions and one more school in 61 divisions that do not \nhave  a 1AB school  will receive a CLC. Zonal  education offices will  first decide the number of \nSinhala-language and Tamil-language schools in proportion to the total number of  type 1AB/1C \nschools by language of instruction within the zone. \n \n4. \n\nAmong the type 1AB/1C schools, those with more than 100 students in  grades 10-13 \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n33\n\nare eligible for a CLC. Eligible schools must demonstrate, in their school development plan, that \nthey have the financial and management capacity to operate the facilities, including availability of \nteachers who will be in charge of CLC management; and access to electricity. If there are several \ncandidates, schools located in rural areas will be given priority. \n \n5. \nType 1AB schools without a proper A-level science laboratory and type 1C schools that \ncan be upgraded to type 1AB will be given either upgrading or new construction of an  A level \nscience  laboratory.  Prior  to  the  provision  of  facilities,  (i) the  central  Government  (for  national \nschools) or  provincial councils  (for  provincial  schools)  must  assure  the  provision  of  graduate \nscience  teachers;  and  (ii)  provincial  PMO s  and  zonal  education  offices  must  analyse  the \npotential demand for enrolment in the A-level science stream in those schools. Only schools with \na viable number of students for the A-level science stream will be given the facility.   \n \nC. \n \n6. \nBased  on  the  latest  school  census  data,  each  zonal  education  office  will  categorize \nschools into five groups according to the number of students in grades 10\u201313 and in total (Table \nA4). The list will be compiled at the provincial PMO, and approved by the central PMO. Then, the \ncentral PMO will transfer grants to the project account of each provincial PMO every year.   \n\nFunding Formula for School Development Grants \n\n \nTable A4: Funding Criteria for School Development Grants   \nand Computer Learning Center Start-up Operation Costs \n\nNo. of Students \n(Grades 10-13) \n\nNo. of \nStudents   \n(Total) \n\nCLC \n\nNo. of \nSchools (est.) \n\nTotal Grant \nAmount ($) \n\nSchools \n\nA.

The Project will install and support a project manager in each provincial \ndepartment  of  education.  Provincial  managers  will  provide  strategic  guidance  and  monitor  the \nlevels  (zonal,  divisional  and  school)  below  the  province.  The  provincial  project management \noffice  (PMO)  will  report  to  the  central  PMO.  The  central  PMO  will  be  mainly  concerned  with \nsupervising  the  capacity  building  of  the  provinces,  which,  in  turn,  will  supervise  the  capacity \nbuilding  of  the  zones.  The  latter  will  carry  out  training, mentoring, and supervision in schools, \nreporting back to the provinces to facilitate an effective project monitoring system. \n \nFigure A6 shows the management structure of the Project.  \n  \nFigure A6: The Management Structure of the Secondary Education Modernization Project \n \nII \n\nNational \nExamination \nand Testing \nService \n\nProject Management Office (PMO) \n(project  director,  5  specialists, \ndomestic \ninternational \nconsultants,  and  administrative \nstaff) \n\nand \n\nNational \nInstitute of \nEducation \n\nSteering Committee \nChair: Secretary, Ministry of \nEducation (MOE) \n\nAdditional Secretary \nMOE \n\nProvincial PMOs  \n(one provincial project manager  \nand secretary in each province) \n\nProvincial Offices \n\nZonal Offices \n\nSecondary School/Community \n\n \n\n \n\n\f      Appendix 7                   \n\n38 \n\nActivity \n\n \n\n  \n\nA.

An important dimension of civil conflicts is that they create divided \nsocieties.  Education  plays  an  important  role  in  postconflict  reconstruction,  especially  in  the \nareas of reconciliation and building social cohesion.1  \n \n2. \nWhile  education  has  an  important  function  in  reconstruction,  failures  in  the  education \nsystem  can  contribute  to  conflict  situations.  In  Sri  Lanka,  both  the  Sinhalese  majority  and  the \nTamil  minority  have  expressed  grievances,  past  and  present,  based  on  relative  deprivation  of \neducational provision and opportunity. These perceptions of inequality and exclusion have been \ncatalysts of conflict.  \n \nPrior  to  independence,  the  Sinhalese  majority  had  grown  resentful  that  the  Tamil \n3. \nminority  was  overrepresented  in  higher  education  and  influential  positions  in  professional \ncareers  and  civil  administration.  Nearly  a  decade  after  independence,  English  was  still  the \nnational  language  and  the  country  continued  to  be  ruled  by  an  English-speaking  elite. \nNationalist  sentiment  among  the  Sinhalese  majority  spurred  the  drive  to  elevate  the  status  of \nSinhala to the national language. In 1956, the Sinhala Only Law was enacted, sparking violent \nprotests  from  the  Tamil  minority.  The  Sinhalese-Tamil  conflict  had  its  roots  in  this  period  of \nemerging resentment and hostility.  \n \n4. \nThe Standardization Policy of 1971 augmented earlier tensions with its aim of reducing \nthe  number  of  Tamil  students  gaining  entrance  to  universities.  Successive  discriminatory \npolicies in education were paralleled by similar policies in other areas. The growing unrest of the \nearly 1970s turned to violent conflict by the mid 1970s as fighting for an independent Tamil state \nin  the  north-east  (Eelam)  began.  By  the  mid  1980a  the  conflict  had  spread  from  the  north  to \nmuch of the east, and continued for about 20 years. In 2000, a Norwegian team was invited to \ninitiate  negotiations  between  the  Liberation  Tigers  of  Tamil  Eelam  and  the  Government. \nEventually, a cease-fire was reached in late 2001 and peace talks began in 2002. Since then, \ngovernments have shown genuine commitment to the peace process. \n \nAlthough  discriminatory  policies  in  education  and  elsewhere  have  been  reversed,  and \n5. \nthe  13th  Amendment  to  the  Constitution  established  Tamil  as  an  official  language,  along  with \nSinhala, society remains deeply divided by language and ethnicity. To avoid reconstructing the \nsystem  of  exclusion  that  preceded  the  conflict,  these  issues  must  be  addressed  when \nconsidering education reform. \n \n6. \nIncorporating  these  themes  in  the  design  of  education  projects,  addresses  the \ninternational  community\u2019s  commitment,  expressed  in  para.  8  (v)  of  the  Dakar  Framework  for \nAction,  to  \u201cmeet  the  needs  of  education  systems  affected  by  conflict,  natural  calamities,  and \ninstability;  and  conduct  educational  programs  in  ways  that  promote  mutual  understanding, \npeace, and tolerance, and that help to prevent violence and conflict. \n \nA  holistic  approach  to  peace  building  and  postconflict  reconstruction  includes  four \n7. \nessential \nthemes:  security,  governance,  economic  recovery,  and  social  stability  and \ndevelopment.  The  last  theme,  social  stability  and  development,  is  the  central  focus  of \nreconstructing education (footnote 1). Three key aspects are involved: (i) rebuilding the physical \ninfrastructure of the education system, including buildings and supplies; (ii) regenerating human \ncapacity  of  teachers,  administrators,  and  school  communities;  and  (iii)  strengthening  social \n\n                                                 \n1 Colleta. 2003. Conflict and  Development , What Are We Reconstructing? Paris.  \n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 11 \n\nRebuilding the Physical Infrastructure \n\ncapital  by  addressing  curriculum  content.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  reconstruction, \nreconciliation, and social cohesion by focusing on these aspects in its inputs. \n \nA. \n \nAt  the  time  of  the  conflict,  education  was  disrupted  by  the  closure  of  schools.  Nearly \n8. \n25% of schools in the north and east were closed, while 25.5% functioned in displaced locations \nwith makeshift arrangements.2 Furthermore, 15,000 classrooms in 500 schools are reported to \nbe  fully  or  partially  damaged.  Libraries,  laboratories,  offices,  electricity,  water,  and  sanitation \nfacilities were also damaged.  \n \n9. \nThe  condition  of  these  schools  and  those  in  other  impoverished  areas is a source of \ndivision  and  exacerbates  grievances  among  the  affected  communities.  The  Project  aims  to \naddress this issue by improving access to quality education facilities for students from rural and \nunderprivileged  areas  by  upgrading  the  infrastructure  and  facilities  of  its  target  schools  to  a \ndefined baseline standard. The Project places emphasis on supporting those secondary schools \nthat have not received assistance from earlier projects.   \n \n10. \nDuring field visits to schools in the north-east, principals invariably articulated concerns \nabout  inadequate  facilities,  including  classrooms,  toilets,  and  electricity.  Equity  of  access  in \ncomponent  1  is  concerned  with  ensuring  that  there  quality  education  facilities  are  distributed \nequitably  in  the  country.  The  baseline  was  designed  to  ensure  that  disadvantaged  secondary \nschools receive essential  resources for offering the required O-level subjects in the curriculum.  \n \nB. \n \n11. \nA  crucial  shortage  of  teachers  exists  in  the  north-east;  this  was  emphasized  by  all \nschools  visited.  Compounding  this  situation  is  an  influx  of  children  due  mainly  to  returning \ninternally displaced people. The number of school-aged students in the north-east is expected \nto increase by one third to approximately 866,000 by 2007.3 This will increase the demand for \nqualified  teachers  substantially.  The  shortage  of  teachers  in  disadvantaged  areas  is  a \nconsiderable  barrier  to  equitable  provision  of  secondary  education  to  disadvantaged  minority \ngroups.  In  this  regard,  the  Project  will  seek  assurance  that  the  Government  is  committed  to \nimplementing an equitable and effective transfer policy.  \n \n12. \nThe Project will ensure that target schools receive equitable benefits in terms of support \nfrom zonal trainers, provincial project managers, and capable teachers in the required medium \nof instruction. These strategies are particularly concerned with providing adequate education in \nareas  deemed  critical  for  more  lucrative  employment\u2014a  major  issue  for  disadvantaged \nsecondary  school-aged  youth.  This  is  a  key  issue  for  future  conflict  avoidance,  particularly \nbecause both the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in the north and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna \n(People\u2019s Liberation Army) in the south drew support primarily from disaffected youth. \n \nC. \n \nThis aspect of reconstruction is concerned with reasserting the socialization and value-\n13. \nforming functions of schooling. This entails developing curriculum content and teaching methods \ncommensurate with the goal of shared values, social cohesion, and inclusive institutions.

The \nProject  will  also  require  the  zonal  training  specialists  to  provide  school-based  training  in \nteaching approaches that foster greater understanding between language/ethnic groups. It will \nalso  promote  training  on  student-focused  teaching  approaches  and  school-based assessment \nthat brings a more practical orientation into teaching-learning activities. \n \n14. \nOther  agencies  have  done  extensive  work  in  the  area  of  peace  building.  The  United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund has produced resources for teachers through its Education for Conflict \nResolution  program.  The  Government  of  Germany  has  also  incorporated  concepts  of  peace \nbuilding and social cohesion into its teacher education program. The Project will coordinate with \nother agencies to reinforce their efforts and avoid duplication in production of materials.  \n \nDuring the field visits, some schools reported activities with \u201dfamily schools\u201d as part of a \n15. \nprogram initiated by the provincial government to promote interschool activities among Sinhala \nand  Tamil  schools  with  a  view  to  fostering  understanding  and  tolerance.  While  this  initiative \nmakes  an  important  contribution  to  peace-building,  several  schools  were  not  aware  of  these \ninitiatives, although they were participating in some interschool sporting events.  \n \n16. \nThe  Project  will  also  strike  a  balance  between  two  important  aspects  of  strengthening \nsocial  capital  in  postconflict  situations.  The  Project  makes  a  point  of  providing  its  curriculum \nmaterials  to  separate  language  groups  to  achieve  equity.  Although  this  may  be  viewed  as \nreinforcing  division  along  language  and  ethnic  lines,  it  is  unavoidable  from  an  equity \nperspective, at least at the outset until broader language acquisition is attained. Until that time, \nthe  Project  addresses  the  potential  negative  effects  by  promoting  English  as  a  link  language, \nwithin a more inclusive curriculum. \n \nD. \n \nThe  roots  of  conflict  are  bound  up  with  inequality  and  the  perception  of  relative \n17. \ndeprivation  among  individuals  and  groups.  The  most  obvious  risk  for  the  Project  is  that  of \nexacerbating  disparities  between  schools  with  selective \ninformation  and \ncommunication  technology  (ICT)  equipment.  While  the  first  priority  of  the  Project  is  to  bring \ndisadvantaged  schools  up  to  the  baseline,  the  Project  is  also  sensitive  to  the  Government\u2019s \ndesire to modernize the secondary education system with the injection of ICT. However, not all \nschools have the capacity to absorb ICT inputs.  \n \n18. \nTo satisfy both aspects of the Government\u2019s vision of modernizing secondary education \nwithout  exacerbating  disparities,  the  Project  will  ensure  that  all  ethnic  groups  gain  access  to \nquality  secondary  education  inputs.  The  Project  will  maintain  an  ethnic  balance  by  expanding \nthe  Project  to  schools  in  the  north-east  and  in  plantation  areas  where  Tamils  and  Muslims \npredominate. While the provision of ICT on a selective basis may create disparity, the Project is \ntaking measures to avoid the perception of deprivation by balancing its selection process. \n \n19. \nThe  Project  carefully  considers  the  important  role  of  education  in  peace  building, \nreconciliation,  and  social  cohesion.  Its  emphasis  on  equitable  access  to  quality  secondary \neducation  in  disadvantaged  areas  should  have  a  positive  impact  on  reversing  perceptions  of \nrelative deprivation and exclusion. \n \n20.   Efforts  to  resolve  the  conflict  may  fail.  If  the  conflict  returns  to  the  north  east,  school \nrenovation in the area will be difficult. Nevertheless, the other peace-enhancing activities of the \nProject will continue.   \n\ninputs  of \n\nRisks \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n \n                                                                                                                                                                       \n\n \n\n50\n\n \n\n \n\nSUMMARY ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n\nProject Objectives and Economic Rationale \n\nA. \n \nWhile Sri Lanka has achieved high enrolments in primary (95%) and lower secondary \n1. \neducation (85%) and a high literacy rate (92%), the  Government has been concerned with the \nquality  of  secondary  education.  The  Proposals  for  a  National  Policy  Framework  on  General \nEducation in Sri Lanka prepared by the National Education Commission in 2003 pointed out that \na dearth of science, mathematics, and information and communication technology (ICT)-qualified \npersonnel in the job market is keeping the economy from expanding into new and demanding \nareas.  To  improve  the  quality  of  secondary  education  and  meet  the  job  market  demands, \nlaboratory,  basic  information  and  communication  technology  facilities,  teaching-learning \nresources, teachers\u2019 teaching skills, and principals\u2019 managerial capacities need to be improved. \n \n2. \nThe Project will help the Government implement this policy by providing target schools \n(approximately 1,100 1AB and 1C schools) with computers, information technology facilities, A- \nand  O-level  science  laboratories,  multimedia/library  rooms,  and  activity  rooms  along  with \nnecessary  furniture  and  equipment.  Not  all  of  these  facilities  will  be  equally  distributed  to  the \nentire  target  schools,  but  the  Project  will  begin  by  carefully  examining  the  viability  and \nneeds/requirements  of  each  school  during  the  initial  needs  analysis  study.  For  instance,  the \nProject will provide a new A-level science laboratory only for viable 1C schools to be upgraded to \n1AB, for which the Government assures a supply of appropriate teachers.1 Target schools in the \nProject  that  will  not  be  provided  with  full  facilities  and  equipment  will  be  given  school \ndevelopment  grants,  which  they  can  utilize  according  to  their  needs  and  priorities.  All  target \nschools  will  also  benefit  from  receiving  school-based  management/school-based  assessment \ntraining,  career  counseling  resources,  an  O-level  science  laboratory  equipment  kit,  various \nteaching-learning resources, and supports from zonal training specialists thereby ensuring that \nthe quality of the secondary education is improved in all target schools.   \n \n3. \nThe O-level pass rate has significantly improved in the last 10 years from 19.5% in 1995 \nto 37.0% in 2000, and 41.0% in 2002. Beginning in 2002 a credit for  school-based assessment \nbecame a part of the A-level qualification, which enabled about 5,000 more students to qualify for \nA-level  and  increased  the  overall  pass  rate  by  1.6%  in  2002.  Based  on  this  trend,  one  of  the \nproject goals\u2014to increase the O-level pass rate to 60% by 2009\u2014is an achievable target with \nthe new investment by the Project. In addition to the improvement of the overall O-level pass rate, \nthe Project aims to improve the percentage of students participating in the A-level science stream \nfrom 22% to 35%. An increase in students studying in the A-level science stream will help meet \nthe needs of the job market, which demands a workforce with scientific/technical expertise. \n\n \n\n4. \nThe economic benefits of the investment in secondary education can be measured by \npotential  increases  in  wages  due  to  higher  educational  achievement  of  the  graduates.  When \nemployees over 15 years are grouped by level of education and wages,2 the wage differential \nbetween those who passed O-level and those who did not is estimated at  SLRs21,612 ($216)3 \nper year for 2001, and between those who passed A-level and those who did not at  SLRs9,852 \n($99) per year. Because one wage figure for the entire group of grades 1\u201310 is so broad, the first \n\n                                                 \n1  According to the National Education Commission proposals, only about 450 out of 600 1AB schools have viable \n\nA-level science classes, mainly due to low number of students or teachers (p. 159).   \n\n2  Labour Market Information Bulletin, Vol. 21/2002. Table 1.15, p. 13. \n3  Estimated as a weighted average with an assumption that an average wage for each wage category is SLRs2,000, \nSLRs 3,000,  SLRs5,000,  SLRs 7,000,  and  SLRs10,000,  respectively.  Monthly  figures  are  multiplied  by  12.  At \nexchange rate of SLRs 100 = $1. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n \n\n51\n\ncomparison probably overestimates the impact of passing the O-level. Furthermore, figures for \nthe  wage  differential  are  highly  sensitive  to  the  assumption  for  the  average  wage  level  for  the \nhighest income group. Thus, the wage differentials may be bigger or smaller than the estimates. \n \n5. \nAnother wage statistic is available from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey \n2002. Annual wage differentials between grades 6\u20139 and O-level achievers and between O-level \nand  A-level  achievers  are  SLRs46,608  ($466)  and  SLRs43,740  ($437),  respectively.  These \nfigures are much higher than those estimated  in para. 4. Whichever figures are used however, \nthe higher the education level, the higher is the wage level. \n \n6. \nBased on this data, annual wage gains per student by passing O-level and A-level range \nfrom  $150\u2013470  and  $100\u2013440,  respectively.  These  wide  ranges  make  a  calculation  of  the \ninternal rate of return (IRR) on the investment difficult, as the rate is highly sensitive to the wage \nfigures.  To  estimate  the  minimum  impact  of  the  Project,  the  lowest  wage  gains,  i.e.,  $150  for \nO-level achievers and $100 for A-level achievers, are used as the base of the calculation (para. \n7).  The  impact  of  the  Project  on  the  improvement  of  O-  and  A-level  pass  rates  is  another \nsensitive variable for calculation of the rate of return. Three cases\u2014(i) high improvement (60%), \n(ii)  moderate  improvement  (55%),  and  (iii)  low  improvement  (50%)  in  the  O-level  and  A-level \npass rates \u2014are analyzed.   \n \n7. \nTo calculate the IRR, the Project\u2019s impact is assumed to appear in the second year of \nthe  project  implementation.  Second,  because  the  Project  directly  covers  only  about  1,100 of \n2,300  1AB  and  1C  schools  and  no  type 2 schools, which  enroll  O-level students, 30% of the \nimprovement in the O-level rates is assumed to be due to the Project. As for the A-level pass \nrates, for which only type 1AB and 1C schools are relevant, 40% of the improvement is assumed \nto be due to the Project. Other assumptions include a 1 year time lag between the completion of \nO-  or  A-level  and  employment,  10%  unemployment  among  the  O-  and  A-level  achievers, \nconstant  real  wage  differentiations  throughout  their  employment  periods  (43  years  (17\u201360) for \nO-level achievers and 41 years (19\u201360) for A-level achievers), and 7 years of continuous impact \nof the Project\u2019s investment after the implementation period.  To sustain the Project\u2019s impact, the \nfollowing incremental recurrent costs are expected to be borne annually by the Government and \nbeneficiaries during the implementation and for 7 years after the Project: 200 teacher incentives \n($240 per  teacher),  100  graduates  with  National  Diploma  in  Information and Communication \nTechnology  ($800 per  graduate), 450  zonal  facilitator  allowances  ($480 per  facilitator), 12,000 \nstipends  for  O-  and  A-level students  in  rural  areas  ($50/student  per  year),  and  operation and \nmaintenance for  school  facilities  for  1,000  schools  ($300 per  school) by the  Government,  and \noperation costs for 350 computer learning center (CLCs) ($720 per CLC) by the beneficiaries.   \n \n8. \nUnder these assumptions, the Project is estimated to  yield an IRR of 13%, even when \nimprovement in the O- and A-level pass rates  is low. The IRR goes up to 19% when pass rates \nimprove moderately, and 22% improvement is high. An increase in the wage differentials will also \nsignificantly improve the IRR. For instance, an  increase in wages by passing O-level from $150 \nto $200 will improve the IRR from 13 to 19% even in the low improvement case. \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe  educational  facilities  and  equipment  provided  by  the  Project  are  expected  to  be \nused  not  only  by  secondary  students  in  the  selected  target  schools,  but  also  by  more  junior \nstudents  in  the  same  schools,  students  in  neighboring  schools,  and  school  leavers  and \ncommunity members. Although the Project is not able to provide an equal amount of facilities to \nall of the target schools, in the interest of equity, the Project will ensure that each division has at \nleast one 1AB school, where possible, or at least one well-equipped 1C school. Thus, 61 of  the \n\nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n                                                                                                                                                                       \n\n \n\n \n\n \n292 divisions in the country that currently do not have even a single 1AB school will be given \npriority.  The  Project  will  also  provide  scholarships  for  students  who  live  in  areas  with  no \nfully-equipped 1AB or 1C school nearby. A-level qualified students from type 2 schools are also \neligible for the scholarships. \n \n10. \nThe direct beneficiaries of the Project are secondary school students, primarily those in \nrural and disadvantaged areas. In addition, other stakeholders will benefit from the Project such \nas  community  members,  teachers, principals,  in-service  advisors,  and  zonal/provincial/central \nofficers through various training and professional development programs. The Project will utilize \nas many existing teacher and government cadres as possible to make the project benefits more \nsustainable. At the same time, the Project will enlist some special school support programs and \nincentives  to  support  the  initial  activities  during  the  first  stage  of  the  Project.  In  addition, the \nProject will provide an incentive program for teachers to mitigate the severe teacher shortages in \nrural areas, to ensure that the expected benefits reach disadvantaged schools. These secondary \nbeneficiaries are expected to help improve the existing school system for the secondary school \nstudents, in more efficient and effective ways. \n \nC. \n \n\nEducation Budget and Financial Sustainability \n\nTable A12: General Education Expenditure \n(SLRs million)   \n2002 \nActual \n\n2001 \nActual \n\n2000 \nActual \n\n1999 \nActual \n\n2003 \nEst. \n\n2004 \nEst. \n\n2005 \nProj.c \n\n1998 \nActual \n\n \n\n   \n \n  25,611 28,618  32,699  34,705  38,259  36,994  39,376  41,599 \n416 \n \n\n390 \n\n394 \n\n366 \n\n363 \n\n378 \n\n364 \n\n370 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  20,186  23,536  28,247  29,851  31,591  31,449  34,726  36,753 \n\n2006 \nProj.c \n\n2007 \nProj. \n\n2008 \nProj. \n\n2009 \nProj. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  5,424  5,082  4,452  4,853  6,667  5,545  4,650  4,846 \nDomestic Funds c  4,684  5,424  2,819  1,934  2,301  3,106  2,679  3,308  3,729 \n77.0 \n\n39.2 \n\n47.2 \n\n71.1 \n\n36.7 \n\n29.8 \n\n36.0 \n\n100 \n\n0  2,263  2,519  2,552  3,561  2,866  1,342  1,117 \n\n0 \n\n52.8 \n\n70.2 \n\n63.3 \n\n60.8 \n\n64.0 \n\n28.9 \n\n23.0 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\nTotal Expenditurec \n(SLRs million) \n($ million)a \n\nRecurrent \nCapitalc \n\n            Percentage \n\n86.5 \nForeign Funds b c         614 \n      Percentage \n13.5 \nof which SEMP II \n(est.)   \n\n \n\n    Government                         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n239  1,206  1,298 1,290 665 \n\n8 \n\n282 \n\n300 \n\n316 \n\n121 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n227 \n4 \n\n    ADB                                       \n    Beneficiaries               \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, SEMP II = Secondary Education Modernization Project II, SLR = Sri Lanka rupee \na Annual average exchange rates from the Central Bank Annual Report 2002 are used for 1998\u20132002.

The figures for \nforeign  financing  include  only  the  foreign  exchange  financing  portions  of  the  foreign-funded projects excluding \ndomestic counterpart funds. In 1999, the Government spent SLRs935.4 million from domestic funds for the two \nWorld-Bank funded projects, even though no foreign exchange funds were disbursed.   \nc As of August 2004, the Government projects the education budget only up to 2006, which does not take into account \nthis Project.

Per capita \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n \n\n53\n\nGDP was SLRs83,382 ($871) in 2002. Government education expenditure was 2.7% of GDP \nand 9.4% of the total government expenditure between 1988 and 2001. From 1999\u20132004, 80.0\u2013 \n83.4%  of  the  total  education budget  was  allocated  to  general  education.  The  low  education \nexpenditures  in  recent  years  run  counter  to  the  policy  stipulated  in  the  General  Education \nReforms prepared by the Presidential Task Force in 1997, and the policy recommendation made \nby  the  National  Education  Commission  in  2003\u2014that  the  Government  increase  education \nexpenditures to above 5% of GDP. However, with severe budget constraints, the  Government \nmay not be able to drastically increase the education budget to 5% of GDP in the near future. \n \nTable A12 summarizes the general education expenditure in Sri Lanka, and shows the \n12. \nmagnitude  of  foreign-funded  projects  and  foreign  grants  and  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  the \ngovernment budget. The  Government has shifted its funding sources from domestic to foreign \nfunds  in  recent  years,  mainly  to  implement  the  1997  General  Education  Reforms.  After  the \ngradual implementation of the Project in the first year (2005), the impacts of the Project on the \nGovernment education budget will be equivalent to about 25% of the total capital budget in the \nsecond year, leaving plenty of room for other foreign  development agencies to contribute. The \nproject inputs will remain roughly constant from the year 2 to year 4. Thus the budgetary impact \nof the Project on the total education capital budget is readily within the recent trend. \n \n13. \nThe Project is designed to minimize capital investment in new buildings and facilities. \nInstead  it  will  upgrade  or  rehabilitate  existing  classrooms,  laboratories,  and  multimedia/library \nrooms; and convert available rooms into other functional rooms. Parents and communities are \nexpected to contribute in-kind  labor for construction and upgrading of facilities. During project \nimplementation  and  for  7  years  after  the  Project,  the  Government  is  expected  to  provide \nincremental  recurrent  costs  for  certain  activities  that  the  Project  has  initiated  and  facilities \nprovided as discussed in the calculation of IRR. The total annual costs are estimated at $1.244 \nmillion a year, which is equivalent to approximately 0.3 % of the annual total general education \nbudget, or 2.2 to 3.5 % of the annual capital budget in recent years, and is a sustainable level.   \n \nThe Project is designed to encourage parents, graduates, and community members to \n14. \ncontribute to the operational cost of the CLCs, activity rooms, and science laboratories supplied \nby the Project. Schools are expected to open the CLCs to communities and school leavers, and \nto collect user fees as a part of cost recovery. Their participation in financing school facilities is \nexpected to enhance ownership of the  project benefits and to ensure the sustainable utilization \nof  the  facilities  even  after  project  implementation.  Reports  from  the  on-going  Secondary \nEducation Modernization Project indicate that some of the CLCs provided by have collected user \nfees, while many others have not mainly due to the existing regulatory constrains. Very recently \nthe Ministry of Education approved a circular to institute necessary regulations, and the schools \nare expected to gradually start collecting user fees. However, schools may require some time to \nestablish  a  sustainable  cost-recovery  system.  The  Project  will  provide  CLC  recipient  schools \nwith initial operating costs to run  the CLCs during the first  2 years. To promote  and encourage \nschools to adopt cost-recovery/sustainability measures, the Project will provide special training \nto  the  target  schools  on  how  to  develop  partnerships  with  the  private  sector  and  other \nprospective supporters in the community. \n \nIn summary, the Project is expected to yield an adequate return on the investment, and \n15. \nis designed to provide lasting benefits. It has many unquantifiable but important educational and \nsocial benefits. The Project promises to ensure equity of access to and quality of the secondary \neducation by prioritizing the distribution of physical and human resources to rural schools and \nstudents in disadvantaged areas. The impacts of the  project costs on the  Government budget \nduring and after the implementation are feasible and easily within recent trends.   \n\n \n\n\f 54          Appendix 13 \n\n \n\n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDU CTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n    No \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n  Yes  \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\nA. \nIs the sector identified as a national priority \nin country poverty analysis?   \n \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka: \n \nThe  overall  goals  of  the  Sri  Lankan  Government  are  to  modernize  the  economy  and  enrich  the  labor \nmarket  through  a  flexible  education  system,  with  particular  emphasis  on  minimizing  differences  across \nregions,  and  reducing  the  disadvantages  experienced  in  poor  rural  areas,  and  the  conflicted  affected \nareas.  The  2000  report  of  the  Government  (A  Framework  for  Poverty  Reduction)  proposes  that  the \ndevelopment  of  secondary  education  is  necessary  to  ensure  a  trainable  and  mobile  labor  force  that  will \nprovide the poor with access to greater earnings. The education strategy of the Asian Development  Bank \n(ADB)  in  Sri  Lanka  falls  within  its  overall  strategies  of  poverty  reduction,  human  development,  and \neconomic growth with special efforts to ensure equality of opportunity across gender. ADB support for the \nsecondary education sector in Sri Lanka emphasizes access, quality, and capacity. The overall targets are \npoverty reduction, through an emphasis on pro-poor investments to strengthen public-private partnerships. \nIn this respect, ADB supports reform efforts to (i) improve access and education quality, particularly in rural \nand  conflict-affected  areas;  and  (ii)  promote  social  cohesion  by  providing  educational  opportunities.  The \nADB policy has six subsidiary priorities: (i) reach the poor, (ii) improve quality, (iii) increase efficiency, (iv) \nmobilize resources, (v) collaborate with beneficiaries, and (v) support innovation. \n \nIn Sri Lanka students from government schools (94% of the schools) receive free education. The country\u2019s \nadult literacy rate at 92%, is one of the highest in Asia. The country has ab out 10,000 government schools \nand  4,000,000  students.  Females  make  up  around  50%  of  the  total  student  population.  The  positive \nimpacts  of  basic  education  on  the  poor  are  low  fertility;  low  population  growth;  and  low  infant,  child,  and \nmaternal  mortality.  Although  significant  achievement  has  been  accomplished  in  increasing  the  literacy \nrate,  further  development  is  needed  particularly  in  science  and  technology  in  secondary  education.  Of  5\u2013\n14 year olds, 89.5% are in school; this drops to 54.5% for 15\u201319  year  olds.  Only  41%  of  students  qualify \nfor  higher  studies  (2001).  Among  those  who  sit  the  A-level examination, around 52% receive a pass but \nless than 3 % of this number enters university. Each year, 140,000 people enter the job market, however \n70% remained unemployed. The unemployed are between 14 and 25 years of age. Youth unemployment \nin  youth  has  increased  due  to  lack  of  competencies.  This  indicates  that  schools  are  not  preparing  its \nstudents for employment. The unemployment rate among those with A level (gr ades  12\u201313) and above is \n18%, as the conventional education system with its traditional courses does not meet the emerging needs \nof the labor market, especially in information technology, marketing, and English language skills.  \n \nThe  biggest  problem  facing  the  secondary  education  system  is  the  lack  of  universal  access  to  effective \nsecondary  education.  In  some  respects,  the  disparities  between  some  schools  and  others  have  been \nexacerbated  by  the  developments  made  by  Secondary  Education  Modernization  Project  and  General \nEducation  Project  2  (World  Bank  financed).  The  computer  learning  centers  (CLCs)  and  information \ntechnology  (ITC)  established  by  SEMP  I  and  GEP  2  have  left  out  secondary  schools  that  have  no \ncomputer  learning  center,  and  have  received  no  benefits  from  outside.  Lack  of  universal  access  to \nsecondary  education  effects  many  schools  all  over  the  country;  however,  13  of  the  24  administrative \ndistricts are severely disadvantaged. Some of the schools are in disadvantaged situation because they are \naffected by (i) 20-years  of  ethnic  conflict;  (ii)  income  level  of  the  parents,  (iii)  ethnic  division;  (iii)  shortage \nof  teachers;  (iv)  rural  urban  disparity;  and  (v)  regional  disparity.  Disparities  among  the  schools  can  be \nfound in infrastructure, basic services, libraries, teaching and learning materials, level of teacher training, \nlack  of  qualified  teachers  in  Mathematics,  Science,  ICT,  level  of  school  managerial  autonomy,  ability  to \nraise funds for school development. The lack of access to science and technology results in children from \ninformation \ndisadvantaged  districts  being  excluded \ntechnology, etc, which are the areas with the best employment and income prospects.  \n \nUnequal  distribution  of  education  facilities  in  the  country  especially  in  the  conflict-affected  areas  (north \neast  region)  and  inherent  poverty  of  the  large  number  of  rural  families  are  major  concerns  in  resolving \ndisparities  in  education  among  the  regions.  The  Project  will  focus  on  upgrading  approximatel y  1100 \nsecondary schools (1AB and 1C schools, 10-13 grades) and provide system wide support to all secondary \nschools. The Project gives emphasis on minimizing the disparities among schools especially for the north \neast region and the plantation areas. \n\nfrom  medicine,  engineering \n\ntechnology  and \n\n\f        Appendix 13   \n\n55\nProject  budget  will  be  allocated  to  bring  the  approximately  1,100  selected  1AB  and  1C  schools  to  an \nacceptable  quality  standard,  so  that  the  significant  disparities  among  schools  by  region  and  rural  and \nurban  areas  will  be  minimized.  Stipends  program  for  the  poor  students  should  be  selected  from  the \ndisadvantaged  schools.  Improvement  in  secondary  school  system  would  provide  effective  secondary \neducation opportunities for the students to learn science and technology. The Project will engage in policy \ndialogue  with  the  Government  to  recruit  science  graduates  as  new  teachers  from  the  local  areas.  The \nimproved  quality  of  secondary  education  in  science  and  technology  subsequently  would  increase \nemployability of the students especially for the poor students. \n \nPoverty Analysis                                                Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention 1  \nB. \nADB\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  in  Sri  Lanka  (2001)  states  that  lack  of  access  to  high  quality  education  has \nresulted in low human resource development am ong the poor. The household Survey of the Department of \nCensus and Statistics (2002), noted that 23.9% of households are poor, a decline from 26.7% in 1995/96. \nTwo  types  of  poverty  were  analyzed  in  the  2002  household  expenditure  survey:  relative  and  absolu te \npoverty.  Approximately  25%  of  the  population  are  estimated  to  experience  absolute  poverty.  The \ngeographic  distribution  of  incidence  of  rural  poverty  varies  from  one  province  to  another.  Comparatively, \nWestern Province happens to be most urbanized and developed, and the percentage of poor households \nvaries  from  12.2%  to  36.4%.  Poverty  is  less  rampant  in  urban  areas.  The  number  of  poor  households  in \nurban areas is 7.9% and in the rural sector 26.4%. In Uva and North Central provinces the number of poor \nhouseholds increased from 1995/96 to 2002.The civil conflict in the north and east has adversely affected \nthe  population  in  the  areas,  and  poverty  has  increased  significantly.  Nearly  1.2  million  people  have  been \ndisplaced  by  the  ethnic  conflict  and  one  third  of  houses  destroyed.  The  conflict  has  disrupted  children\u2019s \neducation.  Displacement,  closure  of  schools,  damage  to  school  buildings,  classrooms,  libraries,  water, \nsanitation facilities (15,000 class rooms in 500 schools), insecurity, and poverty have led to absenteeism, \nno enrollment, dropouts, and poor quality of education.  \n \nQuality  of  education  is  absent  in  most  rural  areas.  Schools  do  not  possess  the  basic  requirements  such \nas, water, sanitation facilities, classrooms, desks, chairs, blackboards, and teaching materials. Schools in \nremote  and  difficult  areas  suffer  from  shortage  of  teachers,  while  teachers  are  in  excess  in  urban  areas. \nNearly  27%  teachers  are  untrained  and  this  group  generally  constitutes  the  teachers  in  rural  areas.  The \nschools in small towns and rural areas are unable to provide education in science, technical subjects, and \nEnglish.  The  number  of  A-level students in science courses in the districts of Kiliinochchi, Mannar, Nuwara \nEliya,  Polonnaruwa,  and  Trincomalee  is  very  low.  School  buildings  in  these  areas  are  in  poor  condition. \nThe  poor  condition  of  schools  has  implications  for  performance  of  students.  The  pass  rates  of  rural \nschools  are  very  low.  In  the  District  of  Colombo  more  than  50%  of  students  pass  the  O  level,  while  in \nAnuradhapura,  Hambantota,  Matale,  ,Monaragala,  and  Plonnaruwa,  districts,  less  than  35%  pass  the  O \nlevel.  Of  the  total  schools  in  urban  areas,  24.9%  are  1AB  schools,  while  in  the  rural  sector  1AB  schools \naccount  for  only  4%.  Almost  25%  of  1AB  schools  are  in  Western  Province.  National  1AB  schools,  which \nare better equipped and managed by the Ministry of Education, are located in urban or semi-urban areas. \nAlthough education is free and uniforms are provided by the Government, poor parents are unable to meet \ntransport  cost  and  cost  of  textbooks.  Private  tuition  fees  especially  for  science  subjects  are  beyond  the \nreach  of  poor  parents.  Poor  students  have  limited  access  to  science  education,  and  this  results  in \nimbalance in the quality of education of the poor and the non-poor. \n \nThe schools in the semi-urban, rural, and conflict areas should receive priority in the resource allocation to \nimprove  access  to  quality  education  under  the  Project.  Providing  basic  facilities,  additional  classrooms, \nlibraries,  science  and  educational  equipment,  to  the  disadvantaged  school  should  be  the  major  focus  of \nthe  Project.  Recruitment  of  teachers  for  science  and  English  for  the  north-east region and disadvantaged \ndistricts should be included in the policy dialogue of the Project. Given the  poor condition of the schools in \nthe  Project  should  coordinate  with  North-East  Community  Restoration  and \nthe  conflicted  area, \nDevelopment  Project,  in  north-east  region  to  complement  its  school  rehabilitation  activities.  The  Project \nshould also coordinate with the Small-Scale Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Upgrading Project and other \naid-assisted projects to maximize the improvement of secondary schools in disadvantaged areas.  \n \nParticipation Process  \nC. \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nDuring the project preparatory technical assistance, limited stakeholders\u2019 consultation was done at the \nprovincial level. During the implementation of the Project, participatory needs assessment of the schools in \nconsultation with the provincial governments, school development societies and local communities should \nbe done to allocate appropriate resources to the disadvantaged schools . \n1    Following  the  Board  Approval  of  the  R- Paper,  Review  of  ADB\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy,  staff  instructions  to \nreplace the PI/CPI classification with a new tracking system are under preparation in line with paragraph 83 of the \nR- Paper. \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes  \n\n\f 56          Appendix 13 \n\n \n\n \n\n   No \n\n   No \n\n   Yes               \n\n   Yes               \n\nIs there a participation strategy?  \n \nThe  Project  would  help  the  school  development  societies  take  an  active  role  in  developing  and \nimplementing school development plans. The Government has introduced school management councils \n(SMC) on a pilot basis. In the future, SMC will replace the school development societies, and are expected \nto facilitate the participation of parents and the community in developing the school development plan.   \n \nD.            Gender Development \n Strategy to Maximize impacts on Women \n \nIs there a participation strategy?  \n \nThe  state  policies  in  Sri  Lanka  ensure  gender  equality  and  guarantee  women\u2019s  human  and  fundamental \nrights.  The  gender  development  index,  which  covers  life  expectancy,  literacy,  and  education,  shows  that \nSri  Lanka\u2019s  achievement  was  73%.  However,  the  gender  empowerment  index  that  includes  women\u2019s \nposition in decision-making was 27% in 2001. Women\u2019s labor force participation was 37%. The enrollment \nof  girls  in  O  and  A  levels  is  52%  and  57.5  %  respectively,  and  is  relatively  high  compared  with  boys. \nHowever,  the  majority  of  the  girls  are  enrolled  in  arts  (66%)  and  less  in  science  and  commerce.  The \nnumber  of  girls  admitted  to  universities  is  low  as  girls  fail  to  obtain  admission  to  different  faculties.  The \ngender  gap  is  also  evident  from  female  enrollment  figures  in  computer-related courses (2003). Poverty, \nlack of mobility, stereotyped selection of subjects; and lack of access to science and technology education \nhas  deprived  girls  of  the  benefits  of  the  secondary education system. District disparities in the availability \nof  educational  facilities  such  as  qualified  teachers  in  science  and  languages  affect  the  children  in  remote \nareas  more  than  those  in  the  urban  areas.  Children  from  rural  and  remote  areas  ar e  deprived  of  the \npossibility  of  higher  attainment  in  language  skills,  and  technical  subjects  compared  with  urban  children. \nPoverty and parents\u2019 concern for their girls\u2019 security prevent girls from remote areas attending schools with \nscience  courses  (1AB  schools)  in  the  urban  areas.  The  socialization  process  reinforces  stereotyping  of \ngirls\u2019 role and influences them to enroll subjects in arts. This limits women\u2019s options for better employment. \nFemale school dropouts tend to engage in low skilled jobs in the industrial zones, and or migrate to Middle \nEastern  or  Far  Eastern  countries  as  housemaids.  The  percent  of  female  teachers  is  higher  than  male\u2014\n60.3% of all teachers. However, women hold only 31.8% of managerial positions. The Project will include \nthe following strategies to address gender issues: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii)  \n(iii) \n(iv)  \n\n(v)  \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix)  \n\nThe selection of schools for improvement and upgrading into 1 AB schools or better quality 1 \nC  schools  will  give  priority  to  the  schools  from  semi-urban,  rural  areas,  and  conflict-affected \nareas.  That  will  help  increase  access  to  quality  secondary  education  of  girls  from  poor \nhouseholds. \nThe student\u2019s stipend program will include 50% girl students. \nThe selection of teachers for training will include 50% female teachers. \nThe improvement of basic facilities in schools will include building separate toilets for girls and \nfemale teachers. \nThe  managerial  training  program  for  existing  principals  will  include  50%  female  principals, \nincluding  female  principals  from  the  conflict -affected  areas;  The  Project  will  increase  the \nnumber  of  female  teachers  for  managerial  cadres  from  31.8%  to  40%  by  the  end  of  the \nProject. \nThe teacher\u2019s training program on management and planning will include at least 50% female \nteachers. \nThe  human  development  program  for  the  provincial  education  office,  zonal  offices,  training  of \ntrainer program, and Ministry of Education will include at least 30% of female officials.  \nThe project management unit will include at least 40% of female staff. Female staff should be \nincluded  in  managerial  positions   in  the  unit;  Female  managers  and  experts  should  make  up \n40% of the provincial project management units. The project management information system \nand  monitoring  system  will  include  a  gender  disaggregated  database  system  for  girl\u2019s \nenrollment  in  1AB  and  1C  schools,  training  of  teachers  and  principals,  and  stipend  program, \nscholarship for teachers by rural, urban, region, and conflicted areas. \nThe Project will include a social development and gender specialist (domestic consultant) for 5 \nperson-months  to  develop  a  gender  action  plan  with  special  focus  on  the  conflict-affected \nareas.  The  project  management  office  staff  will  have  expertise  in  social  development  and \ngender.  The  domestic  consultant  will  coordinate  with  the  project  management  office  and  help \ndevelop  a  gender  action  plan.  The  gender  action  plan  will  be  based  on  the  targets  noted \nearlier and will elaborate strategies, plan, monitoring indicators, and budget.  \n\n \n\n\fE.  \n  \n \n \nItem \n\nSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\nSignificant/ \nNot \nSignificant/ \nNone  \n\n \n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nResettlement \n  \n\nNot \nsignificant  \n\n        Appendix 13   \n\n57\n\non \n\nand \n\nthe  procedures \n\n \nThe  proposed  civil  works  for  construction  of  computer \nlearning rooms, libraries, laboratories, and conversion of \nthe  existing  rooms  to  new  uses  in  selected  schools  by \npartitioning  and  extending  the  existing  buildings  do  not \nenvisage  any  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  work. \nHowever,  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  and \nimplemented  whenever  the  need  for  resettlement  is \nidentified.  A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared \nto  ensure  that  if  resettlement  needs  are  identified,  the \nImplementing  Agency \nfor \nfollows \ninvoluntary  resettlement  in  compliance  with  both  ADB\u2019s \nthe \nInvoluntary  Resettlement, \nPolicy \nGovernment\u2019s National Involuntary Resettlement Policy. \nThe  Project  will  require  user  fees  from  the  school \ndevelopment  societies  for  operation  costs  for  computer \nlaboratories in schools as feasible. The stipend program \nwill  be  targeted  to  the  poor  students  to  support  their \nenrollment in 1AB schools. \nLaborers  engaged  in  construction  work  will  be  provided \nwith  fair  wages.  Male  and  female  laborers  will  be  paid \nequal wages for equal work.

The  second  ethnic \nin  Eastern \nminority\u2014the  Muslims\u2014mostly \nProvince.  Sri  Lanka  is  recovering  from  2  decades  of \narmed  conflict.  North-east  region  has  been  particularly \naffected as most of the fighting took place in the area. A \ncease-fire  has  been  declared  and  negotiations  are \ntaking  place.  An  estimated  65,000  people  have  been \nkilled,  and  800,000  internally  displaced  from  the  north -\neast.  Livelihoods,  particularly  for  the  poor,  have  been \ndestroyed  in  the  conflict-affected  areas.  Social  fabric \nhas  been  severely  damaged  and  ethnic  tensions  have \nchildren  have \nbeen  accentuated.  Women  and \nparticularly suffered from the breakup of the social fabric \nand  conflict.  All  aspects  of  the  education  system  are \nseverely  damaged  in  the  north-east.  Nonenrolment, \ndropouts,  absenteeism,  and  po or  learning  quality  are \naggravated as a consequence of displacement, poverty, \nhouseholds with only one head, damaged infrastructure, \nand  lack  of  human  resources.  Approximately  50,000 \nchildren  are  out  of  school.  The  school  dropout  rate \n(15%) is four times the national average. A major aim of \nthe  Project  is  to  reduce  tension  among  the  ethnic \ngroups, and promote peace and social cohesion. \nModernizing the secondary education system in the \nselected schools may have risks in creating disparities \namong schools particularly in the semi-urban, rural, and \nconflicted areas. The Project may incur risks in \nallocating too many resources to a small number of 1AB \nschools because of lack of absorptive capacity of the \nschools.

The Sinhala \npopulation  constitutes  74%,  Tamils  18%,  and  Muslims  7%.  The  Tamils  constitute  the \nlargest ethnic minority group in the country. Jaffna is the principal center of their religious \nand cultural life. Tamils have their own cultural identity. The Muslim population is mainly \nconcentrated in Eastern Province, where they are the largest ethnic group in the Ampara \ndistrict. Although Muslims use Tamil as their language and the medium of instruction in \neducation, their way of life is quite distinct from Tamils. \n \n3. \nIn 1956, Sinhala was designated as the official language. As a result the number \nof Tamils employed by the state, and admitted into higher education institutions became \nlimited.  Since  the  1970s,  Tamil  separatism  and  militancy  has  increased.  The  conflict \nbetween  the  militant  groups  and  the  Government  continued  for  20  years.  The  whole \ncountry has suffered from the ethnic conflict, especially the north-east where most of the \nfighting took place.  \n \nEducation  in  the  north  and  east  regions  was  severely  affected  by  the  conflict. \n4. \nNonenrollment  of  children  for  schooling,  school  dropouts,  and  absenteeism  were  the \nmajor repercussions on education. Around 25% of the schools were closed and 15,000 \nclassrooms  were  damaged.  Approximately  50,000  children  are  out  of  school.  After  the \nceasefire,  enrollment  has  increased  due  to  returning  internally  displaced  people.  A \nsevere shortage of teachers (18%) occurred in the area. Further the widespread poverty \ncaused  by  loss  of  livelihood  and  property  affected  the  education  of  children.  The  north \neast region has the lowest percentages of students in A-level science and mathematics, \nand the highest percentages of unqualified teachers. Girls are deprived from accessing \neducational  facilities  due  to  lack  of  security.  In  addition,  traditional  attitudes  regarding \neducation of girls, often results in school dropout. Some communities in these areas are \nreluctant to send their girls to school.  \n    \nC. \n \nThe  constitutional  provisions  for  ethnic  minorities  are  found  in  articles  dealing \n5. \nwith  fundamental  rights,  proportional  representation,  language  policy  and  devolution. \nThe  1978  Constitution,  Article  18  declared  Sinhala  to  be  the  official  language  of  Sri \nLanka. The 13th Amendment to the Constitution declared Tamil language to be an official \nlanguage.  English  is  declared  to  be  the  link  language.  The  16th Amendment passed in \n1988  declared  that  Sinhala  and  Tamil  to  be  the  languages  of  administration  and \nlanguage of the courts throughout Sri Lanka. \n \n \n\nLegal Framework \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n       Appendix 14 \n\n59\n\nObjective of the Ethnic Minority Development Framework \n\n \n \n \nD. \n \n6. \nThe ethnic minority development framework is to ensure that ethnic minorities in \nthe  project  area  have  equal  access  to  project  benefits.  The  framework  will  provide  the \nprovincial education authorities and the ethnic minority communities with participation in \nplanning  and  implementation  of  the  Project  according  to  the  needs  of  the  secondary \nschool system in the province. \n \nE. \n         \n7. \neducation for the ethnic minorities: \n \n\nThe  following  strategies  will  be  included  in  the  Project  to  improve  the  quality  of \n\nProposed Strategies for Improvement of Education of Ethnic Minorities \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe Project is expected to cover 195 (1 AB and 1C) schools in the north-\neast to improve educational opportunities for Muslim, Tamil, and Sinhala \nstudents.  Once  the  need  analysis  is  conducted,  the  first  priority  is  to \npromote access by improving the condition of the disadvantaged schools, \nincluding schools in the conflict-affected areas in North East Province.  \ninformation  and  communication \nDeployment  of  Tamil-speaking \ntechnology technicians in the north-east and central provinces to provide \ntechnical assistance in computer learning. Of the total 100 fellowships for \nteachers, at least 25 will be for Tamil-speaking teachers. Female teachers \nwill be given preference in science and information technology training.  \nPolicy dialogue will be initiated under the Project to recruit Tamil-speaking \nteachers for mathematics, science, and English in areas where they are \nunderrepresented.  \nFor the stipend program, priority will be given to students from the north-\neast and central provinces (Muslim and Tamil); At least 50% of the total \nstipend in north-east region will be allocated for female students. \nTamil-speaking  specialists  will  be \ntraining \ntrained  as  zonal \nspecialists/facilitators.  Training  of  cadres  and  zonal  facilitators  will  focus \non promoting intercultural harmony and ethnic understanding in schools. \nIn-school  training  of  teachers  and  principals  will  include  methodology  for \npromoting  interethnic  understanding  in  schools  and  society;  Awareness \nraising  on  gender  issues  will  be  included  in  the  training  program  for  the \nzonal planning facilitators, principals, and teachers. \n\n(vii)  Schools  will  be  encouraged  to  use  Internet  facilities  for  both  subject \n\nlearning as well as communicating between Sinhala and Tamil schools.  \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Support  will  be  provided  to  National  Institute  of  Education  to  develop  a \ncivics  curriculum  to  promote  intercultural  understanding  and  harmony \namong students. \nThe  use  of  three  languages  in  computer  learning  will  be  encouraged  by \nproviding subject-specific software in English, Sinhala, and Tamil. \nA  trilingual  provincial  project  manager  will  be  recruited  to  manage  the \nProject  in  north-east  region  and  management  staff  in  the  Ministry  of \nEducation to encourage interethnic understanding.  \n\n(x) \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n60 \n\n \n\nImpact of the Project \n\n \n \nF. \n \n8. \nThe  upgrading  of  schools  and  the  school-based  capacity  development  of \nprincipals and teachers will improve the quality of education, especially in disadvantaged \nareas in the north-east and plantation areas.  \n \n9. \nThe  stipend  program  will  help  poor  students,  especially  girls,  to  gain  access  to \ninformation  and  communication  technology  resources  and  quality  secondary  education \nfacilities.  Provision  of  science  laboratories,  activity  rooms,  libraries,  furniture,  and  other \nequipment will increase school enrolment and minimize school dropouts. \n \nThe  software  package  in  English,  Sinhala,  and,  Tamil,  and  training  of  zonal \n10. \nspecialists,  teachers,  and  principals  for  promoting  ethnic  harmony  will  improve \ninterethnic  understanding.  Use  of  Internet  facilities  and  communication  among  the \nstudents  from  the  different  ethnic  groups  and  development  of  a  civic  curriculum  will \npromote intercultural understanding and harmony among the students. \n  \n11.  With access to quality education and acquisition of new skills, graduates should \nbe able to enter the local and international job markets. The unemployment problem of \nthe youth in the area will also be minimized with the opening of job opportunities in the \nprivate sector. \n \nG. \n \n12. \nThe  initial  work  of  the  Project  at  the  school  level  will  start  with  the  needs \nassessment,  with  input  from  the  school  authority  and  the  school  development.  The \nschool will receive training from zonal facilitators to prepare a school development plan. \nThe  responsibility  of  implementing  the  plan  is  also  vested  with  the  school.  In  this  way, \nschools will become more active in planning their own affairs. This process helps them \nto  identify  school  problems,  conduct  needs  assessments,  and  identify  actions.
