The  project\u2019s  experiences  and  practices  in  addressing  climate \nchange and ecological pressures can be replicated in the rest of the Yangtze River Economic Belt \n(YREB), other parts of the PRC, and other developing member countries. The project leverages \ncofinancing from German development cooperation through KfW and counterpart financing from \nthe Pingjiang County Government (PCG).1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nExtending  across  nine  provinces  and  two  specially  administered  cities,  the  YREB \naccounts for 40% of the PRC\u2019s population, 40% of its freshwater resources, and about 45% of \nthe country\u2019s economic output. It has been earmarked as one of the three growth engines for the \nPRC\u2019s future economic development. While having benefited from extensive growth since the late \n1980s, the YREB is now facing significant development challenges from (i) increasing pollution \nand  pressure  on  natural  resources;  (ii)  slow  transformation  to  green  development;  (iii)  limited \nintegration of waterways, ports, and intermodal logistics; and (iv) weak institutional coordination \nfor  strategic  planning.  In  response,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  formulated  the  YREB \nDevelopment Plan, 2016\u20132030, which prioritizes ecological protection and the promotion of green \ndevelopment  as  guiding  principles  for  the  YREB\u2019s  future  growth. 2 In  this  context,  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  government  agreed  to  adopt  a  framework  approach  that \nprioritizes  (i)  ecosystem  restoration,  environmental  protection,  and  management  of  water \nresources;  (ii)  inclusive  green  industrial  transformation;  (iii)  construction  of  an  integrated \nmultimodal transport corridor; and (iv) institutional and policy reform. The project is included as \npart of the YREB framework. \n \n4. \nThe Miluo River is 253 kilometers (km) long and flows east to west from its headwaters in \nnorthwestern  Jiangxi  Province;  193  km  through  Pingjiang  County,  Hunan  Province;  and  into \nDongting Lake. At its confluence with Dongting Lake, the Miluo River forms an important wetland \nprotection area and flood basin in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River system. The river also \nserves as the main source of drinking water for Pingjiang County. \n \nPingjiang County is located in the northeast of Hunan Province, about 115 km northeast \n5. \nof  the  provincial  capital  of  Changsha  City,  and  covers  4,125  square  kilometers.  It  includes  24 \ntowns,  a  provincial  industrial  park,  and  a  national  scenic  area.  In  2019,  the  total  population  of \nPingjiang County was 1,119,290, with an urban population of 513,400 reflecting an urbanization \n\n1  KfW is a German state-owned development bank formerly known as KfW Bankengruppe. \n2  Government of the PRC. 2015. Outline of the Yangtze River Economic Belt Development Plan, 2016\u20132030. Beijing. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nrate of 45.87%. In 2019, Pingjiang County was one of 51 poverty-stricken counties in the PRC \nand one of 20 poverty-stricken counties in Hunan Province. Each year Pingjiang County attracts \nmore  than  15  million  domestic  visitors,  significantly  impacting  the  local  living  environment. \nBetween 2013 and 2018, flooding and extreme weather events impacted 86 villages in Pingjiang \nCounty, damaging about 344 km of riverbanks and 36,150 hectares (542,250 mu) of cropland,3 \nand resulting in an estimated CNY2,007 million in direct economic losses. \n \n6. \nIncreasing pollution. The ecological environment of the Miluo River in Pingjiang County \nfaces  many  challenges.  About  half  of  all  rural  villages  lack  household  sewage  or  wastewater \ntreatment facilities. Farming practices are unsustainable, and farm waste management systems \ninadequate. These, coupled with inadequate management of solid waste, including plastic waste, \nhave a significant negative impact on the rural living environment, increase public health risks, \nand contribute to the declining water quality in the Miluo River. \n \n7. \nWeak  institutional  coordination  for  integrated  water  resources  and  water-related \ndisaster risk management. Like many small river sub-basins in the Yangtze River system, the \nMiluo River is subject to recurrent flooding, which causes extreme damage to the economy and \nenvironment.  Losses  from  floods  occur  because  of  inadequate  environmental  protection \nmeasures against floods, a lack of integrated water resource and disaster risk management, poor \nrural\u2013urban  planning,  and  inadequate  coordination  with  national  and  provincial  programs  to \nmanage  flood  risk.  There  is  a  particular  need  for  enhanced  institutional  coordination  among \ncounty bureaus to ensure clarity of roles and functions for integrated water resource management \nand information sharing to plan and respond to water-related disasters more effectively. \n \nInadequate rural water and sanitation services. An insufficient supply of safe drinking \n8. \nwater and inadequate access to basic sanitation services are key constraints on socioeconomic \ndevelopment in rural areas, especially for vulnerable groups (including women, children, the poor, \nand the elderly). Rural households are poorer than their urban neighbors, and a lack of affordable \naccess to a safe water supply and sanitation impacts their health, well-being, and living conditions, \nwhile also negatively impacting the rural environment. In 2019 only 46% of the rural population in \nPingjiang County had access to a tap water supply, and only 3% had access to basic sanitation \nfacilities, such as flushing toilets connected to wastewater treatment facilities.4 \n \n9. \nEnvironmentally  unsustainable  livestock  waste  management  and  agricultural \ndevelopment.  Nonpoint  source  pollution  is  having  an  increasingly  negative  impact  on  water \nquality in the region. This is because of at least two factors: (i) rapid intensification of agriculture \nover the past 4 decades in Pingjiang County, and (ii) the associated weak collaboration between \nlivestock producers and farmers. Farmers could benefit from using manure waste generated by \nlivestock producers to grow crops to circulate nutrients within agricultural production systems. In \n2018,  the  agriculture  sector  discharged  about  62.7%  of  chemical  oxygen  demand,  52.0%  of \nammonia nitrogen, and 39.1% of total phosphorous into surface water bodies; with the livestock \nsector discharging 34.1% of chemical oxygen demand, 47.3% of ammonia nitrogen, and 55.2% \nof total phosphorous. This will increase further in the coming years. If not well controlled,  from \n2019 to 2026 it is expected that the chemical oxygen demand discharged into water bodies will \nincrease  by  109%,  ammonia  nitrogen  by  108%,  and  total  phosphorous  by  110%,  with  crop \nproduction and livestock both contributing to about half of the increase (footnote 4). \n \n\n \n3  A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n4  Government of the PRC. 2018.

Beijing. \n\n\f3 \n\n10. \nLack  of  local  community  commitment  to  environmental  protection  and  green \nprocurement  practices.  While  the  Hunan  Provincial  Government  and  PCG  are  committed  to \nachieve environmentally sustainable economic development, the overall environmental literacy of \nlocal  communities  remains  low,  illegal  mining  and  pollution  discharge  by  small  enterprises \ncontinue  to  occur,  and  rapid  economic  development  and  changes  to  traditional  lifestyles  are \naccelerating  environmental  pressures. 5  The  significant  potential  for  reducing  environmental \nimpacts through the \u201creuse, reduce, and recycle\u201d initiative remains largely untapped, and green \nprocurement  as  a  powerful  tool  for  meeting  environmental  policy  objectives  remains  largely \nunused. Public awareness-raising activities have so far overlooked the importance of cultivating \nenvironmental attitudes and values more holistically, thus limiting the level of participation by local \ncommunities in Pingjiang County. \n \nPriorities  and  targets.  The  project  will  support  the  priorities  in  the  PRC\u2019s  National \n11. \nStrategic Plan for Rural Vitalization, 2018\u20132022,6 cascaded down in the PCG local context. These \ninclude (i) promoting rural ecological vitalization, pursuing green development, and augmenting \nefforts to deal with significant issues concerning the protection of the rural ecological environment; \n(ii)  pushing  forward  cultural  revitalization  in  rural  areas  and  strengthening  public  cultural \nawareness;  (iii)  enhancing  basic  services  in  rural  communities  and  training  professional  rural \nservice personnel with a good knowledge of agriculture, rural areas, and rural people\u2019s needs; \nand  (iv)  reducing  gaps  between  urban  and  rural  residents  by  developing  the  rural  economy, \nproviding  employment  and  business  opportunities  to  farmers  and  increasing  income  from \nproperty, and helping farmers achieve common prosperity as an immediate target. Access to a \nsafe  water  supply  and  sanitation  together  with  good hygiene  practices  will  prevent  waterborne \ndiseases and help reduce the risk of epidemics like the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).7 \n \n12. \nStrategic fit.  The project  will  demonstrate rural vitalization and ecological  protection  in \nPingjiang County and contribute to the PRC\u2019s high-quality development goals consistent with the \nThirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020;8 upcoming Fourteenth Five-Year Plan, 2021\u20132025; and \nthe priority areas under the provincial thirteenth five-year plans. It is also aligned with the YREB \nDevelopment  Plan,  2016\u20132030  (footnote  2),  and  the  rural  vitalization  strategy  outlined  in  the \nmemorandum of understanding between the National Development and Reform Commission and \nADB.9 The  project  builds  on  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  particularly  operational  priority  3;10 ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy (CPS) for the PRC, 2016\u20132020;11 and the forthcoming ADB CPS for \nthe PRC, 2021\u20132025.

Lessons  relevant  to  ADB  operations  in  the  PRC  have  informed  the  project \ndesign. 13  The  project  design  also  incorporates  international  best  practices  and  innovative \napproaches for natural capital investments.14 These include (i) integrated approaches to deliver \nco-benefits across sectors (i.e., water and sanitation, disaster risk management, and agriculture); \nand  (ii)  innovative  technology  (i.e.,  smart  systems  for  flood risk  management).  In  addition,  the \nproject will pilot innovative green procurement practices and mainstream environmental education \nacross  the  county  education  system  to  improve  the  overall  environmental  literacy  of  Pingjiang \nCounty  residents  through  leveraging  youth  engagement  and  targeted  outreach  activities. \nKnowledge and lessons will be disseminated through national and international fora to replicate \nand scale-up integrated approaches and innovative technologies and solutions within the PRC \nand other developing member countries. \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: rural vitalization and ecological protection \nin the YREB realized.15 The project will have the following outcome: the rural living environment \nin Pingjiang County improved.16 \n \n15. \nOutput  1:  Water-related  disaster  risk  management  strengthened.  This  output  will \nmitigate  the  potential  impact  of  flooding  on  people\u2019s  livelihoods  and  property,  as  well  as  the \nsocioeconomic consequences of flood events. This output includes (i) the construction of 38.9 km \nof ecological embankments and/or riverbank reinforcements in 12 towns along the Miluo River in \nPingjiang County to control flooding; (ii) establishment of riparian buffers along riverbanks using \nnature-based solutions to prevent water and soil losses; (iii) restoration and protection of Huangjin \nRiver  National  Wetland Park  to  enhance  biodiversity  conservation,  increase  flood  storage  and \nwater quality purification capacity, and promote environmental education; and (iv) establishment \nof an integrated smart disaster risk management  and early warning system to inform disaster-\nrelated decision-making and improve institutional coordination. \n \n16. \nOutput  2:  Access  to  safe  drinking  water  and  sanitation  services  enhanced.

The  PCG  is preparing  a \npandemic  recovery  and  green  stimulus  plan.  The  project  is  considered  a  priority  for  the  local \ngovernment  as  part  of  the  post-COVID-19  pandemic  multisector  response,  in  line  with  the \necological road map to be embedded in the forthcoming Fourteenth Five-Year Plan.21 Increased \naccess  to  improved  sanitation  is  critical  to  safeguard  human  and  environmental  health.22 By \nadopting a comprehensive and gender-sensitive approach to build climate adaptation into rural\u2013\nurban planning, the project will enhance the resilience of local livelihoods and the environment. \nThis is particularly relevant to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in highly exposed \nand  vulnerable  communities  in  rural  areas,  who  are  most  negatively  affected  by  the  physical, \neconomic, and health impacts of climate change. \n \nD. \n \n21. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  \u20ac299.07  million  (Table  1).

The \nproject  was  prepared  by  licensed  domestic  design  institutes,  taking  into  account  transaction \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  consultant  recommendations  in  accordance  with  relevant  PRC \nguidelines and regulations. The technical feasibility was confirmed to be adequate after detailed \nexamination  of  the  project\u2019s  compatibility  with  local  conditions,  including  current  and  projected \nclimate  variables,  availability  of  water  sources,  proximity  to  residents,  and  available  land  for \nproject facilities. Alternative technical options identified the most suitable sites for the facilities, \nand different forms of river embankments and wetlands to suit the local environment. The project \nwill also finance capacity building for implementing agencies\u2019 staff to ensure adequate skills for \nproject implementation and operation and maintenance (O&M). \n \n\n\f9 \n\nSustainability \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\nB. \n \n27. \nThe economic analysis indicates that the project is economically viable, with an overall \neconomic internal rate of return of 24.3% and a net present value of CNY3,400.09 million. The \nanalysis also confirms the economic viability of all subprojects, with economic internal rates of \nreturn ranging from 19.2% to 28.3%.25 A sensitivity analysis showed that the project is resilient to \nnegative scenarios such as an increase in investment costs, revenue reduction, and increase in \nO&M costs. The eco-framing subproject under Output 3 will generate revenue and is expected to \nrecover all its costs from its revenue. Financial analysis of the project indicated a financial internal \nrate of return of 15.20% for this eco-farming subproject. Its financial internal rate of return exceeds \nthe weighted average cost of capital of 0.54%. The financial net present value was estimated at \nCNY1,066 million. Sensitivity analysis showed that the subproject remains financially viable under \nseveral potential adverse scenarios. The financial analysis confirms the financial viability of the \nrevenue-generating  subproject  since  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  greater  than  the \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital,  and  the  financial  net  present  value  is  positive.  The financial \nsustainability of the subprojects was assessed based on the fiscal impact of counterpart funds \nduring  the  project, O&M  costs,  and  the  loan  repayment  obligation.  The analysis  confirmed  the \nproject\u2019s financial sustainability since it will have substantially limited fiscal consequences for the \nPCG.26 \n \nC. \n \n28. \nAssessments were carried out in the following areas: (i) integrated planning, procurement, \nand  financial  management;  (ii)  institutional  coordination  and  capacity  development;  (iii)  water \nquality  management,  integrated  flood  risk  management,  climate  adaptation  and  mitigation \nmainstreaming, and environmental planning and monitoring; (iv) wastewater and drainage system \ndesign, construction, and operation; and (v) sustainable and integrated urban\u2013rural environmental \nmanagement  and  monitoring.  The project  will  support  the  PCG  in preparing  and implementing \ncountywide  capital  investment  as  well  as  strategic  cumulative  environmental  and  social \nassessments to ensure that urban and rural growth plans are sustainable. Since this is the first \nADB  and  KfW  investment  project  with  the  PCG,  the  project  management  office  (PMO)  will \ncoordinate all key tasks with the support of the project management consultants. In addition, the \ncapacity-building  activities  were  designed  to  ensure  that  state-of-the-art  information  and \ncommunication  technology  elements  are  harnessed  to  enhance  countywide  institutional \ncoordination.  These  activities  will  provide  adequate  support  for  flood  and  disaster  risk \nmanagement, water quality, and environmental health and safety monitoring. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nThe assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial, mainly because the \nexecuting and implementing agencies lack experience in executing ADB-financed projects. This \nrisk will be mitigated through the financial management action plan described in the PAM (footnote \n23).  The  PCG  will  ensure  that  (i)  additional  training  on  ADB\u2019s  disbursement  procedures  is \nprovided,  (ii)  unified  financial  management  guidelines  are  formulated  with  assistance from  the \nproject implementation consultants (PICs), (iii) the PMO recruits qualified finance staff to conduct \nfinancial management, and (iv) the ADB and PICs provide additional assistance and training in \nproject management. Given the mitigating measures, these financial management arrangements \nare  deemed  adequate.  Risk  mitigation  measures  are  outlined  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk \n\nGovernance \n\n25 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nmanagement plan.27 A procurement capacity assessment confirmed that the PMO, acting through \na procurement agency and with assistance from ADB and the PICs, will have adequate capacity \nto  facilitate  project  procurement  in  compliance  with  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as \namended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n30. \nStrategic  procurement  planning  was  carried  out  to  identify  procurement  risks,  develop \nmitigating  measures,  review  procurement  options,  and  agree  on  fit-for-purpose  procurement \narrangements. Value for money will be achieved by (i) assigning dedicated in-house PMO staff \nas  green  procurement  focal  points;  (ii)  applying  a  community  participation  approach  for  eco-\nfarming;  (iii)  assigning  early  start-up  consulting  as  nonbank-financed  packages  to  ensure \nmobilization  efficiency;  (iv)  advance  contracting  for  ADB-financed  project  management  and \ncapacity-building consulting services to ensure proper capacity building and technical guidance \nfrom the early stage of implementation; (v) using the request for quotations modality for standard, \nreadily available goods with low quality risk; and (vi) using a point scoring system for the design, \nbuilding,  and  equipment  supply  of  the  exhibition  center  contract  package,  as  well  as  clean \ndelineation of the ADB- and KfW-funded packages to avoid a dual agency procurement review of \nthe same package. \n \n31. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and PCG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 23). \n \nE. \n \n32. \nPoverty and social. The project is classified as general intervention for poverty reduction. \nThe poverty and social analysis was undertaken based on extensive stakeholder consultations \nand social surveys during project preparation. The project\u2019s direct beneficiaries are the 523,333 \nresidents  of  239  villages  in  25  project  towns  and  subdistricts  in  Pingjiang  County,  including \n254,864 women (48.7%), and 112,517 low-income people (21.5%). The project will contribute to \npoverty reduction and social development in the project area by (i) mitigating the potential impact \nof flooding and reducing flood disaster-related losses, (ii) improving access to safe drinking water \nand  sanitation  services,  (iii)  increasing  crop  yields  and  farmers\u2019  agricultural  incomes,                        \n(iv)  enhancing  residents\u2019  skills,  (v)  increasing  jobs  and  income-generating  opportunities,  and                 \n(vi) lowering health risks through an improved environment and sanitation. It is estimated that the \nproject will provide 2,884 skilled and 3,712 non-skilled jobs (including non-skilled part-time jobs) \nfor residents during construction. A social development action plan, including specific actions and \ntargets for the poor and low-income people, has been prepared. \n \n33. \nGender.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  following  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects.28 A gender analysis conducted \nduring project preparation identified the following areas of action and targets under the project\u2019s \ngender action plan: (i) quotas for the participation of women in emergency response and safety \ntraining  on  water-related  disasters,  (ii)  leadership  training  provided  to  female  managers  and \ncooperative  members  to  strengthen  women\u2019s  leadership  roles  in  eco-farming  development,                  \n(iii) quotas for women managers on eco-farming demonstration farms and farmer cooperatives, \n(iv) women\u2019s networks established to share information and knowledge on improved sustainable \nfarming practices and environmental management, (v) quotas for women in skilled and unskilled \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n27 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 ADB. 2012.

The initial environmental examination is based on the domestic \nfeasibility studies and environmental assessments, site visits, and stakeholder consultations. The \nPCG, through the PMO, will be responsible for  the implementation of and compliance with the \nEMP.  Qualified  full-time  environment  officers  will  be  assigned  to  the  PMO  and  project \nimplementation units, and a training program has been included in the EMP. The project will yield \nenvironmental  benefits,  including  improved  water  quality,  flood  control,  and  solid  waste \nmanagement. Risks include the potential release of contaminants from polluted sediments during \ndredging  works,  short-term  construction  impacts  (e.g.,  dust  and  noise),  and  pollution  from \nlivestock waste or the use of agricultural chemicals during operations. The outbreak and global \nspread of COVID-19 presents a risk to the health of workers and residents. Measures to address \nthese risks have been included in the EMP and include procedures for the treatment and disposal \nof dredge spoil, wastewater, solid waste, and sludge; riverbank rehabilitation; and the preparation \nof a COVID-19 health and safety plan based on best-practice guidelines. \n \n36. \nmu,  including  state-owned  land  occupation  of  527.85  mu  and  permanent  land  acquisition  of                  \n170.24 mu. In addition, the project will use 1,219.4 mu temporarily during construction. The project \nwill demolish three old abandoned houses with a total area of 628.53 square meters, owned by \nthree households with 16 persons. The project\u2019s permanent land acquisition will affect a total of \n64 households with 269 persons, and significantly affect 20 households with 83 persons. \n \n37. \nThe PCG has prepared a resettlement plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement  and  relevant  laws  and  regulations  of  the  PRC. 31  The  resettlement  plan  includes \nadequate  compensation  and  livelihood  restoration  measures  for  affected  people.  Surveys  and \nconsultations  were  undertaken  with  affected  people  during  the  resettlement  plan  preparation, \ninformation from the resettlement plan disclosed to affected persons, and the resettlement plan \nposted  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  Affected  people  will  be  further  consulted  during  the  updating  and \nimplementation of the resettlement plan. A grievance redress mechanism has been established \nand incorporated into the resettlement plan. While the PCG, PMO, and project implementation \nunits  have  the  capacity  to  implement  domestically  funded  projects,  their  capacity  will  be \nstrengthened to implement the resettlement plan and conduct internal monitoring in compliance \nwith  ADB  requirements.
