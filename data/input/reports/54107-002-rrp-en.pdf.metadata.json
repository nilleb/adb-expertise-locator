THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to\nNepal for the additional financing of the Electricity Grid Modernization Project.\n2. The original Electricity Grid Modernization Project is financing high priority electricity grid\nmodernization investments in transmission and distribution systems in Nepal, and supporting\nsector reform and the financial sustainability of Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA).1 The original\nproject will complete the installation of smart meters in the Kathmandu Valley and the automation\nof existing grid substations, and will finance the modernization of distribution and transmission\nsystems in various parts of the country. The $156 million loan was approved on 26 November\n2020, signed on 30 December 2020, and declared effective on 4 February 2021. The purpose of\nthe  proposed  additional  financing  is  to  scale  up  critical  investments  in  transmission  and\ndistribution that are now ready. The report and recommendation of the President for the ongoing\nproject is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2.\nII. THE PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n3. The additional financing project meets the eligibility criteria for additional financing. The\noriginal project is performing well as it meets all of the following criteria: (i) the original project is\nrated on track under the project performance system; (ii) each safeguard covenant item is being\ncomplied with or is expected to be complied with, and there are no major or long-standing\nsafeguard issues relating to the original project that need to be immediately addressed prior to\nadditional financing approval; (iii) delivery of expected outputs is on track; and (iv) management\nof risks is rated on track, as all the risks included in the risk assessment and risk management\nplan are being managed.\n4. The government has sought additional assistance from the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB) to enhance the capacity of its critical transmission and distribution network in line with\nNEA\u2019s Corporate Development Plan.2 These investments, which could not be accommodated in\nthe original project because of lack of readiness when the original project was processed, are \nneeded to support efficient and reliable delivery of power to reach the country\u2019s electricity\nconsumption target of 700 kilowatt hours per capita by 2026, reduce system losses to 13%, and \nachieve 100% recovery of NEA\u2019s operating costs by 2027. The additional activities (i) are strongly\nlinked to the original project scope and outcome, (ii) can be implemented efficiently under the \nsame implementation arrangements, and (iii) have high readiness. The overall project outcome \nis aligned with a 2018 government white paper, which articulated the vision for the energy sector.3 \nIt is also aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Nepal, 2020\u20132024, and supports the\ngovernment's development objective of accelerated and inclusive economic growth, energy \nsector  reform,  and  financial  sustainability.4 The  overall  project  remains  aligned  with  six \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020.

", "2 \noperational priorities under ADB Strategy 2030.5 It will contribute to (i) operational priority 1 \n(addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities) by strengthening the electricity supply \nnetwork; (ii) operational priority 2 (accelerating progress in gender equality) by targeting women, \nand excluded and vulnerable groups for awareness raising and capacity building; (iii) operational \npriority 3 (tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability) by upgrading transmission and distribution systems to evacuate \nhydropower to load centers, and reduce system losses; (iv) operational priority 4 (making cities \nmore livable) by improving the urban environment in the Kathmandu Valley and towns in other \nareas;  (v)  operational  priority  6  (strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity)  by \nstrengthening NEA\u2019s system including the capacity of its staff; and (vi) operational priority 7\n(fostering regional  cooperation and integration) by establishing a system to commence the \noperations of NEA\u2019s Nepal Power Trading Company Limited.\nB. Project Description\n5. The impact and outcome of the overall project will remain unchanged.6\n6. Outputs and project scope. The overall project will increase the scope of outputs 1 and\n2 of the original project, contributing to the expansion, strengthening, and modernization of both\ntransmission capacity and the distribution network in project areas. Under output 1 of the project,\n(i)16 kilometers of 132-kilovolt transmission lines will be constructed from Nepalgunj to Kohalpur,\nand from Chovar to Lagankhel; and (ii) an additional 477 megavolt-amperes of substation capacity\nwill be introduced to the system through the construction of substations in Dumkibas, Lagankhel,\nMulpani, and Nepalgunj. Under output 2, (i) an enterprise resource planning system and a\nrevenue management system will be implemented, and (ii) a project supervision consultant firm\nwill be appointed to oversee improvements to the integration of NEA\u2019s financial and customer \ninformation systems. This will help to modernize the distribution system, enhance supply and \nsystem security, and enhance NEA\u2019s overall institutional development.\nC. Value Added by ADB\n7. ADB is leveraging its own resources to help the government and NEA meet the substantial\nfinancial and skills resource requirements necessary to achieve critical energy sector reforms.\nADB\u2019s continued involvement signals to investors and other development partners that the\ngovernment is committed to reforms, and that NEA is on a path to sustainability. The overall \nproject will build on the experience and lessons of previous ADB projects, particularly on advance \nprocurement and procurement packaging, implementation schedules, and stronger monitoring \nand supervision. ADB is also drawing on its experience in promoting regional cooperation and \nintegration, and adoption of new technologies (e.g., substation automation) and appropriate \nconstruction methods, bird-sensitive design (including bird diverters).  \nD. Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plans\n8. The overall project is estimated to cost $270 million (Table 1).\n5  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n6  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. ", "3 \n9.

The government has requested a concessional loan of $60 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary\ncapital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nThe Ministry of Finance will relend the loan to NEA on the same terms as the ADB loan to Nepal. \n11. The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to\nkey turnkey contracts under outputs 1 and 2 and project supervision consultants. The government\nwill utilize its counterpart funds to meet the remaining costs of the project, including land\nacquisition and other social and environmental mitigation, contingencies, and taxes and duties.\nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nCurrenta  Additional Financing  Total \nAmount  Share of  Amount  Share of  Amount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)  Total (%)  ($ million)  Total (%)  ($ million)  Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank \nOrdinary capital resources  156.0  80.0  60.0  80.0  216.0  80.0 \n(concessional loan) \nGovernment of Nepal  39.0  20.0  15.0  20.0  54.0  20.0 \nTotal  195.0  100.0  75.0  100.0  270.0  100.0 \na Refers to the original amount. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n12.

", "4 \nE. Implementation Arrangements\n13. Implementation arrangements for the additional financing project will remain the same as\nthose of the original project. NEA will serve as the executing agency and will implement all\nactivities through its project management directorate. Project supervision consultants recruited\nunder the original project will support NEA in implementing the overall project. An additional\nproject implementation support consultant will be engaged to assist in the implementation of the\nenterprise resource  planning  and  revenue management  system.  All procurement,  including\nconsulting services, will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time)\nand Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time) and its\nassociated staff instructions. The Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation will provide\nsupport and guidance to NEA and facilitate coordination among different agencies. There will be\nadvance contracting for goods, works, and consulting services; and retroactive financing for works\nup to a maximum of 20% of the loan amount. The indicative implementation period of the\nadditional financing will be from October 2021 to March 2026, and the loan closing date of 30\nSeptember 2026 for the additional financing project will be the same as the closing date of the\noriginal project. The implementation arrangements are described in detail in the PAM (footnote\n7).\nIII. DUE DILIGENCE\nA. Summary Due Diligence Results\n14. A summary of the due diligence assessments for the proposed additional financing is\npresented in Table 3. The full due diligence assessments are accessible from the list of linked\ndocuments in Appendix 2.\nTable 3: Summary of Due Diligence Assessments \nArea of \nAssessment  Summary of Assessment \nTechnical  Due diligence was undertaken, and the proposed works follow international good practice and are \nconsidered technically acceptable. The project design also incorporates climate change-related \naspects and will contribute to the reduction of 6,736 tons of carbon dioxide per year by displacing \nalternative fuels with clean electricity from the grid. The project is categorized medium risk in the \nclimate change assessment (footnote 8). \nEconomic and  The project was analyzed for economic viability in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines for economic \nfinancial  analysisa and a with-project and without-project framework was adopted. The EIRR for the additional \nviability  financing components is 14.5% (13.8% excluding environmental benefits), well above the hurdle rate \nof 9%. The aggregate EIRR of the overall project, including the additional financing components, is \n14.6% (14.1% excluding environmental benefits), a slight decrease  from the EIRR of 14.8% \nestimated during appraisal of the original project. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the project\u2019s \nexpected economic performance is robust under a range of downside scenarios. Financial analysis \nof the project was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines on financial management and\nanalysis of projects.b The aggregate financial internal rate of return was estimated at 2.9% (compared \nto 2.8% of the original project without the additional financing component), which is above the \nweighted average cost of capital of 2.3% (in post-tax real terms).c \nSustainability  Strong commitment to improve performance and a government-backed financial restructuring plan \nallowed NEA to post a net profit of NRs1.5 billion in FY2017 (its first profit since FY2007), with profit \nincreasing to NRs9.8 billion in FY2019 (provisional unaudited results for FY2020 show profit of NRs11 \nbillion). With the commissioning of several power plants and the establishment of the ERC in 2017, \nthe short- to medium-term financial outlook for NEA is increasingly favorable. The ERC issued its first \n1-year tariff order for NEA in June 2020, which (i) allows NEA to recover its economically efficient\ncosts and to earn a reasonable return on equity; and (ii) provides much-needed certainty with respect\nto tariff trajectory and to NEA\u2019s ability to fund its operations, investments, and debt servicing. ", "5 \nArea of \nAssessment  Summary of Assessment \nGovernance  Financial  management.  NEA  has  been  assessed  against  ADB\u2019s  financial  management \nrequirements. The financial management risk remains substantial. NEA\u2019s progress against the action \nplan  of  the  original  project  was  analyzed  and  risks  were  reassessed.  An  updated  financial \nmanagement action plan was agreed with NEA. NEA has executed similar projects before and is \ncapable of managing funds flow, disbursement procedures, accounting, and financial reporting under \nthe overall project. Counterpart funds from the government to NEA and the terms and conditions \nattached to their availability have been approved. However, the auditors of NEA have consistently \nissued qualified audit opinions. NEA has undertaken various initiatives, including World Bank-funded \nprojects, for fixed assets verification, valuation and fixed asset register preparation, and conversion \nof its financial statements to the national financial reporting system. A detailed time-bound financial \nmanagement action plan has been prepared to address audit qualifications and incorporate other \nreforms at NEA. The implementation of an enterprise resource planning solution and revenue \nmanagement system for NEA is included in the financial management action plan which will be \nfunded under the additional financing. \nProcurement. A procurement capacity assessment of NEA was conducted as part of due diligence. \nNEA has sufficient capacity and experience in local and foreign procurement, including ADB\u2019s \nstandard bidding procedures. Through strategic procurement planning, NEA will be able to achieve \nvalue for money by (i) strategic contract packaging, where some small packages are consolidated \ninto one bigger package to attract more competition; and (ii) application of lowest-evaluated cost as \none of the selection criteria. \nAnticorruption. Integrity due diligence was conducted on NEA, the members of its board of directors, \nand its senior management.d No significant or potentially significant integrity risks were identified. \nADB has obtained reasonable assurance that the borrower was not established and is not being used \nfor money laundering or terrorism financing in the project jurisdiction. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy\n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and NEA. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration \nmanual.e \nPoverty,  The government, in pursuit of Sustainable Development Goal 1 (end poverty in all its forms \nsocial, and  everywhere), aims to further reduce poverty significantly by the end of 2030. However, limited access \ngender  to modern energy has hindered development. The COVID-19 pandemic has had disproportionate \nimpacts  on  the  poor,  informal  sector  workers,  migrant  workers,  households  that  depend  on \nremittances, and women. With the economic disruption caused by the pandemic, vulnerable \nindividuals, including those who are just above the poverty line, are likely to be pushed below the \npoverty line. ADB estimates that Nepal's extreme poverty headcount ratio at $1.90/day could increase \nfrom 3.9% in 2020 to 5.0% in 2021, while the poverty headcount ratio could increase from 27.7% to \n31.2% in the same period.f   The project aims to improve the quality of electricity supply and will create \nemployment opportunities for skilled and unskilled labor. Moreover, availability of clean energy \nthrough improved transmission and distribution network will improve urban and rural air quality, \npeople\u2019s health, living conditions, and overall quality of life. The overall project remains to be\ncategorized effective gender mainstreaming. The project will continue supporting (i) institutionalizing \nNEA\u2019s GESI strategy and operational guideline approved in March 2020; (ii) training women staff of\nNEA on technical subjects as well as leadership and management skills; and (iii) increasing \nknowledge of at least 2,000 electricity consumers, including women and excluded vulnerable groups \non safe and efficient use of electricity. NEA\u2019s women staff will receive trainings on grid substation\nautomation, corporate development, and improved billing and collection. NEA will implement, monitor, \nand report the progress in an updated GESI action plan. \nSafeguards  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard categories are \nas follows.g \nEnvironment (category B). The project includes a 10.46 kilometer overhead transmission line \nthrough agricultural land, a 6-kilometer underground transmission line along urban roads, and four \nsubstations. National environment clearances are to be obtained before contract award. The most \nsignificant project impacts will be disruption during underground cabling and substation works in \nadjacent residential properties; impacts can be mitigated through implementation of the EMP included \nin the IEE prepared per ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and national environment, health, \nand safety provisions. Since the project involves an existing substation, an environmental audit was \nconducted; the EMP includes corrective action. One other substation is an existing facility under \nconstruction funded by another ADB project. Dumkibas substation is located on agricultural land in \nChure Conservation Area. The transmission line construction to which it connects is nearing \ncompletion.  It is not an associated facility per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), but due\ndiligence has been undertaken as a precaution. These works are in accordance with Chure ", "6 \nArea of \nAssessment  Summary of Assessment \nConservation Area management plan, its management has been consulted, and measures promoting \nits conservation aims are to be supported. The IEE was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 8 June 2021\nand will be locally disclosed by NEA. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B) and indigenous peoples (category B). The project will \naffect an estimated 168 households comprising an estimated population of 1,158 persons. The \nproject will acquire 6.62 hectares of land for tower footing and substation construction, which will \naffect an estimated 81 households comprising 558 persons. Of this total, 9 households comprising \n50 persons are estimated to experience major impacts because of physical displacement from \nhousing and/or loss of 10% or more of their productive assets (income-generating assets). The other \n72 of 81 households will experience limited impacts because of loss of land measuring less than 10% \nof their total land holdings. A total of 25 structures (9 residential houses, 15 nonresidential private \nstructures, and 1 community structure) are anticipated to be permanently affected. An additional \n18.03 hectares are needed for transmission line right-of-way. Two landless households need to be \nrelocated from residences they established in the right-of-way area. Of the affected households, 57 \nare vulnerable, including 40 indigenous households (286 persons) comprising 5 groups (Gurung, \nMagar, Newar, Tamang, and Tharu). Impacts to indigenous peoples do not extend beyond those \naddressed under the land acquisition and resettlement process. The project\u2019s social impacts were \nadequately assessed, and compensation will be paid commensurate with replacement costs. The \nproject will extend benefit sharing among the local communities, including affected indigenous \npeoples and other vulnerable households, through a combination of livelihood enhancement skill \ntraining programs and other community development programs. A combined resettlement and \nindigenous peoples plan was disclosed on the ADB website on 7 June 2021. \nEnvironmental and social safeguards implementation. Meaningful consultations on safeguards \nwere held and will continue during project implementation. NEA established a grievance redress \nmechanism under the original project that will be utilized for the additional financing. NEA will \nsupervise and monitor project implementation with the support of project supervision consultants, \nsubmit semiannual monitoring reports. NEA\u2019s safeguards capacity has been strengthened with its\nsafeguards and gender department. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, EMP = environmental management plan, \nERC = Electricity Regulatory Commission, FY = fiscal year, GESI = gender equality and social inclusion, IEE = initial \nenvironmental examination, NEA = Nepal Electricity Authority. \na  ADB. 2017.
