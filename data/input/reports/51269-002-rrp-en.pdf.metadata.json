The entire $50 million \nloan  has  been  disbursed  to the PKSF,  which  has then  disbursed  it to  39,580  microenterprises \nthrough its 77 partner organizations, with an average loan size of $1,493, generating 91,430 rural \njobs.2 The report and recommendation of the President for the current project is accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n \n3. \nactivities of microenterprises, severely impacted by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).  \n \n\nThe additional financing will scale up the ongoing project and help restore the economic \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n  \n4. \nThe  COVID-19  pandemic  has  severely  affected  the  lives  and  livelihoods  of  people  in \nBangladesh. Many formal and informal workers in rural and urban areas have lost their livelihoods \nbecause of the pandemic and its associated economic shocks. Women have been heavily hit, as \nthey  are  often  entrepreneurs  and  wage  earners  in  agriculture,  fisheries,  livestock,  small \nmanufacturing, food processing, services, and trading. People living marginally above the poverty \nline are being pushed back into poverty as alternative employment opportunities are not available. \nGovernment support for wages to selected industry workers and cash subsidies to the urban poor, \nthough  extremely  helpful  as  a  stopgap  measure,  cannot  be  sustained  over  long  periods. \nEmployment generation, especially in rural areas, needs to be supported. \n \nMicroenterprises,  with  their  large  employment  potential,  are  ideal  for  job  creation. 3 \n5. \nHowever,  they  are  facing  working  capital  constraints,  supply  disruptions,  and  low  demand \nbecause of the COVID-19 economic slowdown; and their liquidity is severely constrained.4 This \nis affecting employment, production, and revenues. Women entrepreneurs who have experienced \nbusiness losses do not have sufficient liquid assets, personal savings, or access to finance, so \nthey have been forced to shut down or drastically scale down business operations.5 The PKSF \n\n \n\n1  ADB. 2018.

Manila. \n2   The  project  supported  32,576  microenterprises  in  the  first  phase  of  loan  disbursement  by  February  2020.  An \nadditional  Tk1,064.34  million  in  loans  was  provided  to  7,004  microenterprises  and  225  repeat  microenterprise \nborrowers from revolving funds (loan recovery) up to August 2020. The loan recovery rate was 99.4%. \n\n3   According  to  Bangladesh\u2019s  Economic  Census  of  2013,  about  89%  of  the  7.8  million  economic  establishments  in \nBangladesh  are  microenterprises,  including  cottage  businesses;  and  75%  of  these  microenterprises  are  in  rural \nareas, providing local employment. \n\n4  An evaluation by the PKSF of the impact of COVID-19 on its operations, covering 160 microenterprises in 23 districts, \n\nfound that 99.4% of microenterprises reported a decline in sales because of COVID-19. \n\n5   A study found that 65% of women entrepreneurs had no income from February to June 2020 during the lockdown. \nWomen entrepreneurs reported a 67% decline in their personal income after March. One-third of them had to shut \ntheir businesses during the pandemic. BRAC. 2020.

The  project \n\nestimates that about $170 million of additional financing is needed for post-COVID-19 economic \nrestoration and to meet microenterprises\u2019 demand for working capital.6 The additional financing \nwill help retain businesses and protect the employment of affected microenterprises.  \n \nPerformance of the ongoing project. The ongoing project is performing well as (i) it is \n6. \nrated on track in the project performance rating system; (ii) safeguards are complied with; (iii) the \ndelivery  of  expected  outputs,  including  the  implementation  of  the  gender  action  plan,  is  rated \nsuccessful; and (iv) risk management is rated successful, as all risks in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan have been managed successfully.7 Women borrowers comprise 78% of \nthe  microenterprises  receiving  financing.  The  TA  is  supporting  the  PKSF  and  its  partner \norganizations to expand MFIs\u2019 microenterprise development services and financing; and to pilot \ntest new technology through innovative, mobile-based microenterprise financing applications.8 It \nis providing MFIs with skills for risk assessment, credit appraisal, and financial management for \nmicroenterprise  finance,  as  well  as  increasing  capacity  in  microenterprise  lending  by \nimplementing  gender-inclusive \nis  also  strengthening \nenvironmental  and social  screening systems for the  PKSF  and  its  partner  organizations.  Good \nprogress  has  been  made  to  develop  a  medium-term  institutional  strengthening  and  financing \nstrategy for the PKSF, including retaining its competitiveness and relevance.  \n \n7. \nSuitability of using the additional financing modality. The proposed project meets the \neligibility criteria for additional financing. The overall project is (i) technically feasible, economically \nviable, and financially sound; (ii) accorded high priority by the government; (iii) consistent with the \nproject\u2019s development objective; and (iv) consistent with ADB\u2019s country operations business plan \nfor Bangladesh, 2021\u20132023.9 The proposed additional financing is strongly linked to the ongoing \nproject\u2019s  outputs  and  outcome,  uses the  same  design  and  implementation  arrangements,  and \nbuilds on the lessons learned and due diligence of the ongoing project. \n \n8. \nStrategic  context.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  National  Sustainable \nDevelopment Strategy, 2010\u20132021, which promotes micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises \nto generate job opportunities.10 It is aligned with the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \nto address remaining poverty and reduce inequalities, accelerate progress in gender equity, and \npromote  rural  development.11 It  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership strategy,  2016\u2013\n2020, which identifies improving rural livelihoods and expanding employment opportunities as key \npriority areas.12 The project will complement support from other development partners.13 \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe impact and outcome of the project remain unchanged. The project is aligned with the \nfollowing impact: growth of microenterprises expanded to provide forward linkages to agriculture \nand generate job opportunities. The project outcome is microenterprises\u2019 access to MFI financing \n\nProject Description \n\n \n\n6   The PKSF estimates that about 1.7 million microenterprises supported by them have lost an average of 10%\u201315% \nof their capital ($415 million) because of COVID-19. The PKSF contributes an average of 40% of a microenterprise\u2019s \ncapital, which amounts to $170 million. \n\n7   The cumulative loan recovery rate for the ongoing project is 99.4%. \n8   The ongoing TA will be topped up to support the additional financing project. \n9   ADB. 2020.

The overall project focuses on \ngender  equity,  and  targets  a  loan  portfolio  with  at  least  70%  women  borrowers.14 The  project \noutputs remain unchanged, while performance indicators will be updated. The revised design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The additional financing project comprises three outputs. \n \n10. \nOutput 1: Funding to microfinance institutions for microenterprise loans expanded. \nThis output will provide a credit line to the PKSF for relending to its partner organizations to ease \nshort-term  microenterprise  financing  constraints.  It  aims  to  provide  loans  to  at  least  30,000 \nCOVID-19 affected microenterprises who are eligible members of partner organizations, 70% of \nwhom  are  female. 15 The  PKSF\u2019s  microenterprise  total  loans  outstanding  will  be  Tk24  billion, \nalmost double the 2017 baseline, with at least Tk5 billion for COVID-19 affected microenterprises. \nThe  partner  organizations\u2019  microenterprise  loan  portfolio  outstanding  will  reach  Tk160  billion, \nmore than double the 2017 baseline, of which at least 70% are for female borrowers. To address \nmedium-term  financing  constraints,  a  medium-term  institutional  strengthening  and  financing \nstrategy for the PKSF was developed under the ongoing project. This is under discussion, and \nthe PKSF will adopt the agreed recommendations. \n \n11. \nOutput 2: Microfinance institutions\u2019 capacity in microenterprise lending enhanced. \nThis  output  will  enhance  MFI  capacity  in  microenterprise  lending  by  implementing  gender-\ninclusive finance guidelines, improved under the ongoing project. Training (including refresher) \nwill  be  provided  to  120  partner  organizations  using  the  microenterprise  finance  operational \nguidelines  developed  under the  ongoing  project. The  guidelines  include methodologies  for the \ncredit  appraisal,  pricing,  terms  and  conditions,  and  financial  and  portfolio  management  and \nmonitoring of MFIs\u2019 microenterprise finance operations, including risk management. The mobile-\nbased microenterprise financing  application\u2014pilot  tested for selected  partner  organizations  for \nactivities such as loan applications, appraisal, disbursement, and collection\u2014will be extended to \nthree more partner organizations and 10,000 additional microenterprise borrowers, of whom at \nleast  70%  are  female.  Legal  and  regulatory consultation,  application  development  or  adoption, \nguidelines and manual development, and partner organization and client training will continue. \n \n12. \ninstitutions\u2019  microenterprise  development  support \nextended. This output will enhance access to wider and upscale markets for an additional 1,000 \nmicroenterprise borrowers, at least 70% of whom are women. It will expand the identification of \nanother  three  microenterprise  products  for  potential  expansion;  and  support  microenterprise \ncluster development by assisting in quality control, branding, packaging, and marketing. Priority \nwill be given to female microenterprise borrowers. In addition, this output will extend the support \ninitiated in the ongoing project for linking microenterprises to e-commerce platforms. \n \nC. \n \nThe  proposed  project  will  alleviate  the  financing  needs  of  at  least  30,000  COVID-19 \n13. \naffected  microenterprises  by  providing  cheaper  financing  terms.  On  ADB\u2019s  request,  the \ngovernment and the PKSF have agreed to reduce the onlending rate by at least 25% (from the \ncurrent 24% to a maximum of 18% per year). The loan will help the PKSF to leverage $35 million \n\nOutput  3:  Microfinance \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n \n\n14  IFC.  2016.  Study  on  Mapping  the  Market  Potential  and  Accelerating  Finance  for  Women  Entrepreneurs  in \nBangladesh estimates that women entrepreneurs own only 7.2% of the 8 million enterprises in Bangladesh (of which \n99.9% are small and micro). \n\n15 Criteria for the selection of COVID-19 affected microenterprises will be (i) microenterprises in small manufacturing, \nagriculture, fisheries, and livestock whose average operating capital decreased by 10% or more from pre-March 2020 \nlevels  between 30  March  and  30  June  2020;  or  (ii)  microenterprises in  the services  sector  whose  average sales \ndecreased by 20% or more from pre-March levels between 30 March and 30 June 2020. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\ffrom commercial banks, $50 million from client savings, and $35 million from cumulative surplus \nand  equity  of  partner  organizations.  At  least  Tk5  billion  of  the  PKSF\u2019s  microenterprise  loans \noutstanding  will  be for  COVID-19  affected microenterprises.  The  additional  financing  will  inject \nliquidity into the rural economy; and help retain businesses and jobs for microenterprises. At least \n70% of microenterprise borrowers will be female, and 90,000 jobs will be protected or created. \nADB  financing  will  be  used  for  agriculture,  fisheries,  livestock,  small  manufacturing,  food \nprocessing,  services,  and  trading,  which  are  badly  affected  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  The \ndevelopment of clusters could also help firms in the regional value chain to address supply chain \ndisruptions caused by the pandemic.

The full due diligence assessments are accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Due Diligence Assessments \n\nArea of \nAssessment \nTechnical  \n\nEconomic and \nfinancial viability \n\nSummary of Assessment \n\nADB assessed the selected partner organizations\u2019 technical capacity to make microenterprise \nloans. Partner organizations have established procedures for loan appraisal, loan sanction, and \nportfolio monitoring and reporting for microenterprise loans. To support further improvement in \nMFI  capacity  for  microenterprise  financing,  the  project  will  continue  to  build capacities  in  the \nPKSF and its partner organizations through the ongoing TA.   \nMicroenterprises, which typically have short cash cycles, were severely affected by supply chain \ndisruptions and weakening demand caused by the nationwide lockdown aimed at containing \n\n16 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nArea of \nAssessment \n\nSustainability \n\nGovernance \n\nPoverty, social, \nand gender  \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\nSummary of Assessment \n\nthe  COVID-19  pandemic.  The  project  will  directly benefit  at least  70,000 microenterprises  in \nBangladesh,  of  which  70%  are  female  borrowers,  by  providing  a  reliable  and  affordable \ninstitutional source of finance. In doing so, the project greatly reduces the beneficiaries\u2019 fund \ncosts and promotes the efficient allocation of finance, thus yielding a higher rate of return to the \nbeneficiaries\u2019 microenterprise investments. \nThe project is expected to enhance the sustainability of the PKSF\u2019s operations, both financially \nand  institutionally.  The  ADB  loan  will  provide  a  credit  line  to  sustain  PKSF\u2019s  funding  to \nmicroenterprises, and the ongoing TA will provide institutional strengthening to help the PKSF \nexpand and sustain its operations. ADB\u2019s long term funds will help the PKSF mobilize greater \nprivate sector finance to support sectors affected by COVID-19 by protecting and creating jobs.  \nADB  requirements  and  policies  on  financial  management  and  procurement  measures,  and \nenvironmental and social safeguards, were discussed and agreed with the government and the \nPKSF and incorporated in the project design. The specific requirements are described in the \nPAM.a Procurement will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to \ntime)  and  the  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017, as  amended  from  time to \ntime). Procurement will be undertaken by the individual beneficiary; fitness for purpose can be \nachieved by using established private sector and commercial practices. \nThe financial management risk is moderate. Based on financial due diligence, the PKSF needs \nto  strengthen  its  capacity\u2014particularly  its  management  information  system.  The  financial \nmanagement  assessment,  which  includes  a  financial  analysis  of  partner  organizations, \nindicated  that  the  PKSF  has sufficient  experience in  managing  similar  projects  for  ADB  and \nother  international  development  partners  and  has  the  necessary  financial  management \narrangements.  The  capacity  of  the  PKSF\u2019s  partner  organizations  will  continue  to  be \nstrengthened under the ongoing TA to improve the quality of their audit and financial statements, \nand portfolio management practices.  \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with \nthe government and the PKSF. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM.a \nThe  project  will  support  microenterprises  that  can  be  key  drivers  of  rural  growth  and \nemployment.  The  development  of  microenterprises  fosters  growth  through  forward  linkages, \npromotes product markets, and contributes to poverty alleviation by creating and protecting self- \nand wage-employment opportunities, which can significantly mitigate the impact of the COVID-\n19 pandemic. The ongoing project has already created more than 90,000 jobs. The estimated \nmonthly income of microenterprise workers in manufacturing, processing, or services ranges \nfrom  Tk4,000  for  part-time  workers  to  Tk15,000  for  full-time  workers.  Considering  that \nBangladesh\u2019s annual per capita gross national income in FY2017 was Tk127,401, the project is \nexpected to contribute to poverty reduction by increasing rural household incomes. The project \nhas a strong focus on developing women-led microenterprises and will develop MFI capacity in \nconducting women-focused microenterprise financing. It is classified gender equity as a theme.b \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009). \nEnvironment  (category  FI  treated  as  C).  The  project  is  expected  to  have  a  minimal \nenvironmental  impact  since  sub-loans  to  microenterprises  will  be  mainly  for  agriculture, \nfisheries, livestock, small manufacturing, food processing, services, and trade.c \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  FI  treated  as  C).  Only  sub-loans  not  requiring  any \ninvoluntary resettlement will be financed.c  \nTribes, minor races, ethnic sects, and communities (category FI treated as C). Sub-loans \nare  for  activities  that  will  not  have  any  impact  on  tribes,  minor  races,  ethnic  sects,  and \ncommunities.    \nThe  PKSF  has  developed  environmental  and  social  screening  guidelines  for  partner \norganizations,  which  were  agreed  by  ADB.  Subproject  screening  will  be  mandatory  for \nimplementation  by  all  partner  organizations  to  be  financed  under  the  project,  and  partner \norganizations will report on the status of the screening checklist to ADB through the PKSF. The \npartner  organizations  will  screen  all  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  project  to  ensure \nthe  PAM,a  and \ncompliance  with  government  regulations,  project \nenvironmental and social screening guidelines; and exclude all subprojects with category A and \ncategory B impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and tribes, minor races, ethnic \nsects and communities; and finance only subprojects that are classified category C. \n\nlegal  agreements, \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  COVID-19  =  coronavirus  disease,  MFI  =  microfinance  institution,  PAM  =  project \nadministration manual, PKSF = Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation, TA = technical assistance. \na    Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fb    Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nc    Financial  Intermediary:  Environmental  and  Social  Management  System Arrangement  (accessible  from  the list  of \n\nSummary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nB. \n \n20. \nassessed and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.17 \n \n\nThere are no high or substantial risks to this project.
