The \ndesign and monitoring framework for the investment program is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nStrategic  context. Uzbekistan is a key transit point for Central Asian countries looking \nto trade among themselves, as well as with the rest of Asia and Europe. CAREC has a strategy \nand  action  plan  to  develop  six  transport  corridors,  which  will  improve  connectivity  and  cut \ntransport costs.1  \n\ntargets \n\nThe  proposed \n\ninvestment  program \n\n \n3. \nthe  Uzbekistan  section  of  CAREC \nCorridor 2\u2014the  A380  highway,  which  connects  Uzbekistan  to  Afghanistan,  Kazakhstan,  the \nKyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  and  Turkmenistan.  Another  highway  investment  now  under \npreparation  in  Kazakhstan  (supported  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  [ADB])  will  connect \nBeyneu (a town on the border with Uzbekistan) with Uzbekistan\u2019s A380 highway and the port of \nAktau  in  the  Caspian  Sea.  The  two  highways,  when  completed,  will  provide  Uzbekistan  and \nother  Central  Asian  countries  direct  access  to  the  Caspian  Sea,  and  thereafter  to  South  Asia \nand  the  Black  Sea  (via  road  corridors  being  built  in  Armenia,  Azerbaijan,  and  Georgia).  The \ninvestment  program  has  strong  links  to  CAREC  Corridor  6,  which  reaches  the  so-called  Ring \nRoad in Afghanistan and thereafter the main ports in Pakistan and Iran.    \n \nRoad sector. Railways used to dominate the freight market, but their market share has \n4. \nfallen  from  90%  in  1997  to  57%  in  2009.  Increased  motorization,  a  greater  number  of  private \nroad  hauling  companies,  and  shorter  transport  hauls  of  manufactured  goods  have  lifted  road \nfreight traffic. In 2009, roads accounted for 43% of Uzbekistan\u2019s freight by ton-kilometers (km) \nand  81%  of  its  passengers  by  passenger-km.  This  market  share  is  likely  to  continue  to  grow, \nespecially in the case of general cargo. Railways will retain the main market share in the case of \nbulk and long distance freight. Passenger traffic will grow, but this requires investments in high-\nspeed train facilities. Some of these are under consideration. \n \n5. \nUzbekistan\u2019s  183,000  km  road  network  comprises  43,000  km  of  primary  roads  and \n140,000 km of urban, rural, and other roads. A road sector strategy and road map is in place, \nwhich  prioritizes  the  1,200  km  A380  highway.  The  adjoining  road  in  Kazakhstan  (between \nBeyneu  and  Aktau)  will  add  impetus  to  regional  connectivity  and  increase  the  viability  of  the \ninvestment program road.  \n \nA  National  Road  Development  Program  for  2009\u20132014 2  has  been  prepared.  It  is \n6. \nconsistent with the sector strategy and road map and is estimated to cost $2.6 billion\u2014of which \n$1.6  billion  is  directed  at  the  A380  highway.  The  investment  program  will  contribute  to  this \nprogram.  Other  investments  cover  rural  and  urban  roads.  The  investment  involves  mainly  the \nreconstruction  of  existing  networks,  although  some  green  field  projects  are  also  envisaged. \nOther  \u201csofter\u201d  infrastructure  investments  are  also  part  of  the  plan,  including  improving \ninstitutional  effectiveness,  planning,  project  management,  asset  management,  maintenance, \ncross-border arrangements and facilities, customs clearance procedures and systems including \nthe single window concept, and border point modernization.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2008. CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy and Action Plan. Manila. \n2   Resolution of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan PP-1103 dated 22 April 2009. \n\n\f2 \n\nRoad funding and sustainability. Uzbekistan spends 1% of its gross domestic product \n7. \non  the  road  sector.  This  remains  low  by  international  standards  but  it  has  been  gradually \nincreasing. 3  The  general  idea  is  to  bring  funding  to  international  levels  or  higher.  The \nRepublican Road Fund (Road Fund) was established under the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for \nthis  purpose,  particularly  to  deal  with  capital  investment  and  maintenance  for  common  use \nroads.4 The Road Fund is responsible for up to 25% of all the financing directed at all networks. \nAlthough  the  Road  Fund  has  increased  its  income  by  about  10%  annually  in  the last  5  years, \nthe  investment  needs  are  higher.  This  requires  tapping  alternative  financing  sources,  and \nestablishing partnerships with the private sector. Other measures include introducing road user \ncharges.  Fuel  price  has  been  earmarked  to  finance  rural  and  urban  roads  development  and \nmaintenance. \n \nPhysical  and  nonphysical  barriers.  Uzbekistan  has  increased  road  investments  and \n8. \nintroduced sector reforms, but more work is needed on both. With regard to reforms, since 2003 \nvarious actions have been taken in several areas: (i) separating road transport operations from \nroad construction, (ii) creating the Road Fund as a quasi-independent body, and (iii) promoting \ncompetitive  bidding  for  all  road  construction  works.  The  government  has  also  restructured \nUzavtoyul  (the  sole  nationwide  road  agency),  converting  it to  a state joint  stock  company  with \nclear performance and accountability targets.5 A law on automobile road enacted in 2007 now \nallows  private  sector  financing  for  highway  construction.  A  state-owned  road  equipment  pool \ncompany  created  under  the  ADB  loan  for  CAREC  Regional  Road  Project  now  services  all \ncontractors.6  \n\n \n9. \nUzbekistan  has  a  road  sector  policy  framework  that  supports  good  governance  and \naccountability,  improved  road  sustainability,  road  safety,  and  seamless  transport  logistics  as \nwell as greater private sector investment and sound road maintenance. Minimizing the cost of \nlogistics  and  improving  trade  competitiveness  requires  the  dismantling  of  several  tariff  and \nnontariff barriers. Improving cross-border facilities will lessen delays.  \n \nRelevance and strategic alignment. The proposed investment program fits with ADB\u2019s \n10. \nStrategy  2020,7 the  country  strategy  and  program  2006\u20132010  for  Uzbekistan,8 and  the  draft \ncountry  operations  business  plan  (2010\u20132011).  The  proposal  is  aligned  to  the  Uzbekistan \nTransport  Sector  Strategy  (2006\u20132020)9 and  road  map,  as  well  as  the  CAREC  Transport  and \nTrade Facilitation Strategy and Action Plan (footnote 1).  \n\n \n11. \nFinancing  modality.  The  MFF  is  the  modality  of  choice  for  the  proposed  investment \nprogram. It follows recommendations from past operations to engage with the government over \na longer time horizon, and allows ADB to enter into a partnership.10 All the conditions for its use \n                                                 \n3  The figure of 1% is an estimate based on the average expenditure per km for the network under the purview of the \nRoad  Fund.  The  corresponding  shares  are  Viet  Nam  2.5%  (2008);  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  2.3%  (2006); \nThailand 1.8% (2006); and the Philippines (2008) below 1.0%, lower than the share of Uzbekistan. \n\n4  The  Republican  Road  Fund  is  a  quasi-independent  agency  under  the  auspices  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance \nresponsible for programming, planning, and budgeting of the common use roads comprising international, national, \nand local roads. \n\n5   Decree  of  the  President  of  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  UP-3292  dated  19  August  2003  on  improvement  of  the \n\nmanagement system for construction and operation of common use roads. \n\n6   ADB.  2007.

Other  modalities  were  considered  and  discarded.  A  straight \npolicy  loan  cannot  handle  reforms  as  easily  as  physical  investments;  a  development  program \nloan can combine reforms with investments but the investments generally tend to be small and \nover shorter periods; a stand-alone project loan does not ensure continuity or a partnership. A \nsector loan fits better with smaller and more repetitive investments.   \n \nB. \n \nThe  proposed  investment  program  will  have  an  impact  on  sustainable  economic \n12. \ndevelopment. The outcome will be better transport connectivity and efficiency, and institutional \neffectiveness.  \n \nC. \n \n13. \nPhysical and nonphysical. The outputs will be an approximately 222 km reconstructed \nroad section of the A380 highway, and improved planning, project management, logistics, road \nasset  management,  and  community  facilities.  The  investment  will  be  split  into  three  separate \nprojects.  \n \n14. \n \n\nProject 1  \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nRoad development. In the first phase, the output will be an approximately 50 km \nreconstructed  section  of  the  A380  highway  (between  Km440  and  Km490).  This \nsection does not involve land acquisition or involuntary resettlement, nor lead to \nsignificant  environmental  impacts.  The  investment  will  convert  the  existing  road \nsection into a four-lane international design road within the existing right-of-way. \nThe  cost  includes  civil  works  and  specialized  consulting  services,  including \nexperts  to  help  with  (a) procurement,  environment,  and  social  safeguards;  (b) \nconstruction supervision; and (c) due diligence for subsequent tranches. \n\nRoad sector sustainability. The following outputs are envisaged: \n(a) \n\nRoad  asset  management.  The  output  of  this  program  will  be  an \nexpanded road asset management system first introduced under an ADB-\nfunded  transport  project  (footnote  6).  It  will  finish  implementation  of  the \nsystem and finance the acquisition of certain facilities such as computers, \nsoftware,  and  automatic  traffic  counting  devices.  It  will  also  fund  a \nspecialized training program. It will set up an independent quality control \nsystem  for  civil  works  and  improve  road  maintenance  contracts.  The \nprogram will also look into new road financing modalities and the use of \npublic\u2013private initiatives.  \nCommunity  development.  This  part  of  the  program  will  focus  on  local \ncommunities  and  gender  support,  targeting  them  as  beneficiaries. \nSpecialized  advisory  services  will  help  define  and  execute  a  number  of \nactions.  The  output  will  be  detailed  needs  assessment  of  social  and \nhealthcare  facilities  on  villages  along  project  1  road  and  a  community \ndevelopment  and  gender  action  plan  agreed  with  the  Road  Fund \nimplemented. \n\n(b) \n\n \n\n15. \nProject 2. The outputs will be an approximately 85 km reconstructed section of the A380 \nhighway  (between  Km355  and  Km440)  and  procured  road  construction  and  maintenance \nequipment.  \n \n16. \nProject 3. The outputs will be an approximately 87 km reconstructed road section of the \nA380  highway  (between  Km315  and  Km355,  and  between  Km581  and  Km628)  and \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nstrengthened  logistics  by  improving  cross-border  facilities  and  shortening  the  cross-border \nprocessing  time.  This  project  will  also  expand  the  community  development  program  and \ninstitutional capacity. \n \nD. \n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Plan \n\n \n17. \nThe total cost of the government's investment in the A380 highway is estimated at $1.6 \nbillion  (Table  1).  ADB  is  financing  it  through  an  ongoing  loan  (footnote  6)  and  the  investment \nprogram. \n\n \nTable 1: Summary Investment Plan for the A380 Highway  \n\n \n\nTotal ($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n      CAREC Regional Road Projecta \n      Investment Program \nGovernment  \nTotal \n \nCAREC = Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation. \na  Asian Development Bank. 2007.

The  OCR  financing  will  follow  the  ordinary \noperations  loan  regulations  applicable  to  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  loans, \nsubject  to  possible  modifications  under  individual  loan  agreements.  The  ADF  financing  will \nfollow the special operations loan regulations, subject to possible modifications under individual \nloan agreements. The government will provide counterpart financing of $138 million equivalent. \nTable  3  summarizes  the  financing  plan  for  the  investment  program  and  the  expected  three \ntranches.  In  the  event  that  OCR  financing  under  the  MFF  increases  from  $240  million  to  a \nmaximum  of  $300 million,  any  additional  OCR \nfinancing  will  be  accompanied  by  a \ncorresponding reduction in the ADF financing, so that the total available amount under the MFF \nwill not exceed $600 million. \n \n\nTable 3: Summary Financing Plan\u2014Investment Program \n($ million) \n\nTotal \n\nTranche 1 \n115 \n31 \n146 \n\nTranche 2 \n240 \n49 \n289 \n\nFinancier \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nFor  project  1,  the  government  has  requested  ADF  financing  of  $115  million  equivalent \n20. \nand  has  submitted  the  PFR  to  ADB.

This includes assessing \nthe  investment  plan,  operational  cost  structure,  and  maintenance  requirements.  It  also  looked \ninto the design features. The road will carry heavy vehicles\u2014from within and outside Uzbekistan. \nThe  approach  is  to  widen  the  existing  two-lane  asphalt  concrete  road  into  a  four-lane  divided \ncement concrete road. Projects 1 and 2 sections will follow the existing right-of-way. Project 3 \nsections need a new road alignment.  \n \n26. \nRoad traffic is expected to grow by 10% annually and reach 20,000 passengers car units \ndaily by 2039. The reconstructed and expanded network can accommodate this traffic, including \ngrowing intercity traffic, but this flow of traffic also requires improved road safety measures. Best \npractice standards will be adopted for this purpose. \n \n27. \nThe civil works will replace the existing asphalt concrete with cement concrete pavement. \nAlthough  the  initial  investment  cost  based  on  cement  concrete  is  higher  than  that  based  on \nasphalt  concrete,  this  will  be  offset  later  by  lower  annual  maintenance  costs.  The  detailed \ndesign work for the road section under project 1 has already been completed. ADB evaluated \nthis  work  and  found  it  to  be  acceptable.  Design  work  for  sections  under  projects  2  and  3  is \nunder  way.  The  State  Committee  for  Architecture  and  Construction  verified  and  approved  the \ncost estimates and the design features. The investment program is ready for implementation. \n \nB. \n \n28. \nThe  investment  proposal  benefits  Uzbekistan  as  well  as  its  neighbors.  Investments  of \nthis  nature  have  high  spillover  effect.  Other  benefits  include  better,  safer,  cheaper,  and  faster \nconnectivity. Better connectivity means lower transport costs and greater trade competitiveness, \nwhich  translates  into  more  investments  and  jobs.  The  road  opens  up  opportunity  but  also \naccess  to  it.  There  are  substantial  social  benefits,  including  better  access  to  health  and \neducation  facilities.  The  main  beneficiaries  include  people  and  local  businesses,  traders, \nneighboring  countries,  and  Uzbekistan  communities  living  along  the  corridor.  The  logistics \nindustry will also benefit. The same applies to farmer communities and manufacturers. The link \nto Kazakhstan and the construction of a road from Beyneu to Aktau delivers substantial spillover \nbenefits to both countries. This new corridor will give Uzbekistan and Central Asia direct access \nto the Caspian Sea. For a double landlocked country like Uzbekistan, this is a real feat. When \ncompleted,  this  will  become  a  flagship  corridor  under  CAREC.  The  investment  program\u2019s \neconomic rate of return (EIRR) is 16%. \n \n29. \nProject 1 investments are also economically viable, with  an  EIRR  of  17%.  A  sensitivity \nanalysis  assessed  the  impact  of  different  benefit  and  cost  scenarios.  Under  a  worst  case \nscenario, with traffic 20% lower and construction costs 20% higher (compared to the baseline), \nproject  1  still  yields  an  EIRR  of  13%.  The  combined  effect  of  excluding  generated  traffic  and \nignoring traffic accident savings results in an EIRR of about 15%.  \n \nC. \n \n30. \nThe  due  diligence  work  analyzed  the  financial  management  aspects  and  maintenance \nrequirements and capabilities. Current traffic on the road is 1,000 vehicles daily. This is not high \nenough  to  attract  private  investors.  However,  over  time,  some  sections  could  be  spun  off  to \nprivate operators, especially around big cities and industrial zones like Navoi. A public\u2013private \npartnership framework will be used to tap into private sector investment. The due diligence work \n\nFinancial \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nalso  revealed  sound  financial  management  systems  at  the  Road  Fund  level.  The  Road  Fund \nhas sound systems and procedures, and clear accountability lines.  \n \n31. \nThe Road Fund has resources for road maintenance. It has been receiving an increasing \nbudget  allocation  from  the  government  every  year.  This  will  increase  in  future  in  line  with \nnational tax collections. The allocation will be inflation-proof. This will help maintain revenues at \nreasonable  levels  to  help  sustain  the  investments.  Generally,  countries  with  road  funds  spend \nabout 0.3% of their income on road maintenance. Uzbekistan falls below this now but intends to \ndo better in future. Uzavtoyul will maintain the road. \n\n \nGovernance \n\ntackling  what  are  still  weak  country-level  public \n\nD. \n \n32. \nA  governance  assessment  was  undertaken  as  part  of  the  due  diligence  process.  This \nfocused  on  the  legal  framework,  regulation,  strength  of  enforcement  regimes,  capacity  of  the \nRoad Fund, human resources, and the risk of corruption.  \n \nThe  country\u2019s  performance  on  governance  has  been  lacking  in  some  areas, 13  but \n33. \nprogressing steadily. The legal frameworks for managing public finances have been tightened. \nThe Budget System Law and Treasury Law, approved on 17 December 2007, provide additional \ncover and better practices in this area. The public expenditure reform process covering 2007\u2013\n2018  includes  measures  to  increase  efficiency,  accountability,  and  transparency. 14  These \nfinancial  management \nreforms  are \narrangements,  particularly  with  regard  to  budget  execution.  A  major  issue  is  the  public \nprocurement  process  and  the  issue  of  price  verification  for  all  foreign-funded  contracts  and \ncontract  variations.  The  proposed  investment  will  be  subjected  to  international  competitive \nbidding.  This  increases  oversight  and  helps  mitigate  corruption.  The  verification  contributes  to \ngood  governance,  but  sometimes  creates  project  implementation  delays.  ADB  and  the \ngovernment have agreed actions to reduce these delays through the sharing of databases and \nother information on cost estimates and sources well in advance of loan negotiations.     \n \n34. \nThe  governance  assessment  highlights  a  number  of  risks  areas.  These  and  the \nmitigation  actions  are  summarized  in  the  risk  mitigation  plan  attached  to  the  investment \nprogram. Specifically, the Road Fund will need to improve further its systems and transparency \nby including in its webpage and the MOF website, information on its performance, the status of \neach  contract  under  the  investment  program,  the  specific  list  of  business  opportunities,  and  a \nsummary  of  the  bidding  process  and  its  guidelines.  This  would  be  a  major  breakthrough  on \npublic  disclosure.  It  was  agreed  that  an  international  procurement  specialist  will  be  hired  to \nassist  with  the  procurement  work  related  to  civil  works,  goods,  and  services.  An  independent \nauditor will also be appointed.  \n \n35. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith MOF and the Road Fund. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the FAM. There is total clarity about the content of the policy, how it needs to \nbe applied, and courses of action in case of any infringement.   \n \n\n                                                 \n13 D.

Report and Recommendation of the President: Proposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grant to the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan for the Public Finance Management Reform Project. Manila (Loan 2338-UZB) will support \nthe establishment of a single treasury account and improvement of the general financial management information \nSystem.  The  TA  grant  for  Supporting  Public  Finance  Management  Reform  (TA  4946-UZB)  reformed  the  public \nfinancial management system. \n\n\fPoverty and Social \n\nE. \n \n36. \nThe proposed investment program is not a targeted intervention. It does not specifically \naddress poverty reduction through standard direct actions at the level of households, or involve \nspecific services that deal with the geographical determinants of poverty. The proposal will not \nexacerbate gender inequities. However, highway construction and the development of long-term \ntransit routes increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections. This risk is taken seriously by \nthe Government and a mitigation plan has been agreed with ADB. During the execution phase \nof the investment program, these actions will be reflected in the contractors\u2019 contracts. A well-\ndefined program on targeted awareness and preventive actions will also be prepared.  \n \n37. \nCommunities  living  in  villages  along  a  major  highway  are  often  neglected  when  a \nhighway is reconstructed. The Road Fund is aware of the risk and has prepared a community \nand gender action plan. Although it is not a classical mainstreaming gender activity, the action \nplan  has  some  direct  gender  benefits\u2014including  improving  mobility,  job  opportunities,  and \naccess to health in the cities/villages along the route. This plan will be executed under projects 1 \nand  3  of  the  investment  program.  Further  needs  assessments  are  required,  which  will  be \nconducted during project 1.  \n \nF. \n \n38. \nProject 1 does not have any major environmental impacts. In line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement,15 project 1 is classified environment category B. The Road Fund has prepared \nan  initial  environmental  examination  for  project 1  and  an  environment  assessment  and  review \nframework for the investment program. All this work has been disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. The \ninvestments  will  not  result  in  environmental  impacts  of  a  regional  or  international  nature.  Civil \nworks under project 1 do not involve land acquisition, involuntary resettlement, or affect ethnic \nminority  groups.  Project  1  is  classified  category  C  for  the  purposes  of  social  safeguards.  Civil \nworks under the subsequent projects may involve land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. \nThe  Road  Fund  has  prepared  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  and  an  ethnic \nminority  planning  framework.  These  are  also  available  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  The  Road  Fund  will \nprepare  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  for  the  future  projects,  as  applicable.  The \nprogram  is  not  expected  to  negatively  affect  people  fitting  ADB\u2019s  definition  of  indigenous \npeoples  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  A  safeguard  team  comprising  experts  on \nenvironment and social safeguards will support the PMU. \n\nSafeguards \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nG. \n \n39. \nTable  6  summarizes  major  risks  and  mitigating  measures.  This  risk  profile  focuses \nmainly  on  road  sustainability.  Broader  risks  include  cross-border  performance  and  changed \nmacroeconomic conditions. Without efficient border points, trade costs increase and trade flows \nsuffer.  This ultimately  affects  the  viability  of  any  road  corridor.  The  government  has  agreed  to \ntake  actions  in  this  area  to  mitigate  such  risk.  Cross-border  point  investments  are  part  of  the \npackage and will affect all borders in all the CAREC countries. ADB intends to support this work \nthrough  a  regional  program  focusing  on  single  windows  and  customs  modernization.  Macro \nstability  seems  assured.  Uzbekistan  has  not  been  particularly  affected  by  the  global  financial \ncrisis. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n15  ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement.
