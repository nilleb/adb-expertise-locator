It  will  involve  (i) devoting  four  or  more  tranches  of  the \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to improving compliance with \nthe safety and security standards of the International Civil Aviation \nOrganization; (ii) designing and supervising airport improvements, \nand preparing and administering long-term maintenance contracts \nfor all the national airports; and (iii) monitoring the socioeconomic \nbenefits from the operating and maintenance improvements in the \nnational  airports.  The  investment  program  will  also  work  closely \nwith  the  capacity  building  program  under  the  Transport  Sector \nSupport  Program \nfor \nInternational Development. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  MFF  is  the  most  suitable \nmode  of  financing  for  the  investment  program  because  it \n(i) supports the Government\u2019s long-term vision for the civil aviation \nsector,  as  outlined  in  the  current  plans  of  the  Civil  Aviation \nAuthority \nlong-term \npartnership  in  building  institutional  capacity;  (iii) allows  ADB  to \nstrengthen  and  improve  the  CAA\u2019s  long-term  strategic  plans  and \nto  actively  pursue  policy  dialogue  throughout  the  investment \nprogram; (iv) allows the lessons of early tranches to be applied in \nsubsequent  tranches,  and  reforms  to  be  implemented  and \nefficiency to improve with the help of incentives; and (v) provides \ncertainty  to  private  companies  interested  in  pursuing  long-term \nopportunities in the civil aviation sector. \n \nCivil  aviation  (i) supports  the  socioeconomic  development  of  the \ncountry  by  providing  safe,  efficient,  reliable,  sustainable,  and \naffordable  aviation  services  and \n(ii)  gives \nall-weather  access  to  the  country  and  increases  the  mobility  of \n\nthe  Australian  Agency \n\n(ii) enables  ADB \n\nto  sustain  a \n\ninfrastructure; \n\n(CAA); \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nInvestment Program \nDescription \n\n \nMultitranche Financing \nFacility \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fii \n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nInvestment Plan \n\ncommunities;  and  (iii)  serves  important  community  needs  by \nmaking  noncommercial  destinations  more  accessible.  Capacity \nconstraints and deteriorating infrastructure, however, threaten the \nsafety certification of the airports and place these socioeconomic \nobjectives at risk. The CAA\u2019s well-articulated sector development \nplan  (Civil  Aviation  Authority.  2008.  Strategic  Investment  Plan. \nPort Moresby) addresses the risks, but the agency needs help in \ncarrying out the plan and meeting obligations. External funding to \nrehabilitate  and  upgrade  the  national  airports  will  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Medium Term  Development  Strategy \n(MTDS) \nobjectives  of  economic  growth,  rural  development,  poverty \nreduction, and human resource development. \n \nThe investment program will establish a sustainable civil aviation \nnetwork  to  support  economic  growth  (program  impact).  In  that \nway, it will help meet the objectives of ADB\u2019s country strategy and \nprogram, particularly those for the transport sector, and the stated \nMTDS  objectives  of  (i) economic  growth,  (ii) rural  development, \n(iii) poverty reduction, and (iv) human resource development. The \nintended outcome is safer, more efficient, and more accessible air \ntransport  services  in  the  project  areas  through  (i) safer  and \nmore-secure \nfacilities; \n(iii) more-accessible  markets,  natural  resource  and  mineral  sites, \nand livelihood opportunities; and (iv) reduced costs of air travel to \nall project areas.  \n \nThe total cost of the investment program (including the anticipated \npublic\u2013private partnership for the international airport) is estimated \nat $640.0 million equivalent. Project 1 will comprise improvements \nin  the  Jackson\u2019s  Domestic  Airport  in  Port  Moresby  (restricted  to \nthe extension of the domestic parking apron) and in the airports in \nMount Hagen, Wewak, Hoskins, and Gurney. New security fences \nwill  also  be  built  at  Goroka  and  Kavieng.  Project  1,  including \ntaxes, duties, physical and price contingencies, interest, and other \ncharges, is expected to cost about $112.0 million equivalent. \n\n(ii) better \n\nairport \n\ntravel; \n\nair \n\n\fiii \n \n\nTable 1: Investment Program and Project 1 Investment Plan\n($ million) \n\nTotal \n\nSubtotal  \n\nAmount \n  \n\n1.

The  funding  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Innovation \nand  Efficiency \nInstruments  and \nInitiative:  Pilot  Financing \nModalities  (2005),  and  will  come  primarily  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources  (subject  to  availability)  and  ordinary  capital \nresources \nloans, \nconditional  on  the  Government\u2019s  submission  of  the  related \n\n(OCR).  The  MFF  will  comprise  several \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nMultitranche Financing \nFacility: Amount and \nTerms \n\n\fiv \n \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n\n \nEstimated Program \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\nthe  related \n\nfinancing  requests,  execution  of \n\nloan \nperiodic \nagreements,  and  fulfillment  of  the  terms  and  conditions  and \nunderstandings  set  forth  in  its  financing  framework  agreement \nwith  ADB.  The  investment  program  will  be  implemented  over  9 \nyears.  The  OCR  funding  will  be  covered  by  Ordinary  Operations \nLoan  Regulations  applicable  to  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)\u2013based  loans,  and  the  funding  from  Special  Funds \nresources  by  the  Special  Operations  Loan  Regulations.  In  both \ncases,  any  modifications  introduced  under  the  individual  loan \nagreements  will  apply.  The  Government  will  provide  counterpart \nfunds  of  $85.0  million  equivalent.  For  project 1,  the  borrower  will \nbe Papua New Guinea. \n \nFor  project  1,  the  first  tranche  will  combine  three  loans  totaling \nabout  $95  million  equivalent\u2014an  OCR  loan  of  about  $25 million \nand  two  loans  from  Special  Funds  resources  totaling  $70 million \nequivalent (a \u201chard-term\u201d Asian Development Fund [ADF] loan of \n$20 million  equivalent  and  a  \u201csoft-term\u201d  ADF  loan  of  about \n$50 million equivalent). The ADB loans will cover 85% of the cost \nof project 1. The first periodic financing request will be presented \nto  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  together  with  the  signed  financing \nframework  agreement.  The  Government  will  fund  the  remaining \n$17.0 million equivalent, including local taxes and duties. \n \nThe loan utilization period will be 9 years, from 2010 to 2018, and \nthe  last  periodic  financing  request  must  be  submitted  by  2013. \nEach  specific  loan  will  have  its  own  closing  date  to  match  its \nimplementation period. \n\n31 December 2018 \n\n \nCivil Aviation Authority \n \nThe CAA will be the executing agency and will be responsible for \nimplementing  the  civil  aviation  infrastructure  works  and  the \ninstitutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  programs  under \nthe  investment  program.  A  program  steering  committee  will \noversee  the  implementation  of  the  investment  program,  monitor \nprogress,  approve  the  airports  chosen  for  subsequent  projects, \nand  guide  the  executing  agency  and  the  implementing  agencies. \nA  project  implementation  unit  (PIU),  headed  by  the  Project \nDirector\u2013ADB  Project  (already  appointed)  and  supported  by \ninvestment  program  consultants,  will  be \nfor \nimplementing  the  sector  policy  and  infrastructure  components  of \nthe  investment  program.  The  PIU  will  hire  all  consultants  and \nenter into all airport improvement contracts under the investment \nprogram.  \n \nAll procurement to be financed under an ADB loan will conform to \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \n\nresponsible \n\n\fv \n \n\nand \n\nsocial \n\nfinancial, \n\ndimensioning \n\ntime).  All  contracts  over  $3  million  for  civil  works  and  over \n$0.5 million  for  goods  will  undergo  international  competitive \nbidding. Contracts below these thresholds will go through national \ncompetitive  bidding  and,  as  appropriate,  minor  contracts  under \n$100,000 will be awarded through shopping. Advance contracting \nand  retroactive  financing  will  be  used  for  survey  works,  including \ngeotechnical and other studies for the preparation of subsequent \nsubprojects.  \n \nInternational and national consultants will be hired for engineering \ndesign,  civil  works  supervision,  capacity  building,  advisory \nservices,  and  studies  as  appropriate.  They  will  be  recruited \nthrough  quality-  and  cost-based  selection,  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime to time). A consulting firm will be hired to provide construction \nsupervision  and  individual  consultants  to  serve  as  PIU  advisers. \nAdvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  used  for \nproject  analysts  participating  in  pre-feasibility  work,  including \nsurveys, \neconomic, \nenvironmental,  and  engineering  design  studies  in  preparation  for \nsubsequent subprojects. \n \nAlthough  a  majority  of  the  population  will  benefit  from  having \naccess to air transportation, the traveling public using the airports \nincluded  in  project  1  will  be  the  immediate  beneficiaries.  Safer \nairports  and  more-available,  more-frequent,  more-reliable,  and \nlower-cost  transport  services  will  benefit  the  airlines  and  the \ntraveling  public  who  rely  on  them,  and  increase  travel  to  the \nproject  areas.  The  economic  benefits  foreseen  from  safer  and \nbetter-maintained \neconomic \nare: \nopportunities, higher production, and more direct sales as a result \nof better access to regional markets and towns; (ii) more sales for \nmarket  vendors  because  of  the  increase  in  customers;  (iii) better \nbusiness  for  trade  store  and  industrial  enterprises;  and  (iv)  more \nopportunities  to  create  and  expand  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises.  The  anticipated  social  benefits  are:  (i) increased \nagricultural  sales  through  the  upgrading  of  markets  near  airport \nsites,  (ii) more  job  opportunities  through  required  civil  works, \n(iii) higher  school  enrollments  and  better  access  to  health  care \nthrough increased household incomes, and (iv) more opportunities \nto diversify and expand industrial and agricultural production. The \neconomic internal rate of return for project 1 is about 45%. \n \nThe major risks and assumptions are as follows. \n \nShortage of civil works contractors. The implementation of the \nproposed airport infrastructure works will be affected by the lack of \ncapable international and national contractors. The Government is \nfully  aware  of  the  issues  and  is  responding  by  (i)  ensuring  the \nsafety  of \nthe  provincial \ngovernments,  (ii)  improving  the  licensing  and  classification  of \n\ninternational  contractors \n\n(i) more-varied \n\nthrough \n\nairports \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nInvestment Program \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n\fvi \n \n\n \n\nnational  contractors,  and  (iii)  providing  opportunities  to  small  and \nmedium-sized enterprises in the construction industry. \n\nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Customary  landholding  in \nPNG  complicates  and  prolongs  the  process  of  land  acquisition. \nWhere required, the CAA will obtain the approval of communities \nfor  improvements  in  airport  infrastructure  through  memorandums \nof agreement while the formal acquisition process is fulfilled. The \ninvestment  program  will  help  the  CAA  to  carry  out  field  surveys \nand  prepare  land  acquisition  documents  for  all  the  airports \ncovered  by  the  program,  to  enable  the  agency  to  pay  for  and \nacquire property for immediate use. \n\n \n\n \n\nSecurity. Security in Papua New Guinea continues to be an issue \nwith  contractors  working  on  ongoing  infrastructure  projects, \nincluding  roads.  The  CAA,  with  the  support  of  the  provincial \ngovernments, must deal with this issue. \n \nInstitutional  capacity.  The  investment  program  needs  good \ninstitutions. Strong management and governance, good planning, \nbest-practice  concepts,  sound  project  management,  fiduciary \noversight,  and  transparent  bidding  and  contract  management \nrequire not only experienced personnel but also efficient systems \nand procedures and controls. \n \nFinancing.    ADB  will  provide  the  necessary  funding  for  capital \nexpenditure,  but \nlong  run  will  be \nissue \nmaintenance  and  repairs.  For  this,  there  must  be  a  recurrent \nbudget allocation. Budget allocations in the past were haphazard, \nand, in the continuing economic downturn, economic and financial \nconditions  within  and  outside  the  country  could  deteriorate, \nthereby restricting growth and development. \n\nthe  main \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n\f144  00'Eo\n\n152  00'Eo\n\nMomote\nF100\n\nLorengau\n\nMANUS\n\nB I S M A R C K       S E A\n\nNEW  IRELAND\n\nKavieng\n F100\n\nPAPUA NEW GUINEA\nCIVIL AVIATION DEVELOPMENT \nINVESTMENT PROGRAM\n\nWEST  NEW  BRITAIN\n\nHoskins\nF100\n\nKimbe\n\nKokopo\n\nTokua\nF100\n\nEAST  NEW  BRITAIN\n\nBuka\nF100\n\nAUTONOMOUS\nREGION OF\nBOUGAINVILLE\n\nArawa\n\nMOROBE\n\nS O L O M O N       S E A\n\nVanimo\n F100\n\nAitape\n\nWEST  SEPIK\n\nWewak\n F100\n\n4  00'So\n\nSepik River\n\nEAST   SEPIK\n\nWapenamanda\nDash 8\n\nENGA\n\nWESTERN\nHIGHLANDS\n\nWabag\n\nMADANG\n\nR\n\na\n\nm\n\nu River\n\nMadang\nF100\n\nKundiawa\nDash 8\nSIMBU\n\nGoroka\n   F100\n\nM\n\na\n\nr\n\nk\n\nh\n\na\n\nm\n\nEASTERN\nHIGHLANDS\n\nNadzab\n  F100\n\nRiver\n\nLae\n\nOk Tedi\n\nTari\nDash 8\n\nKiunga\nDash 8\n\nMt.

The  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  the  investment \nprogram is in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nCivil aviation supports the socioeconomic development of the country by providing safe, \nefficient,  reliable,  sustainable,  and  affordable  aviation  services  and  infrastructure  to  facilitate \naccess to the country and improve the mobility of communities. Geographic difficulties impede \nroad  connections  in  most  of  the  country,  so  PNG  relies  instead  on  aviation  for  tourism  and \nbusiness,  exports  and  imports,  domestic  freight,  and  social  cohesion.  Aviation  services  and \ninfrastructure are essential for these activities and for access to noncommercial destinations.  \n \nTwo  key  institutions  administer,  regulate,  and  manage  the  civil  aviation  sector.  The \n3. \nDepartment  of  Works,  Transport  and  Civil  Aviation  (DWTCA)  is  the  lead  agency  for  transport \nstrategy and planning, including the monitoring of international obligations, the negotiation of air \nservice  agreements,  economic  regulation,  the  investigation  of  air  accidents,  and  sector  policy \nformulation and planning. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is responsible for airports, air traffic \nmanagement, and regulatory oversight.  \n \n4. \nPNG has more than 450 aviation facilities in PNG. Of these, 21 are designated national \nairports1  owned  and  operated  by  the  CAA  on  behalf  of  the  Government.  Mostly  located  in \nprovincial  capitals,  these  national  airports  are  the  focus  of  the  proposed  investment  program. \nSeven  can  be  upgraded  to  take  larger  aircraft;  the  rest  need  major  rehabilitation  to  ensure \nsafety, security, and adequate capacity for future growth.  \n \n5. \nThree  major  airlines  and  more  than  20  other  operators  provide  international  and \ndomestic  services.  Passenger  traffic  has  recently  grown  by  about  3%  yearly  on  average,  and \nfreight demand by about 1%. Both rates are well below the growth in gross domestic product, \nwhich has averaged 6.4% in recent years.  \n \n6. \nFunding  for  the  civil  aviation  sector  comes  primarily  from  Department  of  Treasury \nappropriations. The DWTCA is funded entirely by the Government, and the CAA is funded by a \ncombination of revenues from airport and airspace fees and charges, licensing and regulatory \nfees, and annual government appropriations. An analysis of the sector is in Appendix 2. \n\n                                                 \n1   Buka,  Chimbu,  Daru,  Goroka,  Gurney,  Hoskins,  Kavieng,  Kerema,  Kiunga,  Madang,  Mendi,  Momote, \n\nMount Hagen, Nadzab (Lae), Popendetta, Port Moresby, Tari, Tokua, Vanimo, Wapenamanda, and Wewak. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n \n\n1. \n\nChallenges \n\nterminal  buildings,  equipment,  and  utilities \n\nFacilities. The national airports typically have (i) low compliance with safety and security \n7. \nstandards,  creating  risks  of  accidents  and  illegal  movements  of  people  and  goods;  (ii) air-side \npavements, \nin  poor  condition;  (iii)   swiftly \ndeteriorating pavements; and (iv)  inadequate maintenance. Air navigation systems in PNG are \nunreliable and deteriorating because of (i) old and obsolete equipment, (ii) lack of spare parts, \n(iii) theft and vandalism, (iv) unreliable power and communications, and (v) logistics problems. \n \n8. \nImpact  on  operations.  Poor  infrastructure  and  air  navigation  services  lead  to  (i) flight \ncancellations, (ii) restricted operations, (iii) higher costs to airlines because of reduced payload \nand  the  need  to  divert  flights,  and  (iv)  higher  costs  to  public  and  private  business  because  of \nflight cancellations, rescheduling, and diversions. Airlines face the risk of airport closures and, \nbecause they cannot invest in future aircraft types, may have to reduce capacity into important \ntourism and economic regions, thereby constraining economic and social development. \n \n9. \nInstitutions.  The  aviation  sector  is  facing  institutional  capacity  issues  at  many  levels. \nThe Government\u2019s aviation strategies are demanding, but it has insufficient skills and depth of \nexperience in all the delivery areas of policy and sector reforms to implement them successfully. \nThe  CAA  is  restructuring,  but  a  key  issue  in  the  transition  is  functional  capacity  to  meet \nexpected outcomes. Besides the operating units that are being created, an important aspect will \nbe divesting regulatory oversight, to eliminate conflicts of interest with operating responsibilities.  \n \n10. \nPolicy and strategy. The Government\u2019s transport policies call for (i) safety and security \nimprovements, (ii) better maintenance, (iii) upgraded national airports, (iv) an upgraded air traffic \nmanagement  system,  and  (v) sector-wide  policy  initiatives.  Coordination  and  collaboration \nbetween the policy functions of DWTCA and the business and service delivery functions of the \nrestructured CAA must improve. \n \nFinance.  To  finance  airport  compliance  and  cater  for  growth,  the  CAA  relies  on  a \n11. \ncombination  of  airport  and  airspace  fees,  licensing  and  regulatory  fees,  and  annual \nappropriations from the Government derived from its community service obligation (CSO) policy. \nHowever, the Government\u2019s competing priorities for funds and fiscal strategies have resulted in \nsignificant  underfunding  of  the  CAA  for  many  years.  Furthermore,  institutional  problems  have \nreduced  the  CAA\u2019s  own  capacity  to  fund  safety  and  security  maintenance,  upgrades  to  meet \npresent and future airport needs, and regulatory oversight of safety and security. Although the \ninternational  airport  and  a  few  others  may  recover  operating  costs,  most  national  airports  are \nnot commercially viable and are a drag on the CAA\u2019s annual financial performance and ability to \nfund investment. The CSO grants from the Government cover some of the shortfall, but the CAA \nneeds external funding to meet all of its obligations and execute its strategic plan.  \n\n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment\u2019s Strategy and Ongoing Efforts \n\n12. \nThe  Government\u2019s  transport  policies  are  the  Medium Term  Development  Strategy \n(MTDS) 2005\u20132010 and the more detailed National Transport Development Plan (NTDP) 2006\u2013\n2010.  These  documents  contain  the  overall  policies,  objectives,  and  actions  that  guide  the \ndevelopment and operation of the transport sector. Both are undergoing review, with completion \nexpected within 2009. \n\n\f3 \n\n \n13.  MTDS 2005\u20132010 has seven priorities, including the \u201crehabilitation and maintenance of \ntransport  infrastructure.\u201d  The  NTDP  2006\u20132010  vision  for  the  aviation  sector  involves \n(i) competition on domestic routes and access to these routes by foreign airlines as part of the \nlong-term upgrading plan for selected airports with international flight facilities; (ii) larger aircraft \noperating  in  major  national  airports;  (iii)  accessible,  safe,  reliable,  efficient,  and  affordable  air \ntransport;  (iv)  improved  and  reasonably  priced  international  services  to  establish  PNG  as  a \ngateway  between  continents;  and  (v)  lower-cost  and  safer  passenger  and  cargo  movements. \nThe NTDP proposes major investments at six national airports (Gurney, Madang, Mount Hagen, \nNadzab, Tokua, and Wewak) to facilitate growth and eventual competition on domestic routes. It \nalso mandates the provision of services to all national airports, and government grants to meet \nthe CAA\u2019s revenue shortfall. \n \n14. \nTo  fulfill  these  priorities,  the  Government,  through  the  National  Executive  Committee, \nhas  endorsed  the  CAA\u2019s  Infrastructure  Investment  Plan\u2013Long  Term  (2010\u20132030)  as  its  sector \nplan. Certification, rehabilitation of national airports, and upgrading of six major national airports \nwill require a total investment of K1.710 billion ($547.6 million). Details of the plan are given in \nAppendix 2. \n \n15. \nA key objective of NTDP 2006\u20132010 is to reform the CAA to become self-sufficient and \nfund  much  of  the  remedial  maintenance  of  airports  and  airways.  The  CAA  strategic  plan  is  in \nline  with  the  MTDS  and  NTDP  policies  and  priorities.  The  key  objectives  of  the  plan  are  (i) to \nattend to critical safety and security needs and implement structural reform (short term), (ii) to \nfacilitate economic and social development through sustainable aviation infrastructure (medium \nterm), and (iii) to realize an acceptable rate of return on investments (long term). \n\n \n\n3. \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s  country  assistance  strategy2  supports  the  implementation  of  MTDS 2005\u22122010 \n16. \nby  tightening  the  focus  of  ADB\u2019s  program  for  maximum  impact  in  priority  areas.  The  transport \nsector is one of four main strategic areas of ADB engagement, building on ADB\u2019s comparative \nadvantage and its long-standing relationships with other development partners. The investment \nprogram  will  draw  on  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  preparing  and  implementing  small  airport \nimprovement  projects  associated  with  regional  and  domestic  airport  development,  particularly \nwhere rugged terrain makes air travel an important mode of transport. The project is included in \nthe updated COBP 2009\u20132011.3  \n \n17. \nSince external assistance is now directed mainly at capacity development, ADB efforts \nwill center on the necessary infrastructure improvements, with targeted assistance to fill gaps in \ninstitutional development and support the restructuring of the CAA, in coordination with technical \nassistance from the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) (see para. 32). \nThe sector road map and policy framework is in Appendix 3. \n \nThe proposed investment program will cover (i) the infrastructure needed to comply with \n18. \nthe  safety  and  security  standards  of  the  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO); \n(ii) remedial maintenance on air-side pavements and infrastructure to allow national airports to \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB.  2006.

Most  external  assistance  to  PNG  so  far  has  come  from  AusAID,  which  has  funded \nstrategic  studies,  the  services  of  specialist  advisers  to  Government,  small  infrastructure \nprojects, and the procurement of equipment. About $10 million will be made available in these \nareas  over  the  next  3  years  under  AusAID\u2019s  ongoing  Transport  Sector  Support  Program \n(TSSP). There have been no significant investments in the sector from other external sources. \nADB\u2019s  current  advisory  assistance  to  the  Government  in  the  establishment  of  a  public\u2013private \npartnership framework could lead to private sector involvement at the Port Moresby international \nairport,  but  is  still  at  a  very  early  stage  and  will  not  affect  the  rest  of  the  sector  development \nplan.  \n\n \n\n5. \n\nLessons \n\nA  key  lesson  from  past  performance  in  the  sector  is  the  importance  of  maximizing  the \n20. \nrecovery  of  operating  costs,  to  allow  the  CAA  to  fund  recurrent  maintenance  costs,  avoid  the \ncostly  cycle  of  deterioration  and  rehabilitation,  and  ensure  continuous  safety  and  security \ncertification. By eliminating capacity constraints, investment can facilitate economic growth and \na commensurate increase in traffic that will allow prudent operating expenditure to help achieve \nthis objective. The restructuring of the CAA can also help to update and rationalize fees and link \nthem to the demand created by expanded services. \n \nAnother  key  lesson  is  the  importance  of  meeting  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to \n21. \nmaintain facilities that cannot achieve full commercial cost recovery but satisfy its obligations to \nthe  community.  NTDP  2006\u20132010  sets  a  target  of  75%  of  operating  costs  to  be  met  through \ngrants  to  the  CAA;  this  figure  should  gradually  reduce  as  traffic  increases  and  tariffs  (landing \nfees  and  terminal  charges)  are  reviewed  and  updated.  External  support  should  be  conditional \non  adherence  to  this  commitment,  with  appropriate  modifications  in  light  of  the  investment \nprogram.  \n \nA  third  key  lesson  is  the  importance  of  developing  efficient  and  effective  institutional \n22. \nstructures,  carefully  sequencing  their  implementation,  and  providing  long-term  support  and \ncapacity  development  in  putting  the  sector  road  map  into  effect.  The  implementation  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  policies  and  strategies  is  very  demanding  and  involves  the  successful \ncoordination of many stakeholders, but a resource gap in experienced and qualified staff in the \nCAA  is  holding  back  the  Government  from  meeting  its  objectives.  Operating  and  regulatory \nfunctions  housed  in  the  same  institution  are  also  creating  conflicts  of  interest.  Continuous \nsupport  for  institutional  development  and  for  program  monitoring  and  evaluation  through  the \ninvestment  program  (made  possible  by  the  long-term  nature  of  an  MFF)  should  be  delivered \nthrough government systems and coordinated carefully with other external assistance.  \n\n \n\n6. \n\nRationale for ADB Support \n\n23. \nProgram  rationale.  Civil  aviation  (i)  supports  the  social  and  economic  development  of \nthe  country  by  providing  safe,  efficient,  reliable,  sustainable,  and  affordable  aviation  services \n\n\f5 \n\nand  infrastructure;  (ii)  gives  all-weather  access  to  the  country  and  improves  the  mobility  of \ncommunities;  and  (iii)  provides  access  to  noncommercial  destinations,  thereby  meeting \nimportant  service  obligations  to  the  community.  Capacity  constraints  and  deteriorating \ninfrastructure, however, threaten the safety and security certification of airports and place these \nobjectives at risk. The CAA has a well-articulated sector development plan4 for dealing with the \nrisks  but  requires  support  to  carry  out  the  plan  and  meet  its  obligations.  External  funding  to \nrehabilitate  and  upgrade  the  national  airports  and  support  their  certification  will  advance  the \nMTDS  2005\u20132010  objectives  of  economic  growth,  rural  development,  poverty  reduction,  and \nhuman resource development. Without the improvements, PNG\u2019s recent rapid economic growth \nmay stall. \n \n24.  Multitranche  financing  facility.    ADB\u2019s  multitranche  financing  facility  is  the  most \nsuitable mode of financing for the investment program because it (i) supports the Government\u2019s \nlong-term vision for the civil aviation sector, as outlined in the CAA\u2019s current plans; (ii) enables \nADB to sustain the long-term partnership that is needed to build institutional capacity; (iii) allows \nADB  to  strengthen  and  improve  CAA\u2019s  long  term  strategic  plans  and  to  actively  pursue  policy \ndialogue  throughout  the  investment  program;  (iv)  allows  the  lessons  of  early  tranches  to  be \napplied in subsequent tranches, and reforms to be implemented and efficiency to improve with \nthe  help  of  incentives;  and  (v)  provides  certainty  to  private  companies  interested  in  pursuing \nlong-term opportunities in the civil aviation sector. ADB\u2019s sector development program modality \nis  not  suitable  because  of  the  commitment  charges  that  would  be  levied  on  the  Government \nand,  from  previous  project  experience  in  PNG,  the  generally  slow  progress  in  physical \nimplementation. With the MFF facility, the Government and the CAA will be able to implement \nprojects with financing certainty matched with realistic implementation timetables. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n25. \nThe investment program will establish a sustainable civil aviation network to support the \neconomic  growth  of  the  country.  In  that  way,  it  will  help  meet  the  objectives  of  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy and program,5 particularly those for the transport sector, and the Government\u2019s MTDS \nobjectives  of  (i) economic  growth,  (ii) rural  development,  (iii) poverty  reduction,  and  (iv) human \nresource development.  \n \n26. \nThe investment program will result in safer, more-secure, and more-efficient all-weather \naccess to air transport services in the project areas through (i) better airport facilities; (ii) safer \nand  more-secure  air  travel;  (iii) more-accessible  markets,  natural  resource  and  mineral  sites, \nand  livelihood  opportunities;  and  (iv) reduced  costs  of  air  travel  to  all  the  project  areas.  It  will \nhelp  achieve  the  Government\u2019s  goal  of  securing  and  maintaining  ICAO  certification  for  the \nsafety and security standards at its airport operations and facilities. \n\n27. \nThe  investment  program  will  concentrate  first  of  all  on  carrying  out  priority  actions  to \ncomply with ICAO security and safety standards, and then on increasing capacity for growth in \n\n                                                 \n4   Civil Aviation Authority. 2008.

The outputs will be as follows: (i) rehabilitated airport infrastructure, including runways, \ntaxiways,  and  aprons;  (ii)  upgraded  runways  and  passenger  terminals  that  can  accommodate \nlarger  aircraft;  (iii)  communication,  navigation,  surveillance,  and \nfirefighting  equipment; \n(iv) better maintained facilities; and (v) an institutionally strengthened and reformed CAA and its \noperational  units.  The  inputs  will  comprise  financing  for  civil  works  and  consulting  services  in \nprogram  administration,  construction  supervision,  and  support  for  the  ongoing  institutional \nreforms. \n \nThe five airports covered by project 1 are the top priorities in the CAA\u2019s strategic plan. \n28. \nThey serve about 1.5 million people, and economic analysis indicates that they are performing \nwell.  The  Jackson  airport  is  the  country\u2019s  main  airport,  with  international  connections,  and  the \nhub  for  all  national  airports.  The  Mount  Hagen  airport  is  the  major  airport  in  the  Highlands \nregion, providing access to the four major provinces (Chimbu, Enga, Southern Highlands, and \nWestern Highlands provinces), the country\u2019s major coffee-growing and mineral resource\u2013based \neconomies.  The  Hoskins  airport  is  the  major  airport  for  West  New  Britain  and  serves  a  major \nisland  economy  that  specializes  in  oil  palm  production.  Wewak,  the  provincial  capital  of  East \nSepik,  is  the  major  town  between  Madang  and  Jayapura  (Indonesia).  It  is  a  major  coastal \neconomy on the northern side of the mainland specializing in timber and natural resources. The \nGurney  airport  provides  connections  with  Alotau,  the  provincial  capital  of  Milne  Bay  province, \nand  access  to  tourist  destinations  along  the  country\u2019s  lower-eastern  coastline;  a  direct  air \ntransport link with Cairns, Australia, is planned. There were about 37,000 aircraft movements at \nthe Jackson airport in 2008 and 15,000 at the Mount Hagen airport, and 1.0 million passengers \nin Jackson and 113,000 in Mount Hagen. In the same year, the airports in Gurney, Hoskins, and \nWewak, averaged 3,000 aircraft movements and 32,000 passengers.  \n \n29. \nProject 1. The first tranche will finance the following, under project 1: (i) improvements \nin pavements and fencing identified as requiring emergency works to comply with ICAO safety \nand  security  standards;  (ii)  support  for  (a)  engineering  design,  preparation  of  bid  documents, \nand  procurement  by  the  CAA;  and  (b)  preparation  by  the  CAA  of  investment  proposals  for \nsubsequent projects and tranches for ADB approval; and (iii) consulting services to CAA for the \nsupervision of (a) airport improvement contracts for the five project 1 airports, and (b) long-term \nmaintenance contracts for these five airports. In addition to the five airports, two others (Kavieng \nand Goroka) will have new security fences installed. \n \n30. \nAt  the  end  of  the  program,  (i)  21  national  airports  will  be  in  compliance  with  ICAO \nsecurity  and  safety  standards,  (ii)  modern  communication  and  navigation  equipment  will  be \nproviding  enhanced  services  and  generating  additional  revenue  for  flight  information  region \noperations and for safe landing and takeoff, (iii) the CAA and its subsidiary operations will have \nimproved their capacity to operate and maintain the civil aviation sector, and (iv) cost recovery \nand sustainability policies will have been implemented throughout the civil aviation sector. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nLong-term  maintenance  contracts.  Long-term  maintenance  contracts  will  be  an \n31. \nintegral  component  of  the  investment  program.  For  the  21  national  airports  covered  by  the \nprogram,  facilities  will  be  upgraded  and  maintenance  improved  to  a  specified  standard  under \ncivil  works  contracts  for  a  contract  period  of  10  years.  The  maintenance  contracts  will  be \nperformance  based,  with  fixed  monthly  payments  contingent  on  meeting  the  performance \nstandards,  and  defined  penalties  for  underperformance.  The  maintenance  contracts  may  be \n\u201cunit  rate\u201d  contracts  to  start  with  and  convertible  after  2  years  into  \u201cperformance-based\u201d \n\n\f7 \n\ncontracts in compliance with ICAO standards. To ensure proper funding, tariffs reviews will take \noperation and maintenance requirements into consideration, and passenger terminal fees at the \nnational airports will be adjusted to match the need for terminal and infrastructure maintenance. \n \nInstitutional  strengthening  and  capacity  development.  DWTCA  is  still  gaining \n32. \ncapacity for effective policy coordination, and CAA is still developing the structure, experience, \nand expertise to deliver efficient services and facilities. To ensure adequate capacity for policy \nplanning,  coordination,  and  implementation,  ADB  will  collaborate  closely  with  the  TSSP.  The \nTSSP is a technical assistance initiative supported by AusAID that supplies both long-term and \nshort-term advisers in policy development and administration. ADB will provide implementation \nand  capacity  development  assistance  in  specialized  areas  related  to  the  delivery  of  the \ninvestment program. On the policy planning and coordination side, ADB is supporting a review \nof  NTDP 2006\u20132010,  while  the  TSSP  is  supporting  the  preparation  of  the  new  long-term \nNational  Transport  Strategy,  Medium  Term  Transport  Plan,  and  National  Airports  Strategic \nManagement  Plan.  On  the  implementation  side,  ADB  will  continuously  support  the  CAA  in \ncorporate  strategy  formulation,  project  development  and  management,  and  sustainable \nmaintenance contracting, even as the TSSP supports advisers in financial management, human \nresource  development  and  training,  information  technology,  asset  management,  and  safety \nmanagement. This collaboration will allow all stakeholders to make the best use of the available \nassistance  for  greater  complementarity.  ADB\u2019s  long-term,  continuous  support  through  the \nprogram  will  build  ownership,  develop  local  capacity,  and  strengthen  government  systems  to \nestablish better control. \n \n33. \nRegional cooperation. To sustain the safety and security improvements in the airports \nand  PNG  compliance  with  ICAO  standards,  the  investment  program  will  facilitate  assistance \nfrom  the  Pacific  Aviation  Safety  Office  (PASO).  PASO  is  a  regional  intergovernmental \norganization formed with ADB loan support6 to provide aviation audit services to ADB member \ncountries  including  PNG.  PASO  inspectors  are  expected  to  conduct  yearly  audits  of  airport \nsafety and security according to an approved work program that has been negotiated with the \nCAA.  PASO  also  conducts  training  in  this  area  with  a  view  to  the  progressive  takeover  of \nresponsibilities by the planned independent safety regulator. \n \nPrivate  sector  participation.  The  civil  aviation  network  contributes  significantly  to  the \n34. \nprivate  sector  involved  in  gold  mining,  oil  and  gas  and  other  mineral  production,  and  coffee \ngrowing  and  processing.  Improved  safety  at  airports,  greater  accessibility,  and  lower  transport \ncosts  will  therefore  benefit  the  private  sector  immensely.  As  part  of  the  ongoing  institutional \nrestructuring,  CAA  is  being  encouraged  to  operate  on  a  commercial  basis,  charging  its  users \nand maintaining the network. To this end, CAA is undertaking an internal review, using its own \nresources,  to  help  identify  and  better  understand  its  cost  structure  and  cost  trends  for  the \nnational airports. It will use this information in future studies to attract private sector participation \nand equitable tariff structures in the civil aviation sector. Arrangements are in place for a study \n(commenced in October 2009) of a possible partnership between CAA and the private sector in \nfunding  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  Jackson\u2019s  airport.  The  study  is  to  be  completed  by \nFebruary  2010.  The  investment  program  will  center  on  the  immediate  high-priority  safety  and \nsecurity  requirements  for  compliance  with  ICAO  standards  and  will  not  be  affected  by  the \noutcome of the Jackson\u2019s airport study. ADB will also explore opportunities for cofinancing the \nother national airports with other aid agencies including AusAID. \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB.  2005.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grant  to  Papua  New  Guinea  for  the  Establishment  of  the  Pacific  Aviation  Safety  Office \nProject. Manila (approved in September, for $1.5 million equivalent). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n  \n35. \nPlanning  and  policy  framework.  NTDP  2006\u20132010  provides  the  overall  policy \nframework  for  airports  and  air  transport,  and  the  CAA\u2019s  Long  Term  Investment  Plan  (LTIP) \n2010\u20132030  provides  the  sector  plan.  Several  initiatives  have  been  taken  by  the  Government \nand development partners to communicate these policies and supplement them with strategies \nfor implementation. Appendix 3 gives the status of implementation of the civil aviation policies \nand  the  support  they  will  receive  from  the  investment  program.  The  financing  framework \nagreement  (FFA)  between  PNG  and  ADB  will  set  out  the  policy  framework  for  the  proposed \nprojects under the MFF, which will be guided by NTDP 2006\u20132010 and LTIP 2010\u20132030. \n \n36. \nSubsequent  subprojects  under  the  investment  program  will  be  closely  aligned  with \nNTDP  2011\u20132020,  which  the  Government  is  now  preparing  and  which  is  expected  to \nincorporate  the  policy  framework  in  Appendix  3.  CAA  is  also  preparing  the  National  Airports \nStrategic  Management  Plan  (NASMP)  2008\u20132018,  documenting  its  approach  to  the  future \nmanagement of operating improvements in PNG\u2019s national airports and setting up cost recovery \nmodels  for  the  sustainability  of  airports  supporting  other  modes  of  transport  to  facilitate \neconomic development. The NASMP is to be completed by the end of 2009. \n \n37. \nProject  implementation.  In  view  of  the  rapid  deterioration  of  airport  pavement \nstructures  and  the  need  to  keep  the  airports  in  operation,  the  CAA  and  the  Government  have \ncreated  and  staffed  the  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  to  help  ADB  process  the  proposed \nlending facility. The Papua New Guinea Resident Mission (PNRM) of ADB led the preparation of \nthe investment program by assembling a team of international experts and by interacting daily \nwith  the  PIU  counterpart  team  members  in  the  following  areas:  (i) civil  aviation  engineering, \n(ii) social development, (iii) environment, (iv) financial analysis, and (v) economic analysis. The \nPIU,  with  guidance  from  PNRM,  has  begun  advance  action  in  the  preparation  of  procurement \ndocuments for (i) the parking apron at Jackson\u2019s domestic airport, (ii) instrument landing system \nequipment for Jackson\u2019s airport, (iii) security fencing for five domestic airports, and (iv) a review \nof  the  feasibility  study  of  Vanimo  domestic  airport,  on  which  the  preparation  of  subsequent \nprojects under the MFF tranches will be based. This implementation assistance, in coordination \nwith the TSSP, will provide adequate capacity to implement a larger program than CAA has so \nfar carried out. \n\nD. \n\nInvestment Plan \n\nInvestment  plan.  The  investment  program  (including  the  anticipated  public\u2013private \n38. \npartnership  for  the  international  airport)  will  cost  an  estimated  $640.0  million  equivalent. \nProject 1, including taxes, duties, physical and price contingencies, interest, and other charges, \nwill  cost  about  $112.0  million  equivalent.  The  cost  estimates  are  summarized  in  Table  1  and \ngiven in detail in Appendix 4 (for the investment program) and Appendix 5 (for project 1). \n\n\f9 \n\nTable 1: Investment Program and Project 1 Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\n  \n\nAmount\n\n514.0\n34.0\n17.0\n565.0\n75.0\n640.0\n\nTotal \n\nSubtotal \n\n1.

The  investment  program  mirrors  the  road  map  for  assistance  to \nthe  civil  aviation  sector  in  dealing  with  such  sector  constraints  as  physical  infrastructure \n(deteriorating  air-side  and  land-side  infrastructure),  sector  policy  shortcomings  (no  policy  on \nsocial safety obligations, noncompliance with ICAO safety and security requirements, etc.), and \ncapacity building requirements. An indicative plan for tranche releases (Appendix 4) shows five \nairports in project 1 (Jackson\u2019s domestic airport, Mount Hagen, Wewak, Hoskins, and Gurney), \nfive more airports in tranche 2 (Nadzab, Madang, Kavieng, Goroka, and Tokua) in 2011, and the \nrest of the airports in 2012 through 2013. The sequencing of project airports takes into account \nthe  priority  safety  requirements  associated  with  the  repairs  in  airport  pavements  to  meet  the \nsafety  requirements  of  aircraft  of  Air  Niugini  and  other  airlines.  In  sector  policy  reform,  the \ninvestment program will focus on separating the operating and regulatory functions of the CAA, \nreviewing and revising civil aviation charges, and restructuring CAA into separate legal entities \nrepresenting  functional  responsibilities  (a  timetable  for  the  policy  reform  targets  is  in \nAppendix 1).  As  part  of  the  FFA,  trigger  points  regarding  compliance  with  ADB  safeguard \npolicies,  implementation  of  agreed  policy  reforms,  advance  procurement  actions,  government \napproval clearances, progress in the implementation of ongoing subprojects, etc., will be agreed \non with the Government and the CAA before subsequent MFF tranche releases are approved. \nAppendix 6 lists potential airports for subsequent projects and the criteria used in their selection. \n\nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n40. \nproject 1. \n\nTable  2  summarizes  the  tentative  financing  plan  for  the  investment  program  and \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2: Tentative Financing Plan \n \n\nSource \nInvestment Program \nAsian Development Bank \nPrivate Sector Participation (PPP) a \nGovernment \n\nProject 1 \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment b \n\nTotal \n($ million)\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n% \n\n \n75.0 \n12.0 \n13.0 \n100.0 \n \n85.0 \n15.0 \n100.0 \n\n480.0 \n75.0 \n85.0 \n640.0 \n \n95.0 \n17.0 \n112.0 \n\nTotal\n\nTotal\n\nPPP = public\u2013private partnership. \na  Expected to receive from private sector for Jackson\u2019s international airport. \nb  Includes taxes and duties of $8.5 million \nSources: Civil Aviation Authority and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n41.  Multitranche  financing  facility:  amount  and  terms.  The  proposal  calls  for  ADB  to \nprovide up to $480 million equivalent through the MFF to help fund the investment program. The \nfunding  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  policy,7\n  and  will  come  primarily  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources  (subject  to  availability,  as  described  in  para.  46  below);  supplemental  funding  will \ncome from ordinary capital resources (OCR). The MFF will comprise several loans, conditional \non the Government\u2019s submission of the related periodic financing requests (PFRs), execution of \nthe related loan agreements, and fulfillment of the terms and conditions and understandings set \nforth in its FFA with ADB. The investment program will be implemented over 9 years. The OCR \nfunding  will  be  covered  by  Ordinary  Operations  Loan  Regulations  that  apply  to  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)\u2013based  loans,  and  the  funding  from  Special  Funds  resources \nSpecial  Operations  Loan  Regulations.  In  both  cases,  any  modifications  introduced  under  the \nindividual loan agreements will apply. The Government will provide counterpart funding of $85.0 \nmillion equivalent, including all local taxes and duties. In addition, ADB will explore and pursue \nviable  cofinancing  opportunities  (with  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  Korean \nEXIM  Bank,  European  Investment  Bank,  etc.)  during  the  implementation  of  the  investment \nprogram and the preparation of subsequent tranches. The grant component will be at least 35% \nof the MFF, in compliance with the Government\u2019s Medium Term Debt Strategy for 2009\u20132013. \nADB\u2019s  analysis  of  the  sustainability  of  PNG\u2019s  external  debt  shows  that  PNG  will  remain  at \nmoderate risk of external debt distress over the medium term after the four project tranches of \nthe  investment  program.  External  debt  burden  indicators  will  be  well  below  their  indicative \nthresholds under the baseline scenario, but some vulnerability to further terms-of-trade shocks \nand slower economic growth will also continue. \n \n42. \nIn accordance with the FFA, the Government\u2019s first PFR for project 1 will cover a blend \nof three ADB loans totaling about $95 million equivalent to help finance project 1\u2014an OCR loan \nof about $25 million and two loans from Special Funds resources totaling $70 million equivalent \n(a \u201chard-term\u201d Asian Development Fund [ADF] loan of $20 million equivalent and a \u201csoft-term\u201d \nADF loan of about $50 million equivalent). The ADB loans will finance 85% of the total cost of \nproject 1.  \n \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB. 2005.

A program steering committee will oversee the implementation \nof  the  investment  program,  monitor  progress,  approve  the  airports  selected  for  subsequent \nprojects, and guide the CAA and the implementing agencies. The program steering committee \nwill be chaired by the CEO of CAA and members will have representatives from the Papua New \nGuinea  Air  Services  Ltd.  (PNGASL),  the  Department  of  Treasury,  the  Department  of  National \nPlanning and Monitoring, the Department of Transport, ADB PNG Resident Mission, Air Niugini \nAirlines,  and  civil  aviation  stakeholder  organizations  as  members.  The  committee  will  meet  at \nleast once each quarter. \n \n48. \nA  PIU,  headed  by  the  director\u2013ADB  Project  (already  appointed)  and  supported  by \ninvestment  program  consultants,  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  sector  policy  and \ninfrastructure  components  of  the  program.  It  will  hire  all  consultants  and  enter  into  airport \nimprovement contracts under the program. The current PIU national staff combines skills in civil \nengineering,  aviation  equipment  engineering,  financial  accounting,  economics,  environmental \nmanagement, and procurement. The PIU is now engaged in advance bid document preparation \nfor the following: (i) extension of the domestic parking bay at Jackson\u2019s airport; (ii) acquisition of \ninstrument  landing  system  equipment  for  Jackson\u2019s  airport;  (iii) security  airport  fencing  for  the \nGoroka, Gurney, Hoskins, Kavieng, and Wewak airports; and (iv) topographic and geotechnical \nsurveys.  The  bidding  is  expected  to  be  substantially  completed  by  December  2009.  The  early \nestablishment of the PIU will allow the national counterpart staff to gain enough technical skills \nto  prepare  subsequent  subprojects  much  earlier  than  in  the  past.  In  addition,  the  Papua  New \nGuinea  Resident  Mission  of  ADB  will  continuously  assist  and  guide  the  PIU  in  complying  with \nADB procurement procedures and practices. \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB. 2007.

For  project  1, \nthe  support  consultants  will  assist  CAA  in  detailed  engineering,  bid  document  preparation, \nenvironment  and  resettlement  planning,  tendering,  and  contract  award.  All  resettlement \nactivities  will  be  completed  before  the  start  of  civil  works.  For  subsequent  projects,  the  CAA, \nwith  the  assistance  of  the  consultants,  will  (i)  select  the  project  airports  on  the  basis  of  the \nagreed  selection  criteria  (Appendix  6);  (ii)  prepare  the  project  report,  including  technical, \neconomic, environmental, and social assessments; and (iii) prepare a PFR for each airport. The \nproject  report  will  conform  to  the  criteria  and  procedures  stated  in  the  FFA,  and  other  related \nrequirements  of  the  Government  and  ADB.  After  appraising  the  technical,  financial,  and \neconomic feasibility of each project and compliance with safeguard requirements, the CAA will \nsubmit  to  ADB,  through  the  Department  of  National  Planning  and  Monitoring,  a  summary \nappraisal report in the format specified in the investment program administration memorandum \nand  the  draft  PFR.  ADB  will  undertake  due  diligence  according  to  its  relevant  policies  and \nprocedures, and approve the CAA\u2019s appraisal, subject to any amendments. If required by ADB, \nthe CAA will amend the PFR and submit it to ADB for approval by its due date.  \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  investment  program  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  9  years  until \n50. \nDecember 2018.  Project  1  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  2012.  CAA  will  prepare  detailed \nimplementation schedules for the subsequent projects. An indicative implementation plan for the \ninvestment program and a detailed implementation schedule for project 1 are in Appendix 7. \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\nAll procurement to be financed under an ADB loan will conform to ADB\u2019s  Procurement \n51. \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  contracts  over  $3  million  for  civil  works \nand over $0.5 million for goods will undergo international competitive bidding. Contracts below \nthese  thresholds  will  go  through  national  competitive  bidding  and,  as  appropriate,  minor \ncontracts  below  $100,000  will  be  awarded  through  shopping.  (The  procurement  plan  is  in \nAppendix 8.)  A  procurement  capacity  assessment  has  concluded  that  procurement  activities \nassociated with the investment program can use the CAA\u2019s existing procurement systems and \nprocedures. \n\n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n52. \nInternational  and  national  consultants  will  be  hired  for  engineering  design,  civil  works \nsupervision,  capacity  building,  financial  accounting,  advisory  services,  and  studies  as \nappropriate.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  quality  and  cost-based  selection  (at  the \nstandard 80:20 ratio) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). A consulting firm will be recruited to carry out detailed design and \nconstruction supervision, and individual consultants to serve as PIU advisers. \n \n53. \ntotal  of  1,000  person-months  of  consulting  services \n(357 international  and  643  national).  (Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  services  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix A.) Additional consulting services, if necessary, will be procured under \nsubsequent projects. The consulting services will be financed from the ADB loans.  \n\nProject  1  will  require  a \n\n\f13 \n\n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n54. \nADB  Management  has  approved  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  for  the \ninvestment  program  and  for  project  1  preparation.  Advance  contracting  will  be  used  for  the \npre-feasibility  work  of  project  analysts  including  survey  works  (geotechnical  studies  and \ntopography),  social  dimensioning,  and  financial,  economic,  environmental,  and  engineering \ndesign  preparation  for  subsequent  subprojects.  Retroactive  financing  for  the  PFRs  under  the \nMFF will be limited to 20% of the proceeds of the individual loans under the MFF, provided that \nexpenditures comply with the agreed procedures and are made within the 12 months before the \nsigning of the pertinent loan agreement under the MFF. Retroactive financing will be restricted \nto  eligible  expenditures\u2014seminars  on  business  opportunities,  PIU  incremental  costs  including \nproject  officers\u2019  remuneration,  office  equipment,  surveys,  consulting  services,  and  civil  works. \nThe Government and the CAA have been informed that the approval of advance procurement \naction and retroactive financing does not in any way commit ADB to finance the subprojects. As \npart  of  advance  procurement,  the  CAA\u2019s  PIU  team  will  have  substantially  completed  the \nprequalification  and  bidding  exercises  for  the  Jackson\u2019s  airport  (surveys,  extension  of  parking \naprons for domestic operations, and procurement of air navigation equipment) and the security \nfences at most of the airports covered by project 1 before the investment program is considered \nby the ADB Board of Directors.  \n\n \n\n7. \n\nInvestment Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nthe \n\nindicators \n\nTargets  and \n\nfor  monitoring  and  evaluating \n\n55. \ninvestment  program \nperformance have been discussed with the CAA, and the key targets and indicators have been \nincluded  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1).  The  consultants  for  program \nimplementation support will work with the CAA to collect data from relevant agencies, including \nprovincial  governments  and  stakeholders,  for  use  in  measuring  performance  against  the \nindicators  at  inception,  3  years  after  each  project,  and  at  the  end  of  the  investment  program. \nThe CAA, with the assistance of the supervision consultant, will monitor and evaluate the impact \nof  the  investment  program  to  ensure  that  the  completed  infrastructure  is  being  managed \neffectively  and  the  benefits  are  maximized.  ADB  Management  will  prepare  periodic  reports  on \noverall progress to the Board. \n\n \n\n8. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption Measures \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n56. \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the projects under the investment \nprogram.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  will  be \nincluded  in  the  loan  agreements  and  bidding  documents  for  the  investment  program.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the investment program shall include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of CAA \nand  its  subsidiary  entities,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service \nproviders as they relate to the investment program. \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nthematic  areas\u2014public \n\nthe  Government.

As  required  by  ADB,10  a  governance  risk  assessment  and \nmanagement plan (GRAMP) (Supplementary Appendix B) put together during the preparation of \nthe  investment  program  identified  the  risks  and  associated  mitigating  actions,  and  these  were \nfinancial  management, \ndiscussed  with \nprocurement,  and  anticorruption  measures\u2014were  assessed  for  significant  risks.  The  following \ngovernance  safeguards  will  mitigate  the  risk  of  misuse  of  funds  and  improve  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  according  to  the  GRAMP:  (i)  the  disclosure  of  updated  and \ndetailed information on project implementation on the CAA website; (ii) the timely disclosure of \ninformation  on  the  selection  of  consultants  and  contractors  in  local  newspapers  and  on  the \nwebsite;  (iii)  the  dissemination  to  the  public  of  such  information  as  the  service  expected  from \nperformance-based  contracts;  (iv)  compliance  with  ADB  procurement  rules;  (v)  independent \nverification of the quantity, quality, and costs of works by an international supervising consultant \n(or  equivalent);  (vi)  comprehensive  accounting  support  to  ensure,  among  other  things,  timely \nand  rigorous  reconciliation,  orderly  record  keeping,  and  strict  adherence \nfinancial \nmanagement  policies  and  internal  controls;  (vii)  independent  external  auditing  of  financial \nstatements  and,  where  appropriate,  contracts  and  project  accounts;  (viii)  supervision  by  ADB \nand other funding agencies; and (ix) forensic audits of alleged cases of corruption. \n\nto \n\n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n58. \nThe  CAA  has  agreed  to  adhere  to  sound  financial  management  requirements  while \nimplementing the investment program. It will prepare annual financial statements on an accrual \naccounting  basis  and  in  accordance  with  international  financing  reporting  standards,  and  will \nmaintain  separate  and  adequate  project  records  and  accounts  to  identify  (i)  the  goods  and \nservices financed from the loan proceeds, (ii) the financing resources received, (iii) expenditures \nincurred on the components of each project, and (iv) counterpart and cofinancing funds received \nand  spent.  The  agency  will  hire  independent  external  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  to  audit  the \nconsolidated project accounts, including counterpart funds, yearly. It will submit to ADB certified \ncopies of the audited accounts, as well as the auditor\u2019s report, in English within 6 months of the \nend of each financial year during the implementation period. CAA has been advised that ADB \nrequires  the  timely  submission  of  the  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements,  and \nthat it may suspend the disbursement of ADB loans if the requirement is not complied with. \n \n59. \nThe  CAA  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  on  individual \nprojects,  including  (i)  a  narrative  description  of  progress  made  during  the  reporting  period, \n(ii) changes  in  the  implementation  schedule,  (iii)  problems  or  difficulties  encountered,  and \n(iv) activities  to  be  undertaken  in  the  next  reporting  period.  The  CAA  will  also  prepare  and \nsubmit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  within  3  months  of  the  completion  of  each  project, \nand  an  investment  program  completion  report  after  the  completion  of  all  projects  under  the \ninvestment program. \n\n \n\n10. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n60. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  until  30  June  2019.  Direct  payment  procedures  will \ngenerally  be  used  for  airport  improvement  civil  works  and  consulting  services  contracts.  The \n                                                 \n10 Applicable  policies  and  guidelines  include:  (i)  ADB.  2006.  Second  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan. \nManila; and (ii) ADB. 2008. Guidelines for Implementing ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan \n(GACAP II). Manila (May). \n\n\f15 \n\nCAA  will maintain separate bank accounts for government counterpart funds for project 1 and \nseparate  accounting  records  for  subsequent  project  loans,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed on by the Government and ADB.  \n\n \n\n11. \n\nReviews \n\n61. \nADB will field inception missions within 3 months of the approval of the loan(s) for each \nproject, and at least two review missions a year. The Government and ADB will jointly undertake \na midterm review of project 1 within 2 years of its start and a midterm review of the investment \nprogram by 2014. The timing of the midterm reviews of subsequent projects will be agreed on \nduring  the  appraisal  of  each  project.  The  midterm  reviews  will  center  on  (i) program  impact, \n(ii) implementation  progress,  (iii) progress  with  the  policy  framework,  (iv) the  performance  of \nconsultants  and  contractors,  (v) the  status  of  compliance  with  undertakings  in  the  FFA  and \ncovenants in the individual loan agreements, and (vi) the need for any midcourse changes in the \nscope or schedule of the investment program to achieve its full impact. \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n62. \nAlthough  a  majority  of  the  country\u2019s  population  will  benefit  from  having  access  to  air \ntransportation, the traveling public using the airports included in project 1 will be the immediate \nbeneficiaries. Safer and better-maintained airports will increase the availability, frequency, and \nreliability of transport services and lower their cost, to the benefit of the airlines and the traveling \npublic,  and  result  in  travel  to  the  project  areas.  Among  the  anticipated  economic  benefits  are \n(i) more diverse economic opportunities, higher production, and more direct sales as a result of \nbetter access to regional markets and towns; (ii) more sales for market vendors because of the \nincrease in customers; (iii) better business for hospitality, trade store, and industrial enterprises; \nand (iv) more opportunities to create and expand small and medium-sized enterprises. \n \nThe  anticipated  social  benefits  include:  (i) increased  agricultural  sales  from  upgraded \n63. \nmarkets  near  the  airports,  (ii) more  job  opportunities  through  required  civil  works,  (iii) higher \nschool  enrollments  and  better  access  to  health  care  with  the  increase  in  household  incomes, \nand (iv) more opportunities to diversify and expand industrial and agricultural production. \n \n64. \nThe  improved  airport  facilities  will  increase  the  mobility  of  people  and  make  markets, \nresources,  and  opportunities  more  accessible  to  them.  People  living  in  the  project  areas  will \nbenefit  directly  from  job  opportunities  through  the  required  civil  works,  market  upgrading,  and \nbusiness  opportunities  (particularly  in  tourism).  Airport  users  will  benefit,  and  so  will  the  local \ncommunities  at  each  project  site,  including  airport  market  vendors  (especially  women  selling \nvegetables,  food,  and  handicrafts).  Public  transport  service  industries  and  tourism-associated \nindustries  will  be  the  secondary  beneficiaries.  The  five  airports  (including  Jackson\u2019s  in  Port \nMoresby) under project 1 serve a population of up to 1,586,978.  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nFinancial Analysis, Financial Evaluation, and Financial Management Assessment \n\n \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Analysis and Financial Evaluation \n\n65. \nThe  CAA  had  operating  revenues  of  K28,400,087  and  operating  expenditures  of \nK69,179,340 in 2008. It also received a substantial government subsidy of K42,400,000 to cover \nthe  costs  of  restructuring,  as  well  as  other  government  subsidies  amounting  to  K48,096,033. \nThe revenues from civil aviation activities alone, without the ongoing government subsidies, are \nnot  enough  to  cover  its  operating  expenditures.  These  figures  exclude  overflying  charges  of \nK17.98 million, which are accounted for separately by PNGASL. \n \n66. \nProjected  financial  statements  were  prepared  for  the  project  1  airports  and  PNGASL. \nThe  projections  were  based  on  assumptions  about  the  following:  (i)  scheduled  and  projected \naircraft  movements,  (ii)  projected  number  of  passengers,  (iii)  rates  charged  for  the  landing  of \neach  type  of  aircraft,  and  (iv)  passenger  service  charges  for  departing  passengers.  The \nprojected  financial  statements  indicate  that  PNGASL  and  Jackson\u2019s  airport  are  sustainable  in \nthe long term,11 but the smaller project 1 airports will be only marginally viable without ongoing \ngovernment  support.  The  CAA  is  now  undertaking  a  special  review  of  the  smaller  airports  to \nestablish accurate operational cost data and begin rationalizing and optimizing costs.  \n \n67. \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  was  estimated  through  a  comparison  of \nwith-project  and  without-project  scenarios.  The  FIRRs  for  PNGASL  (167%)  and  Jackson\u2019s \nairport  (12%)  compare  favorably  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  2.42%.  The \nsmaller  project  1  airports  have  negative  FIRRs;  however,  the  investment  program  for  the \nproject 1 airports must proceed because of the safety and security compliance issues identified \nearlier (Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n68. \nGiven  the  viability  issues  associated  with  the  smaller  project 1  airports,  specific \nperformance  measures  for  monitoring  the  viability  of  the  CAA  would  be  useful.  These \nperformance  measures  would  focus  on  the  two  key  drivers  that  CAA  must  concentrate  on  to \nbecome viable in the long term\u2014containing expenditures and improving cash flow. A profitability \nmeasure  and  a  cash  efficiency  measure  will  therefore  be  included  in  the  loan  agreement.  For \nexample,  in  2008,  CAA  expenditures  were  nearly  four  times  greater  than  revenues  (excluding \ngovernment  subsidies).  The  target  benchmark  should  be  to  reduce  the  operating  ratio  by  at \nleast 20% percent by FY2011. Poor receivables management further strains the viability of the \nCAA.  In  2008,  the  number  of  days\u2019  receivables  was  567.12  The  benchmark  will  be  set  at  no \nmore than 75 days by FY2012. \n \nBudgeting  and  the  recording  and  reporting  of  airport  information  must  be  significantly \n69. \nstrengthened  to  guide  the  CAA  in  managing  the  airports  and  making  future  pricing  decisions. \nCosts and revenues must be appropriately allocated, and monthly reporting of the key drivers of \nthe  business  must  be  introduced.  The  key  drivers  include  aircraft  movements  for  landing  and \nparking  fees,  passenger  movements  for  terminal  facility  charges,  and  number  of  leases  and \nconcessions and the revenues derived from them. Also, as much as possible for each airport, \n\n                                                 \n11 In 2008, Jackson\u2019s airport had revenues 37\u2013160 times greater than those of the smaller project 1 airports. \n12 A  measure  of  the  average  time  it  takes  a  company\u2019s  customers  to  pay  for  purchases.  The  figure  for  2008  was \nabnormally high; even so, the figures for 2006 (170) and 2007 (174) were high compared with normally accepted \ncommercial benchmarks. \n\n\f17 \n\nactual  revenues  and  expenditures  (rather  than  an  allocated  portion)  should  be  reported,  to \nimprove accountability. \n \n70. \nBesides  cost  containment,  better  cash  management,  and  stronger  airport  information \nsystems, there must be an increase in revenues. Tariffs must be reviewed frequently to protect \nagainst inflationary pressures and achieve sustainability in asset maintenance. These measures \nwill be dealt with in the policy dialogue under the investment program, and technical expertise \nwill  be  provided.  Attracting  larger  planes  could  bring  in  more  revenues  at  some  airports,  but \nnon-aero income is the area of opportunity particularly at the larger airports. Such income would \nhelp reduce the CAA\u2019s reliance on government subsidies and improve the viability of the airports \nbusiness.  The  investment  program  will  help  bring  these  airports  up  to  international  safety \nstandards to make the airports business more attractive to international airlines and allow local \nairlines to offer more flights and upgrade to a larger fleet of aircraft. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Management Assessment \n\nEffective financial management within the CAA, both in the effective use of funds and in \n71. \nthe  safeguarding  of  assets  created,  will  be  a  critical  success  factor  for  project  sustainability. \nADB projects in PNG in recent years have done poorly in both implementation and development \noutcomes,  relative  to  projects  in  other  ADB  developing  member  countries.  The  major  project \nimplementation  issues  generally  are  as  follows:  (i)  delays  in  the  approval  of  contracts  by  the \nNational  Executive  Council,  (ii)  delays  in  the  provision  of  counterpart  funds,  and  (iii)  delays  in \nthe  submission  of  audited  annual  project  accounts.  A  financial  management  assessment,  as \nrequired  by  ADB,  rated  the  overall  inherent  risk  substantial  and  the  overall  control  risk  high13 \n(Supplementary  Appendix  D).  Particular  issues  involve  insufficiencies  in  the  supporting \ndocumentation  submitted  to  substantiate  the  liquidation  of  imprest  funds  and  difficulties  in  the \naudit  of  annual  project  accounts  due  to  poor  project  record keeping,  unreconciled  bank \naccounts  and  ledger  accounts,  and  lengthy  delays  in  receiving  responses  to  audit  queries. \nGiven these previous issues, direct payment procedures will predominate, imprest accounts will \nnot be established, and the reimbursement procedure for eligible expenditures will apply with full \nsupporting  documentation  (see  para.  60  above).  In  addition,  ADB  is  now  processing  capacity \ndevelopment  technical  assistance  for  Supporting  Public  Financial  Management  Project  to \nstrengthen the oversight and monitoring of statutory authorities in PNG, including the CAA.  \n \n72. \nThe  PIU,  supported  by  an  accountant  and  a  finance  clerk,  will  be  required  to  maintain \nseparate  and  adequate  project  records  and  accounts  to  identify  (i) the  goods  and  services \nfinanced  from  the  loan  proceeds,  (ii) the  financing  resources  received,  (iii) the  expenditures \nincurred  for  each  project  component,  and  (iv)  the  counterpart  and  cofinancing  funds  received \nand  spent.  The  CAA  will  hire  independent  external  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  to  audit  the \nconsolidated  project  accounts  yearly,  and  will  submit  to  ADB  certified  copies  of  the  audited \naccounts, as well as the auditor\u2019s report, in English within 6 months of the end of each financial \nyear during the implementation period. \n\nC. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n73. \nFor the economic evaluation, the benefits of project 1 airports were calculated in terms \nof users\u2019 willingness to pay, as reflected in incremental revenues from airport operations, such \nas landing charges and other airport operating fees and charges. The evaluation also included \n\n                                                 \n13 These ratings are consistent with similar assessments made by development partners in the transport sector. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nan  assessment  of  (i)  benefits  to  operators,  such  as  savings  in  direct  wear-and-tear  costs  and \nfuel;  (ii)  benefits  to  passengers,  such  as  direct  time  savings;  (iii)  benefits  from  safety \nimprovements;  and  (iv)  benefits  to  regional  and  local  communities  from  such  things  as  the \ndevelopment  of  market  sales  and  tourism.  The  analysis  identified  the  value  added  by \nmore-reliable  aircraft  operations  made  possible  by  improved  safety  standards  at  the  project 1 \nairports  and  more-efficient  aircraft  handling  of  arrival  and  departure  passengers.  These \noperating  improvements  would  result  from  improvements  in  airport  security  arrangements, \nrunway extensions, extensions in aircraft parking aprons, and terminal improvements. \n \n74. \nThe economic costs for project 1 include the resource costs for traded and non-traded \ncosts,  materials,  and  labor.  All  cost  elements  were  valued  at  border  prices,  with  all  taxes  and \nduties  excluded.  A  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.90  was  applied  to  the  financial  costs  of \nnon-traded  inputs  to  calculate  economic  prices.  Subproject  facilities  are  expected  to  have  an \naverage economic life of 20 years. \n \n75. \nAircraft, passenger, and freight movements were examined by flight category to identify \ncurrent  and  future  trends  in  scheduled  flights,  second-level  airline  operations,  and  charter \noperations  in  particular,  identifying  the  future  impact  of  natural  resource  exploration  and  the \ndevelopment  impact  on  particular  regional  airports  in  PNG.  While  the  full  impact  of  the \npotentially large liquefied natural gas project has not yet been specified, the potential increase in \ncharter aircraft operations through Mount Hagen airport was identified and incorporated in traffic \nforecasts and the economic impact associated with project 1. \n \n76. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  project  1  is  estimated  at  45%.  A  sensitivity \nanalysis tested the effects of possible unfavorable scenarios resulting from changes in the key \nparameters  that  determine  the  project\u2019s  costs  and  benefits.  This  analysis  indicates  that  the \nproject\u2019s economic viability would remain satisfactory even under adverse scenarios, and that it \nwould  require  a  cost  increase  of  200%  or  a  decrease  in  benefits  of  66%  to  reach  a  cutoff \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  of  12%.  An  economic  analysis  of  project  1  airports  is  in \nAppendix 9. \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social Impact \n\n77. \nSocial  impact  and  poverty  assessment  study.  If  airfares  are  reduced,  people  will \nhave  more  access  to  regional  markets  and  towns,  and  will  therefore  be  able  to  expand  and \ndiversify their agricultural production, particularly cash crops. Increased direct sales at markets \nwill have a positive impact on household incomes. People are expected to get better prices for \ntheir  products  when  they  can  sell  at  upgraded  markets  rather  than  through  middlemen.  There \nwill  be  also  increased  opportunities  for  the  creation  and  expansion  of  small  businesses \nthroughout  the  region  because  of  the  increased  accessibility  and  customers.  The  increase  in \nhousehold incomes would also make families better able to pay for education and health care. \nTherefore,  the  program  will  contribute  not  only  to  economic  growth  but  also,  indirectly,  to \nimproved  social \nindicators  such  as  health  and  education  outcomes  (Supplementary \nAppendix E). \n\n78. \nApart from Jackson\u2019s airport and the Boram (Wewak) airport, the four other airports are \nmore than 10 kilometers from the main town centers. Hoskins is more than 40 kilometers from \nthe  town  center.  Women  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  airport  walk  with  their  children  to  sell \ntheir  produce  at  informal  market  grounds.  These  are  usually  undeveloped  or  vacant  pieces  of \nland close to or adjacent to the terminal and parking area of the airport. The investment program \n\n\f19 \n\nwill support the upgrading of existing local markets around the airport sites through the provision \nof  better  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  but  the  local  government  and  the  CAA  must \nagree to make the improvements and obtain the agreement of the landowners.  \n \nThe airports are now used mostly by employees of large companies, government, a few \n79. \nlocal  successful  businesses,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  tourists.  An  increase  in  the \npassenger  volume,  particularly  in  the  tourism  sector,  is  foreseen  to  lead  to  lower  airfares \nthroughout  the  region  and  the  country,  making  air  travel  more  affordable  to  the  general \npopulation. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n\nE. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\nreview \n\nframework \n\nthat  presents \n\nProject 1 is classified under environmental category B, according to ADB\u2019s Environment \n80. \nPolicy (2002), Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), and Staff Instruction on the Use of \nMultitranche  Financing  Facility,14  and  as  a  level  2  activity  under  PNG\u2019s  Environmental  Act \n(2000)  and  Environment  (Prescribed  Activities)  Regulations  (2002).  Each  subsequent  project \nwill be categorized in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy rule that is in place at the time \nthe  PFR  is  submitted  to  ADB.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  each  airport \nrehabilitation under project 1 was undertaken to assess the potential environmental impact. An \nthe  general  anticipated \nenvironmental  assessment \nenvironmental  impact  of  the  investment,  the  subproject  selection  criteria,  and  the  subproject \nenvironmental procedure (Supplementary Appendix F) was prepared. The review framework will \nguide the preparation and approval of environmental assessments of future projects considered \nfor  financing  under  the  investment  program.  An  environment  permit  will  be  secured  from  the \nDepartment of Environment and Conservation for activities listed in the Environment (Prescribed \nActivities) Regulation (2002). The summary IEE is in Appendix 11. \n \nAll  five  airports  under  project  1  will  be  rehabilitated  and  improved  within  their  existing \n81. \nboundaries.  The  environmental  impact  of  airport  rehabilitation  during  construction  was \nassessed,  and  is  deemed  insignificant  since  no  major  civil  works  will  be  undertaken  and  the \nenvironmental  impact  will  be  temporary  and  reversible  and  can  be  mitigated  with  available \nmethods.  The  environmental  impact  during  operation  will  generally  be  due  to  waste  and \npollution,  noise,  and  vibration.  To  address  this  impact,  the  project  will  maintain  the  sewage \nsystem in good condition as part of its airport maintenance program. The impact from noise and \nvibration  during  airport  operation  is  not  expected  to  increase  significantly.  A  noise  buffer  will \nnonetheless  be  put  up,  where  necessary,  between  the  facility  and  the  surrounding  areas  to \nminimize the impact. The environmental mitigation and monitoring procedures set out in the IEE \nand  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  will  minimize  the  environmental  impact  from \nthe construction and operation of the subprojects to insignificant levels. \n \n82. \nFor future subprojects, the EMP for each subproject will be incorporated into the design \nand  implementation  of  airports  under  these  projects.  The  new  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(SPS)  dated  20  July  2009  and  effective  on  20  January  2010  will  be  applicable.  The  EMP  will \nguide the PIU, supervisory consultants, and contractors in managing, monitoring, and reporting \nenvironmental  impact  mitigation  measures  and  compliance.  Civil  works  may  begin  only  after \nADB  approves  the  environmental  assessment  report  on  the  subprojects  and  a  permit  for \nactivities  specified  in  the  Environment  (Prescribed  Activities)  Regulations  (2002)  is  received \nfrom  the  Department  of  Environment  and  Conservation.  The  environmental  management \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2006. Staff Instruction on the Use of Multitranche Financing Facility. Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\ncapacity  of  the  PIU  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  requirements  will \nthus be strengthened. \n\nF. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\ntemporary \n\n83. \nInvoluntary resettlement. Most of the major airports and terminal facilities in PNG are \nowned and operated by the Government through the CAA. Most of the proposed improvements \nin  the  21  airport  sites  will  be  undertaken  within  existing  airport  boundaries.  In  case  additional \nland is needed for the investment program (any such requirement is expected to be minor), the \nCAA,  through  the  Department  of  Land  and  Physical  Planning,  will  process  the  formal  land \nacquisition  according  to  the  Land  Act  of  1996.15  Since  formal  land  acquisition  takes \nconsiderable time, the CAA will also seek alternative options exercised by other agencies such \nas  the  Department  of  Works.  The  provincial  government  will  negotiate  a  memorandum  of \nagreement with the affected clans and communities (local government) to allow the use of the \nland for airport upgrading. \n \nIn  the  case  of  project  1,  all  civil  works,  including  the  improvement  and  extension  of \n84. \nrunways, will be undertaken within the existing airport boundaries (state-owned land); hence, no \nland  acquisition  is  anticipated.  However,  minor  issues  related  to  permanent  and  temporary \nresettlement  may  have  to  be  resolved.  At  the  site  in  Wewak,  the  proposed  extension  of  the \nBoram  airport  runway  is  expected  to  require  the  diversion  of  a  feeder  road  (Perigo  road)  that \nlinks the settlement to the Brandi Highway. This diversion will result in the relocation of a soccer \nfield of the Correction Institution Services (CIS). The CAA and the CIS have agreed to process \nthe relocation, and the actual work will be included in the scope of work for the Wewak airport \nupgrading.  Other  minor  permanent  and \nincludes \ncompensation for the felling of a few trees. \n \nThe  number  of  people  that  may  experience  the  incidental  impact  of  the  upgrading  of \n85. \nairports under the program is therefore expected to be small and well within the category of \u201cno \nsignificant resettlement impact\u201d under ADB\u2019s policy. The four airport sites under project 1 were \nscreened to confirm the level of the impact. The program is a category B program with respect \nto involuntary resettlement. For future subprojects, the SPS will apply. \n \n86. \nA resettlement framework was prepared for the investment program and reviewed by the \nGovernment to establish policies and procedures for compensating the affected people for lost \nor damaged assets (Supplementary Appendix G). (The summary resettlement framework is in \nAppendix  12.)  The  resettlement  framework  is  based  on  the  principles  established  in  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  relevant  sections  of  the  Operations  Manual  (as \nupdated  in  2006).  The  resettlement  framework  will  guide  the  CAA  in  preparing  and \nimplementing  the  resettlement  issues  in  the  investment  program.  Since  the  impact  of  the \nproject 1  airports  will  be  minor,  due  diligence  reports  were  prepared  for  four  sites  including \nWewak, Hoskins, Mount Hagen, and Gurney (Supplementary Appendix H). The reports will be \nfurther updated on the basis of the detailed engineering designs during implementation. \n \n87. \nIndigenous  people.  PNG  is  made  up  of  over  600  islands  and  is  a  diverse \nagglomeration  of  tribal  groups  speaking  800  distinct  languages.  No  particular  ethnic  group \n                                                 \n15  Regarding the state alienation of customary land, the Land Act of 1996 states that affected clans and communities \nwill  be  compensated  for  land;  individuals  and  households  with  assets  on  the  land  will  be  compensated  for  any \ndamage to or loss of these assets; and clans and communities will be compensated according to the provisions of \nagreements.  \n\nimpact  under  project  1 \n\n\f21 \n\ndominates  economic  or  political  life  within  the  sites  for  project  1,  which  include  four  provinces \n(East  Sepik,  West  New  Britain,  Western  Highland,  and  Milne  Bay)  and  the  National  Capital \nDistrict. Two major languages are spoken in these areas. Pidgin is spoken by the majority and \nHiri  Motu  is  spoken  mainly  around  Port  Moresby  and  elsewhere  in  Papua.  English  is  the \nlanguage  of  administration  and  official  communication,  but  Tok  Pisin,  Hiri  Motu,  or  the  local \nlanguage (Tok Ples) is the preferred day-to-day means of communication. \n \n88. \nIn  general,  no  tribes  or  ethnic  groups  in  PNG  are  significantly  different  from  others  or \nconsider  themselves  to  be  minorities;  therefore,  no  ethnic  minority  groups  are  expected  to  be \nadversely  affected  by  the  investment  program.  The  program  is  a  category  B  program  with \nrespect  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998);  no  separate  framework  or  plans  for \nindigenous peoples will be prepared. Necessary actions favorable to indigenous peoples will be \ntaken  through  the  resettlement  framework  and  resettlement  plans.  For  future  subprojects,  the \nSPS will apply. \n\nG. \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n89. \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe investment program involves the following assumptions and risks: \n\nlandholding \n\nresettlement.  Customary \n\nShortage  of  civil  works  contractors.  The  implementation  of  the  proposed \nairport  infrastructure  works  will  be  affected  by  the  lack  of  capable  international \nand  national  contractors.  The  Government  is  fully  aware  of  the  issues  and  is \nresponding  by  (a)  ensuring  the  safety  of  international  contractors  through  the \nprovincial governments, (b) improving the licensing and classification of national \ncontractors,  and  (c)  providing  opportunities \nto  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises in the construction industry. \nLand  acquisition  and \nin  PNG \ncomplicates  and  prolongs  the  process  of  land  acquisition.  Where  required,  the \nCAA  will  negotiate  a  memorandum  of  agreement  with  the  affected  clans  and \ncommunities  (local  government)  to  allow  the  use  of  land  for  airport  upgrading \nwhile the formal acquisition process is fulfilled.  \nSecurity. Security in PNG continues to be an issue with contractors working on \nongoing infrastructure projects, including roads. The CAA, with the support of the \nprovincial governments, must deal with this issue. \nInstitutional capacity. The investment program needs good institutions. Strong \nmanagement  and  governance,  good  planning,  best-practice  concepts,  sound \nproject  management,  fiduciary  oversight,  and  transparent  bidding  and  contract \nmanagement processes require not only experienced personnel but also efficient \nsystems and procedures and controls. \nFinancing.  ADB will provide the necessary funding for capital expenditure, but \nthe  main  issue  in  the  long  run  will  be  maintenance  and  repairs.  For  this,  there \nmust  be  a  recurrent  budget  allocation.  Budget  allocations  in  the  past  were \nhaphazard,  and,  in  the  continuing  economic  downturn,  economic  and  financial \nconditions  within  and  outside  the  country  could  deteriorate,  thereby  restricting \ngrowth and development. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n90. \nundertakings: \n \n\nV. \n\nUNDERTAKINGS AND ASSURANCES \n\nSpecific  undertakings.  The  Government  and  the  CAA  have  agreed  to  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nto implement, monitor, and evaluate the facility in the context of the design and \nmonitoring framework for the facility;  \nto provide its share of funding for the investment program in accordance with the \nfinancing plan and the implementation schedule, as well as provide for any cost \noverruns  in  excess  of  the  contingencies  of  this  investment  program  and  the \nprojects; \nfor  every  subproject,  to  fully  implement,  as  required,  the  environmental \nassessment and review framework and the resettlement framework;   \nto  ensure  that  the  CAA  (a)  undertakes  annual  airport  safety  audits  of  all \ninvestment  program  airports,  and  (b)  installs  appropriate  airport  safety  facilities \nduring project implementation, including pavement markings, warning signs, and \nhazard barriers;  \nto  ensure  that  the  necessary  and  qualified  staff  are  engaged  throughout  the \ninvestment  program period, and that the CAA establishes and implements on a \ntimely basis the operational and financial management system, and awards and \nmanages  the  long-term  maintenance  contracts,  all  with  assistance  under  the \ninvestment program;   \nnotwithstanding  item  (ii)  above,  in  the  event  of  any  shortfall  in  maintenance \nfunds,  to  meet  such  shortfall  from  its  own  budgetary  resources,  and  from  a \nregular review of tariffs, including passenger terminal fees;  \n\n(viii) \n\n(vii)  with  the  support  of  the  investment  program  support  consultants  and  resources \nfrom  other  development  partners\u2019  programs  (e.g.,  the  AusAID  TSSP),  to \nundertake  capacity  development  for  the  CAA,  Papua  New  Guinea  Air  Services \nLtd and other  affiliated institutions operating in the civil aviation sector;  \nto ensure that a project performance monitoring system for the facility and each \ntranche is developed, with reports prepared for each tranche; and   \nto  ensure  that  (a)  the  investment  program  is  carried  out  in  compliance  with  all \napplicable  PNG  anticorruption  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy; \n(b) all  staff  of  the  CAA  and  subsidiary  companies  are  trained  in  PNG\u2019s \nanticorruption  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy;  and  (c)  a  CAA \nwebsite  is  developed  and  maintained  to  disclose  the  audited  annual  project \naccounts, project progress, and procurement activities. \n\n(ix) \n\n \n91. \nSpecific assurances. In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the \nCAA have agreed to give the following assurances with respect to project 1, and to include such \nassurances in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\nEnvironment.  The  Government,  through  the  PIU,  will  ensure  that  (a) the \ninvestment program is carried out in accordance with the project design, and that \nconstruction and operations comply with all the applicable  environmental laws of \nthe  Government  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy; \n(b) the  environmental \nmanagement program (EMP) as presented in the IEE is updated during the final \ndesign  of  the  project  facility  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  before  the \nissuance of relevant bidding documents to any interested civil work contractors; \n(c) the environmental mitigation measures specified in the EMP are incorporated \n\n\f23 \n\nto \n\ntraining \n\nis  provided \n\ninto the bidding documents, and the civil works contractor\u2019s specifications include \nrequirements to comply with the environmental mitigation measures contained in \nthe EMP; (d) civil works contractors are closely supervised to ensure compliance; \n(e) the  investment  program  undertakes  environment  monitoring  and  reflects  the \nresults in the project progress reports and project completion report; (f) adequate \nenvironmental  management  and  monitoring \nthe \nenvironment officer of the CAA to increase his or her capacity for environmental \nsupervision and monitoring during construction and operations; and (g) adequate \nsupport is provided to the environment specialist of CAA to ensure that he or she \nproperly undertakes the tasks. \nLand acquisition and resettlement. The Government and CAA will ensure that \nall  investment  program  civil  works  for  upgrading  airports  are  undertaken  within \nthe  existing  airport  boundary  to  the  extent  possible.  In  the  event  of  any \nunforeseen  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  needs,  the  Government  will  inform \nADB and prepare and implement a resettlement plan. The resettlement plans will \nbe  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  program  resettlement  framework,  which \ncomplies  with  the  relevant  PNG  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). The Government will allocate adequate resources to \nprepare  and  implement  the  resettlement  plan  and  supervise  and  monitor  its \nimplementation.  The  Government,  through  CAA,  will  ensure  that  (a) land \nacquisition  does  not  commence  before  the  resettlement  plan  or  due  diligence \nreport  is  reviewed  and  approved  by  ADB;  (b) civil  works  do  not  start  until  the \naffected  people  identified  in  the  resettlement  plan  or  due  diligence  report  have \nbeen  compensated  at  replacement  value  for  their  losses  due  to  the  program; \n(c) the  resettlement  plan  is  updated  after  the  completion  of  detailed  design, \nagreed  on  with  ADB,  and  disclosed  to  the  affected  people;  and  (d) all \ncompensation is paid in a legal and transparent manner before taking possession \nof  the  acquired  land,  structures,  and  other  assets.  The  Government  will  finance \nall land acquisition and resettlement costs from its resources. \nGender  and  development.  CAA  will  (a) encourage  contractors  to  employ \nwomen  in  airport  and  market  upgrading  works  such  as  for  management  and \nengineering  works,  (b) provide  equal  pay  to  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal \ntype  in  accordance  with  national  laws  and  international  treaty  obligations,  and \n(c) provide  safe  working  conditions  for  both  male  and  female  workers.  Specific \nprovisions to this effect will be included in the bidding documents for civil works. \nThe  CAA  will  review  the  achievement  of  hiring  women  in  the  project  progress \nreports and project completion report. \nEthnic minorities. The Government will ensure that the program does not have \nany adverse impact on the livelihood of ethnic minorities living in the project area. \nIn  the  event  of  any  unforeseen  impact  on  the  livelihood  of  ethnic  minorities, \n(a) the  Government  will  inform  ADB  and  prepare  a  plan  according  to  relevant \nlaws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples,  and  (b) civil \nworks will not start until ADB has reviewed and approved the plan. \nHealth risks. The Government, through the CAA, will ensure that all civil works \ncontractors participate in the STI and HIV prevention program to be funded under \nthe  project  in  the  construction  campsites.  In  addition,  the  CAA  will  ensure  that \nsimilar  information  on  the  risk  of  transmission  of  STI  and  HIV/AIDS  is \ndisseminated  at  the  worksites  and  local  communities,  in  coordination  with \nnational  and  provincial  aids  councils  and  local  nongovernment  organizations \nworking on the issue. The CAA will include specific provisions to this effect in civil \nworks contracts, and strictly monitor compliance. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n(vi) \n\nLabor  laws.  The  Government,  through  the  CAA,  will  ensure  that  civil  works \ncontractors comply with all applicable labor laws and related international treaty \nobligations,  and  do  not  employ  child  labor  or  trafficked  labor  for  any  activities. \nThe  CAA  will  ensure  that  specific  provisions  to  this  effect  are  included  in  civil \nworks contracts, and strictly monitor compliance. \n\n(vii)  Grievance and redress mechanism. Within 3 months of the loan effectiveness \ndate,  the  Government  shall  establish  a  complaint  and  problem  management \nmechanism under a neutral agency acceptable to ADB to (a) review and address \ngrievances of project stakeholders, in relation to the investment program, any of \nthe service providers, or any person responsible for carrying out the investment \nprogram;  and  (b)  set  the  threshold  criteria  and  procedures  for  handling  such \ngrievances, \nthe \nthem,  and \nstakeholders with notice of the chosen mechanism or action. \n\nfor  proactively  responding \n\nfor  providing \n\nto \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Counterpart funding. The Government will provide, on a timely basis, all funds \nand  resources  necessary  for  upgrading,  rehabilitation,  maintenance,  land \nacquisition  costs,  and  compensation  for  assets  and  management  of  the  project \nfacilities financed under the investment program. \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  CAA  will  put  in  place  specific  performance \nmeasures  to  monitor  a  reduction  in  expenditure  and  an  increase  in  cash  flow. \nSpecifically,  an  operating  ratio  measure  and  an  accounts  receivable  efficiency \nmeasure  will  be  included  in  the  legal  documents.  The  target  benchmark  for  the \noperating  ratio  measure  will  be  to  achieve  a  reduction  in  the  FY2008  operating \nratio  of  at  least  20%  by  2011.  The  benchmark  for  the  accounts  receivable \nefficiency measure will be no more than 70 days by 2012. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n92. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $480,000,000 equivalent (the facility amount) to Papua New Guinea for \nthe Civil Aviation Development Investment Program comprising: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nloans  in  various  currencies  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $480,000,000  in \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  interest  and \nother  terms  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the  then  applicable  policies \nrelating to Special Funds resources and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  Framework  Financing \nAgreement presented to the Board, subject to the conditions set out in paragraph \n46 of this report; and \nloans  in  an  aggregate  amount  not  exceeding  the  balance  of  the  facility  amount \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  and  other  terms  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)\u2013based  lending  facility  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  Framework  Financing \nAgreement presented to the Board. \n\n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n29 October 2009 \n\n\f \n\n \nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nEconomic growth and \npoverty reduction in project \nareas  \n \n\nOutcome \nSafer, more efficient, and \nmore accessible all-weather \nair transport services in the \nproject area \n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nTable A1.1: Investment Program \n\n \nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators \n\n \nBy 2020 \n5% average annual  \neconomic growth in \nproject areas a \n20% decrease in the \nnumber of people below \nthe poverty line in \nproject areas b \n20% increase in the \nincome of formal and \nnonformal vendors from \nvisitors in project areas c\n \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms  \n\n \n \nDevelopment partners\u2019 \ncountry reports \nGovernment \nsocioeconomic \nmonitoring reports \nBaseline survey and \nmonitoring surveys at \ninception, midterm, and \ncompletion \n \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n \nAssumptions and Risks\n \nAssumptions \nContinued political \nstability  \n \nSufficient incentives for \ninvestment and growth in \nproduction \n \nRisk \nDeterioration in domestic \nand external economic \nand financial conditions, \nconstraining growth and \ndevelopment \n \nAssumptions \n\nICAO safety and \nsecurity audit reports \n\nCAA technical and \nannual reports \n\nPNGAL, PNGASL, ADL \nannual reports \n\nGovernment and CAA \ncounterpart funding \nprovided as planned \n\nSustainable financing \nand execution of \nmaintenance \n\nRisk \n\nDelay in airline expansion \nand fleet modernization \n\n \nBy 2018 (end of MFF) \n\n \n \n\nAll national airports \ncertified to meet ICAO \nsafety and security \nstandards \n\nSeven national airports \nsuitable for larger jet \naircraft \n\nGrowth in passenger \ndemand increased from \n3% to 5% annually and \nin freight demand \nincreased from 1% to \n3% annually \n\nAirport incidents (delays, \ndiversions, and \nclosures) due to safety \nor security decreased \nfrom an average of 4 per \nmonth to 1 per month \n\nOutputs \nA.

The lack of an extensive and safe road \nsystem has led to a significant reliance on aviation as a major transport mode for tourism and \nbusiness, exports and imports, domestic freight, and social cohesion.  \n\nB. \n\nSector Structure \n\nCivil aviation supports the socioeconomic development of the country by providing safe, \n2. \nefficient,  reliable,  sustainable,  and  affordable  aviation  services  and  infrastructure  to  facilitate \naccess to the country and improve the mobility of communities. The sector is also responsible \nfor  meeting  its  important  community  service  obligations  to  provide  access  to  noncommercial \ndestinations.  \n \n3. \nTwo key institutions administer, regulate, manage, and operate the civil aviation sector. \nThe  Department  of  Works,  Transport  and  Civil  Aviation  (DWTCA)  is  the  lead  agency  for \ntransport strategy and planning for all three modes of transport. Its responsibilities include the \nmonitoring  of  international  obligations,  the  negotiation  of  air  service  agreements,  economic \nregulation, the investigation of air accidents, and sector policy and planning. The Civil Aviation \nAuthority (CAA) is the main operational agency. Its responsibilities include airport development \nand  operations,  air  traffic  services,  and  property  development.  It  is  also  responsible  for  safety \nand security regulation and oversight, which conflicts with its operational responsibilities. \n \n4. \nThe market for air services consists of three major airlines: Air Niugini, Airlines PNG, and \nPacific  Blue.  The  three  airlines  compete  on  some  international  routes,  but  only  the  first  two \noperate domestic services. Both turboprop and jet aircraft operate on major routes to provincial \ncapitals,  but  only  turboprop  aircraft  operate  on  secondary  trunk  routes.  The  rural  market  is \npredominantly served by small aircraft as a feeder service. Other air operators in PNG provide \ncharters, surveys, flight training, and industry-specific operations.  \n \n5. \nPrivate  sector  and  government  commercial  stakeholders  include  airlines,  charter  and \nprivate air operators, airport concessionaires and tenants, tourist operators, air cargo operators, \nmaintenance  organizations,  and  flight  training  organizations.  Other  stakeholders  include \ngovernment  agencies  responsible \nimmigration,  and  security; \ninternational  airline  associations;  and  international  organizations  responsible  for  global  safety \nand  security  monitoring.  In  addition,  PNG  is  a  member  of  the  Pacific  Islands  Civil  Aviation \nSafety and Security Treaty and uses the Pacific Aviation Safety Office, a nonprofit international \norganization, for technical services related to safety and security oversight. \n\nfor  customs,  quarantine, \n\nC. \n\nKey Issues and Constraints \n\n6. \nKey issues and constraints fall into two areas: infrastructure and finance, and institutions \nand  capacity.  In  terms  of  infrastructure,  aviation  facilities  are  extensive  but  capital  investment \nremains  inadequate  to  meet  the  future  needs  of  the  industry,  while  recurrent  expenditure  has \nfailed to keep up with maintenance requirements. In terms of institutions, the CAA is undergoing \na  well-planned  restructuring  but,  because  of  capacity  constraints,  is  struggling  to  execute  its \nmaintenance and investments to maintain compliance with safety and security standards.  \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n1. \n\nInfrastructure and Finance \n\n7. \nThere are more than 450 airports, airfields, and airstrips in PNG. Of this total, there are \n21 designated national airports.1 Most of the major airports and terminal facilities are owned and \noperated  on  behalf  of  the  Government  by  the  CAA  while  the  minor  airports  are  owned  by \nprovincial governments. There are some remote and district airfields and related facilities, which \nare privately owned and operated.  \n \nNational  airport  facilities  typically  (i)  lack  safety  and  security  compliance;  (ii) have \n8. \nair-side  pavements,  terminal  buildings,  equipment,  and  utilities  in  poor  condition;  (iii) have \npavements  in  accelerated  deterioration;  and  (iv) are  inadequately  maintained.  Air  navigation \nsystems  in  PNG  are  unreliable  and  deteriorating  because  of  (i) old  and  obsolete  equipment, \n(ii) lack of spare parts, (iii) theft and vandalism, (iv) unreliable power and communications, and \n(v) logistics problems. \n \n9. \nThe consequences of poor infrastructure and air navigation services include (i) canceled \nflights;  (ii) restricted  operations;  (iii)  higher  costs  to  airlines  due  to  reduced  payload  and  the \nneed  to  divert  flights;  and  (iv)  higher  costs  to  public  and  private  business  due  to  flight \ncancellations, rescheduling, and diversions. Airlines face the risk of airport closures and cannot \ninvest in future aircraft types; they may therefore have to reduce capacity into important tourism \nand  economic  regions,  with  consequent  adverse  effects  on  the  economy  and  social \ndevelopment. \n \n10. \nThe  civil  aviation  sector  derives  its  funding  primarily  from  Department  of  Treasury \nappropriations. DWTCA is entirely funded by the Government, and the CAA by a combination of \nrevenues from airport and airspace fees and charges, licensing and regulatory fees, and annual \nappropriations from government based on a community service obligation policy in the National \nTransport  Development  Plan  (NTDP)  2006\u20132010.  These  sources  have  not  delivered  sufficient \nor timely funds to arrest the decline in airport and airways infrastructure and equipment.  \n \n11. \nThe CAA requires external funding to meet its obligations and execute its strategic plan, \nas  it  does  not  have  the  financial  capacity  required  to  adequately  fund  safety  and  security \nmaintenance or the capital investment required for the significant remedial and upgrading work \nneeded to meet both existing and future airport needs. The Government\u2019s competing priorities \nfor funds and fiscal strategies have resulted in significant annual underfunding of the CAA over \nmany years.  \n \n12.  Most  external  assistance  to  date  has  been  provided  by  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development (AusAID) through funding for strategic studies, specialist advisers to \nthe  Government  and  the  CAA\u2019s  small  and  medium-sized  infrastructure  projects,  and  the \nprocurement  of  equipment.  There  have  been  no  large  investments  in  the  sector  from  other \nexternal sources. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is currently advising the Government in \nregard to the establishment of a public\u2013private partnership framework.  \n\n                                                 \n1   Buka,  Chimbu,  Daru,  Goroka,  Gurney,  Hoskins,  Kavieng,  Kerema,  Kiunga,  Madang,  Mendi,  Momote,  Mt  Hagen, \n\nNadzab, Popendetta, Port Moresby, Tari, Tokua, Vanimo, Wapenamanda, and Wewak.  \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n33 \n\n2. \n\nInstitutions and Capacity \n\n13. \nThe  aviation  sector  is  facing  institutional  capacity  issues  at  many  levels.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  aviation  strategies  are  demanding,  but  there  are  insufficient  skills  and  depth  of \nexperience in all the delivery areas for successful implementation.  \n \n14. \nThe CAA is charged with operating, managing, and developing the national airports. In \naccordance  with  government  policies  to  facilitate  efficient  and  effective  delivery  of  services, \nimprove  financial  performance,  and  achieve  a  clear  separation  of  regulatory  and  operational \nfunctions,  the  CAA  is  currently  undergoing  restructuring  from  CAA  to  the  National  Airports \nCorporation, which will operate as a holding company of three autonomous business units (PNG \nAirports  Ltd.  [PNGAL],  PNG  Air  Services  Ltd.  [PNGASL],  and  Airport  City  Development  Ltd. \n[ADL]).  All  three  have  been  formally  established,  but  only  PNGASL  has  become  operational. \nThe CAA\u2019s strategic plan calls for the restructuring to be completed in 2009. \n \n15. \nPNGAL  will  have  responsibilities  to  commercially  operate,  manage,  and  maintain  Port \nMoresby\u2019s  Jackson\u2019s  International  Airport,  and  to  manage,  develop,  and  operate  the  other \nnational  airports.  PNGASL  operates  as  a  commercial  entity  providing  air  navigation  services. \nADL  is  a  real  estate  management,  property  development,  and  project  management  company \nintended to enhance the financial viability of airports and related infrastructure by developing the \nbusiness portfolios of the restructured CAA and its subsidiaries. \n \n16. \nRegulatory  oversight  of  safety  and  security  is  currently  undertaken  by  the  air  safety \nregulations  branch  within  the  CAA.  The  transition  to  an  independent  safety  regulator  will  put \nmore emphasis on the separation of regulatory functions from service delivery, as well as more \nemphasis on cost recovery and viability. The Government will continue to fund safety regulation \nthrough  annual  statutory  grants,  offset  by  service  fees  and  charges.  Accident  and  incident \ninvestigations will continue to be undertaken by the DWTCA\u2019s accident investigation center. \n \n17. \nA  key  issue  in  the  transition  is  the  capacity  to  deliver  a  final  structure  and  functional \ncapacity  that  meets  the  expected  outcomes.  There  is  also  concern  at  the  effectiveness  of  the \nexisting  structures  for  coordination  and  collaboration  between  the  policy  functions  within \nDWTCA and the business and service delivery functions of the CAA and eventually the National \nAirports Corporation. \n\nD. \n\nGovernment Policies and Strategies \n\nThe  MTDS  has  seven  priorities, \n\n18. \nThe  Government\u2019s  transport  policies  are  the  Medium  Term  Development  Strategy \n(MTDS)  2005\u20132010  and  the  more-detailed  NTDP  2006\u20132010.  These  documents  contain  the \noverarching  policies,  objectives,  and  actions  that  guide  the  development  and  operation  of  the \ntransport sector. Both are currently undergoing review, with completion expected within 2009.  \n \n19. \n\u201crehabilitation  and \nmaintenance of transport infrastructure.\u201d This particular priority is seen as essential to sustaining \ntrade  and  access,  and  underpinning  PNG\u2019s  future  development  and  economic  growth  and \nprosperity.  \n \n20. \nThe NTDP vision for the aviation sector includes (i) competition on domestic routes and \naccess  to  these  routes  by  foreign  airlines;  (ii) the  operation  of  larger  aircraft  at  major  national \nairports;  (iii) accessible,  safe  reliable,  efficient,  and  affordable  air  transport;  (iv) improved  and \nreasonably  priced  international  services  to  establish  PNG  as  a  gateway  between  continents; \nand (v) lower-cost and safer passenger and cargo movements. The NTDP has proposed major \n\nimportantly \n\nincluding \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ninvestments  at  six  national  airports  (Gurney,  Madang,  Mount  Hagen,  Nadzab,  Tokua,  and \nWewak) to facilitate growth and eventual competition on domestic routes.  \n \n21. \nA key objective of the NTDP is the reform of the CAA to become self-sufficient and fund \nmuch of the remedial airport and airways maintenance. The CAA strategic plan was prepared in \naccordance  with  the  MTDS  and  NTDP  policies  and  priorities.  The  key  objectives  are  (i) in  the \nshort  term,  to  attend  to  critical  safety  and  security  requirements  and  implement  structural \nreform;  (ii) in  the  medium  term,  to  facilitate  economic  and  social  development  through \nsustainable  aviation  infrastructure;  and  (iii) in  the  long  term,  to  realize  an  acceptable  rate  of \nreturn on investments. \n\nE. \n\nGaps and Opportunities \n\n22. \nThe  main  issue  for  the  CAA  is  to  achieve  certification  of  all  national  airports  through \ntargeted  investments  in  rehabilitation,  maintenance,  and  equipment.  This  work  is  urgently \nrequired  to  maintain  access  throughout  the  country.  In  the  medium  term,  a  second  important \nissue is to upgrade about one-third of the national airports to accept larger aircraft and thereby \neliminate  transport  bottlenecks,  accommodate  airline  expansion  investment  programs,  and \nenable growth outside of Port Moresby. However, the CAA and its subsidiary units face a clear \nfunding gap in achieving this vision. The investment program will address this funding gap. \n \n23. \nRelated to these issues is the difficulty in achieving the Government\u2019s policy for the CAA \nand subsidiary units to achieve operating cost recovery. In the near term, this is possible only at \nPort  Moresby\u2019s  Jackson\u2019s  International  Airport,  which  is  also  the  only  airport  that  would  be \nattractive  to  private  investors,  probably  via  a  public\u2013private  participation  model.  A  very-limited \nnumber  of  other  airports  could  achieve  full  operational  cost  recovery  over  the  investment \nprogram period. The rest of the national airports will not be commercially viable and will have a \nsignificant  negative  impact  on  the  CAA\u2019s  annual  financial  performance  and  ability  to  fund \ninvestment programs. The investment program will facilitate economic growth, a commensurate \nincrease  in  traffic  through  eventual  competition  on  domestic  routes  (among  other  means), \nregular  reviews  of  landing  charges  and  terminal  fees,  and  prudent  operating  and  capital \nexpenditure to help achieve this objective. \n.  \n24. \nOn  the  institutional  side,  the  capacity  of  the  CAA  and  its  subsidiary  units  to  fully \nimplement  the  planned  restructure  in  an  effective  and  timely  manner  is  still  developing.  The \naviation  policies  and  strategies  being  pursued  by  the  Government  are  very  demanding  in \nimplementation and will involve the successful coordination of a number of stakeholders. There \nis a resource gap in experienced and qualified staff to meet the Government\u2019s objectives. The \ncreation of an independent safety regulator faces similar constraints. Some advisory support for \npolicy  development  and  administration  is  being  provided  by  AusAID  through  the  Transport \nSector  Support  Program.  The  investment  program  will  provide  continuous  strategy  and \nimplementation  assistance,  funded  through  the  loan,  to  increase  ownership,  develop  capacity, \nand improve control through government systems. \n\nF. \n\nSector Road Map \n\n25. \nTo  put  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  into  operation,  the  CAA  has  developed  the \nInfrastructure  Investment  Plan\u2013Long  Term  (2010\u20132030),  which  has  been  endorsed  by  the \nNational Executive Committee as the sector plan. The plan has five main components: (i) safety \nand  security  infrastructure  requirements  for  compliance  with  ICAO  standards;  (ii) remedial \nmaintenance  work  to  repair  air-side  pavements  and  improve  infrastructure  to  provide  for \nunrestricted  all-weather  services  by  existing \nto  selected  national  airports; \n(iii) improved  national  airport  infrastructure  to  provide  access  for  future  larger  and  heavier \n\njet  aircraft \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n35 \n\naircraft; (iv) upgraded air traffic management system, radar, and surveillance equipment for the \nPort  Moresby  flight  information  region  and  instrument  landing  systems  for  the  Jackson\u2019s \nInternational Airport; and (v) sector-wide policy initiatives to support efficient and cost-effective \ntransport of travelers and freight cargo. \n \n26. \nThe required investments for the sector plan from 2010 to 2030 were originally planned \nby  the  CAA  over  20  years  because  of  financing  and  capacity  constraints.  The  total  required \nsector investment is estimated at K1.710 billion, as shown in Table A2.1.  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Investment and Maintenance Requirements for National Airports \n(K million/$ million) \n2012\u2013\n2015\n\n2010\u2013\n2011 \n\n2016\u2013\n2020\n\n2021\u2013\n2025\n\n2026\u2013\n2030 \n\nTotal \n\n260 \n50 \n54 \n\n24 \n81 \n85 \n\n40 \n110 \n46 \n\n24 \n47 \n48 \n\n75 \n80 \n25 \n\n21 \n43 \n44 \n\n75 \n20 \n58 \n\n10 \n36 \n36 \n\n50 \n30 \n142 \n\n \n47 \n49 \n\n500 \n290 \n325 \n\n79 \n254 \n263 \n\n \nActivity \nUpgrade to B737  \nImprove to F100  \nRehab for \nCertification  \nEquipment \nContingencies \nDesign and \nSupervision  \nTotal (K) \nTotal ($) \n\n234 \n75.1 \nSources: Civil Aviation Authority and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n554 \n177.3 \n\n315 \n101.0 \n\n288 \n92.3 \n\n318 \n101.9 \n\n1,710 \n547.6 \n\nAccording  to  the  CAA,  if  external  assistance  can  help  ease  its  constraints,  the  sector \n\n \n27. \nplan can be implemented in 9 years, as shown in Table A2.2.  \n \n\nTable A2.2: Sector Plan Components and Sequencing \n\nPhase II\n\nNadzab \n(runway upgrade, security \nfence) \n\nPhase III\nMount Hagen, Stage 2 \n(runway upgrade) \n\nPhase IV\n\nBuka \n(runway repair) \n\nPhase I \nPort Moresby \n(domestic apron, air traffic \ncontrol equipment, fire tenders) \n \nMount Hagen, Stage 1 \n(runway repair, new terminal) \n \nHoskins Stage 1 \n(runway repair, security fence) \n \nWewak Stage 1 \n(runway repair, security fence) \n \nGurney Stage 1 \n(runway repair, security fence) \n \nKavieng \n(security fence) \n \nGoroka \n(security fence) \n\nSource: Civil Aviation Authority.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMadang \n(runway repair) \n\nKavieng \n(runway repair) \n\nGoroka \n(runway repair) \n\nTokua \n(runway repair) \n\nMomote \n(security fence) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWewak Stage 2 \n(runway upgrade) \n\nMadang Stage 2 \n(runway upgrade) \n\nHoskins Stage 2 \n(runway upgrade) \n\nGurney Stage 2 \n(runway upgrade) \n\nChimbu \n(runway repair) \n\nKiunga \n(runway repair) \n\nVanimo \n(runway repair) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGirua \n(runway repair) \n\nMendi \n(runway repair) \n\nKieta \n(runway repair) \n\nWapenamanda \n(runway repair) \n \nKerema \n(runway repair) \n \nDaru \n(runway repair) \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nG. \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s  country  assistance  strategy2  supports  the  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s \n28. \nMTDS 2005\u22122010,  in  which  the  transport  sector  is  one  of  four  main  strategic  areas  for  ADB \nengagement.  The  NTDP 2006\u20132010  articulates  goals  for  the  sector  including  maintenance, \nrehabilitation,  and  improved  infrastructure  for  roads,  ports,  and  airports;  and  adherence  to \nminimum  safety  standards.  Another  key  issue  is  the  reform  of  state-owned  enterprises, \nincluding the CAA. The restructuring of the CAA is under way, and can be consolidated through \nimplementation assistance and technical assistance for capacity building.  \n \n29. \nAs proposed, the Civil Aviation Development Investment Program will finance about 85% \nof  the  sector  plan.  It  will  address  financing  and  capacity  constraints  so  that  the  urgent  airport \nimprovements  can  be  implemented  fully  within  the  planned  program  duration  of  9  years.  The \nproposed sequencing of works matches the CAA\u2019s priorities in the sector plan. The investment \nprogram is included in the updated Country Operations Business Plan 2009\u20132011.3 \n \nThe  investment  program  is  proposed  for  financing  under  ADB\u2019s  multitranche  financing \n30. \nfacility (MFF). This financing modality suits the investment program because it (i) supports the \nGovernment\u2019s  and  the  CAA\u2019s  long-term  vision  for  the  sector,  (ii) responds  to  long-term \ninvestment and capacity development needs, (iii) enables a long-term partnership to consolidate \nsector  reforms,  (iv) provides  flexibility  in  timing  and  investment  size  for  each  tranche, \n(v) provides an opportunity to apply lessons from early tranches to guide subsequent tranches \nand  improve  incentives  for  reforms  and  implementation  efficiency,  and  (vi) provides  increased \ncertainty  to  private  companies  interested  in  pursuing  long-term  opportunities  in  the  aviation \nsector. \n\nH. \n\nExpected Outcomes and Indicators \n\nThe  expected  impact  of  the  investment  program  will  be  a  civil  aviation  sector  that \n31. \nsupports  the  MTDS  2005\u20132010  objectives  of  (i) economic  growth,  (ii) rural  development, \n(iii) poverty reduction, and (iv) human resource development. The outcomes of the program will \nbe infrastructure and supporting institutions for civil aviation that are accessible, safe, reliable, \nand cost-effective.

In  addition  to  accessibility  to  government,  health,  community,  and \nlaw-and-order  services,  airports  are  increasingly  providing  access  to  mobile  communications \nfacilities required to provide reliable service throughout the country.  \n \nThe deterioration of airport infrastructure and ground navigation aids in the last decade \n2. \nhas  begun  to  affect  the  PNG  economy  by  increasing  air  service  operating  costs  and  reducing \nthe  safety  of  air  services.  Failure  to  reverse  these  adverse  trends  will  lead  to  restrictions  on \nsome  airport  operations,  the  provision  of  air  services  by  smaller  aircraft,  a  reduction  in  air \nservice  frequency,  and  in  some  cases  the  cessation  of  regular  passenger  transport  (RPT) \noperations into the worst-affected airports.  \n \n3. \nThe  investment  program  will  help  PNG  address  its  need  for  continuous  domestic  air \nservice  operations  to  its  dispersed  communities  and  for  mobile  communications  infrastructure \nthrough  urgently  needed  upgrading  and  improvements  in  the  highest-priority  airports.  Aviation \nsector  safety  in  compliance  with  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  standards  will  be \nimproved and regional economic growth stimulated through construction activity and economic \ngrowth in local communities. \n\nB. \n\nTraffic Forecasts \n\nDomestic RPT air services are provided by two air service operators\u2014Air Niugini (ANG) \n4. \nand  Airlines  of  Papua  New  Guinea  (APNG).  ANG,  the  dominant  operator,  uses  5  Fokker  100 \n(F100)  planes,  a  100-seat  regional  jet  aircraft,  and  8  De  Havilland  DHC-8  (Dash  8)  turboprop \nregional  airliners,  seating  30\u201340  passengers  in  the  100  and  200  series  aircraft  and \n50 passengers  in  the  stretched  300  series.  APNG  operates  a  fleet  of  15  Dash  8  aircraft, \nincluding 8 of the smaller 100 and 200 series and 7 of the stretched 300 series.  \n \n5. \nRoute  traffic  records  are  maintained  essentially  for  aviation  sector  fee  charging \npurposes, and aggregation of the data for statistical purposes is limited. Data were aggregated \nfor  ANG  and  APNG,  which  represent  some  54%  of  aircraft  movements,  and  a  higher  90%  of \npassengers and freight handled through the seven project 1 airports. The aggregated data are \nconsidered to provide a reliable trend pattern for traffic forecasting.

Generally,  there  is  a  strong \nunderlying growth trend  in aviation sector activity, involving a 7.5% trend in passenger growth \nand 2% growth in aircraft movements. Because of the small relative size of RPT operations in \nPNG,  aircraft  change  to  larger-capacity  aircraft  can  have  a  distorting  effect  on  steady  aircraft \nmovement growth at individual airports. \n\nC. \n\nMethodology \n\n7. \nThe methodology used follows the standard practice of comparing economic costs and \nbenefits  with  and  without  the  project,  using  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  and  EIRR \nsensitivities to further increases in costs and decreases in benefits as decision criteria. \n \n8. \nA  20-year  evaluation  period  was  used  and  the  residual  value  at  the  end  of  this  period \nwas assumed to be zero. The benefits and costs of the project occur as an annual stream, at \ndifferent  points  in  time,  as  benefits  start  after  expenditure  has  been  completed.  All  costs  and \nbenefits used for the analysis are in 2009 values. \n\nD. \n\nCosts  \n\n9. \nThe financial costs of the subprojects consist of all incremental capital expenditures, but \nexclude  price  contingencies  and  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction.  The \nincremental  operation  and  maintenance  costs  of  the  project  facilities  were  estimated  on  the \nbasis of cost parameters developed by the consultant. The project\u2019s economic costs include the \nresource  costs  for  traded  and  non-traded  costs,  materials,  and  labor.  All  cost  elements  are \nvalued at border prices, with all taxes and duties excluded. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 \nwas applied to the financial costs of non-traded inputs to calculate economic prices. Table A9.2 \npresents the economic costs for each airport. Project facilities are expected to have an average \neconomic life of 20 years. \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n53 \n\nE. \n\nBenefits \n\n10. \nThe project is primarily aimed at improving aviation operations and safety standards by \nrehabilitating  existing  facilities  to  cater  to  current  aircraft  types  (F100),  including  runways, \ntaxiways,  aprons;  airfield  drainage  and  maintenance,  operational,  and  terminal  facilities;  and \nnavigation  equipment.  To  measure  project  benefits,  the  willingness-to-pay  approach  has  been \napplied  to  estimate  incremental  aviation  revenues  for  air-side  and  land-side  operations.  Other \neconomic  benefits  considered  for  economic  analysis  are  (i)  aircraft  operating  cost  savings \naccrued  from  non-incremental  movement  of  aircraft;  (ii)  passenger  time  savings  accrued  from \nnon-incremental movement of aircraft; (iii) benefits from safety improvements; and (iv) benefits \nto  regional  and  local  communities  from  construction  activity,  market  sales,  and  increased \ntourism.  A  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9  was  applied  to  the  financial  value  of  benefits  to \ncalculate their economic value.  \n \n11. \nThe benefits to operators are significant in terms of improvements in aircraft productivity \nresulting from a reduction in air operating time due to landing delays, as well as a reduction in \ndowntime  for  maintenance  through  the  elimination  of  costs associated with  damage  to  aircraft \n(external  instruments,  wing  flaps,  propeller  blades,  engines)  caused  by  flying  stones  from \ndeteriorated sealed runways; and a reduction in  costs for braking systems and tire replacement \ndue  to  a  longer  operational  life  of  braking  systems  and  tires.  Airline  savings  would  also  arise \nfrom  the  elimination  of  flight  delay  direct  costs  (e.g.,  having  to  accommodate  overnight  crews \nand  passengers  at  a  regional  airport  after  an  aircraft  was  made  \u201cnonoperational\u201d  on  landing \nwhen damage to brakes, tires, or undercarriage, for example, occurred); the cost of relocating \nreplacement  aircrafts;  and  the  associated  cost  impact  on  national  flight  schedules.  The \ninvestment program subprojects will also diminish the risk and economic costs of accidents or \nother  incidents  caused  by  poor  airstrip  conditions,  inadequate  airport  security  fencing,  and \ninoperative navigational and landing equipment. \n \nPassengers will benefit from improved arrival and departure reliability, savings in travel \n12. \ntime  (valued  in  terms  of  the  economic  value  of  time)  and  in  the  diminished  risk  of  flight \ncancellation or diversion, and safety improvements calculated on the basis of risk reduction of a \ncatastrophic accident.1 \n \n13. \nThe  confidence  of  passengers  is  currently  affected  by  reduced  seat  availability  at \nairports  where  runway  damage  causes  service  downgrade  to  smaller  aircraft,  safety  hazards, \nand a poor record of on-time arrivals and departures. \n \n14. \nIt  is  significant  to  recognize  that  in  PNG  air  safety  is  largely  controlled  through  RPT \nairline operating procedures and line captain in-flight decisions. Safety limitations, such as poor \nweather  forecasting  services,  outdated  airport  landing  profiles,  short  landing  fields,  and \nunsecured airport boundaries, are managed by air service operators, with consequential impact \non  their  aircraft  operational  costs.  While  major  aircraft  accidents  and  incidents  are  less  likely \nunder  these  operational  conditions,  airline  operational  costs  are  higher  as  a  consequence. \nUnsecured  airport  boundary  fences,  for  example,  are  managed  through  aircraft  procedures \ninvolving inspection overflights before landing. Short landing fields are accommodated by short \nfield  landing  and  takeoff  procedures  that  require  more-precise  pilot  judgment  and  control  and \nhigher aircraft operating costs.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  According  to  the  risk  factors  for  different  types  of  airfields,  the  current  risk  of  catastrophic  accident  would  be \n\nreduced by one accident in 10 million operating hours. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nIn  the  regions  and  local  communities,  other  than  direct  labor  benefits  related  to  airport \n15. \nconstruction  and  operation,  the  economy  could  enjoy  significant  second-round  benefits  from \nincreased market sales (at those airports where market facility is provided under the investment \nprogram) and tourism. Calculations have assumed that all airports will receive some incremental \nforeign  and  local  tourist  and  business  traffic  because  of  improved  and  reliable  air  service \naccess. All airports other than Port Moresby have significant attractive tourism resources, and \nall  have  business  potential  to  be  further  accessed.  A  forecast  based  on  conservative \nassumptions was developed to calculate benefits, assuming only 20% of incremental business \nand tourism expenditure represents the real cost of consumption of locally produced goods and \nservices  and  return  on  local  investments.  On  this  basis,  it  is  estimated  that  about  K400  per \ntourist and K227 per business visitor represents the real net benefit from these visitors arriving \nby  air.  The  long-term  benefits  to  the  community  are  conservative,  because  they  would  also \ninclude  the  unquantified  benefits  from  additional  employment  that  would  not  be  created  if  the \nairports had not been improved. \n \n16. \nA  conservative  approach  was  adopted  in  assessing  quantifiable  benefits  incorporated \ninto  the  economic  appraisal.  Incremental  financial  revenue  was  derived  from  the  financial \nanalysis, adjusted using a standard conversion factor of 0.9. Airline operating cost savings were \nassessed  on  the  basis  of  direct  aircraft  operating  cost  savings  of  10%  of  hourly  aircraft \noperating costs for F100, DASH 8 (100, 200, and 300 series), and Twin Otter aircraft, on a with \n(wet) and without (dry) aircrew basis, when improvement in terminal or airport apron movement \nwere involved. Passenger time cost savings were conservatively calculated assuming time cost \nsavings of 10 minutes valued at K14 per hour (weighted average salary of business and private \npassenger  average  salaries).  Safety  improvements  were  assessed  in  consultation  with  ANG \nand  APNG,  using  a  proxy  value  based  on  aircraft  operating  cost  savings  equivalent  to \n15 minutes  for  each  landing  at  airports  where  improved  security  was  provided  through  new \nsecurity  fencing.2  Regional  benefits  were  conservatively  assessed  on  the  basis  of  increased \nbusiness  and  tourist  passenger  spending  of  30%  and  20%  per  total  visit  expenditure, \nrespectively.3 \n\nF. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis \n\nThe  EIRR  for  the  seven  airports  and  Papua  New  Guinea  Air  Services  Limited  varies \n17. \nbetween  17.7%  and  507.2%,  with  a  consolidated  EIRR  of  45.3%,  indicating  that  project  1  is \neconomically viable (Table A9.2). \n \n\nTable A9.2: Summary of Economic Analyses \n\nProject 1 Airport Location \nPapua New Guinea Air Services Economic Analysis \nPort Moresby - Domestic Apron Extension and Fire Tenders \nMount Hagen: Airport Upgrade and Terminal \n\nEIRR \n86.2% \n22.9% \n18.9% \n\nNPV \n(K million) \n44.5 \n20.1 \n55.2 \n\n                                                 \n2  Time  savings  due  to  not  having  to  overfly  the  airfield  or  await  ground  confirmation  to  check  airport  runway  was \nclear  of  any  hazards  range  from  20  to  30  minutes  depending  on  weather  conditions,  time  of  day,  and  potential \nobstructions. Fifteen minutes was selected as a conservative figure. \n\n3  According  to  the  PNG  Tourism  Promotion  Authority\u2019s  visitor  expenditure  survey  in  2005  and  2007,  increased \nregional  expenditure  can  be  expected  because  (i) improved  airport  facilities  would  mean  more-reliable  and \nmore-frequent service, which in turn would increase the length of passenger stay in the region; (ii) the development \nof  market  facilities  at  airports  would  generate  increased  \u201cimpact\u201d  and  \u201cconvenience\u201d  expenditure  in  the  region  by \npassengers;  and  (iii) local  authorities  would  undertake  promotion  efforts  to  encourage  longer  visit  stay  and \nincreased visitor expenditure. \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n55 \n\nProject 1 Airport Location \nGoroka: Safety Fence \nGurney - Airport Upgrade \nHoskins - Airport Upgrade \nKavieng - Security Fencing \nWewak - Airport Upgrade and Safety Fence \nConsolidated - Airport Upgrade, Terminal and Fencing \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSources: Civil Aviation Authority and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nEIRR \n507.2% \n24.9% \n17.7% \n337.6% \n46.5% \n45.3% \n\nNPV \n(K million) \n82.0 \n15.0 \n16.8 \n98.0 \n49.9 \n390.8 \n\n \nIn  addition  to  the  base  case,  the  following  four  sensitivity  test  cases  were  examined: \n18. \n(i) the operation and maintenance costs increase by 20%, (ii) the benefits are reduced by 20%, \n(iii) the  operation  and  maintenance  costs  increase  by  20%  and  the  benefits  are  reduced  by \n20%,  and  (iv) the  construction  period  lengthens  by  1  year.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n \nThe  Government  of  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  adopted  the  Medium  Term  Development  Strategya  (MTDS)  2005\u2013\n1. \n2010  as  its  strategic  framework  to  promote  national  development.  The  overarching  goals  of  MTDS  2005\u20132010  are: \nexport-driven  economic  growth,  rural  development,  and  poverty  reduction,  through  good  governance  and  the  promotion  of \nagriculture,  forestry,  fisheries,  and  tourism  on  a  sustainable  basis,  among  other  means.  Papua  New  Guineans,  especially \nthose in rural areas, will be empowered to mobilize their own resources to improve their living standards. The key priorities for \nthe  period  to  2010  are:  (i)  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  of  transport  infrastructure,  (ii)  promotion  of  income-earning \nopportunities,  (iii) basic  education  and  adult  education,  (iv)  primary  health  care  and  HIV/AIDS  prevention,  and  (v) law  and \njustice.  \n \nThe  country  strategy  and  program  for  PNGb  2006\u22122010  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  supports  the \n2. \nGovernment in meeting its MTDS goals. ADB and the Government have agreed that the strategic areas that clearly satisfy the \nprinciples and lessons learned are: (i) public financial management, (ii) private sector development, (iii) the transport sector, \nand  (iv)  health  and  HIV/AIDS.  In  the  transport  sector,  the  Civil  Aviation  Development  Investment  Program  upgrading  of  21 \nnational airports is one of the top priorities of the Government.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General intervention \n1. Key Issues  \n \nPoverty  in  PNG  is  overwhelmingly  rural,  and  urban\u2013rural  income  disparities  are  widening,  as  are  disparities  between \ncommunities  within  and  outside  of  the  enclave  resource  projects.  Poverty  is  about  three  times  more  severe  in  rural  than  in \nurban areas, and varies in severity across rural regions, with about 75% of the poor living in the Sepik and Highlands regions. \nBetween 1996 and 2003, the number of Papua New Guineans living below $1 per day is estimated to have doubled from 1.1 \nto 2.2 million (World Bank Socio Impact Study 2007). The poverty headcount index, for the $1 poverty line, was about 39.4% \nin 2003, up from 24.6 % in 1996. An estimated 70% of the population now live on less than $2 per day, up from 54% in 1996 \n(provincial development data).  \n \nThe investment program will cover the upgrading of 21 airports nationwide, including Buka, Chimbu, Daru, Goroka, Gurney, \nHoskins, Kavieng, Kerema, Kiunga, Mendi, Momote, Madang, Mount Hagen, Lae (Nadzab), Popendetta, Port Moresby, Tari, \nTokua,  Vanimo,  Wapenamanda,  and  Wewak.  As  the  project  areas  have  nationwide  coverage,  the  investment  program  has \nthe  potential  to  affect  the  whole  population.  The  first  tranche,  which  covers  five  provinces  (National  Capital,  Western \nHighlands, East Sepik, West New Britain, and Milne Bay), has the potential to serve a population of up to 1,586,978 people. \n \nThe poverty levels in the five provinces under project 1 are shown below: \n \n\n \n \nProvince \nNational Capital \nWestern Highlands \nEast Sepik \nWest New Britain \nMilne Bay \nSource: Papua New Guinea Census 2000. \n\nHuman \nPoverty Index \n14.5 \n55.5 \n47.3 \n31.9 \n31.4 \n\nTable A10: Poverty Levels \nHuman \nDevelopment \nIndex \n0.758 \n0.282 \n0.304 \n0.394 \n0.420 \n\n \nGender-Related \nDevelopment \n0.506 \n0.261 \n0.282 \n0.388 \n0.387 \n\n \nAs shown in the table, the human poverty index in East Sepik and Western Highlands of the provinces are below the national \nhuman poverty index (39.4%). In addition to low incomes, a 2001 participatory poverty assessment (funded by ADB) clearly \nindicates the non-income dimensions of poverty in PNG: specifically, people consider themselves poor when they lack (i) jobs, \n(ii) land, (iii) education, (iv) services such as health and water, and (v) transport and roads. The most pressing needs are safe \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\ndrinking water and usable roads. While available data are limited and in need of updating, the risks of a rapid rise in poverty \nlevels in PNG are clear. The salient issues include: \n \n\n(i) \n\nIn 1997, 37% of the population lived below the poverty line of K461 per year. A further 17% of the population  was \nunable to meet the basic food requirement of 2,200 calories per day per adult equivalent. In terms of the international \npoverty line, one-quarter of the people in PNG lived on less than $1 a day; 54% lived on less than $2 a day. \n\n(ii)  Because  of  poor  economic  performance  combined  with  rapid  population  growth,  the  incidence  of  poverty  is \nestimated to have nearly doubled in the period 1996\u20132003 from 37.5% to 53.8%. It is estimated that 40% of the PNG \npopulation lived on less than $1 a day in 2003, while 70% were below the level of $2 a day. \n\n(iii)  Poverty is concentrated in rural areas. The rural poverty rate (41%) is significantly higher than the urban rate (16%). \nThe Highlands region, with 40% of the national population and a poverty rate (1996) of 38.3%, is one of the poorest \nregions in the country. \n\n(iv)  The highest poverty levels occur among households with little or no cash income, that is, families that rely primarily \non subsistence agriculture, hunting, gathering, and fishing to meet household consumption needs. However, poverty \nis also high among farmers that grow and sell tree and other cash crops. Overall, people involved in the agriculture \nsector account for 86% of the poor. \n\n(v)  Households headed by women are among the poorest in rural areas of PNG. \n\n \n2. Design Features  \n \nThe investment program will contribute to rural development and poverty reduction. Improved airport facilitates will increase \nthe mobility and access of people to markets and other natural resources. People living in the project areas will directly benefit \nfrom job opportunities through the required civil works and maintenance, market upgrading, and increase in various business \n(in particular, tourism) opportunities. The investment program design includes: (i) priorities for the employment of local men \nand  women  in  the  upgrading  of  airport  facilities  and  maintenance,  (ii)  the  upgrading  of  a  market  at  each  airport  site, \n(iii) contractor specifications for the provision of HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention programs for construction workers and \nneighboring communities, and (iv) an extensive community relations and participation program linked to different aspects of \ntranche  preparation  and  implementation  through  a  full-time  community  relations  officer  (CRO)  under  the  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU).  The  consultations  with  communities  during  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  strongly \nsupported market upgrading to directly benefit them. The primary beneficiaries of the program will be airport users and local \ncommunities  at  each  project  site  including  airport  market  vendors  (especially  women  selling  vegetables,  food,  and \nhandicrafts). The secondary beneficiaries would include public transport service industries and tourism-associated industries. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues \nThere  are  more  than  800  languages  in  PNG.  With  a  land  area  of  nearly  463,000  square  kilometers  and  a  population \nexceeding  6  million  (2007  estimate),  Papua  New  Guinea  is  the  largest  developing  country  in  the  South  Pacific  region.  The \npopulation is growing at an annual rate of about 2.7%, and nearly half of the population is 19 years of age or younger. Most \nPapua New Guineans live in rural communities based on traditional village social structures and dependent on subsistence \nagriculture supplemented by cash cropping. Less than 15% live in urban areas, although migration to cities and towns in the \npast decade has contributed to substantial urban unemployment and accompanying social problems. Livelihoods of people in \nthe project 1 airport site areas combine subsistence agriculture (sweet potatoes and tapioca), cash cropping (coffee, cocoa \nand coconut, and livestock raising (pigs and  chicken). Household incomes from sales of  agricultural products or  other  local \nmarket sales are generally very small. \n \nThroughout PNG (Highlands, Coastal, and Islands), people live on their clan territory. In the Highlands, small hamlets of 4\u201310 \nclosely related  households  (or  subclans)  are  more  common.  In  the  coastal  and  island  communities,  it  is  more  common  for \npeople from several clans to live together in villages. An extended family of 10\u201315 adults and their children will generally live \non at least 2\u20133 hectares and have up to 5 hectares of agricultural land. \n \nWhile primary enrollment is relatively high, retention of girls is a major problem. This was clearly evident in the socio-gender \neconomic  survey  findings  in  the  four  airport  site  communities.  Girls\u2019  share  of  the  secondary  school  enrollment  ratio  in  PNG \nwas  just  23%  in  2005,  and  only  1%  of  those  who  enter  grade  1  will  also  enter  a  tertiary  institution.  In  rural  situations,  high \nschools  are  often  residential  and  the  number  of  dormitory  spaces  limits  girls\u2019  educational  opportunities.  The  female  adult \nliteracy  rate  is  only  51%,  and  women\u2019s  ability  to  function  effectively,  gain  access  to  services,  and  support  their  families  is \nfurther constrained by the multilingual nature of the country. \n \nPNG  has  90%  of  the  HIV/AIDS  cases  in  the  Pacific  and  is  considered  to  have  a  full-blown  epidemic  with  case  numbers \nincreasing by 30% yearly. As of 2005, there were 14,276 cases of HIV/AIDS, more than half of which were women. There is a \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n59 \n\nhigh level of stigma attached to HIV/AIDS and to those who act as caregivers\u2014primarily women\u2014which inhibits testing and \nreporting (Papua New Guinea Pacific Gender Profile, 2008). Although the investment program will have a positive impact on \nPNG,  it  also  has  the  potential  to  increase  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  through  air  connectivity.  According  to  the  6-monthly \nsurveillance  reports  on  sexually  transmitted  infections  (STI)  and  HIV/AIDS  prepared  in  2008  by  the  National  Department  of \nHealth  and  funded  by  ADB,  the  number  of  reported  cases  by  gender  and  province  show  Western  Highlands  to  have  the \nhighest number (35.2%), followed by the National Capital District (16.7%), Eastern Highlands (13%), and Morobe (13%). The \nother airport provinces had the following reported cases: West New Britain, 0.1%; East Sepik Province, 2.9%; and Milne Bay, \n0.3%.  STI/HIV mitigation involving prevention and safety measures for construction workers and neighbor communities are \nincorporated in the design and implementation stages of the investment program. \n \nImproved  airports  are  expected  to  foster  rural  development,  reduce  poverty,  and  increase  accessibility  to  health  and \neducation  services.  It  is  envisaged  that  the  investment  program  will  result  in  the  lowering  of  airfares  because  of  increased \ncompetition and volume of travelers. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nAn  extensive  program  of  consultations,  women\u2019s  focus  group  discussions,  and  questionnaire  surveys  took  place  during  the \npreparation  of  the  investment  program.  An  initial  extensive  program  of  consultation  has  taken  place.  During  the  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  fact-finding  stage,  a  stakeholder  analysis  was  carried  out  to  identify  the  major  important \nstakeholders,  their  interest  in  the  proposed  program,  their  perceptions  of  current  problems  related  to  safety  and  security \nassociated with airport operations, passenger terminal logistics, and civil aviation services, and the resources they could bring \nto the achievement of goals and objectives of the program. Meetings have been held at the national level with Civil Aviation \nAuthority (CAA), Ministry of Transport (MOT), the Dept. of National Planning and Monitoring, the Dept. of Treasury, Air Niugini \nAirlines, Airlines of PNG, PNG Air Services Ltd., PNG Airports Ltd., and the Australian Agency for International Development \n(AusAID) and its Transport Sector Support Program (TSSP). \n \nAt  the  loan  preparation  stage,  another  stakeholder  analysis  was  carried  out  to  identify  the  secondary  stakeholders,  their \nsupport for the proposed program, their perceptions of current problems related to airport use and affordability, as well as their \ncurrent  benefits  and  potential  benefits  from  upgrading.  Further  consultations  were  organized  with  relevant  development \npartners  and  stakeholders  such  as  AusAID,  UN  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  international  NGOs \n(INGOs),  women\u2019s  groups,  and  community-based  organizations  (CBOs).  Community  consultation  meetings  were  organized \nwith  local  stakeholders  and  business  houses  in  Wewak  (East  Sepik  Province),  Hoskins  area  (West  New  Britain  Province), \nMount  Hagen  (Western  Highlands  Province),  and  Gurney  in  Alotau  (Milne  Bay  Province)  with  provincial  and  district \nadministrators participating. These meetings targeted current users and potential beneficiaries of the airport improvements to \nfind out their views on affordability and other social benefits. \n \nFor the  project 1 airports, the views of the communities  living close to the airports have  been sought through small sample \nsurveys of households (120 households), and the market and informal sectors (25 persons), as well a program of community \nconsultations in that brought together up to 20 people in each of 8 communities and women\u2019s focus groups (10\u201315  women \neach) in 8 villages. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nUnder  the  investment  program  PIU,  a  full-time  CRO  will  be  hired  and,  in  collaboration  with  the  environmental  officer,  will \nestablish  a  consultation  program  for  each  tranche  airport  project.  The  purpose  is  (i)  to  inform  communities  about  the \ninvestment program and, in detail, about the airport upgrading works; (ii) to provide information about the expected benefits \nand  potential  adverse  impact,  as  well  as  project  measures  such  as  compensation,  environmental  management,  and \ncommunity-based  initiatives;  (iii)  to  provide  a  platform  for  communities  to  participate  in  the  upgrade  and  express  their \ninterests,  preferences,  and  concerns;  and  (iv)  in  general,  to  facilitate  different  aspects  of  the  implementation  of  the  tranche \nprojects. Consultations with communities will take place at different points in the planning and implementation of subprojects \nand include: \n \n\nIn the initial stages of airport works preparation, the community liaison officer of the investment program PIU \nwill consult with communities as part of the process of confirming that the airport meets the eligibility criteria \nto  be  included  in  the  investment  program.  The  support  of  communities  is  a  key  criterion,  along  with \npreliminary assessments regarding the potential scope of additional land requirements, existing land tenure, \nand any other adverse social and environmental impact. \n\n(i) \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\nDuring  the  preparation  of  the  subsequent  tranches,  the  investment  program  will  organize  or  assist  other \nparties  (e.g.,  provincial  land  officers,  environmental  consultants)  in  organizing  various  consultations, \nawareness programs, and surveys that form part of the work (a) to conduct an environmental assessment of \nthe airport, and (b) to identify additional land requirements for the extension of airport runways and facilities, \nas needed, to prepare a resettlement plan. \nDuring  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  subsequent  tranches,  the  investment  program  will \norganize  or  assist  other  parties  (e.g.,  provincial  land  officers,  independent  monitoring  organization,  social \nmonitoring consultant) in organizing consultations, awareness programs, and surveys, which will also form \npart  of  the  work  on:  (a)  acquisition  of  additional  land,  (b)  independent  monitoring  of  land  acquisition \nactivities,  (c) environmental  monitoring  work,  and  (d)  baseline  and  follow-up  studies  as  part  of  the  social \nmonitoring study.  \nThroughout the work on all the tranches, the CRO or environment officers from the investment program will \nmeet periodically with communities to find out whether there are social, environmental, or other issues that \nrequire attention, for example, in relation to opportunities for community-based maintenance or resolution of \ngrievances. These consultations will occur according to a program agreed on with communities or on an ad \nhoc basis. \n\nConsultations with communities at airport locations will be designed not only to inform people about specific activities related \nto its preparation and implementation, but also to enable people in the community to ask questions, make suggestions, state \npreferences, and express concerns. The investment program community liaison officer will work with the community leaders \nto  organize  meetings  with  the  community.  Although  different  meetings  may  target  specific  stakeholders  (e.g.,  affected \ngroups), the investment program and community leaders will encourage all members of the community to participate. Special \nattention  will  be  paid  to  the  participation  of  women  and  any  other  vulnerable  groups.  Because  women  are  less  likely  to \ncontribute to meetings that involve the entire community, the investment program will ensure that women\u2019s focus groups are \norganized to obtain their views, preferences, and concerns where relevant. \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues  \nLevels  of  development  for  women  vary  drastically  depending  on  geographic  isolation,  history  of  contact  with  colonizers, \nmatrilineal or paterlineal culture of the group, quality of governance at the provincial level, and levels of service delivery and \ninfrastructure. In general, for the 21 national airports sites of the investment program in reference to gender and development \nshow  strong  patriarchal  structures  where  male  dominance  is  influential.  However,  there  are  some  instances  of  matrilineal \nstructures (where females by customary rights lead and own land) particularly in the New Guinea island provinces. According \nto  the  literature  and  review  of  the  gender socioeconomic  data  in  the  airport  sites,  these  matriarchal  values  are  being \ndestroyed by intermarriage and the stronger influence of the patriarchal structures. This means that women in these provinces \nare  not  proactively  participating  in  project  cycles  (planning,  design,  implementation,  and  monitoring),  especially  in \ndecision-making  roles,  but  play  secondary  roles  within  the  periphery  of  semi-unskilled  labor.  There  are,  however,  some \ninfluential  women  in  decision-making  roles  (2%)  that  can  take  proactive  roles.  The  CAA,  through  the  investment  program, \nencourages  the  hiring  of  women  as  engineers  or  managers  for  the  required  civil  works  to  comply  with  the  Government's  \ngender strategy. \n \nMoreover,  according  to  the  findings  of  the  socio-impact  studies  and  women\u2019s  focus  group  meetings  in  the  five  airport  site \nprovinces, the majority of the grassroots women (90%) do not currently use the airport and related facilities in their daily lives. \nA  few  (10%)  who  have  small  businesses  to  earn  extra  income  can  afford  to  travel  at  least  once  or  twice  a  year  to  visit \nrelatives, but the majority of the women said that the fares were too expensive for them to travel. The women suggested that \nthe development of a bigger airport market by the investment program would greatly induce them to come and sell their goods \nto generate extra income for their basic needs. \n \nWomen  are  constrained  from  engaging  in  private  sector  activity  and  small  business  by  their  lack  of  access  to  credit  and \nbanking facilities. This lack of access is, in turn, linked to their lack of control over property and productive resources. Even in \nmatrilineal areas where land registration has been introduced (East and West New Britain), women report that brothers take \non the role of signatories and then override the guidance of female relatives who have cultural inheritance rights to land. On a \npositive  note,  government,  NGOs,  and  donors  are  collaborating  to  enhance  and  increase  microfinance  for  women  in  PNG, \nand are providing training in the use of credit and savings. \n \nViolence  against  women  and  girls  is  epidemic  in  PNG.  It  contravenes  their  human  rights,  contributes  to  the  spread  of \nHIV/AIDS, negatively affects women\u2019s and children\u2019s mental health, and undermines women\u2019s social freedoms, productivity, \nand  contribution  to  national  development.  Violence  against  women  has  been  a  recognized  development  issue  for  decades, \nand donors have funded significant high-quality work since the 1980s. However, without the political will and commitment to \naction  in the police, military,  and  judicial systems, law reform proposals, policy initiatives, and  public  awareness campaigns \ncan have only a minor ameliorative effect and women will still be afraid to report cases of violence. The investment program \naddresses the health and safety issues as one of the project assurances. \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n61 \n\n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n \n3. Gender Action Plan: Proposed Airport Market  \n \nThe  investment  program  outcome  will  positively  influence  gender  equality  and  empowerment  of  women  in  varying  degrees \ndepending  on  the  context  of  the  project  cycle.  For  instance,  the  increase  in  job  opportunities  from  airport  upgrading  will \nincrease  household  incomes  and,  in  turn,  increase  education  for  all  and  health-care  services,  in  particular  for  children  and \nwomen, who are the primary users of health services. The program will also increase access to better airport markets, which \nwill help rural women generate extra income to meet their basic food, health, educational, and transport needs. In general, the \ngender-socioeconomic baseline data and qualitative findings gathered around the airport site communities indicated alarming \npoverty  levels.  This  implies  a  greater  need  in  these  communities  to  earn  extra  income.  Having  an  airport  market  will  also \npromote tourism, giving extra income to the communities. \n \nAs  noted  above,  the  CAA  construction  and  maintenance  work  will  create  opportunities  for  employment.  It  is  important  to \nencourage  women  to  be  involved  in  skilled  areas  and  decision-making  roles  (as  managers  and  engineers)  rather  than  just \nnon-skilled  and  service-type  work.  This  reinforces  the  gender-stereotyped  attitudes  dominant  in  Papua  New  Guinea,  a \nconstraint on women\u2019s advancement. In resettlement plans, for example, women must be consulted (100%) to ensure they, \nand not only the men, have legal property and inheritance rights, income, and assets rights. \n \nIn the planning and preparation stages, it is crucial for women to be proactively involved in the decision-making committees at \nall  levels  (institutional,  national,  provincial,  community,  and  local  level).  In  the  case  of  a  market  proposal,  for  example,  it  is \nimportant that users are consulted. In particular, women need to be involved in the design stage as main market users. The \nactivities  to  reinforce  project  outcome  and  outputs  will  incorporate  specific  features,  strategies,  targets,  indicators,  and \nbenchmarks  to  facilitate  both  men\u2019s  and  women\u2019s  active  participation  in  decision making  (CAA  and  PIU).  This  will  include \ngender-responsive policy measures. \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\n \nIssue \n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/Limited/\nNo Impact \nThe investment program \nis classified as category B \nwith respect to involuntary \nresettlement. \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n \n\n   Full Plan \n   Short Plan \n   Resettlement Framework \n   No Action \n\nStrategy to Address Issue\n\nAll works will be planned to \nminimize the need for \nadditional land.

Five major airports (project 1) in the country have been identified mainly \non  the  basis  of  the  relative  importance  of  these  airports  as  domestic  hubs  for  tourism  and \neconomic  development  on  a  regional  basis.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nprepared  for  each  airport  project  on  the  basis  of  the  available  preliminary  design  information. \nThe  investment  program  has  been  classified  as  category  B  in  accordance  with  the \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the \nGovernment\u2019s environmental requirements. The Government\u2019s Environment Act (2000) uses the \nEnvironment  (Prescribed  Activities)  Regulation  (2002),  which  designates  projects  that  need \nenvironmental assessment as \u201cprescribed activities.\u201d The upgrading or rehabilitation of airports \nis  not  listed  among  the  \u201cprescribed  activities\u201d  and  would  not  require  an  environmental  permit. \nThe  Department  of  Environment  and  Conservation  (DEC)  has,  however,  advised  that  certain \nactivities may require an environmental permit depending on their duration and scale. The Civil \nAviation  Authority  (CAA)  will  disclose  to  DEC  the  scale  and  scope  of  future  subprojects  to \ndetermine the requirements under the Environment Act (2000). Environmental assessments will \nbe prepared for future subprojects according to the prepared environmental assessment review \nframework (EARF). \n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Investment Program \n\n2. \nThe proposed program involves the upgrading or rehabilitation of the project 1 airports: \n(i) Wewak,  (ii)  Hoskins,  (iii)  Gurney,  (iv)  Mount  Hagen,  and  (v)  Jackson\u2019s  domestic  airport \n(Table A11). It is designed to meet international safety standards and provide sufficient runway \nlength for unrestricted operations of F100 jet aircraft or equivalent aircraft. The program includes \ninstitutional strengthening and capacity building to support the strategic management of aviation \ndevelopment  while  improving  environmental  management.  The  multitranche  financing  facility \n(MFF) is expected to be released in four tranches.  \n \n\nTable A11: Investment Program \n\nSubproject/Location/Proposed Development Works \nWewak Airport \nEast Sepik Province \nExtend runway length by 200 m, from existing 1,600 m to 1,800 m \nRetain runway width of 30 m similar to existing  \nConstruct extension strip width of 150 m (mark 90 m to match existing) \nExtension surfacing: prime and 3x coat seal (10 mm/7 mm/sand) similar to existing condition \nRealign Perigo Road \nRealign existing large storm water drain \nConstruct bridge over Brandi Road at realigned storm water drain \nExtend car park at rear of terminal building \nLop infringing trees in golf course to clear the approach/take-off path \nSupply, install and commission a new PAPI landing aid system \nHoskins Airport \nWest New Britain Province \nWiden the existing runway from 30 m to 45 m \nConstruct a 90 m end of runway safety zone (RESA) at southeast end, and stop ways at both ends \nWiden the existing flight strip to 150 m \nReplace all open drains within the strip with piping systems \nRelocate a precision approach path indicator (PAPI) visual guidance system at the southeast end to the new touchdown point \nWiden the taxiway shoulders to 5 m \n\n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nSubproject/Location/Proposed Development Works \nDesign the apron to provide for two F-100 parking positions \nReinstate pavement markings \nMount Hagen Airport \nWestern Highlands Province \nStrengthen the pavements to the main runway, taxiways, and apron \nLengthen runway by 110 m at the western end \nConstruct 3 m\u2013wide full strength asphalt surfaced shoulders on each side of the main runway \nSurfacing of the strengthened aircraft pavements and new shoulders to runway with dense graded asphalt and runway grooved \nWiden main runway strip from 90 m to 150 m wide \nReconstruct sealed stopways 60 m x 30 m\u2013wide at each end of the  strengthened runway \nReconstruction of 90 m x 90 m RESAs beyond the stopways at each end of the runway \nFlank earthworks to match raised levels of aircraft pavements \nInstall new lighting systems to the main runway \nStrengthen the pavements to the secondary runway \nReinstate all pavement markings \nAdjustments to the PAPI Landing Aid System at the end of runways \nGurney Airport \nMilne Bay Province \nExtend the eastern end runway by 160 m x 30 m to a total 1,850 m \nConstruction of a new 60 m stopway at the eastern end  \nConstruction of 90 m x 90 m RESA at both runway ends \nApply single coat 7 mm chip reseal to existing pavements and reinstate fuel resistance membrane and line markings \nDiversion of the existing open unlined drains (OUD) at the Eastern end and install a new culvert under the RFFS access road \nInstall a new multi-cell culvert under the plantation access road \nRelocate existing PAPI at the eastern end and conduct flight test \nJackson\u2019s Airport \nNational Capital District \nExtend domestic apron by 162 m long x 80 m\u2013wide at the NW end \nConstruct new stub taxiway connecting the new extended Apron to the existing parallel taxiway.

The  climate  is  generally  hot  and  humid,  with  temperatures \nranging  from  23oC  (day)  to  12oC  (night).  Air  quality  is  good,  and  water  pollution,  caused  by \nunregulated  runoff  from  industrial  activities  and  the  direct  dumping  of  wastes,  i.e.,  domestic \nwaste  and  sewage  into  river  systems,  is  common.  Water  resources  are  abundant,  with  an \nestimated  total  renewable  water  resource  per  capita  of  159,171  cubic  meters  per  person  in \n2002. About 29% of the population has access to safe drinking water. The forests of PNG are \nthe  third-largest  block  of  intact  tropical  forest  in  the  world,  estimated  at  26.1\u201333.0  million \nhectares.  HIV/AIDS  is  a  major  concern,  with  infection  rates  at  50,000  persons  and  a  potential \ninfection rate of 30% of the total population within 10 years. \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n65 \n\nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nImpact Associated with Planning, Location, and Design \n\n4. \nProject 1 will involve the upgrading or rehabilitation of existing airports. The works will be \ndone within existing property or on state land. No adverse impact is anticipated from the design \nor  the  siting  (existing  airports)  of  the  proposed  projects.  The  requirements  in  the  contract  will \ninclude  full  implementation  of  the  EMP,  with  the  CAA  preparing  resources  to  fulfill  the \nrequirements of the law and guiding the contractors in environmental management.  \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Impact of Construction Activities \n\n5. \nThe  subprojects  will  be improved  within  existing  airport  property  and  with  minimal  land \nclearing.  The  physical  impact  will  be  from  earthworks,  noise,  and  potential  impact  on  surface \nwater. Water quality impact such as that from fuels, lubricants, and solid waste stockpiles can \nbe  avoided  through  proper  storage  and  disposal,  and  the  siting  of  camps,  borrow  areas,  and \nancillary  facilities  away  from  water  bodies  and  at  least  500  meters  away  from  the  settlements \nand  forest  areas  with  water  and  sanitation.  Contractors  will  submit  site  EMPs  describing  the \nimplementation  of  mitigation  measures,  the  location  of  borrow  areas,  and  provisions  for  the \ndisposal of excess excavation materials. Laborers will be hired from local communities or other \nparts of the province to the extent possible. \n\n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Impact of Operations \n\n6. \nEnvironmental  impact  during  operation  will  come  from  neglect  of  mitigation  measures, \nparticularly  wastes  and  pollution,  noise,  and  airport  accidents.  The  sewage  system  will  be \nmaintained in good condition, and possibly connected to nearby main lines or, when required, a \nsewage system will be established. Procedures and facilities for the handling of fuels, lubricants, \nand  other  chemicals  (normal  airport  operations  and  aircraft  maintenance)  will  be  established; \nfuel  and  sediment  traps  will  be  installed  in  drain  entries  to  capture  accidental  spills;  and  a \nmonitoring  system  will  be  included  in  the  EMP  to  mitigate  the  possible  contamination  of  soils, \ngroundwater,  and  waterways.  A  solid  waste  management  system  will  be  developed  for  the \nairport  operation,  and  proper  sanitation  and  sewerage  facilities  will  be  constructed.  Noise \nexposure levels will be monitored and planning rules developed for the construction of dwellings \nwithin the noise exposure footprint, and the location and timing of ground running of aircraft.  \n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n\nEffective  implementation  of  the  EMP  requires  an  institutional  setting,  framework  and \n7. \ninformation  flows.  CAA,  the  executing  agency  of  the  investment  program,  will  work  with  the \nprogram implementation unit (PIU) to monitor the environmental aspects of design, contracting, \nmobilization,  and  construction.  The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  the  daily  implementation  of  the \nprogram through program support consultants, including an international environment specialist \n(engaged  intermittently  for  a  total  of  8  months  over  the  program  period)  and  national  expert \ninput  of  96  months.  The  international  environment  specialist,  who  will  report  to  the  program \ndirector  of  the  PIU,  will  be  tasked  to:  (i)  strengthen  the  environmental  management  of  the \nprogram  during  detailed  design,  bidding,  contracting,  construction,  and  implementation; \n(ii) supervise  and  guide  the  environmental  assessment  process  for  all  subprojects  under  the \nMFF;  (iii)  supervise  the  implementation  of  the  EMPs  for  subprojects;  and  (iv)  undertake  the \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nnecessary institutional strengthening including on-the-job training for the environment officer of \nthe  CAA.  The  CAA,  through  PIU,  will  notify  DEC  through  the  submission  of  subproject \nnotification in the prescribed format, and endorse environmental assessments required prior to \nthe implementation of the subproject packages. It will also ensure that all mitigation measures in \nthe  EMPs  are  implemented  by  the  contractors  for  the  subprojects.  The  EARF  will  include  a \ngeneral  description  of  the  anticipated  environmental  impact,  screening  and  classification \nprocedures  and  environmental  assessment  of  subprojects  in  future  tranches,  and  compliance \nwith  all  PNG  statutory  requirements.  EMP  implementation  during  the  works  will  be  the \nresponsibility  of  the  contractor,  who  must  (i)  incorporate  environmental  safeguards  in  the \ntechnical  specifications,  (ii)  have  the  EMP  reviewed  before  the  start  of  construction,  and \n(iii) monitor and report to the PIU in the course of the works. \n\nF. \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\n8. \nPublic  consultations  were  carried  out  in  May  2009.  Persons  consulted  included  local \nresidents, community leaders, and local officials to present the proposed program, elicit issues \nand  concerns  among  the  people  in  the  impact  area  that  may  be  relevant  to  the  proposed \ndevelopment,  and  discuss  ADB\u2019s  environmental  requirement  for  programs  of  this  type.  The \nparticipants  in  the  public  consultations  were  unanimous  in  their  support  for  the  proposed \ndevelopment and will not interpose any objection to its implementation. Major priorities raised by \nthe stakeholders during the public consultations were employment and livelihood opportunities \nfor qualified village folk, the provision of a potable water supply system, and the construction of \nmarketplaces in villages within the periphery of the subproject airports. \n\nG. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n9. \nThe  IEE  reports  on  the  various  subprojects  provided  assessments  of  the  potential \nenvironmental impact associated with project 1 and the mitigation measures. The development \nwill not cause any significant environmental impact as all the works will be undertaken within the \nexisting airport boundary. The responsibilities for the implementation of mitigation measures are \nindicated in the IEE and EMP and will be clearly defined in contracts and agreements, which will \nbe  monitored  by  the  environment  officer  of  the  CAA.  The  implementation  of  the  mitigation \nmeasures during construction will be assigned to the contractors and included in the contracts. \nThe  IEE  and  EMP  and  conditions  included  as  part  of  the  environmental  compliance  from  the \nDEC  will  be  the  basis  for  environmental  compliance  in  a  regular  program  of  environmental \nmonitoring  and  auditing.  Considering  the  above,  the  IEE  reports  prepared  for  the  five  airports \ncan be finalized as the environmental assessment of the investment program. \n\nH. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Review Framework \n\n10. \nThe  executing  agency  of  the  investment  program  will  be  the  CAA,  which  will  be \nresponsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  EARF  including  the  preparation  of  IEE/SIEE  or \nEIA/SEIA  (if  warranted).  The  environmental  assessment  reports  with  environmental  clearance \nfrom DEC (as necessary) will be submitted to ADB together with the periodic financing request \nfor  review  and  approval  before  the  finalization  of  contracts  or  the  start  of  work.  Public \nconsultations will also be carried out and CAA will submit the required documentation to ADB. \nThe PIU in CAA will ensure that appropriate environmental assessment reports (with EMPs) are \nsubmitted  to  ADB  in  time  for  review  and  approval  before  the  contracts  are  finalized  or  work \nbegins.  The  PIU  will  also  ensure  that  the  EMP  and  all  required  mitigation  measures  during \nconstruction are included in the contractors\u2019 contracts, with requirements to update the EMP in \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n67 \n\nresponse  to  any  unexpected  impact  and  fully  implement  the  EMP  during  construction.  During \nthe  implementation  of  the  MFF,  ADB  will  review  the  environmental  assessment  reports  for \nsubsequent  subproject  approvals,  disclose  environmental  assessments,  where  necessary, \nbefore a periodic financing request is submitted to ADB, and monitor EMP implementation and \nconduct  due  diligence  as  part  of  MFF  reviews.  ADB  will  assist  the  CAA  in  carrying  out  its \nresponsibilities and to build capacity and ensure that it conducts the required consultations with \nproject-affected  groups  and  local  nongovernment  organizations.  An  EARF  has  been  prepared \nthat  presents  the  general  anticipated  environmental  impact,  subproject  selection  criteria,  and \nsubproject environmental procedure as guide for the preparation and approval of environmental \nassessments of future projects to be financed under the investment program.  \n\nI. \n\nConclusion \n\n11. \nThe IEE reports for the subproject packages have assessed the potential environmental \nimpact  from  the  subprojects  under  project  1  to  be  temporary,  reversible,  and  easily  mitigated \nwith available methods. The mitigation measures proposed in the IEE/EMP for the subprojects \nare  sufficient.  At  the  implementation  stage,  CAA  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  mitigation \nmeasures and monitoring programs specified in each IEE/EMP. With these measures in place, \nit is predicted that all potential environmental impact can be mitigated to insignificant levels; as \nsuch,  no  further  impact  assessment  is  considered  necessary.  A  semiannual  report  on  EMP \nimplementation will be submitted to ADB and the relevant government agencies. Environmental \nassessment  will  be  required  for  all  subprojects  in  future  tranches.  EARF  will  guide  the \nenvironmental  management  of  the  overall  program  and  the  environmental  assessment  of \nindividual subprojects in the future. \n \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\n1. \nThe  resettlement  framework  for  the  investment  program  and  the  due  diligence  report \n(DDR)  for  each  project  1  airport  site  were  prepared  in  compliance  with  the  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  These  documents  provide \nguidance in establishing the policies and procedures for compensating affected people for lost \nor damaged assets. The resettlement framework is based on the principles established in ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy and relevant sections of the Operations Manual (as updated in \n2006). The  resettlement framework  will be the  basis and will guide the Civil Aviation Authority \n(CAA) in preparing and implementing the resettlement issues for the program. At the beginning \nof each tranche, the policies and provisions of the resettlement framework will be reviewed and, \nas  required,  updated  to  reflect  the  conditions  and  requirements  for  upgrading  airports,  but \nwithout lowering the standards set out in the present resettlement framework. The DDR will be \nupdated,  if  necessary,  on  the  basis  of  the  detailed  engineering  design  during  loan \nimplementation. \n\nThe  Government  of  Papua  New  Guinea  had  originally  acquired  land  for  the \n2. \nestablishment of national airports from customary ownership. To all extent possible, civil works \nproposed under the investment program, including the upgrading and extension of runway, will \nbe  undertaken  within  the  existing  airport  boundary  (CAA-/state-owned  land);  therefore,  very \nlimited land acquisition for the program is expected. However, there will be both permanent and \ntemporary resettlement issues to be solved under the program\u2019s subsequent tranches.  \n\nIt  is  therefore  expected  that  the  potential  number  of  people  that  will  experience  the \n3. \nincidental  impact  of  the  upgrading  of  airports  under  the  program  will  be  small,  and  well  within \nthe category of \u201cminor\u201d or \u201cno significant resettlement impact\u201d under ADB\u2019s policy. A screening \nof the four airport sites under project 1 has been undertaken. The program is currently classified \nas category B with respect to involuntary resettlement. \n\nThe  Government  through  CAA,  has  agreed  to  expedite  the  implementation  of  the \n4. \ninvestment  plan.  In  cases  where  additional  land  is  required  to  upgrade  and  extend  airport \nrunways under the investment program, the land acquisition will be done through a process of \nstate alienation of customary land according to the Land Act of 1996, led by the Department of \nLands  and  Physical  Planning.  However,  as  this  process  is  usually  lengthy,  CAA  is  examining \nthe  benefits  of  expediting  land  acquisition  through  a  memorandum  of  agreement  (MOA).  This \nprocess  was  used  by  the  Department  of  Works  in  acquiring  land  for  the  Highlands  Road \nImprovement  Project.  The  MOA  will  be  prepared  after  the  land  is  valued.  Therefore,  it  will \nindicate the compensation amount. \n\nThe  MOA  will  be  the  interim  means  of  securing  the  land  to  allow  upgrading  works  to \n5. \ncontinue while the process of land acquisition as stipulated in the Land Act continues. When the \nland acquisition process is complete, the acquired land will be leased to the CAA, and the MOA \nwill  be  superseded.  Under  the  Land  Act,  affected  people  will  be  compensated  for  land; \nindividuals and households with assets on the land will be compensated for any damage to or \nloss of these assets by the State through agreements with tribal owners. \n\n6. \nThe program entitlement matrix was prepared as a part of the resettlement framework \n(Supplementary Appendix G). Affected people will be compensated for any loss of or damage to \nland, crops, trees, temporary structures, or other assets, according to the policies stated in this \nresettlement  framework.  All  costs  of  the  investment  program  related  to  land  acquisition, \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n69 \n \n\ncompensation and allowances, operation and administration, surveys, monitoring, and reporting \nwill be financed by CAA through the Government using counterpart funds.  \n\n7. \nAll people who own crops, trees, temporary structures, or other assets on affected land \nare  entitled  to  compensation  for  the  loss  of  or  damage  to  these  assets.  Compensation  will  be \npaid in cash at replacement cost. In addition to compensation, affected persons are entitled to \nassistance,  for  example,  in  shifting  temporary  informal  market  structures  for  disrupted \nbusinesses. Affected persons will also be given priority in employment in the program civil works \nand ongoing maintenance.  \n\n8. \nThe investment program will monitor and report semiannually to the CAA and ADB on \nall  activities  associated  with  the  establishment  of  MOA  and  the  payment  of  compensation  to \naffected  persons.  The  scope  of  internal  monitoring  includes:  (i)  compliance  with  the  agreed \npolicies  and  procedures;  (ii)  prompt  approval,  allocation,  and  disbursement  of  funds,  and \npayment  of  compensation  to  affected  persons,  including  supplemental  compensation  for \nadditional or unforeseen losses; (iii) the availability of other resources and efficient, effective use \nof these resources; and (iv) requirement for remedial actions. \n\n9. \nThe  CAA  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  recruit  a  local  social  safeguard \nspecialist to independently conduct external monitoring of the program subprojects. The person \nwill  be  based  at  the  PIU  and  will  be  supported  by  a  community  liaison  officer  (CLO).  The \nspecialist  will  be  mobilized  at  the  beginning  of  project  1  of  the  investment  program.  An \nindependent monitor under the social safeguards section will be responsible for reporting to the \nPIU,  CAA,  and  ADB  on  all  activities  related  to  additional  land  requirements,  community \nconsultations,  preparation  of  resettlement  plans,  and  payment  of  compensation.  The  external \nmonitoring  will  focus  on  the  social  impact  of  the  subprojects  and  the  ability  of  the  affected \npersons  to  restore,  and  preferably  improve,  their  pre-project  living  standards,  incomes,  and \nproductive capacity.  \n\nin \n\nConsultations  will  be  carried  out  at  different  points \n\n10. \nthe  preparation  and \nimplementation of tranche projects, as part of the process of negotiating the MOA. With support \nfrom  the  PIU,  CAA,  local  government  ward  councilors,  and  relevant  local  authorities,  the \ninvestment  program  will  organize  consultations  with  affected  communities.  Participants  will \ninclude  appointed  and  traditional  leaders  in  the  village,  affected  landowners,  and  community \npeople  affected  by  the  loss  of  assets  on  the  affected  land.  Village  leaders  will  encourage  all \nother community members, including women, elderly people, young people, and disadvantaged \nmembers of the community, to attend. Because of cultural barriers, women are often reluctant to \nspeak  at  community  meetings.  Where  relevant,  separate  meetings  may  be  held  with  them  to \nunderstand  and  discuss  their  preferences  and  concerns.  Where  indigenous  people  or  a \nlinguistic  group  requires  translation  assistance,  the  investment  program  will  ensure  that  a \ntranslator  or  translated  materials  are  provided  to  ensure  that  the  particular  group  has  full \nunderstanding of the resettlement issues and process of compensation. \n\n11. \nThe  key  consultations  will  occur  before  or  during  the  project  works.  There  will  be \n(i) screening  and  preparation  of  the  subprojects  within  each  tranche;  (ii)  MOA  negotiation,  an \nasset survey, and social surveys; (iii) disclosure and review of the draft resettlement plan; and \n(iv) land  ownership  investigation  and  preparation  of  land  investigation  reports  (LIRs).  The \ninvestment program and the social specialist will consult with communities and affected people \non  related  issues,  as  required,  throughout  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  tranche \nprojects. Throughout these consultations, the objectives are (i) to provide timely and complete \ninformation  about  the  project,  land  requirements,  and  impact,  to  enable  people  to  make \n\n \n\n\f70 \n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\ninformed decisions; (ii) to ensure that all affected people and other interested stakeholders know \nand  understand  the  policies  and  procedures  related  to  additional  land  requirement  for  the \nupgrading of the airports; and (iii) to build and maintain community support for the investment \nprogram  by  addressing  the  concerns  and  preferences  of  affected  people  and  other \nstakeholders. The resettlement plan will be disclosed according to ADB policies. \n\n12. \nProgram grievance redress mechanisms will be established to ensure that all affected \npersons\u2019  grievances  related  to  any  aspect  of  land  acquisition  or  compensation  for  affected \nassets are resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner. The CLO is the first step to addressing \ngrievances. The grievance redress mechanism will apply equally to the negotiation of the MOA. \nAffected  persons  will  be  made  fully  aware  of  their  rights  (both  orally  and  in  writing)  during \nconsultations about land requirements for the CAA airports. The mechanisms will be based on \nthe provisions of the Land Disputes Settlement Act, using the CLO as a first step in the tradition \nof  local  mediation  that  is  used  throughout  PNG.  The  participation  of  appointed  and  traditional \nleaders  will  be  promoted  to  achieve  satisfactory  resolution  of  issues  at  the  local  level.  In  the \nevent that grievances cannot be resolved through local mediation, the matter will be referred to \nthe  land  court  system.  In  this  case,  the  program  and  the  district  lands  officer  will  hold  the \ncompensation amounts in a trust fund. Compensation will be paid in full upon final resolution of \nthe case in the courts or other forum, in accordance with the entitlements of the affected person. \n\nThe CAA, as executing agency for the investment program, has overall responsibility to \n13. \nmanage the planning, implementation, and monitoring related to the acquisition of use rights for \nadditional land to implement airport safety standards, as well as compensation for damage on \nairport-affected land. Once again, CAA will let the Department of Lands and Physical Planning \nprepare  the  LIRs  for  state  alienation  of  land.  Local  authorities,  including  the  provincial \ngovernment,  district  administrators,  and  local  government  ward  councilors,  will  assist  the \nprogram  (and  the  Department  of  Land  and  Physical  Planning)  by  leading  community \nconsultations. \n\n14. \nDuring project 1 of the investment program implementation, a training program will be \nestablished within the PIU to build capacity in the following areas: (i) government policies and \nprocedures  for  the  acquisition  of  customary  land,  including  how  the  MOA  process  can \ncomplement state acquisition of land (it is also anticipated that CAA will request to have a lands \nofficer  seconded  to  the  PIU  of  the  investment  program);  (ii)  ADB  policies  and  procedures  for \nland acquisition and compensation; (iii) the application of the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s policies \nand procedures to the requirements of the investment program; and (iv) other technical support \nrelated to, among others, surveys and data collection to prepare document management system \nand  LIRs,  community  consultations,  and  awareness  programs.  The  training  will  target  people \nfrom  CAA  and  the  PIU,  provincial  and  district  lands  officers  in  all  national  airport  provinces, \nrelevant staff of the valuer general, and any other organizations involved in land acquisition and \ncompensation  activities.  A  key  objective  of  the  training  program  will  be  to  establish  sufficient \ntraining capacity within CAA, the investment program, and the Department of Land and Physical \nPlanning  to  implement  training  sessions  for  provincial  and  district  officials  for  subsequent \ntranches. The PIU will also provide financial support for the fieldwork, for example, the conduct \nof detailed document management system or the preparation of LIRs. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 07 October 2009) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "\u2013 \n", "kina (K)  \n", "K1.00\n$1.00\n", "$0.37 \nK2.66 \n", "= \n= \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "ADB \nADF \nANG \nAPNG \nAusAID \nCAA \nDWTCA \nEARF \nEIRR \nEMP \nFFA \nFIRR \nHIV/AIDS \n", "ICAO \nIEE \nLIR \nLIBOR \nMFF \nMOA \nMTDS \nNTDP \nOCR \nPFR \nPIU \nPNG \nPNGASL \nRPT \nSPS \nSTI \nTSSP \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \nAir Niugini \nAirlines of Papua New Guinea \nAustralian Agency for International Development \nCivil Aviation Authority \nDepartment of Works, Transport and Civil Aviation \nenvironmental assessment review framework \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nfinancing framework agreement \nfinancial internal rate of return \nhuman immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization \ninitial environmental examination \nland investigation reports \nLondon interbank offered rate \nmultitranche financing facility \nmemorandum of agreement \nMedium Term Development Strategy \nNational Transport Development Plan \nordinary capital resources \nperiodic financing request \nproject implementation unit \nPapua New Guinea \nPapua New Guinea Air Services Ltd. \nregular passenger transport \nSafeguard Policy Statement \nsexually transmitted infection \nTransport Sector Support Program \n", " \n \nNOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  ends  on  31  December.
