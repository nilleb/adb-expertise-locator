The \nProject will implement innovative approaches for erosion mitigation \nfor  this  purpose:  (i)  protecting  the  riverbanks  through  an  adaptive \napproach of placing revetments along the natural river alignments \nas  needed;  and  (ii)  using  sand-filled  geotextile  bags,  a  lower  cost \nto  conventional  materials. \nand \nlabor-intensive  alternative \nfull \nInstitutional  development  support  will \nimplementation  of  the  key  principles  of  the  1999  National  Water \nPolicy  (NWP)  applied  to  the  Project  institutions  including  the \noperation of joint management committees (JMCs) by the national \nGovernment, local governments, and diverse stakeholders.  \n \nRiverbank  erosion  is  a  perennial  problem  in  Bangladesh  that \ndisplaces  over  100,000  people  annually  with  devastating  social \nand  poverty  impacts  along  the  major  rivers,  where  poverty  is \nheavily  concentrated.  The  dynamic  river  process  in  the  Jamuna \nand Meghna rivers is currently critically threatening the PIRDP and \nMDIP  flood  embankments.  If  unattended,  the  process  is  likely  to \nerode  the  embankments  in  the  very  near  future,  resulting  in \ninundation  of  the  project  area  affecting  the  livelihoods  of  up  to  2 \nmillion people and significantly reversing the momentum of poverty \nreduction, due to the loss of agriculture and other benefits secured \nby  the  embankments,  including  local  institutions  for  participatory \nwater management. About 1,700 hectares (ha) of highly productive \nagricultural lands and homesteads are also expected to be eroded, \ndisplacing  28,000  people  as  asset-less  poor  over  the  next  10 \nyears.   \n\nthe \n\nDespite  the  urgent  need  to  protect  the  project  area,  conventional \nprotection  structures  using  hard  materials  to  actively  control  the \nriver channels require high investment and maintenance costs and \nare infeasible. On the other hand, retiring the embankments could \nbe less costly, but results in significant social disruption associated \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\nthe \n\nthroughout \n\nthe  country \n\nto  enhance \n\nintensive  assessment  of \n\nrange  of  nonstructural  measures, \n\nwith  substantial  loss  of  land  and  dislocation  of  people,  and  is \ndifficult  to  be  implemented  prior  to  the  erosion  of  the  existing \nembankments,  given  its  social  implications.  Thus,  sustainable \nmeasures  that  are  socially  viable  and  economically  feasible  were \ndesperately  required.  The  Project  was  formulated  from  this \nperspective,  based  on \nriver \nmorphology and interventions in Bangladesh and elsewhere, which \nresulted  in  the  identification  of  cost  effective  structural  measures \nincluding  social \nand  a \ndevelopment  programs  to  engage  the  most  vulnerable  erosion-\ndisplaced  hard-core  poor  in  sustainable  water  management.  The \nsuccessful implementation of the Project will serve as a model that \nthe \ncan  be  replicated \nlivelihoods  of  many  vulnerable  people  threatened  by  riverbank \nerosion in the floodplains of Bangladesh.        \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  sustain  the  incomes  of  people  in  the  PIRDP \nand  MDIP  areas \nthrough  establishing  sustainable  riverbank \nerosion  management  system  (REMS)  that  provide  reliable  and \ncost-effective  mitigation  measures  through  adaptive  riverbank \nprotection works and a range of nonstructural instruments to adapt \nto  the  dynamic  morphological  processes  of  the  Jamuna  and \nMeghna  rivers.  The  project  scope  comprises  (i)  about  7.0 \nkilometers (km) and 4.4 km of riverbank protection works in PIRDP \nand  MDIP,  respectively  through  placement  of  revetments  using \nsand-filled geotextile bags; (ii) nonstructural river erosion mitigation \nmeasures  including  data  and  information  management,  disaster \npreparedness,  and  targeted  social  development  to  the  erosion-\ndisplaced  poor;  and  (iii)  institutional  strengthening  of  REMS \nincluding capacity development and project management.  \n \nThe Project is estimated to cost $61.3 million equivalent, of which \n$19.6  million  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $41.7  million \nequivalent is the local currency cost including taxes and duties  of \n$9.7 million.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource \n\n($ million) \n\n \nForeign \nExchange \n\n \nLocal \nCurrency \n22.6 \nADB \n19.1 \nGovernment\n41.7 \n     Total \n(Above table excludes operation and maintenance costs of irrigation and drainage \nfacilities borne by the beneficiaries and the Government.) \n \n\n19.6 \n0.0 \n19.6 \n\n42.2 \n19.1 \n61.3 \n\n 69 \n 31 \n100 \n\nPercent \n\nTotal \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  The  equivalent  in  various  currencies  of  SDR31,975,000  ($42.2 \nmillion approximately) from the Special Funds Resources of ADB. \nThe term will be 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, and \nthere  will  be  an  interest  charge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n\n\f \nUntil 30 June 2009 \n \n31 December 2008 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n  v\n\n \nBangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) \n \nProject  implementation  will  aim  towards  full  operation  of  key \nprinciples  of  the  1999  NWP.  A  project  management  office  is \nestablished within BWDB to manage the project implementation to \nbe  undertaken  by  subproject  management  offices \n(SMOs) \nestablished in the PIRDP and MDIP. A JMC will be established in \neach subproject area, with representation from line agencies, local \ngovernments,  and  diverse  stakeholder  institutions  including  water \nmanagement  associations  and  fishery  representatives,  which  will \nprovide  supervision  and  guidance  to  the  annual  planning  and \nimplementation  of  SMO  activities.  A  steering  committee  will  be \nconvened for central level coordination of the concerned ministries \nand departments. \n\nThe  Project  will  also  establish  and  operate  sustainable  operation \nand  maintenance  (O&M)  funding  following  the  NWP,  which \nstipulates  O&M  cost  recovery  of  irrigation  schemes  through  local \nresource  mobilization  and  of  flood  control  schemes  through \nrationalizing  the  Government\u2019s  budgetary  mechanism.  In  line  with \nthis,  the  Project  aims  to  (i)  substantially  enhance  local  cost \nrecovery of irrigation O&M, thereby reducing the existing budgetary \nburden  of  BWDB  for  the  project  areas;  and  (ii)  establish  and \noperate,  in  the  context  of  the  Project,  a  performance-based  O&M \nbudgetary  management  mechanism  within  BWDB,  where  fund \nallocation  is  prioritized  on  the  basis  of  the  stipulated  and \ntransparent performance criteria.  \n \nIn  consideration  of  the  urgent  need  to  undertake  riverbank \nprotection  work  during  the  dry  season  of  2002/03  to  prevent  the \nembankment failure during the 2003 monsoon, advance action and \nretroactive financing have been approved for eligible expenditures \nafter the date of appraisal, subject to ADB approval of the loan. All \nprocurement  under  the  Project  will  be  done  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Major contracts for equipment \nand  materials  exceeding  $0.5  million  will  be  procured  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB),  including  the  supply  of \ngeotextile  bags.  Civil  works  under  the  Project  will  be  up  to  $2.0 \nmillion  and  will  be  contracted  through  local  competitive  bidding \n(LCB) with prequalification by the PMO, due to the remoteness of \nthe  area  and  intermittent  distribution  of  the  works  over  the \nimplementation period. As to the ICB for geotextile bag supply and \nLCB for civil works, consultants will be engaged as \u201cthe engineer\u2019s \nrepresentatives\u201d to undertake contract management.   \n \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. It \nis  estimated  that  a  total  of  470  person-months  of  consulting \nincluding  125  person-months  of \nservices  will  be  required, \ninternational and 345 person-months of domestic consulting inputs. \nThis will comprise (i) a team of individually recruited consultants to \nundertake  the  protection  works  in  the  2002/03  dry  season,  (ii)  a \nteam  recruited  from  a  firm  for  project  management  and  capacity \ndevelopment  activities,  and  (iii)  individual  consultants  to  form  an \nexpert  panel  for  technical  guidance  of  the  protection  works.  To \nensure  timely  recruitment  of  consultants  to  meet  the  immediate \nneeds of protection works, the Government has requested ADB to \nselect the consultants on its behalf.  \n \nThe Project will benefit the project areas having a total population \nof  2  million  in  the  flood  protection  command,  and  440,000  in  the \nirrigation  command.  Major  benefits  will  include  avoided  loss  of \n1,700 ha of land and avoided displacement of 28,000 people in the \nnext 10 years; and protection and enhancement of flood protection \nand  irrigation  benefits  in  the  overall  project  area  amounting  to \n116,000  metric  tons  of  cereal  production  along  with  water \nmanagement associations developed for sustainable O&M of water \ncontrol  facilities.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  16.7%  in \nPIRDP and 31.4% in MDIP.  \n\nfor \n\nIts  social  development  strategy  will \nthe  poor \n\nSurveys conducted during project preparation estimated that about \n53%  and  47%  of  the  total  households  in  the  PIRDP  and  MDIP \nareas, respectively, fall below the poverty line, which is higher than \nthe national average but about 10-15% lower than in the adjacent \nareas.  These  figures  would  substantially  increase  without  the \nProject.  With  its  labor-intensive  approach  to  riverbank  protection, \nthe  Project  will  also  have  a  poverty  impact  of  45%  and  42%, \nfocus  on \nrespectively. \nenhancing  participatory  development \nin  water \nmanagement  activities,  empowerment  of  the  most  vulnerable \nerosion-affected  people  along  the  bank  line  through  targeted \nsupport, and enhancing the role of women in project institutions.   \n \nThe  Project  has  certain  risks  that  could  adversely  affect  its \ntechnical  and \neffective \nmorphological  risks,  (ii)  implementation  risks,  and  (iii)  O&M \nsustainability risks. The Project design has incorporated mitigation \nmeasures  to  address  the  remaining  risks  through  (i)  including \ncontingency  plans  to  cope  with  morphological  and  technical \nuncertainties  through  process-type  approach  of  implementation \nwith  intensive  performance  evaluation;  (ii)  incorporating  specific \narrangements \nrecruitment  of  consultants, \nprocurement processing, and construction quality control, including \nthe  selection  of  consultants  by  ADB  and  fielding  of  sufficient \nnumber of consultants for critical processes; and (iii) agreeing  with \n\nimplementation  and  sustainability:  (i) \n\nto  ensure \n\ntimely \n\n\f \n\nthe national government on the specific local resource mobilization \nplan  and  action  plans  to  strengthen  the  O&M  funding  by  the \nnational and local governments following the principles of the 1999 \nNWP.  \n\n  vii\n\n\f \n\nix\n\n \n\n\fx\n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Jamuna-Meghna  River  Erosion  Mitigation \nProject.1 The Project Framework is shown in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nSector  Description.  Poverty  remains  a  massive  and  predominant  problem \n\n2. \nin \nBangladesh, with 44% of its population of over 130 million living under the poverty line. Given \nthat  over  80%  of  the  poor  live  in  rural  areas  engaged  in  agriculture  and  related  nonfarm \nactivities,  enhancing  agricultural  and  rural  development  is  a  key  to  reducing  poverty  in  the \ncountry.  Due  to  the  geographical  location  of  Bangladesh  in  the  confluence  of  three  major \nrivers\u2015 Jamuna, Ganges, and Meghna\u2015the livelihood of the poor is fundamentally affected by \nwater sector challenges generated by this major river system, including (i) massive floods in the \nmonsoon season, (ii) severe water scarcity in the dry season, (iii) riverbank erosion and siltation \nof  watercourses,  (iv)  periodic  natural  disasters  such  as  cyclones  and  tidal  surges,  and  (v) \nwidespread  arsenic  contamination  of  groundwater.  While  sustainable  water  management  is \nparamount  for  the  prosperity  of  the  poor  and  overall  economic  growth,  the  task  is  further \ncomplicated  by  diverse  social  interests  attached  to  different  livelihood  activities  and  the \nvulnerable  natural  environment,  which  are  affected  by  water  management  activities.  The \ncountry\u2019s sector policies and institutional framework and capacities remain weak to meet these \ndiverse challenges comprehensively, and in a participatory and strategic manner.  \n\n3. \nRiverbank  Erosion.  Riverbank  erosion  is  a  perennial  problem  caused  by  dynamic \nchannel  shifting  of  the  rivers  flowing  through  the  unconsolidated  sediments  of  the  floodplain. \nNationwide,  an  estimated  1,200  kilometers  (km)  of  riverbank  in  the  major  rivers  is  actively \neroding, with more than 500 km having severe erosion problems. An estimated 10,000 hectares \n(ha) of floodplain land is lost annually, with the emergence of new but much smaller and short-\nlived  low-lying  char  lands,  which  exhibit  a  significantly  reduced  production  base.  This  process \nannually affects about 100,000 local people, who face significant social hardships such as loss \nof  homestead,  becoming  landless,  and  being  displaced  to  the  riverine  fringe  land,  nearby \nembankments,  char  lands,  or  urban  slums.  In  total  some  5  million  people  live  in  the  active \nfloodplain of the major rivers susceptible to bank erosion, of whom 2 million live on vulnerable \nchar  land.  Poverty  incidence  is  significantly  higher  in  these  areas  due  to  river  erosion.  Past \nefforts to mitigate the effects of erosion have not produced tangible outputs, due to the lack of \ncost-effective mitigation measures that can effectively cope with the highly dynamic, erratic, and \nunavoidable morphological changes of the major rivers in Bangladesh.2  \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nErosion Threats in the Project Area. Progressive riverbank erosion is now threatening \n4. \nthe  flood  embankments  in  the  two  subproject  sites  of  the  ongoing  Loan  No.  1399-BAN(SF) \nCommand  Area  Development  Project  (CADP),  comprising  the  Pabna  Irrigation  and  Rural \n                                                 \n1   Project  Preparatory  Technical  Assistance  was  provided  under  ADB.  2001.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s \n\nRepublic of Bangladesh for Jamuna-Meghna River Erosion Mitigation Project. Manila. \n\n2   Some protection measures have been attempted at a few locations where key infrastructure and urban areas are \nat  risk,  with  high-cost,  hard  structures  to  directly  control  the  channel  flow  pattern.  However,  in  some  such  cases \nthis treatment has resulted in even more severe attacks resulting in structural failure and high maintenance costs. \n\n\f2 \n\nDevelopment  Project  (PIRDP)  and  the  Meghna-Dhonagoda  Irrigation  Project  (MDIP),  located \nalong the right bank of the Jamuna and left bank of the Meghna rivers, respectively.3 The two \nschemes  provide  flood  protection  for  203,500  ha  with  a  total  population  of  2  million,  of  which \n36,400  ha  is  provided  with  irrigation  facilities  being  rehabilitated  under  the  ongoing  CADP. \nIntensive agriculture and fish culture are under way to their full development potential, with an \nincrease  of  cropping  intensity  from  125%  to  191%  between  1994  and  2001,  and  of  rice \nproduction from 130,000 to 203,000 metric tons between 1996 and 2001. Poverty incidence has \nalso  been  significantly  reduced,  and  is  now  about  10-15%  lower  than  in  the  adjacent  areas, \nalthough it is still higher than the national average, with the continued inflow of people displaced \nby bank erosion from nearby. To promote optimal use of irrigation facilities, water management \nassociations  (WMAs)  were  established,  and  cost-recovery  arrangements  are  being  introduced \nfor sustainable operation and maintenance (O&M), rendering them the first large-scale irrigation \nschemes to institutionalize participatory water management in Bangladesh.  \n\n5. \nHowever,  natural  river  erosion  has  accelerated  along  the  PIRDP  and  MDIP  since  the \nlate 1990s, reducing the distance between the bank and the flood embankments from about 1 \nkm to none in some critical reaches. While the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) \nimplemented immediate interim works in 2001 and 2002, mobilizing its own resources to protect \nthe  flood  embankments,  the  embankments  are  likely  to  fail  in  the  very  near  future  without \npermanent protection works, which would lead to the inundation of the area and substantial loss \nof  flood  protection  and  irrigation  benefits  along  with  the  deterioration  of  local  WMAs,  affecting \nthe  people  within  the  embankments.  The  momentum  of  poverty  reduction  would  also  be \nreversed,  with  substantial  increase  in  the  number  of  the  poor  due  to  the  lost  agriculture  and \nother  benefits.  The  process  would  also  erode  1,700  ha  of  homestead,  embankment,  and \nagricultural land and displace 5,600 households or some 28,000 people in the next 10 years.  \n\n6. \nGovernment Policies and Plans. In recent years, the Government has proceeded with \nwater  sector  reforms  to  address  past  shortcomings.  The  1999  National  Water  Policy  (NWP) \nadopted  the  principles  of  integrated  water  management  with  due  emphasis  on  stakeholder \nparticipation,  strategic  planning,  sound  management  of  social  and  environmental  issues,  and \nsustainable O&M. Following the NWP, comprehensive reforms of sector institutions have been \ninitiated to meet the policy principles, including the reorganization of BWDB and improvement of \nthe legal and regulatory framework and investment plan. On the legal and regulatory side, the \nWater  Act  is  under  preparation  to  comprehensively  govern  the  utilization  and  management  of \nwater. Guidelines for participatory water management have also been finalized that stipulate the \nmanagement  transfer  and  local  participation  arrangements  in  water  resources  schemes.  The \nGovernment also prepared the National Water Management Plan (NWMP) recently, which lays \nout strategies and priority programs at the national and regional levels. The Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  played  a  key  role  during  the  process,  with  its  assistance  strategy  focusing  on \npromoting  an  improved  policy  and  institutional  environment  while  addressing  the  significant \ncapacity  constraints  to  implement  the  reforms  and  providing  critical  infrastructure.  (See \nAppendix 2 for sector analysis, Appendix 3 for policy and institutional actions agreed upon in the \ncontext of the Project, and Appendix 4 for external assistance.)   \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB.  1995.

Manila. \n\n\f3 \n\nOpportunities for Riverbank Erosion Mitigation in PIRDP and MDIP. The NWP and \n7. \nNWMP  have  accorded  high  priority  to  mitigating  the  effects  of  riverbank  erosion  in  view  of  its \nsignificant poverty implications. However, effective strategy, measures, and institutions to cope \nwith  the  problem  have  not  been  established  in  Bangladesh.  According  to  a  study  conducted \nunder  the  CADP  in  2000,  conventional  structures  using  hard  materials  and  taking  an  active \napproach to controlling river channels required high capital and O&M costs and resulted in low \neconomic  returns.  On  the  other  hand,  the  alternative  option  of  a  phased  retirement  of  the \nembankments was found less costly, but would result in significant social disruption associated \nwith continued loss of land and dislocation of over 28,000 people in the next 10 years, rendering \nthis option socially unattractive and opposed. It is also difficult to urgently implement this option \nbefore the existing embankment is breached, a major factor undermining its economic viability. \nThus, there was identified an urgent need to develop more cost-effective, socially desirable, and \nsustainable mitigation measures commensurate with the land use in the areas they protect; and \nthat were within the fiscal capacity of the local institutions and the Government; and that could \nbe sustained under the highly dynamic morphological environment of the major rivers.  \n\nAppropriate Alternative. From this perspective, an alternative approach was identified \n8. \nand  developed  under  the project preparatory technical assistance (footnote1) through detailed \nassessments  of  the  morphological  process  and  studies  of  the  lessons  learned  in  Bangladesh \nand in other parts of the world. (See Appendix 5 for project alternatives.) In contrast to the past \ninterventions, the proposed measures provided a passive and adaptive approach to managing \nriver erosion by placing the protection works parallel to the natural alignment of the river system. \nThis would reduce the risks of severe attack resulting in structural failure and high maintenance \ncosts. The protection works would consist of a revetment with launching sections, to cover and \nprotect  the  existing  bank  line  as  the  scour  holes  develop.  They  are  constructed  of  sand-filled \ngeotextile bags, which can be placed at about half the cost of conventional hard materials and \nhave the advantage of using sand and labor, the most abundant resources in Bangladesh. This \nis to be implemented with a range of nonstructural measures including the establishment of and \ndevelopment  of  capacity  in  riverbank  management  institutions  that  incorporate  stakeholder \nparticipation  and  ownership,  and  effective  O&M  systems  with  local  cost  recovery.  Successful \nimplementation  will  serve  as  a  model  for  effective  and  sustainable  mitigation  of  riverbank \nerosion  that  can  be  replicated  throughout  the  country,  thereby  contributing  to  the  livelihood \nprotection of poverty-stricken local communities occupying the erosion-prone floodplains.  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\n9. \nThe  goal  of  the  proposed  Project  is  to  sustain  and  enhance  economic  growth,  poverty \nreduction, and livelihood security in areas threatened by riverbank erosion. Its specific objective \nis  to  sustain  the  incomes  of  people  in  PIRDP  and  MDIP  areas4  through  establishing  cost-\neffective  and  sustainable  riverbank  erosion  management  system  (REMS)  that  provide  reliable \nmitigation  measures  through  adaptive  riverbank  protection  works  and  a  range  of  nonstructural \ninstruments  to  adapt  to  the  highly  dynamic  morphological  processes  of  the  Jamuna  and  the \nMeghna rivers while protecting and enhancing the livelihoods of the poor in the project areas.    \n \n\n                                                 \n4  Total number of beneficiaries is about 2 million, including 443,000 in the irrigation command.  \n\n\f4 \n\nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n10. \nThe scope or components of the Project include (i) riverbank protection works, (ii) non-\nstructural river erosion mitigation measures, and (iii) institutional strengthening of REMS. They \nwill  be  provided  focusing  on  PIRDP  and  MDIP  areas.  For  the  purpose  of  effective  monitoring \nand  achievement  of  outputs,  the  Project  has  distinct  performance  targets  towards  its  midterm \nreview (MTR) in the third year and its completion. Implementation after MTR is designed based \non the performance of the output targets and other policy dialogue agreements, in particular the \nsatisfactory implementation of bank protection works and achievement of institutional targets.  \n \n\n1. \n\nPart A: Riverbank Protection Works for the PIRDP and MDIP  \n\nThe Project will provide riverbank protection works to stabilize the critical sections of the \n11. \nriverbank  along  the  flood  embankments  in  the  PIRDP  and  MDIP,  following  an  \u201cadaptive \napproach\u201d to protect and stabilize the riverbank along smooth alignments that are parallel to the \nriver systems without changing the flow pattern, thereby reducing turbulence and the resulting \nscour  more  effectively  than  active  structures  that  control  and  stand  against  the  channel  flows \nmore directly. An estimated total of 7.0 km and 4.4 km reach of riverbank will be protected in the \nPIRDP and MDIP, respectively.5 The protection works will comprise (i) riverbank revetment with \nlaunching aprons using sand-filled graded geotextile bags that start to fall down and cover the \neroding banks as the scour holes develop, (ii) upper bank line revetment with concrete blocks, \nand (iii) grass turfing along a strip of the bank at the crest of the revetment.6 (See Figure A11.3 \nfor illustrative figure of erosion control mechanism.) \n\nThe placement of protection works will follow a phased and process-type approach. The \n12. \nworks during years 1 and 2 will consist of a pilot-cum-implementation approach to reconfirm and \ndefine  optimal  design  criteria  and  implementation  approaches  with  intensive  monitoring  and \nevaluation. Specifically, protection works will initially concentrate on the most critical reaches of \nthe  bank  line  along  the  PIRDP  and  MDIP.  Detailed  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  the \nprotection  measures  will  be  made  in  preparing  the  annual  implementation  plan,  which  will  be \nsubmitted for ADB approval each year. Further reinforcement and extension of protection works \nwill be provided as necessary, in response to the river conditions prevailing at the time, and all \nthreatened  sections  will  be  protected  by  the  end  of  the  implementation  period.  Sufficient \nfinancial provision has been included to cope with the level of the scour depth observed under \nmore active structures applied in Bangladesh.  \n\n2. \n\nPart B: Nonstructural Erosion Impact Mitigation Measures  \n\n13. \nThe  nonstructural  measures  comprise  (i)  community  disaster  preparedness  and \nmanagement,  and  (ii)  resettlement  and  targeted  social  development  support.  These  activities \nwill be implemented primarily during the first half of the implementation period.   \n \n14. \nDisaster  Preparedness  and  Management.  The  Project  will  implement  the  disaster \npreparedness  and  management  plans  in  PIRDP  and  MDIP  to  alleviate  the  suffering  of  the \npeople  in  the  event  of  an  embankment  breach  due  to  an  extreme  flood  event  and/or  sudden \ncollapse of an eroding embankment through (i) strengthening the system to warn stakeholders \n\n                                                 \n5  Morphological analysis has indicated that an additional 3.4 km and 4.4 km of riverbank may have to be protected in \nthe PIRDP and MDIP, respectively, over the project life of 30 years. The proposed Project does not include these \nadditional investments, although their costs and benefits were incorporated in the economic analysis.   \n\n6   In addition, 1.2 km of secondary defense line of embankment will be constructed in the PIRDP to protect the area \n\nfrom a potential breach of a critical section of the embankment with no setback distance to the river channel.  \n\n\f5 \n\nand  relief  organizations,  and  (ii)  enhancing  the  capacity  of  the  people  to  cope  with  the  threat. \nFor  these  purposes,  the  Project  will  provide  training  to  community  leaders  and  stakeholders, \ninitiate a public awareness campaign, and provide advisory support for the operation of the plan \nby community representatives. An awareness campaign about groundwater arsenic will also be \nincluded  to  promote  other  ongoing  programs  for  testing  and  mitigation.  An  experienced \nnongovernment organization (NGO) will be engaged to undertake these activities. \n\n15. \nResettlement and Targeted Social Development Support. About 57 ha of land will be \nacquired  for  the  Project  to  implement  the  proposed  riverbank  protection  works,  comprising  35 \nha in the PIRDP and 22 ha in the MDIP, which would be lost to erosion without the Project. Due \nto the dynamic riverine environment, specific project-affected persons (PAPs) and the amount of \nland required are to be finalized during the final design stage.7 PAPs will receive compensation \nand  resettlement  benefits  in  accordance  with  ADB  policy  and  guidelines.  A  resettlement \nframework has been prepared to stipulate the procedures and arrangements. \n\n16. \nThe Project will also provide social development support to the vulnerable people living \nin the project area who are displaced by the ongoing river erosion process. Primarily focusing \non  the  most  vulnerable  groups  such  as  female-headed  households  currently  living  as  illegal \nsquatters on the flood embankments and vulnerable PAPs, support will be provided through an \nexperienced  NGO  for  group  formation  and  community  campaign  for  health,  hygiene  and \neducation awareness, and training on practical knowledge for income generation.8   \n\n3. \n\nPart C: Institutional Strengthening  \n\nThe  institutional  strengthening  component  will  consist  of  (i)  capacity  development  and \n\n17. \nproject management, and (ii) information management.  \n\na. \n\nCapacity Development and Project Management \n\n18. \nThis  subcomponent  comprises  (i)  establishment  and  operation  of  permanent  project \ninstitutions including joint management committees (JMCs) and their affiliated government and \nstakeholder organizations, (ii) national level programming and coordination, and (iii) training of \nproject  personnel  and  stakeholders.  Services  by  consultants  and  NGOs  will  be  provided  to \nsupport these activities, along with the necessary hardware and software.   \n\n19. \nPermanent Project Level Institutions Including JMCs. Following the 1999 NWP and  \nBWDB Act 2000,9 the Government is to establish and operate a JMC for each subproject, which \ncomprises  representatives  of  line  agencies,  local  governments,  and  stakeholders  of  diverse \n\n                                                 \n7   An additional 10 ha of land is required for the construction of the secondary defense line of embankments. \n8  A separate program to enhance the poverty reduction impact of these most vulnerable people has been prepared \nand submitted to the Government of Japan for funding through the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR). The \nJFPR  will  pilot  test  and  establish  effective  community-based  self-help  mechanisms  of  engaging  the  most \nvulnerable  erosion-affected  poor  in  permanent  employment  activities  associated  with  water  management. \nSpecifically,  beneficiaries  will  be  provided  with  opportunities  to  relocate  themselves  to  more  secure  public  land \nwithin  the  embankments  and  to  undertake  income-generating  activities  such  as  nursery  development  and  social \nforestry, fish culture and livestock breeding using the water management facilities, in return for their engagement in \nroutine  O&M  works  on  the  concerned  facilities.  The  total  JFPR  grant  is  estimated  at  $1,000,000.  Lessons  and \nexperiences  learned  from  the  pilot  activities  will  be  used  as  a  model  for  future  replication  by  the  Government  in \nother erosion-prone areas.  \n\n9   The Act stipulated the new organizational structures and operational arrangements of BWDB following the NWP, \nincluding  the  newly-established  Governing  Council  that  include  diverse  stakeholder  representatives  and  local \nexperts to decide on policy matters, procedures for scheme management transfer, and arrangements for improved \naccountability and transparency, among others.   \n\n\f6 \n\nprofessions  including  those  in  WMAs  and  vulnerable  social  groups.  The  JMCs  will  govern  the \ndecisions  regarding  water  resources  management  activities  in  the  project  area,  including \nriverbank  erosion  management,  irrigation  and  drainage  O&M,  and  agricultural  and  fisheries \ndevelopment.  The  JMCs  will  form  a  basis  for  managing  water  resources  from  an  integrated \nperspective as promoted under the NWP.  \n\n20. \nFor the purpose of establishing sound JMCs and its subsidiary stakeholder institutions, \nthe  Project  will  provide  support  to  establish,  strengthen,  and  operate  the  concerned  project \ninstitutions,  including  the  JMCs,  local  project  offices,  and  the  diverse  stakeholder  institutions \nincluding  WMAs  that  will  represent  the  JMCs  through  provision  of  consulting  services  and \ncommunity-based  organizers  (CBOs)  for  beneficiary  mobilization  and  participation.  Assistance \nby  consultants  will  be  provided  primarily  to  establish  and  operate  effective  procedures  and \narrangements  along  with  human  resources  capacities  for  annual  programming  encompassing \nrelevant  project  activities;  design,  implementation,  monitoring,  and  evaluation;  emergency \nworks;  management  of  environmental,  social,  and  resettlement  issues;  resource  mobilization; \nand preparation of annual reports. Specific efforts will be made to ensure that (i) JMCs play a \nprominent  role  in  guiding  project  activities,  maintaining  effective  coordination  with  and  gaining \nsupport  from  the  affiliated  institutions;  (ii)  the  project  offices  establish  mechanisms  for  sound \nconstruction  supervision,  operation  monitoring,  and  performance  evaluation  of  riverbank \nprotection  works;  and  (iii)  all  Project  institutions  charged  with  carrying  out  project  and  O&M \nactivities do so effectively with appropriate resource mobilization.  \n\n21. \nBy the middle of the third year, the project activities will result in significant strengthening \nof  the  institutional  base  of  JMCs  and  stakeholder  institutions  to  be  evidenced  by  (i)  effective \nfunctioning of the JMCs confirmed by its annual reports, (ii) WMA enrollment of at least 70% of \nagriculture and fish culture beneficiaries, and (iii) collection of stipulated beneficiary contribution \ntargets. By the end of the Project, all institutions will have sufficient local capacity to undertake \nProject-related activities without substantial external support, with necessary capacity retention \nand financial resource allocation mechanisms ensured at the national level.  \n\n22. \nNational  Level  Project  Management  and  REMS  Programming  and  Coordination. \nConsulting  services  will  be  provided  to  (i)  assist  the  central  project  office  operations  for \nimplementation,  including  supervision  and  guidance  to  the  JMCs  and  control  of  field  office \nactivities; operation of construction quality control and operational monitoring; and processing of \ndesign, technical specifications, and procurement; and (ii) monitor and advise on national REMS \nprogramming  and  coordination  in  BWDB  including  annual  development  and  revenue  budget \nmanagement,  implementation  coordination,  internal  and  external  audit,  and  preparation  of \nrelevant sections of the BWDB annual report in accordance with the BWDB Act 2000.   \n\nTraining.  The  Project  will  provide  training  for  institutional  strengthening  within  various \n23. \ninstitutions  involved  in  riverbank  erosion  mitigation  and  relevant  water  resources  management \nactivities  in  the  project  area.  While  training  is  aimed  at  enhancing  the  performance  of  those \nactivities  within  the  project  institutions  including  JMCs  and  affiliated  institutions,  it  is  also \nintended  to  enhance  the  long-term  abilities  of  BWDB  to  develop  required  programs  and \ncapacities  within  the  organization  to  train  the  related  project  institutions  and  stakeholder \nrepresentatives. They will be provided through consulting services and the existing government \nline  department  staff  at  the  local  subdistrict  level  who  are  also  trained  by  consultants.  The \nprogram  will  enhance  skills  for  (i)  riverbank  management  including  river  morphology,  design, \nimplementation,  supervision,  monitoring,  environmental  management,  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement;  (ii)  participatory  O&M  for  water  resources  management;  (iii)  management  of  the \n\n\f7 \n\ntechnical  support \n\nfor \nJMCs;  and  (iv) \norganizational management of WMAs. The consultant team will design a capacity development \nplan  (CDP)  having  specific  monitorable  performance  targets  encompassing  the  staff  and \nstakeholder representatives of the relevant institutions, select and contract competent experts to \nprovide training, and supervise and evaluate the delivery of the training under the CDP.   \n\nfisheries  development,  and \n\nfor  agriculture  and \n\nb. \n\nRiverbank Erosion Information Management  \n\nThe Project will strengthen the collection, storage, management, and sharing of data and \n24. \ninformation  relating  to  riverbank  erosion  management  focusing  on  hydrology  and  river \nmorphology  in  the  vicinity  of  the  project  area  along  the  Jamuna  and  Meghna  rivers.  Specific \nactivities  will  consist  of  (i)  updating  and  refining  database  management  arrangements,  (ii) \nimproving and updating the database, (iii) providing data management equipment and software, \nand (iv) analyzing morphological data. In particular, the Project will procure satellite images of \nthe  major  rivers  on  a  regular  basis,  monitor  morphological  changes,  undertake  short-term \nforecasting, and provide warnings to critical locations where land is likely to be eroded. Specific \nattention will be given to the potential morphological impacts of erosion and/or sand deposition \ninduced by the riverbank protection works provided by the Project.  \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n25. \nThe  Project  has  several  features  to  promote  water  resources  sector  reforms  through \ndeveloping  and  establishing  specific  strategies  and  instruments,  and  implementing  key  policy \nand institutional reform principles. These include the following:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  Project  will  establish  cost  effective,  sustainable,  and  innovative  riverbank \nerosion  mitigation  measures  that  could  be  replicable  nationwide  to  protect  the \nlivelihoods  in  poverty-stricken  active  floodplains  through  (a)  an  \u201cadaptive\u201d \napproach  of  protection  works  to  cope  with  the  dynamic  morphological  process, \nand (b) the use of substantially lower cost and labor-intensive alternatives.  \n\nThe Project will put into operation key principles of the 1999 NWP in the PIRDP \nand  MDIP  as  the  leading  large  schemes  where  the  NWP  is  operated.  It  will \nestablish  and  operate  the  JMCs,  which  will  incorporate  diverse  stakeholder \nparticipation,  transparent  and  accountable  decision  making,  and  information-\nbased management with capacity development and retention mechanisms.  \n\nAn  effective  local  O&M  financing  mechanism  will  be  operated  with  necessary \nrevision  of  regulations  to  authorize  project  entities  to  collect  and  retain \nbeneficiary  contributions  at  the  scheme  level.  Contributions  from  other  private \nbeneficiaries  will  also  be  institutionalized.  In  addition  the  Project  will  promote \npolicy actions for improved O&M financing arrangements.  \n\nThe Project will implement a program to stimulate the self-help efforts of the most \nvulnerable  and  the  poorest  people  displaced  by  river  erosion  and  living  on  the \nembankments.  They  will  be  provided  with  opportunities  to  be  organized  into \ngroups,  and  will  be  engaged  in  income  generating  activities  using  water \nmanagement facilities. \n\n\f8 \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n\n26. \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  about  $61.3  million,  of  which  $19.6  million  (32%) \nrepresents the foreign exchange cost, and $41.7 million equivalent (68%) represents the local \ncurrency cost, including taxes and duties of $9.7 million (Table 1). The detailed cost estimates \nand financing plan are shown in Appendix 6.10  \n\n27. \nADB will provide a loan equivalent to $42.2 million from its Special Funds resources to \nfinance about 69% of the total cost of the Project. The loan will finance foreign exchange costs \nestimated at $19.6 million (100% of the total foreign exchange cost) and local costs estimated at \n$22.6  million  equivalent  (53%  of  the  total  local  cost).  The  Government  will  provide  all  the \nremaining local currency costs estimated at $19.1 million equivalent for incremental project staff, \ntaxes  and  duties,  land  acquisition,  and  compensation  and  part  of  the  construction.11  The \nfinancing  plan  is  summarized  in  Table  2.  Local  cost  financing  is  justified  given  the  poverty-\noriented nature of the Project and the tight fiscal situation in the country.  \n\n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nProject Components \n\nI. \n\nBase Cost \n\n  A.

A senior \nengineer at the level of senior superintending engineer, or an additional chief engineer and with \nmultidisciplinary  experience  and  skills  will  head  the  PMO  as  project  director.  The  PMO  will  (i) \nmanage  an  overall  implementation  plan,  annual  work  plans  and  budgets,  and  capacity \ndevelopment plan; (ii) liaise with the BWDB hydrology directorate for the implementation of the \ninformation  management  subcomponent  and  with  the  BWDB  design  directorate  for  structural \ndesign;  (iii)  liaise  with  subproject  directors  and  subproject  management  offices  (SMOs)  in \ndeveloping  subproject  institutions,  preparing  tender  documents,  evaluating  bids,  awarding \ncontracts for equipment, civil works and other project activities including implementation of the \nresettlement  plan,  and  monitoring  of  environmental  and  social  impacts;  (iv)  maintain  and \nmanage  financial  accounts;  (v)  monitor  and  evaluate  the  performance  of  riverbank  protection \nworks and institutions; (vi) prepare periodic reports on implementation progress; and (vii) liaise \nwith  the  benefit  monitoring  unit  for  project  benefits.  The  organizational  chart  for  project \ninstitutions is in Appendix 7.  \n\n29. \nFor  central-level  coordination,  a  project  steering  committee  will  be  formed  comprising \nrepresentatives  of  the  concerned  agencies.  The  secretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources \nwill  chair  the  committee,  with  the  project  director  as  member-secretary.12  Committee  meetings \nwill be held semiannually during the first year and annually from the second year.  \n\n30. \nUnder  the  control  of  the  PMO  and  in  accordance  with  inputs  provided  by  the  JMCs, \nsuperintending  engineers  at  the  Pabna  and  Chandpur  O&M  circles  will  be  appointed  as \nsubproject managers for day-to-day implementation by the concerned SMO. The SMOs will (i) \nprepare and regularly update an overall implementation plan and annual subproject work plans; \n(ii) strengthen the institutional basis of the JMC including WMAs and other local institutions with \nsupport  from  NGOs  and  CBOs;  (iii)  carry  out  field  surveys  and  designs;  (iv)  manage \nconstruction  activities  with  consultants;  (v)  undertake  flood  monitoring  and  emergency \nprotection  works;  (vi)  monitor  and  report  subproject  activities  to  the  PMO;  and  (vii)  coordinate \nwith other agencies, local governments, and NGOs.  \n \nThe SMOs will be established with one construction division and one O&M division, each \n31. \nheaded by a full-time executive engineer, through reorganization of the field office structure of \nthe  CADP,  having  two  O&M  divisions.  The  construction  division  will  have  (i)  a  construction \nsubdivision that will undertake design, construction management of river protection works, and \nrelated  nonstructural  measures;  and  (ii)  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  subdivision,  to  be \npermanently established using human resources from BWDB\u2019s hydrology directorate, which will \nundertake  regular  survey,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  work.  A  resettlement  and  social \ndevelopment section and an environmental management section will be established within the \nconstruction  and  M&E  subdivisions,  respectively,  with  experienced  BWDB  staff.  The  O&M \ndivision  will  undertake  institutional  strengthening  of  the  JMCs  and  its  affiliated  stakeholder \n\n                                                 \n12  The  project  steering  committee  will  include  the  Finance  Division,  Planning  Commission,  Ministry  of  Environment \nand  Forests,  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Livestock,  Local  Government  Division,  Rural \nDevelopment and Cooperatives Division, Ministry of Land, Economic Relations Division, Implementation Monitoring \nand  Evaluation  Division,  and  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  their  concerned  line  departments,  along  with  the \nBangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority. \n\n\f10 \n\ninstitutions,  and  O&M  jointly  with  WMAs  established  following  the  Cooperatives  Societies  Act \n2001,  and  Guidelines  for  Participatory  Water  Management  (2000).  CBOs  will  be  engaged  to \nenhance beneficiary participation in WMAs with performance-based contracts with SMOs. The \nO&M  division  will  also  form  an  emergency  riverbank  protection  groups  (ERPGs)  comprising \nstakeholders living along the protected bank line, who will provide voluntary labor for emergency \nwork during the flood season.13 \n \n32. \nAt  each  subproject  level,  a  JMC  will  be  established  in  accordance  with  both  the  1999 \nNWP and the BWDB Act 2000. A JMC will be chaired by the head of the SMO and will comprise \nlocal representatives of the line departments, heads of divisions in the SMO, representatives of \nlocal  governments  at  the  municipal  committee  and  union  parishad  chairperson  level,  WMAs,  \nERPGs,  and  other  stakeholder  institutions,  with  an  executive  engineer  of  a  concerned  O&M \ndivision as member-secretary.14 The JMC will guide the activities of the SMO and contribute to \ndecisions  related  to  project  activities,  such  as  (i)  annual  programs  and  budget,  (ii)  monitoring \nand  emergency  plans  for  the  flood  season,  (iii)  work  plan  for  the  dry  season,  (iv)  capacity \ndevelopment  plans,  (v)  local  resource  mobilization  plans,  and  (vi)  annual  reports.  It  will  also \nform  a  construction  inspection  group,  with  an  effective  grievance  redressing  mechanism  to  be \ndesigned  by  consultants.  Initially,  an  adhoc  JMC  will  be  formed,  with  the  participation  of  the \nstipulated  members,  and  its  operation  will  be  assisted  by  the  consultants.  On  the  basis  of  the \ninitial  operation,  a  detailed  organizational  setup  and  operational  arrangements  will  be  further \nrefined and finalized at the time of the MTR, based on which BWDB will issue an official gazette \nto formally establish and operate the JMCs by the end of the third year.  \n\n33. \nIn support of the actual operation of the JMCs, the Project will utilize existing institutions \nat  the  local  level  along  with  available  external  services.  Specifically,  the  SMOs  will  coordinate \nwith  the  Department  of  Agricultural  Extension  and  the  Department  of  Fisheries  so  that  their \ntechnical support will be provided to WMAs for agriculture and fisheries development, based on \ntheir  institutional  performance  such  as  membership  enrollment  and  O&M  contributions.  The \nLocal  Government  Division  will  be  coordinated  to  provide  training  to  concerned  local \ngovernment  representatives  in  the  JMCs.  The  Department  of  Cooperatives  will  provide \nregulatory  support  to  WMAs  while  providing  specific  training  for  WMA  management.  The \nDepartment  of  Environment  will  approve  the  environmental  impact  assessment  of  the  Project \nand will monitor its impacts. The specific cooperation arrangements will be agreed upon under \nthe memorandum of understanding between BWDB and the concerned agencies by the end of \nthe first year, with necessary activity funds released from the PMO through the SMO. \n  \nCapacity  Development  and  Retention.  Deployment  of  qualified  staff  and  developing \n34. \nand  retaining  capacities  are  crucial  for  the  sustainable  performance  of  the  riverbank  erosion \nmitigation  measures  and  institutions  established  and  developed  under  the  Project.  As  an \nimportant step to ensure capacity retention between the construction and O&M phase, BWDB is \nto  merge  its  central  Implementation  and  O&M  wings  and  their  subordinate  field  offices.  In  the \ncontext of the Project, BWDB will create a pool of highly qualified river engineers and engineers \n                                                 \n13 Upon completion of the Project, each SMO will in principle be placed under the chief engineer of the concerned \nzone. Regarding the PMO, the Government intends to undertake further sector interventions, at which time it would \ncontinue its function as a focal point with necessary reorganization within central BWDB. \n\n14  The  JMC  will  comprise  one  subdistrict  representative  each  from  the  Department  of  Agricultural  Extension, \nDepartment of Cooperatives, Department of Environment, Department of Fisheries, and Bangladesh Inland Water \nTransport Authority; heads of divisions of the SMO; the chairperson of the municipal committee; three union council \nchairpersons nominated by subdivision coordination committee; four representatives of WMAs comprising different \nprofessions;  a  representative  from  Information  and  Resources  Center  to  be  established  under  JFPR;  and  two \nrepresentatives from ERPGs. The concerned subdivision head officer, consultants, and representatives of the PMO \nand local NGOs will also participate as nonvoting advisors.  \n\n\f11 \n\nwith  institutional  development  capacities  by  ensuring  acquisition,  development,  and  field \npractice of the concerned skills during the progress of their career path. Top officials posted to \nthe  Project  as  project  director,  subproject  managers,  and  executive  engineers  will  have  fixed \ntenure of sufficient duration to maintain continuity of leadership roles, institutional building, and \ntechnology  transfer.  BWDB  will  prepare  a  policy  and  service  rules  for  recruitment,  promotion, \ntransfer, and job rotation, which will be issued upon clearance of its Governing Council.    \n \n35. \nOperation and Maintenance. In line with the 1999 NWP, O&M of the riverbank erosion \nprotection works and flood control, drainage and irrigation (FCDI) facilities will be undertaken by \nthe SMOs with overall control, supervision, and support from BWDB and the JMCs. The annual \nO&M plans will be prepared by the SMOs\u2019 M&E subdivisions for riverbank protection works, and \nby  the  O&M  subdivisions  for  FCDI  facilities  in  consultation  with  stakeholder  institutions  and \nthrough  joint  walk-throughs  with  WMAs.  It  will  be  endorsed  by  JMCs  for  implementation,  with \ntheir  periodical  review  and  reendorsement  during  the  year.  Regarding  its  funding,15  NWP \nstipulates that, while water rates are to be charged for O&M of irrigation facilities, cost recovery \nfor flood control, drainage, and river management works is not envisaged, given the public good \nnature  of  the  benefits,  with  a  vision  that  the  funds  be  provided  by  strengthening  the \nGovernment\u2019s  financing  mechanisms  through  sector  reforms.  In  line  with  this,  the  Project  will \naim to (i) enhance irrigation O&M cost recovery from beneficiaries thereby reducing the existing \nO&M budgetary burden of BWDB in the project areas; and (ii) rationalize overall O&M budgetary \nmanagement within BWDB to ensure sufficient funds allocation to the Project.  \n \n36. \nRegarding  the  local  O&M  financing,  the  Project  will  institutionalize  full  recovery  of \nirrigation O&M, the stipulated policy goal, and contributions from other private beneficiaries. As \na key step to improve beneficiary contributions, the Government is in the process of amending \nthe existing rules to the 1983 Water Rate Ordinance to authorize the project entities to collect, \nretain,  and  utilize  the  service  charges  for  their  own  O&M.  In  line  with  this,  BWDB  and  WMAs \nstarted  collecting  charges  in  2002,  with  the  target  of  substantially  recovering  the  cost  of \nirrigation pump operation by fiscal year (FY) 2004. By the end of the Project, SMOs/WMAs will \nachieve  the  full  local  O&M  financing  of  irrigation  canal  O&M  in  addition  to  pump  operations.16 \nFurthermore,  BWDB  will  (i)  establish  and  introduce  water  service  charges  to  beneficiaries \ninvolved in fish culture in areas protected by flood embankments prior to the MTR; (ii) develop, \nin consultation with concerned local governments, an action plan for their contribution to project \nmaintenance works prior to the MTR and operate the mechanism by project completion; and (iii) \nform  ERPGs  prior  to  the  MTR  to  provide  voluntary  labor  for  emergency  maintenance  works \nduring the flood season through entering into agreements with immediate beneficiaries residing \nwithin close vicinity of the protected bank line.  \n \n37. \nTo improve the overall O&M financing in the water sector, BWDB has been undertaking \nseveral  institutional  reform  activities,  including  (i)  rationalization  of  overhead  through  staff \nreduction; (ii) reduction of O&M responsibilities through scheme management transfer; and (iii) \naugmentation of cost recovery from the irrigation project beneficiaries (see Appendix 3 for policy \nand  institutional  actions  relevant  to  the  Project),  which  will  be  reviewed  annually  during  the \nproject  implementation  period.  To  further  ensure  sufficient  O&M  budgetary  allocation  to  the \n                                                 \n15 Riverbank protection works and FCDI facilities are estimated to require annual O&M of about $0.5-1.0 million (for \nadditional  placement  of  geotextile  bags  through  intensive  monitoring)  and  $1.6  million  equivalent,  respectively. \nBWDB\u2019s  annual  recurrent  expenditure  has  been  about  $60  million  in  recent  years,  with  over  $20  million  for \noverhead.   \n\n16 The target for FY2004 is $0.70 million equivalent. For this purpose, the SMOs will enter into service agreements \nwith each water management group within WMAs, to be signed by all farm households, along with undertaking an \nintensive beneficiary mobilization campaign for sound O&M practices within the project area. The agreements will \nbe revised in FY2005 to reflect the renewed targets towards project completion.  \n\n\f12 \n\nProject,  BWDB  will  develop  and  introduce  a  performance-based  O&M  budgetary  allocation \nmechanism  within  the  organization  through  which  sufficient  funds  will  be  reserved  for  and \nallocated to well-performing schemes on a priority basis. Specific policy and administrative rules \nwill be developed with the assistance of the consultants and endorsed by the BWDB Governing \nCouncil by the second year.17 Furthermore, the Government will establish a specific block fund \nthat  can  be  drawn  upon  for  any  follow-on  activities  required  after  the  closing  of  the  loan,  by \nincorporating a 3-year post investment phase into a project concept paper for this purpose.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n38. \nThe  implementation  period  will  be  6  years,  from  January  2003  to  December  2008 \n(Appendix  8).  Riverbank  protection  works  will  be  implemented  starting  January  2003  to  cope \nwith the critical threat of the ongoing progressive river erosion.   \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nGoods and related services, and civil works to be financed from the ADB loan proceeds \n39. \nwill  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Vehicles,  equipment, \nand  materials  will  be  procured  by  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  where  the  cost  is \nvalued  at  more  than  $500,000  equivalent,  or  by  international  shopping  between  $100,000  to \n$500,000 equivalent. Where there are several local suppliers with satisfactory service facilities, \nequipment  or  materials  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  may  be  procured  under  local \ncompetitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures,  or  on  the  basis  of  a  comparison  of  at  least  three \nquotations from the local suppliers when the cost is less than $50,000. \n \n40. \nThe  civil  works  to  be  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  LCB  procedures  among  prequalified  private  local  contractors  acceptable  to \nADB. Given the small nature of individual contracts (less than $2.0 million), the remoteness of \nthe  work  area,  and  the  intermittent  distribution  over  a  6-year  period,  individual  contracts  are \nunlikely to attract international bidders. Domestic contractors have the capacity and capability to \nundertake  the  required  works.  Domestic  contractors  for  these  civil  works  contracts  will  be \nprequalified by the PMO using government procedures acceptable to ADB. Prequalification will \nbe  updated  annually  and  be  based  on  contractor  performance  during  the  previous  year  on \nProject-related works. Indicative contract packages are shown in Appendix 9.   \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n41. \nTo cope with the dynamic morphological process, all bank protection works of any year \nhave  to  be  designed,  implemented,  and  completed  within  one  dry  season.  Successful  project \nimplementation within the tight time schedule will require strong consultant support for BWDB. \nTo  ensure  timely  execution  and  construction  quality,  experienced  international  consultants  will \nbe engaged by the PMO in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and \nother arrangements acceptable to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic consultants. A total \nof 125 person-months of international and 345 person-months of domestic consultant inputs will \nbe  required,  grouped  into  three  packages:  (i)  a  team  of  individually  recruited  consultants  (22 \nperson-months  international  and  47  person-months  domestic)  to  assist  in  the  preparation  and \nimplementation  of  the  urgently  required  bank  protection  works  from  November  2002  to  June \n                                                 \n17  As  a  guide,  specific  criteria  for  eligibility  of  acceptable  performance  will  include  (i)  substantial  local  participation \ndemonstrated  by  WMA  enrollment  of  over  70%  of  beneficiaries  and  satisfactory  annual  joint  preparation  and \nimplementation  of  O&M  plans,  (ii)  satisfactory  achievement  of  water  service  charge  collection,  (iii)  satisfactory \nperformance of farm channel O&M delegated to WMAs, and (iv) substantial achievement of production targets. \n\n\f13 \n\n2003; (ii) a team recruited from a firm (98.5 person-months international and 295 person-months \ndomestic) to undertake overall project management and capacity development from April 2003 \nonwards;  and  (iii)  an  expert  panel  formed  with  individually  recruited  consultants  (4.5  person-\nmonths  international  and  3  person-months  domestic)  to  provide  technical  scrutinization  and \nguidance.  The  consultants  under  the  first  two  packages  are  designated  by  BWDB  as  \u201cthe \nengineer\u2019s representatives\u201d under the standard contract document of ADB for each ICB contract \nfor geotextile bags and each LCB contract for civil works, and will administer the procurement \nand contract management processes for BWDB. Summary terms of reference are in Appendix \n10.  In view of the critical time dependence of the Project and the technical complexity, ADB will \nselect  the  consultants  of  the  three  packages  on  behalf  of  the  Government.  Quality  and  cost-\nbased selection procedures will be applied for the selection of a consulting firm.  \n \nThe services of NGOs are required to carry out (i) resettlement and land acquisition, (ii) \n42. \nsocial  development,  and  (iii)  disaster  preparedness  activities.  Prequalified  NGOs  will  be \ncontracted  on  the  basis  of  LCB  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  summary  terms  of \nreference  of  NGOs  are  shown  in  Appendix  10.  For  timely  implementation  of  urgent  project \nworks,  an  NGO  engaged  for  the  first  activities  has  to  meet  the  following  eligibility  criteria:  (i) \nregistered  under  the  Social  Welfare  Department  or  NGO  Affairs  Bureau;  (ii)  having  at  least  5 \nyears  of  working  experience  in  the  implementation  of  the  relevant  activities  under  externally \nfunded projects, with certificates by the concerned authority to verify satisfactory performance; \n(iii) having audit reports for the past 3 years to verify sufficient financial health; and (iv) having \nevidence of sufficient experienced and trained manpower.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n43. \nThe  Government  will  make  available  to  BWDB  and  the  PMO  through  budgetary \nallocation  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  to  be  applied  to  finance  project  expenditures.  To  expedite \ndisbursements,  BWDB/PMO  will  establish  an  imprest  account,  immediately  after  loan \neffectiveness, with a recognized commercial bank acceptable to ADB. Payments will be made to \nand  from  this  account  for  eligible  expenditures  under  the  Project.  The  imprest  account  will  be \nmanaged  by  BWDB/PMO  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January \n2001), and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the Government and ADB. The initial \namount  of  the  loan  proceeds  released  to  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  6  months  of \nestimated  expenditures  and  not  more  than  10%  of  the  total  loan  amount.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of \nexpenditures  (SOE)  procedures  will  be  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  for \ncontracts  not  exceeding  $50,000  to  liquidate  advances  from  the  imprest  accounts.  For \ndisbursement of loan proceeds, direct payment procedures will be used for eligible expenditures \nincurred  under  contracts  for  geotextile  supply,  consulting  and  NGO  services,  and  civil  works \ncontract valued at more than $1.0 million. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n44. \nBWDB/PMO  and  the  SMOs  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to \nidentify  the  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  the  financing  resources \nreceived, expenditures incurred for the Project, and the use of local funds, in accordance with \ngenerally accepted accounting principles.  Consolidated Project accounts and related financial \nstatements  will  be  compiled  by  BWDB/PMO  and  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  annual  audit  will  include  the  audit  of  the  imprest  account  and  SOE \nprocedures,  and  a  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  SOE \nprocedures  should  be  included  in  the  annual  audit  report.  The  audited  accounts,  audit  report, \nand related financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after the close \n\n\f14 \n\nof  the  fiscal  year  to  which  they  relate.  BWDB/PMO  will  also  prepare  and  submit  quarterly \nprogress  reports  indicating  progress  made,  problems  encountered  during  the  period  under \nreview,  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems,  the  proposed  program  of  activities, \nand  the  expected  progress  during  the  following  quarter.  A  project  completion  report  will  be \nprepared and submitted to ADB within 3 months after physical completion of the Project.   \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe performance monitoring and evaluation of the Project will be carried out under the \n45. \ndirection  of  the  PMO.  Data  for  implementation-related  monitoring  including  those  related  to \nsocial, institutional, and environmental issues will be provided by concerned staff of the SMOs, \nwhereas those related to the project benefits will be provided by extension officers of the SMOs, \nprocessed  and  analyzed  by  the  Management  Division  of  BWDB,  and  provided  to  the  PMO. \nWithin  1  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  BWDB  will  have  established  a  management  information \nsystem with the assistance of the main consultants based on the system developed under the \nCADP,  which  will  be  consistent  with  the  project  performance  monitoring  system  in  ADB.  The \nmanagement  information  system  will  be  used  for  implementation,  benefit  monitoring,  and \nevaluation  of  the  two  subprojects.  Necessary  surveys  will  follow  the  prescriptions  of  ADB\u2019s \nHandbook  on  Benefit  and  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  (1992),  Environmental  Guidelines  of \nSelected Agricultural and Natural Resources Development Projects (1991), and Environmental \nAssessment Requirements and Environmental Review Procedures of ADB (1993).    \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\nDetailed technical evaluation of the effectiveness of the erosion mitigation strategy and \n46. \nprotection  measures  will  be  made  in  the  middle  of  year  2,  based  on  which  an  optimal  design \nand implementation approach will be identified for implementation in the subsequent years. This \nwill  be  followed  by  a  comprehensive  MTR  in  year  3,  which  will  evaluate  (i)  Project  progress \nincluding  design,  stakeholder  participation,  construction  quality,  and  possibilities  of  modifying \nthe  project  scope;  (ii)  social  and  environmental  impacts;  (iii)  future  implementation  plans  and \ntargets;  (iv)  effectiveness  of \nimplementation \narrangements;  and  (v)  institutional  sustainability  and  progress  on  developing  an  adequate \ninstitutional framework at all levels.   \n \n\nthe  project  management  structures  and \n\n9. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n\nGiven  the  critical  threat  of  the  progressive  river  erosion  to  undercut  the  flood \n47. \nembankments  in  the  PIRDP  and  MDIP  during  the  2003  monsoon  season,  thereby  causing \nsubstantial  flood  damage  there,  the  Project  needs  to  implement  and  complete  significant \nprotection  works  during  the  dry  season  of  2002/03.  This  requires  initiation  of  preconstruction \nactivities  in  November  2002.  To  achieve  this  end,  ADB  has  approved  advance  action  and \nretroactive  financing  for  recruitment  of  consultants  and  procurement  of  goods  and  related \nservices  and  civil  works  incurred  under  the  Project,  from  25  June  2002  to  the  date  of \neffectiveness  of  the  ADB  loan.  For  the  timely  implementation  of  the  urgently  required  project \nworks, it is estimated that the Government will have to enter into contracts with consultants and \ngeotextile bag suppliers amounting to $4.2 million equivalent, and mobilize necessary payments \nprior  to  loan  effectiveness.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  such  advance  action  and \nretroactive financing do not commit ADB to finance the Project.  \n\n\f15 \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nTechnical Issues \n\n48. \nThe  Project  aims  to  establish  cost  effective,  sustainable  and  innovative  riverbank \nprotection  measures.  However,  river  morphology  in  the  Jamuna  and  the  Meghna  rivers  is \ngenerally highly dynamic, for which accurate prediction is not possible beyond the short term of \n2\u20133  years.  In  response  to  the  uncertainty  of  morphological  behavior  beyond  short  terms,  an \n\u201cadaptive  approach\u201d  was  developed,  which  will  place  protection  works  as  and  where  needed \nand along the smooth and flat alignments that are natural to the river system, and stabilize the \nchannel along those alignments with sufficient design to withstand further scour. Following this \napproach, the Project will protect over 50% of the bank lines along the flood embankments of \nthe  PIRDP  and  MDIP.18  Over  the  long  period  of  years,  the  entire  bank  line  may  have  to  be \nprotected, although a major morphological change has to happen to necessitate the protection \nof the remaining sections,19 and the morphological attack on the bank line protected under the \nProject  would  recede  under  such  circumstance.  In  the  project  design,  the  costs  of  these \nadditional works are incorporated in the economic analysis over its 30-year economic life, with a \nsensitivity analysis of adverse morphological scenario where protection works for the remaining \nsections  are  placed  immediately  after  project  completion,  in  justifying  the  project  investment. \n(See overall technical assessment in Appendix 11.) \n\n49. \nThe selected design option under this approach is the revetment with launching aprons \nof sand-filled graded geotextile bags placed in the river at the top of the eroding bank. The large \namount of bags built up along the bank will slide down the slope when river erosion undercuts it \nand  will  cover  the  bank  to  arrest  the  erosion.  Concrete  slabs  will  be  placed  on  the  prepared \nslope above low water level to provide a layer resistant to wave erosion. The bank protection is \nbased  on  the  intensive  monitoring  of  river  conditions  and  short-term  morphological  prediction \nusing  satellite  images  and  is  provided  to  cover  the  critical  sections  of  the  riverbank.  All \nprocesses  including  survey,  design,  and  construction  need  to  be  carried  out  rapidly  after  the \nmonsoon floods and completed during the subsequent dry season.  \n\n50. \n A \u201claunching revetment\u201d using hard materials has been successfully implemented with \nlow annual maintenance costs of about 0.4% of investment costs in the Mississippi River, which \nhas similar morphological characteristics to the major rivers in Bangladesh. However, the same \nmeasure using geotextile bags has limited application history.20 While intensive data collection \nand  physical  model  testing  undertaken  during  the  PPTA  and  performance  monitoring  of \ngeotextile  bags  placed  during  the  interim  works  by  the  Government  in  2001  and  2002  have \nprovided  positive  indications,  there  remain  some  technical  uncertainties  for  which  verification \nwill  require  intensive  field  monitoring,  such  as  launching  performance  in  deeper  scours.  To \naddress  those  risks,  the  project  design  has  incorporated  built-in  contingencies  amounting  to \nover  23%  of  base  cost,  comprising  physical  contingencies  (10%),  adoption  of  conservative \ndesign  scour  depth  (which  amounts  to  over  10%),21  and  reserve  stockpiles  (about  3%). \nIntensive  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  performance  of  the  protection  works  will  be \nundertaken  during  the  first  two  years  with  the  support  of  the  independent  panel  of  experts, \n\n                                                 \n18 Flood embankments have crest levels that can withstand the levels of floods with 100-year return period. \n19  The remaining bank lines that will not be covered under the Project in the PIRDP and MDIP have been stable for \n\nabout 20 years and 10 years without any erosion, respectively.  \n\n20 This is because conventional hard materials are readily available in the United States at cheap cost, which is not \n\nthe case in Bangladesh, where they are twice as costly as sand-filled geotextile bags. \n\n21 The design scour depth is -30m for PIRDP and -20m for MDIP from the low water level respectively for the whole \nprotected bank line. This is designed to withstand major floods with high return period, although a partial failure and \nrehabilitation may be required in the event and at the point of an extreme attack.   \n\n\f16 \n\nbased  on  which  an  optimal  and/or  modified  design  and  implementation  approach  will  be \nidentified and adopted as required for the remaining implementation period.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n51. \nEconomic analysis was carried out for the PIRDP and MDIP to evaluate the returns on \nproject investments (Appendix 12), with its economic life of 30 years. The major benefits of the \nProject are also shown in Appendix 1 as output performance targets. The estimated economic \ninternal rates of return (EIRRs) are 16.7% for the PIRDP and 31.4% for the MDIP. The EIRR for \nthe PIRDP is lower due to the longer bank sections that have to be protected and the deeper \nscour  depth  seen  in  the  Jamuna  River.  Sensitivity  analysis  was  undertaken  to  test  the  project \nviability covering a range of scenarios including the uncertain and dynamic morphology. In the \nPIRDP, the EIRR in the event of a 20% decrease in incremental future agricultural and fishery \ndevelopment will reduce the EIRR to 14.0%. A 20% increase in protection works will reduce the \nEIRR  to  12.6%.22  A  significant  morphological  change  that  necessitates  the  protection  of  the \nremaining riverbank sections immediately after the Project will also reduce the EIRR to 13.1%. \nOn  the  other  hand,  at  the  MIRDP  the  EIRR  remains  significantly  above  20%  in  all  of  these \nscenarios. These indicate that an investment in the MDIP is fairly robust, whereas in the PIRDP \nit  is  relatively  vulnerable,  although  it  remains  viable  in  all  sensitivity  analysis  cases.  However, \nthe PIRDP has a higher poverty incidence, with high poverty impact ratio (para. 52).23  \n \nC. \n\nPoverty Impacts \n\n52. \nThe  Project  will  have  direct  positive  impacts  on  the  income  and  employment \nopportunities  and  the  food  security  situation  of  poor  people.  According  to  the  sample \nsocioeconomic  survey,  poverty  incidence  among  the  beneficiary  households  in  the  irrigation \ncommand  area  and  adjacent  riverine  areas  of  the  PIRDP  and  MDIP  is  lower  than  in  the \nneighboring  areas  by  about  10-15%,  although  it  is  still  53%  and  47%,  respectively,  which  is \nhigher than the national average of 44% in 2000. Over the years, there has been a significant \nincrease  in  production  and  yield  of  rice  crops  and  a  reduction  in  poverty,  thanks  to  the \nimplementation  of  the  CADP.  Overall,  the  poor  may  attain  a  total  of  about  45%  and  42%  of \ndirect and indirect project benefits in the PIRDP and MDIP, respectively, when production and \nlabor  benefits  are  taken  into  account.  These  benefits  will  be  lost  due  to  erosion  under  the \nwithout-project scenario, reversing the trend of poverty reduction (Appendix 13).  \n \n53. \nThe  causes  of  poverty  in  the  project  areas  are  multidimensional.  In  both  areas,  the \ndistribution of existing resources such as land is extremely skewed. The landless and marginal \nhouseholds  together  account  for  about  62%  and  74%  of  total  households  in  the  PIRDP  and \nMDIP,  respectively.  As  these  areas  are  erosion-prone,  a  large  number  of  households  may \nfurther  lose  their  homesteads,  cultivable  land,  and  other  assets  completely  and  become \nassetless. A vast majority of people displaced by erosion have remained in the area, adding to \nthe  existing  number  of  poor  households.24  Groundwater  arsenic  is  also  a  major  concern,  with \n17% and 90% of the tubewells contaminated in the PIRDP and MDIP, respectively.25 Traditional \nsocial and local power structure induced an increased dependence of the poor while excluding \n\n                                                 \n22  The possibility for such increase may be low, given that the design of the projection works has already incorporated \n\na built-in contingency of over 23% (para 50). \n\n23 There are also unquantified benefits such as avoidance of human injuries, loss of livestock and household assets, \nas well as indirect benefits generated by the current agricultural production such as processing and/or trading of \nagricultural inputs and products, and other relevant nonfarm activities, which will be lost without the Project.    \n24  Over the past 15 years, 2,500 and 4,000 households have lost their assets in the PIRDP and MDIP, respectively.  \n25  Testing and marking of wells is being carried out under the ongoing programs, which the Project will also promote \n\nthrough awareness campaign under the disaster management subcomponent.  \n\n\f17 \n\nthem  from  the  political  and  social  processes.  From  the  socioeconomic  survey,  it  appears  that \nthe critical causes of poverty in the project area are income poverty, lack of human development \nsuch as education, health and nutrition and of empowerment of the poor and women. \n\nD. \n\nSocial Development Strategy  \n\n54. \nThe  Project\u2019s  strategy  for  social  development  will  include  the  following,  focusing  on  \npoverty  reduction  among  project  beneficiaries.  (The  Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social \nStrategy is shown in Appendix 13.) The project area does not have any indigenous peoples. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nIn  line  with  the  1999  NWP,  which  promotes  participatory  and  comprehensive \nmanagement  of  water,  the  Project  will  include  in  the  JMCs  the  participation  of  all \nstakeholders  including  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups,  who  will  be  treated  as \npeople\u2019s representatives and will be empowered equally as part of the JMCs.    \n\nGroups comprising the most vulnerable segments of the population will be formed for \nself-help  empowerment,  with  specific  targets  to  include  female-headed  and  the \nlowest  income  households,  who  will  be  given  opportunities  to  be  engaged  in  \npermanent income-generating activities using water management facilities.  \n\nSpecific  efforts  will  be  made  to  increase  the  participation  and  the  role  of  women  in \nWMAs  and  JMCs.  To  ensure  this,  the  Project  will  (a)  set  up  a  special  network  for \nwomen WMA members, (b) fix targets for enrollment of female WMA members, and  \n(c) provide special training for women-only groups. \n\nFurther  efforts  will  be  made  to  engage  the  local  population,  in  particular  poor  and \nvulnerable  people,  as  construction  laborers  for  riverbank  stabilization  works,  for \nwhich wage rates will be fixed transparently.  \n\n \nE. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts  \n\n55. \nAn  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was  carried  out  during  the  feasibility \nstudies.26 The Project will have overall beneficial impacts, preserving the existing and potential \nbenefits of the PIRDP and MDIP schemes as well as protecting the livelihood of the population \nin  the  erosion-prone  areas  nearby.  Potential  negative  impacts  identified  under  summary \nenvironmental impact assessment (SEIA) include (i) mining, transportation and storage of sand; \n(ii)  construction-related  impacts  including  health  hazards  and  accidental  injury  of  workers;  (iii) \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement;  and  (iv)  possible  erosion  of  sandbars/chars  and  changes  in \nriver  morphology.  On  these  accounts,  the  impact  of  sand  mining  will  be  negligible,  given  the \namount of sand required for construction during the 6-year Project of about 1 million metric tons \ncompared with the annual bed load transport of the Jamuna and the lower Meghna of more than \n150 and 200 million metric tons. The morphological impacts are also estimated to be limited, as \nthe  structures  do  not  confront  the  flow  and  cause  great  scouring.  The  sandbars  and  the  char \nclosest to the protected portion are uninhabited and largely without vegetation. The Project will \nclosely  monitor  the  morphological  process,  and  if  significant  changes  originate  from  the \nprotection works, a compensation program will be implemented. \n \n56. \nKey  mitigation  measures  include  (i)  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  of  affected  people \nprior to displacement from housing and loss of income and assets on the land; (ii) construction \nsite  management  including  labor  camps,  water  supply  and  drainage,  waste  and  spoil \nmanagement,  emergency  facilities,  and  restoration  of  land;  and  (iii)  monitoring  of  the \n\n                                                 \n26  EIA and the summary EIA (SEIA) were submitted by the Government to ADB on 14 May 2002 with authorization \n\nfor publication. The SEIA was circulated to the Board on 11 July 2002. \n\n\f18 \n\nenvironment  and  river  morphology  for  implementation  of  necessary  remedial  actions.  These \nwere incorporated in the environmental management plan (EMP) in EIA and in the SEIA.27 The \noverall responsibility for implementing the EMP will be with the PMO, with the assignment of an \nexperienced executive engineer as chief resettlement and environmental officer, to be assisted \nby  consultants.  At  the  level  of  each  SMO,  an  M&E  subdivision  and  construction  subdivision \nunder  the  construction  division  of  the  SMO  will  be  responsible  for  environmental  and \nresettlement management, respectively, with the assignment of subdivisional engineers as their \nsupervisors, and with necessary support for capacity development under the Project.     \n\nF. \n\nResettlement \n\n57. \nThe Project will involve a total of (i) 11.4 km of revetment works in the PIRDP and MDIP; \nand  (ii)  1.2  km  of  secondary  defense  line  (SDL)  of  embankments  in  the  PIRDP,  which  will \nrequire  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  amount  of  land  acquired  for  revetment  is \nestimated at 35 ha in the PIRDP and 22 ha in the MDIP. These are located along the eroding \nbank line, which would be lost without project intervention. The SDL will require 10 ha of land \nacquisition.28  A  resettlement  framework  for  revetment  works  and  a  short  resettlement  plan  for \nSDL  were  prepared  for  the  Project  (Appendix  14  for  summary  resettlement  framework  and \nresettlement plan). \n\nThe  resettlement  activities  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  involuntary \n58. \nresettlement and other social safeguard policies. Under the Project, the resettlement framework \nwas  prepared  to  cover  the  riverbank  protection  work.  The  main  principles  of  the  framework \ninclude (i) eligibility for all types of losses (land, crops/trees, structures, business/employment, \nand workdays/wages) associated with the project works including losses to nontitled people; (ii) \ninformation  dissemination  and  consultation  with  PAPs;  (iii)  improving  or  at  least  restoring  the \npre-project living standards of PAPs; (iv) compensating for acquired assets at full replacement \nvalue  with  other  resettlement  allowances  for  shifting  and  compensation  for  lost  income;  (v) \nproviding  special  additional  assistance  to  PAPs  of  female-headed  and  other  vulnerable \nhouseholds; (vi) providing priority assistance to PAPs in the social development program under \nthe  Project;  and \nlands, \nstructures/immovable  properties,  and  other  eligible  benefits  prior  to  award  of  civil  works \ncontracts that include ground leveling and demolition of structures.  \n\ncompensation  payments \n\n(vii)  providing \n\nfor  acquired \n\nThe  PMO  has  overall  planning, \n\nfinancing,  and  supervisory  responsibilities \n\n59. \nfor \nresettlement plan preparation and implementation, which will be carried out by the SMOs with \ntheir  resettlement  and  social  development  officers,  with  the  engagement  of  an  experienced \nNGO and consultants. Upon finalizing the specific sites and design of bank stabilization works in \neach year in response to the shifting of the riverine environment, the SMOs with the assistance \nof  consultants,  will  prepare  full  or  short  resettlement  plans,  which  will  be  sent  to  ADB  for \napproval. The resettlement plans will then be implemented with the assistance of the NGO, with \na  grievance  redressing  mechanism  by  representatives  of  the  PMO,  PAPs,  local  governments, \nand the NGO. The PMO will prepare and submit to ADB an annual report on the land acquisition \nand  resettlement  issues.  An  independent  M&E  agency  will  also  be  engaged  to  assess  the \nperformance and impacts.  \n\n                                                 \n27 The key cost provisions in the EMP supervised by the chief resettlement and environmental officer include (i) land \nacquisition and resettlement ($1.9 million equivalent), (ii) temporary compensation and environmental works during \nconstruction ($0.53 million), (iii) disaster preparedness ($0.10 million), (iv) river monitoring ($0.90 million), and (v) \nproject management and capacity development on environmental management ($0.17 million).   \n\n28  Three  households  (18  people)  will  be  relocated  and  an  additional  30  households  will  experience  some  loss  of \n\nagricultural lands. \n\n\f19 \n\nG. \n\nRisks  \n\n60. \nThe Project has certain risks that could adversely affect the effective implementation and \nsustainability  of  its  benefits.  These  risks  include  (i)  technical  and  morphological  risks  of  the \nselected  design  measures,  (ii)  risks  of  implementation  in  terms  of  delivering  the  required \nservices  and  works  appropriately  within  the  limited  construction  period,  and  (iii)  O&M \nsustainability.  The  project  design  has  incorporated  measures  mitigating  those  risks  to  the \nmaximum possible extent.   \n\n61. \nRegarding  the  technical  risks  associated  with  the  limited  experience  of  the  revetment \nusing  geotextile  bags,  significant  contingencies  have  been  built  in  through  adoption  of \nconservative  design  scour  depth  and  stockpiling  arrangements  (para.  50),  with  economic \nsensitivity  analysis  of  a  further  cost  increase  by  20%  to  justify  the  investment.  Similarly, \nsensitivity analysis of significantly more severe morphological change was carried out to assess \nthe  viability  against  the  morphological  risks.  Project  implementation  also  envisages  intensive \nM&E with the involvement of an external panel of experts.  \n\n62. \nThe implementation risk is associated with the critical need to undertake and complete \nbank protection works of any year within one dry season, including during 2002/03 dry season. \nThis  requires  expeditious  fielding  of  consultants,  procurement,  and  implementation  of \nresettlement  activities,  and  stringent  quality  control.  The  project  design  has  included  the \narrangements for engaging consultants for pre-construction services and contract management \nas  \u201cthe  engineers  representatives.\u201d  ADB  is  also  to  select  consultants  on  behalf  of  the \nGovernment.  The  Government  also  initiated  necessary  advance  actions  to  ensure  the  timely \ninitiation of the project activities.     \n\n63. \nFinally,  there  is  a  sustainability  risk  associated  with  (i)  local  institutional  development, \nand (ii) BWDB capacities to rationalize and prioritize O&M budgetary management. To address \nthese  risks,  the  Project  has  incorporated  institutional  support  to  strengthen  the  capacities  of \nBWDB  engineers,  extension  officers,  CBOs,  and  other  JMC  representatives.  Regarding  the \nO&M  funding  sustainability,  specific  arrangements  to  ensure  the  sufficient  allocation  of  O&M \nfunds  to  the  Project  were  agreed  upon  with  the  Government,  including  the  introduction  of  a \nperformance-based O&M budgetary allocation mechanism to the project entities having eligible \ninstitutional performance as monitored through specific indicators.  \n\n \n\n \n(i) \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \n\n64. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:   \n\nThe  Government  will  annually  update  the  status  of  implementation  of  the  staff \nreduction plan, scheme management transfer plan, and overall annual O&M and \nforward the report to ADB for consultation.     \n\n(ii)  Within 1 year of the effectiveness date, BWDB will transform its Implementation \n\nand O&M wings into two O&M wings with job demarcations satisfactory to ADB.  \n\n(iii)  Within  1  year  of  the  effectiveness  date,  BWDB  will  prepare  policy  and  service \n\nrules for recruitment, promotion, and job rotation satisfactory to ADB.  \n\n\f20 \n\n(iv) \n\nBy  the  loan  closing  date,  BWDB  will  convert  staff  positions  in  the  M&E \nsubdivisions  of  SMOs  to  permanent  positions  through  reorganization  of  existing \nstaff positions in the concerned circles of BWDB. \n\n(v)  Within  1  year  of  the  effectiveness  date,  the  Government  will  revise  the  rules  to \nthe 1983 BWDB Water Rate Ordinance and formally authorize the project entities \nto collect, retain, and utilize the service charges at their own discretion. \n\n(vi)  Within  2  years  of  the  effectiveness  date,  BWDB  will  develop  a  binding \noperational  policy  and  rules  to  operate  the  performance-based  O&M  budget \nallocation and management system satisfactory to ADB, to be fully operational by \nloan closing.  \n\n(vii) \n\nBWDB  will  ensure  that  the  cost  of  irrigation  O&M  will  be  increasingly  born  by \nWMAs,  with  achievement  of  WMA  O&M  cost  recovery  for  irrigation  pump \noperation  by  FY2004.  This  will  be  further  expanded  to  cover  secondary  and \ntertiary canal O&M by loan closing.  \n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  further  ensure  sustainable  O&M  funding  of  the  bank \nstabilization  works  through  provision  of  a  block  fund  under  the  project  concept \npaper for the Project, which can be drawn for this purpose after loan closing.     \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nThe Government will ensure that all environmental mitigation measures identified \nand  included  in  the  EIA  and  SEIA  will  be  incorporated  in  the  detailed  design  of \nthe civil works and duly followed during implementation. \n\nthat \n\nBWDB  will  ensure \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  are \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the \nGovernment,  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement,  as  set  out  in  the \nagreed resettlement framework and resettlement plan. \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nIn view of the urgency of implementing the bank protection works during the 2002/03 dry \n\n65. \nseason, only general conditions for loan effectiveness will apply under the Project.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n66. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  31,975,000  to  the  People's  Republic  of \nBangladesh for the Jamuna-Meghna River Erosion Mitigation Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5% per annum thereafter;

Bangladesh remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with a per \n1. \ncapita income of approximately $360 in 2000. The most recent countrywide poverty data show \nthat  44%  of  the  population  was  poor,  and  20%  extremely  poor.  With  a  population  of  over  130 \nmillion,  Bangladesh  suffers  from  massive  poverty.  It  is  predominantly  a  rural  phenomenon,  as \nmore than 90 % of the poor live in rural areas. It is multifaceted, reflected in low standards of \nliving,  poor  health  and  nutrition,  and  lack  of  education,  abandonment  of  women  and  children, \nand vulnerability to natural disasters such as floods and cyclones. The basic causes of poverty \nare  lack  of  access  to  productive  resources  (mainly  land  and  water);  public  resources  such  as \neducation, health provision, and transport; and jobs. Lack of social and government safety nets \nentitlements  makes  the  land-poor  and  landless  particularly  vulnerable.  Poverty  is  largely \nattributed to weak rural and agricultural development.  \n \nWater  Resources  and  Their  Implications.  Bangladesh  is  in  an  alluvial  deltaic \n2. \nfloodplain  in  the  confluence  of  the  three  major  rivers\u2013the  Ganges  (Padma),  Jamuna \n(Brahmaputra),  and  Meghna,  which  have  a  catchment  area  of  1.74  million  square  kilometers \n(km2) and bring about massive annual floods that inundate up to two thirds of the country. For \nrural  people,  access  to  productive  resources,  particularly  to  land  and  water,  is  of  fundamental \nimportance  to  their  livelihoods,  although  the  people\u2019s  relations  with  water  are  diverse  and \ncomplex. Integrated and sustainable water resource management is required to meet people\u2019s \ndiverse  needs  while  preserving  the  rich  natural  ecosystems  in  the  country\u2019s  extraordinary \nenvironment characterized by (i) severe flooding, which not only inundates large areas but also \nfills river channels with sediment and erodes riverbanks; (ii) limited water during the dry season \nand expanding water demand; (iii) saline intrusion and environmental degradation; (iv) cyclones \nand tidal surges that decimate life and property in the coastal areas; and (v) widespread arsenic \ncontamination of groundwater.  \n \n3. \nAgriculture  is  the  centerpiece  of  the  economy  and  supports  the  vast  majority  of  the  \npopulation, accounting for 32% of gross domestic product (GDP), 13% of exports, and 60% of \nemployment. The sector has exhibited strong growth since the late 1980s, contributing to lower \nfood  grain  prices  and  benefiting  poor  households.  However,  sustaining  agricultural  growth  to \nkeep  pace  with  the  expanding  population  presents  a  fundamental  challenge  where  increased \nirrigation  and  flood  management  is  a  critical  requirement.  The  country  also  needs  to  preserve \nresources  for  capture  fishery  and  expand  culture  fishery  with  effective  flood  management  and \nimproved access rights of the poor to publicly owned water bodies. The natural environment has \nbeen under increasing pressure, with declining soil fertility, land degradation, biodiversity loss, \nand  deteriorating  water  quality  due  to  urbanization  and  intensification  of  agriculture  and  fish \nculture  with  increased  use  of  chemical  inputs.  The  establishment  of  effective  and  sustainable \nwater management systems is an important part of protecting natural resources.  \n \n4. \nSector  Institutions.  The  National  Water  Resources  Council  (NWRC),  chaired  by  the \nPrime  Minister,  is  the  highest  authority  governing  the  water  resources  sector.  The  Water \nResources Planning Organization (WARPO) has been established under the Ministry of Water \nResources  as  the  secretariat  to  the  NWRC.  Some  35  government  organizations  affiliated  with \n13  ministries  have  some  involvement  in  water  resource  management.  The  key  implementing \nagency  among  these  are  the  Bangladesh  Water  Development  Board  (BWDB),  responsible  for \nwater resource projects exceeding 1,000 hectares (ha); and the Local Government Engineering \nDepartment, responsible for projects below 1,000 ha. In general, despite the dire need for sound \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nand  integrated  water  resources  management,  the  country\u2019s  sector  policies  and  institutional \nframework and capacities have been unable to meet these diverse challenges comprehensively \nand  in  a  participatory  and  strategic  manner.  Key  institutional  issues  include  (i)  weakness  in \nparticipatory, integrated, and strategic planning; (ii) agency\u2019s lack of capacity to implement water \nresource  interventions  to  achieve  the  intended  benefits;  (iii)  inability  of  local  institutions  to \nsupport  the  participatory  process;  (iv)  deficient  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  many \npublic schemes due  to insufficient mobilization of funds by central and local governments and \nthe lack of support from beneficiaries; and (v) corruption. \n \n5. \nPast  Interventions  and  Lessons  Learned.  External  funding  agencies  have  provided \nassistance exceeding $2.5 billion to the Bangladesh water resources sector. Of this, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank provided $600 million, and the World Bank $1.0 billion. Bilateral assistance \nhas  been  provided  by  15  countries,  of  which  the  Netherlands  provided  the  most  at  more  than \n$200 million. Funding assistance was relatively low in late 1990s. ADB has provided 17 loans of \nalmost  $600  million  to  water  management  initiatives.  All  investments  resulted  in  increased \nagricultural production although increases were less than anticipated at appraisal. The extent to \nwhich  ongoing  system  maintenance  was  undertaken  governed  the  sustainability  of  these \nproduction  increases.  Environmental  impacts  of  the  investments  were  evaluated  as  generally \neither benign or positive, but the early projects that substantially altered floodplain regimes had \nnegative  impacts  on  open-water  capture  fisheries,  including  the  Pabna  Irrigation  and  Rural \nDevelopment  Project  (PIRDP)  and  Meghna-Dhonagoda  Irrigation  Project  (MDIP).  Key  lessons \nover the past two decades can be grouped into 6 themes:  \n \n(i) \n\nBeneficiary  participation.  Sufficient  time,  resources,  and  a  clear  and  well-defined \nprocess  to  establish  local  organizations  and  their  legal  status  are  essential,  along  with \neffective  management  of  the  participatory  process.  Linkages  to  other  sectors  must  be \nrecognized and reflected in implementation. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nEnvironment. Environmental planning must be undertaken early in the project cycle to \navoid  and  minimize  adverse  environmental  impacts.  Monitoring  of  environmental \nimpacts and implementation of mitigation plan must also be improved.   \n\nPlanning. Rehabilitation of existing systems provides potentially large returns, given the \nsystem\u2019s  quick  gestation  period  and  small  social  and  environmental  impacts.  Planning \nshould  also  be  participatory  and  fully  take  into  account  cross-sectoral  perspectives  to \nmaximize the benefits of potential interventions.  \n\nImplementation. Construction supervision and quality control require rigorous attention, \nas  poor  construction  quality  affects  maintenance  requirements  and  discourages \nbeneficiary  involvement  in  O&M.  Effective  oversight  mechanism  of  the  construction \nprocess should be established.  \n\nO&M. O&M activities need to be planned early in the project cycle and must involve and \ntrain beneficiaries. Project designs must recognize agency capacity to support O&M, and \nbeneficiary  contributions  need  to  be  collected  before  any  commitment  to  proceed  with \nconstruction. Finally, farmers are more likely to contribute to O&M if the level of service \nis high. \n\n(vi)  Management.  The  commitment  of  executing  agencies  to  the  poverty  agenda  must  be \nstrengthened. Management information systems are important and project designs need \nto  clearly  spell  out  arrangements  for  coordinated  support  from  government  agencies. \nDisaster  rehabilitation  projects  require  rapid  preparation  and  simple  disbursement \narrangements to provide timely relief to affected populations. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nRecent Policy and Institutional Reforms. In recent years, the Government has been \n6. \nmaking steady progress in establishing a comprehensive policy, planning, institutional, and legal \nframework  for  the  water  sector.  The  National  Water  Policy  (NWP)  was  approved  in  1999, \nadopting  the  principles  of  integrated  water  resources  management  with  due  emphasis  on \nstakeholder participation, strategic planning, decentralization, sound management of social and \nenvironmental  issues,  sustainable  O&M  through  management  transfer  to  water  management \nassociations  (WMAs),  and  transparency  and  accountability  of  sector  institutions.  BWDB \ninstitutional  reforms  have  also  been  initiated,  which  include  (i)  structuring  of  the  Board  of \ndirectors  to  include  stakeholder  representatives  to  decide  on  policy  issues;  (ii)  long-term \nassignment of leadership; (iii) staff reduction; and (iv) diversification of skill mix. The reform also \nenvisages  transforming  regional  entities  into  autonomous  boards  with  a  similar  participatory \nsetup.  On  the  legal  and  regulatory  side,  the  national  water  act  is  under  preparation  to \ncomprehensively  govern  the  utilization  and  management  of  water.  Guidelines  for  participatory \nwater management (GPWM) have also been finalized, stipulating the management transfer and \nlocal  participation  arrangements  in  water  resources  schemes.  The  Government  also  recently \nprepared  the  national  water  management  plan  (NWMP),  which  lays  out  national  and  regional \nstrategies and priority programs for the next 25 years. \n \n7. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  played  a  key  role  in  promoting  these  sector \nreforms.  Specifically,  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  small-scale  water  resources  subsector1 \nencouraged  the  Government  to  decentralize  the  management  of  small-scale  schemes  to  local \ngovernment  institutions  and  WMAs,  which  was  adopted  in  the  NWP.  The  procedures  and \narrangements  developed  under  the  project  were  also  used  as  a  model  for  GPWM.  The \nassistance  in  the  Command  Area  Development  Project2  is  also  establishing  and  putting  into \noperation the participatory water management framework for large flood control, drainage, and \nirrigation  (FCDI)  schemes  as  a  leading  model  to  apply  the  key  NWP  principles,  including  full \ncost recovery of irrigation O&M by WMAs, and a transparent and accountable joint management \nframework  of  the  Government  and  stakeholders.  ADB  has  also  been  providing  regular  advice \nfor the preparation of NWMP and national water act.   \n \n8. \nADB\u2019s  Sectoral  Operational  Strategy:  Consistent  with  the  Poverty  Reduction \nPartnership  Agreement  (PRPA)  signed  between  ADB  and  and  the  Government  in  April  2000, \nADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  for  Bangladesh  identified  poverty  reduction  as  its  overarching \nobjective.  Given  the  high  incidence  of  rural  poverty,  agriculture  and  rural  sectors  have  been \naccorded  high  priority,  with  operational \nthe  crop/agribusiness  credit,  rural \ninfrastructure,  water  resources  development,  and  microfinance.  In  the  water  resources  sector, \nADB\u2019s strategy is to support the achievement of goals, objectives, and strategies articulated in \nNWP  and  NWMP  within  the  framework  of  the  PRPA  and  country  operational  strategy  which \nemphasizes  (i)  integrated  and  sustainable  water  resource  management  by  enhancing \nstakeholder participation and empowerment, (ii) improving financial efficiency and sustainability, \nand  (iii)  helping  the  poor  rural  population  while  not  disturbing  the  natural  environment. \nDeveloping  policies,  institutional  framework,  and  capacities  of  central  and  local  governments \nand community organizations to apply these principles is accorded high priority, based on which \nassistance to build critical infrastructure will be provided.  \n \n\nfocus  on \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  1995.

The  River  Erosion  Prevention  and  Morphology  Study,  prepared  in \nNovember  2000,  comprised  a  prefeasibility  study  for  several  bank  protection  and  mitigation \nmeasures. Under the current study, a further options assessment was undertaken. Conventional \nstructures such as revetments with deep setting level with hard and/or interconnected materials \nand high spurs were found to be far more expensive than other options and had low economic \nreturn  and  high  maintenance  costs.  While  low  permeable  spurs  were  identified  as  a  potential \nalternative, the piling alone showed to cost three times more than the low solid spurs and was \nconsequently dropped. The following options were taken forward for the feasibility study: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nwithout project,  \nembankment retirement (inward shifting of embankment), \nriverbank protection by revetment, \nriverbank protection by low solid spur. \n\n \n2. \nWithout  Project.  In  the  without-project  scenario,  river  erosion  will  continue.  The \nestimated  loss  of  land  by  river  erosion  over  the  last  10  years  is  1,358  hectares  (ha)  in  Pabna \nIrrigation and Rural Development Project (PIRDP) and 416 ha in Meghna-Dhonagoda Irrigation \nProject (MDIP). With the expected average erosion rate over the next 30 years, it is estimated \nthat 3,002 ha will be eroded in PIRDP and 2,242 ha in MDIP. Some of the erosion at the project \nsites  is  expected  to  cause  sediment  deposition  and  generation  of  new  land  elsewhere. \nHowever,  newly  accreted  land  is  of  low  value  and  generally  takes  up  to  20  years  before  it \nbecomes productive. \n\n3. \nIn a without-project scenario, the embankment will be breached to inundate the project \narea,  damaging  the  terrestrial  and  aquatic  environment.  Annual  floods  will  reduce  agricultural \nproduction  by  approximately  11%  in  PIRDP  and  39%  in  MDIP.  Flooding  will  also  have  a \nnegative impact on water supply, sanitation, and health. The floodplains will revert to supporting \naquatic life during the flood season, which will have a significant impact on fisheries and culture \nfish production. A considerable part of the production capacity of the pond culture will be lost, \nwhile  the  capture  fishery  can  be  reinstated.  However,  on  the  whole,  the  increase  in  fisheries \nproduction in PIRDP will be minimal.  \n\n4. \nEmbankment  Retirement.  Under  an  embankment  retirement  scenario  (as  well  as  the \nwithout-project  scenario)  continued  river  erosion  will  accelerate  the  cycle  of  environmental \ndegradation in the project area, where people displaced by erosion move to remaining marginal \nland, causing further deterioration of natural resources and reduction of terrestrial biodiversity in \nMDIP and PIRDP. \n\n5. \nIn PIRDP, over the past 15 years at least 2,500 households have lost their homestead \nlands to river erosion and been forced to move, some to the embankment. In the next 30 years, \naround 7,000 households could be lost in PIRDP as a result of erosion including the 2,425 living \noutside  the  embankment  and  others  just  on  and  behind  it.  In  MDIP,  over  the  past  15  years, \nabout  4,000  households  are  estimated  to  have  lost  their  homesteads,  of  which  about  600  are \nsquatting on and along the embankment. Another 2,900 households or so have migrated to the \nproject  area,  and  about  500  to  the  opposite  side  of  the  rivers.  In  the  next  30  years,  5,450 \nhouseholds could be lost due to bank retreat as a result of erosion.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nRiverbank  Protection  and  Comparative  Assessment.  Riverbank  protection  through \n6. \nrevetment and low spurs intends to stabilize the riverbank following an \u201cadaptive approach\u201d to \nprotect  and  stabilize  the  riverbank  along  smooth  alignments  that  are  parallel  to  the  river \nsystems.  By  using  sand-filled  graded  geotextile  bags,  it  can  be  implemented  at  about  half  the \ncost  of  conventional  hard  materials.  This  option  was  compared  to  the  without-project  and \nembankment  retirement  scenarios  using  a  multicriterion  analysis  including  economic,  social, \nand  environmental  consequences.  (See  a  summary  of  alternatives  analysis  in  Table  A5.)               \nThe  overall  analysis  shows  that  embankment  retirement  is  cheaper  than  riverbank  protection. \nHowever,  embankment  retirement  entails  significant  social  disruption  and  environmental \nimpacts  associated  with  continued  loss  of  agriculture  and  homestead  land  and  dislocation  of \n28,000 people in the next 10 years, which make this choice socially unattractive. The financial \ncost of embankment retirement for the two subprojects in the 30-year project life is estimated at \n$44.1  million  against  the  revetment  option  of  $78.9  million.  However,  the  cost  of  embankment \nretirement  does  not  include  the  lost  income  opportunities  of  those  who  lose  their  land  due  to \nriver erosion, estimated at $52.7 million valued at the present market price. \n\nEmbankment retirement is also not practical as mitigation measures are urgently needed \n7. \nin  the  project  area  to  cope  with  river  erosion,  and  in  view  of  (i)  strong  opposition  by \nstakeholders;  (ii)  lack  of  social  safety  nets  accepted  by  the  stakeholders  (who  request  full \ncompensation of lost assets) and the Government (which does not compensate loss of assets \ndue  to  the  natural  phenomenon  of  river  erosion);  and  (iii)  time-consuming  procedural \nrequirements  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  provision  of  necessary  social  safety \nnets.  Embankment  retirement  is  also  generally  used  as  a  rehabilitation  rather  than  protective \nmeasure  against  flood  damage.1  If  the  retired  embankment  is  not  constructed  before  the \nexisting embankment is undercut by erosion in PIRDP and MDIP, the economic viability of the \nembankment retirement will be significantly undermined due to substantial inundation damage, \ndeterioration  of  cropping  patterns  due  to  loss  of  confidence  among  farmers,  and  added \nrehabilitation costs.  \n\n8. \nPublic  Consultation.  Having  thoroughly  evaluated  the  alternative  from  a  multicriterion \nperspective, the Government and ADB consulted the major stakeholders, representatives of the \nconcerned central and local governments and nongovernment organizations, and national and \ninternational  experts.  A  consensus  emerged  that  embankment  retirement  should  be  avoided \ndue to its highly adverse social impacts as long as an economically feasible alternative exists.  \n\n9. \nSelected Design Option. While the two riverbank-protection options have similar costs \nand  economic  returns,  the  low-spur  option  is  viable  where  the  riverbed  is  shallow  and  deep \nscours  are  far  from  the  bank,  which  is  not  the  case  in  PIRDP.  The  low-spur  option  is  less \nadaptive and flexible than revetment and does not allow for phased construction in response to \nmorphological  developments:  all  the  spurs  should  be  constructed  at  once.  Consequently, \nriverbank  protection  option  by  revetment  was  chosen  as  the  selected  design  option  for  the \nProject.    \n\n                                                 \n1   Similar erosion-induced embankment breach occurred in 1997 in PIRDP, after which about 8 kilometers of retired \n\nembankment was constructed by the Government.  \n\n \n\n\fMULTICRITERION ANALYSIS OF OPTIONS FOR AVERAGE RATES OF EROSION \nTable A5: Options and Criteria for Average Rate of Erosion \n\nFinancial Capital Cost over 30 years ($ million)\n\nEconomic Net Present Value ($ million) \n\n-26.0 \n\nPIRDP \n\nDo \nNothing \n\nRiverbank Protection \nRevetment \n\nRetireda \nEmbankment\n\nLow Solid \nSpur \n\nMDIP \nRiverbank Protection \n\nDo \n\nNothing  Revetment \n\nLow Solid \nSpur \n\nRetireda \nEmbankment\n\n47.6 \n\n48.2 \n\n  3.7 \n   15.8% \n\n  3.0 \n   12.5% \n\n23.7 \n\n 9.3 \nb \n\n- \n\n-44.9 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n31.3 \n\n34.7 \n\n13.2 \n    31.4% \n\n10.7 \n    23.4% \n\n20.4 \n\n15.4 \nb \n\n \n\n0 \n0 \n-2 \n0 \n-1 \n0 \n0 \n-2 \n0 \n-2 \n-1 \n-1 \n-1 \n0 \n-1 \n-1 \n-1 \n\n- \n\n \n\n0 \n0 \n-3 \n0 \n-2 \n0 \n+2 \n- 2 \n0 \n- 3 \n- 3 \n- 3 \n- 3 \n- 1 \n- 3 \n- 3 \n- 2 \n\n \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n-1 \n -1 \n0 \n-1 \n+2 \n0 \n+2 \n+1 \n+2  \n+2 \n0 \n+2 \n+2 \n+1 \n\n1.18 \n\n86 \n\n- \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n-1 \n-1 \n0 \n-1 \n+2 \n0 \n+2 \n+1 \n+2 \n+2 \n0 \n+2 \n+2 \n+1 \n\n26 \n\n- \n\nEconomic \nCriteria \n\nPhysical \nEnvironment \n\nEIRR \n\nAir \nSoils \nPhysiography \nRiver Hydrology and Morphology \nSurface Water Quality \nGround Water \nAquatic Ecosystem \nTerrestrial Ecosystem \nEndangered Species \nLand Use and Settlement \nWater Supply and Sanitation \nAgricultural Productivity \nFish Culture \nNavigation \nWay of Life and Equity \nIncome and Poverty \nHealth and Education \n\nBiological \nEnvironment \n\nHuman and \nEconomic \nDevelopment \n\nQuality-of-Life \nValues \n\n \n\n \nItem \n\n \n\nResettlement \nCriteria \n\nCost of Resettlement ($ million) \nRelocation of Household (hh) \n\nMarket Price of Eroded Land ($ million)  \nExcluded from Financial Cost \n\n7,000 \n\n26.0 \n\n0.59 \n\n0.64 \n\n0.32 \n\n5.4 \n\n7,000 \n\n26.0 \n\n5,450 \n\n26.7 \n\nErosion-and Flood-Affected People(no.) \n\n540,000 \n\n430 \n\n130 \n\n35,000 \n\n210,000 \n\n15 \n\n0 = not significant  \n-1= small negative impact \n\nEIRR  =  economic  internal  rate  of  return,  hh  =  households,  MDIP  =  Meghna-Dhonagoda  Irrigation  Project,  PIRDP  =  Pabna  Irrigation  and  Rural  Development \nProject \nNote \n \na  Financial cost and EIRR of this option does not include the cost of social safety nets for those who will be displaced by river erosion. \nb  Maximum  EIRR  of  30.9%  and  72.0%  could  be  achieved  if  this  option  is  successfully  implemented  before  ongoing  erosion  process  undercuts  the  existing \nembankments.

Specifically, the NGOs must \nhave (i) demonstrated capacity to mobilize the required trained and experienced field staff, (ii) a \ncertificate of satisfactory performance in implementing of resettlement and social development \nplans, and (iii) at least 5 years experience in implementing resettlement and SDPs assisted by \nexternal funding agencies. \n \n9. \nPart  C  is  required  to  implement  the  Disaster  Preparedness  and  Management  Plan \n(DPMP), which aims to strengthen the existing systems to warn stakeholders and mobilize relief \norganizations  and  enhance  the  people\u2019s  capacity  to  prepare  for  disaster.  Specific  activities \ninclude  (i)  identification  and  strengthening  of  existing  communication  networks,  including  key \nsocial and community leaders; (ii) developing training materials and  training local government \ndisaster management committees for disaster preparedness and management; (iii) undertaking \nan \nleaders;  (iv) \nstrengthening  local  linkages  with  the  Flood  Forecasting  and  Warning  Center  (FFWC)  through \nJoint Management Committees and SMOs, and with responsible organizations to provide post \ndisaster emergency operations. \n \n\nthrough  mobilization  of  social  and  community \n\ninformation  campaign \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n45 \n\nThe NGOs to be selected for the tasks must have a minimum of 5 years of proven experience in \ndeveloping people\u2019s capacity to deal with natural disaster, successful conduct of research and \nstudy  on  family-  and  community-level  disaster  preparedness,  contract  with  multilateral  and \nbilateral aid agencies, and having liaison with FFWC and national organizations responsible for \npost disaster relief and rehabilitation operations.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nTECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE SELECTED DESIGN:  \n\nSTATUS, RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AND MITIGATION MEASURES \n\nRisks and Uncertainties \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nSituational Analysis \nA. General Approach \n\nThe Project aims to stabilize the river channel \nthrough an adaptive approach, i.e., placing \nprotection works as and where needed and \nalong the smooth alignments natural to the \nriver system. Revetment with launching aprons \nof sand-filled geo-textile bags was chosen as \nthe most appropriate design option.   \n\n \nGiven the dynamic nature of river morphology and \nlimited application history of sand-filled geotextile \ndespite its innovativeness, several risks and \nuncertainties need to be addressed in \nimplementing the Project.a \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Project will take a process-type approach \nwith pilot-cum-implementation in initial years, \nwhere design and implementation will be based \non morphological update and performance \nevaluation of implemented works, and \nassessment of the remaining technical risks and \nuncertainties and further actions to mitigate those \nrisks and uncertainties.  \n\n \n\nAn annual implementation plan will also be \nforwarded to ADB for approval.  \n\nAs to (i), significant morphological change is \nrequired before unprotected sections begin to be \nattacked. The required protection was considered \nin the economic analysis, with a sensitivity \nanalysis of earlier implementation.  \n \nAs to (ii), a large uneroded area upstream of \nPIRDP must be eroded before caving that affects \nthe protected bank line develops.  \n     \n\nAs to (i), same as PIRDP. This would also require \na major morphological change, i.e., migration of \nnorth Padma channel to the south. \n \nAs to (ii), the upstream section is stable over 30 \nyears due to erosion-resistant subsoil.  \n\n \n \n  A significant change in river morphology may \n\ncause (i) bank erosion in an unprotected bank \nline, and/or (ii) upstream bend development that \nwould attack the upper end of the protected bank \nline from the side and behind.   \n\nB. River Morphology \n(i) PIRDP \n\nThe Jamuna River has been widening, at 27 \nm/year, along the right bank around PIRDP \nover the last 30 years.  \n\nAttacked reaches have been eroded since \n1992 at a rate over 130 m/year. The lower \nreaches (not to be covered under the Project) \nwere attacked in 1973/83 with similar erosion \nrates.  \n\n(See Figure A11.1 for morphological change since \n1992.) \n(ii) MDIP  \n\n \n\nThe erosion in MDIP is caused by the Meghna, \nwhich is much calmer than the adjoining \nPadma. Scour depth is shallower (up to \u201310 m \nfrom low water level against \u201322 m in PIRDP in \ncritical reaches in 2001). \n\n(See Figure A11.2 for morphological change since \n1992)  \n\n                                                 \n\nSame as PIRDP. \n\n \n\na  While  information  collected  during  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  indicates  the  viability  of  the  proposed  solution,  this  needs  to  be  verified    through  field \n\napplication while meeting the urgent requirements for riverbank protection in the project area. \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nSituational Analysis \nC. Structural Design \n(i) Design Scour Level \n\nThe level adopted in PIRDP and MDIP is -30 m \nand -20m from the low water level, \nrespectively.  \n\nThe morphological process may develop deep \nscours that would lead to structural failure. \n\nRisks and Uncertainties \n\nMitigation Measures \n\n(ii) Launch Performance \n\nThe geotextile bags built up along the bank are \nenvisaged to start sliding down the slope when \nriver erosion undercuts it and cover the bank to \narrest the erosion.   \n\n(See Figure A11-3 for a typical cross section and \nlaunch process.) \n \n \n\nThe key uncertainty has been whether the \nstacked geotextile bags will launch properly to \ncover the eroding banks, as other materials do. \n  \nA physical model test undertaken during PPTA \nindicated the expected performance.  \n\n \n Experience in using hard materials is limited to \n25 m launch depth, whereas the site condition in \nPIRDP may require up to 30 m. Effective \ncoverage may require additional materials.  \n\nA conservative design was adopted, by taking the \nlevels from single point maximum depth observed \nin the channel with additional 5 m for \nsafety/contingency. \n  \nTo economize, the Project places materials in a \nphased manner according to the actual scour \ndepth.  \n\nLaunch performance is being further verified \nthrough performance monitoring of interim works \ncarried out by the Government in 2002. \n \nDetailed monitoring and assessments are done \nduring the initial implementation period.  \n\nPerformance in deep scours will be verified \nduring field application. \n \nSpecific contingencies were not included, given \nthe conservative design scour and its location-\nspecific nature. This could also be addressed by \nplacing materials at the slope bottom instead of \nthe launch section at the slope shoulder. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii) Underwater Slope of Eroding Banks \n\nThe design envisages the underwater slope of \n1V:2H adopted in prototype design of hard \nmaterials. \n\nThe scope varies either averaging 1V:2H. The \nflatter slope may result in a thinner layer or a \nneed to provide greater quantities. \n\nUnderwater slop will be verified during field \napplication.  \n\n(iv) Durability of Geotextile Bags \n\nGeotextile bags are envisaged to perform as \nspecified beyond the 30-year project life.  \n  \n\nThe soil in the geotextile bags must not be \nwashed away. \n The top layer of the geotextile bags may be worn \nout due to sand movement on the surface of the \nbags. \n\nSufficient quality of sand is to be ensured. \n\nThe possibility is to be verified through \ninformation collection and field monitoring. The \navailable field data in Bangladesh indicate that \nsand movement has not resulted in bag failure. \n \n\nAADB = Asian Development Bank, m = meter, MDIP = Meghna-Dhonagoda Irrigation Project, PIRDP = Pabna Irrigation and Rural Development Project, PPTA = project preparatory \n\ntechnical  assistance \n__________________ \n\n \n\n  b PPTA recommended that -25 m and -15 would be sufficient for PIRDP and MDIP, respectively. The adopted design resulted in  over 10% increase in protection cost. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nFigure A11.1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fFigure A11.2 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nFigure A11.3: Erosion Mitigation Mechanism through Geo-bag Revetment \nTypical Cross Section after Construction (PIRDP) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nc.c. block = concrete cube block, El = elevation, Kg = kilogram, LWL = low water level, mm = millimeter,  \nNos. = numbers, PWD = public works datum (standard elevation), Wt. = weight \n\nR iverbed before scour\n\nG eobags launching\n\nRiverbed before scour\n\nGeobags after launch\n\nS cour developm ent\n\nLW L + 3.70m P W D\n\nM axim um  scour \nlevel -26.30m P W D\n\nLW L +3.70mPW D\n\nLaunch depth = 30m\n\nMaximum scour leve\n-26.30mPW D\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n51 \n\nSUMMARY ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nIntroduction \n\nEconomic Costs of Project \n\n \nA. \n \nIn  the  economic  analysis,  the  economic  costs  and  benefits  of  the  proposed  erosion \n1. \nmitigation  works,  i.e.,  geotextile  bag  revetment,  were  evaluated  in  Pabna  Irrigation  and  Rural \nDevelopment Project (PIRDP) and Meghna-Dhonagoda Irrigation Project  (MDIP) for a project \nlife  of  30  years,  including  the  construction  period.  The  costs  and  benefits  were  expressed  in \nconstant 2002 prices, and valued using the world price numeraire method. All taxes and duties \nwere  excluded  in  deriving  the  economic  values.  The  financial  costs  of  traded  goods  were \nadjusted  to  their  respective  values  using  the  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9  and  a  shadow \nwage rate of 0.85 for agricultural labor and 0.84 for construction labor are used. In the case of \nmajor  tradable  commodities,  economic  values  are  based  on  border  parity  pricing.  These  price \ndata  were  obtained  from  the  recently  completed  National  Water  Management  Plan  study  with \nsome  adjustment  in  accordance  with  the  local  conditions  based  on  the  benefit  monitoring  and \nevaluation data collected under the Command Area Development Project (CADP).  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  capital  investment  and  recurrent  costs  required  for  the  Project  were  compiled  and \nthen  distributed  over  6-years  in  accordance  with  the  proposed  phasing  of  the  Project  before \nbeing valued in economic prices. Economic conversion factors were applied to the financial cost \nestimates to derive the economic costs of the various project components. The economic capital \ncosts  of  the  Project  were  estimated  at  $43.3  million.  The  economic  costs  of  the  immediate \nworks  undertaken  in  May-July  2002,  amounting  to  $2.67  million,  were  also  included  in  the \neconomic analysis as they are an integral part of the future erosion mitigation measures. Further \nbank  stabilization  works  were  also  assumed  to  be  required  during  the  life  of  the  Project  to \nensure  no  breaches  in  the  embankments  result  from  erosion.  The  works  were  estimated  at \n$11.9 million for PIRDP, and $9.7 million for MDIP.  \n  \nC. \n \nProject  benefits  were  derived  by  assessing  the  avoidance  of  economic  losses  in  the \n3. \nfuture  without-project  (FWO)  scenario,  as  a  result  of  land  erosion  and  loss  of  flood  protection \nbenefits  due  to  annual  flooding  caused  by  a  breach  in  the  embankment.  Expected  future \ncropping pattern change and culture fishery development promoted under the CADP were also \nincluded  as  the  benefit  associated  with  protection  of  flood  embankments  through  bank \nprotection  in  the  future  with-project  situation.1  Specific  benefits  and  methodology  of  estimating \nthose benefits are summarized as follows.  \n \n Economic Loss of Land due to Erosion. The rates of erosion of the riverbank at the \n4. \nPIRDP  and  MDIP  sites  have  been  estimated  from  the  morphological  trend  analysis.  The \ncategories of land under threat from erosion include (i) agricultural land (inside and outside the \nembankment), (ii) water bodies, (iii) settlement land (house plots), (iv) industry and markets, and \n(v)  public  buildings  and  infrastructure  (flood  control  drainage  and  irrigation  under  CADP  and \nthose  managed  by  Local  Government  Engineering  Department).  These  were  valued  at  net \npresent  value  (NPV)  of  production  for  agricultural  land  and  water  bodies,  and  NPV  of  rental \n\nBenefits of Riverbank Stabilization \n\n                                                 \n1  The rate of adoption of high-yielding rice varieties in the monsoon season is low in PIRDP, in association with the \nlack  of  confidence  among  farmers  in  the  stability  of  embankments  demonstrated  when  erosion  induced  an \nembankment breach in 1997. Successful bank stabilization is expected to address this constraint.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nprice for settlement land, industry and markets at 12% discount rate. The average capital costs \nwere  estimated  for  the  loss  of  the  last  category  of  land.  The  economic  costs  of  household \nrelocation were also included as avoided loss in the analysis, comprising (i) transport to a new \nlocation, (ii) development of a new homestead, and (iii) temporary crop losses. \n \n5. \nEconomic Loss due to Flooding in the Future Without-Project (FWO) Scenario. On \nthe  basis  of  the  assessment  of  morphological  trends  and  the  remaining  distance  between  the \nflood  embankments  and  bank  lines,  the  embankments  in  PIRDP  and  MDIP  were  assumed  to \nbreach  in  the  2002  and  2003  monsoon  season,  respectively,  under  FWO,  causing  damage  to \naman  crops.  On  the  basis  of  the  land  elevation  distribution  pattern,  present  cropping  pattern, \npotential  flood  levels  and  their  impacts  on  standing  crops,  and  past  inundation  records, \nembankment  breach  was  assumed  to  reduce  the  yields  of  three  varieties  of  aman  crops: \ntraditional  broadcast  by  10%,  improved  transplant  by  30%,  and  high-yielding  variety  (HYV)  by \n65% in PIRDP in its irrigation command. An embankment breach would reduce yields by 25%, \n60%, and 80% in MDIP, where most agricultural land is under more than 1.8 meters of water. A \n30% decline in transplant and HYV aman was anticipated in PIRDP areas outside the irrigation \ncommand.  In  subsequent  years,  it  is  estimated  that  the  farmers  will  immediately  adjust  the \ncropping  pattern  to  the  flood  regimes.  Accordingly,  more  moderate  annual  damage  of  5-10% \nwas estimated as aman crop damages due to annual flooding.  \n \nAbout 50% of the culture fishery ponds were estimated to lose 50% of production in the \n6. \nyear  of  the  breach;  20%  of  the  ponds  would  lose  50%  in  subsequent  years  due  to  annual \ninundation.  About  25%  of  the  settlement  and  infrastructure  area  within  PIRDP  irrigation \ncommand and MDIP would be severely damaged by floods due to their high velocity and wave \naction. The valuation of this damage was based on (i) an average of 20% of the full economic \nreplacement  cost  of  the  damaged  structure  that  corresponds  to  estimates  used  in  the  Flood \nAction  Plan  studies  in  rural  areas,  and  (ii)  actual  damage  caused  by  inundation  in  PIRDP  in \n1997  for  pourashava  areas.  An  average  of  5%  of  the  full  replacement  cost  was  assumed  for \nsubsequent  years.  Finally,  these  losses  were  offset  by  probable  annual  flood  damage  under \nfuture-with-Project case, estimated at 5% of the damage in the initial year of breach, taking into \naccount the 5% probability (once in 20 years) of such event.   \n \nLoss  of  Agricultural  Income  due  to  Cropping  Pattern  Difference  between  Future \n7. \nWithout-Project (FWO) and Future With-Project Scenarios. The cropping patterns for PIRDP \nand  MDIP  in  these  scenarios  were  derived  from  CADP  project  documents  and  estimates  by \nCADP  agricultural  staff  and  consultants  of  present  trends  and  likely  changes  in  future  crop \nareas.  The  analysis  assumed  that  cropping  patterns  would  be  improved  over  10  years;  the \nareas would then remain constant.  \n \n8. \nProject  (FWO)  and  Future  With-Project.  The  areas  of  fisheries  in  the  present  and  FWO  \nscenarios were derived in a similar manner as the agricultural area. The FWO scenario shows \nthat  capture  fisheries  areas  in  PIRDP  and  MDIP  will  expand  in  the  floodplain.  However,  this \nexpansion  is  anticipated  to  be  offset  by  a  decline  in  culture  fisheries  production  due  to  the \ndecline in fishponds caused by annual flooding and inundation. In a future with-project scenario \nthe  current  expansion  in  culture  fisheries  is  anticipated  to  continue  in  PIRDP  and  MDIP  and \nlevel off after the 10th year.  \n \n \n \n \n\nLoss  of  Fishery  Income  due  to  Land  Use  Difference  between  Future  Without-\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n53 \n\nEconomic Viability \n\nD. \n \n9. \nThe economic analysis was undertaken over 30 years time to reflect the economic life of \nthe  erosion  mitigation  works  under  satisfactory  maintenance.  The  incremental  net  benefit \nstreams  were  derived  from  the  cost-and-benefit  streams  to  calculate  the  EIRR,  which  was \nestimated at 16.7% for PIRDP and 31.4% for MDIP. Most of the benefit is the prevented flood \ndamage  and  associated  deterioration  of  cropping  patterns,  followed  by  prevented  loss  of  land \ndue  to  erosion.  In  PIRDP,  great  benefits  are  expected  as  a  result  of  the  increased  planting  of \nhigh-yielding  rice  varieties  as  farmers\u2019  confidence  in  the  stability  of  embankment,  which  was \ngreatly lessened after the 1997 breach, would be restored. The EIRR for PIRDP is lower due to \nthe longer sections of the riverbanks that have to be protected under the Project and the deeper \ndesign scour depth.2 \n \n10. \nSensitivity analysis was undertaken for PIRDP and MDIP to test the economic viability of \nthe proposed erosion mitigation works against various changes in the cost-and-benefit streams. \nIn general, the results of this sensitivity analysis (Table A12) show that the viability of the project \nis sensitive to adverse changes in the overall cost-and-benefit stream parameters, particularly a \nreduction in the benefits from avoiding flooding from a breach.  \n \n\nTable A12: Results of Sensitivity Analysis \n\nChange in Costs and Benefits \n\nPIRDP \nEIRR \n16.7% \n12.9% \n14.0% \n13.2% \n12.6% \n13.1% \n\nMDIP \nEIRR \n31.4% \n26.7% \n30.3% \n27.1% \n26.4% \n27.5% \n\nBase case \n10% decrease in overall project benefits \n20% reduction in incremental benefits from present \n10% increase in capital and recurrent costs \n20% increase in cost of erosion mitigation worksa \nProtection of unprotected bank line sections brought \nforward to 2009-2011b \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, MDIP = Meghna-Dhonagoda Irrigation Project,  \nPIRDP = Pabna Irrigation and Rural Development Project. \na  In addition to the built-in contingencies of over 23%. \nb    In  the  base  case,  the  protection  of  these  sections  is  envisaged  in  2022=2024  in  PIRDP  (for  a  total  of  3.4 \nkilometers  [km]  and  in  2012,  2017,  2022,  and  2027  in  MDIP  (4.4  km),  based  on  the  morphological  trend \nanalysis. \n\n \nThe  economic  and  sensitivity  analyses  indicate  that  an  investment  in  MDIP  is  fairly \n11. \nrobust  and  will  remain  viable  under  all  scenarios,  whereas  in  PIRDP,  investment  is  relatively \nvulnerable,  although  it  remains  viable  in  all  sensitivity  analysis  cases.  However,  PIRDP  has  a \nsignificantly higher poverty incidence than the national average, with a high poverty impact ratio \n(Appendix 13) that would justify the investment. The benefit estimate excluded the avoidance of \ninjuries,  loss  of  household  assets,  livestock  and  machinery,  as  well  as  the  indirect  benefits \ngenerated  by  increased  agricultural  production  promoted  under  CADP,  such  as  processing \nand/or trading of agricultural inputs and products, and other associated nonfarm activities, which \nwill also be lost under the FWO scenario. The EIRRs, therefore, provide conservative estimates \nof the true economic, social, and poverty reduction benefits of the Project. \n\n                                                 \n2  30 meters (m) below low water level (LWL) as against 20 meters below LWL in MDIP, in response to the deeper \n\nscour depth observed in the Jamuna River.    \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY ANALYSIS AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nA. \nSector identified as a national priority in country \npoverty analysis? \n\nYes \n\nSector identified as a national priority in country poverty \npartnership agreement? \n\nYes \n\nContribution of the sector/ subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh \nPoverty remains a serious problem, with 44.3% of the population of over 130 million living under the poverty line in \n2000.  This  poverty  line  is  measured  using  a  food  poverty  line  on  the  basis  of  a  basket  of  food  that  satisfies  the \nminimum  daily  intake  of  2,122  kilocalories  (kcal)  of  energy  per  person,  with  the  lower  \u201chardcore\u201d  poverty  line \ncorresponding to an intake of 1,805 kcal; 20.0% of the population falls under the latter hardcore poverty line.  \n\nGiven  that  over  80%  of  the  poor  live  in  rural  areas  and  engage  in  agriculture  and  related  nonfarm  activities, \nenhancing agricultural and rural development is a key to reduce poverty in the country. For the rural poor, access to \nand  control  of  water  is  of  fundamental  importance  as  it  is  the  foundation  for  many  livelihood  activities,  including \nagriculture, inland and coastal fishing, transportation, and water supply. Improving water resource management has \nbeen given high priority in the Poverty Partnership Agreement between the Government and the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). \n\nAmong the water sector challenges, riverbank erosion is one of the most critical challenges with significant poverty \nimplications. Annually, this natural phenomenon displaces an estimated 100,000 people, most of whom are extremely \npoor, and deprived of assets and move to riverine fringe land, embankments, and urban slums. The Project aims to \nestablish  cost-effective  and  sustainable  measures  and  institutions  to  manage  the  process  in  the  context  of  Pabna \nIrrigation and Rural Development Project (PIRDP) and Meghna-Dhonagoda Irrigation Project (MDIP), which could be \nreplicated nationwide to address this critical subsector challenge. \n \n \nB. \nOverall Status and Causes. Socioeconomic surveys undertaken during the project preparatory stage suggest that \nthe  incidence  of  poverty  in  PIRDP  is  52.8%  and  in  MDIP,  47.1%  (including  flood  protection  command  and  areas \nbetween the embankments and the bank lines). The causes of poverty in these areas are multidimensional. Poverty \nencompasses both income and nonincome dimensions such as education, health and nutrition, and empowerment. \nDeprivations of education, health, and nutrition are closely associated with income, but others such as voicelessness \nand insecurity are not linked in the same degree.    \n\nProposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\nIn PIRDP and MDIP, the distribution of resources such as land is highly skewed. The landless account for about 62% \nof  total  households,  and  marginal  households  for  74%.  As  these  areas  are  erosion-prone,  a  large  number  of \nhouseholds lost their homesteads, cultivable land, and other assets. Most remained in the area, adding to the number \nof poor households. The traditional social and local power structures excluded the poor from participation in  political \nand social processes. The critical issues are lack of income as well as human development such as education, health \nand nutrition, and social exclusion of the poor and women. The project area does not have any indigenous peoples. \n\nEconomic and Social Impacts. The Project will provide a range of economic and noneconomic benefits. Economic \nbenefits mainly include (i) avoided loss of lands and household assets in the riverine front, which would otherwise be \nlost to erosion; (ii) protection and enhancement of agricultural and fishery production within the flood embankments in \nparticular  and  areas  outside  and  along  the  bank  line;  and  (iii)  more  jobs  due  to  increased  economic  activities  and \nconstruction works during the Project. Noneconomic and social benefits include (i) increased security of population, \nlivestock,  and  assets;  and  (ii)  establishment  and  strengthening  of  local  institutions  that  will  take  a  socially  inclusive \nand  participatory  approach  covering  diverse  stakeholders,  including  establishment  of  an  institution  to  promote  the \nlivelihood of the erosion-displaced and most vulnerable population.  \n\nImpacts  on  Employment.  While  the  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  tend  to  be  distributed  proportionately  to  the \nlandholding size of the households, those with fewer assets will also benefit from project-related jobs. The Project is \nestimated to provide incremental agricultural jobs amounting to 460,000 labor days per annum in PIRDP and 610,000  \nin  MDIP,  or  about  Tk960  per  landless  and  Tk1,280  per  marginal  farm  household.  Labor-intensive  bank  protection \nwork will generate about 5.1 million labor days during the investment period in PIRDP, and 3.1 million during that of \nMDIP. A total of 200,000 labor days will be required for annual operation and maintenance (O&M) activities.1  \n\nDistribution of Project Benefits. As a part of the economic and financial analysis, the distribution of project benefits \namong  stakeholders  was  analyzed,  including  an  assessment  to  determine  the  extent  to  which  the  Project  directly \nbenefits  the  poor.  The  economic  analysis  showed  that  benefits  to  households  were  derived  from  land  erosion, \n\n                                                 \n1   Nonagricultural employment increased by about 1.4 million in PIRDP and 1.0 million labor days in MDIP between \n\n1996 and 2001, which may be accrued to flood protection and irrigation in the project area.    \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n55 \n\nParticipation Process \n\navoided flood damage, and increased agricultural and fishery development. During construction, laborers will benefit \nfrom jobs in labor-intensive riverbank protection works. The public sector will gain tax incomes, but will have to bear \nmost of the costs of investment. Tables A13.1 to A13.2 present the results of the distribution analysis. Overall, the \npoor may attain a total of about 45% of the direct and indirect project benefits in PIRDP, and 42% of those of MDIP  \nwhen crop and fishery production, family and hired agricultural labor, and construction labor benefits are taken into \naccount. These benefits will be lost due to erosion under the without-project scenario.   \n \n \nC. \nStakeholder analysis prepared.  Yes  \nThe  public  was  substantially  involved  in  the  project  preparatory  process.  It  was  carried  out  in  two  rounds,  the  first \nthrough focus group discussions with smaller groups of homogeneous stakeholders in the area (i) inside and outside \nthe  embankment  directly  threatened  by  riverbank  erosion,  (ii)  outside  the  embankment  not  threatened  by  bank \nerosion, and (iii) inside the embankment benefited from flood control, drainage and irrigation (FCDI) facilities. On the \nbasis  of  focused  group  discussions,  the  second  round  was  held  in  the  form  of  local  workshops  involving \nrepresentatives from the central and local governments, water management associations (WMAs), and civil society. \nThe process generally revealed that (i) river erosion protection is strongly favored against retiring the embankments; \n(ii) nonstructural measures were identified as beneficial; (iii) people\u2019s representation in WMAs and union parishad and \ninvolvement  of  NGOs  was  considered  important  in  implementing  the  riverbank  protection  works  along  with  the \nBangladesh  Water  Development  Board;  and  (iv)  local  people  are  willing  to  contribute  to  mitigating  river  erosion  by \npaying  irrigation  service  fees,  taxes  on  fish  culture,  and  tolls  on  traffic  and  on  market  places;  and  in  kind  such  as \nphysical labor, and supply of food, shelter, and materials (bamboo, sacks, etc.). \n\nParticipation Strategy/ Poverty and Social Development Strategy.  Yes \n(i)  Targeted  Interventions  to  the  Erosion-displaced  Poor.  Over  10,000  people  in  PIRDP  and  MDIP  who  were \ndisplaced by river erosion now live on the riverine fringe, particularly on the flood embankments, as illegal squatters. \nThey are mostly landless and poor, with over 70% living below the poverty line, have very limited physical assets, and \nearn  daily  wages,  or  are  self-employed.  With  the  engagement  of  experienced  NGOs,  the  Project,  under  its  social \ndevelopment subcomponent, will organize this most vulnerable population, specifically targeting female-headed and \nother low-income groups to stimulate their self-help efforts.2  \n(ii)  Enhancing Socially Inclusive Participatory Water Management. In line with the 1999 National Water Policy, \nwhich promotes participatory and comprehensive management of water, the Project will establish Joint Management \nCommittees  (JMCs)  to  play  key  roles  in  decision  making  on  water  resources  management,  including  riverbank \nerosion  management,  irrigation  and  drainage,  and  agricultural  and  fishery  development.  The  Project\u2019s  institutional \nstrengthening component will focus on developing a firm institutional basis to affiliate stakeholder institutions such as \ninvolvement  of  consultants, \nWMAs.  Their  membership  status  will  be  substantially  strengthened \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  community-based  organizers  (CBOs).  JMC  will  also \ninclude \nrepresentatives of the diverse stakeholders, including the most vulnerable groups. JMCs and subproject management \noffices (SMOs) will also form an emergency riverbank protection group (ERPG) to provide labor for emergency works \nduring the flood season. ERPG representatives will also participate in construction quality assurance, e.g., throughout \nthe JMC subcommittee for joint construction inspection. \n(iii)  Gender  Strategy  and  Actions.  The  Project  will  try  to  increase  the  participation  and  role  of  women  in  WMAs, \nand  JMCs.  With  the  help  of  consultants,  NGOs,  and  CBOs,  the  Project\u2019s  nonstructural  mitigation  and  institutional-\nstrengthening components will (i) set up a special network for women members of these stakeholder institutions, (ii) \nestablish numerical targets for enrollment of female members and engagement of female laborers for earthwork and \nother  project-related  activities,  and  (iii)  provide  special  training  for  women-only  groups  through  WMAs.  Gender-\nspecific  monitoring  indicators  will  be  identified  and  gender-relevant  information  included  and  documented  in  the \nProject\u2019s management information system to be developed with the consultants.  \n(iv)  Engagement of the Poor as Construction Labor. To place sand-filled geotextile bags in the river channel, the \nProject will require an estimated 1.4 million labor days per annum during the implementation or over 50% of the total \nagricultural jobs in the project area. To ensure the highest benefit to the poor, the local population, in particular poor \nand vulnerable, will be engaged as construction labor for the works, for which wage rates will be fixed transparently.  \n\nthrough \n\n \n \n                                                 \n2  Through  a  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  project  that  has  been  submitted  to  the  Government  of  Japan  for \napproval, they will be given further opportunities to engage in routine maintenance of water resources facilities and \nincome-generating  activities  using  those  facilities.  Information  and  resource  centers  (IRCs)  will  be  established  in \nPIRDP and MDIP to support activities such as information sharing, a community-wide campaign, training, with the \ninvolvement of community representatives to sustain the institution after project completion and with contributions \nfrom beneficiaries. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nPotential Issues \n\nD. \n \n \nSubject \nResettlement \n\nSignificant,  \nNot Significant, \nUncertain, None \nLikely to be \nInsignificant \n\nGender \nAffordability \nLabor \nIndigenous  \nPeople \nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n\nNot Significant \nNone \nNone \nNone \n\nNot Significant \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nThe resettlement plan will be prepared in \naccordance with the resettlement framework \nonce the protected bank line is identified after \nthe flood season each year.

The  resettlement  framework  includes  the  framework  for  the \n1. \nproposed 7.0 km and 4.4 km of protection work for the flood embankments along the Jamuna \nand  Meghna  rivers  in  Pabna  Irrigation  and  Rural  Development  Project  (PIRDP)  and  Meghna-\nDhonagoda  Irrigation  Project  (MDIP)  respectively,  to  protect  the  project  area  from  progressive \nriver erosion. The revetment works will be implemented over 6 years. The total amount of land \nacquired for revetment is estimated at 35 hectares (ha) in PIRDP and 22 ha in MDIP, which will \nbe eroded without project intervention. Their exact locations and impacts have to be reviewed \nand finalized during the final design stage, when the alignments for the protection works will be \ndecided based on morphological development. Project implementation is expected to start in the \nfirst quarter of 2003.  \n \nResettlement  Policy.  Resettlement  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  policy \n2. \non involuntary resettlement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and following the passage of \nthe (i) Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property (ARIP) Ordinance 1982; and (ii) East \nBengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act (1951, revised 1994).    \n \n3. \nResettlement Principles, Entitlements, and Procedures. The resettlement framework \napplies to all involuntary resettlement effects, including displacement of nontitled people, arising \nfrom  land  acquisition  or  conversion,  or  any  other  effects  that  result  from  project  works  on  the \nfloodplain,  bank  line,  and  any  other  land  affected  by  the  Project,  including  that  required  for \nembankment work and char lands lost due to the project works. Those affected will be helped to \nmaintain at least their standard of living at preproject level. All losses, including of land, crops, \ntrees, structures, business, employment, and workdays and wages, will be fully compensated, \nincluding  those  incurred  by  nontitled  people.  The  owners  of  land  acquired  for  protection  work, \nincluding  bank  line  and  eroded  land  within  the  50-meter  right-of-way  acquisition,  will  be  fully \ncompensated.  Affected  households  will  receive  (i)  an  additional  cash  grant  to  match \nreplacement value to supplement the grant provided by the deputy commissioner, and (ii) other \nresettlement  assistance  such  as  shifting  allowances  and  compensation  for  loss  of  workdays \nand/or  income  due  to  dislocation.  Female-headed  and  other  vulnerable  households  will  be \neligible for further cash assistance for relocation and house reconstruction. People involuntarily \ndisplaced,  including  nontitled  people,  will  receive  priority  assistance  under  the  Project\u2019s  social \ndevelopment subcomponent. \n \n4. \nInstitutional  Responsibilities  and  Procedures.  The  project  management  office \n(PMO), under the responsibility of the chief resettlement and environmental management officer \nfinancing,  and  supervisory \nat \nresponsibilities  for  resettlement  plan  preparation  and  implementation  to  be  carried  out  by  the \nsubproject  management  offices  (SMOs)  with  designated  resettlement  and  social  development \nofficer.  PMO  will  engage  experienced  NGO  and  consultants  to  assist  the  process.  Each  year, \nupon  identification  of  the  bank  lines  for  protection  after  the  monsoon  season,  the  following \nprocedures are to be carried out: (i) PMO will undertake impact assessment surveys based on \ntechnical designs; and (ii) depending on the significance of the impacts, PMO will prepare full or \nshort  resettlement  plans  for  the  protected  section,  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  other  social  safeguard  guidelines.  The  full  or  short  resettlement \nplans will be submitted to ADB for approval, and people affected should be fully compensated \nbefore award of the relevant civil works contracts. BWDB will ensure that resettlement budgets \n\nthe  rank  of  executive  engineer,  has  overall  planning, \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 21 \n\n59 \n\nare delivered on time to the deputy commissioner\u2019s office and the implementing nongovernment \norganization (NGO) for timely resettlement plan implementation.  \n \n5. \nDisclosure,  Consultation  and  Grievances.  Each  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared \nand  implemented  in  close  consultation  with  the  stakeholders  and  will  involve  focus  group \ndiscussions  and  meetings,  particularly  with  the  project  affected  persons.  Copies  of  draft \nresettlement plan will be distributed among NGOs and community groups prior to finalizing the \nengineering  design.  A  grievances  redress  committee  (GRC)  will  be  established  with \nrepresentatives from PMO, affected persons, women and vulnerable groups, local government, \nand  NGOs.  The  chief  resettlement  officer  will  chair  the  GRC.  Other  than  disputes  relating  to \nownership  rights  under  the  court  of  law,  GRC  will  review  grievances  involving  all  resettlement \nbenefits,  relocation,  and  other  assistance.  Any  grievances  submitted  to  the  GRC  will  be \nresolved within 2\u20133 weeks. \n \n6. \nMonitoring  and  Evaluation.  Bangladesh  Water  Development  Board  (BWDB)  will \nestablish a monthly monitoring system involving PMO, SMOs and implementing NGO staff, and \nprepare  progress  reports  on  all  aspects  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  social \ndevelopment efforts and outcomes. External monitoring will be assigned to an independent local \nexpert and agency and report to BWDB and ADB quarterly. BWDB will also report to ADB on \nland acquisition and resettlement and social development in the quarterly progress report. \n \n7. \nResettlement  Cost.  The  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  estimated  at \nTk109.7 million ($1.91 million) excluding NGO services. The Government will provide the entire \nfund for land acquisition and resettlement, and will guarantee meeting unforeseen obligations in \nexcess of the budget estimate to meet the resettlement objectives.    \n\nShort Resettlement Plan for the Secondary Embankments In PIRDP \n\n \nB. \n \n8. \nScope and Impacts. The short resettlement plan is associated with the construction of a \n1.2-kilometer  secondary  defense  line  of  embankments  to  protect  some  critical  sections  of \nembankments in PIRDP. The plan will be implemented in 2003. The construction of the second \ndefense  line  will  require  acquisition  of  an  estimated  10  hectares.  The  proposed  alignment \nlargely  consists  of  low-lying  agricultural  land.  As  a  result,  the  project  impact  is  limited  to  three \nhouseholds only (18 affected persons). An estimated 30 households will lose limited agricultural \nlands from strip acquisition.  \n \n9. \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. \n \nStakeholder  Consultation  and  Entitlements.  During  the  project  preparatory  stage,  a \n10. \nconsultation  was  held  covering  the  secondary  defense  line  area.  The  feedback  and \nobservations made at the stakeholders\u2019 meetings have been used in preparing the entitlement \nmatrix  and  project  benefits  for  affected  people.  No  nontitled  people  were  affected.  The \nentitlement matrix recognizes seven types of losses to cover all potential losses, including loss \nof access by tenants (Table A14). \n\nResettlement Policy.

The  Government  will  provide  the  entire \nfund for land acquisition and resettlement. The affected people, including those affected by land \nacquisition, will receive compensation prior to award of civil works contracts. \n \n\nPoverty reduction \nmeasures and \ndevelopment  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 October 2002) \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Tk57.85 \n", "taka (Tk) \n$0.01729 \n", "Currency Unit\nTk1.00\n$1.00\n", " \n \nThe  exchange  rate  of  the  taka  is  determined  by  the  Bank  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nBangladesh,  In  this  report,  the  rate  of  $1.00=Tk57.5  was  used.
