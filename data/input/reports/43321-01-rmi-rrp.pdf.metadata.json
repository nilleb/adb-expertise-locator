I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster for the Public Sector Program, and (ii) a proposed loan to the Republic of the \nMarshall Islands (RMI) for subprogram 1 of the Public Sector Program. The report describes \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Supporting the Public Sector Program, and if the Board \napproves the proposed program cluster and loan for subprogram 1, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n2.  The RMI economy relies heavily on government expenditure and, in turn, on the foreign \ngrants that fund more than two-thirds of government expenditure.1 Most foreign grants are \nprovided by the United States (US), mainly under the amended Compact of Free Association. \nIncreased foreign grants helped the economy grow at an average annual rate of 3.1% from \nFY2000 to FY2007. However, in FY2008, the economy contracted by 2.0% as high world food \nand  fuel  prices  raised  inflation  to  14.8%,  prompting  the  declaration  of  a  state  of  national \neconomic emergency. There was no economic growth in FY2009, and the outlook is for low \ngrowth  over  the  medium  term.2  The  subdued  outlook  reflects  a  scheduled  decline  in  US \nCompact grants and deep structural weaknesses that constrain private sector development. \n \n3.  The Compact grants are on an annual decremental schedule that will continue until \nFY2023. The governments of the RMI and US are investing in a compact trust fund (CTF) that is \nintended to generate a revenue stream to replace US Compact grants in FY2024. Contributions \nfrom the RMI government have, however, fallen short because excessive recurrent expenditure \nand poor revenue performance have prevented the generation of the required fiscal surpluses.3 \nThe value of the CTF is now substantially below target, and the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) has projected a revenue shortfall of 9% of gross domestic product (GDP) in FY2024.4 \n \n4.  The RMI must make a concerted effort to increase its contributions to the CTF. An early, \nphased adjustment can minimize the economic and social cost, notably by avoiding the need for \nsharp cuts in public expenditure and the delivery of essential services when US Compact grants \nend. The IMF recommended that fiscal adjustment begin immediately to close the looming \nrevenue  gap  and  achieve  a  fiscal  surplus  of  5.0%  of  GDP  by  FY2015.  Recommended \nadjustments include cutting the public wage bill; eliminating untargeted allowances; modernizing \nthe public sector including state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform; and launching comprehensive \ntax reform.5 \n \n5.  The government has initiated wide-ranging public sector reform and fiscal adjustment \nprepared through broad engagement with stakeholders. The Tax and Revenue Reform and \nModernization (TRAM) Commission was established in July 2008, and this was followed by the \nformation, with Asian Development Bank (ADB) support, of the Comprehensive Adjustment \n                                                 \n1  Economic Analysis (Appendix 2). \n2  Economic conditions are discussed in ADB. 2010.

Republic of the Marshall Islands, 2009 Article IV Consultation, Washington (the concluding statement of \nthe IMF mission). \n ", "2 \nProgram (CAP) Advisory Group in April 2009.6 Drawing on advice from the IMF\u2019s Pacific \nFinancial Technical Assistance Centre, the TRAM commission recommended wide-ranging tax \nreform to raise more revenue and reduce economic distortions arising from the poor design of \nthe tax system.7 The CAP Advisory Group identified ways to rationalize expenditure that could \nachieve annual fiscal savings of $4.0 million\u2013$10.5 million within 3 years.8 The proposed public \nsector reforms are critical for addressing the impediments to private-sector-led economic growth \nthat arise from the large and inefficient public sector (footnote 1). \n \n6.  The CAP Advisory Group also urged SOE reform. The reforms have commenced with \nan  emphasis  on  the  Marshalls  Energy  Company  (MEC),  the  country\u2019s  largest  SOE.  The \nimperative is to reduce the risk to the budget posed by the SOE sector by transferring certain \nSOE activities to the private sector and making SOEs more efficient.9 The MEC has developed \na comprehensive recovery plan to ensure that its electricity business becomes profitable and \nfinancially stable and meets good service standards.10 The RMI has recognized the need for \nsimilar reform initiatives in other poorly performing SOE monopolies. \n \n7.  The  program  supports  the  implementation  of  the  recommendations  of  the  TRAM \ncommission and the CAP Advisory Group. It will initiate the adjustments required to achieve \nfiscal  sustainability.11  Under  subprogram  1,  policy  actions  have  been  designed  and  the \nimplementation  of  immediate  reform  priorities  has  commenced.  Subprogram  2  will  largely \ncomplete the implementation of the policy actions. The five policy action areas are common to \nboth subprograms and will progress concurrently under each. \n \n8.  The program is aligned with the RMI Country Operations Business Plan, 2010\u20132012 and \nADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2010\u20132014.12 The program also applies lessons from earlier ADB \npolicy  programs  in  the  RMI  and  elsewhere  in  the  Pacific,  as  well  as  ADB's  approach  to \nengaging with weakly performing countries, notably by (i) adopting a country-led set of policy \nactions developed in an open, participatory manner and at a pace in keeping with country \npractices and (ii) initiating long-term policy dialogue and providing targeted TA support.13 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be a more efficient and effective public sector. The outcome will be the \nachievement of fiscal sustainability. The program will be structured in two sequential subprograms. \n                                                 \n6  Fiscal Reforms and Impacts (Appendix 2). Support provided under ADB. 2009.

Under subprogram 1, the cabinet \nendorsed budget targets for FY2011 and FY2012 that will bring budget outcomes in line with \nIMF  recommendations.14  The  key  target  is  a  budget  surplus  large  enough  to  fund  RMI \ncontributions to the CTF that average 1.5% of GDP per annum (approximately $2.5 million) in \nFY2011 and FY2012.15 Complementary targets were set for the budget items, including civil \nservant wages and salaries, grants and transfers, capital expenditure, and tax revenue (Table 1). \nThe  cabinet  also  endorsed  debt  management  guidelines  for  the  government  and  SOEs. \nSubprogram 2 provides for the achievement of budget targets over FY2011 and FY2012 and an \nupdate of the targets for FY2013. The updates will include a target contribution to the CTF in \nFY2013 of at least 3.0% of GDP (approximately $5.2 million). The adoption of a public sector \ndebt  management  strategy  and  fiscal  responsibility  legislation  is  also  provided  for  under \nsubprogram 2 as measures to continue fiscal adjustment.  \n \nTable 1: Subprogram 1 Budget Framework (% of GDP) \nEstimates     Projectionsa \nItem   FY2009  FY2010     FY2011  FY2012 \nRevenue and Grants  67.9  66.1    65.0  63.9 \n  Revenue  24.0  24.5    24.6  25.0 \n     Tax revenue  15.2  16.2    16.3  16.7 \n     Nontax revenue  8.8  8.3    8.3  8.3 \n  Grants  43.9  41.6    40.4  38.9 \nTotal Expenditure  68.1  64.9    62.7  60.6 \n  Recurrent expenditure  54.4  51.2    49.0  46.9 \n    Wages and salaries  22.5  22.3    21.7  21.0 \n    Goods and services  22.9  18.0    17.2  16.4 \n    Interest payments  0.8  0.8    0.6  0.5 \n    Subsidies and transfers  8.2  10.1    9.5  9.0 \n  Capital expenditureb  13.7  13.7    13.7  13.7 \nOverall Balance  (0.2)  1.2    2.3  3.3 \nMemo Items:         \n  Amortization  0.8  1.2    1.4  1.3 \n   Compact trust fund deposits  0.0  0.0    1.0  2.0 \n( ) = negative, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product. \na  Projections for FY2011 and FY2012 are to be adjusted for any difference in the revised \nestimate for FY2010 from that shown. \nb  This is the target minimum capital expenditure, which is expected to be higher than \nshown if recurrent expenditure is below target or revenue is above target. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates based on data provided on 18 May 2010 from \nthe Ministry of Finance.  \n \n11.  The budget targets will be achieved through the actions of outputs 2 and 3, which will \nrestrain  recurrent  expenditure  and  increase  tax  revenue  (footnote  3).  The  government's \ncontribution to the CTF will be from its own general fund and be in addition to the contributions \nfrom the US, which are off the RMI budget. The medium-term direction underlying the program \nis an increase in the budget surplus to 5.0% of GDP by FY2015, as recommended by the IMF. \n                                                 \n14 It was endorsed in 23 June 2010 with the RMI Cabinet Minutes 082. \n15  The budget surplus is to be defined based on the IMF\u2019s Government Financial Statistics standards. ", "4 \n \n12.  Output 2: Restraint of recurrent expenditure. Under subprogram 1, the CAP Advisory \nGroup prepared an independent review of public expenditure that encompassed the findings of \nwork force audits in three major ministries: education, health, and public works. The cabinet \nendorsed the CAP Advisory Group report and the specific actions recommended by the group to \nrestrain recurrent expenditure. These actions will be implemented in the FY2011 and FY2012 \nbudgets. Subprogram 2 provides continued restraint of recurrent expenditure and extends work \nforce audits to six more ministries. \n \n13.  The CAP Advisory Group presented a range of policy options across 13 reform areas. \nThe program implements selected actions across these reform areas.16 In FY2011, funding for \n50 vacant positions in the civil service will be removed. Compensation paid to landowners for \nthe  MEC\u2019s  access  to  their  land  will  be  reduced,  and  the  government's  administrative \nexpenditures on, for example, housing leases and rental, electricity, water, communications, \nvehicles, fuel, and travel expenses will be reduced. In addition, there will be a freeze on the \ngovernment\u2019s wage and salary bill and allowances paid to members of the Nitijela (Parliament) \nand public servants. The expenditure freeze on these items will reduce the real cost of recurrent \nexpenditure over time. The reduction in recurrent costs will raise the cost efficiency of the \ngovernment, and work force audits will guide efforts to raise the productivity of the civil service. \n \n14.  Output 3: Increased tax revenue. Under subprogram 1, the independent assessment \nof the tax system by the TRAM commission has been completed. The cabinet endorsed the \ncommission's report and specific actions recommended by the commission to increase tax \nrevenue,  for  implementation  from  FY2011.  Subprogram  2  provides  for  continued  tax \nmodernization. \n \n15.  The  TRAM  commission  recommended  replacing  an  array  of  existing  taxes  with  a \nmodern  tax  regime  that  has  higher  revenue  potential.  The  proposed  new  taxes  are  a \nconsumption tax, an excise tax for certain goods (e.g., alcohol and fuel), a net profit tax for large \nbusinesses, and a modified wages and salaries tax. These new taxes would replace hotel taxes, \nimport duties, various local taxes, and gross revenue taxes (except those on small businesses). \nThe  new  taxes  are  designed  to  reduce  distortions  facing  producers  and  consumers.  The \ncommission  also  recommended  changes  to  the  income  tax  (e.g.,  removing  generous \nexemptions and adopting a tax-free threshold) to reduce regressive aspects of it and improve \ntax administration (e.g., unifying tax administration, improving tax audits, and harmonizing tax \ncollection processes). \n \n16.  The  initial  priority  under  the  program  is  to  raise  compliance  through  improved \nadministration. These actions are expected to generate most of the additional tax revenue \ntargeted under the program. The new taxes are to be implemented in a revenue-neutral manner \nfor existing taxpayers. The medium-term target is to lift the ratio of taxes to GDP to 16.2% from \n15.2% in FY2009, as recommended by the IMF. \n \n17.  Output 4: Improved performance of SOEs. Under subprogram 1, an assessment was \nconducted of the performance of the 11 major SOEs, and the cabinet endorsed good practice \nprinciples to guide the ongoing SOE reform. A comprehensive recovery plan was prepared for \nthe MEC and endorsed by the MEC board, and implementation commenced. The cabinet and \nthe MEC board endorsed debt restructuring for the MEC, and the MEC board endorsed the \nestablishment of a maintenance account to hold funds set aside for maintenance. Subprogram 2 \n                                                 \n16  Fiscal Reforms and Impacts (Appendix 2). ", "    5 \nprovides for annual public reporting on SOE performance, the adoption of an SOE policy, the \nimplementation  of  an  SOE  act,  the  continued  implementation  of  the  MEC  comprehensive \nrecovery plan, and the implementation of MEC's debt restructuring and maintenance account. \nTime-bound recovery plans are to be prepared under subprogram 2 for other SOEs at risk \nthrough the application of the good practice principles. \n \n18.  The SOE assessment examined the financial performance, constraints, and options for \nreform of the major SOEs.17 The analysis highlighted risk from the SOE sector to the budget, \nnoting the need for subsidies and, from time to time, urgent cash injections to ensure solvency.  \nThis assessment will be regularly updated during the program, including through participation in \nthe update of ADB's Finding Balance reports in 2010 and 2011.18 A more solid performance \nassessment  system  will  be  established  through  the  SOE  policy  and  SOE  act  that  will  be \ndeveloped from the good practice principles. The good practice principles build on lessons from \nSOE reform in the Pacific and elsewhere. Notably, they emphasize the importance of a sound \ncorporate  governance  framework,  including  ensuring  clarity  in  strategic  direction  and  the \nindependence of SOE boards. The principles will underpin the development of an SOE policy \nand the preparation of an SOE act.  \n \n19.  The  MEC  comprehensive  recovery  plan  includes  actions  to  (i)  improve  corporate \ngovernance through the reconstitution of the board, (ii) improve procurement and financial \nmanagement, (iii) align tariffs to reflect costs, (iv) reduce system losses, (v) improve billings \nthrough prepaid metering and better collection, (vi) raise the efficiency of fuel usage, (vii) reduce \nnonessential expenditure, and (viii) overhaul the main generators and other major equipment \n(footnote 10). \n \n20.  MEC's debt restructuring has three elements: (i) replacing a sovereign-guaranteed loan \nfrom the Bank of Guam with a concessional loan from the government, (ii) deferring principal \nrepayments  on  an  existing  loan  from  the  Rural  Utility  Services  of  the  US  Department  of \nAgriculture, and (iii) establishing a debt-servicing sinking fund. Counterpart funds generated by \nthe proceeds of the proposed program loan will be onlent to the MEC, with most funds to be \nused to repay the Bank of Guam loan. Onlending will be at the actual concessional cost of funds \nand done under a subsidiary loan agreement with the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The interest \nand cash flow savings will be used to strengthen the financial position of the MEC and finance \npriority actions of the MEC comprehensive recovery plan. The subsidy implicit in the provision of \nthe concessional loan will be recognized as part of the funding of community service obligations \nprovided by the MEC. The debt servicing sinking fund will be controlled by MOF and accumulate \nfunds set aside by the MEC to service its new loan from the government.  \n \n21.  Output 5: Stakeholder participation and consultation supported. Public consultation \nwas initiated under subprogram 1 to support the development of a country-led and broadly \nsupported  set  of  policy  actions.  This  provided  for  consultation  involving  the  public  sector, \ndevelopment partners, the private sector, civil society, academia, and women's organizations. \nPublic  consultation  will  continue  throughout  the  program.  Notably,  the  stakeholder  forum \nestablished under subprogram 1 will reflect public views and inputs to the program.  \n \n                                                 \n17  State-Owned Enterprise Analysis (Appendix 2); B.

The government has requested financial assistance in the form of a program cluster \ncomprising  two  loans  amounting  to  $14.5  million  equivalent,  $9.5  million  equivalent  for \nsubprogram 1 and $5.0 million equivalent for subprogram 2. ADB will provide a loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to $9.5 million for subprogram 1 from its Special Funds resources. The \nloan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The remaining costs of the program will be met \nby the government. \n \n23.  The government shall ensure that the counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of \nthe loan will be onlent to the MEC to enable the repayment of its sovereign-guaranteed loan of \n$8.4 million from the Bank of Guam and the implementation of other reforms in the MEC \ncomprehensive  recovery  plan.  The  MEC\u2019s  cash  flow  will  be  improved,  enabling  the \nrefurbishment of its generators. This will help ensure continuity of supply and, combined with \nother reforms, ensure the financial integrity of the MEC (footnote 10). \n \n24.  Loan size has been determined after due consideration of (i) the adjustment costs to be \nincurred by the MEC in refurbishing its major assets and achieving a sound financial position, (ii) \nthe significance of the policy actions, and (iii) the program's alignment with the RMI country \noperations business plan, 2010\u20132012.19 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n25.  The program will be provided as a cluster comprising two subprograms. A single tranche \nloan of $9.5 million equivalent will be disbursed under subprogram 1 when the government has \nmet the conditions for effectiveness. The duration of subprogram 1 is from 1 April 2009 to 31 \nAugust 2010. Subprogram 2 will be presented for consideration and approval by ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors depending on the progress achieved in implementing subprogram 1. Subprogram 2 is \nexpected to be considered by the Board 18 months after the loan for subprogram 1 becomes \neffective.   \n \n26.  MOF, as the executing agency, shall be responsible for (i) overseeing all policy, legal, \nand regulatory actions to be undertaken in connection with the program and (ii) ensuring that all \npolicy reforms set out in the policy letter and policy matrix are duly carried out in a timely \nmanner (Appendixes 3 and 4). MOF shall also be responsible for implementing the program \ncluster  and  the  program,  including  reporting  to  ADB,  administering  and  disbursing  loan \nproceeds, and maintaining program records and accounts.  \n \n27.  The government and ADB have agreed on a range of outcomes and output indicators to \nmonitor program implementation and evaluate its impact (Appendix 1). MOF will (i) establish a \nperformance evaluation system for the program within 4 months of loan effectiveness, which will \nbe derived from the design and monitoring framework, policy letter, and policy matrix, and (ii) \nmonitor and report to ADB every 6 months during the program on the implementation of policy \nactions and their impact on budget outcomes and SOE performance (including financial and \nperformance indicators), in line with the program impact and outcome indicators agreed with the \ngovernment.  \n \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2010.

ADB, in collaboration with MOF and other multilateral and bilateral agencies, will assess \nthe  program  performance  6 months  after  loan  effectiveness  to  review  the  outcome  of \nsubprogram 1 and initiate the preparation of subprogram 2.20 This review will (i) evaluate the \nimplementation  of  the  policy  reform  measures  under  subprogram  1,  (ii)  assess  impact, \n(iii) identify lessons learned, and (iv) outline reforms and assistance needed for sustained fiscal \nconsolidation to enable the processing of subprogram 2. \n \n29.  The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed to the RMI as the borrower according to \nADB\u2019s Simplified Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.21 \nThe proceeds will finance items produced and procured in ADB member countries and exclude \nitems on the list of ineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral \nsources.22 Supporting import documentation will not be required if, during each year that loan \nproceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  RMI  imports  minus  imports  from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance is greater than the amount expected to be disbursed during that year. Otherwise, \nimport documentation under existing procedures will be required. Before the first withdrawal, the \ngovernment will open or nominate a deposit account at a designated bank to receive the loan \nproceeds.  \n \n30.  Implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 2.  \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  From 1 April 2009 to 31 August 2013  \nEstimated program completion date  31 August 2013 \nProgram management   \n(i)   Oversight body  Program steering committee: Ministry of Finance, Ministry \nof Public Works, Ministry of Resources and Development, \nand the Chief Secretary's Office \n(ii)  Executing and implementing agency  Ministry of Finance \nDisbursement  The $14.5 million equivalent program cluster will be \ndisbursed as two single tranche loans: $9.5 million \nequivalent for subprogram 1 and $5.0 million equivalent \nfor subprogram 2. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n31.  It  is  proposed  that  TA  be  approved  together  with  the  program  to  support  its \nimplementation. The impact and outcome of the TA are the same as those of the program. The \nTA is estimated to cost $700,000 equivalent, of which $600,000 equivalent will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV).  The  government  will \nfinance $100,000 equivalent in kind. MOF will be the executing agency in conjunction with the \n                                                 \n20  The development partners will hold a development partner coordination meeting in 2010 that will establish a \ncommon mechanism to provide ongoing support for the harmonized implementation of the program.  \n21 ADB. 1998.

The  TA  will  be  implemented  together  with  the \nprogram from mid-2010 to 31 August 2013.23  \n \n32.  The TA will be complemented by two proposed Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \n(JFPR) grant projects to be administered by ADB,  which will cover social safety nets, prepaid \nmetering, refurbishment of generation equipment, and grid extension.24 The proposed JFPR-\nfunded project in the energy sector will support the MEC's reform initiatives to improve demand-\nside and supply-side efficiencies. Residents in Majuro will benefit from better access to reliable \npower and improved capacity provided by prepaid metering to reduce their power expenditure.25  \n \n33.  The TA for Pacific Economic Management supports economic monitoring, analysis, and \npolicy advice in Pacific developing member countries, including the RMI.26 The TA focus is on \nmacroeconomic management with an emphasis on fiscal and structural policy. The scope of \nassistance extends to revitalizing economic management systems, including support for the \nincreased participation of stakeholders in economic management and policy. \n \n34.  The Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative supports Pacific developing member \ncountries\u2019 coordination of private sector reforms, including through SOE reforms and assistance \nin developing capacity to implement public\u2013private partnerships; reforms to the legal enabling \nenvironment for business, including the reform of company, insolvency, and trustee law; and \nimproving access to financial services.27  \n \n35.  Together with ADB, other development partners are providing substantial support to \npublic sector reform in the RMI. With the proposed JFPR project on Improved Energy Supply for \nPoor Households, the US and ADB agree to work closely on installing prepaid meters through \nparallel implementation. The IMF\u2019s Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre will play a lead \nrole in assisting the government\u2019s revenue reform. The Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment  will  work  closely  with  ADB  to  support  public  sector  reform  in  the  RMI.  The \nEuropean Union, Japan, and Taipei,China agreed to adopt a common approach with ADB and \nare exploring an opportunity for a formal partnership agreement. The World Bank will continue \nto provide technical support to improve the MEC's financial and technical management. In the \nspirit of development partner harmonization, all have agreed to form a joint program steering \ncommittee to support the RMI reform effort. ADB assistance will be provided in a manner that is \nharmonized and consistent with that of other partners.28 \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial  \n36.  The primary gain from the program in the short to medium term will be the improved \nbudgetary situation of the RMI, including the stabilization of the financial position of SOEs at risk. \nThis  will  provide  a  foundation  for  better  service  delivery  over  the  long  term  and,  in  turn, \n                                                 \n23 Technical Assistance (Appendix 2). \n24 Two JFPR proposals, (i) RMI: Improved Energy Supply for Poor Households and (ii) Regional: Social Protection of \nthe Vulnerable in the Pacific, were endorsed by the Government of Japan in May and June 2010, respectively. \nADB Board approval on a no-objection basis will be sought in August 2010. \n25  Grid connection and solar power options were considered, with grid connection assessed to be the least-cost \noption.  \n26 ADB. 2009.

Debt restructuring will reduce \nthe net present value of public debt and lower the RMI\u2019s overall debt burden.29 \n \nB.  Governance \n37.  The  program  will  improve  corporate  governance  in  targeted  SOEs  through  the \napplication of good practice principles. Governance standards will be enhanced by an open and \ntransparent approach to the implementation of CAP Advisory Group and TRAM commission \nrecommendations, combined with policy action that enhances stakeholder participation. \n \n38.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MOF.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the draft loan agreement. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social  \n39.  Over  time,  the  program  will  yield  broadly  distributed  social  benefits  by  providing  a \nfoundation for improving the fiscal position of the RMI. This will enhance the sustainable delivery \nof essential services and support for vulnerable members of the community. The Government of \nJapan has recently approved a new JFPR proposal to establish a social safety net in the RMI. \nSubject to ADB approval,30 the project will complement the program by providing additional \nsupport.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n40.  The  program  is  classified  under  safeguard  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n41.  The major risk is the sustainability of commitment to reform. However, this risk has been \nmitigated by carefully sequencing reforms, emphasizing wide community participation in the \nformulation of the program, and closely coordinating with development partners, including the \ninstigation of a mechanism for development partner coordination. The benefits are expected to \noutweigh the costs and risks. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3.31  \n \nTable 3: Summary of Key Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nThe government's capacity to effectively  Technical assistance will be provided to the Ministry of Finance, \nimplement reforms may prove insufficient.

The net present value of the debt is estimated at 35.1% of GDP.   \n30 The Government of Japan approved the proposal on 10 June 2010.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n42.  The government and MOF have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement. \n \n43.  The loan will become effective only after the government has satisfactorily fulfilled all \nconditions for the release of the single tranche of subprogram 1.
