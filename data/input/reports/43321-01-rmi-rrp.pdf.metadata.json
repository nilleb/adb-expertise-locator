The  report  describes \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Supporting the Public Sector Program, and if the Board \napproves the proposed program cluster and loan for subprogram 1, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n2. \nThe RMI economy relies heavily on government expenditure and, in turn, on the foreign \ngrants  that  fund  more  than  two-thirds  of  government  expenditure. 1   Most  foreign  grants  are \nprovided by the United  States (US), mainly under the amended Compact of Free Association. \nIncreased  foreign  grants  helped  the  economy  grow  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  3.1%  from \nFY2000 to FY2007. However, in FY2008, the economy contracted by 2.0% as high world food \nand  fuel  prices  raised  inflation  to  14.8%,  prompting  the  declaration  of  a  state  of  national \neconomic  emergency.  There  was  no  economic  growth  in  FY2009,  and  the  outlook  is  for  low \ngrowth  over  the  medium  term. 2   The  subdued  outlook  reflects  a  scheduled  decline  in  US \nCompact grants and deep structural weaknesses that constrain private sector development. \n \n3. \nThe  Compact  grants  are  on  an  annual  decremental  schedule  that  will  continue  until \nFY2023. The governments of the RMI and US are investing in a compact trust fund (CTF) that is \nintended to generate a revenue stream to replace US Compact grants in FY2024. Contributions \nfrom the RMI government have, however, fallen short because excessive recurrent expenditure \nand poor revenue performance have prevented the generation of the required fiscal surpluses.3 \nThe  value  of  the  CTF  is  now  substantially  below  target,  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund \n(IMF) has projected a revenue shortfall of 9% of gross domestic product (GDP) in FY2024.4 \n \n4. \nThe RMI must make a concerted effort to increase its contributions to the CTF. An early, \nphased adjustment can minimize the economic and social cost, notably by avoiding the need for \nsharp cuts in public expenditure and the delivery of essential services when US Compact grants \nend.  The  IMF  recommended  that  fiscal  adjustment  begin  immediately  to  close  the  looming \nrevenue  gap  and  achieve  a  fiscal  surplus  of  5.0%  of  GDP  by  FY2015.  Recommended \nadjustments include cutting the public wage bill; eliminating untargeted allowances; modernizing \nthe public sector including state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform; and launching comprehensive \ntax reform.5 \n \n\nThe  government  has  initiated  wide-ranging  public  sector  reform  and  fiscal  adjustment \n5. \nprepared  through  broad  engagement  with  stakeholders.  The  Tax  and  Revenue  Reform  and \nModernization (TRAM) Commission was established in July 2008, and this was followed by the \nformation,  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support,  of  the  Comprehensive  Adjustment \n\n                                                 \n1   Economic Analysis (Appendix 2). \n2   Economic  conditions  are  discussed  in  ADB.  2010.

Republic of the Marshall Islands, 2009 Article IV Consultation, Washington (the concluding statement of \n\nthe IMF mission). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nProgram  (CAP)  Advisory  Group  in  April  2009. 6   Drawing  on  advice  from  the  IMF\u2019s  Pacific \nFinancial Technical Assistance Centre, the TRAM commission recommended wide-ranging tax \nreform to raise more revenue and reduce economic distortions arising from the poor design of \nthe tax system.7 The CAP Advisory Group identified ways to rationalize expenditure that could \nachieve annual fiscal savings of $4.0 million\u2013$10.5 million within 3 years.8 The proposed public \nsector reforms are critical for addressing the impediments to private-sector-led economic growth \nthat arise from the large and inefficient public sector (footnote 1). \n \nThe  CAP  Advisory  Group  also  urged  SOE  reform.  The  reforms  have  commenced  with \n6. \nan  emphasis  on  the  Marshalls  Energy  Company  (MEC),  the  country\u2019s  largest  SOE.  The \nimperative is to reduce the risk to the budget posed by the SOE sector by transferring certain \nSOE activities to the private sector and making SOEs more efficient.9 The MEC has developed \na  comprehensive  recovery  plan  to  ensure  that  its  electricity  business  becomes  profitable  and \nfinancially  stable  and  meets  good  service  standards.10  The  RMI  has  recognized  the  need  for \nsimilar reform initiatives in other poorly performing SOE monopolies. \n \nThe  program  supports  the  implementation  of  the  recommendations  of  the  TRAM \n7. \ncommission  and  the  CAP  Advisory  Group.  It  will  initiate  the  adjustments  required  to  achieve \nfiscal  sustainability. 11   Under  subprogram  1,  policy  actions  have  been  designed  and  the \nimplementation  of  immediate  reform  priorities  has  commenced.  Subprogram  2  will  largely \ncomplete the implementation of the policy actions. The five policy action areas are common to \nboth subprograms and will progress concurrently under each. \n\n \n\n8. \nThe program is aligned with the RMI Country Operations Business Plan, 2010\u20132012 and \nADB\u2019s  Pacific  Approach,  2010\u20132014. 12  The  program  also  applies  lessons  from  earlier  ADB \npolicy  programs  in  the  RMI  and  elsewhere  in  the  Pacific,  as  well  as  ADB's  approach  to \nengaging  with  weakly  performing  countries,  notably  by  (i)  adopting  a  country-led  set  of  policy \nactions  developed  in  an  open,  participatory  manner  and  at  a  pace  in  keeping  with  country \npractices and (ii) initiating long-term policy dialogue and providing targeted TA support.13 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  will  be  a  more  efficient  and  effective  public  sector.  The  outcome  will  be  the \n9. \nachievement of fiscal sustainability. The program will be structured in two sequential subprograms. \n\n                                                 \n6  Fiscal  Reforms  and  Impacts  (Appendix  2).

Government subsidies to SOEs amount to 5% of GDP each year. \nIn  addition,  cash  advances  have  at  times  been  required  to  ensure  solvency.

Under  subprogram  1,  the  cabinet \nendorsed  budget  targets  for  FY2011  and  FY2012  that  will  bring  budget  outcomes  in  line  with \nIMF  recommendations. 14   The  key  target  is  a  budget  surplus  large  enough  to  fund  RMI \ncontributions to the CTF that average 1.5% of GDP per annum (approximately $2.5 million) in \nFY2011  and  FY2012.15  Complementary  targets  were  set  for  the  budget  items,  including  civil \nservant wages and salaries, grants and transfers, capital expenditure, and tax revenue (Table 1). \nThe  cabinet  also  endorsed  debt  management  guidelines  for  the  government  and  SOEs. \nSubprogram 2 provides for the achievement of budget targets over FY2011 and FY2012 and an \nupdate  of  the  targets  for  FY2013.  The  updates  will  include  a  target  contribution  to  the  CTF  in \nFY2013  of  at  least  3.0%  of  GDP  (approximately  $5.2  million).  The  adoption  of  a  public  sector \ndebt  management  strategy  and  fiscal  responsibility  legislation  is  also  provided  for  under \nsubprogram 2 as measures to continue fiscal adjustment.  \n \n\nTable 1: Subprogram 1 Budget Framework (% of GDP) \n\nItem  \n\nRevenue \n \nTax revenue \n  Nontax revenue \nGrants \n\nRevenue and Grants \n \n  \n  \n \nTotal Expenditure \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOverall Balance \nMemo Items: \n \n  \n\nRecurrent expenditure \n  Wages and salaries \n  Goods and services \nInterest payments \n \n \nSubsidies and transfers \nCapital expenditureb \n\nEstimates \nFY2009  FY2010 \n\n  \n  \n\nProjectionsa \n\nFY2011 \n\nFY2012 \n\n67.9 \n24.0 \n15.2 \n8.8 \n43.9 \n68.1 \n54.4 \n22.5 \n22.9 \n0.8 \n8.2 \n13.7 \n(0.2) \n  \n0.8 \n0.0 \n\n66.1 \n24.5 \n16.2 \n8.3 \n41.6 \n64.9 \n51.2 \n22.3 \n18.0 \n0.8 \n10.1 \n13.7 \n1.2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n65.0 \n24.6 \n16.3 \n8.3 \n40.4 \n62.7 \n49.0 \n21.7 \n17.2 \n0.6 \n9.5 \n13.7 \n2.3 \n  \n1.4 \n1.0 \n\n63.9 \n25.0 \n16.7 \n8.3 \n38.9 \n60.6 \n46.9 \n21.0 \n16.4 \n0.5 \n9.0 \n13.7 \n3.3 \n\nAmortization \nCompact trust fund deposits \n\n1.2 \n0.0 \n( ) = negative, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product. \na   Projections for FY2011 and FY2012 are to be adjusted for any difference in the revised \n\n1.3 \n2.0 \n\nestimate for FY2010 from that shown. \n\nb  This  is  the  target  minimum  capital  expenditure,  which  is  expected  to  be  higher  than \n\nshown if recurrent expenditure is below target or revenue is above target. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates based on data provided on 18 May 2010 from \nthe Ministry of Finance.  \n\n \n11. \nThe  budget  targets  will  be  achieved  through  the  actions  of  outputs  2  and  3,  which  will \nrestrain  recurrent  expenditure  and  increase  tax  revenue  (footnote  3).  The  government's \ncontribution to the CTF will be from its own general fund and be in addition to the contributions \nfrom the US, which are off the RMI budget. The medium-term direction underlying the program \nis an increase in the budget surplus to 5.0% of GDP by FY2015, as recommended by the IMF. \n\n                                                 \n14 It was endorsed in 23 June 2010 with the RMI Cabinet Minutes 082. \n15  The budget surplus is to be defined based on the IMF\u2019s Government Financial Statistics standards. \n\n\f4 \n\n \n12. \nOutput 2: Restraint of recurrent expenditure. Under subprogram 1, the CAP Advisory \nGroup prepared an independent review of public expenditure that encompassed the findings of \nwork  force  audits  in  three  major  ministries:  education,  health,  and  public  works.  The  cabinet \nendorsed the CAP Advisory Group report and the specific actions recommended by the group to \nrestrain  recurrent  expenditure.  These  actions  will  be  implemented  in  the  FY2011  and  FY2012 \nbudgets. Subprogram 2 provides continued restraint of recurrent expenditure and extends work \nforce audits to six more ministries. \n \n13. \nThe  CAP  Advisory  Group  presented  a  range  of  policy  options  across 13  reform  areas. \nThe program implements selected actions across these reform areas. 16 In FY2011, funding for \n50  vacant  positions  in  the  civil  service  will  be  removed.  Compensation  paid  to  landowners  for \nthe  MEC\u2019s  access  to  their  land  will  be  reduced,  and  the  government's  administrative \nexpenditures  on,  for  example,  housing  leases  and  rental,  electricity,  water,  communications, \nvehicles,  fuel,  and  travel  expenses  will  be  reduced.  In  addition,  there  will  be  a  freeze  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s wage and salary bill and allowances paid to members of the Nitijela (Parliament) \nand public servants. The expenditure freeze on these items will reduce the real cost of recurrent \nexpenditure  over  time.  The  reduction  in  recurrent  costs  will  raise  the  cost  efficiency  of  the \ngovernment, and work force audits will guide efforts to raise the productivity of the civil service. \n\n \nOutput  3:  Increased  tax  revenue. Under subprogram 1, the independent assessment \n14. \nof  the  tax  system  by  the  TRAM  commission  has  been  completed.  The  cabinet  endorsed  the \ncommission's  report  and  specific  actions  recommended  by  the  commission  to  increase  tax \nrevenue,  for  implementation  from  FY2011.  Subprogram  2  provides  for  continued  tax \nmodernization. \n \n15. \nThe  TRAM  commission  recommended  replacing  an  array  of  existing  taxes  with  a \nmodern  tax  regime  that  has  higher  revenue  potential.  The  proposed  new  taxes  are  a \nconsumption tax, an excise tax for certain goods (e.g., alcohol and fuel), a net profit tax for large \nbusinesses, and a modified wages and salaries tax. These new taxes would replace hotel taxes, \nimport duties, various local taxes, and gross revenue taxes (except those on small businesses). \nThe  new  taxes  are  designed  to  reduce  distortions  facing  producers  and  consumers.  The \ncommission  also  recommended  changes  to  the  income  tax  (e.g.,  removing  generous \nexemptions  and  adopting  a  tax-free  threshold)  to  reduce  regressive  aspects  of  it  and  improve \ntax  administration  (e.g.,  unifying  tax  administration,  improving  tax  audits,  and  harmonizing  tax \ncollection processes). \n \n16. \nThe  initial  priority  under  the  program  is  to  raise  compliance  through  improved \nadministration.  These  actions  are  expected  to  generate  most  of  the  additional  tax  revenue \ntargeted under the program. The new taxes are to be implemented in a revenue-neutral manner \nfor existing taxpayers. The medium-term target is to lift the ratio of taxes to GDP to 16.2% from \n15.2% in FY2009, as recommended by the IMF. \n\n \n17. \nOutput 4: Improved performance of SOEs. Under subprogram 1, an assessment was \nconducted of the performance of the 11 major SOEs, and the cabinet endorsed good practice \nprinciples to guide the ongoing SOE reform. A comprehensive recovery plan was prepared for \nthe MEC and endorsed by the MEC board, and implementation commenced. The cabinet and \nthe  MEC  board  endorsed  debt  restructuring  for  the  MEC,  and  the  MEC  board  endorsed  the \nestablishment of a maintenance account to hold funds set aside for maintenance. Subprogram 2 \n\n                                                 \n16  Fiscal Reforms and Impacts (Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n  5 \n\nprovides  for  annual  public  reporting  on  SOE  performance,  the  adoption  of  an  SOE  policy,  the \nimplementation  of  an  SOE  act,  the  continued  implementation  of  the  MEC  comprehensive \nrecovery  plan,  and  the  implementation  of  MEC's  debt  restructuring  and  maintenance  account. \nTime-bound  recovery  plans  are  to  be  prepared  under  subprogram  2  for  other  SOEs  at  risk \nthrough the application of the good practice principles. \n \n18. \nThe SOE assessment examined the financial performance, constraints, and options for \nreform  of  the  major  SOEs.17  The  analysis  highlighted  risk  from  the  SOE  sector  to the  budget, \nnoting the need for subsidies and, from time to time, urgent cash injections to ensure solvency.  \nThis assessment will be regularly updated during the program, including through participation in \nthe  update  of  ADB's  Finding  Balance  reports  in  2010  and  2011.18  A  more  solid  performance \nassessment  system  will  be  established  through  the  SOE  policy  and  SOE  act  that  will  be \ndeveloped from the good practice principles. The good practice principles build on lessons from \nSOE reform in the Pacific and elsewhere. Notably, they emphasize the importance of a sound \ncorporate  governance  framework,  including  ensuring  clarity  in  strategic  direction  and  the \nindependence  of  SOE  boards.  The  principles  will  underpin  the  development  of  an  SOE  policy \nand the preparation of an SOE act.  \n \n19. \nThe  MEC  comprehensive  recovery  plan  includes  actions  to  (i)  improve  corporate \ngovernance  through  the  reconstitution  of  the  board,  (ii)  improve  procurement  and  financial \nmanagement,  (iii)  align  tariffs  to  reflect  costs,  (iv)  reduce  system  losses,  (v)  improve  billings \nthrough prepaid metering and better collection, (vi) raise the efficiency of fuel usage, (vii) reduce \nnonessential  expenditure,  and  (viii)  overhaul  the  main  generators  and  other  major  equipment \n(footnote 10). \n \n20.  MEC's debt restructuring has three elements: (i) replacing a sovereign-guaranteed loan \nfrom  the  Bank  of  Guam  with  a  concessional  loan  from  the  government,  (ii)  deferring  principal \nrepayments  on  an  existing  loan  from  the  Rural  Utility  Services  of  the  US  Department  of \nAgriculture, and (iii) establishing a debt-servicing sinking fund. Counterpart funds generated by \nthe  proceeds  of  the  proposed  program  loan  will  be  onlent  to  the  MEC,  with  most  funds  to  be \nused to repay the Bank of Guam loan. Onlending will be at the actual concessional cost of funds \nand done under a subsidiary loan agreement with the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The interest \nand cash flow savings will be used to strengthen the financial position of the MEC and finance \npriority actions of the MEC comprehensive recovery plan. The subsidy implicit in the provision of \nthe concessional loan will be recognized as part of the funding of community service obligations \nprovided by the MEC. The debt servicing sinking fund will be controlled by MOF and accumulate \nfunds set aside by the MEC to service its new loan from the government.  \n\n \n21. \nOutput 5: Stakeholder participation and consultation supported. Public consultation \nwas  initiated  under  subprogram  1  to  support  the  development  of  a  country-led  and  broadly \nsupported  set  of  policy  actions.  This  provided  for  consultation  involving  the  public  sector, \ndevelopment  partners,  the  private  sector,  civil  society,  academia,  and  women's  organizations. \nPublic  consultation  will  continue  throughout  the  program.  Notably,  the  stakeholder  forum \nestablished under subprogram 1 will reflect public views and inputs to the program.  \n \n\n                                                 \n17  State-Owned  Enterprise  Analysis  (Appendix  2);  B.

The \nloan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The remaining costs of the program will be met \nby the government. \n \n23. \nThe government shall ensure that the counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of \nthe loan will be onlent to the MEC to enable the repayment of its sovereign-guaranteed loan of \n$8.4  million  from  the  Bank  of  Guam  and  the  implementation  of  other  reforms  in  the  MEC \ncomprehensive  recovery  plan.  The  MEC\u2019s  cash  flow  will  be  improved,  enabling  the \nrefurbishment  of  its  generators.  This  will  help  ensure  continuity  of  supply  and,  combined  with \nother reforms, ensure the financial integrity of the MEC (footnote 10). \n \n24. \nLoan size has been determined after due consideration of (i) the adjustment costs to be \nincurred by the MEC in refurbishing its major assets and achieving a sound financial position, (ii) \nthe  significance  of  the  policy  actions,  and  (iii)  the  program's  alignment  with  the  RMI  country \noperations business plan, 2010\u20132012.19 \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe program will be provided as a cluster comprising two subprograms. A single tranche \n25. \nloan of $9.5 million equivalent will be disbursed under subprogram 1 when the government has \nmet  the  conditions  for  effectiveness.  The  duration  of  subprogram  1  is  from  1  April  2009  to  31 \nAugust 2010. Subprogram 2 will be presented for consideration and approval by ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors depending on the progress achieved in implementing subprogram 1. Subprogram 2 is \nexpected  to  be  considered  by  the  Board  18 months  after  the  loan  for  subprogram  1  becomes \neffective.   \n \n26.  MOF,  as  the  executing  agency,  shall  be  responsible  for  (i)  overseeing  all  policy,  legal, \nand regulatory actions to be undertaken in connection with the program and (ii) ensuring that all \npolicy  reforms  set  out  in  the  policy  letter  and  policy  matrix  are  duly  carried  out  in  a  timely \nmanner  (Appendixes  3  and  4).  MOF  shall  also  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  program \ncluster  and  the  program,  including  reporting  to  ADB,  administering  and  disbursing  loan \nproceeds, and maintaining program records and accounts.  \n \nThe government and ADB have agreed on a range of outcomes and output indicators to \n27. \nmonitor program implementation and evaluate its impact (Appendix 1). MOF will (i) establish a \nperformance evaluation system for the program within 4 months of loan effectiveness, which will \nbe  derived  from  the  design  and  monitoring  framework,  policy  letter,  and  policy  matrix,  and  (ii) \nmonitor and report to ADB every 6 months during the program on the implementation of policy \nactions  and  their  impact  on  budget  outcomes  and  SOE  performance  (including  financial  and \nperformance indicators), in line with the program impact and outcome indicators agreed with the \ngovernment.  \n \n\n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2010. Country Operations Business Plan: Marshall Islands, 2010\u20132012. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n  7 \n\nADB, in collaboration with MOF and other multilateral and bilateral agencies, will assess \n28. \nthe  program  performance  6 months  after  loan  effectiveness  to  review  the  outcome  of \nsubprogram  1  and  initiate  the  preparation  of  subprogram  2.20  This  review  will  (i) evaluate  the \nimplementation  of  the  policy  reform  measures  under  subprogram  1,  (ii)  assess  impact, \n(iii) identify lessons learned, and (iv) outline reforms and assistance needed for sustained fiscal \nconsolidation to enable the processing of subprogram 2. \n \n29. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  the  RMI  as  the  borrower  according  to \nADB\u2019s  Simplified  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans.21 \nThe proceeds will finance items produced and procured in ADB member countries and exclude \nitems  on  the  list  of  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral \nsources.22  Supporting  import  documentation  will  not  be  required  if,  during  each  year  that  loan \nproceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  RMI  imports  minus  imports  from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance  is  greater  than  the  amount  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  that  year.  Otherwise, \nimport documentation under existing procedures will be required. Before the first withdrawal, the \ngovernment will open or nominate a deposit account at a designated bank to receive the loan \nproceeds.  \n \n30. \n \n\nImplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 2.  \n\nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \n\nArrangements \nFrom 1 April 2009 to 31 August 2013  \n\nEstimated program completion date \n\n31 August 2013 \n\nProgram management \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\n \n\n(ii)   Executing and implementing agency  Ministry of Finance \n\nDisbursement \n\nProgram steering committee: Ministry of Finance, Ministry \nof Public Works, Ministry of Resources and Development, \nand the Chief Secretary's Office \n\nThe $14.5 million equivalent program cluster will be \ndisbursed as two single tranche loans: $9.5 million \nequivalent for subprogram 1 and $5.0 million equivalent \nfor subprogram 2. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nIt  is  proposed  that  TA  be  approved  together  with  the  program  to  support  its \n31. \nimplementation. The impact and outcome of the TA are the same as those of the program. The \nTA is estimated to cost $700,000 equivalent, of which $600,000 equivalent will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV).  The  government  will \nfinance $100,000 equivalent in kind. MOF will be the executing agency in conjunction with the \n\n                                                 \n20  The  development  partners  will  hold  a  development  partner  coordination  meeting  in  2010  that  will  establish  a \n\ncommon mechanism to provide ongoing support for the harmonized implementation of the program.  \n21 ADB. 1998.

The  TA  will  be  implemented  together  with  the \nprogram from mid-2010 to 31 August 2013.23  \n \n32. \nThe  TA  will  be  complemented  by  two  proposed  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction \n(JFPR) grant projects to be administered by ADB,  which will cover social safety nets, prepaid \nmetering,  refurbishment  of  generation  equipment,  and  grid  extension.24  The  proposed  JFPR-\nfunded project in the energy sector will support the MEC's reform initiatives to improve demand-\nside and supply-side efficiencies. Residents in Majuro will benefit from better access to reliable \npower and improved capacity provided by prepaid metering to reduce their power expenditure.25  \n \n33. \nThe TA for Pacific Economic Management supports economic monitoring, analysis, and \npolicy advice in Pacific developing member countries, including the RMI.26 The TA focus is on \nmacroeconomic  management  with  an  emphasis  on  fiscal  and  structural  policy.  The  scope  of \nassistance  extends  to  revitalizing  economic  management  systems,  including  support  for  the \nincreased participation of stakeholders in economic management and policy. \n \nThe  Pacific  Private  Sector  Development  Initiative  supports  Pacific  developing  member \n34. \ncountries\u2019 coordination of private sector reforms, including through SOE reforms and assistance \nin  developing  capacity  to  implement  public\u2013private  partnerships;  reforms  to  the  legal  enabling \nenvironment  for  business,  including  the  reform  of  company,  insolvency,  and  trustee  law;  and \nimproving access to financial services.27  \n \n35. \nTogether  with  ADB,  other  development  partners  are  providing  substantial  support  to \npublic sector reform in the RMI. With the proposed JFPR project on Improved Energy Supply for \nPoor Households, the US and ADB agree to work closely on installing prepaid meters through \nparallel implementation. The IMF\u2019s Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre will play a lead \nrole  in  assisting  the  government\u2019s  revenue  reform.  The  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment  will  work  closely  with  ADB  to  support  public  sector  reform  in  the  RMI.  The \nEuropean Union, Japan, and Taipei,China agreed to adopt a common approach with ADB and \nare exploring an opportunity for a formal partnership agreement. The World Bank will continue \nto provide technical support to improve the MEC's financial and technical management. In the \nspirit  of  development  partner  harmonization,  all  have  agreed  to  form  a  joint  program  steering \ncommittee to support the RMI reform effort. ADB assistance will be provided in a manner that is \nharmonized and consistent with that of other partners.28 \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\nThe  primary  gain  from  the  program  in  the  short  to  medium  term  will  be  the  improved \n36. \nbudgetary situation of the RMI, including the stabilization of the financial position of SOEs at risk. \nThis  will  provide  a  foundation  for  better  service  delivery  over  the  long  term  and,  in  turn, \n\n                                                 \n23 Technical Assistance (Appendix 2). \n24 Two JFPR proposals, (i) RMI: Improved Energy Supply for Poor Households and (ii) Regional: Social Protection of \nthe  Vulnerable  in  the  Pacific,  were  endorsed  by  the  Government  of  Japan  in  May  and  June  2010,  respectively. \nADB Board approval on a no-objection basis will be sought in August 2010. \n\n25  Grid  connection  and  solar  power  options  were  considered,  with  grid  connection  assessed  to  be  the  least-cost \n\noption.  \n\n26 ADB. 2009.

The private sector will be further assisted by actions to \nimprove  the  performance  of  SOEs  and  replace  inefficient  taxes.  Debt  restructuring  will  reduce \nthe net present value of public debt and lower the RMI\u2019s overall debt burden.29 \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n37. \nThe  program  will  improve  corporate  governance  in  targeted  SOEs  through  the \napplication of good practice principles. Governance standards will be enhanced by an open and \ntransparent  approach  to  the  implementation  of  CAP  Advisory  Group  and  TRAM  commission \nrecommendations, combined with policy action that enhances stakeholder participation. \n \n38. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MOF.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the draft loan agreement. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social  \n\n39. \nOver  time,  the  program  will  yield  broadly  distributed  social  benefits  by  providing  a \nfoundation for improving the fiscal position of the RMI. This will enhance the sustainable delivery \nof essential services and support for vulnerable members of the community. The Government of \nJapan has recently approved a new JFPR proposal to establish a social safety net in the RMI. \nSubject  to  ADB  approval, 30  the  project  will  complement  the  program  by  providing  additional \nsupport.  \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe  program  is  classified  under  safeguard  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary \n\n40. \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe major risk is the sustainability of commitment to reform. However, this risk has been \n41. \nmitigated  by  carefully  sequencing  reforms,  emphasizing  wide  community  participation  in  the \nformulation  of  the  program,  and  closely  coordinating  with  development  partners,  including  the \ninstigation of a mechanism for development partner coordination. The benefits are expected to \noutweigh the costs and risks. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3.31  \n \n\nTable 3: Summary of Key Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nThe government's capacity to effectively \nimplement reforms may prove insufficient. \n\nMitigating Measures \nTechnical assistance will be provided to the Ministry of Finance, \nSOEs, and other relevant agencies. \n\nThe government's commitment to the \ncurrent pace of reform may not be sustained \nif political support is lost. \n\nA public consultation program has been established and is ongoing.a  \n\n                                                 \n29 The RMI had external government and government-guaranteed debt of $94.3 million, or 61.7% of GDP, at the end \n\nof FY2009. The net present value of the debt is estimated at 35.1% of GDP.   \n\n30 The  Government  of  Japan  approved  the  proposal  on  10  June  2010.  The  proposal  will  be  reviewed  by  the  ADB \n\nBoard of Directors in August 2010 on a no-objection basis. \n31  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2). \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nThe MEC will not maintain monthly \npayments into the RMI sinking fund bank \naccount.  \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe government will establish a debt-serving sinking fund, which will \nbe linked  with the MEC's revenue account for automatic transfers of \nMEC revenue to the sinking fund.  \n\nThe  government  has  limited  capacity  to \nundertake additional borrowing.  \n\nThe debt-restructuring portion of the program will reduce the net \npresent value of public debt and lower the RMI\u2019s debt burden. \n\nMEC = Marshalls Energy Company, RMI = Republic of the Marshall Islands, SOE = state-owned enterprise.  \na Public Consultation Program (Appendix 2). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe government and MOF have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \n42. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement. \n \n43. \nThe  loan  will  become  effective  only  after  the  government  has  satisfactorily  fulfilled  all \nconditions  for  the  release  of  the  single  tranche  of  subprogram  1.
