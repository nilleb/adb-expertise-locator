THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the Bihar State Highways II Project. The report also describes proposed technical \nassistance (TA) for the Capacity Building for Bihar State Road Sector. If the Board approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n2.  The Bihar State Highways II Project1 will build and upgrade about 356 kilometers (km) of \nstate highways identified under the State Highway Development Program in Bihar. It will involve \nupgrading roads to two lanes, strengthening culverts and bridges, building new road sections \nand  bridges  and  cross-drainage  structures,  and  building  structures  for  resettlement  and \nrehabilitation. Consulting support will be provided to support implementation of civil works. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Under the India country partnership strategy (2009\u20132012), the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) supports all levels of the road sector development as a core infrastructure operation to \nfacilitate sustainable economic growth. The project is consistent with the strategic objective set \nout in the country partnership strategy and included in the India country operations business \nplan (2010). \n \n4.  In India, road transport accounts for 68% of freight movement and 87% of passenger \ntraffic. The national highways and the secondary system are unable to cope with the rapid traffic \ngrowth. In the road sector, freight traffic increased at about 12% per year and passenger traffic \nat about 8% in the past decade. The rapid growth in traffic leads to congestion, deterioration of \nroads and increase in the cost of transport. State highways, the secondary road system in India, \nlink national highways with district headquarters and important towns. The secondary system \ncomprises about 13% of the road network and carries about 40% of traffic. It is estimated that \nabout half of the roads in the secondary system are of poor riding quality. \n \n5.  Bihar is one of the economically backward states of India. Judged by the per capita state \nincome of Rs9,765 in the FY2007, Bihar ranks far below the all India average of Rs33,299, \nwhich is a measure of standard of living. The road network in Bihar is very poor in terms of \ncoverage and conditions while demand for road transport is increasing. The road density in \nBihar is only 861 km per million population, compared with the national average of 2,828 km. \nAbout  half  of  villages  lack  all-weather  road  connectivity.  Insufficient  funding  for  road \nmaintenance in the past has increased the number of roads beyond maintainable condition.  \n \n6.  The government of Bihar is undertaking the State Highway Development Program to \nrehabilitate and upgrade state highways to at least two lanes and expand the state highway \nnetwork by upgrading major district roads to two lanes. The program covers upgrading 2,831 km \nout of the 3,127 km of state highways during the 11th Five Year Plan period (2007\u20132012) \nthrough various schemes, including government schemes, pilot projects such as the public\u2013\nprivate\u2013partnership scheme with a build\u2013operate\u2013transfer contract for a major bridge and ADB \nassistance. The ongoing Bihar State Highways Project2 is providing financial assistance for \n                                                 \n1  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA 7198-IND). \n2  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to India for the \nBihar State Highways Project. Manila (Loan 2443-IND). ", "2 \nwidening of 820 km of state highways to two lanes. The improvement of 356 km of state \nhighways to be financed under the proposed loan is part of the program to help meet increased \ndemands for road transport, and accelerate the process of sustainable economic growth. \n \n7.  The Bihar State Highways Project is progressing well and is expected to be completed \nbefore the loan closes on 31 July 2012. All civil works contracts were awarded in the first year \nafter loan approval, and the performance and disbursement targets have been achieved. ADB \nTA supported the institutional strengthening of the Bihar State Road Development Corporation \nLimited  (BSRDC),  which  was  established  by  the  Bihar  government  in  February 2009  to \nimplement  the  project.3  BSRDC\u2019s  experience  in  the  ongoing  project  and  its  institutional \nstrengthening  has  benefited  the  preparation  of  the  proposed  loan  and  boosted  project \nreadiness.  \n \n8.  As  lack  of  road  maintenance  and  inability  to  spend  the  allocated  budget  for  road \nmaintenance in the past were identified as key factors leading to the deteriorated status of many \nproject roads, the focus of institutional strengthening by the capacity development TA will be on \ncompletion of a state wide roads asset registry and improving maintenance management. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  project  impact  will  be  a  more  efficient  state  road  transport  system  supporting \nsustainable economic growth in Bihar by (i) improving the state highway network\u2019s efficiency by \nreducing  the  travel  times,  (ii)  facilitating  safe  road  transport  by  full  implementation  of  the \nrecommendations from the road safety audit for the project roads, and (iii) enhancing the \ngovernment of Bihar\u2019s capacity for road asset management and road maintenance. The project \noutcome will be increased transport efficiency and safety on project roads. \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The project output will be (i) building and upgrading 356 km of state highways identified \nunder the State Highway Development Program (Table 1) and (ii) improved management of \nroad assets and maintenance of project roads by BSRDC.  \n \nTable 1: Project Roads \nState Highway  Project Road  Length (kilometer) \n78  Bihta\u2013Sarmera  100 \n81  Sakkadi\u2013Nasrigunj  85 \n90  Mohammadpur\u2013Chapra  69 \n91  Birpur\u2013Udakishunganj  102 \nTotal  356 \nSource: Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited. \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n11.  The project is estimated to cost $424 million including local taxes and duties estimated \nat $30.5 million and financing charges (Table 2). ADB will finance the local taxes and duties \nassociated with project expenditures for works in the amount of about $27.7 million. This is in \nline with the India country partnership strategy (2009\u20132012), which considers taxes and duties \nnot exceeding 10% of project costs reasonable, transparent, and nondiscriminatory. \n                                                 \n3  Attached to ADB. 2008.

Interest during construction for the ADB loan(s) is computed at the \n5-year forward London interbank offered rate plus a spread of 0.3%. Commitment charges for an ADB loan are \n0.15% per year on the undisbursed loan amount.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n12.  The Government of India has requested a loan of $300.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources for the project. The loan will have a term of 25 years, including a grace period \nof 5 years, an annual interest rate determined according to ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, subject to a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The government has provided ADB \nwith (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the \nbasis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n13.  The financing plan is in Table 3. The ADB loan will finance 70.75% of the project cost. \nThis is considered acceptable, taking into account that the government of Bihar has allocated its \ncounterpart financing for 29.25% of the cost. By including more roads in the loan, the benefits \nwill be spread into more areas of the state. \n \n14.  The government will provide the loan proceeds in local currency to the government of \nBihar on the same terms and conditions as received from ADB. The government of Bihar will bear \nthe foreign exchange risk on the loan. \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  300.00    70.75 \nGovernment  124.00    29.25 \nTotal    424.00    100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The executing agency for the project will be the government of Bihar acting through \nBSRDC. BSRDC is wholly owned by the government of Bihar and has been equipped with \nadequate capacity to implement the project. The project will use project implementation units \nthat exist in the project area in Biharsharif, Ara, Hajipur, and Araria, and will place additional \n ", "4 \nstaff to specifically work on the project. Each project team in a project implementation unit is \nheaded by a deputy general manager and will be responsible for implementation in the field. \nOne or two full-time project managers will be assigned for each contract package. The project \nmanagers will be delegated adequate technical and administrative authority for expeditious \nproject implementation. BSRDC will engage construction supervision consultants to act as the \nengineer for the construction contracts. \n \n16.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.4  \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspect   Arrangements \nImplementation period  4 years \nEstimated project completion date  31 December 2014 \nProject management \n(i)   Executing agency  Government of Bihar, acting through the Bihar State Road \nDevelopment Corporation Limited \n(ii)  Project implementation units  In Biharsharif, Ara, Hajipur, and Araria: 1 deputy general manager \n(tech), 1 or 2 project managers, and supporting staff for each unit \nProcurement  International  4 civil works  $54,000,000\u2013\ncompetitive bidding  contracts  $88,000,000 each \nNational competitive  Maximum 5  Maximum \nbidding  contracts for supply  $3,000,000 (total) \nof goods \nShopping  Maximum 5  Maximum $300,000 \ncontracts for supply  (total) \nof goods \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost- Around 2,950  $10,500,000 \nbased selection; full  person-months \ntechnical proposal \nRetroactive financing and advance  Works and consulting services  \ncontracting \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed on between the Government of India \nand ADB. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n17.  Capacity development TA for $1,000,000 to build the capacity of the Bihar state road \nsector will further support the institutional development initiatives of the government of Bihar. \nThe  TA  will  assist  and  support  the  recently  established  BSRDC  in  improving  project \nimplementation, designing future projects, and ensuring the future operation and maintenance \nof the improved roads through the full consumption of the budget allocated for road asset \nmanagement. The consultants will conduct district and statewide training and workshops as \nrequired. \n \n                                                 \n4  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \n18.  The TA will be financed with a grant from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF\u2013Others).  An  international  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  by  ADB  according  to  its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Consultants will be \nasked to submit simplified technical proposals, and the selection will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection method using a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n19.  The project was prepared with the enhanced capacity of BSRDC,  which has been \ngained through the ongoing loan and ADB TA provided for capacity building of the Road \nConstruction Department and BSRDC. BSRDC engaged detailed design consultants with its \nown funds to prepare detailed design documents for roads proposed for possible ADB financing, \nincorporating  ADB\u2019s  requirements  of  economic,  social,  and  environmental  studies  into  the \nconsultants\u2019 terms of reference. The government of Bihar asked ADB for TA to conduct due \ndiligence  to  ensure  that  the  detailed  design  consultants\u2019  work  fully  complies  with  ADB \nrequirements. Engineering design is prepared to minimize land acquisition as well as social and \nenvironmental  impacts.  A  road  safety  audit  was  performed  as  part  of  the  TA  and  the \nrecommendations were incorporated in the engineering design of the project. Advance actions \nhave been taken to ensure that the construction can commence early. All of these measures \nhave improved project readiness and will mitigate the risk of delay. \nB.  Economic \n20.  The economic evaluation of the project followed the standard practice of comparing \nlife-cycle road agency and user costs with and without the project, using net present value with \na 12% discount rate and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as decision criteria. The \nHighway Development and Management (HDM-4) system was used in the analysis, which \nfocused on transport cost savings.  \n \n21.  Value added from better transport links resulting in new industries and employment are \nnot quantified in this analysis but are captured through benefits to generated traffic. \n \n22.  The EIRR for the four roads evaluated (Table 1) varies from 17.1% to 28.8%. Overall, \nthe project is very robust with a high EIRR, satisfying the economic efficiency criteria.  \n \n23.  The sensitivity of the EIRR for the project roads was analyzed with respect to changes in \nthe  benefit  and  cost  streams.  The  following  sensitivity  test  cases  were  examined:  (i) \nconstruction costs increased by 15%, (ii) time benefits reduced by 50%, (iii) benefits decreased \nby 15%, and (iv) a combination of (i) and (iii). The results show that the quantified economic \nbenefits are robust to various sensitivity tests. All selected roads have an EIRR above 12% in all \nsensitivity tests.5  \nC.  Governance \n24.  Institutional capacity. A project preparatory TA consultant and a capacity development \nTA consultant from the Bihar State Highways Project approved in 2008 supplemented BSRDC\u2019s \ncapacity  during  project  preparation.  BSRDC\u2019s  capacity  for  implementation  will  be  further \n                                                 \n5  Economic Analysis (Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nsupported by the supervision consultant, who will assist with the supervision of civil works. For \nlong-term  capacity  strengthening,  TA  will  be  provided  to  make  BSRDC  more  effective  in \ndeveloping, operating, and maintaining the state highways.  \n \n25.  Financial management. BSRDC has ongoing experience with implementing an ADB-\nfunded project (footnote 2).6 It has satisfactory capacity for project financial accounting and \nsufficient knowledge of ADB\u2019s disbursement procedures.  \n \n26.  Procurement. Goods and works will be procured according to the ADB Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time), with prior reviews by ADB at key steps in the \nprocess. BSRDC has successfully awarded the first works contract for the project as part of \nadvance procurement action. The e-tendering system of Bihar will be assessed and, if found to \nmeet ADB\u2019s requirements, may be used for future procurement with prior approval from ADB. \n \n27.  Anticorruption.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) has been \nexplained to and discussed with the government and BSRDC. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  Poverty reduction and social impact. Bihar state is India\u2019s 12th largest in geographic \nsize (99,200 km\u00b2) and third largest in population. Nearly 85% of the population is rural. Bihar \nhas the highest proportion of the population living below the poverty line, at 42.6%, according to \nestimates  of  the  state  government  and  the  Planning  Commission  of  India.  The  human \ndevelopment  index  (a  composite  of  literacy,  life  expectancy,  and  per  capita  income)  has \nincreased for Bihar, as it has for the rest of India. But Bihar still ranks 15th among the states, the \nsame rank it has held since 1981. In 2001 its human development index was 0.267, compared \nwith 0.472 for India. \n \n29.  The population of Bihar in 2001 was 82,878,796, 28.43% more than in 1991. The overall \npopulation density was 880 persons per square km. Nearly 20% of the population is in the 0\u20136 \nage group. There are 921 females for every 1,000 males. Bihar has the lowest literacy rate in \nIndia, the average for the state being 47%. Close to 60% of males, but only 33.1% of females, \nare literate. Life expectancy is 61 years, almost at par with the national life expectancy of \n62.7 years.  \n \n30.  A poverty and social assessment made during project preparation showed that Bihar has \na largely service-oriented economy with a significant agriculture base and a small industrial \nsector. In 2008 agriculture accounted for 35%, industry for 9%, and services for 55% of the \nstate\u2019s economy. Agriculture, including crop cultivation and livestock production, is the source of \nlivelihood of the majority of the population. Bihar has the lowest gross domestic product (GDP) \nper  capita  in  India,  although  there  are  pockets  of  higher-than-average  per  capita  income. \nBetween 1999 and 2008, GDP grew by 5.1% yearly, below the Indian average of 7.3%. More \nrecently, it grew by 18% from 2006 to 2007, making Bihar the fastest-growing major state.  \n \n31.  Bihar is among India\u2019s economically backward states. Per capita income in the state in \nFY2007 was Rs9,765, far below the national average of Rs33,299. The improvements in state \nhighways are expected to increase economic opportunities by (i) enabling villagers to shift from \n                                                 \n6  Since its creation on 17 February 2009, under Resolution Sec 8/Misc/05-117/2006-1014 (s)we, BSRDC has taken \nover project implementation work from the Road Construction Department. \n ", "7 \nsubsistence farming to market-oriented agricultural surplus production; and (ii) helping local \npeople, particularly the rural youth, to find better-paying jobs in trading and other new jobs. The \nproject will contribute indirectly to better access to health, education, and social services. It will \nalso  have  a  short-term  impact  on  poverty  reduction,  as  the  rural  poor  will  be  hired  for \nconstruction, tree planting, and ensuing maintenance. These opportunities will increase the \nearnings of the poor, who now depend largely on occasional and uncertain employment.7  \n \n32.  Gender. There are 921 females for every 1,000 males in Bihar (2001 census). Although \nthe literate population is still disproportionately male (para. 29), substantial improvements have \nbeen made of late. Almost all girls are now enrolled in school up to the secondary level, and the \nstate has launched innovative schemes such as integrated education development and the \nprovision of bicycles and school uniforms, scholarships, and hostel facilities for female students. \nFocus  group  discussions  with  women  from  different  socioeconomic  groups  in  the  project \ninfluence areas revealed that the majority work in the home and outside and are consulted by \ntheir spouse and other family members before any family decision. Better roads will promote \nbetter  transport  services,  and  give  everyone  better  access  to  social  services,  markets, \nworkplaces, higher education, health facilities, and employment opportunities.  \n \n33.  HIV and AIDS. India\u2019s National AIDS Control Organization estimates the number of \npersons living with HIV in India at 2.31 million in 2007, and adult HIV prevalence at 0.34%. The \nHIV sentinel surveillance in 2007 did not include Bihar as a prevalent area for HIV or AIDS.  \n \n34.  According  to  India\u2019s  National  AIDS  Control  Organization,  HIV  infection  is  typically \nconcentrated among the poor and marginalized groups (including such high-risk groups as sex \nworkers, drug users, migrant laborers, and truck drivers). These groups, particularly truckers, \npropel the HIV epidemic, and studies indicate that the infection is spreading rapidly to the \ngeneral population. But Bihar is a low-prevalence state. The detailed study done during project \npreparation did not anticipate any risks of a rise in HIV or AIDS as a result of the project. The \nhealth department and the Bihar State AIDS Control Society are already carrying out state, \ndistrict, and block campaigns to increase awareness of the disease. In addition, BSRDC and \nimplementing nongovernment organizations will involve the Bihar State AIDS Control Society \nand local health agencies in social awareness programs (on various subjects including HIV and \nAIDS) in the project areas. \nE.  Safeguards \n35.  Environmental impact. The project is classified under category B in accordance with \nADBs Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and therefore, initial environmental examinations \nwere prepared for the four project roads. The findings show that the project is unlikely to have \nany site-related impact on the environment that is significant, adverse, or irreversible, since it \nwill not cross any forest area, wildlife sanctuary, national park, critical habitat, or other eco-\nsensitive  area  for  biodiversity  ecosystems.  Most  of  the  impact  is  likely  to  occur  during \nconstruction, from earth movement, ground shaping, heavy equipment operation, and travel \nover unpaved roads. This impact will be temporary, and mitigation measures can be easily \ndesigned and implemented. No further environmental impact assessment is therefore necessary. \nBSRDC will be responsible for the implementation of the environmental management plan \n(EMP). The fully functional environment, social development, and resettlement cell, which was \nactively involved in the implementation of the EMP for the Bihar State Highways Project, will \n                                                 \n7  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nalso implement the EMP for this project. Some activities will be implemented by contractors, \nparticularly during construction. \n \n36.  Land acquisition and resettlement impact. The project is classified under category A \nfor resettlement impacts. The project was developed with a view to avoiding or minimizing land \nacquisition and involuntary resettlement by adopting the most feasible technical design. The \nproposed widening of roads will occur within the existing right-of-way, except for State Highway \n78, and bypasses, which will be provided for congested villages and marketplaces. A full census \nbased on the detailed designs for the four project roads was conducted. Resettlement plans \nwere prepared according to the government\u2019s National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy \n(2007), the Bihar Land Acquisition Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy (2007), and ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). According to the project census, 19,797 land units and \n7,730 structures (7,619 private, 3 community, 60 religious, and 48 government) will be affected \nby the project. Among the 7,619 private structures, 5,954 belong to titleholders and 1,665 to \nnon-titleholders. The 138,624 persons to be displaced by the project will be compensated for \nlost assets on the basis of replacement cost. Both titleholders and non-titleholders will be given \nresettlement assistance to help make up for lost income and livelihoods. The resettlement plans \nprovide for special resettlement and rehabilitation measures for vulnerable displaced persons \nand households. The specific compensation and resettlement assistance available for each type \nof loss resulting from the project is spelled out in the entitlement matrix. The resettlement cost \nfor the four road subprojects is estimated at Rs3,425 million ($76.96 million equivalent). \n \n37.  Impact on indigenous people. The project is classified under category C for impact on \nindigenous  people.  According  to  the  2001  census,  Bihar  has  an  indigenous  population  of \n758,351, or 0.9% of its population, versus 8.2% for all of India. Of the 38 districts in the state, six \nhave no indigenous people; in the rest, the indigenous population varies from 0.01% to 5.9%. \nThe highest proportion of indigenous people is found in Katihar district (5.9%), followed by \nJamui (4.8%), Banka (4.7%), and Purnia (4.4%); the lowest, in Darbhanga (0.03%), Khagaria \n(0.03%), and Sheohar (0.01%). The project area has no demarcated indigenous people areas. \nThe social assessment revealed no impact on indigenous groups within the area of influence of \nthe road subprojects. Indigenous members in the project area have been assimilated into the \nlocal population. The study done during project preparation did not show any difference in \nimpact between indigenous and non-indigenous groups in the project locations. Construction \nwill not adversely affect the socioeconomic conditions or the community life or culture of these \ncommunities. On the other hand, the improved road network is expected to give both indigenous \ngroups and other parts of the project population easier access to socioeconomic facilities. \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5.  \n \n ", "9 \nTable 5: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInitial delays in  BSRDC prepared the detailed design for the roads well in advance.

ASSURANCES  \n39.  The government and BSRDC have assured ADB that the implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n40.  The  government  and  BSRDC  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n41.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$300,000,000 to India for the Bihar State Highways II Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; \nand other such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n   \n  Haruhiko Kuroda \n  President \n \n23 August 2010 \n \n ", "10  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks  \nImpact     Assumptions \nA more efficient  Road traffic on project roads  Post-implementation  Government development \nstate road transport  increases by 90% until 2020  measurement and traffic  activities are effectively \nsystem supporting  from current level (2009  survey  coordinated with road \nsustainable  baseline: between 1,858    sector investment and the \neconomic growth in  vehicles per day on State    current economic growth \nBihar  Highway 81 and 4,276    rate is maintained. \nvehicles per day on State   \nRisks \nHighway 91).   \n    Small roadside businesses \nPer capita GDP in the project  Government of Bihar\u2019s  could lose business \ndistricts increases to 28% of  economic survey  opportunities because of \nIndia\u2019s per capita GDP by    increased efficiency and \n2020 (2007 baseline: 23%).  speed of travel of vehicles. \nOutcome     Assumptions \nIncreased transport  Vehicle travel time on the  Post-implementation  The project is delivered on \nefficiency and  project roads is reduced  measurement  and  traffic  time. \nsafety on project  because of the improved  survey \nThe state-allocated \nroads  condition of the roads; travel   \nmaintenance budget \nspeed increases to an   \nremains sufficient for the \naverage of 40 km/h for cars   \nmaintenance of the entire \n(2009 baseline: 15\u201325 km/h).   \nrehabilitated road network. \n   \nRoad signage meets the    Strengthened management \nrequirements of the road  Post-implementation  and monitoring capacity \nsafety audit upon project  survey  enables the full utilization \ncompletion (2009 baseline:    of funds allocated for \nroad signage is basic).  maintenance works.  \n \nA road asset inventory \ndatabase is established \nand project management \ntools are available and in \nuse. \nOutputs     Assumptions \n1.
