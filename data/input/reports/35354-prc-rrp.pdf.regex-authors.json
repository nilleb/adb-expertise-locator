An environmental impact assessment was completed and \nAssessment  the  summary  was  circulated  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nBoard of Directors on 16 August 2007. \n   \nProject Description  The  Lanzhou\u2013Chongqing  Railway  (LCR)  Development  Project  is  in \nChongqing  municipality  and  the  northwestern  part  of  Sichuan  and \nGansu  provinces\u2014a  relatively  poor  area.  It  is  designed  to  promote \nsustainable economic growth by building 820 kilometers (km) of railway \nline from Lanzhou, the capital city of Gansu province, to Chongqing. The \nProject will (i) develop an efficient, safe, affordable, and environmentally \nsustainable railway transport system in the region; and (ii) help create \nmore employment and income-generating opportunities, thus benefiting \npoor residents.  \n   \nRationale  The  Project  reflects  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  for  the  PRC  railway \nsector,  which  includes  reducing  railway  network  constraints  and \npromoting sustainable economic growth in poor areas not served by \nrailways.  The  Project  is  also  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  western \ndevelopment strategy of providing less-developed regions with better \ninfrastructure  to  facilitate  economic  growth,  thereby  giving  people  a \nbetter opportunity to improve their living standards.  \nThe  interior  regions  of  the  PRC  have  not  benefited  as  much  from \neconomic  growth  and  reforms  as  the  east  coast;  in  fact,  the  gap \nbetween  economic  and  social  development  in  those  regions  has \nincreased. Transport constraints and high logistics costs contribute to \nthe economic disparities between the regions and prevent the western \nregion from capitalizing on its comparative advantages. \nThe Project will be (i) the first north\u2013south railway line linking Chongqing \nmunicipality and Gansu, Shaanxi, and Sichuan provinces; and (ii) the \nshortest north\u2013south corridor linking Lanzhou, Baoji, Yinchuan, Xining, \nXinjiang, and other major cities in the north to Chongqing, Chengdu, \nGuiyang,  Kunming,  and  other  ports  and  cities  in  the  south.  The \nproposed alignment for the LCR is shorter by 295 km and 600 km than \nthe two existing routes between Lanzhou and Chongqing. Traversing \nGansu, Shaanxi, and Sichuan provinces and Chongqing municipality, \nthe  proposed  railway  line  will  connect  with  the  Baotou\u2013Yinchuan\u2013\nLanzhou in the northeast; Urumqi\u2013Lanzhou in the northwest on its way \nto Kazakhstan and Europe; Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Ankang in the east, at \n ", "ii \nGuangyuan;  Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Yichang\u2013Daxian\u2013Chengdu  in  the \ncenter;  Yichang\u2013Lichuan\u2013Chongqing,  Chongqing\u2013Guiyang,  and \nChongqing\u2013Kunming in the south on its way to Viet Nam, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, and Southeast Asia; and the main lines Xi\u2019an\u2013\nChongqing  in  the  north,  and  Chongqing\u2013Chengdu  in  the  west.  The \nProject will also help promote regional cooperation, as this north\u2013south \ncorridor will be the shortest linking the Greater Mekong Subregion to \nCentral  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  countries  through  the \nPRC. \n   \n  The project company, a joint venture of the Ministry of Railways (MOR) \nand the Chongqing municipal, Gansu provincial, and Sichuan provincial \ngovernments, will have substantial managerial and financial autonomy. It \nwill  help  change  railway  enterprises  from  cost  centers  in  a  planned \neconomy  to  profit  centers  in  an  increasingly  competitive  transport \nmarket.  The  components  have  been  formulated  in  line  with  MOR\u2019s \nrailway development plan for 2004. \n   \nImpact and  The impact of the Project will be an improved transport system in the \nOutcome  region  that  supports  socioeconomic  development  and  the  western \ndevelopment  strategy.  Providing  economic  railway  transportation  in \nunserved, less-developed, and poor areas will help create the conditions \nfor local resource development, more jobs, and higher incomes and thus \nraise living standards in the project area.  \n \nProject  preparation  was  participatory.  All  the  main  stakeholders\u2014\nvarious affected people, potential beneficiaries, village leaders, women\u2019s \ngroups,  local  ethnic  bureaus,  and  local  governments  in  the  project \narea\u2014were extensively consulted. Household surveys and participatory \nworkshops in the project area elicited public opinion about the Project \nand useful information for the social and environmental assessments. \n \nThe Project has the following components: (i) the construction of 820 km \nof double-track electrified standard-gauge class I railway from Lanzhou \nto Chongqing; (ii) the construction of 31 new railway stations complete \nwith facilities; (iii) the provision of modern technology and equipment, \namong  other  initiatives,  to  improve  safety;  (iv)  the  introduction  of  a \nsignaling, communication, and management information system; (v) the \nprovision  of  training  in  the  use  and  maintenance  of  the  modern \nequipment;  (vi)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  (vii)  environmental \nprotection  and  mitigation  of  adverse  environmental  effects; \n(viii) consulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  and  marketing  and  business  development;  and  (ix)  the \nstrengthening  of  institutional  capabilities.  Project  implementation  will \nrequire these key inputs: civil works, equipment, consultants, and MOR \nand project company staff.  \n   \nProject Investment  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $8,608.9 million.  \nPlan \n   \n \n ", "  iii \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based \nlending facility. The loan will have a term of 27 years including a grace \nperiod  of  7  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% yearly, \nand other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n   \nPeriod of  Until 30 June 2016 \nUtilization   \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2015 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  MOR \n   \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented over 7 years. The Foreign Capital and \nArrangements  Technical Import Center under MOR will coordinate the tasks of the \nproject  management  office  and  be  responsible  for  procurement, \nwithdrawals,  and  reporting  to  ADB.  The  project  company,  the \nImplementing  Agency,  will  manage  and  run  the  project  railway,  and \ndevelop  and  implement  adequate  and  transparent  business \ndevelopment mechanisms, and accounting and reporting systems.  \n   \nProcurement  MOR  will  procure  ADB-financed  components  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), and \nother items according to government procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n   \nConsulting  The ADB loan will finance 10 person-months of international consulting \nServices  services  to  strengthen  the  institutional,  marketing,  and  business \ndevelopment functions of the project company. The consultants will be \nrecruited  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). In addition, MOR will hire and \nfinance  the  services  of  national  consultants  for  project  design, \nconstruction  supervision,  construction  quality  control,  environmental \nsupervision,  procurement,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the \nsafeguard aspects of the Project. \n \nProject Benefits  The Project will (i) provide the shortest land route between Lanzhou, \nand Beneficiaries  Longnan, Guangyuan, and Chongqing\u2014key economic centers of Gansu \nand Sichuan provinces and Chongqing municipality\u2014lowering transport \ncosts  for  railway  users  and  cutting  travel  distances  and  times; \n(ii) increase the corridor\u2019s capacity, to the benefit of consumers and \nproducers of goods and services, who can avail themselves of timely \nand efficient transport services and lower logistics costs; (iii) generate \ndirect and indirect employment and other income-earning opportunities \nin the project influence area (much local unskilled labor will be hired to \nbuild and operate the railway); (iv) broaden access to markets for an \narea that lacks cost-efficient transportation services; and (v) stimulate \nlocal development through small-business opportunities, tourism, and \nrailway station area and other infrastructure development.  \n \n ", "iv \nThe major project beneficiaries will be (i) the Government, which stands \nto gain from improved safety and a lower energy bill; (ii) passengers, \nincluding tourists, for whom travel will be affordable, faster, and safer; \n(iii) freight users, who switch from the existing road and benefit from \nmore affordable, faster, and safer trips; (iv) local residents, who will pay \nless for goods and services transported by the project railway; (v) local \nlabor hired to build the railway, supply materials during construction, and \nload and unload goods during operation; (vi) local farmers, who can sell \ntheir products at market prices without having to pay a high margin to a \ntransport intermediary; (vii) manufacturers and traders, who can set up \nbusinesses, produce more, and transport their goods and services by \nthe  railway;  and  (viii) local  governments,  which  will  have  greater \nopportunity for local area development and higher tax revenues. \n \nThe Project will benefit about 16.8 million people living in the project \narea. The poverty and social assessment looked at the 28 counties and \ndistricts in the area, including 15 designated national poverty counties \nand 2,897 designated poverty villages. About 72% of the beneficiaries \nare rural, and 17% are poor, with an annual net income per capita of \nless than CNY1,000. The links between poverty, difficult topography, \nand poor transport systems are apparent in the project area. Poverty is \noften caused by geographic remoteness and isolation, limited transport \naccess, high transport costs, and poor access to market information, as \nwell as limited access to health, education, and other social services. \n \n  The Project will give rise to more jobs and income opportunities. The \n468,000  or  so  person-years  of  work  during  construction  will  provide \ndirect employment for over 234,000 poor people, including women and \nethnic  minorities.  Railway  station  area  development  will  boost  the \nincomes of communities and produce tax revenues. The development of \nsmall businesses, local industry, and tourism through the Project will \nincrease opportunities in the future for local people. Consultations with \nlocal people in the project area indicated strong support for the Project. \n \nThe  Project  is  financially  and  economically  sustainable.  The  6.98% \nfinancial internal rate of return exceeds the 2.74% weighted average \ncost of capital. The economic internal rate of return is 17.09%.  \n \nThe increased tax revenues from the economic development induced by \nthe Project will help finance improvements in social service facilities and \nbasic infrastructure. \n   \nRisks and  The  construction  of  the  railway,  in  mountainous  areas,  presents  a \nAssumptions  significant  technical  challenge.  Construction  could  be  delayed,  cost \n  more than expected, compromise the health and safety of workers, and \nadversely  affect  the  environment.  These  potential  risks  have  been \nassessed and mitigating measures based on lessons learned from other \nrailway projects in the PRC have been provided.  \n \nResettlement will cause the relocation of about 12,000 households. The \nrailway  alignment  was  selected  to  minimize  resettlement,  where \n ", "  v \npossible.  Those  resettled  will  be  given  preference  in  hiring  for \nconstruction,  in  the  supply  of  local  materials,  in  the  allocation  of \ncommercial space near railway stations, and in job training. To mitigate \nthe  potential  social  risks,  resettlement  will  be  implemented  by  local \ngovernments and closely monitored and supervised. \n \nIntermodal competition between railways and roads will pose market \nrisks  for  the  project  railway.  However,  the  existing  road  is  in  poor \ncondition  and  congested,  and  the  congestion  will  only  get  worse. \nPassengers and freight shippers surveyed pointed out the advantages of \nrailways over other transport modes: lower fares, shorter travel times, \nsafety, and punctuality. The increasing commercial orientation of the \njoint-venture railway will help lessen the market risks. \n   \nTechnical  A technical assistance grant not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 \nAssistance  from  the  Clean  Energy  Fund  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing \nPartnership Facility is proposed to assist MOR in preparing the Railway \nSector Energy Efficiency Strategy. The technical assistance grant will \nsupport  (i)  an  analysis  of  the  energy  efficiency  of  the  PRC  railway \nsector, (ii) the identification of areas where energy efficiency can be \nimproved, and (iii) the recommendation of actions and technologies that \ncan be adopted. Areas where energy efficiency can be improved will be \nprioritized and a pipeline of priority lending projects for energy efficiency \nin the PRC railway sector, some of which can be supported by ADB, will \nbe recommended. \n \nConsultants  financed  by  ADB  will  be  recruited  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Consulting firms will be selected through international competition \nafter submitting simplified technical proposals, which will be evaluated \non the basis of a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. \n ", "100 o 00'E M O N G O L I A 120 o 00'E\nINNER   MONGOLIA\nLANZHOU\u2013 CHONGQING\nRAILWAY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nto Urumqi PEOPLE'S REINP UTHBELIC OF CHINA Baotou Hohhot Jining\nDHounagnsgh Heneg(Yellow River)Datong BEIJING Qinhuangdao\nTIANJIN\nShuoxian\nYumen Yinchuan Shenmu North HEBBEazIhou Tianjin BSoehaai\nHuanghua\nSHENMU\u2013YAN'AN RAILWAY Yuanping Shijiazhuang\nYulin Taiyuan\nZhongwei Hengshui Yantai\nYuci Dezhou\nGantang Suide\nNINGXIA Mucun SHANXI Shehe Jinan\nSHANDONG\nQINGHAI Xining Lanzhou TAIYUAN\u2013 ZHONGWEI RAILWAY Xiaoyi Tunilu Fengteng JING\u2013 JIU RAILWAY Qingdao 35 o 00'N\nYan\u2019an North\nSHANXI\u2013 XIAOLIU RAILWAY Hancheng LinfenJiaozuoXin Xiang Yanzhou ShijiuYsueollow  Sea\n35 o 00'N Zhongjiacun TongguanHYouuemshaan Zhengzhou HeXzuezhou Linyi Lianyungang\nGANSU Baoji Xinfeng HENAN Shangqiu XinyiJIANGSU\nXi'an Qingling Tunnel\nLANZHOU\u2013 CHONGQSINICGH RUAIALWNAY HYEaFnEgI\u2013Dp XiaIn'AxgiNagS RnuaAHnIALWAADnANAkYXaXInAIgND\u2013aS WnhAjaiaNnGnXgugInAckaNhon ReuXnAgIiLaWnTogAnfXZgYabHinxaEii aN MLGNHoiZsuaUHnhntOaaByXinUnaEisa\u2013nH IXogIlu'iAnaXNni nRgycAahIFLnuWugayAnDaMYanbiaeg  c MhoeunLtnaHuign'seafnei CBhWaennugghfbueungNYHaiHxnuijanainngiygaunaYnaWJnigauSpnxHiigNnSyAgaihnnNatoGnngHghAaiI\nWanzhou (Wanxian) Jingmen ANHUI Changxing\nXIZANG CHONGQING\u2013C LhICeHnUgAdNu RAILWAY CHONGQING Lichua(nYangtze RiverY)ichang HWaunhkaonu HEFAEIn\u2013q JIiUngJIANG RAILWAY HNainnggbzohou\nNeijiang ChongFquilningg Huaiyuan YICHANG\u2013 WANZHOU RAILWAY Jiujiang ZHEJIANG\nScenic Area\nNanchang\nYibin\nZhongdDiaAnLI\u2013 LIJIANG RAILWACYhang  Jiang CHONGQING\u2013 GUIYANG RAILWAYLouCdhiangsha SanjiaXnigacnhgetanngg Yingtan Yiyang Wenzhou\nLijiang GUIZHOU\u2013 SHUIBAI RAILWAY GUIZHOU Huaihua HUNAZhNuzhou Ji'an JIANGXI FUJIAN\nLanping\nDukuo Liupanshui Henyang Nanping 25 o 00'N\nFuzhou\nZhanyi BaiguGouiyang Guiding Ganzhou GANZHOU\u2013 LONGYAN RAILWAY\nHongguo Pingzha\n25B oa 0o0s'Nhan Dali Chuxiong KunmiQnugjing Weishe LuochenGguilin Dingnan Longyan Xiamen\nRuili YUNNAN Yiliang Hechi GUANGXI Meizhou Zhangzhou\nSancha Longchuan\nLincang Liuzhou GUANGDONG\nKaiyuan Heshan Laibin Chaozhou\nShiping Guangzhou\nMohei Litang Sanshui Shantou\nNANNING\u2013 KUNMING RAILWAY Nanning Yunfu YaCoghuangping Shenzhen GUANG\u2013 MEI\u2013 S HANR AILWAY\nJinghong Ping XiangFangQchineznhgou Hepu Hechun ZMhauMchaaAuiCAU SKAHoROwNloGo nKONG SAR\nMYANMAR VIET NAM Beihai Zhakou Maoming National Capital\nLAO PEOPLE'S Zhanjiang YAOGU\u2013 MAOMING RAILWAY Provincial Capital\nDEMOCRATIC\nREPUBLIC GTounlfk  ionf Yangpu Santang CExitiys/tTinogw Rnailway\nHaikou\nNada Planned Railway\nChahe\nShilu Planned ADB Financed Railway\nBasou HAINAN\nADB Financed Railway Projects\nSanya\nN Completed\nUnder Construction\nProposed Project Railway\nSouth   China   Sea\n0 50 100150200250 River\nProvincial Boundary\nKilometers International Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n100 o 00'E 120 o 00'E\n08-1314 HR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Lanzhou\u2013Chongqing  Railway  (LCR) \nDevelopment Project. The report also describes proposed administration of technical assistance \n(TA) for preparing the Railway Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \nThe design and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  From 1978, when market-oriented economic reforms were introduced in the PRC, to \n2007, the country went through sustained rapid economic growth, and a resulting rapid increase \nin demand for transportation. Passenger transport grew by 9% yearly and freight transport by \n7.6%. Railways are the principal mode of freight transport in the PRC, with 47.5% of total freight \nton-kilometers (ton-km) in 2006, followed by 27.9% for inland waterways and sea-to-shore \nshipping, 21.1% for roads, 3.3% for pipelines, and 0.2% for civil aviation. In 2006, road traffic \naccounted for 52.8% of total passenger-kilometers (pass-km), followed by railways with 34.5%, \ncivil aviation with 12.3%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.4%. \n \n3.  The railway is the primary mode of long-distance and bulk transport. At the end of 2007, \nthe PRC\u2019s 78,000 route-kilometers (route-km) of railways comprised 63,600 km of national \nrailways and 14,400 km of joint-venture and local railways. The Ministry of Railways (MOR) runs \nthe state-owned national railway as an integrated system. The joint-venture and local railways, \nregional  lines  within  provincial  boundaries,  are  built  under  provincial  government  or  MOR \nsponsorship to serve local needs and interconnect with the national railway network. Despite its \nlarge size, however, the railway network does not provide adequate coverage for the country\u2019s \npopulation and land area.1  \n \n4.  PRC railways have the highest freight transport density in the world and second-highest \npassenger transport density after Japan. Locomotive turnover is the highest in the world. From \n1978 to 2007, railway freight increased from 535 billion ton-km to 2,380 billion ton-km, or by \n5.28%  yearly,  and  passenger  traffic  grew  by  6.74%  yearly,  from  109 billion  pass-km  to \n722 billion pass-km. For passenger trips, the average railway journey increased from 134 km in \n1978 to 532 km in 2007, compared with road travel, which grew from 35 km to 55 km over the \nsame period. For freight, the average railway journey in 2007 was 757 km, compared with \n65 km for road transport. Yet, despite such growth rates, railway capacity has lagged behind \ndemand  because  of  system  constraints.  Given  the  railways\u2019  important  role  in  economic \ntransportation, these constraints, if not removed, will continue to hamper efficient economic \ngrowth. The Government\u2019s aggressive plan to improve railways includes network expansion and \nconstruction in underserved areas. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Network density per 1,000 square km of land is one-third that of India and one-tenth that of Japan. \n ", "2 \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Government Strategy  \n \n5.  The Government\u2019s railway development policy puts emphasis on (i) removing constraints \nand expanding the system, (ii) encouraging the construction of joint-venture and local railways \nto promote the development of local economies, (iii) improving the efficiency and safety of the \nexisting  system  by  using  new  technology  and  modern  management  tools  in  planning  and \noperation, (iv) reducing operating subsidies through appropriate pricing and commercialization \nof  services,  (v)  initiating  institutional  and  structural  reforms  to  increase  autonomy  and \naccountability, and (vi) encouraging nongovernment investment in infrastructure and related \nservices.  \n \n6.  In 2004, the State Council approved a railway development plan for the period up to \n2020. The plan seeks to expand the railway network to 100,000 km by 2020. Increasing train \nspeed is a major goal. Priority will be given to the development of railways in unserved areas \nand regions that lack transport and have remained less developed. Route network length in the \nwestern region of the PRC will increase by 16,000 km, to 40,000 km, by 2020. To improve \noperating efficiency, MOR has begun to separate passenger and freight trains on key rail \ncorridors.2  \n \n7.  The 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) highlights railway development and accelerated \nrailway construction. It foresees (i) the construction of 17,000 km of new lines, for a total \nnetwork length of 92,000 route-km; and (ii) the conversion of 45% of the network length into \ndouble-track  electrified  railway.  The  plan  seeks  to  (i)  build  a  dedicated  passenger  railway \nnetwork through the construction of 7,000 km of passenger-dedicated lines by 2010; (ii) develop \ncoal transport corridors by increasing the capacity of the existing lines; (iii) expand the railway \nnetwork in the poor western region (to 34,000 km); (iv) build international corridors at the \nsouthwest and northwest borders; and (v) develop a nationwide intermodal container network. A \ntotal investment of CNY1.5 trillion (about $200 billion)\u2014CNY1.25 trillion for construction and \nCNY250 billion for rolling stock\u2014is planned in the 11th Five-Year Plan, of which a total of CNY \n465.2 billion has been spent in 2006 and 2007 (Appendix 3). \n \n2.  Asian Development Bank Strategy and Sector Experience \n \n8.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy for the railway sector is centered on \nhelping (i) expand the railway system by constructing new lines in unserved, less-developed \nareas; (ii) modernize railways and increase safety and capacity, to improve efficiency on key \nroutes; (iii) commercialize railway operations to sustain efficient operations; (iv) promote energy \nconservation and environmental sustainability; and (v) increase railway competitiveness in the \ntransport sector through restructuring and reform. ADB, the lead development partner in the \nPRC  railway  sector,  has  directed  its  energies  to  the  development  of  railways  in  poor, \nless-developed inland provinces to promote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty.3 \nADB  has  provided  15  loans  totaling  over  $3.0  billion  to  finance  the  construction  of  about \n1,921 km of eight provincial railways operated by joint ventures with MOR, 5,541 km of new \n                                                 \n2  ADB is financing the first passenger-dedicated corridor under ADB. 2005.

The report concluded that completed railway projects supported general economic growth in the \nregion and led to small areas of high economic growth in towns served by railway stations. \n ", "3 \nrailway lines under the six national railway projects, and a sector-wide intervention to improve \nsafety on the PRC railway network. ADB assistance to the sector has evolved from financing \ncivil works on local railways to supporting major national corridors with much less financing but \nwith  safety,  management  information  system,  environmental,  and  other  technological \nimprovements.  The  Project,  designed  to  promote  economic  growth  by  providing  railway \ntransportation  in  unserved,  less-developed,  and  poor  areas  of  Chongqing  municipality  and \nGansu, Shaanxi, and Sichuan provinces, is consistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities \nand the ADB strategy. \n \n3.  Policy Dialogue  \n \n9.  Policy dialogue has been a feature of ADB assistance to the railway sector and has \neffectively complemented the lending operations. Since 2002, ADB has actively engaged MOR, \nthe  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  in  policy \ndialogue and discussion and has reached broad agreement on reforms as an engine for the \nfurther development of the railways. The railway development plan defines the major goals for \nthe  PRC  railways  to  2020,  and  generally  conforms  with  ADB\u2019s  strategic  agenda.  MOR\u2019s \nproposed  reform  agenda  under  this  plan  involves  (i)  studying  and  learning  from  the  best \ninternational practices, (ii) separating core operations from noncore transportation businesses, \n(iii) streamlining  the  staff,  (iv)  reforming  the  railway  investment  and  financing  system,  and \n(v) establishing specialized transportation companies.  \n \n10.  MOR  has  taken  a  structured  approach  to  railway  reform.  In  1999,  under  a  new \nmanagement concept\u2014the asset operating liability system\u2014MOR entered into management \ncontracts with some railway administrations to improve profitability (as a pilot project). The \ncontracts helped improve operating and financial performance; the approach was later extended \nto all the railway administrations. The separation of core and noncore businesses is a key \nelement  of  MOR\u2019s  restructuring  program.  The  total  number  of  employees  in  the  core \ntransportation business was reduced from 1.89 million in 1997 to 1.41 million in 2006. In the \nnoncore  transportation business,  five  large  companies  employing  616,500  staff  have  been \ndivested. To provide jobs for redundant staff, by the end of 2006, MOR had set up 3,625 \ndiversified businesses (independent of the core transportation business) employing 321,544 \nstaff to supply equipment, goods, and services to the railway industry. In 1998, MOR began a \ncost-sharing scheme for health insurance and pensions for railway employees. In 2005, MOR \ncompleted the transfer of 822 primary and middle schools, 46 vocational schools, and 181 \nnursery schools, as well as 260 hospitals and medical units, to local governments. One hundred \nbranch lines totaling 7,800 km were separated to improve productivity and reduce operating \nlosses. (The reform agenda matrix is in Appendix 4. Supplementary Appendix A includes a \nchronology of railway reforms.) \n \n11.  ADB  policy  dialogue  with  MOR  deals  primarily  with  (i)  poverty  reduction  as  the \noverarching  objective  of  ADB  operations,  (ii)  energy  conservation  and  environmental \nsustainability,  (iii) safety  improvements,  (iv)  sector  reforms,  (v)  marketing  and  business \ndevelopment,  and  (vi) private  sector  participation  and  nongovernment  financing.  Fourteen \ntechnical assistance (TA) grants totaling $6.6 million have been provided since 1989 for the \ndevelopment of the emergency management system on the PRC railway network, institutional \ndevelopment of dedicated passenger lines and local railways, tariff and organizational studies \nfor the Jing\u2013Jiu railway, enhancement of commercial and business operations, marketing and \nbusiness  development,  human  resource  development,  and  improvement  of  financial \nmanagement and accounting systems (Appendix 5). ADB, as the lead development partner, \ncontinues to emphasize further progress in those areas and coordinates closely with other \n ", "4 \ndevelopment partners such as the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), Kreditanstalt \nf\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, and the World Bank. In recent years, ADB policy dialogue has emphasized \nenhanced safety, environmental sustainability, and energy conservation.  \n \na.  Poverty Reduction \n \n12.  The  strategic  purpose  of  ADB  involvement  in  the  railway  sector  is  to  create  the \nconditions  for  sustainable  economic  growth  that  would  help  improve  living  standards.  The \nProject,  located  in  an  unserved  area,  would  spur  economic  growth  through  improved, \ncost-effective transport access. Identifying ways of intensifying the impact on poverty reduction \nis an integral part of project planning and design. To this end, there are provisions for (i) the \npreferential hiring of poor workers, including women, for the construction and operation of the \nLCR;4 (ii) the use of locally produced materials that meet the requirements of quality and \neconomy (e.g., sand, stone, cement); (iii) railway station area development; (iv) the building of \nstation access roads and construction access roads; and (v) support for the poverty reduction \nprograms of local governments.5 The Project will finance the construction of access roads to be \nhanded over to the local government after they are built. Local governments have a 5-year plan \nfor improving the road network and transport services in the project area while the Project is in \nprogress. These roads will reach all of the province-designated poverty villages. The Project \nand the development of local roads will increase the welfare gains for the poor, including women, \nand help spread the project benefits to the poverty villages. \n \nb.  Energy Conservation and Environmental Sustainability \n \n13.  Energy conservation and environmental sustainability have been important elements of \nthe ADB policy dialogue with MOR since 2006, and are also identified as the two important \nareas of sustainable development in the 11th Five-Year Plan of the Government. ADB dialogue \nis helping to create awareness of these two issues and of factors like energy savings and \nenvironmental improvements in the performance evaluation of railway administrations and other \nentities. The dialogue encourages the use of clean energy and energy-efficient technologies \nand environmental improvements in railway construction, operation, and maintenance. ADB will \nassist MOR in drawing up a strategy for making the PRC railways more energy-efficient.6 \nFuel-efficient locomotives, double-stack container trains, \u201cgreen corridors,\u201d environment-friendly \nstation  design  and  waste  disposal,  and  fuel-efficient,  environment-friendly  safety  and \nmaintenance equipment are part of the project design. This area has been of mutual interest to \nother development partners such as the AFD, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW), and the \nWorld Bank. Close coordination has been maintained with them. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  In the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway Project, the poor composed 41% of unskilled labor on average, and 64% at the \npeak of construction (ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a \nProposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway Project. Manila).  \n5  According to the reports on some completed projects, about 40% of the poor at appraisal\u201441% in the case of the \nHefei\u2013Jiujiang Railway Project\u2014were raised above the poverty line upon project completion (ADB. 1993. Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina for the Hefei\u2013Jiujiang Railway Project. Manila). \n6  An application under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility for a technical assistance under the Clean \nEnergy Fund for PRC: Preparing the Railway Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy was approved on 29 February \n2008. \n ", "5 \nc.  Safety Improvements \n \n14.  Safety  is  an  integral  part  of  providing  competitive,  high-quality,  and  reliable \ntransportation  for  people  and  goods.  As  PRC  railways  have  modernized,  introduced  new \nconcepts and technologies, and increased speeds, the safety needs have changed. The 11th \nFive-Year Plan of MOR recognizes this important aspect and seeks to attract foreign technology \nand know-how to meet these needs. ADB policy dialogue with MOR emphasizes the need for \nreforms  in  rail  network  operations,  including  safety  in  construction  and  in  operation  and \nmaintenance. MOR and ADB support the objective of safety and security on PRC railways \nthrough the introduction of modern technologies, policy development, legislation, monitoring and \nenforcement, and outreach activities (Appendix 6). Since 2003, investments in railway safety \nhave been part of ADB financing. ADB initiated dialogue on the need to adopt a sector-wide \napproach rather than a project-based approach to safety. A sector-wide approach is consistent \nwith the network approach to train operations in the PRC and helps provide economies of scale, \nand better management of emergencies, accidents, and preventive maintenance. MOR has \nadopted the sector-wide approach to safety, and its safety and transportation departments have \nworked closely with ADB to develop a comprehensive plan for the institutional, investment, and \ntraining needs for safety in PRC railways. ADB provided a TA of $500,000 for the development \nof an emergency management system for PRC railways.7 In 2007, ADB approved a $100 million \nloan for improving safety on the PRC railway network.8  \n \nd.  Sector Reforms \n \n15.  ADB is supporting the institutional reform of the railway sector to separate government \nand enterprise functions, giving full play to market forces and increasing the competitiveness of \nthe railways. ADB has actively pursued (i) the separation of the core transport business from the \nnoncore transport business, (ii) the segmentation of passenger and freight services, and (iii) the \nstrengthening of the recently corporatized  specialized transportation companies. As part of \nADB\u2019s policy dialogue with MOR, three large companies handling containers, special goods, \nand express parcel have been set up.9 The establishment of passenger-dedicated corridors with \na separate institutional structure is a key ADB intervention.10 With ADB assistance, institutional, \nmarketing,  business  development,  and  technical  standards  are  being  worked  out  for  such \ninitiatives and MOR officials are receiving capacity-building support.11  \n \n16.  The streamlining of transportation and non-transportation staff is also being pursued. On \n18  March  2005,  under  a  major  restructuring  exercise,  MOR  abolished  41 sub-railway \nadministration bureaus, thereby doing away with one tier of railway management. By the end of \n2007, the number of stations and sections had been reduced from 1,500 to 627. This move has \ntrimmed the staff by more than 22,000 and helped rationalize operations, improve productivity, \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2007.

Manila). \n11 ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Managing Railway Passenger Operations \nMore Efficiently. Manila. The TA is ongoing. \n ", "6 \nand  increase  efficiency.  Recent  ADB  support  for  reforms  in  operations  and  railway  safety \nincludes a sector-wide intervention for the introduction of an emergency management system, \nsafe  and  reliable  technology,  improved  speeds,  dedicated  passenger  and  freight  lines,  a \nmodern dispatch control system, and high-quality information systems on the PRC railway \nnetwork. The PRC\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization has intensified competition \namong the different modes of transport and the structure of transport demand is likely to \nchange.12 An ADB advisory TA for policy reform support to MOR13 analyzed (i) the conflicting \nroles of meeting social obligations and making profits, (ii) increasing modal competition, (iii) the \nimpact of fast urbanization and economic development, and (iv) demand for better services. As \na lead development partner in the sector, ADB maintains close coordination with AFD, KfW, and \nthe World Bank; and has developed with these institutions a common approach to reforms and \nassistance (Appendix 3).  \n \ne.  Marketing and Business Development \n \n17.  As the PRC progresses toward a market-driven economy, its railways need to compete \non  the  basis  of  price  and  service  quality  for  demand-based  transportation  services.  New \nmarketing and business development initiatives are needed for both freight and passenger \nservices to be competitive. In past projects, ADB has financed project-specific studies to create \nmarketing and business development opportunities, including the skills and knowledge needed \nfor market-oriented, profitable operations. ADB is supporting the development of marketing and \nbusiness strategies for dedicated passenger lines (footnote 11), 7,000 km of which will be \ncompleted by 2010. The first dedicated passenger line from Beijing to Tianjin started operation \nin August 2008 and has adopted recommendations of this TA. The Project will continue these \ninitiatives through a capacity development program for the project company. \n \nf.  Private Sector Participation  \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s policy dialogue encourages increased private sector participation in the railway \nsector. ADB is assisting MOR with a study to examine opportunities for diversified financing \nsources, increased private sector involvement, and public\u2013private partnerships in the PRC \nrailways sector. In 2005, MOR issued guidelines to facilitate investment and financing system \nreforms, which seek to lower the threshold of investment, encourage the private sector to invest, \nand  attract  strategic  investors  to  railway  financing.14 Strategic  and  private  investors15 are \nparticipating  in  the  project  equity  of  the  ADB-financed  Taiyuan\u2013Zhongwei  Railway  Project \n(2006).  The  initial  public  offering  for  the  Daqin  Railway  Company  (CNY15 billion)  and  the \nGuangshen Railway Company16  (CNY10 billion) in 2006 was heavily oversubscribed. In 2007, \nthe China Railway Tielong Container Logistics Company made an additional public offering of \n80 million shares for CNY700 million. \n \n19.  Under the Project, the Gansu and Sichuan provinces are exploring the possibility of \ndiversifying financing sources to include strategic and private investors. A corporate entity has \n                                                 \n12 Since  the  freight  transport  market  was  opened  up  to  foreign  companies  under  World  Trade  Organization \ncommitments, three joint-venture companies with foreign participation have entered the market.  \n13 ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Railway Passenger and Freight Policy \nReform Study. Manila. MOR is implementing the TA recommendations.  \n14 The China National Oil Petroleum Company is providing CNY1.7 billion in financing for the Beijing\u2013Tianjin intercity \nrailway line, which began construction in July 2005. \n15 China Communication Construction Engineering Group, Beijing; China Engineering Construction Group, Beijing; \nand Shaanxi Province Hualong Energy Limited Liability Company, Xi\u2019an. \n16 The Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen joint-venture railway company is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the \nNew York Stock Exchange. \n ", "7 \nbeen set up to assist in the construction, operate, and manage the Project. Activities such as \nconsulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  testing,  construction  contracts,  track \nmaintenance,  commercial  activities,  industrial  sidings,  loading  and  unloading,  and  other \nlogistical facilities will be outsourced through open competition, and private sector involvement \nwill be encouraged in the development of station facilities, local tourism, and real estate. Extra-\nlarge container terminals at Urumqi and Lanzhou and container freight stations at Guangyuan \nand Longnan will be established to facilitate the participation of shipping lines and freight \nforwarders in the business of rail-transported containers. All of these actions will create more \nopportunities for private sector participation. \n \n4.  Lessons  \n \n20.  The report on the evaluation of ADB assistance to the transport sector in the PRC17 \npronounced ADB\u2019s program for railways a success. The report noted that ADB\u2019s strategic \npriorities in the railway subsector were well aligned with the country\u2019s needs. Its overall focus on \nbuilding railways with modern technologies met the need to increase railway capacity and \nreduce the persistent gap between supply and demand as quickly and efficiently as possible. \nThe priority given by ADB to improving efficiency and commercial orientation and its emphasis \non policy restructuring and reform matched the evolving institutional reforms in railways. \n \n21.  Completed and ongoing ADB-financed railway projects in the PRC show the executing \nagencies\u2019 strong commitment and generally satisfactory capabilities for project implementation \n(Appendix 7). The speed of implementation has generally exceeded expectations at appraisal, \nand agencies have generally complied with loan covenants. Resettlement and environmental \nmanagement have been satisfactory. Audit covenants have been complied with in a timely \nmanner,  and  the  audited  financial  statements  have  been  generally  acceptable.  Of  the  15 \nADB-supported railway projects, 10 have been completed, and 5 are being implemented. \n \n22.  The completed railway projects highlight the need to (i) ensure that the executing agency \nestablished  for  project  processing,  implementation,  and  operation  has  adequate  capacity; \n(ii) prepare realistic traffic forecasts; (iii) review network-wide constraints on traffic and the \nimpact on project viability of existing and planned railway lines and other transportation modes \nthat may compete with project facilities; (iv) make realistic resettlement projections at appraisal; \nand (v) finance railway projects with appropriately determined debt\u2013equity ratios.  \n \n23.  Previous  railway  projects  have  contributed  to  socioeconomic  development  in  their \ninfluence areas. Their main impact is as follows: (i) new railway lines in less-developed regions \nhave stimulated economic development, resulting in higher growth in gross domestic product \n(GDP) and rural incomes than under the \u201cwithout-project\u201d scenario;18 (ii) construction activities \nhave created demand for unskilled labor and employment of poor workers, including women, \nwho would otherwise have remained unemployed or underemployed;19 (iii) service roads built \nfor  construction  activities  have  opened  up  and  benefited  rural  communities  in  previously \ninaccessible  areas;  (iv)  domestic  resource  mobilization  has  improved,  providing  additional \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2007. Sector Assistance Program Evaluation of the Asian Development Bank Assistance for Roads and \nRailways in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. \n18 In  the  project  area  of  the  Jing\u2013Jiu  Railway,  the  GDP  of  10  counties  in  Jiangxi  province  increased  from \nCNY4.9 billion in 1993 to CNY15.4 billion in 1998, or by 25.5% yearly, compared with 10.2% for the province as a \nwhole. Rural income per capita in Xinfeng county increased from CNY802 in 1993 to CNY2,222 in 1998, or by \n18.5% yearly, compared with 10.3% in 1985\u20131992 (before the project). \n19 The first 2 years of construction of the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway generated about 7.5 million person-days of \nemployment. Of this total, 4.1 million person-days, or about 55%, were set aside for local poor people, who were \nthus raised above the poverty line. \n ", "8 \nresources  for  social  programs20 and  generating  employment;  (v)  employment  has  been \ngenerated  as  well  by  the  supply  and  transportation  of  local  materials;  (vi)  improved  and \nlower-cost transport (a) has lowered the prices of agricultural inputs (such as fertilizers) and \nthus stimulated cash-crop farming and provided more income to farmers, and (b) has increased \nthe  mobility  of  rural  residents  and  allowed  them  access  to  more  markets,  employment \nopportunities, and social services beyond their immediate communities; (vii) counties with new \nrailway access have recorded higher GDP growth rates than other counties; (viii) the investment \nclimate has improved, resulting in the rapid development of secondary and tertiary industries \nthat have generated employment;21 (ix) the consequent shift in the structure of employment from \nlow-productivity  agriculture  to  higher-productivity  agro-processing  and  light  industry  has \nincreased employment opportunities for women and improved their incomes and social status;22 \n(x) tourism has developed because of more affordable and convenient railway travel; and \n(xi) environmental protection and mitigation measures have been taken under the projects as \nagreed  at  appraisal,  and  the  environmental  impact  of  induced  developments  has  been \naddressed according to the environmental impact assessments (EIAs) for the projects. The \nrailway projects have helped transform the local economies: per capita rural incomes have \nincreased substantially, living standards have improved, and poverty has been reduced. The \nlessons learned and experiences gained are incorporated in the design of the current project.  \n \n5.  Rationale \n \n24.  The  Project  will  (i)  enhance  capacity  and  reduce  the  bottlenecks  through  network \ndevelopment; (ii) improve energy efficiency and environmental sustainability by providing a \nmore efficient and environment-friendly mode of transport in the corridor; (iii)  improve safety by \nproviding a reliable and safe mode of transport; (iv) support the PRC railway development plan \nand the western region development strategy; and (v) promote pro-poor economic growth along \nthe  railway  line  and  in  the  region,  thereby  reducing  poverty.  The  project  area  is  largely \nmountainous with abundant natural reserves of coal and other nonferrous materials, and a large \nmanufacturing industry and tourist sites. But, despite the abundant natural resources, many \nliving in the area are poor. Because of inadequate transport services and high costs, the \neconomic growth needed to reduce rural poverty has not materialized. Local governments and \npeople living in the project area see the railway as a key investment for addressing this problem. \n \n25.  The Project is part of the shortest north\u2013south corridor linking Lanzhou, Baoji, Yinchuan, \nXining, Xinjiang, and other major cities in the north to Chongqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, Kunming, \nand other ports and cities in the south. The proposed alignment is shorter by 295 km and \n600 km than the two existing routes between Lanzhou and Chongqing. Traversing Gansu, \nShaanxi, and Sichuan provinces and Chongqing municipality, the proposed railway line will \nconnect with Baotou\u2013Yinchuan\u2013Lanzhou in the northeast; Urumqi\u2013Lanzhou in the northwest on \nits way to  Kazakhstan and Europe; Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Ankang in the east, at Guangyuan; \nShanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Yichang\u2013Daxian\u2013Chengdu  in  the  center;  Yichang\u2013Lichuan\u2013Chongqing, \nChongqing\u2013Guiyang,  and  Chongqing\u2013Kunming  in  the  south  on  its  way  to  Viet  Nam,  Lao \n                                                 \n20 The financial revenue of 10 poverty counties in Jiangxi province that are traversed by the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway \nincreased from CNY0.5 billion in 1993 to CNY1.4 billion in 1998, or by 22.7% yearly, compared with 12.3% in \n1985\u20131992, before the construction of the railway. \n21 The Jing\u2013Jiu Railway facilitated the setting up of many resource- and agriculture-based industries in Xingfeng \ncounty of Jiangxi province, from 3 in 1992 to 39 in 1998, after project completion. The number of businesses grew \nfrom 8,005 in 1992 to 19,287 in 1998, and the number of persons employed in these businesses increased from \n18,484 in 1992 to 52,153 in 1998, or by 23% yearly. In the same county, the number of people living below the \npoverty line was reduced by 62%, from 30,400 in 1993 to 11,580 in 1998. \n22 Beneficial income and social impact, particularly on women, was noted in the influence areas of the Yaogu\u2013\nMaoming Railway and the Guang\u2013Mei\u2013Shan Railway. \n ", "9 \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Southeast Asia; and the main lines Xi\u2019an\u2013Chongqing in the \nnorth, Chongqing\u2013Chengdu in the west, and Chongqing\u2013Kunming in the south. The Project will \nalso help promote regional cooperation, as Urumqi\u2013Lanzhou\u2013Chongqing\u2013Kunming will be the \nshortest north\u2013south corridor linking the Greater Mekong Subregion to Central Asia and Europe \nthrough  the  PRC,  which  will  generate  a  significantly  larger  volume  of  trade  in goods  and \nservices. Chongqing is a major manufacturing center for automobiles, motorcycles, chemicals, \nelectrical items, and exports to the Greater Mekong Subregion. With the development of the \nproposed railway, the Chongqing manufacturers intend to promote sales in Central Asia where \nincomes are beginning to rise and the demand for PRC exports is increasing (Supplementary \nAppendix D). \n \n26.  The  Project  and  associated  developments  are  expected  to  stimulate  industrial  and \nnatural  resources  development,  tourism,  and  related  industries,  increase  mobility  and \ninformation exchange, generate employment, raise living standards, and help reduce poverty. \nThe Project is part of the Government\u2019s program to integrate the development of transportation \nfacilities, upgrade highways, and construct links and access roads to the hinterland. Other \ninfrastructure,  such  as  water  supply  and  investment  to improve  education and  health-care \nfacilities, are also planned. The railway will play an important role in facilitating the development \nof this poor and underdeveloped region in the PRC and integrating it with the rest of the country \nand with neighboring countries.  \n \n27.  The  Project  will  be  a  joint-venture  railway  owned  and  operated  by  MOR  and  the \ngovernments  of  Gansu,  Sichuan,  and  Chongqing.  An  aggressive  plan  to  develop  the \njoint-venture  railways  has  been  adopted  and  MOR  signed  a  cooperation  agreement  with \n31 provinces and municipalities in 2003 for the development of the railways. By the end of 2007, \n40 joint-venture  railways  had  been  formed  and  investments  totaled  CNY960 billion. \nJoint-venture railways, which account for 9,517 km (2007) of the PRC system, have substantial \nmanagerial and financial autonomy, including the freedom to set tariffs, which are several times \nhigher than those on the national network. Freight and passenger traffic have grown faster on \njoint-venture railways than on national railways. From 1996 to 2007, passenger traffic grew from \n2.2 billion pass-km to 31.5 billion, or by 28% yearly (versus 6.8% on the national railway \nnetwork), and freight traffic rose from 12.3 billion ton-km to 155.2 billion ton-km, or by 26.5% \nyearly (versus 4.9% on the national railway network). Joint-venture railways are more efficient, \nemploying only 8\u201310 people per km, compared with about 25 people per km for national \nrailways. The project company will employ 8\u201310 people per km. \n \n28.  The Project is a key intervention in the railway sector, with many technical, operational, \nsafety, environmental, economic, and financial benefits. A corporate entity has been set up to \nconstruct,  operate,  and  manage  the  Project,  which  will  promote  its  financial  viability  and \ncorporate governance and stimulate participation from strategic and private investors. ADB \nfinancing, for its part, has stimulated cofinancing from two of the largest commercial banks of \nthe PRC. ADB is assisting with institutional, marketing, and business development for the \nproject company. The agreed tariffs are more affordable than those for road transport and are \nfinancially viable. The Project will bring in new technology such as modern dispatch control \nsystems and high-quality information systems, and pursue improvements in operations like \nhigher speeds and greater safety on the railway network. When complete, the Project will \nprovide a shorter link from northwest to southwest PRC, release capacity on the existing railway \nlines, and provide an efficient, high-quality, safe, reliable, and environmentally friendly mode of \ntransport in the region.  \n \n ", "10 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n29.  The  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  an  improved  transport  system  in  the  region  that \nsupports socioeconomic development and the western development strategy. It will achieve this \nby  providing  efficient,  affordable,  environment-friendly,  and  energy-efficient  railway \ntransportation in unserved, less-developed areas to create the conditions needed to develop \nlocal resources and generate employment and income-enhancing opportunities.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n30.  The  Project  comprises  (i)  the  construction  of  820  km  of  double-track  electrified \nstandard-gauge class I railway from Lanzhou to Chongqing; (ii) the construction of 31 new \nrailway stations complete with facilities; (iii) the provision of modern technology and equipment, \namong  other  safety  initiatives;  (iv)  the  introduction  of  a  signaling,  communication,  and \nmanagement information system; (v) the provision of training in the use and maintenance of the \nmodern equipment; (vi) land acquisition and resettlement; (vii) environmental protection and \nmitigation  of  adverse  environmental  effects;  (viii)  consulting  services  for  construction \nsupervision, monitoring and evaluation, and marketing and business development; and (ix) the \nstrengthening of institutional capabilities. Civil works, equipment, consultants, and MOR and \nproject company staff are the key inputs needed for project implementation.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n31.  Adding Value. Catalyzing financing, setting up an institutional structure, and moving \nahead on reforms are the key value additions of ADB participation. Given the huge investment \nneeds of the Project, ADB has encouraged MOR to tap diverse financing sources. A financing \narrangement of 50% in equity and 50% in long-term loans has been worked out. The three \nprovinces (Gansu, Sichuan, and Chongqing municipality) are contributing 45% of the equity, a \nsignificant contribution. Encouraged by ADB to explore diverse financing sources for their equity \ncontribution, Gansu and Sichuan provinces have set up province-level investment companies \nand are exploring the possibility of participation by strategic and private investors. Two domestic \ncommercial banks\u2014the China Construction Bank (CCB) and the Industrial and Commercial \nBank of China (ICBC)\u2014have already committed cofinancing of $4 billion. Setting up a project \ncompany and proposing specific measures under the Project to outsource some of the activities \nhandled by railways and involve the private sector are other key steps. ADB has engaged MOR \nin dialogue aimed at enhancing policy reform during project processing, and this will continue. \nMOR will also continue to separate the core and noncore activities and streamline its staff. The \nProject will bring in new technology, emphasize safety, and build MOR capacity.  \n \n32.  Enhancing  Energy  Efficiency.  Railways  as  a  mode  of  transport  are  a  more \nenergy-efficient and environmentally friendly mode of transport. A steel wheel on rail meets \nmuch less rolling resistance than rubber tires on pavement. Some theoretical estimates indicate \nthat rail transport is 6\u201310 times more energy-efficient than road transport. In the United States, \nthe Department of Energy has estimated the energy intensity of rail freight at 345 British thermal \nunits per ton-mile, and road freight at 3,476 British thermal units per ton-mile. 23 This indicates \nthat rail is about 10 times as energy-efficient as truck transport\u2014similar to the estimate made by \n                                                 \n23 US Department of Energy. 2004. Transportation Energy Data Book, Edition 24. Oak Ridge, Tennessee: Oak Ridge \nNational Laboratory. \n ", "11 \nCanadian researchers.24 The Project is classified as a clean energy project. According to the \nInternational Energy Agency report25 and fuel data from the China Statistical Yearbook 2006,26 \nthe diverted traffic from road to rail, and from existing rail to LCR will result in a yearly benefit \n(from the reduction in fuel consumption) of CNY616 million in 2015, increasing to CNY1.91 \nbillion in 2034 (for a cumulative total of CNY24.3 billion for 2015\u20132034). \n \n33.  Promoting  Environmental  Sustainability.  There  is  a  direct  relationship  between \nenergy consumption and emission of harmful pollutants, and rail transport emits far fewer \nharmful elements than road transport. These emissions include carbon dioxide (CO ), nitrogen \n2\noxides, hydrocarbons, sulfur oxides, and suspended particles. Under the provisions of the Kyoto \nProtocol, a value can be placed on CO emissions. Specific fuel use and emission rates for the \n2 \nPRC indicate that the diversion of traffic from road to rail will reduce CO  emissions by 864,280 \n2\ntons in 2015, rising to 1.1 million tons in 2020 and 2.0 million tons in 2034 (for cumulative \nsavings of 27.7 million tons in 2015\u20132034), equivalent to a yearly economic benefit of CNY55 \nmillion in 2015, increasing to CNY128 million in 2034 (for a cumulative total of CNY1.75 billion \nfor  2015\u20132034).  The  Project  will  support  environmental  improvements,  including  the \ndevelopment of a green corridor along the proposed alignment. For the first time, ADB will \nfinance $11.56 million worth of environmental protection equipment. \n \n34.  Promoting Intermodal and Container Transport. The proposed railway will be the \nshortest north\u2013south railway link connecting the Greater Mekong Subregion countries with the \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation countries and Europe through the PRC, and will \nopen up a new and shorter economic corridor. The Project will promote railway and multimodal \ntransportation in the region by introducing double-stack container transport operation on an \nelectrified track, thereby reducing land use, increasing carrying capacity by 60% on the same \ntrack, improving energy and environment efficiency by 40%\u201360%, and allowing cargo to move \nmore  quickly,  safely,  and  efficiently.  MOR  will  build  two  extra-large  container  terminals  at \nLanzhou and Urumqi, and container handling facilities at Longnan and Guangyuan to (i) attract \nhigh-value traffic to the railways; (ii) promote intermodal traffic; and (iii) encourage private sector \nshippers and freight forwarders to use the facility to export cargo to and import cargo from other \nparts of the PRC, ports in the southern part of PRC, and Central Asia and Europe in the west. \nThese facilities will be financed by MOR and completed by 2014. \n \n35.  Improving  Safety.  ADB  policy  dialogue  has  emphasized  the  need  for  operational \nreforms in the rail network, including safety improvements through safe and reliable technology, \nmodern maintenance systems, and safety performance monitoring. A component of the Project \n(worth $36.11 million equivalent, of which $6.65 million will come from the ADB loan) will involve \nthe procurement of operation and maintenance equipment to increase safety and build capacity, \nthrough staff training and other activities. Given the large number of tunnels on the proposed \nrailway,  the  project  company  will  prepare  a  tunnel  safety  manual  to  guide  operation  and \nmaintenance. \n \n36.  Increasing Private Sector Participation and Strengthening Corporate Governance. \nThe project company will outsource through open competition such activities as consulting \nservices  for  construction  supervision,  testing,  construction  contracts,  track  maintenance, \nlogistics facilities, and industrial sidings. Private sector initiatives such as onboard train services, \n                                                 \n24 The Railway Association of Canada. 2001.

The ADB \npolicy  reform  agenda  in  the  railway  sector  emphasizes  the  restructuring  of  MOR,  the \ncommercialization of operations, support for the management autonomy of railway operations, \nhuman  resource  development,  and  financial  management  and  accounting  system \nimprovements. Setting up the joint-venture railways in the PRC is a key ADB intervention. Under \nthe Project, a corporate entity has been set up and its capacity development will be supported. \nADB-financed consulting services will assist in strengthening the institutional, marketing, and \nbusiness development functions of the project company. \n \n37.  Sustaining  Stakeholder  Consultation  and  Participation.  Extensive  consultations, \nincluding  surveys,  involved  about  14,500  people,  such  as  local  villagers,  tourists, \nbusinesspersons,  transport  users,  and  local  governments  (Appendix  8).  These  helped  in \n(i) understanding public opinion about the proposed railway; (ii) conducting the environmental, \neconomic, and social assessments; (iii) planning for resettlement; and (iv) identifying the role of \nvarious stakeholders. Leading groups have been formed in the prefectures with the participation \nof relevant government agencies, including poverty reduction offices, the All-China Women\u2019s \nFederation, and health, civil affairs, and ethnic affairs bureaus. The local governments have \ngiven their assurances that the consultations will continue, to finalize the design and implement \nsocial and environmental measures. \n \n38.  Undertaking Complementary Development Initiatives. To heighten the development \nimpact in the project area, the local governments have agreed to provide road access, good \ndrinking water, and telephone connectivity to all the poverty villages along the alignment. The \nvarious provincial and local governments have agreed to include these initiatives in their 11th \nfive-year plans. They have agreed in principle to provide electricity to 169 villages, road access \nto 954 villages, drinking water to 1,873 villages, and telephone connections to 696 villages by \nthe end of 2014. The local governments have also agreed to reallocate part of the tax revenue \nto relevant agencies to undertake development programs in the project area.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n39.  The project investment cost is estimated at the equivalent of $8,608.9 million. Table 1 \nsummarizes the project investment plan; details are in Appendix 9. The cost estimates are \nbased  on  quantities  derived  from  preliminary  engineering  designs  and  unit  rates  reflecting \nmarket  prices  for  goods  and  materials,27 and  include  the  costs  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, and environmental monitoring.  \n \n                                                 \n27 Because of the high proportion of bridges and tunnels, the average cost per km for civil works is higher than that \nfor other railway projects in the PRC. \n ", "13 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Financing Plan \n \n40.  The Government has requested a loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a term of 27 years, including a grace \nperiod of 7 years, an interest rate determined according to ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% yearly, conversion options that \nmay be exercised according to ADB\u2019s loan regulations and conversion guidelines, and other \nterms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. The Government has provided ADB with \n(i) reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made because of any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n41.  ADB will finance all of the contract packages to be procured under the ADB loan; CCB, \nICBC, and MOR will finance the rest of the foreign exchange cost. The local currency cost will \nbe financed by MOR and the provinces, and cofinanced through a loan from CCB and ICBC. \nCCB and ICBC have appraised the Project and submitted their commitment letters to MOR. The \nCCB loan is repayable over 20 years, including a grace period, at a lending rate currently set at \n6.6% yearly. The ICBC loan is repayable over 25 years, including a grace period, at a lending \nrate  of  7.13%  currently.  MOR  will  finance  55%  of  the  equity,  and  the  Gansu  provincial \ngovernment (GPG), the Sichuan provincial government (SPG), and the Chongqing municipal \ngovernment  (CMG)  will  finance  45%  of  the  equity,  including  the  land  acquisition  and \n ", "14 \nresettlement  costs.  MOR,  GPG,  SPG,  and  CMG  have  made  budgetary  provisions  for  the \ncounterpart funds. The allocation of loan proceeds in the Loan Agreement will be presented with \nreference only to total expenditure, according to the ADB policy document Cost Sharing and \nEligibility  of  Expenditures  for  Asian  Development  Bank  Financing.28 The  financing  plan  is \nsummarized in Table 2 and presented in detail in Appendix 9. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Amount   % \nAsian Development Bank   300.0  3.5 \nMOR and GPG, SPG, and CMG  4,304.5  50.0 \nCCB and ICBC  4,004.4  46.5 \nTotal  8,608.9  100.0 \nCCB = China Construction Bank, CMG = Chongqing municipal government, \nGPG = Gansu provincial government, ICBC = Industrial and Commercial Bank of \nChina, MOR = Ministry of Railways, SPG = Sichuan provincial government.  \nNote: Because of rounding, the figures may not add up to the totals given. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n42.  MOR will be the Executing Agency, responsible for overall project implementation. The \nForeign Capital and Technical Import Center (FCTIC), under MOR, will coordinate the tasks of \nthe project management office and be responsible for procurement, withdrawals, and reporting \nto ADB. A project company (a limited-liability company under the PRC Company Law), with \nheadquarters at Lanzhou has been set up,29 which will be the Implementing Agency for the \nProject. The project company will (i) assist in the construction of the project railway and manage \nand operate the project railway after its construction; and (ii) develop and implement adequate \nand transparent business development mechanisms, and accounting and reporting systems. \nThe project company is headed by a director general and assisted by an adequate number of \nsuitably  qualified  professional  staff  with  experience  in  railway  engineering,  financial,  and \nadministrative matters, and in the implementation of projects financed by international financial \ninstitutions. The company has set up on-site construction management offices along the project \nroute. To develop the project management, business development, and marketing capacity of \nthe project company, assistance will be provided through project-financed consulting services.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n43.  The Project will be implemented over about 7 years. The construction will be completed \nin about 6 years (December 2014). Trial operations will start in January 2015 and last for 1 year \nbefore commercial operations begin (Appendix 10).  \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n44.  All  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). ADB will finance the procurement of materials and equipment as \ndescribed in the procurement plan (Appendix 11). Contracts valued at $1 million or more will be \n                                                 \n28 ADB. 2005.

MOR will select tendering companies on a \ncompetitive basis to handle international bidding. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all documents and contracts during the \nbidding for, and implementation of, the Project.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n45.  The Government will hire and finance the services of qualified national consultants for \n(i) detailed  project  design;  (ii)  preparation  of  technical  specifications;  (iii)  construction \nsupervision;  (iv) construction  quality  assurance;  (v)  environmental  supervision  and \nmanagement; (vi) monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement plan; and (vii) socioeconomic \nimpact assessment, evaluation of poverty reduction, and project performance monitoring. \n \n46.  The ADB loan will be used to finance 10 person-months of international consulting \nservices to strengthen the institutional, marketing, and business development functions of the \nproject company. Appendix 12 gives the terms of reference for the international consultants, who \nwill be recruited through quality- and cost-based selection (at an 80:20 ratio) based on simplified \ntechnical  proposals,  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). The provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy will be included in all \ninvitation documents and contracts for international consultants.  \n \n5.  Anticorruption Measures \n \n47.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy has been explained to, and discussed with, the Government. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves  the  right  to  investigate, directly  or  through  its agents,  any  allegations  of  corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project will specify the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MOR, \nthe project company, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey relate to the Project. \n \n48.  In relation to the Project, MOR will ensure that (i) a supervisory body is established to \nprevent undue interference in business practices, and adequate resources are made available \nfor  its  effective  operation;  (ii)  a  leading  group  of  officials  from  the  discipline  unit  and  the \nsupervision department of MOR is located in offices involved in the bidding, construction, and \nother operational activities under the Project; and (iii) periodic inspections of the contractor\u2019s \nactivities related to fund withdrawals and settlements are carried out. MOR and the project \ncompany will also initiate liaison meetings with the prosecutor\u2019s office as needed, to discuss \nwarnings about, or information on, corrupt practices. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n49.  The ADB loan will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Since most payments will be made for large contracts, \ndirect payment, reimbursements, and commitment procedures will be used. The Government \nwill be reimbursed, according to ADB\u2019s reimbursement procedure, for any eligible expenditure it \ninitially funds. To facilitate disbursements, MOR will set up an imprest account30 at a bank \n                                                 \n30 Imprest accounts are used in three ongoing loans in the PRC. The utilization performance is satisfactory. \n ", "16 \nacceptable to ADB after the loan becomes effective. The ceiling of the imprest account will be \neither the estimated expenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is \nless.  To  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  documentation,  the  statement-of-expenditure \nprocedure will be used in liquidating and replenishing the imprest account and reimbursing \neligible  expenditures  of  not  more  than  $200,000  per  payment.  Payments  over  the \nstatement-of-expenditure ceiling will be reimbursed, liquidated, or replenished on the basis of \nfull supporting documentation. The financial assessment questionnaire indicates that the Project \nwill have an adequate financial management system in place. Funds from the ADB loan will flow \ndirectly to MOR, the Executing Agency, which will be responsible for disbursements for the \ncontract packages financed by ADB (Supplementary Appendix C).  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n50.  MOR and the project company will maintain separate accounts for the Project and have \nthose  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited  annually  by  an  external  auditor \naccording to auditing standards acceptable to ADB. MOR and the project company, through \nMOR, will submit to ADB, within 6 months after each fiscal year, certified copies of the audited \nproject accounts and financial statements and auditor\u2019s reports, all in English. The audit of the \nfinancial statements will include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of the accounting and \ninternal control systems with respect to project expenditures and other financial transactions, (ii) \nan  assessment  of  compliance  with  loan  covenants  and  ADB  requirements  for  project \nmanagement, and (iii) a separate opinion on the use of the imprest account and statement-of-\nexpenditure  procedures.  The  project  company,  through  MOR,  will  also  submit  its  audited \nfinancial statements covering income statements, balance sheets, and cash-flow statements for \nthe first 3 years of commercial operations of the project railway within 6 months after each fiscal \nyear. To ensure that an effective internal control system and checks and balances are put in \nplace, the project company will establish an internal audit unit within the company. The unit will \nindependently test financial transactions to ensure the safe custody of the project-financed \nassets and report directly to the project company\u2019s board of directors. \n \n51.  The project company will make satisfactory arrangements for reporting the progress of \nproject implementation by submitting quarterly progress reports to ADB through MOR. Within \n3 months of project completion, MOR will submit a project completion report to ADB.  \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n52.  A set of indicators for evaluating project performance in relation to its impact, outcomes, \noutputs,  and  conditions  has  been  agreed  on  with  MOR  and  is  included  in  the  project \nperformance management system. The design and monitoring framework has been developed \nwith the use of the indicators from the project performance management system. The indicators, \nto be reviewed at the start of project implementation, include (i) economic development and \nsocioeconomic  indicators,  (ii)  transport  costs  and  time  for  passenger  and  freight  services, \n(iii) transport services and transport charges, (iv) accident rates, (v) financial sustainability, \n(vi) county  and  village  incomes,  (vii)  access  to  social  services,  and  (viii)  jobs  created  in \nconstruction and maintenance. At the start of project implementation, MOR and the project \ncompany will establish baseline and target values for the indicators. The indicators will be \nmeasured at project inception, completion, and 3 years later, and compared with the baseline \n(Appendix 13). MOR will recruit qualified consultants for monitoring and evaluation to help \nestablish the monitoring and evaluation system, and train the project company staff in its use. \nThe main sources of data include (i) secondary data from government sources, (ii) a household \n ", "17 \nsocioeconomic sample survey, and (iii) participatory rapid appraisal. MOR will submit a report to \nADB summarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, completion, and 3 years later. \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n53.  ADB,  MOR,  and  the  project  company  will  carry  out  a  yearly  review  of  the  Project \nincluding a midterm review in 2012, covering all institutional, administrative, organizational, \ntechnical, environmental, social, poverty reduction, resettlement, economic, financial, and other \nrelevant aspects that may have an impact on the performance of the Project and its continuing \nviability. The review will examine progress in sector reforms, policy development, resettlement, \nenvironment, poverty impact, and compliance with covenants in the Loan Agreement.  \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR PREPARING THE RAILWAY SECTOR \nENERGY EFFICIENCY STRATEGY \n \n54.  ADB has engaged MOR on the key issue of enhancing energy efficiency on the PRC \nrailways, also identified as a key area for action in the 11th Five-Year Plan of the Government, \nwhich has urged MOR to take actions to enhance energy efficiency on the railway system. MOR \nhas initiated some steps to achieve this reduction; however, the measures are local and not \ncoordinated. Discussions with MOR highlighted the need for a sector-wide strategy for dealing \nwith this important issue, which would include taking stock of current consumption patterns and \nenergy conservation measures, identifying the gaps, and recommending actions that can be \ntaken by MOR. MOR has therefore requested ADB for a TA grant assistance to assist MOR in \npreparing the railway sector energy efficiency strategy. Technical assistance amounting to the \nequivalent of $800,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Clean Energy Fund under the \nClean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  and  administered  by  ADB.31 The  study  will \n(i) analyze the energy efficiency of the PRC railway sector, (ii) identify areas where energy \nefficiency can be enhanced, and (iii) recommend actions and technologies that can be adopted. \nIt will help prioritize areas for enhancing energy efficiency and recommend a pipeline of priority \nlending  projects  for  energy  efficiency  in  the  PRC  railway  sector,  some  of  which  can  be \nsupported by ADB. The TA is outlined in Appendix 14. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \n55.  The project benefits and impact were assessed along with the potential risks associated \nwith the Project. The combined benefits and impact will outweigh the costs, and net benefits will \naccrue to the project area. \n \nA.  Traffic Forecast \n \n56.  The traffic forecast is based on forecasts prepared by the First Survey Design Institute \nand the Second Survey Design Institute, considering expected economic growth, population \nincrease, tourism development potential, local government development plans, market surveys, \nand the assessment of TA consultants. Passenger volume on the LCR is forecast to grow from \n10.70 billion pass-km in 2015 to 34.19 billion pass-km in 2034, or by an average of 6.3% yearly. \nOn the basis of similar factors, freight traffic on the LCR corridor is forecast to increase from \nabout 40.14 billion ton-km in 2015 to 88.58 billion ton-km in 2034, for an annual growth rate of \n4.25%.  The  projected  volumes  can  be  accommodated  by  the  LCR  and  justify  project \nconstruction (Appendix 15). \n                                                 \n31  Contributors: the governments of Australia and Norway. \n ", "18 \nB.  Economic Benefits \n \n57.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated through a comparison of the \nwith- and without-Project situations. The Project will reduce the cost of transport to and from the \npoor central and northwestern part of Gansu, Shaanxi, and Sichuan provinces and Chongqing \nmunicipality, and will provide economic opportunities in the unserved areas of Gansu and \nSichuan  provinces  (Supplementary  Appendix  D).  Economic  costs  include  construction, \noperation,  and  maintenance  costs,  and  the  value  of  agricultural  production  from  land  lost \npermanently. Economic benefits include (i) operating cost savings for freight and passenger \ntraffic,  (ii)  time  savings  in  diverted  passenger  traffic  from  buses,  (iii)  transport  benefits \ngenerated, (iv) tourism benefits, (v) shipper savings because of increased railway competition, \n(vi)  road  accidents  avoided,  (vii)  pollution  reduction  benefits,  (viii)  energy  savings,  and \n(ix) national productivity benefits. The project EIRR is 17.09%, indicating that the Project is \neconomically viable (Appendix 15). Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the Project\u2019s \neconomic viability. Changes in the key variables, such as a 20% reduction in benefits, do not \nsignificantly affect economic viability. The total cost would have to increase by 23% over those \nestimated for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. Freight benefits would have to fall by \n25% and passenger benefits by 175%. Given ADB\u2019s experience in the PRC railway sector, \nvariations of such magnitude are unlikely. Project risks were quantified through the statistical \nmethod,  i.e.,  considering  the  possible  value  for  key  variables  and  the  probability  of  their \noccurrence. The result shows that the EIRR will exceed 12%, with 100% probability. Distribution \nanalysis, undertaken by determining the project effects for various beneficiaries, indicates that a \nlarge portion of net benefits will accrue to project users and the economy. \n \nC.  Financial Benefits  \n \n58.  Financial projections prepared for the project company, according to ADB\u2019s Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects,32 assessed the financial viability and sustainability of the \nrailway (Appendix 16). The projected financial statements indicate that financial revenues will be \nsufficient to cover operation and maintenance costs, income taxes, and debt service, and \nprovide a reasonable rate of return. The financial evaluation was undertaken in real terms, in \nconstant 2008 prices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were \nconverted to real terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation \nand currency fluctuation. Incremental costs and benefits were derived under with- and without-\nProject scenarios. The financial internal rate of return, computed after tax, is 6.98%. This \ncompares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital, also computed after tax, of 2.74%. \nThe Project is both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity and risk analyses indicate that \nthe financial internal rate of return for the Project is robust under most conditions. Consolidated \nfinancial statements for the project company have been prepared and the project company\u2019s \nfinancial  performance  is  projected  to  be  sound  and  sustainable  over  the  operating  period \n(Appendix 16). \n \nD.  Environmental Impact and Assessment \n \n59.  The Project is classified as ADB environmental category A. The First Survey Design \nInstitute and the Second Survey Design Institute prepared an EIA for the Project, which was \napproved  by  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration  on  1  August  2008.  MOR  has \nendorsed the summary environmental impact assessment, which was circulated to the ADB \nBoard of Directors and uploaded onto the ADB website on 16 August 2007.  \n                                                 \n32 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "19 \n60.  The potential adverse environmental impact includes (i) noise and vibration impact on \nnearby residents; (ii) soil erosion from cut and fill activities; (iii) impact on the surface water \nquality  of  adjacent  waterways;  (iv)  impact  on  public  health  and  safety;  and,  (v)  increased \nsedimentation in local waterways from spoil stockpiles. The alignment intersects (i) the Yuhe \nProvincial Nature Reserve, (ii) the Maozhai Provincial Nature Reserve, and (iii) the Jialing \nCity-Level Wetland Nature Reserve. It mostly passes under these reserves in deep tunnels; \nhowever, protected flora and fauna in the nature reserves could be affected. The EIA concluded \nthat the adverse environmental impact can be successfully mitigated through best practices and \nappropriate technologies. The implementation of the environmental management, mitigation, \nand monitoring programs included in the EIA will ensure compliance with the environmental \nguidelines and procedures of ADB and the Government. Internal and external monitoring and \naudits will see to it that standards and regulations are followed. An independent monitoring \nagency will be hired to carry out external monitoring and evaluation during implementation. \n \nE.  Impact on Poverty  \n \n61.  The railway will traverse 28 districts and counties in the Gansu, Shaanxi, and Sichuan \nprovinces  and  Chongqing  municipality;  15  are  designated  national  or  provincial  poverty \ncounties.  The  Project  will  benefit  about  16.8  million  people  in  the  project  area,  of  which \n12.1 million are rural (72%) and 2.9 million are poor (17%). There are 2,897 designated poverty \nvillages in the project area, many of which lack access to potable water, electricity, roads, and \ntelephone (Appendix 17).  \n \n62.  The links between poverty, topography, and poor transport systems are apparent in the \nproject area. Poverty in this area is caused by (i) adverse environmental and weather conditions \nand limited farmland (e.g., mountainous terrain, cold weather, water scarcity, and soil erosion); \n(ii) geographical remoteness and isolation, and high transport costs; (iii) limited access to credit \nfor rural enterprises; (iv) lack of access to good social and health-care facilities; and (v) high \ncost of middle- and higher-level education. \n \n63.  About  468,000  person-years  of  work  will  be  created  for  unskilled  laborers  during \nconstruction. Of this total, 50% or more, or about 234,000 person-years, with total wages of \nCNY2,105 million, will be targeted at the poor. The estimated construction tax revenue to \ncounties will be reallocated and used for a range of poverty reduction and social activities, \nincluding the mitigation of negative impact from HIV/AIDS or sexually transmitted infections \n(STIs), human trafficking, and on the environment. The construction of 31 new railway stations, \nto be connected to the road network accessible by all villages, including the poor, will create \nvarious jobs to help distribute the benefits in the project area. There will be sufficient space in \nand around the stations for local area development, and local governments will support the \npoor, women, ethnic groups, and other vulnerable people in selling local specialties and other \ngoods and services. \n \nF.  Resettlement Impact  \n \n64.  The project railway alignment will cross 275 villages as it passes through 94 townships \nand 22 districts and counties. An estimated 1,646 hectares of land will be permanently acquired, \nof which about 83% is now under cultivation; the rest is predominately forest land, residential \nland, or wasteland. The loss of land will partially affect 81,400 persons. The impact is spread \nthinly over a long narrow corridor.33 The Project will temporarily require about 1,390 hectares. \n                                                 \n33 Land use for railways is much less than for a highway of equivalent capacity (a double-track railway has the \ncargo-carrying capacity of a 16-lane highway).  \n ", "20 \nAlso, the Project will affect 1.19 million square meters of structures, of which 94% are residential \nstructures; 42,250 persons (12,070 households) will have to be relocated. Aligning the railway \naway from urban areas, village centers, and other facilities, where possible, on the basis of \nconsultations with communities, has minimized the impact.  \n \n65.  MOR, in consultation with the local governments, has prepared a resettlement plan \nbased  on  the  feasibility  study,  surveys  of  most  of  the  affected  villages,  2,700  household \nsurveys, and consultations with local officials, village leaders, and affected households. Local \ngovernment  land  administration  bureaus,  in  conjunction  with  railway  construction  support \noffices, will be responsible for implementing the resettlement; many activities will be carried out \nby township officials and village committees. The estimated resettlement cost is CNY2.1 billion, \nincluding land taxes, administration fees, and contingencies. The summary resettlement plan is \nin  Appendix  18.  MOR  and  municipal-level  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  offices,  in \ncollaboration with the county resettlement offices, will be responsible for internal supervision \nand monitoring. An independent monitor will carry out the external monitoring and evaluation, \nand prepare monitoring reports for submission to MOR and ADB.  \n \nG.  Impact on Ethnic Minorities  \n \n66.  The  project  area  has  few  ethnic  minority  people  and  only  about  2%  of  the  total \nbeneficiaries,  numbering  about  1,000,  may  be  adversely  affected  by  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. The main ethnic group is Hui, who are quite integrated with the Han society. To \ngive further support to ethnic minorities and mitigate any potential social risks, special measures \nhave  been  included  in  the  resettlement  plan  and  social  development  action  plan  (SDAP) \n(Appendix 19). Ethnic minorities will be given preference in livelihood training and in jobs in \nconstruction  and  operation,  and  targeted  awareness  for  HIV/AIDS  and  other  transmissible \ndiseases and human trafficking.  \n \nH.  Social and Gender Aspects  \n \n67.  Women and other vulnerable groups will benefit from the Project, and have equal access \nto project-generated employment and wages. The railway will generate demand for local labor \nand increase worker productivity and wages. Under PRC law, women are given equal rights in \nemployment. The expansion of secondary and tertiary industries will help generate additional \nemployment  opportunities  for  both  men  and  women.  Afforestation  activities  will  provide \nadditional employment opportunities for women relatively close to their homes.  \n \n68.  The construction and operation of the railway could have an impact on HIV/AIDS/STIs \nbecause of the large number of workers during construction. HIV/AIDS-infected persons in the \nproject area are much fewer than in other parts of the PRC. Local governments have an active \npublic information program for HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention, including the distribution of \nleaflets and posters, the airing of radio and television programs, and voluntary counseling and \ntesting; these will be continued.  \n \n69.  During  construction,  the  county  governments  along  the  alignment  will  raise  public \nawareness among workers and communities. MOR has experience in ensuring that contractors \nimplement awareness and prevention programs during railway construction. Medical clinics \nhave been established in the area of construction camps, and HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns \nand preventive measures for workers and communities have been organized during railway \nconstruction. These activities will continue during the construction and operation of the Project. \n ", "21 \nCombined with increased awareness efforts by local government, they will ensure that the \npotential risks of HIV/AIDS/STI transmission are adequately managed. \n \n70.  An SDAP has been prepared in consultation with local governments to enhance the \nproject  benefits,  ensure  that  the  adverse  effects  are  avoided  or  mitigated,  and  increase \neconomic development benefits to the poor, women, ethnic minorities, and the vulnerable in an \nequitable and sustainable manner (Appendix 19). The SDAP will (i) enhance job opportunities \nfor local people; (ii) provide training and vocational programs for the poor, women, ethnic \nminorities, and the vulnerable; (iii) support HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention programs; \n(iv) support  income  recovery  programs  for  people  affected  by  resettlement;  (v)  provide \nawareness  and  prevention  programs  for  safety  during  construction  and  operation;  and \n(vi) promote local economic development. The SDAP will be implemented with the participation \nof relevant government agencies at the local level, including poverty alleviation offices, the \nAll-China  Women\u2019s  Federation,  and  health,  civil  affairs,  labor,  and  ethnic  affairs  bureaus. \nLeading groups have been formed to continue the process of consultation and coordination \namong various agencies during implementation. \n \nI.  Risks and Assumptions \n \n71.  The Project has been formulated to minimize potential risks. Traffic demand has been \nestimated conservatively, on the basis of experience with previous railway projects. Sensitivity \ntests indicate that economic circumstances would have to become substantially adverse for the \nProject to lose economic viability. A potential risk is delay in implementation, which would delay \nthe realization of benefits. MOR has successfully built railway lines, such as the Ganzhou\u2013\nLongyan, Hefei\u2013Xi\u2019an, and Jing\u2013Jiu railways. Support for the Project and its preparation from \nthe  Government,  MOR,  GPG,  SPG  and  CMG  will  help  reduce  the  potential  risk  of \nimplementation delays. Environmental risks will be mitigated by measures in the environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) and will be closely monitored during project implementation. \n \n72.  The Project will cause the relocation of 12,070 households and partial loss of land for \n81,400 people. The resettlement plan includes good compensation standards, rehabilitation \noptions, and preferential treatment for employment during construction, supply of local materials, \nallocation of commercial space near railway stations, and job training. The resettlement plan \nand SDAP will be closely monitored to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies. \n \n73.  Intermodal competition among railways and roads will create market risks for the project \nrailway. However, the existing road is already congested and capacity constraints are expected \nto worsen. Traffic surveys indicate that the railway has several advantages: lower fares, shorter \ntravel times, higher safety, and improved punctuality. The increasing commercial orientation of \nthe joint-venture railway will help lower the risks posed by intermodal competition. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \n74.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n(i)  Reform measures. The Government will take necessary measures to continue \nimplementation of the Railway Development Plan (2004) including (a) separating \nthe core railway operations from noncore transportation business operations, \n(b) rationalizing  staff,  and  (c)  encouraging  the  project  company  to  outsource \nsome activities currently handled by railways, including to the private sector. \n ", "22 \n(ii)  Construction  quality.  The  Government  will  cause  MOR  and  the  project \ncompany to ensure that the project railway is constructed in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s national technical standards, and that construction supervision, \nquality control, and contract management are carried out satisfactorily. \n(iii)  Connecting railway lines. The Government will cause MOR and the project \ncompany to ensure that (a) capacity enhancement operations for connecting \nrailway lines are completed by the commencement of commercial operations of \nthe project railway; and (b) necessary measures are promptly taken to mitigate \nany  capacity  constraint  on  connecting  railway  lines,  identified  during  the \noperation of the project railway, to ensure the smooth flow of traffic generated by \nthe project railway. \n(iv)  Container traffic. The Government will cause MOR to construct 2 extra-large \ncontainer terminals in Urumqi and in Lanzhou, and container handling facilities at \nLongnan and Guangyuan by the commencement of commercial operations of the \nproject railway. \n(v)  Supply of rolling stock. The Government will ensure that MOR and the project \ncompany provide sufficient rolling stock, at all times, for the effective operation of \nthe project railway. \n(vi)  Safety.

The Government will ensure, through MOR, that the \nproject  company,  in  cooperation  with  the  local  prefecture,  city,  and  county \ngovernments, formulates and implements appropriate public safety campaigns \nthrough media, public announcements, households, and schools to familiarize \npeople living along the project railway route with safety issues related to railways. \n(viii)  Station access and link roads. The Government will cause the local prefecture, \ncity, and county governments to (a) construct station access roads in a timely \nmanner prior to the commencement of commercial operations of the project \nrailway, and (b) apply ADB safeguard policies in the construction of such roads. \n(ix)  Financial  ratios  and  reporting.  The  Government  will  cause  the  project \ncompany to maintain, starting after the second full year of the commencement of \ncommercial operations of the project railway, (a) an operating ratio of not more \nthan 70%, (b) a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2, and (c) a debt-equity \nratio  of  not  more  than  65:35  to  ensure  operating  efficiency  and  financial \nsustainability. \n(x)  Tariff and tariff study. The Government will ensure that MOR and the project \ncompany set the tariffs, with respect to the project railway, at rates sufficient to \nensure full cost recovery including the management cost of the project company \nand  working  (operation  and  maintenance)  costs  of  the  project  railway, \ndepreciation,  debt  service,  taxes,  and  a  reasonable  profit.  The  Government, \nthrough MOR, will also ensure that the project company carries out a tariff study \n6 months prior to the trial operation of the project railway and advises ADB of the \ntariffs applied during such trial operation. \n(xi)  Anticorruption.  During  project  implementation,  the  Government  shall  follow \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy, it being understood that ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent, \ncollusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. The Government will cause \nMOR to ensure that (a) a supervisory body is established for the prevention of \nundue interference in business practices, and adequate resources are made \n ", "23 \navailable  for  its  effective  operation;  (b)  a  leading  group  of  officials  from  the \nDiscipline  Unit  and  Supervision  Department  of  MOR  are  located  in  offices \ninvolved in the bidding, construction, and other operational activities under the \nProject;  (c) periodic  inspections  of  the  contractors\u2019  activities  related  to  fund \nwithdrawals and settlements are carried out; (d) relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in all bidding documents for the Project; and \n(e)  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of MOR and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project. The Government shall also cause MOR \nand the project company to initiate liaison meetings with the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, \nas needed, where warnings about, or information on, corrupt practices can be \ndiscussed. \n(xii)  Environment. The Government will cause MOR, the project company, GPG, \nSPG, and CMG to ensure that (a) the Project is designed, constructed, operated, \nand maintained in accordance with environmental laws and regulations of the \nGovernment  and  the  ADB  Environment  Policy  (2002);  (b)  the  EMP  and  the \nmitigation measures included therein, as specified in the project EIA, are properly \nimplemented;  (c)  the  EMP  is  updated  at  the  engineering  design  stage  and \nincorporated into bidding documents and civil contracts; (d) any environmental \npermits, licenses, and clearances are obtained in a timely manner; and (e) the \nimplementation  of  the  EMP,  including  any  safety  breaches,  violation  of \nenvironmental standards, and corrective measures taken thereto, is reported \nsemiannually to ADB. \n(xiii)  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  Government  will  cause MOR,  the \nproject company, GPG, SPG, and CMG to ensure that (a) the resettlement plan \nis  updated,  if  necessary,  and  approved  by  ADB  before  the  start  of  land \nacquisition and  is carried  out  promptly  and  efficiently  in  accordance  with  all \napplicable government laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy  (1995);  (b)  all  affected  people  are  given  adequate  opportunity  to \nparticipate in resettlement planning and implementation; (c) those affected are \ncompensated and assisted prior to displacement from their houses, land, and \nassets, such that they will be at least as well off as they would have been in the \nabsence of the Project; (d) adequate and appropriate support is provided for \nenterprise  relocation;  (e) affected  people  receive  priority  for  employment  in \nproject construction; (f) special measures are implemented for ethnic minorities \nand vulnerable groups; (g) civil works contracts include requirements to comply \nwith the resettlement plan; (h) the implementation of the resettlement plan is \nmonitored  internally  by  the  project  company  and  the  respective  local \ngovernments, and externally by an independent institute; and (i) related reports \nare submitted to ADB and MOR as stipulated in the resettlement plan. The \nGovernment will cause MOR, the project company, CMG, GPG, and SPG to \nensure that (a) funds needed for land acquisition and resettlement, including \nthose for cost overruns, are allocated and disbursed in a timely manner; and (b) \nADB is promptly advised of any substantial changes in resettlement impacts. \n(xiv)  Poverty reduction and gender development. The Government will ensure that \nMOR  and  the  project  company  initiate  the  contractors  involved  in  project \nimplementation to maximize the employment of local poor persons, including \nethnic  minorities,  who  meet  the  job  and  efficiency  requirements  for  the \nconstruction of the project railway. Such workers will be provided with adequate \non-the-job training. Civil works contractors will comply with all applicable laws \n ", "24 \nrelating to gender equality. MOR and the project company will (a) implement the \nProject in accordance with the SDAP, and (b) monitor the Project\u2019s impact on \npoverty  and  gender  aspects  through  the  collection  and  compilation  of \ngender-disaggregated  data,  where  relevant,  and  submit  annual  monitoring \nreports to ADB during project implementation. \n(xv)  Health  risks.

Railway Sector Profile \n \n1.  Key Features. Despite government efforts to increase the country\u2019s transport capacity, \nserious constraints and bottlenecks remain, especially in the road and railway sectors. By the \nend of 2007, the PRC\u2019s railway system of 78,000 kilometers (km) comprised 63,600 km of \nnational railways and 14,400 km of joint venture and local railways.  From 1978, when economic \nreforms were first introduced, to 2007, the PRC experienced sustained rapid economic growth. \nThis resulted in a correspondingly rapid increase in demand for transportation. Passenger \ntransport grew by 9% yearly and freight transport by 7.6% yearly during the period. Railways are \nthe principal mode of freight transport in the PRC, accounting for 47.5% of total freight ton-\nkilometers (ton-km) in 2006, followed by 27.9% for inland waterways and sea-to-shore shipping, \n21.1% for roads, 3.3% for pipelines, and 0.2% for civil aviation. Road traffic accounted for \n52.8% of total passenger-kilometers (pass-km), followed by railways with 34.5%, civil aviation \nwith 12.3%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.4%.  \n \n2.  Recent  Developments.  To  minimize  transport  inefficiencies  and  eliminate  transport \nbottlenecks  that  constrain  efficient  economic  development,  the  Government  increased  its \ninvestment  in  transport  infrastructure  in  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  and  the \n11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010). Investment in transport infrastructure as a share of gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  more  than  doubled  in  the  last  decade.  The  PRC  had  invested \nCNY308 billion in capital construction to build 6,458 km of new lines, provide 3,275 km of \ndouble lines, and electrify 6,259 km of tracks in the 10th Five-Year Plan. A World Bank study1 \nindicates that total transport investment should increase to at least 3.8% of GDP to avoid the \neconomic costs associated with transport constraints. The Government continues to accord high \npriority to transport infrastructure investments to meet the increase in transport demand. \n \n3.  Future Development Priorities and Outlook. Substantial investments in the road and \nrailway sectors from both domestic and international financing sources, including the private \nsector, are envisaged in the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010). The plan continues to emphasize \nrailway  development,  and  seeks  to  accelerate  railway  construction.  It  envisages  (i) the \nconstruction of 17,000 km of new lines, and (ii) the double-tracking and electrification of 45% of \nthe network length. The plan seeks to (i) build a dedicated passenger railway network by \nconstructing  7,000  km  of  passenger-dedicated  lines  by  2010;  (ii)  develop  coal  transport \ncorridors by increasing the capacity of the existing lines; (iii) expand the railway network in the \npoor western region (to 34,000 km); (iv) build international corridors at the southwest and \nnorthwest  borders;  and  (v)  develop  a  nationwide  intermodal  container  network.  A  total \ninvestment  of  CNY1.5  trillion,  or  about  $200  billion  (CNY1.25  trillion  for  construction  and \nCNY250 billion for rolling stock) is planned in the 11th Five-Year Plan, of which a total of CNY \n465.2 billion has been spent in 2006 and 2007. \n \n4.  In 2004, the State Council approved the new railway development plan (up to 2020). The \nplan seeks to expand the railway network from 74,000 km in 2004 to 100,000 km by 2020. \nIncreasing train speed is a major goal.2 Priority will be given to developing railways in unserved \nareas and regions that lack transport and have remained less developed. The route network \nlength will be increased by 16,000 km to reach 40,000 km in the western region of the PRC by \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 1998. China: Forward with One Spirit: A Strategy for the Transport Sector. Washington, DC (Report \nNo. 1595-CHA Transport Sector Unit, East Asia and Pacific Regional Office).  \n2  By April 2007, train speed had been increased to over 160 kilometers per hour (km/h) on 14,000 km, and 200\u2013250 \nkm/h on 6,000 km of railway lines. \n ", "  Appendix 3  29 \n2020.  The  plan  also  calls  for  separating  passenger  and  freight  traffic  in  heavily  trafficked \ncorridors and for developing 12,000 km of passenger-dedicated corridors by 2020. \n \n5.  Other Development Partner Operations. In the railway subsector, the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation and the World Bank, in addition to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nhave been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of national railways. In the past 20 years, the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation has provided \u00a5578 billion for 15 railway projects to \nexpand rail transport capacity, particularly in major coal transport corridors. It has also financed \nthe development of new sections of the national railway network in inland provinces. Since 1984, \nthe World Bank has provided 12 loans totaling $2.9 billion for 11 national railway projects and one \nlocal railway project. ADB introduced Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement in 2004 to the PRC \nrailway  and  it  has  provided  2  loans  for  about  $140  million  (Euro  113  million)  for  network \nexpansion. Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau has provided 4 loans for Euro 484 million since 2005. \nAustria has provided a loan of Euro 35 million in 2006 and Spain provided a loan for Euro 78 \nmillion in 2005. US Export Import Bank has provided two loans of $300 million for procurement of \ntrack equipment since 2003.    \n \nB.  Asian Development Bank Experience \n \n6.  Assistance  to  the  Sector.  ADB  is  the  lead  lender  and  has  focused  on  improving \ninfrastructure in less-developed and poor regions to promote sustainable economic growth and \nreduce poverty. Since 1989, ADB has provided 15 loans totaling over $3.0 billion to help finance \nthe construction of 1,921 km of new railway lines under eight local railway projects, 5,541 km of \nnew railway lines under six national railway projects, and a sector-wide intervention to enhance \nsafety on the PRC railway network. These projects have introduced modern technology and \nimproved the efficiency of railway operation through institutional and structural reforms. ADB \nhas also provided 14 technical assistance initiatives totaling about $6.6 million to promote the \ncommercial operation of railways, establish corporate governance, achieve cost recovery, and \nimprove railway management.  \n \n7.  Evaluation of Assistance. The evaluation3 of ADB assistance to the transport sector in \nthe PRC concluded that ADB\u2019s program for railways was a success. The evaluation noted that \nin the railway subsector ADB strategic priorities were well-aligned with the PRC\u2019s needs. Its \noverall focus on building railways using modern technologies addressed needs to increase \nrailway capacity and reduce the persistent gap between supply and demand as quickly and \nefficiently  as  possible.  The  priority  given  by  ADB  to  improving  efficiency  and  commercial \norientation, and its emphasis on restructuring and reforming policy was well matched to evolving \ninstitutional reforms in railways. Experience from completed and ongoing ADB-financed railway \nprojects in the PRC shows strong commitment and generally satisfactory capabilities of the \nexecuting  agencies  for  project  implementation.  The  speed  of  implementation  has  often \nexceeded expectation at the time of appraisal. The executing agencies have generally complied \nwith the loan covenants. Resettlement and environmental management have been carried out \nsatisfactorily.  Audited  financial  statements  have  been  submitted  on  time,  and  the  audited \nfinancial statements have been found to be generally acceptable. Of ADB\u2019s 15 railway projects, \n10 are complete, and 5 are under implementation. The projects highlight the need to (i) ensure \nthat the executing agency established for project processing and implementation has adequate \ncapacity; (ii) prepare realistic traffic forecasts; (iii) review constraints on traffic throughout the \nnetwork, and the impact on project viability of existing and planned railway lines and other \ntransportation  modes  that  may  compete  with  the  project  facilities;  and  (iv) finance  railway \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2007.

Per capita rural incomes in project areas have \nsubstantially increased. Living standards have gone up and poverty has been reduced. The \nproject  performance  audit  report4 for  the  ADB-financed  Jing\u2013Jiu  railway  project  in  the  PRC \nconcluded that the project was successful and exceeded its original passenger traffic forecasts. \n \nC.  ADB Strategy \n \n8.  Strategy  and  Priorities.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  railway  sector  has  three  broad \nobjectives:  (i) improve  economic  efficiency,  (ii) promote  growth  in  poor  inland  provinces  to \nreduce poverty, and (iii) protect the environment and manage natural resources. In pursuit of \nthese  three  objectives,  the  strategy  supports  the  development  of  efficient  and  integrated \ntransport networks to meet the needs of a growing market economy and contribute to reducing \npoverty through investment targeting poorer areas, coupled with policy and institutional reforms. \nBecause of the importance of railway transport for the development of the national economy, \nADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  railway  sector  is  focused  on  (i) expanding  the  railway  system  by \nconstructing new lines in unserved areas that are less developed and poor, (ii) modernizing and \nincreasing the capacity to improve transport efficiency on key routes of the national railway \nsystem, (iii) commercializing railway operations to sustain efficient operations, (iv) promoting \nenergy  conservation  and  environmental  sustainability,  and  (v) increasing  railway \ncompetitiveness in the transport system through restructuring and reform.  \n \n9.  Poverty Reduction. To heighten the poverty reduction impact of transport investments, \nADB  pays  particular  attention  to  four  issues:  (i) locating  ADB-financed  projects  in \nless-developed  and  poor  regions  where  new  lines  will  stimulate  economic  development, \n(ii) encouraging the maximization of employment of poor people during project construction and \noperation, (iii) supplying local materials that meet the requirements of quality and economy from \npoor villages, and (iv) providing station access roads and link roads to widen the reach of \nproject benefits to poor interior areas. \n \n10.  Governance and Policy Reform Agenda. The ADB policy reform agenda in the railway \nsector  is  contributing  to  the  restructuring  of  the  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR),  the \ncommercialization of operations, the increased management autonomy of railway operations, \nhuman resource  development, and improvements in financial management and accounting \nsystems. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with MOR emphasizes the need for operational reforms for the \nrail  network,  including  enhancing  safety  in  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance.  ADB \nsupports the safety and security objective on PRC railways through the introduction of modern \ntechnologies, policy development, legislation, monitoring, and outreach activities (Appendix 6). \n \n11.  Private  Sector  Development.  The  PRC\u2019s  large  infrastructure  needs  require  local \ngovernments to shift from traditional financing modes to the capital markets. In the railway \nsector, a wider role for the private sector is envisaged. MOR has taken steps to create the \nconditions  necessary  to  attract  investments  in  the  project  facilities  and  services  from \nnongovernment and private sector sources. Possible areas include the construction of industrial \nsidings, commercial services, tourism, containerization, and parcel-related businesses. \n \n12.  Regional Cooperation. The PRC is an active participant in three regional cooperation \ninitiatives: (i) the Greater Mekong Subregion, through Yunnan and Guangxi province; (ii) the \nCentral  Asian  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  initiative,  through  the  Xinjiang \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002.

Manila.  \n ", "  Appendix 3  31 \nAutonomous  Region;  and  (iii) with  Mongolia,  through  Inner  Mongolia.  The  improvement  of \ncross-border trade regimes is a common feature of these initiatives. Since these programs \ninvolve the poorer areas of the PRC, expanding regional markets and options could help reduce \npoverty. The Greater Mekong Subregion and CAREC programs are developing strategies for \ncooperation in transport, of which railway is an important subsector. Steps are being taken to \ndevelop an institutional framework to facilitate the implementation of regional transport projects, \ne.g., Uzbekistan\u2013Kyrgyz Republic\u2013PRC railway development and the Pan-Asian railway project \n(Singapore\u2013Kunming railway link project). \n \nD.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n13.  Monitoring Targets, Indicators, Modality, and Processes. The Government monitors \nand  evaluates  sector  performance  annually;  ADB  reviews  this  through  the  process  of  the \ncountry partnership strategy. Indicators for evaluating sector performance include (i) economic \ndevelopment and poverty indicators for the western region; (ii) transport density in relation to \nland area and population; (iii) public and private investment in railways; (iv) transport demand \nfor freight and passengers with modal split data; (v) level of user charges (railway construction \nsurcharges, etc.); and (vi) cross-border traffic volumes with the Central Asian republics, the \nGreater Mekong Subregion, and Mongolia. \n \nTable A3: Railway Sector Road Map \n  Indicators \nItem  2000  2007  2010 \nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has engaged the Ministry of Railways (MOR) on \nthe key issue of enhancing energy efficiency on the PRC railways. The 11th Five-Year Plan of \nthe Government identifies this as a key area for action and has requested MOR to take actions \nto enhance energy efficiency on the railway system. MOR has initiated some steps to achieve \nthis; however, these measures are local and are not coordinated. A key aspect highlighted in \ndiscussions with MOR is the need for a sector-wide strategy to deal with this important issue, \nwhich would include taking stock of current consumption patterns and energy conservation \nmeasures, identifying the gaps, and recommending actions that can be taken by MOR. MOR \nhas therefore requested ADB for a grant assistance to assist MOR in this important area. The \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  will  assist  MOR  in  developing  a  strategy  for  enhancing  energy \nefficiency and energy conservation.  \n \nB.  Scope \n \n2.  The study will (i) analyze the energy efficiency of the PRC railway sector, (ii) identify \nareas where energy efficiency can be improved, (iii) recommend actions and technologies that \ncan be adopted, and (iv) develop a national railway sector energy efficiency strategy. It will help \nprioritize areas for enhancing energy efficiency and recommend a pipeline of priority lending \nprojects for energy efficiency in the PRC railway sector, some of which can be supported by \nADB.  \n \nC.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n3.  International consultants, supported by national consultants, will be hired to implement \nthe study. The consultants will (i) undertake a desktop study of available studies on the energy \nefficiency of the PRC railway sector, (ii) analyze the energy efficiency characteristics of the PRC \nrailway sector and identify areas where energy efficiency can be enhanced, (iii) review recent \ntechnological developments and assess the most appropriate technologies for transfer to the \nPRC railway sector, (iv) undertake consultation with key stakeholders, (v) prepare a national \nrailway sector energy efficiency strategy, (vi) prioritize investment areas and recommend a \npipeline  of  priority  lending  projects  for  energy  efficiency  in  the  PRC  railway  sector, \n(vii) recommend a railway energy efficiency enhancement project that ADB could support, and \n(viii) provide  capacity-building  support  to  major  stakeholders  in  achieving  railway  energy \nefficiency. An international training program with participation from the relevant departments will \nbe organized to allow the participants to learn from the experience of other railways abroad. \nWorkshops and seminars will be organized to review and disseminate the findings of the study. \nThe study will be undertaken in close consultation with the Government, MOR, and other \nrelevant agencies. The study will build on ADB\u2019s ongoing policy dialogue and will consider all \nprevious studies by the Government, ADB, AFD, the World Bank, and other multilateral and \nbilateral agencies.  \n \nD.  Cost and Financing \n \n4.  The total cost of the study is estimated at $1,000,000 and is proposed to be financed \nwith a TA from the Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility.1 \nThe Government has requested ADB to finance $800,000.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n5.  MOR, as the Executing Agency, will be responsible for supervising and monitoring the \nstudy activities. A steering committee, comprising representatives of relevant departments of \nMOR,  will  be  set  up  to  oversee  implementation,  provide  guidance  and  direction  to  the \nconsultants. In addition, MOR will appoint a project coordinator to supervise and coordinate \nday-to-day  study  activities,  including  monitoring  progress,  resolving  problems,  arranging \nmeetings, and coordinating with concerned government agencies. To facilitate the work of the \nconsultants  and  ensure  that  MOR  benefits  from  their  experience,  MOR  will  also  provide \nadequate counterpart staff with relevant work experience during implementation.  \n \n6.  A  team  of  international  consultants  in  association  with  national  consultants  will  be \nengaged by ADB through simplified technical proposals and quality- and cost-based selection \n(80:20) according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging national consultants. The \nstudy will require about 24 person-months of international and about 12 person-months of \nnational consulting services. The consultants will have expertise in energy efficiency as applied to \nthe railway sector and must have experience developing similar policies and programs. The study \nis expected to begin in March 2009 and to be completed by December 2009. The procurement \nof  equipment,  supplies,  and  materials  by  consultants  under  the  study  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The equipment will be turned \nover to MOR after the study. \n ", "Appendix 15  49\nTRAFFIC FORECAST AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Traffic Forecast \n \n1.  Freight traffic for the Lanzhou\u2013Chongqing Railway (LCR) was forecast by commodity \n(i.e.,  coal,  petroleum  products,  iron  and  steel,  fertilizers,  intermodal  containers,  and  other \ncommodities) in two categories differentiated by their economic impact: (i) traffic diverted from \nother modes (other railway routes, and roads) on the basis of an assessment of the relative \nservice and cost-competitiveness of the project railway; and (ii) generated traffic that would \nmove only because of the existence of a railway line where none previously existed. The traffic \nforecast was based on a two-tier analysis: (i) national transport demand based on historical \ntrends correlating socioeconomic parameters, such as gross domestic product and propensity to \ntravel or ship or demand for railway transport; and (ii) national and regional railway traffic \ndemand based on commodity-specific analysis for major commodities currently using other \n \nrailway lines and roads. Traffic projections considered expected economic growth, population \nincrease, tourism development potential, local government development plans, market surveys, \nand assessments of technical assistance (TA) consultants and the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) missions. The freight volume on the LCR is forecast to increase from about 40.14 billion \nton-kilometers (ton-km) in 2015 to 88.58 billion ton-km in 2034, for an average annual growth \n \nrate of about 4.25%. Passenger traffic is forecast to grow from 10.70 billion passenger-km \n(pass-km) in 2015 to 34.19 billion pass-km in 2034, for an average annual growth rate of 6.3% \n(Table  A15.1).  Traffic  forecasts  are  considered  reasonable,  given  that  (i)  the  LCR  is  an \nimportant  link  connecting  northwest  PRC,  Central  Asia,  and  Europe  to  the  Chengdu\u2013\nChongqing\u2013Shanghai transport corridor, which also connects to Southeast Asia via Kunming to \nthe  south,  such  that  transit  traffic  accounts  for  49.3%  of  total  freight  traffic \n(origin-and-destination pairs for major traffic movements include Urumqi\u2013Kunming, Urumqi\u2013\nChengdu, Alashankou\u2013Chengdu, Jiayuguan\u2013Chengdu, Jiayuguan\u2013Geermu, Geermu\u2013Chengdu, \nUrumqi\u2013Guiyang, Urumqi\u2013Yangang, Kunming\u2013Wuwei, and Geermu\u2013Chengdu); (ii) railways in \nthe PRC have experienced high annual traffic growth with recent rates higher than the assumed \ngrowth rates for freight and passenger traffic; (iii) for about two-thirds of the length of the \nalignment,  there  has  been  limited  transport  infrastructure  developed,  with  the  result  that \nresources such as minerals have not been exploited, and there are already plans to tap these \ndeposits once LCR is opened; and (iv) the average distance saved by routing traffic through \nLCR  compared  with  other  railway  lines  is  about  295  km,  and  over  600  km  for  two \norigin-and-destination pairs involving long-distance movement between eastern and western \nPRC.  \n \nB.   Economic Evaluation  \n \n2.  Alternative  Analysis.  As  part  of  the  economic  analysis,  possible  alternative \ninterventions that would meet the growing transport demand in the project area under the \nnational and provincial transport network plan were considered. Alternative analysis reviewed \ntransport modes, alignments, and technical designs for various options. While enhancing the \nexisting road capacity may be an option that would partly meet the increasing demand, it will not \ncompletely satisfy the various kinds of traffic, particularly bulk cargo such as coal over long \ndistances to meet the needs of a growing economy. Aside from the higher initial cost, increased \nland requirements, high air pollution impact, fuel consumption, and user costs make the road \nalternative less viable. Several alignment alternatives were subsequently evaluated for line \nsections  on  the  basis  of  geologic  and  topographic  conditions,  terrain  considerations, \nconsultations  with  community  representatives,  cost  estimates,  relative  impact  on  the \nenvironment and on resettlement, and integration with the national and local transport network. \n \n ", "50  Appendix 15 \nThe  technical  design  was  proposed  after  consideration  of  the  national  railway  network, \nconsistency in the standards of contiguous sections at each end of the project railway, and \nforecast traffic.  \n \n3.  Cost. The economic evaluation is based on a comparison of with- and without-Project \nscenarios, using constant 2008 economic prices. Under the with-Project scenario it is assumed \nthat the diverted traffic (41.98 million tons and 12.24 million passengers in 2015) estimated \nunder the with-Project scenario would continue moving by road and by existing railway lines. \nFurthermore, the generated traffic estimated under the with-Project scenario (26.98 million tons \nand 6.65 million passengers in 2015) would not materialize under the without-Project scenario. \nThe project benefits and cost were revalued in economic prices by separating the cost items \ninto tradable materials and equipment, non-tradable materials, labor, and land. The prices were \nexpressed in yuan using the domestic price numeraire with a shadow exchange rate factor \n(SERF) of 1.01 for foreign exchange effects. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.67 was used to put \nan economic value on the wages paid to unskilled labor but not on wages for skilled labor, since \nthere is no clear surplus of skilled workers.  \n \n4.  Benefits. Economic benefits include (i) user cost savings for freight and passenger \ntraffic; (ii) time savings for diverted passenger and freight traffic from buses, trucks, and other \nrail  lines;  (iii)  passenger  and  freight  transport  benefits  generated;  (iv)  tourism  benefits; \n(v) shipper  savings  due  to  increased  railway  competition,  (vi)  road  accidents  avoided; \n(vii) reduced pollution; (viii) energy savings; and (ix) national productivity benefits.  \n \n5.  For passenger traffic diverted from road (5.08 million passengers in 2015), the user cost \nsaving (CNY197.74 million in 2015) is the difference in the passenger economic fare between \nroad and rail transport (CNY0.1271 per pass-km). For passenger traffic diverted from other LCR \nroutes (7.00 million passengers in 2015), the user cost saving (CNY66.97 million in 2015) is the \ndifference in route distance applied to the economic cost of rail passenger travel (CNY0.0123 \nper pass-km). For passenger traffic diverted from air (0.15 million in 2015), the user cost saving \n(CNY32.35  million  in  2015)  is  the  difference  between  the  economic  cost  of  LCR  and  air \ntransport (CNY0.3693 per pass-km). For generated passenger traffic (both local and interline) \nthe estimated pass-km (3.6 billion in 2015) is multiplied by one-half of the average economic \ncost saving (CNY0.0845 per pass-km), and amounts to CNY307.16 in 2015. Passenger traffic \ntime saving (CNY3.57 million in 2015) was computed only for diverted traffic.  \n \n6.  For freight traffic diverted from roads (9.6 million tons in 2015), the economic benefit \n(CNY675.01 million in 2015) is the difference in shipper economic costs between road and rail \ntransport (CNY0.1865 per ton-km). For traffic diverted from other railway routes to LCR, the \nbenefit (CNY446.65 million in 2015) is the rail-diverted ton-km (26.93 billion in 2015) multiplied \nby the difference (CNY0.0166 per ton-km) between the economic rate of rail transport to the \nLCR economic rate. For generated freight traffic benefits (CNY6,708.73 million in 2015) an \nadjusted economic value-added ranging from CNY111.06 per ton for fertilizers to CNY2,440.74 \nper ton for containerized cargo was computed on the basis of current financial value, nontax \nelements, SERF, percentage value added, percentage net taxes, depreciation, and operating \nsurplus for each commodity. The adjusted economic values per ton represent the net economic \nvalue, i.e., the value of output at economic prices less the costs of production (sum of all \nintermediate input costs, wages, and annualized investment costs). Since generated traffic \nbenefits represent producer\u2019s surplus, one-half of the economic value for each commodity is \nmultiplied by estimated generated freight tons. Similar to passenger traffic, freight traffic time \nsaving (CNY3.65 million in 2015) was computed only for diverted traffic. \n ", "Appendix 15  51\n7.  Tourism benefits (CNY64.14 million in 2015) assume that 15% of incremental interline \npassenger traffic growth is attributable to LCR (0.338 million in 2015), which will generate a net \neconomic value of CNY95 per tourist, representing 16.9% of the value added in the tourism \nsector accounting for the value of output at economic prices less the cost of production (sum of \nall intermediate input costs, wages, and annualized investment costs). To eliminate double \ncounting, a downward adjustment of 15% of generated traffic benefits was made, reducing \nthese  benefits  by  the  same  proportion  as  the  percentage  of  tourists  in  projected  interline \npassengers.  \n \n8.  Energy and pollution benefits were also estimated for the Project. With the diversion of \nfreight and passengers from road to rail, there will be benefits from reduced pollution from \ntrucks, buses, and cars as well as less energy used by the transport sector. On the basis of \nrecent research conducted by the International Energy Agency, the number of tons of carbon \ndioxide (CO ) per traffic unit for road and rail were computed for PRC. These savings for rail \n2\ncompared with road were found to be 25.4 tons of CO  per million pass-km and 24 tons of CO  \n2 2\nper million ton-km. This value was included in the benefit stream (CNY54.62 million in 2015). In \naddition, the saving in reduced total fuel consumption (CNY616.01 million in 2015) as a result of \ndiverting traffic from both road and rail to LCR was computed and included in the benefit stream. \nUnit operating costs for both road and rail transport were adjusted to exclude fuel costs in order \nto eliminate double counting of this benefit.  \n \n9.  The construction of LCR will help avoid some costs that would not be possible in the \nabsence  of  LCR.  The  economic  analysis  estimated  four  such  cases  of  cost  avoidance; \n(i) highway  investment  costs  avoided;  (ii)  highway  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  costs \navoided; (iii) truck shipping charges to freight shippers avoided through increased competition \nbrought about by LCR; and (iv) road accident costs avoided.  \n \n10.  Conclusion. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 17.09% \n(Table A15.3). Benefits from freight traffic, including generated benefits, are the major economic \nbenefit (about 63.8% for freight shippers in Table A15.2), with passenger benefits contributing \nabout 4.9% and other benefits making up the balance. Sensitivity analysis tested 10 scenarios \nto assess the robustness of the results of the economic analysis (Table A15.4). The total cost \nwould have to be more than 23% higher than estimated for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate \nof  12%.  Considering  the  experience  of  ADB-financed  projects  in  the  railway  sector,  this \nswitching value is unlikely to occur. The freight benefits would have to decrease by about 25% \nto make the Project economically nonviable. A 1-year delay in completion would not affect \neconomic  viability  but,  again,  this  is  unlikely,  as  MOR  has  demonstrated  the  capacity  to \nimplement and complete projects on schedule. Combinations of adverse effects of benefits and \ncosts were also tested. The results showed that the Project would maintain its economic viability \nunder plausible scenarios of variability. \n \n11.  The economic analysis was extended to quantify project risk and distribute project net \nbenefits among stakeholders. The risk analysis considered the distribution of possible values for \nkey variables, including capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, passenger traffic, and \nfreight traffic, and the probability with which they may occur.

General  \n \n1.  The  projected  financial  statements  of  the  proposed  Lanzhou\u2013Chongqing  Railway \nDevelopment  Project  were  prepared  in  current  terms  for  2008\u20132034.  Construction  will  be \ncompleted in 2014, followed by trial operation in 2015. The cost estimates are presented in \ncurrent terms. As required in the financial management guidelines, physical contingencies (at \nthe weighted average rate of 6.14%) and price contingencies1 have been provided.  \n \nB.   Financial Projections  \n \n2.  A set of tariffs was devised for freight and passenger transport service, on the basis of \nfull cost recovery plus an adequate return on equity. Operating revenues from tariffs were \nprojected on the basis of a forecast of future traffic and a base average tariff rate of CNY0.12 \nper ton-kilometer (ton-km) for 2015, inclusive of Railway Construction Fund collections, which \naverage CNY0.033 per ton-km. The freight tariff is assumed to increase at a rate of 1% yearly \nwith tariff adjustments taking place every 5 years. Similar to the freight tariff, passenger fares \nare  assumed  to  increase  in  current  terms  once  every  5  years  at  an  annual  rate  of  1%. \nPassenger tariff ranges from CNY0.1 per passenger-kilometer (pass-km) for local trains to \nCNY0.20 per pass-km for very fast transit trains (200 km/hour) in 2015, with a weighted average \nrate of CNY0.144 per pass-km for all passenger traffic. No real increase in tariffs is expected to \noccur over the Project\u2019s life span. Other revenues, including loading and unloading, warehouse \nstorage, parcel service in the train stations, amount to 4.5% of combined freight and passenger \nrevenue.  \n \n3.  All incremental operating costs are projected to increase yearly with inflation rates. \nPeriodic track maintenance and infrastructure rehabilitation will be required after each 7 years of \noperation, at a cost of CNY2.598 million per route-kilometer; electric power and catenaries will \nbe replaced after 15 years of operation at a cost of CNY1,298.86 million, and signaling and \ncommunications, safety, and other equipment will be replaced after 20 years of operation, at a \ncost of CNY650.99 million.  \n \n4.  Depreciation is calculated according to the straight-line method, with an average life of \n65 years for the main railway structure, 10 years for track, 45 years for buildings, 15 years for \nelectric power and traction, and 20 years for signaling, communications, safety, and other \nequipment and facilities. Applicable business taxes, at an average rate of 3.24%, are charged \non revenue. Corporate income tax, at 33%, is paid on income after deducting business taxes, \ndepreciation  and  interest  charges,  operating  expenses,  and  any  prior  year  losses  carried \nforward.  \n \n5.  The Project will be funded 50% by equity (55% by MOR and 45% divided between the \nChongqing municipal government and Gansu and Sichuan provinces) and 50% by long-term \nloans. The loan from China Construction Bank (CCB) is repayable over 20 years, including a \ngrace period, at a lending rate currently set at 6.6% yearly. The loan from the Industrial and \nCommercial Bank of China (ICBC) is repayable over 25 years, including a grace period, at a \nlending rate of 7.13% currently. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan ($300 million) will \n                                                 \n1  Physical contingencies computed at 6.14% of base cost on average for civil works and 6.14% for field research and \ndevelopment, training, surveys, and studies (this estimate is based on assumed contingency rates for specific \ncomponents ranging from 3% to 15%). Price contingencies computed at 6.8% on foreign exchange costs in 2008, \n0.7% in 2009, 1.4% in 2010, 0.4% in 2011, 0.5% in 2012 and onward, and local currency inflation rate at 5.5% in \n2008, 5.0% in 2009 and onward, and includes provision for exchange rate fluctuation under the assumption of a \npurchasing power parity exchange rate. \n ", "  Appendix 16  55 \nhave a 27-year term with a 7-year grace period, and be a US dollar London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)\u2013based loan. The projected financial statements indicate that the forecast revenue \nunder the base assumptions is sufficient to cover annual recurrent costs, depreciation, and debt \nrepayments on the ADB and domestic bank loans, and generate reasonable profits.  \n \n6.  A financial management assessment questionnaire was completed according to ADB \nguidelines. The Executing Agency will maintain separate accounts for the Project and have such \naccounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited  annually  by  an  independent  auditor, \naccording to auditing standards that are acceptable to ADB. The Executing Agency is also \nrequired to submit to ADB, within 6 months after each fiscal year, certified copies of such \naudited project accounts and financial statements and auditor\u2019s reports, all in English. The audit \nof such financial statements will include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and \ninternal control systems with respect to project expenditures and other financial transactions, \nand (ii) an assessment of compliance with loan covenants that may be agreed on under the \nProject and ADB\u2019s project management requirements, and (iii) a separate opinion on the use of \nthe imprest account and statement-of-expenditure procedures. Within the project company, an \ninternal audit unit will be established to ensure that an effective internal control system is put in \nplace. The unit will independently test financial transactions to ensure the safe custody of the \nproject-financed assets and will report directly to the project company management and external \nauditors. The Foreign Capital and Technical Import Center, under the Ministry of Railways, will \nmake satisfactory arrangements for reporting the progress of project implementation to ADB by \nsubmitting quarterly progress reports. \n \nC.   Financial Analysis \n \n7.  Following are the major assumptions used in the calculation of a financial internal rate of \nreturn: (i) all calculations are based on 2008 prices, covering 2008\u20132034; (ii) capital costs \ninclude  all  incremental  capital  expenditures  related  to  construction  and  equipment  for  the \nrailway, but exclude price contingencies and interest during construction; (iii) operating costs \ninclude all annual incremental expenses incurred in operating the project railway, but exclude \ndepreciation and debt repayment provisions; and (iv) the residual value is equal to one-half of \nthe net book value of the capital investment.  \n \n8.  The estimated weighted average cost of capital (WACC), after-tax, in real terms was \ncalculated as follows: (i) the applicable 7-year LIBOR fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s \nspread of 0.6% with a discount of 40 basis points was used for ADB debt, with an interest rate \nof 4.51%; (ii) the estimated interest rates of 7.13% per year for the Industrial and Commercial \nBank of China loan and 6.6% per year for the China Construction Bank loan were used; and (iii) \nthe opportunity cost of equity capital was assumed to be 10%. The cost of debt was also \nadjusted to reflect the impact of income tax of 33%. The nominal cost was converted to the real \ncost by applying domestic and international long-term inflation rates for local currency and \nforeign exchange denominated debt, respectively.  \n \n9.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  Project,  computed  after  tax,  is  6.98% \n(Table A16.4), which compares favorably with the WACC of 2.74%, computed after tax. The \nProject is considered both financially viable and sustainable. The sensitivity of the Project's \nfinancial indicators to cost and revenue variations is shown in Table A16.5. Sensitivity tests \nindicate that conditions that might cause the Project\u2019s viability to fall below the WACC are \nunlikely to occur. The switching values show that the financial viability of the Project is not \naltered within a realistic range of variation in key parameter estimates. \n ", " \nTable 16.1: Projected Income

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \nThis Project is consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy, which aims to enhance pro-poor economic growth through \ntransport infrastructure development. The railway will serve a as key transport link for the western development region of the \nPRC. Overall, it is expected that the Lanzhou\u2013Chongqing Railway (LCR) Development Project will contribute to equitable \neconomic growth by (i) improving access to marketing and employment opportunities; (ii) facilitating access to key social \nservices; (iii) supporting and stimulating agricultural production; (iv) promoting trade, encouraging livelihood diversification, \nand enabling information exchange; (v) improving a key component of regional and rural infrastructure and reducing widening \ngaps in living standards and economic opportunities between the western and coastal areas; and (vi) removing one of the \nconstraints on the development of poor and rural communities. \nB. Poverty Analysis                                                                           Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nDevelopment in the project impact area (PIA) has been constrained by limited transportation infrastructure, which is one factor \ncontributing to the relatively high incidence of poverty in some areas. The 28 counties and districts in the PIA include 15 \nnationally designated poverty counties and 2,897 designated poverty villages (31% of all villages in the PIA). Better railway \ntransport will provide an enabling condition for poverty reduction through improved access to markets, employment, education \nand medical facilities, new knowledge and information, families working or studying in other regions, and other social and \neconomic services that facilitate economic development. Improved access to markets will open up opportunities for new \nenterprises and expansion of existing ones. Incoming passengers and tourists will spawn additional demand for locally \nproduced goods and services. \n \n2.  Design Features  \nThe construction and operation of the railway will generate significant employment in local communities, which will be targeted \nat local communities including poverty villages. Construction access and roads connecting to the railway will directly benefit \npoor villages by helping to extend the project benefits and opportunities to the poor communities. Station area development \nwill encourage small business development among local people, including women and the poor. \n \nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending - not applicable \n  \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nA poverty and social assessment (PSA) has been prepared for the Project. This includes a poverty profile of beneficiaries and \nclient groups and a social assessment. The beneficiaries of the Project have been identified through surveys, consultative \nfieldwork, and secondary sources. Beneficiaries can be broken down into (i) direct beneficiaries, i.e., existing rail users, and \nother transport users who might shift to rail, such as freight carriers, and passengers; and (ii) indirect beneficiaries, who do not \nnecessarily rely on the railway but may derive some benefits including those in public sector employment, operators of small \nbusinesses such as shop owners and traders, farmers and farmers\u2019 associations or cooperatives, people engaged in daily \nlabor, construction workers, and tourists visiting or transiting the PIA.  \nEconomic conditions along the alignment range from relatively well off to some of the poorest in the PRC. Most of the villages \nalong the alignment are isolated and have not been recipients of development. The links between poverty, topography, and \ntransport systems are apparent in the PIA. People living in the mountains or in isolated areas lack fertile land and sufficient \nmeans of livelihood. They also live in areas prone to drought, frosts, erosion, and uncertainty. The main causes of poverty in \nthe project areas are (i) natural calamity, (ii) lack of infrastructure, (iii) very limited and unsustainable sources of livelihood, \n(vi) uneven economic development, and (v) poor health. The Project will benefit about 16.8 million people in the PIA, of whom \n72% live in rural areas and 8% are designated poor (using the official absolute poverty line in the PRC of CNY693 per person \nper year). According to survey data, 17% of households are poor and vulnerable (with annual incomes below CNY1,000). \nVulnerable households are above the poverty line but are susceptible to economic shocks that could force them below the \npoverty line. Few households have regular nonfarm income. The most predominant livelihood sector, on a regular or irregular \nbasis, is agriculture, accounting for 80% of all working household members.  \nAbout 467,913 unskilled person-years of work will be created during the construction of LCR. Half will target the poor, at total \nwages of CNY2,105 million over 233,957 person-years, or CNY8,997 per person-year\u2014more than 12 times the official \npoverty line of CNY693 per person per year. Hiring priority will be given to women, resettlement-affected people, and \nvulnerable people. In addition, during the construction, 80,693 person-years of local unskilled jobs in the provision of \nconstruction materials, with total wages of CNY605.2 million, will be created; again, half, or 40,346 person-years, with total \nwages of CNY302.6 million will be set aside for the poor. When the new railway starts operating in 2015, about 3,460 more \n ", "60  Appendix 17 \nlow-skilled and unskilled jobs will be created, with total wages of CNY34.60 million annually. Expecting more efficient and \ncheaper freight transport and business travels on the LCR, many enterprises in the PIA have been planning to expand their \noutput and increase labor; PIA companies foresee the creation of an estimated 35,646 jobs as a result of LCR.  \nThe 31 railway stations, which will be connected to all levels of road network accessible by all villages, will also create various \njobs, and help distribute benefits across a broader spectrum of the population throughout the PIA. Station design will ensure \nsufficient space in and around the stations for local area development to foster income-generation opportunities for the poor, \nwomen, and vulnerable people, who will be supported by local government agencies in selling local specialties as well as \nother goods and services. All of this direct, indirect, and generated impact will provide the conditions for meeting the PRC goal \nof micro-urbanization for poor families by (i) moving poor households away from unsustainable, mountainous, and isolated \nfarmlands; (ii) providing better access to markets, advanced education, and health facilities especially for pregnant women; \n(iii) building a sustainable future through new centers of economic activity; and (iv) complementing poverty reduction activities \nby assisting the poor with urban migration, relocation, employment, local economic development, farmer-based rural tourism, \nagricultural product development, access to health services, and physical infrastructure improvement. In addition to providing \ncheaper transport, LCR will offer a safer means of travel than roads. \n \nB. Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe PIA of LCR includes seven prefectures and 28 counties in Gansu, Shaanxi, and Sichuan provinces and Chongqing \nmunicipality. Participation has included surveys and community consultation (focus group meetings and interviews with \nstakeholders). About 3,900 household surveys, 350 village surveys, and 200 industry surveys, as well as 770 passenger \nsurveys, have been completed. During the household surveys, beneficiaries provided information on their perceptions of the \nProject: overall, 94% saw the Project as bringing tangible benefits to their household, while 5% were indifferent and 1% \nexpressed the view that that the Project would also have some adverse impact. \nVarious  project  public  consultations  and  participation  activities  were  carried  out  in  2006\u20132007  and  the  role  of  each \nstakeholder has been identified. The Ministry of Railways (MOR), the First and Second Survey Design Institutes of China Rail, \nthe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  consultant,  and  ADB  missions  have  had  formal  and  informal \nconsultations with local communities and government agencies through meetings, surveys, household interviews, written \ncommunications, and workshops. Since the start of the feasibility studies some 14,000 individuals have been consulted about \nthe Project. MOR is the Executing Agency and is responsible for overall supervision and implementation of construction \nactivities. The local county and township governments and communities will assist the Executing Agency in land acquisition, \nthe implementation of the resettlement plan, and the organization of local labor for the construction and local development \n(including the station areas) to ensure that the Project benefits the poor, women, ethnic minorities, and other vulnerable \npeople. Initial issues discussed included the selection of the alignment. Further public consultation occurred during various \nfield surveys among local residents and government officials, tourists, passengers using all modes of transport, industries in \nthe PIA, and other stakeholders.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nThe resettlement and environment safeguard processes also include consultations with and the participation of the community \nas a key step in the identification of impact and mitigation measures. Beneficiaries will participate in project development and \nimplementation through the use of local people, especially the poor and women, in the construction of civil works. The \ncontract documents include clauses specifying targets for local employment. A participation and consultation plan has been \nprepared to guide MOR in continuing the consultation with stakeholders and affected communities along the alignment. \n \nC. Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe PSA concluded that women will be beneficiaries of the Project, as the Project could have gender-specific outcomes. \nGeneral social benefits that could be derived from improved and maintained transport access could also enhance the \nparticipation of women in the commercial sector. The construction of the LCR will create opportunities for local area \ndevelopment by (i) facilitating the flow of materials and information into the area, and (ii) accelerating the development of local \nindustries. Many of the service sector jobs that will be created by the railway and in the tourism sector are for female \nemployees. The All-China Women\u2019s Federation (ACWF) will provide business management training and financial assistance \nto women interested in setting up small businesses that serve construction crews. But while women stand to benefit from the \nProject, they are also likely to be more exposed to the risk of communicable diseases. This risk will be mitigated through the \nHIV/AIDS/STI and human trafficking awareness and prevention programs that are a component of the social development \naction plan (SDAP) to be implemented by the Project.  \n \n ", "Appendix 17  61\n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n    Gender plan         Other actions/measures (refer to SDAP)         No action/measure \n \nPoverty and social enhancement measures have been built into the project design, and special mitigation (or protection) \nactions have also been included in the SDAP and the resettlement plan. For example, members of the community will \ncollectively decide where schools and other community facilities will be relocated. Women, especially female heads of \nhousehold, will be consulted, as schools provide an informal source of day care for their children. Widows and households \nheaded by women will be eligible for special assistance, if necessary, during land acquisition and resettlement. The SDAP \nincludes a range of measures including hiring preferences to ensure that women fully participate in, and enjoy project benefits \nto the same extent as men. Women will be given priority in hiring for project-generated jobs during the construction and \noperation of the railway. The increase in female participation in the labor force will increase women\u2019s net income, thus \nimproving overall family welfare, and raising the status of women. \n \nIII.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n \nAre social indicators included in the design and monitoring framework to facilitate monitoring of social development activities \nand/or social impacts during project implementation?      Yes        No      \n \n \n \n ", "62  Appendix 18 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \n1.  The Project involves an 820 kilometer electrified double-track railway line from Lanzhou \nto Chongqing. The Lanzhou\u2013Chongqing Railway (LCR) Development Project will cross Gansu \nand Sichuan provinces and Chongqing City and 28 counties and districts. Land acquisition and \nhouse demolition will affect 94 townships and 275 villages. The resettlement impact of the \nProject is spread thinly over a long, narrow corridor. The resettlement plan addresses the \npermanent and temporary impact caused by the railway alignment, station sites, station access \nroads, and related construction activities. The project scope does not include the proposed loop \nlines and rail yards in Lanzhou and Chongqing.  \n \n2.  An estimated 1,646 hectares of land will be permanently acquired. Of this, 31.0% will be \npaddy  land,  51.0%  cultivated  dryland,  0.8%  garden  or  orchard,  6.8%  forest  land,  6.4% \nresidential land, and 2.7% wasteland. The Project will also temporarily acquire 1,388 hectares \nfor LCR construction activities and access. A total of 1,189,240 square meters of structures will \nbe affected, 93.7% of which will be residential units and other farm structures, 5.3% industrial \nstructures, and 1% schools. According to the standard for impact assessment in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), the equivalent of 3,843 households would lose all their land and \nagricultural livelihoods, and 12,072 households would have their houses demolished. Since the \nalignment is narrow, most land impact will be partial, resulting in more affected households with \nless significant impact. From previous experience with PRC railways, it is estimated partial land \nimpact in the order of 15% along the route and 33% at stations will be experienced, affecting \nabout 81,366 affected people and 21,469 households through permanent land acquisition. In \naddition,  an  estimated  6,935  households  (26,283  people)  are  expected  to  be  affected  by \ntemporary land acquisition. Land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) impact has been lessened \nby aligning the railway away from the most densely populated areas, and avoiding villages, \ncultivated land, and facilities where possible; 72.6% of the alignment is tunnels or bridges.  \n \n3.  The resettlement objective is to ensure that compensation and entitlements provided to \naffected persons are adequate to at least maintain their \"without-Project\" standard of living, with \nprospects of improvement, in line with the PRC Land Administration Law (amended 2004) and \nwith ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). In addition, affected people that are poor or \nvulnerable should be made better off, either as direct beneficiaries or through special measures \nto safeguard and enhance their living conditions. People losing land, housing, other assets, or \nother means of production will be compensated at replacement cost and assisted in restoring \ntheir incomes and living standards. Payments for land will be made to the village collectives, and \nthey will determine how the funds should be allocated among the affected persons. Village \nrehabilitation plans will be prepared for stations that cause serious impact on affected villages; \nthese plans will be integrated with station area development plans. \n \n4.  The resettlement plan stipulates eligibility and entitlement provisions for affected persons. \nThe Project will ensure that land compensation will not be less than 16 times the average \nannual output value. Compensation for temporary land loss will be paid directly to the affected \npersons and the land will be restored to its original state after use. Compensation for rural \nhousing  losses  will  be  paid  directly  to  the  affected  persons  at  replacement  cost,  free  of \ndepreciation, demolition expenses, and salvaged materials. In general, rural households will \neither rebuild their own houses within the same village or integrated with the centrally planned \nsuburban housing. Better road access and provision of site leveling, water supply, electricity, \ntelephone,  and  cable  facilities  will  be  provided.  Urban  households  may  choose  to  be \n(i) allocated replacement housing on the basis of a swap of property rights for properties of \nequivalent size and quality, or (ii) paid cash compensation at the market price with which they \nmay purchase replacement housing in the real estate market. Compensation for crop and tree \nlosses will be paid directly to the affected persons. Factories, schools, and other institutions and \nenterprises will be compensated after a process of negotiation. Local government will finance \nthe improvement of affected schools.  \n ", "Appendix 18  63\n5.  The Ministry of Railways (MOR), with the assistance of the First and Second Survey and \nDesign Institutes, conducted a survey of 1,565 potentially affected households in August 2006. \nAlso, the project preparatory technical assistance consultant surveyed 355 villages and 1,167 \nadditional  households.  About  11.9%  of  all  households  surveyed  had  net  incomes  below \nCNY1,000 per capita. Special measures are included in the resettlement plan for the poor and \nother vulnerable groups to ensure they are adequately rehabilitated and their living standards \nimproved. Ethnic minority households constitute 2% of the population in the project area; most \nare Hui living in cities.  \n \n6.  Each village or affected person will use the land compensation and resettlement subsidy \nfor income restoration. Local officials have indicated that schools, factories, and enterprises will \nrebuild locally and that these organizations and their employees will be fully compensated for \nany  and  all  losses  and  costs  associated  with  relocation.  Affected  households  will  receive \ntraining and skills development assistance that will facilitate income-generating activities. An \nincome restoration budget has been included to meet the costs of extension of services to \naffected  persons  and  others  in  affected  villages  in  areas  such  as  agricultural  extension, \ncooperative marketing and organization for agricultural produce, agricultural and enterprise \ncredit, and other needs that arise during detailed resettlement planning and implementation. \nOther assistance, such as preferential hiring of affected persons by construction companies and \naccess to capital, will also be provided. \n \n7.  Affected persons have been informed and consulted at various stages about the project \nimpact and resettlement policies and entitlements. They will continue to be consulted and are \nencouraged to participate in resettlement activities, including the detailed measurement survey, \nlocation  of  underpasses,  new  housing  sites,  and  grievance  redress.  Affected  persons  can \nappeal  any  problems  or  grievances  regarding  land  acquisition,  housing  demolition  and \nrelocation, compensation, and resettlement to five levels: the village committee, the railway \nconstruction support office (RCSO), local government, the project company, the independent \nmonitor, or the courts. A resettlement information booklet was provided by MOR to all affected \nvillages in October 2007. The resettlement plan will be updated on the basis of the inventory of \nlosses and the final alignment. \n \n8.  Local government RCSOs, set up under the local development and reform commissions, \nwill be responsible for implementing the resettlement; the offices at the county or district level \nwill coordinate the administrative LAR activities, with assistance from township officials and \nvillage committees. MOR will monitor the LAR activities and supervise the contractors with \nrespect to temporary impact. MOR and the local governments have extensive experience with \nresettlement. The local government will provide training to local officials who will be involved in \nimplementation.  MOR  and  the  project  company,  in  collaboration  with  the  RCSOs,  will  be \nresponsible for internal supervision and monitoring of resettlement. An independent monitor will \nbe contracted by MOR to carry out the external monitoring and evaluation work.  \n \n9.  The  total  resettlement  cost  for  the  Project  is  CNY2.1  billion,  including  taxes  and \ncontingencies. The budget will be adjusted on the basis of the actual measurement of physical \nlosses. Each provincial government1 will be responsible for resettlement costs as part of its \nequity in the Project Company. The local governments will supplement the resettlement budget, \nas may prove necessary, to meet any shortfall. The implementation schedule is based on the \nproposed project construction timetable. Land acquisition will begin in December 2008 and \nfinished in early 2012. The Project will be completed in 2015. \n                                                 \n1  The exception is Shaanxi province, where less than 25 km of LCR is located, and only two villages are affected. In \nthis case, although the local government will implement the resettlement, costs will be financed by the Project. \n ", " \nSOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ACTION PLAN \n6\n4\nProposed Actions  Targets  Agencies Involved  Timing  Funding Source  Monitoring Indicators    \n \n \nA.
