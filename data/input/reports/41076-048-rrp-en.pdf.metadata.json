It  will  do  this  by  improving  the  road  transport  network  in  Mindanao  through  the \nimprovement  of  national  roads  in  Mindanao,  financing  detailed  design  for  the  improvement  of \nadditional highways in the future, and strengthening the institutional capacity of the Department \nof Public Works and Highways (DPWH). \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nThe  road  subsector  is  the  most  important  transport  subsector  in  the  Philippines.  The \nnational road network comprises 29,630 kilometers (km), or 14% of the total road network, and \nincludes the main trunk roads, national primary arterial roads, and national secondary roads. An \nefficient  road  transport  subsector  is  crucial  for  the  Philippines\u2019  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction. Despite its importance to the national economy, the road subsector has not received \nadequate funding. Expansion or improvement of the network has not kept pace with population \ngrowth,  and  many  roads  deteriorate  prematurely  because  of  inadequate  maintenance. \nGovernment funding for the road network has been increasing in recent years. However, about \n23% of the national road network is in poor condition and in need of rehabilitation. This contributes \nto the rising number of road accidents in the Philippines. The increasing impact of climate change, \nparticularly flooding, is having a negative effect on the road network. Mindanao\u2019s road network is \nless developed than the national network. While 82% of the national roads in Luzon and 89% in \nVisayas are paved, only 70% of the national roads in Mindanao are paved. \n \n4. \nMindanao is the second largest island in the Philippines, with a population of more than \n20  million  people.  Despite  being  rich  in  natural  resources,  Mindanao  has  the  highest  poverty \nincidence of the Philippines\u2019 three island groups (Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao), with a rate of \n36.2%.1 This  is  largely  because  of  civil  conflict  and  low  economic  growth.  Despite  significant \ndevelopment  in  recent  years,  a  number  of  infrastructure  targets  in  the  government\u2019s \nMindanao 2000  plan  were  not  achieved  because  of  the  lack  of  coherent  plans,  inadequate \ngovernment  financial  resources,  and  underinvestment,  especially  by  the  private  sector  due  to \nperceptions of the civil conflict.2 The government, Japan International Cooperation Agency, the \nWorld  Bank,  and  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  have  completed  or  are \nimplementing  national  or  provincial  road  improvement  projects  in  Mindanao.  However,  a  large \npart of the road network in Mindanao remains in need of improvement. \n \n5. \nThe transport sector is governed by the National Transport Policy, which was approved in \nJune  2017.  The  policy  focuses  on  (i)  resource  generation  and  allocation;  (ii)  criteria  for  the \npreparation  of  agency  plans,  programs,  and  projects;  (iii)  cost  recovery;  (iv)  regulation  of \npassenger transport; (v) urban transport; (vi) transport logistics; and (vii) governance. The sector \n                                                \n1  Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2017. Philippine Development Plan, \n\n2017\u20132022. http://pdp.neda.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PDP-2017-2022-07-20-2017.pdf.  \n\n2  Mindanao Development Authority. 2011. Mindanao 2020: Peace and Development Framework Plan, 2011\u20132030. \n\nDavao City. \n\n\fdevelopment  plan  is  set  forth  in  the  Philippine  Development  Plan,  2017\u20132022  (footnote  1). \nInstitutional  capacity  of  the  DPWH  has  improved  significantly  over  the  last  decade,  with \nassistance provided by ADB and other development partners. However, capacity development is \na long-term process, and additional improvement is needed, particularly in regional offices. \n \n6. \nMindanao  plays  a  key  role  in  the  Philippines\u2019  participation  in  regional  cooperation \ninitiatives.  It  comprises  most  of  the  Philippine  territory  in  the  Brunei  Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013\nMalaysia\u2013Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) Greater Sulu Sulawesi Corridor.3 \nThe project is aligned with Strategic Pillar I (Enhancing connectivity within BIMP-EAGA as well \nas with other regions outside of BIMP-EAGA) of the BIMP-EAGA Implementation Blueprint, 2012\u2013\n2016.4 Improving roads in Mindanao will support the development of agribusiness, ecotourism, \nand logistics, contributing to the development of the Greater Sulu Sulawesi Corridor. \n \n7. \nThe  project  supports  the  government\u2019s  priorities  for  improvement  of  the  country\u2019s  road \nnetwork and development of Mindanao (footnote 1). It also supports the key objective of ADB\u2019s \nstrategy for the Philippines of helping the country achieve high, inclusive, and sustainable growth.6 \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  the  midterm  review  of  ADB  Strategy  2020  through  its  focus  on \nimproving  the  delivery  of  infrastructure  services  as  well  as  investing  in  physical  assets. 7  It \nsupports regional cooperation and integration by contributing to the implementation of the ASEAN \nHighway  and  BIMP-EAGA  Priority  Infrastructure  Projects.  It  supports  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable \nTransport  Initiative 8 by  addressing  climate  change  and  road  safety,  and  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s \nPhilippines Transport Sector Assessment, Strategy, and Road Map.9 \n \n8. \nLessons learned. ADB approved the Road Improvement and Institutional Development \nProject  in  December  2011. 10 The  project  includes  periodic  maintenance  of  about  340  km  of \nnational  roads  in  Luzon,  Visayas,  and  Mindanao;  institutional  capacity  development  for  the \nDPWH; and consulting services for project supervision and preparation of detailed engineering \ndesign  for  future  projects.  The  primary  lesson  learned  from  the  Road  Improvement  and \nInstitutional Development Project is the risk of delays in procurement, which were caused by the \nDPWH\u2019s lack of familiarity with ADB procedures and weak capacity. The capacity of the DPWH \nregional  and  district  offices  involved  in  implementation  will  be  strengthened  under  the  project. \nTraining  on  procurement for the  DPWH  staff  will  also  be  conducted.  ADB  conducted  a  project \nprocurement-related  review  (PPRR)  of  the  project  in  2015. 11 The  PPRR  concluded  that  the \nDPWH  and  the  Unified  Project  Management  Office  (UPMO)  had  established  a  reasonably \neffective control environment, which generally provided assurance that the project procurement, \nfinancial management, and contract implementation adhere to the relevant policies, guidelines, \nand  loan  agreement.  The  PPRR,  however,  identified  two  issues  that  would  not  prevent  the \naccomplishment of project objectives, but might result in financial loss should they recur: (i) the \nneed  for  improved  quality  of  evaluation  of  bids,  and  (ii)  noncompliance  with  the  bid  and \n\n                                                \n3  ADB. 2017.

The recommendations will be addressed in \nprocurement under the project. \n \nSpecial  features  and  value  addition.  The  project  has  several  special  features.  The \n9. \ndesign  of  the  project  roads  will  include  climate  change  adaptation  measures  incorporating \nstructural  and  nonstructural  features.  To  facilitate  public  participation \nin  strengthening \ngovernance, all project roads will be geotagged with information accessible to the public on the \ninternet.12 Community  awareness  campaigns  will  be  conducted  to  improve  road  safety  on  the \nproject roads. ADB\u2019s financing adds significant value to the project. The use of ADB\u2019s sector loan \nmodality  allows  the  government  to  concentrate  road  improvement  activities  in  Mindanao  and \nprovides flexibility in determining the most appropriate location for subprojects, given changing \npolitical and security conditions in Mindanao. ADB\u2019s leadership in promoting regional cooperation \nand  integration  in  Southeast  Asia  will  facilitate  Mindanao\u2019s  realization  of  regional  as  well  as \nnational  benefits.  The  project  will  support  other  initiatives  promoting  growth  in  Mindanao.  The \nthree core subprojects will help link the mariculture and trade cluster in western Mindanao with \nthe four  other  Mindanao  development  clusters  being  promoted  by  the  Mindanao  Development \nAuthority.13 The  project  will  also  contribute  to  and  benefit  from  the  development  of  the  BIMP-\nEAGA Greater Sulu Sulawesi Corridor (footnote 3), which encompasses Mindanao. ADB has a \nlongstanding  and  ongoing  relationship  with  the  DPWH,  which  covers  improvement  of  physical \ninfrastructure  as  well  as  strengthening  institutional  capacity.  This  productive  relationship  will \ngreatly facilitate project implementation.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  strengthened  economic  and  physical \nlinkages  in  Mindanao.14 The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  improved  efficiency  and \nsafety of selected sections of the road transport network in Mindanao.15 \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \nOutput 1: Selected sections of road transport network in Mindanao improved. The \nproject will improve an estimated 280 km of national primary, secondary, and tertiary roads and \nbridges in Mindanao. The improvements will include paving earth roads, replacing damaged road \nsections,  widening  existing  roads,  adding  surface  overlays,  and  replacing  and  strengthening \nbridges. The project roads will be designed with features to strengthen resilience to climate change. \nAmong the structural and nonstructural features included are elevated pavement levels, enhanced \nslope protection, and improved maintenance of drainage structures. Road safety on these roads \nwill be improved through road safety community awareness campaigns. Three core roads located \non the Zamboanga peninsula in western Mindanao (Region IX), with a total length of 78 km, have \nbeen  appraised  for  inclusion  in  the  project.16 Consultants  for  the  ongoing  ADB-funded  project \n(footnote 10) prepared the detailed design for the core roads, and will prepare the detailed design \nfor the non-core roads. The government will propose additional roads, which will have to meet the \n                                                \n12 Geotagging  provides  the exact  location  of  a  road  using  Global  Positioning  System  (GPS)  technology  and,  when \nlinked  with  DPWH  institutional  monitoring  systems,  it  provides  a  mechanism  to  monitor  road  investment  projects \nthroughout the project life cycle, including procurement and construction. \n\n13 Mindanao  Development  Authority.  2014.

The  project  will  finance  detailed  design  drawings  and  bills  of  quantities  for  the \nimprovement of 300 km of national highways in Mindanao, to be improved under other projects. \nThe  government  will  determine  the  roads  for  which  the  detailed  design  will  be  prepared.  The \ndesign will incorporate features to strengthen resilience to climate change. \n \n13. \nOutput 3: Institutional capacity of the Department of Public Works and Highways in \nmultiyear planning, fiscal accountability, and human resource management strengthened. \nThe  project  will  improve  the  institutional  capacity  of  the  DPWH  to  make  management  of  the \ntransport sector more efficient and contribute to improved operations of the transport sector in \nMindanao and nationwide. Strengthening of the DPWH\u2019s institutional capacity will take place in \nregional offices and at headquarters. Training in multiyear planning will be carried out exclusively \nin the DPWH regional offices, while the new human resources database system integrating all \nDPWH operations will be made operational in all DPWH offices. Making the new online system \nfor  budgeting  and  fiscal  monitoring  operational,  and  the  provision  of  support  in  supervising \nregional planning, will take place at the DPWH headquarters. To ensure the sustainability of the \ninvestment in the new systems, the project will provide operational training to the DPWH staff. \n \nD. \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n14. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $503  million  (Table  1).  Detailed  cost  estimates  by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).17 \nThe  government  has  requested  a  regular  loan  of  $380  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 30-year term, including a grace period \nof 7 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (the  interest  and \nother  charges  during  implementation  to  be  capitalized  in  the  loan);  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.

The detailed \ndesign for the three core subprojects has been completed, and bidding documents will be issued \nbefore loan effectivity. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nA. \n \n20. \nThe  project\u2019s  technical  viability  has  been  confirmed  through  the  project  preparatory \ntechnical  assistance.  The  detailed  design  for  the  three  core  roads  has  been  completed.  The \ndesign is for two-lane 6.7-meter wide concrete roads, which meet DPWH technical criteria and \nare  based  on  proven  construction  technology  in  Mindanao.  Adaptation  measures  related  to \nelevation of pavement, slope protection, and maintenance practices have been incorporated in \nthe  project  design  to  reduce  climate  change  risks.  Based  on  the  Preliminary  Climate  Risk \nScreening Checklist, the subproject road is in the medium risk category. Potential impacts caused \nby floods, landslides, and the increase in precipitation were considered during project preparation. \nCorresponding  adaptation  measures  have  been  formulated  as  part  of  the  climate  change \nassessment  carried  out  for  the  project. 19 Among  the  structural  and  nonstructural  adaptation \nmeasures  included  in  the  road  designs  and  project  cost  estimates  are  increased  pavement \nelevation levels, enhanced slope protection, and intensified maintenance of drainage structures. \n \nB. \n \n21. \nEconomic. The three core project roads are economically viable. The project will improve \nthe  condition  of  these  roads  by  replacing  the  gravel  surface  with  a  concrete  pavement.  Three \nmain  benefits  were  identified  and  estimated  for  inclusion  in  the  project\u2019s  economic  viability \nassessment: (i) reduced vehicle operating costs, (ii) savings from reduced transport time, and (iii) \ngenerated traffic. The economic internal rate of return of the three core project roads ranges from \n10.4% to 19.1%, and the net present value ranges from $2.0 million to $37.0 million. In addition \nto  quantified  benefits,  communities  in  the  areas  of  influence  will  benefit  indirectly  through \nimproved  connectivity  with  better  access  to  markets,  economic  opportunities,  and  government \nand other social services such as education and health.  \n \nFinancial. Financial analysis shows that the funding for maintenance of national roads in \n22. \nthe Philippines has increased significantly since 2010. Funding for routine maintenance increased \nat an average annual growth rate of about 25% from 2010 to 2017. Funding for more intensive \nmaintenance and rehabilitation, reconstruction, and upgrading of national roads stayed at about \nthe same level in 2017 as 2011; however, funding for these activities increased at an average \nannual growth rate of about 16% from 2015 to 2017. Maintenance of the improved project roads \n\n                                                \n19 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nwith  their  concrete  pavement  will  be  less  expensive  than  maintenance  of  the  roads  with  their \ncurrent gravel surface. Based on the trend of increasing funding for maintenance of national roads \nand the lower funding requirement for maintaining the improved project roads, it is considered \nreasonable to expect that the government will provide sufficient financing for the maintenance of \nthe project roads and that the project is financially sustainable. \n \nC. \n \nThe  financial  management  assessment  of  the  DPWH  confirmed  that  the  financial \n23. \nmanagement  risk  is  substantial  and  that  the  DPWH  has  sufficient  capacity  to  manage  and \nmaintain  the  accounting  systems,  financial  controls,  and  audit  arrangements  required  for  the \nproject. High risks are related to the use of advance account procedures and financial reporting. \nThe  DPWH  does  not  have  experience  using  advance  account  procedures  (formerly  known  as \nimprest account procedures) and will require training and guidance in their proper use. ADB will \nprovide  consultant  support  to  mitigate  these  risks  and  build  capacity  by  making  financial  and \nmanagement  systems  operational  and  training  staff  in  their  use.    Other  risks  are  assessed \nmoderate to low. The DPWH\u2019s financial accounting, auditing rules, and internal control systems \nfollow generally accepted international accounting and auditing practices. The DPWH follows the \nPhilippine  Public  Sector  Accounting  Standards,  which  have  been  harmonized  with  the \nInternational  Public  Sector  Accounting  Standards.  The  Commission  on  Audit,  which  is  the \nSupreme Audit Institution, follows the Philippine Public Sector Standards on Auditing, which are \nin  harmony  with  the  International  Organization  of  Supreme  Audit  Institutions  framework  of \nprofessional standards. The DPWH maintains separate project records and accounts to identify \nthe works, goods, and services financed from the loan proceeds, financing resources received, \nexpenditures incurred for the project, and use of counterpart funds, including adequate internal \ncontrols  and  financial  reporting  arrangements.  The  Commission  on  Audit  will  audit  the  project \naccounts  and  related  financial  statements  annually.  To  facilitate  public  participation  in \nstrengthening governance, all project roads will be geotagged with information accessible to the \npublic on the internet through the DPWH\u2019s project and contract management application system. \n \n24. \nADB and the government will undertake a number measures to improve DPWH\u2019s financial \nmanagement  capacity  under  the  proposed  and  ongoing  projects.  The  project  will  improve  the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  DPWH  by  making  operational  DPWH\u2019s  new  online  system  for \nbudgeting  and  fiscal  monitoring  and  providing  operational  training,  A  national  financial \nmanagement  expert  will  be  engaged  to  assist  the  DPWH  during  the  first  5  years  of  project \nimplementation.  The  TA  for  Strengthening  Infrastructure  Capacity  and  Innovation  for  Inclusive \nGrowth  will  assist  DPWH  and  other  agencies  to  improve  project  management  and  monitoring \nusing international best practices and experts in the areas of project management.  20 The Road \nImprovement and Institutional Development Project (footnote 10) is strengthening DPWH\u2019s fiscal \naccountability  by  financing  the  completion  of  the  implementation  of  the  financial  information \nmanagement system and business process reengineering in DPWH. \n \n25. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  DPWH.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 17). \n \n\n                                                \n20  ADB. 2017.

It was subject \nto  social  assessment  using  meaningful  consultation  as  a  key  strategy  to  incorporate  issues, \nconcerns,  voices,  and  participation  of  stakeholders  in  the  project  preparation,  implementation, \nmonitoring, and reporting. Potential benefits and positive impacts and anticipated adverse impacts \nwere  identified  during  consultations  and  the  social  assessment.  To  mitigate  potential  adverse \nimpacts, required key actions have been prepared under the various project components. The \nproject is classified effective gender mainstreaming. Gender issues cover a range of concerns \nincluding livelihood, abuse, and trafficking of women and children. While the project outcome does \nnot specifically address gender equality, project outputs are designed to deliver benefits to women \nby  directly  improving  their  access  to  social  services,  economic  or  financial  resources  or \nopportunities, and basic infrastructure. A gender action plan 21 has been prepared and a gender \nstrategy  is  incorporated  in  the  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  framework  (RIPF) 22 and \nensuing plans. The gender action plan has several targets concerning the participation of women \nin  the  project.  At  least  50%  of  road  safety  community  facilitators  will  be  women.  Women  will \ncomprise  25%  of  the  participants  in the training in  multiyear  planning  carried  out  in  13  DPWH \nregional offices. Women will comprise at least 25% of participants in the support in supervising \nregional planning provided to the DPWH headquarters. \n \nE. \n \n27. \ncategories are as follows.23 \n \n28. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environment.  An \nenvironmental assessment and review framework24 has been prepared to ensure that subprojects \nto  be  prepared  during  implementation  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and \nPhilippine  laws.  The  17  km  core  subproject  (Tampilisan\u2013Sandayong  Road)  in  Zamboanga  del \nNorte does not pass through environmentally sensitive areas, and about 90% of land use along \nthe road is agricultural/cropland. Results of the initial environmental examination (IEE)25 showed \nthat  the  proposed  road  improvement  works  will  not  cause  significant  adverse  environmental \nimpacts.  Anticipated  impacts  during  construction  and  operation  have  been  assessed,  and \nmitigation  measures  have  been  formulated  to  reduce  these  to  acceptable  levels.  The \nenvironmental management plan will be incorporated in civil works contracts to guide the DPWH, \nthe supervision consultant, and contractors in managing, monitoring, and reporting environmental \nimpact mitigation and compliance. The DPWH has an Environmental and Social Services Division \nstaffed  with  environmental  specialists  experienced  in  implementing  ADB  projects.  Public \nconsultations  were  conducted  during  IEE  preparation,  involving  stakeholders  such  as  local \nresidents and representatives from the local government units, women\u2019s organizations, and the \nbusiness sector. A grievance redress mechanism has been formulated and will be implemented \nto facilitate resolution of project-related environmental impacts. The environmental assessment \nand review framework and the IEE have been disclosed on the ADB website. The IEEs for the \nother two core subprojects are under preparation. \n \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n                                                \n21 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 ADB.

The  project  will  involve  road  improvements to \n29. \ninclude  widening,  realignment,  and  slope  protection  that  will  require  land  acquisition.  Land \nacquisition will trigger physical and economic displacement within the 30-meter road right-of-way \n(ROW).  Temporary  loss  or  disruption  of  land  use  or  other  assets  during  construction  work, \nparticularly  the  movement  of  construction  materials  to  and  from  work  sites,  is  also  expected. \nResettlement impacts on indigenous peoples are also anticipated. A RIPF has been prepared for \nthe  sector  project  to  cover  the  core  and  non-core  subprojects.  A  resettlement  and  indigenous \npeoples  plan  (RIPP) 26 has  been  prepared  for  one  of  the  core  subprojects,  the  Tampilisan\u2013\nSandayong  road,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  This  subproject  will \nentail  land  acquisition  for  the  ROW  resulting  in  415  potentially  affected  households,  with \n78 affected  households  deemed  for  relocation.  The  plan  will  ensure  measures  for  affected \nhouseholds  to  assist  them  in  maintaining,  if  not  improving,  their  socioeconomic  pre-project \nconditions.  Measures  in  the  plan  include  procedures  for  stakeholder  engagement  through \nmeaningful  consultation  and  participation  as  well  as  timely  information  disclosure,  grievance \nredress mechanisms, institutional arrangements, capacity building, and the necessary budgetary \nallocation  for  plan  implementation.  All  these  measures  have  been  disclosed  to  the  affected \nhouseholds through consultation and dissemination of public information booklets, consistent with \na harmonization of Philippine laws and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Specific arrangements \nfor compensation of APs, to be coordinated by the DPWH and partner agencies, include (i) job \nplacement or temporary work during construction, (ii) social services and nutritional programs, (iii) \nvocational  skills  training,  (iv)  an  agricultural  enhancement  program,  and  (v)  linkages  to \ncooperatives to facilitate economic support. The RIPP and RIPF have been uploaded on the ADB \nwebsite. The RIPPs for the other two core subprojects are in an advanced state of preparation. \n \nIndigenous peoples (category  A). Indigenous peoples are present in the project area \n30. \nfor  the  core  roads  on  the  Zamboanga  Peninsula,  and  largely  belong  to  the  Subanen,  lranun, \nSamal,  Maguindanaon,  Tausug,  Yakan,  Maranao,  and  Kalibugan  indigenous  peoples  groups. \nThe  RIPF  upholds  the  conditionalities  for  broad  community  support  (BCS)  and  will  seek  the \nconsent of affected indigenous peoples communities through the certificate precondition/free prior \ninformed  consent  process  as  embodied  under  the  Indigenous  Peoples  Rights  Act,  1997.  For \nMuslims as indigenous peoples, BCS will be observed through the provincial local government \nunit.27 For a project component or subproject requiring BCS, the lack or absence of BCS will make \nthe  subproject  ineligible  for  loan  proceeds.  The  National  Commission  on  Indigenous  Peoples \n(NCIP) is assessing the Tampilisan\u2013Sandayong road for issuance of the certificate precondition \nas provided in the RIPF.28 Under the Tampilisan\u2013Sandayong road subproject, land acquisition for \nthe  new  ROW  will  trigger  physical  and  economic  displacement.  Among  the  415  affected \nhouseholds, 24 are indigenous peoples (23 Subanen and 1 Kolibugan). The generalized culture \nis  lowland  central  Philippines  focused  on  wet  rice  cultivation,  and  some  localized  swidden \ncultivation. Project encroachment on ancestral domains will be avoided as traditional/customary \nmodalities  of  livelihood  systems  are  preserved  in  these  areas.  However,  other  culture  traits \nexhibited beyond the domain may be at risk, such as agroforestry systems/home gardens as food \nproduction systems. Positive and negative impacts resulting from the project are addressed in a \ncombined RIPP anchored on the RIPF that embodies measures for meaningful consultation and \nparticipation as well as timely information disclosure, grievance redress mechanisms, institutional \narrangements, capacity building, and the necessary budgetary allocation for plan implementation.  \n                                                \n26 Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Organic Act of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (RA 9054, 2001). \n28 The NCIP has constituted the field-based investigation team, and prepared the work and financial plan in May 2017, \ntogether  with  the  authorized  DPWH  representatives.
