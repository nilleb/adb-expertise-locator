The  report \nalso  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Capacity  Development  for \nMicroenterprise  Development  Project,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \nThe project aims to promote microenterprise development for inclusive economic growth \n2. \nand poverty reduction. It will support improving microenterprise access to finance through the Palli \nKarma  Sahayak  Foundation  (PKSF),  an  apex  development  finance  and  capacity  building \norganization;  and  its  partner  organizations  (POs),  which  are  selected  microfinance  institutions \n(MFIs). The overall project comprises (i) a financial intermediary loan of $50 million for a credit \nline  to  the  PKSF  and  (ii)  a  TA  grant  of  $500,000  for  building  capacity  for  microenterprise \ndevelopment. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nBangladesh\u2019s economy has been growing at an average 6% during 2000-2017. However, \n3. \npoverty  is  still  prevalent\u2014especially  in  rural  areas\u2014and  about  24%  of the  population still  lives \nbelow the national poverty line. Promoting the rural nonfarm segment became an important policy \nagenda  to  generate  rural  job  opportunities  and  reduce  poverty.1  Bangladesh  has  a  mature \nmicrofinance  industry,  which  has  been  financing  the  rural  nonfarm  segment,  including \nmicroenterprises.2 Microfinance is now a major funding source for microenterprises and has great \npotential to contribute to rural nonfarm segment-led growth in Bangladesh. \n \nMicrofinance  industry  in  Bangladesh.  Microfinance  is  defined  as  financial  services, \n4. \nincluding savings and credit, to poor or low-income people who have no access to formal financial \nservices. Bangladesh\u2019s microfinance industry started in the 1970s to reduce poverty by providing \nmicrocredit, mainly for rural nonfarm activities. Early pioneer MFIs, including Grameen Bank and \nBRAC, provided loans based on a group guarantee using funding provided by the Government of \nBangladesh, development partners, and donors. \n \n5. \nToday,  Bangladesh\u2019s  microfinance  industry  has  an  extensive  outreach  of  758  MFIs \nservicing  30  million  clients.3  The  industry  is  regulated  by  the  Microcredit  Regulatory  Authority \n(MRA) under the Microcredit Regulatory Authority Act, 2006. In 2017, MFIs disbursed with total \nloans  outstanding  of  Tk770  billion.  The  industry  maintains  a  good  portfolio  and  had  a  98% \nrecovery rate in 2017.4 \n \n6. \nTraditionally, MFIs provide group-based microcredit to their members to finance cottage-\nsize  rural  income-generating  activities.  However,  as  Bangladesh\u2019s  economy  grows,  MFI  client \n\n                                                 \n1  The rural nonfarm segment is defined as economic activities in villages, rural towns, and peri-urban areas, excluding \nthe  primary  production  of  crops,  fish,  trees,  and  livestock.  Developing  the  rural  nonfarm  segment  contributes  to \npoverty reduction by fostering backward and forward linkages and creating jobs. \n\n2  Bangladesh has no unified definition of microenterprises. For this project, a microenterprise is defined as a business \n\nentity with investment of Tk40,000\u2013Tk1.5 million, excluding land and buildings used by the enterprise. \n\n3   The  share  of  female  entrepreneurs  is  estimated  to  comprise  about  29%  and  56%  of  the  manufacturing  and \n\nagribusiness sectors, respectively. \n\n4  Credit and Development Forum. 2017. Bangladesh Microfinance Statistics, 2016-17. Dhaka. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fdemand is gradually shifting from traditional microcredit to larger loans for nonfarm enterprises \n(microenterprise loans). In 2010, the MRA developed rules for MFIs on providing microenterprise \nloans: loans below Tk50,000 are defined as microcredit, while loans above Tk50,000 but below \nTk1 million are considered microenterprise loans. In 2017, MFIs provided microenterprise loans \nto  3.6  million  members  with  total  loans  outstanding  of  Tk239  billion.  Microenterprise  loans \ncomprise more than 31% of the total microfinance industry portfolio. \n \n7. \nMicroenterprises  and  their  challenges.  Microenterprises  in  Bangladesh  are  smaller \nthan small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and the size of their investments is too large \nfor traditional microcredit but too small for bank financing.5 Microenterprises can promote private \nsector-led rural  economic growth  by  developing forward  linkages  and  creating  self-  and  wage-\nemployment  opportunities,  but  they  face  nonfinancial  and  financial  constraints.  Nonfinancial \nconstraints  include  lack  of  infrastructure  facilities  and  utilities,  and  inflexible  regulations.6  The \nfinancial  constraint  of  limited  access  to  finance  is  by  far  the  greatest  constraint  in  developing \nmicroenterprises in Bangladesh.7 In addition, women microentrepreneurs face a different set of \nfinancial  and  nonfinancial  constraints,  including  lack  of  (i)  business  management  skills,  (ii) \nentrepreneurial and technical skills, (iii) start-up finance, (iv) information and access to networking \nsupport, and (v) self-confidence. \n \n8. \nMicroenterprises are financed largely by informal sources such as individual savings and \ninformal loans from friends and relatives. Institutional credit can play a role, but it has until recently \nbeen marginal. The share of own funds in total microenterprise investments is about 85%, the \nshare  of  banks  is  4%,  and  MFI  financing  is  11%  in  2015.  The  overall  microenterprise  loan \ndemand\u2013supply gap was about Tk437 billion in 2015.8 \n \n9. \nBanks and MFIs can be microenterprise financing sources. However, banks are unlikely \nto be a major source, because of (i) banks\u2019 limited knowledge and risk assessment capacity on \nmicroenterprises, (ii) banks\u2019 limited rural branch network and outreach, (iii) banks\u2019 preference for \nloans,  and \nlarge \n(iv) microenterprises\u2019 difficulty in securing valid loan collateral. \n \n10.  While MFIs can be a major source of financing for microenterprises, MFIs\u2019 microenterprise \nloans  are  not  keeping  pace  with  demand  because  of  (i)  MFIs\u2019  limited  funding  sources,  (ii)  the \nlimited  enabling  environment  for  MFIs\u2019  microenterprise  operations,  and  (iii)  MFIs\u2019  insufficient \nknowledge and capacity on microenterprise lending. \n \n11.  MFIs depend on donor grants or loans, member savings, and retained earnings as funding \nsources; and do not have sufficient access to other long-term funding. Most MFIs, especially small \nand medium-sized MFIs, have difficulty mobilizing commercial funding sources because of (i) high \n\nthe  high  cost  of  servicing  microenterprise \n\nloans  and \n\nindustrial \n\n                                                 \n5  Bangladesh Bank defines SME loans as loans from Tk50,000 to Tk5 million. For this project, a loan below Tk1 million \n\nis considered a microenterprise loan and a loan from Tk1 million to Tk5 million is an SME loan. \n\n6   For nonfinancial constraints, the government\u2019s strategies include, among others, creating an enabling environment \nfocusing  on  infrastructure,  rural  electrification,  gas  connection,  better  physical  and  electronic  communication \nservices,  education,  training  and  skills  formation,  technological  upgrading,  access  to  market  and  business \ndevelopment services.

To meet MFIs\u2019 funding needs, the government set up \nthe  PKSF  in  1990  as  a  microfinance  wholesaler  that  provides  loans  to  POs.  The  PKSF  is \nregistered as a not-for-profit company under the Companies Act, 1994 (Act No. 18) for poverty \nalleviation through sustainable employment generation. It has 277 POs with loans outstanding of \nTk44 billion in 2017, while loan disbursement totaled Tk31 billion and net income totaled Tk1.9 \nbillion  in  2017.  The  PKSF  has  been  an  important  funding  source  for  small  and  medium-sized \nMFIs. Its cumulative loan recovery rate was 99.34% at the end of FY2017.9 \n \n13. \nIn 2017, client savings, retained earnings, and other funds comprised 77% of total MFI \nfunding, followed by loans from commercial banks (16%) and the PKSF (5%). Funding from other \nsources, including donor funds and other grants, has been declining substantially and made up \nonly 2% of total MFI funding (footnote 4). MFIs are allowed by the MRA to mobilize only member \nsavings  and  not  public  deposits.  The  MRA  Rules  (2010)  also  impose  caps  on  MFIs\u2019 \nmicroenterprise loan volume and the mobilization of member savings. MFI operational guidelines \nare not fully adequate for microenterprise loans, and many MFIs have limited capacity to provide \nsuch loans. \n \nIn 2001, the PKSF started a microenterprise program to enable its POs to lend to members \n14. \nwho  have  graduated  from  microcredit  and  need  higher  capital  for  investments.  Under  the \nprogram, any business with an investment up to Tk1.5 million, excluding land and buildings, is \nconsidered a microenterprise.10 The PKSF reported that demand for microenterprise loans has \nbeen  steadily  growing.  The  number  of  microenterprise  loan  end-borrowers  from  PKSF  POs \nincreased from 189,528 in 2010 to 1.15 million at the end of 2017, of whom 70% are women. As \nof July 2017, the PKSF had cumulatively disbursed more than Tk405 billion in microenterprise \nloans to POs, with current loans outstanding of Tk13 billion. PKSF disbursements to POs under \nthe microenterprise program totaled Tk7.5 billion in FY2017. \n \n15.  With current funding levels, however, the PKSF and its POs can meet only part of their \nexisting members\u2019 demand. The PKSF estimates that 2.4 million members of existing POs are \neligible for microenterprise loans. The current average microenterprise loan size to end-borrowers \nis Tk95,000 and is likely to increase as borrowers\u2019 investment size grows. The PKSF projects that \nPOs\u2019  microenterprise  loan  demand  for  2018\u20132022  would  total  Tk107  billion,  but  its  internal \nonlending resources would be limited to Tk74 billion. This means the PKSF needs at least Tk33 \nbillion  for  2018\u20132022  just  to  meet  existing  POs\u2019  microenterprise  loan  demand.11  Thereby,  this \nproject would contribute approximately 13% of PKSF\u2019s funding gap. \n \n16. \nProposed  solution.  The  government  considers  the  PKSF\u2019s  access  to  affordable  long-\nterm funding as indispensable to solving microenterprise financing constraints. ADB will provide \na loan to ease mostly short-term microenterprise financing. The loan will be provided to the PKSF \nfor lending to POs based on eligibility criteria for further sub-lending to microenterprises. \n \nThe project design takes into account lessons from related ADB operations which highlight \n17. \nthe need to strengthen subproject performance monitoring and risk management measures, and \n\n                                                 \n9  Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation. http://www.pksf-bd.org.  \n10 The PKSF has its own definition for microenterprises, but MFIs normally identify microenterprises by loan size. \n11 For  2010\u20132017,  the  PKSF\u2019s  microenterprise  loan  disbursement  grew  20%  per  year  on  average.  With  external \nsources of funding, the PKSF estimates microenterprise loan demand to grow 33% per year during 2018\u20132022. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nemphasizes support for female entrepreneurs (footnote 16). For medium- to long-term solutions, \nthe project will assist the PKSF and its POs in enhancing their capacity in microenterprise lending \nand promoting sustainable operations (para. 23). Through the attached TA, the project will support \nthe PKSF and its POs in expanding MFIs\u2019 microenterprise development services (para. 35). The \nproject  will  also  espouse  gender  equity  and  target  a  loan  portfolio  with  at  least  70%  women \nborrowers (paras. 21, 43). \n \n18. \nValue added by ADB assistance. The project\u2019s key value addition is to transform PKSF \nand POs towards a more market oriented financing institutions. MFIs are rapidly expanding their \nmicroenterprise  portfolios  but  lack  essential  skills  to  make  enterprise  loans.  The  size  of \nmicroenterprise  loans  is  considerably  larger  than  traditional  microcredit;  and  MFIs  need  to  be \nequipped with appropriate risk assessment, credit appraisal, and financial management skills for \nmicroenterprise  finance.  The  project  will  also  strengthen  MFIs\u2019  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard  monitoring  by  installing  an  environmental  and  social  screening system  at  the  PKSF \nand its POs. Furthermore, the project will bring a technology innovation in POs by introducing a \npilot mobile-based microenterprise financing application (para. 24).  \n \n19. \nAlignment  of  the  Government  and  ADB  Strategies.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s  National  Sustainable  Development  Strategy,  2010-2021,  which  promotes  micro, \nsmall,  and  medium-sized  enterprise to generate job  opportunities.12  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy  for  Bangladesh,  2016\u20132020  identifies  improving  rural  livelihoods  and  expanding \nemployment  opportunities  as  key  priority  areas.13  The  project  is  based  on  ADB\u2019s  successful \nexperience in microfinance and SMEs, including projects with the PKSF.14  \n \nB. \n \n20. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: growth of microenterprises expanded to \nprovide forward linkages to agriculture and generate job opportunities.15 The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: microenterprises\u2019 access to MFI financing increased.16 \n \nC. \n \nOutput 1: Funding to microfinance institutions for microenterprise loans expanded. \n21. \nThis  output  will  provide  a  credit  line  to  the  PKSF  for  onlending  to  POs  to  ease  short-term \nmicroenterprise financing constraints. It aims to provide loans to 40,000 microentrepreneurs, of \nwhom 70% are female.17 The typical onlending rate is 5.0%\u20137.5% per year from the PKSF to POs \n                                                 \n12 Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2013.

The project will make sure that the POs have onlending rates that \nare adequate to cover all costs and risks associated with onlending, have an adequate margin, \nand comply with MRA regulations.  \n \n22. \nTo address medium-term financing constraints, the output will support the development of \na medium-term institutional strengthening and financing strategy for the PKSF. The strategy will \ninclude enhancing the PKSF\u2019s policies, risk assessment, due diligence, and financial and portfolio \nmanagement and monitoring; and assessing the feasibility of diversifying funding sources. \n \n23. \nOutput 2: Microfinance institutions\u2019 capacity in microenterprise lending enhanced. \nThe  output  will  enhance  MFI  capacity  in  microenterprise  lending  by  improving  microenterprise \nfinance  operational  guidelines  for  MFIs.  The  guidelines  will  have  methodologies  for  credit \nappraisal, pricing, terms and conditions, and financial and portfolio management and monitoring \nof  MFIs\u2019  microenterprise  finance  operations,  including  risk  management.  Improvement  of  the \nguidelines will be followed by training for the PKSF\u2019s POs. \n \n24. \nFor  selected  POs,  a  pilot  mobile-based  microenterprise  financing  application  will  be \nimplemented for activities such as loan application, appraisal, disbursement, and collection. For \nthe pilot project, support will include legal and regulatory consultation, application development \nor adoption, guidelines and manual development, and PO and client training. \n \n25. \ninstitutions\u2019  microenterprise  development  support \nextended. The output will support microenterprises\u2019 access to wider and upscale markets. It will \nidentify promising microenterprise products for potential expansion and support microenterprise \ncluster development by assisting in quality control, branding, packaging, and marketing.19 Priority \nwill  be  given  to  female  microenterprise  borrowers.  The  output  will  also  support  e-commerce \nplatform development for microenterprises. \n \nD. \n \n26. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $62.5  million  (Table  1).

The loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year;  and  such  other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on the straight-line \nmethod, the average maturity is 12.75 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \nADB will disburse the loan proceeds following its Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as \n28. \namended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  between  the  government  and \nADB. The advance fund procedure will be used based on the estimate of the eligible expenditures \nfor the forthcoming 6 months. To make sure that the ADB loan is used for its intended purpose, \nthe PKSF will maintain all POs\u2019 sub-borrower records. In addition, the PKSF and all POs funded \nunder the project will submit an audited statement of utilization of funds. \n \n29. \nRelending.  The  government  will  relend  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  to  the  PKSF  in  local \ncurrency at ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based interest rate plus 0.75% per year and a maturity of 20 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, under a subsidiary loan agreement. The government will bear \nthe foreign exchange risks. \n \nOnlending. The PKSF will onlend to selective POs for financing eligible microenterprise \n30. \nborrowers.  Onlending  rates from  the  PKSF  to  POs  are  7.5%  per  year for  POs  with  total  loans \noutstanding above Tk1.0 billion; 6.0% for POs with total loans outstanding of Tk0.5 billion\u2013Tk1.0 \nbillion; and 5.0% for POs with total loans outstanding below Tk0.5 billion. PKSF loans to POs will \nhave a 3-year maturity, including a 6-month grace period. \n \n31. \nSub-lending.  POs  will  finance  their  member  microenterprise  borrowers.  Loans  to \nmicroenterprise borrowers range from Tk50,000 to Tk1 million; the maturity will mostly be less \nthan  1  year  but  can  be  up  to  2  years.  The  repayment  schedule  will  depend  on  the  cash  flow \npattern of microenterprises. The maximum interest rate for the sub-loan is 25% per year based \non a declining balance.20 The loans repaid by POs will be maintained at the microenterprise fund \naccount  established  at  PKSF.  PKSF  will  onlend  to  POs  with  the  same  onlending  terms  and \nconditions by PKSF. \n \nE. \n \nThe Financial Institutions Division (FID) of the Ministry of Finance will  be the executing \n32. \nagency  and  the  PKSF  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  A  project  steering  committee  will  be \nformed by the government comprising the Economic Relations Division and Finance Division of \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  FID,  the  PKSF,  and  other  relevant  stakeholders.  The  steering \ncommittee  will  monitor  and  supervise  overall  project  implementation  and  provide  guidance  on \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n                                                 \n20 A declining balance interest rate is calculated based on the outstanding principal loan amount. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fmajor  project  implementation  issues.

Its outcome and outputs align \nwith  the  loan.  The  TA  will  support  (i)  developing  the  PKSF\u2019s  medium-term  institutional \nstrengthening  and  financing  strategy  and  building  capacity  at  the  PKSF,  (ii)  improving \nmicroenterprise finance operational guidelines for MFIs and providing MFI training, (iii) initiating \na  pilot  mobile-based  microenterprise  financing  application  for  selected  POs,  (iv)  supporting \nmicroenterprise cluster development, and (v) developing a microenterprise e-commerce platform. \n \n36. \nThe TA  will  require  inputs from the following  international  experts:  technical  advisor for  \nMicroenterprise  Development  Project  (3  person-months),  microenterprise  finance  specialist  (3 \nperson-months), and e-commerce specialist (3 person-months); and from the following national \nexperts:  mobile  microfinance  specialist  (6  person-months),  microenterprise  development \n\n                                                 \n21 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fspecialist (4 person-months), and financial analysis specialist (6 person-months). Procurement \nwill follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated \nstaff  instructions.  ADB  will  procure  consulting  services  using  open  competitive  bidding \nprocedures. \n \n37. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Partnership  Special  Fund.22  The  PKSF  will  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. Disbursement \nwill follow ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). The TA will be implemented over 2 years. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n38. \nADB assessed the selected POs\u2019 technical capacity to make microenterprise loans. POs \nhave dedicated staff and established procedures for loan appraisal, loan sanction, and portfolio \nmonitoring and reporting for microenterprise loans. Further support to improve MFI capacity for \nmicroenterprise  financing  is  needed,  however,  particularly  for  client  due  diligence,  credit  risk \nassessment, portfolio monitoring, and the management information system. For this, the project \nwill support the PKSF and its POs through the attached TA. \n \nB. \n \nThe project will directly benefit at least 40,000 microenterprises in Bangladesh, of which \n39. \n70% are female borrowers, by providing a reliable and affordable institutional source of finance. \nIn doing so, the project greatly economizes the beneficiaries\u2019 fund costs and promotes the efficient \nallocation of finance, thus yielding a higher rate of return from the beneficiaries\u2019 microenterprise \ninvestments.23 \n \nC. \n \nADB requirements and policies on financial management and procurement measures, and \n40. \nenvironmental and social safeguards, were discussed and agreed with the government and the \nPKSF and incorporated in the project design. The specific requirements are described in the PAM. \nProcurement  of  goods,  works,  and  non-consultancy  services  will  follow  the  ADB  Procurement \nPolicy  and  the  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime). Procurement will  be undertaken by the individual beneficiary; fitness for purpose can be \nachieved by using established private sector and commercial practices. \n \nThe financial management risk is moderate. Based on financial due diligence, the PKSF \n41. \nneeds  to  strengthen  its capacity  particularly  its management  information  system. The financial \nmanagement assessment, which includes a financial analysis of POs, indicated that the PKSF \nhas  sufficient  experience  in  managing  similar  projects  for  ADB  and  other  international \ndevelopment partners and has the necessary financial management arrangements. The PKSF\u2019s \nPOs, however, potentially have key financial management risks, such as (i) insufficient quality of \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                 \n22 Established by ADB. Financing partner: the Government of Luxembourg. \n23 The  project  beneficiaries\u2019  only  alternative  source  of  funding,  apart  from  relatives  and  friends,  is  informal \nmoneylenders who typically charge more than 120% per year. The project provides cost-efficient and reliable access \nto finance for the beneficiaries. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nPOs\u2019  audit  and financial  statements,  and  (ii)  inadequate  POs\u2019  portfolio  management  practices. \nThe attached TA will address these issues. \n \n42. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  PKSF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \nD. \n \n43. \nThe project is expected to have a tangible employment generation impact on the poor and \nlow-income population by establishing and expanding microenterprises. The estimated monthly \nincome of microenterprise workers in manufacturing, processing, or services ranges from Tk4,000 \nfor  part-time  workers  to  Tk15,000  for  full-time  workers.24  Considering  Bangladesh\u2019s  per  capita \ngross national income in FY2017 was Tk127,401, the project is expected to contribute to poverty \nreduction by increasing rural household incomes.25 The project has a strong focus on developing \nwomen-led  microenterprises  and  will  develop  MFI  capacity  in  conducting  women-focused \nmicroenterprise financing. The project is classified gender equity as a theme.26 \n \nE. \n \n44. \ncategories are as follows: 27 \n \n45. \nEnvironment  (category  FI  treated  as  C).  The  project  is  expected  to  have  minimal \nenvironmental impact since sub-loans to microenterprises will be mainly for light manufacturing, \ntrade, and service activities. \n \n46. \ninvoluntary resettlement will be financed.  \n \n47. \nTribes, minor races, ethnic sects and communities (category FI treated as C). Sub-\nloans  are  for  activities  that  will  not  have  any  impact  on  tribes,  minor  races,  ethnic  sects  and \ncommunities.28 \n \n48. \nThe PKSF has developed environmental and social screening guidelines for POs, which \nwere agreed by ADB.
