It will focus on developing 125,000 hectares (ha) of new, highly efficient and \nclimate-resilient irrigation networks and productive command area under the Kundalia Irrigation \nProject  (KIP).  It  will  also  finance  a  feasibility  study  and  detailed  designs  for  modernizing  the \nexisting Sanjay Sarovar Irrigation Project (SSIP).1   \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nIndia requires irrigation water use efficiency and productivity improvement. Water \n3. \nplays  a  critical  role  in  India\u2019s  food  security  and  welfare  of  the  rural  poor  as  84%  of  all  water \nwithdrawals are dedicated to agriculture and 42% of all agricultural land is irrigated. India benefits \nfrom only 4% of the world\u2019s renewable fresh water but has 16% of the world\u2019s population.2 With \nintense urbanization and industrialization, the need for water from the nonagriculture sector is fast \nincreasing  and  water  shortage  is  becoming  a  major  concern  for  industries.  At  the  same  time, \npopulation growth and change in dietary habits require continued growth in agricultural production. \nBy 2050, annual water availability per capita in India is expected to drop from 1,530 cubic meters \nto 1,140 cubic meters, indicating severe water stress.3 The current average irrigation water use \nefficiency of 38% points towards the need for serious performance improvement in this sector.4 \nThe productivity of irrigation water is further hampered by low crop yields and cultivation of low- \nvalue  crops.  Therefore,  most  of  India\u2019s  utilized  water  not  only  supports  activities  with  low \neconomic value but is also inefficiently used. In the meantime, water shortages are constraining \nwater-dependent power production and the development of high-value industries that are required \nto fuel the country\u2019s economic growth. These problems will worsen in the future with the projected \nimpacts of population and economic growth, and with climate change, which will increase both \nirrigation water demand and uncertainty around the reliability of water resources.  \n\n4. \nIrrigation  modernization  is  a  key  strategy  to  reducing  water  wastage.  The \nGovernment of India recognizes the situation. Both the Three Year Action Agenda (2017\u20132018 to \n2019\u20132020)5 and the 2015 Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana program have acknowledged \nthe necessity to improve water use efficiency in irrigation.6 In 2014, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  funded  the  Scoping  Study  for  a  National  Water  Use  Efficiency  Improvement  Support \nProgram.7 The  study  identified  the  following  three  main  causes  for  low  water  use  efficiency: \n(i) inadequate  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure  because  of  faulty  designs  and  lack  of \nmaintenance; (ii) inadequate management,  operation and maintenance  (MOM)  of  the  irrigation \nsystems;  and  (iii) inadequate  capacity  building  and  training  services.  The  study  highlights  the \nneed  to  modernize  the  design  and  management  of  major-  and  medium-sized  irrigation  (MMI) \n\n                                                \n1   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Madhya  Pradesh \n\nIrrigation Efficiency Improvement Project (TA 9051-IND).  \n\n2  T.

It  proposed  a  framework  for  assessing  and  improving  water  use  efficiency  on  MMI \nschemes.  Under  a  subsequent  regional  technical  assistance,  the  framework  was  successfully \npilot  tested  on  such  schemes  within  South  Asia.  The  study  also  developed  comprehensive \nmodernization strategies for existing irrigation systems and recommended a tailored investment \nplan for the SSIP.8   \n\n5. \nMadhya  Pradesh  plan  to  expand  and  modernize  irrigation.  Since  2010,  the \nGovernment  of  Madhya  Pradesh  has  embarked  on  an  ambitious  irrigation  expansion  and \ninfrastructure  modernization  and  substantial \nmodernization  plan.  New  developments, \nmanagement and operation improvement led to an increase in net irrigation area from 0.85 million \nha in 2006 to 3.6 million ha in 2017\u20132018. These efforts have been rewarded by record annual \nagricultural growth of 20%  in 2013\u20132016. The state plans to further increase the total irrigated \narea to 7.2 million ha by 2025. This will be achieved by maximizing irrigation efficiency and water \nproductivity in both new and existing irrigation systems. It includes development of pressurized \nirrigation, adoption of micro-irrigation and production of high-value crops. The state has set the \nambitious target of developing pressurized irrigation in 80% of all irrigated areas by 2025. The \nplan is estimated to cost $20 billion. \n\n6. \nThe  Water  Resources  Department  Madhya  Pradesh  (MPWRD)  has  requested  ADB \nassistance to help finance this plan and, more importantly, to provide advice on developing highly \nefficient  and  sustainable  model  for  MMI  schemes  that  will  serve  as  reference  for  future \nmodernization investments. The KIP will include the design and construction of a highly efficient \nand productive new pressurized irrigation system with automated volumetric control for efficient, \nreliable and flexible water delivery services. The KIP will be supplied by the reservoir being built \nunder the Kundalia Major Multipurpose Project (KMMP). Modernization being conducted under \nthe  SSIP  will  include  (i) upgrading  infrastructure  to  improve  conveyance  efficiency  and  flow \nregulation, and (ii) extending the command area and partially converting to pressurized irrigation \nand micro-irrigation.9  \n\nInnovation and ADB value addition. The project supports both technical and institutional \n7. \ninnovations.  The  technical  innovation  involves  designing  and  constructing  a  very  large  scale \npressurized  and  automated  irrigation  system  that  will  allow  considerable  gains  in  water  use \nefficiency.  On  the  institutional  side,  the  project  introduces  the  design\u2013build\u2013operate  (DBO) \ncontracting modality. There are very few examples of irrigation DBO contracts in India and none \non such large systems and with such a long MOM period. The DBO approach addresses critical \nlessons from past projects. It aims to address recurrent public sector inefficiencies in irrigation \nMOM. The DBO modality will also substantially enhance irrigation service delivery to farmers and \nencourage contractors to build quality and efficient irrigation systems to reduce MOM costs. Value \nadded by ADB assistance consists of providing state of the art technical support for designing the \nKIP  and  SSIP,  supervising  KIP  construction,  MOM  and agriculture  support  services,  preparing \nDBO bidding documents and providing support for efficient management of the DBO contracts. \nThe current limited expertise of MPWRD with pressurized irrigation, irrigation modernization and \nperformance-based irrigation management will be substantially enhanced through the project. \n\n8. \nThe project is consistent with the objectives of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2018\u2013\n2022  for  India.10 It  will  support  the  country\u2019s  Three  Year  Action  Agenda  (2017\u20132018  to  2019\u2013\n\n                                                \n8   ADB. 2011.

The KIP will consist \nof two large pumping stations pumping water to distribution chambers from where water will be \ndistributed by gravity pressure through a network of buried pipelines that gradually reduce in size \nup to end user and/or farm outlets (hydrants every 1\u20132 ha). The system is designed to provide \npressure of 200 kilopascal at the outlet for field micro-irrigation systems. \n\nOutput  2:  Kundalia \n\n11. \nIrrigation  Project  performance-based  operation  and \nmaintenance established. This output will be delivered by contracting a private sector operator \nunder a DBO contract. The contractor will be tasked to operate and maintain the system for a \nperiod of 5 years after completion of the construction. During this period the contractor will need \nto meet several performance indicators related to system leakage, electricity consumption, and \nnoninterruption of operation. The contractor will  provide on-the-job training to MPWRD staff.  A \nsupervisory control and data acquisition system and a decision support system will be installed to \nfacilitate the MOM of the system.  \n\n12. \nOutput  3:  Farmers  capacity  for rapid  uptake of micro-irrigation  technology  in  the \nKundalia  Irrigation  Project  command  area  enhanced.  This  output  will  be  achieved  by \n(i) establishing and building the capacity of the water users\u2019 associations, (ii) establishing micro-\nirrigation farm demonstration sites, and (iii) establishing farmers\u2019 service centers and conducting \nfarmers\u2019 field schools to support adoption of micro-irrigation and productive irrigated agriculture \nincluding  high-value  crops.  These  activities  will  be  carried  out  by  the  DBO  contractor(s)  in  a \ncollaborative  relationship  with  government  agencies  and  stakeholders.  The  DBO  contracts \ninclude performance guarantees for the area equipped with micro-irrigation systems at year 1, 3 \nand 5 after commissioning.  \n\n13. \nOutput 4: Modernization of the Sanjay Sarovar Irrigation Project well-designed with \nproject readiness criteria met. This output will be achieved by (i) preparing a comprehensive \nSSIP modernization plan, (ii) undertaking a feasibility study and detailed design of the proposed \nplan,  (iii)  developing  an  institutional  strategy  to  enhance  the  performance  and  sustainability  of \nSSIP MOM, (iv) preparing bidding documents for the modernization works and consultant request \nfor  proposal  for  the  ensuing  project  implementation  and  construction  quality  supervision,  and \n(v) supporting MPWRD and ADB to meet the project processing requirements. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n11  Defined by the project. \n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nD. \n \n14. \n\nItem \n\nA.  \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $535.71 million (Table 1). \n\n15. \nDetailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by  financier  are  included  in  the \nproject  administration  manual. 13  Major  expenditure  items  include  (i)  civil  works  and  electro-\nmechanical equipment for the construction of the KIP, (ii)  a project management unit including \nstaff  and  recurrent  expenditures,  (iii)  agriculture  support  services,  (iv)  environment  and  social \nmitigation for temporary and permanent land acquisition and implementation of the environment \nmanagement plan (EMP) under the KIP, (v) KIP MOM, and (vi) consulting services for MPWRD \ncapacity  building  and  preparation  of  the  feasibility  study  and  detailed  design  for  the  SSIP \nModernization.  \n\nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nBase Costb \nKundalia Irrigation Project infrastructure constructed \n1. \n2.

The KIP was \ninitially envisaged to cover 58,000 ha, of which 45,000 ha would have been gravity irrigation with \ncanals  and  13,000  ha  lift  irrigation.  In  2015,  MPWRD  decided  to  convert  the  KIP  to  a  100% \npumped pressurized pipeline system for spray and micro-irrigation.  \n\n21. \nThe feasibility design for the pressurized distribution system, including pumping stations, \nelectrical  substations  and  power  supply  systems,  transmission  pipelines,  valves,  controls  and \nassociated structures, was planned under the project preparatory technical assistance. Design \ncriteria were selected to allow delivery of reliable and flexible irrigation service with a pressurized \nwater  outlet  at  every  1\u20132  ha.  The  system  was  conceived  to  achieve  80%  overall  irrigation \nefficiency.  With  such  gain  in  efficiency,  the  water  balance  assessment  confirmed  the  KIP \ncommand area can be extended to 125,000 ha to provide full irrigation services in the rabi season \nand  protective  irrigation  in  the  wet  season.  Several  design  options  were  studied.  The  best \ncompromise in terms of energy consumption, construction cost and robustness to local conditions \nwas retained as the base design. The power requirement is estimated at 63 megawatts. MPWRD \ninitially  envisaged  building  a  solar  power  plant  as  part  of  the  project  to  offset  the  power \nrequirement  of  the  KIP  scheme.  However,  construction  of  the  plant  was  deferred  as  Madhya \nPradesh has a large excess in generation capacity that remains unutilized and for which the state \npays  compensation  charges  to  private  companies.  In  addition,  the  state  is  finalizing  a  750-\nmegawatt public\u2013private partnership project for solar power generation. The KIP design provides \na  smart  water  management  system  to  increase  management  efficiency  and  reduce  energy \nconsumption. This includes (i) a supervisory control and data acquisition system to monitor and \ncontrol flow remotely throughout the command area, and (ii) a decision support system with an \nirrigation planning and scheduling database to help organize efficient water distribution.  \n\nincrease),  and  changes \n\n22. \nThe  overall  climate-related  risk  associated  with  the  project  was  rated  as  high  by  the \nAWARE rapid climate screening tool, mainly because of high risks associated with temperature \nincrease  (and  related  evapotranspiration \nin  rainfall  patterns. \nConsequently, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment  was undertaken to analyze this risk \nmore  rigorously  and  assess  the  need  for  and  economic  feasibility  of  potential  adaptation \nmeasures.  The  assessment  confirmed  likely  increase  in  irrigation  demand  in  the  dry  season \nbecause  of  an  increase  in  temperature.  This  increase  in  irrigation  water  demand  can  be  met \nthrough  additional  groundwater  pumping.  The  aquifer  sustainable  yield  will  only  be  exceeded \nunder the most pessimistic climate change scenario. In such a case, a 1.5% reduction in area \nplanted with high water-use crops like oranges will be required towards the end of the economic \nlifetime  of  the  project.  The  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment  studied  the  economic \nfeasibility  of  alternative measures to  actively  increase  the  availability  of  irrigation  water. These \nincluded infrastructure investments aiming to increase the supply of irrigation water, and initiatives \nto  reduce  irrigation  water  demand  from  farmers.  The  only  measure  considered  economically \nfeasible  is  the  provision  of  agricultural  training  and  field  pilot  demonstrations  to  advance  the \nplanting  time  of  rabi  crops  and  benefit  from  residual  soil  moisture  from  the  monsoon.  This \nadditional adaptation measure is included under the project design.  \n\n \n\n\fB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic  analysis.  An  economic  analysis  was  prepared  for  the  entire  KMMP.15 The \n23. \neconomic net present value (discounted at the assumed economic opportunity cost of capital of \n9%) of the project is estimated at \u20b938.5 billion indicating that the KMMP is economically feasible. \nThe same conclusion can be derived from the project\u2019s economic internal rate of return (EIRR), \nwhich is estimated at 15.7%, well above the minimum required rate of 9.0%. Increased agricultural \nproduction  is the  most  important  source  of quantifiable economic  benefits,  accounting for  over \n95% of total benefits. The development of irrigation will support change in cropping patterns from \nlow-value  crops  towards  high-value  crops  such  as  vegetables  and  oranges.  It  will  support  an \nincrease  in  cropping  intensity  from  132%  to  180%,  thereby  extending  the  harvested  area  by \n59,500  ha.  More  importantly,  sufficient  and  reliable  irrigation  supply  will  boost  yields  by  10%\u2013 \n50%  depending  on  crop  type.  Benefits  from  increased  raw  water  provision  accounts  for  the \nremainder.   \n\n24. \nSensitivity tests were conducted by varying the project\u2019s investment cost, MOM cost, and \nbenefits. The results of the analysis indicate that the economic feasibility of the KMMP is more \nsensitive to unfavorable changes to economic benefits than to the investment cost. If the benefits \nare 43.8% lower or the investment cost is 127.5% higher than in the base case, the EIRR will fall \nbelow 9.0%. The project\u2019s EIRR is relatively insensitive to changes to the  MOM cost. A Monte \nCarlo  simulation  indicates  that  the  EIRR  has  a  negligible  likelihood  of  dropping  below  the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital, even if benefits would be 50% lower and costs 50% higher \nthan in the base case.16 \n\n25. \nFinancial  analysis.  MPWRD  is  considering  a  gradual  increase  in  the  current  tariff  for \npressurized irrigation from \u20b91,000 to \u20b910,900 (in constant October 2017 prices, per ha per year). \nAt this much higher tariff, the financial internal rate of return of the KMMP is estimated at \u20135.7%, \nwhich  is  lower  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (2.2%).  This  is  mainly  because  the \nproposed  incremental  tariff  does  not  include  repayment  of  the  capital  costs.  For  projects \nimplemented by government sector units such as MPWRD, the financial analysis focuses on the \ncapacity to finance the incremental recurrent costs which are required for the sustainability of the \ninvestment. Despite the low financial internal rate of return the project is worth supporting based \non the large economic development benefits as indicated by the high estimated EIRR, the positive \nimpact on the state economy, and the substantial positive effect on reducing rural poverty in the \nKIP command area.  \n\n26. \nThe proposed tariff was set to cover the full cost of routine MOM by 2026.  MPWRD would \nonly need to subsidize the MOM expenditure during 2021\u20132025 (about \u20b91.2 billion in total for the \n5-year period) and in 2050, the year in which hydraulic steel structures and mechanical equipment \nwill be replaced (about \u20b93.9 billion). A review of MPWRD MOM annual budgets has indicated that \nMPWRD would be able to cover these costs.  The state government has committed to adopt the \nappropriate tariff scheme and to cover for any MOM budget shortfalls. This has been included as \na loan covenant. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nFinancial  management.  A financial  management  assessment  of  MPWRD  was carried \n27. \nout  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of \nProjects.17 The overall risk assessment for the project is moderate. MPWRD has experience in \n\n                                                \n15 Because  the  construction  of  the  dam  is  needed  to  realize  the  economic  benefits  of  the  pipeline  network  and \npressurized distribution system, the economic analysis covered the entire KMMP, and not only the component that \nwill be cofinanced by ADB. \n\n16  A  Monte  Carlo  simulation  is  a  mathematical  technique  that  generates  random  variables  for  modelling  risk  or \n\nuncertainty of a certain system. \n\n17 ADB. 2005.

Hence,  MPWRD  will  appoint  experienced  accounting  staff  to  the \nproject.  A  financial  management  consultant  will  be  provided  under  the  project  to  prepare  a \ndetailed procedure manual and undertake trainings on ADB\u2019s policies and guidelines. MPWRD \nwill recruit independent audit firms to undertake periodical internal audits of the project accounts. \nThe project accounts will be audited annually by the state Controller and General Auditor.  \n\n28. \nProcurement.  MPWRD  organized  consultation  workshops  and  a  roadshow  during  the \nproject  design  to  appraise  private  sector  interest  and  capacity  to  undertake  DBO  contracts \nincluding  agriculture  support  services.  The  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). All recruitment of consultants will \nfollow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  A \nprocurement capacity assessment concluded that the overall procurement risk for the project is \nmoderate. International and national procurement specialists were provided as part of the project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  to  prepare  the  two  DBO  bidding  documents,  support  the \nevaluation  process  and  assist  with  the  consultants\u2019  recruitment.  Funds  were  allocated  in  the \nproject to provide procurement training to the implementing agency. In addition, India Resident \nMission trained MPWRD staff on ADB\u2019s procurement and consultant recruitment guidelines. \n\n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MPWRD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 13). \n\nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n30. \nOver  40%  of  the  population  in  the  KIP\u2019s  future  cultivable  command  area  depends  on \nagriculture  for  their  livelihoods.  Wheat  and  soybeans  are  the  two  main  crops  followed  by \nchickpeas (pulses), spices, oranges, and vegetables. While agricultural growth has substantially \nincreased in the state over the last 5 years, it has stagnated in the project area because of a lack \nof  irrigation  development.  The  KIP  is  expected  to  improve  farmers\u2019  net  incomes  and  directly \nbenefit  about  838,262  people  in  419  villages  in  Rajgarh  and  Agar  Malwa  districts  of  Madhya \nPradesh. In general, it will also provide economic opportunities to improve nonfarm rural incomes, \nand this will indirectly contribute to development and poverty reduction. The project poverty impact \nratio  was  estimated  at  30.1%.  This  represents  the  proportion  of  the  net  economic  benefits \ndesigned  to  go  to  the  poor  compared  to  total  project  net  economic  benefits.  The  project  is \nclassified  as  having  some  gender  elements,  where  women  will  benefit  from  skills  training  for \nfarmers in improved agricultural practices using the new irrigation systems. \n\nThe contractors will be required to strictly implement government requirements regarding \n31. \nhealth and safety of men and women who work at the construction sites. The contractors, in close \ncoordination with the project management unit, will conduct awareness programs on prevention \nof sexually transmitted diseases and drug use. The contractor will be required to strictly implement \nequal pay for female and male workers.  \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n32. \nsafeguard categories are as follows.18 \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  (SPS),  the  project\u2019s \n\n33. \nEnvironment (category B). The initial environmental examination including its EMP has \nbeen prepared. The project\u2019s initial environmental examination identified that most impacts\u2014such \nas noise, dust, impacts on vegetation because of land clearing and excavation\u2014occur during the \nconstruction periods. Mitigation measures were included accordingly in the EMP. Stakeholders \nhave  been  consulted  and  will  continue  to  be  consulted  during  implementation.  A  grievance \n                                                \n18  ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n\n\fredress mechanism to address both social and environmental issues will be established prior to \nproject implementation.  \n\n34. \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (category  B).  Permanent  land  acquisition  is  limited  for  the \npumping stations and distribution chambers. Most land acquisition will be temporary for laying the \nirrigation pipelines underground and this will affect land owners during construction. Two sample \nresettlement plans (land acquisition plans) were prepared. One resettlement plan was prepared \nfor distribution pipes covering 500 ha of cultivable command area that will affect 96 households \nand  requires  4.81  ha  of  land  (4.78  ha  of  temporary  acquisition,  and  0.03  ha  of  permanent \nacquisition). The second resettlement plan was prepared for installing a pumping station, which \nwill affect 25 households and require 31.14 ha of land, 2.21 ha of which is private land. For the \nrest of the project areas, the DBO contractors will prepare the resettlement plan(s) in accordance \nwith  the  project\u2019s  resettlement  framework.  The  resettlement  framework  for  this  project  was \nprepared to guide the preparation of the resettlement plan(s) during project implementation. The \nsample  resettlement  plans  and  resettlement  framework  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \nADB SPS, Madhya Pradesh Pipeline Act (2013), the Madhya Pradesh Consent Land Purchase \nPolicy  (2014),  and  the  Indian  land  legislation  on  The  Right  to  Fair  Compensation  and \nTransparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act (2013).   \n\n35. \nResettlement plans prepared by the DBO contractor will be reviewed and cleared by ADB. \nMPWRD  has  adequate  capacity  to  implement  the  resettlement  plan  and  environmental \nsafeguards,  since  it  is  currently  implementing  projects  with  significant  resettlement  and \nenvironmental  concerns.  The  grievance  redress  mechanism  that  has  been  established  for \nMPWRD\u2019s current project will also be established for this ADB-funded project. \n\nIndigenous Peoples (category C). There are no indigenous peoples, as defined by the \n\n36. \nADB SPS in the project-affected areas.  \n\n37. \n Associated facility. The water required for the irrigation network constructed under the \nproposed  project  will  be  supplied  from  the  KMMP  reservoir.  Therefore,  the  KMMP  reservoir  is \nconsidered as an associated facility. Due diligence was undertaken to assess the suitability of \nmeasures  undertaken  under  the  KMMP  in  addressing  the  environmental  impacts.  The  due \ndiligence found that the KMMP planning and construction followed the guidance provided in the \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  and  EMP  that  was  approved  by  Ministry  of  Environment, \nForest, and Climate Change in January 2015. The environmental impact assessment and EMP \nfor the KMMP has comprehensively addressed its environmental impacts and is in line with ADB \nSPS requirements. MPWRD has allocated adequate resources to implement the EMP and other \nassociated plans. Therefore, no corrective action or additional actions need to be adopted under \nthe KMMP. \n\nF. \n\nSummary of Risks Assessment and Risk Management Plan  \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\n38. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.19  \n\nRisks \nBenefits of the project will be reduced if water \nmanagement \nif  a \nsignificant majority of the farmers do not adopt \nmicro-irrigation. \n\nimproved  and \n\nis  not \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nMitigating Measures \nThe  DBO  contractor  will  be  tasked  to  provide  farmers  support \nservices including WUA strengthening and extensive agricultural \nsupport  program  component,  with  field  demonstrations  and \nexperiential  training.
