THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the Agartala City Urban Development Project.  The report also describes the proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Development  for  the  Agartala  City  Urban \nDevelopment Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.\n2. The project will support the Government of Tripura (GOT) by improving Agartala\u2019s urban \nmobility and livability through (i) constructing 23 kilometers (km) of climate-resilient roads and \nenhancing  48  km  of  stormwater  drainage,  (ii)  renewing  emblematic  open  spaces,\n(iii) strengthening the knowledge and capacity of Agartala Municipal Corporation (AMC) to ensure\nimproved urban service delivery, and (iv) building capacity and raising awareness of communities\nand public health agencies.\nII. THE PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n3. The State of Tripura, in northeast India, is primarily agrarian. Only 27% of the land area is\ncultivable but 42% of the population depends on agriculture and related activities. The economy\nis characterized by low per capita income ($1,818 in 2017), low capital formation, inadequate\ninfrastructure facilities, high unemployment, geographical isolation, communication bottlenecks,\nslow progress in industrial fields, and inadequate use of natural resources.1 Across the urban\nlocal bodies, the average coverage of the sewage network is 29%, solid waste management is\n38%, and stormwater drainage network is 58%.2\n4. Agartala, the capital and largest city of Tripura, is the second-largest city and municipal\nbody in the northeastern states and one of the fastest-developing cities in India. An annual\npopulation growth rate of 2.94% (2001\u20132017) resulted in 581,960 inhabitants and a population\ndensity of 10,119 per square kilometer in 2018. In Agartala, 88% of the population has access to\nwater, and although 98% of the population has access to individual toilets, only 20% of the city\narea is covered by sewage network. The stormwater drainage network covers 55% of the city\narea and door-to-door municipal solid waste collection efficiency is 55%. Of the total road length,\n50% has right-of-way (ROW) of 8\u201310 meters (m), 36% has a ROW of more than 10 m, and the\nremaining 14% has ROWs of less than 8 m. Located only 2 km from the Bangladesh border and\non the Bangladesh\u2013Bhutan\u2013India\u2013Nepal economic corridor, Agartala could take advantage of\nfuture infrastructure developments by increasing trade and commerce. The city seeks to establish\nitself as an economic\u2013commercial hub for northeast India and a city of excellence by alleviating\ntraffic congestion and preserving and promoting its natural and cultural assets.3\n5. However, economic growth in the city is limited, largely because of poor infrastructure and\ndegraded livability. Haphazard development has led to pockets of high population density where\npressure on urban services is acute. Agartala lies on the bank of Haora River, which receives\nfloodwater from the major rivers of Bangladesh. The deficient drainage system results in overflows\nthat flood the city\u2019s low-lying areas during the monsoon season. Key problems facing Agartala\n1  Government of Tripura, Directorate of Economics and Statistics Planning (Statistics) Department. 2017. Economic \nReview of Tripura 2017\u20132018.

Agartala. \n3  This statement is part of Agartala Municipal Corporation\u2019s vision and goals: Agartala Municipal Corporation. ", "2 \ninclude (i) limited urban mobility arising from inadequacies in the road network, parking system, \ntraffic  management,  and  encroachment  onto  footpaths,  which  lead  to  an  increased  traffic \ncongestion and accidents; (ii) inadequate stormwater drainage causing floods; and (iii) deficient \nwastewater network with many sewer lines open to water bodies polluting the environment. \n \n6.  Tripura enjoys scenic beauty, and as the only northeastern state with royal palaces, it is \nemerging as a tourist destination. Tripura received 0.5 million visitors (21% foreigners) in FY2019, \nof which 0.2 million visited tourist attractions in Agartala. Tourism has been identified as one of \nTripura\u2019s \u201cthrust\u201d sector industries to boost the local and state economy and promote ecotourism \nand heritage tourism.4 However, although Agartala is the major gateway, tourism growth has been \nunorganized and unplanned, leading to uneven and suboptimal development of the tourism \neconomy. For tourism to contribute effectively to the economy, improvements in the quality of the \nenvironment,  development  of  tourist  destinations  and  related  services  and  amenities, road \nconnectivity, and community mobilization are essential. \n \n7.  The project is part of the Government of India\u2019s national Smart Cities Mission (SCM) \nprogram, launched in 2015 in collaboration with the states.5 The SCM is envisaged as a vehicle \nto drive economic growth and improve the quality of life of the people by enabling local area \ndevelopment  to  improve  livability,  harness  technology,  and  promote  new  developments  to \naccommodate the expanding population in urban areas.6 Agartala is one of the 100 cities chosen \nby the government under the SCM.7 The GOT established Agartala Smart City Limited (ASCL) to \nimplement the smart city components, such as an integrated command and control center, an \nintegrated intelligent traffic management system and surveillance, and a rapid transit system.8 \nASCL hands over facilities constructed under the SCM to the concerned agencies, which are \nresponsible for operation and maintenance (O&M) following the completion of construction. The \nUrban Development Department (UDD) oversees ASCL\u2019s activities. Under SCM projects, UDD is \nresponsible for facilitating the improvement of urban infrastructure, coordinating, facilitating the \nefficient and effective functioning of urban local bodies, and addressing the occupational and \nsocial vulnerabilities of urban poor. The Tripura Urban Planning and Development Authority \n(TUDA) is responsible for ensuring the planned development of urban, suburban, and semi-urban \nareas in Tripura. The project advances Tripura\u2019s involvement in the SCM initiative by developing \nAgartala\u2019s central and north zones as models of area-based development. This is expected to \nhave a ripple effect on other parts of the city and nearby cities and towns by making urban areas \nmore livable, citizen-friendly, resilient, and sustainable.9 \n \n8.  Alignment  with Asian  Development  Bank  and  country  priorities. The  project  is \naligned with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy for India, 2018\u2013\n2022 through its support for urban investments with focus on vitalizing the government\u2019s smart \ncities initiative and investments in municipal infrastructure, and improving economic resilience to \n \n4  Government of Tripura, Department of Tourism. 2019.

Lessons. The project will build upon the experience and lessons of the successfully \ncompleted  North  Eastern  Region  Capital  Cities  Development  Investment  Program 13  by \n(i)  ensuring technical robustness; (ii) incorporating a 5-year O&M period in all construction-related \noutputs to ensure sustainability; (iii) confirming high project readiness and providing adequate \npreparation support to avoid downstream delays; (iv) supporting capacity building of project \nmanagement unit (PMU) staff on project implementation particularly in procurement, contract \nmanagement,  financial  management,  and  safeguards;  (v)  complementing  infrastructure \ninvestments with strong capacity building for increased urban service delivery; (vi) using a robust \ncommunication, community consultation, and awareness-raising approach to ensure behavior \nchange and longer sustainability of assets; (vii) incorporating disaster risk reduction and climate \nchange-resilient measures into project designs; and (viii) including gender action plan (GAP) \ntargets based on available and verified baselines.  \n \n10.  Coronavirus disease. The government is leading efforts to minimize the spread and \nimpact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and cities are complementing these initiatives. The \nstates and cities play a key role in the economic and public health recovery. The project supports \nthese efforts through (i) improved urban services and infrastructure, with the construction of a \ndrainage system, which is essential for safe sanitation and hygiene; and (ii) behavior change \ncommunication and public awareness campaigns on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH).14 \nThe project will provide skilled and unskilled jobs during construction and O&M phases. It will also \nstimulate micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in the local economy that face severe \nhardships, thereby helping reduce the percentage of the poor and vulnerable in the population. \n \n10 ADB. 2017.

Technical due diligence found that all components are technically robust and adequately \naddress the key issues facing the project area, including feasibility studies, site investigations, \nand cost estimates. The technical appraisal of the components was based on (i) a comprehensive \nreview of the rationale, relevance, benefits, proposed designs, and ease and sustainability of \nimplementation and O&M; (ii) a technical alternatives comparison; (iii) life cycle costs including \ncapital and operating costs and attainable cost savings, including climate change and disaster-\nresilience measures; (iv) minimizing adverse environmental, heritage, and social impacts; and (v) \noptimizing implementation timelines through high project readiness. Contractors and consultants \nwill provide O&M training. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n25.  Economic viability. The economic rationale for the government\u2019s intervention is sound, \nas the project aims to provide stronger and more sustainable urban services in Agartala, focusing \non smart roads and tourism infrastructure. The economic analysis evaluated the economic \nfeasibility of three component interventions in Agartala for which detailed designs had been \ncompleted.20 Based on available cost estimates, the estimated economic internal rates of return \nare 14.8% (MBB College Lake), 19.8% (smart roads), and 23.5% (Ujjayanta Palace). These \nfigures are higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital (9.0%), indicating significant \neconomic returns. Sensitivity analysis results revealed that overall results are satisfactory with the \neconomic internal rate of return exceeding the economic opportunity cost of capital in all cases. \nThe economic viability of the components would be higher if unquantifiable benefits, such as \nenvironmental improvements, were included in the analysis. Upon completion of the construction \nof assets under the three components and capacity building of stakeholders, about 0.5 million \npeople are expected to benefit. The estimated poverty impact ratios, i.e., proportion of the project \nbenefits accruing to the poor, are 9.3% for the smart roads component, 10.1% for Ujjayanta \nPalace, and 12.8% for MBB College Lake. Considering the below poverty line ratio in Tripura is \n7.4%, the components are expected to benefit the poor considerably.21 \n \n26.  Financial viability. The financial analysis was conducted following ADB\u2019s guidelines.22 \nThe  tourism-related  components  are  revenue  generating,  while  the  road  component  is \nnonrevenue generating. The two tourism projects, to be operated and maintained by the Higher \nEducation Department or its successor agency, will recover their incremental O&M cost through \nfees and charges that will be revised periodically. The road component, to be operated and \nmaintained by the Public Works Department, will sustain its O&M costs through annual budget \nallocations. The state government is committed to ensuring gap funding for O&M of all the \ncomponents  through  budgetary  allocations  to  the  operating  agencies.  Overall  financial \nsustainability risk is categorized as medium. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n27.  The financial assessment also considered the measures to ensure the components\u2019 \nsustainability. The project includes an asset management and sustainability strategy agreed with \nthe GOT and ASCL. ASCL will receive timely and sufficient funds to finance 5 years of O&M \n \n20 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Government of India, Planning Commission. 2012.

The project has sound institutional arrangements. ASCL has entered into agreements with \nthe relevant operating agencies to ensure roles and responsibilities are clear during and after \nconstruction. The project will implement the asset management and sustainability strategy, which \ncomprises (i) description of the administrative, technical, and financial requirements for asset \nmaintenance; and (ii) a sustainability plan to ensure these requirements are achieved. The project \nwill finance the early phase of O&M to support the Public Works Department (Roads and Bridges \nwing), and Higher Education Department or its successor agency in the transition period. The \nPIUs will work closely with each project stakeholder to ensure their close involvement at all stages. \nThe project will monitor progress in implementing the agreed sustainability plan. TUDA will \ncontinue  to  develop  human  and  institutional  capacity  through  continuous  training  of  urban \nfunctionaries and elected representatives. \n \nD.  Governance \n29.  Financial management. A financial management assessment was conducted for ASCL, \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines.23 The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is \nsubstantial mainly because ASCL has no experience with externally financed projects and lacks \nan  internal  audit function,  and the  PMU  accounts  staff  lack knowledge  of  ADB\u2019s  financial \nmanagement requirements. These risks will be mitigated by (i) engaging a financial management \nexpert to support the PMU, (ii) providing continuous training on ADB\u2019s financial management \nrequirements and disbursement procedures and systems, (iii) developing project-specific financial \nmanagement procedures, and (iv) engaging an external firm to conduct internal audits. The \nproject financial statements will be audited annually by an auditor acceptable to ADB, following \nauditing standards acceptable to ADB. \n \n30.  Procurement. All procurement of civil works and consulting services will comply with the \nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time), and the Procurement Regulations \nfor ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). All civil works packages will follow the \nelectronic government procurement (e-GP) system developed by the National Informatics Centre. \nThe use of the construction contract modality will help ensure value for money. This modality uses \nconformance-based specifications that provide a high degree of cost certainty and adopt least-\ncost evaluation criteria for noncomplex brownfield sites which do not require any innovative \ntechnical solutions. The use of e-GP promotes the transparency and efficiency. \n \n31.  Anticorruption  measures.  Integrity  due  diligence  was  conducted.24 No  significant \nintegrity risks were identified. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the Government of India and the GOT. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 17). Based on \nthe risk assessments, the mitigation measures include (i) regularly updating the project website \nto  enhance  transparency  in  project  implementation,  procurement,  and  safeguards;  and  (ii) \n \n23 ADB. 2015.

Economic shocks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are impacting income from tourism \nand are likely to deepen the poverty of the poor and vulnerable. The project aims to make the city \nmore livable by providing improved roads, and safe recreation and green spaces. The project will \nsupport the achievement of the SDGs (footnote 12). The project design is pro-poor, inclusive, and \ngender responsive. First, the project is expected to substantially benefit the poor, especially poor \nwomen and girls, through improved walkability, road safety, and better organized areas for small \nbusinesses development. Second, they will also benefit from increased awareness of WASH and \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, and improved access to health care, educational facilities, markets, and \nemployment centers. Moreover, poor and vulnerable people, including women, will be given \npreference for project construction jobs and O&M activities. Consultants will be recruited to \nfacilitate  skills  training,  consultations,  and  public  awareness-raising  during  project \nimplementation. The strategy for setting entry fees to the recreation spaces to cover O&M costs \nhas been developed considering affordability for the poor. \n \n33.  The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. Agartala exhibits a favorable \nsex ratio (999 women per 1,000 males) and a low gender gap in literacy (2.5%), although women\u2019s \naverage wages are reported to be \u20b9108 per day lower than those of men. Deficiencies in roads \nand drainage, and lack of accessible and safe recreational spaces inhibit mobility and access for \nwomen and persons with disabilities. The project will address these issues through targeted \nactivities to ensure inclusion and participation of women and vulnerable groups in project benefits, \nincluding improved roads and drainage, EWCD-friendly infrastructure, and strengthened technical \ncapacities of female project staff. A GAP has been prepared with adequate resource allocation \nand affirmative measures including (i) usable public and recreational spaces for women and \nchildren; (ii) well-lit, pedestrian-friendly, and access-friendly roads and footpaths; (iii) women and \nvulnerable persons\u2019 safety; (iv) awareness campaigns for local communities, especially women \non WASH and the COVID-19 pandemic; (v) skills enhancement and income-generating activities \nfor women and  the vulnerable; and (vi) gender sensitization of project staff and stakeholders.25 \n \nF.  Safeguards \n34.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.26 \n \n35.  Environment (category B). ASCL prepared three initial environmental examination (IEE) \nreports for the components based on their detailed designs.27 The IEEs show that the project \ncomponents are unlikely to cause any significant adverse environmental impacts, and any \nimpacts during construction and O&M can be mitigated through appropriate design and good \npractices. The locations of the project components are not within or adjacent to environmentally \nsensitive areas and will not adversely impact any forest area, wildlife sanctuary, national park, \ncritical habitat, or other area with sensitive biodiversity or ecosystems. Measures for mitigating \nimpacts  are  included  in  the  environmental  management  plan.  Public  consultations  were \nconducted during project preparation and will continue throughout implementation. The IEEs will \n \n25 The GAP prepared for the project is in the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2). \n26 ADB.

An  appropriate  institutional  arrangement  for \nsafeguards management will be in place. ASCL will submit semiannual environmental monitoring \nreports for ADB review and disclosure. 28 \n \n36.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). ASCL has prepared one resettlement plan and \ntwo due diligence reports following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. No land acquisition is \nenvisaged. All project sites are government-owned. Temporary livelihood impacts and impacts to \ncommon property resources during construction are expected. The proposed mitigation measures \nand safeguard planning documents adequately address the assessed impacts. ASCL will certify \nthat compensation has been paid to all affected persons prior to displacement. Involuntary \nresettlement impacts will be further assessed during the detailed measurement survey, and the \nsocial safeguards documents updated prior to contract award. PMU will submit semiannual social \nsafeguard monitoring reports for ADB review and disclosure. \n \n37.  A GRM will be established and disclosed to the project beneficiaries and/or affected \ncommunities before civil works contracts are awarded. This will be the first externally aided project \nto be implemented by ASCL. The project will provide capacity-building support to the PMU, PIUs, \nand  municipal  staff  on ADB\u2019s  safeguards requirements  during  project implementation.  The \nsafeguards staffing consists of a full-time environment and social nodal officer at the PMU and \ntwo social safeguards officers, one in each PIU. These staff will be supported by the social \nsafeguards specialist and construction management staff of the project management consultants.  \n \n38.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Although scheduled tribes account for 4.94% of \nAgartala\u2019s population, they do not retain the defining characteristics of scheduled tribes. They \nhave a higher literacy rate (97.83%) than the average for Agartala (94.45%).29 Agartala is not in \na scheduled tribe area, no particularly vulnerable tribal groups are reported, and none of the \naffected persons belongs to a tribal group. No indigenous peoples impact involving direct or \nindirect impacts to the dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or territories or natural or cultural \nresources that are used, owned, occupied, or claimed by indigenous peoples as their ancestral \ndomain or asset, is anticipated. \n \nG.
