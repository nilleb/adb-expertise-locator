The  Project  will  assist  the  Governments  of\nKazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic in rehabilitating the\nAlmaty-Bishkek  road,  removing  physical  and  nonphysical\ncross-border  barriers,  improving  coordination  and\nmanagement  of  road  safety,  and  introducing  a  road\nmaintenance system by contract.\nClassification Economic growth\nEnvironmental Category B.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) was\nAssessment undertaken, and the summary IEE is a core appendix.\nRationale Regional cooperation among the countries of Central Asia\nis  required  to  develop  their  economies.    The  transport\nsector contributes substantially toward this end through the\ndevelopment  of  adequate  transport  infrastructure  that\nallows new markets to be opened up, and through the\nemergence of efficient transport modes that facilitate the\nrestructuring  of  trade  and  industry  and  expanding  the\nscope for international trade in goods and services. Cross-\nborder  cooperation  improves  the  efficiency  of  road\ntransport. Safer and better-maintained roads reduce road\naccidents and travel costs. The Almaty-Bishkek road is at a\ncross-link between the road corridors that connect the Far\nEast  with  Europe  and  Fergana  Valley  with  Russia.  Its\nrehabilitation, combined with removal of the physical and\nnonphysical  barriers  impeding  cross-border  transport,\ncomplements earlier assistance by the Asian Development\nBank  (ADB)  in  Kazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and\nUzbekistan to create an improved regional road network\nand will contribute to regional economic cooperation. The\nProject has been given high priority by the Governments of\nKazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic.\nObjective and Scope: The objective of the Project is to improve the efficiency and\nsafety  of  the  principal  subregional  road  transport  link\nbetween  Almaty  and  Bishkek  by  rehabilitating  road\ninfrastructure,  modernizing  border  control  policies  and\nprocedures,  upgrading  cross-border  facilities,  improving\nthe  coordination  and  management  of  road  safety,  and\nintroducing an efficient road maintenance system.  The", "iii\nProject comprises (i) rehabilitation of about 245 kilometers\n(km)  of  the  Almaty-Bishkek  road  (about  204  km  in\nKazakhstan, and 41 km in the Kyrgyz Republic), including\nconsulting  services  for  design  and  construction\nsupervision; (ii) improvement of customs facilities at the\nAkzhol-Chu border; and (iii) road maintenance equipment\nfor Kazakhstan.\nCost Estimates The total Project cost is estimated at $119.1 million.

The\neconomic internal rate of return of the Project is estimated\nat about 28.0 percent (including subregional and regional\nbenefits). The Project will contribute to poverty reduction", "v\nthrough engagement of up to 300 local workers during the\nconstruction  season  in  two  of  the  poorest  regions  of\nKazakhstan  and  the  rural  areas  of  Chui  region  in  the\nKyrgyz Republic. After the construction, maintenance by\ncontract will generate job opportunities for about 160 local\nroad engineers and workers.\nTechnical Assistance Two  advisory  technical  assistance  grants,  $750,000  for\nKazakhstan  and  $440,000  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  will\nhelp  the  governments  implement  the  provisions  of  the\nCross-Border  Agreement,  improve  coordination  and\nmanagement  of  road  safety,  and  provide  support  to\nKAZMOTC. The grants will be provided from the Japan\nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The\nadvisory support to KGZMOTC will comprise streamlining\nfunctions  and  responsibilities,  defining  roles  and  sector\nobjectives, and preparing the three-year national transport\ninvestment plan.", "vi", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1.  I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on the proposed\nloans to the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic for the Almaty-Bishkek Regional\nRoad Rehabilitation Project. The Report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for\nImprovement of the Road Sector Efficiency in each of Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, and\nif the proposed loans are approved by the Board, I, acting under the authority delegated to me\nby the Board, shall approve the technical assistance for Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2.   Regional cooperation among the countries of Central Asia is required to develop their\neconomies.  The  transport  sector  contributes  substantially  toward  that  end  through  the\ndevelopment of adequate transport infrastructure that allows new markets to be opened up.1\nThe emergence of cost-effective and competitive transport modes facilitates the restructuring of\ntrade  and  industry  and  expands  the  scope  of  international  trade  in  goods  and  services.\nStreamlined transport logistics aimed at overcoming physical and nonphysical cross-border\nbarriers  have  a  major  impact  on  the  scope  for  international  trade  in  goods  and  services.\nPhysical barriers include poor road infrastructure, inadequate control points, and different axle\nload limits. Nonphysical barriers comprise excessive taxes and fees, inconsistent transport and\ncustoms documentation, and attitudinal problems of and unauthorized payments to border staff.\n3.   For road transport to contribute toward regional cooperation in addition to reducing road\naccidents  and  travel  cost,  an  efficient  road  transport  system  and  effective  cross-border\ncooperation are essential. The proposed Project aims to improve the efficiency of transport on\nthe Almaty-Bishkek road, one of the most important road links in the Central Asian region\n(Appendix  1).  The  Project  is  expected  to  contribute  substantially  to  enhancing  regional\neconomic cooperation, initially between Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, and in the longer\nterm among all Central Asian Republics (CARs), as about 25 percent of the freight traffic on the\nroad  is  international.  The  Project  is  timely  in  introducing  the  concept  of  cross-border\nmodernization and cooperation, given the difficulties the CARs are facing in adjusting their\nadministrative arrangements and regulations to overcome the impact of the Russian economic\ncrisis.\n4.   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  supporting  regional  economic\ncooperation in the CARs and, since early 1997, has provided a number of TAs for this purpose\n(Appendix  2).  The  initiatives  in  the  transport  sector  include  coordination  of  sector  reforms\nthrough  country-specific  projects,  development  of  road  standards,  and  preparation  of  road\nsafety guidelines.\n5.  Feasibility  studies  for  the  Kazakh  section  of  the  Project  were  prepared  by  the\nconsultants engaged under ADB's project preparatory TA2 and those for the Kyrgyz section by\n3\nthe project supervision consultants engaged under the ongoing first ADB-financed project.  The\nfeasibility studies were completed in April 1998 and May 1998, respectively. Fact-finding was\nundertaken in March 1999 to discuss key policy issues concerning cross-border cooperation,\nroad safety, and road maintenance, and to review the preparatory work.

This report is based\non  the  findings  of  the  feasibility  studies  and  ADB  missions,  discussions  with  Government\nofficials and road sector representatives, and various reports and data provided by the two\nGovernments. Joint loan negotiations with the authorized representatives of the Governments\n5\nwere conducted in Manila from 4 to 7 September 2000.  If approved, the proposed loans will be\nADB's second  and  third  to  the  transport  sectors  of  Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,\nrespectively.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA.  Transport Infrastructure  in the Central Asian Republics\n6.  The existing transport infrastructure in the CARs, inherited from the former Soviet Union\n(FSU), was developed as a regional network to serve the FSU\u2019s needs, without taking into\nconsideration  the  administrative  boundaries  of  the  CARs  and  paying  little  attention  to  the\nregional  economic  cooperation  outside  of  the  Council  for  Mutual  Economic  Assistance\ncountries. The network was primarily designed to serve intra-FSU traffic. This has created a\nnumber of difficulties after independence, as the CARs found themselves with fragmented\ntransport networks that frequently cross and recross the borders of neighboring countries.\n7.    The transport system has to be made efficient, and trade and transport regulations\nharmonized, in view of the economic reforms and political realignment, emerging free trade\nareas, and custom unions. Part of the difficulties of the CARs in competing in the global markets\nis  attributable  to  bottlenecks  in  the  transport  infrastructure  that  constrain  growth,  and  to\ninefficient  administrative  arrangements  and  regulations  that  govern  freight  and  passenger\ntransport. The transport sector faces the challenge of balancing investments in rehabilitating the\ndeteriorating assets to restore and preserve the integrity of past investments, and those in\nimproving  system  capacity  and  efficiency,  including  new  construction,  to  meet  domestic,\nregional, and global needs.\n1. The Transport Sector in Kazakhstan\na. General\n8.  The major characteristic of the transport sector in Kazakhstan is the high demand for\ntransport  services  due  to  (i)  Kazakhstan's  vast  territory  and  scattered  population,  natural\nresources,  and  activities;  and  (ii)  the  existing  trade  pattern  resulting  from  (a)  the  FSU's\nspecialized economy in which Kazakhstan's earlier role was to serve as the source of raw\nmaterials and intermediate products for the FSU, and (b) the underpricing of transport services\nduring the FSU era. The transport demand has been falling drastically since the FSU\u2019s breakup\nand the start of economic restructuring in 1992. The 99.5 billion ton-kilometer (km) of freight in\n1999 was only less than one quarter of the 1990 figure of 455.9 billion ton-km. In passenger\n                  \n4 The Mission comprised S. Tamang, Mission Leader, Senior Project Specialist; Y. Zhang, Special Advisor to\nGeneral Counsel; J. C. Alexander, Senior Programs Officer; T. David Hodgkinson, Senior Cofinancing Officer; J.\nMiller, Project Economist; Lan Wu, Economist; and Ma. T. Zappia, Socioeconomic Specialist.\n5  The loan negotiations were delayed because of the need to resolve issues concerning transit traffic in the Cross-\nBorder Agreement (footnote 28) and delayed approval of the Kazakhstan\u2019s Public Investment Program (para. 11).", "3\ntraffic, the 68.5 billion passenger-km recorded in 1990 decreased by one quarter to 17.1 billion\npassenger-km in 1997 (Appendix 3). However, these dramatic decreases need to be put in the\ncontext of the somewhat artificial nature of the demand for transport in a centrally planned\neconomy, where tariffs and fares were set without consideration of the cost of the services\nprovided.\n9.   The transport sector in Kazakhstan comprises roads, railways, civil aviation, and inland\nwaterways. The railway is the dominant mode, transporting coal for energy production and\ncarrying over 90 percent of all freight in 1994-1999. The remainder of the freight is carried by\nroad. As transport demand will become much more diversified, specific quality features such as\nspeed, reliability,  waiting time, minimization of losses and damages, and the ability to move\nsmall loads efficiently will become much more important than in the past. These features require\nflexible, cost-efficient transport services that are market responsive. Consequently, with the\ninherently greater suitability of road transport than railways for meeting the increased demand\nfor specialized services, the share of roads in freight transport is expected to increase from the\ncurrent 5 percent to about 30 percent6, provided the road and road transport sectors are able to\nmeet  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  demanded  by  the  market  through  infrastructure\nrehabilitation,  policy  reform,  and  capacity  development.  With  regard  to  passenger  traffic,\nrailways accounted for about 52 percent of passenger-km, roads for 35 percent, and air for 12\npercent in 1999. A shift is also expected from railways to roads in passenger transport as the\ncondition  of  roads  improve,  private  car  ownership  grows,  and  intercity  bus  services  are\nprivatized.\nb. Transport Planning and Investment\n10.  The Kazakh Ministry of Transport and Communications (KAZMOTC) is responsible for\nall  transport  infrastructure\u2013roads,  railways,  airports,  ports  and  inland  waterways\u2013and  for\ntelecommunications and tourism activities. KAZMOTC is in charge of sector policy, regulation,\nplanning, and development. It is guided by the Cabinet of Ministers, Ministry of Finance and\nMinistry of Economy, which are involved in developing the Government's overall reform program\nand prioritizing capital expenditures. KAZMOTC is divided into eight departments and is headed\nby the minister, who is assisted by three vice ministers (Appendix 4).\n11.  The 1999-2001 Public Investment Program approved by the Parliament in August 2000\nprovides a prioritized summary of Kazakhstan\u2019s investment program for foreign assistance. The\nrehabilitation of the Almaty-Karaganda-Astana and Almaty-Bishkek-Shymkent road corridors\nhas been accorded high priority. Within these corridors, the Almaty-Bishkek road is the most\nimportant link in view of its subregional importance.  Other important transport projects include\nreconstruction of the Aktau port, construction of the Astana airport, development of urban\ntransport in Astana, and railway development.\n12.     In terms of gross domestic product (GDP), public investment in the road sector dropped\nfrom 1.2 percent in 1990 to 0.3 percent during 1994 and even less in 1995 and 1996.  The\ncurrent annual allocation of about 0.5 percent of GDP needs to be increased to about 2.0 - 2.5\npercent  to  meet  the  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  requirements  and  avoid  major\nreconstruction costs in the near future.\n                  \n6  The share of road freight volume in the People\u2019s Republic of China is about 25 percent of the total freight volume. It\nis about 55 percent in India and above 50 percent in most European countries, e.g., Poland: 50 percent and\nBulgaria: 55 percent.", "4\nc. The Road and Road Transport Sector\ni. The Road Network\n13.  Although  the  road  network  in  Kazakhstan  provides  adequate  connections  to  all  19\nregions, the condition of about 17,380 km of national (republican) roads is not satisfactory and is\ndeteriorating further.  While 93 percent of the national roads are paved, more than 11,000 km\nneeds  rehabilitation.  The  other  roads  are  also  in  poor  condition;  they  include  provincial\n(regional) roads (70,461 km, with 57 percent paved), urban roads (22,600 km, with 65 percent\npaved), and rural (economic) roads (57,000 km, with 5 percent paved). While the geometric\nstandards of the roads have generally been generous, the condition of the pavement is poor\nmainly because of sloppy construction, inadequate maintenance, and the increasing use of\nheavy long-distance trucks (more than 10 tons) whereas the roads were designed as per the\nFSU standards for a maximum permissible single-axle loads of only 6 tons.\nii. Sector Management\n14.  After independence, joint-stock holding companies, such as Kazakhstan Zoldhary, were\nformed to manage the Government's interest in the road sector. In early 1995, these companies\nwere reorganized into the Kazakh Department of Roads (KAZDOR), State Road Authority, and\n19  regional  road  authorities.  Recently,  the  Government  further  restructured  the  road\nadministration by converting KAZDOR into a policy-making department and renaming it as the\nCommittee of Road and Road Transport (CRRT) and setting up a central implementation unit,\nKazakhavtodor (Republican State Road Enterprise), and its regional affiliates through a merger\nof  the  State  Road  Authority  and  regional  road  authorities.  The  organizational  structure  of\nKazakhavtodor  is  shown  in  Appendix  4.  With  the  establishment  of  CRRT,  the  Board  of\nInvestment Projects and PIUs have been transferred to the Committee from Kazakhavtodor.\n15.     Kazakhavtodor  is  responsible  for  construction  as  a  contractor.  While  periodic\nmaintenance and rehabilitation works are carried out by CRRT through competitive tendering,\nroutine maintenance is undertaken on a force account basis where maintenance by contract is\nnot feasible. Although the current institutional setup rightly separates road administration from\nthe implementation functions, much still needs to be done to develop the sector\u2019s capacity,\nparticularly in terms of creating an enabling environment for private sector participation and\nbuilding up private sector capability for road sector activities (para. 47).7\n16.  In addition to CRRT and Kazakhavtodor, the Roads and Marine Transport Department\n(RMTD) is responsible for formulating road transport policies, regulating and coordinating road\ntransport operations, and licensing the operators. RMTD\u2019s objectives include improving service\nlevels and road transport technology, facilitating the road transport sector's transition to a\nmarket economy, and reducing transport costs; however, weaknesses in the legal framework\nand  its  enforcement  still  inhibit  efficient  road  transport  operations.  Recognizing  this,  the\nGovernment has embarked on improvement and development of laws and regulations pertinent\nto road transport and their enforcement with the help of the World Bank\u2019s Road Transport\n8\nRestructuring Project.\n                  \n7  Initially, execution of routine and winter maintenance of the Almaty-Karaganda road and, at a later date, that of the\nKaraganda-Astana road are expected to be contracted out by renting Government-owned equipment to private\ncontractors.\n8  For $100 million, approved in January 1999.", "5\niii. Traffic and Vehicle Fleet\n17.  Traffic on the roads of Kazakhstan in generally light. Very few roads have an average\nannual daily traffic (AADT) of more than 5,000. Traffic flows on the national roads are in the\nrange of 1,000-1,500 AADT comprising about 50 percent trucks, 7 percent buses, and 43\npercent cars. Car traffic is expected to increase with increasing private car ownership in a\nmarket-based economy.\n18.   The motorized fleet in 1999 consisted of 1,278,347 vehicles, of which 205,687 were\ntrucks, 43,421 buses, 987,724 cars, and 41,515 special vehicles. The truck and bus fleets are\nstill dominated by makes from the FSU. Some trucking companies have procured secondhand\ntrucks of larger capacity and more modern design, mainly for use on transnational routes.  A\nsubstantial number of cars, most of them secondhand, are being imported privately from West\nEurope,  and  the  foreign  models  account  for  about  20  percent  of  the  country's  car  fleet.\nPreviously,  most  trucks  and  buses  were  operated  by  state  organizations,  but  since  the\nintroduction of the privatization program and auctions, private ownership of all vehicles has\nreached 93 percent (98 percent for cars).\niv. Road Transport Industry\n19.  Privatization of the road transport industry in Kazakhstan began in 1993, and most of the\nindustry is now with the private sector. A two-stage process was followed to privatize the\ntrucking enterprises: first, about 20 percent of the trucks were auctioned off through open\nauctions, then the rest of the enterprises were corporatized and sold through either a small-\nscale or a mass privatization program assisted by the United States Agency for International\nDevelopment.9 Small enterprises (less than 100 vehicles or 200 employees) were sold through\npublic  auction  for  cash  under  the  small-scale  program,  while  larger  enterprises  were  sold\nthrough coupons to investment funds.\n20.   For passenger transport, RMTD bids out the transport rights. The profitable routes are\nallotted based on the highest route-license bid for a fixed period of time, normally between one\nand three years. For routes that currently cannot sustain fully commercial operations but where\ntransport services are to be provided in the public interest, the route allocation is based on the\nlowest offered cost of operation. On routes that are not attractive to private operators, the buses\nowned by the Government or cooperatives and joint-stock companies provide services. RMTD\u2019s\nrole is limited to setting the level of service and tariffs, licensing, and monitoring the provision to\npassengers  of  such  services  as  booking  and  departure  facilities  and  emergency  vehicle\nreplacement.\n21.    By 1999, about 88 percent of the 206,187 trucks and 43,421 buses were owned by the\nprivate sector. The rest were owned and operated by State-owned transport companies and\nforeign companies or foreign-assisted projects (Appendix 5). While progress in privatization\nlooks significant, a competitive environment in the trucking industry is yet to be developed\nbecause the trucking enterprises sold to the investment funds maintain monopolies in many\nareas through either their regional location advantage or commodity-based operations. The\nmore efficient companies are trying to expand and compete by introducing larger, modern,\ndiesel-driven units in their fleet and scrapping the inefficient petrol-driven vehicles. However, the\nabsence  of  credit  facilities  due  to  the  fiscal  crisis  and  lack  of  proper  accounting  and\n                  \n9 The  two  projects  were  the  Small-Scale  Privatization  and  Enterprise  Support  Project  (1993)  and  the  Mass\nPrivatization Project (1995).", "6\nmanagement  practices  have  constrained  their  expansion  plans  and  the  development  of  a\ncompetitive market.\n22.  The industry is also suffering because of a sharp fall in transport demand resulting in\nsubstantial underutilization of trucks. In 1998, trucks typically traveled 5,000 km/year or only 20\npercent of the 1990 figure of 25,000 km/year, which is low, compared with a normal economic\nutilization of about 80,000-100,000 km/year.  For buses, the average annual utilization in 1998\nwas about 60,000-70,000 km/year, below the normal economic utilization level of about 80,000\nkm/year.\n  v. Road Revenues and Expenditures\n23.  Extreme shortage of funds for road maintenance and rehabilitation has been the main\nreason for the poor state of Kazakhstan\u2019s roads. While funding in the early 1990s had amounted\nto about 570 million rubles ($350 million) annually,10 the allocation in 1998 was only about $130\nmillion equivalent, against a requirement of about $350 million equivalent for maintenance of the\nnational  and  regional  roads  alone.  The  funding  for  roads  is  provided  by  the  Road  Fund\nestablished through Decree No. 2701 on 21 December 199511 and managed by the Ministry of\nFinance, and is supplemented from the Government budget since the Road Fund collection\nalone has not been adequate. The Road Fund has been streamlined with the implementation of\nthe  following  short-term  recommendations  of  an  ADB-financed  study:12  (i) reducing  the\nenterprise tax (the main source for the Road Fund, but not related to road users) from 0.5\npercent of the turnover to 0.2 percent; and (ii) moving the point of collection of the fuel tax from\nthe  retail  level  to  the  refinery/import  level.  These  measures  were  implemented  through\namendments to the Road Fund Act by the Parliament in May 1998. Collecting the fuel tax at the\nrefinery/import level increased the Road Fund collection for July-December 1998 to T2.3 billion,\ncompared with T240 million during the previous six months. Despite its severe fiscal constraints,\nthe  Government  is  committed  to  (i)  a  provision  of  annual  funding  for  maintenance  and\nrehabilitation of national roads amounting to about $125 million in 2000, and $150 million in\n2001 and thereafter; and  (ii) a further review of road user charges and gradual increase of such\ncharges for trucks and buses to allow 75 percent cost recovery by September 2000 and 100\n13\npercent cost recovery by September 2002.\n2. The Transport Sector in the Kyrgyz Republic\na. General\n24.   In  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  road  transport  dominates  the  transport  sector  in  providing\nservices to the country\u2019s remote areas.  The railways consist of two separate branch lines that\nlink the north of the country to the Kazakh rail system, and the south of the country to the Uzbek\nsystem, with no direct connection between the two links14 (see Map). In 1999, road transport\naccounted for about three fourths of freight traffic and almost the entire passenger traffic.\nRailways carry the rest of the freight traffic. Rail passenger traffic is not significant, accounting\n                  \n10$1 = 0.59 ruble in mid-1990.\n11Initially, the Road Fund was sourced through  (i) 0.5 percent tax on the revenues of all enterprises, (ii) a tax of T3.0\nper liter on gasoline and diesel, and (iii) taxes on heavy vehicles (more than 10 tons) and international freight traffic\n(rates determined on case-to-case basis).\n12 TA 2631-KAZ: Institutional Strengthening of the Road Sector, for $750,000, approved on 27 August 1996.\n13 Covenanted under the World Bank\u2019s Road Transport Restructuring Project (para. 16).\n14The railway link between Bishkek and Osh is a low-priority project, given the country's other more urgent needs\nand the project\u2019s high cost (about $600 million).", "7\nfor  less  than  1  percent  of  passenger  movements,  mainly  on  the  Bishkek-Osh  route\n(Appendix 6). There is no water transport except for a few small vessels on Lake Yssyk-Kul.\n25.   The transport demand reached its lowest level in 1995 as a result of the disruption of the\ncustomary trading patterns of the FSU era. In terms of ton-km, the freight decreased to 14\npercent of the 1990 level, and passenger movements to 33 percent. The end of the economic\ncontraction in 1995 resulted in a GDP growth of 9.9 percent in 1997. As a result, the demand for\nfreight and passenger transport in 1997 increased to 21 percent and 40 percent, respectively, of\nthe 1990 level. However, GDP growth slowed down in 1998 because of  (i) the impact of the\neconomic crisis in Russia, (ii) damage to the infrastructure caused by a Fergana Valley flood,\nand (iii) a substantial reduction in tourism revenue caused by adverse publicity concerning the\ncyanide  spillover  in  Lake  Yssyk-Kul.  Accordingly,  the  transport  demand  for  freight  has\ndecreased in 1998 and 1999. Since most of the roads were designed for higher traffic capacities\nand are underutilized, the existing basic transport infrastructure is adequate for the current level\nof economic activity.  The primary concern, therefore, is proper maintenance and rehabilitation\nof the deteriorating infrastructure to preserve the previous investment, rather than expansion or\nmajor upgrading of the transport system.\nb. Transport Planning, Coordination, and Investment\n26.   The Kyrgyz Ministry of Transport and Communications (KGZMOTC) is responsible for\npolicy, regulation, planning, and development of the transport and communications sectors in\nthe Kyrgyz Republic. KGZMOTC currently performs its functions through 12 departments but is\n15\nbeing restructured to 5 departments under the ongoing ADB-financed project  (Appendix 7). In\naddition to reducing the number of departments, the restructuring includes (i) divesting the\nresponsibility  for  direct  operation  of  the  transportation  systems  through  a  program  of\nprivatization, and (ii) transferring all responsibilities relating to the road sector from the Vehicle\nInspection Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and from the Ministry of Architecture\n16\nand Construction  to KGZMOTC through the implementation of the Automobile Roads Act of\nMay 1998. KGZMOTC also coordinates the activities of 10 agencies, which are at various\nstages of corporatization and privatization.\n27.   As in Kazakhstan, the 1998-2000 Public Investment Program prepared by the Ministry of\nFinance  provides  a  prioritized  summary  of  the  country's  investment  program  for  foreign\nassistance. It gives high priority to infrastructure improvements, including rehabilitation of the\nBishkek-Osh  road,  redevelopment  of  the  Manas  international  airport,  modernization  of  the\ntelecommunications network, and upgrading and extension of the power transmission network.\nThe public investment in the transport sector dropped significantly since 1990 from about 2\npercent of GDP to near zero during 1995. As a result of such underinvestment, transport\ninfrastructure has deteriorated to a point where major reconstruction will be required unless\nadequate  funds  are  allocated  for  adequate  maintenance.  Transport  investment  needs  a\nsubstantial increase to the level of about 4 percent of GDP to avoid major reconstruction in the\nfuture. The 1998 and 1999 expenditures in the transport sector were respectively Som751\nmillion (2.2 percent of GDP), and Som800 million (2.3 percent of GDP), of which Som273 million\nwas for roads.\n                  \n15 Loan 1630-KGZ(SF): Second Road Rehabilitation Project, for $50 million, approved on 10 September 1998.\n16 The Vehicle Inspection Department within the Ministry of Internal Affairs is responsible for road surveys and\ninspection, traffic management and control, and road safety functions including vehicle registration and inspection.\nThe  Ministry  of  Architecture  and  Construction  is  responsible  for  developing  road  design  and  construction\nstandards.", "8\nc. The Road and Road Transport Sector\ni. The Road Network\n28.   The 18,876 km of roads under KGZMOTC and about 15,000 km of rural and farm roads\noutside  its  jurisdiction  provide  road  network  links  to  all  six  regions  and  communities.  The\nKGZMOTC roads comprise 9,803 km of State roads and 9,073 km of local roads. About 40\npercent of the State roads are sealed, some with gravel mixed with bitumen binder. Over 50\npercent  is  gravel  roads,  and  less  than  10  percent  earth  roads.  About  60  percent  of  the\nKGZMOTC  roads  currently  require  periodic  maintenance  or  rehabilitation.  The  situation  is\nexpected to gradually improve as the road maintenance capacity develops and more money\nbecomes available through the Road Fund.  Most of the rural and farm roads were formerly the\nresponsibility of the State and collective farms. The responsibility for their maintenance is now\nwith the local district administrations following the gradual breakup of the State and collective\nfarming system.\nii. Sector Management\n29.   The main responsibility for planning and administering road sector policies, programs,\nand projects is entrusted to KGZMOTC by the Automobile Roads Act. The Kyrgyz Department\nof Roads (KGZDOR) under KGZMOTC is responsible for management of the road sector and\ncarries out maintenance of roads through its six regional road maintenance agencies, which\ncontrol  the  operations  undertaken  by  38  local  maintenance  units  (LMUs)  for  State  roads.\nSimilarly, 33 LMUs exist for maintenance of local roads. In 1998, the Directorate General for\nRehabilitation and Maintenance of the Bishkek-Osh Road, established through Decree No. 45 of\n4 March 1996 under the Office of the Prime Minister, was integrated into KGZDOR. The\nmanagement  of  the  road  sector  will  be  streamlined  after  proper  structure,  systems,  and\nprocedures have been established in KGZDOR under the ongoing ADB-financed projects and\nwhen  the  road-related  functions  are  transferred  from  the  Ministry  of  Architecture  and\nConstruction and Vehicle Inspection Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n30.   Other important agencies in the road sector include (i) a joint-stock holding company,\ndesignated as Kyrgyzjoldoru (Kyrgyz Roads), which acts as an umbrella organization for 52\nprivatized road construction entities; (ii) KyrgyzIntrans, a holding agency for six freight transport\ncompanies and forwarding agencies engaged mainly in international trade; and (iii) technical\nagencies in various stages of divestment from KGZMOTC\u2019s control, including the Road Design\nInstitute (Kyrgyzdortranproect), a small agency responsible for developing and testing new road\nconstruction techniques and equipment (Kyrgyztranstekhnika), and a privatized training agency\nfor equipment operators.\n31.   The Government's aim is to improve the efficiency of the road sector by commercializing\nand privatizing those construction and maintenance operations that are essentially commercial\nin nature. Where implementation with the help of private contractors is not feasible, particularly\nfor maintenance of roads in remote areas, the LMUs will carry out the maintenance works using\nequipment owned by KGZMOTC.\niii. Traffic and Vehicle Fleet\n32.   The AADT on one of the busy main roads in the vicinity of Bishkek typically is about\n13,200 vehicles. Traffic on the Bishkek-Osh road away from the large towns varies between 600", "9\nand 900 AADT, with large trucks accounting for more than 50 percent. The current traffic levels\nare generally well below the design capacities of the roads. Seasonal variations, reflecting\nchanges in transport demand and weather-related constraints, are significant on roads crossing\nthe central mountainous areas of the Kyrgyz Republic. Considering the need to preserve the\nintegrity of the past investments, the Government is giving high priority to rehabilitation and\nproper maintenance of the existing road networks.\n33.   The country's 1999 vehicle fleet comprised 44,300 trucks, 11,500 buses, and 178,500\ncars. About 95 percent of the cars are privately owned. Previously, most trucks and buses were\nowned and operated by State organizations. Following the privatization program and auctions,\n26 percent of the trucks and 23 percent of the buses are now owned by individuals. The balance\nare owned and operated by transport companies. The majority of the fleet is still made up of\nvehicles manufactured in the FSU. A few modern buses have been procured under bilateral\narrangements  and  assigned  to  selected  bus  companies.  Some  trucking  companies  have\nprocured secondhand trucks of larger capacity and more modern design, mainly for use on\ntransnational  routes.  A  significant  number  of  cars,  most  of  them  secondhand,  are  being\nimported privately from West Europe.\n34.  While the number of cars has fallen marginally because of the reduction in cars owned\nby Government departments and the contraction of the economy, the number of trucks has\nincreased slightly since 1990 and the number of buses has been stable. The fleet, however, is\naging, since few companies have been in a position to buy modern vehicles. In 1999, more than\n70 percent of the truck fleet was between 7 and 12 years old and over half was with capacities\nof less than 7 tons. Only about 5 percent of the fleet had a capacity of 15 tons or more.\niv. Road Transport Industry\n35.   The  Kyrgyz  Auto  Transport,  a  joint-stock  holding  company  controlling  transport\ncompanies, was abolished by Decree No. 61 in 1994 when the Department of Transport was\nestablished within KGZMOTC. As a result of the restructuring, there are currently 89 transport\ncompanies operating trucks and buses. All of them have been privatized except for urban bus\nenterprises in major cities and some enterprises connected with State security.\n36.    As a result of measures that the Government introduced in 1994 to increase competition,\nthe  national  and  provincial  holding  companies  and  associations  (which  had  continued  to\nexercise control over the operations of individual transport companies) were abolished and the\nGovernment\u2019s shareholding in companies reduced through the auction of surplus vehicles and\nassets to private bidders. While the privatized transport companies have financial autonomy, the\nprivatization is far from success.  At the present levels of demand resulting in low utilization of\ntrucks (comparable with Kazakhstan, para. 22), few companies are commercially profitable.\nMost companies cover only their short-term operating costs and do not provide for depreciation\nand  fleet  replacement.  Some  companies  supplement  their  income  from  the  sale  of  older\nvehicles, while others lay off staff or rent vehicles to their drivers on a monthly basis for some\nbusiness. Few appear to have access to conventional credit arrangements and knowledge of\ncommercial business practices to sustain their businesses.\n37.     Freight transport customers are free to negotiate conditions in terms of price and quality\nof service directly with the operators. The role of the Department of Transport is limited to\nmonitoring and regulating, including licensing, inspection, and safety audit. Freight forwarders\nare encouraged to negotiate and arrange intermodal transport services, thus facilitating door-to-\ndoor transport arrangements, and to offer services directly themselves. For passenger transport,", "10\nthe route allocation mostly is on the basis of the lowest offered cost of operation since most of the\nroutes are currently not commercially viable for route-license bidding.\nv. Road Revenues and Expenditures\n38.  The Government expenditure in the road sector, funded by allocations from the State\nbudget, is inadequate. Against an annual requirement for rehabilitation and maintenance of\nroads estimated at about Som1 billion, the amount actually made available in 1998 was only\nSom270 million, including disbursements from the ADB-financed Road Rehabilitation Project\n(footnote 3). Considering the severe funding constraints and following the recommendations of\nthe ADB-financed study to improve road sector revenues to maintain and operate the road\n17\nnetwork,  the Government established the Road Fund by enacting the Road Fund Act on 1\nJune 1998.18 The Road Fund is based on the road-user principle, removing the earlier system of\ncollecting taxes for road works that were in no way related to the use of the roads.19 The Road\nFund is expected to cover the funding for the implementation of maintenance by contract, in\n20\ncase of a shortfall, the Government will make additional funds available from the budget.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n1.   Kazakhstan\n39.  The Government's overall strategic objectives for the transport sector are (i) ensuring the\nprovision and maintenance of adequate transport infrastructure to support the transition to a\nmarket-based economy, (ii) promoting competition while addressing safety and environmental\nconcerns, and (iii) increasing cost recovery. These objectives are pursued by (i) increasing the\nfinancial provisions for rehabilitation and maintenance of the road network; (ii) privatizing road\ntransport operations and dismantling licensing controls that hinder competition; (iii) promoting, in\ncollaboration with neighboring countries, the most efficient means of transport for large loads\nover long distances; (iv) privatizing inland waterway transport; (v) improving the civil aviation\ninfrastructure and supporting services that encourage operations by foreign and local airlines;\nand (vi) increasing sector revenues through appropriate pricing and taxation.\n40.  The Government's strategy for poverty reduction includes reforms in the overall social\nassistance and pension systems, the development of labor market programs, and the creation\nof  employment  opportunities.  Transport  sector  investments,  such  as  road  rehabilitation,\nenhance the possibilities for labor force participation (for both skilled and unskilled jobs) by the\nunemployed population during the construction and maintenance phases. The Government\nstrategy includes labor-intensive methods of construction at places where they are feasible. The\nscope for the development of small individual businesses and enterprises, especially in the rural\nareas, is enhanced by accessibility as the demand for additional goods and services increases.\n                  \n17 TA 2587-KGZ: Institutional Strengthening of the Road Sector, for $800,000, approved on 13 June 1996.\n18 The main sources of the Road Fund include 50 percent of the excise tax  ($45 per ton on gasoline and $25 per ton\non diesel), annual road user charges (vehicle tax depending on the size of the vehicle), vehicle registration\ncharges, and budgetary allocations.\n19 The main source was 0.8 percent tax on the gross revenue of all enterprises, excluding road transport enterprises,\nwhich paid a 2 percent tax on gross revenue.\n20 Covenanted under Loan 1630-KGZ(SF) (footnote 15).", "11\n2.  The Kyrgyz Republic\n41.   The  Government's  transport  sector  strategy  and  plans  are  included  in  the  Public\nInvestment Program prepared by the Ministry of Finance as well as in the Transport and Road\n21\nSector Policy Statement issued by KGZMOTC on 15 October 1997.  As in Kazakhstan, the\nGovernment's overall strategic objectives for the transport sector are (i) adequately maintaining\ntransport infrastructure to support reform of the economy; (ii) privatizing transport operations\nand  promoting  competition  among  operators,  while  addressing  safety  and  environmental\nconcerns; and (iii) increasing cost recovery from users of the transport infrastructure. The\nmeasures  to  achieve  these  objectives  include  (i)  increasing  the  financial  provision  for\nrehabilitation and maintenance of the road network; (ii) consolidating road sector responsibilities\nunder  KGZMOTC;  (iii)  promoting  private  sector  participation  in  road  maintenance;  (iv)\ncompleting the privatization of road transport operations and dismantling the licensing controls,\nwhich hinder competition; (v) promoting, in collaboration with the neighboring countries, rail\ntransport  as  the  most  efficient  means  of  transporting  bulk  loads  over  long  distances;  (vi)\nprivatizing lake shipping services; (vii) promoting the civil aviation infrastructure and supporting\nservices  that  encourage  foreign  and  local  airline  operations;  and  (viii)  increasing  sector\nrevenues through appropriate pricing and taxation.\n42.  The Government declared 1998 as the year of poverty reduction, and initiated the\nformulation of a national poverty reduction strategy (Araket). The Araket program entails a\nnumber of measures to strengthen the national labor market, reduce unemployment, support\nemployment  creation  activities,  and  provide  microcredit  schemes.  In  this  regard,  the\nGovernment is taking measures to attract significant investments in the national economy to\ncreate  additional  job  opportunities.  Ongoing  transport  projects  in  the  country  (e.g.,  ADB-\nfinanced road rehabilitation projects) have helped generate employment for poor people both in\nthe construction and maintenance works.\nC. External Assistance to the Sectors\n43.   During the FSU era, no external assistance was provided to the road sector and road\nnetworks  were  built  by  mobilizing  the  country\u2019s  resources  with  limited  economic  and  cost\nrecovery  considerations.  Since  independence  in  1991,  both  Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz\nRepublic have been actively mobilizing external assistance and have benefited from a number\nof country-specific as well as regional projects. The latter have included several regional TAs\nfrom ADB,22 as well as TAs provided by the European Union (EU) to eight FSU countries,\nincluding Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, in the areas of (i) standards and specifications\nfor construction materials and plants, (ii) winter maintenance, (iii) road pavement and bridge\ntesting, and (iv) prefeasibility studies for road and rail links (e.g., between Osh and Kashgar in\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, and Issyk-Kul and Kashgar). To ensure complementarity with\noperations of the World Bank and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), the\nproposed Project has been designed in close coordination with these institutions (paras. 44, 45\nand 53).\n                  \n21  Prepared under TA 2587-KGZ (footnote 17).\n22 TA 5620-REG: Regional Initiatives in Road Safety, for $600,000, approved on 4 January 1995; TA 5707-REG:\nRegional Economic Cooperation in Central Asia, for $1,150,000, approved on 8 November 1996; TA 5733-REG: A\nReview of Road Design and Construction Standards, for $600,000, approved on 3 April 1997; and TA 5818-REG:\nRegional Economic Cooperation in Central Asia (Phase II), for $1,350,000, approved on 11 December 1998.", "12\n1. Kazakhstan\n44.   Kazakhstan has been successful in mobilizing external assistance to develop its road\n23\nsector. The ongoing projects include ADB\u2019s Road Rehabilitation Project,  the World Bank\u2019s\nRoad Transport Restructuring Project ($84 million), and Islamic Development Bank\u2019s (IDB\u2019s)\nSaryshagan-Gulshad Road Project ($10 million), which complement each other in rehabilitating\nthe Almaty-Astana road (1,260 km) and establishing the related road maintenance system. ADB\nhas also provided three TA grants in the amount of $1.6 million.24 The Japan International\nCooperation Agency and JBIC are carrying out feasibility studies for rehabilitation of road\nsections in the western provinces of Kazakhstan and for reconstruction of a bridge over Irtysh\nRiver, respectively. The World Bank is also assisting in the urban transport subsector through its\nUrban Transport Project ($40 million). Assistance to the civil aviation and railways sectors\ncovers the Astana airport and Druzhba-Aktogoj railway projects financed by JBIC, and the\nAlmaty-Astana  railway  project  funded  by  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and\nDevelopment (EBRD).\n2. The Kyrgyz Republic\n45.   ADB\u2019s first and second loans of $50 million each, with cofinancing of about $28 million\nand $41 million, respectively, from JBIC, have helped the Government rehabilitate part of the\nBishkek-Osh road.25  In addition, ADB has provided five TA grants totaling $3.2 million to the\nroad sector.26 The World Bank approved a $22 million loan for the Urban Transport Project in\nAugust 2000 to rehabilitate urban roads in Bishkek, Djabal-Abad, and Osh. IDB approved $9\nmillion in 1998 to rehabilitate 49 km of the southern part of the Bishkek-Osh road and provided\ngrant assistance for a feasibility study for the rehabilitation of a section of the Bishkek-Naryn-\nTorugart road. In the Kyrgyz Republic too, ADB, JBIC, and IDB complement each other in an\neffort to rehabilitate the Bishkek-Osh road, the most important road corridor of the country.\nD. Lessons Learned\n46.  For the road sector in the CARs, ADB\u2019s focus has been on policy reforms to meet the\nchanging market demands, develop institutions capable of effective planning and management,\nensure adequate financing of road maintenance (particularly through road-user charges), and\npromote private sector participation. The most important lessons that have been learned to date\nconcern (i) the development of competitive markets; (ii) implementation of a road fund, and (iii)\nimproving road sector efficiency on a regional basis.\n47.   The development of competitive markets in the transport industry after the sale of State-\nowned property in the early 1990s has been a difficult process, particularly with regard to the\nintroduction of market-friendly systems and policies, delegation of authority to take decisions,\ndevelopment of institutional capacity, and undertaking complementary reforms to support the\nsystems. Competitive markets need a conducive environment. The road departments have\nneither adequate capacity nor a full understanding of the functioning of competitive markets.\n                  \n23 Loan 1455-KAZ: Road Rehabilitation Project, for $50 million, approved on 27 August 1996.\n24 TA 2258-KAZ: Preparation of Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 11 January 1995; TA 2631-\nKAZ (footnote 12); and TA 2632-KAZ (footnote 2).\n25 Loan 1444-KGZ (footnote 3); and Loan 1630-KGZ (footnote 15).\n26 TA 2256-KGZ: Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 21 December 1994; TA 2587-KGZ\n(footnote 17); TA 2760-KGZ: Second Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 11 February 1997;\nTA 3065-KGZ: Policy Support in the Transport Sector, for $600,000, approved on 10 September 1998; and TA\n3335-KGZ: Third Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 10 December 1999.", "13\nCosting and pricing procedures based on local norms, without accurately reflecting actual cost,\nhas been a hindrance to the introduction of competitive bidding. The existing FSU road standards\nare not suitable for operation in a market environment because of the tendency to regulate\nparameters that are the prerogative of contractors. As a result, the award of civil works in the\nCARs is often done by directly appointing the contractors and paying them based on local norms.\nADB\u2019s regional TA 5733-REG (footnote 22) for the preparation of road design and construction\nstandards incorporating Western practices to help implement road works based on competitive\n27\nbidding has been much appreciated,  but the standards are yet to be fully adopted. The two\nGovernments have agreed to do so effective 1 January 2002 [see para. 127 (vi) (e)].\n48.   The implementation of a road fund in the CARs is yet to bring the expected benefits in\nterms of improved road maintenance and increased involvement of road users. While the road\nfunds in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic have been redesigned to generate revenues\nmainly from sources that are closely related to road use, the concept that road-user costs\ngenerally dominate the cost pattern of road use (and therefore, it is economical to spend more on\nroad maintenance) is yet to be accepted and implemented. Also, road ownership is yet to be\nestablished by involving road users and other stake-holders such as the road transport industry,\ninsurance, contractors, and consultants (e.g., by creating independent road agencies with boards\nof directors that include representatives of such stakeholders).\n49.    Improving road sector efficiency on a regional basis, including implementation of road\nsafety  measures,  needs  to  be  given  priority.  While  the  ongoing  road  project  focuses  on\nimprovement of the national institutional capacity and competitive markets, the development of\nregional  transport  networks  for  regional  economic  cooperation  by  improving  efficiency  and\nsafety  of  the  regional  road  links  is  important  for  landlocked  CARs.  The  development  of\ncompetitive markets, the creation of road sector institutions involving the road users, and regional\ncooperation are a long-term process that needs to be implemented in a staged manner.  The\nproposed Project and the ongoing projects in the road sector financed by ADB and the World\nBank support these processes.\nE. ADB's Operational and Sector Strategies\n50.  The main objective of ADB's operation strategy in the CARs is to facilitate the countries\u2019\ntransition  to  a  market  economy.  This  objective  entails  (i)  supporting  the  countries\u2019  reform\nagenda and strengthening their development management, (ii) promoting the rehabilitation of\nthe environmental resource base, (iii) strengthening the long-term potential by investing in\nphysical infrastructure and human resources development, and (iv) encouraging the creation of\na new structure of output and new production capacity through private sector investment and\njob creation.\n51.    ADB  focuses  its  assistance  program  for  Kazakhstan  on  a  few  priority  sectors  and\nsubsectors:  (i)  management  and  reform  at  the  central  and  local  government  levels;\n(ii) infrastructure,  especially  rehabilitation  projects;  (iii)  education  and  training;  (iv)  industry,\nfocusing  on  the  problems  of  medium-size  enterprises;  and  (v)  agriculture.  In  the  Kyrgyz\nRepublic, to maximize the impact of ADB\u2019s limited resources, ADB\u2019s operation strategy focuses\non (i) improvements in the provision of public services; (ii) agriculture, including rural finance;\n(iii)  human  resource  development,  especially  education;  (iv)  infrastructure,  especially\n                  \n27 In addition to directly benefiting Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, and Uzbekistan, the road design\nstandards have been distributed to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.", "14\nrehabilitation projects to preserve the economic utility of the past investment in the road and\nenergy sectors; and (v) restructuring of the financial sector.\n \n52.    ADB's transport sector strategies in the two countries envisage support for (i) developing\nan  efficient  policy  and  regulatory  framework;  (ii)  corporatizing/commercializing  and,  where\nappropriate, privatizing road transport operations and entities; (iii) restructuring Government\norganizations  so  that  they  can  respond  efficiently  to  market  demands;  (iv)  creating  an\nenvironment  that  encourages  private  sector  participation;  (v)  promoting  competition  in  the\nprovision and operation of facilities and services; (vi) increasing funding by improving tax and\nduties collection, enhancing cost recovery, and removing subsidy-induced distortions in the\npricing of services; (vii) rehabilitating road infrastructure and improving maintenance operations\nand  safety  standards  of  infrastructure  facilities;  (viii)  developing  human  resources;  and\n(ix) protecting the environment by improving the environmental standards.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n53.   Reforms in the Kazakh and Kyrgyz road sectors in the areas of policy and regulatory\nframework,  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  development,  road  funding  and  cost\nrecovery, and road safety and maintenance are supported by the ongoing projects. As shown in\nAppendix 8, the policy issues discussed and agreed upon with the Governments during project\nprocessing strengthen and complement the earlier initiatives and provide a regional focus. The\nregional issues include  (i) streamlining the cross-border road transport and customs policies,\nregulations, and documentation; (iii) improving coordination and management of road safety,\nand  (iv)  introducing  road  maintenance  by  contract.  In  addition,  the  dialogue  has  covered\nassistance to KAZMOTC to help define its functions and sector objectives, given the institutional\ndislocation and structural and staff changes due to the transfer of the capital from Almaty to\nAstana.\n1.  Cross-Border Policy and Regulatory Issues\n54.   To facilitate regional economic cooperation, both Governments recognize the need for\nremoving the various physical and nonphysical cross-border barriers. For this purpose, the\nCross-Border  Agreement  (CBA)  drafted  with  the  help  of  ADB  to  regulate  and  ease  the\nmovement  of  people,  goods,  and  vehicles  across  the  common  border  was  signed  by  the\n28\nGovernments of Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic on 15 November 1999  and will become\neffective and binding to both countries (see para. 128). In addition to cross-border issues, the\nCBA stipulates weights and dimensions of vehicles to bring them in line with the axle-load limits\nin the Public Motor Roads: Design Standards and Regulations prepared under TA 5733-REG\n(footnote 22).\n55.   Support for the timely implementation of the CBA provisions will be provided with the\nhelp of two advisory TAs processed in conjunction with the Project. The TAs will help (i) review\nall  existing  customs  and  transport  documentation,  and  introduce  changes  in  line  with  the\nprovisions in the CBA; (ii) introduce proper customs procedures at the Kazakh/Kyrgyz (Akzhol-\nChu) border at Georgievka; and (iii) train staff in Transport International Routier (TIR) Carnet\nprocessing,29  vehicle  inspection  and  clearance  procedures,  the  use  of  risk  assessment\n                  \n28 The CBA signed on 15 November 1999 excluded exemption of import/export duties and taxes on transit traffic. As\nagreed during loan negotiations, an amendment to CBA that deals with exemption to transit traffic will be signed by\nthe two Governments by 25 October 2000.\n29 TIR Carnet is an international road transport logbook for international freight transporters.", "15\ntechniques,  and  the  use  of  computers  for  customs  clearance.  Equipment  required  for  the\nAutomated Customs Clearance System (ACCS) and training in the use of such equipment will\nbe  provided  by  EU\u2019s  Transport  Corridor  Europe  Caucasus  Asia  (TRACECA)  project.  The\nintroduction of the ACCS and computerized cargo registration will be implemented as a pilot\nprogram to permit international electronic data processing and possible external input through\ndirect trader input linkages. The introduction of the revised procedures and computerized ACCS\nwill  make  the  system  transparent  and  will  remove  nonphysical  customs  barriers,  including\nunauthorized payments, at the Akzhol-Chu border now and at other border crossings later. This\nis  expected  to  give  impetus  to  an  overall  reform  of  the  customs  departments  in  the  two\ncountries.\n2.  Road Safety\n56.   Road safety is a multidimensional social problem involving many sectors: education,\nhealth, police, and transport as well as the private sector involved in insurance, fuel supply, and\nbus and freight transport operations. The activities have to be complementary and coordinated\nso that road safety measures can be optimized to avoid loss of resources on account of vehicle\ndamage, medical treatment, police and administration costs, and damage to road facilities.\nSuch  coordination  of,  and  participation  by,  the  stakeholders  can  be  achieved  through  the\nestablishment of national road safety council (NRSC).  While the issues in preparing safety\naction plans, improving collection and processing of road accident data, and developing better\nunderstanding  of  road  safety  problems  have  been  addressed  by  the  World  Bank\u2019s Road\nTransport  Restructuring  Project  (para.  16)  for  Kazakhstan  and  ADB\u2019s  Second  Road\nRehabilitation Project (footnote 15) for the Kyrgyz Republic, the establishment of the NRSC in\nthe Kyrgyz Republic and updating of the road safety acts (RSAs) of both the countries will help\nstrengthen regional coordination and expedite the implementation of  the road safety initiatives.\n30\n57.   While an Interdepartmental Commission of Road Safety exists in Kazakhstan,  the\nGovernment of Kyrgyz Republic has agreed to establish the NRSC by 1 January 2002 with a\nfull-time secretariat to coordinate road safety activities and involve the various stakeholders\n[para. 127 (vi) (a)]. The RSAs will be updated for submission to the Parliaments by 1 June 2002\n[para. 127 (vi) (b)]. The RSAs will include legislation concerning safe driving, safety audit of road\ndesigns, safety education, road safety publicity, vehicle safety standards, road safety research,\nand  emergency  assistance  to  accident  victims.  In  addition,  the  RSAs  will  include  legal\nprovisions regarding the responsibility of road maintenance contractors for environmental and\nsocial  impact  mitigation  measures  and  road  safety-related  works  (e.g.,  signposts,  road\nmarkings, etc.), and liabilities in case the contractors fail to undertake/maintain such measures\nand works. The two advisory TAs will help the Governments in establishing the NRSC, updating\nthe RSAs, preparing a Russian version of the Road Safety Guidelines,31 and conducting road\nsafety seminars to implement the Road Safety Guidelines.\n3.  Road Maintenance\n58.   An equipment pool will be established in Kazakhstan with the help of the consultants\nunder the ADB loan.32 The pool, a State-owned joint-stock company, will manage and lease\nequipment  for  maintaining  the  Almaty-Astana  and  Almaty-Bishkek  roads.  Depending  on\n                  \n30 Established by Government Decree No. 391 dated 28 April 1998.\n31 Prepared under TA 5620-REG (footnote 22).\n32 Such equipment pool is being established in the Kyrgyz Republic under the Second Road Rehabilitation Project\n(footnote 15).", "16\navailability,  the  pool  may  also  rent  out  the  equipment  on  a  commercial  basis  for  other\nconstruction and maintenance works to ensure its effective utilization and adequate return on\nthe investment. The equipment will also be rented out to private contractors to help them\ncompete for road construction and maintenance works.  The concept will subsequently be\nextended to other parts of the country. The equipment pool is expected to be operational from\n30 June 2002 [para. 127 (vi) (c)].\n59.   The ADB-financed consultants will help establish the equipment hire system, and the\nrelated servicing and repair workshop, and will provide guidance and on-the-job training to\nequipment operators, workshop mechanics, and the foreman. The equipment hire system will\nincorporate proper accounting, equipment hiring and maintenance procedures, and appropriate\nprovisions for depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses.\n60.   Experience gained in other countries (particularly in the Philippines) shows that contracts\nconsisting only of routine maintenance works are less attractive to construction contractors\nbecause  of  the  need  for  a  large  resource  commitment  (e.g.,  equipment)  to  undertake  a\ncomparatively small amount of work spread over long distances. The proposed concept of road\nmaintenance by contract will focus on creating an environment conducive to local contractors\u2019\nparticipation in maintenance works by hiring equipment from the pool. A maintenance manual\nand contracts must be prepared, and both government supervisors and respective contractors\ntrained before road maintenance by contract is implemented. There are several advantages to\nthis approach: separation of the planning and supervision functions from the implementation\nfunctions, execution of road maintenance under a proper contract, local employment generation,\neffective  equipment  management,  private  sector  development,  and  better  maintenance  of\nroads. While the Maintenance Operation Manual is being prepared under the ongoing Road\nRehabilitation Project  (footnote  23),  the  design  and  construction  supervision  consultants\nengaged under the proposed Project will establish equipment leasing system, prepare the\ncontracts  and  train  the  maintenance  supervision  staff  and  local  contractors.  The  two\nGovernments have agreed to award maintenance contracts for the Almaty-Bishkek road on a\ncompetitive bidding basis from 1 January 2005 [para. 127 (vi) (d)].\n4.  Advisory Support to  KAZMOTC\n61.   In view of the ongoing reform process in the road sector institutions and the institutional\ndislocation and structural and staff changes due to the transfer of the capital from Almaty to\nAstana, the Government of Kazakhstan has requested ADB assistance to help KAZMOTC\nstreamline  the  functions  and  responsibilities  of  CRRT  and  Kazakhavtodor  in  line  with  the\npolicies  adopted  under  the  Road  Sector  Policy  Statement  of  31  March  1996.  Under  the\nproposed advisory TA, a transport adviser will be engaged for transport policy review, transport\nplanning, regulations, pricing, procurement, and preparation of a three-year national transport\ninvestment plan.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n62.  The rehabilitation of the Almaty-Bishkek road is an integral component of ADB\u2019s strategy\nin Central Asia to promote economic growth and reduce poverty.  A transport link such as the\nAlmaty-Bishkek road, free of physical and human-made barriers, will contribute to bringing the\nseparated and isolated domestic markets in each country into one integrated regional market.\nThis,  in  turn,  will  allow  the  countries  to  exploit  economies  of  scale  and  resource", "17\ncomplementarities.  Conversely, without such an integrated market, these countries are likely to\nsuffer from lower growth and slower poverty reduction because of their isolated geographic\nlocation  and  limited  potentials  for  domestic  market  expansion.    The  increase  in  economic\nactivities due to the improved road will have a general positive impact on poverty reduction in\nthe region.  More specifically, since the road goes through, or is adjacent to, some of the\npoorest areas of the two countries, the improved road efficiency will contribute to poverty\nreduction in the area through better and more reliable access to the economic mainstream.\n63.   The Almaty-Bishkek road is at a cross-link between the road corridors that connect the\nFar East with Europe and Fergana Valley with Russia. While it is part of the east-west corridor\npassing through Urumqui in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the state capitals and\nmost  commercial  centers  in  the  CARs  such  as  Almaty,  Bishkek,  Shymkent,  Tashkent,\nSamarkand and Ashgabat, the Almaty-Bishkek road also links two important north-south roads,\nnamely, Almaty-Astana and Bishkek-Osh. Improvement of these two north-south roads has\nbeen given high priority by both Governments and is supported by ADB, World Bank, JBIC and\nIDB (see Map). The Almaty-Bishkek road is a crucial section that requires rehabilitation to\npermit smooth and safe international and regional traffic flow in all seasons, thus fostering\nregional economic cooperation.\n64.   The Almaty-Bishkek road is an important conduit for imports and exports of the CARs.\nBishkek is the main import center for the Kyrgyz Republic. The major imports transported by\nroad  are  consumer  goods,  foodstuff,  beverages  and  machinery  from  Europe,  timber  from\nRussia, and lower value consumer goods (such as garments) from the PRC. The road is also an\nimportant conduit for imports to Kazakhstan, including Kyrgyz agricultural products and cement.\nIn general, the project road is an important link for the transport of agricultural and industrial\ngoods in the region, including transit traffic to the PRC (e.g., cotton from Uzbekistan).\n65.   Economic reform and political realignment in Central Asia, and the emergence of free\ntrade  areas  and  custom  unions  underline  the  need  for  an  efficient  transport  system  and\nharmonization of trade and transport regulations. The former is one of the basic prerequisites for\nthe future economic development of Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, considering their\nlandlocked character. Regarding the latter, efforts to streamline the international trade and\ncustoms issues and harmonize the regulations\u2013which have started with the help of the United\nNations  Conference  on  Trade  and  Development  (UNCTAD),  EU,  Economic  Cooperation\nOrganization (ECO), and the Customs Union\u2013have to continue.33 While the rehabilitation of road\ninfrastructure will result in savings in vehicle operation costs (VOCs), the transport efficiency of\nan important regional road link such as the Almaty-Bishkek road will also depend on the\nremoval  of  physical  and  nonphysical  cross-border  barriers,  improved  coordination  and\nmanagement of road safety initiatives, and adequate road maintenance. The proposed Project\naims at achieving all these objectives, with a view to subsequently extending the concept to\nother cross-border links in the region.\n66.   ADB\u2019s TA 5707-REG (footnote 22) confirmed that the Almaty-Bishkek road is a critical\nsection requiring improvement to permit smooth and safe traffic flow in all seasons. Almaty, the\ncapital of Kazakhstan until 1997, is the largest city and a key center of finance, commerce, and\nindustry such as textiles and canned goods plants, while Bishkek is the capital of the Kyrgyz\n                  \n33  The three important agreements are ECO Transit Transport Agreement prepared with the help of UNCTAD; Multi-\nLateral Agreement prepared with the help of EU; and Agreement Between the People\u2019s Republic of China, Kyrgyz\nRepublic, and Uzbekistan on International Road Traffic, signed by the three countries.", "18\nRepublic. Both Governments have given priority to the rehabilitation of the road linking Almaty\nwith Bishkek.\n67.    There is a high incidence of road accidents in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic,\nresulting in an annual rate of 30 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles. In 1996, 110 accidents on the\nKazakh section of the Almaty-Bishkek road left 50 persons dead and 120 with serious injuries.\nAlthough no data are available to assess the related road accident costs, it can be assumed that\nat least 1 percent of GDP is lost annually through road accidents.34 Well-coordinated road safety\nprograms at both regional and national levels are therefore essential.\nB.  Objective and Scope\n68.   The objective of the Project is to improve the efficiency and safety of the principal\nsubregional  road  transport  link  between  Almaty  and  Bishkek  by  rehabilitating  the  road\ninfrastructure,  modernizing  border  control  policies  and  procedures,  upgrading  cross-border\nfacilities,  improving  the  coordination  and  management  of  road  safety,  and  introducing  an\nefficient road maintenance system.\n69.    The Project comprises (i) rehabilitation of about 245 km of the Almaty-Bishkek road,\nincluding  consulting  services  for  design  and  construction  supervision;  (ii)  improvement  of\ncustoms  facilities  at  the  Akzhol-Chu  border;  and  (iii)  road  maintenance  equipment  for\nKazakhstan.  The  associated  advisory  TAs  will  help  implement  the  CBA  and  road  safety\ninitiatives in both countries, and will provide transport advisory support to KAZMOTC.\nC. Technical Justification\n70.  The Project will rehabilitate about 204 km of the road from the Almaty City boundary to\nthe Akzhol-Chu border at Georgievka and about 41 km in the Kyrgyz Republic consisting of a 17\nkm section from the Akzhol-Chu border to the Bishkek City boundary and a 24 km bypass\ninterconnecting the Bishkek-Akzhol-Chu border road with the Bishkek-Osh road. Much of the\nroad between Almaty and Bishkek was completed 20-25 years ago and was designed according\nto the FSU standards. The pavement shows distress in the form of surface cracks on the entire\nlength and rutting35 at a number of places. The poor condition of the bituminous surface is\nattributable to past paving methods and lack of quality control. Rehabilitation is required to\nprevent the road from deteriorating further. The rehabilitation will consist of reconstructing failed\nembankments, providing a crushed aggregate base course, surfacing with asphalt concrete,\nand improving the shoulders and drainage facilities. Rehabilitation does not include any major\nwidening or upgrading works.\n71.   The Almaty-Bishkek road has two critical sections (km 167\u2013km 171 and km 184\u2013km\n191) over the Kurday mountain pass. They have been identified as most hazardous because of\nsteep gradients and sharp curves at a number of places. The trucks and buses travel very\nslowly on these sections during summer and are unable to cross the mountain pass during\nwinter when the road is slippery because of snow. A high rate of road accidents has been\n                  \n34 According to the World Bank and ADB studies, road accidents cost about 1-3 percent of a country's GDP.\nAssuming the lower bound, for the 1998 Kazakh GDP of T1,747 billion, the loss would have amounted to T17\nbillion or $222 million; for the Kyrgyz GDP of Som33 billion, the loss would be about Som333 million or $19 million.\n35Furrows made by truck wheels, which develop due to densification and deformation in the lower pavement layers\nunder traffic loading, and/or plastic flow in bituminous surfaces under high temperatures and tire pressures\n(normally forming where the bituminous materials are soft).", "19\nrecorded, mainly due to overturning of vehicles going downhill. These two sections will be\nrealigned to substantially improve their gradients and curvatures.\n72.   With the establishment of the equipment pool, the system for road maintenance by\ncontract will be introduced along the Almaty-Bishkek road and compared with maintenance by\nforce account for its efficiency and costs. The system will also incorporate service and safety\nconsiderations, and environmental and social impact mitigation measures.\nD. Cost Estimates\n73.      The  total  Project  cost  is  estimated  at  $119.1  million  equivalent.  For  the  Kazakh\ncomponent, the cost estimate is $112.4 million equivalent (foreign exchange cost of $58.9 million\nand local currency cost of 53.5 million equivalent). For the Kyrgyz component, the cost estimate is\n$6.7 million equivalent (foreign exchange cost of $3.7 million and local currency cost of $3.0\nmillion  equivalent).  The  estimates  are  summarized  in  Table  1,  and  presented  in  detail  in\nAppendix 9.\nTable 1: Project Cost Summary\n($ million)\nKazakhstan Kyrgyz Republic Combined\nItem FX LC Total FX LC Total Total\nA.

Financing Plan\n74.   The financing plan for the Project is in Table 2. For the Kazakh component, the proposed\nADB loan will be $65.0 million (57.8 percent), with a parallel EBRD cofinancing of $25.0 million\n(22.2 percent), Government financing of $22.0 million equivalent (19.6 percent), and a TRACECA\ngrant of $0.4 million (0.4 percent). For the Kyrgyz component, the proposed ADB loan will be\n$5.0 million (74.6 percent), supplemented by Government financing of $1.3 million equivalent\n(19.4 percent), and a TRACECA grant of $0.4 million (6.0 percent) (details in Appendix 9).\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nKazakhstan Kyrgyz Republic Combined\nSource FX LC Total % FX LC Total % Total\n%\nADB 46.0 19.0  65.0  57.8 3.3 1.7 5.0  74.6  59.3\nEBRD 12.5  12.5 25.0  22.2 - - - -  20.3\nTRACECA 0.4 -   0.4   0.4 0.4 - 0.4   6.0   0.7\nGovernment - 22.0  22.0  19.6 - 1.3 1.3  19.4  19.7\nTotal 58.9 53.5 112.4 100.0 3.7 3.0 6.7 100.0 100.0\nEBRD = European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, FX = foreign exchange, LC = local currency,\nTRACECA = Transport Corridor Europe Caucasus Asia.\n75.   While  the  TRACECA  component  has  been  approved  by  EU,  EBRD  is  expected  to\napprove parallel cofinancing in the amount of $25.0 million in November 2000. EBRD will\nfinance 50.4 km of civil works in Kazakhstan.\n76.   For the Kazakh component, the Borrower will be the Republic of Kazakhstan. The ADB\nloan will be provided in US dollars with interest rate determined in accordance with ADB's pool-\nbased variable lending rate system for US dollar loans, and an amortization period of 24 years\nincluding a grace period of 4 years, an annual commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum\nand a front-end fee of 1 percent of the loan amount. The proposed ADB loan will finance 78.1\npercent of the foreign exchange cost and 35.5 percent of the local currency cost, EBRD will\nmeet 21.2 percent of the foreign exchange cost and 23.4 percent of the local currency cost, and\nthe TRACECA grant will finance 0.7 percent of the foreign exchange cost. The Government will\nfinance the remaining 41.1 percent of the local currency cost.\n77.  For the Kyrgyz component, the Borrower will be the Kyrgyz Republic. The ADB loan will\nbe provided from its Special Funds resources. The loan will have a 32-year amortization period\nincluding an 8-year grace period, with a 1.0 percent interest charge during the grace period and\n1.5  percent  thereafter.    The  proposed  ADB  loan  will  finance  89.2  percent  of  the  foreign\nexchange cost, and 56.7 percent of the local currency cost. The TRACECA grant will finance\nthe remaining 10.8 percent of the foreign exchange cost, and the Government the remaining\n43.3 percent of the local currency cost.\n78.   The economic slowdown following the Russian crisis that began in 1998 has profoundly\naffected both the Kazakh and Kyrgyz economies.  As a result, fiscal constraints facing the\nGovernments have become even tighter. During 1999, the Government of Kazakhstan has\ncontinued  its  efforts  at  domestic  resource  mobilization  as  evidenced  by  spending  cuts", "21\nincorporated in the second budget revision adopted in June 1999. At present, the Government\nis working with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on further reducing expenditure and other\nmeasures to strengthen fiscal stability. The Government of Kyrgyz Republic, in consultation with\nthe IMF under the ESAF program, has been engaged in working out measures for further fiscal\nstrengthening.  Meanwhile, the severe fiscal constraints are likely to persist during the project\nimplementation  period  in  both  countries  since  the  economic  and  fiscal  situation  can  only\nimprove gradually.  Therefore, local cost financing is considered appropriate for the project.\nF. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Basic Approach\n79.  For  the  project  objectives  to  be  achieved,  it  will  be  necessary  to  coordinate  the\nimplementation of both physical and nonphysical components in Kazakhstan and in the Kyrgyz\nRepublic for concurrent progress and completion. It will also be necessary to lower in concert\nthe nonphysical barriers to movement across the border so that regardless of the direction of\nmovement, similar procedures are applied and delays are avoided. The loan documents include\na  number  of  cross-conditionality  provisions  to  ensure  that  the  various  components  are\nsynchronized during project implementation.\n2. The Executing Agencies\na. Kazakhstan\n80.   The KAZMOTC will be the Executing Agency. The project steering committee (PSC)\nestablished under the ongoing project in June 1996 will be responsible for (i) overseeing and\ncoordinating the project activities, including liaison among the agencies involved in project\nimplementation, and sector reforms; (ii) reviewing the status of the implementation of the project\ncomponents; (iii) monitoring the progress achieved and resolving difficulties encountered; and\n(iv)  serving  as  a  forum  for  discussions  on  and  review  of  the  project  impact  on  regional\ndevelopment. The PSC is chaired by the Minister of KAZMOTC (or his representative), and the\nmembers are the chairman of CRRT, director general of Kazakhavtodor, Chief of Investment\nProject Division of KAZMOTC, and representatives from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry\nof Economy.\n81.   KAZMOTC  will  discharge  its  functions  through  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)\nreporting to the Board of Investment Projects. The PIU will be established by 1 November 2000\nand will be headed by a qualified project manager responsible for the rehabilitation component.\nBy 1 July 2003, a maintenance supervision unit (MSU) will be established in the PIU, headed by\na  maintenance  manager  responsible  for  the  road  maintenance  component.  The  project\nmanager will be supported by road engineers, materials and soils engineer, bridge engineer,\nand supporting financial and clerical staff.  The PIU and MSU will remain adequately staffed\nthroughout  project  implementation  and  will  be  assisted  by  the  international  and  domestic\nconsultants for design and construction supervision financed under the proposed ADB loan. The\nPIU  and  MSU  will  undertake  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  Project  and  provide  the\nnecessary liaison between KAZMOTC, contractors, suppliers, and ADB.", "22\nb.  The Kyrgyz Republic\n82.   The KGZMOTC will be the Executing Agency. The PSC similar to that in Kazakhstan\nhas been established within KGZMOTC for the ongoing projects in the Kyrgyz Republic. The\nPSC will carry out the same functions as its Kazakh counterpart.\n83.   Considering the small size of the Kyrgyz component, the PIU established under the\nongoing projects will also be given the responsibility for implementation of the proposed Project.\nTo strengthen the PIU\u2019s capacity, two additional technical staff will be made available on a full-\ntime basis during the implementation period. The PIU will be assisted by the international and\ndomestic consultants to be recruited for design and construction supervision and will provide the\nnecessary liaison among KGZMOTC, contractors, suppliers, and ADB.\n3. Implementation Schedule\n84.   Project implementation will commence in the beginning of 2001. The Kyrgyz component\nis expected to be completed in three years, i.e., by the end of 2003, and the Kazakh component\nin four years, i.e., by the end of 2004 (Appendix 10).\n4. Procurement\n85.  Procurement of goods and services under the ADB loans will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for\nProcurement. As shown in Appendix 11, the civil works for the Kazakh component will be split\ninto two packages. The ADB-financed package (covering 154 km of civil works) and road\nmaintenance equipment will be procured through international competitive bidding and the\ncofinanced  package  (50.4  km  of  civil  works)  will  follow  EBRD\u2019s  procurement  guidelines.\nCustoms equipment will be procured following TRACECA\u2019s international shopping procedures,\nand laboratory equipment following ADB\u2019s international shopping procedures.\n \n86.   The  civil  works  for  the  Kyrgyz  component  will  be  procured  using  local  competitive\n36\nbidding procedures acceptable to ADB,  mainly because such small contracts are not attractive\nto international contractors, given the need to mobilize resources such as road construction\nequipment to Central Asia.  The rehabilitation works involved\u2013overlays and drainage works\u2013are\nsimple, and the local contractors have adequate capability to undertake contracts for them.\nAlso, the Kyrgyz Republic is experiencing severe financial difficulties and the Government is\nkeen to provide employment opportunities to its people without sacrificing the integrity of the\nProject.  Integrity  will  be  ensured  by  following  proper  bidding  procedures  and  international\nconsultants supervising the works.\n5. Consulting Services\n87.       Design and construction supervision in each country, including for the section in\nKazakhstan  to  be  financed  by  EBRD,  will  be  undertaken  by  international  consultants  in\nassociation with domestic consultants financed by ADB. The consultants will be selected and\nengaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other procedures\nsatisfactory to ADB for recruitment of domestic consultants. The terms of reference for the\nconsulting services are in Appendix 12.\n                  \n36 With the option that international contractors interested to participate in the tendering will be allowed to bid.", "23\n88.   The  consulting  services  in  Kazakhstan  will  comprise  about  342  person-months  (90\ninternational and 252 domestic). In the Kyrgyz Republic, the input will be about 50 person-\nmonths  (20  international  and  30  domestic).    In  providing  the  services,  the  international\nconsultants will ensure on-the-job training of and transfer of expertise to staff of the Executing\nAgencies and domestic design and construction supervision companies, particularly in project\nand contract management, and environment protection and road safety measures.\n6. Disbursement\n89.    Direct payment procedures described in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook will be\nused  for  the  civil  works,  road  maintenance  equipment,  and  consulting  services  contracts.\nDisbursement to meet the incremental project administration cost (project management) will be\nreimbursed using the statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure with SOE ceilings of $60,000\nand $30,000 per individual payment for Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, respectively. The\nCRRT has been showing administrative capability to maintain SOE records and accounts in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n7. Reports, Accounts, and Audits\n90.   The project supervision consultants in Kazakhstan will prepare and submit quarterly\nreports on the progress of implementation to KAZMOTC, ADB, and EBRD, and in the Kyrgyz\nRepublic to KGZMOTC and ADB. The TA consultants will prepare and submit brief monthly\nprogress reports on the implementation of the CBA. The format of the reports will be discussed\nand agreed upon before the start of the consulting services. To facilitate postevaluation of the\nProject, KAZMOTC and KGZMOTC will arrange for the consultants to submit to ADB and EBRD\nproject completion reports covering the execution and initial operation of the facilities, within\nthree months of the physical completion of the Project.\n91.   For their respective components, KAZMOTC and KGZMOTC will maintain separate\nrecords and accounts adequate to (i) identify the goods and services financed out of the\nproceeds of the loans from counterpart local funds; (ii) identify the use of these goods and\nservices on the components; (iii) record the progress of the components, including their costs;\nand (iv) reflect, in accordance with consistently maintained sound accounting, the components\u2019\noperations and financial condition.\n92.   The  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  by\nexternal auditors acceptable to ADB for the ADB-financed portion and to EBRD for the EBRD-\nfinanced  component.  If  qualified  State  auditors  are  not  available,  private  auditors  will  be\nrecruited following the competitive recruitment procedures of the Governments and using their\nown  resources  or  loan  funds.    The  audited  accounts  and  auditors\u2019  report,  prepared  in\naccordance with internationally accepted accounting standards, will be submitted to ADB within\nnine months of the end of the fiscal year.\n8. Tripartite Coordination Meeting\n93.   Representatives of Kazakhstan (KAZMOTC and Kazakh Customs), the Kyrgyz Republic\n(KGZMOTC and Kyrgyz Customs), and the financiers (ADB, EBRD, and TRACECA) will meet\ntwice a year alternatively in Almaty and Bishkek to discuss the project implementation status,\nresolve  common  problems,  and,  most  importantly,  ensure  full  implementation  of  the  CBA.\nKAZMOTC and KGZMOTC will finance the costs incurred in preparing for and attending these\nmeetings through the project management component of their respective loans.", "24\n9. Midterm Review\n   \n94.    Toward the end of 2002, ADB with KAZMOTC and KGZMOTC, will undertake a detailed\nreview of the Project and its implementation status. The objectives will be to (i) evaluate the\nGovernments\u2019 progress in implementing policy reforms; (ii) examine the implementation of the\nProject and determine whether any adjustments to the scope and implementation arrangements\nare warranted; (iii) determine compliance with relevant standards, (iv) address any potential\nprocurement, financing, and scheduling issues; and (iii) examine compliance with the loan\ncovenants.\n10.  Monitoring and Evaluation\n95.   KAZMOTC  and  KGZMOTC,  with  the  assistance  of  their  respective  supervision\nconsultants, will carry out benefit monitoring and evaluation by compiling and analyzing the\nappropriate  border  crossing,  traffic,  axle  load,  and  socioeconomic  data.  For  this  purpose,\nKAZMOTC and KGZMOTC will agree on appropriate surveys to establish baseline data before\nproject implementation, and direct their respective supervision consultants to carry them out.\nSocioeconomic indicators to be monitored will include passenger fares and freight rates, traffic\nspeed  and  accidents,  agricultural  and  industrial  goods  transported  on  the  road,  vehicle\noperation and maintenance costs, and number and type of jobs created in the construction and\nmaintenance activities. The data provided will be disaggregated by gender and collected during\nproject implementation and after completion. Environmental monitoring will be undertaken as\ndetailed  in  the  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  report.  The  findings  and\nsupporting  data  will  be  incorporated  in  the  project  completion  reports.  KAZMOTC  and\nKGZMOTC will evaluate the benefits from their components in accordance with the schedules\nand terms of reference to be agreed upon with ADB.\n  11. Anticorruption Policy\n96.      During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to the Kazakh and\nKyrgyz Government officials.  Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption in\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement  and  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  It  was\nemphasized that ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy requires the borrowers (including beneficiaries of\nADB  loans),  as  well  as  the  consultants/bidders/suppliers/contractors  under  ADB-financed\ncontracts, to observe the highest standard of ethics during the recruitment, procurement, and\nexecution of such contracts; and that sanctions, as per the guidelines, would be taken if fraud\nand corruption are discovered. The Governments are committed to creating corruption-free\nenvironments and would like the Project to be implemented strictly following ADB\u2019s guidelines.\nADB has conducted a number of seminars37 on its operation policies and procedures in which\ncorrupt and fraudulent practices were spelled out and ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy explained to\nthe  participants.  The  Governments\u2019  pricing  and  procurement  procedures  are  being\nstrengthened38 to conform with the requirements of the relevant law, and audits of project\naccounts are being carried out with the help of external auditors in accordance with generally\naccepted auditing standards.\n                  \n37 TA 2732-KAZ: Seminars on Bank Operation Policies and Procedures, for $85,000, approved on 24 December\n1996; and TA 2982-KGZ: Seminars on Bank Operation Policies and Procedures, for $114,000, approved on 23\nJanuary 1998.\n38 The assistance will be provided by the transport adviser under the Project for Kazakhstan and under Loan 1630-\nKGZ (footnote 15) for the Kyrgyz Republic.", "25\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1.    Environmental Impacts\n97.   ADB  has  classified  the  Project  in  environmental  category  B.  Initial  environmental\nexamination (IEE) was carried out with the help of TA 2632-KAZ for the Kazakh component\n(footnote 2) and by construction supervision consultants under Loan 1444-KGZ for the Kyrgyz\ncomponent (footnote 3) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Requirements\nand Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. The SIEE in Appendix 13\npresents the main findings and recommendations.\n98.    The project road passes through varied terrain, valleys, high mountains and mountain\npasses, agricultural (farmland and grazing grounds) and nonagricultural lands, and areas with\nlow and medium population densities. No designated wetlands, forests, nature conservation\nareas, and places of archaeological importance exist within the project area. Trees have been\nplanted along the road in many sections as protection against embankment erosion and noise\nand dust pollution in the nearby settlements.\n99.    Road rehabilitation will be carried out on the existing alignment, except at two sections\nwith a total length of 12 km in the mountainous areas of Kurday Pass in Kazakhstan. The area\naffected by the realignment is a wasteland. Rehabilitation will include reconstructing failed\nembankments,  removing  and  replacing  some  layers  of  road  structure,  and  improving  the\ndrainage systems. Borrow areas and quarries, construction and camps, road haulage, and road\ndiversions will have some temporary impacts during construction.\n100.     The IEE indicates that the potential negative environmental impacts can be mitigated to\nan acceptable level. The mitigation measures include (i) selecting land for construction camps,\nborrow areas, and quarries in wasteland areas and restoring them soon after the completion of\nconstruction; (ii) preventing any aggravation in the soil erosion-prone areas; (iii) controlling\nsewage discharge and other waste fluids from construction camps, and hazardous and toxic\nmaterials from asphalt and crushing plants and from construction equipment; (iv) maintaining\nproper drainage to avoid stagnation and controlling downstream water pollution; (v) reinstating\nvegetation and trees that are affected by construction activities but are needed to prevent soil\nerosion;  (vi)  controlling  disturbance  to  animals  and  pastures;  (vii)  minimizing  noise,  dust,\nemissions and other pollutants associated with road rehabilitation works through limitations on\nworking hours, dust control devices, and water sprays; (viii) minimizing the potential negative\nimpacts  on  the  approach  roads  in  the  vicinity  of  the  project  road  through  appropriate\nmaintenance  activities;  and  (ix)  training  the  contractors\u2019  workforce  in  the  prevention  of\ncommunicable and infectious diseases. The civil works contracts will include these mitigation\nmeasures,  and  the  construction  supervision  consultants,  Executing  Agencies,  and  the\nconcerned national environmental organizations will monitor their implementation. No significant\nimpacts are expected after project completion. The road maintenance contracts will include\nmitigation  measures  during  operation  of  the  project  road  to  enhance  environmental\nsustainability.\n101.   In  Kazakhstan,  environmental  monitoring  and  coordination,  and  implementation  of\npolicies and legislation are carried out by the Ministry of Ecology and Bioresources (MEB) at the\nnational level and by MEB\u2019s Department of Ecology and Bioresources (DEB) at the regional\nlevel. The IEE indicated that the current institutional setup is adequate. The DEB of Almaty and\nZhambul regions will be closely associated with the implementation of the Project. Similarly, in\nthe Kyrgyz Republic the Ministry of Environmental Protection is responsible for environmental", "26\npolicy, regulations, and monitoring. Since Chui where the Project road is located is on the\nperiphery of Bishkek, the ministry, with the help of the construction supervision consultants, will\nmonitor the environmental impacts during implementation and operation of the Kyrgyz portion of\nthe project road.\n2. Social Impacts\n102.   The summary social impact assessment (SSIA) in Appendix 14 describes the results of\nthe initial social assessment prepared under TA 2632-KAZ (footnote 2) and identifies the social\nimpacts related to the Project and the recommended mitigation measures.\n103.    The project influence area (PIA) consists of Almaty City, and Almaty and Zhambul\nregions in Kazakhstan, and Chui region, including Bishkek City, in the Kyrgyz Republic. The\ntotal population in the PIA is about 4.5 million. Excluding Bishkek and Almaty, up to 70 percent\nof  the  population  is  rural.  The  agriculture  sector  provides  employment  in  the  settlements\ncrossed by the road. Industrial and service sectors (e.g., mining, agroprocessing, textile and\nmechanic industries) are developed in Almaty City, Almaty region, the border city of Georgievka,\nand Chui region.\n104.  Residents in the PIA have been reacting very positively to the idea of rehabilitating the\nAlmaty-Bishkek road as they expect (i) employment in construction and construction-related\njobs; (ii) benefits from the additional demand for construction materials and services, and faster\nand cheaper access to Almaty, Bishkek, and other markets in the area; and  (iii) proper traffic\nmanagement, road safety, and environmental provisions including more trees planted along the\nroad. The residents also expressed concerns about the safety of the villagers living in the\nsettlements crossed by the road, restoration and improvement of the existing drainage system,\nand maintenance of the road after rehabilitation. Representatives of drivers\u2019 union associations\nand transport operators stated the need for more organized service stations along the road, and\nexpressed dissatisfaction with customs procedures and waiting time at the Akzhol-Chu border.\n105.    During construction, some temporary adverse impacts associated with road diversion,\nnoise, dust, disruption of drainage systems, borrow areas and quarries, and the establishment\nof labor camps are expected. Also, pressure on the existing health facilities in the PIA will\nincrease due to the influx of construction workers, and the associated greater risk of diseases\n(e.g., communicable diseases) and health hazards at the construction site.\n106.    Although no severe and/or permanent adverse social impacts are expected as a result of\nthe Project, the recommended mitigation measures will be implemented and monitored at all\nstages of construction. To ensure road safety, fencing will be installed and pedestrian crossings\nwill be marked in the residential areas. Since the influx of workers involved in the rehabilitation\nworks could increase the spread of communicable and infectious diseases in the PIA, the\nKAZMOTC and KGZMOTC will advise the consultants and contractors to distribute information\nmaterials and make basic training in the prevention of these diseases as part of the safety\ntraining for the workforce.\n107.    Road rehabilitation will follow the current alignment, with the exception of two sections at\nthe Kurday mountain pass, and does not involve any upgrading or major widening. In those\nsections where minor widening is required (e.g., to improve drainage structures), the existing\nright-of-way provides sufficient space. At the Kurday pass, the new realignment will traverse\nunused mountainous land that can be classified as wasteland. Agricultural land is the property\nof the state in Kazakhstan. Accordingly, there is no need to transfer the land title or to budget for", "27\nit the project cost. Overall, no permanent impacts are expected on land and other assets along\nthe  road,  and  no  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  in  terms  of  housing  and  nonhousing\nrelocation are needed.\n108.   A temporary land borrow will be maintained during implementation, but it will be restored\nin accordance with the recommendations and mitigation measures detailed in the SIEE. Borrow\nareas will be defined and clearly located during the finalization of the detailed design. If any\nresettlement effects arise from temporary land borrow or permanent land acquisition (e.g.,\nbecause of changes in project design), all requirements as stated in ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary\nResettlement (1995) and in the Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice (1998)\nwill  be  met.  The  social  impacts  of  the  Project  will  be  monitored  and  evaluated  during\nimplementation and after completion (para. 95).\n3. Impact on Poverty\n109.  The main findings of the 1996 poverty survey in Kazakhstan39 are that (i) a third of the\npopulation (about 5.5 million) lived below a \u201csubsistence minimum\u201d living standard,40 (ii) there\nwas a marked regional variation in the incidence of poverty, with over two thirds of the poor\nliving in the south and east of the country; and (iii) poverty was highly correlated with large\nfamily size and unemployment. The Kazakh portion of the project road is located in the poorer\neastern Zhambul and Almaty regions with populations of 1.0 million and 2.1 million, respectively.\nOf the total national poor in 1996, 42 percent resided in the south, 24 percent in the east, 15\npercent in the west, 14 percent in the center, and 5 percent in the north. This distribution\nreflected  the  lower  resource  endowment,  limited  employment  opportunities,  and  higher\npercentage of poor people living in the rural areas of the south and of part of the east of\nKazakhstan (55 percent against the national average of 45 percent). Poverty was found to be\nhigher in the rural (39 percent) than in the urban areas (30 percent).\n110.     The Kyrgyz Poverty Monitoring Survey carried out by the National Statistical Committee\nin  collaboration  with  the  World  Bank  provided  household  data  for  1996  and  1997.  These\nsurveys indicated that about 50 percent of the population (2.3 million) were classified as poor.41\nAs in Kazakhstan, poverty was higher in the rural areas: more than 70 percent of the poor lived\nin the rural areas.  Poverty was very high in the southern part of the country (in Naryn region 90\npercent of the population was poor). In the PIA, the poverty levels of both Bishkek (with 6\npercent)  and  Chui  region  (27  percent)  were  significantly  lower  than  the  national  average.\nHowever, poverty in the rural areas of Chui region was close to the national rural average (59\npercent of the population in 1996).\n111.   Transport investments play an important role in stimulating economic growth through the\nmarket widening effect and, thus reducing poverty.  The main direct impact of the project road\nwill  be  the  creation  of  employment  opportunities  in  road  construction  and  maintenance  in\nZhambul and Almaty regions, and the rural areas of Chui region. There may be additional\nopportunities in trade and other informal sectors, mainly through organized business practices\nsuch as the establishment of service centers along the road. Since the project focuses on\nrehabilitating the existing road, it is not expected to provide additional access to public services\nsuch as education, health care, and utilities.\n                  \n39 The World Bank, Household Survey on Living Standards, 1997.\n40 The World Bank\u2019s survey considers the Government\u2019s \u201csubsistence minimum\u201d as the poverty line. This figure in\n1996 was T2,861 ($40) per capita per month.\n41 In 1997, the poverty line was Som388 ($23) per capita per month.", "28\nH. Technical Assistance\n112.  The two advisory TAs will help Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic in implementing\nmeasures to improve the efficiency and safety of transport on the Almaty-Bishkek road. The\nKazakh TA will have three phases and the Kyrgyz TA two (see the terms of reference in\nAppendix 15).\n113.      The primary objective of phase I will be to assist the two Governments to implement the\nCBA for regulating and easing the movement of people, goods, and vehicles across the Akzhol-\nChu border in Georgievka, and to formulate longer term strategies for expanded use of the CBA\nat  other  border  crossings  to  foster  regional  economic  cooperation.  Phase  II  will  focus  on\nimproving  coordination  and  management  of  road  safety  in  both  countries,  including  the\nincorporation,  in  cooperation  with  the  project  supervision  consultants,  of  adequate\nenvironmental and social mitigation and safety measures in the maintenance by contract. Phase\nIII will help KAZMOTC streamline its functions and responsibilities, define sector objectives\ntaking  into  account  reforms  implemented  so  far  on  the  basis  of  the  Road  Sector  Policy\nStatement adopted on 31 March 1996, and prepare the three-year national transport investment\nplan.  The advisory support will also address issues concerning transport policy review and\nanalysis, regulations, pricing, and procurement. Phase III will be implemented with the help of a\ntransport policy adviser.\n114.   About  32  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  (Kazakhstan,  22;  the\nKyrgyz Republic, 10) and 30 of domestic (Kazakhstan, 18; the Kyrgyz Republic, 12) will be\nrequired. The same consulting firm will be engaged by ADB for both TAs in accordance with\nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  The work will commence in August 2001, and is\nexpected to be completed in less than one year for Phases I and II in the two countries. The\nservices of the transport policy adviser in Kazakhstan under phase III will be provided on a\nstaggered basis until mid-2004.\n115.    Detailed cost estimates for the two TAs are given in Appendixes 16 and 17. The total\ncost of the Kazakh TA is estimated at $1,080,000 equivalent comprising $634,000 in foreign\nexchange cost and $446,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The Government has requested\nADB to finance $750,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $116,000\nequivalent of the local currency expenditure. The Government will finance the remaining local\ncurrency cost of $330,000 equivalent. The total cost of the Kyrgyz TA is estimated at $515,000\nequivalent comprising $370,000 in foreign exchange cost and $145,000 equivalent in local\ncurrency cost. The Government has requested ADB to finance $440,000, covering the entire\nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $70,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  expenditures.  The\nGovernment will finance the remaining local currency cost of $75,000 equivalent. The TAs will\nbe financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government\nof Japan.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Economic Analysis\n116.   The economic analysis of the rehabilitation of the Almaty-Bishkek road was carried out\nwith a comparison of the with-and without-Project scenarios. The Project involves providing new\nbase courses, resurfacing and other improvements on the entire road, and new alignment in\nparts of the Kurday Pass area. The without Project scenario involves routine and periodic\nmaintenance at current levels to keep the road in its current condition. The economic analysis", "29\ncovers the construction period 2001-2004 plus the subsequent 20 years operation. Assumptions\nunderlying the traffic forecasts for the Project are described in Appendix 18. Appendix 19 gives\nthe economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) calculated for four scenarios: (i) the Kazakh\nportion of the project road including benefits from road rehabilitation but excluding subregional\nbenefits; (ii) the Kyrgyz portion with rehabilitation benefits without subregional benefits; (iii) the\noverall Project and the country components including subregional benefits; and (iv) the overall\nProject including both subregional benefits and regional benefits arising from transit traffic.\n117.   The  main  sources  of  economic  benefits  from  improvement  of  the  project  road  are\nsavings in  (i) VOCs for normal traffic, (ii) VOCs  for generated traffic, and (iii) time because of\nthe  improved  alignment  and  increased  speeds  in  the  Kurday  Pass  area  for  freight  and\npassenger traffic. The VOC savings due to the improved road conditions comprise the largest\ncategory of savings, accounting for 70-80 percent of total benefits. The wider shoulders of the\nproject road and the improved alignment in the Kurday Pass area will significantly improve the\nsafety conditions of the road. Since available data are insufficient to quantify the value of the\nreduced  level  of  vehicle  accidents,  such  benefits  have  not  been  included  in  the  EIRR\ncalculation.\n118.  The improvement in cross-border policies and procedures will result in less time spent at\nthe Akzhol-Chu border crossing and will thus reduce costs, facilitate trade between the two\ncountries, and generate new economic activities. Two categories of such subregional benefits\nwill arise from the Project: (i) time savings, and (ii) new economic activity to meet the increased\ndemand for goods due to lower costs of trade. The improved border control procedures will\nresult in time savings from the removal of (i) control point delays, (ii) border processing delays,\nand (iii) clearance delays. The time savings will reduce the costs of trade. No sufficient data are\navailable to estimate the benefits from the new economic activities; however, such activities are\nexpected to be significant. The reduced cost of trade and new economic activities will increase\nthe volume of trade and the amount of traffic necessary to transport it. The increased trade will\ninvolve products such as fresh produce and other agricultural goods and will generate increased\ntraffic on the project road. The subregional benefits have been distributed approximately evenly\nbetween Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic on the basis of the flow of cargo vehicles through\nthe border crossing.\n119.   A summary of the results of the economic analysis is in Table 3. The EIRR for the overall\nProject, including subregional benefits, is estimated at 27.6 percent. Due to the much smaller\nscale  of  the  Kyrgyz  portion  relative  to  the  Kazakh  portion  and  the  approximately  equal\ndistribution of subregional benefits, the inclusion of subregional benefits has a larger impact in\nthe former case, which has an EIRR of 48.8 percent, versus 25.6 percent for the Kazakh\ncomponent.  If the subregional benefits are excluded, the EIRR for the overall Project decreases\nto 23.8 percent, and the EIRRs for the Kazakh and Kyrgyz components decrease to 23.7\npercent and 25.9 percent, respectively. The above EIRR calculations do not include transit\ntraffic benefits as these do not accrue to either of the project countries. They will accrue to other\ncountries in the region (primarily Russia and Uzbekistan). Inclusion of direct regional benefits in\nthe form of VOC savings increases the EIRR to 28.0 percent. Secondary regional benefits are\ndifficult to quantify, but are expected to further increase the level of project benefits.", "30\nTable 3:  Base Case EIRRs and NPVs\nItem Without Subregional With Subregional Overall With Subregional\nBenefits Benefits and Regional Benefits\nKAZ KGZ Overall KAZ KGZ Overall\nEIRR (%) 23.7 25.9 23.8 25.6 48.8 27.6 28.0\nNPV 68.0 4.5 72.5 81.0 20.6 101.6 105.1\n($ million)\n    EIRR = economic internal rate of return; KAZ = Kazakhstan; KGZ = Kyrgystan; NPV = net present value.\n120.   Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the impact of negative changes on key\nparameters determining the costs and benefits of the Project. The results for the overall Project,\nincluding subregional benefits, indicate that it would take an increase in costs of 170 percent or\na decrease in benefits of 63 percent for the EIRR to decline to the cutoff level of 12 percent. The\nswitching values for the Project excluding subregional benefits are smaller than those for the\nProject including those benefits, but are still high overall. Given that both countries now have\nexperience in implementing ADB-financed road projects, it is not likely that such large increases\nin costs will occur. Similarly, given the somewhat conservative nature of the traffic forecast, it is\nnot likely that such large decreases in benefits will occur.\nB.  Project Risks\n121.    Since the EIRRs remain acceptable even with adverse changes in the cost and benefit\nparameters, the Project is not subject to substantial economic risks. The Russian economic\ncrisis appears to have relatively limited impact on the Project. The only significant impact to date\nhas  been  the  difficulty  experienced  by  the  Governments  in  allocating  adequate  funds  to\nmaintain the Almaty-Bishkek road. The conservative traffic forecast, especially in the short term,\ntakes the impact of the Russian crisis into account. The concern relating to road maintenance\nwill be addressed by implementing road maintenance by contract. The funding terms will be\nadequately  addressed  in  the  maintenance  contract.  With  improvement  in  the  Road  Fund\ncollection and the Governments\u2019 specific commitment to allocate funds for maintenance, the\nfunding constraints are expected to be eased in the future.\n122.   There is a risk that improvement of the cross-border regulations and procedures will not\nmeet expectations because of the delays in implementing the CBA that calls for relaxing and\nstreamlining the procedures to simplify and make them transparent. To guard against this,\nassistance will be provided in the form of equipment and consulting support to introduce revised\nsystems and documentation and to train staff as per the provisions of the CBA to be approved\nand signed by the Governments of Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic.\n123.  Considering the current fiscal deficits in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, particular\nattention needs to be given to avoiding delays in project implementation because of a shortage\nof  counterpart  funds.  The  potential  counterpart  fund  risk  is  mitigated  by  following  ADB\u2019s\nrecommendations  concerning  the  Road  Fund  (para.  23)  for  Kazakhstan  and  with  the\nestablishment of the Road Fund for the Kyrgyz Republic (para. 38). The pressure on the Road\nFund in Kazakhstan will be eased by the end of 2001 when ADB\u2019s ongoing Road Rehabilitation\nProject is expected to be completed.", "31\nC. Social Dimensions\n124.    The  Project  will  have  significant  positive  effects  on  both  national  and  regional\neconomies. The rehabilitation of the Almaty-Bishkek road will facilitate movements of goods and\npeople  during  the  winter  months  by  improving  road  safety  and  road  conditions  in  the\nmountainous area of Kurday Pass. It will also enhance industrial, agricultural, and commercial\nactivities along the road and in the PIA as a whole. Streamlining the cross-border procedures\nwill result in time savings and a more efficient trading corridor for goods and services.\n125.   In terms of job opportunities, the Project will have a significant positive impact during\nconstruction. Based on experience with the ongoing projects in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz\nRepublic, it is be estimated that the Project will generate up to 450 jobs per month in the\nconstruction season for skilled, semiskilled, and unskilled workers. Of these, about 300 jobs will\nbe for local workers. Indirect employment associated with the Project through the supply of\nother goods and services (e.g., service stations, canteens, and kiosks) will be considerable as\nwell. After completion of the rehabilitation, road maintenance by contract will generate local\nemployment. The maintenance crew will comprise about 130 workers on Kazakh and 30 on\nKyrgyz roads.\n126.   With respect to poverty reduction, the location of the Project and the high correlation\nbetween poverty and unemployment in the PIA ensure that the additional job opportunities\ncreated  during  construction  and  maintenance  of  the  project  road  will  benefit  the  poor.42\nMoreover,  the  living  standard  household  surveys  conducted  in  1996  and  1997  by  the\nGovernments and the World Bank indicate that income from informal activities, especially trade,\nrepresents a large portion of the household budget of the poor and vulnerable groups in the PIA.\nThe business opportunities along the project road will supplement household incomes.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n127.  The Governments have given the following assurances, in addition to the standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal document:\n  (i) Project implementation.

page 1\nTHE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\u2019S INITIATIVES IN SUPPORT OF\nREGIONAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION IN CENTRAL ASIA\nA. Background\n1.  Strengthening regional economic cooperation is especially important for realizing the\ndevelopment aspirations of the Central Asian Republics (CARs). Central Asia is an area with\ndeeply rooted traditions of economic interaction. Situated along the historic Silk Road, the\npeople living in this region have engaged in extensive commerce and trade from as early as\n3000 BC. In the 20th century, geopolitical factors reduced the exchange of goods and services in\nthe region. Expansion of the economic linkages again became possible with the collapse of the\nformer Soviet Union (FSU) and the opening of trade in the early 1990s by the People\u2019s Republic\nof China (PRC).\n2.  The  CARs  face  daunting  constraints  to  economic  development  as  they  undergo  a\ndifficult period of transition from a command economy to one that relies on market institutions.\nThey constitute a relatively large geographic area that is distant and, until recently, isolated from\nthe modern market economies of Western Europe and Asia. The breakup of the FSU left these\ncountries  with  little  demand  for  their  products,  few  sources  for  industrial  inputs  and\nmanufactured goods, and inadequate administrative and political frameworks for functioning in\nthe modern world. Furthermore, they are sparsely populated and have very low per capita\nincomes, which means that internal markets for domestically produced goods and services are\nlimited. Their economic growth depends on developing new trading partners in place of their\nformer dependence on a centralized structure that no longer exists.\n3.  The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region\u2014the far-western territory of the PRC\u2014shares\nborders, economic interests, and cultural ties with the CARs. Even more important than these\nethnic ties, however, is the potential resource and market complementarity among the CARs\nand Xinjiang, PRC.\nB. Regional Economic Cooperation\n4.   Since early 1997, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been providing technical\nassistance (TA) to encourage regional economic cooperation among its developing member\ncountries in Central Asia\u2013Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan\u2013and the PRC,\nfocusing on the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Activities under the technical assistance\nconcentrated on identifying infrastructure needs and policy issues impeding cross-border trade\nand traffic, specifically in the areas of energy, trade, and transportation.1 The findings and\nrecommendations of the study were reviewed and validated in a series of workshops conducted\nin 1998 at ADB headquarters and in the region.2 The first workshop tackled the challenges and\nopportunities in transportation and, the second, in energy. The third and fourth workshops\ncovered  cross-border  trade  cooperation  between  Kazakhstan  and  the  PRC,  and  the  fifth\nworkshop deliberated on Kazakhstan-Kyrgyz Republic trade cooperation.\n5.  The TA (Phase II) commenced in 1999 and will support ADB\u2019s continuing policy dialogue\nin the context of regional cooperation.3 The work involves the preliminary analysis of previously\n                                                    \n1  TA 5707-REG: Regional Economic Cooperation in Central Asia, for $1.15 million, approved on 8 November 1996.\n2  TA 5760-REG: Workshops on Economic Cooperation in Central Asia, for $344,000, approved on 14 November\n1997.\n3  TA 5818-REG: Regional Economic Cooperation in Central Asia, Phase II, for $1.35 million, approved on 11\nDecember 1998.", "38\nAppendix 2, page 2\nidentified high-priority infrastructure investments such as the rehabilitation and improvement of\nthe interconnected power grid of Central Asia and the development of various intercountry\ntransport corridors. Phase II furthermore offers the opportunity to widen the initiative to promote\neconomic cooperation in Central Asia with the recent membership of Tajikistan in ADB.\nC.  Cooperation in the Transport Sector\n6.  The CARs are attaching very high priority to cooperation in the transport sector because\nof the poor state of transport infrastructure to facilitate regional economic cooperation. The main\nthrusts  of  the  cooperation  are  (i)  developing  the  east-west  corridor  along  the  Silk  Road\nconnecting  the  Far  East  with  Europe,  and  the  north-south  corridor  linking  the  Indian\nsubcontinent  with  Russia;  (ii)  developing  adequate  transport  infrastructure  links  to  permit\nexploitation of the rich natural resources of Central Asia; (iii) linking major centers of economic\nactivity, population, and tourist destination; and (iv) helping develop remote and low-income\nareas.\n7.  In addition to helping the CARs to improve the road infrastructure in line with the above\npriority, ADB has assisted them in undertaking sector reforms that are well coordinated, and\ndeveloping standards and specifications that are responsive to the needs of market-oriented\neconomies to permit the introduction of performance-based specifications and encourage the\ntransfer of productivity-enhancing technologies. The bilingual (Russian/English) Public Motor\nRoads: Design Standards and Regulations and Public Motor Roads: Construction Specifications\nwere prepared under ADB\u2019s TA4 for Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, and Uzbekistan.\nThe standards are expected to make important contributions to the introduction of road design\nbased on economy and efficiency, and creation of an opportunity for the private sector to\nparticipate in the road sector. This principle is not followed in the FSU standards because such\nstandards were developed for operations on a force account basis aimed at efficient utilization\nof State-owned resources (input-based), and had the force of law.\n8.   The development of technical standards has been difficult because of their bearing on\nthe  education  system.    Therefore,  the  integration  of  the  FSU  and  western  standards  was\ntechnically  difficult.  Considering  the  difficulties  in  developing  such  standards,  and  to  carry\nthrough  the  benefits  of  the  TA  to  other  countries  in  the  region,  the  standards  have  been\ndistributed to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.\n9.   The Road Safety Guidelines for the Asian and Pacific Region, which was developed\nunder ADB\u2019s regional TA5 aims to provide a source of reference and guidelines and introduce a\nconcept of coordinated road safety initiatives. Road safety is a multidimensional social problem\ninvolving many sectors: education, health, police, and transport as well as the private sector\ninvolved in insurance, fuel supply, and bus and freight transport operations. The activities have\nto be complementary and coordinated among the sectors and countries of the region so that\nroad safety measures can be optimized to avoid loss of resources on account of vehicle\ndamage, medical treatment, police and administration costs, and damage to road facilities. The\nRoad Safety Guidelines introduces such an approach to the CARs for dealing with the road\nsafety problems.\n                                                    \n4  TA  5733-REG: A Review of Road Design and Construction Standards, for $600,000, approved on 3 April 1997.\n5  TA  5620-REG: Regional Initiatives in Road Safety, for $600,000, approved on 4 January 1995.", "39\n  Appendix 3\nTRANSPORT DEMAND\n(KAZAKHSTAN)\nY e a r\nTransport Mode 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999\nA.

Introduction\n1. This summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) concerns the proposed Almaty-\nBishkek Regional Road Rehabilitation Project in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. The\ninitial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared under TA 2632-KAZ and Loan 1444-KGZ\nin  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  \u2018s  (ADB\u2019s)  Environmental Assessment\nRequirements and Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. The SIEE\npresents the data, findings, and recommendations of the IEE as well as the results of ADB\u2019s\ninvestigations during project processing.\n2. The IEE was prepared in a number of steps. First, secondary data and reports on\nrelevant  previous  projects  were  analyzed.  In  addition,  discussions  were  held  with\nrepresentatives of the local environment authorities and of the road design institutes responsible\nfor the detailed engineering design. Second, the data collected for the Project (e.g. geological,\nsocial, and environmental baseline data) were reviewed. Third, field investigations assessed the\npresent condition of the environment along the project road. Fourth, possible environmental\nimpacts were estimated, and mitigating measures were selected and planned to minimize the\nadverse effects expected during and after construction.\nB.  Description of the Project\n3. The  Project  entails  the  rehabilitation  of  the  Almaty-Bishkek  road.  The  project  road\npasses  through  varied  terrain,  valleys,  high  mountains  and  mountain  passes,  agricultural\n(farmland  and  grazing  grounds)  and  nonagricultural  lands  and  areas  of  low  and  medium\npopulation density.\n4. Road rehabilitation will be carried out on the existing alignment, except at two sections\n(total length of 12 kilometers [km]) in the mountainous areas of Kurday Pass in Kazakhstan.\nRehabilitation will include minor widening, removal and replacement of some layers of road\nstructure, and improvement of drainage systems. The land that will be affected by the needed\nroad realignment is currently not used due to its mountainous character and can be classified as\nwasteland.  In  the  sections  where  some  widening  will  occur  (e.g.,  to  improve  drainage\nstructures), the existing road right-of-way provides sufficient space for the needed improvement,\nand  no  permanent  impacts  are  expected  on  land  and  other  assets  along  the  road.  No\nresettlement effects in terms of both housing and nonhousing relocation are expected.\n5. The borrow areas and quarries, construction and labor camps, road haulage, and road\ndiversions will have some temporary impacts during project construction. Although no severe\nand  permanent  environmental  impacts  are  expected  as  a  result  of  the  road  rehabilitation,\nattention must be given to good practice during the different stages of project planning, design,\nand implementation to prevent any adverse impacts.\nC.  Description of the Environment\n1.  Physical and Agricultural Resources\n6. The Kazakh section of the project road is situated in the two regions of Almaty and\nZhambul. Kurday Mountain is situated in the latter. This is part of the Alatou mountain, which\nextends as a ridge with decreasing elevation from east to west near the border between", "55\nAppendix 13, page 2\nKazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, where the Project road crosses Kurday mountain pass.\nThis acts as a major regional watershed.\n7. The  perennial  and  nonperennial  streams  flowing  south  of  the  mountain  pass  have\nproduced five types of landform: (i) rugged mountain with thin soil cover and high rate of water\nloss by runoff; (ii) alluvial fans at the foot of the mountain formed of unsorted grain size\nmaterials, leading to rapid loss of water; (iii) amphitheater-shaped undulating river basins; (iv)\nflat plains along the median river made of materials of homogenous size, which lead to impeded\ndrainage; and (v) terraces formed of extremely fine-grained silt, which act as local watersheds.\nThe project road in the southern part of the Kazakhstan section traverses all these five types.\n8. Given  the  above  physical  characteristics,  special  attention  should  be  paid  to  the\nconstruction of a large number of cross drainage structures and to the protection of the road\nfrom  erosion  from  the  parallel  flowing  streams  especially  in  its  mountainous  areas.  The\nsustained erosion is also due to the very ancient age of the rock geology. Major climatic\nchanges take place especially during the winter season. A long winter period is characterized by\nvery rigid temperatures manifested by freezing and thawing of surface water and groundwater,\nspring floods, snow, and dust and hail storms. The remaining part- the less mountainous area-\nof the environment along the project road is cultivated, and wheat and grain are grown with\nlimited irrigation. The alluvial fans support orchards and vegetable fields in Almaty region. Many\nflat, nonirrigated areas are used for animal grazing and fodder.\n9. The  Kyrgyz  section  of  the  road  is  located  entirely  in  the  northern  half  of  the\nadministrative district of Alamedin within Chui region. The area surrounding the road is mainly\nflat and intensively cultivated. Grain, sugar beet, potatoes, vegetables, and milk represent the\nmain agricultural products cultivated.  The climate is continental, but quite variable due to the\ndifferences in altitude. Precipitation varies considerably, being highest in the mountains and\nlowest in the valleys. It rains mainly during the cold season, which means that on the mountains\nthe major part of the precipitation is snow. East of the project road many mineral resources and\nthermal springs can be found. In particular, around Lake Issyk-Kul, medicinal mud and other\nnatural resources attract many tourists especially during summer. Erosion is among the most\nsignificant environmental problems in the country. It represents a threat to the physical and\nbiological environment, affecting 25 percent of the total land available for farming and grazing.\n10. There are no designated wetlands, forests, nature conservation areas, and places of\narchaeological importance within the study area. Trees are planted along the road in many\nsections and provide useful protection against embankment erosion as well as against noise\nand dust for the settlements traversed by the project road.\n2.  Socioeconomic Environment\n11. The project road will connect 37 settlements on the Kazakhstan road corridor. Of these,\nonly four are crossed by the road (i.e., Samsy, Targap, Alga, and Georgievka). The primary\nsector provides employment in the settlements of Samsy, Targap and Alga, while in Almaty City,\nKaskelen (2.3 km from the project road), and Georgievka, the industrial and service sectors are\nalso developed. The Kazakhstan portion of the project influence area (PIA) has a population of\nabout 3.7 million people (1998). This area contributed to approximately 25 percent of the total\nvalue added produced in the country in 1997.\n \n12. In the Kyrgyz Republic, the project road traverses Chui region and the Alamedin district\n(110,000 people in 1998). The 11 settlements found along the road have a total population of", "56\nAppendix 13, page 3\n80,000. Chui region had a population of approximately 765,000 people in 1998. In that year, the\nregion produced 36 percent of the industrial activity of the country, 31 percent of the national\nagricultural  production  (i.e.,  wheat,  barley,  dairy  products,  fruits,  and  vegetables),  and  57\npercent  of  the  exports  (i.e.,  agricultural,  agroprocessing,  construction,  and  light  industry\nproducts).\nD.

To determine the depth of environmental study required for the Project, screening used\nthe checklist of ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Project. Using such\ncriteria as type, sensitivity of the environment, and magnitude of impact, a scale was designed\nto identify the potentially significant adverse impacts. The impacts were also separated into\ntemporary  and  permanent.  Mitigation  measures  were  identified  and  recommended  when\nadverse  environmental  impacts  were  considered  unavoidable.  Distinction  was  also  made\nbetween the impacts associated with project construction and those with project operation.\n14. The results of the environmental examination show no significant potential adverse\nimpacts from the Project. However, several cost-effective practices, especially during project\nconstruction, can reduce and/or avoid small-scale impacts due to road rehabilitation.\n1.  Environmental Problems due to Project Location\n15. The road will be rehabilitated along the existing alignment with the exception of two\nsections (total length of 12 km) in the mountainous area of Kurday Pass. The area to be\naffected  by  the  realignment  of  the  project  road  is  currently  wasteland:  it  is  not  used  for\nresidence, cultivation, or other activities. The Project is not expected to cause resettlement of\nhouses and/or any negative impact on land and other assets. In addition, no negative impacts\non women or vulnerable groups are foreseen. Overall, the population living along the road is\nexpected to benefit from the road rehabilitation in the medium and long term through additional\njob opportunities created in the construction phase and the expected economic growth induced\nby a more efficient national and international transport system.\n2.  Environmental Problems Related to Design\n16. Many of the environmental problems associated with road rehabilitation, maintenance,\nand traffic will be taken care of starting from the engineering design stage. An engineer trained\nin environmental engineering will be responsible for considering cost-effective practices to avoid\nadverse environmental impacts in the detailed design and will be in charge of the environmental\nquality of the design. Measures related to traffic safety issues, soil erosion, drainage structures,\nwater flows and systems, location and restoration of quarries and borrow areas, establishment\nof construction camps, road haulage and diversions, and maintenance of approach roads will be\nincluded in the design.\n3.  Environmental Problems Associated with the Construction Stage\n17. The potential impacts during project construction are grouped by environmental/social\ncomponent.\na. Land Resources and Soil Erosion. Land borrow will be necessary for storage\nof  construction  materials,  establishment  of  construction  camps,  and  road\ndiversion. Along the road the embankments provide some space in most areas", "57\nAppendix 13, page 4\nfor both purposes. However, where more land is required the contractor will\nselect wasteland areas to reduce any negative impacts on the nearby residential\nareas and assets. To avoid permanent impacts, the land temporarily occupied\nwill be restored as soon as construction in that section is completed, and the\nsurface will be rehabilitated to at least its original state to allow the uses, if any,\npreviously  made  of  it.  The  same  criteria,  i.e.  minimize  disruption  to  the\nresidential,  farmland,  industrial  areas,  and  restoration  through  backfilling,\nlandscaping, regeneration of vegetation, and planting trees, will be applied to\nquarries,  borrow  areas,  and  asphalt  and  crushing  plants.  Several  mitigation\nmeasures  will  be  employed  to  prevent  any  aggravation,  especially  at  the\nconstruction  stage,  in  the  soil  erosion-prone  areas.  These  will  include\n(i) preparing,  re-vegetating,  and  reforesting  exposed  areas  (slopes)  upon\ncompletion of the earthworks; (ii) building ditches and culverts in appropriate\nlocations; and (iii) building retaining walls to prevent landslides where slopes are\nvery steep. These measures will be monitored weekly as part of the monitoring\nplan.\nb. Water  Resources:  Discharges  of  sewage  and  other  waste  fluids  from\nconstruction camps and asphalt and crushing plants, and of other construction\nmaterials will need to be prevented. To mitigate these potential impacts, all labor\ncamps will be equipped with appropriate sanitation facilities for liquid and solid\nwastes.  Standard  precautions  will  also  be  taken  in  the  use  and  storage  of\nhazardous  materials,  including  storage  away  from  waterways,  oil  separation\nfacilities,  and  other  measures  to  avoid  accidental  spills.  Dumping  of  spoils\ndirectly  in  the  waterways  and  drainage  system  will  not  be  permitted.  The\ndrainage system will need as well to be maintained to avoid pollution spillage,\nespecially during thunderstorms and winter periods. The contractor will ensure\nthe  implementation  of  appropriate  waste  disposal  and  wastewater  treatment\nmeasures during construction. As part of the monitoring plan, the contractor will\ncontrol  daily  solid  waste  disposal,  spillage  of  fluids,  and  drainage  structures\nduring construction. These last, together with water courses and flows, will be\nfully restored after rehabilitation of the relevant road sections and monitored after\nproject completion.\nc. Biological Resources: Many sections of the road are delimited by trees. To\navoid permanent impacts, the contractor should reduce any effects on the trees.\nWhere the trees are affected, proper restoration and vegetation are required.\nReplanting of trees will be monitored weekly until the vegetation grows steadily;\nspecial attention will be given to erosion-prone areas. Grazing grounds along the\nroad  are  common  and  any  disturbance  to  animals  and  pastures  should  be\navoided.\nd. Air Quality and Noise: Noise and pollution associated with road rehabilitation\nworks should be minimized by avoiding movement of construction equipment in\nresidential areas. Dust and emissions from plant and equipment will also be\nminimized and closely monitored through dust control devices and water sprays.  \ne. Approach Roads: Secondary roads in the surroundings of the project road will\nbe  used  for  haulage  of  construction  materials  and  for  traffic  diverted  during\nconstruction. To mitigate the potential negative impacts due to excess traffic and\noverloading,  the  contractor  in  collaboration  with  the  EA  will  ensure  that  the", "58\nAppendix 13, page 5\napproach roads receive appropriate maintenance and their conditions monitored\non a weekly basis.\nf. Health Prevention: The influx of a large number of workers involved in the\nrehabilitation works could increase the spread of communicable and infectious\ndiseases in the project area. Adequate health training on the prevention of these\ndiseases will be provided as part of the safety training compulsory for the entire\nworkforce.\n18. All  measures,  practices,  and  activities  necessary  to  prevent  the  adverse\nenvironmental impacts will be carefully detailed and specified in the contract documents. Heavy\npenalties  will  also  be  included  as  a  deterrent.  Furthermore,  the  engineer  in  charge  of\nenvironmental  monitoring  will  be  assigned  specific  responsibilities  and  ensure  that  the\nrequirements indicated in the preceding paras. for each environmental component are met in a\ntimely manner.\n4.  Environmental Problems During Project Operations\n19. After  project  completion,  no  significant  impacts  are  expected  unless  the  mitigation\nmeasures indicated during the construction phase is not undertaken as planned and properly\nmonitored. However, the increased traffic, vehicle speed, noise, pollution, and effects on road\nsafety will need to be taken into account starting from project design so as to minimize their\nmagnitude. The rehabilitated road will be maintained with the help of contractors. The contracts\nwill include conditions and measures that will enhance environmental sustainability.\nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n20. In Kazakhstan, environmental monitoring, coordination, and implementation of policies\nand legislation are carried out by the Ministry of Ecology and Bioresources (MEB) at the national\nlevel and with the help of its Departments of Ecology and Bioresources (DEBs) at the regional\nlevel. The IEE indicated that the institutional setup existing in the country for environmental\nmonitoring  and  reporting  is  adequate.  DEBs  closely  monitor  the  environmental  impacts  at\ndifferent stages of the implementation of projects. The DEBs of Almaty and Zhambul regions will\nbe  closely  associated  with  the  implementation  of  the  Project.  In  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  the\nMinistry  of  Environmental  Protection  (MEP)  is  responsible  for  environmental  policy  and\nregulations, and monitoring. Since Chui region, where the Project road is located, is on the\nBishkek township boundary, the MEP will directly monitor the environmental impacts during\nimplementation and operation of the Kyrgyz portion of the project road.\n21. Prior to the formal acceptance of the construction works, a full examination of the\ncontractors\u2019 compliance with the specifications relating to environmental provisions should be\nundertaken.  The  examination  will  include  verification  of  the  required  clean-up  activities,\nrestoration of all temporary works sites, landscaping, planting, and reinstatement of drainage\nstructures.\n22. After project completion, the government maintenance supervisors along with region\nenvironment authorities will be in charge of environmental monitoring of the project area at\nregular intervals. The maintenance contractors will be responsible for implementing measures\nrelating  to  social,  environmental  and  road  safety  aspects,  for  which  proper  maintenance\ncontracts with terms and conditions and manuals will be prepared by the project supervision\nconsultants.", "59\nAppendix 13, page 6\nF.  Findings and Recommendations\n23. The IEE clearly indicates that the majority of the impacts resulting from the rehabilitation\nof the project road are not expected to be significant provided that the recommendations set out\nbelow are complied with. Accordingly, there is no need to prepare a full environmental impact\nassessment for this Project.\n24. The following recommendations result from the IEE:\n(i)  The design of the rehabilitated road will be followed and all major changes that\noccur should be considered in terms of the associated potential environmental\nimpacts.\n(ii)  The designs will make full provision for the incorporation of the various mitigation\nmeasures indicated in paras. 17-19.\n(iii)  Contract documents will include, but will not be limited to, all the appropriate\nclauses to cover the environmental protection requirements listed in para. 24.\n(iv)  Through loan covenants, provision will be made for adequate maintenance for\nthe project road and the approach roads.\n(v)  Close monitoring of the critical activities that have environmental impacts during\nproject construction and operation should be undertaken.\nG.  Conclusions\n25. It is concluded that the potential negative environmental impacts of rehabilitating the\nAlmaty-Bishkek road can be mitigated to insignificant levels, and the Executing Agencies will\nensure that the recommended mitigating measures contained in the summary IEE and sound\nengineering  design  and  practice  will  be  undertaken  to  minimize  the  impacts.  A  full-scale\nenvironmental assessment is not required.", "60\nAppendix 14, page 1\nSUMMARY SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nA.  Introduction\n1. This summary social impact assessment (SSIA) concerns the proposed Almaty-Bishkek\nRegional Road Rehabilitation Project in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. The initial social\nassessment (ISA) was prepared under TA 2632-KAZ and Loan 1444-KGZ. The SSIA reflects\nthe results of the ISA; additional secondary data collected for the project influence area (PIA);\ndiscussions with representatives of both central and local governments and non-government\nagencies  in  charge  of  social  and  transport  sectors,  international  organizations,  transport\nassociations, and with the residents of the project area during interviews and public meetings.\nOn  the  basis  of  the  information  gathered,  the  social  impacts  related  to  the  Project  were\nidentified. In addition, mitigation measures for adverse effects during project construction and\noperation were recommended.\nB.  Economic Activities in the Project Influence Area\n2. The PIA consists of Almaty City, and the two regions of Almaty and Zhambul in the\nKazakhstan portion of the road, and of Chui region (including Bishkek City) in the Kyrgyz\nsection. The total population in the PIA is about 4.5 million (1998), of whom approximately 3.7\nmillion are in Kazakhstan and 800,000 are in the Kyrgyz territory. Excluding Bishkek and Almaty\nCity, up to 70 percent of the population in the PIA is rural. On the Kazakhstan road corridor are\n37 settlements, but only 4 are crossed by the road (Samsy, Targap, Alga, and Georgievka). The\nproject road in the Kyrgyz Republic traverses the northern half of the Alamedin district (110,000\npeople in 1998) within Chui region, and serves 11 settlements of various dimensions (80,000\npeople).\n3. The  primary  sector  (e.g.,  cattle,  poultry,  milk,  eggs,  grains,  fruits,  and  vegetables)\nprovides employment in the settlements of Samsy, Targap, and Alga; in Almaty City, Almaty\nregion, and Georgievka, the industrial and service sectors (e.g., mining, agroprocessing, textile\nand mechanic industries) are also developed. This area contributed to approximately 25 percent\nof the total value added produced in the Republic of Kazakhstan in 1997. In particular, Almaty\nCity contributed more than 16 percent of it, and Almaty and Zhambul regions around 6 and 3\npercent, respectively. \n4. In  1998,  Chui  region  produced  36  percent  of  the  industrial  (e.g.,  nonferrous  metal\nproducts, manufactured goods, and construction materials) and 31 percent of the agricultural\nproducts (e.g., wheat, sugar beet, barley, dairy products, fruits, and vegetables) in the Kyrgyz\nRepublic. In the same year, 57 percent of the country\u2019s total exports came from Chui region\n(e.g., cement, granite, marble).\nC.  Living Conditions in the Project Influence Area\n5. With  respect  to  the  average  income  per  capita  per  month  in  the  PIA,  Almaty  and\nZhambul regions had the lowest levels across all regions in Kazakhstan (about T1,750 or less\nthan $25), while the average income recorded for Almaty City (T5,369 or $71) was significantly\nhigher than the national average (T2,849 or $38) in 1997. In the Kyrgyz Republic, the average\nincome per capita for Chui region was Som629 ($36) per month in 1997, which is considerably", "61\nAppendix 14, page 2\nhigher than the national monthly average Som374 ($21), and only slightly lower than the value\nrecorded for Bishkek (Som684 or $39).1\n6.  The data in Table A14.1 provide information on living standards in the PIA\nTable A14.1: Indicators of Living Standards in the PIA (1998 data)\nItem Kazakhstan Almaty Almaty Zhambul Kyrgyz Bishkek Chui\nCity Region Region Republic Region\nAverage monthly 2,849 5,369 1,628 1,875 374 684 629\n(money) income p.c.

In Kazakhstan, Russians represented the first ethnic group by order of magnitude in\nAlmaty City and the second in the two regions of the PIA in 1998. In Almaty and Zhambul\nregions, Kazakhs are the largest ethnic group, followed by Russians, Ukrainians, Tatars, and\nGermans. In the Kyrgyz Republic in 1998, Kyrgyz and Russian nationals represented 41 and 35\npercent of the population in Chui region, and 62 and 15 percent of the national population,\nrespectively.\n8. The official unemployment rates in Table A14.1 refer only to the percentage of the\neconomically active population registered with the state employment service, and hence eligible\nfor the unemployment subsidy. In late 1996, the extent of \u201creal\u201d unemployment in the Kyrgyz\nRepublic, as measured by a World Bank survey of 2,000 households, was around 13 percent,\nand varied from 18 to 21.4 percent between the rural and urban areas. Disaggregated by\ngender, the unemployment rate was 14 percent for men and around 12 percent for women. The\nhousehold survey also indicated that out of the sampled unemployed population, around 72\npercent had been unemployed for more than 12 months. In Kazakhstan, a survey by the\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific of 10 settlements in Almaty region\nrecorded an unemployment rate of 15 percent in 1998. The decline in employment recorded\n                  \n1  The income data for the Kyrgyz Republic are the results of a household survey carried out for 2,010 families in\nautumn 1997 as part of the poverty monitoring program.", "62\nAppendix 14, page 3\nbetween 1985 and 1995 in Almaty City (28 percent), Almaty region (36 percent), and Zhambul\n(28 percent) was higher than the one experienced in the Republic as a whole (26 percent).\n9. Traveling along the project road shows how the crisis after independence has strongly\ntouched  the  PIA.  Many  of  the  industrial  and  agroprocessing  plants  along  the  road  look\nabandoned and unemployment remains the main issue of concern in the regions traversed by\nthe Project. Surveys in the PIA indicated that, in 1997, up to 50 percent of the total expenditure\nper household was on food, about 14 percent on services, and approximately 30 percent on\nnonfood products. Informal sector activities like kiosks, bars, restaurants, small trading activities,\nand repair shops are numerous along the project road, but the business is far from enough to\nallow for the necessary household income in most cases.\nD.  Project Beneficiaries and Project Impacts\n10. Given the main sectors of activity in the PIA and the living conditions of the population,\nthe rehabilitation of the project road is expected to have significant positive effects on both the\nnational and regional economies. The rehabilitation of the road will improve the movement of\ngoods and people during the winter months by improving road safety and road conditions in the\nmountainous area of Kurday Pass. Currently, drivers, including professional truck drivers and\ntransport operators, reduce substantially the number of trips from Almaty to Bishkek during\nwinter (up to 4 months) because of the poor and dangerous road conditions in the Kurday area.\nThe rehabilitation of the road will reduce trading and transportation difficulties experienced\nduring the winter season, and enhance these activities as well as the industrial, agricultural, and\ncommercial businesses located along the road and in the PIA as a whole.\n11. Apart  from  the  rehabilitation  of  the  road,  the  Project  aims  to  improve  the  customs\nprocedures at the (Georgievka) border between the two republics. At present, transporting\ncargoes across the borders can take from a minimum of five hours to a maximum of two days\nbecause of customs clearance and related procedures. The streamlining of customs procedures\nwithin each country and between the two republics, is expected to reduce substantially the\nwaiting time at the borders for traded goods and to induce a more efficient trading corridor for\npeople, goods, and services.\n12. In terms of job opportunities, the Project will have a very significant positive impact\nespecially during construction. In the Kyrgyz Republic, the contractor will be local, therefore, an\nincrease in job opportunities for local skilled and unskilled workers is expected. Since in both\ncountries there is no shortage of highly skilled and qualified workers among the unemployed\npopulation,  it  is  envisaged  that  unemployment  in  the  area  will  be  reduced  during  project\nconstruction. From the data on the ongoing Road Rehabilitation Project in Kazakhstan, it is\nestimated that the project road will entail up to 800 jobs per month for skilled, semiskilled and\nunskilled workers in the construction season. Indirect employment associated with the Project\nby way of provision of supply of goods and services (e.g., service stations, canteens, kiosks,\nand bars) will also play a considerable role.\n13.

Beneficiary Needs and Demands\n14. Public meetings and interviews in the PIA explaining the features of the Project revealed\nthe people\u2019s concerns and expectations.2 These can be summarized as follows:\n(i)  expectations to find employment in construction and construction-related jobs\n(e.g., drivers, electricians, welder, security, cooks, cleaners, etc.);\n(ii)  expectations to see an increase in the demand for construction materials and\nservices;\n(iii)  concern about the safety of the villagers, especially in those settlements crossed\nby the road;\n(iv)  expectations that the project design includes road signs to indicate pedestrian\ncrossings and that traffic speed is closely monitored in built-up areas;\n(v)  concern about the restoration and improvement of the existing drainage system;\n(vi)  concern for the trees along the road, and expectation that more trees will be\nplanted to reduce noise and the effect of car emissions;\n(vii)  expectation to benefit from a faster and cheaper access to Almaty, Bishkek, and\nother markets in the PIA; and\n(viii)  concern about the maintenance of the road after rehabilitation.\n15.  Meetings with the drivers\u2019 union association and with the council of transport operators in\nboth countries indicated that safety was their main concern during the winter months and that\naccidents were a major cost for their activities. The need for more organized service stations\nalong the road and dissatisfaction with customs procedures and waiting time at the Georgievka\nborder were also expressed.\nF. Gender Issues\n16. Traditionally, women are not involved in unskilled/manual construction jobs in the PIA.\nHowever, representatives of gender bureaus in both countries pointed out that women form a\nlarge part of the skilled unemployed population (e.g., engineers and surveyors) and could avail\nof job opportunities arising in these technical fields.3 Furthermore, surveys carried out by these\noffices in Almaty and Chui regions show that up to 40 percent of the surveyed women are active\nin  trading  activities  and  could  benefit  from  the  increased  traffic  and  related  business\nopportunities along the project road.\n                  \n2  In Kazakhstan, these meetings included public forums facilitated by the governors or deputy governors of Almaty\nCity, Kaskelen, and Uzunagach; and unofficial meetings and interviews in Samsy and Targap.  In the Kyrgyz\nRepublic, meetings were held with the governor of Chui region and the deputy governor of Alamedin district.\n3  In Kazakhstan, consultations were held with the Association of Business Women. In the Kyrgyz Republic,\ndiscussions took place with the Director of the UNDP-funded Gender Bureau.", "65\nAppendix 14, page 6\nG. Potential Adverse Impacts\n17. No  resettlement  effects  in  terms  of  both  housing  and  nonhousing  relocation  are\nexpected. The road will be rehabilitated along its current alignment with the exception of two\nsections (for an approximate total length of 12 km) in the mountainous area of Kurday Pass in\nKazakhstan. It will maintain its current number of lanes, and will be only marginally widened in\nsome areas. Where road realignment is required, the land to be affected is currently not used\ndue to the altitude and can be classified as wasteland. In the sections where some widening will\noccur (e.g., to improve drainage structures), the existing shoulders provide sufficient space for\nthe needed improvement. No permanent impacts are expected on land and other assets along\nthe road.\n18. As  highlighted  in  Table  A14.2,  the  road  rehabilitation  activities  during  project\nconstruction will have some temporary adverse impacts associated with road diversion, noise,\ndust, disruption of drainage systems, borrow areas and quarries, and the establishment of labor\ncamps. Moreover, the pressure on the existing health facilities in the PIA is expected to increase\ndue to the influx of construction workers and the associated greater risk of diseases (e.g.,\ncommunicable diseases) and health hazards.\n19. Speed limits along the road will not be changed. Hence, the residents of the project area\nwill not suffer from increased traffic speed. However, as indicated by the persons interviewed,\nthe safety of the villagers and animals crossing the road is a concern, especially in settlements\nalong the road.\nH.  Mitigation Measures and Monitoring\n20. Although no severe and/or permanent social impacts are expected as a result of the\nroad rehabilitation, attention must be given to good practice during the different stages of project\nplanning, design, and implementation to prevent any adverse impacts. The mitigation measures\nrecommended in the summary initial environmental examination should be implemented and\naccurately monitored in all stages of project construction. Moreover, road safety should be\nensured through fencing and marked pedestrian crossings in the residential areas along the\nroad.\n21. Since the influx of workers involved in the rehabilitation works could increase the spread\nof communicable and infectious diseases in the PIA, it is recommended that the EAs assist the\ncontractors in distributing information materials and providing basic training in the prevention of\nthese diseases as part of the safety training compulsory for the entire workforce.", "66\nAppendix 15, page 1\nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR\nIMPROVEMENT OF THE ROAD SECTOR EFFICIENCY\nA. Background\n1.  The  Governments  of  Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  are  committed  to\nimplementing market-based reforms for the road transport sector, which need to be looked into\nin  terms  of  (i) developing  an  efficient  policy  and  regulatory  framework;  (ii)\ncorporatizing/commercializing  and,  where  appropriate,  privatizing  transport  operations  and\nentities; (iii) restructuring of Government organizations so that they can respond efficiently to\nmarket demands; (iv) creating in the transport sector an environment that encourages private\nsector  participation;  (v)  promoting  competition  in  the  provision  and  operation  of  transport\nfacilities and services; (vi) increasing funding by improving tax and duties collection, enhancing\ncost recovery, and removing subsidy-induced distortions in the pricing of transport services;\n(vii) rehabilitating and improving maintenance operations and safety standards of infrastructure\nfacilities; (viii) developing human resources; and (ix) protecting the environment by improving\nenvironmental standards.\n2.  In Kazakhstan, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has so far focused on adopting the\nRoad Sector Policy Statement (RSPS) and undertaking measures in line with RSPS, including\nforming a Committee for Transport Sector Legal Reforms to update the existing Road Act and\nRoad Transport Act, and establishing a National Transport Advisory Committee (NTAC).\n3.  The  restructuring  and  streamlining  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  road  sector  have  been\nongoing; as a result, the Directorate General for Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Bishkek-Osh\nRoad  (DGRMBOR) was established.  Under the Automobile Road Act enacted on 2 June 1998,\nthe responsibility for the road sector is streamlined by merging all road activities within the\nKyrgyz Ministry of Transport and Communications (KGZMOTC). The road financing is expected\nto improve through the implementation of the Road Fund Act enacted by the Government on 1\nJune 1998 introducing, to a certain extent, the user-pay principle in road financing.\n4.  Considering the progress in both countries, and keeping in view the demands of the\nmarket  and  the  roles  the  Governments  and  the  private  sectors  are  expected  to  play  in\neconomies in transition, the road transport\u2019s role in fostering subregional cooperation is crucial.\nThe focus of the consulting services will be to improve the efficiency and safety of the Almaty-\nBishkek road through streamlining the cross-border road transport and customs policy and\nregulations and documentation, and improving the coordination and management of road safety\nin  the  corridor.  In  addition,  assistance  to  Kazakhstan  will  help  implement  market-oriented\npolicies and procedures in line with the studies carried out under ADB\u2019s technical assistance\n(TA),  and  help  define  the  road  sector  functions  of  the  Kazakh  Ministry  of  Transport  and\nCommunications (KAZMOTC) in line with the road reforms that have been implemented or are\nproposed to be carried out in the future.\n5.  The  TA  will  comprise  three  phases:  (i)  improving  cross-border  road  transport  and\ncustoms documentation and procedures, (ii) road safety, and (iii) policy advisory support to\nKAZMOTC.\n6.  The issues relating to the Road Fund and Road Act have been covered by the earlier\nADB-financed projects. The consultants are expected to monitor progress on those issues in\nfulfilling the objectives of the consulting services.", "67\nAppendix 15, page 2\nB. Objectives\n7.  The advisory TA is aimed at assisting the two Governments in increasing subregional\ntrade through improved road transportation between Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic.  The\nTA will consist of three phases.\n8.  The prime objectives of phase I will be to assist the two Governments to implement the\nCross-Border Agreement, including formulating long-term strategies for expanded use of the\nAgreement at other borders, with a view to foster regional economic cooperation.\n9.  Phase II will focus on improving coordination and management of road safety in both\ncountries,  including  coordination  with  the  project  supervision  consultants,  to  ensure  that\nmaintenance by contract includes adequate provisions relating to environmental and social\nmitigation measures and road safety considerations.\n10.  Based on the overall reallocation of activities between the Committee of Road and Road\nTransport (CRRT) and Kazakhavtodor, phase III will streamline the ministerial and departmental\nresponsibilities, assign roles based on the redefined functions, and help implement the RSPS in\nKazakhstan.\n C. Scope of Services\n11.  It is estimated that consulting services of about 32 person-months international and 30\ndomestic will be required.1\n1. Cross Border Documentation and Procedures\na. Transport and Customs Documentation\n12.  The  consultants  will  review  all  existing  cross-border  documentation  and  introduce\nchanges  at  the  Akzhol/Chu  border  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  in  the  Cross-Border\nAgreement signed by Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic.\n  \n13.  The following minimum documentation will be introduced for vehicles transiting through\nthe Akzhol/Chu border crossing:\nFreight transport:\nFor the driver\n(i) Driving License\n(ii)  Passport or Identity Card\nFor the vehicle\n(i)  International Operating Permit\n(ii)  Registration Documents\n(iii)  Special Permit (if necessary)\n                                            \n1 Kazakhstan: 22 international and 18 domestic consulting services; the Kyrgyz Republic: 10 international and 12\ndomestic.", "68\nAppendix 15, page 3\nFor the goods\n(i) Cargo Customs Declaration\n(ii)  Cargo Waybill\n(iii)  Cargo Shipment Control Document\n(iv)  TIR  (Transport  International  Routier)  Carnet  (if  traveling  under  TIR\nconditions)\n(v) International Waybill CMR (Convention Merchandise Route) Certificate\n(for traveling under CMR cover)\nPassenger transport:\nFor the driver\n(i) Driving License\n(ii)  Passport or Identity Card\nFor the vehicle\n(i) Registration Documents\n(ii) Authorization Certificate (if regular bus service or alternative authorization\ndocument if irregular bus service)\n14.   The inspection at the Akzhol/Chu border will be limited to these documents. Drivers\nmay be required to carry additional support documentation to enable final clearance of the\ncargo, but those should not be subject to production at the border control zone. To ensure\nsmooth and expeditious movement of traffic, the consultants will design the formats for the\nabove  documents,  which  will  be  simple  and  harmonious,  and  include  all  data  required  to\nimplement the automated customs system.\nb. Transport and Customs Procedures\n15.   With the introduction of the preceding documentation, the consultants will train the\nKazakh and the Kyrgyz officers at the Akzhol/Chu border in the execution of modern customs\nprocedures to ensure consistent application on both sides of the border. Specific training will\ninclude\n(i)  processing of TIR carnets,\n(ii)  use of risk assessment techniques,\n(iii)  vehicle inspection system, and\n(iv)  use of a computer for customs clearance.\n16.   The consultants will introduce the Automated Customs Clearance System (ACCS) for\nimplementation  as  a  pilot  program.  The  system  should  be  both  reliable  and  tested,  of\ninternational electronic data processing standard, and  allow external input through direct trader\ninput linkages.  The consultants will introduce computerized cargo registration with possible\nlinkage with a centralized ACCS.\n17.  The  consultants  will  review  all  the  bilateral  and  multilateral  agreements  with  similar\nobjectives that are in effect or binding on Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic and identify", "69\nAppendix 15, page 4\nconflicting provisions with regard to the CBA, and recommend revisions, if necessary, to eliminate\nsuch conflicts and ensure a smooth implementation of the CBA.\n18.  Based  on  the  implementation  of  the  revised  documentation  and  procedures  at  the\nAkzhol/Chu border, the consultants will recommend strategies to implement the Cross-Border\nAgreement with other neighboring countries, particularly with the People\u2019s Republic of China,\nRussia and Uzbekistan to facilitate and promote regional trade through efficient movement of\ngoods, luggage, and passengers.\n2. Road Safety\n19.   Road safety is a multidimensional social problem involving many sectors: education,\nhealth, police, and transport as well as the private sector involved in insurance, fuel supply, and\nbus and freight transport operations. The activities have to be complementary and coordinated so\nthat the road safety measures to avoid loss of current resources on account of vehicle damage,\nmedical treatment, police and administration costs, and damage to the street furniture can be\nundertaken.  Such coordination can be achieved only through the establishment of the national\nroad safety council (NRSC).\n \n20.  The Government\u2019s role in improving road safety should consist of three elements: legal\nframework,  safety  education,  and  maintenance  of  a  traffic  safety  plan.  The  consultants  will\nprepare the road safety acts (RSAs) for Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic.  The main purpose\nof the RSA is to safeguard the interests of the road users with regard to road safety standards\nand practices, and to establish a legal basis for the establishment of NRSCs.\n21.  The road safety component will include the following tasks:\n(i)  reviewing  existing  legislation  and  prosecution  patterns  to  identify  the\nareas that need revision and drafting RSAs for both the countries. The\nRSAs will define the functions and responsibilities of various government\nsectors (education, health, police, and transport) and private companies\n(insurance, fuel, bus and freight transport) involved in road safety. The\nRSAs will include legislation concerning safe driving,2 safety audit of the\nroad  designs,  safety  education,  road  safety  publicity,  vehicle  safety\nstandards, road safety research, and emergency assistance to accident\nvictims;\n(ii)  assisting in the establishment of the multidisciplinary NRSC in the Kyrgyz\nRepublic  with  a  full-time  secretariat,  and    defining  functions  and\nresponsibilities;\n(iii)  translating the Road Safety Guidelines prepared under ADB\u2019sTA 5620-\nREG3 and conducting seminars familiarizing NRSCs and the concerned\nsector representatives with the provisions of the guidelines;\n                                            \n2 Safe driving considerations, among others, include drunk-driving limits and enforcement, speed zones and speed\nenforcement, seat belt and helmet regulations, motor insurance policies, and driver training and testing.\n3 Regional Initiatives in Road Safety, for $600,000, approved on 4 January 1995.", "70\nAppendix 15, page 5\n(iv)  undertaking a statistical analysis of road accident records in the Almaty-\nBishkek road and identifying underlying factors influencing safety on the\nroad  (with specific attention to winter accidents), with a view to include in\nthe  maintenance  contract  the  provisions  for  maintaining  all  safety\nmeasures (e.g. signposts, road markings, etc.) and environmental and\nsocial  impact  mitigation  measures,  and  of  the  liabilities  thereof  if  the\ncontractor fails to implement the measures; and\n(v)  reviewing the draft contracts prepared by the supervision consultants and\nproviding inputs relating to road safety as a result of the findings from the\naccident statistical analysis.\n22.  The road maintenance contract should be seen as the way to improving road safety,\nwhere competition and threat of legal action would raise safety standards. The consultants will\ncoordinate with the construction supervision consultants so that road safety provisions, and also\nenvironmental and social impact mitigation requirements are incorporated in the provisions of\nmaintenance by contract.\n3.  Advisory Support to KAZMOTC\n23.  The advisory TA to the transport sector will be provided, with the help of the transport\nadviser, to assist the minister and senior personnel of the Ministry of Transport, Communications\nand Tourism to adopt market-oriented policies and laws and regulations, and help in defining the\nroad sector functions of KAZMOTC in line with the road reforms that have taken place or are\nproposed to be carried out in future.\n24.   The transport advisor will assist in the following areas:\n(i) define KAZMOTC's role, objectives, and its relationship with CRRT, its\ndepartments, and transport operators in transition to a market economy in\nline with the policy framework adopted through the RSPS and consistent\nwith the pace of reforms that have taken place so far and have been\nproposed for the future, and update the Automobiles Road Act;\n(ii) assist in implementing the provisions in the RSPS;\n(iii) adopt transport regulations that promote equitable competition among\ntransport modes (e.g., between road and rail) and help develop private\ntransport operators while assisting the Government in the promotion of\nsafe and environmentally acceptable transport operations;\n(iv) review  pricing  policies  in  the  transport  sector,  including  the  price  of\ntransport  inputs,  and  make  recommendations  on  reducing  price\ndistortions, road-user cost recovery and subsidy policies and strategies,\nand transport operators' autonomy in setting transport prices;\n(v) assist  in  the  preparation  of  the  three-year  national  transportation\ninvestment  plan,  paying  particular  attention  to  providing  advice  on\nanalytical  methods  for  assessing  the  potential  for  complementary", "71\nAppendix 15, page 6\noperations among transport modes, especially between the road and rail\nmodes, and between aviation and road network development; and\n(vi) assist KAZMOTC to implement the Human Resources Development Plan\nand Systems Development Plan prepared under ADB\u2019s TA No. 2631-KAZ:\nInstitutional Strengthening of the Road Sector).4 \n25.   The Adviser will bear in mind that, for each road to have an effective, unique owner, the\nroad  system  should  be  divided,  in  a  manner  appropriate  to  the  country  concerned,  into\nsubsystems  of  appropriate  size  and  character;  and  a  fee-for-use  system  of  road  user  cost\nrecovery (vis-a-vis fee-for-funding maintenance and operation) should be encouraged.\nD. Implementation Arrangements and Timing\n26.   KAZMOTC and KGZMOTC will be the Executing Agencies (EAs) and will provide overall\nguidance in the activities under the TA.  The EAs will appoint suitable senior counterparts who will\nbe responsible for the day-to-day supervision and coordination activities- including monitoring\nprogress achieved and resolution of any difficulties that may arise during implementation, and will\nmaintain a close working relationship with each other.  The consulting services are expected to\nstart in the first quarter of 2001. The services of the transport policy adviser will be provided on a\nstaggered basis, and the TA is expected to be completed before the end of 2004.\nE. Counterpart Staff and Facilities\n27.  KAZMOTC and KGZMOTC will provide counterpart staff who will be trained by the TA\nconsultants, office accommodations, local communications, and administrative support.\nF. Required Expertise\n28.  For phase I, the services of customs and road transport specialists experienced in dealing\nwith cross-border road trade and transport issues, including establishing ACCS, will be required.\nThe specialist should be able to design and implement the system, and train the local staff in\nmodern customs and vehicle inspection procedures.\n29.  For phase II, expertise in road safety will be required. A highway engineer experienced in\nestablishing NRSC, undertaking statistical analysis of road accidents, and training the counterpart\nstaff will be essential. In addition, the services of a legal expert experienced in drafting the RSAs\nand preparing civil works contract documents will be required.\n30.  For phase III, transport policy adviser, who will be a senior transport economist, must have\nextensive experience in transport policy review and analysis, transport regulations, transport\npricing, and procurement. The assignment will be for nine months over the three-year duration of\nthe Project.\nG. Submission of Reports\n31.  For phases I and II, the consultants will provide the following reports in both English and\nRussian:\n                                            \n4 For $750,000, approved on 27 August 1996.", "72\nAppendix 15, page 7\n(i) an inception report detailing the work program, deliverables under the TA, and\ntimetable  for  achievements,  within  four  weeks  of  the  commencement  of  the\nconsultancy (five copies for the Government and three for ADB);\n(ii)  brief monthly reports on the status of the consultancy and its achievements\n(three copies for the Government and one copy for ADB);\n(iii)  draft transport and customs documentation to be introduced, with a brief manual\nexplaining the procedures for completing the documentation and their relevance;\n(iv)  ACCS manual;\n(v)  draft RSAs for comments and RSAs after incorporating the comments;\n(vi)  Russian version of Road Safety Guidelines;\n(vii)  draft final report, within 18 weeks of the commencement of the consultancy (five\ncopies  for  the  Government  and  three  for  ADB),  which  will  include  all  tasks\nundertaken by the consultants, including a review of the training conducted for\nboth cross-border and safety aspects,  and assessment of impact  including\ndifficulties encountered and remedial measures taken; and\n(viii)  final report incorporating the Governments\u2019 and ADB's comments, within two\nweeks of receiving all comment (five copies for the Governments and three for\nADB).\n32.   For phase III, the policy adviser will prepare a short progress report for KAZMOTC and\nADB after every six weeks in the field, giving a summary of the transport reform and proposing a\ndetailed work program for the rest of his/her assignment.

For preparing the traffic forecast, the Project road was divided into eight sections (four\neach  for  Kazakh  and  Kyrgyz  components),  based  on  traffic  and  road  characteristics.  The\nanalysis covers the construction period 2001-2004 plus the subsequent 20 years of operation.\nThe traffic forecasts have been prepared for each section based on actual traffic and economic\ndata as well as forecasts of economic and population growth in the Project area. Transit traffic,\nwhich  accounts  for  8-25  percent  of  truck  traffic,  is  included  in  the  traffic  forecasts.  Both\nKazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic are facing difficult economic situations at the present time,\ndue to the impact of the Russian economic crisis and low prices for the commodities comprising\nKazakhstan\u2019s principal exports. However, the longer-term future for both countries is considered\nbrighter: Kazakhstan has substantial natural resources, and the Kyrgyz Republic has made\nsubstantial progress in its transformation to a market-based economy. The relocation of the\nKazakh capital from Almaty to Astana will not affect traffic on the Project road as traffic which\npreviously used Project road to reach Almaty will still need to use it to reach Astana.\n2.    For the Kazakh portion, the traffic forecast is based on the assumption that traffic levels\nwill remain constant at their 1997 levels through 2001, due to Kazakhstan\u2019s ongoing economic\ndifficulties. After 2001, traffic levels will grow at average annual growth rates of 4.5-5.9 percent,\nreflecting the economy\u2019s long-term potential for growth. Cars are by far the largest category of\nvehicle, accounting for 77-87 percent of the traffic on the four sections during the  period of\nanalysis.  In  addition  to  personal  transport,  vehicles  categorized  as  cars  are  also  used\ncommercially for transport of small loads of cargo. The remainder of the traffic is fairly evenly\ndistributed among buses, light trucks, and heavy trucks, although heavy trucks constitute the\nsmallest category\n3.   As there are no viable road or rail alternatives to the Project road, the traffic forecast\ndoes not include any traffic diverted to or from the Project road. The Kazakh portion of the road\nincludes traffic generated by: (i) decreases in vehicle operating costs (VOCs) resulting from\nresurfacing  and  other  road  improvements,  including  realignment  in  the  Kurday  pass  area,\ncarried out under the Project, and (ii) increased trade and new economic activities arising from\nthe improvement of cross-border procedures under the Project. Traffic generated by decreases\nin VOCs generally ranges from 2 percent of total traffic in the early years of the period of\nanalysis to about 20 percent in the latter years. Traffic generated as part of the subregional\nbenefits of the Project accounts for 3-5 percent of total truck traffic and approximately 1 percent\nof total traffic.\n4.    The traffic forecast for the Kyrgyz portion is based on annual growth of 3 percent through\n2001, and that of approximately 5 percent from 2001 to 2024. This reflects the slightly better\nmedium-term growth prospects compared to Kazakhstan. The decrease in VOCs from the road\nimprovement along the Kyrgyz portion of the road is not expected to produce a significant\namount of generated traffic as a larger portion of the vehicle trips on the Kyrgyz sections are of\na local nature and shorter in length than those on the Kazakh sections. Traffic generated as a\nresult of the subregional benefits represents 5 percent of truck traffic, but less than 1 percent of\ntotal traffic. Cars account for 89-93 percent of total traffic during the period of analysis and, as in\nthe Kazakh case, are used for personal transport as well as transport of small loads of cargo.\nThe remainder of the traffic is distributed among buses and trucks.", "76\nAppendix 18, page 2\n5.   A traffic forecast for the Project road has been prepared based on actual traffic and\neconomic data as well as forecasts of economic and population growth in the Project area\n(Appendix 19). For the Kazakh portion, traffic is forecast to remain constant at 1997 levels\n(3,143-9,655 AADT depending on the road section) through 2001, due to Kazakhstan's ongoing\neconomic difficulties. After 2001, traffic levels will grow at average annual growth rates of 4.5-\n5.9  percent,  reaching  11,643-26,379  AADT  in  2024,  reflecting  the  long-term  potential  for\neconomic growth. For the Kyrgyz portion, traffic is forecast to grow at an annual rate of 3.0\npercent through 2001 and approximately 5.0 percent in the succeeding years. Depending on the\nsection, traffic levels on the Kyrgyz portion of the Project road are forecast to increase from\n3,361-9,342 AADT in 1998 to 10,537-29,140 AADT in 2024. Cars comprise the largest category\nof vehicle, accounting for 77-93 percent of traffic on the road sections. The traffic forecast\nincludes traffic generated by (i) decreased vehicle operating costs (for the Kazakh part only) and\n(ii) increased trade and new economic activities arising from the improvement of cross-border\nprocedures (for both parts). The forecast does not include diverted traffic, as there are no viable\nroad or rail alternatives to the Project.", "77\nAppendix 18, page 3\nTable A18: Forecast of Total Traffic (Including Transit Traffic)\n(Average Annual Daily Traffic)\nRoad  Private Light Heavy Total\nSection Year Cars Buses Trucks Trucks\nKazakh Sections\nAlmaty City-Kaskelen\n1998 8,315 440 743 157 9,655\n2005 9,772 511 830 201 11,314\n2014 15,086 673 1,307 352 17,417\n2024 23,060 927 1,850 542 26,379\nKaskelen-Uzunagach\n1998 3,636 413 401 180 4,631\n2005 4,391 480 456 229 5,556\n2014 8,120 634 746 387 9,887\n2024 13,565 872 1,083 588 16,109\nUzunagach-Otar\n1998 2,402 311 276 154 3,143\n2005 2,925 363 305 187 3,779\n2014 5,653 481 497 313 6,944\n2024 9,711 668 762 502 11,643\nOtar-Georgievka\n1998 2,970 334 320 173 3,797\n2005 3,679 396 372 217 4,665\n2014 7,112 533 584 355 8,584\n2024 11,531 685 814 514 13,543\nKyrgyz Sections\nBishkek-Bypass Intersection (Link 1)\n1998 8,522 339 351 130 9,342\n2005 10,577 393 484 178 11,632\n2014 16,251 507 811 298 17,867\n2024 26,473 682 1,453 534 29,140\nBypass Intersection-Georgievka (Link 2)\n1998 6,337 214 324 188 7,064\n2005 7,865 248 447 257 8,818\n2014 12,086 321 748 431 13,586\n2024 19,687 431 1,338 774 22,229\nBypass Intersection-Maevka (Link 3A)\n1998 6,893 108 392 213 7,606\n2005 8,555 125 542 291 9,512\n2014 13,144 162 906 488 14,699\n2024 21,411 217 1,621 874 24,123\nMaevka-Osh Highway (Link 3B)\n1998 3,131 65 73 92 3,361\n2005 3,886 75 100 126 4,188\n2014 5,971 98 168 211 6,448\n2024 9,726 131 302 379 10,537\nSource: Consultants' reports.", "78\nAppendix 19, page 1\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS\nA. General\n1. The economic analysis of the rehabilitation of the Almaty-Bishkek road was carried out\non the basis of a comparison of the with- and without Project situations and using the world\nprice  numeraire.  The  Project  involves providing  new  base  courses,  resurfacing,  and  other\nimprovements on the entire project road and new alignments in parts of the Kurday Pass. The\nwithout-Project scenario involves routine and periodic maintenance at current levels to keep the\nroad in its current condition. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were calculated for four\nprimary  scenarios:  (i)  the  Kazakh  portion  of  the  project  road  including  benefits  from  road\nrehabilitation but excluding subregional benefits, (ii) the Kyrgyz portion with road rehabilitation\nbenefits  but  excluding  subregional  benefits,  (iii)  overall  project  and  country  components\nincluding subregional benefits, and (iv) overall Project including regional benefits arising from\ntransit traffic. The economic analysis covered a period of 24 years (2001-2024) including four\nyears of construction. All costs and benefits were estimated in constant 1999 prices. The\neconomic analysis of the Project was based on separate studies prepared on the Kazakhstan\nportion of the road, the Kyrgyz Republic portion, and on subregional benefits.1\nB. Costs\n2. Project  economic  costs  include  the  resource  costs  of  road  improvement  and\nmaintenance. Costs for the subregional component include costs for equipment and training. As\npart of the calculation of economic costs, the local currency costs were divided into tradable and\nnontradable groups. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 (for both Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz\nRepublic) was then applied to the nontradable portion. A shadow wage rate was applied to the\nfinancial costs of unskilled labor to convert them to economic costs.\nC. Benefits\n3. Economic benefits used in the four EIRR scenarios were estimated for the Kazakhstan\nportion  of  the  project  road  (Almaty-Georgievka);  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  portion  of  the  road\n(Georgievka/Chui-Bishkek); the subregional aspects of the Project, i.e., improvements in cross-\nborder policies and procedures; and transit traffic, which provides benefits to other countries in\nthe region.\n1. Kazakhstan\n4. The main sources of economic benefits from the Kazakh portion of the Project (205 km),\nexcluding subregional benefits, include savings (i) in vehicle operating costs (VOCs) for normal\ntraffic, (ii) from traffic generated by the reduction in VOCs, and (iii) in time because of the\nimproved alignment in the Kurday Pass for freight and passenger traffic. In most years, the\nmaintenance costs without the Project, which are based on actual expenditures, are less than\nthose estimated to be incurred after completion of the project road so that there are no net\nsavings in maintenance expenditures due to the Project. VOC savings by vehicle type are\nshown in Table A19.1. Benefits from VOC savings for generated traffic are estimated at half the\nvalue for normal traffic.\n                  \n1 Asian Development Bank, Cross-Border Issues Study, September 1998.", "79\nAppendix 19, page 2\n5. VOC savings due to the Project\u2019s improvement of road conditions comprise the largest\ncategory of savings, accounting for 70-80 percent of total benefits. Unit economic VOCs for\npassenger and freight vehicles were estimated using the latest version of the Highway Design\nand Maintenance Model (HDM-Manager). VOC savings will accrue primarily from improvements\nin the road surface, horizontal and vertical alignment, and increased average speed in some\nsections.\n6. The  new  alignment  of  the  Almaty-Bishkek  road  in  the  Kurday  Pass  and  resulting\nincreased speeds will reduce travel times on the road by 30 minutes for cars, one hour for\nbuses, and 1.5 hours for trucks. Estimates of benefits from these time savings use estimated\nwages for passengers and drivers. The wider shoulders of the Project road and the improved\nalignment in the Kurday Pass area will significantly improve the safety conditions of the road.\nWhile insufficient data is available to quantify the savings from reducing the level of vehicle\naccidents, these benefits are expected to increase the overall level of benefits from the Project.\nTable A19.1: Representative Vehicle Operating Costs, by Vehicle Type\n($ per vehicle-km)\nScenario Car Bus Light/Medium Heavy Truck\nTruck\nA.

Benefits for the portion of the Project road located in the Kyrgyz Republic (40 km),\nexcluding subregional benefits, are limited to savings in VOCs for normal traffic. The speed on\nthe Kyrgyz portion of the project road is restricted by the posted speed limits rather than the\nconditions of the road so there will be no time savings from the road improvements. In most\nyears, the maintenance costs without the Project, based on actual expenditures, are lower than\nwhat they will be once the Project is implemented so that there are no net savings in the\nmaintenance expenditures due to the Project. VOC savings due to the Project\u2019s improvement of\nroad conditions were based on estimates from the VOC module of HDM-Manager. During the\nproject period, it will be necessary to complete resealing and overlays of the road in the without-\nProject case, which will lower the VOC savings in the years immediately following this roadwork\ncompared with the preceding years. The reductions in VOCs are not expected to be great\nenough to produce a significant amount of generated traffic on this portion of the project road as\na larger portion of the vehicle trips on the Kyrgyz sections are of a local nature and are shorter\nin length than those on the Kazakh sections. Traffic will be generated as part of the subregional\naspects of the Project, however.", "80\nAppendix 19, page 3\n3. Subregional Benefits\n8. The improvement in cross-border policies and procedures will result in a decrease in the\namount of time spent at the Georgievka-Chui border crossing. Two categories of subregional\nbenefits arise from the project: (i) time savings, and (iii) new economic activity to meet the\nincreased  demand  for  goods  due  to  lower  costs  of  trade.  The  improved  border  control\nprocedures will result in time savings from the removal of (i) control point delays, (ii) border\nprocessing delays, and (iii) clearance delays. The time savings will lower the costs of trade.\nAvailable data to estimate the benefits from the new economic activity are insufficient; however,\nthe benefits are expected to increase the overall level of project benefits. The decreased cost of\ntrade and the new economic activity will result in an increase in the volume of trade and the\namount of traffic necessary to transport it. The increased trade will involve products such as\nfresh produce and other agricultural goods and is estimated to generate an increase in bus and\ntruck traffic equivalent to 5 percent of the estimated normal traffic of these vehicle types on the\nproject road. The subregional benefits were allocated between Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz\nRepublic, using proportions of 48 percent and 52 percent, respectively. These proportions were\ndetermined on the basis of the direction of traffic flow of heavy vehicles through the border\ncrossing.\nD. Results of Economic Analysis\n9. The EIRR for the overall Project, including subregional benefits, is estimated at 27.6\npercent (Table A19.2). Due to the much smaller scale of the Kyrgyz portion of the Project\nrelative to the Kazakh portion and the approximately equal distribution of subregional benefits,\nthe inclusion of subregional benefits has a larger impact on the EIRR for the Kyrgyz component,\nwhich has an EIRR of 48.8 percent versus 25.6 percent for the Kazakh component. The EIRR\nfor the overall Project, excluding subregional benefits, is estimated at 23.8 percent. The EIRRs\nfor the Kazakh and Kyrgyz components are much closer, 23.7 and 25.9, respectively, when\nsubregional  benefits  are  excluded.  Transit  traffic  has  been  excluded  from  these  EIRR\ncalculations as the benefits associated with this traffic do not accrue to either country. Benefits\nfrom  transit  traffic  will  accrue  to  other  countries  in  the  region  (principally  Russia  and\nUzbekistan). Inclusion of direct regional benefits in the form of VOC savings along with the\nsubregional  benefits  increases  the  EIRR  to  28.0  percent.  Secondary  regional  benefits  are\ndifficult to quantify, but are expected to further increase the level of project benefits. Details of\nthe EIRR calculations are shown in Tables A19.3-A19.9.\n10. Sensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  to  test  the  impact  of  negative  changes  in  key\nparameters determining the costs and benefits of the Project. The sensitivity analysis for the\noverall Project, including subregional benefits, indicates that it would take an increase in costs\nof 170 percent or a decrease in benefits of 63 percent for the EIRR to decline to the cutoff level\nof 12 percent. The switching values for the Project including subregional benefits are lower for\nthe Kazakh component than for the Kyrgyz component. The switching values for the Project\nexcluding subregional benefits are smaller than those for the Project including these benefits,\nbut still quite high overall. Given that both countries now have experience in implementing ADB-\nfinanced road projects, it is not likely that such large increases in costs will occur. Similarly,\ngiven the somewhat conservative nature of the traffic forecast, it is not likely that such large\ndecreases in benefits will occur.", "81\nAppendix 19, page 4\nTable A19.2: Base Case EIRRs
