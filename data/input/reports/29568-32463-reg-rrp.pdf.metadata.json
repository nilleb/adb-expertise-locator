The Report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for\nImprovement of the Road Sector Efficiency in each of Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, and\nif the proposed loans are approved by the Board, I, acting under the authority delegated to me\nby the Board, shall approve the technical assistance for Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.  \nRegional  cooperation  among  the  countries  of  Central  Asia  is  required  to  develop  their\neconomies.  The  transport  sector  contributes  substantially  toward  that  end  through  the\ndevelopment  of  adequate  transport  infrastructure  that  allows  new  markets  to  be  opened  up.1\nThe emergence of cost-effective and competitive transport modes facilitates the restructuring of\ntrade  and  industry  and  expands  the  scope  of  international  trade  in  goods  and  services.\nStreamlined  transport  logistics  aimed  at  overcoming  physical  and  nonphysical  cross-border\nbarriers  have  a  major  impact  on  the  scope  for  international  trade  in  goods  and  services.\nPhysical barriers include poor road infrastructure, inadequate control points, and different axle\nload limits. Nonphysical barriers comprise excessive taxes and fees, inconsistent transport and\ncustoms documentation, and attitudinal problems of and unauthorized payments to border staff.\n\n3.  \nFor road transport to contribute toward regional cooperation in addition to reducing road\naccidents  and  travel  cost,  an  efficient  road  transport  system  and  effective  cross-border\ncooperation are essential. The proposed Project aims to improve the efficiency of transport on\nthe  Almaty-Bishkek  road,  one  of  the  most  important  road  links  in  the  Central  Asian  region\n(Appendix  1).  The  Project  is  expected  to  contribute  substantially  to  enhancing  regional\neconomic cooperation, initially between Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, and in the longer\nterm among all Central Asian Republics (CARs), as about 25 percent of the freight traffic on the\nroad  is  international.  The  Project  is  timely  in  introducing  the  concept  of  cross-border\nmodernization  and  cooperation,  given  the  difficulties  the  CARs  are  facing  in  adjusting  their\nadministrative arrangements and regulations to overcome the impact of the Russian economic\ncrisis.\n\n4.  \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  supporting  regional  economic\ncooperation in the CARs and, since early 1997, has provided a number of TAs for this purpose\n(Appendix  2).  The  initiatives  in  the  transport  sector  include  coordination  of  sector  reforms\nthrough  country-specific  projects,  development  of  road  standards,  and  preparation  of  road\nsafety guidelines.\n\nFeasibility  studies  for  the  Kazakh  section  of  the  Project  were  prepared  by  the\n5. \nconsultants engaged under ADB's project preparatory TA2 and those for the Kyrgyz section by\nthe project supervision consultants engaged under the ongoing first ADB-financed project.3 The\nfeasibility  studies  were  completed  in  April  1998  and  May  1998,  respectively.  Fact-finding  was\nundertaken  in  March  1999  to  discuss  key  policy  issues  concerning  cross-border  cooperation,\nroad safety, and road maintenance, and to review the preparatory work. An Appraisal Mission\n\n                  \n\n1 The value addition by transport is estimated to account for 3-5 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), The\n\nWorld Bank, Transport website.\n\n2 TA 2632-KAZ: Feasibility Study of Selected Priority Road Sections, for $250,000, approved on 27 August 1996.\n3 Loan 1444-KGZ: Road Rehabilitation Project, for $50 million, approved on 13 June 1996.\n\n\f2\n\nvisited  Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  from  14  June  to  2  July  1999.4  The  Mission  held\ndiscussions on issues concerning subregional transport cooperation and associated policy and\ninstitutional reforms with officials of the concerned Government entities, and representatives of\ntransport organizations and external agencies active in the transport sector. This report is based\non  the  findings  of  the  feasibility  studies  and  ADB  missions,  discussions  with  Government\nofficials  and  road  sector  representatives,  and  various  reports  and  data  provided  by  the  two\nGovernments.  Joint  loan  negotiations  with  the  authorized  representatives  of  the  Governments\nwere conducted in Manila from 4 to 7 September 2000.5 If approved, the proposed loans will be\nADB's  second  and  third  to  the  transport  sectors  of  Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,\nrespectively.\n\nA. \n\nTransport Infrastructure  in the Central Asian Republics\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n6. \nThe existing transport infrastructure in the CARs, inherited from the former Soviet Union\n(FSU),  was  developed  as  a  regional  network  to  serve  the  FSU\u2019s  needs,  without  taking  into\nconsideration  the  administrative  boundaries  of  the  CARs  and  paying  little  attention  to  the\nregional  economic  cooperation  outside  of  the  Council  for  Mutual  Economic  Assistance\ncountries.  The  network  was  primarily  designed  to  serve  intra-FSU  traffic.  This  has  created  a\nnumber  of  difficulties  after  independence,  as  the  CARs  found  themselves  with  fragmented\ntransport networks that frequently cross and recross the borders of neighboring countries.\n\n7.   \nThe  transport  system  has  to  be  made  efficient,  and  trade  and  transport  regulations\nharmonized,  in  view  of  the  economic  reforms  and  political  realignment,  emerging  free  trade\nareas, and custom unions. Part of the difficulties of the CARs in competing in the global markets\nis  attributable  to  bottlenecks  in  the  transport  infrastructure  that  constrain  growth,  and  to\ninefficient  administrative  arrangements  and  regulations  that  govern  freight  and  passenger\ntransport. The transport sector faces the challenge of balancing investments in rehabilitating the\ndeteriorating  assets  to  restore  and  preserve  the  integrity  of  past  investments,  and  those  in\nimproving  system  capacity  and  efficiency,  including  new  construction,  to  meet  domestic,\nregional, and global needs.\n\n1.\n\nThe Transport Sector in Kazakhstan\n\na.\n\nGeneral\n\n8. \nThe  major  characteristic  of  the  transport  sector  in  Kazakhstan  is  the  high  demand  for\ntransport  services  due  to  (i)  Kazakhstan's  vast  territory  and  scattered  population,  natural\nresources,  and  activities;  and  (ii)  the  existing  trade  pattern  resulting  from  (a)  the  FSU's\nspecialized  economy  in  which  Kazakhstan's  earlier  role  was  to  serve  as  the  source  of  raw\nmaterials and intermediate products for the FSU, and (b) the underpricing of transport services\nduring the FSU era. The transport demand has been falling drastically since the FSU\u2019s breakup\nand the start of economic restructuring in 1992. The 99.5 billion ton-kilometer (km) of freight in\n1999  was  only  less  than  one  quarter  of  the  1990  figure  of  455.9  billion  ton-km.  In  passenger\n\n                  \n\n4 The  Mission  comprised  S.  Tamang,  Mission  Leader,  Senior  Project  Specialist;  Y.  Zhang,  Special  Advisor  to\nGeneral Counsel; J. C. Alexander, Senior Programs Officer; T. David Hodgkinson, Senior Cofinancing Officer; J.\nMiller, Project Economist; Lan Wu, Economist; and Ma. T. Zappia, Socioeconomic Specialist.\n\n5  The loan negotiations were delayed because of the need to resolve issues concerning transit traffic in the Cross-\nBorder Agreement (footnote 28) and delayed approval of the Kazakhstan\u2019s Public Investment Program (para. 11).\n\n\f3\n\ntraffic, the 68.5 billion passenger-km recorded in 1990 decreased by one quarter to 17.1 billion\npassenger-km in 1997 (Appendix 3). However, these dramatic decreases need to be put in the\ncontext  of  the  somewhat  artificial  nature  of  the  demand  for  transport  in  a  centrally  planned\neconomy,  where  tariffs  and  fares  were  set  without  consideration  of  the  cost  of  the  services\nprovided.\n\n9.  \nThe transport sector in Kazakhstan comprises roads, railways, civil aviation, and inland\nwaterways.  The  railway  is  the  dominant  mode,  transporting  coal  for  energy  production  and\ncarrying  over  90  percent  of  all  freight  in  1994-1999.  The  remainder  of  the  freight  is  carried  by\nroad. As transport demand will become much more diversified, specific quality features such as\nspeed,  reliability,    waiting  time,  minimization  of  losses  and  damages,  and  the  ability  to  move\nsmall loads efficiently will become much more important than in the past. These features require\nflexible,  cost-efficient  transport  services  that  are  market  responsive.  Consequently,  with  the\ninherently greater suitability of road transport than railways for meeting the increased demand\nfor specialized services, the share of roads in freight transport is expected to increase from the\ncurrent 5 percent to about 30 percent6, provided the road and road transport sectors are able to\nmeet  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  demanded  by  the  market  through  infrastructure\nrehabilitation,  policy  reform,  and  capacity  development.  With  regard  to  passenger  traffic,\nrailways accounted for about 52 percent of passenger-km, roads for 35 percent, and air for 12\npercent in 1999. A shift is also expected from railways to roads in passenger transport as the\ncondition  of  roads  improve,  private  car  ownership  grows,  and  intercity  bus  services  are\nprivatized.\n\nb.\n\nTransport Planning and Investment\n\n10. \nThe  Kazakh  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (KAZMOTC)  is  responsible  for\nall  transport  infrastructure\u2013roads,  railways,  airports,  ports  and  inland  waterways\u2013and  for\ntelecommunications and tourism activities. KAZMOTC is in charge of sector policy, regulation,\nplanning,  and  development.  It  is  guided  by  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers,  Ministry  of  Finance  and\nMinistry of Economy, which are involved in developing the Government's overall reform program\nand prioritizing capital expenditures. KAZMOTC is divided into eight departments and is headed\nby the minister, who is assisted by three vice ministers (Appendix 4).\n\n11. \nThe 1999-2001 Public Investment Program approved by the Parliament in August 2000\nprovides a prioritized summary of Kazakhstan\u2019s investment program for foreign assistance. The\nrehabilitation  of  the  Almaty-Karaganda-Astana  and  Almaty-Bishkek-Shymkent  road  corridors\nhas  been  accorded  high  priority.  Within  these  corridors,  the  Almaty-Bishkek  road  is  the  most\nimportant link in view of its subregional importance.  Other important transport projects include\nreconstruction  of  the  Aktau  port,  construction  of  the  Astana  airport,  development  of  urban\ntransport in Astana, and railway development.\n\n12.    \nIn terms of gross domestic product (GDP), public investment in the road sector dropped\nfrom  1.2  percent  in  1990  to  0.3  percent  during  1994  and  even  less  in  1995  and  1996.    The\ncurrent annual allocation of about 0.5 percent of GDP needs to be increased to about 2.0 - 2.5\nthe  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  requirements  and  avoid  major\npercent \nreconstruction costs in the near future.\n\nto  meet \n\n                  \n\n6  The share of road freight volume in the People\u2019s Republic of China is about 25 percent of the total freight volume. It\nis  about  55  percent  in  India  and  above  50  percent  in  most  European  countries,  e.g.,  Poland:  50  percent  and\nBulgaria: 55 percent.\n\n\f4\n\nc.\n\nThe Road and Road Transport Sector\n\ni.\n\nThe Road Network\n\nAlthough  the  road  network  in  Kazakhstan  provides  adequate  connections  to  all  19\n13. \nregions, the condition of about 17,380 km of national (republican) roads is not satisfactory and is\ndeteriorating further.  While 93 percent of the national roads are paved, more than 11,000 km\nneeds  rehabilitation.  The  other  roads  are  also  in  poor  condition;  they  include  provincial\n(regional) roads (70,461 km, with 57 percent paved), urban roads (22,600 km, with 65 percent\npaved),  and  rural  (economic)  roads  (57,000  km,  with  5  percent  paved).  While  the  geometric\nstandards  of  the  roads  have  generally  been  generous,  the  condition  of  the  pavement  is  poor\nmainly  because  of  sloppy  construction,  inadequate  maintenance,  and  the  increasing  use  of\nheavy  long-distance  trucks  (more  than  10  tons)  whereas  the  roads  were  designed  as  per  the\nFSU standards for a maximum permissible single-axle loads of only 6 tons.\n\nii.\n\nSector Management\n\n14. \nAfter independence, joint-stock holding companies, such as Kazakhstan Zoldhary, were\nformed to manage the Government's interest in the road sector. In early 1995, these companies\nwere reorganized into the Kazakh Department of Roads (KAZDOR), State Road Authority, and\n19  regional  road  authorities.  Recently,  the  Government  further  restructured  the  road\nadministration by converting KAZDOR into a policy-making department and renaming it as the\nCommittee of Road and Road Transport (CRRT) and setting up a central implementation unit,\nKazakhavtodor (Republican State Road Enterprise), and its regional affiliates through a merger\nof  the  State  Road  Authority  and  regional  road  authorities.  The  organizational  structure  of\nKazakhavtodor  is  shown  in  Appendix  4.  With  the  establishment  of  CRRT,  the  Board  of\nInvestment Projects and PIUs have been transferred to the Committee from Kazakhavtodor.\n\n  Kazakhavtodor  is  responsible  for  construction  as  a  contractor.  While  periodic\n15.  \nmaintenance  and  rehabilitation  works  are  carried  out  by  CRRT  through  competitive  tendering,\nroutine maintenance is undertaken on a force account basis where maintenance by contract is\nnot  feasible.  Although  the  current  institutional  setup  rightly  separates  road  administration  from\nthe  implementation  functions,  much  still  needs  to  be  done  to  develop  the  sector\u2019s  capacity,\nparticularly  in  terms  of  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  participation  and\nbuilding up private sector capability for road sector activities (para. 47).7\n\nIn  addition  to  CRRT  and  Kazakhavtodor,  the  Roads  and  Marine  Transport  Department\n16. \n(RMTD) is responsible for formulating road transport policies, regulating and coordinating road\ntransport operations, and licensing the operators. RMTD\u2019s objectives include improving service\nlevels  and  road  transport  technology,  facilitating  the  road  transport  sector's  transition  to  a\nmarket  economy,  and  reducing  transport  costs;  however,  weaknesses  in  the  legal  framework\nand  its  enforcement  still  inhibit  efficient  road  transport  operations.  Recognizing  this,  the\nGovernment has embarked on improvement and development of laws and regulations pertinent\nto  road  transport  and  their  enforcement  with  the  help  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Road Transport\nRestructuring Project.8\n\n                  \n\n7  Initially, execution of routine and winter maintenance of the Almaty-Karaganda road and, at a later date, that of the\nKaraganda-Astana  road  are  expected  to  be  contracted  out  by  renting  Government-owned  equipment  to  private\ncontractors.\n\n8  For $100 million, approved in January 1999.\n\n\f5\n\niii.\n\nTraffic and Vehicle Fleet\n\n17. \nTraffic  on  the  roads  of  Kazakhstan  in  generally  light.  Very  few  roads  have  an  average\nannual  daily  traffic  (AADT)  of  more  than  5,000.  Traffic  flows  on  the  national  roads  are  in  the\nrange  of  1,000-1,500  AADT  comprising  about  50  percent  trucks,  7  percent  buses,  and  43\npercent  cars.  Car  traffic  is  expected  to  increase  with  increasing  private  car  ownership  in  a\nmarket-based economy.\n\nThe  motorized  fleet  in  1999  consisted  of  1,278,347  vehicles,  of  which  205,687  were\n18.  \ntrucks, 43,421 buses, 987,724 cars, and 41,515 special vehicles. The truck and bus fleets are\nstill dominated by makes from the FSU. Some trucking companies have procured secondhand\ntrucks  of  larger  capacity  and  more  modern  design,  mainly  for  use  on  transnational  routes.    A\nsubstantial number of cars, most of them secondhand, are being imported privately from West\nEurope,  and  the  foreign  models  account  for  about  20  percent  of  the  country's  car  fleet.\nPreviously,  most  trucks  and  buses  were  operated  by  state  organizations,  but  since  the\nintroduction  of  the  privatization  program  and  auctions,  private  ownership  of  all  vehicles  has\nreached 93 percent (98 percent for cars).\n\niv.\n\nRoad Transport Industry\n\nPrivatization of the road transport industry in Kazakhstan began in 1993, and most of the\n19. \nindustry  is  now  with  the  private  sector.  A  two-stage  process  was  followed  to  privatize  the\ntrucking  enterprises:  first,  about  20  percent  of  the  trucks  were  auctioned  off  through  open\nauctions,  then  the  rest  of  the  enterprises  were  corporatized  and  sold  through  either  a  small-\nscale  or  a  mass  privatization  program  assisted  by  the  United  States  Agency  for  International\nDevelopment.9 Small enterprises (less than 100 vehicles or 200 employees) were sold through\npublic  auction  for  cash  under  the  small-scale  program,  while  larger  enterprises  were  sold\nthrough coupons to investment funds.\n\n20.  \nFor  passenger  transport,  RMTD  bids  out  the  transport  rights.  The  profitable  routes  are\nallotted based on the highest route-license bid for a fixed period of time, normally between one\nand three years. For routes that currently cannot sustain fully commercial operations but where\ntransport services are to be provided in the public interest, the route allocation is based on the\nlowest offered cost of operation. On routes that are not attractive to private operators, the buses\nowned by the Government or cooperatives and joint-stock companies provide services. RMTD\u2019s\nrole is limited to setting the level of service and tariffs, licensing, and monitoring the provision to\npassengers  of  such  services  as  booking  and  departure  facilities  and  emergency  vehicle\nreplacement.\n\n21.    By 1999, about 88 percent of the 206,187 trucks and 43,421 buses were owned by the\nprivate  sector.  The  rest  were  owned  and  operated  by  State-owned  transport  companies  and\nforeign  companies  or  foreign-assisted  projects  (Appendix  5).  While  progress  in  privatization\nlooks  significant,  a  competitive  environment  in  the  trucking  industry  is  yet  to  be  developed\nbecause  the  trucking  enterprises  sold  to  the  investment  funds  maintain  monopolies  in  many\nareas  through  either  their  regional  location  advantage  or  commodity-based  operations.  The\nmore  efficient  companies  are  trying  to  expand  and  compete  by  introducing  larger,  modern,\ndiesel-driven units in their fleet and scrapping the inefficient petrol-driven vehicles. However, the\nabsence  of  credit  facilities  due  to  the  fiscal  crisis  and  lack  of  proper  accounting  and\n\n9 The  two  projects  were  the  Small-Scale  Privatization  and  Enterprise  Support  Project  (1993)  and  the  Mass\n\n                  \n\nPrivatization Project (1995).\n\n\f6\n\nmanagement  practices  have  constrained  their  expansion  plans  and  the  development  of  a\ncompetitive market.\n\n22. \nThe  industry  is  also  suffering  because  of  a  sharp  fall  in  transport  demand  resulting  in\nsubstantial underutilization of trucks. In 1998, trucks typically traveled 5,000 km/year or only 20\npercent of the 1990 figure of 25,000 km/year, which is low, compared with a normal economic\nutilization of about 80,000-100,000 km/year.  For buses, the average annual utilization in 1998\nwas about 60,000-70,000 km/year, below the normal economic utilization level of about 80,000\nkm/year.\n\n \n\nv.\n\nRoad Revenues and Expenditures\n\nExtreme  shortage  of  funds  for  road  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  has  been  the  main\n23. \nreason for the poor state of Kazakhstan\u2019s roads. While funding in the early 1990s had amounted\nto about 570 million rubles ($350 million) annually,10 the allocation in 1998 was only about $130\nmillion equivalent, against a requirement of about $350 million equivalent for maintenance of the\nnational  and  regional  roads  alone.  The  funding  for  roads  is  provided  by  the  Road  Fund\nestablished through Decree No. 2701 on 21 December 199511 and managed by the Ministry of\nFinance,  and  is  supplemented  from  the  Government  budget  since  the  Road  Fund  collection\nalone has not been adequate. The Road Fund has been streamlined with the implementation of\nthe  following  short-term  recommendations  of  an  ADB-financed  study:12  (i) reducing  the\nenterprise  tax  (the  main  source  for  the  Road  Fund,  but  not  related  to  road  users)  from  0.5\npercent of the turnover to 0.2 percent; and (ii) moving the point of collection of the fuel tax from\nthe  retail  level  to  the  refinery/import  level.  These  measures  were  implemented  through\namendments to the Road Fund Act by the Parliament in May 1998. Collecting the fuel tax at the\nrefinery/import level increased the Road Fund collection for July-December 1998 to T2.3 billion,\ncompared with T240 million during the previous six months. Despite its severe fiscal constraints,\nthe  Government  is  committed  to  (i)  a  provision  of  annual  funding  for  maintenance  and\nrehabilitation  of  national  roads  amounting  to  about  $125  million  in  2000,  and  $150  million  in\n2001 and thereafter; and  (ii) a further review of road user charges and gradual increase of such\ncharges  for  trucks  and  buses  to  allow  75  percent  cost  recovery  by  September  2000  and  100\npercent cost recovery by September 2002.13\n\n2.\n\nThe Transport Sector in the Kyrgyz Republic\n\na.\n\nGeneral\n\n24.  \nIn  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  road  transport  dominates  the  transport  sector  in  providing\nservices to the country\u2019s remote areas.  The railways consist of two separate branch lines that\nlink the north of the country to the Kazakh rail system, and the south of the country to the Uzbek\nsystem,  with  no  direct  connection  between  the  two  links14  (see  Map).  In  1999,  road  transport\naccounted  for  about  three  fourths  of  freight  traffic  and  almost  the  entire  passenger  traffic.\nRailways carry the rest of the freight traffic. Rail passenger traffic is not significant, accounting\n\n                  \n\n10 $1 = 0.59 ruble in mid-1990.\n11 Initially, the Road Fund was sourced through  (i) 0.5 percent tax on the revenues of all enterprises, (ii) a tax of T3.0\nper liter on gasoline and diesel, and (iii) taxes on heavy vehicles (more than 10 tons) and international freight traffic\n(rates determined on case-to-case basis).\n\n12 TA 2631-KAZ: Institutional Strengthening of the Road Sector, for $750,000, approved on 27 August 1996.\n13 Covenanted under the World Bank\u2019s Road Transport Restructuring Project (para. 16).\n14 The  railway  link  between  Bishkek  and  Osh  is  a  low-priority  project,  given  the  country's  other  more  urgent  needs\n\nand the project\u2019s high cost (about $600 million).\n\n\f7\n\nfor  less  than  1  percent  of  passenger  movements,  mainly  on  the  Bishkek-Osh  route\n(Appendix 6). There is no water transport except for a few small vessels on Lake Yssyk-Kul.\n\n25.  \nThe transport demand reached its lowest level in 1995 as a result of the disruption of the\ncustomary  trading  patterns  of  the  FSU  era.  In  terms  of  ton-km,  the  freight  decreased  to  14\npercent of the 1990 level, and passenger movements to 33 percent. The end of the economic\ncontraction in 1995 resulted in a GDP growth of 9.9 percent in 1997. As a result, the demand for\nfreight and passenger transport in 1997 increased to 21 percent and 40 percent, respectively, of\nthe  1990  level.  However,  GDP  growth  slowed  down  in  1998  because  of    (i)  the  impact  of  the\neconomic  crisis  in  Russia,  (ii)  damage  to  the  infrastructure  caused  by  a  Fergana  Valley  flood,\nand (iii) a substantial reduction in tourism revenue caused by adverse publicity concerning the\ncyanide  spillover  in  Lake  Yssyk-Kul.  Accordingly,  the  transport  demand  for  freight  has\ndecreased in 1998 and 1999. Since most of the roads were designed for higher traffic capacities\nand are underutilized, the existing basic transport infrastructure is adequate for the current level\nof economic activity.  The primary concern, therefore, is proper maintenance and rehabilitation\nof the deteriorating infrastructure to preserve the previous investment, rather than expansion or\nmajor upgrading of the transport system.\n\nb.\n\nTransport Planning, Coordination, and Investment\n\nThe  Kyrgyz  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (KGZMOTC)  is  responsible  for\n26.  \npolicy,  regulation,  planning,  and  development  of  the  transport  and  communications  sectors  in\nthe Kyrgyz Republic. KGZMOTC currently performs its functions through 12 departments but is\nbeing restructured to 5 departments under the ongoing ADB-financed project15 (Appendix 7). In\naddition  to  reducing  the  number  of  departments,  the  restructuring  includes  (i)  divesting  the\nresponsibility  for  direct  operation  of  the  transportation  systems  through  a  program  of\nprivatization, and (ii) transferring all responsibilities relating to the road sector from the Vehicle\nInspection  Department  of  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  and  from  the  Ministry  of  Architecture\nand  Construction16  to  KGZMOTC  through  the  implementation  of  the  Automobile  Roads  Act  of\nMay  1998.  KGZMOTC  also  coordinates  the  activities  of  10  agencies,  which  are  at  various\nstages of corporatization and privatization.\n\n27.  \nAs in Kazakhstan, the 1998-2000 Public Investment Program prepared by the Ministry of\nFinance  provides  a  prioritized  summary  of  the  country's  investment  program  for  foreign\nassistance.  It  gives  high  priority  to  infrastructure  improvements,  including  rehabilitation  of  the\nBishkek-Osh  road,  redevelopment  of  the  Manas  international  airport,  modernization  of  the\ntelecommunications network, and upgrading and extension of the power transmission network.\nThe  public  investment  in  the  transport  sector  dropped  significantly  since  1990  from  about  2\npercent  of  GDP  to  near  zero  during  1995.  As  a  result  of  such  underinvestment,  transport\ninfrastructure  has  deteriorated  to  a  point  where  major  reconstruction  will  be  required  unless\nadequate  funds  are  allocated  for  adequate  maintenance.  Transport  investment  needs  a\nsubstantial increase to the level of about 4 percent of GDP to avoid major reconstruction in the\nfuture.  The  1998  and  1999  expenditures  in  the  transport  sector  were  respectively  Som751\nmillion (2.2 percent of GDP), and Som800 million (2.3 percent of GDP), of which Som273 million\nwas for roads.\n\n                  \n\n15 Loan 1630-KGZ(SF): Second Road Rehabilitation Project, for $50 million, approved on 10 September 1998.\n16  The  Vehicle  Inspection  Department  within  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  is  responsible  for  road  surveys  and\ninspection, traffic management and control, and road safety functions including vehicle registration and inspection.\nThe  Ministry  of  Architecture  and  Construction  is  responsible  for  developing  road  design  and  construction\nstandards.\n\n\f8\n\nc.\n\nThe Road and Road Transport Sector\n\ni.\n\nThe Road Network\n\nThe 18,876 km of roads under KGZMOTC and about 15,000 km of rural and farm roads\n28.  \noutside  its  jurisdiction  provide  road  network  links  to  all  six  regions  and  communities.  The\nKGZMOTC  roads  comprise  9,803  km  of  State  roads  and  9,073  km  of  local  roads.  About  40\npercent  of  the  State  roads  are  sealed,  some  with  gravel  mixed  with  bitumen  binder.  Over  50\npercent  is  gravel  roads,  and  less  than  10  percent  earth  roads.  About  60  percent  of  the\nKGZMOTC  roads  currently  require  periodic  maintenance  or  rehabilitation.  The  situation  is\nexpected  to  gradually  improve  as  the  road  maintenance  capacity  develops  and  more  money\nbecomes available through the Road Fund.  Most of the rural and farm roads were formerly the\nresponsibility of the State and collective farms. The responsibility for their maintenance is now\nwith  the  local  district  administrations  following  the  gradual  breakup  of  the  State  and  collective\nfarming system.\n\nii.\n\nSector Management\n\n29.  \nThe  main  responsibility  for  planning  and  administering  road  sector  policies,  programs,\nand projects is entrusted to KGZMOTC by the Automobile Roads Act. The Kyrgyz Department\nof Roads (KGZDOR) under KGZMOTC is responsible for management of the road sector and\ncarries  out  maintenance  of  roads  through  its  six  regional  road  maintenance  agencies,  which\ncontrol  the  operations  undertaken  by  38  local  maintenance  units  (LMUs)  for  State  roads.\nSimilarly,  33  LMUs  exist  for  maintenance  of  local  roads.  In  1998,  the  Directorate  General  for\nRehabilitation and Maintenance of the Bishkek-Osh Road, established through Decree No. 45 of\n4  March  1996  under  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister,  was  integrated  into  KGZDOR.  The\nmanagement  of  the  road  sector  will  be  streamlined  after  proper  structure,  systems,  and\nprocedures  have  been  established  in  KGZDOR  under  the  ongoing  ADB-financed  projects  and\nwhen  the  road-related  functions  are  transferred  from  the  Ministry  of  Architecture  and\nConstruction and Vehicle Inspection Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\nOther  important  agencies  in  the  road  sector  include  (i)  a  joint-stock  holding  company,\n30.  \ndesignated  as  Kyrgyzjoldoru  (Kyrgyz  Roads),  which  acts  as  an  umbrella  organization  for  52\nprivatized road construction entities; (ii) KyrgyzIntrans, a holding agency for six freight transport\ncompanies  and  forwarding  agencies  engaged  mainly  in  international  trade;  and  (iii)  technical\nagencies in various stages of divestment from KGZMOTC\u2019s control, including the Road Design\nInstitute (Kyrgyzdortranproect), a small agency responsible for developing and testing new road\nconstruction techniques and equipment (Kyrgyztranstekhnika), and a privatized training agency\nfor equipment operators.\n\n31.  \nThe Government's aim is to improve the efficiency of the road sector by commercializing\nand privatizing those construction and maintenance operations that are essentially commercial\nin nature. Where implementation with the help of private contractors is not feasible, particularly\nfor maintenance of roads in remote areas, the LMUs will carry out the maintenance works using\nequipment owned by KGZMOTC.\n\niii.\n\nTraffic and Vehicle Fleet\n\n32.  \nThe  AADT  on  one  of  the  busy  main  roads  in  the  vicinity  of  Bishkek  typically  is  about\n13,200 vehicles. Traffic on the Bishkek-Osh road away from the large towns varies between 600\n\n\f9\n\nand 900 AADT, with large trucks accounting for more than 50 percent. The current traffic levels\nare  generally  well  below  the  design  capacities  of  the  roads.  Seasonal  variations,  reflecting\nchanges in transport demand and weather-related constraints, are significant on roads crossing\nthe  central  mountainous  areas  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Considering  the  need  to  preserve  the\nintegrity  of  the  past  investments,  the  Government  is  giving  high  priority  to  rehabilitation  and\nproper maintenance of the existing road networks.\n\n33.  \nThe  country's  1999  vehicle  fleet  comprised  44,300  trucks,  11,500  buses,  and  178,500\ncars. About 95 percent of the cars are privately owned. Previously, most trucks and buses were\nowned and operated by State organizations. Following the privatization program and auctions,\n26 percent of the trucks and 23 percent of the buses are now owned by individuals. The balance\nare  owned  and  operated  by  transport  companies.  The  majority  of  the  fleet  is  still  made  up  of\nvehicles  manufactured  in  the  FSU.  A  few  modern  buses  have  been  procured  under  bilateral\narrangements  and  assigned  to  selected  bus  companies.  Some  trucking  companies  have\nprocured  secondhand  trucks  of  larger  capacity  and  more  modern  design,  mainly  for  use  on\ntransnational  routes.  A  significant  number  of  cars,  most  of  them  secondhand,  are  being\nimported privately from West Europe.\n\n34.  While the number of cars has fallen marginally because of the reduction in cars owned\nby  Government  departments  and  the  contraction  of  the  economy,  the  number  of  trucks  has\nincreased slightly since 1990 and the number of buses has been stable. The fleet, however, is\naging, since few companies have been in a position to buy modern vehicles. In 1999, more than\n70 percent of the truck fleet was between 7 and 12 years old and over half was with capacities\nof less than 7 tons. Only about 5 percent of the fleet had a capacity of 15 tons or more.\n\niv.\n\nRoad Transport Industry\n\n35.  \nThe  Kyrgyz  Auto  Transport,  a  joint-stock  holding  company  controlling  transport\ncompanies,  was  abolished  by  Decree  No.  61  in  1994  when  the  Department  of  Transport  was\nestablished within KGZMOTC. As a result of the restructuring, there are currently 89 transport\ncompanies operating trucks and buses. All of them have been privatized except for urban bus\nenterprises in major cities and some enterprises connected with State security.\n\n36.   \nAs a result of measures that the Government introduced in 1994 to increase competition,\nthe  national  and  provincial  holding  companies  and  associations  (which  had  continued  to\nexercise control over the operations of individual transport companies) were abolished and the\nGovernment\u2019s shareholding in companies reduced through the auction of surplus vehicles and\nassets to private bidders. While the privatized transport companies have financial autonomy, the\nprivatization is far from success.  At the present levels of demand resulting in low utilization of\ntrucks  (comparable  with  Kazakhstan,  para.  22),  few  companies  are  commercially  profitable.\nMost companies cover only their short-term operating costs and do not provide for depreciation\nand  fleet  replacement.  Some  companies  supplement  their  income  from  the  sale  of  older\nvehicles, while others lay off staff or rent vehicles to their drivers on a monthly basis for some\nbusiness.  Few  appear  to  have  access  to  conventional  credit  arrangements  and  knowledge  of\ncommercial business practices to sustain their businesses.\n\n37.     Freight transport customers are free to negotiate conditions in terms of price and quality\nof  service  directly  with  the  operators.  The  role  of  the  Department  of  Transport  is  limited  to\nmonitoring  and  regulating,  including  licensing,  inspection,  and  safety  audit.  Freight  forwarders\nare encouraged to negotiate and arrange intermodal transport services, thus facilitating door-to-\ndoor transport arrangements, and to offer services directly themselves. For passenger transport,\n\n\f10\n\nthe route allocation mostly is on the basis of the lowest offered cost of operation since most of the\nroutes are currently not commercially viable for route-license bidding.\n\nv.\n\nRoad Revenues and Expenditures\n\n38. \nThe  Government  expenditure  in  the  road  sector,  funded  by  allocations  from  the  State\nbudget,  is  inadequate.  Against  an  annual  requirement  for  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  of\nroads  estimated  at  about  Som1  billion,  the  amount  actually  made  available  in  1998  was  only\nSom270  million,  including  disbursements  from  the  ADB-financed  Road  Rehabilitation  Project\n(footnote 3). Considering the severe funding constraints and following the recommendations of\nthe  ADB-financed  study  to  improve  road  sector  revenues  to  maintain  and  operate  the  road\nnetwork,17  the  Government  established  the  Road  Fund  by  enacting  the  Road  Fund  Act  on  1\nJune 1998.18 The Road Fund is based on the road-user principle, removing the earlier system of\ncollecting taxes for road works that were in no way related to the use of the roads.19 The Road\nFund  is  expected  to  cover  the  funding  for  the  implementation  of  maintenance  by  contract,  in\ncase of a shortfall, the Government will make additional funds available from the budget.20\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n1.  \n\nKazakhstan\n\n39. \nThe Government's overall strategic objectives for the transport sector are (i) ensuring the\nprovision  and  maintenance  of  adequate  transport  infrastructure  to  support  the  transition  to  a\nmarket-based  economy,  (ii)  promoting  competition  while  addressing  safety  and  environmental\nconcerns, and (iii) increasing cost recovery. These objectives are pursued by (i) increasing the\nfinancial provisions for rehabilitation and maintenance of the road network; (ii) privatizing road\ntransport operations and dismantling licensing controls that hinder competition; (iii) promoting, in\ncollaboration  with  neighboring  countries,  the  most  efficient  means  of  transport  for  large  loads\nover  long  distances;  (iv)  privatizing  inland  waterway  transport;  (v)  improving  the  civil  aviation\ninfrastructure  and  supporting  services  that  encourage  operations  by  foreign  and  local  airlines;\nand (vi) increasing sector revenues through appropriate pricing and taxation.\n\n40. \nThe  Government's  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  includes  reforms  in  the  overall  social\nassistance and pension systems, the development of labor market programs, and the creation\nof  employment  opportunities.  Transport  sector  investments,  such  as  road  rehabilitation,\nenhance the possibilities for labor force participation (for both skilled and unskilled jobs) by the\nunemployed  population  during  the  construction  and  maintenance  phases.  The  Government\nstrategy includes labor-intensive methods of construction at places where they are feasible. The\nscope for the development of small individual businesses and enterprises, especially in the rural\nareas, is enhanced by accessibility as the demand for additional goods and services increases.\n\n                  \n\n17 TA 2587-KGZ: Institutional Strengthening of the Road Sector, for $800,000, approved on 13 June 1996.\n18 The main sources of the Road Fund include 50 percent of the excise tax  ($45 per ton on gasoline and $25 per ton\non  diesel),  annual  road  user  charges  (vehicle  tax  depending  on  the  size  of  the  vehicle),  vehicle  registration\ncharges, and budgetary allocations.\n\n19 The main source was 0.8 percent tax on the gross revenue of all enterprises, excluding road transport enterprises,\n\nwhich paid a 2 percent tax on gross revenue.\n\n20 Covenanted under Loan 1630-KGZ(SF) (footnote 15).\n\n\f11\n\n2. \n\nThe Kyrgyz Republic\n\n41.  \nThe  Government's  transport  sector  strategy  and  plans  are  included  in  the  Public\nInvestment Program prepared by the Ministry of Finance as well as in the Transport and Road\nSector  Policy  Statement  issued  by  KGZMOTC  on  15  October  1997.21  As  in  Kazakhstan,  the\nGovernment's overall strategic objectives for the transport sector are (i) adequately maintaining\ntransport  infrastructure  to  support  reform  of  the  economy;  (ii)  privatizing  transport  operations\nand  promoting  competition  among  operators,  while  addressing  safety  and  environmental\nconcerns;  and  (iii)  increasing  cost  recovery  from  users  of  the  transport  infrastructure.  The\nmeasures  to  achieve  these  objectives  include  (i)  increasing  the  financial  provision  for\nrehabilitation and maintenance of the road network; (ii) consolidating road sector responsibilities\nunder  KGZMOTC;  (iii)  promoting  private  sector  participation  in  road  maintenance;  (iv)\ncompleting the privatization of road transport operations and dismantling the licensing controls,\nwhich  hinder  competition;  (v)  promoting,  in  collaboration  with  the  neighboring  countries,  rail\ntransport  as  the  most  efficient  means  of  transporting  bulk  loads  over  long  distances;  (vi)\nprivatizing lake shipping services; (vii) promoting the civil aviation infrastructure and supporting\nservices  that  encourage  foreign  and  local  airline  operations;  and  (viii)  increasing  sector\nrevenues through appropriate pricing and taxation.\n\n42. \nThe  Government  declared  1998  as  the  year  of  poverty  reduction,  and  initiated  the\nformulation  of  a  national  poverty  reduction  strategy  (Araket).  The  Araket  program  entails  a\nnumber  of  measures  to  strengthen  the  national  labor  market,  reduce  unemployment,  support\nemployment  creation  activities,  and  provide  microcredit  schemes. \nthe\nGovernment  is  taking  measures  to  attract  significant  investments  in  the  national  economy  to\ncreate  additional  job  opportunities.  Ongoing  transport  projects  in  the  country  (e.g.,  ADB-\nfinanced road rehabilitation projects) have helped generate employment for poor people both in\nthe construction and maintenance works.\n\nthis  regard, \n\nIn \n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sectors\n\n43.  \nDuring  the  FSU  era,  no  external  assistance  was  provided  to  the  road  sector  and  road\nnetworks  were  built  by  mobilizing  the  country\u2019s  resources  with  limited  economic  and  cost\nrecovery  considerations.  Since  independence  in  1991,  both  Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz\nRepublic have been actively mobilizing external assistance and have benefited from a number\nof  country-specific  as  well  as  regional  projects.  The  latter  have  included  several  regional  TAs\nfrom  ADB,22  as  well  as  TAs  provided  by  the  European  Union  (EU)  to  eight  FSU  countries,\nincluding Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, in the areas of (i) standards and specifications\nfor  construction  materials  and  plants,  (ii)  winter  maintenance,  (iii)  road  pavement  and  bridge\ntesting, and (iv) prefeasibility studies for road and rail links (e.g., between Osh and Kashgar in\nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  and  Issyk-Kul  and  Kashgar).  To  ensure  complementarity  with\noperations  of  the  World  Bank  and  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  the\nproposed Project has been designed in close coordination with these institutions (paras. 44, 45\nand 53).\n\n                  \n\n21  Prepared under TA 2587-KGZ (footnote 17).\n22  TA  5620-REG: Regional Initiatives in Road Safety,  for  $600,000,  approved  on  4  January  1995;  TA  5707-REG:\nRegional Economic Cooperation in Central Asia, for $1,150,000, approved on 8 November 1996; TA 5733-REG: A\nReview of Road Design and Construction Standards, for $600,000, approved on 3 April 1997; and TA 5818-REG:\nRegional Economic Cooperation in Central Asia (Phase II), for $1,350,000, approved on 11 December 1998.\n\n\f12\n\n1.\n\nKazakhstan\n\n44.  \nKazakhstan  has  been  successful  in  mobilizing  external  assistance  to  develop  its  road\nsector.  The  ongoing  projects  include  ADB\u2019s  Road Rehabilitation Project,23  the  World  Bank\u2019s\nRoad Transport Restructuring Project  ($84  million),  and  Islamic  Development  Bank\u2019s  (IDB\u2019s)\nSaryshagan-Gulshad Road Project ($10 million), which complement each other in rehabilitating\nthe Almaty-Astana road (1,260 km) and establishing the related road maintenance system. ADB\nhas  also  provided  three  TA  grants  in  the  amount  of  $1.6  million.24  The  Japan  International\nCooperation  Agency  and  JBIC  are  carrying  out  feasibility  studies  for  rehabilitation  of  road\nsections in the western provinces of Kazakhstan and for reconstruction of a bridge over Irtysh\nRiver, respectively. The World Bank is also assisting in the urban transport subsector through its\nUrban Transport Project  ($40  million).  Assistance  to  the  civil  aviation  and  railways  sectors\ncovers  the  Astana  airport  and  Druzhba-Aktogoj  railway  projects  financed  by  JBIC,  and  the\nAlmaty-Astana  railway  project  funded  by  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and\nDevelopment (EBRD).\n\n2.\n\nThe Kyrgyz Republic\n\n45.  \nADB\u2019s first and second loans of $50 million each, with cofinancing of about $28 million\nand  $41  million,  respectively,  from  JBIC,  have  helped  the  Government  rehabilitate  part  of  the\nBishkek-Osh  road.25    In  addition,  ADB  has  provided  five  TA  grants  totaling  $3.2  million  to  the\nroad sector.26 The World Bank approved a $22 million loan for the Urban Transport Project  in\nAugust  2000  to  rehabilitate  urban  roads  in  Bishkek,  Djabal-Abad,  and  Osh.  IDB  approved  $9\nmillion in 1998 to rehabilitate 49 km of the southern part of the Bishkek-Osh road and provided\ngrant  assistance  for  a  feasibility  study  for  the  rehabilitation  of  a  section  of  the  Bishkek-Naryn-\nTorugart  road.  In  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  too,  ADB,  JBIC,  and  IDB  complement  each  other  in  an\neffort to rehabilitate the Bishkek-Osh road, the most important road corridor of the country.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n46. \nFor  the  road  sector  in  the  CARs,  ADB\u2019s  focus  has  been  on  policy  reforms  to  meet  the\nchanging market demands, develop institutions capable of effective planning and management,\nensure  adequate  financing  of  road  maintenance  (particularly  through  road-user  charges),  and\npromote private sector participation. The most important lessons that have been learned to date\nconcern (i) the development of competitive markets; (ii) implementation of a road fund, and (iii)\nimproving road sector efficiency on a regional basis.\n\n47.  \nThe development of competitive markets in the transport industry after the sale of State-\nowned  property  in  the  early  1990s  has  been  a  difficult  process,  particularly  with  regard  to  the\nintroduction  of  market-friendly  systems  and  policies,  delegation  of  authority  to  take  decisions,\ndevelopment  of  institutional  capacity,  and  undertaking  complementary  reforms  to  support  the\nsystems.  Competitive  markets  need  a  conducive  environment.  The  road  departments  have\nneither  adequate  capacity  nor  a  full  understanding  of  the  functioning  of  competitive  markets.\n\n                  \n\n23 Loan 1455-KAZ: Road Rehabilitation Project, for $50 million, approved on 27 August 1996.\n24 TA 2258-KAZ: Preparation of Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 11 January 1995; TA 2631-\n\nKAZ (footnote 12); and TA 2632-KAZ (footnote 2).\n\n25 Loan 1444-KGZ (footnote 3); and Loan 1630-KGZ (footnote 15).\n26  TA  2256-KGZ:  Road Rehabilitation Project,  for  $600,000,  approved  on  21  December  1994;  TA  2587-KGZ\n(footnote 17);  TA  2760-KGZ: Second Road Rehabilitation Project,  for  $600,000,  approved  on  11  February  1997;\nTA  3065-KGZ: Policy Support in the Transport Sector, for  $600,000,  approved  on  10  September  1998;  and  TA\n3335-KGZ: Third Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 10 December 1999.\n\n\f13\n\nCosting  and  pricing  procedures  based  on  local  norms,  without  accurately  reflecting  actual  cost,\nhas been a hindrance to the introduction of competitive bidding. The existing FSU road standards\nare  not  suitable  for  operation  in  a  market  environment  because  of  the  tendency  to  regulate\nparameters  that  are  the  prerogative  of  contractors.  As  a  result,  the  award  of  civil  works  in  the\nCARs is often done by directly appointing the contractors and paying them based on local norms.\nADB\u2019s regional TA 5733-REG (footnote 22) for the preparation of road design and construction\nstandards incorporating Western practices to help implement road works based on competitive\nbidding  has  been  much  appreciated,27  but  the  standards  are  yet  to  be  fully  adopted.  The  two\nGovernments have agreed to do so effective 1 January 2002 [see para. 127 (vi) (e)].\n\n48.  \nThe implementation of a road fund in the CARs is yet to bring the expected benefits in\nterms of improved road maintenance and increased involvement of road users. While the road\nfunds  in  Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  have  been  redesigned  to  generate  revenues\nmainly  from  sources  that  are  closely  related  to  road  use,  the  concept  that  road-user  costs\ngenerally dominate the cost pattern of road use (and therefore, it is economical to spend more on\nroad  maintenance)  is  yet  to  be  accepted  and  implemented.  Also,  road  ownership  is  yet  to  be\nestablished by involving road users and other stake-holders such as the road transport industry,\ninsurance, contractors, and consultants (e.g., by creating independent road agencies with boards\nof directors that include representatives of such stakeholders).\n\nImproving  road  sector  efficiency  on  a  regional  basis,  including  implementation  of  road\n49.   \nsafety  measures,  needs  to  be  given  priority.  While  the  ongoing  road  project  focuses  on\nimprovement of the national institutional capacity and competitive markets, the development of\nregional  transport  networks  for  regional  economic  cooperation  by  improving  efficiency  and\nsafety  of  the  regional  road  links  is  important  for  landlocked  CARs.  The  development  of\ncompetitive markets, the creation of road sector institutions involving the road users, and regional\ncooperation  are  a  long-term  process  that  needs  to  be  implemented  in  a  staged  manner.    The\nproposed  Project  and  the  ongoing  projects  in  the  road  sector  financed  by  ADB  and  the  World\nBank support these processes.\n\nE.\n\nADB's Operational and Sector Strategies\n\nThe main objective of ADB's operation strategy in the CARs is to facilitate the countries\u2019\n50. \ntransition  to  a  market  economy.  This  objective  entails  (i)  supporting  the  countries\u2019  reform\nagenda  and  strengthening  their  development  management,  (ii)  promoting  the  rehabilitation  of\nthe  environmental  resource  base,  (iii)  strengthening  the  long-term  potential  by  investing  in\nphysical infrastructure and human resources development, and (iv) encouraging the creation of\na  new  structure  of  output  and  new  production  capacity  through  private  sector  investment  and\njob creation.\n\n51.    ADB  focuses  its  assistance  program  for  Kazakhstan  on  a  few  priority  sectors  and\nsubsectors:  (i)  management  and  reform  at  the  central  and  local  government  levels;\n(ii) infrastructure,  especially  rehabilitation  projects;  (iii)  education  and  training;  (iv)  industry,\nfocusing  on  the  problems  of  medium-size  enterprises;  and  (v)  agriculture.  In  the  Kyrgyz\nRepublic, to maximize the impact of ADB\u2019s limited resources, ADB\u2019s operation strategy focuses\non  (i)  improvements  in  the  provision  of  public  services;  (ii)  agriculture,  including  rural  finance;\ninfrastructure,  especially\n(iii)  human  resource  development,  especially  education;  (iv) \n\n                  \n\n27  In  addition  to  directly  benefiting  Kazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia,  and  Uzbekistan,  the  road  design\n\nstandards have been distributed to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.\n\n\f14\n\nrehabilitation  projects  to  preserve  the  economic  utility  of  the  past  investment  in  the  road  and\nenergy sectors; and (v) restructuring of the financial sector.\n \n52.    ADB's transport sector strategies in the two countries envisage support for (i) developing\nan  efficient  policy  and  regulatory  framework;  (ii)  corporatizing/commercializing  and,  where\nappropriate,  privatizing  road  transport  operations  and  entities;  (iii)  restructuring  Government\norganizations  so  that  they  can  respond  efficiently  to  market  demands;  (iv)  creating  an\nenvironment  that  encourages  private  sector  participation;  (v)  promoting  competition  in  the\nprovision  and  operation  of  facilities  and  services;  (vi)  increasing  funding  by  improving  tax  and\nduties  collection,  enhancing  cost  recovery,  and  removing  subsidy-induced  distortions  in  the\npricing of services; (vii) rehabilitating road infrastructure and improving maintenance operations\nand  safety  standards  of  infrastructure  facilities;  (viii)  developing  human  resources;  and\n(ix) protecting the environment by improving the environmental standards.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nReforms  in  the  Kazakh  and  Kyrgyz  road  sectors  in  the  areas  of  policy  and  regulatory\n53.  \nframework,  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  development,  road  funding  and  cost\nrecovery, and road safety and maintenance are supported by the ongoing projects. As shown in\nAppendix 8, the policy issues discussed and agreed upon with the Governments during project\nprocessing strengthen and complement the earlier initiatives and provide a regional focus. The\nregional  issues  include    (i)  streamlining  the  cross-border  road  transport  and  customs  policies,\nregulations,  and  documentation;  (iii)  improving  coordination  and  management  of  road  safety,\nand  (iv)  introducing  road  maintenance  by  contract.  In  addition,  the  dialogue  has  covered\nassistance to KAZMOTC to help define its functions and sector objectives, given the institutional\ndislocation  and  structural  and  staff  changes  due  to  the  transfer  of  the  capital  from  Almaty  to\nAstana.\n\n1. \n\nCross-Border Policy and Regulatory Issues\n\n54.  \nTo  facilitate  regional  economic  cooperation,  both  Governments  recognize  the  need  for\nremoving  the  various  physical  and  nonphysical  cross-border  barriers.  For  this  purpose,  the\nCross-Border  Agreement  (CBA)  drafted  with  the  help  of  ADB  to  regulate  and  ease  the\nmovement  of  people,  goods,  and  vehicles  across  the  common  border  was  signed  by  the\nGovernments of Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic on 15 November 199928 and will become\neffective and binding to both countries (see para. 128). In addition to cross-border issues, the\nCBA stipulates weights and dimensions of vehicles to bring them in line with the axle-load limits\nin  the Public Motor Roads: Design Standards and Regulations prepared  under  TA  5733-REG\n(footnote 22).\n\n55.  \nSupport  for  the  timely  implementation  of  the  CBA  provisions  will  be  provided  with  the\nhelp of two advisory TAs processed in conjunction with the Project. The TAs will help (i) review\nall  existing  customs  and  transport  documentation,  and  introduce  changes  in  line  with  the\nprovisions in the CBA; (ii) introduce proper customs procedures at the Kazakh/Kyrgyz (Akzhol-\nChu)  border  at  Georgievka;  and  (iii)  train  staff  in  Transport  International  Routier  (TIR)  Carnet\nprocessing,29  vehicle  inspection  and  clearance  procedures,  the  use  of  risk  assessment\n\n                  \n\n28 The CBA signed on 15 November 1999 excluded exemption of import/export duties and taxes on transit traffic. As\nagreed during loan negotiations, an amendment to CBA that deals with exemption to transit traffic will be signed by\nthe two Governments by 25 October 2000.\n\n29 TIR Carnet is an international road transport logbook for international freight transporters.\n\n\f15\n\ntechniques,  and  the  use  of  computers  for  customs  clearance.  Equipment  required  for  the\nAutomated Customs Clearance System (ACCS) and training in the use of such equipment will\nbe  provided  by  EU\u2019s  Transport  Corridor  Europe  Caucasus  Asia  (TRACECA)  project.  The\nintroduction  of  the  ACCS  and  computerized  cargo  registration  will  be  implemented  as  a  pilot\nprogram  to  permit  international  electronic  data  processing  and  possible  external  input  through\ndirect trader input linkages. The introduction of the revised procedures and computerized ACCS\nwill  make  the  system  transparent  and  will  remove  nonphysical  customs  barriers,  including\nunauthorized payments, at the Akzhol-Chu border now and at other border crossings later. This\nis  expected  to  give  impetus  to  an  overall  reform  of  the  customs  departments  in  the  two\ncountries.\n\n2. \n\nRoad Safety\n\n56.  \nRoad  safety  is  a  multidimensional  social  problem  involving  many  sectors:  education,\nhealth, police, and transport as well as the private sector involved in insurance, fuel supply, and\nbus and freight transport operations. The activities have to be complementary and coordinated\nso that road safety measures can be optimized to avoid loss of resources on account of vehicle\ndamage,  medical  treatment,  police  and  administration  costs,  and  damage  to  road  facilities.\nSuch  coordination  of,  and  participation  by,  the  stakeholders  can  be  achieved  through  the\nestablishment  of  national  road  safety  council  (NRSC).    While  the  issues  in  preparing  safety\naction plans, improving collection and processing of road accident data, and developing better\nunderstanding  of  road  safety  problems  have  been  addressed  by  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Road\nTransport  Restructuring  Project  (para.  16) \nfor  Kazakhstan  and  ADB\u2019s  Second  Road\nRehabilitation Project (footnote 15) for the Kyrgyz Republic, the establishment of the NRSC in\nthe Kyrgyz Republic and updating of the road safety acts (RSAs) of both the countries will help\nstrengthen regional coordination and expedite the implementation of  the road safety initiatives.\n\n57.   While  an  Interdepartmental  Commission  of  Road  Safety  exists  in  Kazakhstan,30  the\nGovernment  of  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  agreed  to  establish  the  NRSC  by  1  January  2002  with  a\nfull-time  secretariat  to  coordinate  road  safety  activities  and  involve  the  various  stakeholders\n[para. 127 (vi) (a)]. The RSAs will be updated for submission to the Parliaments by 1 June 2002\n[para. 127 (vi) (b)]. The RSAs will include legislation concerning safe driving, safety audit of road\ndesigns, safety education, road safety publicity, vehicle safety standards, road safety research,\nand  emergency  assistance  to  accident  victims.  In  addition,  the  RSAs  will  include  legal\nprovisions  regarding  the  responsibility  of  road  maintenance  contractors  for  environmental  and\nsocial  impact  mitigation  measures  and  road  safety-related  works  (e.g.,  signposts,  road\nmarkings, etc.), and liabilities in case the contractors fail to undertake/maintain such measures\nand works. The two advisory TAs will help the Governments in establishing the NRSC, updating\nthe  RSAs,  preparing  a  Russian  version  of  the Road Safety Guidelines,31  and  conducting  road\nsafety seminars to implement the Road Safety Guidelines.\n\n3. \n\nRoad Maintenance\n\nAn  equipment  pool  will  be  established  in  Kazakhstan  with  the  help  of  the  consultants\n58.  \nunder  the  ADB  loan.32  The  pool,  a  State-owned  joint-stock  company,  will  manage  and  lease\nequipment  for  maintaining  the  Almaty-Astana  and  Almaty-Bishkek  roads.  Depending  on\n\n                  \n\n30 Established by Government Decree No. 391 dated 28 April 1998.\n31 Prepared under TA 5620-REG (footnote 22).\n32  Such  equipment  pool  is  being  established  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  under  the Second Road Rehabilitation Project\n\n(footnote 15).\n\n\f16\n\navailability,  the  pool  may  also  rent  out  the  equipment  on  a  commercial  basis  for  other\nconstruction  and  maintenance  works  to  ensure  its  effective  utilization  and  adequate  return  on\nthe  investment.  The  equipment  will  also  be  rented  out  to  private  contractors  to  help  them\ncompete  for  road  construction  and  maintenance  works.    The  concept  will  subsequently  be\nextended to other parts of the country. The equipment pool is expected to be operational from\n30 June 2002 [para. 127 (vi) (c)].\n\n59.  \nThe  ADB-financed  consultants  will  help  establish  the  equipment  hire  system,  and  the\nrelated  servicing  and  repair  workshop,  and  will  provide  guidance  and  on-the-job  training  to\nequipment  operators,  workshop  mechanics,  and  the  foreman.  The  equipment  hire  system  will\nincorporate proper accounting, equipment hiring and maintenance procedures, and appropriate\nprovisions for depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses.\n\n60.  \nExperience gained in other countries (particularly in the Philippines) shows that contracts\nconsisting  only  of  routine  maintenance  works  are  less  attractive  to  construction  contractors\nbecause  of  the  need  for  a  large  resource  commitment  (e.g.,  equipment)  to  undertake  a\ncomparatively small amount of work spread over long distances. The proposed concept of road\nmaintenance  by  contract  will  focus  on  creating  an  environment  conducive  to  local  contractors\u2019\nparticipation  in  maintenance  works  by  hiring  equipment  from  the  pool.  A  maintenance  manual\nand contracts must be prepared, and both government supervisors and respective contractors\ntrained before road maintenance by contract is implemented. There are several advantages to\nthis  approach:  separation  of  the  planning  and  supervision  functions  from  the  implementation\nfunctions, execution of road maintenance under a proper contract, local employment generation,\neffective  equipment  management,  private  sector  development,  and  better  maintenance  of\nroads.  While  the  Maintenance  Operation  Manual  is  being  prepared  under  the  ongoing  Road\nRehabilitation  Project  (footnote  23),  the  design  and  construction  supervision  consultants\nengaged  under  the  proposed  Project  will  establish  equipment  leasing  system,  prepare  the\ncontracts  and  train  the  maintenance  supervision  staff  and  local  contractors.  The  two\nGovernments  have  agreed  to  award  maintenance  contracts  for  the  Almaty-Bishkek  road  on  a\ncompetitive bidding basis from 1 January 2005 [para. 127 (vi) (d)].\n\n4. \n\nAdvisory Support to  KAZMOTC\n\n61.  \nIn view of the ongoing reform process in the road sector institutions and the institutional\ndislocation  and  structural  and  staff  changes  due  to  the  transfer  of  the  capital  from  Almaty  to\nAstana,  the  Government  of  Kazakhstan  has  requested  ADB  assistance  to  help  KAZMOTC\nstreamline  the  functions  and  responsibilities  of  CRRT  and  Kazakhavtodor  in  line  with  the\npolicies  adopted  under  the  Road  Sector  Policy  Statement  of  31  March  1996.  Under  the\nproposed advisory TA, a transport adviser will be engaged for transport policy review, transport\nplanning,  regulations,  pricing,  procurement,  and  preparation  of  a  three-year  national  transport\ninvestment plan.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n62. \nThe rehabilitation of the Almaty-Bishkek road is an integral component of ADB\u2019s strategy\nin Central Asia to promote economic growth and reduce poverty.  A transport link such as the\nAlmaty-Bishkek road, free of physical and human-made barriers, will contribute to bringing the\nseparated  and  isolated  domestic  markets  in  each  country  into  one  integrated  regional  market.\nto  exploit  economies  of  scale  and  resource\nThis, \n\nturn,  will  allow \n\nthe  countries \n\nin \n\n\f17\n\ncomplementarities.  Conversely, without such an integrated market, these countries are likely to\nsuffer  from  lower  growth  and  slower  poverty  reduction  because  of  their  isolated  geographic\nlocation  and  limited  potentials  for  domestic  market  expansion.    The  increase  in  economic\nactivities due to the improved road will have a general positive impact on poverty reduction in\nthe  region.    More  specifically,  since  the  road  goes  through,  or  is  adjacent  to,  some  of  the\npoorest  areas  of  the  two  countries,  the  improved  road  efficiency  will  contribute  to  poverty\nreduction in the area through better and more reliable access to the economic mainstream.\n\nThe Almaty-Bishkek road is at a cross-link between the road corridors that connect the\n63.  \nFar East with Europe and Fergana Valley with Russia. While it is part of the east-west corridor\npassing  through  Urumqui  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  the  state  capitals  and\nmost  commercial  centers  in  the  CARs  such  as  Almaty,  Bishkek,  Shymkent,  Tashkent,\nSamarkand and Ashgabat, the Almaty-Bishkek road also links two important north-south roads,\nnamely,  Almaty-Astana  and  Bishkek-Osh.  Improvement  of  these  two  north-south  roads  has\nbeen given high priority by both Governments and is supported by ADB, World Bank, JBIC and\nIDB  (see  Map).  The  Almaty-Bishkek  road  is  a  crucial  section  that  requires  rehabilitation  to\npermit  smooth  and  safe  international  and  regional  traffic  flow  in  all  seasons,  thus  fostering\nregional economic cooperation.\n\n64.  \nThe  Almaty-Bishkek  road is an important conduit for imports and exports of the CARs.\nBishkek  is  the  main  import  center  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  major  imports  transported  by\nroad  are  consumer  goods,  foodstuff,  beverages  and  machinery  from  Europe,  timber  from\nRussia, and lower value consumer goods (such as garments) from the PRC. The road is also an\nimportant conduit for imports to Kazakhstan, including Kyrgyz agricultural products and cement.\nIn  general,  the  project  road  is  an  important  link  for  the  transport  of  agricultural  and  industrial\ngoods in the region, including transit traffic to the PRC (e.g., cotton from Uzbekistan).\n\n65. \n Economic  reform and  political realignment in Central Asia, and the emergence of free\ntrade  areas  and  custom  unions  underline  the  need  for  an  efficient  transport  system  and\nharmonization of trade and transport regulations. The former is one of the basic prerequisites for\nthe  future  economic  development  of  Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  considering  their\nlandlocked  character.  Regarding  the  latter,  efforts  to  streamline  the  international  trade  and\ncustoms issues and harmonize the regulations\u2013which have started with the help of the United\nNations  Conference  on  Trade  and  Development  (UNCTAD),  EU,  Economic  Cooperation\nOrganization (ECO), and the Customs Union\u2013have to continue.33 While the rehabilitation of road\ninfrastructure will result in savings in vehicle operation costs (VOCs), the transport efficiency of\nan  important  regional  road  link  such  as  the  Almaty-Bishkek  road  will  also  depend  on  the\nremoval  of  physical  and  nonphysical  cross-border  barriers,  improved  coordination  and\nmanagement of road safety initiatives, and adequate road maintenance. The proposed Project\naims  at  achieving  all  these  objectives,  with  a  view  to  subsequently  extending  the  concept  to\nother cross-border links in the region.\n\n66.  \nADB\u2019s  TA  5707-REG  (footnote  22)  confirmed  that  the  Almaty-Bishkek  road  is  a  critical\nsection requiring improvement to permit smooth and safe traffic flow in all seasons. Almaty, the\ncapital of Kazakhstan until 1997, is the largest city and a key center of finance, commerce, and\nindustry  such  as  textiles  and  canned  goods  plants,  while  Bishkek  is  the  capital  of  the  Kyrgyz\n\n                  \n\n33  The three important agreements are ECO Transit Transport Agreement prepared with the help of UNCTAD; Multi-\nLateral Agreement prepared with the help of EU; and Agreement Between the People\u2019s Republic of China, Kyrgyz\nRepublic, and Uzbekistan on International Road Traffic, signed by the three countries.\n\n\f18\n\nRepublic. Both Governments have given priority to the rehabilitation of the road linking Almaty\nwith Bishkek.\n\n67.   \nThere  is  a  high  incidence  of  road  accidents  in  Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,\nresulting  in  an  annual  rate  of  30  fatalities  per  10,000  vehicles.  In  1996,  110  accidents  on  the\nKazakh section of the Almaty-Bishkek road left 50 persons dead and 120 with serious injuries.\nAlthough no data are available to assess the related road accident costs, it can be assumed that\nat least 1 percent of GDP is lost annually through road accidents.34 Well-coordinated road safety\nprograms at both regional and national levels are therefore essential.\n\nB. \n\nObjective and Scope\n\nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  safety  of  the  principal\n68.  \nsubregional  road  transport  link  between  Almaty  and  Bishkek  by  rehabilitating  the  road\ninfrastructure,  modernizing  border  control  policies  and  procedures,  upgrading  cross-border\nfacilities,  improving  the  coordination  and  management  of  road  safety,  and  introducing  an\nefficient road maintenance system.\n\n69.   \nThe  Project  comprises  (i)  rehabilitation  of  about  245  km  of  the  Almaty-Bishkek  road,\nincluding  consulting  services  for  design  and  construction  supervision;  (ii)  improvement  of\ncustoms  facilities  at  the  Akzhol-Chu  border;  and  (iii)  road  maintenance  equipment  for\nKazakhstan.  The  associated  advisory  TAs  will  help  implement  the  CBA  and  road  safety\ninitiatives in both countries, and will provide transport advisory support to KAZMOTC.\n\nC.\n\nTechnical Justification\n\n70. \nThe Project will rehabilitate about 204 km of the road from the Almaty City boundary to\nthe Akzhol-Chu border at Georgievka and about 41 km in the Kyrgyz Republic consisting of a 17\nkm  section  from  the  Akzhol-Chu  border  to  the  Bishkek  City  boundary  and  a  24  km  bypass\ninterconnecting  the  Bishkek-Akzhol-Chu  border  road  with  the  Bishkek-Osh  road.  Much  of  the\nroad between Almaty and Bishkek was completed 20-25 years ago and was designed according\nto the FSU standards. The pavement shows distress in the form of surface cracks on the entire\nlength  and  rutting35  at  a  number  of  places.  The  poor  condition  of  the  bituminous  surface  is\nattributable  to  past  paving  methods  and  lack  of  quality  control.  Rehabilitation  is  required  to\nprevent the road from deteriorating further. The rehabilitation will consist of reconstructing failed\nembankments,  providing  a  crushed  aggregate  base  course,  surfacing  with  asphalt  concrete,\nand improving the shoulders and drainage facilities. Rehabilitation does not include any major\nwidening or upgrading works.\n\n71.  \nThe  Almaty-Bishkek  road  has  two  critical  sections  (km  167\u2013km  171  and  km  184\u2013km\n191) over the Kurday mountain pass. They have been identified as most hazardous because of\nsteep  gradients  and  sharp  curves  at  a  number  of  places.  The  trucks  and  buses  travel  very\nslowly  on  these  sections  during  summer  and  are  unable  to  cross  the  mountain  pass  during\nwinter  when  the  road  is  slippery  because  of  snow.  A  high  rate  of  road  accidents  has  been\n\n                  \n\n34  According  to  the  World  Bank  and  ADB  studies,  road  accidents  cost  about  1-3  percent  of  a  country's  GDP.\nAssuming  the  lower  bound,  for  the  1998  Kazakh  GDP  of  T1,747  billion,  the  loss  would  have  amounted  to  T17\nbillion or $222 million; for the Kyrgyz GDP of Som33 billion, the loss would be about Som333 million or $19 million.\n35 Furrows made by truck wheels, which develop due to densification and deformation in the lower pavement layers\nunder  traffic  loading,  and/or  plastic  flow  in  bituminous  surfaces  under  high  temperatures  and  tire  pressures\n(normally forming where the bituminous materials are soft).\n\n\f19\n\nrecorded,  mainly  due  to  overturning  of  vehicles  going  downhill.  These  two  sections  will  be\nrealigned to substantially improve their gradients and curvatures.\n\n72.   With  the  establishment  of  the  equipment  pool,  the  system  for  road  maintenance  by\ncontract will be introduced along the Almaty-Bishkek road and compared with maintenance by\nforce  account  for  its  efficiency  and  costs.  The  system  will  also  incorporate  service  and  safety\nconsiderations, and environmental and social impact mitigation measures.\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n73.      The  total  Project  cost  is  estimated  at  $119.1  million  equivalent.  For  the  Kazakh\ncomponent, the cost estimate is $112.4 million equivalent (foreign exchange cost of $58.9 million\nand local currency cost of 53.5 million equivalent). For the Kyrgyz component, the cost estimate is\n$6.7  million  equivalent  (foreign  exchange  cost  of  $3.7  million  and  local  currency  cost  of  $3.0\nmillion  equivalent).  The  estimates  are  summarized  in  Table  1,  and  presented  in  detail  in\nAppendix 9.\n\nItem\nA. Base Cost\n  1.

For the Kazakh component, the proposed\nADB  loan  will  be  $65.0  million  (57.8  percent),  with  a  parallel  EBRD  cofinancing  of  $25.0  million\n(22.2 percent), Government financing of $22.0 million equivalent (19.6 percent), and a TRACECA\ngrant  of  $0.4  million  (0.4  percent).  For  the  Kyrgyz  component,  the  proposed  ADB  loan  will  be\n$5.0  million  (74.6  percent),  supplemented  by  Government  financing  of  $1.3  million  equivalent\n(19.4 percent), and a TRACECA grant of $0.4 million (6.0 percent) (details in Appendix 9).\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nKazakhstan\nLC\n\nFX\n\nTotal\n\n%\n\nKyrgyz Republic\nLC\n\nTotal\n\nFX\n\n%\n\nSource\n\nADB\n\nEBRD\n\n46.0\n\n19.0\n\n 65.0\n\n 57.8\n\n3.3\n\n1.7\n\n5.0\n\n 74.6\n\n12.5\n\n 12.5\n\n25.0\n\n 22.2\n\n-\n\n-\n\nTRACECA\n\n0.4\n\n-\n\n  0.4\n\n  0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n  6.0\n\nGovernment\n\n-\n\n22.0\n\n 22.0\n\n 19.6\n\n1.3\n\n1.3\n\n 19.4\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nCombined\nTotal\n%\n\n 59.3\n\n 20.3\n\n  0.7\n\n 19.7\n\nTotal\n\n100.0\nEBRD = European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, FX = foreign exchange, LC = local currency,\nTRACECA = Transport Corridor Europe Caucasus Asia.\n\n100.0\n\n100.0\n\n112.4\n\n58.9\n\n53.5\n\n3.0\n\n6.7\n\n3.7\n\n75.   While  the  TRACECA  component  has  been  approved  by  EU,  EBRD  is  expected  to\napprove  parallel  cofinancing  in  the  amount  of  $25.0  million  in  November  2000.  EBRD  will\nfinance 50.4 km of civil works in Kazakhstan.\n\n76.  \nFor  the  Kazakh  component,  the  Borrower  will  be  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan.  The  ADB\nloan will be provided in US dollars with interest rate determined in accordance with ADB's pool-\nbased variable lending rate system for US dollar loans, and an amortization period of 24 years\nincluding a grace period of 4 years, an annual commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum\nand a front-end fee of 1 percent of the loan amount. The proposed ADB loan will finance 78.1\npercent  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  35.5  percent  of  the  local  currency  cost,  EBRD  will\nmeet 21.2 percent of the foreign exchange cost and 23.4 percent of the local currency cost, and\nthe TRACECA grant will finance 0.7 percent of the foreign exchange cost. The Government will\nfinance the remaining 41.1 percent of the local currency cost.\n\n77. \nFor the Kyrgyz component, the Borrower will be the Kyrgyz Republic. The ADB loan will\nbe provided from its Special Funds resources. The loan will have a 32-year amortization period\nincluding an 8-year grace period, with a 1.0 percent interest charge during the grace period and\n1.5  percent  thereafter.    The  proposed  ADB  loan  will  finance  89.2  percent  of  the  foreign\nexchange  cost,  and  56.7  percent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  TRACECA  grant  will  finance\nthe  remaining  10.8  percent  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  the  Government  the  remaining\n43.3 percent of the local currency cost.\n\n78.  \nThe economic slowdown following the Russian crisis that began in 1998 has profoundly\naffected  both  the  Kazakh  and  Kyrgyz  economies.    As  a  result,  fiscal  constraints  facing  the\nGovernments  have  become  even  tighter.  During  1999,  the  Government  of  Kazakhstan  has\ncontinued  its  efforts  at  domestic  resource  mobilization  as  evidenced  by  spending  cuts\n\n\f21\n\nincorporated in the second budget revision adopted in June 1999. At present, the Government\nis working with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on further reducing expenditure and other\nmeasures to strengthen fiscal stability. The Government of Kyrgyz Republic, in consultation with\nthe IMF under the ESAF program, has been engaged in working out measures for further fiscal\nstrengthening.    Meanwhile,  the  severe  fiscal  constraints  are  likely  to  persist  during  the  project\nimplementation  period  in  both  countries  since  the  economic  and  fiscal  situation  can  only\nimprove gradually.  Therefore, local cost financing is considered appropriate for the project.\n\nF.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nBasic Approach\n\nFor  the  project  objectives  to  be  achieved,  it  will  be  necessary  to  coordinate  the\n79. \nimplementation of both physical and nonphysical components in Kazakhstan and in the Kyrgyz\nRepublic  for  concurrent  progress  and  completion.  It  will  also  be  necessary  to  lower  in  concert\nthe  nonphysical  barriers  to  movement  across  the  border  so  that  regardless  of  the  direction  of\nmovement, similar procedures are applied and delays are avoided. The loan documents include\na  number  of  cross-conditionality  provisions  to  ensure  that  the  various  components  are\nsynchronized during project implementation.\n\n2.\n\nThe Executing Agencies\n\na.\n\nKazakhstan\n\nThe  KAZMOTC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The  project  steering  committee  (PSC)\n80.  \nestablished  under  the  ongoing  project  in  June  1996  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  overseeing  and\ncoordinating  the  project  activities,  including  liaison  among  the  agencies  involved  in  project\nimplementation, and sector reforms; (ii) reviewing the status of the implementation of the project\ncomponents;  (iii)  monitoring  the  progress  achieved  and  resolving  difficulties  encountered;  and\n(iv)  serving  as  a  forum  for  discussions  on  and  review  of  the  project  impact  on  regional\ndevelopment. The PSC is chaired by the Minister of KAZMOTC (or his representative), and the\nmembers  are  the  chairman  of  CRRT,  director  general  of  Kazakhavtodor,  Chief  of  Investment\nProject Division of KAZMOTC, and representatives from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry\nof Economy.\n\n81.  \nKAZMOTC  will  discharge  its  functions  through  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)\nreporting to the Board of Investment Projects. The PIU will be established by 1 November 2000\nand will be headed by a qualified project manager responsible for the rehabilitation component.\nBy 1 July 2003, a maintenance supervision unit (MSU) will be established in the PIU, headed by\na  maintenance  manager  responsible  for  the  road  maintenance  component.  The  project\nmanager  will  be  supported  by  road  engineers,  materials  and  soils  engineer,  bridge  engineer,\nand  supporting  financial  and  clerical  staff.    The  PIU  and  MSU  will  remain  adequately  staffed\nthroughout  project  implementation  and  will  be  assisted  by  the  international  and  domestic\nconsultants for design and construction supervision financed under the proposed ADB loan. The\nPIU  and  MSU  will  undertake  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  Project  and  provide  the\nnecessary liaison between KAZMOTC, contractors, suppliers, and ADB.\n\n\f22\n\nb. \n\nThe Kyrgyz Republic\n\n82.  \nThe  KGZMOTC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The  PSC  similar  to  that  in  Kazakhstan\nhas  been  established  within  KGZMOTC  for  the  ongoing  projects  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The\nPSC will carry out the same functions as its Kazakh counterpart.\n\n83.  \nConsidering  the  small  size  of  the  Kyrgyz  component,  the  PIU  established  under  the\nongoing projects will also be given the responsibility for implementation of the proposed Project.\nTo strengthen the PIU\u2019s capacity, two additional technical staff will be made available on a full-\ntime basis during the implementation period. The PIU will be assisted by the international and\ndomestic consultants to be recruited for design and construction supervision and will provide the\nnecessary liaison among KGZMOTC, contractors, suppliers, and ADB.\n\n3.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n84.  \nProject implementation will commence in the beginning of 2001. The Kyrgyz component\nis expected to be completed in three years, i.e., by the end of 2003, and the Kazakh component\nin four years, i.e., by the end of 2004 (Appendix 10).\n\n4.\n\nProcurement\n\n85. \nProcurement of goods and services under the ADB loans will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for\nProcurement. As shown in Appendix 11, the civil works for the Kazakh component will be split\ninto  two  packages.  The  ADB-financed  package  (covering  154  km  of  civil  works)  and  road\nmaintenance  equipment  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding  and  the\ncofinanced  package  (50.4  km  of  civil  works)  will  follow  EBRD\u2019s  procurement  guidelines.\nCustoms equipment will be procured following TRACECA\u2019s international shopping procedures,\nand laboratory equipment following ADB\u2019s international shopping procedures.\n \n86.  \nThe  civil  works  for  the  Kyrgyz  component  will  be  procured  using  local  competitive\nbidding procedures acceptable to ADB,36 mainly because such small contracts are not attractive\nto  international  contractors,  given  the  need  to  mobilize  resources  such  as  road  construction\nequipment to Central Asia.  The rehabilitation works involved\u2013overlays and drainage works\u2013are\nsimple,  and  the  local  contractors  have  adequate  capability  to  undertake  contracts  for  them.\nAlso,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  experiencing  severe  financial  difficulties  and  the  Government  is\nkeen  to  provide  employment  opportunities  to  its  people  without  sacrificing  the  integrity  of  the\nProject.  Integrity  will  be  ensured  by  following  proper  bidding  procedures  and  international\nconsultants supervising the works.\n\n5.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n87.    \n    Design  and  construction  supervision  in  each  country,  including  for  the  section  in\nKazakhstan  to  be  financed  by  EBRD,  will  be  undertaken  by  international  consultants  in\nassociation  with  domestic  consultants  financed  by  ADB.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and\nengaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other procedures\nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  recruitment  of  domestic  consultants.  The  terms  of  reference  for  the\nconsulting services are in Appendix 12.\n\n36 With the option that international contractors interested to participate in the tendering will be allowed to bid.\n\n                  \n\n\f23\n\nThe  consulting  services  in  Kazakhstan  will  comprise  about  342  person-months  (90\n88.  \ninternational  and  252  domestic).  In  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  the  input  will  be  about  50  person-\nmonths  (20  international  and  30  domestic).    In  providing  the  services,  the  international\nconsultants will ensure on-the-job training of and transfer of expertise to staff of the Executing\nAgencies  and  domestic  design  and  construction  supervision  companies,  particularly  in  project\nand contract management, and environment protection and road safety measures.\n\n6.\n\nDisbursement\n\n89.    Direct  payment  procedures  described  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook  will  be\nused  for  the  civil  works,  road  maintenance  equipment,  and  consulting  services  contracts.\nDisbursement to meet the incremental project administration cost (project management) will be\nreimbursed using the statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure with SOE ceilings of $60,000\nand $30,000 per individual payment for Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, respectively. The\nCRRT  has  been  showing  administrative  capability  to  maintain  SOE  records  and  accounts  in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n7.\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audits\n\n90.  \nThe  project  supervision  consultants  in  Kazakhstan  will  prepare  and  submit  quarterly\nreports  on  the  progress  of  implementation  to  KAZMOTC,  ADB,  and  EBRD,  and  in  the  Kyrgyz\nRepublic  to  KGZMOTC  and  ADB.  The  TA  consultants  will  prepare  and  submit  brief  monthly\nprogress reports on the implementation of the CBA. The format of the reports will be discussed\nand agreed upon before the start of the consulting services. To facilitate postevaluation of the\nProject, KAZMOTC and KGZMOTC will arrange for the consultants to submit to ADB and EBRD\nproject  completion  reports  covering  the  execution  and  initial  operation  of  the  facilities,  within\nthree months of the physical completion of the Project.\n\nFor  their  respective  components,  KAZMOTC  and  KGZMOTC  will  maintain  separate\n91.  \nrecords  and  accounts  adequate  to  (i)  identify  the  goods  and  services  financed  out  of  the\nproceeds  of  the  loans  from  counterpart  local  funds;  (ii)  identify  the  use  of  these  goods  and\nservices on the components; (iii) record the progress of the components, including their costs;\nand (iv) reflect, in accordance with consistently maintained sound accounting, the components\u2019\noperations and financial condition.\n\n92.  \nThe  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  by\nexternal auditors acceptable to ADB for the ADB-financed portion and to EBRD for the EBRD-\nfinanced  component.  If  qualified  State  auditors  are  not  available,  private  auditors  will  be\nrecruited following the competitive recruitment procedures of the Governments and using their\nown  resources  or  loan  funds.    The  audited  accounts  and  auditors\u2019  report,  prepared  in\naccordance with internationally accepted accounting standards, will be submitted to ADB within\nnine months of the end of the fiscal year.\n\n8.\n\nTripartite Coordination Meeting\n\n93.  \nRepresentatives of Kazakhstan (KAZMOTC and Kazakh Customs), the Kyrgyz Republic\n(KGZMOTC and Kyrgyz Customs), and the financiers (ADB, EBRD, and TRACECA) will meet\ntwice  a  year  alternatively  in  Almaty  and  Bishkek  to  discuss  the  project  implementation  status,\nresolve  common  problems,  and,  most  importantly,  ensure  full  implementation  of  the  CBA.\nKAZMOTC and KGZMOTC will finance the costs incurred in preparing for and attending these\nmeetings through the project management component of their respective loans.\n\n\f24\n\n9.\n\nMidterm Review\n\n   \n94.   \nToward the end of 2002, ADB with KAZMOTC and KGZMOTC, will undertake a detailed\nreview  of  the  Project  and  its  implementation  status.  The  objectives  will  be  to  (i)  evaluate  the\nGovernments\u2019  progress  in  implementing  policy  reforms;  (ii) examine  the  implementation  of  the\nProject and determine whether any adjustments to the scope and implementation arrangements\nare  warranted;  (iii)  determine  compliance  with  relevant  standards,  (iv)  address  any  potential\nprocurement,  financing,  and  scheduling  issues;  and  (iii)  examine  compliance  with  the  loan\ncovenants.\n\n10.  Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nKAZMOTC  and  KGZMOTC,  with  the  assistance  of  their  respective  supervision\n95.  \nconsultants,  will  carry  out  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  by  compiling  and  analyzing  the\nappropriate  border  crossing,  traffic,  axle  load,  and  socioeconomic  data.  For  this  purpose,\nKAZMOTC and KGZMOTC will agree on appropriate surveys to establish baseline data before\nproject  implementation,  and  direct  their  respective  supervision  consultants  to  carry  them  out.\nSocioeconomic indicators to be monitored will include passenger fares and freight rates, traffic\nspeed  and  accidents,  agricultural  and  industrial  goods  transported  on  the  road,  vehicle\noperation and maintenance costs, and number and type of jobs created in the construction and\nmaintenance activities. The data provided will be disaggregated by gender and collected during\nproject  implementation  and  after  completion.  Environmental  monitoring  will  be  undertaken  as\ndetailed  in  the  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  report.  The  findings  and\nsupporting  data  will  be  incorporated  in  the  project  completion  reports.  KAZMOTC  and\nKGZMOTC will evaluate the benefits from their components in accordance with the schedules\nand terms of reference to be agreed upon with ADB.\n\n \n\n11.\n\nAnticorruption Policy\n\n96.      During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to the Kazakh and\nKyrgyz  Government  officials.    Attention  was  drawn  to  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption  in\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  It  was\nemphasized  that  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  requires  the  borrowers  (including  beneficiaries  of\nADB  loans),  as  well  as  the  consultants/bidders/suppliers/contractors  under  ADB-financed\ncontracts,  to  observe  the  highest  standard  of  ethics  during  the  recruitment,  procurement,  and\nexecution of such contracts; and that sanctions, as per the guidelines, would be taken if fraud\nand  corruption  are  discovered.  The  Governments  are  committed  to  creating  corruption-free\nenvironments and would like the Project to be implemented strictly following ADB\u2019s guidelines.\nADB has conducted  a  number  of seminars37  on  its  operation  policies  and  procedures  in  which\ncorrupt and fraudulent practices were spelled out and ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy explained to\nthe  participants.  The  Governments\u2019  pricing  and  procurement  procedures  are  being\nstrengthened38  to  conform  with  the  requirements  of  the  relevant  law,  and  audits  of  project\naccounts  are  being  carried  out  with  the  help  of  external  auditors  in  accordance  with  generally\naccepted auditing standards.\n\n                  \n\n37  TA  2732-KAZ:  Seminars on Bank Operation Policies and Procedures,  for  $85,000,  approved  on  24  December\n1996;  and  TA  2982-KGZ: Seminars on Bank Operation Policies and Procedures,  for  $114,000,  approved  on  23\nJanuary 1998.\n\n38 The assistance will be provided by the transport adviser under the Project for Kazakhstan and under Loan 1630-\n\nKGZ (footnote 15) for the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\n\f25\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.   \n\nEnvironmental Impacts\n\nADB  has  classified  the  Project  in  environmental  category  B.  Initial  environmental\n97.  \nexamination  (IEE)  was  carried  out  with  the  help  of  TA  2632-KAZ  for  the  Kazakh  component\n(footnote 2) and by construction supervision consultants under Loan 1444-KGZ for the Kyrgyz\ncomponent  (footnote  3)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental Assessment Requirements\nand  Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects.  The  SIEE  in  Appendix  13\npresents the main findings and recommendations.\n\n98.   \nThe  project  road  passes  through  varied  terrain,  valleys,  high  mountains  and  mountain\npasses,  agricultural  (farmland  and  grazing  grounds)  and  nonagricultural  lands,  and  areas  with\nlow  and  medium  population  densities.  No  designated  wetlands,  forests,  nature  conservation\nareas, and places of archaeological importance exist within the project area. Trees have been\nplanted along the road in many sections as protection against embankment erosion and noise\nand dust pollution in the nearby settlements.\n\n99.    Road rehabilitation will be carried out on the existing alignment, except at two sections\nwith a total length of 12 km in the mountainous areas of Kurday Pass in Kazakhstan. The area\naffected  by  the  realignment  is  a  wasteland.  Rehabilitation  will  include  reconstructing  failed\nembankments,  removing  and  replacing  some  layers  of  road  structure,  and  improving  the\ndrainage systems. Borrow areas and quarries, construction and camps, road haulage, and road\ndiversions will have some temporary impacts during construction.\n\n100.     The IEE indicates that the potential negative environmental impacts can be mitigated to\nan acceptable level. The mitigation measures include (i) selecting land for construction camps,\nborrow areas, and quarries in wasteland areas and restoring them soon after the completion of\nconstruction;  (ii)  preventing  any  aggravation  in  the  soil  erosion-prone  areas;  (iii)  controlling\nsewage  discharge  and  other  waste  fluids  from  construction  camps,  and  hazardous  and  toxic\nmaterials  from  asphalt  and  crushing  plants  and  from  construction  equipment;  (iv)  maintaining\nproper drainage to avoid stagnation and controlling downstream water pollution; (v) reinstating\nvegetation and trees that are affected by construction activities but are needed to prevent soil\nerosion;  (vi)  controlling  disturbance  to  animals  and  pastures;  (vii)  minimizing  noise,  dust,\nemissions and other pollutants associated with road rehabilitation works through limitations on\nworking  hours,  dust  control  devices,  and  water  sprays;  (viii)  minimizing  the  potential  negative\nimpacts  on  the  approach  roads  in  the  vicinity  of  the  project  road  through  appropriate\nmaintenance  activities;  and  (ix)  training  the  contractors\u2019  workforce  in  the  prevention  of\ncommunicable  and  infectious  diseases.  The  civil  works  contracts  will  include  these  mitigation\nmeasures,  and  the  construction  supervision  consultants,  Executing  Agencies,  and  the\nconcerned national environmental organizations will monitor their implementation. No significant\nimpacts  are  expected  after  project  completion.  The  road  maintenance  contracts  will  include\nmitigation  measures  during  operation  of \nto  enhance  environmental\nsustainability.\n\nthe  project  road \n\n101.  \nIn  Kazakhstan,  environmental  monitoring  and  coordination,  and  implementation  of\npolicies and legislation are carried out by the Ministry of Ecology and Bioresources (MEB) at the\nnational  level  and  by  MEB\u2019s  Department  of  Ecology  and  Bioresources  (DEB)  at  the  regional\nlevel. The IEE indicated that the current institutional setup is adequate. The DEB of Almaty and\nZhambul regions will be closely associated with the implementation of the Project. Similarly, in\nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic  the  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection  is  responsible  for  environmental\n\n\f26\n\npolicy,  regulations,  and  monitoring.  Since  Chui  where  the  Project  road  is  located  is  on  the\nperiphery of Bishkek, the ministry, with the help of the construction supervision consultants, will\nmonitor the environmental impacts during implementation and operation of the Kyrgyz portion of\nthe project road.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Impacts\n\n102.   The summary social impact assessment (SSIA) in Appendix 14 describes the results of\nthe initial social assessment prepared under TA 2632-KAZ (footnote 2) and identifies the social\nimpacts related to the Project and the recommended mitigation measures.\n\n103.    The  project  influence  area  (PIA)  consists  of  Almaty  City,  and  Almaty  and  Zhambul\nregions  in  Kazakhstan,  and  Chui  region,  including  Bishkek  City,  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The\ntotal population in the PIA is about 4.5 million. Excluding Bishkek and Almaty, up to 70 percent\nof  the  population  is  rural.  The  agriculture  sector  provides  employment  in  the  settlements\ncrossed  by  the  road.  Industrial  and  service  sectors  (e.g.,  mining,  agroprocessing,  textile  and\nmechanic industries) are developed in Almaty City, Almaty region, the border city of Georgievka,\nand Chui region.\n\n104.  Residents in the PIA have been reacting very positively to the idea of rehabilitating the\nAlmaty-Bishkek  road  as  they  expect  (i)  employment  in  construction  and  construction-related\njobs; (ii) benefits from the additional demand for construction materials and services, and faster\nand cheaper access to Almaty, Bishkek, and other markets in the area; and  (iii) proper traffic\nmanagement, road safety, and environmental provisions including more trees planted along the\nroad.  The  residents  also  expressed  concerns  about  the  safety  of  the  villagers  living  in  the\nsettlements crossed by the road, restoration and improvement of the existing drainage system,\nand maintenance of the road after rehabilitation. Representatives of drivers\u2019 union associations\nand transport operators stated the need for more organized service stations along the road, and\nexpressed dissatisfaction with customs procedures and waiting time at the Akzhol-Chu border.\n\n105.    During  construction,  some  temporary  adverse  impacts  associated  with  road  diversion,\nnoise, dust, disruption of drainage systems, borrow areas and quarries, and the establishment\nof  labor  camps  are  expected.  Also,  pressure  on  the  existing  health  facilities  in  the  PIA  will\nincrease due to the influx of construction workers, and the associated greater risk of diseases\n(e.g., communicable diseases) and health hazards at the construction site.\n\n106.    Although no severe and/or permanent adverse social impacts are expected as a result of\nthe  Project,  the  recommended  mitigation  measures  will  be  implemented  and  monitored  at  all\nstages of construction. To ensure road safety, fencing will be installed and pedestrian crossings\nwill be marked in the residential areas. Since the influx of workers involved in the rehabilitation\nworks  could  increase  the  spread  of  communicable  and  infectious  diseases  in  the  PIA,  the\nKAZMOTC and KGZMOTC will advise the consultants and contractors to distribute information\nmaterials  and  make  basic  training  in  the  prevention  of  these  diseases  as  part  of  the  safety\ntraining for the workforce.\n\n107.    Road rehabilitation will follow the current alignment, with the exception of two sections at\nthe  Kurday  mountain  pass,  and  does  not  involve  any  upgrading  or  major  widening.  In  those\nsections  where  minor  widening  is  required  (e.g.,  to  improve  drainage  structures),  the  existing\nright-of-way  provides  sufficient  space.  At  the  Kurday  pass,  the  new  realignment  will  traverse\nunused mountainous land that can be classified as wasteland. Agricultural land is the property\nof the state in Kazakhstan. Accordingly, there is no need to transfer the land title or to budget for\n\n\f27\n\nit the project cost. Overall, no permanent impacts are expected on land and other assets along\nthe  road,  and  no  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  in  terms  of  housing  and  nonhousing\nrelocation are needed.\n\n108.   A temporary land borrow will be maintained during implementation, but it will be restored\nin accordance with the recommendations and mitigation measures detailed in the SIEE. Borrow\nareas  will  be  defined  and  clearly  located  during  the  finalization  of  the  detailed  design.  If  any\nresettlement  effects  arise  from  temporary  land  borrow  or  permanent  land  acquisition  (e.g.,\nbecause of changes in project design), all requirements as stated in ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary\nResettlement  (1995)  and  in  the Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice  (1998)\nwill  be  met.  The  social  impacts  of  the  Project  will  be  monitored  and  evaluated  during\nimplementation and after completion (para. 95).\n\n3.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n109.  The main findings of the 1996 poverty survey in Kazakhstan39 are that (i) a third of the\npopulation  (about  5.5  million)  lived  below  a  \u201csubsistence  minimum\u201d  living  standard,40  (ii)  there\nwas  a  marked  regional  variation  in  the  incidence  of  poverty,  with  over  two  thirds  of  the  poor\nliving  in  the  south  and  east  of  the  country;  and  (iii)  poverty  was  highly  correlated  with  large\nfamily size and unemployment. The Kazakh portion of the project road is located in the poorer\neastern Zhambul and Almaty regions with populations of 1.0 million and 2.1 million, respectively.\nOf  the  total  national  poor  in  1996,  42  percent  resided  in  the  south,  24  percent  in  the  east,  15\npercent  in  the  west,  14  percent  in  the  center,  and  5  percent  in  the  north.  This  distribution\nreflected  the  lower  resource  endowment,  limited  employment  opportunities,  and  higher\npercentage  of  poor  people  living  in  the  rural  areas  of  the  south  and  of  part  of  the  east  of\nKazakhstan  (55  percent  against the national average of 45 percent). Poverty was found to be\nhigher in the rural (39 percent) than in the urban areas (30 percent).\n\n The Kyrgyz Poverty Monitoring Survey carried out by the National Statistical Committee\n110.   \nin  collaboration  with  the  World  Bank  provided  household  data  for  1996  and  1997.  These\nsurveys indicated that about 50 percent of the population (2.3 million) were classified as poor.41\nAs in Kazakhstan, poverty was higher in the rural areas: more than 70 percent of the poor lived\nin the rural areas.  Poverty was very high in the southern part of the country (in Naryn region 90\npercent  of  the  population  was  poor).  In  the  PIA,  the  poverty  levels  of  both  Bishkek  (with  6\npercent)  and  Chui  region  (27  percent)  were  significantly  lower  than  the  national  average.\nHowever, poverty in the rural areas of Chui region was close to the national rural average (59\npercent of the population in 1996).\n\n111.   Transport investments play an important role in stimulating economic growth through the\nmarket widening effect and, thus reducing poverty.  The main direct impact of the project road\nwill  be  the  creation  of  employment  opportunities  in  road  construction  and  maintenance  in\nZhambul  and  Almaty  regions,  and  the  rural  areas  of  Chui  region.  There  may  be  additional\nopportunities in trade and other informal sectors, mainly through organized business practices\nsuch  as  the  establishment  of  service  centers  along  the  road.  Since  the  project  focuses  on\nrehabilitating the existing road, it is not expected to provide additional access to public services\nsuch as education, health care, and utilities.\n\n                  \n\n39 The World Bank, Household Survey on Living Standards, 1997.\n40  The  World  Bank\u2019s  survey  considers  the  Government\u2019s  \u201csubsistence  minimum\u201d  as  the  poverty  line.  This  figure  in\n\n1996 was T2,861 ($40) per capita per month.\n\n41 In 1997, the poverty line was Som388 ($23) per capita per month.\n\n\fH.\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\n28\n\n112.  The  two  advisory  TAs  will  help  Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  in  implementing\nmeasures  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  safety  of  transport  on  the  Almaty-Bishkek  road.  The\nKazakh  TA  will  have  three  phases  and  the  Kyrgyz  TA  two  (see  the  terms  of  reference  in\nAppendix 15).\n\n113.      The primary objective of phase I will be to assist the two Governments to implement the\nCBA for regulating and easing the movement of people, goods, and vehicles across the Akzhol-\nChu border in Georgievka, and to formulate longer term strategies for expanded use of the CBA\nat  other  border  crossings  to  foster  regional  economic  cooperation.  Phase  II  will  focus  on\nimproving  coordination  and  management  of  road  safety  in  both  countries,  including  the\nthe  project  supervision  consultants,  of  adequate\nincorporation, \nenvironmental and social mitigation and safety measures in the maintenance by contract. Phase\nIII  will  help  KAZMOTC  streamline  its  functions  and  responsibilities,  define  sector  objectives\ntaking  into  account  reforms  implemented  so  far  on  the  basis  of  the  Road  Sector  Policy\nStatement adopted on 31 March 1996, and prepare the three-year national transport investment\nplan.    The  advisory  support  will  also  address  issues  concerning  transport  policy  review  and\nanalysis, regulations, pricing, and procurement. Phase III will be implemented with the help of a\ntransport policy adviser.\n\nin  cooperation  with \n\n114.   About  32  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  (Kazakhstan,  22;  the\nKyrgyz  Republic,  10)  and  30  of  domestic  (Kazakhstan,  18;  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  12)  will  be\nrequired.  The  same  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  for  both  TAs  in  accordance  with\nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  The work will commence in August 2001, and is\nexpected  to  be  completed  in  less  than  one  year  for  Phases  I  and  II  in  the  two  countries.  The\nservices  of  the  transport  policy  adviser  in  Kazakhstan  under  phase  III  will  be  provided  on  a\nstaggered basis until mid-2004.\n\n115.  \n Detailed cost estimates for the two TAs are given in Appendixes 16 and 17. The total\ncost  of  the  Kazakh  TA  is  estimated  at  $1,080,000  equivalent  comprising  $634,000  in  foreign\nexchange cost and $446,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The Government has requested\nADB  to  finance  $750,000  equivalent,  covering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $116,000\nequivalent  of  the  local  currency  expenditure.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  local\ncurrency cost of $330,000 equivalent. The total cost of the Kyrgyz TA is estimated at $515,000\nequivalent  comprising  $370,000  in  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $145,000  equivalent  in  local\ncurrency  cost.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  finance  $440,000,  covering  the  entire\nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $70,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  expenditures.  The\nGovernment will finance the remaining local currency cost of $75,000 equivalent. The TAs will\nbe financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government\nof Japan.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n116.   The economic analysis of the rehabilitation of the Almaty-Bishkek road was carried out\nwith a comparison of the with-and without-Project scenarios. The Project involves providing new\nbase  courses,  resurfacing  and  other  improvements  on  the  entire  road,  and  new  alignment  in\nparts  of  the  Kurday  Pass  area.  The  without  Project  scenario  involves  routine  and  periodic\nmaintenance at current levels to keep the road in its current condition. The economic analysis\n\n\f29\n\ncovers the construction period 2001-2004 plus the subsequent 20 years operation. Assumptions\nunderlying the traffic forecasts for the Project are described in Appendix 18. Appendix 19 gives\nthe  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  calculated  for  four  scenarios:  (i)  the  Kazakh\nportion of the project road including benefits from road rehabilitation but excluding subregional\nbenefits; (ii) the Kyrgyz portion with rehabilitation benefits without subregional benefits; (iii) the\noverall Project and the country components including subregional benefits; and (iv) the overall\nProject including both subregional benefits and regional benefits arising from transit traffic.\n\n117.   The  main  sources  of  economic  benefits  from  improvement  of  the  project  road  are\nsavings in  (i) VOCs for normal traffic, (ii) VOCs  for generated traffic, and (iii) time because of\nthe  improved  alignment  and  increased  speeds  in  the  Kurday  Pass  area  for  freight  and\npassenger traffic. The VOC savings due to the improved road conditions comprise the largest\ncategory of savings, accounting for 70-80 percent of total benefits. The wider shoulders of the\nproject road and the improved alignment in the Kurday Pass area will significantly improve the\nsafety  conditions  of  the  road.  Since  available  data  are  insufficient  to  quantify  the  value  of  the\nreduced  level  of  vehicle  accidents,  such  benefits  have  not  been  included  in  the  EIRR\ncalculation.\n\n118.  The improvement in cross-border policies and procedures will result in less time spent at\nthe  Akzhol-Chu  border  crossing  and  will  thus  reduce  costs,  facilitate  trade  between  the  two\ncountries,  and  generate  new  economic  activities.  Two  categories  of  such  subregional  benefits\nwill arise from the Project: (i) time savings, and (ii) new economic activity to meet the increased\ndemand  for  goods  due  to  lower  costs  of  trade.  The  improved  border  control  procedures  will\nresult in time savings from the removal of (i) control point delays, (ii) border processing delays,\nand (iii) clearance delays. The time savings will reduce the costs of trade. No sufficient data are\navailable to estimate the benefits from the new economic activities; however, such activities are\nexpected to be significant. The reduced cost of trade and new economic activities will increase\nthe volume of trade and the amount of traffic necessary to transport it. The increased trade will\ninvolve products such as fresh produce and other agricultural goods and will generate increased\ntraffic on the project road. The subregional benefits have been distributed approximately evenly\nbetween Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic on the basis of the flow of cargo vehicles through\nthe border crossing.\n\n119.   A summary of the results of the economic analysis is in Table 3. The EIRR for the overall\nProject,  including  subregional  benefits,  is  estimated  at  27.6  percent.  Due  to  the  much  smaller\nscale  of  the  Kyrgyz  portion  relative  to  the  Kazakh  portion  and  the  approximately  equal\ndistribution of subregional benefits, the inclusion of subregional benefits has a larger impact in\nthe  former  case,  which  has  an  EIRR  of  48.8  percent,  versus  25.6  percent  for  the  Kazakh\ncomponent.  If the subregional benefits are excluded, the EIRR for the overall Project decreases\nto  23.8  percent,  and  the  EIRRs  for  the  Kazakh  and  Kyrgyz  components  decrease  to  23.7\npercent  and  25.9  percent,  respectively.  The  above  EIRR  calculations  do  not  include  transit\ntraffic benefits as these do not accrue to either of the project countries. They will accrue to other\ncountries in the region (primarily Russia and Uzbekistan). Inclusion of direct regional benefits in\nthe form of VOC savings increases the EIRR to 28.0 percent. Secondary regional benefits are\ndifficult to quantify, but are expected to further increase the level of project benefits.\n\n\f30\n\nTable 3:  Base Case EIRRs and NPVs\n\n28.0\n\n105.1\n\nItem\n\nWithout Subregional\nBenefits\nKGZ\n\nKAZ\n\nOverall\n\nWith Subregional\nBenefits\nKGZ\n\nKAZ\n\nOverall\n\nOverall With Subregional\nand Regional Benefits\n\nEIRR (%)\n\n23.7\n\n25.9\n\n23.8\n\n25.6\n\n48.8\n\n27.6\n\nNPV\n($ million)\n\n68.0\n\n4.5\n\n72.5\n\n81.0\n\n20.6\n\n101.6\n\n    EIRR = economic internal rate of return; KAZ = Kazakhstan; KGZ = Kyrgystan; NPV = net present value.\n\n120.   Sensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  to  test  the  impact  of  negative  changes  on  key\nparameters determining the costs and benefits of the Project. The results for the overall Project,\nincluding subregional benefits, indicate that it would take an increase in costs of 170 percent or\na decrease in benefits of 63 percent for the EIRR to decline to the cutoff level of 12 percent. The\nswitching  values  for  the  Project  excluding  subregional  benefits  are  smaller  than  those  for  the\nProject  including  those  benefits,  but  are  still  high  overall.  Given  that  both  countries  now  have\nexperience in implementing ADB-financed road projects, it is not likely that such large increases\nin costs will occur. Similarly, given the somewhat conservative nature of the traffic forecast, it is\nnot likely that such large decreases in benefits will occur.\n\nB. \n\nProject Risks\n\n121.    Since the EIRRs remain acceptable even with adverse changes in the cost and benefit\nparameters,  the  Project  is  not  subject  to  substantial  economic  risks.  The  Russian  economic\ncrisis appears to have relatively limited impact on the Project. The only significant impact to date\nhas  been  the  difficulty  experienced  by  the  Governments  in  allocating  adequate  funds  to\nmaintain the Almaty-Bishkek road. The conservative traffic forecast, especially in the short term,\ntakes the impact of the Russian crisis into account. The concern relating to road maintenance\nwill  be  addressed  by  implementing  road  maintenance  by  contract.  The  funding  terms  will  be\nadequately  addressed  in  the  maintenance  contract.  With  improvement  in  the  Road  Fund\ncollection  and  the  Governments\u2019  specific  commitment  to  allocate  funds  for  maintenance,  the\nfunding constraints are expected to be eased in the future.\n\n122.   There is a risk that improvement of the cross-border regulations and procedures will not\nmeet  expectations  because  of  the  delays  in  implementing  the  CBA  that  calls  for  relaxing  and\nstreamlining  the  procedures  to  simplify  and  make  them  transparent.  To  guard  against  this,\nassistance will be provided in the form of equipment and consulting support to introduce revised\nsystems and documentation and to train staff as per the provisions of the CBA to be approved\nand signed by the Governments of Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\n123.  Considering the current fiscal deficits in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, particular\nattention needs to be given to avoiding delays in project implementation because of a shortage\nof  counterpart  funds.  The  potential  counterpart  fund  risk  is  mitigated  by  following  ADB\u2019s\nrecommendations  concerning  the  Road  Fund  (para.  23)  for  Kazakhstan  and  with  the\nestablishment of the Road Fund for the Kyrgyz Republic (para. 38). The pressure on the Road\nFund in Kazakhstan will be eased by the end of 2001 when ADB\u2019s ongoing Road Rehabilitation\nProject is expected to be completed.\n\n\fC.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n31\n\n124. \n  The  Project  will  have  significant  positive  effects  on  both  national  and  regional\neconomies. The rehabilitation of the Almaty-Bishkek road will facilitate movements of goods and\npeople  during  the  winter  months  by  improving  road  safety  and  road  conditions  in  the\nmountainous area of Kurday Pass. It will also enhance industrial, agricultural, and commercial\nactivities  along  the  road  and  in  the  PIA  as  a  whole.  Streamlining  the  cross-border  procedures\nwill result in time savings and a more efficient trading corridor for goods and services.\n\n125.  \nIn  terms  of  job  opportunities,  the  Project  will  have  a  significant  positive  impact  during\nconstruction.  Based  on  experience  with  the  ongoing  projects  in  Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz\nRepublic, it  is  be  estimated  that  the  Project  will  generate  up  to  450  jobs  per  month  in  the\nconstruction season for skilled, semiskilled, and unskilled workers. Of these, about 300 jobs will\nbe  for  local  workers.  Indirect  employment  associated  with  the  Project  through  the  supply  of\nother goods and services (e.g., service stations, canteens, and kiosks) will be considerable as\nwell.  After  completion  of  the  rehabilitation,  road  maintenance  by  contract  will  generate  local\nemployment.  The  maintenance  crew  will  comprise  about  130  workers  on  Kazakh  and  30  on\nKyrgyz roads.\n\n126.   With  respect  to  poverty  reduction,  the  location  of  the  Project  and  the  high  correlation\nbetween  poverty  and  unemployment  in  the  PIA  ensure  that  the  additional  job  opportunities\ncreated  during  construction  and  maintenance  of  the  project  road  will  benefit  the  poor.42\nMoreover,  the  living  standard  household  surveys  conducted  in  1996  and  1997  by  the\nGovernments and the World Bank indicate that income from informal activities, especially trade,\nrepresents a large portion of the household budget of the poor and vulnerable groups in the PIA.\nThe business opportunities along the project road will supplement household incomes.\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\n127.  The  Governments  have  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal document:\n\n \n\n(i)\nProject implementation.

The  Governments  will  assist  the  project\nsupervision  consultants  and  civil  works  contractors  in  organizing\ntraining  and  disseminating  publicity  materials  targeted  to  road\nconstruction workers and users. The Governments will ensure that\nsuch  information  is  also  disseminated  to  transport  operators  who\nwill be using the project road.\n\n(viii) Gender and development. The Governments will ensure that women are\nactively  involved  in  the  job  opportunities  directly  or  indirectly  arising  from  the\nProject. The Government will ensure ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development\nis followed during Project implementation.\n\nB. \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness\n\n  The  Loan  Agreement  will  have  the

regional  economic  cooperation  is  especially  important  for  realizing  the\ndevelopment  aspirations  of  the  Central  Asian  Republics  (CARs).  Central  Asia  is  an  area  with\ndeeply  rooted  traditions  of  economic  interaction.  Situated  along  the  historic  Silk  Road,  the\npeople  living  in  this  region  have  engaged  in  extensive  commerce  and  trade  from  as  early  as\n3000 BC. In the 20th century, geopolitical factors reduced the exchange of goods and services in\nthe region. Expansion of the economic linkages again became possible with the collapse of the\nformer Soviet Union (FSU) and the opening of trade in the early 1990s by the People\u2019s Republic\nof China (PRC).\n\n2. \nThe  CARs  face  daunting  constraints  to  economic  development  as  they  undergo  a\ndifficult period of transition from a command economy to one that relies on market institutions.\nThey constitute a relatively large geographic area that is distant and, until recently, isolated from\nthe modern market economies of Western Europe and Asia. The breakup of the FSU left these\ncountries  with  little  demand  for  their  products,  few  sources  for  industrial  inputs  and\nmanufactured goods, and inadequate administrative and political frameworks for functioning in\nthe  modern  world.  Furthermore,  they  are  sparsely  populated  and  have  very  low  per  capita\nincomes, which means that internal markets for domestically produced goods and services are\nlimited.  Their  economic  growth  depends  on  developing  new  trading  partners  in  place  of  their\nformer dependence on a centralized structure that no longer exists.\n\n3. \nThe Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region\u2014the far-western territory of the PRC\u2014shares\nborders, economic interests, and cultural ties with the CARs. Even more important than these\nethnic  ties,  however,  is  the  potential  resource  and  market  complementarity  among  the  CARs\nand Xinjiang, PRC.\n\nB.\n\nRegional Economic Cooperation\n\n  Since  early  1997,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  providing  technical\n4. \nassistance  (TA)  to  encourage  regional  economic  cooperation  among  its  developing  member\ncountries  in  Central  Asia\u2013Kazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Uzbekistan\u2013and  the  PRC,\nfocusing  on  the  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region.  Activities  under  the  technical  assistance\nconcentrated on identifying infrastructure needs and policy issues impeding cross-border trade\nand  traffic,  specifically  in  the  areas  of  energy,  trade,  and  transportation.1  The  findings  and\nrecommendations of the study were reviewed and validated in a series of workshops conducted\nin 1998 at ADB headquarters and in the region.2 The first workshop tackled the challenges and\nopportunities  in  transportation  and,  the  second,  in  energy.  The  third  and  fourth  workshops\ncovered  cross-border  trade  cooperation  between  Kazakhstan  and  the  PRC,  and  the  fifth\nworkshop deliberated on Kazakhstan-Kyrgyz Republic trade cooperation.\n\nThe TA (Phase II) commenced in 1999 and will support ADB\u2019s continuing policy dialogue\n5. \nin the context of regional cooperation.3 The work involves the preliminary analysis of previously\n\n                                                    \n1  TA 5707-REG: Regional Economic Cooperation in Central Asia, for $1.15 million, approved on 8 November 1996.\n2  TA  5760-REG: Workshops on Economic Cooperation in Central Asia,  for  $344,000,  approved  on  14  November\n\n3  TA  5818-REG:  Regional Economic Cooperation in Central Asia, Phase II,  for  $1.35  million,  approved  on  11\n\n1997.\n\nDecember 1998.\n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 2, page 2\n\nidentified high-priority infrastructure investments such as the rehabilitation and improvement of\nthe  interconnected  power  grid  of  Central  Asia  and  the  development  of  various  intercountry\ntransport corridors. Phase II furthermore offers the opportunity to widen the initiative to promote\neconomic cooperation in Central Asia with the recent membership of Tajikistan in ADB.\n\nC. \n\nCooperation in the Transport Sector\n\n6. \nThe CARs are attaching very high priority to cooperation in the transport sector because\nof the poor state of transport infrastructure to facilitate regional economic cooperation. The main\nthrusts  of  the  cooperation  are  (i)  developing  the  east-west  corridor  along  the  Silk  Road\nconnecting  the  Far  East  with  Europe,  and  the  north-south  corridor  linking  the  Indian\nsubcontinent  with  Russia;  (ii)  developing  adequate  transport  infrastructure  links  to  permit\nexploitation of the rich natural resources of Central Asia; (iii) linking major centers of economic\nactivity,  population,  and  tourist  destination;  and  (iv)  helping  develop  remote  and  low-income\nareas.\n\nIn addition to helping the CARs to improve the road infrastructure in line with the above\n7. \npriority,  ADB  has  assisted  them  in  undertaking  sector  reforms  that  are  well  coordinated,  and\ndeveloping  standards  and  specifications  that  are  responsive  to  the  needs  of  market-oriented\neconomies  to  permit  the  introduction  of  performance-based  specifications  and  encourage  the\ntransfer  of  productivity-enhancing  technologies.  The  bilingual  (Russian/English)  Public Motor\nRoads: Design Standards and Regulations and Public Motor Roads: Construction Specifications\nwere  prepared  under  ADB\u2019s  TA4  for  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia,  and  Uzbekistan.\nThe standards are expected to make important contributions to the introduction of road design\nbased  on  economy  and  efficiency,  and  creation  of  an  opportunity  for  the  private  sector  to\nparticipate in the road sector. This principle is not followed in the FSU standards because such\nstandards were developed for operations on a force account basis aimed at efficient utilization\nof State-owned resources (input-based), and had the force of law.\n\n8. \n The development of technical standards has been difficult because of their bearing on\nthe  education  system.    Therefore,  the  integration  of  the  FSU  and  western  standards  was\ntechnically  difficult.  Considering  the  difficulties  in  developing  such  standards,  and  to  carry\nthrough  the  benefits  of  the  TA  to  other  countries  in  the  region,  the  standards  have  been\ndistributed to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.\n\n  The Road Safety Guidelines for the Asian and Pacific Region,  which  was  developed\n9. \nunder ADB\u2019s regional TA5 aims to provide a source of reference and guidelines and introduce a\nconcept of coordinated road safety initiatives. Road safety is a multidimensional social problem\ninvolving  many  sectors:  education,  health,  police,  and  transport  as  well  as  the  private  sector\ninvolved in insurance, fuel supply, and bus and freight transport operations. The activities have\nto  be  complementary  and  coordinated  among  the  sectors  and  countries  of  the  region  so  that\nroad  safety  measures  can  be  optimized  to  avoid  loss  of  resources  on  account  of  vehicle\ndamage, medical treatment, police and administration costs, and damage to road facilities.

The\ninitial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared under TA 2632-KAZ and Loan 1444-KGZ\nin  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  \u2018s  (ADB\u2019s)  Environmental  Assessment\nRequirements  and  Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects.  The  SIEE\npresents  the  data,  findings,  and  recommendations  of  the  IEE  as  well  as  the  results  of  ADB\u2019s\ninvestigations during project processing.\n\nThe  IEE  was  prepared  in  a  number  of  steps.  First,  secondary  data  and  reports  on\n2.\nrelevant  previous  projects  were  analyzed. \nIn  addition,  discussions  were  held  with\nrepresentatives of the local environment authorities and of the road design institutes responsible\nfor the detailed engineering design. Second, the data collected for the Project (e.g. geological,\nsocial, and environmental baseline data) were reviewed. Third, field investigations assessed the\npresent  condition  of  the  environment  along  the  project  road.  Fourth,  possible  environmental\nimpacts  were  estimated,  and  mitigating  measures  were  selected  and  planned  to  minimize  the\nadverse effects expected during and after construction.\n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Project\n\n3.\nThe  Project  entails  the  rehabilitation  of  the  Almaty-Bishkek  road.  The  project  road\npasses  through  varied  terrain,  valleys,  high  mountains  and  mountain  passes,  agricultural\n(farmland  and  grazing  grounds)  and  nonagricultural  lands  and  areas  of  low  and  medium\npopulation density.\n\nRoad rehabilitation will be carried out on the existing alignment, except at two sections\n4.\n(total  length  of  12  kilometers  [km])  in  the  mountainous  areas  of  Kurday  Pass  in  Kazakhstan.\nRehabilitation  will  include  minor  widening,  removal  and  replacement  of  some  layers  of  road\nstructure, and improvement of drainage systems. The land that will be affected by the needed\nroad realignment is currently not used due to its mountainous character and can be classified as\nwasteland.  In  the  sections  where  some  widening  will  occur  (e.g.,  to  improve  drainage\nstructures), the existing road right-of-way provides sufficient space for the needed improvement,\nand  no  permanent  impacts  are  expected  on  land  and  other  assets  along  the  road.  No\nresettlement effects in terms of both housing and nonhousing relocation are expected.\n\n5.\nThe borrow areas and quarries, construction and labor camps, road haulage, and road\ndiversions  will  have  some  temporary  impacts  during  project  construction.  Although  no  severe\nand  permanent  environmental  impacts  are  expected  as  a  result  of  the  road  rehabilitation,\nattention must be given to good practice during the different stages of project planning, design,\nand implementation to prevent any adverse impacts.\n\nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n1. \n\nPhysical and Agricultural Resources\n\nThe  Kazakh  section  of  the  project  road  is  situated  in  the  two  regions  of  Almaty  and\n6.\nZhambul.  Kurday  Mountain  is  situated  in  the  latter.  This  is  part  of  the  Alatou  mountain,  which\nextends  as  a  ridge  with  decreasing  elevation  from  east  to  west  near  the  border  between\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\nKazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  where  the  Project  road  crosses  Kurday  mountain  pass.\nThis acts as a major regional watershed.\n\n7.\nThe  perennial  and  nonperennial  streams  flowing  south  of  the  mountain  pass  have\nproduced five types of landform: (i) rugged mountain with thin soil cover and high rate of water\nloss  by  runoff;  (ii)  alluvial  fans  at  the  foot  of  the  mountain  formed  of  unsorted  grain  size\nmaterials,  leading  to  rapid  loss  of  water;  (iii)  amphitheater-shaped  undulating  river  basins;  (iv)\nflat plains along the median river made of materials of homogenous size, which lead to impeded\ndrainage; and (v) terraces formed of extremely fine-grained silt, which act as local watersheds.\nThe project road in the southern part of the Kazakhstan section traverses all these five types.\n\n8.\nGiven  the  above  physical  characteristics,  special  attention  should  be  paid  to  the\nconstruction  of  a  large  number  of  cross  drainage  structures  and  to  the  protection  of  the  road\nfrom  erosion  from  the  parallel  flowing  streams  especially  in  its  mountainous  areas.  The\nsustained  erosion  is  also  due  to  the  very  ancient  age  of  the  rock  geology.  Major  climatic\nchanges take place especially during the winter season. A long winter period is characterized by\nvery rigid temperatures manifested by freezing and thawing of surface water and groundwater,\nspring floods, snow, and dust and hail storms. The remaining part- the less mountainous area-\nof  the  environment  along  the  project  road  is  cultivated,  and  wheat  and  grain  are  grown  with\nlimited irrigation. The alluvial fans support orchards and vegetable fields in Almaty region. Many\nflat, nonirrigated areas are used for animal grazing and fodder.\n\n9.\nThe  Kyrgyz  section  of  the  road  is  located  entirely  in  the  northern  half  of  the\nadministrative district of Alamedin within Chui region. The area surrounding the road is mainly\nflat  and  intensively  cultivated.  Grain,  sugar  beet,  potatoes,  vegetables,  and  milk  represent  the\nmain  agricultural  products  cultivated.    The  climate  is  continental,  but  quite  variable  due  to  the\ndifferences  in  altitude.  Precipitation  varies  considerably,  being  highest  in  the  mountains  and\nlowest in the valleys. It rains mainly during the cold season, which means that on the mountains\nthe major part of the precipitation is snow. East of the project road many mineral resources and\nthermal  springs  can  be  found.  In  particular,  around  Lake  Issyk-Kul,  medicinal  mud  and  other\nnatural  resources  attract  many  tourists  especially  during  summer.  Erosion  is  among  the  most\nsignificant  environmental  problems  in  the  country.  It  represents  a  threat  to  the  physical  and\nbiological environment, affecting 25 percent of the total land available for farming and grazing.\n\n10.\nThere  are  no  designated  wetlands,  forests,  nature  conservation  areas,  and  places  of\narchaeological  importance  within  the  study  area.  Trees  are  planted  along  the  road  in  many\nsections  and  provide  useful  protection  against  embankment  erosion  as  well  as  against  noise\nand dust for the settlements traversed by the project road.\n\n2. \n\nSocioeconomic Environment\n\n11.\nThe project road will connect 37 settlements on the Kazakhstan road corridor. Of these,\nonly  four  are  crossed  by  the  road  (i.e.,  Samsy,  Targap,  Alga,  and  Georgievka).  The  primary\nsector provides employment in the settlements of Samsy, Targap and Alga, while in Almaty City,\nKaskelen (2.3 km from the project road), and Georgievka, the industrial and service sectors are\nalso developed. The Kazakhstan portion of the project influence area (PIA) has a population of\nabout 3.7 million people (1998). This area contributed to approximately 25 percent of the total\nvalue added produced in the country in 1997.\n \n12.\nIn the Kyrgyz Republic, the project road traverses Chui region and the Alamedin district\n(110,000 people in 1998). The 11 settlements found along the road have a total population of\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 13, page 3\n\n80,000. Chui region had a population of approximately 765,000 people in 1998. In that year, the\nregion  produced  36  percent  of  the  industrial  activity  of  the  country,  31  percent  of  the  national\nagricultural  production  (i.e.,  wheat,  barley,  dairy  products,  fruits,  and  vegetables),  and  57\npercent  of  the  exports  (i.e.,  agricultural,  agroprocessing,  construction,  and  light  industry\nproducts).\n\nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\nTo determine the depth of environmental study required for the Project, screening used\n13.\nthe checklist of ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Project. Using such\ncriteria as type, sensitivity of the environment, and magnitude of impact, a scale was designed\nto  identify  the  potentially  significant  adverse  impacts.  The  impacts  were  also  separated  into\ntemporary  and  permanent.  Mitigation  measures  were  identified  and  recommended  when\nadverse  environmental  impacts  were  considered  unavoidable.  Distinction  was  also  made\nbetween the impacts associated with project construction and those with project operation.\n\nThe  results  of  the  environmental  examination  show  no  significant  potential  adverse\n14.\nimpacts  from  the  Project.  However,  several  cost-effective  practices,  especially  during  project\nconstruction, can reduce and/or avoid small-scale impacts due to road rehabilitation.\n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Problems due to Project Location\n\n15.\nThe  road  will  be  rehabilitated  along  the  existing  alignment  with  the  exception  of  two\nsections  (total  length  of  12  km)  in  the  mountainous  area  of  Kurday  Pass.  The  area  to  be\naffected  by  the  realignment  of  the  project  road  is  currently  wasteland:  it  is  not  used  for\nresidence,  cultivation,  or  other  activities.  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  cause  resettlement  of\nhouses and/or any negative impact on land and other assets. In addition, no negative impacts\non  women  or  vulnerable  groups  are  foreseen.  Overall,  the  population  living  along  the  road  is\nexpected to benefit from the road rehabilitation in the medium and long term through additional\njob opportunities created in the construction phase and the expected economic growth induced\nby a more efficient national and international transport system.\n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Problems Related to Design\n\n16.\nMany  of  the  environmental  problems  associated  with  road  rehabilitation,  maintenance,\nand traffic will be taken care of starting from the engineering design stage. An engineer trained\nin environmental engineering will be responsible for considering cost-effective practices to avoid\nadverse environmental impacts in the detailed design and will be in charge of the environmental\nquality of the design. Measures related to traffic safety issues, soil erosion, drainage structures,\nwater flows and systems, location and restoration of quarries and borrow areas, establishment\nof construction camps, road haulage and diversions, and maintenance of approach roads will be\nincluded in the design.\n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Problems Associated with the Construction Stage\n\nThe  potential  impacts  during  project  construction  are  grouped  by  environmental/social\n\n17.\ncomponent.\n\na.\n\nLand Resources and Soil Erosion. Land borrow will be necessary for storage\nof  construction  materials,  establishment  of  construction  camps,  and  road\ndiversion.  Along  the  road  the  embankments  provide  some  space  in  most  areas\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 13, page 4\n\nfor  both  purposes.  However,  where  more  land  is  required  the  contractor  will\nselect wasteland areas to reduce any negative impacts on the nearby residential\nareas  and  assets.  To  avoid  permanent  impacts,  the  land  temporarily  occupied\nwill  be  restored  as  soon  as  construction  in  that  section  is  completed,  and  the\nsurface will be rehabilitated to at least its original state to allow the uses, if any,\npreviously  made  of  it.  The  same  criteria,  i.e.  minimize  disruption  to  the\nresidential,  farmland,  industrial  areas,  and  restoration  through  backfilling,\nlandscaping,  regeneration  of  vegetation,  and  planting  trees,  will  be  applied  to\nquarries,  borrow  areas,  and  asphalt  and  crushing  plants.  Several  mitigation\nmeasures  will  be  employed  to  prevent  any  aggravation,  especially  at  the\nconstruction  stage, \ninclude\n(i) preparing,  re-vegetating,  and  reforesting  exposed  areas  (slopes)  upon\ncompletion  of  the  earthworks;  (ii)  building  ditches  and  culverts  in  appropriate\nlocations; and (iii) building retaining walls to prevent landslides where slopes are\nvery steep. These  measures will be monitored weekly as part of the monitoring\nplan.\n\nthe  soil  erosion-prone  areas.  These  will \n\nin \n\nfluids \n\nWater  Resources:  Discharges  of  sewage  and  other  waste \nfrom\nconstruction  camps  and  asphalt  and  crushing  plants,  and  of  other  construction\nmaterials will need to be prevented. To mitigate these potential impacts, all labor\ncamps  will  be  equipped  with  appropriate  sanitation  facilities  for  liquid  and  solid\nwastes.  Standard  precautions  will  also  be  taken  in  the  use  and  storage  of\nhazardous  materials,  including  storage  away  from  waterways,  oil  separation\nfacilities,  and  other  measures  to  avoid  accidental  spills.  Dumping  of  spoils\ndirectly  in  the  waterways  and  drainage  system  will  not  be  permitted.  The\ndrainage  system  will  need  as  well  to  be  maintained  to  avoid  pollution  spillage,\nespecially  during  thunderstorms  and  winter  periods.  The  contractor  will  ensure\nthe  implementation  of  appropriate  waste  disposal  and  wastewater  treatment\nmeasures during construction. As part of the monitoring plan, the contractor will\ncontrol  daily  solid  waste  disposal,  spillage  of  fluids,  and  drainage  structures\nduring  construction.  These  last,  together  with  water  courses  and  flows,  will  be\nfully restored after rehabilitation of the relevant road sections and monitored after\nproject completion.\n\nBiological  Resources:  Many  sections  of  the  road  are  delimited  by  trees.  To\navoid permanent impacts, the contractor should reduce any effects on the trees.\nWhere  the  trees  are  affected,  proper  restoration  and  vegetation  are  required.\nReplanting of trees will be monitored weekly until the vegetation grows steadily;\nspecial attention will be given to erosion-prone areas. Grazing grounds along the\nroad  are  common  and  any  disturbance  to  animals  and  pastures  should  be\navoided.\n\nAir  Quality  and  Noise:  Noise  and  pollution  associated  with  road  rehabilitation\nworks should be minimized by avoiding movement of construction equipment in\nresidential  areas.  Dust  and  emissions  from  plant  and  equipment  will  also  be\nminimized and closely monitored through dust control devices and water sprays.   \n\nApproach Roads: Secondary roads in the surroundings of the project road will\nbe  used  for  haulage  of  construction  materials  and  for  traffic  diverted  during\nconstruction. To mitigate the potential negative impacts due to excess traffic and\noverloading,  the  contractor  in  collaboration  with  the  EA  will  ensure  that  the\n\nb.\n\nc.\n\nd.\n\ne.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 13, page 5\n\napproach roads receive appropriate maintenance and their conditions monitored\non a weekly basis.\n\nf.\n\nHealth  Prevention:  The  influx  of  a  large  number  of  workers  involved  in  the\nrehabilitation  works  could  increase  the  spread  of  communicable  and  infectious\ndiseases in the project area. Adequate health training on the prevention of these\ndiseases will be provided as part of the safety training compulsory for the entire\nworkforce.\n\n18.\nAll  measures,  practices,  and  activities  necessary  to  prevent  the  adverse\nenvironmental impacts will be carefully detailed and specified in the contract documents. Heavy\npenalties  will  also  be  included  as  a  deterrent.  Furthermore,  the  engineer  in  charge  of\nenvironmental  monitoring  will  be  assigned  specific  responsibilities  and  ensure  that  the\nrequirements indicated in the preceding paras. for each environmental component are met in a\ntimely manner.\n\n4. \n\nEnvironmental Problems During Project Operations\n\n19.\nAfter  project  completion,  no  significant  impacts  are  expected  unless  the  mitigation\nmeasures  indicated  during  the  construction  phase  is  not  undertaken  as  planned  and  properly\nmonitored.  However,  the  increased  traffic,  vehicle  speed,  noise,  pollution,  and  effects  on  road\nsafety  will  need  to  be  taken  into  account  starting  from  project  design  so  as  to  minimize  their\nmagnitude. The rehabilitated road will be maintained with the help of contractors. The contracts\nwill include conditions and measures that will enhance environmental sustainability.\n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\n20.\nIn  Kazakhstan,  environmental  monitoring,  coordination,  and  implementation  of  policies\nand legislation are carried out by the Ministry of Ecology and Bioresources (MEB) at the national\nlevel and with the help of its Departments of Ecology and Bioresources (DEBs) at the regional\nlevel.  The  IEE  indicated  that  the  institutional  setup  existing  in  the  country  for  environmental\nmonitoring  and  reporting  is  adequate.  DEBs  closely  monitor  the  environmental  impacts  at\ndifferent stages of the implementation of projects. The DEBs of Almaty and Zhambul regions will\nbe  closely  associated  with  the  implementation  of  the  Project.  In  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  the\nMinistry  of  Environmental  Protection  (MEP)  is  responsible  for  environmental  policy  and\nregulations,  and  monitoring.  Since  Chui  region,  where  the  Project  road  is  located,  is  on  the\nBishkek  township  boundary,  the  MEP  will  directly  monitor  the  environmental  impacts  during\nimplementation and operation of the Kyrgyz portion of the project road.\n\n21.\nPrior  to  the  formal  acceptance  of  the  construction  works,  a  full  examination  of  the\ncontractors\u2019  compliance  with  the  specifications  relating  to  environmental  provisions  should  be\nundertaken.  The  examination  will  include  verification  of  the  required  clean-up  activities,\nrestoration  of  all  temporary  works  sites,  landscaping,  planting,  and  reinstatement  of  drainage\nstructures.\n\n22.\nAfter  project  completion,  the  government  maintenance  supervisors  along  with  region\nenvironment  authorities  will  be  in  charge  of  environmental  monitoring  of  the  project  area  at\nregular  intervals.  The  maintenance  contractors  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  measures\nrelating  to  social,  environmental  and  road  safety  aspects,  for  which  proper  maintenance\ncontracts  with  terms  and  conditions  and  manuals  will  be  prepared  by  the  project  supervision\nconsultants.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 13, page 6\n\nF. \n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n23.\nThe IEE clearly indicates that the majority of the impacts resulting from the rehabilitation\nof the project road are not expected to be significant provided that the recommendations set out\nbelow are complied  with.  Accordingly, there is no need to prepare a full environmental impact\nassessment for this Project.\n\n24.\n\nThe following recommendations result from the IEE:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe design of the rehabilitated road will be followed and all major changes that\noccur  should  be  considered  in  terms  of  the  associated  potential  environmental\nimpacts.\n\nThe designs will make full provision for the incorporation of the various mitigation\nmeasures indicated in paras. 17-19.\n\nContract  documents  will  include,  but  will  not  be  limited  to,  all  the  appropriate\nclauses to cover the environmental protection requirements listed in para. 24.\n\nThrough  loan  covenants,  provision  will  be  made  for  adequate  maintenance  for\nthe project road and the approach roads.\n\nClose monitoring of the critical activities that have environmental impacts during\nproject construction and operation should be undertaken.\n\nG. \n\nConclusions\n\n25.\nIt  is  concluded  that  the  potential  negative  environmental  impacts  of  rehabilitating  the\nAlmaty-Bishkek  road  can  be  mitigated  to  insignificant  levels,  and  the  Executing  Agencies  will\nensure  that  the  recommended  mitigating  measures  contained  in  the  summary  IEE  and  sound\nengineering  design  and  practice  will  be  undertaken  to  minimize  the  impacts.  A  full-scale\nenvironmental assessment is not required.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 14, page 1\n\nSUMMARY SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction\n\nThis summary social impact assessment (SSIA) concerns the proposed Almaty-Bishkek\n1.\nRegional Road Rehabilitation Project in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. The initial social\nassessment  (ISA)  was  prepared  under  TA  2632-KAZ  and  Loan  1444-KGZ.  The  SSIA  reflects\nthe results of the ISA; additional secondary data collected for the project influence area (PIA);\ndiscussions  with  representatives  of  both  central  and  local  governments  and  non-government\nagencies  in  charge  of  social  and  transport  sectors,  international  organizations,  transport\nassociations, and with the residents of the project area during interviews and public meetings.\nOn  the  basis  of  the  information  gathered,  the  social  impacts  related  to  the  Project  were\nidentified.  In  addition,  mitigation  measures  for  adverse  effects  during  project  construction  and\noperation were recommended.\n\nB. \n\nEconomic Activities in the Project Influence Area\n\n2.\nThe  PIA  consists  of  Almaty  City,  and  the  two  regions  of  Almaty  and  Zhambul  in  the\nKazakhstan  portion  of  the  road,  and  of  Chui  region  (including  Bishkek  City)  in  the  Kyrgyz\nsection. The total population in the PIA is about 4.5 million (1998), of whom approximately 3.7\nmillion are in Kazakhstan and 800,000 are in the Kyrgyz territory. Excluding Bishkek and Almaty\nCity, up to 70 percent of the population in the PIA is rural. On the Kazakhstan road corridor are\n37 settlements, but only 4 are crossed by the road (Samsy, Targap, Alga, and Georgievka). The\nproject road in the Kyrgyz Republic traverses the northern half of the Alamedin district (110,000\npeople  in  1998)  within  Chui  region,  and  serves  11  settlements  of  various  dimensions  (80,000\npeople).\n\n3.\nThe  primary  sector  (e.g.,  cattle,  poultry,  milk,  eggs,  grains,  fruits,  and  vegetables)\nprovides  employment  in  the  settlements  of  Samsy,  Targap,  and  Alga;  in  Almaty  City,  Almaty\nregion, and Georgievka, the industrial and service sectors (e.g., mining, agroprocessing, textile\nand mechanic industries) are also developed. This area contributed to approximately 25 percent\nof the total value added produced in the Republic of Kazakhstan in 1997. In particular, Almaty\nCity  contributed  more  than  16  percent  of  it,  and  Almaty  and  Zhambul  regions  around  6  and  3\npercent, respectively. \n\n4.\nIn  1998,  Chui  region  produced  36  percent  of  the  industrial  (e.g.,  nonferrous  metal\nproducts,  manufactured  goods,  and  construction  materials)  and  31  percent  of  the  agricultural\nproducts  (e.g.,  wheat,  sugar  beet,  barley,  dairy  products,  fruits,  and  vegetables)  in  the  Kyrgyz\nRepublic.  In  the  same  year,  57  percent  of  the  country\u2019s  total  exports  came  from  Chui  region\n(e.g., cement, granite, marble).\n\nC. \n\nLiving Conditions in the Project Influence Area\n\n5.\nWith  respect  to  the  average  income  per  capita  per  month  in  the  PIA,  Almaty  and\nZhambul regions had the lowest levels across all regions in Kazakhstan (about T1,750 or less\nthan $25), while the average income recorded for Almaty City (T5,369 or $71) was significantly\nhigher than the national average (T2,849 or $38) in 1997. In the Kyrgyz Republic, the average\nincome per capita for Chui region was Som629 ($36) per month in 1997, which is considerably\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 14, page 2\n\nhigher than the national monthly average Som374 ($21), and only slightly lower than the value\nrecorded for Bishkek (Som684 or $39).1\n\n6. \n\nThe data in Table A14.1 provide information on living standards in the PIA\n\nTable A14.1: Indicators of Living Standards in the PIA (1998 data)\n\nItem\n\nKazakhstan\n\nAlmaty\nCity\n5,369\n(Tenge)\n84\n\nAlmaty\nRegion\n1,628\n(Tenge)\n25\n\nZhambul\nRegion\n1,875\n(Tenge)\n25\n\nKyrgyz\nRepublic\n374\n(Som)\n20\n\nBishkek\n\n684\n(Som)\n69\n\nChui\nRegion\n629\n(Som)\n19\n\n99\n\n41\n\n49\n\n59\n\n86\n\n51\n\n52\n\n39\n\n29\n\n98\n\n35\n\n77\n\n31\n\n41\n\n65\n\n24\n\n3.7\n\n2,849\n(Tenge)\n49\n\nAverage monthly\n(money) income p.c.\nHouseholds with\ncentral heating (%)\nHouseholds with\nsewerage (%)\nHouseholds with\naccess to water (%)\nHouseholds with\ntelephones (%)\nOfficially registered\nunemployment (%),\n1998 data\nAverage family size\n(persons), 1998 data\nDeaths under 1 year\nof age per 1,000 live\nbirths, 1998 data\nFertility rates\n(live births per 1,000\npeople), 1998 data\nLife expectancy\nat birth (years)\n(male/female)\np.c. = per capita, PIA = project influence area.\nSources: Goskomstat for Kazakhstan, and National Statistics Committee for the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\n63/71\n\n60/70\n\n60/71\n\n59/70\n\n62/72\n\n1.8\n\n4.6\n\n3.1\n\n1.6\n\n2.5\n\n3.8\n\n3.5\n\n4.7\n\n60\n\n25\n\n27\n\n19\n\n15\n\n22\n\n16\n\n15\n\n12\n\n29\n\n22\n\n14\n\n17\n\n11\n\n4\n\n3.6\n\n3.8\n\n20\n\n99\n\n24\n\n2.8\n\n4.0\n\n20\n\n14\n\n63/72\n\n62/72\n\n7.\nIn  Kazakhstan,  Russians  represented  the  first  ethnic  group  by  order  of  magnitude  in\nAlmaty  City  and  the  second  in  the  two  regions  of  the  PIA  in  1998.  In  Almaty  and  Zhambul\nregions,  Kazakhs  are  the  largest  ethnic  group,  followed  by  Russians,  Ukrainians,  Tatars,  and\nGermans. In the Kyrgyz Republic in 1998, Kyrgyz and Russian nationals represented 41 and 35\npercent  of  the  population  in  Chui  region,  and  62  and  15  percent  of  the  national  population,\nrespectively.\n\n8.\nThe  official  unemployment  rates  in  Table  A14.1  refer  only  to  the  percentage  of  the\neconomically active population registered with the state employment service, and hence eligible\nfor  the  unemployment  subsidy.  In  late  1996,  the  extent  of  \u201creal\u201d  unemployment  in  the  Kyrgyz\nRepublic, as measured by a World Bank survey of 2,000 households, was around 13 percent,\nand  varied  from  18  to  21.4  percent  between  the  rural  and  urban  areas.  Disaggregated  by\ngender, the unemployment rate was 14 percent for men and around 12 percent for women. The\nhousehold  survey  also  indicated  that  out  of  the  sampled  unemployed  population,  around  72\npercent  had  been  unemployed  for  more  than  12  months.  In  Kazakhstan,  a  survey  by  the\nEconomic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific  of  10  settlements  in  Almaty  region\nrecorded  an  unemployment  rate  of  15  percent  in  1998.  The  decline  in  employment  recorded\n\n                  \n\n1   The  income  data  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  are  the  results  of  a  household  survey  carried  out  for  2,010  families  in\n\nautumn 1997 as part of the poverty monitoring program.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 14, page 3\n\nbetween 1985 and 1995 in Almaty City (28 percent), Almaty region (36 percent), and Zhambul\n(28 percent) was higher than the one experienced in the Republic as a whole (26 percent).\n\n9.\nTraveling  along  the  project  road  shows  how  the  crisis  after  independence  has  strongly\ntouched  the  PIA.  Many  of  the  industrial  and  agroprocessing  plants  along  the  road  look\nabandoned and unemployment remains the main issue of concern in the regions traversed by\nthe Project. Surveys in the PIA indicated that, in 1997, up to 50 percent of the total expenditure\nper  household  was  on  food,  about  14  percent  on  services,  and  approximately  30  percent  on\nnonfood products. Informal sector activities like kiosks, bars, restaurants, small trading activities,\nand repair shops are numerous along the project road, but the business is far from enough to\nallow for the necessary household income in most cases.\n\nD. \n\nProject Beneficiaries and Project Impacts\n\n10.\nGiven the main sectors of activity in the PIA and the living conditions of the population,\nthe rehabilitation of the project road is expected to have significant positive effects on both the\nnational  and  regional  economies.  The  rehabilitation  of  the  road  will  improve  the  movement  of\ngoods and people during the winter months by improving road safety and road conditions in the\nmountainous  area  of  Kurday  Pass.  Currently,  drivers,  including  professional  truck  drivers  and\ntransport  operators,  reduce  substantially  the  number  of  trips  from  Almaty  to  Bishkek  during\nwinter (up to 4 months) because of the poor and dangerous road conditions in the Kurday area.\nThe  rehabilitation  of  the  road  will  reduce  trading  and  transportation  difficulties  experienced\nduring the winter season, and enhance these activities as well as the industrial, agricultural, and\ncommercial businesses located along the road and in the PIA as a whole.\n\n11.\nApart  from  the  rehabilitation  of  the  road,  the  Project  aims  to  improve  the  customs\nprocedures  at  the  (Georgievka)  border  between  the  two  republics.  At  present,  transporting\ncargoes across the borders can take from a minimum of five hours to a maximum of two days\nbecause of customs clearance and related procedures. The streamlining of customs procedures\nwithin  each  country  and  between  the  two  republics,  is  expected  to  reduce  substantially  the\nwaiting time at the borders for traded goods and to induce a more efficient trading corridor for\npeople, goods, and services.\n\n12.\nIn  terms  of  job  opportunities,  the  Project  will  have  a  very  significant  positive  impact\nespecially during construction. In the Kyrgyz Republic, the contractor will be local, therefore, an\nincrease  in  job  opportunities  for  local  skilled  and  unskilled  workers  is  expected.  Since  in  both\ncountries  there  is  no  shortage  of  highly  skilled  and  qualified  workers  among  the  unemployed\npopulation,  it  is  envisaged  that  unemployment  in  the  area  will  be  reduced  during  project\nconstruction.  From  the  data  on  the  ongoing  Road  Rehabilitation  Project in  Kazakhstan,  it  is\nestimated that the project road will entail up to 800 jobs per month for skilled, semiskilled and\nunskilled  workers  in  the  construction  season.  Indirect  employment  associated  with  the  Project\nby  way  of  provision  of  supply  of  goods  and  services  (e.g.,  service  stations,  canteens,  kiosks,\nand bars) will also play a considerable role.\n\nTable A14.2 presents the different groups of Project beneficiaries, the social impacts of\n\n13.\nthe Project and the recommended measures to minimize adverse impacts.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 14, page 4\n\nTable A14.2: Identification of Project Beneficiaries, Impacts, and Mitigation Measures\n\nBeneficiaries\n1.

Meetings with the drivers\u2019 union association and with the council of transport operators in\nboth countries indicated that safety was their main concern during the winter months and that\naccidents  were  a  major  cost  for  their  activities.  The  need  for  more  organized  service  stations\nalong the road and dissatisfaction with customs procedures and waiting time at the Georgievka\nborder were also expressed.\n\nF.\n\nGender Issues\n\n16.\nTraditionally,  women  are  not  involved  in  unskilled/manual  construction  jobs  in  the  PIA.\nHowever,  representatives  of  gender  bureaus  in  both  countries  pointed  out  that  women  form  a\nlarge part of the skilled unemployed population (e.g., engineers and surveyors) and could avail\nof job opportunities arising in these technical fields.3 Furthermore, surveys carried out by these\noffices in Almaty and Chui regions show that up to 40 percent of the surveyed women are active\nin  trading  activities  and  could  benefit  from  the  increased  traffic  and  related  business\nopportunities along the project road.\n\n                  \n\n2   In Kazakhstan, these meetings included public forums facilitated by the governors or deputy governors of Almaty\nCity,  Kaskelen,  and  Uzunagach;  and  unofficial  meetings  and  interviews  in  Samsy  and  Targap.    In  the  Kyrgyz\nRepublic, meetings were held with the governor of Chui region and the deputy governor of Alamedin district.\n\n3   In  Kazakhstan,  consultations  were  held  with  the  Association  of  Business  Women.  In  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,\n\ndiscussions took place with the Director of the UNDP-funded Gender Bureau.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 14, page 6\n\nG.\n\nPotential Adverse Impacts\n\n17.\nNo  resettlement  effects  in  terms  of  both  housing  and  nonhousing  relocation  are\nexpected.  The  road  will  be  rehabilitated  along  its  current  alignment  with  the  exception  of  two\nsections (for an approximate total length of 12 km) in the mountainous area of Kurday Pass in\nKazakhstan. It will maintain its current number of lanes, and will be only marginally widened in\nsome areas. Where road realignment is required, the land to be affected is currently not used\ndue to the altitude and can be classified as wasteland. In the sections where some widening will\noccur (e.g., to improve drainage structures), the existing shoulders provide sufficient space for\nthe needed improvement. No permanent impacts are expected on land and other assets along\nthe road.\n\nAs  highlighted \n\nin  Table  A14.2, \n\nthe  road  rehabilitation  activities  during  project\n18.\nconstruction will have some temporary adverse impacts associated with road diversion, noise,\ndust, disruption of drainage systems, borrow areas and quarries, and the establishment of labor\ncamps. Moreover, the pressure on the existing health facilities in the PIA is expected to increase\ndue  to  the  influx  of  construction  workers  and  the  associated  greater  risk  of  diseases  (e.g.,\ncommunicable diseases) and health hazards.\n\n19.\nSpeed limits along the road will not be changed. Hence, the residents of the project area\nwill not suffer from increased traffic speed. However, as indicated by the persons interviewed,\nthe safety of the villagers and animals crossing the road is a concern, especially in settlements\nalong the road.\n\nH. \n\nMitigation Measures and Monitoring\n\n20.\nAlthough  no  severe  and/or  permanent  social  impacts  are  expected  as  a  result  of  the\nroad rehabilitation, attention must be given to good practice during the different stages of project\nplanning, design, and implementation to prevent any adverse impacts. The mitigation measures\nrecommended  in  the  summary  initial  environmental  examination  should  be  implemented  and\naccurately  monitored  in  all  stages  of  project  construction.  Moreover,  road  safety  should  be\nensured  through  fencing  and  marked  pedestrian  crossings  in  the  residential  areas  along  the\nroad.\n\n21.\nSince the influx of workers involved in the rehabilitation works could increase the spread\nof communicable and infectious diseases in the PIA, it is recommended that the EAs assist the\ncontractors in distributing information materials and providing basic training in the prevention of\nthese diseases as part of the safety training compulsory for the entire workforce.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 15, page 1\n\nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR\nIMPROVEMENT OF THE ROAD SECTOR EFFICIENCY\n\nA.\n\nBackground\n\nterms  of \n\nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic  are  committed \n\nThe  Governments  of  Kazakhstan  and \n\n(i) developing  an  efficient  policy  and \n\n1. \nto\nimplementing market-based reforms for the road transport sector, which need to be looked into\nin \n(ii)\ncorporatizing/commercializing  and,  where  appropriate,  privatizing  transport  operations  and\nentities;  (iii)  restructuring  of  Government  organizations  so  that  they  can  respond  efficiently  to\nmarket  demands;  (iv)  creating  in  the  transport  sector  an  environment  that  encourages  private\nsector  participation;  (v)  promoting  competition  in  the  provision  and  operation  of  transport\nfacilities and services; (vi) increasing funding by improving tax and duties collection, enhancing\ncost  recovery,  and  removing  subsidy-induced  distortions  in  the  pricing  of  transport  services;\n(vii) rehabilitating and improving maintenance operations and safety standards of infrastructure\nfacilities;  (viii)  developing  human  resources;  and  (ix)  protecting  the  environment  by  improving\nenvironmental standards.\n\nframework; \n\nregulatory \n\n2. \nIn Kazakhstan, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has so far focused on adopting the\nRoad Sector Policy Statement (RSPS) and undertaking measures in line with RSPS, including\nforming a Committee for Transport Sector Legal Reforms to update the existing Road Act and\nRoad Transport Act, and establishing a National Transport Advisory Committee (NTAC).\n\n3. \nThe  restructuring  and  streamlining  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  road  sector  have  been\nongoing; as a result, the Directorate General for Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Bishkek-Osh\nRoad  (DGRMBOR) was established.  Under the Automobile Road Act enacted on 2 June 1998,\nthe  responsibility  for  the  road  sector  is  streamlined  by  merging  all  road  activities  within  the\nKyrgyz Ministry of Transport and Communications (KGZMOTC). The road financing is expected\nto improve through the implementation of the Road Fund Act enacted by the Government on 1\nJune 1998 introducing, to a certain extent, the user-pay principle in road financing.\n\n4. \nConsidering  the  progress  in  both  countries,  and  keeping  in  view  the  demands  of  the\nmarket  and  the  roles  the  Governments  and  the  private  sectors  are  expected  to  play  in\neconomies in transition, the road transport\u2019s role in fostering subregional cooperation is crucial.\nThe focus of the consulting services will be to improve the efficiency and safety of the Almaty-\nBishkek  road  through  streamlining  the  cross-border  road  transport  and  customs  policy  and\nregulations and documentation, and improving the coordination and management of road safety\nin  the  corridor.  In  addition,  assistance  to  Kazakhstan  will  help  implement  market-oriented\npolicies  and  procedures  in  line  with  the  studies  carried  out  under  ADB\u2019s  technical  assistance\n(TA),  and  help  define  the  road  sector  functions  of  the  Kazakh  Ministry  of  Transport  and\nCommunications (KAZMOTC) in line with the road reforms that have been implemented or are\nproposed to be carried out in the future.\n\n5. \nThe  TA  will  comprise  three  phases:  (i)  improving  cross-border  road  transport  and\ncustoms  documentation  and  procedures,  (ii)  road  safety,  and  (iii)  policy  advisory  support  to\nKAZMOTC.\n\n6. \nThe  issues  relating  to  the  Road  Fund  and  Road  Act  have  been  covered  by  the  earlier\nADB-financed  projects.  The  consultants  are  expected  to  monitor  progress  on  those  issues  in\nfulfilling the objectives of the consulting services.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 15, page 2\n\nB.\n\nObjectives\n\n7. \nThe  advisory  TA  is  aimed  at  assisting  the  two  Governments  in  increasing  subregional\ntrade through improved road transportation between Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic.  The\nTA will consist of three phases.\n\n8. \nThe prime objectives of phase I will be to assist the two Governments to implement the\nCross-Border  Agreement,  including  formulating  long-term  strategies  for  expanded  use  of  the\nAgreement at other borders, with a view to foster regional economic cooperation.\n\n9. \nPhase  II  will  focus  on  improving  coordination  and  management  of  road  safety  in  both\ncountries,  including  coordination  with  the  project  supervision  consultants,  to  ensure  that\nmaintenance  by  contract  includes  adequate  provisions  relating  to  environmental  and  social\nmitigation measures and road safety considerations.\n\nBased on the overall reallocation of activities between the Committee of Road and Road\n10. \nTransport (CRRT) and Kazakhavtodor, phase III will streamline the ministerial and departmental\nresponsibilities, assign roles based on the redefined functions, and help implement the RSPS in\nKazakhstan.\n\n C.\n\nScope of Services\n\n11. \ndomestic will be required.1\n\nIt is estimated that consulting services of about 32 person-months international and 30\n\n1.\n\nCross Border Documentation and Procedures\n\na.\n\nTransport and Customs Documentation\n\n12. \nThe  consultants  will  review  all  existing  cross-border  documentation  and  introduce\nchanges  at  the  Akzhol/Chu  border  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  in  the  Cross-Border\nAgreement signed by Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic.\n  \n13. \nthe Akzhol/Chu border crossing:\n\nThe following minimum documentation will be introduced for vehicles transiting through\n\nFreight transport:\n\nFor the driver\n(i)\n(ii) \n\nDriving License\nPassport or Identity Card\n\nFor the vehicle\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nInternational Operating Permit\nRegistration Documents\nSpecial Permit (if necessary)\n\n                                            \n1  Kazakhstan:  22  international  and  18  domestic  consulting  services;  the  Kyrgyz  Republic:  10  international  and  12\n\ndomestic.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 15, page 3\n\nFor the goods\n(i)\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v)\n\nCargo Customs Declaration\nCargo Waybill\nCargo Shipment Control Document\nTIR  (Transport  International  Routier)  Carnet  (if  traveling  under  TIR\nconditions)\nInternational  Waybill  CMR  (Convention  Merchandise  Route)  Certificate\n(for traveling under CMR cover)\n\nPassenger transport:\n\nFor the driver\n(i)\n(ii) \n\nDriving License\nPassport or Identity Card\n\nFor the vehicle\n(i)\n(ii)\n\nRegistration Documents\nAuthorization Certificate (if regular bus service or alternative authorization\ndocument if irregular bus service)\n\n14. \n  The  inspection  at  the  Akzhol/Chu  border  will  be  limited  to  these  documents.  Drivers\nmay  be  required  to  carry  additional  support  documentation  to  enable  final  clearance  of  the\ncargo,  but  those  should  not  be  subject  to  production  at  the  border  control  zone.  To  ensure\nsmooth  and  expeditious  movement  of  traffic,  the  consultants  will  design  the  formats  for  the\nabove  documents,  which  will  be  simple  and  harmonious,  and  include  all  data  required  to\nimplement the automated customs system.\n\nb.\n\nTransport and Customs Procedures\n\n15. \n  With  the  introduction  of  the  preceding  documentation,  the  consultants  will  train  the\nKazakh and the Kyrgyz officers at the Akzhol/Chu border in the execution of modern customs\nprocedures  to  ensure  consistent  application  on  both  sides  of  the  border.  Specific  training  will\ninclude\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nprocessing of TIR carnets,\nuse of risk assessment techniques,\nvehicle inspection system, and\nuse of a computer for customs clearance.\n\n16. \n  The  consultants  will  introduce  the  Automated  Customs  Clearance  System  (ACCS)  for\nimplementation  as  a  pilot  program.  The  system  should  be  both  reliable  and  tested,  of\ninternational electronic data processing standard, and  allow external input through direct trader\ninput  linkages.    The  consultants  will  introduce  computerized  cargo  registration  with  possible\nlinkage with a centralized ACCS.\n\nThe  consultants  will  review  all  the  bilateral  and  multilateral  agreements  with  similar\n17. \nobjectives  that  are  in  effect  or  binding  on  Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  identify\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 15, page 4\n\nconflicting provisions with regard to the CBA, and recommend revisions, if necessary, to eliminate\nsuch conflicts and ensure a smooth implementation of the CBA.\n\n18. \nBased  on  the  implementation  of  the  revised  documentation  and  procedures  at  the\nAkzhol/Chu  border,  the  consultants  will  recommend  strategies  to  implement  the  Cross-Border\nAgreement  with  other  neighboring  countries,  particularly  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,\nRussia  and  Uzbekistan  to  facilitate  and  promote  regional  trade  through  efficient  movement  of\ngoods, luggage, and passengers.\n\n2.\n\nRoad Safety\n\n19. \n  Road  safety  is  a  multidimensional  social  problem  involving  many  sectors:  education,\nhealth, police, and transport as well as the private sector involved in insurance, fuel supply, and\nbus and freight transport operations. The activities have to be complementary and coordinated so\nthat the road safety measures to avoid loss of current resources on account of vehicle damage,\nmedical  treatment,  police  and  administration  costs,  and  damage  to  the  street  furniture  can  be\nundertaken.  Such coordination can be achieved only through the establishment of the national\nroad safety council (NRSC).\n \n20. \nThe  Government\u2019s  role  in  improving  road  safety  should  consist  of  three  elements:  legal\nframework,  safety  education,  and  maintenance  of  a  traffic  safety  plan.  The  consultants  will\nprepare the road safety acts (RSAs) for Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic.  The main purpose\nof  the  RSA  is  to  safeguard  the  interests  of  the  road  users  with  regard  to  road  safety  standards\nand practices, and to establish a legal basis for the establishment of NRSCs.\n\n21. \n\nThe road safety component will include the following tasks:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nreviewing  existing  legislation  and  prosecution  patterns  to  identify  the\nareas  that  need  revision  and  drafting  RSAs  for  both  the  countries.  The\nRSAs will define the functions and responsibilities of various government\nsectors  (education,  health,  police,  and  transport)  and  private  companies\n(insurance,  fuel,  bus  and  freight  transport)  involved  in  road  safety.  The\nRSAs will include legislation concerning safe driving,2 safety audit of the\nroad  designs,  safety  education,  road  safety  publicity,  vehicle  safety\nstandards,  road  safety  research,  and  emergency  assistance  to  accident\nvictims;\n\nassisting in the establishment of the multidisciplinary NRSC in the Kyrgyz\nRepublic  with  a  full-time  secretariat,  and    defining  functions  and\nresponsibilities;\n\ntranslating  the  Road  Safety  Guidelines  prepared  under  ADB\u2019sTA  5620-\nREG3  and  conducting  seminars  familiarizing  NRSCs  and  the  concerned\nsector representatives with the provisions of the guidelines;\n\n                                            \n2 Safe driving considerations, among others, include drunk-driving limits and enforcement, speed zones and speed\n\nenforcement, seat belt and helmet regulations, motor insurance policies, and driver training and testing.\n\n3 Regional Initiatives in Road Safety, for $600,000, approved on 4 January 1995.\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 15, page 5\n\n(iv) \n\nundertaking a statistical analysis of road accident records in the Almaty-\nBishkek  road  and  identifying  underlying  factors  influencing  safety  on  the\nroad  (with specific attention to winter accidents), with a view to include in\nthe  maintenance  contract  the  provisions  for  maintaining  all  safety\nmeasures  (e.g.  signposts,  road  markings,  etc.)  and  environmental  and\nsocial  impact  mitigation  measures,  and  of  the  liabilities  thereof  if  the\ncontractor fails to implement the measures; and\n\n(v) \n\nreviewing the draft contracts prepared by the supervision consultants and\nproviding inputs relating to road safety as a result of the findings from the\naccident statistical analysis.\n\nThe  road  maintenance  contract  should  be  seen  as  the  way  to  improving  road  safety,\n22. \nwhere  competition  and  threat  of  legal  action  would  raise  safety  standards.  The  consultants  will\ncoordinate with the construction supervision consultants so that road safety provisions, and also\nenvironmental  and  social  impact  mitigation  requirements  are  incorporated  in  the  provisions  of\nmaintenance by contract.\n\n3. \n\nAdvisory Support to KAZMOTC\n\nThe  advisory  TA  to  the  transport  sector  will  be  provided,  with  the  help  of  the  transport\n23. \nadviser, to assist the minister and senior personnel of the Ministry of Transport, Communications\nand Tourism to adopt market-oriented policies and laws and regulations, and help in defining the\nroad  sector  functions  of  KAZMOTC  in  line  with  the  road  reforms  that  have  taken  place  or  are\nproposed to be carried out in future.\n\n24. \n\n The transport advisor will assist in the following areas:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\ndefine  KAZMOTC's  role,  objectives,  and  its  relationship  with  CRRT,  its\ndepartments, and transport operators in transition to a market economy in\nline with the policy framework adopted through the RSPS and consistent\nwith  the  pace  of  reforms  that  have  taken  place  so  far  and  have  been\nproposed for the future, and update the Automobiles Road Act;\n\nassist in implementing the provisions in the RSPS;\n\nadopt  transport  regulations  that  promote  equitable  competition  among\ntransport  modes  (e.g.,  between  road  and  rail)  and  help  develop  private\ntransport  operators  while  assisting  the  Government  in  the  promotion  of\nsafe and environmentally acceptable transport operations;\n\nreview  pricing  policies  in  the  transport  sector,  including  the  price  of\ntransport \nreducing  price\ndistortions,  road-user  cost  recovery  and  subsidy  policies  and  strategies,\nand transport operators' autonomy in setting transport prices;\n\nrecommendations  on \n\ninputs,  and  make \n\nassist  in  the  preparation  of  the  three-year  national  transportation\ninvestment  plan,  paying  particular  attention  to  providing  advice  on\nfor  complementary\nanalytical  methods \n\nfor  assessing \n\nthe  potential \n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 15, page 6\n\noperations among transport modes, especially between the road and rail\nmodes, and between aviation and road network development; and\n\n(vi)\n\nassist KAZMOTC to implement the Human Resources Development Plan\nand Systems Development Plan prepared under ADB\u2019s TA No. 2631-KAZ:\nInstitutional Strengthening of the Road Sector).4 \n\n25. \n The Adviser will bear in mind that, for each road to have an effective, unique owner, the\nroad  system  should  be  divided,  in  a  manner  appropriate  to  the  country  concerned,  into\nsubsystems  of  appropriate  size  and  character;  and  a  fee-for-use  system  of  road  user  cost\nrecovery (vis-a-vis fee-for-funding maintenance and operation) should be encouraged.\n\nD.\n\nImplementation Arrangements and Timing\n\n26. \n KAZMOTC and KGZMOTC will be the Executing Agencies (EAs) and will provide overall\nguidance in the activities under the TA.  The EAs will appoint suitable senior counterparts who will\nbe  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  supervision  and  coordination  activities-  including  monitoring\nprogress achieved and resolution of any difficulties that may arise during implementation, and will\nmaintain a close working relationship with each other.  The consulting services are expected to\nstart in the first quarter of 2001. The services of the transport policy adviser will be provided on a\nstaggered basis, and the TA is expected to be completed before the end of 2004.\n\nE.\n\nCounterpart Staff and Facilities\n\nKAZMOTC  and  KGZMOTC  will  provide  counterpart  staff  who  will  be  trained  by  the  TA\n\n27. \nconsultants, office accommodations, local communications, and administrative support.\n\nF.\n\nRequired Expertise\n\n28. \nFor phase I, the services of customs and road transport specialists experienced in dealing\nwith cross-border road trade and transport issues, including establishing ACCS, will be required.\nThe  specialist  should  be  able  to  design  and  implement  the  system,  and  train  the  local  staff  in\nmodern customs and vehicle inspection procedures.\n\n29. \nFor phase II, expertise in road safety will be required. A highway engineer experienced in\nestablishing NRSC, undertaking statistical analysis of road accidents, and training the counterpart\nstaff will be essential. In addition, the services of a legal expert experienced in drafting the RSAs\nand preparing civil works contract documents will be required.\n\nFor phase III, transport policy adviser, who will be a senior transport economist, must have\n30. \nextensive  experience  in  transport  policy  review  and  analysis,  transport  regulations,  transport\npricing, and procurement. The assignment will be for nine months over the three-year duration of\nthe Project.\n\nFor phases I and II, the consultants will provide the following reports in both English and\n\nG.\n\nSubmission of Reports\n\n31. \nRussian:\n                                            \n4 For $750,000, approved on 27 August 1996.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 15, page 7\n\n(i)\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nan  inception  report  detailing  the  work  program,  deliverables  under  the  TA,  and\ntimetable  for  achievements,  within  four  weeks  of  the  commencement  of  the\nconsultancy (five copies for the Government and three for ADB);\n\nbrief  monthly  reports  on  the  status  of  the  consultancy  and  its  achievements\n(three copies for the Government and one copy for ADB);\n\ndraft transport and customs documentation to be introduced, with a brief manual\nexplaining the procedures for completing the documentation and their relevance;\n\n(iv) \n\nACCS manual;\n\n(v) \n\ndraft RSAs for comments and RSAs after incorporating the comments;\n\n(vi) \n\nRussian version of Road Safety Guidelines;\n\n(vii) \n\ndraft final report, within 18 weeks of the commencement of the consultancy (five\ncopies  for  the  Government  and  three  for  ADB),  which  will  include  all  tasks\nundertaken  by  the  consultants,  including  a  review  of  the  training  conducted  for\nboth  cross-border  and  safety  aspects,    and  assessment  of  impact    including\ndifficulties encountered and remedial measures taken; and\n\n(viii) \n\nfinal  report  incorporating  the  Governments\u2019  and  ADB's  comments,  within  two\nweeks  of  receiving  all  comment  (five  copies  for  the  Governments  and  three  for\nADB).\n\n32. \n For phase III, the policy adviser will prepare a short progress report for KAZMOTC and\nADB after every six weeks in the field, giving a summary of the transport reform and proposing a\ndetailed  work  program  for  the  rest  of  his/her  assignment.

The\nanalysis covers the construction period 2001-2004 plus the subsequent 20 years of operation.\nThe traffic forecasts have been prepared for each section based on actual traffic and economic\ndata as well as forecasts of economic and population growth in the Project area. Transit traffic,\nwhich  accounts  for  8-25  percent  of  truck  traffic,  is  included  in  the  traffic  forecasts.  Both\nKazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic are facing difficult economic situations at the present time,\ndue to the impact of the Russian economic crisis and low prices for the commodities comprising\nKazakhstan\u2019s principal exports. However, the longer-term future for both countries is considered\nbrighter:  Kazakhstan  has  substantial  natural  resources,  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  made\nsubstantial  progress  in  its  transformation  to  a  market-based  economy.  The  relocation  of  the\nKazakh capital from Almaty to Astana will not affect traffic on the Project road as traffic which\npreviously used Project road to reach Almaty will still need to use it to reach Astana.\n\n2.   \nFor the Kazakh portion, the traffic forecast is based on the assumption that traffic levels\nwill remain constant at their 1997 levels through 2001, due to Kazakhstan\u2019s ongoing economic\ndifficulties. After 2001, traffic levels will grow at average annual growth rates of 4.5-5.9 percent,\nreflecting the economy\u2019s long-term potential for growth. Cars are by far the largest category of\nvehicle,  accounting  for  77-87  percent  of  the  traffic  on  the  four  sections  during  the    period  of\nanalysis.  In  addition  to  personal  transport,  vehicles  categorized  as  cars  are  also  used\ncommercially  for  transport  of  small  loads  of  cargo.  The  remainder  of  the  traffic  is  fairly  evenly\ndistributed  among  buses,  light  trucks,  and  heavy  trucks,  although  heavy  trucks  constitute  the\nsmallest category\n\n3.  \nAs  there  are  no  viable  road  or  rail  alternatives  to  the  Project  road,  the  traffic  forecast\ndoes not include any traffic diverted to or from the Project road. The Kazakh portion of the road\nincludes  traffic  generated  by:  (i)  decreases  in  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs)  resulting  from\nresurfacing  and  other  road  improvements,  including  realignment  in  the  Kurday  pass  area,\ncarried out under the Project, and (ii) increased trade and new economic activities arising from\nthe improvement of cross-border procedures under the Project. Traffic generated by decreases\nin  VOCs  generally  ranges  from  2  percent  of  total  traffic  in  the  early  years  of  the  period  of\nanalysis  to  about  20  percent  in  the  latter  years.  Traffic  generated  as  part  of  the  subregional\nbenefits of the Project accounts for 3-5 percent of total truck traffic and approximately 1 percent\nof total traffic.\n\n4.   \nThe traffic forecast for the Kyrgyz portion is based on annual growth of 3 percent through\n2001,  and  that  of  approximately  5  percent  from  2001  to  2024.  This  reflects  the  slightly  better\nmedium-term growth prospects compared to Kazakhstan. The decrease in VOCs from the road\nimprovement  along  the  Kyrgyz  portion  of  the  road  is  not  expected  to  produce  a  significant\namount of generated traffic as a larger portion of the vehicle trips on the Kyrgyz sections are of\na local nature and shorter in length than those on the Kazakh sections. Traffic generated as a\nresult of the subregional benefits represents 5 percent of truck traffic, but less than 1 percent of\ntotal traffic. Cars account for 89-93 percent of total traffic during the period of analysis and, as in\nthe Kazakh case, are used for personal transport as well as transport of small loads of cargo.\nThe remainder of the traffic is distributed among buses and trucks.\n\n\f76\n\nAppendix 18, page 2\n\n5.  \nA  traffic  forecast  for  the  Project  road  has  been  prepared  based  on  actual  traffic  and\neconomic  data  as  well  as  forecasts  of  economic  and  population  growth  in  the  Project  area\n(Appendix  19).  For  the  Kazakh  portion,  traffic  is  forecast  to  remain  constant  at  1997  levels\n(3,143-9,655 AADT depending on the road section) through 2001, due to Kazakhstan's ongoing\neconomic difficulties. After 2001, traffic levels will grow at average annual growth rates of 4.5-\n5.9  percent,  reaching  11,643-26,379  AADT  in  2024,  reflecting  the  long-term  potential  for\neconomic  growth.  For  the  Kyrgyz  portion,  traffic  is  forecast  to  grow  at  an  annual  rate  of  3.0\npercent through 2001 and approximately 5.0 percent in the succeeding years. Depending on the\nsection,  traffic  levels  on  the  Kyrgyz  portion  of  the  Project  road  are  forecast  to  increase  from\n3,361-9,342 AADT in 1998 to 10,537-29,140 AADT in 2024. Cars comprise the largest category\nof  vehicle,  accounting  for  77-93  percent  of  traffic  on  the  road  sections.  The  traffic  forecast\nincludes traffic generated by (i) decreased vehicle operating costs (for the Kazakh part only) and\n(ii)  increased  trade  and  new  economic  activities  arising  from  the  improvement  of  cross-border\nprocedures (for both parts). The forecast does not include diverted traffic, as there are no viable\nroad or rail alternatives to the Project.\n\n\f77\n\nAppendix 18, page 3\n\nTable A18: Forecast of Total Traffic (Including Transit Traffic)\n(Average Annual Daily Traffic)\n\nPrivate\nCars\n\nBuses\n\nLight\nTrucks\n\nHeavy\nTrucks\n\nTotal\n\nRoad \nSection\n\nKazakh Sections\nAlmaty City-Kaskelen\n\nKaskelen-Uzunagach\n\nUzunagach-Otar\n\nOtar-Georgievka\n\nKyrgyz Sections\nBishkek-Bypass Intersection (Link 1)\n\nBypass Intersection-Georgievka (Link 2)\n\nBypass Intersection-Maevka (Link 3A)\n\nMaevka-Osh Highway (Link 3B)\n\nSource: Consultants' reports.\n\nYear\n\n1998\n2005\n2014\n2024\n\n1998\n2005\n2014\n2024\n\n1998\n2005\n2014\n2024\n\n1998\n2005\n2014\n2024\n\n1998\n2005\n2014\n2024\n\n1998\n2005\n2014\n2024\n\n1998\n2005\n2014\n2024\n\n1998\n2005\n2014\n2024\n\n8,315\n9,772\n15,086\n23,060\n\n3,636\n4,391\n8,120\n13,565\n\n2,402\n2,925\n5,653\n9,711\n\n2,970\n3,679\n7,112\n11,531\n\n8,522\n10,577\n16,251\n26,473\n\n6,337\n7,865\n12,086\n19,687\n\n6,893\n8,555\n13,144\n21,411\n\n3,131\n3,886\n5,971\n9,726\n\n440\n511\n673\n927\n\n413\n480\n634\n872\n\n311\n363\n481\n668\n\n334\n396\n533\n685\n\n339\n393\n507\n682\n\n214\n248\n321\n431\n\n108\n125\n162\n217\n\n65\n75\n98\n131\n\n743\n830\n1,307\n1,850\n\n401\n456\n746\n1,083\n\n276\n305\n497\n762\n\n320\n372\n584\n814\n\n351\n484\n811\n1,453\n\n324\n447\n748\n1,338\n\n392\n542\n906\n1,621\n\n73\n100\n168\n302\n\n157\n201\n352\n542\n\n180\n229\n387\n588\n\n154\n187\n313\n502\n\n173\n217\n355\n514\n\n130\n178\n298\n534\n\n188\n257\n431\n774\n\n213\n291\n488\n874\n\n92\n126\n211\n379\n\n9,655\n11,314\n17,417\n26,379\n\n4,631\n5,556\n9,887\n16,109\n\n3,143\n3,779\n6,944\n11,643\n\n3,797\n4,665\n8,584\n13,543\n\n9,342\n11,632\n17,867\n29,140\n\n7,064\n8,818\n13,586\n22,229\n\n7,606\n9,512\n14,699\n24,123\n\n3,361\n4,188\n6,448\n10,537\n\n\f78\n\nAppendix 19, page 1\n\nA.\n\nGeneral\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS\n\nThe economic analysis of the rehabilitation of the Almaty-Bishkek road was carried out\n1.\non  the  basis  of  a  comparison  of  the  with-  and  without  Project  situations  and  using  the  world\nprice  numeraire.  The  Project  involves  providing  new  base  courses,  resurfacing,  and  other\nimprovements on the entire project road and new alignments in parts of the Kurday Pass. The\nwithout-Project scenario involves routine and periodic maintenance at current levels to keep the\nroad in its current condition. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were calculated for four\nprimary  scenarios:  (i)  the  Kazakh  portion  of  the  project  road  including  benefits  from  road\nrehabilitation  but  excluding  subregional  benefits,  (ii)  the  Kyrgyz  portion  with  road  rehabilitation\nbenefits  but  excluding  subregional  benefits,  (iii)  overall  project  and  country  components\nincluding  subregional  benefits,  and  (iv)  overall  Project  including  regional  benefits  arising  from\ntransit  traffic.  The  economic  analysis  covered  a  period  of  24  years  (2001-2024)  including  four\nyears  of  construction.  All  costs  and  benefits  were  estimated  in  constant  1999  prices.  The\neconomic analysis of the Project was based on separate studies prepared on the Kazakhstan\nportion of the road, the Kyrgyz Republic portion, and on subregional benefits.1\n\nB.\n\nCosts\n\nC.\n\nBenefits\n\ninclude \n\nProject  economic  costs \n\n2.\nimprovement  and\nmaintenance. Costs for the subregional component include costs for equipment and training. As\npart of the calculation of economic costs, the local currency costs were divided into tradable and\nnontradable  groups.  A  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9  (for  both  Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz\nRepublic) was then applied to the nontradable portion. A shadow wage rate was applied to the\nfinancial costs of unskilled labor to convert them to economic costs.\n\nthe  resource  costs  of  road \n\n3.\nEconomic benefits used in the four EIRR scenarios were estimated for the Kazakhstan\nportion  of  the  project  road  (Almaty-Georgievka);  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  portion  of  the  road\n(Georgievka/Chui-Bishkek); the subregional aspects of the Project, i.e., improvements in cross-\nborder policies and procedures; and transit traffic, which provides benefits to other countries in\nthe region.\n\n1.\n\nKazakhstan\n\n4.\nThe main sources of economic benefits from the Kazakh portion of the Project (205 km),\nexcluding subregional benefits, include savings (i) in vehicle operating costs (VOCs) for normal\ntraffic,  (ii)  from  traffic  generated  by  the  reduction  in  VOCs,  and  (iii)  in  time  because  of  the\nimproved  alignment  in  the  Kurday  Pass  for  freight  and  passenger  traffic.  In  most  years,  the\nmaintenance costs without the Project, which are based on actual expenditures, are less than\nthose  estimated  to  be  incurred  after  completion  of  the  project  road  so  that  there  are  no  net\nsavings  in  maintenance  expenditures  due  to  the  Project.  VOC  savings  by  vehicle  type  are\nshown in Table A19.1. Benefits from VOC savings for generated traffic are estimated at half the\nvalue for normal traffic.\n\n1 Asian Development Bank, Cross-Border Issues Study, September 1998.\n\n                  \n\n\f79\n\nAppendix 19, page 2\n\nVOC savings due to the Project\u2019s improvement of road conditions comprise the largest\n5.\ncategory  of  savings,  accounting  for  70-80  percent  of  total  benefits.  Unit  economic  VOCs  for\npassenger and freight vehicles were estimated using the latest version of the Highway Design\nand Maintenance Model (HDM-Manager). VOC savings will accrue primarily from improvements\nin  the  road  surface,  horizontal  and  vertical  alignment,  and  increased  average  speed  in  some\nsections.\n\n6.\nThe  new  alignment  of  the  Almaty-Bishkek  road  in  the  Kurday  Pass  and  resulting\nincreased  speeds  will  reduce  travel  times  on  the  road  by  30  minutes  for  cars,  one  hour  for\nbuses,  and  1.5  hours  for  trucks.  Estimates  of  benefits  from  these  time  savings  use  estimated\nwages  for  passengers  and  drivers.  The  wider  shoulders  of  the  Project  road  and  the  improved\nalignment  in  the  Kurday  Pass  area  will  significantly  improve  the  safety  conditions  of  the  road.\nWhile  insufficient  data  is  available  to  quantify  the  savings  from  reducing  the  level  of  vehicle\naccidents, these benefits are expected to increase the overall level of benefits from the Project.\n\nTable A19.1: Representative Vehicle Operating Costs, by Vehicle Type\n($ per vehicle-km)\n\nScenario\n\nCar\n\nBus\n\nLight/Medium\nTruck\n\nHeavy Truck\n\nA.

The speed on\nthe  Kyrgyz  portion  of  the  project  road  is  restricted  by  the  posted  speed  limits  rather  than  the\nconditions  of  the  road  so  there  will  be  no  time  savings  from  the  road  improvements.  In  most\nyears, the maintenance costs without the Project, based on actual expenditures, are lower than\nwhat  they  will  be  once  the  Project  is  implemented  so  that  there  are  no  net  savings  in  the\nmaintenance expenditures due to the Project. VOC savings due to the Project\u2019s improvement of\nroad conditions were based on estimates from the VOC module of HDM-Manager. During the\nproject period, it will be necessary to complete resealing and overlays of the road in the without-\nProject case, which will lower the VOC savings in the years immediately following this roadwork\ncompared  with  the  preceding  years.  The  reductions  in  VOCs  are  not  expected  to  be  great\nenough to produce a significant amount of generated traffic on this portion of the project road as\na larger portion of the vehicle trips on the Kyrgyz sections are of a local nature and are shorter\nin length than those on the Kazakh sections. Traffic will be generated as part of the subregional\naspects of the Project, however.\n\n\f80\n\nAppendix 19, page 3\n\n3.\n\nSubregional Benefits\n\n8.\nThe improvement in cross-border policies and procedures will result in a decrease in the\namount  of  time  spent  at  the  Georgievka-Chui  border  crossing.  Two  categories  of  subregional\nbenefits  arise  from  the  project:  (i)  time  savings,  and  (iii)  new  economic  activity  to  meet  the\nincreased  demand  for  goods  due  to  lower  costs  of  trade.  The  improved  border  control\nprocedures  will  result  in  time  savings  from  the  removal  of  (i)  control  point  delays,  (ii)  border\nprocessing  delays,  and  (iii)  clearance  delays.  The  time  savings  will  lower  the  costs  of  trade.\nAvailable data to estimate the benefits from the new economic activity are insufficient; however,\nthe benefits are expected to increase the overall level of project benefits. The decreased cost of\ntrade  and  the  new  economic  activity  will  result  in  an  increase  in  the  volume  of  trade  and  the\namount  of  traffic  necessary  to  transport  it.  The  increased  trade  will  involve  products  such  as\nfresh produce and other agricultural goods and is estimated to generate an increase in bus and\ntruck traffic equivalent to 5 percent of the estimated normal traffic of these vehicle types on the\nproject  road.  The  subregional  benefits  were  allocated  between  Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz\nRepublic, using proportions of 48 percent and 52 percent, respectively. These proportions were\ndetermined  on  the  basis  of  the  direction  of  traffic  flow  of  heavy  vehicles  through  the  border\ncrossing.\n\nD.\n\nResults of Economic Analysis\n\n9.\nThe  EIRR  for  the  overall  Project,  including  subregional  benefits,  is  estimated  at  27.6\npercent  (Table  A19.2).  Due  to  the  much  smaller  scale  of  the  Kyrgyz  portion  of  the  Project\nrelative to the Kazakh portion and the approximately equal distribution of subregional benefits,\nthe inclusion of subregional benefits has a larger impact on the EIRR for the Kyrgyz component,\nwhich has an EIRR of 48.8 percent versus 25.6 percent for the Kazakh component. The EIRR\nfor the overall Project, excluding subregional benefits, is estimated at 23.8 percent. The EIRRs\nfor  the  Kazakh  and  Kyrgyz  components  are  much  closer,  23.7  and  25.9,  respectively,  when\nsubregional  benefits  are  excluded.  Transit  traffic  has  been  excluded  from  these  EIRR\ncalculations as the benefits associated with this traffic do not accrue to either country. Benefits\nfrom  transit  traffic  will  accrue  to  other  countries  in  the  region  (principally  Russia  and\nUzbekistan).  Inclusion  of  direct  regional  benefits  in  the  form  of  VOC  savings  along  with  the\nsubregional  benefits  increases  the  EIRR  to  28.0  percent.  Secondary  regional  benefits  are\ndifficult to quantify, but are expected to further increase the level of project benefits. Details of\nthe EIRR calculations are shown in Tables A19.3-A19.9.\n\nSensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  to  test  the  impact  of  negative  changes  in  key\n10.\nparameters  determining  the  costs  and  benefits  of  the  Project.  The  sensitivity  analysis  for  the\noverall Project, including subregional benefits, indicates that it would take an increase in costs\nof 170 percent or a decrease in benefits of 63 percent for the EIRR to decline to the cutoff level\nof 12 percent. The switching values for the Project including subregional benefits are lower for\nthe  Kazakh  component  than  for  the  Kyrgyz  component.  The  switching  values  for  the  Project\nexcluding  subregional  benefits  are  smaller  than  those  for  the  Project  including  these  benefits,\nbut still quite high overall. Given that both countries now have experience in implementing ADB-\nfinanced  road  projects,  it  is  not  likely  that  such  large  increases  in  costs  will  occur.  Similarly,\ngiven  the  somewhat  conservative  nature  of  the  traffic  forecast,  it  is  not  likely  that  such  large\ndecreases in benefits will occur.\n\n\fTable A19.2: Base Case EIRRs and
