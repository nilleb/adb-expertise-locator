The  project  will  focus  on  GMS  trade  in  food  products  to  which  SPS  measures \napply.  It  will  establish,  strengthen,  and  implement  (i)  surveillance  and  inspection  programs  for \nfood  safety,  including  safer  food  handling  in  the  tourism  industry;  and  (ii)  regional  cooperation \nand harmonization of SPS management in food trade. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\ntrade,  GMS  governments \n\nincreasingly  acknowledge  that  weak \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  GMS  regional  cooperation  strategy  and  program  focuses  on  connectivity  and \n3. \ncompetitiveness.  While  recent  investments  in  physical  infrastructure  have  created  new \nopportunities  for \nlegal, \ninstitutional,  and  administrative  capacity  hinders  the  optimal  use  of  infrastructure  and  makes  it \ndifficult  to  minimize  trade-related  health  hazards.  Some  initiatives  have  been  launched  to \novercome these constraints, such as the GMS cross-border transport agreement. The midterm \nreview  of  the  GMS  strategic  framework  (2002\u20132012)  reaffirmed  the  importance  of  trade  and \ntransport  facilitation  initiatives,  including  strengthening  of  SPS  capacity  and  cooperation.  The \nGMS action plan for SPS system arrangements, 2010\u20132015 identified the essential SPS issues \nthat need to be resolved to meet the development needs of the GMS. The project fits within the \nGMS  regional  cooperation  strategy  and  program  and  is  included  in  the  Viet  Nam  country \noperations business plan.3 \n \n4.  \nTrade  in  the  GMS  is  growing  rapidly,  especially  in  SPS-affected  products,  particularly \nfood  and  food  products.  As  incomes  rose  across  most  GMS  countries,  total  recorded  GMS \nexports  of  agriculture,  food,  and  forestry  (AFF)  products  (for  which  SPS  measures  apply) \nreached  $9.27 billion  in  2009.  This  represents  an  average  annual  growth  of  more  than  10% \nsince  2000.  Viet  Nam,  in  2009,  exported  about  $2  billion  of  AFF  products  to  the  other  GMS \ncountries, of which 53% were food products. It imported $1.3 billion of AFF products, of which \n73% was food. Tourist arrivals in Viet Nam are also on the rise and reached more than 5 million \nin 2010, an increase of 30% over 2009. The tourism sector is an important exporter of services. \n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asia  Development  Bank (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical assistance  (TA)  in  2010.  The  regional \nSPS project for Cambodia and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) was approved on 26 June 2012. \n(ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans, Grant, and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  and  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  Trade \nFacilitation:  Improved  Sanitary  and  Phytosanitary  Handling  in  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Trade  Project.  Manila.) \nThe  Viet  Nam project  focused  on food  safety,  forms  an  integral part of  the  regional  SPS project.  SPS  measures \nand issues are defined in the 1994 World Trade Organization Subsidiary Agreement on the Application of Sanitary \nand Phytosanitary Measures. \n\n3   ADB. 2011. Country Operations Business Plan: Viet Nam, 2012\u20132014. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n \n\nNotwithstanding these positive developments, the weak SPS system seriously hampers \n5. \nfurther  growth  of  food  trade  and  improvement  in  food  safety,  which  affects  not  only  the \ninvestment climate, both regionally and nationally, but also the profitability of the private sector. \nFood exports remain largely bulk commodities. Agriculture input management is poor, and food-\nprocessing  standards  are  low.  Weak  food  safety  control  measures  in  imports  and  domestic \nmarkets  lead  to  food-related  disease  outbreaks  and  high  risks  for  investors.  Poor  public \nresponse  capacity  can  result  in  blanket  bans  and/or  imposition  of  complex  technical  product \nrequirements  by  importing  countries.  Moreover,  SPS  and  food  safety  management  capacity \naffects  human  well-being  and  incomes.  Currently,  food  safety  requirements  in  most  countries \nare tightening, driven by greater consumer awareness, urbanization and modern lifestyles, food \nquality  scares,  and  inadequate  response  of  regulators  and  food  companies  to  food  safety \nincidents. The international trend in food control systems is that private sector entities assume \nthe responsibility to produce and market safe food, but governments issue technical guidelines, \nprovide  regulatory  oversight,  and  ensure  adequate  enforcement.  To  do  this,  public  systems \nneed  institutional  capacity  for  process  control  and  conformity  testing,  supported  by  adequate \nlaboratory facilities. Where such arrangements exist, public inspection rates can be low.4 \n \n6. \nGiven  the  diversity  of  its  agricultural  products  and  the  wide  range  of  trade  issues,  Viet \nNam  faces  greater  and  more  complex  food  safety  surveillance  tasks  than  the  smaller  GMS \ncountries. The SPS\u2013food safety situation in Viet Nam is characterized by: \n\n(i) \n\n (ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nLack  of  systematic  national  planning  and  implementation  of  active  and  passive \nsurveillance,5  which  affects  the  robustness  and  reliability  of  the  food  safety \nsystem.  In  laboratories,  diagnostic  and  testing  systems  are  insufficiently \nharmonized  and  do  not  always  meet  international  standards.  Participation  in \nproficiency  testing  is  limited.  The  existing  capacity  is  underutilized  because  of \ninadequate operational funds.6 \nLack  of  sound  food  safety  management  capacity  for  exports  to  domestic  and \nregional  (GMS)  markets. While  efforts  to  meet  international  SPS  standards  can \nbe  very  good  for  some  exports,  such  as  fish  and  fish  products  for  the \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development markets, performance \nin other areas\u2014e.g., food products that are geared toward the domestic market \nand trade with GMS countries\u2014is often poor.7 Capacity for risk-based handling of \nfood  imports,  and  for  active  and  passive  surveillance  is  weak,  particularly \nprovincial capacity. \nLimited capacity of the Viet Nam Food Administration (VFA), established in 1999 \nunder the Ministry of Health (MOH), for managing food safety tasks mandated by \nthe Food Safety Law of July 2010. There is no central planning and compilation \nand analysis of data. \n\n \n7.  \nPolicy  and  sector  relevance.  The  Government  of  Viet  Nam  recognizes  the  need  to \nmodernize  AFF  production  and  boost  international  trade  competitiveness.  The  Socioeconomic \nDevelopment  Plan,  2011\u20132015  anticipates  a  restructuring  of  economic  activity  toward  greater \ntechnological  content  of  Vietnamese  goods  and  a  deepening  of  international  economic \n\n                                                \n4  To  meet  basic  safety  requirements,  the  farm  industry  must  follow  good  agricultural  practices  and  processing \nenterprises must use sound hygiene principles, good manufacturing practices, and quality and safety management \nsystems based on hazard analysis and critical control points. \n\n5   Active surveillance is to collect targeted data in the field, while passive surveillance is to collect existing data from \n\nmonitoring and inspection. \n\n6   Funding for food safety is still very low, at about D1,100 per capita/year (7% of the amount allocated in Thailand). \n7   A  considerable  part  of  the  AFF  trade  between  Viet  Nam  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  remains \ninformal,  and  shipments  of  cassava  or  fruit,  for  instance,  have  been  held  up  in  the  past  pending  the  meeting  of \nformal SPS requirements. \n\n\f3 \n \n\nto  effective \n\nintegration, including application of standards and SPS practices. The project is aligned with the \ntargets  of  the  Socio-economic  Development  Plan, \nthe  Five-Year  Plan  for  Agriculture \nDevelopment, 2011\u20132015, the National SPS Action Plan, and the National Action Plan for Food \nSafety, as well as the Law on Food Safety (2010). The project is also in line with the GMS 10-\nyear strategic framework, 2012\u20132022, and supports the drive to facilitate cross-border trade and \ninvestment.  The  project  will  contribute  to  pillar  4  (cooperation  in  regional  public  goods)  of  the \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB),8 and is \nconsistent with the GMS core agriculture support program. \n \n8. \nLessons from trade facilitation and sanitary and phytosanitary development. Trade \nfacilitation  remains  a  challenging  agenda  in  the  GMS,  and  covers  many  aspects.  Previous \nexperience  shows  the  need  to  adopt  a  phased  approach  by  formulating  well-targeted  and \nsequenced projects that lift the capacity of the weak link and ensure implementation of bilateral \nand  regional  commitments\u2014GMS  and  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)\u2014on \ncooperation and harmonization. In addition, support for SPS food safety needs to be delivered \nover  an  extended  period  to  allow  enough  time  to  develop  national  risk-based  surveillance \nsystems  gradually  and  systematically.  Inadequate  country-specific  capacity  is  a  major \nimpediment \nregional  cooperation  and  harmonization  of  SPS  measures. \nDevelopment  partners  support  various  aspects  of  food  safety  management  in  Viet  Nam,  but \nongoing projects have not focused on building food safety capacity in a comprehensive manner. \nPreparatory  work  has  been  firmly  anchored  in  the  lessons  from  international  experience  that \nstress the need for prevention rather than end-of-pipe controls, which have proven to be costly \nand  frequently  ineffective.  Raising  awareness  of  the  private  sector  and  civil  society  through \neducation  and  campaigns  is  an  important  part  of  government  policies.  Surveys  show  that \nawareness  among  manufacturers,  traders,  and  consumers  has  increased  from  2001  to  2008. \nHowever, management and implementation of food safety and hygiene is still at low levels and \nneeds  to  be  stepped  up.  Involvement  of  the  private  sector  and  civil  society  in  SPS  capacity \nbuilding  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  the  key  concerns  of  food  safety  are  properly  addressed. \nThe  project  will  support  workshops  for  all  stakeholders,  including  the  private  sector,  to  raise \nawareness, provide training, and build consensus. Coordination with development partners and \nthe GMS working group on agriculture will be maintained throughout. \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe intended impact of the project is that Viet Nam\u2019s food products  will  be safer, more \nefficiently produced, and traded in greater quantities. The outcome of the project is an enhanced  \nSPS and food safety management system in Viet Nam. \n \nC. \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Strengthened Food Safety Surveillance, Handling, and Inspection   \nPrograms \n\n \n10.  \nThe  project  will  support  the  design  and  implementation  of  food  safety  surveillance, \nincluding (i) a  pilot in four northern provinces, (ii) import handling, (iii) grading of restaurants in \ntourist  areas,  and  (iv) strengthening  of  food  laboratories  to  support  surveillance  and  decisions \non market access.  \n \n11.  \nFood  safety  surveillance.  The  project  will  focus  on  the  development  of  annual \nsurveillance  programs  that  analyze  known  and  perceived  risks  to  food  safety,  in  particular \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2006. Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy. Manila.  http://www.adb.org/documents/ regional-\n\ncooperation-and-integration-strategy. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\nhazards related to product types, product origins, locations, markets, major public events, hotels \nand restaurants (especially in the tourism sector), covering imported and domestic products  at \nvarious stages\u2014on-farm, processing plant, and market. MOH will lead and coordinate the food \nsurveillance  and  establish a food  safety  database.  Surveillance  programs  will  be  strengthened \nin the four provinces.9 \n \n12. \nImproving food safety surveillance capacity in line with World Trade Organization (WTO) \nprinciples  will  require  mainstreaming  risk  analysis  in  national  food  safety  and  hygiene \nmanagement, with a focus on the VFA's capacity to use risk analysis in policy preparation and \ncoordination. The project will help (i) develop institutional capacity and assign mandates for risk \nassessment, risk management, and risk communication; (ii) design and implement cross-cutting \nrisk  analysis  programs; (iii)  train  staff through  workshops  and  learning-by-doing; (iv) conduct  a \nfood  consumption  study  and  risk  assessment  studies  for  six  food  additives;  and  (v)  increase \nstandardization.  Food  safely  surveillance  will  focus  first  on  major  urban  areas,  and  core \nproduction  and  trading  areas  of  products  with  high  food  safety  vulnerability.  Progressively, \nannual  programs  will  cover  more  products,  parameters,  and  areas.  For  reasons  of  cost-\neffectiveness, use of rapid test kits will be integrated in the sampling strategy wherever possible. \nThe strengthened surveillance will make use of passive surveillance. This will be complemented \nby  active  surveillance  on  particular  products,  parameters,  and  locations.  Since  present \noperational budgets are insufficient for broader national surveillance, the project will bridge gaps \nfor collecting and analyzing increased numbers of food samples. \n \n13. \nThe project will also support (i) information and communication technology connections \nbetween the VFA, major institutes, other ministries with SPS mandates, and sub-VFAs;10 (ii) a \ndatabase with search and statistical analysis capacity; and (iii) a server and portal. Substantial \ntraining will be provided for specialists in national institutions (and for users in the provinces) to \nimplement  information  and  communication  technology  systems.  Test  results  from  active  and \npassive surveillance will be stored in a comprehensive database and used for (i) risk analysis; \n(ii)  management  support  and  response  to  hazards;  (iii)  an  annual  report  to  the  public;  (iv) \nreporting to other agencies involved (such as the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development \nand the  Ministry  of Industry  and  Trade  where relevant for their response);  and (v)  cooperation \nwith  trading  partners,  especially  Cambodia,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  the  Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and Thailand. \n \n14.  \nImport handling. The project will develop and implement advanced risk-based methods \nfor  controlling  imported  processed  food  in  line  with  WTO  and  ASEAN  recommendations.  This \nwill involve (i) study visits and consensus workshops; (ii) preparation of risk profiles of different \ncategories  of  products  to  which  different  degrees  of  inspection  can  be  applied;  (iii) design  of \nbetter  inspection  manuals,  where  possible  harmonized  with  neighboring  countries,  and  their \neffective  application;  (iv)  training  support  for  implementation  of  risk-based  inspection;  and \n(v) regional  cooperation  in  handling  requests  for  first-time  market  access  approval  on  imports. \nCourses  will  be  provided  for  MOH  staff  on  principles  of  the  WTO's  SPS  agreement  and  the \nCodex Alimentarius, and the working of international and national food control systems. \n \n15. \nfood  safety \nmanagement in restaurants in tourist areas by grading them, using scorecards based on good \nhygiene practices and good manufacturing practices. This will be done through study visits and \npractical  experience  in  developing  and  applying  scorecard-based  systems  that  have  already \n\nin  tourist  areas.  The  project  will \n\nGrading  restaurants \n\nimprove \n\n                                                \n9   The provinces are Cao Bang, Lang Son, Lao Cai, and Quang Ninh. They are all northern provinces with significant \n\nformal and informal export and import trade, and high risks of food safety hazards in informal trade. \n\n10  Sub-VFAs are provincial and local VFA offices, which directly report to VFA. \n\n\f5 \n \n\nbeen  established  and  are  routinely  applied  in  the  PRC,  Singapore,  and  Thailand.  The  project \nwill help (i) develop a system to upgrade food-handling safety through scorecards and grading; \n(ii) raise food safety awareness in the tourism industry; (iii) conduct training courses for private \nsector  and government  staff  involved  in  food  safety;  (iv)  provide  diagnostic  assessments  (i.e., \npre-audits) of restaurants and hotels; and (v) audit enterprises against the scorecards and grade \nthem  accordingly.  Once  such  a  grading  system  is  established,  private  companies  can  provide \nthese services on behalf of the government and the industry. The project will assist in drafting \nregulations  for  the  implementation  of  the  grading  system,  and  in  defining  the  criteria  for \nqualification and accreditation of providers. The system will be piloted in two cities: Nha Trang \n(Khanh Hoa province) and Ha Long (Quang Ninh province). \n \n16. \nStrengthening  food  laboratories.  The  project  will  selectively  strengthen  the  national \nnetwork  of  food  laboratories  and  government  capacity  for  national  surveillance  and  market \naccess decisions. It will aim to (i) improve testing skills, (ii) bolster quality management, (iii) fill \ngaps in analytical capacity with pertinent equipment, and (iv) strengthen the National Institute for \nFood  Control  within  MOH  in  its  role  as  reference  laboratory  and  provider  of  training  to  other \nlaboratories.  The  project  will  support  the  public  role  of  ensuring  that  food  is  safe  by  helping \nconduct  regular  food  tests  and  public  inspection  of  premises,  and  by  helping  prepare  the \nlaboratories for  their  increasing  role.

The  WTO  principles  of  risk-based  SPS  management  are  all \nembodied  in  the  design  of  financed  activities.  Other  design  considerations  concerned  (i)  the \nneed  to  deal  with  a  wider  and  more  complex  range  of  food  safety  issues  than  is  the  case  in \nsmaller  neighbor  countries;  (ii)  the  need  to  systematize  and  introduce  more  rigor  into \nsurveillance  planning;  (iii)  the  specific  need  to  increase  technical  capacity  in  the  provinces; \n(iv) the need to respond to evolving market access requirements of export food markets; (v) the \nneed to promote risk-based food-safety practices and thereby reduce the aggregate number of \ninspections; and (vi) the need to harmonize with WTO principles and ASEAN recommendations, \nand  to adopt  international  standards in information  exchange  and reporting  on  production and \ntrade in food products.  \n \n24. \nThe major technical design parameters are (i) a recognition that food safety surveillance \nstart from a low informational and human capacity base, and that bolstering food safety capacity \nshould  take  a  pragmatic  approach;  and  (ii)  promotion  of  simple  and  cost-effective  approaches \nwherever  possible (e.g.,  use  of  a combination  of  conventional  testing  and  rapid  test  kits).  The \nproject  has  been  designed  to  complement  ongoing  and  planned  interventions  by  various \ndevelopment partners and ADB. Cooperation is promoted through participation in various SPS \nforums, bilateral working groups, training attachments, academic exchanges, and twinning. \n \nB. \n \nInvestments  in  food  safety  capacity  building  are  justified  for  the  public  good.  In \n25. \ndeveloping  member  countries  and  in  middle-income  contexts  such  as  Viet  Nam,  they  are \ntypically part of long-term programs to establish capacity that has hitherto been largely absent.16 \nWithout public intervention, food safety management will be underprovided. This leads to lack of \nincentives to improve the safety and quality of food products, the persistence of relatively high \ndisability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and the substantial economic costs caused by poor food \nsafety.  Without  improvement,  Viet  Nam  may  become  the  destination  of  some  subgrade \nprocessed food products in the GMS. In this context, Viet Nam will remain a relatively weak link, \nand contribute to high reputational risk to  the GMS, especially in tourism, where many tourists \ntypically visit several GMS countries in the course of an individual trip. \n \n26.  While  the  causal  relationship  between  project  outcome  and  impact  (and  thus  the \npotential  economic  benefits)  is  complex,  a  basic  estimate  of  the  benefits  arising  from  greater \nfood  safety  in  Viet  Nam  could  be  made  based  on  the  Global  Burden  of  Diseases  estimates,17 \nwhich have been used in the context of the Lao PDR.18 Using the same methodology, but with \ncomparable estimates for Viet Nam, and the same income parameters, the costs to Viet Nam of \nthe current poor food safety situation would be about $500 million. A 1% reduction of this loss \nwould be worth $5 million a year. \n \n27. \n\nThe financial sustainability of the project is particularly important because SPS systems \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n16  Domestic food safety management is a classic example of a pure public good (i.e., no rivalry in consumption, no  \n\npossibility to separate and charge individual users\u2014non-excludability). \n\n17  Global  Burden  of  Diseases.  2008.

The  opportunities  for \ncost  recovery  from  the  private  sector  are  limited.19  Recurrent  costs  of  survey  and  other \noperations are relatively high (at about 8.3% of total project costs). The fiscal implications have \nbeen discussed and accepted by the government.  \n \nC. \n \n28.   All procurement to be financed by ADB loan funds will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Project implementation, \nprocurement,  and  financial  management  will  be  aligned  with  the  government's  standard \noperating procedures. The project accounts administered by the PMU will be consolidated and \naudited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. The project will strengthen capacity of staff in \nfinancial  management  procedures  to  allow  the  efficient  operation  of  imprest  accounts  and \nreporting  of  financial  performance  to  the  governments  and  ADB.  The  project  will  establish  or \nuse  existing  ministerial  websites  to  (i)  disclose  implementation  progress  and  bid  notifications \nand their results, and (ii) provide a grievance mechanism against any corrupt practice. \n \n29.   ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  governments.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 14). \n \nD. \n \n30.    The  project  is  classified  general  intervention  and  does  not  target  poverty  directly. \nHowever,  by  improving  the  management  of  food  products  and  stepping  up  food  safety  in  Viet \nNam and within the GMS, the project will help increase agricultural productivity and contribute to \nmaking  trade  in  food  products  more  predictable.  Improving  national  food  surveillance  reduces \nexposure to food poisoning and time off work for all, including the poor, for whom it is relatively \nmore important in terms of illness costs and lost work time. In the tourism industry, the grading \nof  food-handling  establishments  will  help  stabilize  and  formalize  the  hospitality  sector,  and \nindirectly sustain relatively low-wage employment in food preparation, handling, and serving. \n \n31. \nAs women\u2019s participation in tourism-related employment (e.g., in restaurants and hotels) \nis high, they will particularly benefit from the project. The project is categorized as having some \ngender  elements.  Gender  analysis  has  been  undertaken,  including  the  composition  of  staff  in \nthe  VFA  and  some  food-testing  institutes  under  MOF.  Overall,  the  gender  composition  is \nbalanced,  but  women  in  management  roles  are  relatively  underrepresented.  Selected  gender \ntargets  (women\u2019s  participation  in  training)  have  been  identified  and  are  reflected  in  the  legal \nagreement and the design and monitoring framework. \n \nE. \n \n32. \nThe  project  is  classified  category  C  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  does  not  have  a  negative  environmental \nimpact  and  there  are  no  implications  for  resettlement  of  any  persons  (as  all  system  upgrades \nwill take place within existing facilities and premises). \n \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n19 The potential for cost recovery through the charging of fees for services (e.g., testing of food) is limited because of \n(i)  the  public-goods  nature  of  most  surveillance  activities;  (ii)  the  modest  size  and  sophistication  of  the  private \nsector, which limits demand for commercial food safety services; and (iii) the limited incentives for complying with \nregulations. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n \n33.
