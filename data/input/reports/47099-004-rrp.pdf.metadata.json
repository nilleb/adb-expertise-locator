It includes policy actions to (i) reduce the cost of doing \nbusiness,  (ii)  strengthen  protection  for  businesses,  and  (iii)  increase  business  innovation  and \nproductivity. 2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Board  of  Directors  approved \nthe \nprogrammatic approach and subprogram 1 on 4 December 2015.3  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale4 \n\n \nA. \n \nTajikistan  faces  economic  challenges  and  a  tight  fiscal  situation.  Although \n3. \nTajikistan\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual average of 6.8% from 2005 to \n2015,  the  economy  remains  vulnerable  to  external  shocks  because  of  its  narrow  export  base \nand  its  extremely  high  dependence  on  remittance  inflows,  which  represented  an  average  of \n46%  of  GDP  in  2010\u20132013.  With  the  onset  of  the  recession  in  the  Russian  Federation,  and \nlowering  export  demand  from  its  main  trading  partners,  GDP  growth  moderated  from  6.7%  in \n2014 to 6.0% in 2015 and is expected to drop to 4.3% in 2016. Plummeting remittance inflows, \nwhich  in  2015  declined  in  dollar  terms  by  33%  prompted  a  35%  depreciation  of  the  somoni \nagainst the dollar since November 2014. Declining import tax revenues and increases in capital \nexpenditures,  wages,  and  pensions  resulted  in  a  surging  budget  deficit  (including  the  public \ninvestment  program)  that  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  estimates  at  4.3%  of  GDP  in \n2016 from 2.3% in 2015. The public debt\u2013GDP ratio increased from 27.8% in 2015 to 35.9% in \nmid-2016 and is expected to further increase as the fiscal cost of banking system restructuring \nmaterializes  and  in  the  absence  of  future  full-grant  assistance  from  multilateral  development \nbanks. The construction of the $3.9 billion Rogun hydroelectric project (almost 50% of GDP) will \nadd further pressure on external debt. As a result, the government recognized that strong fiscal \nconsolidation is necessary in the medium term emphasizing strict expenditure prioritization and \nbetter management of scarce resources. \n \n4. \nThe banking system\u2019s solvency deteriorated significantly since 2014. The currency \ndepreciation  had  a  severe  impact  on  the  quality  of  the  highly  dollarized  bank  loan  portfolio, \nwhich represented 63% of total loans in August 2016. In addition, systemically important banks \ncarry  nonperforming  legacy  assets  originating  from  government-directed  credit  programs. \nNonperforming loans (past due loans exceeding 30 days) deteriorated from 16% of total loans in \nDecember 2013 to 55% in September 2016, adversely affecting the profitability and solvency of \nthe  banking  system.  The  reported  average  capital  adequacy  is  now  substantially  short  of  the \nregulatory  minimum  requirement.  In  addition,  banks  are facing  liquidity  shortages,  which  have \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  for  investment  climate \n\nreforms (TA 8557-TAJ, approved on 13 December 2013). \n\n3  ADB.  2015.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Programmatic \nApproach  and  Policy-Based  Loan  and  Grant  for  Subprogram  1  to  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  Investment \nClimate Reforms Program. Manila. \n\n4  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Public  Sector  Management  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n\f2 \n\nprevented clients to withdraw their deposits.5 The government recognized that decisive actions \nare needed to restore liquidity and solvency in the banking system, including a new strong bank \nresolution  framework,  independent  reviews  of  the  financial  position  of  the  five  systemically \nimportant  banks,  and  a  clear  fiscal  strategy  for  responsible  bank  restructuring  to  mitigate  the \nassociated large fiscal risks. \n \n5. \nSubstantial  improvements  in  poverty,  yet  high  rural  poverty  prevails  and  job \nopportunities  are  limited.  Tajikistan  remains  the  poorest  country  in  the  Commonwealth  of \nIndependent States, with the lowest per capita gross national income ($1,240 in 2015, following \nthe  Atlas  method).  The  majority  of  people  still  live  in  rural  districts.  Rural  poverty  incidence \nremains high with the rural poor representing more than two thirds of total poor, or 40% of the \nrural  population.  Limited  job  opportunities  forced  about  40%  of the  working  population to  seek \nseasonal  jobs  abroad,  mostly  in  the  Russian  Federation.  The  government  estimates  that  in \n2015, 135,000 of the 1 million migrant workers in the Russian Federation returned to Tajikistan \nbecause  of  stricter  immigration  requirements  and  the  downturn  in  the  Russian  economy.  In \n2015 it is estimated that more than 330,000 migrants were given 3\u20135 years re-entry bans by the \nRussian Federation, further increasing pressure to absorb returning migrants into the economy. \n \n6. \nTajikistan\u2019s  economy  remains  poorly  diversified,  and  has  not  achieved  the  level  of \nstructural  transformation  that  has  taken  place  in  other  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States \ncountries.  The  economy  has  remained  largely  agrarian,  with  the  agriculture  sector  absorbing \n66% of the labor force.6 Until 2014, strong remittance inflows supported the appreciation of the \nreal effective exchange rate, reducing export competitiveness. The number of products exported \nwith  comparative  advantage  declined  from  an  average  of  158  in  2011\u20132014  to  131  in  2015. \nTajikistan\u2019s  economy  is  highly  reliant  on  external  factors,  such  as  the  Russian  economy  and \ninternational markets for key export commodities: aluminum, several ores, and cotton. \n \n7. \nDevelopment  problem. Many of the structural shortcomings in Tajikistan\u2019s economy\u2014\nlow  competitiveness  of  products  in  particular\u2014reflect  the  limited  progress  in  expanding  its \nproductive  capabilities  and  in  tapping  economic  opportunities  that  create  more  wealth.  This  is \nreflected in low levels of private investment, which were 5% of GDP during 2005\u20132013, one of \nthe lowest levels in the world.7 This limits future economic growth and job creation. \n \n8. \nBinding constraints to private investment  include an unfavorable business environment, \nunreliable  access  to  electricity  (particularly  during  the  winter),  poor  transport  connectivity  with \nexternal markets, and limited integration with global sources of knowledge. Since 2016, access \nto finance has particularly emerged as a binding constraint, given  the credit crunch associated \nwith the deteriorating solvency and liquidity in the banking sector (para. 12). \n \n9. \nPrivate  investment  remains  constrained  by  an  unfavorable  business  environment  that \nimposes  high  uncertainty  for  businesses.  Arbitrary  taxation  and  inspections  reduce  the \nprospects  of fair  competition  and return  on  investments.  Attempts  since 2006to introduce risk-\nbased inspections have failed. Tax authorities increased the share of businesses inspected from \n51%  in  2012  to  58%  in  2014,  and  from  57%  to  73%  for  individual  entrepreneurs.  Strong \nperceptions  of  expropriation  risks  and  corruption  discourage  businesses  and  investors  from \ninvesting  in Tajikistan.  The  judiciary\u2019s  ability  to  enforce  contracts  and  protect  investor  rights  is \n\n                                                \n5  The affected banks are insolvent and include Agroinvestbank, Tajprombank, and Tojiksodirotbank. \n6  ADB. 2016. Tajikistan: Promoting Export Diversification and Growth\u2013Country Diagnostic Study. Manila. \n7  Total  investment  (gross  fixed  capital  formation)  is  also  relatively  low,  averaging  16%  of  GDP  during  2005\u20132013. \n\nInvestment is largely funded by the government and development partners. \n\n\funcertain. Laws and regulations are often inaccessible, creating uncertainty among businesses \nand  investors  and  providing  the  basis  for  extortion  by  inspectors.  Overall,  Tajikistan\u2019s  country \nrisk is very high, resulting in very low foreign direct investment, which dropped from 9% of GDP \nduring 2004\u20132008 to 1% of GDP during 2009\u20132014.8 \n \n10. \nPoor  infrastructure.  Tajikistan\u2019s  landlocked  location,  poor  transport  and  logistics \ninfrastructure,  and  restrictive  regional  transit  arrangements  limit  businesses  in  accessing \nexternal  markets.  Energy  supply  is  unreliable  and  large  parts  of  the  country  lack  stable \nelectricity  supply  during the  winter.  In  2016,  Tajikistan  ranked  173rd  out  of  190  economies  on \nthe  ease  of  getting  electricity.9 Firms  are  reluctant  to  invest  in  new  equipment  and  automated \nproduction  if  they  cannot  access  a  stable  and  affordable  supply  of  electricity.  Existing  indirect \n(tariff-based)  cross-customer  energy  subsidies  distort  both  the  pricing  structure  and  market \ncompetition to the disadvantage of businesses. \n \n11. \nLimited  integration with  global  sources  of  knowledge. In 2015, only 13.8% of firms \nreport  having  an  internationally  recognized  quality  certification.  Tajikistan  ranks  118th  out  of \n138 countries  in  cluster  development.10 This  mostly  reflects  low  levels  of  human  capital  and \ninvestment,  but  is  also  related  to  institutional  constraints:  the  same  government  agency\u2014\nTajikstandard\u2014sets  technical  regulations  and  certifies  product  quality,  which  is  prone  to \nconflicts of interest and can undermine efforts to improve product quality. \n \n12. \nThe  banking  crisis  has  exacerbated  limited  access  to  finance,  reducing  investors\u2019 \ncapacity  to  expand  and  compete  internationally.  The  rapid  expansion  of  credit  to  the  private \nsector in 2013\u20132015 was brought to a sudden stop by the somoni depreciation observed since \nend-2014. Deposit flight, particularly in local currency, has forced a decline of 6.4% of credit to \nthe  economy  in  the  first  8  months  of  2016.  The  lack  of  affordable  local  currency  financing \nremains a problem. Bank lending rates are high, at 25% per annum on average, but can reach \nmore than 40% per annum. \n \n13. \nInstitutional  constraints.  The  governance  and  capacity  of  institutions  have  improved \nover the last decade (scored 4.4 in 2016 on a 1.0\u20137.0 scale, up from 3.4 in 2006), but remain \nweak.  The  performance  of  institutions  and markets  is  undermined  by  corruption,  bureaucracy, \nrelated  party  transactions,  poor  performance  of  boards,  and  lack  of  qualified  staff.  Tajikistan \nscored  26  out  of  100  in  Transparency  International\u2019s  corruption  perception  index,  where  0  is \nhighly corrupt and 100 very clean. Most policy decisions, including on some public investments, \nare  made  without  comprehensive  public  scrutiny  and  analysis  of  their  economic  and  social \nin-depth  understanding  of  policy  concepts  and \nimpacts.  Executive  bodies  often \nimplementation methods, limiting the effectiveness of policy decisions. \n \n14. \nThe  program  is  aligned with  the  government\u2019s  national  development  strategy  for \n2016\u20132030.11 The strategy prioritizes the creation of jobs through increased private investment, \neconomic  diversification,  and  competitiveness.  The  program  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy  for  2016\u20132020,  which  supports  reforms  to  achieve  economic  stability, \nimprove the investment climate, diversify the economy, and increase competitiveness.12 \n\nlack \n\n                                                \n8  Tajikistan  has  the  highest  country  risk  classification  under  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \n\nDevelopment\u2019s Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits (7 out of 7). \n\n9   World  Bank.  2016.

In  addition,  ADB  technical  assistance  is  advising  the \ngovernment  on  the  design  and  implementation  of  policies  and  solutions  to  improve  the \ninvestment climate (footnote 2). Such support is important because vested interests resist policy \nchanges.  ADB  is  investing  in  energy  and  transport  infrastructure  through  other  projects. \nSubprogram  2  benefited  from  the  collaboration  with  development  partners,  particularly  the \nWorld  Bank  Group  and  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW.13 The  government  is \ndiscussing a possible IMF program that includes reforms to address the banking system risks, \nstrengthen  the  financial  sector,  and  ensure  debt  sustainability  in  the  medium-term  through  an \nappropriate fiscal framework. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is also \ndiscussing possible assistance to the banking system. The conditions for effectiveness of ADB \nfinancing  support  the  improvement  of  the  macroeconomic  framework  and  were  designed  in \ncoordination with these partners\u2014particularly the IMF\u2014and the government. \n \nB. \n \nThe  impact  is  aligned  with  increased  private  investment,  economic  diversification,  and \n16. \ncompetitiveness. The outcome will be increased capabilities and opportunities of businesses to \nset up and expand higher value-added production. \n \nC. \n \n17. \nSubprogram  2  includes  13  policy  actions  (instead  of  10  originally  planned  indicative \npolicy actions) that further deliver three outputs approved under the program: (i) reduced cost of \ndoing  business,  (ii)  strengthened  protection  for  businesses,  and  (iii)  increased  business \ninnovation and productivity. Subprogram 3 has 12 indicative policy actions. \n \n18. \nOutput  1:  Reduced  cost  of  doing  business.  The  objective  is  to  reduce  the  cost  of \nregulatory compliance for businesses operating in Tajikistan. In subprogram 1, the government \nenacted the  Law  on  Inspections  of  Business  Activities,  2016  that  approved  a new  mechanism \nfor coordination and reporting of annual inspection plans for agencies conducting inspections. In \nsubprogram 2, the government will eliminate business inspection powers from eight government \nbodies and this reduction will continue under subprogram 3. \n \n19. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  government  modified  the  rules  for  calculation  of  profit  tax  to \nlower  the tax  burden  on  businesses. The government  and  the Tax  Committee  also  introduced \ndisciplinary measures and conducted a nationwide awareness campaign on taxpayers\u2019 rights to \nlimit predatory practices of tax officers and unlawful advance tax payments. A tax filing system \nintroduced under subprogram 1 helped increase the number of taxpayers filing electronically to \nmore than 33,000 (compared with 6,500 taxpayers at the end of 2014), exceeding expectations. \nThe  government  has  raised  the  goal  for  the  end  of  the  program  to  50,000  taxpayers  using \nelectronic filing (about 11% of registered taxpayers). \n \n20. \nTo  fulfill  Tajikistan\u2019s  commitment  under  the  World  Trade  Organization,  the  government \nhas  eliminated  outdated  technical  regulations  that  impose  unnecessary  costs  to  businesses. \nUnder  subprogram  1,  the  government  disclosed  the  full  list  of  existing  provisional  technical \nregulations and removed  103 outdated  regulations.  During  subprogram 2,  the government  will \nremove an additional 363 outdated technical regulations. Subprogram 3 will eliminate redundant \n\n                                                \n13 ADB  interventions  and  other  development  partner  activities  are  listed  in  Development  Coordination  (accessible \n\nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fdocumentation that imposes unnecessary costs to key exports. \n \n21. \nUnder subprogram 1, the government approved an improved regulatory impact analysis \n(RIA)  system  for  newly  proposed  legal  acts.  Under  subprogram  2,  two  pilot  RIAs  were \ncompleted:  on  improving  access  to  finance  and  improving  food  safety  through  technical \nregulations.  In  addition,  the  government  will  submit  to  the  Parliament  the  amendments  to  the \nlaw  on  normative  acts  to  introduce  RIA  in  the  rule-making  process  under  the  oversight  of  the \nNational  Legislation  Center.  Under  subprogram  3,  the  government  will  roll  out  the  new  RIA \nsystem  and  publish  RIA  results  on  a  new  government  web  portal.  The  National  Legislation \nCenter will be responsible for quality review of the RIA system.  \n \n22. \nOutput  2:  Strengthened  protection  for  businesses.  The  objective  is  to  increase \ntransparency  and  reduce  expropriation  risks  for  businesses.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  Tax \nCommittee  introduced  public  disclosure  of  information  related  to  legal  entities  (including \nownership,  management,  economic  activity,  capital,  and  contacts).  Under  subprogram  2,  the \ngovernment  completed  the  preparation  of  a  web  portal  that  will  provide  universal  and  free \naccess  to  the  official  database  of  normative  legal  documents.  The  government  also  disclosed \ngender-disaggregated statistics of business ownership to help identify and address the needs of \nbusinesswomen. Subprogram 3 will improve disclosure further to remove regulatory uncertainty.  \n \nUnder  subprogram  1,  the government  enacted  the  Law  on  Investment, 2016  to ensure \n23. \nmore  transparent  and  consistent  treatment  of  incentives  to  investors  and  to  signal  the \ngovernment\u2019s  interest  in  promoting  private  investment.  The  law  establishes  the  right  to \nappropriate  compensation  in  case  of  indirect  expropriation. 14  The  State  Committee  on \nInvestments  and  State  Property  Management  (SCISPM)  is  now  in  charge  of  coordinating \nincentives to investors. Under subprogram 2, the SCISPM publicly disclosed the list of investors \nthat signed investment agreements with the government in 2014 and 2015. Under subprogram \n3, the SCISPM will approve a blueprint for its investment promotion team, including a clear long-\nterm results framework, stronger governance, internal control, and appropriate funding from the \nstate  budget.  The  government  will  also  approve  clear  rules  for  determining  compensation  in \ncase of expropriation. \n \nOutput  3:  Increased  business  innovation  and  productivity.  The  objective  is  to \n24. \nimprove the productivity of businesses operating in Tajikistan. On 1 January 2017, the new cost-\nbased tariff policy for  electricity that  gradually  eliminates indirect  cross  customer  subsidies  will \nbecome  effective,  together  with  an  initial  increase  in  tariffs  for  highly  subsidized  customer \nsegments  including  water  pumps,  irrigation  pumping  stations,  and  government  institutions.  To \nensure  affordability  of  tariff  increases  for  low-income  customers,  the  2017  state  budget \nincreases  the  allocation  for  subsidies  under  the  Targeted  Social  Assistance  Program. \nSubprogram 3 includes measures for improved collection of payments for electricity to improve \nthe sector\u2019s sustainability. \n \n25. \nUnder  subprogram  1,  with  ADB  assistance,  the  government  revised  the  structure  of \nTajikstandard  in  line  with  its  commitments  under  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization, \nand transferred its accreditation functions to the new National Accreditation Center. The center \nhas  an  appropriate  governance  structure,  with  a  supervisory  board  that  includes  some \nindependent members, and will become fully independent of Tajikstandard on 1 January 2017. \n\n                                                \n14 Indirect expropriation occurs when the state interferes with the use of the investor\u2019s property or its benefits, even if \nthe property is not seized and the title not affected (e.g., if government actions force an investor to flee the country, \ndeny an investor access to funds or profits, or compel the investor to sell or transfer at an unfairly low price). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nUnder subprogram 3, the government will continue the restructuring of Tajikstandard. \n \n26. \nTo  provide  employment  opportunities  for  the  increasing  number  of  returning  migrant \nworkers,  under  subprogram  2  the  government  will  transfer  TJS210  million  ($26.7  million \nequivalent)  to  a  professionally  managed    microcredit  refinancing  fund  that  provides  affordable \nlocal currency financing to businesses and farmers via qualified financial institutions, selected in \naccordance  with  commercial  due  diligence.  The  fund  will  help  restore  confidence  in  the  rural \neconomy,  which  has  been  hit  hard  in  the  recent  crisis.  The  fund\u2019s  charter  provides  for  a \nprofessionally  qualified  five-member  board  of  trustees,  of  which  three  are  independent. \nInternational  financial  institutions  will  nominate  two  members  of  the  board  of  trustees  and  the \ngovernment  will  nominate  the  other  two  members  (that  may  not  be  related  parties).  The \ngovernment and the international financial institutions will select the independent chairperson of \nthe board of trustees. \n \n27. \nThe  government  also  allocated  additional  grants  for  cofinancing  of  investments  of \nbusinesses owned by women. Under subprogram 2 the Entrepreneurship Support Fund (ESF) \nintroduced  a  long-term  business  plan  with  relevant  performance  indicators  and  further \nstrengthened its accountability by disclosing its audited financial statements. The ESF will also \nappoint three independent members qualified in credit underwriting for the supervisory board. \n \nChanges  to  subprogram  2.  This  subprogram  includes  three  new  actions  compared \n28. \nwith its original indicative scope: (i) reduction of unnecessary inspection bodies; (ii) reduction of \nadvance  tax  payments;  and  (iii)  a  new  TJS210  million  ($26.7  million  equivalent)  refinancing \ncredit fund for rural businesses and farmers, which replaced the indicative action on establishing \na  credit  guarantee  scheme  for  businesses  owing  to  the  government\u2019s  low  creditworthiness. \nThese additional actions address binding constraints that have become more prominent during \n2016,  and  bring  additional  adjustment  costs  (para. 31)  that  justify  an  increased  size  for \nsubprogram  2  from  the  original  size  of  $20  million.  In  addition,  the  government  has  expedited \nthe completion of the policy action on electronic filing that was included in subprogram 3. Other \nmodifications  include  (i) deferring  the  publishing  of  the  first  RIA  results  to  subprogram  3  since \nthe RIA system is not yet fully in place and the new web portal for disclosure of normative acts \nis  still  being  deployed  and  tested;  (ii) deferring  to  subprogram  3  the  strengthening  of  the \ninvestment  promotion  function,  since  priority  has  been  given  to  more  critical  areas  for  the \ninvestment climate; (iii) deferring to subprogram 3 the appointment of an independent auditor to \nthe  ESF,  since  time  is  required  from  introduction  of  proper  accounting  standards;  and  (iv) \ndeferring the establishment of a new national standardization body to focus the reform efforts in \nthe new accreditation system. \n \nD. \n \nDevelopment financing needs are substantial, particularly for social welfare expenditures \n29. \n(predominantly  pensions)  and capital  expenditures.  Social  expenditures  increased from  36.1% \nof the state budget in 2011 to 44.7% in 2015. ADB budget support under subprogram 1 helped \nto avoid cuts in social and capital expenditures in 2015 and 2016. \n \n30. \nIn  2016,  growth  is  projected  to  remain  below  potential  because  of  the  continued \nrecession  in  the  Russian economy  and weaker performance  in other main trading partners.  In \nJune 2016, the government cut the 2016 budget in $57 million because of lower-than-expected \nrevenues. Still, revenues in the first 9 months of 2016 were TJS390 million ($50 million) below \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs15 \n\n                                                \n15 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fthe  target.  Fiscal  support  is  needed  to  prevent  the  reduction  of  critical  social  expenditures; \naddress  demographic  challenges  (i.e.,  increased pension  demand  and  the return  of migrants); \nand finance subprogram 2. The 2017 budget allocates 41.5% of available resources (or 13.7% \nof GDP) to social expenditures. \n \n31. \nThe  government  is  expected  to  incur  adjustment  costs  and  revenue  losses  from  the \nimplementation  of  policy  reforms  under  subprogram  2.  Most  of  the  costs  will  be  incurred  from \nincreases  in  state  budget  allocations  to  (i)  the  refinancing  credit  fund  for  financing  rural \nbusinesses  and  farmers;  (ii)  government  institutions,  to  pay  for  higher  electricity  tariffs  arising \nfrom  the  reduction  of  implicit  subsidies  in  the  tariffs;  (iii)  the  low-income  population  to \ncompensate  for  higher  electricity  costs  (through  the  Utility  Subsidy  and  the  Targeted  Social \nAssistance  Program)  arising  from  the  new  tariff  policy; 16 and  (iv)  the  ESF  for  financing  of \nbusinesses. The government will also incur foregone revenue costs from reduced advance tax \npayments and from strengthening of the investment incentives regime. \n \n32. \nThe  government  has  requested  (i)  a  grant  not  exceeding  $19.24  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund  [ADF]); 17  and  (ii)  a  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR22.43 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (ADF), both to \nhelp finance its development program, in particular subprogram 2. The loan will have a 24-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nfinancing  agreement.  The  government  does  not  have  access  to  international  sovereign  debt \nmarkets  and  is  closing  the  remaining  financing  gap  by  reducing  less  critical  expenditures  and \nusing cash reserves. \n \nE. \n \n33. \nThe  SCISPM  is  the  executing  agency.  The  implementing  agencies  are  the  Ministry  of \nEconomic Development and Trade, the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources, the Ministry of \nFinance,  the  Ministry  of  Justice,  the  National  Bank  of  Tajikistan,  the  SCISPM,  the  ESF, \nTajikstandard,  the  Tax  Committee,  and  the  Committee  for  Women  and  Family  Affairs.  The \nExecutive Office of the President is overseeing program implementation. \n \n34. \nFinancing  proceeds  for  subprogram  2  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single  tranche  to  the \nGovernment  of  Tajikistan  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as \namended from time to time) upon compliance with all policy actions for subprogram 2 and with \nADB\u2019s  satisfaction  with all  conditions  precedent to loan  and grant  effectiveness. The  expected \nimplementation period for subprogram 2 is January 2016\u2013June 2017. The expected closing date \nis 31 December 2017. \n  \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  program  supports  economic  growth  through  reforms  that  increase  investment \n35. \nopportunities  and  improve  the  capabilities  of  firms  to  set  up  and  improve  value  addition.  The \n                                                \n16  The Targeted Social Assistance Program provides an unconditional cash benefit to eligible low-income households \n\nselected using a centrally administered proxy means test. \n\n17  A country\u2019s eligibility for  ADF grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its risk of debt distress. \nThe  latest  debt  sustainability  analysis  determined  that  Tajikistan  had  a  moderate  risk  of  debt  distress  and  was, \ntherefore, eligible to receive 50% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\ntheir  expected  returns.  The  primary  beneficiaries  are  current  and \n\nreforms  are  expected  to  help  firms  in  Tajikistan  reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business,  thus \nincreasing \nfuture \nentrepreneurs  (including  farmers)  and  investors  who  will  benefit  from  an  improved  business \nenvironment; women entrepreneurs are specifically targeted. The reforms are also expected to \nprovide indirect benefits to the working population (employed and unemployed), as investments \ncreate jobs  and increase wages.  Reduced  regulatory  costs  will  attract  more businesses to  the \nformal  sector,  increasing  the  number  of  formal  jobs.  The  government  is  expected  to  incur \nadjustment  costs  and  revenue  losses  from  the  implementation  of  policy  reforms  under \nsubprogram 2 (para. 31). \n \n36. \nThe  average  small  and  medium-sized  firm  incurs  costs  imposed  by  inspections  and \ncertification equivalent to 16.6% of profits.18 Reducing the high number of bodies with inspection \nfunctions  (more  than  30  in  2016)  that  do  not  monitor  relevant  risks  will  reduce  costs  for \nbusinesses,  similar  to  the  elimination  of  almost  500  outdated  technical  regulations  under \nsubprograms 1 and 2. A reduction of the coefficient for the calculation of profit tax from 1.1 to \n1.0  supported  under  subprogram  2  will  help  reduce  the  tax  burden  for  businesses.  Further \nexpansion of electronic tax declarations\u2014in July 2016 more than 33,000 taxpayers were using \nelectronic  declarations,  up  from  about  6,500  at  the  end  of  2014\u2014improves  transparency, \nreduces opportunities for corruption, and cuts the cost of tax compliance. RIA will improve the \nquality of decision-making and reduce unnecessary costs to businesses arising from new policy \nand regulatory proposals. \n \n37. \nThe  increased  stability  in  legislation,  particularly  taxation,  provided  by  the  new  law  on \ninvestment  as  well  as  the  new  free  electronic  official  gazette of normative acts  will  reduce  the \nperceived  risk  of  corruption  and  expropriation,  and  give  businesses  increased  confidence  to \ninvest in Tajikistan. Public disclosure of gender-disaggregated statistics of business ownership \nand of incentives provided to investors on government websites increases transparency. \n \nSome  private  businesses  pay  tariffs  that  are  almost  triple  those  paid  by  government \n38. \norganizations and state-owned enterprises, which successfully lobby to secure lower tariffs. The \nnew cost-based tariff policy for electricity supported by the program is expected to bring benefits \nfrom (i) additional revenues to a system that charges consumers at a rate lower than required to \nfully  recover  costs,  and  thus  is  not  yet  self-sufficient;  and  (ii)  fairer  competition  for  private \nbusinesses  through  a  more  even  tariff  structure.  The  reform  will  improve  the  reliability  of \nelectricity supply and increase the sustainability of the energy sector. \n \nRestructuring of Tajikstandard and the creation of the National Accreditation Center will \n39. \nreduce conflicts of interest and improve the institutional framework for firms applying for product \nquality  certification  in  Tajikistan.  Improving  product  quality  is  critical  to  reverse  Tajikistan\u2019s \ndecline in international competitiveness (para. 6). \n \n40. \nThe local currency financing facilities supported under subprogram 2 are based on good \nbanking  principles  and  are  expected  to  improve  financing  for  capital  investments,  thereby \nhelping to increase confidence in the rural economy and secure jobs. \n \nB. \n \n41. \n\nThe  government  approved  the  Public  Financial  Management  (PFM)  Strategy,  2009\u2013\n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n18 International  Finance  Corporation.  2009.

PFM \nreform  initiatives  include  the  recent  rollout  of the Targeted  Social  Assistance  Program to most \ndistricts  in  the  country,  the  planned  modernization  of  the  automated  financial  management \nsystem, and the planned strengthening of accounting and reporting capabilities in state-owned \nenterprises. \n \nAn ADB procurement risk assessment showed that public procurement procedures and \n42. \npractices in the country are generally in compliance with international best practice, but issues \nand  areas  for  improvement  were  identified  for  the  transport,  energy,  and  agriculture  sectors \n(footnote 10). \n \n43. \nSubprogram  2  continues  to  promote  transparency  and  reduction  of  opportunities  for \ncorruption  through  (i)  a  reduction  of  unnecessary  government  inspection  of  businesses;  (ii)  a \nnew  RIA  system  that  includes  mechanisms  for  disclosure  of  newly  proposed  legislation;  and \n(iii) a  free,  single  repository  for  legal  acts.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the government and the SCISPM. \n \nC. \n \n44. \nPolicy reforms are expected to have indirect medium- and long-term impacts on poverty, \nmainly  through  more  sustainable  economic  growth  and  increased  employment  opportunities. \nPrivate  investment  is  expected  to  increase  because  of  the  reduced  cost  of  doing  business,  a \nmore  transparent  tax  regime,  better  investor  protection,  improved  access  to  electricity,  and \nimproved  availability  of  local  currency  funding  for  businesses.  Reduced  regulatory  costs  are \nexpected to attract businesses to the formal sector and increase formal jobs; improved business \nproductivity should increase profits and wages. \n \n45. \nThe  program  promotes  equal  opportunities  for  male  and  female  entrepreneurs  by \naddressing  obstacles  faced  in  particular  by  women  entrepreneurs.  Under  subprogram  2,  the \ngovernment provided additional funds to businesses led by women for cofinancing investments, \nand disclosed gender-disaggregated data on women entrepreneurship. The program continues \nto monitor the share of women among entrepreneurs (estimated to be about one third in 2015), \nthe number of women entrepreneurs that receive government financing for investments, and the \nnumber of female taxpayers filing electronic declarations. \n \nD. \n \n46. \nSubprogram  2  is  unlikely  to  have  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment,  require \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  or  affect  indigenous  peoples.

ADB conditions for loan and grant effectiveness (para. 49) aim to  \nimprove  an  understanding  of  risks  in  the  banking  sector  and  improving  debt  sustainability. \nNonetheless,  private  investment  will  likely  remain constrained by  lower  remittance inflows  and \nby  the  banking  crisis.  High  corruption  and  expropriation  risks  are  likely  to  discourage  private \ninvestments,  although  the  program  includes  measures  that  promote  transparency  and \ndiscourages  corrupt  practices (para.  43).  The  PFM  systems  are weak, although  fiduciary  risks \nare  being  addressed  (para.  41).  The  program\u2019s  overall  risk  is  high,  but  the  government  has \nmitigating measures in place. Subprogram 2\u2019s integrated benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the costs. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe  government  and \n\nthe  SCISPM  have  assured  ADB  that \n\n \n48. \nimplementation  of \nsubprogram  2  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the financing agreement. \n \n49. \nTo mitigate the fiscal and banking system risks, the ADB financing for subprogram 2 will \nhave  the  following  conditions  to  effectiveness:  (i)  the  government  has  completed,  to  the \nsatisfaction  of  ADB,  asset  quality  reviews  of  the  five  largest  banks  (Agroinvestbank, \nAmonatbank,  Eskhata,  Orien,  and  Tojiksodirotbank);  and  (ii)  the  government  has  adopted,  to \nthe satisfaction of ADB, a fiscal strategy that will credibly reduce the budget deficit, including the \npublic investment program, to 2.5% of GDP in 2017 and assure that the budget deficit in 2018 \nand 2019 is consistent with debt sustainability.  \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n50. \nI am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan and policy-based grant would comply \nwith the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the \nBoard approve \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR22,433,000  to  the  Republic  of \nTajikistan  for  subprogram  2  of  the  Investment  Climate  Reforms  Program,  from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund),  with  an  interest \ncharge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum thereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft financing agreement presented to the Board; and \nthe  grant  not  exceeding  $19,240,000  to  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan,  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources, for the Investment Climate Reforms Program, on terms \nand  conditions  that  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the \ndraft financing agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n\n1 December 2016 \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n                                                \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Program is Aligned with \nPrivate investment, economic diversification, and competitiveness increaseda \n\n \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nCapabilities and \nopportunities of \nbusinesses to set up \nand expand higher \nvalue-added \nproduction increased \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOutputs \n1.

The  current  Tax  Code  requires \ncalculation  of  profit  tax  based  on  the  previous  year\u2019s  profits \nmultiplied by a coefficient of 1.1 (article 157). This coefficient value \nresults  in  excessive  profit  tax  advance  payments  when  compared \nwith  actual  profits,  particularly  in  the  current  economic  slowdown. \nOn 8 November 2016, the Parliament approved amendments to the \nTax Code to reduce the coefficient used to calculate profit tax based \non the last year\u2019s profits to 1.0. This will reduce the working capital \nneeds for thousands of businesses. \n \nIn July 2016, the Tax Committee Chairman issued an internal order \nestablishing  disciplinary  measures  for  tax  officers  that  request \nadvance tax payments from businesses in excess of those permitted \nin the Tax Code.

This new authentication system is \nfree of charge and allows taxpayers to submit their tax declarations \nthrough  the  Tax  Committee\u2019s  website  (www.andoz.tj).  The  new \nsystem  reduces  costs  of  electronic  submission  of  tax  declarations. \nMore than 33,000 taxpayers are currently electronically registered in \nthe Tax Committee\u2019s system and submitting electronic declarations \nwithout asking for the corresponding paper declaration, an increase \nfrom  6,500  as  of  end-2014.
