Together  with  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  and  international \ncommercial  banks,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  funded  the  greenfield  development  of \nthe plant\u2019s first two LNG production units, called trains, in 2006. The ADB loan for trains 1 and 2 \nwas fully prepaid in 2014.2  \n \n3. \nLNG production from trains 1 and 2 has exceeded expectations, and the sponsors now \nwant to expand the facility by adding a third train. State-owned Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN, \nthe  national  power  utility)  has  committed  to  buy  75%  of  train  3\u2019s  production  to  generate \nelectricity for the domestic market. The remaining 25% of the new unit\u2019s LNG output has been \ncommitted to Kansai Electric of Japan. \n \n4. \nSupporting  cleaner  power  generation  using  indigenous  fuel.  Indonesia\u2019s economy \nis  Southeast  Asia\u2019s  largest.  Gross  domestic  product  was  an  estimated  $888.5  billion  in  2014, \nand economic growth since the 1997 Asian financial crisis has averaged about 5% a year. The \ncountry  has transitioned from  a resource-  and  export-based  economy  to  a  manufacturing  one, \nbut the energy sector has not kept pace with either the overall growth or change.3 Investment in \nexploration  for  and  the  production,  transport,  conversion,  and  distribution  of  energy  has  been \ninadequate  and  often  carried  out  inefficiently. 4  The  power  subsector  has  fallen  particularly \nbehind.  The  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources  estimates  that  rising  demand  for \nelectricity,  which  is  forecasted  to  increase  by  8.5%  per  annum  under  the  current  economic \ngrowth projections, will create a power shortage of about 35 gigawatts (GW) before 2020. \n \nThe  Government  of  Indonesia  is  facilitating  PLN\u2019s  procurement 5  of  new  generation \n5. \ncapacity  through  an  expansion  program  in  which  13  of  35  GW  are  expected  to  be  gas-fired \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2005. Reports and Recommendations of the President to the Board of Directors Tangguh Liquefied Natural \n\nGas Project. Manila \n\n3  In 2013, Indonesia\u2019s national office of statistics estimated that gross domestic product derived from the following \nsectors: manufacturing (24%); agriculture (14%); trade, hotel, and hospitality (14%); mining and quarrying (11%); \nconstruction  (10%);  government  and  private  services  (11%);  finance,  real  estate,  and  business  services  (8%); \ntransport and communication (7%); and electricity, gas, and water supply (1%). \n\n4  ADB. 2015. Summary of Indonesia\u2019s Energy Sector Assessment. ADB Papers on Indonesia, No. 9. Manila. \n5  A  2009 electricity  law  formally  ended  PLN\u2019s  monopoly  on  the  power  sector.  However,  the  utility  is still  the major \nprovider of electricity infrastructure in the country and owns roughly 85% of the total generation capacity. To deal \nwith the projected power shortage, the government introduced a series of programs to fast-track power generation \nexpansion.  The  latest,  launched  in  2015,  targets  the  development  of  35  GW  of  new  power  generation  capacity, \n36% of which is expected to be gas-fired. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\npower plants.6 At present, natural gas accounts for about 25% of PLN fuel mix, but the utility has \nbeen  struggling  to  ensure  steady  and  reliable  supply  while  competing  with  growing \nmanufacturing  and  petrochemical  businesses  that  have  driven  the  growth  of  gas\u2019  domestic \ndemand.7 . The LNG from Tangguh will ensure to PLN the much needed relief from intermittent \ngas supply and support the expansion of PLN\u2019s growing gas-fired generation capacity. \n \n6. \nSupporting sustainable growth. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources sees a \ngreater  role  for  natural  gas  as  important  to  its  goal  of  reducing  the  use  of  oil  and  coal  in  the \ncountry,  particularly  for  power  generation.  The  use  of  gas-fired  generation  can  improve  the \nenvironmental sustainability of the current energy mix by displacing diesel and coal as fuels for \npeak electricity generation. Gas engines and turbines can ramp up more quickly than coal and \ndiesel-fired  units  and  thus  are  better  suited  to  responding  rapidly  to  load  fluctuations.  This  in \nturn  can  enable  greater  use  of  renewable  energy  sources  such  as  wind  and  solar  that  can \nprovide  power  only  intermittently,  as  well  as  eliminate  the  need  to  invest  in  the  large  and \nexpensive  battery  storage  capacity  these  renewable  systems  might  otherwise  require.8 ADB \ncalculates  that  using  the  gas  from  the  new  train  3  to  generate  power  rather  than  coal  could \nresult in emission savings of up to 9.15 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. \n \n7. \nThe project is also of important to Indonesia\u2019s future economic growth. The country was \none of the world\u2019s largest LNG exporters in the early 1990s, accounting for almost 25% of global \nLNG exports.9 Competition from new entrants in the LNG export markets had reduced this share \nto only about 6.6% by 2015.10 Meanwhile, the country\u2019s gas reserves have been declining, and \nnew  fields  are  increasingly  smaller,  more  remote,  and  located  in  deeper  waters.  This  makes \nthem  more  costly  to  exploit.  The  development  of  train  3  at  the  Tangguh  plant  will  help  the \ncountry expand use of an existing gas reserve at a cost that is competitive with other large LNG \ndevelopments. This  is  because  of the  economies  of  scale that  will  be  achieved  by  building  on \nthe existing LNG facilities. The 25% of production committed to the export market will help the \ngovernment maintain access to hard currency. \n \n8. \nSupporting  inclusive  growth  in  eastern  Indonesia.  The  project  will  enable  ADB  to \ncontinue  making  a  positive  impact  on  the  inclusive  growth  in  eastern  Indonesia  it  achieved \nunder its earlier project to develop the facility\u2019s first and second trains.11 That project was rated \nexcellent for private sector development by both ADB\u2019s extended annual review report12 and the \nsubsequent  validation  report  by  ADB\u2019s  Independent  Evaluation  Department.  Inclusive  growth \nwas  achieved  by  creating  thousands  of  jobs  and  helping  to  improve  livelihoods  in  one  of  the \npoorest regions of Indonesia. The initial Tangguh LNG operation was the first upstream oil and \n\n                                                 \n6  The energy division of the Southeast Asia Department of ADB is proposing to support the government with a $500 \nmillion  sector  loan  to  help  improve  access  to  electricity  services  in  eastern  Indonesia.  The  loan  would  help  PLN \ndevelop a cluster of new small to medium-sized gas-fired power stations. The new power stations will have lower \ngeneration costs and emit less pollutants and carbon dioxide than similar diesel-fired units. The concept paper for \nthis project was cleared in March 2016. \n\n7  Indonesia\u2019s LNG consumption grew from 35.7 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2004 to 38.4 bcm in 2014, peaking at \n43.4 bcm in 2010. The year-on-year growth in 2014 was 5.1%, compared with 2% growth in the Asia and Pacific \nregion and 0.4% globally. Source: BP. 2015. BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2015. \n\n8  For example, an off-the-shelf Wartsila gas engine has a ramp-up rate of 100 MW per minute, which means that the \nengine  goes  from  zero  to  50  MW  of  power  generation  capacity  in  just  30  seconds.  The  proposed  ADB  loan \n(footnote 6) will include some pilot gas-solar hybrid units in loan projects being discussed with PLN. \n\n9 International Gas Union. World LNG Report \u2013 2016 Edition. \n10 International Gas Union (2016). \n11 ADB. 2014. Validation Report: Tangguh Liquefied Natural Gas Project. Manila \n12 ADB. 2012. Extended Annual Review Report: Tangguh Liquefied Natural Gas Project in Indonesia. Manila \n\n\fgas  project  in  Indonesia  developed  through  public  consultations  with  local  communities  and \ngovernments that were led by ADB environmental and social safeguards teams. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n9. \nTrains  1  and  2  of  the  Tangguh  plant  were  designed  to  produce  3.8  million  metric  tons \nper annum (mmtpa) of LNG each. The output has been sold to buyers in the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States through long-term agreements. \nTrain  3  is  expected  to  have  the  same  capacity  as  each  of  the  first  two  and  thus  expand  the \nfacility\u2019s existing LNG production by 50%.  The project will add the third 3.8 mmtpa LNG train as \nwell  as  the  associated  offshore  and  onshore  facilities  and  other  supporting  infrastructure.  The \nnew train is expected to start operations in 2020. \n \n10. \nThe  onshore  train  3  facility  will  be  constructed  adjacent  to  trains  1  and  2,  using  smart \nstandardization\u2014i.e.,  using  the  same  specifications  as  those  for  the  first  two  trains  with \nalterations  based  on  the  lessons  learned  over  the  plant\u2019s  7  years  of  operations  and  the  latest \nbest  practices  in  the  industry.  Two  additional  offshore  unmanned  platforms  are  going  to  be \ndeveloped  for  this  purpose.13 The  fields  supplying  the  Tangguh  facilities  are  within  the  Berau, \nMuturi,  and  Wiriagar  concession  areas  covered  by  three  production  sharing  contracts  (PSCs) \nentered  into  between  several  international  oil  and  gas  companies  and  the  government, \nrepresented by a special task force for upstream oil and gas business activities established by \npresidential decree.14  \n \n11. \nAs was the case in all other LNG projects in Indonesia, including the existing Tangguh \nplant,  the  project  will  be  financed  through  a  trustee  borrowing  scheme  (TBS).  The  TBS  is  a \nfinancing  scheme  developed  in  1986  to  facilitate  financing  for  the  Bontang  LNG  project  within \nthe government\u2019s regulatory framework that limits the ownership of upstream oil and gas assets \nto  the  government.  Since  then,  all  LNG  projects  in  the  country  have  been  financed  under  the \nTBS. Under the TBS, financiers lend funds to an offshore trustee acting as borrower and paying \nagent. The funds are in turn made available to the project. All LNG revenues are sent directly to \nthe offshore trustee. The trustee makes the loan interest payments and principal repayments to \nlenders  out  of  a  percentage  of  LNG  revenues  that  is  called  the  source  of  debt service. These \npayments are made before (with respect to source of debt service only) other costs or taxes are \ndeducted. \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Sponsors \n\n12. \nBased  on  the  three  Tangguh  PSCs,  the  working  interests  in  the  Tangguh  LNG  project \nare  shared  between  the  government  (through  the  special  task  force  for  upstream  oil  and  gas \nbusiness  activities)  and  10  experienced  international  oil  and  gas  contractors.  The  sponsors \ninclude  BP  and  CNOOC,  Japan  Oil,  Gas,  and  Metals  National  Corporation  (JOGMEC), \nMitsubishi  Corporation,  INPEX  Corporation,  JX  Nippon,  Mitsui,  Sojitz  Corporation,  and \nSumitomo  Corporation.  BP  Berau,  a  subsidiary  of  BP,  operates  the  project  on  behalf  of  the \nsponsors. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n13 Trains 1 and 2 are fed by two offshore unmanned platforms that extract gas from the Vorwata field, which is the \n\nonly one currently developed in the concession area. \n\n14 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nGuarantee.  BP  Corporation  North  America  Inc.  (BPCNAI)  will  fully  guarantee  the \n13. \nproposed  ADB  loan.  The  unconditional  and  irrevocable  guarantee  is  expected  to  cover  the \nproject\u2019s entire payment obligation under the ADB loan. BPCNAI is a wholly owned subsidiary of \nBP and its largest subsidiary worldwide. In 2015, it recorded total sales of $223 billion. BPCNAI \nis  currently  rated  A3  with  a  positive  outlook  by  Moody's  and  A\u2013  with  a  stable  outlook  by \nStandard & Poor's (S&P). \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n\n14. \nImpacts.  The  Tangguh  LNG  expansion  will  provide  much-needed  natural  gas  to  help \nmeet  rapidly  growing  domestic  demand,  particularly  in  the  power  sector.  In  line  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s  policy,  the  project  will  support  development  of  a  more  sustainable  fuel  mix  to \nreduce carbon emissions by using natural gas to displace coal or diesel in powering electricity \ngeneration (para. 5). This will help improve the quality of life in Indonesia and be a key driver of \ngreater economic activity. The project will accelerate economic development in the province of \nWest Papua, providing additional local employment opportunities and scope for human resource \ndevelopment in one of the country\u2019s poorest regions. \n \n15. \nOutcome.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  gas  production  for  domestic  use.  The \nTangguh facility\u2019s production capacity is expected to expand from 7.6 mmtpa to 11.4 mmtpa per \nannum with the addition of train 3, 75% of which is committed to help meet domestic demand for \nelectricity.  \n \n16.   Output. The output will be the completion of train 3 and the related infrastructure. This \nwill  include  the  completion  and  start  of  operations  of  two  additional  offshore  unmanned \nplatforms;  29  kilometers  of  undersea  gas  pipeline;  one  additional  LNG  jetty;  the  additional  3.8 \nmmtpa  LNG  production  train;  one  additional  utility  for  power  generation;  and  additional  water \ntreatment,  wastewater  treatment,  and  appropriate  expansion  of  solid  waste  management \nfacilities. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nConsistency with ADB Strategy and country strategy. The project aligns with ADB\u2019s \n17. \nMidterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  by  promoting  environmentally  sustainable  growth.  15 \nExpanding  the  LNG  infrastructure  and  domestic  gas  supply  in  Indonesia  has  the  potential  to \noffset  greenhouse  gas  emissions  generated  by  coal-fired  or  diesel-fired  power  plants.  The \nproject  is  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  interim  country  partnership  strategy  for  Indonesia  for \n2015,16 because it seeks to improve Indonesia\u2019s energy security, diversify its domestic fuel mix \ndiversification,  and  support  economic  growth  in  the  less-developed  eastern  region  of  the \ncountry.  \n \n18. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  In  line  with \nIndonesia\u2019s  National  Energy  Policy 17  and  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy, 18  ADB  has  focused  on \npromoting  power-generation  alternatives  that  are  more  sustainable  than  coal-  and  diesel-fired \ngeneration. While coal and diesel are still the dominant fuels in Indonesia\u2019s energy mix, ADB is \ncommitted  through  its  public  and  private  sector  operations  to  support  the  development  of  the \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2014.

The  law  distinguishes  between  upstream  and  downstream \nactivities. Upstream activities are to be conducted under cooperation contracts with the \ngovernment\u2019s special working unit. This is currently the special task force for upstream \noil and gas business activities, based on presidential regulation number 9 of 2013.  \n\nBP  Berau  is  the  operator  of  the  Tangguh  LNG  facility.  BP  Berau  is  a  wholly  owned \nsubsidiary  of  BP.  The  operator  has  remained  unchanged since  the start  of  the  plant\u2019s \noperations in 2009.

The  loan  will  be  guaranteed  by  BPCNAI,  which  is  currently  rated  A3  by \nMoody\u2019s and A\u2013 by S&P. \n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n21. \nADB\u2019s role in the project will be similar to the one it played in the financing for the initial \ntwo  trains  of  the  Tangguh  LNG  facility.  It  will  mitigate  the  risks  for  all  the  stakeholders  of \nsubstandard implementation of environmental and social safeguards. ADB\u2019s additionality in the \noriginal  Tangguh  LNG  greenfield  development  project  was  rated  excellent:  ADB\u2019s  work \npromoted sustainable LNG development and inclusive growth (footnote 12). The value added by \nADB  in  the  greenfield  development  was  confirmed  in  ADB\u2019s  Independent  Evaluation \nDepartment\u2019s  validation  report  and  in  these  ways  has  been  repeatedly  cited  publicly  by  the \ngovernment  and  BP.  ADB  due  diligence  for  the  proposed  project  showed  that  ADB  can  help \nimprove  some  of  the  environmental  and  social  safeguards  during  the  operation  so  that  they \nmeet international standards that go beyond those set by Indonesia\u2019s law. The sponsors have \nrecognized the additional positive value of ADB\u2019s participation in the financing and execution of \nthe  original  Tangguh  development  and  have  asked  that  it  continue  this  support  through  the \nplant\u2019s expansion. This will ensure that the safeguard achievements of the initial operation will \nbe sustained.  \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\n25.   Sponsor  risk.

As  an  expansion  of  an  existing  brownfield  project,  the \nTangguh  LNG  expansion  should  experience  reduced  construction  and  operational  risks. \nLessons learned from trains 1 and 2 are well-understood and will be applied in the design and \nconstruction of train 3, with BP Berau serving as project manager for the expansion.  \n \nOperation  and  management  risk.  BP  Berau,  the  operator  of  Tangguh,  will  manage \n27. \ntrain  3  as  part  of  an  integrated  LNG  production  complex.  In  addition  to  its  parent\u2019s  global \nexperience  on  LNG  projects,  BP  Berau  has  a  solid  track  record  of  successful  operations  at \nTangguh  and  is  well-positioned  to  manage  the  expanded  LNG  facility,  particularly  from  a \ntechnical and staffing perspective. \n\nGas reserve risk. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\nForeign exchange risk. Revenue from LNG proceeds will be paid entirely in US dollar. \n\n \n28. \nOfftake and pricing risks. The project has contracted long-term take-or-pay sales and \npurchase agreements with PLN and Kansai Electric Power covering 100% of the total estimated \ntrain 3 production, effectively mitigating offtake risk.  \n \n29. \n \n30. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n31. \nservice to ADB.  \n \n32. \nEnvironmental  and  social  risks.  Environmental  and  social  impacts  and  mitigation \nmeasures  are  comprehensively  addressed  in  an  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment \n(ESIA)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements.  Greater  use  of  LNG  is  recognized  as  an \nimportant part of the change in the energy mix required to transition to a low-carbon economy. \n\nGuarantor risk. The guarantor risk is acceptable. BPCNAI guarantees the project\u2019s debt \n\n\fBased  on  energy  produced  or  consumed,  LNG  use  can  result  in  lower  emissions  of  the \ngreenhouse gases implicated in global warming than the use of coal or diesel.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n33. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \ncategory A for environment and indigenous people and category B for involuntary resettlement. \nThe potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been identified and effective \nmeasures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  are \nincorporated  in  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans.  The  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of \nthe sponsors to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \nEnvironment.  Because  the  project  involves  the  expansion  of  the  existing  LNG  facility \n34. \nand infrastructure and operations similar to those of the original two trains, most of the required \nenvironmental safeguards measures and the institutional capacity are already in place, as is a \ncommitment  to  meet  these  standards.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement, \nan audit of the existing facilities was carried out, and the project sponsors have agreed to take \nthe  limited  number  of  corrective  actions  recommended  in  audit  report.19 The  government  has \napproved the project on the basis of an environmental and social impact assessment (analisis \nmengenai dampak lingkungan [AMDAL]) prepared by BP Berau in 2014 that meets Indonesia\u2019s \nown requirements. ADB has requested that supplements be added to the assessment to bring it \ninto  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements. 20 The  project  is  located  in  an \narea of biodiversity significance and classified by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement as critical \nhabitat.  A  critical  habitat  assessment  has  demonstrated  that  the  project  is  able  to  operate  in \ncompliance with the critical habitat requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n35. \nThe operations of train 3 will generate additional emissions which will meet be monitored \nto  ensure  they  meet  local  requirements  and  international  discharge  standards.  Before  and \nduring  construction,  the  EPC  contractor  will  be  required  to  develop  and  implement  detailed \nconstruction  environmental  and  safety  management  plans  that  are  consistent  with  BP\u2019s \nstringent requirements and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nSocial  safeguards.  The  social  safeguards  compliance  audit  undertaken  on  the \n36. \nconstruction and operation of trains 1 and 2 under the previous ADB project concludes that prior \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  were  managed  in  compliance  with  the  ADB \nsafeguard policies applicable at that time and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.21 Closure of \none  outstanding  issue  on  land  titling  in  the  village  of  Onar  Baru  was  completed  at  the  end  of \n2016.  \n \n37. \nThe  project  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  category  A  for \nindigenous peoples. No additional land is required, and no physical displacement is expected. A \nbulk off-loading facility will affect the subsistence of 17 foot-fisherfolks in Tanah Merah village. \n                                                 \n19 Compliance Audit Report: http://www.adb.org/projects/documents/ino-tangguh-lng-expansion-may-2016-ecar \n20 Environmental  and  Social \n\nincluding  AMDAL  and  supplementary  appendixes: \n\nImpact  Assessment \n\nhttp://www.adb.org/projects/documents/ino-tangguh-lng-expansion-may-2016-esia  \n\n21 The outcome was also previously confirmed by ADB;s extended annual review report in 2012 (footnote 12). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nTemporary disturbance to their fishing activities is expected during the construction of one of the \ntwo  offshore  platforms.  People  affected  by  economic  displacement  due  to  the  project  will  be \nprovided  with  livelihood  development  programs  under  the  ADB  project\u2019s  resettlement  and \nindigenous  peoples  plan  (RIPP).  The  RIPP  incorporates  the  Tangguh  Social  Management \n(TSM)  which  embodies  the  Project\u2019s  long  term  commitments  and  the  5-yearly  Tangguh \nSustainable  Development  Program  (TSDP  2016-2020)  formulated  by  the  operator,  BP  Berau. \nIndigenous peoples residing in the Tangguh social influence area along the coast of Bintuni Bay \nare expected to be adversely affected by project activities and targeted as beneficiaries under \nthe  RIPP.  The  RIPP  will  be  implemented  by  capable,  experienced  staff  from  the  project\u2019s \ncommunications and external affairs team. The Tangguh project has allocated sufficient budget \nto carry out the programs and activities agreed with the government and the local community. \n \nThe  RIPP,  TSM  and  TSDP  reflect  the  consultation  process  undertaken  by  the  project \n38. \nduring  the  development  of  the  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment.  BP  Berau \nconducted additional consultations and disseminated information on the RIPP and the TSDP as \nwell  as  on  environmental  safeguards  in  July  2016  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement requirements. \n \n39. \nOther  social  dimensions.  The  project  is  classified  as  having  some  gender  elements. \nMeasures to benefit women or facilitate their involvement in the construction and operations of \nthe project facilities have been incorporated in project design in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy \non  Gender  and  Development  (1998).  Such  measures  are  embedded  under  the  RIPP  and  the \nprogram.  The  project  company  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s \nSocial  Protection  Strategy,  will  take  measures  through  its  Tangguh\u2019s  workforce  and  industrial \nrelations  management  strategy  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.22 The  project  company  will  report  regularly  to  ADB  on  (i)  its  and  its  contractors\u2019 \ncompliance with such laws, and (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation \nwith affected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n40. \nThe  Tangguh  project  sponsors  and  operator  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of \nimplementing  best  international  practice  relating  to  combating  corruption,  money  laundering, \nand  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes \nappropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, \nand remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\n41. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter), 23  ADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the \nGovernment of Indonesia has no objection to the proposed assistance to the project.
