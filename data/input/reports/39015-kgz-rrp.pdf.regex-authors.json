No significant adverse environmental impact is anticipated. \nAssessment \n   \nSocial  Involuntary resettlement: Category C. \nSafeguards  Impact on indigenous people: Category C. \nAssessment \n   \nProject  The proposed Tax Administration Reform and Modernization Project is a \nDescription  continuation  of  support  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \npromote economic growth and public governance by improving revenue \nadministration. It also provides follow-through support for the 2004 ADB \nproject  loan  for  customs  modernization  (2113-KGZ:  Regional  Customs \nModernization and Infrastructure Development Project). The Project is in \nline with the Government\u2019s objective in its Country Development Strategy of \nintroducing modern technology in tax administration, improving operations, \nand  reducing  corruption.  The  Project  will  finance  (i) the  acquisition  of \nequipment and software to develop a central database and management \ninformation  system  (MIS)  for  the  State  Committee  for  Taxes  and \nCollections (SCTC); (ii) the development of a communication infrastructure \nto link the central database to tax offices; and (iii) the establishment of \nmodern central facilities for the Large Taxpayers Unit (LTU), Bishkek tax \noffice, taxpayer service center, and SCTC staff development center. \n   \nRationale  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  maintained  macroeconomic  stability  and \nachieved steady growth, despite economic and political shocks. During \n2000\u20132005, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 3.9% \nand  inflation  remained  modest  at  4.4%.  Notwithstanding  political \nuncertainties  in  2005\u20132006,  structural  reforms  continued  to  progress. \nGrowth in 2006 is estimated at about 3%, with inflation remaining below \n6%. For 2007, GDP growth is projected to be 5.5% and inflation 4.5%. \n ", "ii   \n  Fiscal  consolidation  has  been  an  important  component  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic economy\u2019s good performance, and will be vital in sustaining its \nachievements. The general Government fiscal deficit, which had exceeded \n9% of GDP during 1996\u20132000, declined to about 5% of GDP during 2001\u2013\n2005. Consequently, external public debt fell from 111% of GDP in 2001 to \n70% of GDP in 2006. This fiscal achievement has been due to good \ncontrol of expenditures and modest increases in tax collection. During \n2000\u20132005,  tax  collection  (excluding  customs  revenues  and  local \ngovernments) increased from 13.3% of GDP to about 15% of GDP. \n \nHowever,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  faces  the  dual  fiscal  challenges  of \nmaintaining its prudent fiscal policy to sustain macroeconomic stability and \neconomic  growth,  while  providing  for  priority  economic  and  social \nexpenditures to help raise per capita GDP above $540 and meet the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n \nReconciling  these  challenges  will  require  sustained  increases  in  tax \ncollection. However, tax administration is beset by inadequate equipment \nand  facilities,  inefficient  practices,  and  inadequate  staff  skills. \nConsequently, tax collection is below potential, operations are error-ridden \nand prone to corruption, and tax administration is not perceived to be \nconducive  to  business  and  private  sector  development.  SCTC  needs \nreform and modernization to install appropriate infrastructure, instill best \npractices  in  tax  administration,  reform  its  business  processes  and \nworkflows, upgrade its staff\u2019s skills, and ensure that its operations use \nmodern  technology.  These  would  enable  SCTC  to  (i)  increase  its \nefficiency and staff skills, thereby improving its tax collection capacity, \ngovernance, and transparency; (ii) minimize corruption; and (iii) reduce \ncompliance costs. \n   \nImpact and  The  proposed  Project  will  help  increase  the  effectiveness  of  tax \nOutcome  administration  to  ensure  sustained  fiscal  consolidation  and \nmacroeconomic stability. The outcome of the Project is a modern and \nefficient  SCTC  that  achieves  improvements  in  tax  collection.  The \naccompanying TAs will necessarily have the same impact and outcome, to \nwhich attainment they will contribute with complementary outputs. \n   \nProject  The Project is estimated to cost the equivalent of $12.5 million, including \nInvestment Plan  contingencies, taxes, and duties. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nSource  Total Cost  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  10.00  80 \nGrant \nGovernment  2.50  20 \n  Total  12.50  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n   \nProject Grant  ADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $10 million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nAmount   resources. \n ", "  iii\nPeriod of  Until 30 September 2012 \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The Office of the Government (OG) will be the Executing Agency. SCTC \nArrangements  will be the Implementing Agency. A project steering committee (PSC), \nheaded by a representative from OG, will be established to oversee and \ncoordinate  the  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  PSC  will  include \nrepresentatives from relevant Government agencies and private sector \nstakeholders.  A  project  management  office  (PMO),  headed  by  a \ncompetitively recruited general manager, will be established and function \nunder the OG supervision. \n   \nProcurement and  All  services,  supplies,  and  equipment  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be \nConsulting  procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \nServices  amended from time to time). Goods, equipment, and materials costing \nmore than $0.50 million will be procured through international competitive \nbidding, while those valued between $0.10 million and $0.50 million will be \nprocured through national competitive bidding.  \n \nCivil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  more  than  the  equivalent  of \n$1 million will be carried out using international competitive bidding, while \nnational competitive bidding will be used for those valued at less than $1 \nmillion.  \n   \n  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, foreign contractors \nmay participate in bidding for national competitive contracts. \n \nAll consultants will be recruited on an individual basis in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time), and ADB\u2019s procedures for recruiting individual consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits  The proposed Project will promote economic growth by providing the fiscal \nand Beneficiaries  space (i.e., increased tax revenues) to maintain macroeconomic stability, \nwhile providing for priority economic and social expenditures. The direct \nand quantifiable financial benefits from the Project are improvements in \ntax revenues due to more efficient collection. The Project will lead to an \nestimated increase in tax revenues equivalent to 0.1% of GDP in 2012 \n(compared with the \u201cwithout project\u201d scenario). This will rise to 0.5% of \nGDP by 2015 and remain constant thereafter. On this basis, the financial \ninternal rate of return (FIRR) of the Project is estimated to be 34%. \n \n   ", "iv   \n  However, this is probably a conservative estimate of the financial benefits \nfor two reasons. First, improved tax collection helps foster faster economic \ngrowth  by  contributing  to  macroeconomic  stability.  Second,  taxpayers \n(individuals and businesses) will benefit from SCTC procedures that are \nmore efficient, which will reduce their compliance costs and facilitate their \nbusiness operations; and from improved governance, which will reduce \nthe costs of corruption. These two mechanisms would expand the tax \nbase,  lead  to  additional  increases  in  tax  revenues,  and  spur  growth. \nHence, the estimated FIRRs for the Project are lower bounds. \n \nBy  their  nature,  these  two  additional  benefits  cannot  be  quantified \nreasonably.  Additional  benefits  that  are  difficult  to  quantify  arise  from \nimprovements  in  social  welfare  when  the  increased  tax  revenues  are \nchanneled to social and economic expenditures that assist the poorer \nsegments of Kyrgyz Republic society. \n   \nRisks and  The proposed Project does not have any unusual technical risks. Risks \nAssumptions  during project implementation arise mainly from (i) potential delays due to \nSCTC\u2019s  lack  of  experience  with  ADB  requirements  and  procedures, \n(ii) potential difficulties in coordinating SCTC\u2019s central database with the \ninfrastructure of other agencies, and (iii) potential difficulties of SCTC staff \nin adjusting to the new procedures and facilities. These risks are mitigated \nby steps taken during the project preparatory technical assistance (TA), \nongoing measures adopted by the Government and SCTC, the project and \nTA  design,  and  Government  assurances.  Key  SCTC  staff  received \nintensive orientation in ADB procedures during the project preparatory TA. \nDuring project implementation, internationally experienced consultants will \nprovide support and training to the PMO and SCTC to ensure equipment \nand works comply with the design requirements and ADB procedures. As \na  complement  to  the  overall  Project,  institutional  strengthening  and \nchange management have been incorporated to facilitate the adjustment \nof SCTC staff to the new framework. \n \nRisks  could  also  include  inadequate  budget  for  operations  and \nmaintenance,  and  difficulties  in  recruiting  and  retaining  competent \ninformation and communication technology (ICT) personnel. However, the \nGovernment has provided assurances that adequate counterpart funds will \nbe  provided  during  and  after  project  implementation  to  ensure \nsustainability. Furthermore, the reform action plan that SCTC developed \nwith  assistance  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund  calls  for  the \nintroduction of a merit-based pay system. The significant financial returns \nenvisaged with the successful implementation of the Project, which would \nenable SCTC to continually upgrade its operations and staffing, would \nmitigate both of these risks. \n \n ", "  v\n  Other risks include political shocks that could reduce the continuity of \npolicy, as well as political pressures that could hinder the Project\u2019s reform \nand  modernization  goals.  These  risks  are  mitigated  by  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s  continuing  commitment  to  pursuing  macroeconomic  stability \nand structural reforms under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility \nprogram, as well as development partners\u2019 close attention to the policy \nenvironment. Passage of the new Tax Code will also help establish a \nfavorable environment for tax administration. \n   \nTechnical  Two accompanying TA grants will be provided to ensure effective project \nAssistance  implementation,  build  capacity,  and  enhance  sustainability.  The  TA \nconsultants will work closely with the implementing agency, PMO, relevant \nagencies and institutions, private sector stakeholders, and ADB staff. The \nteam leader/international tax administration reform specialist for the first \nTA will be the leader of the two TAs. In that capacity, the team leader will \nwork closely with the PMO general manager to ensure that the two TAs\u2019 \nactivities  dovetail  with  the  implementation  of  the  physical  investment \ncomponent of the Project. \n \nThe proposed TA for Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building for \nTax Administration Reform is expected to cost the equivalent of $600,000. \nADB will provide a grant for $500,000 from its TA funding program, while \nthe Government will finance the remaining cost equivalent to $100,000. \nThe TA will help SCTC (i) build capacity for modern tax administration \nprocedures,  (iii) establish  a  goal-setting  and  performance  management \nsystem, and (iii) establish taxpayer education and services and conduct a \npublic awareness campaign. The TA will finance the services of a team \nleader/international  tax  administration  reform  specialist  (10  person-\nmonths), an international tax administration training specialist (6 person-\nmonths),  a  national  tax  administration  reform  specialist  (10  person-\nmonths), and a national tax administration training specialist (8 person-\nmonths). \n \n  The  proposed  TA  for  Business  Process  Reengineering  and  Change \nManagement for Tax Administration Modernization is expected to cost the \nequivalent of $600,000. ADB will administer a grant for $500,000 provided \nby the Government of the Republic of Korea. The Government will finance \nthe remaining cost of $100,000. The TA will help SCTC (i) develop its \nstaff\u2019s skills in ICT and business analytics, (ii) undertake business process \nreengineering  of  key  tax  functions,  and  (iii) implement  a  change \nmanagement program. The TA will finance the services of an international \ntax  administration  ICT  specialist  (10  person-months),  an  international \nchange  management  specialist  (6  person-months),  a  national  tax \nadministration ICT specialist (10 person-months), and a national change \nmanagement specialist (8 person-months). \n \n   ", "o o\n71  00'E 78  00'E\nKYRGYZ  REPUBLIC\nTAX ADMINISTRATION REFORM AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT\nK A Z A K H S T A N\nTyup\no o\n42  30'N Dzhergalan 42  30'N\nShopokov Cholpon-Ata\nKara Kol\nKara Balta BISHKEK Tokmok Lake Issyk-Kul\nCHUI Balykchy\nMaimak Talas ISSYK-KUL\nKochkorka\nTALAS\nChaek\nToktogul Lake Song-Kul\nToktogul Reservoir\nNARYN\nKarakul Naryn\nTerek Sai JALAL-ABAD\nTash Kumyr\nShamaldy Sai Kok Yangak\nKochkor Ata\nJalal-Abad Lake Chatyr-Kul\nAndizhan Reservoir\nUZBEKISTAN Kara Su Uzgen\nN\nOsh\nNaiman 0 50 100\nTAJIKISTAN Kyzyl Kiya OSH\nBatken Frunze\nKilometers\n38o  00'N PEOPLE'S    REPUBLIC 38o  00'N\nHaidarkan Sary Tash OF   CHINA \nNational Capital\nSulyukta\nBATKEN\nProvincial Capital\nCity/Town\nMain Road\nRailway\nTAJIKISTAN River\nProvincial Boundary\nInternational Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n0\n7\n-0\n4\n2\n4 o o\n H 71  00'E 78  00'E\nR", " \nI.

RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n2.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  maintained  macroeconomic  stability  and  achieved  steady \ngrowth. Economic performance has been satisfactory under the Poverty Reduction and Growth \nFacility (PRGF) programs with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) since 2001. During 2000\u2013\n2005,  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  averaged  3.9%,  while  average  inflation \nremained modest at 4.4%. More recently, despite political uncertainties in 2005\u20132006, economic \nstability was maintained and structural reforms progressed. GDP growth in 2006 is estimated at \nabout 3%, with inflation at 5.6%. For 2007, growth is projected to be 5.5% and inflation 4.5%. \n \n3.  Exports have risen strongly since the late 1990s. Due mainly to the development of the \nKumtor gold mine, exports grew annually by about 10.5% during 2000\u20132005. However, because \nimport growth has been faster at 16.5%, the Kyrgyz Republic has incurred persistent trade and \ncurrent account deficits. Foreign direct investment and unrequited flows (chiefly remittances) \nhave financed these deficits comfortably. Consequently, international reserves have improved \nsteadily, reaching about $817 million (4 months of imports) in 2007. \n \n4.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  development  partners  have  approved  of  the  economy\u2019s \nperformance. First, the Paris Club granted debt relief in March 2005, reducing the present value \nof the debt owed to that group of creditors by about 60%. Second, the Kyrgyz Republic reached \nan agreement with IMF on a new 3-year PRGF arrangement in 2005. Third, having established \na track record of satisfactory macroeconomic performance and structural reforms under IMF \nand World Bank programs, the Kyrgyz Republic qualified in 2006 for debt relief under the \nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The Government, however, has declined to \nparticipate in the initiative. \n \n5.  By  complementing  the  prudent  monetary  stance,  fiscal  consolidation  has  been  an \nimportant component in the economy\u2019s strong performance. The general Government fiscal \ndeficit, which had exceeded 10% of GDP during 1996\u20131999, declined to about 5% of GDP \nduring 2000\u20132005. Consequently, external public debt fell from 111% of GDP in 2001 to 70% of \nGDP in 2006. This fiscal achievement has been due to good control of total expenditure and \nmodest  increases  in  tax  collection.  During  2000\u20132006,  tax  collection  (excluding  customs \nrevenues and local governments) increased from 13.3% of GDP to almost 15% of GDP. \n \n6.  Nevertheless, the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s economy continues to face economic risks arising \nfrom the limited diversification of the economy, political uncertainties, and governance problems. \nGiven these risks, a sound fiscal stance will provide an anchor for the economy. \n ", "2     \n \n7.  Fiscal management, in turn, faces challenges. On one hand, fiscal deficits need to be kept \nlow to maintain macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. For instance, despite the debt \nrelief granted by the Paris Club in 2005, debt indicators remain high. Thus, without HIPC relief, the \nratio of the present value of debt to Government revenue will exceed 200% through 2009, while \nthat of the present value of debt to exports will be almost 100% through 2009. On the other hand, \nproductive economic and social expenditures need to increase to help raise per capita GDP \nabove its current low level of $540, and to support the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s efforts to meet its \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).  \n \n8.  Reconciling  these  fiscal  challenges  will  require  a  buoyant  tax  base  and  steady \nimprovements in tax collection. Yet, while state tax collection has increased, it remains low \ncompared with other countries in the former Soviet Union and, by some estimates, significantly \nbelow potential. For instance, a 2002 study by the European Union\u2019s Technical Assistance for \nthe Commonwealth of Independent States (TACIS) project estimated that the gap between \npotential and actual tax receipts from the value-added tax (VAT), personal income tax, profits \ntax, and excise taxes was about 19.5% of GDP. On the micro level, the weaknesses of the \nKyrgyz Republic tax administration create opportunities for corruption and barriers to private \nsector development (as demonstrated by highly negative perceptions in business surveys) in \nthe form of inefficiencies and compliance costs. Tax policy (e.g., raising land tax rates and fully \nimposing the property tax) could increase tax collection. However, the consensus is that tax \nrates, especially on labor income, are already too high and have contributed to the growth of the \nshadow economy and tax evasion. Accordingly, tax rates on personal income and on profits \nhave been cut from 20% to 10% to foster job creation and the legalization of the informal \neconomy. These tax cuts, however, will require improvements in tax administration to offset the \npotential revenue losses. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n9.  Efficient tax administration is based on the following principles: \n \n(i)  Because no tax administration has sufficient resources to monitor all taxpayers, \ntax authorities need to (a) foster voluntary compliance (i.e., compliance involving \nlimited intervention by tax officials); and (b) establish strong large taxpayers units \n(LTU),  because  focusing  on  large  taxpayers  usually  yields  the  highest  net \nbenefits.  With  voluntary  compliance,  taxpayers  practice  self-assessment, \nwhereby they calculate their liabilities and file their returns. Officials intervene by \nproviding  information  and  services.  Self-assessment,  apart  primarily  from \neconomizing on scarce resources, helps minimize opportunities for corruption by \nreducing contact between taxpayers and tax personnel. \n \n(ii)  However,  since  delinquent  taxpayers  are  inevitable,  effective  audits  must \ncomplement voluntary compliance to enable prompt detection. Given the tax \nauthorities\u2019  limited  resources,  such  audits  should  be  carefully  targeted  and \nguided  by  risk  assessment  and  statistical  profiling.  Penalties  should  be \nappropriate and transparent. \n \n(iii)  To  effectively  implement  these  principles,  modern  tax  administrations  adopt \nstrategic  plans  to  guide  operations.  Strategic  plans  will  involve  (a) business \nprocess  reengineering\u2014a  comprehensive  review  of  how  to  streamline \noperations,  including  determining  which  processes  to  automate;  and \n(b) functional  organization\u2014to  promote  efficient  use  of  resources  through \n ", "  3\nspecialization and eliminating duplication. Based on the strategy, functional units \nthen formulate key performance indicators to translate the overall goals into their \nspecific tasks and objectives. \n \n(iv)  Information and communication technology (ICT) upgrading, in close conjunction \nwith  institutional  reforms  and  business  process  reengineering,  can  greatly \nfacilitate  these  reforms.  For  instance,  electronic  filing  promotes  voluntary \ncompliance and helps reduce contact, while a central database and effective \ninformation exchange facilitate audits and prompt detection of delinquency, and \nprovide trip wires to deter corrupt practices. \n \n10.  Judged against this framework, the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s tax administration faces significant \nchallenges. An important and highly visible constraint faced by the State Committee for Taxes \nand  Collections  (SCTC,  formerly  the  State  Tax  Inspectorate)  is  its  inadequate  physical \ninfrastructure, particularly its lack of ICT. This deficiency hampers SCTC in practically all the \nmajor tax functions: registration, filing, payments, processing, audits, and arrears management \n(Appendix 1). \n \n(i)  The  main  operating  software,  Kyrgyzstan  Integrated  Tax  Information  System \n(KITIS), is only about 40% functional and is operated in only four locations. Of \nthe 64 subnational tax offices, only 16 are equipped with computers, and the \nminimal computer capacity that exists is not used optimally due to inadequate \nstaff training in ICT skills. Consequently, most operations are manual and paper-\nbased,  and  require  multiple  encoding  of  data.  This  environment  makes \noperations prone to inefficiency, errors, data security breaches, and corruption. \n \n(ii)  Only  LTU  and  two  tax  offices  are  electronically  connected  to  SCTC \nheadquarters,  and  the  connection  capacities  are  insufficient.  Of  LTU\u2019s  235 \nclients, only 165 (mainly large businesses in Bishkek) use LTU\u2019s full range of \nservices. For the others, including those outside Bishkek, services are restricted \nto audits due to infrastructure limitations, such as lack of reliable mail service, \nelectronic return filing, and network automation support. \n \n(iii)  Information exchange between SCTC and other relevant agencies (so-called \nthird party information), which is essential for prompt detection of delinquent \ntaxpayers and the conduct of audits, suffers from delays and inaccuracies. This \nis the result of inadequate ICT, as well as the lack of interagency coordination. \nFor instance, because exports are VAT-exempt but liable to profit taxes, SCTC \nshould access export data to verify exporters\u2019 profits. However, SCTC accesses \nonly import data and limits their use to the processing of VAT returns. \n \n(iv)  The  physical  facilities  of  tax  offices  are  generally  inadequate  in  terms  of \noperational efficiency and taxpayer services. For instance, LTU and the Bishkek \ntax office occupy temporary premises at the State Customs Committee (SCC), \nwhich are hard for taxpayers to access. In addition, their physical layouts are \ninconsistent with smooth workflows. \n \n11.  The SCTC also suffers from inefficient procedures and inadequate staff skills in the \nfollowing areas: \n \n   ", "4     \n \n(i)  Taxpayer registration. Measures to make it easier for taxpayers to register and \nfor SCTC to update its records could include establishment of one-stop shops for \nregistrants  and  simplification  of  forms  and  procedures,  as  well  as \ncomputerization to facilitate recordkeeping. \n \n(ii)  Taxpayer education and services. Information provision is limited to one-time \ndissemination  of  amendments  to  the  Tax  Code  or  newly  issued  rules  and \nregulations. No arrangements are in place to collaborate with the private sector \nto  provide  information  on  a  continuous  basis,  which  is  vital  to  improve \ncompliance. \n \n(iii)  Filing. While best practice is to make filing as convenient as possible, taxpayers \nhave to file returns at tax offices before proceeding to banks to make their \npayments. These two steps should be combined, and electronic filing should be \nimplemented, initially for large taxpayers. \n \n(iv)  Payments. The transfer of payments information from the banks and the State \nSettlement and Savings Company (SSSC), which handles about 70% of tax \npayments,  to  the  Treasury  and  on  to  SCTC  also  needs  to  be  overhauled. \nCurrently, payment data are manually encoded, summary forms are physically \ndelivered, and data reconciliation generally is done manually and on paper. \n \n(v)  Processing of returns. The numerical review of returns by SCTC staff during \nfiling is contrary to the goal of self-assessment and a duplication of efforts. \nProcessing should be purely mechanical to use resources efficiently and reduce \ncontact between taxpayers and SCTC staff. Reviews should be carried out at the \naudit stage. \n \n(vi)  Audits and arrears management. Detection of arrears is often tardy due to \ninadequate ICT. Meanwhile, the law requires each taxpayer to be audited once a \nyear,  which  is  inefficient.  SCTC  should  use  risk-assessment  techniques  and \nthird-party information to undertake targeted audits. While ICT can facilitate these \ntwo procedures, SCTC staff also need training in audit procedures. \n \n12.  For all its shortcomings, the Kyrgyz Republic tax administration has a good foundation \nfor reform and modernization, as demonstrated by the following: \n \n(i)  At the highest levels of the Government and SCTC, support for reform and \nmodernization  is  strong.  In  January  2006,  a  presidential  decree  on  tax \nadministration modernization was issued. In March 2006, the SCTC prepared (in \nclose cooperation with IMF) an action plan to streamline its operations, retrench \nredundant personnel, and introduce a merit-based pay system. In October 2006, \nthe Government, as part of the PRGF program, committed to eliminate local \ngovernment interference in the appointment of senior management staff of tax \noffices.  In  January 2007,  the  SCTC\u2019s  status  was  upgraded  from  that  of  an \nagency  to  a  ministry  equivalent.  Also  in  January,  the  Government  issued  a \nresolution  adopting  a  tax  administration  reform  strategy  consistent  with  the \nMarch 2006 action plan. \n \n(ii)  The Tax Code, drafted with substantial technical advice from IMF and the United \nKingdom\u2019s  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID),  has  been \n ", "  5\nsubmitted to Parliament and is expected to be approved in 2007 (a structural \nbenchmark under the PRGF program). The code (a) simplifies and clarifies tax \nlaws1 and  procedures,  (b)  helps  improve  tax  administration,  (c)  encourages \ncompliance,  (d)  reduces  excessive  interference  by  tax  authorities  in  private \nbusiness, and (e) curbs evasion and fraud. Several features of the code were \nexpressly formulated to support tax administration reform. The code strengthens \ntaxpayer protection mechanisms and increases the period between audits. It also \nprovides the legal basis for electronic tax transactions (e.g., it allows accounting \nrecords  and  tax  reports  to  be  prepared  and filed  electronically,  using  digital \nsignature  technology),  and  for  the  first  time  explicitly  allows  Government \nagencies  to  exchange  information  to  facilitate  tax  enforcement.  Accordingly, \nSCTC  has  agreed  to  data  exchange  arrangements  with  a  critical  mass  of \nrelevant agencies, including the SCC, the Treasury, and the Social Fund. Finally, \nthe code provides the legal basis for using probability-based methods in selecting \ntaxpayers for audit, which is a prerequisite for the adoption of risk-management \ntechniques.  \n \n(iii)  A functional organization and an LTU are in place, and SCTC has established an \ninternal audit function and a division to combat misconduct and corruption. LTU \nclients operate on a self-assessment principle, and collections now total 60% of \nSCTC collections\u2014up from 40% in 2005. \n \n(iv)  Although  KITIS,  the  existing  software,  needs  to  be  upgraded,  it  provides  a \nsuitable  platform  for  the  creation  of  a  central  database  and  management \ninformation system (MIS), as well as the extension of the database and system to \nthe tax offices. In this connection, the ongoing modernization of the SCC (with \nADB  assistance),  the  Treasury,  and  the  central  bank  (with  World  Bank \nassistance) provides a good opportunity to establish effective data exchange \namong these Government institutions. The World Bank project has links to the \nproposed ADB Project, because banks course tax payment information to the \nTreasury, which then transfers the information to SCTC. \n \n13.  Tax administration reform and modernization can be favorably combined in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic. Such an endeavor should be comprehensive and address three areas: (i) physical \nmodernization, including the installation of ICT and the upgrading of facilities; (ii) institutional \nstrengthening, including capacity building for best practices in tax administration, to enable \nSCTC to improve its procedures and skills independent of ICT adoption; and (iii) business \nprocess reengineering and change management, involving adapting SCTC\u2019s operations and \nskills to ensure optimal adoption of ICT. \n \nC.  Government Strategy and Policy Dialogue \n14.  Reforming tax policy and tax administration is an essential part of the Government\u2019s \nCountry Development Strategy for 2007\u20132010. In tax policy, the Tax Code, as noted in para. 12, \nis the key measure. In tax administration, the Government intends to reduce the scope for \nabusive  discretion  of  tax  officials,  simplify  procedures,  and  toughen  enforcement  against \ndelinquent taxpayers. Accordingly, the Government will optimize the organizational structure of \n                                                 \n1  The code, therefore, will help improve the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s rankings in the tax systems section of the World \nBank\u2019s Doing Business surveys. Of the 166 countries surveyed, the Kyrgyz Republic has the sixth highest number \nof taxes that businesses have to pay. \n   ", "6     \n \ntax  administration,  introduce  modern  technology,  reduce  contact  between  taxpayers  and \nofficials, and further strengthen the LTU. The Government has consistently indicated that the \nproposed Project would provide important support for these efforts. \n \n15.  The proposed Project would also be in line with the Government\u2019s broader efforts to \nimprove  governance  and  reduce  corruption.  In  the  Country  Development  Strategy,  the \nGovernment highlights the negative effects of corruption, especially in the public agencies, on \neconomic growth and social welfare. To address this problem, the Government intends to (i) \nfoster the active participation of the citizenry in monitoring the performance of Government \nagencies; (ii) strengthen the accountability and reporting requirements of the agencies; and (iii) \ninitiate the establishment of electronic government (e-government) to reduce direct contact and \nopportunities for corrupt relations between civil servants and citizens, as well as improve service \ndelivery in general. \n \nD.  Lessons \n16.  The design of the proposed Project and TAs incorporates important lessons derived \nfrom  decades  of  international  experience  in  tax  administration  reform  and  modernization, \nparticularly involving tax agencies that have adopted ICT systems. The following lessons are \ndrawn  from  relevant  regional  experience  (Russian  Federation,  Ukraine,  and  Bulgaria)  with \nprojects supported by World Bank and other development partners: \n \n(i)  Successful  tax  administration  reform  and  modernization  require  more  than \ncomputerization  and  physical  upgrading;  it  also  entails  complex  institutional \nchange, affecting organization and human resource development. \n \n(ii)  The  optimal  approach  is  to  move  staff\u2019s  work  away  from  routine  and  low-\nproductivity tasks toward more specialized, higher value-added tasks. Training \nmust be provided early in the process to engender ownership, facilitate change, \nand ensure that attention is not biased toward physical investment. \n \n(iii)  Sequencing and scaling up should be carefully executed. Piloting of modernization, \nrather than full-scale implementation, will enable early identification and correction \nof problems. Because  of their importance and compact size, LTUs provide a \nnatural venue for piloting automation and other restructuring. \n \n(iv)  Improvement should be monitored using a holistic set of indicators, rather than \njust revenue targets. Indicators should be developed to measure quality and \nproductivity, service orientation, and sustainability. \n \n(v)  Fostering a culture of compliance among taxpayers is important. This will require \nestablishing an effective taxpayer education and taxpayer service program. While \nautomation might lead to reduced staffing for low-value tasks, more personnel \nmight be needed for the taxpayer outreach functions. The SCTC\u2019s March 2006 \naction  plan  calls  for  the  creation  of  partnerships  with  the  private  sector  for \nimproved  information  dissemination  (including  the  forthcoming  Tax  Code), \ndevelopment of simplified tax forms to ease taxpayers\u2019 compliance burden, and \ncontinuous and systematic assessments of the information and training needs of \ntaxpayers and tax administration personnel. \n \n ", "  7\n(vi)  According to the World Bank and IMF's HIPC Preliminary Document, an essential \nstep in fostering a business-friendly regulatory environment will be the adoption \nand implementation the new Tax Code, along with moving tax administration \ntoward risk-based assessment and away from excessively intrusive inspections. \n \n(vii)  Because  benefits  accrue  over  the  medium  to  long  term,  perseverance  and \ninstitutionalization  of  the  new  operating  framework  will  be  essential.  The  tax \nadministration should see clear and direct benefits to ensure sustained ownership.  \n \nE.  External Assistance and Aid Coordination \n17.  Bilateral/multilateral  development  partners  have  provided  some  assistance  for  tax \nadministration reform and modernization, although it has mainly consisted of advice. IMF has \nbeen providing advice on tax policy and tax administration: (i) on VAT administration and LTU in \n2002, (ii) on LTU and broadening the VAT base in 2003, (iii) on tax administration procedures \nand legislation in 2004, (iv) on drafting the new Tax Code in 2005\u20132006, and (v) on overhauling \nselected operations in 2006. During January\u2013July 2006, IMF fielded a regional advisor on tax \nadministration in Bishkek. Similarly, DFID has given advice on procedures for tax audits and tax \nappeals, developing revenue forecasting capability, and the draft Tax Code. The United States \nAgency for International Development (USAID), in addition to helping establish the software \nKITIS in the head office, has assisted in the computerization of LTU. In cooperation with DFID, \nUSAID has financed the ongoing upgrading of KITIS and expansion of its coverage to all SCTC \noffices in Bishkek. Finally, World Bank has an ongoing project to modernize the Treasury, \nchiefly by computerizing expenditure management. Appendix 2 provides a summary of these \nactivities. \n \n18.  In 2004, ADB provided a loan and TA for customs modernization.2 At that time, SCTC \nwas still unified with SCC under the Committee for Revenue under the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF).  As  envisaged,  the  Project  for  tax  administration  reform  and  modernization  would \nleverage the customs project. In addition, since 1991, ADB has been conducting an annual tax \nconference for developing member countries, and the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s fiscal authorities have \nbeen active participants. \n \n19.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  other  development  partners  strongly  support  the  proposed \nProject. IMF, in particular, recommended to the Government in its January 2006 TA that SCTC \nprovide full support for the ADB modernization project. ADB, DFID and USAID have worked \nclosely to ensure consistency between the KITIS upgrading project and the proposed ADB \nProject in terms of timetable and equipment requirements.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n20.  The proposed Project will help increase the effectiveness of tax administration to ensure \nsustained fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stability. The outcome of the Project is a \nmodern and efficient SCTC that achieves improvements in tax collection. The design and \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n   ", "8     \n \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 3. The accompanying TAs will necessarily have the same \nimpact and outcome, to which attainment they will contribute with complementary outputs. \n \nB.  Outputs \n21.  To ensure achievement of the outcome, the proposed Project and two accompanying \nTAs are designed to result in technical, operational, and institutional improvements. The design \nis based on (i) the studies during the project preparatory TA; (ii) the findings of ADB missions; \nand  (iii)  extensive  discussions  with  Government  agencies,  stakeholders,  and  beneficiaries. \nWhile the TAs will focus on institutional strengthening, capacity building, business process \nreengineering,  and  change  management,  the  proposed  Project  will  focus  on  the  physical \nmodernization of SCTC. The Project has the following outputs: \n \n1.  Central Database and Management Information System \n \n22.  This output involves the acquisition of ICT hardware and software to establish a central \ndatabase and an MIS at SCTC headquarters. Building on and completing the USAID-DFID small-\nscale project to repair and upgrade KITIS, the ADB Project will enable KITIS to be migrated from a \nlocal area network (LAN) to a wide area network (WAN), which is a prerequisite for establishing \ncomputer links to tax offices. This output will also entail the procurement of data warehousing and \nbusiness analytics systems, development of the capability for electronic filing (to be piloted with \nlarge taxpayers), and establishment of emergency data recovery systems. To ensure appropriate \nsequencing and scaling-up, this output will focus on LTU and the Bishkek tax office, given their \nproximity to SCTC headquarters and their large share of collection. \n \n2.  Communication Infrastructure for Tax Offices \n \n23.  This output involves the development of the ICT infrastructure to support nationwide roll-\nout of KITIS to tax offices. Tax offices will undergo site preparation to enable them to adequately \nhouse  ICT,  maintain  continuous  links  with  the  central  database,  and  operate  under  an \napplication virtualization and WAN environment. This output will also involve the development of \nelectronic interfaces with SCC, Treasury, SSSC, Financial Police, and Social Fund. While the \ntarget is to eventually connect 100% of tax offices, this will be done gradually, in order to ensure \na smooth transition. \n \n3.  Modern Central Operations \n \n24.  This output involves the establishment of a Special Services Building (SSB) to house the \ncentral database and the MIS, LTU, the Bishkek tax office, the taxpayer service center, and the \nSCTC staff development center. Installation of these functions in the SSB will ensure effective \ncoordination (in particular, LTU\u2019s pilot e-filing program will require close access to the central \ndatabase) and efficient workflows. \n \nC.  Special Features \n25.  The proposed Project has features that draw on lessons learned regarding successful \ntax administration reform and modernization, as well as the SCTC\u2019s specific circumstances: \n \n(i)  The proposed Project addresses the problem that the World Bank highlighted in \nits analysis of the Kyrgyz Republic in its 2006 report on anticorruption progress in \ntransition  economies:  that  anticorruption  efforts  have  focused  on  legislative \n ", "  9\nchanges with inadequate attention paid to implementation and enforcement.3 The \nproposed Project will enable the Government to adopt a twofold approach to \nreducing corruption in tax administration\u2014while the new Tax Code introduces \nimproved legislation, the Project will help ensure its implementation. \n \n(ii)  The proposed Project adopts an innovative approach to improving governance \nand minimizing corruption in tax administration. In contrast to prosecutorial and \npunitive  approaches,  which  generally  produce  only  short-term  results,  the \nProject\u2019s design aims to create built-in controls to minimize opportunities for \ncorruption. Automation in general will help reduce contact between taxpayers \nand  SCTC.  Meanwhile,  the  central  database  and  data  exchange  between \nrelevant agencies will enhance monitoring and verification of data, as well as \ndata accuracy and accessibility. \n \n(iii)  The  proposed  Project  takes  a  comprehensive  approach  to  improving  tax \nadministration,  incorporating  revenue  targets  as  well  as  quality  and  service \nindicators.  Furthermore,  the  accompanying  TAs  will  help  SCTC  establish  a \npermanent system for setting goals and managing performance to institutionalize \na performance orientation among SCTC staff. \n \n(iv)  Institutional  strengthening,  human  resource  development,  and  change \nmanagement are key components of the proposed Project and accompanying \nTAs.  These  efforts  will  ensure  that  SCTC  does  not  rely  unduly  on  physical \nmodernization  to  improve  its  performance,  but  also  undertakes  essential \ncomplementary measures. \n \n(v)  The proposed Project pays close attention to sequencing and scaling up. Efforts \ninitially will focus on LTU and the Bishkek tax office as these provide the best \nvenues  for  establishing  automation.  Similarly,  e-filing  and  payments  will  be \npiloted in LTU. \n \n(vi)  The proposed Project pays close attention to private sector participation and \ndevelopment. Private sector stakeholders will be included on the project steering \ncommittee (PSC). Key activities and performance indicators include those that \nwill spur SCTC staff to improve service to taxpayers, such as the establishment \nof  taxpayer  education  and  services,  which  SCTC  envisages  under  its \nMarch 2006 reform action plan. Finally, consistent with the World Bank and IMF \nHIPC recommendations, the Project will reduce compliance costs (including the \ncosts  of  corruption)  through  the  adoption  of  risk-based  assessment  and  the \nreduction of intrusive inspections, thereby improving the business environment. \n \n(vii)  The impetus for reform and modernization in the Kyrgyz Republic is coming from \nthe highest levels of Government and motivated SCTC staff. As the benefits of \nreform  and  modernization  materialize  and  the  reforms  become  entrenched, \nadditional agents and advocates for change arise, including the private sector \n(which benefits from reduced compliance costs) and SCTC staff (as the new \noperations and professionalism set in). \n \n                                                 \n3  Anderson, James H. and Cheryl W. Gray. 2006. Anticorruption in Transition 3: Who Is Succeeding...and Why? \nWashington DC: World Bank. \n   ", "10    \n \n(viii)  By helping install ICT in the tax administration and facilitating connectivity among \nrelevant  agencies,  the  proposed  Project  complements  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s \nefforts to establish e-government as a means of improving public administration. \n \n(ix)  The design of the proposed Project has been developed in close cooperation \nwith other development partners. The start of the Project is envisaged to mesh \nwith the completion of the USAID-DFID project for upgrading KITIS. In addition, \nthe accompanying TAs are intended to help SCTC implement the procedural \nrecommendations that IMF has provided. Finally, discussions with technical staff \nof the World Bank\u2019s Treasury and central bank modernization project, as well as \nthe project management office (PMO) of the ADB Customs Modernization and \nInfrastructure  Development  Project,  have  generated  assurances  that  data \nexchange among SCTC, SCC, Treasury, and central bank will be feasible. \n \n(x)  The  proposed  Project  complements  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  assistance  for  customs \nmodernization. Both Projects will help increase the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s revenue \ncollection capacity and fiscal space, improve governance and transparency, and \nspur economic activity. \n \nD.  Project Investment and Financing Plan \n26.  The Government has asked ADB to provide an Asian Development Fund (ADF) IX grant \nof $10 million to help finance the Project (Table 1 and Appendix 4). The Project is estimated to \ncost the equivalent of $12.5 million (Table 2 and Appendix 4). The grant will finance 80% of the \nproject  cost.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remainder,  equivalent  to  $2.5 million,  as \ncounterpart financing, primarily for taxes and duties, civil works, office accommodations and \nfacilities, logistical support, and physical and price contingencies. \n \nTable 1: Project Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total Cost  Percent \nAsian Development Bank Grant  10.00  80 \nGovernment  2.50  20 \n  Total  12.50  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  11\nTable 2: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nProject Component  Total Cost \nA.

Project Management \n \n27.  Executing and Implementing Agencies. The Office of the Government (OG) will be \nthe Executing Agency, and SCTC will be the Implementing Agency. As Executing Agency, OG \nwill have overall responsibility for the execution and coordination of project activities, including \nsupervising the PMO, and endorsing disbursement applications under the proposed grant. \n \n28.  Project Steering Committee. Within 3 months after grant effectiveness, the Government \nwill establish a PSC to oversee the Project and coordinate issues related to its implementation. \nThe PSC will also review annual work plans, progress reports, and midterm evaluations. A \nrepresentative of OG will be the director of the PSC. The chairman of SCTC will be deputy \ndirector of the PSC. A deputy chairman of SCTC will be project director, with overall responsibility \nfor day-to-day management. The PSC will also include representatives from other Government \nagencies and private stakeholders, including MOF, Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, \nMinistry  of  Transport  and  Communication,  SCC,  Treasury,  SSSC,  telecoms  providers,  and \nbusiness and tax service professionals. The PSC will provide overall policy guidance, facilitate \ninteragency coordination, serve as a mechanism for private sector participation, and resolve any \ninstitutional problems affecting project implementation. PSC will meet twice a year, or more if \nneeded. ADB will attend PSC meetings as an observer. \n \n   ", "12    \n \n29.  Project Management Office. Before any disbursement is made under the grant, a PMO \nwill be established to carry out day-to-day implementation and serve as the secretariat of the \nPSC. A qualified general manager and a qualified financial manager, who will be recruited on a \ncompetitive basis with selection arrangements acceptable to ADB, will head the PMO. Qualified \ntechnical  and  administrative  specialists,  who  might  include  a  finance  officer/accountant, \nprocurement specialist, ICT and training specialists, office manager, and interpreter, will assist \nthe general manager and financial manager. These staff will be recruited on a competitive basis \nwith  selection  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  PMO  will  remain  adequately  staffed \nthroughout  implementation,  and  will  be  assisted  by  international  and  national  consultants \nfinanced  under  the  grant  and  the  accompanying  TAs.  The  PMO  will  have  the  following \nresponsibilities:  (i) planning  and  scheduling  of  activities;  (ii) administration  of  procurement \nactivities and selection of consultants; (iii) bookkeeping and maintenance of project accounts, \nand preparation and consolidation of liquidation reports; (iv) supervision and monitoring of the \nwork program and project performance; (v) coordination of field activities; (vi) engagement of \nconsultants  or  firms  to  conduct  audits  of  the  project  accounts  and  financial  statements; \n(vii) liaison with ADB, Government agencies concerned, and private sector stakeholders; and \n(viii) preparation of quarterly and annual project monitoring and progress reports. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n30.  The Project will be implemented over 4 years and 8 months, from August 2007 to March \n2012 (Appendix 5). \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n31.  The PMO will be responsible for procurement of all equipment, services, and civil works. \nAll civil works, services, supplies, and equipment to be financed by ADB will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nProcurement  of  goods,  equipment,  and  materials  costing  more  than  $0.50  million  will  be \nprocured through international competitive bidding. Those valued between $0.10 million and \n$0.50 million will be procured through national competitive bidding (NCB) in accordance with the \nBorrower's  procurement  procedures  subject  to  the  modifications  and  clarifications  to  such \nBorrower's procedures as set forth in the grant agreement. \n \n32.  Civil works will be required to establish the SSB and install ICT equipment in SCTC \nHeadquarters and selected rayons. Civil works contracts with an estimated value of $1.0 million \nor more will be carried out using international competitive bidding procedures, while those \nvalued at less than $1.0 million will use NCB. The award of all civil works contracts will be \nsubject to ADB approval. The project procurement plan is in Appendix 6. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n33.  The  Project  will  finance  international  and  national  consulting  services  for  project \nimplementation. The outline terms of reference for the consulting services include systems \nanalysis  and  design,  systems  development  and  integration,  systems  implementation,  and \nproject  management.  About  32  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  45 \nperson-months of national consulting services will be required. The terms of reference for the \nconsulting services are in Appendix 7. The Government has agreed to recruit consultants on an \nindividual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time), and ADB\u2019s procedures for recruiting individual consultants. \n \n ", "  13\n5.  Advance Contracting and Rectroactive Financing \n \n34.  To expedite project implementation, advance contracting and retroactive financing will \nbe undertaken to cover the engagement of a project preparation manager, who will oversee the \nestablishment of the PMO. The advance action will include the submission of the final terms of \nreference and evaluation criteria; curriculum vitae of at least five qualified candidates; and the \nevaluation report, including the ranking of the candidates, with draft contract for negotiations for \nADB\u2019s  review  and  approval.  The  retroactive  financing  for  the  engagement  of  the  project \npreparation manager will be limited to 2 months\u2019 remuneration/fee (equivalent to approximately \n$6,000). The project preparation manager will start his/her services within the month before \nexpected grant approval. \n \n35.  The SCTC was informed that (i) ADB\u2019s approval of the advance action as discussed \nabove is subject to approval of the proposed grant and does not commit ADB to finance the \nProject or the related recruitment costs for the project preparation manager, and (ii) retroactive \nfinancing covers only those eligible expenditures incurred during the 1-month period before the \nsigning date of the grant agreement. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n36.  The grant proceeds  will be disbursed in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). To expedite project implementation through \ntimely release of grant proceeds, the OG will establish separate imprest accounts for the grant \npromptly after their effectiveness. Total advances are not to exceed ADB\u2019s estimated share of \neligible project expenditures to be financed through the imprest accounts for the next 6 months, or \n10% of the grant amount, whichever is lower. The imprest accounts will be established at a bank \nacceptable to ADB, and will be managed and liquidated in accordance with detailed arrangements \nagreed on by SCTC and ADB, and consistent with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. As \neligible expenditures are incurred and paid from the imprest accounts, the Borrower will request \nliquidation/replenishment of the imprest accounts by submitting withdrawal applications and the \napplicable  summary  sheet.  Notwithstanding  the  Government\u2019s  disbursement  procedures, \nsufficient supporting documentation, as defined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, must be \nkept to substantiate all expenditures incurred from the grant proceeds. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n37.  The PMO will maintain separate accounts exclusively for the Project, including separate \naccounts for the grant. It will register in such accounts all receipts and payments for the Project. \nThe  PMO  will  include  a  finance  officer/accountant  to  ensure  that  the  Project  is  managed \naccording to sound accounting principles and procedures acceptable to ADB. The accounts and \nfinancial statements for each fiscal year, including the imprest accounts, will be audited annually \nby independent external auditors acceptable to ADB. The audit report should include a separate \naudit opinion on the proper use of the imprest accounts. SCTC will provide ADB with an audit \nreport, with audited accounts and financial statements, within 6 months after the end of each \nfiscal year. The financial statements and auditor\u2019s report will be in English. Appendix 8 provides \na summary financial management assessment. \n \n38.  The PMO will submit quarterly and annual reports to ADB, indicating progress made and \nproblems encountered during the review period, steps taken or proposed to be taken to remedy \nthe problems, proposed programs of activities, and expected progress during the following \nperiod. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, SCTC will submit to ADB a project \n   ", "14    \n \ncompletion report providing details about implementation, costs, benefits, and other information \nrequested by ADB. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n39.  SCTC will establish an appropriate project performance management system in the \nPMO within 1 year of grant effectiveness. For periodic monitoring, key indicators and baseline \nconditions will be developed through participatory surveys, and will be incorporated in the \nregular reporting system. During grant inception, SCTC and ADB will agree on a preliminary set \nof  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  project  performance.  At  the  beginning  of \nimplementation, SCTC will confirm the baseline values for these indicators. These indicators will \nbe measured during implementation. ADB\u2019s findings and comments regarding these project \nindicators will be incorporated in every project monitoring and evaluation report, which will be \nsubmitted  to  ADB  quarterly.  On  completion  of  the  Project,  its  outcome  will  be  evaluated \naccording to a schedule and terms of reference agreed upon by SCTC and ADB. \n \n9.  Project Reviews \n \n40.  OG, SCTC, and ADB will jointly review the Project at least twice during the first year of \nits implementation and at least once a year thereafter, and will monitor the overall performance \nof the PMO. These reviews will cover physical implementation; the policy, institutional, technical, \nand financial aspects of the Project; and its continuing viability. The review will also examine the \nimplementation  of  action  plans,  and  the  identification  of  problems  that  might  require  joint \nattention. After 3 years of implementation, SCTC and ADB will jointly carry out a comprehensive \nmidterm review of the Project to identify any problems and constraints, and to assess the need \nfor midterm modification of the Project\u2019s scope and implementation arrangements. Technical \nand budgetary changes to the project document requested or arising from the review will also \nbe considered, as will the inclusion of additional activities or the consideration of possible \nexpansion of activities/areas over the remaining life of the Project. \n \n10.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n41.  The proposed Project will help minimize corruption and improve governance. In addition, \nimplementation of the Project will adhere to ADB\u2019s policy on Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date). Accordingly, ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  SCTC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the OG and SCTC, as well as all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers, as they relate to the Project. \n \n42.  Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added to ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime  to  time),  particularly  the  need  for  bidders,  suppliers,  contractors,  and  consultants  to \nobserve the highest standards of ethics in the procurement and execution of contracts, and the \nsanctions imposed on those who violate these standards. OG and SCTC are committed to \ncreating a corruption-free environment and would like the Project to be implemented strictly in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines. \n ", "  15\nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n43.  The proposed Project provides for two accompanying TAs to address the key lesson that \ntax administration reform and modernization will require complex institutional change in addition \nto computerization. The TAs will ensure effective implementation of the Project by addressing \ntwo complementary areas: (i) reform measures that are independent of computerization and \nphysical upgrading, but are essential for tax administration reform; and (ii) adjustment measures \nto enable SCTC to make optimal use of its modern facilities. Accordingly, the first TA will be for \ninstitutional strengthening and capacity building to support tax administration reform, while the \nsecond TA will be for business process reengineering and change management to facilitate tax \nadministration modernization. The project preparatory TA and previous TAs from IMF, USAID, \nand  DFID  have  produced  a  substantial  body  of  background  analytical  work  and  concrete \nrecommendations  on  reforming  SCTC\u2019s  operations.  Thus,  the  two  new  TAs  can  use  this \nbackground work and focus on assisting SCTC in implementing these recommendations. The \naccompanying TAs are described in paras. 45\u201348. As the problem-tree analysis in Appendix 1 \nindicates, the TAs will produce outputs to complement those of the Project. As such, the TAs\u2019 \ndesign and monitoring frameworks (in Appendixes 9 and 10) will necessarily have the same \nimpact and outcome. \n \n44.  For both TAs, SCTC will be the Executing Agency and Implementing Agency. Each TA \nwill  be  completed  by  about  December 2009.  This  time  frame  is  consistent  with  similar \nrestructuring efforts in comparable economies (Russian Federation, Bulgaria, and Ukraine), as \nwell  as  with  the  latest  IMF  TA  mission\u2019s  proposed  time  frame.  The  international  tax \nadministration  reform  specialist  for  the  first  TA  will  be  the  team  leader  for  both  TAs.  In \nconsultation  with  SCTC,  ADB  will  select  and  engage  individual  international  and  national \nconsultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. SCTC will procure \nequipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and will keep the equipment on \ncompletion of the TAs. \n \nA.  Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building for Tax Administration Reform \n45.  To help ensure achievement of the impact and outcome of the Project, the first TA will \nhave three outputs: (i) SCTC staff skills in modern tax administration will be upgraded, (ii) a \nmechanism for setting goals and monitoring performance will be adopted to ensure continuing \nefficiency,  and  (iii) taxpayer  education  and  services  will  be  provided  to  promote  voluntary \ncompliance. Key deliverables will include (i) periodic comprehensive reports for implementing \nthe  body  of  existing  recommendations  on  tax  administration  reform,  additional \nrecommendations  for  strengthening  SCTC\u2019s  internal  audit  programs  and  combating  official \nmisconduct, recommendations for strengthening interagency cooperation on data exchange and \nenforcement  (building  on  the  existing  interagency  memorandum  of  understanding); \n(ii) formulation of a permanent system for setting goals and managing performance; (iii) conduct \nof training programs for taxpayer education and services; and (iv) establishment of a public \nawareness  campaign  to  promote  taxpayer  compliance  and  foster  public  support  for  tax \nadministration  reform.  Many  of  these  activities  can  be  implemented  independent  of  the \ndevelopment of modern infrastructure under the Project. Nevertheless, the team leader will \nensure that the TA\u2019s activities are synchronized with the implementation of the Project. \n \n46.  The TA will require 16 person-months of international consulting services and 18 person-\nmonths of national consulting services. Outline terms of reference for the TA are in Appendix 9. \nThe TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $600,000. As proposed, ADB will provide a grant \nfor $500,000 from ABD\u2019s technical assistance funding program. The Government will finance \n   ", "16    \n \nthe  remaining  local  currency  cost,  equivalent  to  $100,000, by  providing  office  space  and \nlogistical support, workshop facilities, and counterpart staff. \n \nB.  Business Process Reengineering and Change Management for Tax Administration \nModernization \n47.  To help ensure achievement of the impact and outcome of the Project, the second TA \nwill have three outputs (i) SCTC staff skills in basic and advanced ICT methods and business \nanalytics will be developed, (ii) SCTC business processes will be reengineered to enable SCTC \nstaff to efficiently use the new equipment and facilities, and (iii) SCTC staff\u2019s adjustment to the \nnew  operational  setup  will  be  facilitated  through  a  change  management  program.  Key \ndeliverables include (i) detailed training programs that are geared toward \u201ctraining the trainors\u201d \nfor basic and advanced ICT skills, data management and business analytics, risk management \nand  statistical  profiling,  and  computer-assisted  audits;  (ii) detailed  recommendations  on \nbusiness process reengineering and restructuring of operating procedures to ensure optimal \nuse of new equipment and facilities; (iii) prototypes of simplified documents to ease taxpayer \ncompliance; and (iv) best practices guidelines and manuals on automated tax administration. \nThe  activities  under  this  TA  will  require  synchronization  with  the  installation  of  the  new \nequipment and facilities.  \n \n48.  The TA will require 16 person-months of international consulting services and 18 person-\nmonths of national consulting services. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 10. The TA is \nestimated to cost the equivalent of $600,000. ADB will administer a grant of $500,000 provided \nby the Government of the Republic of Korea. The Government will finance the remaining local \ncurrency  cost,  equivalent  to  $100,000,  by  providing  office  space  and  logistical  support, \nworkshop facilities, and counterpart staff. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n49.  The Project\u2019s main benefit is higher tax revenues, which will help the Kyrgyz Republic \nsustain macroeconomic stability and economic growth, with the potential to expand the tax base \nand tax collections further. By their nature, therefore, these direct and indirect benefits are \nexpected  to  accrue  to  the  general  society  and  economy,  rather  than  to  easily  identifiable \nsectors. Nevertheless, at least two identifiable sectors can be expected to benefit from tax \nadministration  reform  and  modernization.  First,  taxpayers  (individuals  and  businesses)  will \nbenefit from (i) more efficient SCTC procedures, which will reduce their compliance costs and \nfacilitate their business operations; and (ii) improved governance, which will reduce the costs of \ncorruption. Second, to the extent that the increased tax revenues are channeled to social and \neconomic expenditures that directly benefit the poorer segments of society, tax administration \nreform and modernization will lead to further increases in overall social welfare. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis \n50.  The financial analysis of the Project was carried out by comparing the \u201cwith project\u201d and \n\u201cwithout project\u201d scenarios. The summary financial analysis is in Appendix 11. The primary \nquantifiable financial benefit from the Project is higher tax revenues. With the Project, tax \ncollections are estimated to increase by 0.1% of GDP in 2012, rising progressively to 0.5% of \nGDP by 2015 and staying constant thereafter. On these bases, the financial internal rate of \nreturn (FIRR) of the Project is estimated to be about 34%. \n ", "  17\n51.  Sensitivity analyses indicate that lowering the projected increases in tax collection to \n0.2% of GDP by 2013 and holding it constant thereafter would reduce the FIRR to 17%. \nDoubling maintenance costs would reduce the FIRR to 29%. These FIRRs, however, would still \nbe comfortably above the threshold of 12%. A combination of the two adverse scenarios would \nreduce the FIRR to 13%, still above the threshold. \n \n52.  The FIRRs calculated for the Project are likely to be conservative. Revenue increases \ncould be even higher due to spillovers and hard-to-quantify effects. For instance, by enhancing \nmacroeconomic stability, improved tax collection contributes to faster economic growth. This,  in \nturn, would expand the tax base further. Improved governance and minimized corruption in tax \nadministration would also help to accelerate growth. These two mechanisms would increase tax \nrevenues, although the magnitude would be difficult to quantify. Similarly, to the extent that the \nincreases  in  tax  collections  are  channeled  to  expenditures  that  benefit  the  poorer \nsocioeconomic segments of the Kyrgyz Republic, social welfare benefits would result\u2014again \ndifficult to quantify. \n \n53.  The  proposed  Project  is  financially  sustainable.  The  Government  and  SCTC  are \ncommitted to providing sufficient financing for the operations and maintenance of the equipment \nand  other  facilities.  The  significant  financial  benefits  from  the  Project  also  help  ensure \nsustainability. \n \nC.  Social and Poverty Impact \n54.  The proposed Project will contribute directly and indirectly to the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s \nefforts  to  achieve  sustained  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Directly,  the  increases  in  tax \nrevenues will help foster continued macroeconomic stability, which is an essential condition for \neconomic  growth,  as  well  as  provide  the  fiscal  space  for  priority  social  and  economic \nexpenditure that will enable the Kyrgyz Republic to achieve its MDGs. Indirectly, the improved \ngovernance brought about by minimized corruption and reduced compliance costs, increased \nconsistency and fairness of treatment for taxpayers, and greater transparency and integrity can \nalso be expected to support growth, job creation, and poverty reduction. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \nD.  Environmental Impact \n55.  The proposed Project has been classified as environmental category C based on site \nvisits  and  assessment  under  the  project  preparatory  TA.  The  SSB  will  be  constructed  on \nsuitable existing vacant real estate owned by SCTC. Thus, no land acquisition or resettlement will \nbe required for the construction of the SSB. Site visits were made to the regional tax offices to \nexamine the civil works requirements for the installation of ICT equipment. All construction, \nrehabilitation, and installation activities will be carried out within the premises of existing SCTC \nproperties, including the site of the SSB. During construction work, some minor noise and dust \npollution will occur. The civil works contracts will include mitigating measures to minimize such \npollution.  Therefore,  the  Project\u2019s  environmental  impact  is  minimal  and  can  be  kept  at \nacceptable levels. \n \nE.  Project Risks \n56.  The  proposed  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks.  Risks  during \nimplementation arise mainly from (i) potential delays due to SCTC\u2019s lack of experience with \nADB requirements, (ii) potential difficulties in coordinating SCTC\u2019s central database with the \n   ", "18    \n \ninfrastructure of other agencies, and (iii) potential difficulties of SCTC staff in adjusting to the \nnew procedures and facilities. These risks are mitigated by steps taken during the project \npreparatory TA, ongoing measures adopted by OG and SCTC, the design of the Project and \nTAs, and Government assurances. Specific steps to address these risks include the following: \n(i) key  SCTC  staff  received  intensive  orientations  in  ADB  procedures  during  the  project \npreparatory TA; (ii) internationally experienced consultants will provide support and training to \nPMO and SCTC during implementation to ensure the equipment and works comply with the \ndesign requirements and quality standards; (iii) SCTC has reached an agreement with relevant \nagencies  for  effective  data  exchange;  and  (iv) institutional  strengthening  and  change \nmanagement have been incorporated as essential components of the overall Project to facilitate \nthe adjustment of SCTC staff to the new framework. \n \n57.  Risks  could  also  include  inadequate  funding  for  operations  and  maintenance,  and \ndifficulties in recruiting and retaining competent ICT personnel. The former is mitigated by \nassurances from OG and MOF that adequate counterpart funds will be provided during and \nafter  implementation  to  ensure  sustainability.  SCTC\u2019s  plan,  under  its  reform  strategy,  to \nintroduce a merit-based pay system mitigates the latter. Significant potential increases in tax \ncollection with the successful implementation of the Project also mitigate both risks. These \nrevenues would enable SCTC to continually upgrade its operations and staffing. \n \n58.  Broader risks arise on the political front. Political shocks could disrupt the continuity of \npolicy makers, while political pressures\u2014including from vested interests opposed to efficient tax \nadministration\u2014could hinder the Project\u2019s reform and modernization goals. These risks are \nmitigated by the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s continuing commitment to pursuing macroeconomic stability \nand  structural  reforms  under  the  PRGF  program,  as  well  as  development  partners\u2019  close \nattention to the policy environment. OG\u2019s assumption of the role of Executing Agency is a strong \nindication of the Government\u2019s support for the Project. Passage of the new Tax Code will also \nhelp establish a favorable environment for tax administration. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n59.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic has \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that SCTC establishes a PSC within 3 months after \ngrant effectiveness. \n \n(ii)  The  Government  will  allocate  in  a  timely  manner  adequate  funding  for  the \ncounterpart funding of the Project, and will provide ADB with information on such \nallocations  annually.    More  specifically,  the  Government  will  make  adequate \nbudget allocations based on SCTC operational plan for (a) the operation and \nmaintenance of the rehabilitated tax offices and the SSB; and (b) the operation \nand  maintenance  costs  of  ICT  equipment,  including  consumables,  servicing, \nconnectivity, maintenance, electricity, software licenses, and the costs of their \nreplacement. \n \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that SCTC conducts an independent audit on the \nProject\u2019s account and financial statement within 6 months after the close of each \nfiscal year. \n ", "  19\n(iv)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  SCTC  establishes  a  project  performance \nmanagement system, with the assistance of consultants to be engaged under the \nProject, within 1 year from grant effectiveness. \n \n(v)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  Kyrgyz  Telecoms  provides  adequate  and \nsufficient digital subscriber lines to connect the SCTC tax offices to the central \ndatabase. \n \nB.  Condition for Grant Disbursement \n60.  The Government agreed to the following condition for withdrawal of grant proceeds, \nwhich is incorporated in the draft Grant Agreement: establishment of the PMO staffed with a \ngeneral manager and a financial manager with experience and qualification satisfactory to ADB. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n61.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not \nexceeding the equivalent of $10,000,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources, for the Tax Administration Reform and Modernization Project, with such terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Grant Agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n23 May 2007 \n \n   ", "20   Appendix 1 \n \nSUMMARY SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Economic Development and Macro Fiscal Situation \n \n1.  During 2000\u20132006, economic growth in the Kyrgyz Republic averaged about 4%, while \ninflation was modest at 4.4%. Exports have risen strongly since the late 1990s. Due mainly to \nthe development of the Kumtor gold mine and export, exports grew annually by about 10.5% \nduring 2000\u20132005. However, because import growth has been faster at 16.5%, the country has \nincurred persistent trade and current account deficits. Foreign direct investment and unrequited \nflows (chiefly remittances) have financed these deficits comfortably. \n \n2.  Output contracted slightly in 2005 due to following political and economic shocks: (i) a \ntemporary drop in gold production, which accounts for about 30% of exports; (ii) shortfalls in \nfarm output due to bad weather; and (iii) a slowdown in manufacturing due to the uncertain \nbusiness climate. Since 2005, economic activity has returned to normal, with growth rebounding \nduring the first semester of 2006.  However, inflation, while remaining low in 2005 (at 4.9%), has \nalso started to edge up due to supply and demand factors. Apart from the shortfall in agricultural \noutput and a surge in fuel prices, higher inflation has been driven by an expansion in reserve \nmoney  related  to  (unsterilized)  central  bank  intervention  to  stem  the  Kyrgyz  currency\u2019s \nappreciation, and strong inflows of private capital and remittances. \n \nTable A1: State Government Finances \n(% of GDP) \nItem  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007 \n(Estimate)  (Projection) \nTotal revenue and grants  19.1  18.7  19.5  20.4  21.4  21.3 \n  Total revenue  18.0  18.2  18.7  20.0  20.7  20.5 \n  Current revenue  17.8  18.0  18.4  19.9  20.7  20.5 \n      Tax revenue  13.3  13.7  14.3  14.6  14.6  14.9 \n      Income tax  2.9  2.8  2.8  3.5  3.2  2.9 \n      VAT  6.4  6.6  7.2  7.1  7.6  7.9 \n      Excises  1.4  1.4  1.3  1.1  1.1  1.2 \n      Others  2.6  2.9  3.0  2.9  2.7  2.9 \n    Customs  0.6  0.5  0.5  1.7  2.1  2.1 \n    Nontax revenue  3.9  3.8  3.6  3.6  3.9  3.4 \n  Capital revenue  0.2  0.2  0.2  0.0  0.0  0.0 \n  Grants  1.1  0.5  0.8  0.4  0.7  0.8 \n             \nTotal expenditure  24.8  24.5  24.2  24.6  24.4  24.4 \n  Current expenditure  18.8  19.7  19.7  20.2  20.4  20.4 \n  Capital expenditure  6.1  4.8  4.5  4.4  4.4  4.4 \n             \nNet lending  (0.6)  (0.5)  (0.5)  (0.5)  (0.4)  (0.5) \n             \nBalance  (5.1)  (5.4)  (4.2)  (4.4)  (3.4)  (3.6) \n ( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product, VAT = value added tax. \nSource: International Monetary Fund. \n \n3.  Fiscal consolidation and a generally prudent monetary policy have underpinned the \ncountry\u2019s macroeconomic accomplishments. Fiscal performance has been healthy, with tax \nreceipts rising in the past several years as a result of new revenue measures, as well as \nconcerted efforts to curb evasion and improve tax administration (Table A1). Tax collection \n(excluding customs revenues) increased from 13.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) to 14.6% \nof GDP in 2000\u20132005. The general government fiscal deficit, which exceeded 9% of GDP ", "                                                                                                                                                    Appendix 1  21   \nduring 1996\u20132000, declined to about 5% of GDP during 2001\u20132005. Consequently, external \npublic debt fell from 111% of GDP in 2001 to 82% of GDP in 2005. \n \n4.  Although tax receipts have been buoyant, new developments might change the fiscal \npicture. Tax reforms implemented in 2006 (retroactive to the beginning of the year) included a 2 \npercentage point reduction in the payroll tax rate and substantial cuts in corporate and personal \nincome taxes, which have been important sources of state revenue. Increases in motor vehicle \ntaxes and liquor excises, and an anticipated broadening of the tax base, will help offset these \nlosses. Nevertheless, the net effect is likely to be negative, at least initially. \n \n5.  The economy also faces the broader fiscal challenge of achieving debt sustainability, \nwhile addressing essential social expenditures (Figure A1.1). Despite relief granted by the Paris \nClub in 2005, debt indicators will continue to be high. Although 39% of the population remains \npoor, expenditures have been restrained as part of fiscal consolidation measures. Productive \npublic expenditures are essential to raise living standards and help the Kyrgyz Republic meet its \nMillennium Development Goals. \n \n6.  In 2006, the new Tax Code was drafted with substantial technical assistance from the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the Department for International Development (DFID). The \ncode  simplifies  and  clarifies  tax  laws  and  procedures,  helps  improve  tax  administration, \nencourages compliance, and curbs evasion and fraud. The code has been designed to be \nbroadly revenue-neutral. IMF has urged the passage of the Tax Code, which is a conditionality \nunder the current Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility arrangement. \n \n7.  The code provides for several enhancements that will greatly assist in improving the \neffectiveness  of  tax  administration.  For  instance,  the  code  clarifies  procedures  to  enhance \ntaxpayer protection; and, to encourage compliance, it establishes higher interest rates for delayed \npayments  involving  violations  than  for  honest  mistakes.  In  information  and  communication \ntechnology (ICT) adoption, the code provides the legal basis for the establishment of electronic \npreparation and submission of accounting records, tax returns (verified through digital signature), \ntax reports, property declarations, and registers of invoices. Finally, the new code for the first time \nallows the exchange of information between relevant Government agencies, thereby enabling \neffective data exchange and cooperation in enforcement. \n \nB.  Tax Administration \n \n8.  The State Committee for Taxes and Collections (SCTC), formerly called the State Tax \nInspectorate (STI), was established in 1991 as an agency under the Ministry of Finance (MOF). \nA reorganization of the MOF in 2002 merged STI and the State Customs Inspectorate (now \ncalled the State Customs Committee) into the Committee for Revenue. In April 2005, after a \nchange in Government, the committee again was split, and STI was placed under the direct \nsupervision of the Office of the Government (OG). As envisaged, the reorganization would allow \nsufficient focus on tax administration. In January 2007, as part of Government reorganization, \nSTI was renamed and its status upgraded to a full ministry, still under the direct supervision of \nOG. \n \n9.  SCTC  has  about  2,250  personnel,  distributed  among  headquarters  and  the  Large \nTaxpayers Unit (LTU) (194 staff in total), two city offices (Bishkek and Osh), seven provincial \noffices, and 55 district tax offices (Figure A1.2). The organization is now largely function-based, \nboth  in  headquarters  and  in  the  field  offices.  District  offices  are  responsible  for  all  tax \noperations, except for appeals. These are referred to provincial offices, which are primarily ", "22   Appendix 1 \n \ncoordinating  bodies.  These  operations  include  registration,  payments  and  returns  control, \narrears, audit, analysis and statistics, procedures and legal matters, and stamp and excise \ncontrol. \n \nFigure A1.1: Summary Sector Problem Tree \n \n \n \nFragile economic growt h and high poverty rate \n \n \n  \nTax revenues insufficient to ensure macroeconomic stability \n \nwhile financing priority development spending \n \n \n \n  \nInefficient tax administration with insufficient capacity  \n \nfor modern operations \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInadequate  Inadequate staff    Inefficient operating  Weaknesses in tax \nequipment and  skills  framework  policy \n \ninfrastructure \n   \n \n \n \nDevelop central  Develop staff skills    Implement reform  Adopt and \ndatabase and  in modern tax    strategy   implement new  \nmanagement  administration,      Tax Code \ninformation system   basic and    Build capacity for \n \n  advanced ICT    best practices in \nDevelop  skills, data    tax administration   \ncommunication  management, and   \n \ninfrastructure for  business analytics  Establish goal-  \n \ntax offices  setting and \n     \n  performance \n \nEstablish modern    management   \ncentral facilities    system \n       \n \n  Implement change \n \n    management \n    program \n \n \n \nADB project grant support  IMF and DFID advice on \n \nand technical assistance  drafting Tax Code \n \n \nA DB = Asian Development Bank, DFID = Department for International Development, ICT = information and communication \ntechnology, IMF = International Monetary Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.

SCTC\u2019s  weak  level  of  automation  is  an  important  and  highly  visible  constraint  to \nincreasing administrative efficiency. Nevertheless, reforming and modernizing tax administration \nwill require more than computerization. Several non-ICT reforms will also need to be adopted to \nachieve  the  broader  goal  of  business  process  reengineering.  Accordingly,  the  following ", "24   Appendix 1 \n \ndiscussions also highlight weaknesses in organization, operational procedures, and human \nresources that will need to be addressed in conjunction with physical upgrading. \n \n11.  ICT. SCTC\u2019s ICT infrastructure consists of the tax administration software adopted in 1994 \ncalled NALOG (\u201ctax\u201d in Russian), which is built around the concept of taxpayer ledgers (or \npersonal cards) that record all of the taxpayer\u2019s tax activities. It has been superseded by more \nrobust software, Kyrgyzstan Integrated Tax Information System (KITIS). However, only the 16 \nbiggest tax offices use either NALOG or KITIS. In addition, the database of excise stamps and \nlabels is accessible through wireless application protocol services, while a value-added tax (VAT) \ninvoice control system has been introduced to help improve VAT administration. \n \n12.  Due to inadequate automation, almost 50% of SCTC\u2019s workforce is still engaged in the \ninefficient manual processing of tax functions. In many instances, data are encoded twice, \nresulting in delays, errors, and exposure to corrupt practices. The inefficient manual procedures \nare unnecessary in some instances\u2014notification letters are still prepared manually, even though \nautomatic generation is feasible. With proper equipment, SCTC staff engaged in low value-\nadded tasks could be reduced and perhaps redeployed to neglected functions, such as taxpayer \neducation and services. \n \n13.  One means of reducing the processing workload of SCTC staff is to outsource the work \nto the banks, especially the State Settlement and Savings Company (SSSC), which handles \nabout 70% of tax payments. Effective implementation of this method, however, will require the \ninstallation of data links between the banks and SCTC, instead of the current method of using \ncouriers to transfer paper records. \n \n14.  The following priority ICT investments, therefore, have been identified: (i) revisions to \nKITIS to optimize the structure of the database, facilitate automatic generation of notifications \nand reports, and correct deficiencies; (ii) installation of hardware, systems software, and a \nnetwork  infrastructure  to  enable  a  client-server  and  centralized  processing  environment; \n(iii) development of an electronic platform for taxpayer registration; (iv) development of an ICT \nplatform for filing of tax returns through the Internet (initially, only for LTU), and for transferring \ndata  seamlessly  between  the  tax  offices  and  the  central  database;  (v) development  of  an \nInternet-based tax payment system that will move payments data electronically between SCTC \nand the Treasury; (vi) rollout of KITIS to all tax offices; (vii) establishment of other electronically \nbased services to facilitate voluntary compliance and self-assessment; and (viii) repair and \nrehabilitation of tax offices to insure a proper environment for effective ICT use and efficient \nworkflows. \n \n15.  Taxpayer Registration. The pressing need is to make it easier for taxpayers to register, \nand for SCTC to update its records. Specifically, the project to establish one-stop services for \nregistrants has not yet started, some taxpayers who are far from SCTC offices find registration \ndifficult, forms and procedures need to be simplified (e.g., instead of having taxpayers bring \ncash  register  machines  to  SCTC  offices,  manufacturers  should  be  able  to  certify  to  the \nmachines\u2019 compliance), and computerization in SCTC offices needs to be improved to facilitate \nrecordkeeping. \n \n16.  Filing. International best practice is to make filing as convenient as possible. Currently, \nhowever, taxpayers often have to file returns at SCTC offices before proceeding to banks to make \ntheir payments. SCTC regulations should allow for these two steps to be done in one place. Filing \ncan also be facilitated by establishing an electronic filing modality, initially for large taxpayers. \n ", "                                                                                                                                                    Appendix 1  25   \n17.  Payments. The SCTC offices need a payments system that is faster, less error-prone, \nless corruption-prone, and less reliant on cash transactions. Currently, payment data have to be \nmanually encoded, summary forms have to be delivered physically, and reconciliation often is \nbeset by numerical errors, as well as being vulnerable to corrupt practices. Generally, payments \nare made through banks. Each tax office establishes a settlement account with a particular \nbank, although taxpayers are allowed to pay through other banks. After receiving payments \nfrom taxpayers, the bank sends the payment orders by messenger to the Treasury, which then \nsplits the receipts between Republican and Local Government budgets and prepares a roster to \nreflect this. Next, the tax office messenger picks up the roster and the payment orders. Payment \ninformation is manually encoded into KITIS or NALOG if the district tax office is computerized, \nor manually posted on taxpayers\u2019 personal cards if not. Recorded payments are reconciled daily \nwith  data  in  the  banking  and  Treasury  networks.  The  workflows  should  be  revised  and \ncomputerization adopted to make data transmission faster and less error-prone, and to enable \nbanks to transmit information simultaneously to SCTC without involving the Treasury in the \nprocess.  \n \n18.  Processing of Returns. After filing, tax returns are sent for processing, which involves \nreviewing  mathematical  accuracy  of  computations,  generating  the  notification  to  pay,  and \nposting select returns data onto personal cards. In tax offices using the NALOG or those that do \nnot have computer systems, the reviews are done manually or using calculators. In offices that \nuse KITIS, the system\u2019s built-in algorithm automatically detects discrepancies between the tax \ndeclaration  and  the  computed  value.  However,  the  system  does  not  show  the  amount \ncalculated, requiring tax inspectors to verify the computation manually as well. In addition, KITIS \nhas not been modified to accommodate the changes to the tax code, which can lead to the \nalgorithm  mistakenly  concluding  that  declarations  are  erroneous  even  though  a  manual \ncomputation reveals otherwise.\u00a0The current practice of numerical review of returns by SCTC \nstaff during filing is contrary to the principle of self-assessment and a wasteful duplication of \nefforts. Ideally, the processing of returns should be a mechanical procedure that uses resources \nefficiently and reduces contact between taxpayers and SCTC staff. Reviews should be done at \nthe audit stage. \n \n19.  Audits and VAT Invoices. Current law requires the auditing of each taxpayer once a \nyear, which is a waste of resources. SCTC staff should use risk-assessment techniques and \nthird-party  information  (from  State  Customs  Committee,  central  Treasury,  banks,  etc.)  to \nundertake targeted audits. Apart from upgrading ICT, however, SCTC needs to upgrade its \nstaff\u2019s capacity to undertake audits by recruiting more and better-trained auditors. The auditing \nand settlement process with delinquent taxpayers should be systematic and transparent, and \nshould  incorporate  appropriate  penalties  and  incentives  for  speedy  settlement.  For  VAT \ninvoicing, the current system is cumbersome because businesses can obtain invoices only from \nSCTC offices, have to record and monitor all invoices issued, and have to submit returns \nmonthly. VAT invoices can be monitored more efficiently using modern audit techniques based \non risk assessment, which would be applied after returns and input claims have been filed. \n \n20.  Arrears Management. Arrears, after falling to less than Som300 million in 2003, rose to \nSom2.2 billion in 2005\u201433.2% higher than in 2004. Tax debt is also highly concentrated. Two \nlarge debtors (state-owned utility companies in the energy sector) account for more than half of \nall taxes owed to SCTC.\u00a0Due to inadequate ICT, detection of arrears is often tardy. However, \nthe interpretation of the provision of Article 47 of the Tax Code regarding the order in which \npayments are applied also requires clarification. \n ", "26   Appendix 1 \n \n21.  LTU. Only LTU and two tax offices are electronically connected to SCTC headquarters, \nand the connection capacities are insufficient. Of LTU\u2019s 235 clients, only 165 (mainly large \nbusinesses in Bishkek) use LTU\u2019s full range of services. For the others, including those outside \nBishkek, services are restricted to audits due to infrastructure limitations, such as lack of reliable \nmail service, electronic return filing, and network automation support. \n \n22.  LTU\u2019s  performance  has  been  generally  satisfactory.  Recently,  it  met  the  target, \nestablished under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility program with the IMF, of collecting \n60% of SCTC revenues. Most of its 235 clients operate under self-assessment. Given this solid \nfoundation, LTU is a suitable venue for piloting electronic filing and payments. Before that, \nhowever, LTU needs investment in physical modernization. As with the rest of SCTC, LTU has \ninadequate ICT systems. Currently, LTU and the Bishkek tax office are housed in premises \nrented from the State Customs Committee. These offices are not sufficiently accessible, and \nhave layouts that are inconsistent with service orientation and modern workflows. \n \n23.  Taxpayer Education and Services. SCTC provides virtually no taxpayer education and \nservices. Further, SCTC has only limited focus and no specific budget allocation for these \nimportant  functions.  Although  tax  offices  post  information  bulletins  in  their  public  areas, \ngenerally this is limited (one-time dissemination of changes to the Tax Code and implementing \nrules and regulations), and offices provide little follow-through and do not seek to address \ntaxpayers\u2019 concerns proactively. \n ", "                                                                                                                                                          Appendix 2   27 \nMAJOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE FOR TAX ADMINISTRATION \n \nSource  Areas of Assistance  Scope  Status \nInternational  Overall economic policy,  Advice and financial  Ongoing \nMonetary Fund  including macro fiscal  assistance, through   \nmanagement  the PRGF program   \n     \nTax policy and tax  Technical advice and  Completed June 2006 \nadministration  assignment of a \nregional advisor on \ntax administration \nWorld Bank  Public expenditure  Modernization of the  Ongoing \nmanagement  Kyrgyz Republic \nTreasury\u2019s banking, \npayment, debt \nservicing, and \nexpenditure \ncommitment \noperations \n \nAssistance provided \nthrough the GSAC \nand GTAC  \nUnited States  Tax administration  Establishment of  Completed 2002 \nAgency for  modernization  KITIS software in   \nInternational    SCTC headquarters   \nDevelopment       \nTax policy  Advice, in cooperation  Completed 2005 \nwith IMF, on drafting \nof Tax Code \nUnited Kingdom  Tax administration  Small-scale  Ongoing \nDepartment for  modernization  assistance to partially   \nInternational    upgrade KITIS and   \nDevelopment    provide   \n  recommendations on   \n  adoption of risk-  \n  assessment methods   \n  and simplification of   \n  taxpayer reporting   \n  requirements   \n     \nOverall fiscal management  Advice on formulation  Completed \nof medium-term \nbudgetary framework; \ncapacity building for \nmacro fiscal analysis \nGSAC = Governance Structural Adjustment Credit, GTAC = Governance Technical Assistance Credit, IMF = \nInternational Monetary Fund, KITIS = Kyrgyzstan Integrated Tax Information System, PRGF = Poverty Reduction and \nGrowth Facility, SCTC = State Committee for Taxes and Collections.  \nSources: International Monetary Fund, World Bank, United Kingdom Department for International Development, and \nUnited States Agency for International Development.

Introduction \n \n1.  The financial management capacity of the State Committee for Taxes and Collections \n(SCTC) was assessed using the financial management questionnaire of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). \n \nB.  Results \n \n2.  SCTC has adequate accounting and financial management policies and procedures in \nplace to manage the annual operating budget that the Ministry of Finance allocates to it. Control \nand measures over budgeting and cost control seem to be adequate, with the head of finance \nclosely monitoring the spending of each unit and questioning the respective departments and \nunits  on  budget  overruns.  The  existing  computerized  accounting  software  can  provide  for \nseparate project accounting. \n \n3.  SCTC has no experience in managing disbursements from ADB and foreign exchange \nrisk. Relevant staff will need to be trained in ADB procedures. \n \n4.  In view of the Tax Administration Reform and Modernization Project, the importance of \nimplementing and strengthening policies and procedures relating to conflict of interest and \nreporting options for whistle-blowers must be emphasized, as strong policies in these areas are \nessential to prevent wasteful and fraudulent use of resources. To achieve this, all employees \nshould receive a special briefing. \n \n5.  The project management office (PMO) had not been set up at the time of evaluation, but \npreparation is underway. The terms of reference for the positions in the PMO have been drafted \nand recruitment is expected to start in June 2007. The interim project director has indicated that \nthe potential candidate for the finance specialist/accountant position would have experience in \nmanaging ADB projects.  \n \n6.  The finance specialist/accountant will establish the chart of accounts to correctly record \nand account for the activities of the PMO, and to ensure that all reporting and disbursement \nrequirements of ADB are met. This person should also be trained in methods for effective \nmanagement of foreign exchange risk. \n \n7.  The specific role and responsibility of SCTC\u2019s Financial Unit in relation to the Project \nshould  be  clearly  defined  to  minimize  conflicts  between  the  Project\u2019s  finance \nspecialist/accountant and the financial unit. \n \n8.  The adequacy of controls over the operation of the Project\u2019s imprest account could not \nbe assessed, as these have not been established. However, SCTC indicated that it would \nclosely adhere to ADB\u2019s procedures and guidelines. \n ", "                                                                                                                                     Appendix 9   39 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING AND  \nCAPACITY BUILDING FOR TAX ADMINISTRATION REFORM \n \nA.

Financial Analysis \n \n1.  The proposed Project, like all tax administration projects, has clearly defined financial \nbenefits and costs. However, the economic benefits are hard to identify and to quantify. The \nfinancial benefits are increases in tax revenues. Knowing the project costs, the financial internal \nrate of return (FIRR) can be calculated. From an economic point of view, however, these \nincreased revenues are intersectoral transfers and are not relevant in calculating the economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR).  However,  the  Project  has  also  indirect  benefits,  including \n(i) potentially higher growth resulting from effective use of the increased revenues, (ii) additional \nincrease in the tax base from the efficiencies and growth stimuli arising from reduced corruption \nand compliance costs, and (iii) social benefits to the extent that the increased revenues are \nused  for  pro-poor  expenditures.  These  indirect  benefits,  however,  are  extremely  hard  to \nquantify. Hence, the proposed Project is not amenable to straightforward economic benefit-cost \nanalysis. The following analysis, therefore, is limited to calculating the FIRR. To the extent that \nthe indirect and hard-to-quantify benefits lead to additional tax revenues, the FIRRs calculated \nin this analysis will be lower bounds. \n \n2.  The Project\u2019s financial costs total $12.5 million. Costs for maintenance, replacement, \nand upgrade of equipment are estimated to be $1.85 million per year. All equipment, software, \nand information and communication technology licenses are assumed to be replaced/renewed \nevery 4 years, at a cost equal to 100% of the initial cost. \n \n3.  The financial analysis is conducted by comparing the \u201cwith Project\u201d and \u201cwithout Project\u201d \nscenarios. The FIRR is calculated over 25 years. The analysis makes conservative assumptions \nregarding the increases in tax collection arising from the Project. The estimated gains are based \non  the  consultants\u2019  expert  assessments  of  the  revenue  increases  that  can  be  reasonably \nexpected to result from successful implementation of the Project, and in close consultation with \nthe State Committee for Taxes and Collections (SCTC) and other stakeholders. Thus, tax \ncollections are assumed to increase by only 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010 \n(compared with the without project scenario), rising to 0.2% of GDP by 2013 and to 0.5% of \nGDP by 2022, and remaining constant to the end of the analysis period. Based on these \nassumptions, the FIRR of the Project is about 34% (Table A11.1). \n \nB.  Sensitivity Analysis \n \n4.  The Project\u2019s economic viability was also tested by assessing the effects of two key \nshocks (Table A11.2). Scenario 1 assumes that the increase in tax collections amounts to only \n0.2% of GDP in 2013, and that this increase remains constant to 2031. Scenario 2 assumes that \nincremental  maintenance  costs  double  to  $2 million  per  year.  In  each  scenario,  the  FIRR \nremains  comfortably  above  the  threshold  of  12%.  A  third  analysis  was  also  conducted, \ncombining the two previous scenarios. In Scenario 3, the EIRR drops to 13%, but is still above \nthe threshold. \n \nC.  Financial Sustainability \n \n5.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to poverty reduction in the Kyrgyz Republic: \n \nIn  view  of  the  country\u2019s  low  income  and  high  poverty  levels,  achieving  sustainable  growth  is  a  fundamental \nrequirement for progress in poverty reduction. In its long-term development framework, the Country Development \nStrategy (CDS), the Kyrgyz Republic takes a comprehensive approach to poverty reduction. The strategy entails \n(i) maintaining high rates of economic growth, (ii) creating a favorable business environment for private sector-led \ngrowth,  (iii) minimizing  corruption  and  improving  public  governance,  (iv) linking  Government  spending  with \ndevelopment programs; and (v) reforming tax and customs systems. \n \nThe Government of the Kyrgyz Republic aims to reform the tax system to increase revenue collection, while reducing \nthe burden on economic entities and reducing the informal economy. Tax administration reform and modernization can \nhelp the Kyrgyz Republic achieve the poverty reduction objectives in its CDS by (i) assisting in maintaining the \nmacroeconomic stability that is a precondition for sustained growth, and (ii) helping produce the revenues needed for \nexpanding social services. A reformed and modernized tax administration will also help spur private sector-led growth. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nThe level of absolute poverty peaked at about 60% in 1999 following the Russian economic crisis. Although the \neconomy has recovered since then, poverty incidence remains high, with data showing that about 45% of the \npopulation lives in absolute poverty. About 13% lives in extreme poverty. Income inequality has also worsened, with \nthe Gini index rising from 30% in 2000 to 33% in 2004. \n \nA consensus has emerged on the causes and determinants of poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic. The high levels of \npoverty can be traced to the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, which caused severe reductions in production \ndue  to  the  disruption  of  trade  links  and  the  loss  of  traditional  markets.  This,  in  turn,  led  to  sharply  higher \nunemployment at a time when a shrinking revenue base reduced the state\u2019s ability to provide social safety nets. \n \nThe continuing high levels of poverty are largely due to challenges in reforming state institutions and restructuring the \neconomy  and  society  according  to  market  mechanisms.  The  following  specific  issues  have  been  noted: \n(i) employment generation has been difficult; (ii) tapping global markets has been difficult due to the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s \nlandlocked situation, limited resources, and small domestic market; (iii) the state\u2019s capacity to address essential needs \nis limited due to fiscal constraints; and (iv) continuing corruption and inefficiency in state administration inhibit private \nenterprise and legitimate economic activity. \n \nThe CDS is the medium-term operational plan for poverty reduction. The overall objective of the CDS is improving the \nliving standards of Kyrgyz Republic citizens by fostering sustainable economic growth, promoting full employment, \nachieving steady growth of incomes, and making available a wide spectrum of social services. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nExtensive consultations with stakeholders were undertaken during project preparation to foster a broad consensus on \nthe main components of the Project and to ensure compatibility of ongoing reform efforts. Consultations were held with \nother  relevant  Government  agencies,  other  multilateral/bilateral  development  partners,  business  associations, \ntaxpayers\u2019 groups, and tax service professionals. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?
