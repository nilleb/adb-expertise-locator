It is also one of the PRC\u2019s most energy-intensive industries. \nIn 2013, its energy intensity of 1.78 tce per CNY10,000 output was about 5.5% below the 2010 \nlevel  but  still  twice  as  high  as  the  best  international  standards.  With  a  target  of  20%,  the \nchemical  industry  is  expected  to  make  larger  contributions  to  energy  intensity  improvement \nduring  the  period  of  the  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015  compared  to  the  national  target \nacross  all  economic sectors  of  16%. The Government  of the  PRC  is  expected  to  take  a  more \nstringent approach in the period of the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 and beyond to (i) \nslow  the  growth  in  coal  consumption  and  overall  energy  demand  by  2020,  and  (ii)  achieve  a \npeaking in the PRC\u2019s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2030. \n \n4. \nThe PRC\u2019s chemical industry faces unique challenges to further reduce energy intensity \nbecause  unlike  other  major  chemical  producers  worldwide,  it  predominantly  uses  coal  rather \nthan  petroleum  or  natural  gas  as  feedstock  and  fuel. 5 Coal-based  processes  are  inherently \nmore  energy  intensive  and  produce  significantly  more  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  and \nlocal air pollution. Technology innovations and process transformations are essential to further \nimprove  energy  efficiency  and  reduce  emissions.  Many  such  technologies  and  process \ntransformations  have  been  researched  and  successfully  pilot  tested  in  the  PRC,  but  their \ncommercial deployment has been delayed by various barriers (para. 7).   \n \n5. \nThe  PRC\u2019s  chemical  industry  is  a  major  emitter  of  air  and  other  toxic  pollutants,  and \nGHGs. In 2013, the chemical industry discharged more wastewater, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen \noxides  than  any  other  industry  in  the  country.  Within  the  chemical  industry,  the  production  of \nplastics is particularly energy and emission intensive. Fluoropolymer, a synthetic carbon-based \nplastic  commonly  used  to  provide  corrosion-resistant  coating,  is  an  important  source  of \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ChemChina  is  the  largest  state-owned  enterprise  in  the  chemical  industry  of  the  PRC.  It  owns  more  than  100 \n\nindustries and 24 research and development institutes. In 2014, the group\u2019s turnover reached CNY244 billion. \n\n3   ADB  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2013.  Technical  Assistance  for  Preparing  the \n\nChemical Industry Energy Efficiency and Emission Reduction Project. Manila.  \n\n4   The iron and steel industry is the PRC\u2019s largest industrial energy consumer.  \n5   Coal is preferred because it is abundantly available and holds a cost advantage in the domestic market. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nemissions of fluoroform (HFC-23), a GHG that is 14,800 times more potent than CO2.6 HFC-23 \nincineration  technologies  are  available,  but  they  have  not  been  deployed  widely  in  the  PRC \nbecause of inadequate regulation and incentives.7  \n \nMore  than  80%  of  polyvinyl  chloride  (PVC)  production  in  the  PRC  uses  coal-derived \n6. \nfeedstock 8 and  a  catalyst  based  on  mercury,  a  toxic  chemical  element  that  persists  in  the \nenvironment  once  mobilized. 9 PVC  production  accounts  for  more  than  70%  of  domestic  and \nnearly 50% of global intentional use of mercury. Moreover, to provide mercury for this industrial \nuse, mercury mining is still practiced in the PRC, posing a major threat to the environment and \npublic health. In 2010, the government issued a notice to phase out the use of mercury in the \nPVC industry. Research for an alternative catalyst was included in the National Basic Research \nProgram, but to date no alternative catalyst has been demonstrated at commercial scale. \n \n7. \nChemChina is the PRC\u2019s largest producer of fluoropolymer, PVC, synthetic resins, and \nfine  chemicals.  Potent  technologies  and  process  transformations  that  can  improve  energy \nefficiency  and  lead  to  deep  cuts  in  emissions  in  the  industry  have  been  developed  and  pilot \ntested  by  ChemChina\u2019s  research  and  development  institutes,  such  as  mercury-free  PVC \nproduction.  However,  their  scale-up  has  been  difficult  because  of  (i)  perceived  and  real \ntechnical risks; (ii) the need for debt financing, which commercial financing institutions with their \nweak understanding of the financial viability of such projects are unable to provide; (iii) lack of \nstrict regulatory requirements to incentivize investments as relevant technologies have not been \ndemonstrated at commercial scale; and (iv) the lack of a suitable ESCO that can bring together \ntechnical know-how and suitable financing. \n \nThe  ESCO  sector,  which  has  been  effective  in  driving  energy  efficiency  investments  in \n8. \nother  countries,  is  a  priority  for  the  government.  ESCOs  have  grown  rapidly  in  the  PRC  since \n2006, numbering more than 5,000 and reaching a turnover of more than CNY165 billion by the \nend of 2013. But the ESCOs still lack (i) the capacity to finance and implement more complex \nand larger industrial energy efficiency projects; (ii) access to or knowledge of innovative, high-\nimpact technologies; and (iii) the service standards needed to build trust among financiers and \nhost  industries.  Also,  there  are  no  industry-specific  ESCOs  with  technical  expertise  in  the \nchemical industry. \n \n9. \nADB support will be crucial to address the key issues and barriers identified in paras. 7 \nand  8  and facilitate to  commercial-scale  demonstration  of  strategic  technologies.  ADB funding \nsupports de-risking of investments and ADB due diligence and enhanced monitoring measures \nwill  ensure  that  technical  and  other  associated  risks  are  adequately  managed.  Moreover,  the \nbusiness  models  developed  with  ADB  support  will  ensure  timely  replication.  Because  of  the \nrelatively  shorter  payback period  (5  to  7  years) for  typical  industrial  energy  efficiency  projects, \nthe FIL modality was chosen to allow multiple rollover of the ADB loan over the loan tenor. By \nfurther  leveraging  commercial  cofinancing  with  ADB  funding,  the  project  will  target  a  higher \nimpact in improving energy efficiency and emission reduction than would otherwise be possible \n\n                                                \n6   In 2013, the PRC emitted nearly 9,500 tons of untreated HFC-23, or nearly 140 million tons of CO2 equivalent. \n7   HFC-23  destruction  involves  an  energy  penalty  at  the  plant  level.  Its  inclusion  among  the  clean  development \nmechanism\u2013eligible  mitigation  measures  led  to  its  use  in  some  plants  in  the  PRC  and  to  disproportionately  high \nclean development mechanism credits earned. But the decision to stop buying such credits from 2013 onwards has \ndrastically stalled the wider adoption of HFC-23 destruction measures.  \n\n8   Although  it  is  more  than  twice  as  energy  intensive  as  the  petroleum-based  process,  the  coal-based  process  is \n\nmore cost-effective in the PRC because of the lower price of coal (about one-third the price of petroleum).  \n\n9   From 2002 to 2013, the PRC\u2019s PVC production increased from 3.0 million tons to 12.5 million tons using the coal-\n\nbased process. As a result, mercury use in this sector increased from 350 tons to about 1,300 tons.  \n\n \n\n\fwith  a  project  loan.  The  two  subprojects  in  the  first  batch  will  scale  up  pilot-tested  innovative \ntechnologies  in  selected  ChemChina  plants  to  (i)  reduce  energy  consumption  and  eliminate \nmercury use in one of the largest PVC plants, and (ii) destroy HFC-23 at a major fluoropolymer \nplant.10 Packaging  HFC-23  destruction  at  the  selected  fluoropolymer  plant  with  state-of-the-art \nenergy efficiency measures will (i) support the financial viability of the investment even under a \nvery weak incentive structure and despite the energy penalties for HFC-23 destruction, and (ii) \ndemonstrate a new business model in the process. It will also directly support and demonstrate \nthe commercial viability of industry-specific ESCO financing and services for such projects. \n \n10. \nADB  has  supported  three  other  industrial  energy  efficiency  and  emission  reduction \nprojects in the provinces of Guangdong, Hebei, and Shandong.11 The following lessons from the \nprevious projects have been incorporated in the project design: (i) the choice of the FIL modality \nwith 10-year grace period was adopted from previous designs, as this was found best suited for \nscaling  up  the  impact  of  ADB  assistance;  (ii)  a more  rigorous  review  of first  batch  subprojects \nwas  conducted  to  avoid  dropping  out  of  one  or  more  subprojects  and  to  ensure  timely \ndisbursement;  and  (iii)  a  professional  ESCO  with  competent  technical  staff  and  access  to \nrelevant  technologies  was  chosen  as  the  project  implementation  unit  to  support  effective \nselection and appraisal of future subprojects, and reduce associated risks. Unlike the previous \nprojects, the proposed project applies ESCO use from first batch subprojects. This will reduce \nthe risk identified in the previous projects on the likelihood of ESCO engagement. \n \nThe  project  is  closely  aligned  with  (i)  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015,  \n11. \nand  the  emerging  priorities  of  the  next  country  partnership  strategy,  which  identifies \nenvironmental sustainability as a key pillar for ADB support in the PRC and emphasizes support \nfor energy efficiency improvements as a priority area in the energy sector; and (ii) ADB\u2019s Energy \nPolicy, which defines energy efficiency as a key measure toward clean energy development. 12   \n \nB. \n\nImpact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n12. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  enhanced  environmental  sustainability  of  the  PRC\u2019s \nchemical industry. The outcome will be reduced energy intensity and emissions from PVC and \nfluoropolymer production within ChemChina. \n \n13. \nThe outputs will be (i) more efficient and less hazardous PVC technology demonstrated \nat commercial scale at the Dezhou Shihua Chemical (DSC) plant, and (ii) energy efficiency and \ngreenhouse gas abatement measures implemented at Zhonghao Chenguang Research Institute \nof Chemical Industry (CGY).13 \n \n\n                                                \n10 The  first  batch  of  subprojects  selected  by  ADB  met  the  technical,  financial,  economic,  social,  and  safeguards \ncriteria  explained  in  the  Project  Administration  Manual  (PAM)  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \nAppendix 2). The same selection criteria will be used in selecting subsequent batches of subprojects.  \n\n11  ADB.  2008.

It will also eliminate 35 tons of intentional \nuse of mercury per year by 2019 and avoid 1.359 million tons of CO2 emissions. The successful \ndemonstration  of  the  new  technology  is  likely  to  trigger  the  complete  phase  out  of  currently \napplied mercury-based technology making the replication potential therefore very large.15  \n \nUnder  the  second  subproject,  comprehensive  energy  efficiency  optimization  measures \n15. \nwill  be  implemented,  and  a  real-time  energy  management  system  will  be  installed.  These \nenergy  efficiency  investments  will  reduce  the  energy  consumption  of  the  CGY  plant  in  Zigong \nCity, Sichuan Province by 10,888 tce per year. The measures will be combined with scaled-up \nplasma incineration of HFC-23 at the CGY plant.16 The effective destruction of 890 tons of HFC-\n23  will  avoid  emissions  of  13.1  million  tons  of  CO2  equivalent  and  1,205  tons  of  organic \nfluoride.17 Net energy savings from the subproject will be 8,905 tce.18 The packaging of HFC-23 \ndestruction with energy efficiency measures provides a business model for ESCOs that can be \nreplicated in similar plants in the PRC. \n \n16. \nA  newly  established  ESCO,  Beijing  Zhonghao  Huatai  Energy  Technology  (Huatai), \nwhich is fully owned by China Haohua Chemical Group (CHC), will support the implementation \nof both subprojects in the first batch, and will identify and implement future subprojects applying \npredefined  project  selection  criteria  and  the  environmental  and  social  management  system \n(ESMS). 19  For  the  first  subproject  at  DSC,  Huatai\u2019s  services  will  primarily  involve  hiring \ncontractors  and  supervising  implementation  of  the  subproject.20 For  the  second  subproject  at \nCGY, Huatai will, in addition, act as subborrower on the basis of an energy savings performance \ncontract  with  CGY.21 The  implementation  of  the  project  will  strengthen  Huatai\u2019s  capacities  in \ndifferent  service  aspects  of  the  ESCO  business.  Huatai  will  be  assisted  by  CHC  in  effectively \nfacilitating  financing,  managing  procurement,  coordinating  with  and  preparing  reports  to  ADB, \nand  promoting  good  governance  and  compliance  with  safeguards  beyond  the  first  batch  of \nsubprojects. Its capacity will be strengthened as a result. \n \n\n                                                \n14  The technology was pilot tested in three phases: (i) laboratory scale, (ii) small scale, and (iii) industrial pilot-scale \ntesting  of  2,000  tons  per  year.  After  validating  the  test  results  in  August  2014,  an  independent  panel  of  PVC \nexperts  from  the  PRC  determined  the  technology  to  be  of  international  standard  and  approved  it  for  commercial \nscale-up.  \n\n15 The  PRC  is  party  to  the  Minamata  Convention  on  Mercury,  which  is  aimed  at  eliminating  the  intentional  use  of \nmercury, and controlling and reducing global emissions of the toxic chemical. Annex B of the convention requires \nthat parties phase out mercury use in the PVC industry in a period of 5 years once the Conference of Parties has \nestablished  that  an  alternative  catalyst  technology  has  been  proven  to  be  technically  and  commercially  viable. \nMinamata  Convention  on  Mercury.  http://www.mercuryconvention.org/Portals/11/documents/Booklets/Minamata% \n20Convention%20on%20Mercury_booklet_English.pdf \n\n16 CGY\u2019s pilot plant has an incineration capacity of 200 tons of HFC-23 per year. It was set up in 2007 and has since \nmet all performance requirements reliably. Plasma incineration of HFC-23 has co-benefits in the form of avoided \nemissions of (i) toxic and carcinogenic dioxin, which can cause reproductive and developmental problems, and (ii) \norganic fluoride, a persistent and non-degradable poison that accumulates in soil, plants, wildlife, and humans.  \n\n17 In 2014, all of ADB\u2019s clean energy investments combined avoided about 7 million tons of CO2 emissions.   \n18 The plasma incineration of HFC-23 has an energy penalty of 1,983 tce per year. \n19 The associated costs for the establishment of the ESMS and the required training of project entities will be covered \n\nby Huatai, CHC, and ChemChina.  \n\n20 The  engagement  of  Huatai  through  an  energy  savings  performance  contract  is  beyond  the  capacity  of  the  first \n\nsubproject at DSC, which will have a total investment cost of more than $200 million.    \n\n21 Huatai\u2019s business plan, developed with ADB support during project preparation, identifies different business models \nfor  different  energy  efficiency  projects.  Huatai  is  expected  to  develop  a  platform  for  commercializing  innovative \nenergy efficiency technologies at ChemChina and beyond, on the basis of appropriate models. \n\n \n\n\fInvestment and Financing Plans  \n  \nThe  project  investment  cost,  including  the  expected  rollover  of  funds,  is  estimated  at \n\nC. \n \n17. \n$565.0 million, $245.0 million of which is for the first batch of subprojects (Table 1). 22 \n\n \n\n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\nItem \nSubproject 1 \nSubproject 2 \nTotalb  \n\nAmounta \n205.7 \n39.3 \n245.0 \n\na   Includes taxes and duties of $19.66 million to be financed from government sources ($7.39 million) and ADB loan \n\nresources ($12.27 million).  \nb   In mid-2015 cost estimates.   \n  Physical contingencies were computed at 7% for civil works, and 7% for field research and development, training, \nsurveys,  and  studies.

Commitment  charges  for  an  ADB  loan  are \n0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount. \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n18. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $100.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help finance  the project,  including  transportation  and  insurance  costs,  taxes,  and \nduties.23 The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  10  years,24 an  annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate-based lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year,  a  straight-line  repayment  option,  and  such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The average loan \nmaturity is 12.75 years; therefore, no maturity premium will be payable to ADB. The subproject \nborrowers  will  finance  $63.3  million  through  equity  contributions.  China  Construction  Bank \n(CCB) will cofinance $81.7 million on a collaborative basis. \n \n19. \n \n\nThe financing plan for the first batch of subprojects is in Table 2. \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n     Ordinary capital resources (loan)  \nCounterpart financing \nChina Construction Bank  \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n \n100.0 \n63.3 \n81.7 \n245.0 \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n\n \n40.81 \n25.83 \n33.36 \n100.00 \n\n                                                \n22  For  the  first  batch  of  subprojects,  ADB  subloan  amounts  will  not  exceed  55%  of  the  total  subproject  investment \ncosts. For subsequent batches, financing from revolved ADB loan proceeds will be reduced to a maximum of 40% \nof  the  investment cost  to  encourage an  increased  share  of  cofinancing.  Commercial cofinancing  will  match  ADB \nfunds at a ratio of at least 1:1. Equity financing will not be less than 20%. As ADB loan proceeds are expected to \nbe rolled over 1.2 more times during the loan tenor, additional lending of $240 million and total investments of $320 \nmillion for future subprojects can be mobilized. \n\n23 The  amount  of  taxes  and  duties  was  determined  according  to  the  following  principles:  the  taxes  and  duties \n(i) should be consistent with the current country partnership strategy of ADB, (ii) should not represent an excessive \nshare  of  the  project  investment  plan,  and  (iii)  should  apply  only  to  ADB-financed  expenditures.  Moreover, the \nfinancing of the taxes and duties should be material and relevant to the success of the project. \n\n24 A longer grace period is essential to allow for an effective rollover of ADB loan proceeds.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n20. \nThe  PRC  will  be  the  borrower.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  onlent  from  the  Ministry  of \nFinance to CCB, from CCB to CHC through ChemChina on the terms and conditions in the loan \nagreement.  CCB  will  charge  an  onlending  fee  of  1%  on  both  onlending  transactions  i.e.,  from \nonlending  to  ChemChina  and  from  ChemChina  to  CHC. 25 CHC  will  establish  the  REF  and \ninterest  differential  account  (IDA)  at  CCB  under  the  REF  and  IDA  account  management \nagreement.  26 CCB  will  execute  subloan  agreements  in  a  form  and  on  terms  and  conditions \nacceptable to ADB. The interest rate on subproject loans will be the higher of (i) the interest rate \npayable  by  ChemChina,  or  (ii)  90%  of  the  prime  rate  set  by  the  People\u2019s  Bank  of  China  for \ncommercial bank loans with the same terms as the subloans.27 ChemChina will bear the credit \nrisk,28 while  CHC  and  subborrowers  will  share  currency  exchange  and  interest rate fluctuation \nrisks.  Fund  flow,  implementation,  and  risk  sharing  arrangements  are  described  in  detail  in \nsections III and IV of the project administration manual (PAM).29 \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3. \n\n21. \n \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nLoan closing date \nFinancial intermediary  \n\nExecuting agency \n\nImplementing agency \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nMarch 2016\u2013February 2021 (estimated)  \n31 August 2021 \nCCB was selected through a competitive process to act as the onlending bank and \nfinancial intermediary. It will be responsible for (i) providing a guarantee to the Ministry \nof Finance; (ii) onlending ADB loan proceeds; (iii)  managing the REF and an interest \ndifferential account; (iv) executing and implementing subloan agreements with \nsubproject borrowers; (v) managing disbursement, interest payment, and collection of \nprincipal; (vi) facilitating timely reporting to ADB and auditing of Statements of \nUtilization of Funds; (vii) conducting financial due diligence of future subprojects; and \n(viii) making suitable recommendations to the steering committee on subproject \nselection. CCB will provide parallel commercial collaborative cofinancing at its own risk, \nand can make loan pricing and approval decisions freely.  \nChemChina will implement the project through CHC, bear the credit risk, onlend loan \nproceeds to CHC, and supervise overall implementation through the steering \ncommittee.  \nCHC will implement the project through the project implementation unit established at \nHuatai. CHC will exercise supervisory control and provide support to Huatai. Huatai will \n(i) facilitate the implementation of subprojects by helping to prepare quarterly subproject \nreports and withdrawal applications to be submitted to ADB in accordance with the \n\n                                                \n25  This multilayered onlending structure, which has worked well in previous projects, is an established practice in the \nPRC to provide sovereign guaranteed loans to state-owned enterprises.

Manila. \n\n26  The tenor of subloans will be adjusted to the subprojects\u2019 payback periods and cash flow characteristics, allowing \nthe  rollover  of  ADB  loan  proceeds.  As  funds  are  onlent  at  near-commercial  terms,  a  complementary  interest \ndifferential  account  will also  need  to  be  established.  The  interest  differential  will  be  partially  used  (up  to 40%) to \ngradually strengthen Huatai\u2019s equity base and increase the financing capacity of the ESCO in the future. \n\n27  The  People\u2019s  Bank  of  China  publishes  three  reference  rates:  1  year,  up  to  5  years,  and  beyond  5  years.  The \napplicable reference rate will depend on the chosen term for a subloan. This proposed subloan lending rate does \nnot  provide  a  significant  subsidy  over  the  market  rates,  but  gives  subborrowers  an  incentive  to  invest  in  energy \nefficiency. \n\n28 On  the  basis  of  the  credit  rating  and  the  asset  scale  of  ChemChina,  CCB  has  granted  it  a  credit  line  of  CNY40 \nbillion ($6.5 billion equivalent). The outstanding balance of the $100.0 million ADB loan will be part of this credit line \nas  ChemChina\u2019s  counter-guarantee  for  CCB\u2019s  guarantee  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance.

It  reviewed  pilot  test  results  and  assessed  first  batch  subprojects  to  be  technically \nfeasible. It further confirmed (i) projected energy savings, (ii) cost estimates, and (iii) adequacy \nof  implementation  arrangements  and  the  schedule  for  first  batch  subprojects.  It  assessed \ntechnical  risks  inherent  to  the  scale-up  and  found  them  to  be  manageable.  It  also  found  the \nsubborrowers\u2019  capacity  in  managing  technical  risks  to  be  adequate,  and  concluded  that  the \nassociated technical and implementation risks are medium.30 \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n23. \nFinancial analysis. A financial internal rate of return of 17.0% was computed for the first \nbatch  of  subprojects  combined. 31 The  first  batch  of  subprojects  was  found  to  be  financially \nsound under various adverse scenarios, with the financial internal rates of return ranging from \n\n                                                \n30  Innovative Energy Efficiency and Emission Reduction Technologies (see list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n6.2% to 15.1%. Future subprojects will need to meet financial performance and creditworthiness \ncriteria for subborrowers acceptable to ADB (footnote 10).  \n \n24. \nEconomic analysis. An economic internal rate of return of 20.3% was computed for the \nfirst  batch  of  subprojects. 32 If  the  significant  environmental  benefits  from  the  incineration  of \nHFC-23 are taken into account and a carbon price at the low end of observed carbon prices on \nthe  PRC\u2019s  pilot  carbon  markets  is  assumed,  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  equal  to \n41.0%.  The  analysis  shows  that  HFC-23  destruction  in  subproject  2  is  highly  sensitive  to  the \nassumed  carbon  price.  The  project  remains  viable,  with  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of \n29.0% to 38.1%, under various sensitivity scenarios.   \n \nC. \n\nGovernance  \n\n25. \nFinancial  management  assessment.  The  selected  financial  intermediary,  CCB  is  the \nsecond  largest  commercial  bank  in  the  world  in  terms  of  asset  value  and  has  satisfactory \nfinancial management capability to accomplish the assigned tasks (Table 3). The integrity due \ndiligence  showed  a  strong  governance  system  in  place  at  CCB,  which  is  regularly  audited  by \nrelevant  authorities.  The  potential  risk  arising  from  its  association  with  ADB  is  low.  The \nassessment prepared for ChemChina, CHC, DSC, and Huatai found the financial management \nsystems in place to be adequate to ensure that loan funds are used for the intended purposes.33 \n \n26. \nProcurement  risk  assessment.  The  assessment  showed  that  CHC  has  satisfactory \nexperience in procuring contracts of up to $10 million equivalent, following domestic procedures. \nCHC  will  undertake  all  procurement  under  this  FIL  loan,  except  for  one  contract,  according  to \nthe  established  domestic  commercial  practices  and  procurement  procedures  of  ChemChina, \nwhich  are  aligned  with  the  procurement  laws  of  the  PRC  and  acceptable  to  ADB.  In  the \nprocurement  of  one  large  contract  for  the  supply  of  towers  in  the  amount  of  $34.26  million \nequivalent, CHC will comply with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time \nto  time)  and  use  international  competitive  bidding  procedures  and  ADB\u2019s  standard  bidding \ndocuments.  A  professional  procurement  agent  will  be  hired  for  project  implementation.  Loan \ndisbursement  procedures  have  been  prepared  to  ensure  that  subloan  disbursement  will  be \nlinked to the payment of eligible expenses.34 \n \n27. \nCorruption  prevention.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with ChemChina, CHC, Huatai, CGY, DSC, and CCB. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n28. \nThe project will have positive social impact by reducing GHG emissions, expediting the \nelimination of mercury use, and expediting the phaseout of mercury mining. It will thus help to \ncurb  climate  change  and  lessen  the  hazardous  health  effects  of  mobilizing  mercury  in  the \nenvironment. The project will be implemented in existing facilities, with social impacts confined \nto  the  boundary  of  the  industrial  plants.  Low-income  households  and  communities  will  not \ndirectly  benefit  through  poverty  reduction.  The  project  will  also  have  no  gender  elements: \ngender equity or the empowerment of women will not be directly promoted. \n                                                \n32  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Financial Management Assessment for the Financial Intermediary; Financial Management Assessment for Project \n\nEntities (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n34 Project Procurement Risk Assessment for Project Entities; Project Procurement Risk Assessment for Procurement \n\nAgent (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n29. \nEnvironment. The project is categorized as FI, and first batch subprojects are classified \nas  category  A  for  environment.  A  project  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and  due \ndiligence  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).35 The \nEIA  was  posted  on  the  ADB  website  on  22  May  2015.  Following  a  detailed  assessment,  both \nsubprojects were found to (i) exclude activities on ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list; and \n(ii) present  low  climate  change  risk,  since  climate  risks  are  already  incorporated  in  the \nengineering design of the existing facilities and new technologies financed under the project.36 \nThe environmental audit of the existing facilities revealed exemplary management commitment \non the part of CGY, as well as excellent practices in environment and occupational health and \nsafety management. DSC, while well managed, needs to further strengthen its environment and \noccupational  health  and  safety  management  and  practices.  Among  the  corrective  actions \nproposed for DSC in the audit report is the certification of these management systems. The EIA \nof  the  component  subprojects  showed  potential  adverse  impacts  to  be  limited  except  for \n(i) construction  noise  and  dust  during  construction,  (ii)  air  source  emissions  and  fugitive \nemissions,  and  (iii)  the  handling  of  chemicals  and  hazardous  materials  during  operation.  A \ncomprehensive  environmental  management  plan  will  enable  the  subproject  companies  to \nreduce  or  avoid  any  anticipated  impacts.  An  ESMS  will  be  developed  and  adopted  by \nChemChina,  CHC,  CCB,  and  Huatai  for  future  subprojects  under  the  project  to  (i) ensure  that \nfuture subproject selection is acceptable to ADB; and (ii) enhance effective environmental and \nsocial  management  practices,  as  explained  further  in  the  PAM.  Potential  future  subprojects \nclassified under category A for the environment will not be excluded.37 \n \n30. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples. The  project  is  categorized  as  FI. \nFirst batch subprojects will have no impact on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples \nand  ethnic  minorities  (category  C).  They  will  be  implemented  within  the  borders  of  existing \nindustrial facilities and will not entail the acquisition of new land for expansion. Potential future \nsubprojects will be screened in accordance with the ESMS, and those under category A or B for \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples will be excluded. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31. \nThere  are  no  outstanding major  risks. The  identified  risks  and mitigation measures  are \nsummarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  management  plan. \nThe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.38 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nPoor performance, cost overrun, or \nimplementation delay for scale-up \napplication of first-of-its-kind process \ntransformation at DSC  \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nExtensive pilot testing and multiple scale-up of pilots have proved the \nefficacy of the technology.a Third-party verification of test results has \nalso confirmed the soundness of the technology, and the chosen scale-\nup is within technically acceptable limits.
