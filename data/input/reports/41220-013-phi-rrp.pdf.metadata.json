With  particular \nindigenous  peoples  and  resource-poor \ncommunities,  the  project  will  reduce  and  reverse  degradation  of  watersheds  and  associated \nenvironmental services caused by forest denudation and unsustainable farming practices. It will \nalso  provide  incentives  to  local  communities,  local  government  units  (LGUs),  and  the \nDepartment  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources  (DENR)  for  improving  natural  resource \nmanagement by generating sufficient and tangible economic benefits. 3 \n\nfocus  on \n\nThe project has been designed as a sector loan4 to support the strategic priorities of the \n3. \nPhilippine  Development  Plan  (PDP)  and  the  DENR\u2019s  framework  plan  for  environment  and \nnatural  resource  management  in  four  representative  upper  river  basins  (URBs)  encompassing \n23  watersheds.5,6 The  project  will  promote  the  adoption  of  ecosystem-based  management  in \nthese  URBs;  support  the  rehabilitation,  restoration,  and  protection  of  degraded  forest  areas  in \nthe  component  watersheds;  and support  community-based livelihood  measures  in 1.13  million \nhectares  of  upland  areas  with  an  estimated  population  of  2.7  million.  Approximately  220,000 \nhousehold beneficiaries in 9 provinces are targeted. The project supports ADB\u2019s commitment to \nenvironmentally sustainable growth and inclusive economic growth under Strategy 2020, and is \nin line with ADB\u2019s operational emphasis on sound environmental management. 7  \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nThe  watersheds  of  the  URBs  comprise  an  estimated  45%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  land \n4. \narea, and are home to one in four Filipinos.8 Natural resources in URBs are the primary source \nfor domestic energy and the local production base. These forest ecosystems play a critical role \nin  economic  development  by  regulating  water  quantity  and  quality  for  sustaining  national \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory assistance.

The  seasonality  of \nproduction,  with  low  cropping  intensities  and  levels  of  diversification,  has  led  to  high \nunemployment (estimated at 7.1% in October 2010) and underemployment (18.5% in July 2010) \nfor  the  poor  (footnote  2).  Deforestation  has  also  rendered  many  poor  communities  more \nvulnerable to natural calamities such as typhoons, flash floods, and landslides.12 \n\n6. \nSiltation  of  rivers  and  lake  systems  in  Lake  Lanao  and  Upper  Bukidnon  URBs  has \ncaused losses in power output estimated at over 50%, with lost revenues for the National Power \nCorporation (NPC) totaling around $66 million annually.13 Siltation of coral reefs and destruction \nof mangroves has also reduced artisanal fish catches, a key source of income and protein for \npoor  coastal  communities.  Degradation  and  overexploitation  of  watersheds  is  a  major \ncontributor  to  increasing  poverty,  inequitable  access  to  resources  and  services,  and  loss  of \nlivelihood  among  upland  dwellers.  Poverty  incidence  in  the  project  sites  (2009)  ranges  from \n35.8%  in  Chico  to  48.3%  in  Wahig\u2013Inabanga,  significantly  higher  than  the  national  poverty \nincidence  of  26.5%  in  2009. 14  Indigenous  peoples  groups 15  and  other  ethnic  minorities \nconstitute around 74% of the population in headwaters of the river basins.16 \n\n7. \nPolicy  and  institutional  relevance.  The  project  fully  supports  the  Government  of  the \nPhilippines\u2019  poverty  reduction,  watershed  management,  biodiversity  conservation,  and  climate \nchange policy objectives. The project design and scope are directly aligned with the PDP\u2019s aim \nto  use  integrated  ecosystem  management  as  a  major  strategy  for  (i)  sustainably  utilizing \nresources in critical watersheds, (ii) sustainably managing forestlands and ancestral domains for \nenhanced  carbon  stock,  reduced  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  (iii)  adapting  to  different \nclimate change scenarios. \n\n8. \nIn  line  with  the  DENR's  program  mandate,  the  project  supports  current  institutional \nprograms  and  policy  directions:  (i)  Joint  Memorandum  Circular  Number  1,  Series  of  2010 \nbetween  the  Department  of  Agriculture  (DA),  the  Department  of  Agrarian  Reform,  and  the \nDENR adopts a convergence initiative to strengthen the development framework for sustainable \n\n                                                 \n9  \"Watershed integrity\" refers to a stable overall physical condition of the watershed (bedrock, landforms, soils, and \ndrainage ways) within which transfers of energy, matter, and especially water occur.

The  project  is  consistent  with  the  national  policy  of  devolving \nspecified  environmental  and  natural  resources  management  functions  and  responsibilities  to \nlocal  governments,  as  expressed  in  the  Republic  Act  7160  or  the  Local  Government  Code \n(1991),  the  recognition  of  indigenous  peoples  rights  to  their  ancestral  domains  (Republic  Act \n8371),  and  the  adoption  of  community-based  forest  management  as  the  main  strategy  for \nsustainable \n(Executive  Order  263).  The  project  will  address \ninstitutional/policy  gaps  at  the  national  and  local  levels  by:  (i)  reinforcing  existing  co-\nmanagement policies18 between DENR and LGU clusters as part of Comprehensive Land Use \nPlans  (CLUPs);  (ii)  establishing  LGU  ordinances  for  conservation  through  user  fees  and \ninvestment  agreements  over  LGU  managed  forest  lands;  and  (iii)  establishing  plow-back \nmechanisms  for  conservation  investments  in  protected  areas  and  ancestral  domains  from \ncreation  of  new  productive  assets,  private  sector  investments,  and  deploying  payment  for \nenvironmental services (PES).  \n\n10. \nExternal  support,  lessons  learned,  and  other  linked  projects. The project design is \nbased on more than 30 years of experience in watershed management in the Philippines, from \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\u2013IFAD  cofinanced  Highland  Agricultural  Development \nProject,  which  was  initiated  in  the  Cordillera  Administrative  Region  in  1986,  through  to  the \nCordillera  Highland  Agricultural  Resource  Management  Project 19 implemented  from  1997  to \n2004.  Lessons  learned  from  these  projects,  as  well  as  recent  experiences  from  the  Southern \nPhilippines  Irrigation  Sector  Project, 20 are  incorporated  in  the  project  design  to  address  the \nconflict  between  agricultural  production  and  natural  resource  protection  in  watersheds.  The \nintegrated  project  also  draws  on  implementation  lessons  from  the  ongoing  Integrated  Coastal \nResources  Management  Project21 and  the  Infrastructure  for  Rural  Productivity  Enhancement \nSector  Project22 to  avoid  delays  in  the  activity  schedule  and  allow  appropriate  lead  times  for \nLGU and community consultation and preparation.23 \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe  project  impact  will  be  improved  condition  of  watersheds  generating  livelihood \nbenefits in the four URBs. The outcome of the project will be increased rural household incomes \nand LGU revenues in selected watersheds in the four URBs. \n\n12. \nConsistent  with  the  sector  modality,  project  outcomes  will  be  influenced  through  policy \ndialogue to (i) clarify, rationalize, and delineate use rights of local communities and indigenous \n\n                                                 \n17 Mechanisms  currently  being  pursued  include  regional  convergence  of  business  zones,  linking  the  support  of  the \nthree agencies. The project will provide technical support to the DENR, the Department of Agriculture, and LGUs to \ndevelop investment packages for agroforestry and small-scale plantations in business zones. \n\n18 Such as  transfer of resource use rights to LGUs in production areas (DENR-DILG Memorandum Circular 2003-01) \n19 ADB.  1995.

LGU \nexperience  with  enterprise  management  will  be  adapted  to  manage  watershed  resources \nidentified for production.  \n\n13. \nThe  project  will  initiate  interventions  in  the  Lake  Lanao,  Upper  Bukidnon,  and  Wahig\u2013\nInabanga  URBs  that  will  contribute  to  reducing  nutrient  runoff  from  agricultural  lands  through \nimproving  farming  practices  to  reduce  siltation  and  discharge  of  harmful  pollutants  that \ncontribute  to  oxygen  depletion  in  coastal  waters  of  Iligan  Bay,  Macajalar  Bay,  and  the  Bohol \nSea. This \"ridge to reef\" approach will support activities under the Coral Triangle Initiative.24 \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n14. \nand intended beneficiaries. \n\nThe project outputs are consolidated based on extensive consultations with stakeholders \n\n15. \nOutput  1:  River  basin  and  watershed  management  and  investment  plans \nestablished.  Indicative  development  plans  (IDPs)  will  be  developed  for  the  four  URBs  to  be \nadopted  by  regional  development  councils  and/or  provincial  legislative  councils.  IDPs  will  be \nbased  on  land  capability  assessments  and  participatory  land  use  classification  to  identify \nappropriate management zones, and will be drawn up by the regional and provincial offices of \nthe  DENR  in  coordination  with  national  agencies  and  LGUs.  Watershed  management  plans \n(WMPs) will be prepared for the selected watersheds based on the IDPs. The WMPs will define \nand prioritize subprojects and establish a work program for implementation by LGU clusters and \nmunicipal development councils. The WMPs will take account of existing tenurial arrangements \nand  treat  ancestral  domains  as  management  subunits.25 A  geographical  information  system \n(GIS) based database for performance monitoring will be established. \n\n16. \nOutput 2: Smallholder and institutional investments in conservation increased and \nURB  productivity  enhanced  in  the  forestry,  agriculture  and  rural  sectors.  Subproject \ninvestments  will  be  undertaken  within  the  23  project  watersheds  based  on  outputs  from  river \nbasin-wide  planning  (output  1).  Interventions  for  watershed  restoration  and  rehabilitation \ncovering more than 325,590 ha will be implemented by the DENR to include community-based \nprotection,  reforestation  and/or  assisted  natural  regeneration,  production  forestry  including \ndemonstrations  on  agroforestry  and  commercial  plantations,  and  conservation  farming. \nLivelihood  improvement  investments  to  be  undertaken  by  municipal  LGUs  include  (i)  645 \nkilometers of rural access roads and foot trails; (ii) communal irrigation systems servicing 3,040 \nha; (iii) 275 units of potable community water facilities; (iv) a provincial trading and processing \ncenter supporting farming communities; and (v) seed funds for replication and/or expansion of \ntested and mature farming technologies. \n\n17. \nOutput  3:  River  basin  and  watershed  management  capacity  and  related \ngovernance  mechanisms  strengthened.  The  project  will  (i)  assist  LGUs  to  establish \noperational  clusters  at  watershed  and  river  basin  levels;  (ii)  train  LGUs  and  local  community \norganizations  on  land  resource  assessments,  land  use  planning,  and  watershed  management \nand  monitoring;  (iii)  provide  support  for  technical  extension-information,  education  and \ncommunication;  (iv)  capacitate  LGUs  in  carbon  stock  enhancement  and  land  management \npractices  to  reduce  carbon  dioxide  emissions  and  land-based  pollution,  and  (v)  support  the \nestablishment of community watershed protection brigades. \n\n                                                 \n24 Covering nearly 5.7 million square kilometers of ocean around six countries (i.e., Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New \nGuinea, the Philippines, Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste), the Coral Triangle is regarded as the \u201cAmazon of the \nSeas.\u201d The Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) on Coral Reef\u2019s, Fisheries, and Food Security was launched in 2007 as a \nsix-country multilateral partnership to address the threats facing the coastal and marine resources in the CTI.  \n\n25 As defined in the Indigenous Peoples Right Act, 1997. \n\n\f5 \n\n \n\nOutput  4:  Project  management  and  support  services  delivered.  The  project  will \n18. \nsupport  the  establishment  of  a  national  project  coordination  office  (NPCO),  regional  project \ncoordinating  offices  (RPCO),  provincial  project  management  offices  (PPMO)  and  watershed \nmanagement  and  project  coordination  offices  (WMPCO)  at  the  DENR.  The  NPCO  will  (i) \ncoordinate  consultant  recruitment  and  supervision;  (ii)  conduct  procurement  of  materials, \nequipment, and vehicles during project implementation; (iii) operationalize the project monitoring \nand  evaluation  system;  (iv)  mobilize  resources  for  capacity  building  of  DENR\u2019s  regional  and \nprovincial  units  and  the  LGUs;  (v)  consolidate  the  annual program  and  budgets  received  from \nprovincial and regional levels; and (vi) conduct gender and safeguard monitoring and reporting. \n\n19. \nSpecial  features:  Climate  Change  Fund  and  Global  Environment  Facility.  The \nproject,  as  supplemented  by  grants,  will  mainstream  climate  change  mitigation  through \ninvestments  for  (i)  establishing  smallholder-based  biomass  energy  forest  demonstration  plots \nwith  private  equity  contribution  in  upper  Bukidnon,  (ii)  establishing  and  verifying  reduced \nemissions  from  deforestation  and  forest  degradation  and  conservation  and  enhancement  of \ncarbon  stocks  (REDD+)  through  demonstration  activities,  and  (iii)  implementing  appropriate \nclimate change adaptation measures in upland production systems. Through GEF, biodiversity \nconservation  will  be  mainstreamed  in  watersheds  through  application  of  a  community-based \nbiodiversity corridor approach for conservation of remaining mossy forest stands in the Chico\u2013\nAgno\u2013Magat River basins triboundary headwaters area of the Cordillera. PES agreements will \nbe  developed  between  indigenous  people\u2019s  organizations  and  downstream  ecosystem-service \nbeneficiaries,  initially  in  the  triboundary  area  between  three  indigenous  people\u2019s  organization \nand the NPC.26,27  \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n20. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $154.13  million,  including  contingencies,  taxes,  and \nduties. The investment plan is in Table 1. Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and \ndetailed cost estimates by financier are provided in the project administration manual (PAM).28 \n\n21. \nThe financing plan is in Table 2. The government, through the DENR, has requested a \nloan of $100 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. \nThe loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an annual interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility,29 a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and  other  such  terms  and  conditions  set \nforth in the draft financing agreement. Financial charges and interest during implementation will \nbe capitalized. \n\nIFAD will provide a $20 million loan (approximately equivalent to SDR13,250,000) with a \n22. \nterm  of  20  years  and  a  grace  period  of  5  years.  The  IFAD  loan  will  carry  an  interest  rate \nequivalent  to  50%  of  the  reference  rate 30  for  intermediate  term  loans  for  middle-income \ncountries.  The  IFAD  loan  will  be  provided  on  a  parallel  basis  and  partially  administered  by \n\n                                                 \n26 Under  the  Electric  Power  Industry  Reform  Act  of  2001,  the  NPC  is  mandated  to  administer  an  environmental \ncharge  equivalent  to  P0.0025/kWh,  intended  to  be  used  solely  for  rehabilitating  and  managing  NPC-managed \nwatersheds. \n\n27 Revolving funds to be established under the project will ensure that sufficient operational budgets are available for \npost-project sustainability. Traditional forest regeneration practices like \u201cmuyong\u201d and \u201cpinugo\u201d will be promoted. \n\n28 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 The interest includes maturity premium of 0.10%. This is the based on the above loan terms and the government\u2019s \n\nchoice of repayment option and dates.  \n\n30 IFAD resets its annual reference interest rate each semester: on the first business day of January and on the first \nbusiness day of July. The interest rate is variable every 6 months, based on a special drawing rights LIBOR, plus a \nvariable  spread  applied  by  IFAD  (a  weighted  average  of  the  spreads  applied  by  the  International  Bank  for \nReconstruction  and  Development  to  its  variable  rate  loans  for  the  same  semester).  For  the  period  1  January\u201330 \nJune 2012, the annual interest rate for the loans on intermediate terms is 0.69%. \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\nADB.31 IFAD funds are expected to finance participatory watershed management planning in the \nLake  Lanao  and  Upper  Bukidnon  River  basins;  all  other  project  activities  within  selected \nwatersheds  in  the  Upper  Bukidnon  River  Basin  (except  for  sustainable  forest  management, \nagroforestry, and commercial forest plantations); and project consultants at the NPCO, RPCOs, \nand PPMOs. \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \n\n1. \n2. \n \n\nAmounta\n\n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n \n\nOutput 1: River basin and watershed planning \nOutput 2: Smallholder and institutional investments \nOutput 3: Capacity building \nOutput 4: Project management and support services \nSubtotal (A) \n\n \nItem \nA.

The  GEF  grant  will  be  used  to  provide  substantial  support  for  the \npreparation  of  river  basin  and  watershed  management  plans  (output  1),  investment  in \nwatershed  conservation  and  management  (output  2),  capacity  building  (output  3),  and  project \nperformance   monitoring and evaluation (output 4). ADB\u2019s CCF32 will provide $1.41 million. The \nCCF  grant  will  support  forest  conservation  and  watershed  management,  special  studies  and \ncapacity building on climate change. \n\nThe  government  will  provide  funding  equivalent  to  $15.31  million  through  taxes  and \n24. \nduties ($7.61 million) and project staff, facilities, management, and other recurrent costs ($7.70 \nmillion);  local  government  units  will  provide  $8.49  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  ($0.92 \nmillion), in equity and in-kind contribution; and beneficiaries will provide a $6.42 million in-kind \ncontribution.  \n                                                 \n31 ADB  will  perform  a  limited  range  of  services  for  IFAD  including  procurement,  consultant  recruitment  and \ndisbursement supervision, instructing IFAD to disburse directly to the payees identified by the executing agency. \n\n32 Established by ADB. \n\n\f7 \n\n \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n25. \nThe implementation period is 7 years to allow for the longer commitment recommended \nfor NRM projects. Within each of the URBs, there will be a phased approach to work from one \nwatershed to the next, starting with the 4 priority subproject watersheds, until all the URBs are \ncovered. As the executing agency, DENR will assume full responsibility in project administration \nand  management.  An  interagency  National  Project  Steering  Committee  (NPSC)  will  be \nestablished to provide policy guidance chaired by a DENR undersecretary. The National Project \nCoordination  Office  (NPCO)  will  be  established  at  the  DENR  central  office  with  the  Forest \nManagement Bureau. The Municipal Development Fund Office will administer the funds for rural \ninfrastructure improvements to be implemented by the municipal LGUs except for those covered \nby  the  Cordillera  Highland  Agricultural  Resource  Management  project  areas  which  will  be \nadministered by the Department of Agriculture.

Beneficiaries will benefit from increased incomes generated from \nproviding  rural  infrastructure,  sustainable  forestry  and  agricultural  activities,  and  extension \nservices  initiated  and  supported  by  the  project.  The  project  is  expected  to  yield  substantial \nbenefits: (i) incremental benefits from increased crop yields and productivity through investment \nin  improved  rural  accessibility  and  irrigation,  extension  services,  sustainable  forestry,  and \nagricultural diversification activities; (ii) incremental employment creation estimated at  270,000 \nperson-months  of  wage-generating  opportunities  for  households  and  local  communities  from \nproposed  investments;  (iii)  households  benefiting  from  safe  drinking  water,  hence  avoiding \nsignificant  water-related  diseases  and  health-care-related  costs;  (iv)  improved  water  quality \nwithin  URBs  with  reduced  operating  and  delivery  costs,  bringing  about  significant  benefit  for \npublic  utilities,  household  enterprises,  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  and  downstream \nfarmers  that  utilize  water  for  a  variety  of  purposes;  (v)  increased  economic  activity,  improved \nservice  delivery,  and  greater  security  from  the  adverse  impacts  of  climate  change and  natural \ndisasters  benefiting  the  population  within  URBs  and  81  LGUs,  the  majority  of  which  are \ncategorized  as  low-income  municipalities;  (vi)  reduced  carbon  dioxide  emissions  and  better \nprotection and conservation of biodiversity will benefit the population in all URBs and LGUs; (vii) \nimproved  ecosystem  services  such  as  climate  regulation,  watershed  protection,  water  quality \nregulation,  soil  erosion  prevention,  and  nutrition  retention  realized  by  improved  forest \necosystems  in  the  four  URBs;  and  (viii)  avoided  loss  of  forest  cover,  critical  in  the  URBs \nservicing downstream infrastructure.  \n\n Economic  analysis  was  conducted \n\n27. \nincluding  (i) \nrehabilitation  and  improvement  of  small-scale  communal  irrigation  systems,  (ii)  rehabilitation \nand improvement of rural access roads, (iii) establishment of communal drinking water supply, \n(iv) establishment of agroforestry plantations, and (v) establishment of plantation forestry. Base-\ncase  economic  internal  rates  of  return  for  the  five  sample  investments  are  18.0%,  38%,  34%, \n28%,  and  43.0%  respectively,  demonstrating  the  viability  of  the  packaged  subproject \ninvestments.33 \n\nfive  sample \n\ninvestments, \n\nfor \n\nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n28. \nProcurement  of  civil  works  and  goods  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  while  engagement  of \nconsultants  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from \ntime  to  time).  Land  use  assessment  planning,  zoning,  delineation,  and  demarcation  will  be \nconducted  under  the  direct  supervision  of  the  DENR  and  using  DENR  guidelines.  Force \naccount procedures will be used for procurement of labor for demarcation and civil works since \nthe  works  are  small  in  scale  and  in  remote  locations.  These  will  be  undertaken  by  the  DENR \nand/or  the  LGUs  which  have  the  capacity  to  undertake  such  works.  All  civil  works  contracts \nexceeding $100,000 and less than $5,000,000 will be procured through the national competitive \nbidding  procedure  (footnote  28).  Community  participation  will  be  used  for  forest  protection, \nreforestation, assisted natural regeneration, and commercial and agroforestry demonstrations to \nensure sustained benefits.  The NPCO shall ensure that all accounts at the DENR-CO and the \nMDFO are consolidated and audited by the Commission on Audit or other auditors acceptable \nto  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  government  and  the  DENR.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 28). \n\n                                                 \n33 Economic and financial analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\n \n\nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n29. \nThe  project  targets  about  220,000  household  beneficiaries,  the  majority  of  which  are \nvulnerable  and  marginalized.  It  is  recognized  that  the  targeted  local  groups  have  limited \ninfluence  on  decision  making.  A  consolidated  consultation  and  participation  plan,  resettlement \nframework, indigenous peoples planning framework (IPPF), and gender action plan have been \nprepared  to  ensure  that  concerns  of  vulnerable  sectors  are  addressed  and  benefits  equitably \ndistributed.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  as  it  is  designed  to \nbenefit  women  by  increasing  their  participation  and  decision  making  in  natural  resource \nmanagement at the community and LGU levels and providing improved access to services. \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment  (category  B).  Project  interventions  in  reforestation  and  assisted  natural \n30. \nregeneration  and  forest  protection,  and  demonstrations  in  commercial  tree  plantations  and \nagroforestry, will generate positive environmental impacts. These benefits outweigh the minimal \nand  temporary  adverse  impacts,  which  are  easily  mitigated  by  adopting  the  environmental \nmonitoring  and  management  plan  and  observing  additional  environmental  safeguards,  as \noutlined  in  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  covering  the  four \nsummary initial environmental examinations of the sample subprojects, which were prepared to \ncomply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).34 The  EARF  will  be  posted  on  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite upon Board approval of the Project. \n\n31. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  Land  use  zoning  may  result  in  restricted \naccess  to  privately  held  ancestral  and/or  communal  properties,  particularly  for  indigenous \npeoples, potentially impacting their sources of food and livelihood. A resettlement framework to \nguide the preparation of resettlement plans for project-affected people has been prepared and \nendorsed  by  the  government,  and  is  consistent  with  relevant  national  laws  and  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement.35 \n\nIndigenous peoples (category A). An estimated 73.5% of household beneficiaries are \n32. \nindigenous  peoples  and/or  ethnic  minorities.  To  guide  the  preparation  of  indigenous  peoples \nplans, an Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF) has been prepared, consistent with \nnational  laws  and  legal  procedures  and  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policy  on  indigenous  peoples.  The \nIPPF  has  been  endorsed  by  the  government. 36 Ethnic  minorities  such  as  the  Maranaos  of \nMuslim  Mindanao  were  consulted,  and  participation  and  benefit-sharing  arrangements  are  in \nline with the specific provincial and municipal LGU structures and the Autonomous Region for \nMuslim Mindanao Organic Act. \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33.
