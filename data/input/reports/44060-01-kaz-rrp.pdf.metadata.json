I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund (Damu), \nguaranteed by the Republic of Kazakhstan, for the Small and Medium Enterprise Investment \nProgram. The MFF is proposed to help Damu\u2014through participating financial institutions (PFIs)\u2013\naddress the unmet demand for longer-term, fixed-rate, local currency denominated credit by small \nand medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),1 and thereby address a key constraint to the development \nof SMEs.  \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n2.  Limited small and medium-sized enterprises\u2019 contribution to gross domestic product. \nThe SME sector, which is primarily focused on trade (37%) and services (30%), has not kept pace \nwith  general  developments  in  the  economy  (Table  1).2 SMEs\u2019  contribution  to  gross  domestic \nproduct decreased from 18% in 2005 to 14% in 2009, while the contribution of large enterprises \n(which are principally involved in the oil and minerals sector) continues to grow. Kazakhstan\u2019s \nhighly concentrated economy and dependence on oil exports poses a potential threat to economic \ngrowth given the volatility of the international oil markets. During the global financial crisis, oil \nprices plummeted from $150 per barrel to $35 per barrel, resulting in a severe economic impact. To \nsupport sustained economic growth, economic diversification\u2014including a larger role for SMEs\u2014is \na key government priority.3  \n  \nTable 1: Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Contribution to Gross Domestic Product (%) \n% Share   2005  2006  2007  2008  2009 \nSMEs  18.1  17.1  17.6  12.9  14.2 \n1.

Decreasing small and medium-sized enterprises\u2019 access to finance. Prior to 2002, \ncommercial banks were reluctant to lend to SMEs, which are usually considered high-risk based on \nlack  of  collateral  and  unreliable  financial  statements.  Most  SME  investment  was  financed by \ninternal  resources.  Starting  in  2002,  based  on  access  to  external  credit  markets,  Kazakh \ncommercial banks dramatically increased their lending to the SME sector.4 However, starting in \nmid-2007, access to the international interbank and bond markets became difficult and ended in \nlate 2008 with the onset of the global financial crisis. This severely impacted the liquidity of Kazakh \nbanks, resulted in a decline in the availability of domestic credit, and created a debt crisis that \nexposed deep-seated problems within the Kazakh banking sector. The proportion of nonperforming \n                                                 \n1  The Law on Private Entrepreneurship (31 January 2006) defines small enterprises as enterprises with no more than 50 \nemployees and not more than $500,000 in average annual assets, and medium-sized enterprises as enterprises with \nnot more than 250 employees or not more than $3 million average annual net assets.  \n2  Framework Financing Agreement and Periodic Financing Request for Tranche 1 (Appendix 2). \n3  Government  of  Kazakhstan.  2010.  Business  Roadmap  2020.  Astana;  Government  of  Kazakhstan.  2010.  The \nAccelerated Industrial-Innovative Development (AIID) of Kazakhstan 2010\u20132015. Astana. \n4  Kazakh banks relied on short-term debt from the international interbank market to fund their growth since the domestic \ndeposit base is small (30% of gross domestic product). While deposits are growing, this is due largely to inflows from \npublic sector entities.  ", "2    \nloans grew to about 30% from only 3% in 2007. Several banks defaulted on their borrowings and \nhad to restructure their debts. Lending to SMEs declined from a high of $5.3 billion during the \nsecond quarter of 2007 to $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2009. Under the Kazakhstan Anti-Crisis \nPlan,  the  Government  of  Kazakhstan  introduced  measures  to  strengthen  the  banking  sector, \nincluding providing subsidized credit lines to selected banks for SME lending.5  \n \n4.  Damu, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Samruk-Kazyna National Wealth Fund (100% \nowned  by  the  government)  implements  these  credit  lines.  This  support,  along  with  other \ngovernment actions, led to significantly increased liquidity in the system.6 Nevertheless, SMEs\u2019 \naccess to longer-term credit for investment purposes is limited. The current estimated demand for \nsuch financing is around $2.8 billion, and will increase as the economy improves (footnote 2). \n5.  Government  measures  to  develop  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises.  The \ngovernment recognizes that a prosperous SME sector is key for the country\u2019s long-term economic \ngrowth. The sector is a major creator of employment and innovation, and is traditionally more \nresponsive and adaptable than are larger enterprises.7 A number of government initiatives have \nbeen undertaken in recent years to address the barriers faced by SMEs. State programs including \nthe Business Roadmap 2020 (footnote 3) provide the general policy framework. The goal is to \ndiversify the production base and give prominence to development of the SME sector, in particular \nits expansion and diversification. In turn, developing the SME sector plays an important role in \nreducing poverty by generating income and employment.  \n \n6.  Damu, which was established by the government in 1997 to stimulate the development of \nsmall business enterprises and ensure better use of public funds allocated to these enterprises, \nplays an important role in SME development by implementing the government\u2019s access to credit \nprograms for SMEs. Over the years, Damu\u2019s range of programs has evolved from direct lending to \nindirect lending through banks. From 1997 through 2009, Damu directly financed 2,878 small \nbusiness projects in the amount of T33.3 billion (2% of all loans extended to small businesses in \nKazakhstan). Damu\u2019s financial programs for SMEs are now delivered mostly through subsidized \nloans to selected partner banks, which are used to fund onlending to SMEs.  \n \n7.  In recognition of the increasing demand for SME finance and decreasing availability based \non current market conditions,8 the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (MOE), which \noversees SME development, and Damu, in consultation with key stakeholders, adopted a results-\nbased SME Access to Finance Action Plan, 2010\u20132015. The plan seeks to ensure that SMEs have \nsustainable access to necessary short-term working capital and medium-term finance through a \n$3 billion investment program. It also includes a policy framework that addresses constraints to \nsuch access as well as sets forth key guiding principles (footnote 2). \n \n8.  Asian Development Bank (ADB) support for small and medium-sized enterprises. \nSince 2006, ADB has been supporting SME development through direct loans and partial credit \n                                                 \n5  The government provided $1.9 billion in subsidized credit to 16 banks to be used for restructuring existing SMEs loans \nor for making new loans to SMEs. \n6  Short-term liquidity in the system is currently estimated at $12.5 billion and short-term deposit rates are less than 1% \nper annum. \n7  Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance: Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Finance and Leasing (Appendix 2). \n8  Kazakhstan has an underdeveloped deposit market. The average tenor of deposits is less than a year and banks have \ndifficulties raising medium- to long-term capital at desirable rates. This has resulted in a deficiency of medium- to long-\nterm credit to banks\u2019 borrowers, especially SME borrowers. The global financial crisis exacerbated this. Prior to the \ncrisis, banks\u2019 external debts were mostly US dollar-denominated. The currency exposure was passed on to SMEs, \nmost of which lacked foreign currency earnings and the ability to hedge this exposure. During the crisis, the US dollar \nappreciated by more than 20% against the tenge, resulting in a heavy burden on SMEs.  Many SMEs were unable to \nservice their US dollar debt and had to file for bankruptcy. In addition, most SMEs have insufficient retained earnings to \nexpand their businesses, modernize, or upgrade key assets using their own funds. Working capital is also insufficient. ", "                                                                                                                            3\nguarantees to four banks.9  However, as a result of the financial crisis, two of these banks (Alliance \nBank [ALB] and BTA Bank) declared a moratorium on their principal payments and requested \nrestructuring of outstanding debt. The restructuring of ALB has been completed, while that of BTA \nBank is expected to be finished later this year.10 ADB is exploring future nonsovereign support and \nnew secured lending products combined with tighter loan portfolio monitoring to address potential \nrisks.  \n \n9.  Innovative program design.  Because of the poor health of the banking sector, it is difficult \nfor ADB to provide traditional nonsovereign credit line and guarantee operations to support SMEs \nin Kazakhstan. ADB, however, remains committed to providing such support. For example, ADB\u2019s \n2009 Countercyclical Support Program11 helped the government to fund post-crisis SME credit \nsupport operations.12 At the request of the government, ADB looked at a number of options to \nprovide  continued  support  over  the  medium  term  through  its  sovereign  operations.  The \ngovernment requested flexibility in lending products as the health of the finance sector improves, \nand asked that these products help to mitigate currency, interest, and tenor mismatch issues. \nDamu also requested assistance in improving its efficiency and effectiveness to enable it to raise \nexternal financing over the longer term.  \n \n10.  In  response,  ADB  developed  the  investment  program,  which  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \noverall strategy for Kazakhstan and reflects lessons learned. The investment program is designed \nas an MFF, under which a series of local currency loans and other financing products will be \nprovided over the medium term. The MFF enables flexibility as it will allow ADB to provide different \nforms of support (direct loans or guarantees) to Damu to help it fund its lending to PFIs. The MFF \nalso enables ADB to enter into a multiyear partnership with Damu (and possible cofinancing \npartners) while creating stability and credibility at the level of the financing plan. To reflect lessons \nlearned, the investment program envisions a series of medium-term, fixed-rate, local currency \nloans to Damu that will be used to fund back-to-back subloans to PFIs for onlending to SMEs. By \nproviding such loans, ADB will directly address currency, interest rate, and tenor mismatch risks. \nExperience has shown that these financial risks have been a significant cause of stress for SMEs \nand their banks.  \n \n11.  For the tranche 1 loan, ADB will raise local currency through cross-currency swaps with \ninternational  bank  counterparties.  ADB  has  been  able  to  leverage  its  relationships  with \ninternational banks and utilize its AAA rating to extend the tenor and lower the pricing of cross-\ncurrency swaps. For subsequent tranches, ADB will work with MOE and Damu on the issuance of \nlocal currency bonds (LCBs) by ADB or, with an ADB guarantee, by Damu.13 Issuance of LCBs will \nhelp develop the local capital market by providing local investors with the opportunity to diversify \ntheir investment portfolios; introduce international best practice standards; help develop a local \ncorporate bond yield curve and establish pricing benchmarks for other issuers; and advance the \nprocess of mobilizing and channeling domestic savings into longer-term investments.  \n \n12.  Donor coordination. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) \nactively supports SMEs in Kazakhstan. EBRD programs fund international advisers who provide \n                                                 \n9  ADB loans and guarantees without sovereign guarantee for SME lending have been provided to Alliance Bank (2006, \n$100 million partial credit guarantee and $50 million loan, the latter of which was recently restructured); Bank \nCenterCredit (2007, T6 billion loan funded by a private placement of a tenge-linked offshore bond); BTA Bank (2006, \n$75 million loan that was recently restructured); and Kazkommertsbank (2007, $100 million partial credit guarantee).  \n10 Development Coordination, footnote 2 (Appendix 2). \n11 ADB. 2009.

However, MOE requested ADB to \ndefer the issuance of LCBs until the second tranche.  \n ", "4    \ncapacity building and training for SMEs and support to rural SMEs to improve their operations, \nenter new markets, and gain access to financing. The United States Agency for International \nDevelopment has supported programs that have provided extensive training on business and \nconsulting essentials to mostly start-up entrepreneurs and nongovernment organization business \nservice providers. EBRD has extended several credit lines to commercial banks to fund lending to \nSMEs.14 Their  projects  are  sometimes  supported  by  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  help  banks \nintroduce a credit scoring methodology and improve their SME lending policies. The World Bank \nhas provided Kazakhstan with the Second Agricultural Post-Privatization Project ($96.1 million), \nwhich has a component for promoting sustainable rural microfinance. The International Finance \nCorporation promotes SME development through its debt and equity investments in banks that \nprovide loans to SMEs.15 ADB coordinated closely with other development partners in preparing \nthe investment program and MFF. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  Impact. The investment program and the MFF will promote sustained job creation and \neconomic growth. The design and monitoring framework is attached as Appendix 1.  \n \n14.  Outcome. The investment program and MFF will help ensure that viable SME borrowers \nhave increased access to medium-term credit on a sustainable basis (Appendix 1). \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  The investment program and MFF include three outputs:  \n \n(i)   medium-term financing for viable SMEs for expansion and modernization, \n(ii)   improved effectiveness and efficiency of Damu, and \n(iii)  improved financial sector outreach with a focus on SMEs controlled by women \n(women entrepreneurs). \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plan \n16.  Investment program. The overall investment program of $2.9 billion is designed to help \naddress the financing needs of SMEs over the medium term (Table 2). The investment program is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s latest country strategy for Kazakhstan, which supports sustainable economic \ngrowth through private sector development, including support for SME development.16 Loans under \nthe proposed MFF will help meet the growing demand by SMEs for medium-term, local currency \ncredit and will finance subprojects for the production of and trade in goods and services for both \ninvestment and working capital purposes.  \n \nTable 2: Investment Program, 2010\u20132015 \n  Amount ($) Equivalent in \nItem  Local Currency \n1.

Damu has requested an MFF of the local currency equivalent of $500 \nmillion to help finance part of the investment program (Table 3). The MFF will be structured into \nthree or four tranches, all of which will be sovereign guaranteed. The first tranche amounts to the \nlocal currency equivalent of $150 million. Tranche 2 is estimated at $150 million, local currency \nequivalent. Tranches 3 and 4 are estimated at $100 million, local currency equivalent. Financing \nunder tranches 2, 3, and 4 may vary depending on the demand for market-based credit by viable \nSMEs  as  market  conditions  improve;  the  availability  of  external  credit  for  Kazakh  financial \ninstitutions; and the interest of such institutions in participating in the facility. Financing will also \ndepend on the availability of ADB resources; it is subject to Damu\u2019s submission of related periodic \nfinancing requests, execution of the related loan agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of \nconditions and undertakings set forth in the framework financing agreement. \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan for Output One of the Investment Program, 2010\u20132015 \nTotal ($ million) \nSource  Local Currency  Share (%) of Total \nEquivalent \nADBa  500  18 \nOther sources of financing not administered by ADB (estimated \n100  4 \ncofinancing based on estimated SME demand and availability) \nOther international financial institutions  400  14 \nGovernment resourcesb  800  28 \nPrivate financial institutionsc  1,000  36 \n  Total  2,800  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, SME = small and medium-sized enterprises. \na  Lent to Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund for onlending to participating financing institutions, and then by \nparticipating financing institutions to SMEs. \nb  Through subsidized lending program to enterprises engaged in priority sectors. \nc  Represents funding coming from short-term and other deposits and equity.   \nSource: Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund estimates. \n \n18.  The tranche 1 loan will be financed from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and guaranteed \nby the Republic of Kazakhstan. The loan will be denominated in local currency (tenge) and will \nhave a term up to 7 years.17 The withdrawal and repayment schedule will match that of the \nsubloans made by Damu to PFIs.  The interest rate charged will be the sum of ADB\u2019s cost of \nraising back-to-back, fixed rate tenge wholesale funding through the international cross-currency \nswap markets18 and the contractual spread for a sovereign guaranteed loan. Damu will make \nsubloans to PFIs that meet the selection criteria agreed to by ADB.19 Damu will add a margin of up \nto  1.00%  per  annum  to  cover  its  administrative  costs,  and  a  guarantee  fee  payable  to  the \ngovernment for the sovereign guarantee. Each PFI will use its subloan to fund market-based, fixed-\nrate tenge loans, leases, and other forms of credit20 to SMEs for investment (acquisition of fixed \nassets), working capital and/or other purposes pursuant to a newly created Damu Market-Based \n                                                 \n17 Framework Financing Agreement and Periodic Financing Request for Tranche 1 (Appendix 2) have been negotiated. \nTheir signing by the government is being delayed due to the need on the part of the government to complete \nintergovernmental procedures and to obtain requisite signing authorizations. Signing is expected after the Board \napproval date. \n18 Or from such other markets as ADB may need to tap into to raise effective fixed-rate tenge at the time of a loan \nwithdrawal because of an unforeseen disruption in the international cross-currency swap market or other similar event.  \n19 Para. 24 and Financial Analysis (Appendix 2). \n20 Since Damu is not taking the credit risk of the SME borrowers, PFIs will independently determine the creditworthiness \nof the SMEs and ascertain the commercial terms and conditions of loans consistent with international best practices for \nlending to SMEs. \n ", "6    \nSME Loan Program.21 Subprojects will be required to comply with Kazakh labor, environmental, \nhealth, safety, and social laws and regulations, as well as ADB\u2019s safeguards policies (ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement [2009, Chapter D, para. 29]). After approval of the proposed MFF by \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors, other development partners and commercial lenders may complement \nADB\u2019s financing to assist Kazakhstan to develop its SME sector over the medium term through \ncofinancing to be administered by ADB. The amounts of the cofinancing so administered by ADB \nwill be deducted from the total MFF amount approved by the Board. Such cofinancing may be \nprovided as grants, loans, guarantees, or through other cofinancing products, and may take the \nform of joint or parallel financing. ADB\u2019s administration of such cofinancing from time to time will be \nreported to the Board for information annually.22 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  Damu will be the executing agency for the MFF. Implementing agencies will be Damu and \nthe PFIs. Damu has a clear mandate to facilitate greater access to credit by SMEs and has \ndemonstrated  its  capacity  to  monitor  and  supervise  loans  to  banks  for  onlending  to  SMEs \n(footnote 12). Damu has 16 regional offices (one in each oblast) and good outreach to potential \nSME borrowers. Damu will designate a project management team, headed by a project director, \nwho will report to the Damu chairperson. The implementation arrangements are summarized in \nTable 4 and described in more detail in the facility administration manual (FAM).23  \n \nTable 4:  Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nSMEs\u2019 access to finance action plan  Damu in coordination with the Ministry of Economic \nDevelopment and Trade and other key stakeholders \nProgram management  Damu, through a program management team, and PFIs \nLoan disbursement  Damu and PFIs.

Since many SMEs will be importing goods, works, and consulting services from or are \nengaged in trade (para. 2) with both ADB and non-ADB member countries, including the Russian \nFederation, a request for Board approval is being made pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the Agreement \nEstablishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter), to approve procurement from non-ADB \nmember countries in appropriate circumstances.24 Board approval on this issue is being requested \nwith  respect  to  procurement  by  SME  borrowers  using  loan  proceeds  under  the  investment \n                                                 \n21 PFIs will undertake on a best efforts basis that (i) funds received be used only to provide credit to qualifying SMEs \nwithin 12 months of receiving the funds; (ii) at least 50% of the subloan proceeds be used for investment purposes; \nand (iii) at least 40% of the funds be lent to SMEs located outside of the cities of Almaty and Astana. No SME or group \nof related SMEs may borrow more than $3 million under the program. \n22 ADB. 2008. Mainstreaming the Multitranche Financing Facility.

Manila (Article 14[ix]) provides: \u201cThe proceeds of \nany loan, investment or other financing undertaken in the ordinary operations of the Bank or with Special Funds \nestablished by the Bank pursuant to paragraph 1(i) of Article 19, shall be used only for procurement of goods and \nservices produced in member countries, except in any case in which the Board of Directors, by a vote of Directors \nrepresenting not less than two thirds of the total voting power of the members, determines to permit procurement in a \nnon-member country or of goods and services produced in a non-member country in special circumstances making \nsuch procurement appropriate, as in the case of a non-member country in which a significant amount of financing has \nbeen provided  to the Bank.\u201d  ", "                                                                                                                            7\nprogram.  This  request  reflects  the  market-based  nature  of  the  investment  program,  trade \nagreements, and SME demand and procurement history.   \n \n21.  To strengthen Damu\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness in supporting SMEs, advisory TA is \nproposed for tranche 1. The TA will help Damu to implement and roll out its new market-based \nSME lending program. The TA cost is estimated at $720,000, of which ADB will finance $650,000 \nas a grant from its Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). Damu will provide the balance of \n$70,000  through  in-kind  contributions.  ADB  will  engage  consultants  in  accordance  with  the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) to be contracted either \nas  individual  consultants  or  through  a  firm  using  the  biodata  technical  proposal.  The  TA  is \nexpected to commence in the first quarter of 2011 and be completed by the second quarter of \n2012. Implementation of the TA is detailed in the FAM. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n22.  ADB\u2019s initial due diligence indicates that the MFF and the tranche 1 loan project are \nfinancially viable, economically sustainable, socially desirable, and legally permissible subject to \ncompliance with the following criteria. \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n23.  Due diligence was performed on Damu and three banks (ALB, Bank CenterCredit, and \nKazkommertsbank [KKB])25 that expressed interest in participating in Damu\u2019s new market-based \nSME lending program funded by the tranche 1 loan. Although due diligence revealed that two of \nthe banks did not meet all (but only most) of the eligibility criteria (Table 5) set forth in para. 8 of \nOperations Manual Section D6, they may participate in tranche 1 based on their agreement to \nimplement measures to meet these criteria under time-bound action plans acceptable to ADB.26 \n \n24.  Under the agreed selection criteria with Damu, to participate in tranche 1, each financial \ninstitution must (i) comply with capital adequacy requirements and other prudential requirements \nestablished by the Agency for Regulation of Financial Markets or have an agreed action plan to \nbecome fully compliant; (ii) have been profitable for their most recently completed fiscal year, or \nhave an agreed action plan to achieve profitability; (iii) have a nonperforming loan ratio of less than \n10% or have an agreed action plan to reduce it to that level; (iv) have a credit rating of at least B\u2013 \nby a credit rating agency or equivalent rating acceptable to ADB; (v) have corporate, financial, and \nmanagement practices acceptable to ADB; and (vi) have satisfactorily completed ADB\u2019s integrity \ndue diligence checklists. \n \nTable 5: Analysis of Banks\u2019 Compliance with Selection Criteria \n  Capital  Prudential    NPL   Credit  C, F, and M  Integrity Due \nBank  Adequacy  Limits  Profitability  Rating  Practices  Diligence \n<10% \nALB  Yes (AP)  No (AP)  No  No (~80%)  B-/B3/B-  Acceptable  Satisfactory \nBCC  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  B/Ba3/BBB-  Acceptable  Satisfactory \nKKB  Yes  Yes  Yes  No (~20%)  B-/B/Ba3  Acceptable  Satisfactory \nALB = Alliance Bank; AP = action plan; BCC = Bank CenterCredit; C, F, and M = corporate, financial, and management \npractices; KKB = Kazkommertsbank; NPL = nonperforming loan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n                                                 \n25 ADB has experience, through its Private Sector Operations Department, working with all three of these banks \n(footnote 9). \n26 ADB. 2003. Financial Intermediation Loans. Operations Manual. OM D6/BP and D6/OP. Manila (para. 9). See \nFinancial Analysis (Appendix 2) for detailed analysis of Damu and the three banks. \n ", "8    \n25.  ALB and KKB have submitted action plans acceptable to ADB to fulfill eligibility criteria. \nKKB is the largest bank in Kazakhstan, it is committed to expanding its SME portfolio throughout \nKazakhstan, and it has a good management team and a good credit and risk management system. \nAlliance is one of the larger banks in Kazakhstan, it is also committed to expanding its SME \nportfolio throughout Kazakhstan, and it has a good management team and good credit and risk \nmanagement  system.  Participation  of  these  banks  is  thus  justified.  Moreover,  since  ADB  is \ncurrently a creditor of ALB, ALB\u2019s participation in the investment program improves its potential to \nincrease  its  profitability  and  pay  its  creditors,  at  no  additional  risk  to  ADB  since  the  loan  is \nsovereign guaranteed. In addition, all of the banks have procedures and systems in place to \nensure compliance with ADB safeguards and have a track record in nonsubsidized SME lending.  \n \n26.  Since the end of 2007, Damu has been wholly owned by Samruk-Kazyna Sovereign Wealth \nFund, which holds a majority of seats on Damu\u2019s board of directors, and is being integrated into the \nstructure of the Samruk-Kazyna Sovereign Wealth Fund Group. Damu\u2019s risk management and \ninternal  control  system  is  designed  to  comply  with  Samruk-Kazyna  Sovereign  Wealth  Fund \nrequirements. In 2009, Damu acquired a new senior management team that appears to be well \ntrained, competent, and dedicated. Because of Damu\u2019s exposure to four banks that are or were \nbeing  restructured  and  are  now  majority  owned  by  Samruk-Kazyna  Sovereign  Wealth  Fund, \nDamu\u2019s overall financial condition remains weak (footnote 12). Samruk-Kazyna Sovereign Wealth \nFund\u2019s  strategy  supports  greater  autonomy  for  Damu,  with  less  dependence  on  government \nfunding. The MFF provides Damu with its first opportunity to raise external financing, to develop \nand roll out a new, market-based lending program, and to improve its effectiveness and efficiency \nto enable it to attract external financing over the longer term.  \n \n27.  The sustainability of the MFF will be supported by the market-based nature of the lending \nprogram, the institutional development of Damu, and implementation of the action plan. Damu will \nprovide ADB with information necessary to monitor ADB\u2019s results framework. \n \nB.  Governance \n28.  A financial management assessment of Damu and PFIs has been conducted. Based on the \nassessment, Damu\u2019s capabilities and systems are considered sound. However, improvements \nrecommended to ensure the sustainability of the program will be addressed under the TA. ADB \nreviewed the PFIs\u2019 credit, operational, and counterparty risks and is satisfied with the measures \nthat they have implemented for monitoring and mitigating these risks. ADB and Damu will monitor \nthe PFIs to ensure that loans made to SMEs will finance activities that are consistent with ADB's \nSafeguard Policy Statement and other SME loan qualification criteria (footnote 21). Their auditing \nprocedures  will  meet  ADB  requirements.  A  FAM  outlining  the  detailed  implementation \narrangements for the program will be adhered to throughout implementation (footnote 23). ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with Damu and \nthe PFIs. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n29.  Based  on  strong  economic  growth,  Kazakhstan  has  made  rapid  progress  in  poverty \nreduction. Poverty declined from 39% in 1998 to an estimated 14% in 2008. While data are not yet \navailable for 2009, there is indirect evidence\u2014from the number of persons applying for social \nassistance\u2014that the crisis has pushed more people into poverty. Although government initiatives \nhave provided part-time employment, this is only a temporary measure. Increased poverty is \nclosely  correlated  with  unemployment  and  underemployment.  SMEs  can  provide  employment \nopportunities to the poor. Bank credit is an important prerequisite for this goal. SMEs often have \nfew alternatives to bank credit for funding since the volume of private capital in the economy is \nlimited and funding from family members is difficult to raise. Thus, when lines of credit from banks ", "                                                                                                                            9\nare not available, SMEs are severely affected. Even if the owners of SMEs are not themselves \npoor, SMEs\u2019 use of bank credit will enable them to hire more workers, which will help raise \nemployment and indirectly reduce poverty.27  \n \n30.  While  Kazakhstan  has  a  good  record  in  gender  equality  and  related  issues,  the \nunemployment rate of women is higher than men (7.9% as compared to 5.3%) (footnote 27). \nCurrently, 33.7% of women are employed by small enterprises and 46.2% by medium-sized and \nlarge enterprises. Based on more limited employment opportunities, two-thirds of women become \nindividual entrepreneurs engaged in small trade activities, with limited opportunity for expansion \nbased on limited access to economic resources. For example, only 16% of the loans provided \nunder Damu programs go to women. The investment program is categorized as effective gender \nmainstreaming because it is expected to promote better monitoring, better outreach, and better \naccess to finance for women entrepreneurs seeking to expand or modernize their businesses.28 \n  \nD.  Safeguards \n31.  The investment program conforms to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and complies with \nKazakh labor, environmental, health, safety, and social laws and regulations. This investment \nprogram has been categorized as financial intermediary with respect to environment and social \nsafeguards. It is treated as category C because the subprojects financed under tranche 1 will have \nminimal  or  no  adverse  environmental  or  social  risks.  Subprojects  that  fall  under  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental and social safeguard categories A and B or that require government environmental \nassessment clearances will not be eligible for financing under the investment program. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  This is a complex program, since the MFF amount is more than $200 million. The potential \nrisks identified will be addressed by mitigating measures in consultation with Damu and MOE. ADB \nconveyed to Damu and MOE, ADB\u2019s strategy of identifying and mitigating potential risks.29 Major \nrisks and mitigating measures are identified in Table 6. \n \nTable 6: Potential Risks and Mitigation Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDownturn in economic activity reduces SMEs\u2019  Monitoring and dialogue under ADB\u2019s 2009 countercyclical support \ndemand for credit and repayment capacity  program to promote prudent macroeconomic policies and \ncountercyclical measures. \nGovernment subsidized lending programs distort  The investment program will provide market-based financing to \nmarket competition  SMEs and help address market failures. \nCurrency and interest rate mismatch of SME loans  The  investment  program  will  provide  medium-term,  fixed-rate, \nprovided by Kazakh banks  tenge-denominated loans to Damu to enable it to provide similar \nsubloans to PFIs to match fund their fixed-rate, tenge-denominated \nloans and leases to SMEs. \nADB  is  unable  to  raise  cost-effective  tenge- ADB has one year to raise and disburse tenge funds to Damu for \ndenominated  wholesale  funds  through  cross- on-lending to PFIs, which will commit to borrowing from Damu \ncurrency  swaps  because  of  a  disruption  in  the  under the investment program at a predetermined ceiling interest \ninternational swap market  rate. PFIs have the option to pay a higher interest rate during this \nperiod. ADB can also explore other sources of medium-term tenge, \nincluding a local bond issuance. \nDamu is unable to repay loans to ADB.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n33.  Damu and the PFIs have assured ADB that implementation of the investment program shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning financial intermediation loans, \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender  and  development,  and  disbursement.  These \nwarranties and representations are described in the FAM and relevant legal documents. Damu has \ngiven ADB certain undertakings for the MFF which are contained in the Framework Financing \nAgreement and Periodic Financing Request for Tranche 1 (footnote 2). Specific covenants agreed \nby Damu with respect to individual tranches under the MFF will be included in legal agreements for \nrespective tranches. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n34.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove: \n \n(i)  the provision of loans and guarantees under the multitranche financing facility in an \naggregate amount not exceeding $500,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \non such terms and conditions to be determined in accordance with then applicable \npolicies relating to allocation of and eligibility for such resources;  \n \n(ii)  the  administration  by  ADB  of  the  cofinancing  to  be  provided  by  development \npartners and other financing partners in the form of grants, loans, guarantees, and \nthrough other cofinancing products as described in para. 18 of this report; \n \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \nFramework Financing Agreement presented to the Board, all to Damu for the Small and Medium \nEnterprise Investment Program. \n \n35.  I recommend that the Board approve the proposal set out in para. 20 of this report that \ngoods, works, and consulting services procured from non-ADB member countries are eligible for \nfinancing under loans provided to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Republic of \nKazakhstan  under  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Investment  Program.  If  the  requisite \naffirmative vote of Directors representing not less than two thirds of the total voting power of ADB's \nmembers, pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank, is \nnot obtained for this recommendation and the Board only approves the recommendation in para. \n34, then only goods, works, and consulting services procured from ADB member countries will be \neligible for financing under loans provided to SMEs under the Small and Medium Enterprise \nInvestment Program. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n8 September 2010", "                                                                                                                                                             Appendix 1            11\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM  \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and Reporting \nSummary  Indicators  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions\nSustained job creation and  Increase in the SME sector\u2019s  Government statistics   Macroeconomic stability \neconomic growth  contribution to gross domestic     \nproduct from T2,683 billion in  Damu statistics disaggregated  Strong government commitment \n2009 to T5,000 billion in 2014  by gender  for reforms \n   \nSME sector employment  Global economy recovers from \nincreases from 2.088 million in  financial crisis \n2009 to 3.500 million in 2014   \nIncreased aggregate SME \nlending and leasing results in \nincreased aggregate output of \nSMEs \n \nRisk \nWeak absorptive capacity of \ngovernment agencies to \nimplement legislative and \nregulatory reform agenda (doing \nbusiness)  \nOutcome      Assumptions\nSMEs have increased  SME loan accounts opened by  Government statistics  Adequate demand for SME credit \naccess to medium-term  PFIs increases from 116,556 in    on market terms by SME \ncredit on a sustainable  2009 to 145,249 million in 2014  PFI reports  borrowers \nbasis.       \nOutstanding SME loans increase  Damu reports  PFIs have sufficient risk-taking \nfrom T1,708 billion in 2009 to  capacity and willingness to \nT2,129 billion in 2014  deliver medium-term credit to \nSMEs in a sustainable manner. \n \nGovernment implements \nmeasures to improve other SME \nand finance sector distortions \n \nRisk \nDownturn in economic activity \nreducing SMEs\u2019 demand for \ncredit and repayment capacity\nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
