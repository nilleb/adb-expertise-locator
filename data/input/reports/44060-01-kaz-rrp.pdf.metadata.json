The  MFF  is  proposed  to  help  Damu\u2014through  participating  financial  institutions  (PFIs)\u2013\naddress the unmet demand for longer-term, fixed-rate, local currency denominated credit by small \nand medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),1 and thereby address a key constraint to the development \nof SMEs.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n2. \nLimited small and medium-sized enterprises\u2019 contribution to gross domestic product. \nThe SME sector, which is primarily focused on trade (37%) and services (30%), has not kept pace \nwith  general  developments  in  the  economy  (Table  1). 2  SMEs\u2019  contribution  to  gross  domestic \nproduct  decreased  from  18%  in  2005  to  14%  in  2009,  while  the  contribution  of  large  enterprises \n(which  are  principally  involved  in  the  oil  and  minerals  sector)  continues  to  grow.  Kazakhstan\u2019s \nhighly concentrated economy and dependence on oil exports poses a potential threat to economic \ngrowth  given  the  volatility  of  the  international  oil  markets.  During  the  global  financial  crisis,  oil \nprices plummeted from $150 per barrel to $35 per barrel, resulting in a severe economic impact. To \nsupport sustained economic growth, economic diversification\u2014including a larger role for SMEs\u2014is \na key government priority.3  \n  \n\nTable 1: Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Contribution to Gross Domestic Product (%) \n\n% Share  \n\nSMEs \n\n1.

Prior  to  2002, \ncommercial banks were reluctant to lend to SMEs, which are usually considered high-risk based on \nlack  of  collateral  and  unreliable  financial  statements.  Most  SME  investment  was  financed  by \ninternal  resources.  Starting  in  2002,  based  on  access  to  external  credit  markets,  Kazakh \ncommercial  banks  dramatically  increased  their  lending  to  the  SME  sector.4 However,  starting  in \nmid-2007,  access  to  the  international  interbank  and  bond  markets  became  difficult  and  ended  in \nlate 2008 with the onset of the global financial crisis. This severely impacted the liquidity of Kazakh \nbanks,  resulted  in  a  decline  in  the  availability  of  domestic  credit,  and  created  a  debt  crisis  that \nexposed deep-seated problems within the Kazakh banking sector. The proportion of nonperforming \n\n                                                 \n1  The Law on Private Entrepreneurship (31 January 2006) defines small enterprises as enterprises with no more than 50 \nemployees and not more than $500,000 in average annual assets, and medium-sized enterprises as enterprises with \nnot more than 250 employees or not more than $3 million average annual net assets.  \n\n2  Framework Financing Agreement and Periodic Financing Request for Tranche 1 (Appendix 2). \n3  Government  of  Kazakhstan.  2010.  Business  Roadmap  2020.  Astana;  Government  of  Kazakhstan.  2010.  The \n\nAccelerated Industrial-Innovative Development (AIID) of Kazakhstan 2010\u20132015. Astana. \n\n4  Kazakh banks relied on short-term debt from the international interbank market to fund their growth since the domestic \ndeposit base is small (30% of gross domestic product). While deposits are growing, this is due largely to inflows from \npublic sector entities.  \n\n\f2\n\n \n\n \n\nloans grew to about 30% from only 3% in 2007. Several banks defaulted on their borrowings and \nhad  to  restructure  their  debts.  Lending  to  SMEs  declined  from  a  high  of  $5.3  billion  during  the \nsecond quarter of 2007 to $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2009. Under the Kazakhstan Anti-Crisis \nPlan,  the  Government  of  Kazakhstan  introduced  measures  to  strengthen  the  banking  sector, \nincluding providing subsidized credit lines to selected banks for SME lending.5  \n \n4. \nDamu,  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  the  Samruk-Kazyna  National  Wealth  Fund  (100% \nowned  by  the  government)  implements  these  credit  lines.  This  support,  along  with  other \ngovernment  actions,  led  to  significantly  increased  liquidity  in  the  system.6 Nevertheless,  SMEs\u2019 \naccess to longer-term credit for investment purposes is limited. The current estimated demand for \nsuch financing is around $2.8 billion, and will increase as the economy improves (footnote 2). \n\n5. \nGovernment  measures  to  develop  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises.  The \ngovernment recognizes that a prosperous SME sector is key for the country\u2019s long-term economic \ngrowth.  The  sector  is  a  major  creator  of  employment  and  innovation,  and  is  traditionally  more \nresponsive  and  adaptable  than  are  larger  enterprises.7 A  number  of  government  initiatives  have \nbeen undertaken in recent years to address the barriers faced by SMEs. State programs including \nthe  Business  Roadmap  2020  (footnote  3)  provide  the  general  policy  framework.  The  goal  is  to \ndiversify the production base and give prominence to development of the SME sector, in particular \nits  expansion  and  diversification.  In  turn,  developing  the  SME  sector  plays  an  important  role  in \nreducing poverty by generating income and employment.  \n \n6. \nDamu, which was established by the government in 1997 to stimulate the development of \nsmall  business  enterprises  and  ensure  better  use  of  public  funds  allocated  to  these  enterprises, \nplays  an  important  role  in  SME  development  by  implementing  the  government\u2019s  access  to  credit \nprograms for SMEs. Over the years, Damu\u2019s range of programs has evolved from direct lending to \nindirect  lending  through  banks.  From  1997  through  2009,  Damu  directly  financed  2,878  small \nbusiness projects in the amount of T33.3 billion (2% of all loans extended to small businesses in \nKazakhstan).  Damu\u2019s  financial  programs  for  SMEs  are  now  delivered  mostly  through  subsidized \nloans to selected partner banks, which are used to fund onlending to SMEs.  \n \n7. \nIn recognition of the increasing demand for SME finance and decreasing availability based \non  current  market  conditions,8 the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  and  Trade  (MOE),  which \noversees SME development, and Damu, in consultation with key stakeholders, adopted a results-\nbased SME Access to Finance Action Plan, 2010\u20132015. The plan seeks to ensure that SMEs have \nsustainable  access  to  necessary  short-term  working  capital  and  medium-term  finance  through  a \n$3 billion  investment  program.  It  also  includes  a  policy  framework  that  addresses  constraints  to \nsuch access as well as sets forth key guiding principles (footnote 2). \n \n8. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support  for  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises. \nSince  2006,  ADB  has  been  supporting  SME  development  through  direct  loans  and  partial  credit \n\n                                                 \n5  The government provided $1.9 billion in subsidized credit to 16 banks to be used for restructuring existing SMEs loans \n\nor for making new loans to SMEs. \n\nper annum. \n\n6  Short-term liquidity in the system is currently estimated at $12.5 billion and short-term deposit rates are less than 1% \n\n7  Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance: Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Finance and Leasing (Appendix 2). \n8  Kazakhstan has an underdeveloped deposit market. The average tenor of deposits is less than a year and banks have \ndifficulties raising medium- to long-term capital at desirable rates. This has resulted in a deficiency of medium- to long-\nterm  credit  to  banks\u2019  borrowers,  especially  SME  borrowers.  The  global  financial  crisis  exacerbated  this.  Prior  to  the \ncrisis,  banks\u2019  external  debts  were  mostly  US  dollar-denominated.  The  currency  exposure  was  passed  on  to  SMEs, \nmost of which lacked foreign currency earnings and the ability to hedge this exposure. During the crisis, the US dollar \nappreciated by more than 20% against the tenge, resulting in a heavy burden on SMEs.  Many SMEs were unable to \nservice their US dollar debt and had to file for bankruptcy. In addition, most SMEs have insufficient retained earnings to \nexpand their businesses, modernize, or upgrade key assets using their own funds. Working capital is also insufficient. \n\n\f                                                                                                                           \n\n3\n\nguarantees to four banks.9  However, as a result of the financial crisis, two of these banks (Alliance \nBank  [ALB]  and  BTA  Bank)  declared  a  moratorium  on  their  principal  payments  and  requested \nrestructuring of outstanding debt. The restructuring of ALB has been completed, while that of BTA \nBank is expected to be finished later this year.10 ADB is exploring future nonsovereign support and \nnew secured lending products combined with tighter loan portfolio monitoring to address potential \nrisks.  \n \n9. \nInnovative program design.  Because of the poor health of the banking sector, it is difficult \nfor ADB to provide traditional nonsovereign credit line and guarantee operations to support SMEs \nin Kazakhstan. ADB, however, remains committed to providing such support. For example, ADB\u2019s \n2009  Countercyclical  Support  Program11 helped  the  government  to  fund  post-crisis  SME  credit \nsupport  operations.12 At  the  request  of  the  government,  ADB  looked  at  a  number  of  options  to \nprovide  continued  support  over  the  medium  term  through  its  sovereign  operations.  The \ngovernment requested flexibility in lending products  as the health of the finance sector improves, \nand  asked  that  these  products  help  to  mitigate  currency,  interest,  and  tenor  mismatch  issues. \nDamu also requested assistance in improving its efficiency and effectiveness to enable it to raise \nexternal financing over the longer term.  \n \n10. \nIn  response,  ADB  developed  the  investment  program,  which  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \noverall strategy for Kazakhstan and reflects lessons learned. The investment program is designed \nas  an  MFF,  under  which  a  series  of  local  currency  loans  and  other  financing  products  will  be \nprovided over the medium term. The MFF enables flexibility as it will allow ADB to provide different \nforms of support (direct loans or guarantees) to Damu to help it fund its lending to PFIs. The MFF \nalso  enables  ADB  to  enter  into  a  multiyear  partnership  with  Damu  (and  possible  cofinancing \npartners) while creating stability and credibility at the level of the financing plan. To reflect lessons \nlearned,  the  investment  program  envisions  a  series  of  medium-term,  fixed-rate,  local  currency \nloans to Damu that will be used to fund back-to-back subloans to PFIs for onlending to SMEs. By \nproviding such loans, ADB will directly address currency, interest rate, and tenor mismatch risks. \nExperience has shown that these financial risks have been a significant cause of stress for SMEs \nand their banks.  \n \n11. \nFor  the  tranche  1  loan,  ADB  will  raise  local  currency  through  cross-currency  swaps  with \ninternational  bank  counterparties.  ADB  has  been  able  to  leverage  its  relationships  with \ninternational  banks  and  utilize  its  AAA  rating  to  extend  the  tenor  and  lower  the  pricing  of  cross-\ncurrency swaps. For subsequent tranches, ADB will work with MOE and Damu on the issuance of \nlocal currency bonds (LCBs) by ADB or, with an ADB guarantee, by Damu.13 Issuance of LCBs will \nhelp develop the local capital market by providing local investors with the opportunity to diversify \ntheir  investment  portfolios;  introduce  international  best  practice  standards;  help  develop  a  local \ncorporate  bond  yield  curve  and  establish  pricing  benchmarks  for  other  issuers;  and  advance  the \nprocess of mobilizing and channeling domestic savings into longer-term investments.  \n \nDonor  coordination.  The  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD) \n12. \nactively  supports  SMEs  in  Kazakhstan.  EBRD  programs  fund  international  advisers  who  provide \n                                                 \n9  ADB loans and guarantees without sovereign guarantee for SME lending have been provided to Alliance Bank (2006, \n$100 million  partial  credit  guarantee  and  $50  million  loan,  the  latter  of  which  was  recently  restructured);  Bank \nCenterCredit (2007, T6 billion loan funded by a private placement of a tenge-linked offshore bond); BTA Bank (2006, \n$75 million loan that was recently restructured); and Kazkommertsbank (2007, $100 million partial credit guarantee).  \n\n10 Development Coordination, footnote 2 (Appendix 2). \n11 ADB. 2009.

However,  MOE  requested  ADB  to \n\ndefer the issuance of LCBs until the second tranche.  \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\n \n\ncapacity  building  and  training  for  SMEs  and  support  to  rural  SMEs  to  improve  their  operations, \nenter  new  markets,  and  gain  access  to  financing.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment  has  supported  programs  that  have  provided  extensive  training  on  business  and \nconsulting  essentials  to  mostly  start-up  entrepreneurs  and  nongovernment  organization  business \nservice providers. EBRD has extended several credit lines to commercial banks to fund lending to \nSMEs. 14  Their  projects  are  sometimes  supported  by  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  help  banks \nintroduce  a  credit  scoring  methodology  and  improve  their  SME  lending  policies.  The  World  Bank \nhas  provided  Kazakhstan  with  the  Second  Agricultural  Post-Privatization  Project  ($96.1  million), \nwhich  has  a  component  for  promoting  sustainable  rural  microfinance.  The  International  Finance \nCorporation  promotes  SME  development  through  its  debt  and  equity  investments  in  banks  that \nprovide  loans  to  SMEs.15 ADB  coordinated  closely  with  other  development  partners  in  preparing \nthe investment program and MFF. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nImpact.

Damu  has  requested  an  MFF  of  the  local  currency  equivalent  of  $500 \nmillion  to  help  finance  part  of  the  investment  program  (Table  3).  The  MFF  will  be  structured  into \nthree or four tranches, all of which will be sovereign guaranteed. The first tranche amounts to the \nlocal  currency  equivalent  of  $150  million.  Tranche  2  is  estimated  at  $150  million,  local  currency \nequivalent.  Tranches  3  and  4  are  estimated  at  $100  million,  local  currency  equivalent.  Financing \nunder tranches 2, 3, and 4 may vary depending on the demand for market-based credit by viable \nSMEs  as  market  conditions  improve;  the  availability  of  external  credit  for  Kazakh  financial \ninstitutions;  and  the  interest  of  such  institutions  in  participating  in  the  facility.  Financing  will  also \ndepend on the availability of ADB resources; it is subject to Damu\u2019s submission of related periodic \nfinancing  requests,  execution  of  the  related  loan  agreements  for  each  tranche,  and  fulfillment  of \nconditions and undertakings set forth in the framework financing agreement. \n \n\nTable 3: Financing Plan for Output One of the Investment Program, 2010\u20132015 \n\nTotal ($ million) \nLocal Currency \nEquivalent \n\nShare (%) of Total \n\nSource \n\nADBa \n\nOther sources of financing not administered by ADB (estimated \ncofinancing based on estimated SME demand and availability) \n\nOther international financial institutions \n\nGovernment resourcesb \n\nPrivate financial institutionsc \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n500 \n\n100 \n\n400 \n\n800 \n\n1,000 \n\n2,800 \n\n18 \n\n4 \n\n14 \n\n28 \n\n36 \n\n100 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, SME = small and medium-sized enterprises. \na  Lent to Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund for onlending to participating financing institutions, and then by \n\nparticipating financing institutions to SMEs. \n\nb  Through subsidized lending program to enterprises engaged in priority sectors. \nc  Represents funding coming from short-term and other deposits and equity.   \nSource: Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund estimates. \n\n \n18. \nThe tranche 1 loan will be financed from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and guaranteed \nby  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan.

Each PFI will use its subloan to fund market-based, fixed-\nrate  tenge  loans,  leases,  and  other  forms  of  credit20 to  SMEs  for  investment  (acquisition  of  fixed \nassets),  working  capital  and/or  other  purposes  pursuant  to  a  newly  created  Damu  Market-Based \n\n                                                 \n17 Framework Financing Agreement and Periodic Financing Request for Tranche 1 (Appendix 2) have been negotiated. \nTheir  signing  by  the  government  is  being  delayed  due  to  the  need  on  the  part  of  the  government  to  complete \nintergovernmental  procedures  and  to  obtain  requisite  signing  authorizations.  Signing  is  expected  after  the  Board \napproval date. \n\n18 Or  from  such  other  markets  as  ADB  may  need  to  tap  into  to  raise  effective  fixed-rate  tenge  at  the  time  of  a  loan \nwithdrawal because of an unforeseen disruption in the international cross-currency swap market or other similar event.  \n\n19 Para. 24 and Financial Analysis (Appendix 2). \n20 Since Damu is not taking the credit risk of the SME borrowers, PFIs will independently determine the creditworthiness \nof the SMEs and ascertain the commercial terms and conditions of loans consistent with international best practices for \nlending to SMEs. \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\n \n\nSME  Loan  Program.21 Subprojects  will  be  required  to  comply  with  Kazakh  labor,  environmental, \nhealth,  safety,  and  social  laws  and  regulations,  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  safeguards  policies  (ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement [2009, Chapter D, para. 29]). After approval of the proposed MFF by \nADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors,  other  development  partners  and  commercial  lenders  may  complement \nADB\u2019s  financing  to  assist  Kazakhstan  to  develop  its  SME  sector  over  the  medium  term  through \ncofinancing to be administered by ADB. The amounts of the cofinancing so administered by ADB \nwill  be  deducted  from  the  total  MFF  amount  approved  by  the  Board.  Such  cofinancing  may  be \nprovided  as  grants,  loans,  guarantees,  or  through  other  cofinancing  products,  and  may  take  the \nform of joint or parallel financing. ADB\u2019s administration of such cofinancing from time to time will be \nreported to the Board for information annually.22 \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nDamu will be the executing agency for the MFF. Implementing agencies will be Damu and \n19. \nthe  PFIs.  Damu  has  a  clear  mandate  to  facilitate  greater  access  to  credit  by  SMEs  and  has \ndemonstrated  its  capacity  to  monitor  and  supervise  loans  to  banks  for  onlending  to  SMEs \n(footnote 12).  Damu  has  16  regional  offices  (one  in  each  oblast)  and  good  outreach  to  potential \nSME  borrowers.  Damu  will  designate  a  project  management  team,  headed  by  a  project  director, \nwho  will  report  to  the  Damu  chairperson.  The  implementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in \nTable 4 and described in more detail in the facility administration manual (FAM).23  \n \n\nTable 4:  Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nSMEs\u2019 access to finance action plan \n\nProgram management \nLoan disbursement \n\nArrangements \nDamu  in  coordination  with  the  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment and Trade and other key stakeholders \nDamu, through a program management team, and PFIs \nDamu  and  PFIs.  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2010,  as  amended \ntime),  and \nfrom \narrangements agreed to between Damu, PFIs and ADB \ndue  to  the  need  for  ADB  to  fund  each  withdrawal  on  a \nback-to-back basis. \n\ntime \n\nto \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  Damu  =  Damu  Entrepreneurship  Development  Fund,  PFI  =  participating  financial \ninstitution, SMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n20. \nSince  many  SMEs  will  be  importing  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services  from  or  are \nengaged in trade (para. 2) with both ADB and non-ADB member countries, including the Russian \nFederation, a request for Board approval is being made pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the Agreement \nEstablishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the  Charter),  to  approve  procurement  from  non-ADB \nmember countries in appropriate circumstances.24 Board approval on this issue is being requested \nwith  respect  to  procurement  by  SME  borrowers  using  loan  proceeds  under  the  investment \n\n                                                 \n21 PFIs  will  undertake  on  a  best  efforts  basis  that  (i)  funds  received  be  used  only  to  provide  credit  to  qualifying  SMEs \nwithin  12 months of receiving the funds; (ii)  at least 50% of the subloan proceeds be used for investment purposes; \nand (iii) at least 40% of the funds be lent to SMEs located outside of the cities of Almaty and Astana. No SME or group \nof related SMEs may borrow more than $3 million under the program. \n\n22 ADB. 2008. Mainstreaming the Multitranche Financing Facility. Manila (para. 79).  \n23 Facility Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n24 ADB.  1966.  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank.  Manila  (Article  14[ix])  provides:  \u201cThe  proceeds  of \nany  loan,  investment  or  other  financing  undertaken  in  the  ordinary  operations  of  the  Bank  or  with  Special  Funds \nestablished  by  the  Bank  pursuant  to  paragraph  1(i)  of  Article  19,  shall  be  used  only  for  procurement  of  goods  and \nservices  produced  in  member  countries,  except  in  any  case  in  which  the  Board  of  Directors,  by  a  vote  of  Directors \nrepresenting not less than two thirds of the total voting power of the members, determines to permit procurement in a \nnon-member  country  or  of  goods  and  services  produced  in  a  non-member  country  in  special  circumstances  making \nsuch procurement appropriate, as in the case of a non-member country in which a significant amount of financing has \nbeen provided  to the Bank.\u201d  \n\n\f                                                                                                                           \n\n7\n\nprogram.  This  request  reflects  the  market-based  nature  of  the  investment  program,  trade \nagreements, and SME demand and procurement history.   \n \n21. \nTo  strengthen  Damu\u2019s  efficiency  and  effectiveness  in  supporting  SMEs,  advisory  TA  is \nproposed  for  tranche  1.  The  TA  will  help  Damu  to  implement  and  roll  out  its  new  market-based \nSME lending program. The TA cost is estimated at $720,000, of which ADB will finance $650,000 \nas a grant from its Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). Damu will provide the balance of \n$70,000  through  in-kind  contributions.  ADB  will  engage  consultants  in  accordance  with  the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) to be contracted either \nas  individual  consultants  or  through  a  firm  using  the  biodata  technical  proposal.  The  TA  is \nexpected  to  commence  in  the  first  quarter  of  2011  and  be  completed  by  the  second  quarter  of \n2012. Implementation of the TA is detailed in the FAM. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n22. \nADB\u2019s  initial  due  diligence  indicates  that  the  MFF  and  the  tranche  1  loan  project  are \nfinancially  viable,  economically  sustainable,  socially  desirable,  and  legally  permissible  subject  to \ncompliance with the following criteria. \n \nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nDue  diligence  was  performed  on  Damu  and  three  banks  (ALB,  Bank  CenterCredit,  and \n23. \nKazkommertsbank  [KKB])25 that  expressed  interest  in  participating  in  Damu\u2019s  new  market-based \nSME  lending  program  funded  by  the  tranche  1  loan.  Although  due  diligence  revealed  that  two  of \nthe banks did not meet all (but only most) of the eligibility criteria (Table 5) set forth in para. 8 of \nOperations  Manual  Section  D6,  they  may  participate  in  tranche  1  based  on  their  agreement  to \nimplement measures to meet these criteria under time-bound action plans acceptable to ADB.26 \n \n24. \nUnder  the  agreed  selection  criteria  with  Damu,  to  participate  in  tranche  1,  each  financial \ninstitution  must  (i)  comply  with  capital  adequacy  requirements  and  other  prudential  requirements \nestablished  by  the  Agency  for  Regulation  of  Financial  Markets  or  have  an  agreed  action  plan  to \nbecome  fully  compliant;  (ii)  have  been  profitable  for  their  most  recently  completed  fiscal  year,  or \nhave an agreed action plan to achieve profitability; (iii) have a nonperforming loan ratio of less than \n10% or have an agreed action plan to reduce it to that level; (iv) have a credit rating of at least B\u2013 \nby a credit rating agency or equivalent rating acceptable to ADB; (v) have corporate, financial, and \nmanagement  practices  acceptable  to  ADB;  and  (vi)  have  satisfactorily  completed  ADB\u2019s  integrity \ndue diligence checklists. \n \n\n \nBank \n\nCapital \nAdequacy \n\nTable 5: Analysis of Banks\u2019 Compliance with Selection Criteria \nNPL  \n<10% \n\n \nProfitability \n\nC, F, and M \nPractices \n\nPrudential \nLimits \n\nCredit \nRating \n\nIntegrity Due \nDiligence \n\nYes (AP) \n\nNo (AP) \n\nNo (~80%) \n\nB-/B3/B- \n\nAcceptable \n\nSatisfactory \n\nALB \n\nBCC \n\nKKB \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nNo \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nB/Ba3/BBB- \n\nAcceptable \n\nSatisfactory \n\nNo (~20%) \n\nB-/B/Ba3 \n\nAcceptable \n\nSatisfactory \n\nALB = Alliance Bank; AP = action plan; BCC = Bank CenterCredit; C, F, and M = corporate, financial, and management \npractices; KKB = Kazkommertsbank; NPL = nonperforming loan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n\n                                                 \n25 ADB  has  experience,  through  its  Private  Sector  Operations  Department,  working  with  all  three  of  these  banks \n\n26 ADB.  2003.  Financial  Intermediation  Loans.  Operations  Manual.  OM  D6/BP  and  D6/OP.  Manila  (para.  9).  See \n\nFinancial Analysis (Appendix 2) for detailed analysis of Damu and the three banks. \n\n(footnote 9). \n\n \n\n\f8\n\n \n\n \n\n25. \nALB  and  KKB  have  submitted  action  plans  acceptable  to  ADB  to  fulfill  eligibility  criteria. \nKKB is the largest bank in Kazakhstan, it is committed to expanding its SME portfolio throughout \nKazakhstan, and it has a good management team and a good credit and risk management system. \nAlliance  is  one  of  the  larger  banks  in  Kazakhstan,  it  is  also  committed  to  expanding  its  SME \nportfolio  throughout  Kazakhstan,  and  it  has  a  good  management  team  and  good  credit  and  risk \nmanagement  system.  Participation  of  these  banks  is  thus  justified.  Moreover,  since  ADB  is \ncurrently a creditor of ALB, ALB\u2019s participation in the investment program improves its potential to \nincrease  its  profitability  and  pay  its  creditors,  at  no  additional  risk  to  ADB  since  the  loan  is \nsovereign  guaranteed.  In  addition,  all  of  the  banks  have  procedures  and  systems  in  place  to \nensure compliance with ADB safeguards and have a track record in nonsubsidized SME lending.  \n \n26. \nSince the end of 2007, Damu has been wholly owned by Samruk-Kazyna Sovereign Wealth \nFund, which holds a majority of seats on Damu\u2019s board of directors, and is being integrated into the \nstructure  of  the  Samruk-Kazyna  Sovereign  Wealth  Fund  Group.  Damu\u2019s  risk  management  and \ninternal  control  system  is  designed  to  comply  with  Samruk-Kazyna  Sovereign  Wealth  Fund \nrequirements.  In  2009,  Damu  acquired  a  new  senior  management  team  that  appears  to  be  well \ntrained,  competent,  and  dedicated.  Because  of  Damu\u2019s  exposure  to  four  banks  that  are  or  were \nbeing  restructured  and  are  now  majority  owned  by  Samruk-Kazyna  Sovereign  Wealth  Fund, \nDamu\u2019s overall financial condition remains weak (footnote 12). Samruk-Kazyna Sovereign Wealth \nFund\u2019s  strategy  supports  greater  autonomy  for  Damu,  with  less  dependence  on  government \nfunding.  The  MFF  provides  Damu  with  its  first  opportunity  to  raise  external  financing,  to  develop \nand roll out a new, market-based lending program, and to improve its effectiveness and efficiency \nto enable it to attract external financing over the longer term.  \n\n \n\n27. \nThe sustainability of the MFF will be supported by the market-based nature of the lending \nprogram, the institutional development of Damu, and implementation of the action plan. Damu will \nprovide ADB with information necessary to monitor ADB\u2019s results framework. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n28. \nA financial management assessment of Damu and PFIs has been conducted. Based on the \nassessment,  Damu\u2019s  capabilities  and  systems  are  considered  sound.  However,  improvements \nrecommended  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  program  will  be  addressed  under  the  TA.  ADB \nreviewed  the  PFIs\u2019  credit,  operational,  and  counterparty  risks  and  is  satisfied  with  the  measures \nthat they have implemented for monitoring and mitigating these risks. ADB and Damu will monitor \nthe PFIs to ensure that loans made to SMEs will finance activities that are consistent with ADB's \nSafeguard Policy Statement and other SME loan qualification criteria (footnote 21). Their auditing \nimplementation \nprocedures  will  meet  ADB  requirements.  A  FAM  outlining \narrangements for the program will be adhered to throughout implementation (footnote 23). ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with Damu and \nthe PFIs. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nthe  detailed \n\n29. \nBased  on  strong  economic  growth,  Kazakhstan  has  made  rapid  progress  in  poverty \nreduction. Poverty declined from 39% in 1998 to an estimated 14% in 2008. While data are not yet \navailable  for  2009,  there  is  indirect  evidence\u2014from  the  number  of  persons  applying  for  social \nassistance\u2014that the crisis has pushed more people into poverty. Although government initiatives \nhave  provided  part-time  employment,  this  is  only  a  temporary  measure.  Increased  poverty  is \nclosely  correlated  with  unemployment  and  underemployment.  SMEs  can  provide  employment \nopportunities  to  the  poor.  Bank  credit  is  an important  prerequisite  for this  goal.  SMEs  often  have \nfew  alternatives  to  bank  credit  for  funding  since  the  volume  of  private  capital  in  the  economy  is \nlimited and funding from family members is difficult to raise. Thus, when lines of credit from banks \n\n\f                                                                                                                           \n\n9\n\nare  not  available,  SMEs  are  severely  affected.  Even  if  the  owners  of  SMEs  are  not  themselves \npoor,  SMEs\u2019  use  of  bank  credit  will  enable  them  to  hire  more  workers,  which  will  help  raise \nemployment and indirectly reduce poverty.27  \n \n30.  While  Kazakhstan  has  a  good  record  in  gender  equality  and  related  issues,  the \nunemployment  rate  of  women  is  higher  than  men  (7.9%  as  compared  to  5.3%)  (footnote  27). \nCurrently,  33.7%  of  women  are  employed  by  small  enterprises  and  46.2%  by  medium-sized  and \nlarge enterprises. Based on more limited employment opportunities, two-thirds of women become \nindividual  entrepreneurs  engaged  in  small  trade  activities,  with  limited  opportunity  for  expansion \nbased  on  limited  access  to  economic  resources.  For  example,  only  16%  of  the  loans  provided \nunder Damu programs go to women. The investment program is categorized as effective gender \nmainstreaming  because  it  is  expected  to  promote  better  monitoring,  better  outreach,  and  better \naccess to finance for women entrepreneurs seeking to expand or modernize their businesses.28 \n  \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n31. \nThe investment program conforms to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and complies with \nKazakh  labor,  environmental,  health,  safety,  and  social  laws  and  regulations.  This  investment \nprogram  has  been  categorized  as  financial  intermediary  with  respect  to  environment  and  social \nsafeguards. It is treated as category C because the subprojects financed under tranche 1 will have \nminimal  or  no  adverse  environmental  or  social  risks.  Subprojects  that  fall  under  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental and social safeguard categories A and B or that require government environmental \nassessment clearances will not be eligible for financing under the investment program. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n32. \nThis is a complex program, since the MFF amount is more than $200 million. The potential \nrisks identified will be addressed by mitigating measures in consultation with Damu and MOE. ADB \nconveyed  to  Damu  and  MOE,  ADB\u2019s  strategy  of  identifying  and  mitigating  potential  risks.29 Major \nrisks and mitigating measures are identified in Table 6. \n \n\nTable 6: Potential Risks and Mitigation Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \n\nDownturn in economic activity reduces SMEs\u2019 \ndemand for credit and repayment capacity \n\nGovernment subsidized lending programs distort \nmarket competition \nCurrency  and  interest  rate  mismatch  of  SME  loans \nprovided by Kazakh banks \n\ntenge-\nis  unable \nADB \ndenominated  wholesale \nthrough  cross-\ncurrency  swaps  because  of  a  disruption  in  the \ninternational swap market \n\nto  raise  cost-effective \nfunds \n\nDamu is unable to repay loans to ADB. \n\nThe financial condition of two PFIs remains weak.  \n\n                                                 \n27 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 2). \n28 Gender Action Plan (Appendix 2). \n29 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\nMonitoring and dialogue under ADB\u2019s 2009 countercyclical support \nprogram to promote prudent macroeconomic policies and \ncountercyclical measures. \nThe investment program will provide market-based financing to \nSMEs and help address market failures. \nThe  investment  program  will  provide  medium-term,  fixed-rate, \ntenge-denominated  loans  to  Damu  to  enable  it  to  provide  similar \nsubloans to PFIs to match fund their fixed-rate, tenge-denominated \nloans and leases to SMEs. \nADB has one year to raise and disburse tenge funds to Damu for \non-lending  to  PFIs,  which  will  commit  to  borrowing  from  Damu \nunder  the  investment  program  at  a  predetermined  ceiling  interest \nrate. PFIs have the option to pay a higher interest rate during this \nperiod. ADB can also explore other sources of medium-term tenge, \nincluding a local bond issuance. \nLoans  under  the  MFF  will  be  guaranteed  by  the  Repubilc  of \nKazakhstan \nProgram  eligibility  criteria  require  PFIs  to  be  financially  sound  or \n\n\f10\n\n \n\n \n\nRisks \n\n \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nadopt  an  action  plan  to  improve  their  financial  condition.

These \nwarranties and representations are described in the FAM and relevant legal documents. Damu has \ngiven  ADB  certain  undertakings  for  the  MFF  which  are  contained  in  the  Framework  Financing \nAgreement and Periodic Financing Request for Tranche 1 (footnote 2). Specific covenants agreed \nby Damu with respect to individual tranches under the MFF will be included in legal agreements for \nrespective tranches. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n34. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove: \n \n\nthe  provision  of  loans  and  guarantees  under  the  multitranche  financing  facility  in  an \naggregate amount not exceeding $500,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \non  such  terms  and  conditions  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  then  applicable \npolicies relating to allocation of and eligibility for such resources;  \n\nthe  administration  by  ADB  of  the  cofinancing  to  be  provided  by  development \npartners and other financing partners in the form of grants, loans, guarantees, and \nthrough other cofinancing products as described in para. 18 of this report; \n\n \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \nFramework  Financing Agreement presented to the Board, all to Damu for the Small and Medium \nEnterprise Investment Program. \n \n35. \nI  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  proposal  set  out  in  para.  20  of  this  report  that \ngoods,  works,  and  consulting  services  procured  from  non-ADB  member  countries  are  eligible  for \nfinancing under loans provided to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Republic of \nKazakhstan  under  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Investment  Program.
