THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for subprogram 2 of the Energy Sector Reforms \nand Financial Sustainability Program. \n \n2.  The programmatic approach and subprogram 1 were approved on 6 December 2019 to \naddress financial, technical, and governance deficits in the energy sector that adversely impact \nsector sustainability and affordability, and Pakistan\u2019s fiscal balance and macroeconomic stability.1 \nSubprogram 2 aims to (i) secure financial sustainability by controlling the accumulation of and \nreducing \u201ccircular debt\u201d;2 (ii) strengthen governance by implementing a road map for a competitive \nelectricity market, appointing appellate tribunals, implementing multiyear tariffs,3 and unbundling \nthe gas segment; and (iii) reinforce infrastructure improvements through integrated planning to \nfacilitate public and private sector investment across the energy sector.  \n \n3.  Subprogram 24 is embedded in the programmatic approach and is consistent with the \nSustainable  Development  Finance  Policy.5 It  complements  and  mutually  reinforces  energy \nreforms with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under its $6 billion Extended Fund Facility \n(EFF)6 and the World Bank\u2019s approved $400 million Program for Affordable Clean Energy 1 for \nsector sustainability enhancement.7 The second through fifth reviews of the IMF\u2019s EFF were \napproved on 24 March 2021, effecting a disbursement of $500 million. 8 The sixth review was \nconcluded on 18 November 2021, making available for disbursement $1,059 million, bringing total \ndisbursements under the EFF to about $3,027 million.9  Subprogram 2 (footnote 4) is linked with \noperational  priority  (OP)  1  (addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities),  OP2 \n(accelerating progress in gender equality), OP3 (tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability),  and  OP6  (strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030.10 \nSubprogram 2 is aligned with meeting Pakistan\u2019s Nationally Determined Contribution targets for \nclimate change through the deployment of renewable energy by replacing thermal generation, \n \n1  ADB. 2019.

PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n4.  Macroeconomic  management  challenges.  The  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19) \npandemic hit Pakistan\u2019s macroeconomic performance at a critical juncture in its macroeconomic \nrecovery program. The economy was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, causing real \ngross domestic product (GDP) growth to contract to \u22120.5% in fiscal year (FY) 2020; GDP per \ncapita  continued  to  decrease  from  $1,321  in  FY2019  to  $1,250  in  FY2020;  inflation  was \nexacerbated,  averaging  10.7%  in  FY2020;  and  total  debt  climbed  to  87.2%  of  GDP.  The \ngovernment announced a relief package of PRs1,200 billion (2.9% of GDP) in March 2020, of \nwhich PRs715 billion (1.7% of GDP) was budgeted for FY2020 and PRs485 billion (1.2% of GDP) \nwas for FY2021. Support to consumers in agriculture, residential, and small and medium-sized \nenterprises was provided through deferred bill payments and industry support packages with a \nfixed tariff regime. Due to the government\u2019s swift response to the pandemic,  GDP growth \nrebounded strongly to 3.9% in FY2021. Inflation declined from 10.7% in FY2020 to 8.9% in \nFY2021, but rising food and energy prices kept it above the central bank\u2019s 6.5% target for the \nyear. The current account deficit eased slightly from the equivalent of 1.7% of GDP in FY2020 to \n0.6% in FY2021, driven by healthy growth in remittances.  \n \n5.  In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the government shifted its policy priorities to sustain \nthe economy, save lives and livelihoods, and expand social safety nets to prevent people from \nplunging into poverty. However, the economy is still struggling. Poverty incidence, measured at \n$3.2/day, has risen from 35.4% in 2019 to 39.1% in 2020; it is projected to remain around 31.9% \neven in 2021.11 The unemployment rate for FY2021, is still being assessed and is expected to \nincrease to 9.56% in FY2021 from 5.79% in FY2018. In FY2020, losses of large state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs) grew rapidly, constraining the government\u2019s fiscal position. Energy SOEs, \nwhich comprise about 60% of total SOE assets, were a major driver of these losses. The \npandemic has stressed the finances and fragmented the supply chain of the energy sector. This \ndisruption has led to a substantial slowdown in the pace of sector reforms initiated by the \ngovernment since early 2019. The impact on the country\u2019s energy sector circular debt arising from \nthese losses, and exacerbated by the pandemic relief measures, has put unprecedented pressure \non sector liquidity and finances. The programmatic approach has been adjusted to continue with \nthe reforms in the current challenging environment. \n \n6.  Circular debt. During the processing of subprogram 1 in January\u2013December 2019, in \nparallel with the approval and first review of the IMF\u2019s EFF program in the first half of FY2020, the \ncabinet approved a 3-year Circular Debt Management Plan (CDMP).12 The implementation of the \nplan was on track and circular debt accumulation decreased during FY2019 and in early FY2020 \n \n11 J.

Islamabad.  \n ", "3 \n \nto $215 million per month, from an average buildup of $272 million per month in FY2018. \nHowever, with the challenges of the pandemic during the second half of FY2020, circular debt \naccumulation soared to nearly $300 million per month.13 The demand for electricity plunged to \n52% for industrial users and 66% for commercial users compared with FY2019 volumes, while \ndemand for domestic and agricultural users grew 10%\u201315%. Since agriculture and residential \nconsumer tariffs are cross-subsidized by industrial and commercial tariffs, given the decrease in \nindustrial and commercial energy use and the Ministry of Finance\u2019s delayed disbursement of \nsubsidies, the  revenues  of  power  distribution  companies (DISCOs)  decreased  significantly. \nFurther, collection rates during FY2020 for domestic customers fell to 34% on average, partially \nbecause  of  the  government\u2019s  COVID-19  relief  measures  (tariff  moratorium  and  rolling  bill \ninstallments) during April\u2013December 2020. Total bill collections decreased from around 91% in \nFY2019 to 86% in FY2020. The result was increased circular debt accumulation to PRs538 billion \nagainst the government\u2019s business-as-usual forecasts of PRs127 billion for FY2020.14 Despite \nthe FY2020 circular debt challenges, FY2021 evidenced significantly lower circular debt flow of \nPRs297  billion  as  compared  to  previously  forecasted  PRs436  billion.15 To  continue  the \nconstructive mitigation of increased circular debt flow, reform policies must continue. Causes of \ncircular debt continue to include (i) inadequate tariffs and inefficient subsidies, (ii) high generation \ncosts, (iii) unsustainable losses, (iv) weak governance and collections, and (v) lack of integrated \nplanning. These need to be addressed through reform actions to manage and reduce circular \ndebt accumulation, in line with the government's updated 2021 CDMP (footnote 15). Figure 1 \nshows updated 2021 CDMP circular debt trend and projections, and Figure 2 shows updated \n2021 CDMP accumulated circular debt projections with and without reforms. \n \nFigure 1: Circular Debt Trendline (PRs billion)               Figure 2: Circular Debt Projections (PRs billion) \n \n       \n Note: Dotted lines are Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n Sources (Fig. 1 and 2): Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Energy; and Asian Development Bank \nestimates.  \n \n7.  Inadequate tariffs and inefficient subsidies. The government aims to reduce the \nsector\u2019s financial deficits through regular annual and automatic quarterly tariff assessments and \nnotifications. Under subprogram 1 in 2019, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority \n(NEPRA) determined and the Ministry of Energy (MOE) Power Division notified the FY2018 and \nFY2019 tariffs, adjusting tariffs to cover a PRs469 billion backlog accumulated since early 2017. \nWith a tariff increase trajectory in place for FY2020\u2013FY2022, under the cabinet-approved CDMP, \nthe government budgeted only PRs130 billion, 46% less than the FY2020 budget, for power \nsubsidies in FY2021. The challenges of the pandemic in the first half of FY2021 caused tariffs to \nbe frozen; bill payments to be phased over a 9-month period (April\u2013December 2020); and \n \n13  Ministry of Energy estimates.  \n14 Government of Pakistan.

Disruptions to collection cash \nflows and irregular subsidy payments to DISCOs, among others, caused circular debt flow to grow \nby  PRs211  billion  during  July\u2212December  2020,  against  the  projected  savings  surplus  of \nPRs54 billion.16 \n \n8.  High cost of generation. Pakistan\u2019s power policies of 1994, 2002, 2006, and 2015 were \nreactive to the country\u2019s generation crises and encouraged aggressive private sector participation \nthrough the establishment of fossil fuel-based generation because of the short gestation period. \nThis distorted the generation mix toward imported fuels (oil, liquified natural gas [LNG], and coal) \nunder the take-or-pay contracts, while reduced reliance on indigenous hydropower, renewable \nenergy sources, and local fuels increased the cost of generation. Independent power producers \n(IPPs) were offered 16%\u201320% returns on investment, pegged to the US dollar, which turned out \nto be much higher as the US dollar appreciated 5.3 times against the Pakistan rupee in 1995\u2013\n2020. The high cost of generation is also because of multiple other factors, including (i) indecision \non hydropower profits, (ii) transmission constraints that cannot evacuate about 13,000 megawatts \nof power, (iii) a flawed dispatch merit order policy, (iv) the financing cost of circular debt, and (v) \npricing of local gas and imported LNG. In April 2020, the government initiated discussions to \nrenegotiate power purchase agreements with IPPs to reduce capacity payments,17 by lowering \nreturns and interest on debt, extending debt tenors, and sharing operation and maintenance \nexpenses  equitably.  Further,  the  National  Electricity  Policy  (2021)  and  the  Alternative  and \nRenewable Energy Policy (2020) were prepared under subprogram 1. Both policies mandate \ncompetitive procurement of energy to optimize the generation cost and mix.18  \n \n9.  Unsustainable losses. The unrecovered cost of the generated units, combined with the \nlack of regulatory and private sector mechanisms to improve DISCOs\u2019 operational performance, \nremain  a  recurring  cause  of  circular  debt.  Of  the  123  billion  energy  units  (kilowatt-hours) \ngenerated in FY2019, the revenue of nearly 30% of these units was unaccounted for because (i) \ntransmission and distribution losses averaged 20%, and (ii) non-recoveries of the billed amount \naveraged 10%. The average DISCO inefficiency losses and under-recoveries in FY2020 were \nPRs241 billion. The programmatic approach and the government\u2019s reform program focus on \nmitigating technical and commercial losses, and reducing inefficiencies through private sector \ntargeted investments in the sector.  \n \n10.  Weak governance. Heavy reliance on sovereign financing has led to a heavy public \nsector influence on energy sector governance. Board and management positions of government-\nowned generation, transmission, and distribution companies continue to be held primarily by civil \nservants with limited sector experience and commercial focus. Under subprogram 1, the MOE \nadopted a general government policy applicable to all SOEs, to select board candidates through \na competitive and transparent process with at least one female board member. In April 2020, the \ncabinet approved the SOE governance reforms to divest and commercialize SOEs through private \nsector and public\u2013private participation modalities. Instead of targeting outright privatization of \npower DISCOs, which had been unsuccessful in the past, the government aims to consider \nconcession, management contracting, and outsourcing models. An SOE law, supported by ADB, \n \n16 Additional factors behind the rise in circular debt are the increasing capacity payment component in the generation \ntariff, interest and late fee payments to generators, and inefficiencies of DISCOs. \n17 A capacity payment is a tariff mechanism representing fixed required revenue, in exchange for dedicated fixed unit \navailability, to a generator/power producer based on per unit size (megawatt) of an electricity generator, calculated \non an annual basis by the regulator.  \n18 Earlier power sector policies stipulated provision of up-front tariffs and cost-plus tariffs on a noncompetitive basis. \n ", "5 \n \nis close to final approval and public announcement.19 Federal and provincial public\u2013private \npartnership laws and government agencies are already working to achieve these outcomes. \nCurrently, not all boards have female members, and increased focus is needed to diversify and \nopen the sector\u2019s talent pool. Without open, inclusive, and transparent appointments of board and \nmanagement  with  adequate  sector  experience,  poor  governance  accentuates  sector \ninefficiencies and adverse impacts on circular debt. \n \n11.  Lack of integrated system planning. Without integrated system planning accounting for \nthe total cost of supply and service, Pakistan continues to face intermittent energy supply\u2013\ndemand imbalances, an uneven generation mix, unbalanced switching costs between the gas \nand power segments, and mismatch between idle generation capacity and network availability. \nWith no generation crisis and the availability of surplus power, the government has utilized this \nopportunity to develop, with ADB support, a 25-year Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion \nPlan, the 5-year National Electricity Policy and Electricity Plan, and a market-oriented multi buyer\u2013\nmulti seller electricity trading model to address these planning constraints. Without further reform \naction to prepare the sector for a market-oriented trading model, lack of integrated system \nplanning instills inefficiencies and contributes to mounting circular debt. \n \nB.  Policy Reform, ADB\u2019s Value Addition, and Sustainability \n \n12.  Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the government remains committed to \nreform actions developed under the programmatic approach in achieving the requisite impact, \noutcome,  and  outputs.  This  includes  implementing  actions  achieved  and  completed  under \nsubprogram 1 in 2019 that continued through subprogram 2 and progresses further under \nsubprogram 3. In developing the program, ADB has undertaken multiple diagnostic and analytical \nstudies since 2018, and ADB has taken into account the recommendations of the Independent \nEvaluation  Department\u2019s  sector  assessment  performance  evaluation  of  Pakistan\u2019s  energy \nsector,20 which confirms that the reform and investment deficit in the sector would have been \nworse without ADB support.21 Given the changed sector context resulting from an unprecedented \npandemic, ADB also considered the industry analysis of the International Energy Agency, the \nInternational  Renewable  Energy  Agency,  and  other  ADB  corporate  and  country  reports  to \nreassess the programmatic approach. In April 2020, the cabinet endorsed five pillars of ongoing \nreforms following the programmatic approach to (i) realign generation costs, (ii) commercialize \ndistribution systems, (iii) strengthen SOE governance, (iv) optimize sector operations to reduce \ncosts, and (v) implement regulatory reforms for an open market. Support for this was endorsed \nthrough a joint letter from the presidents of ADB and the World Bank to the Prime Minister of \nPakistan in May 2020. The implementation period of the programmatic approach, as approved by \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors, remains 2019\u20132022. While revisions have been made, all reform \nactions included in the original policy matrix remain within the original scope and all actions are \nexpected  to  be  completed  within  the  Board-approved  programmatic  period.  Subprogram  2 \ncontinues the  programmatic  approach  and  drills  deeper  to  reduce financial,  technical,  and \ngovernance deficits in the sector by focusing on three reform areas. Based on ADB\u2019s assessment \nof the documents received, all subprogram 2 policy actions have been completed.  \n \n19 The government engaged a legal drafting team with support from ADB TA (ADB. 2018. Technical Assistance to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for Economic Management Support. Manila). The cabinet approved proposed law \ncovers SOE efficiency, benchmarked performance, management accountability, and ensured transparency. \n20 Independent Evaluation Department. 2019.

Actions in this pillar aim to address \ninefficient tariffs and subsidies, high generation costs, system losses, and lack of integrated \nplanning. Subprogram 1 (i) cleared a backlog of PRs469 billion through pending tariff adjustments, \n(ii) prepared and secured cabinet approval for the implementation of the CDMP from November \n2019 until the pandemic disruptions in March 2020, (iii) developed the first market-oriented \nNational Electricity Policy, (iv) revised the Renewable Energy Policy (2006) for transparent and \ncompetitive energy procurement, and (v) encouraged increased women\u2019s employment in the \nsector. Although the cabinet approved the CDMP under subprogram 1 in November 2019, the \ngovernment could not continue its implementation beyond March 2020 because of the ongoing \npandemic\u2014as tariff adjustments stalled and tariff subsidies could not be released regularly. By \nJanuary 2020, the government had raised tariffs for a fourth time, reaching a cumulative increase \nof 17% from the pre-January 2019 base tariff, and collected nearly PRs120 billion through an anti-\ntheft and bill recovery drive. The CDMP also entailed multiple measures to strengthen the \nefficiency of power entities following the State-Owned Enterprise (Governance and Operations) \nAct, 2020.   \n \n14.  Under subprogram 2, in close coordination with the IMF and the World Bank, the cabinet \napproved an updated CDMP in March 2021 that was revalidated in September 2021 and includes \na timetable for power tariff adjustments consistent with the NEPRA Act amendment 2021. The \namendment, effective 11 August 2021, aims to ensure automatic quarterly tariff adjustments and \nallowance for surcharges.22 Keeping in mind the need for cost recovery, while protecting the most \nvulnerable and avoiding further socioeconomic harm from COVID-19, following incremental tariff \nadjustments were determined and notified for (i) PRs1.95 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in February \n2021, (ii) PRs1.66 per kWh in October, 2021 and (iii) PRs1.39 per kWh from November 2021. 23  \nIn addition, the government approved the National Electricity Policy (2021)\u2014a key umbrella policy \nthat facilitates integrated resources planning and a movement to more open and competitive \nmarkets,  covering  efficiency,  transparency,  competition  in  renewable  energy,  transmission, \ndistribution, hydropower, and thermal power generation. Under subprogram 2, the MOE initiated \na diagnostic study with technical assistance (TA) support from ADB, to mainstream gender \nelements into relevant energy sector plans, to attain effective gender mainstreaming in the next \nsubprogram.  \n \n15.  Subprogram 3 actions reflect government plans to curtail circular debt accumulation by \ncontinuing tariff adjustments consistent with the NEPRA Act amendments adopted by Parliament \nin  2021  (footnote  22),  expanding  multiyear  tariffs,  and  furthering  the  formulation  and \nimplementation of sector plans (including gender mainstreaming components after subprogram \n2) to reduce transmission and distribution losses and the cost of electricity generation, by \ndeploying indigenous and less expensive renewable energy in Pakistan\u2019s overall energy mix.    \n \n16.  Reform area 2: institutional and regulatory governance strengthened. Actions in this \npillar aim to professionalize management to improve the operational and financial performance of \nsector entities. Under subprogram 1, the government initiated the transparent constitution of \nboards of energy sector entities and the inclusion of female representation, obtained regulatory \napproval with a time-bound action plan for the implementation of a competitive electricity model, \nstarted the separation of regulatory and policy functions in oil and gas procurement, confirmed \n \n22 Government of Pakistan, Regulation of Generation, Transmission and Distribution of Electric Power (Amendment) \nAct, 2021 (Also, known as the 2021 NEPRA Act Amendment).  \n23 Additional tariff increases per the Government of Pakistan Circular Debt Management Plan September 2021 include: \na FY2022 Q2 quarterly tariff adjustment of PRs0.22 in February 2022; a FY2022 annual rebasing of PRs0.63 in \nJanuary 2022, and a FY2023 annual rebasing of PRs2.17 in July 2022. \n ", "7 \n \nthe establishment of appellate tribunals to address complaints against the electricity regulator, \nand began the sale of two LNG-based power plants to facilitate private sector participation with \naim of improving operational and financial performance in the sector. \n \n17.  Subprogram 2 (i) progressed with reconstituting of boards of DISCOs and the National \nTransmission  and  Despatch  Company  (NTDC)  as  well  as  appointing  the  respective  chief \nexecutive officers in these entities through a merit-based and transparent process, (ii) ensured \nthat the first phase of NTDC organizational restructuring was completed to commence the \nnecessary  human  resources  reforms  in  2022,  and  (iii)  expanded  privatization  and \ncommercialization  plans  beyond  the  two  LNG-powered  generation  plants  and  two  DISCO \nrestructurings to explore and move forward  divestment options for all 10 DISCOs through \ncustomized concessions adapted to the local environment (i.e., management contracts and partial \noutsourcing  of  assets  underpinned  by  monitorable  performance  targets  and  an  incentive \nstructure). Subprogram 2 Policy Actions and Investment Opportunities details the private sector \nparticipation perspective on reform area 2 planned divestments and SOE reform actions and other \npolicy interventions.24 Gas industry reforms also progressed, including the implementation of \nunaccounted for gas plans and associated monitoring, to diversify the fuel mix to lower overall \npower generation costs. \n \n18.  Subprogram 3 will reinforce the actions implemented under subprogram 2 to ensure \ncontinued restructuring of the NTDC through the final phase of reform implementation\u2014placing \nemployees within the organization based on knowledge and skill. The appellate tribunal is \nexpected to be fully operational under subprogram 3, with results set to be monitored. The \ncommencement of bilateral contracting with the Central Power Purchase Agency-Guarantee \nLimited as the settlement center is a subprogram 3 objective that aims to enable sustainable \nefficiencies through open and transparent electricity trade and competition. Subprogram 3 will \nalso aim to carry through privatization efforts that include finalizing the sale of two LNG power \nplants,  and  monitoring  and  supporting  private  sector  investments  and  participation  in  the \ndownstream sector, to improve sector efficiencies and address sector deficits.  \n \n19.  Reform area 3: energy infrastructure improved. Actions in this pillar aim to improve \nenergy infrastructure by focusing on reduction plans for unaccounted for gas; and formulating an \noff-grid plan for conservation, energy efficiency, and renewables that includes technical training \nfor women in off-grid technology and domestic energy efficiency. Subprogram 1 developed time-\nbound implementation plans for a reduction in gas transmission and commercial losses. \n \n20.  Under subprogram 2, the regulator approved unaccounted for gas reduction plans and \nimplementation  commenced.  In  January  2021,  the  Ministry  of  Energy  established  a  plan \ndevelopment unit to lead the formulation of a national energy plan which includes conservation, \nenergy efficiency, and renewable options for off- and on-grid consumers. The national energy plan \nwill be completed in June 2022. The completion of the national energy plan, now moved to \nsubprogram 3, will be closely monitored by ADB, the IMF, and the World Bank together with its \nimplementation.  \n \n21.  Subprogram 3 will focus on effective monitoring and evaluation of unaccounted for gas \nresults; ensure approval and implementation of the  national energy plan; implement a net \nmetering policy to increase renewable energy on the grid; modernize the National Power Control \nCenter, with the installation of a supervisory control and data acquisition system; and strengthen \n \n24  ADB Private Sector Operations: Subprogram 2 Policy Actions and Investment Opportunities (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "8 \n \nenergy accounting through advance metering infrastructure to move toward the implementation \nof  an  action  plan  for  DISCO  commercialization,  including  efficient  infrastructure  and \ncommercialization analysis. \n \n22.  Revisions to subprogram 2 policy actions. Revisions of subprogram 2 policy actions \nmay be divided into three types: (i) revisions that clarify original policy actions, reflecting the \noriginally intended responsible party or parties and objectives; (ii) revisions that combine policy \nactions that have interlinking effects; and (iii) revisions that capture the actual and current \ncircumstances that reflect both slower reform progress and areas of reform that have been \nimplemented earlier than expected. The subprogram 2 policy matrix revisions keep the original \nprogrammatic approach reform objectives, and identify progress and necessary synergies across \npolicy actions in subprograms 1 and 2 and subsequent actions anticipated in subprogram 3. \nCOVID-19 slowed progress in some areas because of the government\u2019s redirection of fiscal \nresources to more urgent pandemic needs, such as saving lives and livelihoods. Electricity tariff \nincreases were delayed because of socioeconomic pressure in the pandemic during 2020 , but \nwere adjusted in February, October, and November 2021 to mitigate burgeoning circular debt. \nHowever, other related tariff and plan development actions gave way to the urgent need for quick \nrelief policies to offset sector constraints resulting from the pandemic. During the pandemic, the \nopportunity was taken to reevaluate actual changes in the power sector and the need for reform \nactions more fitting to altered circumstances. For example, expanding DISCO reforms beyond \ntwo and using a wider lens to assess the financial health and sustainability of all 10 DISCOs helps \nto advance more comprehensive downstream reform and opportunity for private sector entry.  \n \n23.   Of the total 22 indicative policy actions for Subprogram 2 originally approved in December \n2019, 2 upstream hydrocarbon related policy actions have been dropped, 10 actions remain \nunchanged while the other 10 policy actions have been revised and adjusted. Eight of the original \n22 actions have been merged to consolidate into four. Subprogram 2 policy actions now total 16. \nOf these 16 policy actions, 3 are weaker, 3 are strengthened, and the remaining 10 equally as \nstrong as the original policy actions. All reform actions remain within the programmatic approach \nand are expected to be completed by subprogram 3 in December 2022 (original expected \nprogram completion).25 \n \n24.   ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB is the largest development partner in Pakistan\u2019s energy \nsector; and has supported each administration in advancing reforms for a sustainable, affordable, \nand efficient sector. This has been done by combining analysis, policy dialogue, and projects with \na focus on donor coordination. ADB support across all energy subsectors has helped expand and \nstrengthen the national power grid, build power plants, increase access to electricity, and initiate \nimportant sector reforms. ADB has provided reform support under the Third Capital Markets \nProgram,26 setting the foundation for the formation of initial capital markets in Pakistan through \ndemand and supply reform measures that broaden and deepen the financial system in Pakistan \nand ground it in a strong legal and regulatory framework. Reform support under the Trade and \nCompetitiveness Program27 also supported Pakistan to recover its current account deficit in a \nsustained  manner  and  promote  macroeconomic  stability  by  facilitating  improved  trade \ncompetitiveness and exports. ADB\u2019s value addition is based on its long-term engagement with \npolicy-based and investment loans in Pakistan and a unified One ADB approach, combining staff \n \n25 Subprogram 2 Original Policy Action Revisions (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 ADB. 2020.

Subprogram 2 complements subprogram 1 by further remediating economic harms \nresulting from circular debt through tariff rate-base and design improvement, tariff notification \nstreamlining, generation cost reduction, open competitive bidding, and increasing private sector \nparticipation in the sector. \n \n25.  Previous ADB reform efforts. ADB\u2019s earlier support through the Accelerating Economic \nTransformation Program28 in 2008\u20132009 and the Sustainable Energy Sector Reform Program29 \nin 2014\u20132017 delivered limited progress in addressing the underlying causes of circular debt and \nstrengthening the sector\u2019s financial sustainability. Despite these limitations, the situation of the \nsector would have been even more precarious without ADB support. Earlier reforms included the \nautomatic fuel cost adjustment in tariff rationalization; the application of debt service surcharges \nto reduce subsidies; the implementation of multiyear tariffs; the separation of system and market \noperators; and an amendment to the NEPRA Act to clarify the government\u2019s policy-making \nfunctions and NEPRA\u2019s regulatory functions, especially in tariff setting. The amendments also \nprovided the foundation for an electricity trading market and an appellate tribunal as a dedicated \ndispute settlement mechanism for NEPRA decisions, included in the ongoing program. The \nCDMP developed in the Sustainable Energy Sector Reform Program could not attain the required \nresults as it did not fully appreciate the surge in generation capacity costs of nearly 153% caused \nby new IPPs, from FY2017 to FY2021. Further, it relied excessively on DISCOs\u2019 efficiency \nimprovements and on strategic sales proceeds from outright privatization, both of which were \nmore challenging than envisaged. Most distribution and generation companies are running at a \nloss, and IPPs are not being paid according to their contracts, which requires them to take out \nexpensive short-term financing to keep operating. The current program has addressed these \ndeficiencies, but tariff adjustments were stalled (albeit with delayed tariff adjustments), and the \nrelease of tariff subsidies has been irregular, among other CDMP requirements, because of \nlimited fiscal space and redirected fiscal policy during the pandemic.  \n \n26.  Lessons learned. The program incorporates lessons from previous ADB policy-based \ninterventions and ADB\u2019s sector assistance program evaluation recommendations (footnote 20).  \nThe key lessons identified by IED include: (i) incomplete policies and timid reforms cannot fully \naddress the underlying causes of circular debt, which jeopardizes the financial situation of the \nsector and the country and prolongs the reliance on government subsidies and bailouts; (ii) the \noperational and financial performance of unbundled sector entities cannot improve unless full \nautonomy is coupled with appropriate ownership and incentive structures to strengthen staff skills \nand capabilities, reduce overstaffing, and foster accountability; (iii) a multiyear reform commitment \nthrough  a  flexible  programmatic  approach  is  necessary  to  achieve  the  sector\u2019s  structural \ntransformation objectives and achieve long-term financial sustainability; (iv) neglecting integrated \nenergy planning contributes to sector inefficiencies because of a focus on short-term fixes for \nstructural problems; and (v) collaboration and continuous dialogue with the government and \ndevelopment partners is essential for effectuating reforms, while joint monitoring and evaluation \nand TA capacity support are key to the successful design and implementation of reforms. \nContinued and strong political support and guidance are essential to implement significant \nreforms. The ongoing programmatic approach is addressing all these aspects. \n \n \n28 ADB. 2008.

ADB will continue to support reform implementation through new energy sector initiatives, \nincluding TA projects in areas such as developing and monitoring the progress of the circular debt \nreduction plan, implementing the market-based financial settlement model, establishing the \nappellate tribunal, and strengthening capacity support to sector entities.30 ADB\u2019s pipeline of loan \nprojects is aligned with the identified infrastructure needs and supplements reform actions \n(footnotes 1 and 4). \n \n28.  Development partner coordination. Subprogram 2 was prepared in coordination with \nkey development partners and complements their projects and programs. It underpins energy \nsector reforms in the IMF  EFF and the World Bank\u2019s Resilient Institutions for Sustainable \nEconomy31 and  its  Program  for  Affordable  Clean  Energy  (footnote  7)  Development  Policy \nFinancing. Subprogram 2 policy actions on tariff notification, the circular debt reduction plan, and \nautomatic quarterly adjustments are supported in the IMF EFF. The scope and coverage of \nsubprogram 2 have been discussed with development donors, including the IMF, the World Bank, \nADB, the US, the United Kingdom, and other bilateral development partners active in the sector. \nIMF asserted upon recent conclusion of its sixth review that ADB\u2019s energy sector reforms under \nthe programmatic approach,  complements IMF-led reform initiatives by advancing electricity \nsector  reform  strategy  agreed  with  international  partners;  tackling  adverse  energy  sector \nspillovers on the budget, financial sector, and the real economy; and progressing the sector to \nfinancial viability (footnote 9). Regular consultations with the IMF continue, especially in the \ncontext of EFF implementation. The Circular Debt Management Plan, jointly agreed by ADB, the \nIMF, and the World Bank, was updated in 2021 by the MOE and endorsed by the cabinet. As \nrecently  articulated  by  IMF,  the  CDMP  guides  planned  management  improvements,  cost \nreductions, timely alignment of tariffs with cost recovery levels, and better target subsidies to the \nmost vulnerable (footnote 9). Subprogram 2\u2019s debt sustainability analysis, program monitoring, \nand disbursements sequencing have been fully coordinated with the IMF and the World Bank; \nand are consistent with the Sustainable Development Finance Policy (footnote 5). \n  \nC.  Expected Outcome of the Reforms  \n \n29.  The program\u2019s key impact remains financial sustainability and a self-reliant energy sector \nthrough reduced financial, technical, and governance deficits. The program\u2019s theory of change \nassumes that improved circular debt reduction and management leads to greater fiscal space for \nthe government to prioritize public spending in areas that stimulate economic growth, thereby \nimproving  macroeconomic  stability. 32 This  assumes  that  tariffs  are  adjusted  as  needed, \ngeneration costs are decreased, and distribution and transmission are efficient and competitive. \nHowever, if the reduced circular debt leads to imprudent public sector spending33 in other areas \nof the energy sector or economy, gains from the circular debt reduction would be lost and the \nthreat of continued macroeconomic instability would remain. ADB staff has made adjustments to \nthe  expected  program outcome  indicators for circular  debt flow  and stock  because  of the \nunprecedented COVID-19 pandemic shocks to the sector. The government has recalibrated \n \n30 ADB. 2017. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Update on Energy Sector Plan. Manila; \nADB. 2018.

Resilient Institutions for Sustainable Economy.  \n32 The IMF EFF aims to constructively impact Pakistan\u2019s fiscal balance and macroeconomic stability. \n33The IMF 2nd\u20135th review staff report notes that Pakistan must remain committed to the establishment and \ndevelopment of public financial management control systems to improve the efficiency of government spending and \nbudget processing (footnote 8). \n ", "11 \n \ncircular debt reduction forecasts, and the adjustments are reflected in the CDMP.34 By 2024, with \nsuccessful program implementation, expected program outcomes include: (i) new accumulation \nof circular debt per year will be reduced from PRs333 billion in FY2020 to less than PRs50 billion, \n(ii) accumulated payables will drop from PRs1,007 billion in FY2020 to PRs750 billion, and (iii) \nthe weighted average electricity generation cost will fall from $0.097/kWh in 2019 to $0.070/kWh. \nThe appellate tribunal is expected to resolve 60% of appeals of NEPRA decisions within 6 months. \nPast challenges to NEPRA determinations required court proceedings in Pakistan\u2019s judicial \nsystem, where regulatory determinations were stayed and cases would remain for years without \nresolution,  delaying  tariff  adjustments  while  circular  debt  mounted.  Timely  adjudication  of \nappellate challenges to NEPRA determinations is expected to have constructive impacts on \nreducing circular debt. Through improved circular debt management, the government expects \nDISCOs\u2019 collections to increase from 90.3% in 2019 to 99.4% in 2022 and losses to decrease in \nsix DISCOs by 1% annually, generating additional revenue of PRs118 billion by the end of \nFY2023.35 A reduction in the budgeted subsidy is expected from better targeting. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n30.  Pakistan\u2019s financing requirements are expected to be $94.5 billion in FY2022, to be \nfinanced by domestic and foreign sources (Table 1). The government\u2019s foreign borrowing is \nexpected to be $25.43 billion in FY2022 against foreign financing needs of $19.26 billion. The \nsurplus will be reflected as an increase in the reserve assets at the end of the fiscal year, after \nadjustments are made for any fluctuations in the gross financing requirement estimates. Table 1 \npresents Pakistan development financing needs for FY2022. \n \nTable 1: Development Financing Needs ($ million) \nItem  Amount \nGross financing requirement  94,506 \nGross domestic financing requirement  75,244 \nGross foreign financing requirement  19,262 \nAvailable financing  25,434 \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s policy-based loans and results-based loan   \nThird Capital Market Development Program, subprogram 2  300 \nEnergy Sector Reform Program, subprogram 2  300 \nIntegrated  Social  Protection  Development  Program  (results-based  112 \nloan)a \nWorld Bank, others  2,517 \nInternational Monetary Fund  2,000 \nBilateral   \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China  4,063 \nOthers  111 \nCommercial bonds  9,082 \nPrivate sector creditors  6,149 \nOther net capital inflows  800 \na The amount represents expected disbursement of $112.5 million in FY2022 from the proposed loan amount of $600 \nmillion. \n \n34 ADB modified the CDMP forecasts in light of a resurging COVID-19 wave in FY2021 and continued pandemic \nchallenges anticipated in FY2022. \n35 To recover the interest portion of circular debt stock, a surcharge of PRs0.43 per unit is levied in the consumer bill. \nThe remaining stock is being retired through the phased transfer of Power Holding Private Limited debt into public \ndebt (fiscalization) during 2021\u20132028. The schedule envisaged for the retirement of the principal is PRs47 billion in \nFY2021; PRs130 billion in FY2022; PRs164 billion in FY2023; and PRs127 billion each year thereafter until FY2028 \nto fully retire the debt. Interest payments of circular debt stock are being paid through budget and tariffs.    \n \n ", "12 \n \nSources: Debt Management Office, Ministry of Finance, and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n31.  Debt sustainability. The debt sustainability analysis suggests that the public debt-to-GDP \nratio is expected to decline gradually from 92.9% in FY2020 to 69.2% by FY2026.36 While total \npublic debt remains sustainable, during FY2020\u2013FY2025 the public debt-to-GDP ratio remains \nhigher  than  the  debt  threshold  of  70.0%,  before  declining  to  69.2%  in  FY2026.  Despite \nimprovement in the maturity structure of the public debt, macro-fiscal shocks continue to pose a \nthreat to debt sustainability. The government has so far successfully secured external financing \nto meet the financing gap, yet the lower-than-expected economic growth, the rise in primary \ndeficit, the increase in real interest rate, the surge in contingent liabilities, and the depreciation in \nthe  exchange  rate  can  potentially  widen  the  financing  gap  and  thereby  undermine  debt \nsustainability. Although financial assistance from ADB and other development partners will not \nimpair debt sustainability, the government will need to monitor fiscal risks and remain committed \nto fiscal consolidation to maintain macroeconomic stability to ensure debt sustainability. Financing \nunder the proposed subprogram 2 is integrated into the IMF\u2019s debt analysis.37 \n \nE.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n32.   The  Ministry  of  Finance  is  the  executing  agency,  responsible  for  overall  program \nmonitoring and reporting. The MOE (Power and Petroleum Divisions) is the implementing agency. \nThree TA projects support the policy actions for subprograms 2 and 3 (footnote 30). Subprogram \n2\u2019s implementation period is from 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2021, with disbursement in one \ntranche. Based on ADB\u2019s assessment of documents received, all subprogram 2 policy actions \nhave been completed. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn following ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). The loan closing date for \nsubprogram 2 is 30 June 2022. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n33.  Safeguards. Subprogram 2 is classified category C for the environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples because of the absence of direct or indirect impacts, as it \nis not expected to result in infrastructure development activities with adverse environmental or \nsocial impacts. Investment activities prohibited under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) \nare excluded.  \n \n34.  Technical. Several subprogram outputs have technical components at their core. The \nimplementation of the revised CDMP requires strong technical, financial, and project management \nskills, while operationalizing the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan needs sound \ntechnical and systems planning knowledge. Capacity support under the programmatic approach \nassists government entities to better manage these technical operations. Policy reforms are \ncomplemented by ADB\u2019s strong energy investment portfolio of $2 billion and the 2021\u20132023 \npipeline of $2.5 billion for sustainable infrastructure development to strengthen generation, \ntransmission, and distribution systems.  \n \n \n36 Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 The IMF program includes general budget support financing plans of the government, including this programmatic   \napproach and lending programs of all other development partners for 2019\u20132025. The Fiscal Responsibility and Debt \nLimitation Act, 2005 of Pakistan (amended in 2016) allows the government to borrow above the 60% of GDP public \ndebt ceiling by providing the justification for additional borrowing in the annual debt policy statement. \n ", "13 \n \n35.  Governance. Governance risk assessment was conducted in line with the Guidelines for \nImplementing ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan.38 The governance \nassessment  found  risks  that  could  affect  the  programmatic  approach,  such  as \n(i) unanticipated resistance from stakeholders with vested interests; (ii) reform delays attributed \nto the difficult fiscal position caused by unforeseen crises, e.g., worsening effects from the \ncontinued COVID-19 pandemic; and (iii) increased energy sector payables and slow recovery of \nenergy  sector  entities  discouraging  private  sector  investments.  The  subprogram  institutes \nimproved  governance  mechanisms  that  remain  in  effect  through  political  changes.  Energy \nremains the largest sector of ADB assistance in Pakistan, and the MOE has successfully \nimplemented ADB\u2019s energy portfolio of more than $7.5 billion since 2005. The cabinet approved \nthe CDMP, supported by the IMF, ADB, and the World Bank; and is bridging sector governance \ndeficits through sequenced policy interventions in the medium term. While no major resource \nmismanagement risks at the implementing level could be discerned, areas relating to the sector\u2019s \ninstitutional capacity and financial sustainability were targeted for capacity development in the TA \nprojects and the program\u2019s policy actions (footnote 30). \n \n36.  Poverty, social, and gender. The poverty reduction and social impacts are positive. The \ncountry\u2019s current energy crisis has adversely affected growth, squeezing limited employment \nopportunities in formal labor markets for both men and women. The program is expected to \nimprove the quality and reliability of power supply while benefiting commercial, domestic, urban, \nand rural consumers. The program has indirect benefits for the public, including poor segments \nof the population, by increasing job opportunities and thus improving the well-being of all, reducing \nindirect taxes, lowering costs, and increasing the outreach and access of energy services to \nremote districts. Encouraging private sector participation in the energy sector increases job \nopportunities. Compared with urban areas, rural poverty is high, accounting for four out of five \npoor individuals.39 Subprogram 2 supports the country\u2019s financial and economic stability, which is \ncrucial for the continuation of the government\u2019s social protection program being implemented \nunder the post-COVID-19 Ehsaas Strategy.40 Nearly half of the population\u2019s livelihoods are \ndirectly or indirectly associated with the agriculture sector. The labor force survey, 2017\u2013201841 \nestimates that the informal sector accounts for 71.7% of employment in non-agriculture jobs.  \n \n37.  Subprogram 2 is categorized some gender elements. A parallel cluster TA subproject \nsupports the preparation and implementation of the gender actions under subprograms 2 and 3.42 \nSubprogram  2  enables  development  of  the  National  Electricity  Plan,  2021\u20132025  to  be \nimplemented under subprogram 3, which reflects the government\u2019s gender mainstreaming policy \nto increase women's technical participation and representation in decision-making bodies. It \nbolsters women\u2019s participation through capacity building activities that enables women to take on \ntechnical  and management  positions.  Subprogram  2  also  strengthens  women\u2019s foothold  in \nenergy, through targeted training to produce women technicians and entrepreneurs.  \n \n38.  Risks and mitigating measures.
