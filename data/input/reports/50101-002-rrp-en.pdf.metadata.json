The  report  also  describes  the \nproposed administration of a grant to be provided by the High-Level Technology Fund (HLTF)1 \nand, if the Board approves the proposed loans and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated \nto me by the Board, approve the administration of the HLTF grant.   \n \n2. \nThe  sector  development  program  (SDP)  will  support  the  efforts  of  the  Government  of \nCambodia  to  provide  universal  access  to  improved  water  supply  and  sanitation  services,  and \nachieve safe hygiene behavior in rural areas by 2025.2 The SDP comprises (i) a project, financed \nby a loan and grants, to expand rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) services in at least \n11 districts across 10 provinces;3 and (ii) a program, financed by a policy-based loan, to support \ngovernance and institutional improvements in RWSS planning, financing, and service delivery.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nEconomic outlook. Cambodia has made significant strides in economic development. Its \n3. \nper  capita  gross  domestic  product  increased  fivefold  from  $300  in  2000  to  $1,500  in  2018.4 \nEconomic growth in 2018 remained strong at 7.3% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), fueled \nby  expanding  tourism  and  strong  foreign  direct  investment.5  Given  the  strong  link  between \neconomic growth and the provision of basic services, the government plans to ensure that all rural \nresidents,  who  account  for  about  77%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  population  of  16  million,  will  have \naccess to improved water supply and sanitation services by 2025.6  \n \nLimited  access  to  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  services.  In  2017,  access  to \n4. \nimproved water supply7 in rural areas stood at 73%, but only 11% of that water supply was piped. \nRural residents spend considerable time and financial resources on acquiring their daily drinking \nwater  from  distant  water  sources,  collecting  rainwater,  or  having  it  delivered  to  their  homes. \nAccess to improved sanitation was at 56% in rural areas, and about 41% of rural residents are \nstill practicing open defecation. Inequalities in access by income status are large. For example, \n\n                                                \n1  Financing partner: the Government of Japan.  \n2  Government of Cambodia, Ministry of Rural Development (MRD). 2014.

The selection criteria for districts and communes \nare  in  the  Project  Administration  Manual  (PAM)  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2). \nCommunes, the third level of administrative units, are subdivisions of districts.   \n\n4  International Monetary Fund.

Manila.  \n6  The World Bank estimated that economic losses because of poor sanitation were equivalent to 7.2% of Cambodia\u2019s \n\ngross domestic product in 2005: World Bank. 2008. Economic Impacts of Sanitation in Cambodia. Jakarta. \n\n7  The Joint Monitoring Programme of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) \ndefines improved water supply facilities as those which, by nature of their design and construction, have the potential \nto deliver safe water that meets the following criteria: (i) accessible on premises, (ii) available when needed, and \n(iii) free from contamination. An improved sanitation facility is one that  hygienically separates human excreta from \nhuman contact. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\namong  the  poorest  income  quintile  of  the  rural  population,  only  21%  had  access  to  improved \nsanitation, while access was at 100% in the richest income quintile.8  \n \n5. \nImpacts on health. Diarrhea, which often results from poor sanitation and hygiene, is a \nmajor cause of children\u2019s illnesses, including stunting and impaired brain development. It is the \nsecond  largest  cause  of  infant  and  under-five  mortality  in  Cambodia,  which  is  the  highest  in \nSoutheast  Asia.  About  30%  of  children  under  the  age  of  five  has  stunted  growth,  and  the \nprevalence of stunting is 10% higher among children born to mothers from the poorest income \nquintile  (42%).  Studies  also  suggest  that  open  defecation  harms  the  physical  and  cognitive \ndevelopment of children, drawing attention to the need for improving RWSS services.9 \n \n6. \nClimate  change  and  disaster  risks.  Flooding  and  drought  are  major  meteorological \nhazards  in  Cambodia.  In  2011,  floods  affected  more  than  1.5  million  people  in  18  of  the \n24 provinces, including four provinces along the Mekong River and the Tonle Sap Lake, which \nsuffered the heaviest damage. The total damage caused by floods was estimated to be more than \n1%  of  the  country\u2019s  gross  domestic  product.  In  2013,  floods  affected  1.5  million  people  and \nclaimed  168  lives  in  20  provinces.  In  2015  and  2016,  droughts  caused  less  rainfall,  warmer \nweather, and delayed or shortened monsoon rains, affecting about 2.4 million people. Cambodia \nis also exposed to climate change risks with increased flooding and prolonged droughts, which \nmay affect the quality of RWSS services. \n \nInstitutional  arrangements  for  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  services.  The \n7. \nMinistry of Rural Development (MRD) is the lead agency for RWSS and rural hygiene, through its \nDepartment  of  Rural  Health  Care  and  the  Department  of  Rural  Water  Supply.  The  Ministry  of \nHealth is responsible for providing adequate water, sanitation, and handwashing facilities in health \ncenters, in coordination with the MRD. The Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology issues \nthe permits required for the abstraction of a defined volume of water. The Ministry of Education, \nYouth and Sports is responsible for providing sanitation in schools, in coordination with the MRD. \nAt present, Cambodia has no structured approach to tariff setting for RWSS services, and cost \nrecovery is based on expenditures incurred by the service providers or based on the agreed tariff \nset by the water and sanitation user groups (WSUGs). \n \nLimitations  of  current  institutional  arrangements.  Cambodia  has  made  progress  in \n8. \nreforming the policy, legal, and institutional framework for decentralized RWSS service provision. \nHowever,  the  sustainable  delivery  of  services  is  still  hampered  by  structural  shortcomings, \nincluding  incomplete  decentralization reforms.10 The  MRD  has  not fully  decentralized  staff and \nfunctions;  communities  lack  adequate  guidelines  and  support  to  operate  and  maintain  RWSS \nfacilities; and private sector participation is limited to water supply services in a few towns and \nvillages  because  legislation  that  properly  governs  private  involvement  in  the  RWSS  service \nprovision does not exist.  \n \n9. \nWeak planning and governance functions. Despite broader access to improved RWSS \nservices, the government has not been able to develop a unified registry of RWSS facilities and \nassets, or a comprehensive information system. The RWSS databases that do exist are scattered \nand  fragmented,  and  not  publicly  accessible,  making  it  difficult  to  obtain  accurate  information \n\n \n\n                                                \n8   World  Health  Organization\u2013UNICEF  Joint  Monitoring  Programme.  2019.  Progress  on  Household  Drinking Water, \n\nSanitation and Hygiene 2000\u20132017. New York. \n\n9   International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 2013. Investing in the Next Generation: Growing Tall and \n\nSmart with Toilets. Water and Sanitation Program Research Brief. Washington DC. \n\n10  Decentralization is expected to improve service delivery since district administrations have better knowledge of the \n\nlocal needs and the decision-making process can be faster.  \n\n\fwhen planning investments in RWSS facilities or allocating sufficient resources for their operation \nand maintenance (O&M). \n \n10. \nInadequate fiscal resources. To meet the target of universal RWSS coverage by 2025, \nthe government would need about $70.0 million annually to create the necessary infrastructure. \nHowever, the annual budget allocation to RWSS has been only $1.5 million on average from 2008 \nto 2019. Moreover, while about $8.0 million a year would be required to ensure proper O&M of \nRWSS facilities, the annual budget allocation has been only $0.5 million. \n \n11. \nGovernment initiative to improve services and sector reforms. The government, with \nthe  support  from  development  partners  and  nongovernment  organizations,  made  significant \nprogress in increasing access to improved RWSS services. It boosted the coverage of rural water \nsupply from 48% in 2000 to 73% in 2017, and the coverage of rural sanitation services from 4% \nin 2000 to 56% in 2017 (footnote 8). It also issued the Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene \nStrategy (RWSSHS), 2014\u20132025 with the aim of achieving universal access to safe water supply \nand improved sanitation, and safe hygiene behavior in rural areas by 2025 (footnote 2). The MRD \nissued a national action plan11 as a time-bound operational plan to meet the RWSSHS objectives.  \n \n12. \nBoth the RWSSHS and the action plan include specific decentralization targets per the \ngovernment\u2019s wider program of subnational reforms, initiated in 200112 and scaled up under the \nLaw  on  Administrative  Management  of  Capital,  Provinces,  Municipalities,  Districts  and  Khan, \n2008. The government\u2019s approach to sector reform includes decentralizing the O&M of facilities \nto district administrations in accordance with the National Program for Subnational Democratic \nDevelopment,  2010\u20132019.13  Since  2016,  the  MRD  has  been  voluntarily  transferring  to  district \nadministrators the O&M functions for rural sanitation, hygiene, and water supply. This has been \npiloted in seven districts with the aim of scaling up the transfer as a next step.14 \n \n13. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) support to service improvements. Since 2005, three \nADB-supported  RWSS  interventions  totaling  $54  million  collectively  improved  water  supply  for \nabout 1 million people and sanitation for about 500,000 in more than 1,300 villages around Tonle \nSap Lake.15 This translates into 8% of Cambodia\u2019s rural population of 12.3 million gaining access \nto water supply and 4% gaining access to sanitation services. \n \n14. \nADB and development partners\u2019 support to policy reforms. ADB helped strengthen \nCambodia\u2019s RWSS policy by assisting the government\u2019s efforts of decentralization and capacity \nimprovements with two subprograms. Between 2008 and 2016, subprogram 1 supported the pilot \ndevolvement  of  RWSS  O&M  to  district  administrations,  and  subprogram  2  supported  further \ndecentralization of RWSS investment functions to district administrations.16   \n \n                                                \n11  MRD. 2019. National Action Plan for Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene 2019\u20132023. Phnom Penh. \n12  The  subnational  reform  (decentralization)  was  initiated  with  the  issuance  of  the  Law  on  Commune  and  Sangkat \n\n13  This includes (i) O&M of water supply facilities; and (ii) training and community development in sanitation, health, \n\nAdministration Management in 2001.   \n\nand hygiene matters. \n\n14  During the pilot, district administrations made progress on some of the newly delegated functions. However, late \ntransfer of funding from the MRD and limited human resources hampered the full implementation of the functions.   \n15  ADB. 2005.

Decentralized Public Service and Financial Management Sector Development Program \u2013 Subprogram 1. \n\nManila. Subprogram 2 was approved in August 2016.   \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fThe World Bank provided 3-year technical assistance (2013\u20132015) focusing on building \n15. \nthe  capacities  of  national  government  agencies  to  manage,  plan,  and  develop  a  policy  for  the \noverall RWSS segment; and of subnational agencies to deliver RWSS services in line with the \ndecentralization reform.17 In 2013, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Global \nSanitation Fund assisted the MRD in developing an RWSS monitoring and evaluation framework \nby analyzing the quality of RWSS facilities and the institutional arrangements for service delivery. \nThese efforts contributed to the design and implementation of the government\u2019s RWSS reforms. \n \nSector development program components and design feature. The SDP is the most \n16. \nappropriate modality, given the need for both an investment project and a reform program to help \nachieve the RWSSHS development targets by 2025 and implement the national action plan for \n2019\u20132023 in an integrated manner. The investment project will reduce gaps in access to RWSS \nservices by constructing new or rehabilitating existing RWSS facilities. The reform program will \nsupport  institutional  and  governance  reforms  to  create  a  more  efficient  RWSS  planning \nmechanism;  strengthen  institutional  capacities,  particularly  at  the  subnational  level;  encourage \nprivate  sector  participation  in  RWSS  service  provision;  and  enhance  the  resilience  of  RWSS \nfacilities. \n \n17. \nThe project component. The project component will expand RWSS access in at least \n11 districts in 10 provinces (footnote 3), benefiting about 400,000 people. The project will use a \nsector lending approach since (i) the government has a clear development plan targeting broader \nRWSS  coverage  by  2025  to  meet  sector  priorities;  (ii)  links  with  the  previous  RWSS  projects \n(footnote 15) are strong; (iii) the MRD has performed well in the previous RWSS projects;18 and \n(iv)  the  policies  applicable  to  the  sector  are  appropriate  and  will  be  improved  as  the  project \nprogresses  with  support  from  the  program  component.19  Subprojects  with  (i)  RWSS  services \ncoverage  below  the  national  average,  (ii)  high  poverty  levels,  and  (iii)  no  overlapping  RWSS \nprojects financed by other development partners or non-government organizations will be eligible \nfor project financing.20 The detailed selection criteria of subprojects are in the PAM (footnote 3). \n \n18. \nThe program component. The program will cover policy reforms to address (i) inefficient \nRWSS planning systems, (ii) limited authority and capacity of district  administrations to deliver \nRWSS services, (iii) poor RWSS asset inventory and management systems, (iv) limited private \nsector involvement, and (v) the need to include climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster \nrisk management (DRM) approaches in the RWSS planning process to enhance the resilience of \nRWSS facilities. \n \nLessons. The SDP\u2019s design benefits from the following lessons from ADB\u2019s three earlier \n19. \nRWSS interventions (footnote 15) in Cambodia: (i) ensure greater focus on addressing gender \ninequality and supporting women\u2019s leadership to overcome cultural norms; (ii) develop equitable \nsolutions to meet increases in the cost of community-based small piped water supply facilities; and \n(iii) introduce  CCA  and  DRM  measures  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  climate  change  and  natural \n\n                                                \n17  World Bank. 2016.

In the first project, \nimplementation was hampered by MRD\u2019s limited capacity, resulting in the project closing date being extended. In the \nthird project, the implementation has benefited from strengthened capacity, and is likely to be completed on time. \n\n19  ADB. 2003. Sector Lending. Operations Manual. OM D3/BP. Manila. \n20 \u201cSubproject\u201d refers to project activities at the commune level (e.g., all project activities in a commune are deemed \none  subproject).  Of  the  40  targeted  subprojects,  15  were  appraised  during  preparation.  The  project  will  be \nimplemented in four batches of subprojects, with the first batch consisting of 15 representative subprojects. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fhazards  on  the  quality  of  RWSS  services.21  Advance  procurement  of  civil  works  and  consulting \nservices helped ensure the timely completion of the first project. A similar approach will be adopted \nunder the project component of the SDP.   \n \nStrategic  alignment.  The  SDP  will  contribute  to  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  achieve \n20. \nuniversal coverage of improved water supply and sanitation services by 2025. The SDP is aligned \nwith pillars 1 (accelerate competitiveness and economic diversification) and 4 (improve governance)  \nof  ADB\u2019s  draft  country  partnership  strategy,  2019\u20132023  for  Cambodia,  and  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan, 2019-2021.22 The SDP is also in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \nand its operational priority (OP) 5 (promoting rural development), OP 2 (accelerating progress in \ngender equality), and OP 6 (strengthening governance and institutional capacity). \n \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  ADB  is  the  largest  contributor  to  infrastructure \n21. \ndevelopment  in  Cambodia\u2019s  water  supply  and  sanitation  segments,  both  urban  and  rural,  and \nprovides about 25% of the total externally financed aid for RWSS service provision. UNICEF is a \nkey  development  partner  for  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  hygiene,  and  the  lead  development \npartner in the technical working group for RWSS and hygiene.23 ADB coordinated the assessment \nand design of the SDP with the development partners, including the International Monetary Fund.   \n \nB. \n\nSector Development Program Description \n\n22. \nThe SDP\u2019s impact is aligned with the government\u2019s and the RWSSHS\u2019s target of universal \naccess to safe water supply and sanitation services in Cambodia by 2025. The SDP\u2019s outcome \nis universal access to safe and uninterrupted RWSS services in the participating districts. \n \n\n1. \n\nOutput  1:  Rural  water  supply  infrastructure  and  services  improved  and \nexpanded \n\n \nThe project will rehabilitate rural water supply facilities that are damaged by age or natural \n23. \nhazards,  and  build  new  ones  in  at  least  11  districts  in  10  provinces  (about  2,500  rural  water \nfacilities  in  at  least  400  villages  in  40  communes).  Selected  schools  and  health  centers  in  the \nparticipating districts will also receive such facilities, based on assessed needs, to ensure that \nthey have access to safe and uninterrupted water services. With financing support from the HLTF, \na pilot project of air-to-water generation units will be installed in seven locations that now have \nlimited access to safe drinking water, particularly during dry seasons.24  \n \nThe  design  of  the  facilities  will  incorporate  the  CCA  and  DRM  principles  to  reduce  the \n24. \nimpacts  of  natural  hazards  and  make  them  more  sustainable  and  resilient  to  weather  shocks. \nProject beneficiaries will provide in-kind contributions and, prior to the implementation of works, \ncommunities will be consulted on their affordability and willingness to contribute.

Atmospheric water \ngenerators replicate this natural process of condensation by simulating the dew point, which allows them to make \nwater continuously, even in low-humidity conditions. The condenser transforms the vapor in the air from gas to a \nliquid (water) by continuously reaching the dew point with cool air. \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fvillages selected for piped water supply, service connections and meters will be set up after piped \nwater supply has become available to ensure that each house has access to it.25 \n \n25. \nThe program will support the target of improving rural water quality by adopting procedures \nto  ensure  that  rural  drinking  water  is  routinely  tested  and  meets  government  standards.  The \nresults of these quality tests will be made available publicly through annual reports to be issued \nby the MRD.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput  2:  Rural  sanitation  infrastructure  and  services  improved  and \nexpanded \n\n \nThe project will build new toilets and septic facilities in households in at least 11 districts.26 \n26. \nIt will also construct public latrines at schools and/or health centers and advocate behavior change \ntoward  hygiene  and  sanitation  through  awareness  campaigns.  The  design  of  the  sanitation \nfacilities will also incorporate the CCA and DRM principles. The program will support the MRD in \nreducing  ground  water  contamination  by  adopting  the  standard  procedures  for  septage \nmanagement in rural areas. Routine monitoring to ensure compliance with the standard procedure \nwill be implemented, and results will be published in annual reports to be issued by the MRD.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Institutional capacity improved \n\n \n27. \nThe  project  will  (i)  strengthen  the  technical,  financial,  management,  and  leadership \ncapacity  of  national  and  participating  subnational  administration  staff  in  RWSS  investment \nplanning  and  O&M;  (ii)  support  the  Provincial  Departments  of  Rural  Development  (PDRDs)  in \npreparing annual reports on the quality of rural drinking water as verified in routine tests; and (iii) \nhelp project districts prepare RWSS safety plans by incorporating CCA and DRM in planning and \ndesign.  As  part  of  the  safety  plan  activities,  the  project  will  train  community  members  and \ngovernment staff on CCA and DRM principles. \n \n28. \nThe program will help develop and strengthen the management capacity of the MRD, its \nPDRDs, and the district administrations by introducing reforms to RWSS planning approaches. \nThis involves (i) developing an RWSS master plan and updating the RWSSHS; (ii) strengthening \nthe capacity and authority of district administrations by transferring personnel of the MRD\u2019s district \noffices and delegating their functions to district administrations; (iii) developing a computerized \nasset registry and information management system, which will help track the progress of asset \ncreation and the conditions of assets nationally, and assist investment planning and allocation of \nresources for  the O&M  of facilities;  and (iv)  encouraging  private sector  involvement  by  issuing \nenabling  regulations  and  guidelines  on  the  principles  of  responsibility,  accountability,  and \ntransparency for private RWSS service providers. \n \nC. \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\nThe project will ensure that safety plans with CCA and DRM measures are integrated in \n\n29. \n                                                \n25  In this case, the project will finance the construction of water sources and main pipelines. The WSUG will install the \nhouse connections and meters after receiving contributions from households. The project will also install public taps \nto enable poor households and those led by women who cannot afford house connections to have access to water.   \n  The  project  will  provide  the  substructure  material  for  latrines,  while  the  beneficiary  households  will  contribute  by \nproviding  labor  and  latrine  superstructure  materials  (details  as  per  the  PAM  [footnote  3]).  Overall,  community \ncontributions are estimated at $3.05 million for the construction of facilities and the O&M of built facilities. However, \nthe  contributions  are  not  included  in  the  project  cost  because  they  are  voluntary  and  will  not  involve  any  legal \nagreements between the project and community members.   \n\n26\n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fRWSS designs to enhance the sustainability of RWSS services, and draw from the climate risk \nand disaster vulnerability analysis carried out during project preparation.27 The project will also \npilot the installation of air-to-water generation units (footnote 24) financed under the HLTF to help \nvillages that have limited access to safe drinking water, particularly during dry seasons. About 2,500 \nvillage residents are expected to benefit from this pilot project. \n \nD. \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nOverall financing. The SDP is estimated to cost $52.9 million. ADB will provide a policy-\n30. \nbased loan of $15 million, an investment loan of $29.6 million, and an investment grant of $4.4 \nmillion. Grant cofinancing of $1 million from the HLTF will help fund the investment project.

The  government\u2019s  projected  total  net  borrowing \n31. \nrequirement for 2019 is estimated at $1.2 billion. To finance the deficit, the government plans to \nraise about $1 billion from loans, and about $0.2 billion through grants, from official development \nassistance. Of the annual $70 million required to achieve universal RWSS coverage by 2025, an \nestimated $10.5 million is needed for institutional and policy reforms. To facilitate the reforms, an \nestimated $63 million will be required over the 6-year period from 2019 to 2025, which marks the \nend of the current RWSSHS. The proposed policy-based loan will contribute $15 million (about \n23%), the government will finance $12.5 million (about 20%), and other development partners are \nlikely to finance $35.5 million (57%). \n \n32. \nThe  proposed  policy-based  loan.  The  government  requested  a  concessional  loan  of \n$15 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The size of the \npolicy-based loan reflects the government\u2019s overall financing needs, the strength of the reform, \nand  the  development  expenditures  arising  from  the  program,  as  specified  in  the  development \npolicy  letter  (Appendix  3)  and  the  policy  matrix  (Appendix  4).  The  policy-based  loan  will  be \ndisbursed  in  two  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of  $5  million  will  be  released  upon  loan \neffectiveness.28  The  second  tranche  of  $10  million  is  expected  to  be  released  in  March  2022, \nupon  full  compliance  with  the  second-tranche  conditions.  The  disbursement  is  split  into  two \ntranches because the first-tranche actions serve as the basis for the implementation of actions \nincluded in the second tranche. All policy actions will be applied nationally, i.e., beyond the project \nareas, to support the government in achieving universal RWSS service coverage. \n\n                                                \n27 Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 All policy actions under Tranche 1 have been completed. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \nB. \nC. \n \n\nThe proposed project financing.

The  project  has  initiated  advance  actions  to  recruit  the  project \n36. \nimplementation  consultant  and  to tender  procurement-ready  subprojects under  the first  of four \nsubproject batches (footnote 20). Contracts are expected to be awarded shortly after the loans \nand grants have been declared effective.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nFeedback  from  previous  project  beneficiaries  on \n\n37. \nthe  equipment,  facilities,  and \ntechnologies used have led to the development of tried-and-tested standard designs, which are \nselected based on the prevailing conditions at each commune and village. These designs have \nproven to be robust, durable, technically viable, and well received by the communities. The project \nwill  scale  up  the  designs  proven  to  be  compatible  with  local  conditions,  and  build  community \ncapacity for O&M. Location and design features of RWSS facilities will factor in climate change \nand  disaster risk  considerations, specifically  to provide  better  protection  against flood damage \nand potential contamination from latrines during flooding. Additional refinements will be made as \nmore emphasis is placed on sustainability, CCA, and DRM.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n38. \nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  project  component  were  quantified  in  terms  of  health \nbenefits. The economic analysis was done by conducting a cost\u2013benefit analysis over the project \nperiod,  calculating  the  economic  net  present  value  and  economic  internal  rate  of  return,  and \ncarrying  out  sensitivity  analysis  to  assess  the  impact  of  changes  in key  variables.  The  project \nbenefit  is  estimated  at  $57.3  million,  and  the  economic  net  present  value  is  estimated  at \n$32.3 million.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  22.0%,  which  is  above  the  economic \nopportunity  cost  of  capital  at  9.0%,  indicating  significant  economic  returns.  The  results  of  the \nsensitivity analysis ranged from 18.7% to 21.9%, and are deemed satisfactory under all scenarios. \nAs the project is not generating income, the financial analysis focused on assessing the project\u2019s \nfinancial sustainability. \n \nC. \n\nSustainability \n\n39. \nThe estimated annual O&M cost of $365,000 will be shouldered by the 100,000 benefiting \nhouseholds, implying that each household will be required to contribute $3.65 annually through \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fthe  WSUG.  Historical  data  on  funds  collected  by  WSUGs  under  the  previous  projects \n(footnote 15)  indicate  that  households  can  afford  this  cost,  which  establishes  the  financial \nsustainability of the project. Following the government\u2019s policies on O&M of RWSS facilities, a \nWSUG  will  be  established  for  each  facility  built.  The  institutional  arrangement,  roles,  and \nresponsibilities of the WSUGs will be in accordance with guidelines issued by the MRD. Details \nof the WSUGs\u2019 tasks, roles, and arrangements are provided in the PAM (footnote 3).  \n \nD. \n\nGovernance \n\n40. \nThe  procurement  risk  is rated  medium  because the  MRD  and  the  Ministry  of  Economy \nand  Finance  provided  satisfactory  procurement  supervision  under  the  previous  projects \n(footnote 15).  This  is  expected  to  continue  given  that  the  same  team  will  undertake  project \nimplementation and that the nature of procurement remains unchanged, i.e., involving small civil \nworks  and/or  goods  contracts.  The  procurement  of  civil  works  and  goods  and  selection  of \nconsultants  will  be  implemented  according  to  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017)  and  the \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017), as amended from time to time.   \n \n41. \nFinancial  management  assessments.  The  financial  management  risk  is  rated \nsubstantial  because  of  the  low  capacity  of  MRD  and  PDRD  staff  for  accounting  and  financial \nreporting,  the  presence  of  manual  data  inputs  in  financial  reporting,  and  a  poor  internal  audit \nfunction. To mitigate this risk, the project will finance training sessions, system enhancements, \nand improvements to the scope of internal audit. The financial management risk for this project is \nalso affected by the lack of an acceptable and fully adopted accounting standard in Cambodia\u2019s \npublic sector. ADB and other development partners are supporting the government in developing \nnational  financial  reporting  standards  that  fully  align  with  the  International  Public  Sector \nAccounting Standards. \n \n42. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MRD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 3). \n \nE. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n43. \nThe  SDP  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and  will  continue  the  gender \nmainstreaming activities begun under previous projects (footnote 15). Women and girls will benefit \nfrom time saved by not having to collect water, and from improvements to family health and quality \nof life. With better access to safe drinking water and sanitation, and greater awareness of hygiene, \nhouseholds  will  appreciate  (i)  spending  less  time  or  money  on  collecting  or  buying  water; \n(ii) spending  less  time  on  caring  for  family  members  who  fall  victim  to  water-borne  illnesses \nbecause of unsafe water supply and sanitation; and (ii) spending less on medicines.  \n \n44. \nGender  action  plan.  The  SDP\u2019s  gender  action  plan  combines  (i)  targets  for  female \nstaffing and decision-making  in  RWSS  and  communal  institutions;  (ii)  women\u2019s  participation  in \nplanning, design, and O&M of facilities; and (iii) actions to improve gender awareness among the \nimplementing  agencies.  It  places  high  importance  on  ensuring  that  the  design  of  subprojects \nconforms to the strategic objectives and principles of the  RWSSHS. The gender action plan is \nmindful  of  the  mandates  of  the  RWSSHS,  particularly  its  aspirations  to  mainstream  gender  in \nRWSS service provision. The SDP will target women for decision-making positions (at least 40%). \n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fF. \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n45. \ncategories are detailed below.29 \n \n46. \nEnvironment (category B). The project involves the construction of small-scale RWSS \ninfrastructure in villages to expand RWSS services. All subprojects are within residential areas, \nand environmental impacts are anticipated to be minor and localized and can be mitigated through \ngood  construction  site  management.  The  15  representative  subprojects  (the  first  batch)  are \nclassified as category C. The overall project classification is confirmed as B.30  \n \n47. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). Subprojects under the first batch are classified \nas category C for involuntary resettlement impact because they will be established on either public \nor privately owned land, where the infrastructure will be used based on the shared-use agreement \nbetween  beneficiary  households.  The  overall  project  classification  is  confirmed  as  C.  RWSS \nfacilities in the subsequent subprojects may require voluntary donation of minor portions of land \nand will be selected on a participatory basis by the communities.31  \n   \n48. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  B).  The  poverty  and  social  assessment,  conducted  as \npart of the project preparation, found that ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples reside in the \nareas where the subprojects will be implemented. The ethnic and indigenous people groups are \nfully integrated into mainstream society and enjoy equal rights.
