Ebeye is the \nlargest population center in Kwajalein Atoll and is the  second largest urban center in RMI  with \nan area of approximately 31 hectares and a population of more than 9,600.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nEbeye  has  a  high  incidence  of  waterborne  disease:  about  one  reported  case  per  eight \n3. \nresidents each year. Since 2001, Ebeye Hospital has reported an average of 1,182 cases per \nyear of waterborne disease, primarily gastroenteritis. The high incidence of waterborne disease \nis due to (i) limited access to safe water; (ii) ineffective hygiene, particularly among children; and \n(iii) a dilapidated sanitation system. \n\n \n\n4. \nLimited  sources  of  freshwater. The  primary  sources  of  potable water for  households \non  Ebeye  are  the  public  freshwater  supply  (78%)  produced  by  a  seawater  reverse  osmosis \n(SWRO)  desalination  plant  operated  by  the  Kwajalein  Atoll  Joint  Utilities  Resource,  Inc. \n(KAJUR), 3  household  rainwater  tanks  (21%),  and  bottled  water  (1%).  Ebeye  has  minimal \ngroundwater reserves and no freshwater streams. The Ebeye SWRO plant has four units with \nthe  following  potable  water  production  capacities:  387,500  liters  per  day  for  units  1  and  2, \n581,250 liters per day for unit 3, and 116,250 liters per day for unit 4. The first two units  were \ninstalled in 2000, but unit 1 has not operated since 2005 and unit 2 has not worked since 2011 \nbecause essential spare parts are no longer available. Unit 3, commissioned in 2001, produces \nan  average  of  474,000  liters  per  day,  but  it  requires  about  20%  more  energy  than  modern \nSWRO plants to produce the equivalent volume of potable water. Unit 4 was commissioned in \n2014  and  is  operating  at  about  67%  of  its  rated  capacity.4 In  total,  the  SWRO  plant  produces \nabout 590,100 liters of freshwater daily, potentially providing 61.5 liters per day to each Ebeye \nresident. \n \n5. \nHowever,  about  half  of  the  freshwater  produced  is  lost  because  of  leaks  in  the  supply \nnetwork.  Freshwater  production  capacity  is  also  constrained  by  the  limited  capacity  of  the \nsaltwater  water  supply  system.  Freshwater  is  supplied  to  households  through  the  freshwater \nsupply  network  for  about  1  hour  per  week.  Although  KAJUR  provides  a water  carting  service, \nmost  households  cannot  afford  the  delivery  charge  and  obtain  water  from  a  freshwater  filling \nstation operated by KAJUR when household supplies are depleted. Households are increasingly \nharvesting rainwater to increase access to freshwater, but this source is not secure because of \nseasonal  rainfall  patterns  and  more  frequent  droughts.  In  drought  years,  water  stored  in \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  The  project  was  prepared  under  Asian  Development  Bank.  2012.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  the \n\nMarshall Islands to Prepare the Ebeye Water Supply and Sanitation Project. Manila (TA 8306-RMI). \n\n3  KAJUR, a state-owned enterprise, also provides electricity generation and distribution, and sewerage services on \n\nEbeye. KAJUR also has a saltwater distribution network for the operation of the Ebeye\u2019s sewerage network. \n\n4  The United States provided unit 4 as part of its response to the RMI drought disaster in 2013. \n\n\frainwater  tanks  is  rapidly  consumed  and  the  tanks  may  remain  empty  for  long  periods  unless \nfilled from the KAJUR freshwater supply. \n \n6. \nLow  awareness  on  hygiene  and  water-related  issues.  Public  awareness  and \neducation  activities  and  outreach  on  hygiene  and  water-related  issues  are  limited.  A  long-\nduration hygiene and water awareness campaign is required to foster the sustained behavioral \nchange  required  to  improve  hygiene  and  reduce  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases. \nCampaigns  need  to  focus  on  women  and  children  through  programs  delivered  to  womens\u2019 \ngroups  and  in  schools.5 Upgrading  school  sanitation  facilities  on  Ebeye,  where  the  ratio  of \nstudents to functioning toilets exceeds 150 to 1 in some cases, is necessary to foster improved \nhygiene behavior among Ebeye\u2019s students. \n \nDilapidated  sewer  system.  The  Ebeye  saltwater  sewerage  system,  commissioned  in \n7. \n1967, has progressively failed because of a lack of maintenance. Saltwater for the operation of \nthe  sewer  system  and  for  firefighting  is  sourced  from  two  deep  wells  and  pumped  through  a \ndedicated  saltwater  reticulation  network  to  most  areas  on  Ebeye.  However,  pressure  in  the \nsaltwater reticulation mains is too low to operate fire hydrants. The sewage treatment plant has \nnot  operated  since  2001  and  untreated  sewage  is  discharged  into  the  lagoon.  The  sewage \npump  stations  have  limited  pumping  capacity  and  break  down  frequently.  Most  sewers  on  the \nnorthern  and  eastern  sides  of  Ebeye  are  partially  blocked  with  sediment,  and  high  levels  of \nseawater have infiltrated the sewers. The seawater infiltration and pump failures often result in \nsewage overflows. Those overflows  and  the discharge  of raw  sewage to the  lagoon  present  a \nserious  health  hazard.  Water  quality  testing  by  the  government\u2019s  Environmental  Protection \nAgency  indicates that the marine water quality at several locations on Ebeye\u2019s lagoon foreshore \ndoes not meet agency standards because of sewage contamination. \n \n8. \nReliance  on  electricity  supply.  Because  of  the  topography  and  the  scarcity  of \nfreshwater, the water supply and sewerage systems on Ebeye rely on the electricity distribution \nsystem  to  (i)  pump  saltwater  from  wells  to  the  SWRO  plant  and  to  the  saltwater  sewerage \nsystem,  (ii)  operate  the  SWRO  plant  for  production  of  freshwater,  (iii)  distribute  freshwater \nthrough  the  freshwater  supply  network,  and  (iv)  operate  the  sewage  pump  stations.  Overall, \nEbeye\u2019s  electricity  system  is  reliable  and  continuously  meets  the  demand  for  electricity. \nHowever,  several  components  of  the  electricity  distribution  system  have  outlived  their  design \nlives or require replacement to build the resilience of the electricity supply. These components \ninclude  the  high-voltage  busbars  and  protection  systems  and  high-voltage  switchgear  at  the \nEbeye  power  station,  and  most  wooden  power  poles.  The  power  station  monitoring  system \nneeds to be replaced to improve the station\u2019s operational efficiency. \n \n9. \nUnsustainable  water  and  sewerage  services.  Since  2008,  KAJUR  has  recorded \nannual  operating  losses  of  $2  million  or  more.  Electricity  services  account  for  about  88%  of \nKAJUR\u2019s operating revenue, with the balance sourced from freshwater sales to commercial and \ngovernment  customers.  KAJUR  provides  freshwater  and  sewerage  services  to  residential \ncustomers for free.  KAJUR  has  financed the gap between expenditure  and operating  revenue \nthrough grants from the United States.6 KAJUR has developed a reform strategy to improve its \nfinancial  sustainability  through  better  operational  efficiency  and  higher  revenues.7 The  reform \nstrategy  includes  the  installation  of  consumer  meters  and  the  introduction  of  user  charges  for \n\n                                                \n5   Children under the age of 15 years are 45% of Ebeye\u2019s population. \n6   Through the RMI\u2013United States Compact of Free Association. \n7  KAJUR. 2011.

Water  supply,  sewerage,  and  electricity \nmaster  plans  and  associated  prioritized  investment  plans  have  been  prepared  along  with  a \nhygiene  awareness  and  education  program.  Project  components  were  selected  and \ninvestments  were  prioritized  in  the  master  plans  through  a  public  consultation  process.  The \n\n                                                \n17  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fproject adopts the least-cost approach, which (i) minimizes operation management risks, (ii) has \nthe lowest environmental risk, and (iii) offers the greatest flexibility for future growth. \n \n21. \nThe existing water supply and sewerage systems will be rehabilitated and expanded to \nconnect  households  that  are  unserviced.  The  energy-inefficient  SWRO  plant  will  be  replaced \nand  the  freshwater  production  capacity  increased.  Primary  sewage  treatment  facilities  will  be \ninstalled  and  treated  effluent  will  be  discharged  through  a  new  lagoon  outfall.  The  SWRO \nfreshwater  production  and  primary  sewage  treatment  technologies  are  appropriate  given \nKAJUR\u2019s  SWRO  plant  operation  experience  and  the  simplicity  of  the  proposed  sewage \ntreatment process. Under their supply contracts, SWRO and sewage treatment plant suppliers \nwill be required to guarantee the availability of essential spare parts for at least 15 years. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nThe  integrated  benefits  of  the  project  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  project  costs.  The \nfinancial evaluation of the project was based on its full financial costs, including taxes and duties \nand  physical  contingencies.  Incremental  financial  costs  were  evaluated  against  projected \nincremental  revenues  from  electricity,  water  supply,  and  sewer  service  operations  that  are \nenabled  by  the  project.  Incremental  values,  for  both  costs  and  revenue,  were  determined  by \ncomparing the with-project and without-project scenarios. The financial internal rate of return for \nthe  project  is  18.1%,  substantially  above  the  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of \n3.5%, indicating that the project is financially viable. \n\n \n23. \nThe economic analysis compared the discounted costs and benefits under the with- and \nwithout-project scenarios during 2014\u20132048 in constant 2015 prices.18 The without-project case \nrepresents  a  continuation of the  existing  situation; the  with-project  case represents the  project \ninvestment scenario. The project cost is estimated at $16.6 million, excluding taxes and duties, \nprice  contingencies,  and  grant  administration  fees.  The  economic  benefits  used  to  assess  the \nproject economic viability were (i) incremental water supply valued at willingness to pay; and (ii) \nhealth  benefits  measured  as  avoidance  of  the  costs  of  illness  related  to  waterborne  diseases, \nespecially  diarrhea  and  gastroenteritis.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  the  project  is \nestimated at 12.8%, above the opportunity cost of capital (12.0%). \n \n24. \nSensitivity analyses were undertaken on the economic results to examine the impacts of \nkey  assumptions  and  project  risks  as  follows:  (i)  capital  cost  increased  by  20%,  (ii)  operation \nand maintenance  cost  increased  by  20%,  (iii)  incremental  water  supply  benefits  decreased  by \n20%,  and  (iv)  health  benefits  decreased  by  20%.  Under  these  scenarios,  when  assessed \nindividually,  the  viability  of  the  project  falls,  with  economic  internal  rates  of  return  of  8.9%\u2013\n12.8%. When all scenarios are considered together the economic internal rate of return for the \nproject drops to 5.9%.19 \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\n25. \nFinancial  management.  Since  2008,  KAJUR  has  recorded  operating  losses  of  $2 \nmillion  or  more,  primarily  because  of  inadequate  tariffs  and  high  fuel  costs  for  electricity \nproduction.  Limited  financial  reporting  and  poor  financial  record  management,  coupled  with \n                                                \n18 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Programs and projects in weakly performing countries should not be expected to always yield the same financial \nand  economic  rates  of  return  as  would  be  expected  in  stronger  performing  developing  member  countries.

Manila.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nturnover of experienced senior management since 2010, have also contributed to KAJUR\u2019s poor \nfinancial  performance.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  KAJUR  concluded  that  the \nfinancial  control  risk  is  high  because  of  KAJUR\u2019s  (i)  lack  of  experience  in  managing  large \nprojects,  (ii)  weak  record-keeping,  and  (iii)  new  management.  Mitigating  measures  are \nincorporated  in  the  project.  KAJUR  will  be  responsible  for  maintaining  project  accounts  and \npreparing grant withdrawal applications. A financial management advisor will be recruited under \nthe  project  to  help  KAJUR  implement  its  financial  reform  plan,  build  its  financial  management \ncapacity, and support the preparation of the project\u2019s financial documentation. \n \n26. \nProcurement  capacity.  Procurement  capacity  assessments  were  undertaken  of  the \ngovernment  for  the  public  sector  program  in  2012  and  of  KAJUR  in  2014.  Government \nprocurement  is  done  in  accordance  with  the  Procurement  Code  (Act),  1988  and  applies  to \nexpenditure of public funds irrespective of their source by the government. KAJUR, as a state-\nowned enterprise, is subject to the Procurement Code. Procurement risks under the project are \nconsidered low. However, KAJUR has limited procurement experience and no experience with \nthe procurement procedures of a multilateral development bank. All procurement of goods and \nworks will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended \nfrom time to time).20 All consultants will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Targeted procurement training for KAJUR \nwill  be  conducted  soon  after  project  approval.  The  project  implementation  assistance \nconsultants will support the project management unit\u2019s procurement activities. \n \n27. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto,  and  discussed  with,  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nEbeye residents have a high incidence of gastroenteritis and other waterborne diseases. \n28. \nThe  project  impact  will  reduce  the  incidence  of waterborne  diseases  by providing  all  residents \nwith  direct  access  to  safe  and  sustainable  water  and  sewerage  services,  and  by  enhancing \npublic  awareness  of  hygiene  and  water  issues.  The  result  will  be  a  healthier  and  more \nproductive population with fewer private and public funds spent on medical services, and fewer \nwork and school days lost to illness. About 50% of households have access to both freshwater \nsupply  and  sewerage  connections.  Households  that  do  not  have  access  to  freshwater  and \nsewerage connections are those that suffer income poverty. The project will reduce poverty of \nopportunity  by  improving  and  extending  potable water  and  sewerage  services  to  all  residents. \nThe project will also help institute lifeline tariffs to enable poor households to access freshwater, \nsewerage, and electricity services. \n \nThe project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. The project includes gender \n29. \ndesign features to ensure women\u2019s participation in the project and access to project benefits. A \ngender action plan has been prepared and includes (i) the Hygiene Awareness and Promotion \nProgram, which targets women and children; (ii) creation of jobs and skills training for women in \noperation  and  maintenance  and as  part  of  the  household water  service and sanitation fixtures \nprogram;  (iii)  engagement  of  an  international  gender  specialist  and  a  national  community \n\n                                                \n20 Since  ADB  is  administering  cofinancing  in  the  form  of  a  grant  from  the  Government  of  Australia  for  operations \nfinanced  by  the  ADF,  universal  procurement  will  apply  to  all  procurement  packages  to  be  financed  by  ADF \nresources and/or the grant from the Government of Australia. \n\n\fparticipation  and  gender  specialist;  and  (iv) \nmainstreaming in service provision for KAJUR staff.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\ntraining \n\nin  gender  analysis  and  gender \n\n30. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  the  environment.  An  initial \nenvironmental  examination  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009).  The  project  provides  positive  environmental  benefits  by  improving  the \nenvironmentally  safe  collection  and  treatment  of  sewage  on  Ebeye.  Sewage  overflows  within \nthe  collection  network  will  be  reduced  significantly.  The  quality  of  sewage  treatment  will  meet \nappropriate standards for the marine environment. Sludge disposal will go to landfills complying \nwith  international  standards.  Adverse  environmental  impacts  of  the  project  will  mainly  be \nconstruction  impacts,  which  are  expected  to  be  minimal  for  land-based  works.  The  proposed \nsewer effluent outfall construction on the lagoon reef will require adequate mitigation measures. \nThe environmental management plan outlines the risks and mitigating actions to be undertaken \nduring project implementation.21 As KAJUR\u2019s environmental management capacity is limited, an \ninternational  and  a  national  environmental  specialist  will  be  engaged  through  the  project  to \nstrengthen KAJUR\u2019s capacity in this area. \n \n31. \nClimate  change. The project is assessed as having medium climate change risks. Key \nclimate change risks are sea level rise and onshore category 1 storms. Climate risk profiles for \nRMI indicate that the main impacts of climate change will be higher air and water temperatures, \nhigher sea levels, changing rainfall patterns, more severe and frequent droughts, and continuing \nocean acidification. Best estimates of long-term, systematic changes in the average climate for \nRMI indicate that sea level is likely to rise by up to 30 centimeters and the frequency of severe \nshort-term sea level rise resulting from a storm surge will increase from a one in 500-year event \nto  a  one  in  2-year  event  by  2055.22 The  project  will  help  Ebeye  develop  greater  resilience  to \nclimate change by increasing freshwater production and introducing more energy-efficient water \nsupply and sewerage systems. \n \n32. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples. The project is classified category \nB for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. A resettlement plan was \nprepared for the project in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Most of the civil \nworks  will  be  constructed  on  land  leased  to  the  Kwajalein  Atoll  Development  Authority,  which \ndedicates existing and planned road and utility corridors to public use in perpetuity. The project \nwill  have  minor  resettlement  impacts  affecting  20  households  (147  persons),  including  the \nacquisition  of  easements  (about  0.54  hectares).  KAJUR  and  the  government  will  finance, \nimplement,  and  monitor  the  resettlement  plan.  The  people  of  Ebeye  consider  themselves \nindigenous in terms of ethnic origin. The project is not expected to have a negative impact on \nany distinct or vulnerable group of indigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement. The project will support capacity development within KAJUR to manage safeguards. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33.
